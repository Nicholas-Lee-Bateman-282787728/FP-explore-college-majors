1380279,5,B00004Z4WQ,"A wonderfull movie that gives comedy a new meaning. This movie is the new  parody for all the latest box office hits. It includes visual effects that  won't embarrass any special effects movie displayed today. Also, the movie  take all the blood, guts and theory out of all the movies we loved to see,  and ran to buy, and assembles them in a mixture that is un-believable in  it's marvel.

1380339,5,B00004Z4WQ,"I've seen all the movies, and all of them several times each, on dvd and vhs formats, and on the first three, I've seen all three on both vhs and dvd and own the first two on both formats. I loved the first film, and set out to see the next three. I caught one on TV and rented the others. The series started out with the best of intentions and made what I think is a very funny movie. Some of the characters were annoying, and some scenes aren't as funny now or never were in some cases, but they made a movie where you want to see what happens next and what they throw at you, and let's face it. Some of the movies they lampoon were just ripe for the picking. I loved the I know what you did last summer book (although, I love daughters of eve more) and I was semi-disappointed by the movie which wasn't much like the book. Blair witch might have been a big deal then, but when you look back at it, it's just people wandering around in the woods and fighting over losing the map. Scary movie took this and made it funny. Cindy and her friends (who feature two often annoying, sometimes less than funny African American stereotypes) do something they would rather forget they did, but someone else cannot forget it. Soon, her friends start dying off, and the mystery must be solved: who knows? The characters are mostly idiots, but the funniest one is doofy. The characters are often such terrible people, you're kind of glad they died. This is the best movie in the series and after seeing all 5, I think the series just went down hill slowly after this, trotting out these I can't believe it's him/her cameos (Lindsey lohan, Charlie sheen, tori spelling) and just not being as funny as the original.",1478217600,2,1702,4.338557993730408

First off, I am a hardcore horror fan and this was horror with tons of comedy. Okay I get that it was supposed to make you laugh at HORROR but I didn't like the nudity, vulgarity and gross scenes. I felt that it was way too overrated. The Wasssssuuppp was cool though :)

The Wayans Brothers are just not my cup of tea!",1475452800,,382,4.0131578947368425

1380371,5,B00004Z4WQ,"Honestly, this movie is vulgar. Like extremely. There's a lot of jokes that reference other movies which is what this is essentially. An old, classic (to me I watched this when it first came out so long ago) movie that is making fun of Scream and other movies in one. There are Dude where are my car references, I know what you did last summer references and so on.

I was pleasantly surprised to see that Amazon had the first one available to view as I personally feel the first 2 are the only Scary Movies worth watching. I will watch this over and over and over again. I believe even though it is vulgar and the jokes can be crude that it's actually a comedy worth something.",1474156800,,678,4.296875

1380593,4,B00004Z4WQ,"Scary movie was a movie that spoofed the horror franchise movies of the late 1990s, specifically Scream and I Know What You DidLlast Summer.  In a twist of irony, it would itself become a franchise after the Wayans were no longer involved with it, and would eventually become watered down and repetitive.  The original movie however was very fresh and innovative.  It spoofed more than just the horror movies of the time, it injected pop culture references of the era, and made fun of movies like The Sixth Sense, The Matrix, The Blair Witch Project and even The Usual Suspects.  It was mainly making fun of the silliness of the horror franchise movies, and would start as almost shot for shot takes of Scream and I know what you did last summer, and then add a ton of absurdity to them.

Anna Farris was the main character, Cindy Campbell, basically the character Sidney Prescott played by Neve Campbell in Scream.  Shannon Elizabeth played Buffy, which was basically the character played by Sarah Michelle Gellar in I know what you did last summer.  The other roles were filled mainly with character actors, and Shawn and Marlon Wayans.  Kurt Smith, as the town sheriff stole pretty much every scene he was in, and Cheri Oteri as Gail Hailstorm was hilarious as well.  It was definitely a low-brow comedy with crude humor, but it worked because it did not take itself, or the genre it was spoofing too seriously.  And because it was really the original spoof (at least of the 1990s/2000s) film that was copied over, and over again with not only multiple sequels under the same name, but a ton of other movies spoofing some genre or another.

Realistically the movie has been out long enough now that anyone reading this will know whether they like it or not.  If you do like the movie and get the DVD, there are a handful of deleted scenes and a short behind the scenes feature.  Okay for what is there, but nothing special.  I have the original DVD release, so I am not sure if any of the re-releases have more.",1463788800,,2014,4.589385474860335

1380671,2,B00004Z4WQ,"This is mostly a critique on the blu-ray itself. It had been years since I actually watched Scary Movie, even though I've owned it on DVD for years, and figured I was due for an upgrade.

The movie quality on the blu-ray is... terrible. There is little to no HD detail on anything, every edge looks incredibly blurry, and compared to other blu-rays on the same and other TVs, it looks really bad. It honestly doesn't look that much different than when my PS3 upscales my DVD copy of the movie. Judging by the case and all that, I'm guessing it was from when blu-ray was just coming out and maybe Miramax didn't really know what they were doing fully just yet.

Any other complaint is just kind of comestic. Like when I started playing the movie, the default sound setting was the 5.1 AC3 audio on the disc instead of Uncompressed PCM available. That much was just weird, I don't even know why there's an AC3 on the disc when PCM is available. Once again, maybe they didn't fully understand how to make the discs yet. Then the menus are sort of obnoxious. They work just fine, but when you click between titles, they make a very loud switch noise that could've either been turned down a bit, replaced, or fully muted. It's louder than anything else on the menu and was just annoying. On top of that, I'm pretty sure it's missing a bonus feature from the DVD - the video for The Unband's cover of ""Everybody Wants You"" - but I'm sure that was probably a licensing thing and honestly not a major loss since I still own the DVD. All the deleted scenes are still on it, so that's cool.

The movie itself is still pretty good. I rewatched it to see if maybe I was wrong for liking it - maybe it's just as bad as its sequels and spiritual spin-offs. Turns out this one is pretty well done. It feels like they actually spent time trying to focus on the story and spending time making jokes about that rather than just doing blatant reference humor (""Look, it's Jigsaw! That's a joke in itself, right? But make him gay! Har!""). My only problem is just how exaggerated some of the characters are. It's a spoof though - everything is supposed to be magnified to the nth degree so it can directly make fun of it more effectively, but I feel like it spends a little too much time trying to establish Doofy's mental handicap and Ray's homosexuality, and it starts to feel like the joke is a little bit meaner than it should be. Just ""Ha! He pooped himself! Because he's stupid!"" and ""Ha! He called her a man's name when having sex! Because he's clearly gay!"" It gets old quick. Everything else is kind of on point though. Still holds up decently.

So unless you can get the blu-ray for cheaper than the DVD, don't bother. The DVD quality isn't that different. Maybe some day Miramax or Lionsgate or someone will rerelease it in a new transfer that actually is HD, but until then, this is kind of a waste of money.",1432771200,,2899,4.382899628252788
1380672,5,B00004Z4WQ,"Upgraded this movie to Blu-Ray from DVD, and that was the point of this purchase (especially at a $4 price here on Amazon, which made it well worth it).  Picture quality is a little better than the DVD, but not too much.  It's definitely worth the upgrade at this price though.  And definitely worth the Blu-Ray purchase if you are looking to buy this movie for the first time (or if you're upgrading from VHS), as the Blu-Ray costs less than the DVD!

I find the Scary Movie series a bit on the stupid side, but it's not stupid stupid, but rather, stupid funny or stupid to be funny.  It's only worth it to watch this though if you have seen the movies that they make fun of.  As it is a spoof, and it's funnier if you know what it is playing a spoof on.

Perhaps this is a case of a film being directed at a target audience that is well outside my own demographic, assuming, of course, that the target audience is fart-joke fourteen-year-olds who find boobies hilarious and fascinating.

Rude and crude, a true ""nothing is sacred"" film which offers next to nothing to justify its cheap tricks, and cheaper punchlines. The references to other films are noticeable, but so what? They're not noteworthy, and carry little weight except to suggest that the Wayans brothers watch too many videos and have appropriated too many scenes from what were pretty dull movies to begin with to no purpose other than to make reference to those other films. Some of the references even serve, by their contrast, to remind us of how truly awful this film is, such as the allusion to the final scene in ""The Usual Suspects"".

How sad that undeniable comedic talent such as has been demonstrated by the Wayans' has been co-opted in the service of such tasteless unfunny dreck. How uninspired does one have to be to make cheap jokes about a ""retard"" (their term, not mine!) who craps his drawers...?

1380895,3,B00004Z4WQ,"SCARY MOVIE is the first and some might say the best in the SCARY MOVIE franchise. SCARY MOVIE 5 was recently released so the franchise lives on. The original SCARY MOVIE was funny stuff when it was released in 2000--a humorous parody of recent horror movies. Much of the movie focused on SCREAM, especially the murderous villain. A group of over-developed high school students are being stalked by the killer. There is also a take on I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and a few other films but a parody of SCREAM seems to be the main focus here.

Horror movies, especially those of the past 20 years or so, tend to follow a varied version of the same storyline. SCARY MOVIE reminds us that we usually know what is going to happen to our teenagers and one female lead is the main target. SCARY MOVIE takes the predictable to the absurd level.

No doubt one of the funniest aspects is that the hooded villain's white face mask changes expressions to fit what is happening. He even gets invited over to party with some guys. Could it get more silly?

As the years have passed, some of the references to specific movies may have faded in people's memories though since we have the constant storylines in horror/slasher films, the references are not lost. Sadly, what was a silly slasher scene in a movie theater now has new meaning after recent events. The silly scene can no longer be funny.

SCARY MOVIE probably will be more enjoyable to people who remember seeing it when it was originally in the theaters..when the world was kinder and less tense. Things have changed through the years and some of the violence being joked about no longer can be looked at as absurd humor.",1366156800,,1672,4.5633333333333335

1380907,5,B00004Z4WQ,"It isn't often that a movie mines a vein of obvious jokes and makes them hilarious. ""Scary Movie's charm is that it mines the horror genre - not usually a place for laughs, and relentlessly pokes fun at the genre's absurdities and silly, stock characters. There's the school beauty, played by Carmen Electra, who finds herself pursued by a knife wielding maniac while home alone at night. Of course, the house is made almost completely of glass, making her ludicrously visible to the attacker lurking outside. When she escapes the killer, she encounters two signs pointing in opposite directions -- ""Safety"" and ""Death."" You don't have to be Houdini to know which direction she picks.

But there's lots more! The film takes another of the genre's tropes - the virgin couple desperate to get it on - and runs with it. There is no way to discuss the hilarity, but it involves an electrified chastity belt, barbed wire, safety goggles, a chain saw and a geyser of...well, watch the film! There are jokes on pot-smoking, breast implants, gay panic, guilt over past misdeeds, the Matrix and much more. Not being a big horror fan, I was worried that I wouldn't get the references to horror films. But I needn't have worried. The film is terrifically funny, even if you are only vaguely familiar with the genre's standard themes. For a ""dumb"" movie, the acting was first rate. Kudos especially to Anna Faris as Cindy Campbell, the cute virgin girl, who has a intelligently comic face and great timing.

""Scary Movie,"" the first installment in what has become an industry, has the purity and the fearlessness that comes from filmmakers just going for it. Not knowing whether there would be sequels, they make a film that is as funny as it can be made.

I first saw the movie when I was at home mad. I had never seen the movie so I decided to watch it, the movie made my day turn from mad to great.

The movie was made in 2001. It is just a reacted movie of Scream that was made funny. They turned a horror film into a comedy. This makes the movie a lot funnier after you have seen the horror film and then you watch the comedy version.

The movie scary movie is full of humor. There is a huge emphasis on how the characters look the same as the characters from the real movie scream.

Second, Scary movie packed the movie with actors I like. They make the movie way more interesting. It also is rumored to be the best scary movie out of the other three.

Finally the movie is very easy to understand and easy to get to play. All you have to have is a DVD player that works and a TV. Unless, You are lucky enough to catch it on Satellite.

The movie is very short. All of the comedy that is in it makes the movie fly by. It isn't but like a hour and twenty minutes long but seems way shorter. This may make it seem like a waste of money.

If you are looking for a great humor movie, Scary Movie is the way to go. I just about guarantee you will love it.",1333497600,,1439,3.9075342465753424

This film is the first in a series in which the producers and writers mock classic horror films, but they do it in a very tasteful and caring way. Movies like ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Amytyville Horror"" are satarized and when I saw those parts of the film I was on the floor with laughter! James Woods, most notably known for his serious dramatics parts, has a small role as the exorcist in ""Scary Movie"" where he tries to exorcise the demon out of a girl. Woods scenes are the best and he steals every funny part from his co-stars. The bathroom scene where he sits on the commode is not to be missed! If your down and want to put a smile on your face put ""Scary Movie"" in your DVD player. Other sequels follwed this film, but the original is simple the best.",1278633600,2,1108,4.331730769230769
1380938,4,B00004Z4WQ,"Certainly the best in the series, this slasher film spoof is equal parts funny and scary (and gross).  With sequences that will elicit fully on barrel laughs, and maybe even some tears, as well as sequences that will turn the stomach, `Scary Movie' has enough going for it to far outweigh the films tendency to overindulge in it's own silliness.

Yes, this movie is stupid, but it balances it's intelligence with a precise humor that was kind of lost in the sequels (especially the 3rd film).

The film is an amalgam of all things `slasher', a genre that really rose to fame in the late 90's.  With throwbacks to everything from `Scream' to `I Know What You Did Last Summer', as well as a brilliant spoof in `The Blair Witch Project'; `Scary Movie' certainly makes the best use of the goods at its disposal.  Sometimes the film does tend to veer off into territory that is far too silly for its own good, but it manages to maintain a firm hold on just what is `funny', making up for its preposterousness the best way that it can.

One thing to know is that this film is ridiculously offensive (as is the 2nd one) and so the jokes, while funny, are not going to make everyone happy, so if you have an adverse reaction to stereotypical jokes done in a grossly demeaning (and perverse) way then stay far away from this one.

As far as the acting is concerned, this young cast is chuck full of talented comedians.  Even Carmen Electra surprisingly makes her `Drew Barrymore' impersonation as memorable (well, not quite AS memorable) as Drew herself.  Thankfully, they chose a real star to carry this film.  Anna Farris is hysterical, and this is the film that MADE her.  She carries all of these films (even though the films themselves become rather insulting) and her comedic timing is just impeccable.  It's easy to see, when watching this film, why she became so big and why she'll stick around for some time.  The Waynes brothers do what they do (Marlon is BY FAR the funnier one, but he knows his gimmick and takes total advantage of it), and Lochlyn Munro steals every scene he's in.

In the end, if you like the genre (parody, not slasher) then you will LOVE what is done here.  I take that back, if you love EITHER genre, you should love this film.

1380941,5,B00004Z4WQ,"First thoughts...Very good. Funny movie that rips off other movies. The main rip off movie is Scream. Nicely done movie. Let's go to the breakdown.

1.  Directing--Nice camera job from Keenen Ivory Wayans. Not too bad, but it could have improved in some areas.
2.  Script--Very well done writing job. I loved the way this movie ripped off other movies, and did a good job of it too. Nice job.
3.  Acting--Not too bad, but could have been better. You've got Anna Faris and Shannon Elizabeth.

Now for the content review.
Rated R for strong crude sexual humor, language, drug use and violence.

1.  Sex/Nudity=9/10. This movie is pretty bad on sexual jokes and actual nudity. A few scenes of male nudity.
2.  Violence/Gore=6/10. There is some violence including blood, but it is played for laughs. None of the death scenes are scary.
3.  Language=8/10. Kind of high up there. 22 F-words and other profanities.

Final thoughts...Overall 5/5. I thought it was a very funny and well done movie. Highly recommended to comedy and horror fans.",1246233600,5,1035,4.829545454545454

1380954,3,B00004Z4WQ,"Scary Movie
This movie started the idea of making parody movies. Honestly, most parody movies are horrible with a few laughs in them. It's like they are trying to hard. Scary Movie is one of the few movies that proved well done in the genre.

A serial killer who is dressed exactly like the murderer from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scream/dp/6304711875/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scream</a>&nbsp;kills a woman named Drew. The police are interviewing students to try and figure out what they can. Cindy, your main character, suddenly gets messages from the killer; this is a parody of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Know-What-You-Did-Last-Summer/dp/6305017115/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Know What You Did Last Summer</a>. Cindy and a group of friends actually killed a man and threw him in a lake exactly like I Know What You Did Last Summer. The entire story is a combination of the two previous movies, with a ton of humor thrown in the mix. The outcome is a pretty good.

The problem with the movie is that it gets old fast. After a watch or two, you won't have any plans to watch it again. Most of the comedy is stupid in a way that loses it's touch after awhile. The first watch will have you laughing your head off; a couple watches later will have you wishing you had your money back.

This movie would also be the spawn of many horrible parody movies. This includes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Date-Movie/dp/B000F9RLKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Date Movie</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Epic-Movie/dp/B000O76ZOE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Epic Movie</a>, and others.

Along with the Wayans' brand of comedy, comes an unshakeable annoyance at some of their jokes because of their juvenility. Unlike White Chicks, the Wayans show no restraint with their toilet and sexual humor in Scary Movie. Why does every joke have to revolve around sex? Are the Wayans Brothers that sexually obsessed? All in all, it's a funny picture if you can abandon your decent sensibilities for a little while and just have fun. That's what I did, and I'll not hesitate to watch it again and again.

To begin with, a lot of this humor is just too lowbrow.  I have nothing against lowbrow, but gross out jokes get old real fast, so you've got to have something else.  Unfortunately, this movie has too many one joke scenes that stretch on too long.  It's a very fine line between funny and kind of stupid, and clearly the Wayans Bros. don't always know the difference.

The other fatal flaw involves parodies.  When you make a beat-for-beat parody, you risk losing the part of the audience that hasn't seen what you're making fun of.  There were jokes here based on fads I had to strain to remember.  And we're talking about a movie made about five years ago.

The Smiley Faced Scream is definately the funniest part of the movie. He makes several appearences and never fails to make you laugh. The toilet humor and the (down there) jokes will make your head hurt...because of how hard you'll be laughing. Just think if they made a ""Scary Movie"" spoofing on Halloween, Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The acting was okay, yet it had flaws, but that made the movie better. If you are one of those people who don't like cuss words, toilet humor, (down there) jokes, and private parts of the human body being shown, stay far from this movie.

Anna Faris became a marketable star with this and nobody could have done it better.

Making fun of some of our best movies is one thing, but inspiring laughter at such things as disabled people is appalling. These movies are disgusting, lewd, and just plain bad. I am ashamed to say that I was in the same room when it was in the VCR (it was my sister's idea to watch it, and I did keep my nose firmly confined between the pages of a Stephen King book during the whole trash-watching, but nonetheless...).

Opening scene where Carmen Electra beats up the kids with a bat hits and I was thinking this movie was going to be great. I was mistaken. It was simply a quick descent from there. I'll admit. I usually laugh at things you know you shouldn't laugh at. But this movie was the most vulgar, offensive, garbage I've ever seen. When a joke was almost funny, it would get played out to death.

The Wayans always only want to have fun, and I respect comparisons to ZAZ and the Farrely's.  Aside from inspired casting (Ric Ducommun as the dad and Lochlyn Munro as the helpless cameraman), the others take this script (no doubt with loads of improv) to great levels. Anna Faris should win an award somewhere, if only because she played this whole idiot role with a straight face and ultimate conviction; she's a riot, a rare comedian who doesn't pretend to to be funny. A real natural! Regina Hall is particularly delightful when she's being intimate with Roy, but all he wants is to see her in his football outfit. The rapid-fire script adds to this when she's in the theatre and annoys everyone...my favorite was when the Pope jumps up and says ""You ruined ""Big Momma's House"" (how many people caught that?). I don't know; it's so funny ALL the time, and repeated viewings make me find new stuff to laugh at. The good looking Dave Sheridan made himself look so goofy as Doofy, and I appreciated Andrea Nemeth's performance as Heather as a direct take-off of Reese Witherspoon in ""ELECTION"", a really fine film.  Cheri Oteri, the Wayans guys, Shannon Elizabeth...all a treat. Everything about this film is a treat, if you know how to kick back and mellow.

To be sure, there are laugh-out-loud, tears-down-my-face moments that had this dude howling hysterically.  But these jokes are all-too-obvious to be considered clever, and they wear thin real fast in this film, which richly earned its R-rating.  A sample of the movies/clips that are being targeted for laughs?  ""The Matrix,"" ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Shakespeare in Love,"" and a dog-tired reinterpretation of the Budweiser ""whaaazzzup"" commerical.  Oh, I forgot about the anatomy and bodily fluids ""humor,"" too.  And for a group of allegedly heterosexual men, the Wayans brothers have a curiously strange fascination with homosexuality.  There's a subplot involving one of the characters who may or may not be gay, and while it's not bad, I'm like, ""c'mon.""  Director Keenan Ivory Wayans already ran the gay stereotype thing to the ground with the yawn-inducing ""Men on Film"" in his ""Living Color"" series. Can we move on?

This isn't the case of people not liking a movie becase it was ""too cutting edge"" or some stupid [stuff] like that. I laughed myself silly at ""Something About Mary"", ""Road Trip"", and the ""American Pie"" movies. I love ""Airplane!"" and those other spoofs. But this was not funny! This was just useless [junk]. It was exactly what a couple of 14 year old kids would write if they were ever given the opportunity to write a movie.
It takes a tremendous ammount of talent and intellegence to make a funny ""stupid"" movie. This is NOT one of those movies. It tries to make up for it's shorcomings by being shocking and gross. It fails miserably, however. It's gross just for the sake of being gross. There's no humor at all in anything that happens. This is the height of useless, gratuitous, garbage.

1381168,4,B00004Z4WQ,"When I saw Scary movie in the theater, I had some chuckles with the shock humor take on Scream but there are two scenes that were deleted and now appear in the DVD that are the BEST.
One has Shorty and his girlfriend up in the bedroom and he wants to have sex with her but she is scared with all the murders happening.  He assures her that it is okay and she inquires that if they are going to DO IT then he better have protection.  What follows is a hysterically funny sexual encounter with the two characters while they are holding guns to warn off any lurking murderer.
The second deleted scene has to do with the other Waynan's brother who has homosexual tendencies.  He is on the football field and starts yelling the Hut #s before the play but seems to like saying ""HUT 69"" over and over and over again.  These two scenes cracked me up and made the movie for me - I only wish they hadn't been cut out of the original but I am glad that they are on the DVD because they are hilarious!",1022716800,,989,4.135416666666667
1381169,3,B00004Z4WQ,"Having suddenly remembered that Shannon Elizabeth is in this movie, I decided to watch it for a second time.  I enjoyed it much more this time than I did originally.  Surely, it is incredibly stupid and rather tasteless, but there are several laughs for every grimace.  I imagine that this movie would be much funnier in a movie theater with a bunch of other people around you, but it's still a hoot when viewed solo.  Anna Farris plays her leading role well; I love her Drew Barrymore-ish mannerisms.  Carmen Electra's cameo gets the movie off and going at an appropriately funny, spoofish level, and the Wayans are as funny as ever. I love Shannon Elizabeth, but her final scene did seem a little over the top even for this kind of silly film.  For me personally, the scenes featuring the permanently doped up Shawn Wayans character are the funniest in the film, especially when the killer joins his bong party.
I enjoy trying to figure out just what is being spoofed when.  If you know nothing about the Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer movies, you almost certainly will find this film inane, but the fact is that all kinds of things are spoofed.  A horror fan such as myself can even spot some rather obscure references to such flops as Thinner.  If I live to be 100, I will still find the whole Whaaaazup gimmick hysterical.  I noticed a lot more little nuances on this second viewing, such as the names of the beers in the refrigerator, so I think the people who enjoy this movie can have some fun watching it more than once.  A lot of people will simply not like this movie; if you don't enjoy horror or juvenile humor, then you shouldn't buy it (unless you have to have it simply because Shannon Elizabeth is in it).  I dare anybody not to laugh at some point in the movie, but you probably need to have a somewhat twisted sense of humor and a natural affinity for horror in order to really enjoy yourself.

1381170,1,B00004Z4WQ,"The main problem with 'Scary Movie' is that it attempts to parody a movie that was already a parody - 'Scream'.  Whilst Scream reinvented the horror movie, 'Scary Movie' feels like a cash-in.  Indeed, even it's name is the original title for 'Scream'.  The plot is very simply: it's basically a rehash of recent horror movies, but in particular 'Scream' and 'I Know What You Did Last Summer'.  A few other spoofs are thrown in their too, such as 'Sixth Sense' and 'The Matrix', to add to the mix.
Maybe this wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't completely illogical and simply not funny.  The jokes are all as crude as they come, with sex and breaking wind seeming to be the main themes.  Although there's plenty here that might well have been a guilty pleasure every single joke is taken too far, especially an overlong death sequence where a pretty blonde girl does her best impression of Rose McGowan.  About half and hour into the movie you're already bored.  If you need to have seen the movies it spoofs then you already know the plots of them too, and as this simply apes them then there's nothing really here that will surprise you.
If you like gross-out comedy then maybe you'll like this, but American Pie and There's Something About Mary did it so much better.",1018915200,,1266,4.546255506607929

  student and part-time security guardd Doofy, the retarted deputy who's
  obviously poking fun at Dewey from Scream. He was the showstealer
  for me because all his lines were just hilarious and were delivered
  great by Dave Sheridan. Also good in their roles are Shawn
  Wayans as a gay football player who slaps the butt of each player

  film buff. Newcomer Anna Faris as Cindy gets alot of laughs as well.

There was one funny scene though: the preview for ""Amistad II"". That was great! But the disapointments in this flick far out-weigh the good. For example, instead of re-wording famous lines like ""I see dead people"", the characters just repeat them. What's funny about that? They should have said, ""I see white people"", ""I see fat people"" and screamed. ANYTHING ELSE would have been funnier than just repeating the famous lines from movies. This is one of those movies that's fun to watch just to point out all of the scenes that could have been funnier. It has value in that sense and in the sense that it should inspire aspiring film-makers. If this can become a big hit, anything can!

The script has no real direction, it just seems to be a runaway train tossing off one liners here and sight gags there. It's a rather fun ride tho. Ana Faris, as the heroine, is very appealing. I can't quite put my finger on it. ""SNL"" regular Cheri Oteri is another stand out. Shawn Wayans, who plays Ray, is very funny as a muscle bound jock who has a strong feminine side.

The main ""plot"" is a parody of a few elements from Scream, but is mostly a spoof on I Know What You Did Last Summer, but uses all six kids from the two IKWYDLS.  First mistake:  right there.  Why write a parody of I Know What You Did Last Summer?  That movie parodied itself.  So, obviously, Scary Movie comes awfully close to being devoid of a plot.

Comedy?  Well, there were some funny lines, but there wasn't really any good, solid humor in this movie.  Sure, they satired the grotesque cheap thrills of the standard horror movie, and the killing scenes gave me a few chuckles, but the movie relies too much upon dirty jokes and explicit sexual references to convey humor.  Tell me, honestly, how are explicit sexual references FUNNY?  There's absolutely no cleverness or subtlety in the jokes.  Pretty much every element in the movie is an explicit sexual reference.

No mercy?  None at all.  This movie could pass for a horror movie, though not for the violence.  No shame?  Hold on a second.  This is barely worthy of the title, ""movie.""  No sequel?  Liars.  But is anyone surprised?  Why would you trust someone who made this flick to tell the truth?

It's better to have seen those movies in order to get the snappy jokes. Scary Movie goes way over the line on sick, toilet humor. But that's ok too. The film stars Anna Faris, Jon Abrahams, Marlon Wayons, and Carmen Electra. While shameless and over the line, I found Scary Movie completely entertaining, and extremely hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing. Other films that get spoofed are The Sixth Sense, The Matrix, Baywatch, Halloween, and the Wazzuuup! commercial.
  When Drew (Carmen Electra) is brutally murdered, four teens seem to think that the murder has something to do with the person they hit, and dumped in the river last Halloween. They also seem to think the killer is among them. Soon after, Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) recieves a letter that says: I Know What You Did Last Halloween!  Later, Cindy is stalked by the killer who likes to kill, rap, and smoke pot. A truly funny movie that deserves the success that it has recieved.

1381248,2,B00004Z4WQ,"Although I could praise this film for ruthlessly taking the Mick out of every unrealistic cliche that was ever in a horror film, this watches like something a bunch of students could have made. Just as the films this is spoofing are cliched, the jokes made about them are equally cliched. Take the Naked Gun and Airplane films - the way they spoof films is that the jokes are somewhat original but more importantly, they are subtle. Remeber the scene in airplane where the pilots are talking while somebody washes the window in the background as if its a car? That uses a sense of subtlty and thought. This on the other hand relies on being stupid and blunt. Can anyone claim to find ""Whoops, I farted! I hoped you wouldn't notice!"" funny? No? Good. You now have a claim to a good sense of humour.
The overall film is a collection of scenes based on and taking the Mick out of horror films (mainly Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer, although The Matrix, 6th Sense, Blair Witch Project and a few others are used). Airplane on the other hand is relative ordinary and almost serious plot, with films being spoofed taking place around it. In some ways, you don't need to see the films to get the jokes but with Scary Movie you won't get the jokes unless you've seen the films - and even then they're not very funny. This is just not subtle whatsoever. I could have written the script, and I can't tell a joke to save my life. It lacks wit, originality, style and subtlety - everything that makes a good comedy.

It is hands down the funniest movie I have seen since SOUTH PARK. I know that wasn't exactly popular with the critics either, but I loved it. To give you a point of reference, I like a range of different styles such as low brow (Billy Madison, Slapshot, American Pie, Happy Gilmore, Austin Powers 2 etc..) classic british stuff (Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Life of Brian, This Is Spinal Tap etc..) 80's teen comedy (Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Breakfast Club, Better Off Dead etc..) Coen Brothers (Raising Arizona, The Big Lebowski, O Brother Where Art Thou? etc..) and black comedies (American Psycho, Heathers, Whiteboyz, etc..)

Only the Wayne brothers could make vicious murder hillarious.

After finishing my viewing of the movie, I checked out some deleted scenes, which were also stupid except for one. The one deleted scene that even came close to funny involved sex...between Wayans' character and a female. One would have to view the scene to know why it's the funniest one.

Despite the numerous moments of hilarity in the film, I found Wayans' exuberant over-reliance on toilet humour to be too tedious.  I, by the way, can't wait for this brand of humour to fade away.  I love low-brow humour as much as the next intellectually-stunted guy, but being crude for the sake of being crude is not the same as being crude for the sake of being funny.  For example, I am bewildered as to why anyone found the flatulence bits funny.  Maybe it could be funny if it was set-up and paid-off in a comedic situation, but flatulence by itself is not funny.  Another example: A man in denial about his sexual orientation coming across a glory hole can potentially be very funny.  However, a phallus protruding from the said hole and perforating the said man's head is not funny.  In fact, it's darn near disturbing.  And I was also bothered by all the mimicry of other movies.  They were funny when they developed naturally from the plot, but dull and stupid when they didn't.  In the latter case, those scenes mostly just sit there and preen, waiting to be acknowledged.  I realize these films are nearly impossible to make well, but maybe the reason Airplane! and Naked Gun were so successful was because their creators did not limit themselves strictly to grossing out their audience and spoofing as many films as possible.",992908800,3,1598,4.791970802919708

There really was no point to this flick, except to make fun of everyone and everything. Which is cool...but only up to a point. What I did think was cleaver was the way they named the characters. Anne Faris's  character was Cindy Campell (as in Neve Campell's character, Cindy in SCREAM) and then there was Buffy Gibnore, as in Sarah Michelle Gellar's character in I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. I also liked the part when James Van der Beek popped up in one of the sceens - that was funny. The acting was pretty well-done, too.

The Exuberant Young Cast are all Natural Born Comedians and they make the most of every joke. Their Comedic Timing is Impeccable and they Obviously don't mind poking Fun at themselves. Shannon Elisabeth proves she has More than just Looks, as she gives one of the films Best performances. Shawn Wayans also proves himself as talented (if not More talented) as his more Famous brothers.
It's not just the Young stars that Shine in the film, some of the Older Supporting cast teach the young ones a Thing or two. Rick Domecian (as Cindy's Father) can't open his Mouth without causing a laugh, and Kurt Fuller (as the Police Chief) gives the Funniest role of his Career.
The Writing is as good as Any spoof, but the Performances bring out the best in the Script.

Pesky reporter Gail Hailstorm (Cheri Oteri) is also stalking the friends. The body count begins when Drew Decker (Carmen Electra) is murdered and everybody is getting bumped off in a very stupid way.
Scary Movie is an extremely loveable film with many high-lights, including Buffy Gellar's death and a little-but-cool cameo from James Van Deer Beck from Dawson's Creek. However, the film is dumb in the spoof-way, but perhaps the Wayan's brother's needed to research horror films before jumping into spoofing Scream, because all the three Scream's are in fact spoofs themselves. Not as full on as this one, but still a spoof. However, this is a majorly enjoyable, gross-out and continuously funny film with eager performances from the cast and a script that dreams up a lot of funny ways to tease serious horror films.
It may not be for everyone, but in my opinion, horror-spoofs don't come much better than this.",985392000,,1630,4.804270462633452
1381331,5,B00004Z4WQ,"When I'm watching a comedy, I expect it to make me laugh, and if it's a good comedy, then I come out with tears in my eyes and pains in my stomach from laughing at the way it tickles me. ""Scary Movie"" is one such movie, and is, by far, one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It made me laugh in ways I never thought possible, and yes, it is overly gross and nasty, but that's just part of its good fun. The laughs keep coming, the cast knows just how to work the material, and the material itself is fall-down funny.
The plot is a mix-and-match of the teenage horror franchises that have dominated the big screen in the latter years of the last decade. It combines comedic send-ups of storylines from the ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" movies, the ""Scream"" trilogy, and ""The Blair Witch Project."" But to try and summarize it without giving it all away, a girl in the beginning gets killed while getting ready to watch a video, and the kids who knew her at school think it has something to do with the guy that they killed exactly one year ago in their car. As the bodies begin to pile up, the laughs come aplenty, and you'll find yourself laughing at every minute of it.
The plot uses a lot of gross-out jokes and toilet humor to bring out the laughs of the parodical situations, which brings the audience to a cross-roads of sorts. Either you laugh at it and enjoy it, or be grossed out by it and dislike the whole thing; with a movie like this, there's really no in between. I found myself laughing my way the entire way through, at pretty much every joke there is to laugh at. Whether it was Shannon Elizabeth incorporating her vanity and wanna-be intellectual attitudes into her role, or comic genius Cheri Oteri's hilarious portrayal of Gail Hailstorm, our favorite reporter who stops at nothing to get her story, the movie kept me entertained in a fashion and style I never thought possible.
The parodies pretty much everything you've seen and heard from the popular teen horror movies mentioned above. One scene even pokes fun at the way in which the ages of the characters of these movies do not match the ages of the actors cast for the roles. Another takes place in a movie theater, reminiscent of the opening sequence in ""Scream 2,"" only this time the girl deserves what she gets. Telling more will only ruin what has become a very popular and outrageous parody.
The cast knows what they are doing right from the get-go; they know how to work the material, and they look like they're having fun doing it, too. With the talents of John Abrahams, Carmen Electra, Shannon Elizabeth, Cheri Oteri and so many more, there is never a dull moment here; it is simply that funny!
The reason for such a short review: too many surprises to be given away if it were any longer! The movie has so many funny moments that sometimes blinking will result in something missed out on. The jokes are laugh-out-loud funny, the cast is bright and peppy, the plot is tremendously entertaining and engaging, and it just plain rocks.",985046400,6,3025,4.471971066907776
1381332,1,B00004Z4WQ,"I'm sorry but this movie is a very poor movie in my opinion. The problem lies in that they are trying to spoof so many films and in doing so they forget one thing - it should be funny!
The jokes come thick and fast, the only problem is that practically all of them are very unfunny. I can only really remember laughing one or two times but for the most part I kept on thinking that it had to get better, it's a pity it didn't, it just got worse.
The actors seemed laboured at times and the jokes might have worked if they didn't carry them on too long. I mean once you've seen the mask change to a funny face that's okay but to see the mask take on many different expression well that's going a little too far. Most of the jokes or storyline you could see coming a mile away and although that may be okay, you weren't hit with a joke or a punchline that made the obviousness of the joke worth waiting for.
It's a pity that this film failed so badly on the comedy front as it could have been so much better. After watching it all I could think of was that there was so many jokes that I had seen before and more importantly the jokes in other movies were that much better arranged.
To sum up I would rent this movie before buying it so you can judge for yourself if it's worth adding to your collection. For me I will pass as I've seen everything before and done so much better. If you are looking for a comedy film stick with Blazing Saddles, it may be old and you've probably seen it before but it's still one funny film!",984787200,7,1522,4.059800664451827

1381387,4,B00004Z4WQ,"After the huge success of ""Scream"" and other popular teen horror films, it wasn't too long for Hollywood to create a side-splitting parody of the popular movie genre with the blockbuster comedy ""Scary Movie"". A group of dim-witted teens (oddly played by actors and actresses in their 20s and 30s) are being murdered by a masked maniac. ""Scary Movie"" is a hysterical gross-out parody that ranks as one of the funniest comedies of 2000. Though I'm not a fan of teen horror movies, there are enough unforgettable and wildly entertaining comic scenes that will keep viewers laughing from start to finish. Director Keenan Ivory Wayans (Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood) has surpassed the Farrelly brothers' unique talent for crude humor with some of the most outrageous comic scenes in years. The comic cast includes Marlon Wayans (Senseless), Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie), Jon Abrahams (The Faculty), Cheri Oteri (SNL), Lochlyn Munro (Dead Man on Campus) and Carmen Electra (Baywatch).

If you're a fan of crude humor and film satire, then pick up a copy of ""Scary Movie"" on DVD. The 2000 smash hit comedy is presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD contains a sharp video transfer and a good Dolby Digital 5.1 sound. Its special features include theatrical trailers of other Dimension titles on DVD, a short 7-minute behind-the-scenes featurette and several DVD-ROM extras like screensaver, character profiles and ""Scary Movie: Guide for the Culturally Challenged"".

Why is that? First off, the previews made it seem like a Naked Gun-esque spoof, of which I am a big fan of those types of movies. Yes, it is a spoof like those kinds of movies, but more extreme. Second, after viewing it, I felt like I needed to take a shower because of all the male-organ jokes and gay references(as a straight male, I cannot take too many of those types of jokes). The other problem I had with this movie is it was pretty much the same three jokes written over and over: Girls, drugs, and small male organs.  All right, I'll admit there were a couple of funny scenes once all those jokes wore off, like the I Know What You Did Last Summer and Matrix scenes and the scene where the marijuana-smoking killer says the now-infamous ""Whassssssssuuuuuup?"" and Marlon says ""I see dead people!"", but the scene where Shawn gets impaled on a giant male organ is just too much. The best line in the whole movie is when Shawn Wayans says ""TV shows don't make people kill. Canceling TV shows makes people kill!""  Bottom line: if you want a good spoof, see the original Naked Gun or Airplane, and avoid this one. If the MPAA let this one go through, I'd hate to see what they left out of South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut.",980812800,2,1442,4.317343173431734

Except for the Ms. Mann scene, which was creepy, in a creepy sense.  There are plenty of laugh-out-loud jokes, with a few snicker ones.  So, if it is so funny, why am I giving it 3 stars?

1381397,3,B00004Z4WQ,"One of the raunchiest multi-spoofing flicks to come across the way in a long time, the Wayans brothers have surprisingly succeeded in drawing audiences in for their eye-popping sight gags and flagrant innuendo, grossing millions of dollars in the process and earning the begrudging respect of films critics everywhere. It borrows themes from quite a few blockbusters, the main ones being ""Scream"" (1 and 2 of the tiresome trilogy) and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", teen-mania slashers that were BEGGING to be satirized. It also pokes fun at the quixotic visual effects of ""The Matrix"", makes mention of the M. Night Shyamalan Oscar-starved film ""The Sixth Sense"" and borrows renowned cinematic techniques from ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""Titanic"". There are probably many more bits and pieces of other movies I've missed while watching it, but the broadly vulgar material makes it hard to recognize.
""Scary Movie"" is the athenaeum... of toilet humor carried by the no-holds-barred directorial style that the Wayans brothers offer. Some of it was almost too much to handle for certain people; they claimed that ""Scary Movie"" was hurdling the boundaries of bad taste and that the rating systems should've bequeathed unto it an NC-17 classification on account of its appalling gags and the impropriety of full-frontal male nudity... It also makes blatant jokes about homosexuality and the minorities (ex. - Anna Faris types the words ""White woman in trouble"" to hastily summon the police in an emergency).
Although we have witnessed many a character performance before from the creators of this picture, the other cast members are amusing and memorable. First off, we have Anna Faris (a blue-eyed version of Katie Holmes) portraying the crisis-ridden Sidney from the Scream films, a victim of her own stupidity. Her character is aptly named Cindy Campbell and she is the straightest performance in this movie, making the laugh quotient that much more abundant. Remember Nadia, the sexy exchange student from the teen sex farce ""American Pie""? Shannon Elizabeth is back, this time playing a complete airhead as Buffy Gilmore, a carbon copy of Rose McGowan's bimbo in ""Scream"" (and she gets slaughtered just as quickly). Dave Sheridan (a poor man's Jim Carrey) is a little tough to take at times with his overexerted and shameless interpretation of Doofy, Buffy's mentally-handicapped brother. As always, SNL's Cheri O'Teri is a riot as the Gayle Weathers replica Gail Hailstorm, the fanatical TV reporter who chews people up and spits them out without a second thought. James Van Der Beek makes an amusing cameo, but the most brazen performances come from the Wayans brothers themselves. First, we have Marlon - haven't we seen this before? He's not really an actor, although he seems to think that his doobie-smoking, low-intellect dude routine will never wear thin. He played virtually the same part in ""Don't Be A Menace To South Central While Drinking Your Juice In The Hood"". Shawn is not much more impressive (he's more annoying, in fact) except that he's more wiry here than in ""Don't Be A Menace..."". On the whole, they are virtually the same person. Their brother (and more prudent filmmaker) Keenan makes a brief cameo in the aforementioned ""Titanic"" premise.
I think what really kept this film up in the air for so long was its fearlessness and the Wayans brothers...attitude about their crass masterpiece. When making an omelette, eggs must be broken and Marlon and Shawn are gleefully chomping on the shells in the midst of their million-dollar success. For those who have a sensitive palette regarding sex, drugs and violence, this is not your taste. Seek other flavorsome fare in the PG department.

1381398,3,B00004Z4WQ,"Parody films are always a dicey venture. They're the easiest type of comedy to do, but can be the hardest to do right. SCARY MOVIE actually pulls it off, but not enough to call it a success.
 Strike One: Parodies of Slasher films are nothing new; even most slasher films tend not to take themselves seriously these days. SCREAM was one of those, practically a satire of its own origins. Since SCARY MOVIE is really only a parody of two films, SCREAM and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER (and a brief nod to... THE MATRIX and THE USUAL SUSPECTS?), this means it is partially a parody of a satire. (Quick Trivia Note: SCARY MOVIE was actually the original working title for SCREAM!)
 Strike Two: Parodies usually make fun of inherent cliches within a genre. Being essentially a parody of only two films, this translates into copying actual scenes and dialogue and twisting them for humor. Like Van Sant's PSYCHO, but with creativity.
 There is no strike three, however, as they somehow manage to pull it off with quite a few laughs.

Yes, I laughed a couple of times at this movie, but it was not easy with little girls watching the same thing.

Do make sure you know a few quick facts before you buy this though:  it is gross, I have never seen a movie before where a guy literally gets stabbed by another guy's wang.  Not only that but the constant use of extremely sickening sex jokes and the frequent male nudity almost drove me to insanity the first time I watched this flick.

1381426,3,B00004Z4WQ,"I'm hardly a fan of bathroom humour in general and watched this movie expecting to sneer at it.  But I ended up enjoying it.  Quite a bit.  It's actually nice to see a movie that's not only totally bonkers and completely no-holds-barred in its crude humour, but also has no pretenses whatsoever to being anything greater -- and therein lies the charm of Scary Movie.
The best thing about this movie is newcomer Anna Faris.  Despite the presence of comedy stalwarts like the Wayans brothers and Shannon Elizabeth (Dish Dogs, American Pie), Faris easily walks off with the movie with her Katie Holmes impression.  By taking some of the more outrageous gags seriously, Faris makes funny gags even funnier, and every time her arrow-straight treatment of scenes metamorphoses into an absurd gag, the contrast is delicious.
Most importantly, Scary Movie treats its own absurdity with a grain of salt.  Absurdity is an overused device, and many an indie film has sunk to the bottom because of self-importance and a holier-than-thou ""hip"" factor.  Scary Movie never tries to make any grand statements, and instead of trying to pretend to be a satire (eg. South Park), it is content to remain a parody and therefore is easier to warm to.  It realizes that nothing this heavyhanded can be truly satirical and succeeds by keeping its ambitions small.
My one objection lies in the amount of violence against women.  I have to admit, the funniest scene for me is the ""I'll kill you myself"" scene, but it gets to be a bit much.  Was it really necessary to see the broken leg, for example?  Or the garage-door gag, which isn't even all that funny?  Violence against women is a motif in slasher films, but in a comedy like this, too much of it adds an unpleasant tone.
The DVD edition, aside from the ability to select chapters, really doesn't carry much unless you have a DVD-ROM.  I don't, so I'm relegated to just one short, fairly obvious documentary about the concept of the movie (not great, though not bad), and some deleted scenes.  One of these is terrific, but I can't help thinking this DVD edition a little short on bonus material.

The biggest problems: (1) most of the jokes are either obvious or badly set up.  If you have half a brain you'll even predict the reference to ""Final Destination"" at the very end of the film seconds before it hits.  (2) Some of the humor travels beyond crude into the land of racism and homophobia.  Whoa, yeah, that guy gets turned on by <i>other guys!</i>  That's hysterical!

If I was writing this review for the trailer I'd give it two snaps up in a blink.

1381435,2,B00004Z4WQ,"Now here's a clever idea, a parody of a satire.  ""Scary Movie"" spends most of its time lampooning ""Scream"" which was a tongue in cheek satire of horror flicks.  It also takes pot shots at various other successful horror flicks such as ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and ""Blair Witch Project"".  Unfortunately, this film's cleverness is overshadowed by its bad taste.
This is a Wayans home movie, written by Shawn and Marlon and directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans.  There really isn't any story, just a succession of ribald skits based sometimes verbatim on various horror flicks.  In actuality, this is more of a raunchy sex farce than a horror movie.  It has a puerile sexual obsession throwing as much bawdiness as possible into every scene.  The jokes are crass and vulgar guttersnipe humor.  This is sledgehammer comedy, with everything bluntly stated and no subtlety whatever.  Though the slapstick is funny, even hilarious at times, there are so many tastelessly offensive lines that the net result is negative.  The Wayans take political incorrectness to an ugly extreme, taking the liberty of mocking just about every group possible with exaggerated stereotypes.
The acting is nothing special except for Dave Sheridan as Sheriff Doofy who is worth the price of admission.  The direction is also mundane.  I must give the Wayans brothers credit for knowing their audience.  This film is clearly targeted at the 18 to 25 demographic (in reality probably 14 to 25) and panders mercilessly to their fixations (sex, drugs and sex).  It is likely to offend the sensibilities of a large number of people, but after grossing more than $150 million at the box office, the Wayans brothers can shrug that off as irrelevant (a sequel is already in the works).
As I watched this film, I laughed hysterically in some parts and I was revolted by others.  However, since the good is outweighed by the bad, I rated it a 4/10.

Keenan Ivory Wayans is a very funny person, I remember watching In Living color, and it was hysterical.  But with Scary Movie, he seemed to forgot to add laughter to the movie.  I understand that it is a parody, but paradies can be very funny (Spaceballs) or terrible (Mafia).  Scary Movie falls into the same class as Mafia.  My biggest problem with this parody, is the fact that it is a parody of a parody.  As I recall, Scream was a parody of scary movies.  Scream pulled it off because it was a scary movie within a scary movie.  Scary Movie on the other hand, is a stupid movie within a stupid movie.

Scary Movie is basically one giant spoof of such flicks as Scream, I Know What you Did Last Summer, etc. My DVD version has been trouble free, as well. I know some others have experienced trouble with their copy. At any rate, purchase this movie, pop it in, and be prepared to laugh ( if you're not barfing)...",977875200,,806,4.38
1381497,1,B00004Z4WQ,"This movie, and the idea behind it, is the worst kind of perversion of the cinematic art. The director, Keenan Ivory Wayans claims that it is a parody of a satire. Well, why? Why would one parodize a satire?
I can understand a parody of slasher movies in general, and they were ripe for it in the 1980's. In the 90's, Scream tried to make a statement about the genre but was merely an updated version of an already played-out theme.  Scary Movie takes the genre to the next level, as a ""parody of a satire,"" and it could have been a success. The problem is that a parody shouldn't completely mirror the film it lampoons. Scary Movie so completely resembles Scream that it falls totally flat.
There were other details in modern slasher films which were more than ripe for parody, such as the silly, completely unscary costumes (raincoat, parka, fencing mask). Including other movies in the mix (usual suspects, the matrix, meet joe black- i think) was merely lazy. The worst aspect of the film, however, was probably the pacing. A combination of the sloppy direction and lazy writing made a totally confused dumping ground of a film which didn't even deserve to break even.
As a sidebar, I found the only funny jokes to be about one of the characters' latent homosexuality. From dressing his girlfriend in a men's football uniform to considering jail as a way to fulfill his fantasies, this was the only enjoyment I experienced in watching the film. Un-PC? Sure. But it ws the only time I laughed.
Sidebar 2 - This film, as many reviewers noted, deserved an NC-17 rating. God knows why it didn't get one.",977875200,14,1603,4.624561403508772

I know most new DVDs are sent to stores weeks in advance before becoming available. So between that time of delivery and being out on stands anything can happen. I could have gone with all the male private parts being seen. I also could have gone with the female gym teacher and her Basic Instinct scene. The two Marlon Wayan segments that were cut should have stayed and the gym teacher segment should have been cut. I hope you know that a network has already bought the rights to the movie.

I don't need to go over the plot, because there isn't one, and I'm sure you've already seen ""Scream"" and ""I Know..."". You don't really need to see the two to watch this one, but I'm sure it makes it 10 times funnier.
The movie opens up with Carmen Electra playing Drew (the Drew Barrymore part in ""Scream"", get it?). Drew answers the phone and starts having a small conversation with GhostFace. There was a small ""Squeek"" and GhostFace asks Drew what that noise was? She answers, ""Whoops! I farted."". You can imagine the rest from there. The movie also stars the HOT Shannon Elizabeth, Shawn Wayans and Marlon Wayans.
I haven't laughed so much from a movie in a long time! There were some GENETALIA parts in the movie which caught me by surprise. The DVD edition is pretty cool, because it shows some deleted scenes that are pretty funny. It also shows an alternate ending. It's been a long time since Keenen Ivory Wayans directed a film, so it was a joy to see him direct this one (please see ""I'm Gonna Get You Sucka!"" if you haven't already!)

I like to think that a parody should be a movie that has a plot that can stand on its own while it parodies a movie with a similar plot. This movie has nothing that resembles a plot. It literally could be chopped and hacked to pieces as it rightfully should be and most of the scenes could stand on their own as sketches, and very poor sketch comedy at best. This waste of money seems to be the brainchild of a group of so-called writers that got together and said that they were going to take scenes from Scream, and I Know What You Did Last Summer, among other recent horror movies and simply redo them in a funny way. The writers of this crap have it all wrong. You don't try to redo a scene from the exact work that you are trying to parody. What you should be trying to do is make reference to the scenes that you are parodying in something new that you have created. Watch Spaceballs, a parody of Star Wars, and you will get the idea. You break into your own story and then make comedic references to the work you are parodying. You do not redo the same exact scene and try to make it funny. It just doesn't work that way.

All the reviews that were made about this movie saying that it should have requested an x-rating are probabally right. THIS IS NOT A KID'S MOVIE! Although aimed at kids audience, kids are hardly the right audience that should be able to watch this.  If you was like me and thought the cartoon pic of a male's private anatomy was sick on South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut then you haven't seen nuthin' yet!

I didn't love this movie, although I am a fan of the spoof movies of the past.  It had alot of funny parts, but some of them were just plan stupid.  Shannon Elizabeth (of American Pie fame) gets the stupid part in the film when she is killed off. I certainly wasn't offended at this movie.  I think one needs to go into this movie completely open minded and game for anything gross and funny, at the same time.  It does have some truly hilarious parts.  I have to say that Lochlyn Munro, who plays Greg, has got to be one of the best parts of this movie. He has a great energy about him. All the actors did a pretty good job.  It isn't an oscar winning script by any means, but if you were looking for that you wouldn't be watching this.  In closing, Scary Movie is fun.

1381541,3,B00004Z4WQ,"""Scary Movie"" is getting a lot of comparisons to ""Airplane"" and its spiritual descendants, the ""Naked Gun"" movies. And while that's cleary what's intended, ""Scary Movie"" falls far short of the mark.
For one thing, the secret to the success of ""Airplane"" wasn't that every joke was a gem. Rather, the jokes came so fast and furious that you eventually found one that made you cry with laughter. And with multiple jokes a minute, that ended up being a pretty good amount of laughs.
""Scary Movie,"" though, is a Wayans brothers film, and is paced more like the superior ""I'm Gonna Get You Sucka,"" which took on the blacksploitation film genre. In both films, a great deal of time is spent recreating an authentic environment -- much of ""Scary Movie"" is shot-for-shot identical to ""Scream"" or ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" -- and inviting the audience to laugh at it. That works for ""I'm Gonna Get You Sucka"" -- the films of the 1970s were already so ridiculous that only time and distance were needed to make them hilarious -- but not so well for ""Scary Movie,"" as nothing's particularly funny about looking out of the back window of Carmen Electra's house and seeing the exact same shot of the backyard pool that opened ""Scream."" It's technically impressive, but not funny in itself.
Beyond that, the Wayans brothers this time around are obsessed with male genetalia, homosexuality and women's feelings about oral sex, with a few fart jokes thrown in. If that's the height of humor to you, grab this movie, and godspeed. But if you are hoping there's more, the bad news is that there's not much else to recommend this movie. We get some spot-on impersonations of the actors of ""Scream"" and IKWYDLS, some surprising non-horror spoofs tossed in (including one very nice one for when the real killer is revealed) and several scenes that have good shock value to them, but if you know they're coming, they're really not all that funny. (The movie theater bathroom scene parodying the opening of ""Scream 2"" could have been much funnier if the writing had actually gone farther than it did, which is unusual for a movie that doesn't otherwise ever NOT go too far.)
The biggest surprise of this movie, really, is Carmen Electra, in this film's counterpart role to that of Drew Barrymore in the original ""Scream."" For the first time ever, she shows that she can actually act. She also gleefully tears into her own public persona, from the men she ""dates"" to the secret of her career-making figure. The movie is diminished once her part ends, and -- hard to believe I'm saying this -- hopefully some director will have noticed what she does in this movie and gives her a chance to be more than a sexpot in some other film.
None of this is to say that ""Scary Movie"" is a bad movie -- my wife and I are big fans of the ""Scream"" series (well, the first two, at least), and we found this to be a fun rental -- but it just doesn't merit repeat viewings like ""Airplane,"" ""The Naked Gun"" or ""I'm Gonna Get You Sucka"" do.

1381568,3,B00004Z4WQ,"Like most movie parodies, ""Scary Movie"" starts out well then begins to head downhill as it exhausts the possibilities of its limited material.  Certainly, few genres are as rife for self-satire as the teen slasher films that have proliferated in theatres ever since the early 1980's.  Seeing, however, as even some of the earliest ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Halloween"" films seem like ancient history to today's core movie going public, ""Scary Movie"" draws upon more contemporary examples of the genre like ""Scream"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" as its source of inspiration.  In its opening stretches, ""Scary Movie"" has a great deal of fun parodying the many ludicrous conventions that have long defined these films:  the use of 30-year old actors to portray empty-headed, nubile adolescents; the heavy emphasis on teen sexuality and partial nudity; the inane actions of the killer's victims who seem to do everything possible to hurl themselves into dangerous situations; and the oh-so-predictable false scare (usually caused by a leaping cat) followed immediately by the inevitable killer's attack.
Directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans and boasting a screenplay concocted by no fewer than six (count `em SIX) writers, ""Scary Movie"" establishes a high speed rhythm and pace that the filmmakers manage to sustain through most of the film's 88-minute running time - though there is a noticeable tendency on the part of the film to lag in the last half hour.  Part of the problem could be that, as with most films made up essentially of sound and sight gags haphazardly strung together, it is inevitable that some of the bits will succeed better than others and that, as the movie rolls along, the inspiration will run a little dry and the humor will become less spontaneous and more forced.  Indeed, this type of movie genre parody has always worked best when applied in small doses on TV series like ""Saturday Night Live,"" ""In Living Color"" and even the ""Carol Burnett Show.""  Stretched out to full length, such concepts often suffer the curse of diminishing returns.
Occasionally, the screenplay edges so close to the limits of good taste that one may question whether or not the material is truly appropriate for the age group at which the movie is obviously targeted.  The crudity is actually much more comically effective when it is merely hinted at than when it is so openly spelled out and displayed.  But then subtlety is not exactly a strong suit of the straight horror movie genre either.
""Scary Movie"" is, at least, blessed with a winning, game cast made up of appropriately post adolescent actors who understand well the mannerisms and speech patterns of the stereotypes they embody.  The overall good-natured quality of the film and its fairly high laugh ratio of gems to clunkers make ""Scary Movie"" an imperfect but generally likeable popcorn entertainment.",976320000,4,2870,5.023157894736842

1381584,5,B00004Z4WQ,"Scary Movie was of the best comedies of 2000. With spoofs from movies like Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Blair Witch, and The Matrix, this film will be loved by all. The sexual content of the film makes it even funnier. (Not very explicit, shows very little).
 In the opening scene with Carmen Electra, you know this movie will be great. Shawn and Marlon Wayans did a great job putting together this film and they got the greatest cast. The whole over-all plot with Doofy is absoleutly hilarious and you'll be laughing out loud at the end of this brilliant movie.
 So, be sure to catch Scary Movie. Anybody and everybody will enjoy this spoof. Buy this DVD and enjoy.

The recipe is the same: Some gorgeous chicks and a lot of (in this case overimposed) geeks'n'psychos. Nobody, least of all the viewer, knows who does what and why, and in fact, it doesn't really matter.
A lot of this crazy humour works pretty well. Only... there's too much stupid humour about sex... and as usual, you don't SEE anything!",974851200,,551,4.575757575757576

The theater was packed with people and all of them were laughing continously. I'd definately recommend this movie as a great original comedy.  There are, however, quite a few scenes that people did find offensive.  I think that comes with the territory with trying to set the mark like the Wayans did.",974764800,2,615,4.433628318584071

Not just the horribly rendered jokes, not just the one-note abilities of the Wayans stars (in front of the camera), but in the fact that it tries to pass itself off as being in the tradition of Airplane and The Naked Gun. Gene Siskel once said that sometimes what appears to be stupid is the by product of the efforts of a great number of intelligent people. In short, the cleverness of stupidity as represented by South Park, Beavis and Butthead and Ren and Stimpy. This is none of those things. Which part was funny? The... obsessed boyfriend? The severed head still talking? Every joke is aimed directly at the lowest common denominator. And hey, if that's you, so be it. Oh and lest we forget, the rampant racism and homophobia.

It must be a male humor joke but the males in the audience didn't seem to find it funny either, probably in there for shock value.

The laughs start with the opening scene, and don't stop until the ending credits.  I hate going to see movies that show all laughs in the previews, but when you see the flick, those are THE ONLY laughs in the entire film.  This is quite the contrary.  The previews didn't do it justice, since most of the humor was aimed to adults only.  The spoofs were against some recent releases (Scream, Blair Witch, Sixth Sense, Matrix, etc.)  But don't forget the inuendoes of the ever popular Cheech and Chong!

Why didn't I like this 'spoof'? thats easy IT WASNT FUNNY!  People say AMERICAN PIE was juvenile, given that that movie was about juveniles then it was appropriate, which SCARY MOVIE isnt!  I know this is a spoof, using adults playing useless teeny boppers is part of the joke, and the continual reference to the  slasher flicks is the basis of the film, but really lets look at what they're are trying to make fun of, C'MON SCREAM is the biggest joke there is!  how can anyone make that movie stupider or funnier than it already is!  Ok Ill conceed, some parts were funny in a crude kinda way like the toilet scene with the the sports jock, but that was a cheap laugh, hardly giving us more than a shocked giggle it was seriously lacking in the HA HA category!  Im all for mindless humour but this movie goes way beyond that!
To those who haven't seen this movie, DONT!  steer clear of this poor attempt at comedy, now if you want to see some truely funny spoofs go get Blazing Saddles, Airplane, Top Secret, Naked Gun(the first one only) and Galaxy Quest, the difference is amazing!",971568000,2,1603,4.305647840531561

Although the actors in this movie (apart from Kenan Ivory Wayans) are all fresh ones, they have done a very good job and deserve an oscar!
It's about time that a horror spoof movie was made. There's already a planning for a sequel Scary Movie II.  Can't wait to see that.

Sure there may have been scenes in this film that were disturbing, but most of us caught ourselves laughing at them. This is finally a spoof that does not leave someone thinking that they could have gone a little further and really made light of a movie the way that almost all Leslie Nielson films fail to do.

Violence, Drug use, Bad language,  Retarded police officers, and even the old death by penis.  This movie is  much funnier too if you have seen Scream recently, because there are lots  of references to it and they will be funnier if you know what they mean.

I have seen Scary Movie two times and found it even funnier the second time. Director Keenan Ivory Wayans is extremely clever at what he does when he can take a really popular film like The Matrix and poke fun at it without insulting it. Keenan Ivory Wayans isn't putting these films down. He's just showing us that he is having a great time making this film.

Marlon and Shawn were the funniest in my opinion.)  This movie had scenes fimiliar to THE MATRIX, SCREAM, and I KNOW WHAT YOU  DID LAST SUMMER. It also had plot that were fimiliar to these movies. The  difference was that they were made into funny plots and scenes in the  movie. This movie took place in a small town. It is about a girl who gets  calls from someone, who she doesn't know.(Just in like SCREAM). He tells  her something about what she did last weekend. (Just like in I KNOW WHAT  YOU DID LAST SUMMER). She stars to get scared when her friends start to get  killed by someone. Throughout the movie she tries to figure out who is the  caller and the killer. Doffy who is like a kind of bumb cops istold to  protect her. At the end she does find out who the caller, but it is funny  how she found out. I was really surprised at who was the killer.

This movie has done  things that other movies has never done before in the history of film  (besides the male frontal nudity). Scary Movie is the highest grossing  ""R"" rated movie in box office movie history. The movie pulled in  over 144 million $ at the box office and only took about 12 million $ or  less to make it. It is also the largest grossing movie by an  african-american director (Keenan Ivory Wayans). I think all the success is  well due to the wayans especially after the WB stupidly canceled the Wayans  Bros. Show last year. Everything the wayans have done has been good and  successful. From I'm Gonna Git You Sucka to In Living Color to Don't Be A  Menace and everything else the wayans family has done has been highly  successful for years. It should be no surprise that Scary Movie would be a  success. The high grossing success of this low budget film generated was  total unexpected. movie reviewers however always bash this film because  there is no plot with some (male)nudity and basically because its a movie  spoof. How can you bash a movie for what it is. Its a spoof, what are they  looking for shakespeare or something. They should judge the movie  accordingly. Compared with other famous movie spoofs such as Naked Gun, Hot  Shots, Police Academy, Hollywood Shuffle, Airplane etc... it was one of the  best (if not thee best)movie spoof or movie comedy for that matter that I  have ever seen. The buttom line is when I went to see this movie I couldn't  stop laughing along with the other people packed in the theater with me  watching. I had fun watching the film and I enjoyed every minute of it.  That is watch you should feel after watching a movie everytime out. Scary  Movie practiculy cleaned house this summer at the box office only coming in  second this year behind (the much more expensive) ""Mission Impossible  II"" for the highest grossing movie of the year 2000.  From the moment  the movie starts the laughs begin until the very end when the credits are  rolling. The moment this movie is available on DVD and home video to buy  and rent all the video stores and all the blockbusters will be sold out.  The demand for this film will be very high and I can't wait to get my copy  on DVD. With the sequel coming our way next year, it looks like ""Scary  Movie"" will be a classic spoof remembered by many world wide for  years.",968112000,2,2498,4.489977728285078
1381715,3,B00004Z4WQ,"When I first heard about the concept of this movie, I thought it was a brilliant one - so many opportunites to take the piss out of all those 90's  horror flicks (and I've seen them all!)
When I saw the preview I thought  it looked crappy - a bit TOO silly.
Well the movie was better than the  preview.  It's a lot of fun, and done in the same vein as Leslie Neilsen's  Zucker-esque films, although not as successfully clever as those.  Every  little moment was created to try to be funny and crazy, so at times, it was  over-kill.
Some scenes made me just... jeez, what can I say?  How many  dickie dogs can they show in one movie?  Cindy, (who played Jan in the  Brady Bunch films), was great, as were the Wayans boys.  One of my Saturday  Night Live faves, Cheri O'Teri played Gail ""Thunderstorm"" so that  was a bonus.
It's a nice way to end and celebrate the 90's obsession with  teeny slasher films.  I loved them all, but even I can admit that now, it's  time to move on.",967766400,,977,4.1891891891891895

Ebert gave it a thumbs up said it was funny. cranky hates these types of movies but enjoyed it.... blah blah blah.... not bad reviews I guess, TIME said it was good too.  so off the SCary Movie.... (Oh yeah saw the trailer for Blair Witch 2... bought chills down my spine). well off to Scary Movie..... right off the bat it's a parody of Scream... nearly exactly the same.... with an extra fart joke here and there. hahaha the movie is gross right in the first  5 minutes .... if that grosses you out, then leave immediately... cuz it gets grosser!!!! the movie is a take on most popular movies, like I know what u did last summer, Urban Legends (I think), Scream 1 & 2, Blair Witch, Matrix and a few other movies which I won't mention. it's just joke after joke.... some work, and some don't....  the movie parodies are great... they are very perfectly timed.... my friend who was sooooo hesitant on watching it, laughed hard (the guy who told me to watch Titan AE, Gone in 60 Seconds.... ugh!)  the gross factor in the movie is UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!! if you thought, something about Mary, Road Trip or American Pie or South Park was gross. this movie is far worse~!!! I won't spoil it.... but the sexual nature of this movie is all over the place!!!! I was grossed out like twice.... which is saying a lot!!!  but all in all, if u like the Scream movies... then you'll like this.... if you can pass the gross factor.

I only wish the Wayans would of added their own NEW material. My  guess is the Wayans must have felt that the movies being spoofed were  pretty funny. I don't know what else could cause the lack of originality.  Take for example the first scene of the film. DON'T WORRY I'M NOT GOING TO  GIVE AWAY ANYTHING! It's a repeat of what's being spoofed. Then we have the  ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" spoof scene which again is a  word for word rip-off! The only NEW jokes added here by the Wayans has to  deal with farts and male genitalia! How creative!  This could of been a 4  or 5 star film but instead had little to offer. Now, don't get me wrong,  cause I admit I did laugh at the movie,but I kept thinking of what could of  been. Funny performances by Anna Faris(who's a Neve Campbell,Jennifer Love  Hewitt type), Marlon Wayans as ""Shorty"",and Shannon Elizabeth as  ""Buffy""(You guessed it,she's the Sarah Michelle Gellar of the  movie).

It's the basic plot to the Scream trilogy and I Know What You Did Last Summer, filled with toilet humor. I walked out of the move half-way through ... If someone happens to tape it for you off of the TV in about eight months, I don't even suggest watching it then.

An inventive spoof of  teen horror flicks such as 'Scream' and 'I Know What You Did Last Summer'  and blockbusters like 'The Matrix', 'The Usual Suspects' and 'Blair Witch  Project'. A very funny cast of which the Wayans Bros. stand out and Carmen  Electra is surprisingly good as she vamps it up in the beginning sequence.  Filled with lots of bathroom humor and jokes about drugs and sex. All that  and three cameos by a playful penis make you wonder hoe the film got rated  'R' in the first place. Less lively and a whole lot darker and nastier than  most other spoofs but still delivers some heavy laughs. Creative direction  by Keenan Ivory Wayans. Some of the jokes fall flat and a lot of the jokes  may insult many viewers which make this film definitely not for the  squeamish. Wayans approach to comedy is forceful and aggressive but one  can't help but laugh. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 6!",964310400,,1037,4.4

Let's get down to business: This movie was hillarious!  Lousy casting (except for Wayans who plays a terrific pothead) but bad  actors are the key to a good parody.  The plot... well, who cares about  plot, that's the reason this movie was created: Because slasher films have  no plot!  There's only one thing left to judge: The humor value.
Well,  it's rude, vulgar, obscene, and keeps you guessing how ""far"" the  movie can really take the R rating without hitting NC-17.  One way or  another, I was just about on the floor for the entire movie.  Naked Gun,  Hot Shots Part Deux, and now Scary Movie.

It has the same director  (Keenan Ivory Wayans) and the same actors (Shawn and Marlon Wayans).  It's  also got about the same level of intellect :)  While I thought they went a  bit too far with some of the sex jokes, it was still a funny spoof.  If you  haven't seen any of the SCREAM movies or I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER,  you probably won't enjoy it as much.  The opening scene with Carmen Electra  was great!
The jokes come fast and furious, so watch out.  They're piled  one on top of another.  They stuffed so much stuff into this flick, I'll  have to see it a few more times to catch everything:  SIXTH SENSE, the  ""Wassuuuuuuup! "" Budweiser commercials, AMERICAN PIE.  It was  great!
No character development, a vague plot, and tons of jokes...this  is what a spoof is all about.  If you don't like these kinds of movies  (SPACEBALLS, LOADED WEAPON, etc.), then this movie is definitely not for  you.

Scary Movie not only spoofs  hits like Sixth Sense and I Know What You Did Last Summer, it also pokes  fun at racism and bimbo-hood, albeit done in the light of humor.
To  really enjoy Scary Movie, you'd have to dispose yourself of all reason and  rationale and laugh it all down, with some popcorn and coke of course(just  make sure not to choke on it while guffawing away). The plot may be thin,  but it sure is the one of the funniest movie I have ever seen. Those in  hope of a really frightening premise would be sorely disappointed,  though.

Carmen Electra was beautiful like usual, even though her character  was short-lived. The Wayans perfectly fit the characters. There were so  many parts that I was amazed they kept in the movie, I am glad somebody  didn't try to cut them out. Too much censorship now-a-days. The movie is  not a mind challeging experience, but one you can just sit back and enjoy.  It runs less than two hours, which is nice.

The Wayans have  majorly beat the ""There's Something About Mary"" creators with the  most gross-out jokes ever displayed in a movie. Anyway, Scary Movie was a  good funny movie. The acting, for a parody, was great. And even though it  followed Scream by every scene almost, there were other movies parodied and  mentioned. For example: I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Matrix,  American Pie, The Blair Witch Project, Amistad, Shakespeare in Love, Friday  the 13th, and I even caught something that dealt with The Exorcist.

Anna Faris plays the likable protagonist; other cast members include: Jon Abrahams, Shannon Elizabeth, Dave Sheridan, Shawn Wayans, Regina Hall and Marlon Wayans. Carmen Electra appears in the prologue.

 Its interesting seeing Faris when she was so young and there are several laughs throughout, especially if you're up on 90s horror. Unfortunately, the movies ruined by constant crude, sleazy, nasty, potty non-jokes.
