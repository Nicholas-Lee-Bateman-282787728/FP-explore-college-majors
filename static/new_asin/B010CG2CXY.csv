It's no ""Killa Season"" (the greatest film in that genre) but it's cool. The rappers in the film (AZ, Charli Baltimore, Havoc, Maino) are decent actors, nice cliffhanger at the end as well. I wouldn't buy it but it was cool to watch for free",1527984000,,374,4.434782608695652

8721789,4,B010CG2CXY,"PLEASANTLY SURPRISED!!! I have to say, I didn't expect much from this movie, but I took a chance on it, and am glad I did! This isn't your normal ""I'm in the hood, and this is the only way I have to survive"" movie. The lead character has a Dad (imagine that), goes to school, etc., and although living in the ""hood"" has a chance to do other things, but he choses this route. He hustles, but at the same time, is level-headed, not the normal ""super gangster"" that some movies portray in their scripts. And even though the actors aren't known names, they do a pretty good job, definitely enough to keep you entertained. And the movie ISN'T LOADED with rappers to grab your attention and make you tune in. It's also NOT LOADED with rappers that can't act, or are out of their elements/range with the amount of time they're shown in the movie. AZ, Treach, Maino, even Vita, are in there ""just enough"" to play their characters, but not enough to irritate you. Malcolm's character, reminded me of one of my best friends. He hustled, but didn't have to. Didn't glamourize what he was doing. Sure he treated himself to some things, but that mindset of hustling, yet knowing there's an expiration date to it, made the movie stand out to me. It's more realistic. Everyone doesn't become super-thug when hustling. Some want something more, and they act on that want. If you take time to watch this movie, I believe you'll enjoy it.",1519948800,,1420,4.529182879377432
8721790,5,B010CG2CXY,"Coming from a writer's perspective, I really enjoyed and appreciated this movie, it's a true depiction of what goes on in the hood, no matter where you are from, you can relate. It was good to see some familiar faces that haven't been seen in awhile..lol! I liked the rawness, the storyline was good, very enjoyable.. Great job! Looking for part 2!",1519862400,,348,4.629032258064516

8721792,5,B010CG2CXY,"Really enjoyed this movie and thought it represented the raw and real life decisions our inner city youth must face on a daily basis.  It shows the emerging leadership skills of the character Malcolm from an early age when he recognized that a female student in his gym class was being groped by the male teacher.  As a result, he told his father who quashed the potential molestation..  We also see Malcolm using his martial arts skills he learned from his dad to defend a socially awkward student against a bully.

What stands out is that this was one of the very few positive black movies that showed unity and respect between Malcolm's parents even though they no longer were together as a couple.  They co-parented well and the decisions that they made as parents were always in the best interest of their son.

The major shift in the movie occurred when a drug pusher by the name of Jermaine, a senior transitioning out of high school, notices the skills of Malcolm and grooms him to become the next drug kingpin.  It appears that Malcolm behaves wisely, flourishes, networks, and expands the operations at a fast pace.  He has garnered the respect of those around him but comes to a critical life pivot upon experiencing the death of his confidante Ali.  With encouragement from his boss, the mayor, he attempts to live a legitimate lifestyle and is vested to make lasting changes in his community.",1510617600,,1405,4.702040816326531

8721795,3,B010CG2CXY,"This is a low budget film based on the novel by the same name. The film centers on Malcolm (Alonzo Herran JR) growing up in a split family in Newark.  His father  (Prentiss Thompson) raised him correctly and even taught him martial arts. When he becomes the new kid in school he quickly confronts a bully and becomes known. His ability attracts the attention of a drug dealer who lets Malcolm come in to the group and mentors him on taking over. With limited opportunities, this was the easy way to get money.

The low budget aspect of the film gave it choppy sound and bad shooting scenes. Alonzo Herran JR  was emotionless in his role. On the plus side, I could understand most of what was being said in the film, which may be due to its production or my watching these kind of films.  Do you feel me?

Guide: F-bomb, sex. No nudity. Large booty strippers in g-strings giving lap dances.",1435276800,2,889,4.423312883435583
