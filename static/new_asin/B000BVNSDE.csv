8093241,3,B000BVNSDE,"'THE DICKTATOR'(90 mins/Color/1976) - Starts out with some random street scenes of cars on the road and people giving speeches overdubbed with chaotic crowd noises when suddenly an angry black woman appears and makes an aggressive speech about only wanting black babies but not white ones. Then we have the 'Commander-in-Chief' in his oval office playing around with some wind-up toys and then talking on the phone with other 'world leaders' and such about the world potency problem they have because of a pill. This all leads to five still potent guys getting round up(each one code-named 'The Dicktator') and used as guinea pigs to impregnate all the willing women of the world.

'DEEP JAWS'(95 mins/Color/1977) - First scene starts with a man and a woman in the projector room with their pants down clumsily trying to get it on. We then find out that Uranus Studios is losing money so instead of making artsy movies they now decide to turn their attention to producing smut using some of that gov't dough intended for a space flight film. Some comical auditions ensue and the end result is a wacky sex orgy at a swimming pool featuring a few 'mermaid' chicks.

Extras include 'Gallery of Sexploitation Ad Art with Exploitation Audio'(15:08) and the following trailers: 'Deep Jaws'(3:24), 'The Dicktator'(3:34), 'The All-American Girl'(5:00), 'Teaser'(2:46), 'The Danish Connection'(4:30), 'Terror at Orgy Castle'(2:38), and 'Evil Come, Evil Go'(2:34). Both movies feature wacky and comical soft-core action with a very loose story-line but Deep Jaws is slightly more coherent in my opinion. And for fans of Rene Bond, she does appear in a few scenes in The Dicktator.",1426896000,,1670,5.113553113553113

8093246,2,B000BVNSDE,"""Road House"" starring Patrick Swayze is the greatest movie ever made.  Unfortunately, this review is about The Dicktator and Deep Jaws, two of the worse movies ever made.

The Dicktator is the story of a world gone mad due to overzealous population control through a male birth control pill that made men permanently lose fertility.  The Dicktators are men who somehow did not take these pills and are doing their patriotic duties one woman at a time.  The Asian Dicktator is played by a hispanic guy and one of his geisha conquests is a caucasian.  So, what happened?  Asians soft porn actors and actresses did not exist in the 1970s?  The accents of the ""foreign"" characters in the movie are awful.  The suprise ending is the US President is a robot.

Deep Jaws just as awful.  The premise of the movie is that a failing movie studio is going to use a government contract to shoot a moon landing film to finance an adult movie to save the company.  Needless to say, hilarity does not ensue.  Even burlesque star Candy Samples has performance standards and kept her clothes on the entire film.  I still don't understand the nurse, tennis player and turkey baster storyline.

The DVD extras have some redeeming value.

Each gets one star for a total of two.",1321401600,2,1257,4.65

I'm glad this is coming out on DVD, because it's nice to have a film I was in come out on DVD - but I can't honestly say I can imagine anyone thinking this is a good film.  Now if only someone would release the other cinematic materpiece I was in - ""Meateater"" - which was NOT a porn film.",1132358400,21,319,3.8181818181818183
