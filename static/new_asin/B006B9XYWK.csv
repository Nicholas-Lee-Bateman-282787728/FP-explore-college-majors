8496008,5,B006B9XYWK,"This documentary was everything I had hoped for and a bit more. I've been fascinated with Norilsk Russia for years since I first read about it. It's a mysterious, industrial, and eerie city nestled in a remote area of Siberia. Anyone who is interested in strange, off-limits places where Americans can't visit under most circumstances, check out Norilsk. I did wish there were more interviews with the citizens of Norilsk and more about their personal lives. I did learn some interesting facts about the nickel and platinum industry as well.",1400976000,,541,5.022222222222222
