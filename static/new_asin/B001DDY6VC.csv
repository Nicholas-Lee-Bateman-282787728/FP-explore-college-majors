8292950,1,B001DDY6VC,"I found the DVD to be just the opposite. Don't get me wrong, because I respect Ronnie Coleman. But for the first hour, all you do is watch him cook, eat, and take supplements, NONE of which he describes, and in fact rarely speaks at all. He takes hands full of tablets, and capsules, and not once tells you what they are. He plays video games, and barely steps into the gym. I have not taken time to watch the 2nd DVD, and can only hope it is more informative that the first one. In my collection of dozens of bodybuilding DVD's, this one is the very least helpful. I wish I could send it back.",1399420800,,594,4.129310344827586

8292952,5,B001DDY6VC,"...Ronnie Coleman being Ronnie Coleman. One of the few Kings of our sport. If you rate this video negatively, you obviously shouldn't be watching it to begin with. As a matter of fact, why don't you put down your Diet Coke and bag of Doritos and head to the gym.",1314921600,4,262,4.26
