8561318,5,B00B2AZTAI,"It's great to see more of Edward Yang's work being made readily available in the States. TERRORIZERS is dense, cerebral, and frequently beautiful, with a fair amount of the ""slow cinema"" aesthetic Yang brought to New Taiwanese cinema. It requires, and deserves, the viewers attention. A rewarding, sometimes challenging watch.",1521849600,,326,5.54
8561319,4,B00B2AZTAI,"The film itself is great, but did anyone else have issues with the subtitles? The video streaming was fine, but instead of just subtitles during dialogue I was getting subtitles for sound effects which was a little annoying because I couldn't figure out how to turn it off.",1494460800,,273,4.708333333333333
8561320,2,B00B2AZTAI,This Movie was Confusing and had little to no plot line. I even fell asleep because it was very slow moving.,1491091200,,108,4.190476190476191
8561321,4,B00B2AZTAI,"This is not a linear thriller type of movie, but interwoven stories about characters struggling to cope in urban Taiwan.  The characters are not down-and-out losers, but middle to upper-middle class people who don't know how to get their lives on track.  There is some violence depicted, but it is not about contemporary ""terrorists"".  The photography is imaginative and compelling, sometimes reminding me of approaches used by Japanese directors like Ozu. You will think about this film long after you have seen it.",1482451200,2,516,5.192771084337349
