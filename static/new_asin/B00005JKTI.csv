1441758,5,B00005JKTI,"Hours is about the profound affect that Virginia Woolf's book 'Mrs. Dalloway' has on herself, a reader, and someone who knows the reader.  This is depicted through three different periods over an 80 year stretch.  The first period takes place when Virginia (Nicole Kidman) is writing the book while going through a tough time in her life.  Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) represents the second period.  She is the reader of the book who can identify with the main character in the book.  The present time, and the third period, is embodied through Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep) who has received the nickname Mrs. Dalloway from someone who has read the book.  The cast of Hours enhances it's monumental film experience by using deep rooted dialogues tangled with periods of silence.",1043107200,4,780,5.007751937984496
1441759,5,B00005JKTI,"Three women.  Three different time periods.  Three different situations.  But yet, in some way, all are linked to the Virginia Woolf novel, ""Mrs. Dalloway"".  Each woman wakes up one morning with the anticipation of some sort of party.  There's Virginia Woolf herself in 1923, whose creativity as well as mental illness is apparent.  She's frustrated at her forced seclusion from the London she loves and is making time for her sister's visit.  There's Clarissa Vaughn, a middle-aged New York woman who is having a party for a good friend and former lover who is dying of AIDS.  And there's Julianne Moore as Laura Brown, a 1951 housewife who is planning on baking a cake for her husband's birthday.  Michael Cunningham linked all this together in the small masterpiece of a novel.  And the screenwriter, David Hare did nothing less than a brilliant job in adapting it to the screen.  I just finished reading the book and so I was particularly sensitive to the small changes, such as eliminating some of the minor characters.  But the rather introspective and sad tone of the book is still there.  And the characters spring to life in the kind of performances that will surely garner them all academy award nominations.
Nicole Kidman is cast as Virginia Woolf.  I was surprised at that because I think of her as a glamour queen.  However, for this role she wears a prosthetic nose, and her makeup gives her a sallow appearance.  She comes across as dowdy and homely and slightly insane.  And her acting is so good that I thought I was seeing the actual Virginia Woolf on the screen.  Meryl Streep is Clarissa Vaughn.  She's living with her own set of life regrets.  There's sadness beneath her veneer of the perfect hostess planning a party, and it's not a surprise when she lets it come out.  And then there is Julianne Moore cast as Laura Brown, all alone in her despondency even though she seems to have a perfect life.  Ed Harris is cast as the AIDS patient who is also going mad.  They, and the rest of the cast are some of the best actors in the business, and it really shows.
The cinematography and sets are also outstanding and the shifts between the three stories are seamless.  There will be a gesture in one scene that is picked up in the next and this kind of overlapping editing keeps the story flowing.  There's a theme of suicide throughout.  And bisexuality.  Mostly, though its about the our need for love and the choices we make about how to spend our hours.  Much of the story is painful.  But yet, its theme is universal. Highly recommended.",1043020800,28,2560,4.626666666666667
1441760,1,B00005JKTI,"Only One Hour was all I could handle before I decided ""this just isn't going to get any better,"" and headed for the lobby.
I admire all of the the actresses here. They have each been in an excellent role recently. Further, I admire Virginia Woolf, one of the pioneers of Modern literary technique. But this grumpy film about three women who are unhappy for some inexplicable reason, surrounded by their sad friends, un-understood by servants and loving husbands, relatives, children, inflicted needless cruelty on its viewers. Yes, I get the idea that they are repressed lesbians, and they may want to commit suicide over something which seems trivial to others, but did they have to be so unrelievedly grim about it?  A magnificent wallow in self-involvement. Let young people see this film only as a punishment for truly bad behavior.",1043020800,24,836,4.929078014184397
1441761,5,B00005JKTI,"An intelligent and lyrical film adaptation of Michael Cunningham's exquisite Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about the ways in which any person's life can be drastically altered during the course of a seemingly normal day.  The story cuts back and forth between three women's stories: in 1923, novelist Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) is writing her novel ""Mrs. Dalloway"" while recuperating from a mental breakdown; in 1950's Los Angeles, housewife Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) is reading Woolf's book and feeling a growing sense of desperation about her bland suburban existence; and in 2001 New York, middle-aged Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep) is planning a party to honor a dying friend (Ed Harris) who has referred to her by the nickname ""Mrs. Dalloway"" since their youthful affair many years previously.  Like Cunningham's book, the film spins all three stories simultaneously, pointing out the similarities and differences between each of the women's lives; and then finally ties all three threads together in a spectacularly clever and thought-provoking twist that reveals the larger pattern of the plot (some audiences members in the theatre where I saw the film actually gasped aloud as they began to understand).
As befits such a character-driven film, the acting in ""The Hours"" is uniformly superb.  Meryl Streep is luminous throughout as Clarissa, but particularly shines in her final scenes as she welcomes a stranger into her home; and Julianne Moore brings a fascinating combination of fragility and power to the role of the repressed Laura.  Toni Collette infuses her short scenes as Laura's friend and neighbor Kitty with a marvelous counterpoint to Moore's quiet introspection; Miranda Richardson is restrained Victorian perfection as Virginia Woolf's demure sister; and Ed Harris is achingly brilliant in the small but showy role of Clarissa's dying friend.
Among this handful of flawless characterizations, it is Nicole Kidman as Virginia Woolf who nonetheless stands out.  She completely disappears into her role; although much comment has been made about Kidman's prosthetic nose and the way it completely changes her appearance, it is not makeup alone which transforms the vivacious actress into the dowdy authoress.  Kidman uses her mouth and eyes with incredible economy: her bowed lips move without disturbing her pale, translucent cheeks; and her downturned, darting eyes communicate eloquently her character's sense of uneasy restlessness.  Kidman's Virginia seems uncomfortable in her tall body, and her voice is dangerously strained.  It's a transcendent performance, and one with which Kidman solidifies her growing reputation as one of her generation's most talented screen actresses.
The film is beautifully photographed in dark, muted hues; the sets appear just as they were described in Cunningham's hauntingly visual novel.  While Philip Glass's score is at times a bit obtrusive, it nonetheless contibutes effectively to the atmosphere of the film.  The most stunning technical achievement of the film is the wonderful costume design; clothing styles and fabrics have been painstakingly planned and executed, providing some subtle foreshadowing and highlighting of important themes and motifs thoughout the narrative.  Costumer Ann Roth should definitely find herself in the running for an Oscar, as should Streep, Moore, Kidman, Harris, director Stephen Daldry, film editor Peter Boyle, and of course, the Picture itself.  Altogether, ""The Hours"" is an outstanding film that provides an extraordinary cast ample and unique opportunities to shine, especially its formidable trio of leading ladies.",1042761600,169,3631,5.593806921675774
1441762,5,B00005JKTI,"This hotly anticipated film closely adapted from the novel written by Michael Cunningham is a triumph! The film takes place at three different times of a century. In the 1920s, Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) is living a fussy, closely monitored life in Richmond and has begun writing her novel Mrs. Dalloway. In the 1950s, Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) is a housewife in Los Angeles baking a cake for her husband's birthday. In 2001, Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep) is a New York City editor organizing a party for her old friend who just won a major poetry award. What we are given is a day in the life of each of these women. The film flips between these different points in time that are clearly demarcated by their settings. You may assume that this would make the individual stories confusing, but the women's lives are linked by various themes making transitions between them seem almost effortless. While each women is dealing with particularly difficult issues in their lives, all of them struggle with similar larger issues, primarily oppression, love and death.
This is a film about and probably for women. As Jeanette Winterson said when discussing this film, ""I am really not sure that most men have evolved far enough to spend two hours without their own company."" Of course, this is not always the case. The story is weighed down at times by morbidity. But within the context of these three women's stories, they have good reason to be thinking strongly about the possibilities of escaping these cage like identities. Traditionally for women, the only escape has been death. However, each of these women find a unique way to deal with lives they find too difficult to take. The progressive avenues of escape taken through time leaves an ultimately optimistic feeling. All three of the leading ladies deliver fantastic performances. The director Stephen Daldry focused on subtle facial and hand gestures which illuminate the internal struggles these women are facing, but are unable to speak about. They have a tremendous supporting cast with powerful performance particularly from Stephen Dillante, Toni Collette and Jeff Daniels. Each scene is emotionally carried by the powerful score of Philip Glass music. Rarely has a novel been adapted for the screen so competently. This is a beautiful, artistic film not to be missed.",1042588800,10,2337,5.025773195876289
1441763,5,B00005JKTI,"Divided into three sections, set in different eras; yet merging at times and culminating in a stunning revelation at the end, Stephen Daldry's ""The Hours"" is a serious, dramatic film about three women: all involved in someway with Virginia Woolf's ""Mrs. Dalloway."" Woolf's Dalloway is a woman who outwardly has it together but as the story unfolds we see her slowly but surely falling apart.
Daldry's film of Michael Cunningham's novel is audacious in it's physical design but more importantly in it's ability and assurance when it deals with the emotions involved with being a human being whether it be 1920's England, 1950's California or 2002 New York City.
Even though in essence, the three women in ""The Hours"" are radically different in temperament, focus and style, Daldry is more interested in what makes them similar. The three women he focuses on in ""The Hours"": Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman), Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) and Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep) are troubled in various ways but share a commonality that makes their concerns and situations Universal no matter from which era they come.
The acting in ""The Hours"" is of the highest order: natural, multi-colored and intense: Kidman, Streep and especially Moore are not only out for blood but for Truth as well. These are conflicted and conflicting characters, carefully and intelligently scripted.
""The Hours"" is a rare movie. A movie with a palpable sense and understanding of it's own world and a commitment to its characters. It is a moving experience that is not to be missed.",1042156800,11,1551,5.0625
1441764,5,B00005JKTI,"THE HOURS is one of those rare movies that tend to linger long after the movie has finished and you left the theater. Divided between three different time periods, the audience gets a glimpse of how Virginia Woolf's MRS. DALLOWAY comes to life through the generations.
Back in England during the 1920's Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) is suffering neurosis while writing the aforementioned book. One decade later in Los Angeles Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) faces the same fate as Mrs. Dalloway in addition to Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep) in Manhattan in the 21st century. At the movie's conclusion each segment unites and the three woman are confronted with the absurdity of life contained in ""the hours"" that occur when one is not being a perfect hostess, or while performing other daily distractions. Sometimes the pains of life is better left uncovered.
Some people have stated that it is better to read Virginia Woolf's MRS. DALLOWAY before watching this movie or reading the book. However, I believe it is not necessarily a requirement. You would not be lost if you have never read Virginia Woolf. THE HOURS is a thoroughly enjoyable movie. Nicole Kidman offers a spectacular performance that should be awarded. It is definately worth fighting the holiday crowds to see this film.",1041379200,24,1286,5.042253521126761
1441765,4,B00005JKTI,"I thought this was a very good movie, although it was so full of angst I also found it very hard to take.
The Hours is about three women: Virginia Woolfe (Nicole Kidman) in England during the 1920s, whose husband (Stephen Dillane) is trying to take care of her as she has had several mental breakdowns and is contemplating suicide; Laura Brown, a 1950s housewife in Los Angeles (Julianne Moore) who secretly finds life as a stay-at-home wife and mother stifling, and is not sure she can handle the responsibilities that go along with it; and Clarissa Vaughn, a present-day New York City editor (Meryl Streep) who is throwing a party in 2001 for a depressed writer Richard (Ed Harris) dying of AIDS.
The basic theme of The Hours is love and loss; how we love, take care of, and try to cheer up and help those who are so depressed and/or far gone that they can't be helped by anyone. Clarissa Vaughn tries to keep Richard (who also used to be her lover) from killing himself, Leonard Wolfe tries to do the same with Virginia, and Laura Brown's son gets distressed when his mother leaves him with a sitter so she could sneak away to a hotel all by herself and read a copy of Mrs. Dalloway, a book written by Virginia Woolfe. The Hours is about mental illness, and the different effects it can have on everyone around the person with it.
If you've had similar experiences you might enjoy and relate to The Hours very much; however, I warn you that it could also trigger painful memories. Those with such issues might want to think twice before seeing it. Children may also find it upsetting as they might not understand why Laura Brown left her son. The Hours is not a lighthearted film.
I found the acting superb; not only by Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore, and Nicole Kidman, but also the supporting cast. I especially liked Toni Collette's portrayal of Laura Brown's high-spirited best friend Kitty who has to go to the hospital and is not looking forward to it. I also felt Kate Super made a nice cynical, humourous teenage daughter of Clarissa Vaughn.
Some parts of The Hours I found very moving: the scene of Laura Brown and Kitty giggling together even though Kitty is about to tell Laura about her going to the hospital, and the scene where the Browns are celebrating Dan's (Laura's husband) birthday and Dan tells the story about how he first met Laura; that he liked her because she seemed ""so alone.""
One of the few things I didn't like about this film was Philip Glass's music, which I found too repetitive for my taste. I also found the costume design for Nicole Kidman's character Virginia a little too contrived as they made the fake nose too obvious. Of course, that's not Nicole Kidman's fault, especially since her acting was wonderful. These are the reasons I gave the film 4 stars instead of 5.",1041120000,3,2808,4.573412698412699

It had a wonderful storyline and also included my 3 favorite actresses ... Nicole Kidman, Julian Moore, and Meryl Streep.

Not knowing what the movie was about whatsoever, it was hard to try and piece it together to figure it out. I kept waiting to understand their focal point - their message. Was it about depression? Was it about happiness? Was it about mental illness? Was it about homosexuality? One reviewer wrote that Richard had AIDS. Where in the movie did they indicate that?

She portrays a truly troubled woman.  It is so different from the usual perky way she comes across.  Even is some of her darker roles her looks sort of conveyed ""perky.""
With any other cast this might have flopped horribly.  I usually don't like dark movies.  It was just so well done.  I loved the cinematography.

This story follows three women who are all connected in some way by Virginia Woolf's novel 'Mrs. Dalloway.' All three of these women live in different times; Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) lives during the early 20th Century, Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) lives in the mid-20th Century, and Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep) lives in the early 21st Century. The movie follows the tragedy of all three women and, obviously, is going to be brilliant, based on how these women are all Oscar nominated at this point and by now (February 2017) have won the coveted award. The supporting cast is just as spectacular. Miranda Richardson, John C.

1441894,5,B00005JKTI,"I rented it, watched it, and then bought it, knowing I'll need to see this sublime film once again. Like all great art, it challenges, even disturbs the viewer through a unique vision of a universal theme, Time and Death. There is nothing about this film that doesn't deserve the utmost praise: the script is an evocative adaptation of the novel, which resonates perfectly with the luminous direction and the highest order of acting from the entire cast (even the children) imaginable. Throughout, some of the finest music that Glass has ever composed haunts these visions of dark and light.

My only advice to those who haven't seen it is that it's probably best seen in solitude. This is a film that inspires meditation more than conversation. If you're ready for its message, for its probing questions of the self, you will find yourself drawn to places deep within, beyond the pale surface of ordinary life, which  are, after all, the proper destinations of every encounter with true art.",1485907200,4,992,4.863905325443787

And frankly it would be hard to say which had the best performance.  If an Oscar could be shared, these three ladies should have all received Best Actress.

I had to stop watching the movie at one point.  If you watch it, it's in the hotel room.  I just couldn't stand the thought of what I believed was about to happen.  I was deeply troubled, and in fact could not come back to the movie for two days.  I went back and forth at the thought of not even finishing it.  I'm glad that I did.

It's an eye opener in the illness of depression.  And clearly shows how difficult it is for someone who does not have it to understand someone who does.  The old cliche ""just cheer up"", just doesn't work.

This is the type of story that experienced, skilled, artists make: from the novel and screenplay and the excellent interweaving of three stories, to the top-notch performances from all three leads and the supporting cast (Nicole Kidman so transformed herself you will not recognize her), to the directing and production values.  It's a film for book lovers, and film lovers who love to be made to think.  It's also really for viewers with a little maturity/life experience, as the themes are mature and the nuances many.  Any knowledge of Virginia Woolf and her life and hardships will enhance your experience of the film, but it isn't necessary.

1442055,4,B00005JKTI,"It's a fine film, but once you have seen it, read ""Mrs. Dalloway"" if you haven't already.  The film is centered on the psychology of Virginia Woolf's mental illness and suicide.  The novel (Woolf's, not Michael Cunningham's) has its share of that but is life-centered and has its very English fascination with the shadings of English society.  That's not to diminish the film; just be aware that a different experience awaits you in reading ""Mrs. Dalloway.""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mrs-Dalloway/dp/B016RA5TO8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mrs Dalloway</a>",1454457600,,597,6.4375

1442078,5,B00005JKTI,"A wonderful movie with dialog actually worth listening to and incredible performances from almost everyone. Others have described the plot and the characters of the movie, so I will say only one more thing: I wish they had left the details of the plot (which relies so much on character) as it was in the book. Perhaps they thought they were simplifying the story of the characters played by Streep, Moore, and Harris, but I thought they actually weakened the story. If I saw just the movie, I would have been thrilled with it, don't get me wrong, it still works. But having read the book first I felt cheated and missed the depth of the twists that were taken out, which deepened and enriched the entire plot.

Spoilers: my recollection (now years after the fact so if I am remembering wrong please forgive me) is that Streep and Harris were the parents of the daughter together, and Streep had left Harris when she determined she was a lesbian but still circled in his orbit. Moore was not only an awakening lesbian in her own story but in Streep's story she had out of our view become a minor author who Streep was working to introduce, as well as being revealed at the end as Harris's mother. So Moore had left her son but they were still joined because they both had become writers. These connections tied the stories together even more tightly and reinforced some themes.",1453334400,,1377,4.574898785425101

1442083,4,B00005JKTI,"Why do people kill themselves? That is one of the central questions/themes that THE HOURS explores. Unfolding across three different time periods, this film tells the story of how the novel ""Mrs. Dalloway"" affects different women who have had to deal with suicide (or suicidal thoughts) in their lives. It stars Nicole Kidman as Virginia Woolf (who wrote ""Mrs. Dalloway""), Julianne Moore as Laura, and Meryl Streep as Clarissa. Virginia Woolf, who has some mental health issues, is mostly confined to a country home with her husband and writes ""Mrs. Dalloway"" as a way to cope with her situation. Laura is a 1950's suburban housewife who, despite her external appearance, is very unhappy with her boring life. And then there's Clarissa, who is in a committed lesbian relationship and is planning a party for her writer friend Richard, who is also dying of AIDS. All three women have similar stresses and one of the strong points of the film is the way it seamlessly moves between each time period while still telling a unified story. It also deals with some weighty themes that will give you a lot to ponder aside from the key issue of suicide. Among these are social pressures and expectations, selflessness versus selfishness, what makes a person happy, etc. The acting supporting these elements was also top-notch, as would be expected from the outstanding cast, and each of the three lead actresses gets a scene in which to shine. I should also mention Philip Glass' score, which I was actually familiar with prior to seeing the film. I felt like his music was perfectly suited to the material, accurately conveying the sense of isolation, melancholy, and ennui common to all three of the central characters. However, the film's structure is partly its undoing, although not disastrously so. A lot of the dialogue is pretty on-the-nose, and the juxtaposition of scenes basically tells the audience how they should interpret what they're seeing rather than let them figure things out on their own. Still, the repetition of key dialogue from different characters and using match cuts to transition between time periods was an effective way to unify the narrative, as well as provide needed continuity. When it comes down to it, THE HOURS is a very well-made and well-acted film that deals with heavy themes and emotions, even if in a slightly pretentious way. This isn't a film I can see watching that often, if even a second time, but the potential for discussion and/or self-assessment makes this definitely worth seeing.",1445040000,9,2525,4.971631205673759

Nicole Kidman, was an unexpected wonder. I had to back up and do a double-take. She glues this together with an unparalleled portrayal. For Kidman a smaller but integral part allowed her to stretch and show her skills. Meryl Streep is on her scale of excellence. Julianne Moore holds the balance; no small thing.
The rest of the cast had my jaw dragging on the floor and they just kept coming: Ed Harris, Miranda Richardson, Claire Danes, Toni Collette, Jeff Daniels... I'm leaving out so many and unfortunately the outstanding English actors Americans might not be familiar with who back up, The Hours. The chemistry of casting, screenwriting and direction, put Virginia on screen and wove the threads into a tapestry.  I cannot downplay Kidman's portrayal.

These are compelling women with seeming ""simple"" lives on the surface. It is not so though... They are all contemplating  their loves, pasts, presents and what is to be, as we all do. It is a movie of complex women with complex emotions and motivations. Some reviews have stated that the movie is confusing at the very least at the beginning. I am not sure why, but I think if you take each story on its own eventually you will see the marvelous interwoven plot that binds all these women. The musical score heightens the connection of these women. The costumes are on point and lovely. What can I say, I love this movie. I see myself in all the women and feel for them. If you are in the mood for a serious well done drama, please watch.

1442377,1,B00005JKTI,"Stunning production values and superb acting. Nicole Kidman sinks into her character, becoming unrecognizable in the role of Virginia Woolfe. HIstoricity and quality of writing are all superb. My problem is that I simply cannot care about the nonexistent problems of any of these women - essentially the spirit of ""Mrs. Dalloway"" is played out in three women's lives, each essentially a fragmented reflection of Virgina Woolfe's animus (or VW herself). But with all of this elegance and passionate screenplay I cannot bring myself to care about these incredibly self-absorbed, whiny, spoiled people. Being waited on by servants, doted on by adoring husbands, surrounded in luxury and surplus, they whine and complain that they don't have enough, they're not recognized enough, they're not free enough to express certain fine aspects of their sexuality or are depressed because have the possibility of youth and excess behind them. I couldn't help but become disgusted at the whining and self-obsession, cast in the mold of some kind of bon-vivant artistic spirit. Maybe, I kept thinking each and every one of these women should try it out on the streets for a year, where they can be free to express any spirit they wish. Maybe then they can see the advantage in not being a 80-year old man with no family, having to sleep under a bridge, eat food out of dumpsters, and beg for change for wine.",1407628800,8,1394,4.961538461538462
1442378,5,B00005JKTI,This was a superb movie with a plot twist totally unexpected.  Well-crafted and interwoven three stories.  Could not believe it as it unfolded.

1442383,4,B00005JKTI,"The film portrayed the difficulties of women attempting to be free, independent and self-actualized individuals, loosely based on a template of Virginia Woolf's ""Mrs. Dalloway.""  I think any woman would find something to relate to in some part of the film, depressing as it might be.  Ed Harris, Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep provide an acting tour de force, but I was not in the least convinced by Nicole Kidman as Virginia Woolf, either physically (a prosthetic nose?) or in mannerisms, the scowling look and awkward gait.  I don't blame Nicole Kidman or the writers, it seemed poor choices in casting and direction.  I think Virginia Woolf would have been quite the imperious figure, confident except when laid low by her ""fits,"" not skulking around like a pitiful child.  This portrayal really annoyed me, but to give the film fewer stars would deny the excellence of the writing and the rest of the cast.",1401840000,,911,4.8896103896103895

I did find some of the portrayed sexuality confusing at times, but this is the underlying message I think.

1442451,5,B00005JKTI,"I'm becoming a big fan of Philip Glass music, and on his web site he has excerpts from the compositions that he died for this movie.  So, I bought the DVD mainly for the music -- to see how it worked its way into the fabric of the story line.

Actually, even though this is mostly what would be considered a 'chick flick', it turned out to be a rather good movie in it's own right.  The acting is first rate, and the Philip Glass' music weaves its way beautifully throughout while complementing the different moods of each scene.  The story line was a bit difficult for me to follow -- it bounces back and forth between the actual life of Virginia Woolf, the life of the character she's wriiting about (""Mrs. Daloway""), and the life of a woman in the future who is reading about the life of Mrs. Daloway.

I would strongly recommend watching the special features presentations....especially the one that describes the actual life and upbringing of Virginia Woolf.  I found myself deeply touched when realizing what an extremely difficult and deprived life she had.....and this featurette helped me to better understand the movie itself.",1396310400,2,1136,4.712121212121212

Some of us are just born heterosexual, in fact most of us are, so deal with it!  I think it's hilarious to call this a ""beautiful film"".

Today, actors like Ed Harris, etc. think they've got it all worked out and they're ""smarter than Christians"" ever could be.

1442619,2,B00005JKTI,"This is an ambitious film--trying together the lives of three women of different time periods, all somehow relating to Mrs. Dalloway from the novel by Virginia Woolfe.  (I was reminded of ""The French Lieutenant's Woman"" also starring Meryl Streep, in which the lives of two women of different time periods are intertwined.)  It's one of those great concepts that didn't work out very well, in my opinion.  There's a lot of acting going on....Nicole Kidman, usually a fine actress,  wears a prosthetic nose and dowdy dresses and speaks in a throaty monotone which impressed a lot of people. (She won an Oscar for it) The film would have been better if we had seen some of the up side of Woolfe's character. Just the brown dumpy dress and cryptic comments didn't engage our interest. Creative genuises are interesting; mentally ill people are not.

The two women whose lives are supposedly affected by VW's novel, Mrs, Dalloway, are even less sympathetic than VW.  Meryl Streep plays a woman whose life doesn't really make sense.  She apparently had a great love affair, when she was 18 with the Ed Harris character, who was 19, one summer.  Then, for reasons no one explains both become gay, yet Streep keeps hanging on to Harris and he declares his love for her, right before he tosses himself out of his window.  This is supposed to be high drama, apparently but it's really pretentious nonsense.  The Julianne Moore character, who is a replay of the woman she played in Far From Heaven, is so vacant that, again, it's really hard to care about her.  What's her problem?  She's in love with her neighbor? she hates her husband? she can't bake cakes?  Maybe the cake thing is supposed to be telling us that she feels trapped as a 50's housewife and so she escapes on a bus to Toronto to where she finds fulfillment as a librarian?  It's not convincing, whatever the message is supposed to be. .

I usually love Meryl Streep's performances. She has the ability to disappear into her character better than almost anyone else I've seen.  But here...all I could see was Meryl emoting. It was annoyning.  Was it bad direction?  Likewise the wonderful Ed Harris. Egad!  What a waste of talent.

Many people will be impressed because they think they should be.  After all it's about Virginia Woolfe!  And it's about suffering and AIDS and suicide and women kissing and all that important, juicy stuff. Fortunately there were a number of people who saw through the nonsense and quite a few wrote some thoughtful one and two star reviews.",1375315200,3,2529,4.739130434782608

Very good acting by Meryl Streep (as usual), Julianne Moore (who, though recognized as a major acting talent, I think is actually under-rated most of the time), and especially Nicole Kidman, who in this role, is unrecognizable as herself (a-la Bobby Deniro in Raging Bull or Charlize Theron in Monster).

1442716,4,B00005JKTI,"Like many good things in life, this film isn't easy.  But like most hard things, The Hours first presents us with the difficult and then reveals a wisdom that leaves us feeling somehow better ... enriched.  Plots are sufficiently covered in many of the other reviews on this site.  Suffice to say, each of the three protagonists deals with enormously difficult circumstances, and each charts a courageous path through them in order to make life-affirming decisions to escape suffocating social conventions or deeply conflicting relationships.  Individually, these stories might have been slow-paced. But the almost seamless interweaving, together with magnificent performances, provide for more than ample momentum.  To say that The Hours is an ensemble performance would be a great understatement--more like the visual expression of a fine orchestral concert.  It will touch you more like a piece of music than a cognitive device.  The Hours may seem on the surface consumed with the dreary and morbid. But its greatest achievement is that it pierces through sad events, wrenches the viewer's heart with emotional authenticity, and delivers a vibrant, life-affirming message.  There is no hot without cold, no up without down, no happiness without sadness.  Life is a thousand joys and a thousand sorrows.  And it's the experience of sorrow--the reckoning, the recovery, the personal growth--that reveals the exquisiteness of life.  It is transformative pain above all else that enriches us and makes us wise.  The Hours celebrates THAT wisdom. The viewer could be forgiven for criticizing Daldry and Hare for obscuring the message with too much sadness.  As one amazon reviewer wrote, The Hours made him want to ""rent an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie (well, almost).""  But be unflinching enough to take a closer look and see that it's a hopeful film--and film-making of ""steady tranquil compounds with the aloofness of a work of art.""",1355356800,,1934,5.298360655737705

The lives of these three women are woven together with amazing skill. The film asks if life is a distraction from suffering, is life suffering itself or is the failure to engage the lives of others the greatest suffering of all?

The performances are extraordinary and the film demands that viewers truly listen and observe to grasp great themes which are embedded on the sub atomic level of this script. Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore and Nicole Kidman each give Oscar worthy performances. The film says that for better or worse, our lives matter but choices make those lives and with them comes crushing responsibility. This is a great film and it deserves to be appreciated.

1442723,4,B00005JKTI,"Excellently acted by all three actresses. Juliane Moore shines in her role as a ""50s"" desperate housewife. Her role particularly interested me because of the similarity of the story lines with another movie she appeared in which was ""Magnolia"", which also included John Reilly who played the policeman in Magnolia and her husband in Hours. Magnolia is another screenplay that involves the lives of people and the way their paths interact. In ""Hours"" we are treated to a three generational story about how a book causes this intersection. In Magnolia we see many more intersections all leading up to an unrealistic ending (the frog shower). In comparison, Magnolia did have a somewhat happy ending. And both films left me totally satisfied.",1334102400,,739,5.115702479338843
1442724,1,B00005JKTI,"Sadly, I had a real problem with this film.  I have waited a long time to bother writing a review, because I know that my opinion is not popular.  The actressing is a big deal among my cinephile friends, and yet I'm put off by the bulk of it here.  Quite frankly, this is a result of too much being heaped upon too much without the right balance.  One reviewer stated that this should have been titled `The Insane, the Unhappy and the Confused'.  I agree with this.  I have defended Daldry's directorial aesthetic in the past, considering that I feel `Billy Elliot' a towering debut and `The Reader' to be a misunderstood masterpiece, but I cannot defend this since he does almost everything wrong here.  He can't build his tone in a way that complements the film's frames.  Instead, he meshes together a group of stories that interweave in a way that bleeds a melodramatic atmosphere with almost no point.  It doesn't feel inspired or poignant or engaged.

It merely feels sad.

The acting is stuck in the film's mood, which isn't a compliment this time.  Harris is horrific, Moore is bland, Streep is uneven and Kidman is trying way too hard (although she does fare better than the bulk of the cast).  The rest of the supporting cast is just there, although I will admit that Toni Collette and John C. Reilly make more of an impact than that the film's nominated stars.

I like depressing, and I like challenging and I love a film that digs at the darkness in our souls, but this film is just too drab for its own good.  It doesn't say enough to validate its poor thematic choices.",1327363200,16,1583,4.486013986013986

1442738,5,B00005JKTI,"There are precious few movies that are adapted from books that live up to the quality of their source material.  This film is one of those; it is as good as the Michael Cunningham novel and, in certain ways, a bit better.  The stories of Clarissa Vaughn, Laura Brown, and Virginia Woolf are intact and portrayed beautifully by Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore, and Nicole Kidman respectively, but the visual narrative of the film is able to cut between and contrast them in a way that the book could not (each chapter was given to a single character, for narrative coherence).  The other support characters are equally wonderful: Ed Harris will break your heart as the ailing Richard, it is a shame that Allison Janney and Claire Danes weren't able to have more screen time, and John C. Reilly gives a solid and likeable presence to the film's middle narrative.

If you have given up on the idea that adaptations can never be as good as the source material, give this film a chance.  It's not exactly the same as the novel (especially in its structure), but then film isn't exactly the same as a written text.  This film allows Cunningham's novel to spring to life before your eyes.

What a pleasure to hear these great actors talk about the story, their scenes, work with other actors, their impressions of the movie vs. the book, Virginia Woolf, and so much more. Each expresses great pride in her work and ""The Hours"" is definitely an amazing showcase for all of them. There's also a separate track with the director's commentary, a documentary about Woolf, shorts about Phillip Glass's soundtrack and more. The film itself is just under two hours but seems longer, and I think judicious editing could have reduced it by about 10 minutes.

1442758,4,B00005JKTI,"I loved this film, so emotionally honest and portraying the realities of these characters lives. I found it of note that they did not ever mention the well known fact that Woolf had been molested perhaps as early as six, having suffered at the hands of two step brothers.

It has been noted men in her family were needy and predatory.  Woolf herself wrote of the impact of the abuse she had suffered, she read  her paper '22 Hyde Park Gate'  to the Memoir Club and described the assaults by her half brother George Duckworth, which lasted through her adolescence and young woman hood, which had "" spoilt her life for her before it had fairly begun"".

There is much more detail on her often cruel and neglectful family etc. but the thing I have to wonder about is why there is never one mention of any of this in the movie.

I still would recommend this movie to anyone, The acting is astoundingly good.......very profound and it touches on how everyday life can be so difficult for some people.....issues about how to deal with greif, forgivness, the ability to go on with life and experience the moments of good that are around you none the less.......and the healing effect of understanding .....

The entire film is beautifully done, the actors give wonderful performances, I would say that this is the best work ever done by nicole kidman and julianne moore.

1442760,2,B00005JKTI,"Crashing bore of a movie, done with flare and with passionately exquisite acting. Moore's performance is the least interesting of the three, although her depression is probably the most familiar to us, that is, as an ill-defined form of dread and boredom, unexplained by events. Moore is good at playing stiff, somehow capturing the 50's look to perfection, but ""stiff"" is hard to dramatize effectly, so here and elsewhere Moore has established a strangely cold persona, sexless and lifeless. Streep is not depressed but is forced to suffer the company of a psychologically troubled, embittered misfit, the sort of poet-nut whom the media takes up and celebrates. Harris gives us the ""Philadelphia"" look of the aids victim, beany cap and all, but in the end it's not very interesting. No wonder he's slated to win a prize but chooses to kill himself instead. Streep looks great and dresses to the nines throughout, a classic classy New York broad, a bleeding-heart all the way. She's sucked into the loser's downward spiral and can't escape. When he goes, the audience has to hold its breath to keep from applauding. Virginia Woolf is the most compelling figure, a writer of vast and real talent who deserves one's attention. Here we get a brilliantly performed piece, a subtle,lovely depiction of a real literary star. As good as Streep's New York editor is, Kidman's Woolf is a tour de force, a dramatic treat. It may be the best thing she's ever done or likely to do. Streep, on the other hand, will surely go on to do far more interesting work.  The story is boring, filled with heavy portent. Depression is a fashionable favorite, which is why comedy is passed over by the Oscars.

The Hours was pure Oscar bait--a prestigey adaptation of an intellectual novel (see The English Patient for another) with Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep for God's sake--but beneath its pretty shell the film is pretty empty; by no means a bad film, it's a decent drama that benefited from a good marketing campaign and December release.",1233792000,2,369,5.049180327868853
1442788,4,B00005JKTI,"""The Hours"" is a beautifully crafted, thought-provoking, brilliantly acted movie.  Superlatives fail to describe this film.  It is a movie about the lives of 3 women, their depression, their choices.

Nicole Kidman is convincing as the silently tortured bi-polar Virginia Wolfe who desperately wants to be normal for the sake of everyone around her, but because of her untreated illness, cannot.  Juliann Moore is the most heart-wrenching as the mother who desperately wants to be a good mother and wife but because she is so emotionally dettached and unfulfilled in those roles, she cannot.  Merle Streep is the lesbian who plays nurse-maid to her male ex-lover now dying of AIDS.  She wants to rescue him.  She cannot.

Three actresses playing the roles of three women who are unsuccessfully playing roles and whose characters ultimately fail miserably.  Their lives are poignant: brutally so.

The poet/author, Virginia Wolfe, devoid of all hope that she can ever overcome her violent mood swings and exhausted from trying, wades into the river and drowns herself.  This is the only way she believes she can save(or free) herself and those she loves.  Juliann Moore's character commits the unthinkable act of abandoning her young son who worships her.  In her mind she is saving (or freeing) herself and those she loves. Merle Streep's character assumes the ever-busy role of ""Mrs. Dalloway""  (the character from Virginia Wolfe's famous novel).  She desperately  attempts to distract her dying ex-lover who tragically wants to die more than anything because he never could get over the crippling truth that the mother he worshipped abandoned him.

Three hurting women, much loved, who abandon those who love them.  This is a sad movie.  It is not a movie made for entertainment as much for philosophical value.  It is deep and thought provoking.  If you are not accustomed to such films or have an aversion to same, this movie is not for you.  As for me, I believe this movie is one of the greatest of all time.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is not above soul-searching and exploring the depths of the female psyche.",1225929600,5,2126,4.9772727272727275
1442789,2,B00005JKTI,"I bought The Hours for cheap, so I was impressed, and for once, ended up watching it within a couple of days of buying - not something I do often, judging by my ""to watch"" pile!

I always watch the trailers first on the DVD, if they're available. Some people disagree with this. Personally, I like doing it. Plus, I like watching the ""coming soon"" trailers too - it always gives me an idea as to what DVDs to add to my wishlist etc.

I watched The Hours with my Dad, and actually had to WAKE him up at the end - now he never falls asleep at movies. I do. What is The Hours about? Three women, with very little lives, and feeling trapped at every turn. Yes, there are also women kissing in this movie, for the guys - and girls I guess.

I didn't identify with any of the women, I found the film quite dull, and uninteresting. It had so much promise. And I couldn't handle watching Ed Harris in his role - normally I love him too!

I wouldn't recommend this movie - maybe it's because I haven't read the book, I don't know. I'd be interested in reading the book, perhaps, but I still have quite a few books on my ""to read"" list. (Stop buying books and DVDs!) I'll still keep the DVD - after all it was only cheap, and if I ever read the book, I might give it another try again.",1222819200,3,1275,4.067729083665339

Jumping between 4-5 time frames to women who you didn't know what their basic malfunction was made the movie very hard to understand. I had no clue until the credits were rolling that the one lady was supposed to be Virginia Wolfe, probably because I missed the clues. But why these woment were depressed, who was Richard and why was he in the one woman's life(Streep), were never answered. All in all it was not entertaining. Maybe if you have a degree in literature it might have made more sense, but as someone who has never read Virginia Wolfe's work (nor do I care to) it was a senseless and boring movie.

1442806,5,B00005JKTI,"Each day is connected through hours of momentums; and our non-stop thinking ushers our play. Writing-and-reading becomes an emblem to bridge these 3 women from time and space, and the story runs through a stream of their consciousness in a time warp, and a character twist (addendum).

There are 3 middle-aged women: Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) in 1928, Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) in 1951, and Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep) in 2001. They each encounter stress in life, and what is hidden is an emergence of independence as we follow the characters' lives through progressive eras.

A culmination of this film is several kissing scenes: Virginia and her sister Vanessa, Laura and her neighbor, Clarissa and Richard. The kissing, different from a sensual affection, expresses outwardly how the compassion and the appreciation are released from the one who is going through a mind-remodeling. These scenes are suppressing and passionate at the same time.

I cannot argue that this film is a tad dark and tense to an emotional sense, but a good drama with layers.
Life in part is like the flowers Clarissa uses to celebrate the party. It conveys a sense of transient beauty; time peters out, we each live in hours, critical moments of life and try to enjoy with a content from the very bottom of all our senses and decisions.

Addendum:
The story links 3 women who are related to Woolf's novel, even including Woolf herself.
Virginia Woolf was engaging a novel ""Mrs. Dalloway,"" which was read later by Laura Brown, a mother who eagers freedom herself. Clarissa resembles a modern variation of Mrs. Dalloway is a lesbian plans a party for her ex-lover-and-AIDS-poet, Richard.
Virginia and her illness can relate to Richard and his AIDS. Laura shares a character combination of Clarissa and Virginia, both strong and weak. Clarissa's care for Richard is similar to Virginia's husband, Leonard.
In a sense, it proposes metaphysically that we are poly-characters, with several shadows projected from different spotlights.",1200528000,3,2020,5.130699088145897

The movie gains a great deal from the initial confusion that the watcher has trying to relate the 3 distinct pieces together.
Stop reading the reviews, get the movie, watch it. and watch your mind piece together the 3 lives that make up the movie.

Then after it is done, watch the shovelware at the end, the special features. then go read the reviews and add your own.

spoilers:
the movie is 3 lives, twisted together by the author of the hours. Virginia Woolf as she writes Mrs Dalloway. Laura Brown as she reads the novel during her 2nd pregnancy, troubled deeply by feelings of both depression and worthlessness. And Richard Brown, her son, his friends and the last day of his life.

It is the story of 1 day in the lives of 3 people. Told in surprising detail and richness, but initially a bit confusing and demands a half an hour or so of quiet resignation to get all the pieces together.
Curiously, i found looking back at what i thought the movie was doing a nice lesson/exercise itself. The point of the movie has to do with happiness, how fleeding it is, yet how important each day is, not just in retrospect but as you are living it. In some ways it is a depressing movie, reality often is, our bad choices do haunt us for a lifetime, in other ways it is a rather uplifting movie. All in all, good movie fare, best served with a good friend and talking and thinking outloud. It is not a movie to watch by yourself, especially if you're prone to sentiment or sadness, but one where chatting during the movie is not just allowed but required.",1195776000,2,1678,4.354632587859425

My husband (he is the relative) has said as much to me, as Kidman says to her husband.  I cannot possibly phantom the depth of the pain that those with this mood disorder suffer, but it did give me a little more understanding.

Maybe my expectations were too high. No, that's not it, at all. I really didn't know what to expect.

This is three stories spun loosely into one. Set decades apart, in the 1920's, 1950's and 1990's, three women lead very comfortable but miserably unfulfilling lives. They mope about, drowning in self-pity, wishing they were happy, but doing nothing to achieve that goal. They seem to luxuriate in their own angst. Oh, sweet sorrow...

Bah! These women are largely unsympathic characters with no discernable qualities other than their deep dissatisfaction with their upper-middle class existence.

1442835,2,B00005JKTI,"The story is told in three different time periods. First is the story of Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman), a writer who feels trapped in her own mind and in the retraints of the world around her. Next is Laura Brown(Julianne Moore), a woman of the 1950s who is reading Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway. She too feels trapped in her daily life. She is a failure as a woman because she cannot do the mundane things a housewife is expected to do like bake a cake. Last is Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep) who is planning a party for her writer friend that is dying of AIDs (Ed Harris). A theme of the film besides hating life is lesbianism, a contributor to the sentiment of entrapment.

The problem with the film is that the characters are next to impossible to relate to or to sympathize with. Each of them inflict themselves with their pain. Each act with no regard for the people around them. Their problems seem whiney and selfish as a result.

Marlene Dietrich was right in her assumptions about the Academy Awards and who wins them. She claimed that when an actress played an invalid, a person with a mental illness, or an ugly person, the actress was assured an Oscar. This prediction has come true with Kidman. The extent of her performance is staring into the distance with a cigarette in her mouth and one minor outburst with her husband.

This is hardly an interesting movie; it drags slowly to peak with a predictable and forced climax. It redeems itself with wonderfully re-created historical sets and costumes.",1177027200,10,1508,4.640449438202247

For those who don't know, The Hours (in a few words) surrounds the idea of how ""Mrs. Dalloway"" effects three women's lives. Surprisingly, we even have the famed author, Virginia Woolf, as one of these three women! Now for those of you who would immediately run away and say ""Oh no, not another movie about women; sounds like Lifetime!"" I challenge you to give this one a chance. The acting is so incredible and the story is so moving that you'll be glad you sat down for two hours to watch it. As my title suggests, watching this movie a second time may not be so enjoyable. One viewing was quite enough for me. The movie has a lot going for it, seeing as it is very emotional and will keep you interested throughout. But it just doesn't need to be seen more than once.

Kidman earned an Oscar for her fragile performance of the suicidal writer. I love the scene when she tells her husband she feels suffocated and wants to go back home so she can write.

Woolf fought for her independence while dealing with the crushing over-protectiveness of her husband.  Streep's character shows that love is often ambivalent and always necessary.  Moore's character shows that mothering is a choice, not a biological mandate.  Ed Harris is brilliant as the tormented poet - a beautifully, fully realized character.  I had viewed it reluctantly, expecting a smarmy, ""girly"" flick.  Nothing of the kind.  A fabulous collaboration.  Awesome!",1163030400,3,645,5.510204081632653
1442865,5,B00005JKTI,"This is a devastating, haunting, gunshot of an emotional story. And absolutely brilliant in the process of deconstruction it forces the viewer (or reader--I found it very true to the rhythm and depth of the book) to go through in order to reach the other side.

There are moments in this film that I have thought about nearly every day since first seeing it in 2003, and it still comes up in conversation on a regular basis. I have, however, stopped recommending it to just anyone. I have found that many people are afraid to empathize with disturbed characters, or question their own morality and life choices. It is a matter of trust, I think, that when you get through it, you will have gained something of value.

Particularly poignant for me was Julianne Moore's driving away scene. I think many of us grew up with distant or unhappy parents who felt that they were trapped and stunted, who wanted to be fully present, but weren't mentally able to be because they were wrestling invisible things we couldn't understand.

I find inner journeys to be the most compelling, and being an audio learner, this was a beautiful movie to listen to as well.

I know people get aggravated when pretty girls are cast to play plainer characters, but you have to give credit to Nicole Kidman for this one. As gorgeous as she is, she has always come across to me as someone who has this sort of quiet, dark part. She certainly showed here that she can reach farther down into it than those who see her as a ""pretty girl"" alone gave her credit for.

The cinematic slicing from one storyline to the next might leave some audience members confused or distracted, but I found that it drew me into the movie, and into each of the interwoven stories.

Despite the hype about Nicole Kidman's role, Julianne Moore was the one who stole the show and ultimately, made this film so impactful. The scene where she is baking the cake is one of the most memorable scenes in cinema history.

This is not a happy movie. It will not make you feel good. Don't watch this movie if you and your date want to have a good time. Instead, watch this movie to see how a story should be told, to be reminded of the struggles we all have in life to love and be loved, and the impact the choices that we make have on those around us. This is one of the most honest movies I have ever seen and because of that, ranks as one of my top ten favorite movies of all time.",1155340800,5,992,4.2712765957446805
1442867,4,B00005JKTI,"This film genuinely surprised me, because from the outset I was determined not to like it at all and by the end of the film I was

totally absorbed in the tragic, shadowed lives of the characters, some of whom I liked, some I felt ambivalent toward, and some I loved.  If you are a fan of Virginia Woolf as a writer and have a working knowledge of her life, you'll have to put reality aside for awhile and just see her as the puppet master of this despairing symphony.

First we have perhaps the only performance worthy of the title from Nicole Kidman, probably due to heavy makeup, as the disturbed but also sharply lucid writer Virginia Woolf.  Her facial expressions, mannerisms, and overriding obsession with death bring Woolf to life.  Meryl Streep overacts a bit as the middlewoman between the frenetic lives of three troubled characters, still managing in the end to pull it off gracefully.

Ed Harris really surprised me as the sickly poet Richard, a wild product of Freudianism if ever there was one.  As with Kidman, he transcends his usual policy of turning in the same performance every film and shows he can actually act.

What frustrated me is that he is so central to the film and yet his character is underdeveloped--all we really know is that he has been in touch with suicide from a young age and that his mother opted to destroy his life rather than take her own (I guess that's women's liberation) by leaving him as a young boy and also deserting her husband, who commits the malicious crime of being banal when talking over cake about how much he loves her.

This is Julianne Moore, the most loathsome character in the whole film.  At the end they try to make her human after Richard (the famous poet played by Ed Harris and her son) jumps out a window, but it doesn't work.  She looks like an irresponsibile, cold old woman searching for a vague forgiveness she doesn't deserve.

The scenes with Woolf and her caretaker/husband Leonard are all fantastic.  This is a complex film, but I think the underlying message is that the phenomenon of suicide and similar acts that seem unconscionable are simply matters of choice.  We can take our lives, leave our loved ones, etc, at will and there isn't anything to stop us.  Torment can reach a point at which the most deeply felt instincts and values no longer matter to us.

Three lives glide gently into your mind and wrap themselves around your power of reason and your understanding that some things don't really have a reason. Relationships are portrayed like no other film has ever shown. Even the energy flowing from Virginia Wolfe as she lay by the dead bird is so powerful that I'll never forget it.

1442870,5,B00005JKTI,"Boasting an exemplary cast, purposeful direction, authentic production values, and a haunting musical score, The Hours is a sincere praiseworthy attempt to adapt Michael Cunningham's prize-winning novel to the screen. It is provocative, introspective, hopeful, and at times downright desolate. As evidenced by the opening sequence, the value of life itself is called into question and it sets the tone for the rest of the film.

The complex storyline focuses on one day in the lives of three women from three different generations. Based on a Michael Cunningham novel, ""The Hours"" combines a real life story (Virginia Woolf), a re-written one (Laura Brown's interpretation of ""Mrs. Dalloway"") and an original creation as well (Clarissa Vaughn). We get three different stories, each fascinating on its own edited together into a complex, intriguing drama that will have you in tears a couple of times before the ending credits start rolling.

What glues the stories together is ""Mrs. Dalloway"" - the book. Virginia Woolf, a suicidal author in England (1923) creates the character, the novel inspires a lonely housewife in Los Angeles (1951) and a 'trivial' 2001 New York City gay woman is called ""Mrs. Dalloway"" by her dying friend who points out the similarities between them. Later on, we find out another connection between the characters. It's clear that the thoughts that have been put into this movie go beyond the screenplay and acting. Things like the settings & clothing for each story help compile a perfect, believable plot.

However, what really left me with awe was the PHENOMENAL acting. Nicole Kidman's portrayal of Virginia Woolf that is the most mesmerizing and transforming performance in the film. She is completely submerged as the famous novelist of the early twentieth century. Her performance allows her characterization of Virginia Woolf to fully emerge. Audiences will not recognize her, nor should they.

Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore also gave impressive lead performances with memorable emotional scenes. Ed Harris, Claire Danse, John C. Riley, Alison Janney & Toni Collette all did an amazing job in this exquisite masterpiece. This movie had the BEST ensemble cast I've ever seen. Absolutely amazing.",1144022400,8,2231,5.293785310734464
1442871,3,B00005JKTI,"The closing lines of this film are a quote from Virginia Woolf where she wrote, ""To look life in the face, always, to look life in the face, and to know it for what it is.....at last, to love it for what it is, and then to put it away.""

Well, our three principle characters do look life in the face, including Woolf, but where exactly do they ""love it?"" What I saw were three women who lived desperate, obligatory lives, and who did so with a thinnest of success. One failed entirely, and one loved life - or in her case, ""chose life"" - by abandoning her world, and, most notably, her children.

My original response to this film, a movie depicting the lives of three women who must all face suicide and delve in their own personal masquerades as well as mental illnesses, was that I was somehow swept up in awe of it all. The acting was solid, the cast extraordinary, and the music was sweeping. But then I asked myself, ""So what?"" I believe the film is guilty of two things.

#1. It contradicts its point. Loving life does not equate running from it. I found the women tolerating life at best, and certainly were not adhering to Woolf's famous quote on the nature of living and loving doing so.

#2. It takes itself far too seriously. Perhaps this was the impression that Glass' score had on me when mixed with certain scenes. I can't be totally certain. But I do know that the point the film was trying to make is lost in some of the contrived themes in the film.

This film is not a total failure. Far from it, in fact. There are moments of delicacy and superb acting that are hard to find these days; however, the point of the film is largely lost by the contradictory philosophies stemming largely from Woolf herself. I also think Glass' music helped overcome many of the otherwise self-important elements. To seperate the music from this film would probably change many minds about its quality.

Just my opinion. For those of you who adore this film, you can do what you will with it.",1141603200,5,1992,4.399456521739131

Boring as it gets, the only redeeming thing you can possibly say about this film is that most of the time the cinematographer got things in focus and the actors all give good performances, as much as this yawn-inspiring story will allow.  The script would be overlong if it was just a one hour show.

The score by Phillip Glass is unremarkable except for the fact that it is totally overdone in sections (for example, when Julianne Moore's character leaves her son with someone) and tries to manipulate viewers into caring about the characters or situations, something I could just not do.

Anyone who thinks this is a fine film is mistaken.  Watch something else or go for a walk instead.  This is a turkey, gobble, gobble, gobble.  I rarely review movies, but this was so bad I felt compelled to save people from a lot of pain.  I don't mind chick flicks, but please, DO NOT WATCH THIS, unless you need a cure for insomnia.

1442885,4,B00005JKTI,"Realizing that hundreds of reviews have been written in this space, I don't know if there is much new and original that I can add.  However, what I found remarkable was the many ways David Hare's script and Roger Daldrey's direction managed to improve on Michael Cunningham's novel.  The novel, while good, was hampered by its somewhat clumsy attempt to rewrite Mrs. Dalloway.  I had the advantage of reading the novel right after reading Mrs. Dalloway, and Cunningham's novel reads as an interesting creative writing project, but a pale imitation of Woolf's stream-of-consciousness narrative technique.  The movie does a wonderful job of drawing the connections (what Daldrey calls ""leitmotifs"" in his and Cunningham's interesting commentary track) between the 3 central characters.  Daldrey's camera and Hare's script, combined with Philip Glass's score (which is so affecting it almost literally becomes a character in the story) combine to create an integrated effort of real beauty and honesty.  Daldrey's theater background allows him to do truly magical things with his actors, particularly the boy who plays Richie.  The only real criticism of the movie is that it goes for Hollywood-style dramatics in ""big"" scenes such as the Virginia-Leonard Woolf confrontation at the train station, which I think was more effectively underplayed in the novel.  Similarly, the idea that Laura Brown goes to the hotel with the intention of committing suicide is too heavy-handed compared with the more nuanced treatment of the same scene in the novel.  The little things here are done so effectively that the film maker's apparent need to give us audience-pleasing moments is a little unfortunate.  Meryl Streep's breakdown (invented by Hare) feels forced, like an Oscar clip.  The final passage, while beautifully written, is Hare's version of Woolf, which is a little audacious.  However, my relatively minor disagreements are far outweighed by the sensitivity and integrity put forth by Daldrey, Hare, Glass, and the entire cast.  The movie succeeds brilliantly in being 3 stories of depression that are never themselves depressing.  To the contrary, the movie contains an eloquent and emotionally persuasive argument for suicide as a way of living one's life with complete freedom.  It allows us to explore the remarkable notion that sadness is not only a part of life, but an experience that sharpens our appreciation for it, and its evental end.  It speaks to the sense that the experience of life can, if properly lived, reach to a place that is (in what may be Woolf's own phrase) beyond language.  The images, the music, the words, and the actors all work to get to that remarkable place.  To this extent, the movie is not only an improvement on the novel, but is an artistic and emotional triumph.",1135468800,3,2801,5.15929203539823
1442886,3,B00005JKTI,"I liked the intention of this film and, mostly, its style, but not the way the plot was executed.  I absolutely abhor period films which try too hard to be period films, and this was one of them.  The scenes with Virginia Woolf (we'll get back to Nicole Kidman later) and their extremely British actors made me feel like I was getting a bucket of 1920s England dumped over my head, and the scenes set in the 1950s did the same, hitting way too hard with the style and manners of speaking.  The only character I really liked was Virginia Woolf, and I thought Nicole Kidman did a fairly good job of subtley acting the part.  I have no idea what happened with Meryl Streep.  Her acting was way overdone.  No one actually talks like that except in a stage play.

But besides these obvious surface issues, this film seems to be an almost misogynist look at three women craving the affection of other women plus a man who most likely contacted AIDS from homosexual sex, although we're never told the whole story.  I didn't particularly enjoy this portrayal of women.  I also thought many elements of the story were implausible, although if you take it as a sort of avant-garde thing it works, as when Richard says that he wanted to write a book where everything comes together but in a different way, or something along those lines.  Well, the film nearly succeeded in doing that, I must say.  I enjoyed the final few scenes, but only because they spoke to the inner chick-flick lover buried deep inside me which I don't like to enjoy admitting exists.  I think the ending was a bit too overdramatic as well but it works for this kind of film.  Overall, I would say I liked Virginia Woolf, sometimes cared about Laura, and couldn't stand most of the scenes about Clarissa.  I liked how Virginia described herself wrestling with her demons in the dark.

1442910,5,B00005JKTI,"""The Hours"" more than lives up to its critical praise. If nothing else it is a must see for the originality of the technique. The film (and the book by Michael Cunningham) is structured around the process of linking up three stories set at different points in time. Each story concerns a woman trying to define herself, to identify what she needs, and to find a way to get it.

The 1920's story concerns Virginia Woolf's (Kidman) efforts to write her first successful novel, ""Mrs. Dallaway""; which is the story of one day in the life of a woman named Clarissa Dallaway. The story set in the early 1950's concerns a Laura Brown (Moore) who is reading ""Mrs. Dallaway"". Finally the contemporary story concerns Clarissa Vaughn (Streep) who is essentially living Mrs. Dallaway's life in modern NYC. All three performances are extraordinary in their own unique ways and there are wonderful performances from all members of the supporting cast. It is as if each member of the ensemble brought out the best in each other.

Some interesting and not always obvious things to look for as you watch ""The Hours"" are:

Each story begins with the husband/lover of each woman leading the camera to the woman. All three women are found in bed and this begins a match cut process that will repeat itself throughout the film as the director and editor work to connect and unify the three separate stories. Woolf writes: ""Mrs. Dallaway said she would buy the flowers herself"" just as Laura Brown reads that sentence and Clarissa speaks that sentence.

Kidman's Woolf is an amazing character. She is a psychological mess, making life difficult for those around her and full of torment and despair. Yet she has a subtle charm that helps you to understand why people found her fascinating.

Like ""The Big Chill"", this is an ambitious character study film with many characters. By necessity, both films rely more on behavioral language than dialogue in revealing the personality of its characters. Note Laura Brown's (Moore) neatness obsession as she readies her house and herself prior to leaving for the hotel.

Woolf began the book ""Mrs. Dallaway"" with the intention of basing it on a society woman she knew who unexpectedly committed suicide. Brown describes the book to her neighbor as: ""Oh, it's about this woman who's incredibly - well, she's a hostess and she's incredibly confident and she's going to give a party. And, maybe because she's confident, everyone thinks she's fine... but she isn't"".

At its core this is a movie about art but it is a broad definition of art, writing a book-baking a cake-giving a party. Each woman/artist is driven and frustrated by a need for unattainable perfection. There is a touch of irony to each situation. For example, Laura Brown is where she is because her husband has pulled her into the great American dream without realizing that it was the worse thing he could do to her. Although all three women love their children/child/niece, those relationships do not give them what they need.

There is a visitor and a kiss in each story central to the self-definition process each woman is going through. Virginia kisses her sister Vanessa (brilliantly played by Miranda Richardson who looks amazingly like she could have been Kidman's sister), desperately trying to force a better connection with her. Vanessa understands this, she is not shocked by the kiss but by the implication that her sister needs this so desperately.

Sophie Wyburd who plays Virginia's young niece was obviously cast for her haunting voice and her ability to display such a focused intensity. Each woman has a child picking up on their needs, which the adults around them do not seem to be aware of.

Watch the scene where Laura's husband is urging her to come to bed. Moore's voice does not betray the revulsion or the internal struggle which only viewers can see on her face. In fact at this point each woman's partner is urging her to go to bed but each must first a make choice. Then watch for the great match cut, Virginia announces that she has decided that the poet will die in her novel and they cut to little Richard lying in his bed. Moore's expression finally tells us that she has decided to leave her family. Streep's kiss signifies her recognition of the preciousness of what she still has in her life and her choice to embrace it and move forward.

Ultimately this film is about the increasing difficulty we have as we get older in making choices. This is because as we discover who we are, we also experience loss and accumulate grief over the course of our lives, becoming ever more aware of the cost of our choices. Like the Moonlight Graham character in ""Field of Dreams"" (who assumed he would have more than one major league at bat), Clarissa looks back on a short moment that she thought was the beginning of happiness and realizes that it was her only moment of actual happiness.

There are some criticisms of this film. That it is not political enough but rather is for the elite and about the elite, or conversely that it is condescending to the masses with too obvious a message told in an unnecessarily simplistic way, and finally that it is a success of structure rather than ideas. Whatever the validity of these issues, the very fact that discussions are at this elevated level is the best testimonial the film could have. My only criticism was a production design issue (young Richard gets his Lincoln logs out of a Erector Set box).

1442911,5,B00005JKTI,"A brilliant, contrapuntal cinegraphic telling of Mrs. Dalloway, as complex as the mind of the original author, Virginia Woolf, and beautifully complemented by the propulsive, minimalist music of Philip Glass.  If the viewer is unfamiliar with the original story of Mrs. Dalloway, the 1997 film version with a screen play commissioned by Vanessa Redgrave (who starred as Mrs. Dalloway) provides an ample, albeit self-conscious, rendition.",1117929600,,437,5.723076923076923
1442912,5,B00005JKTI,"When I read Cunningham's novel, I was completely hypnotized by the story and unable to put it down.  When I heard that it was being made into a film I was very skeptical as most of the novel seems to be interior monologue.  Anyway - I don't know how they did it, but they pulled it off beautifully.

Most of the success must be handed to Daldry for managing to make such an interior novel into a filmed, blended story.  An amazing feat, really.

The perfomances are all exceptional.  These are actors who understood the material and respected it.  Streep, Kidman, Reilly, Harris and Colette are just perfect.  Moore is just brilliant as Laura Brown.

This is a dark, sad melodrama- so it's not for everyone.  If that is your cup of tea, however - get it now!",1116720000,3,758,4.427536231884058

1442934,5,B00005JKTI,"""The Hours"" was simply my favorite film of 2003 and one of the best in any year for that matter. I loved, loved, loved this film. It is beautifully written and directed and so powerfully acted. The music and cinemaphotgraphy were also at its best. This film is about life; the excrutiatingly painful and confusing beauty of it and death; the fate that awaits all of us. First you have to give kudos to Michael Cunningham, the author, for writing such a unique and complex story.

""The Hours"" however is definitly not for everyone. I strongly reccomend this to lovers of pure melodrama. Many will probably wine and get turned off from the morbid and depressing issues it brings up but if you enjoy watching a realistic yet wonderfully, slightly over exaggerated woman drama. These are all complements, mind you.

As for the preformances, a view couldn't be happier. Meryl Steep is always a good, very good choice. Julianne Moore plays another over emotional role but keeps it real. Nicole Kidman--well,let's just say Oscar got it right this time; a very well deserved statue. ""The Hours"" is profoundly deep, emotional, and satisfying.",1112572800,4,1133,4.895833333333333

Since different life stories of different persons go on at the same time, I think I may have to watch carefully a few times to completely get the whole story. Some words said in the film are as beautiful as literature. It is psychological and philosophical.

I would like to warn you that there are many suicidal scenes, and death is underlining thing in this film. Just so you know in case you may want to avoid that topic certain times of your life.",1112313600,2,627,4.452173913043478

Because of the  3.5  star review, I have scanned about  100  of the more than  300  reviews of this movie and am baffled at the negative responses.

A lesbian movie ?  Did these people actually watch the movie or are they merely writing in as part of a right wing Christian campaign to discredit the movie ?

1442937,5,B00005JKTI,"I must say that I loved this movie a great deal, and I saw it at the theater 2 times, but I saw Frida 5 times. I am very pleased with the cast, art direction, director, and oringinal score. What I was trully disappointed and even upset by was that Salma Hayek lost the Oscar to Nicole Kidman who had just one third of the movie here, and Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep not only had more screen time, but were more mesmerizing. Kidman was better in her other films including The Others, Moulin Rouge, and her breakthrough To Die For. This beautiful and artsy ""heavy-duty"" drama is not going to be appreciated by anyone who has sexual phobia or unsympathetic towards depressed and tramatized characters vividly portrayed here by Ed Harris, Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore, and Meryl Streep. If you embrace this film, you will be profoundly moved. Otherwise, you'll probably end up resenting it.

Everyone in The Hours has something to do with the book Mrs. Dalloway written by Virginia Wolfe(Nicole Kidman) in the '30s of Richmond, England, and Julianne Moore  played a depressed housewife named Laura Brown living in Los Angeles in the '50s. Wolfe's book not only made an impact on Laura Brown, it also affected the lives of a the readers of modern day include Laura Brown's son Richard, a writer played by the scene-stealing Ed Harris, and his caretaker/ex-lover Clarissa Vaughan(Meryl Streep). Mrs. Dalloway is a character of good hostess, and she likes to throw parties for her friends, but ultimately neglects herself and becomes depressed. Clarissa gets nicknamed Mrs. Dalloway by Richard, because she loves to throw parties.

The three time periods and stories are not directly connected, by it serves the same purpose for the film, and it's edited meticulously along with appropriate scores that makes the film consistent. The film takes place in just one day in three different eras. It the beginning, Wolfe narratted a suicide note as she walked into a river after completing the writing of Mrs. Dalloway. Then it goes backward to early on in the day before when she was still working on the book. The three eras are inserted between each other back and forth as the day in the lives of three women progresses.

In the day of Virginia, she gets a visit from her sister(played by the mesmerizing Miranda Richardson), and her children. While she was lounging with them, her mind was in the world of Mrs. Dalloway, and her sister was overwhelmed that she's still so eccentric and unstable. Later, she attempted to ran away from her husband, because she didn't want to live in Richmond anymore, and wanted to move back to London. Her husband acused of her mental sickness.....

In the day of Laura Brown, she's heavily pregnant, and she spends the day at home with her son Richard. She reads Mrs. Dalloway, and was moved by it a great deal. She bakes a cake for her husband's(John C. Reiley) birthday with the help of Richard. Her neighbor Kitty comes over to ask her to take care of her dog when she goes to the hospital. Toni Collette is just in this one scene(about 5 mins.), and she's quite striking, especially when she engages a ""lesbian kiss"" with Julianne Moore. This moment she realized that she's so unhappy being a housewife, and wanted to end it. Later, Brown impulsively abandons Richard and proceeded a suicide attempt like the end of the book in a hotel room.......

In the day of Mrs. Dalloway/Clarissa Vaughan buys the flowers herself like Mrs. Dalloway in the book. She goes to visit Richard who's dying of AIDS, and has no desire to live any longer. The party is being put together for him to celebrate his award-winning novel based on his life, with a ""monster"" character based on his mother, but he's reluctant to go, because he didn't want anyone to see him so sick. One of Richard's ex-boyfriend(Jeff Daniel) also came to her apartment when she was preparing the food. She breaks down into massive tears when they talked about the old memories of their relationship with Richard.......

Other supporting roles are well played by Allison Janney(Clarissa's lover), Stephen Dillane(Wolfe's unconditional-loving husband), and Claire Danes(Clarissa's daughter).

I was very moved by Ed Harris role and performance. He really portrayed all the pain and sadness of someone who is dying and had been abandoned by his mother when he was a boy. The scene when he committed suicide in front of Clarissa was so powerful. Meryl Streep was mesmerizing! Julianne Moore's depressed and suicidal housewife who chose to abandon her family instead killing herself may be unlikeable, but she's more outstanding, especially her scene opposite Meryl Streep when her character aged to be an old woman. The remorse and sadness on her face was flawless. As for Nicole Kidman, the scene at the train station was her best in this movie. It was a very heavy agruement with her husband. She's very meticulous with the mannerism, even though she doesn't totally looked like Virginia Wolfe. She's captivately when her mind is doing multiple thinking. Overall, Julianne Moore's crying scenes are more compelling to watch, because she's more vulnerable of the three.",1111536000,2,5159,4.8812785388127855
1442938,3,B00005JKTI,"I'm sure I read a favorable review of ""The Hours"" when it was first released, but just my luck I chose a day and a mood that was dreary to begin with before viewing it. Whoa; big mistake! So why do I give it three stars, you ask? Simply because I think most movies are even worse somehow; too full of stereotypes and testosterone. At least ""The Hours"" is lousy in less typical ways. To put it another way, I'd rather be depressed and suicidal than blown to bits or caught up in a horrible car chase...nevertheless, it's not a choice I wish to be confronted with. So I haven't bothered to watch it in its entirety, and I don't recommend that anyone should, unless of course you happen to like utterly humorless non-stories about depressive space cadet women from various time frames of the 20th century (and just beyond).

Jack Rovello, Ed Harris' character as a child. His face carries the combination of incomprehension and intuitive knowing that young children can have.

1442942,4,B00005JKTI,"This is a beautiful piece of work, and there's much to linger in the sad interweaving of the stories of three women whose lives are not quite fulfilled, without being tragic.

Still, it does take a while to get going.  Don't put this on when you're feeling sleepy.  The Philip Glass music sets the tone-- this is all aobut mood, stream of consciousness, atmosphere; this isn't a story with a whole lot of plot.  Not that there isn't any:  it's worth hanging in there because if you do, some of the story is heartbreaking.  The little boy whose mother, in the fifties, is suicidal, calling ""mommy"" when she leaves him behind on an ""errand"" is wrenching and unforgettable.  Somehow you can see he knows somehting terrible is pending.

The DVD extra features are terrific.  Don't worry if you don't know or remember a lot about Virginia Woolf, for example; one of the extras gives you everything you need to know, and includes interviews with relatives as well as scholars.  Stephen Daldry, the director, and David Hare, the screenwriter, both come from the theatre, and to some extent their reharsal method is quaintly direct with that methodology (I'm also from theatre, and had to laugh at the thought of a film crew using set pieces and taping the floor to rehearse-- not very common in film where time is so short)-- but they are full of interesting insights.

Michael Cunningham, who wrote the Pulitzer-prize winning book on which the movie is based, is also refreshingly down to earth, practical and humble, without being obsequious in his comments.  I watched about half of the movie with the commentary on, and found it very entertaining.  It's unusual to enjoy watching the commentary of a movie you didn't intend to see again, and evidence that the commentary is worthwhile.

All of the actresses have been praised for their work, and they all deserve it:  Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore, and Nicole Kidman are all poignant and honest.  Toni Colette, as a fifties housewive struggling to remain composed, is also wonderful.",1105920000,2,2029,4.83768115942029

What did she do to her face?  Botox?  Today there is no expression in her face and her eyebrows are flat.  THAT Kidman, in those interviews is the princess we all fell in love with in film.

The performances are very powerful from the whole cast, with Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore shining the brightest. Daldry's move from stage to screen is proving to be great for film, receiving many nominations for both The Hours and Billy Elliot. He is possibly the only director that has recieved Academy Award nominations for best director for his first two movies.

The Hours may be a complicated movie, but no more difficult to understand than alot of great movies. The plot unfolds in three different people's lives during different decades. These stories interweve and you notice coincidences and connections in the characters more and more, which I will not give away. It is hard to compare this style of storytelling to other films, but It reminded me of Magnolia, although not as ambitious, and a little bit like Memento, but not backwards. These comparisons are slight, however, and The Hours is its own unique story as original and compelling as Magnolia or Memento. The movie does demand you to actually pay close attention and even figure things out for yourself, so may ot be for the casual viewer, but critisim due to the complexity of the story is fairly ridiculous when talking abut a film of such high quality and character developement.

1442968,5,B00005JKTI,"Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, The Hours, becomes a riveting film under the direction of Stephen Daldrey.  Transformed into a screenplay by David Hare, a British playwright who has won both the Olivier Award and the London Theatre Critics Award, the film features Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, and Julianne Moore as three women from three different time periods who face depression, dissatisfaction, and ultimately the option of suicide.

Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) is neurasthenic and edgy, a survivor of two suicide attempts whose misery is palpable as she writes her novel Mrs. Dalloway in rural England in 1923.  The novel, covering one day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway, raises questions about the role of women, their ability to find satisfaction in their lives, the options open to them, and ultimately what they owe those who love them as opposed to what they owe themselves.  A parallel plot concerns Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) in Los Angeles in 1951, a fragile woman who is trapped in her marriage, though her husband adores her and her young son depends on her.  She is reading Woolf's novel as an escape.  In the third plot, set in New York in 2001, Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep), lives like Mrs. Dalloway, ""always giving parties to cover the silence.""  Here the party is for a friend (Ed Harris), dying of AIDS.

Complex, both visually and thematically, the film shifts back and forth in time, driven not by plot but by characters who are desperately unhappy and looking for ways to deal with their misery, even to the point of considering suicide.  As the plots and times shift, the reader sees each woman becoming more desperate and her life becoming more fraught, until all plots intersect in the conclusion.  Cinematographer Seamus McGarvey creates stunning, overlapping motifs to unify the scenes--a scene of Clarissa getting up, becomes a scene of Virginia Woolf getting up, and morphs into one of Laura Brown getting up, with her copy of Mrs. Dalloway beside the bed.  Later, a morose Virginia Woolf stares at a dead bird, which becomes the face of Laura Brown, and then Clarissa Vaughan.

The acting is intense, as each woman faces a crisis in which suicide is considered, and there is little let-up or relief from this tension.  The score by Philip Glass adds to the disquiet and connects the three stressful plots.  Kidman, who won the Academy Award for Best Actress, plays Woolf without histrionics, while Moore and Streep show their emotions more overtly.  Powerful in its execution, The Hours tells us ""you cannot find peace by avoiding life.""  Mary Whipple",1100304000,7,2613,5.0

At the beginning of the film, each woman in the movie is suffering for life because they think they can't express their love.  And they didn't think they have a choice at the beginning.... At the end, one chooses life, one chooses death and one chooses love.  And you decide, who's right, who's wrong, who's mad!

WRONG!!!!!

I have now seen a movie which beats ""The Sound of Music"" by several miles, and which I am now similarly convinced will and can NEVER be worsted, NEVER.

And the winnah is:

THE HOURS!

I can't find the words to express how thoroughly, utterly, entirely, totally, supremely and breathtakingly BAD this movie is.  ""The Sound of Music"" had at least one redeeming spark, the song ""My Favorite Things"", which could at least be turned into a masterpiece by John Coltrane, to the extent that one can momently forget the hideous nightmare of J. Andrews and the vile kids doing it in the movie.

""The Hours"" has no redeeming features at all.  NONE.  With every scene, new depths of staggeringly bad acting, astonishingly facile dialogue and totally unconvincing characterization are achieved.  It's like a raging river of sewer that's burst its banks.  Quite compelling actually -- you can't take your eyes off it, as at the scene of a gruesome car wreck.  You keep saying:  ""No, no.  She's NOT going to say that!"", or ""No, it can't be.  She's NOT going to do it!"" -- and then they do, over and over.  They keep doing it until the end.  The astonishing thing is that all of the actors have been passably good, some brilliant, in other roles.  So they were actually MADE to stink in these ones.  How do you do that, I wonder?  How do you MAKE Meryl Streep act badly -- not just badly, but stunningly so?  Could you MAKE Horowitz play the piano that badly, or Caruso sing that badly?  Would be quite an achievement, wouldn't it?

I believe Nicole Kidman got an Oscar for this rubbish.  I think what she should have got was a 10 year suspension from all dramatic endeavours and a year's compulsory acting classes.  After they had stuck the ridiculous nose on her, the make-up people obviously told Kidman under no circumstances to exhibit any facial expression at all lest the schnoz fall off, thus upsetting the Director and messing up the schedule.

I could go on and on.  You MUST see this film if you haven't already.  Anything which reaches such limitless depths is something one has a duty to experience, no matter how painful. Sorry, but you must.",1096761600,15,2391,4.64200477326969

I didn't find the courage to watch it until recently because many of my friends either despised it or that they left the cinema early not knowing how to watch it.

I'm sure that people would appreciate the beauty of this movie would not tolerate the crassness of JackAss the movie, that's for sure!  I find the Hours akin to a musical composition; it is moving with the rhythmical precision of a well-composed piece where everything fit together nicely to give us a coherent cacophony of sound.  I find it absorbing to sit through additional features such as Michael Cunningham (the author)'s talk on this Pulitzer winning book, of how he came out with the idea of writing about the lives of three women: the author, the character, and the reader.  The talks continued about the David Hare's involvement in the script, Director's decision of the choice of his casting, the difficulty that he faced in the making of this film, documentaries about Virginia Woolf, Mrs Dalloway, the character that Virginia created.  Even the title of ""The Hours"" meant something.  Some of the things said in the movie lingered on even when the curtain drew to a close.  It's very profound when Virginia explained to her husband that sometimes, someone needed to die so that the living can appreciate and cherish their lives.  How true!  All three ladies in The Hours are deemed to be visionary, ahead of their times, not conventional in any sense of the word and because of that, their actions, things that they do are construed as out of ordinary.  As time moves on, history would judge them rather differently.  This movie is worth watching again in order to explore the many layers and depths that it contains.  For me, it's quite a journey.

As a profound meditation on suicide, ""The Hours"" is not always easy viewing. But it is also a film about the value of life and the choices we make as we go through it. It tells the story of three women who are connected through different eras. In 1923, Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) fights her inner demons while writing the novel ""Mrs. Dalloway."" Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) is a wife and mother in 1950's Los Angeles who reads ""Mrs. Dalloway"" while contemplating taking her own life. Finally in 2001 New York City, Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep) hides from her emotions while planning a party fer her dying friend (Ed Harris), much like the character of Mrs. Dalloway.

This summary may seem incredibly boring, but the movie is not. The three stories flow seamlessly in with one another, and there are a thousand tiny moments that take your breath away. The acting is a large part of the film's success. Nicole Kidman is a revelation as the tortured Virginia Woolf, and richly deserved the Best Actress Oscar that she won. Kidman disappears so completely into the character that she is nearly unrecognizable, and there is a ferocious intensity that radiates from her every glance and inflection. I'll be surprised if Nicole Kidman ever tops this performance, it's astonishing. Meryl Streep gives what is probably her best work since ""Sophie's Choice"" in 1982. Her Clarissa has tried to bury herself in work to keep from remembering that she isn't happy with her life, and Streep's scenes with Ed Harris as Richard, a poet dying of AIDS, are master classes in great acting. Julianne Moore is also haunting as Laura Brown, a housewife who is drowning in depression. In the scene where Moore leaves her son, her face quickly disintegrates into tears. It's incredible work.

Besides the three main stars, the entire cast is uniformly excellent, even in smaller roles. Ed Harris, Allison Janney, Toni Collette, John. C. Reilly, Miranda Richardson, Stephen Dillane, Claire Danes, and Eileen Atkins all are outstanding. The only exception is Jeff Bridges, who seems to think that playing a gay man means adopting a lisp and a girlish giggle.

""The Hours"" is a film that will make you think, and that requires more than one viewing to catch all of its subtleties. I cannot recommend it highly enough. It excels in every aspect of filmmaking to become something genuinely great.",1093305600,7,2735,4.8626609442060085
1442984,1,B00005JKTI,"Yes, it's an expensive cast.  Yes, it's beautifully made.  Yes, it makes an excellent job of conveying a particular mood.

The trouble is, there is no let-up from that mood.  Two hours of a downward spiral of doom, depression, angst, despair, and suicide, with no let-up at all.  With no refrain from such melancholy I was relieved when it ended - the film is lacking in contrast somewhat.

I wasn't left with anything at the end of the movie - just a desire to cheer myself up.  It didn't make me question anything and it didn't raise any issues for me.  I found it unchallenging - the only challenge was following the dense plot and the tedious, whispered monologues.

Your mother might like it - but she'll wonder what you're trying to say when you give it to her.",1091318400,31,767,4.460431654676259
1442985,2,B00005JKTI,"The Hours has some fine elements.  It's got the cream of the crop in acting talent and it's beautifully filmed - certain images will linger in your mind long after you're done watching the movie.  Of the three story lines, Virginia Woolf's was the most moving, because she had to grapple with a real mental illness (and the suicide note she wrote to her husband will bring tears to your eyes).  But in general, what I found lacking in the movie, was that it hardly varies in its moods.  Minute after minute the viewer is beset by anguish, angst, anguish, repression, anxiety, angst...  not to mention utter selfishness and impulsivity.  I'm not asking for outright comedy or a song-and-dance routine, but something that provides some contrast to the general mood of quiet despair, and something that contributes genuine reflection on the characters' actions.  The most powerful films accentuate their themes through juxtaposition of different ideas, feelings, textures and moods.  The Hours hit the same note over and over again.",1090972800,9,1029,5.047337278106509

1442987,5,B00005JKTI,"Recently I viewed the movie, ""The Hours"" starring Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, Ed Harris and Julianne Moore. The movie is based on the book by Michael Cunningham and follows the book's ideas about as precisely as possible for a screenplay conversion.
The story revolves around the author, Virginia Woolf, as she writes her story, ""Mrs. Dalloway"" and how the words she writes affect two other women in different time periods. Virginia is portrayed by Nicole Kidman and she does a wonderful job showing the essence of Virginia's depression and self-doubt. A brilliant writer who involves all of your senses in her prose she succumbs to the artist's tendency to be self-doubters and insecure, possibly from all the exposure to critics at every bend and corner. The cigarettes she smokes seethe about her as she contemplates her suicide and a word to leave behind, like her soul is going up in smoke. She lies beside a dead bird and she feels dead before her time, unable to fly and stifled by depression that is never fully explained. Her end is filmed in such a way that she surrenders herself to the river's current and slowly gets swept away by nature but she seems somehow freed by her own death, floating along in time and crossing the borders that time presents.
Julianne Moore plays the character, Laura Brown; a pregnant homemaker in the 1950's who is struggling with what life has to offer her. She seems to exist in a blur of emotion all of which sways towards depression. She attempts to bake a perfect cake for her ""perfect"" husband's birthday and fails sending herself into a moment of panic that almost produces her own demise. She runs away from her child and stays alone in a hotel ready to take her life and that of her unborn. She reads ""Mrs. Dalloway"" and becomes involved in another's misfortune which somehow awakens her to her senses and she retreats back to the normalcy of her mundane life. I could not help but be emotional during a scene where she is preparing herself for bed and her husband calls from the bedroom, ""Come to bed Laura Brown,"" it left me with a sickened feeling. In Laura's eyes you see her sadness and her desperate need to leave but she stays, unhappily, like a servant.
Meryl Streep plays, Clarissa Vaughn, a modern woman who follows the footsteps of Virginia's character ""Mrs. Dalloway"" as she spends her day catering to others. She buys flowers in desperate attempts to cheer up those around her when in fact she is the one who is in need of cheer. She tries to revive a dying man played brilliantly by Ed Harris, Richard, who is succumbing to the power of AIDS and all of its downfalls. Clarissa opens windows for brightness where all she sees is gray; she perks up the grayness with flowers but only manages to bring a feeling of hopelessness to Richard instead. His writing award seems to go unnoticed although she plans a tremendous celebration his soul just shuts down. Under all of the pressure Clarissa breaks down and experiences the sadness of the day and the reality of death. Richard falls from his own window in his desperate act of suicide and mercy. Clarissa is left to deal with all of the pain.
In the end we learn that Richard is in fact the son of Laura Brown. Seemingly she has transferred her loneliness and despair to the life of her own son without regret. She explains that she abandoned her family after all, needing to conduct her life on her own terms.
The music and the language of the film inspire creative juices, especially the scenes where Virginia Woolf is speaking. Having read the book first I was able to experience more than the film managed to contain although the film was more easily explained. I recommend both expressions for the full impact of these desperate women and the lives they lead. It will not take hours to be gripped by their needs.",1087862400,4,3830,4.642120765832106
1442988,5,B00005JKTI,"Rare is the film in which you've heard of almost everyone in it. Like Gosford Park --similarly robbed with a single Oscar in 2001's competition--this film assembles the talent needed to bring a difficult script to life.
Weaving three stories together is a deft feat, accomplished here by connecting the stories with the ties that bind them. These include the party each of the three main characters plans to host on the day in which the film takes place, the same-sex kiss each shares before the day is out, and Mrs. Dalloway , the Virginia Woolf novel that one character is writing, one is reading, and one is living. Also instrumental in keeping the flow of the movie going is a superb score by minimalist Philip Glass.
It's the acting that really shines, though. Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore, and Meryl Streep earn our empathy in every scene, radiating their feelings above and beyond the carefully crafted script. Kidman's scowling Woolf, battling husband Stephen Dillane for the right to control her own troubled existence, is as believable a tortured genius as can be imagined, outshining even Russell Crowe's portrayal of John Nash. Moore's '50s housewife hides the pain of her discontent from her husband--an excellent John C. Reilly--but not from us. Streep's face telegraphs her joy at buying the flowers for her party and her guilty dismay when Ed Harris scolds her for living to throw it.
Still, why should you watch a movie about three women in the throes of crisis? Because the film conveys at least two messages of profound importance. The first is that happiness is not to be taken for granted. As Streep lies on her bed, talking to daughter Claire Danes, she recalls the day, long ago, when she awoke at dawn from a night spent with Harris, before both embarked on lives with same-sex partners. She felt such possibility, such joy--the beginning, she thought, of happiness. But that was happiness, she now knows. She should have known it then. She should have understood it sooner. She's been trapped in that moment ever since, looking down a road never taken, rueing the brambles that have long since overgrown it. She should have been living the life she's got.
The second message is that things are getting better. The three stories carry across four generations. In the first, Virginia Woolf kisses her sister in desperation at her situation. Miranda Richardson's reaction is a fit of hysterics, and she flees to London. In the second, Moore's housewife kisses neighbor Toni Collette to comfort her about an impending medical procedure that threatens her womanhood. Collette partakes, then pretends it didn't happen. In the third, Streep kisses lover-of-ten-years Allison Janney passionately, seeming to acknowledge in a moment Janney's years of living in the shadows of a memory and renewing a relationship that seemed troubled as the film opened. Danes gives a hug filled with forgiveness whose significance, in my opinion, outweighs all three kisses, showing that the next iteration of the story can contain not only a modicum of happiness but also forgiveness for those who suffered through the stories of the past and couldn't quite cope.
The Hours begins and ends with a suicide, with another in the middle for good measure. Yet it affirms the value of life, of moving on, of progress, of the notion that tomorrow will be better. It is a movie of depth and ideas. If you haven't seen it yet, you're missing out on one of the decade's most profound cinematic achievements.",1087430400,4,3499,4.942275042444821
1442989,5,B00005JKTI,"Wow....this movie was incredible. Almost every actor had a top notch performance going. The only character whose feelings i didn't really understand were those of the man with AIDS. This is not a film for those who cannot take two and a half hours of thoughtful emotional things taking places in real life, not some mission impossible film. The ending of this movie is a bit unsatisfying, but in real life does anything really conclude itself into a nice sappy ending? And to those who say that the despair of the three women isn't plausible- because they're just a bunch of spoiled rich brats- depression can affect anybody of any race gender age and income level. Shame on you for thinking money is the key to all happiness.
Just a warning to those who have not seen it: This is a very emotionally draining film. I have not seen a film that is more depressing than this one.. Dont watch it at a party because everybody will just be gloomy for the rest of the celebration.",1087430400,2,973,4.534090909090909
1442990,4,B00005JKTI,"Stephen Daldry's film, adapted from the novel by Michael Cunningham, is certainly flawed.  It doesn't quite achieve exactly what it tries to, and its mood is occasionaly, for lack of a better word, incorrect.
Three women are trying to find something.  In 1920s England, Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) is trying to find inspiration for her newest novel.  Thousands of miles away and several decades later, 1950s housewife Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) is trying to find time to read the aforementioned novel.  Even yet more miles and years away, Y2K socialite Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep) is trying to find something, too-- although we're never sure exactly what that is.  Long story short, the three stories are linked both on superficial and deeper levels, and a lesson is to be learned.  Hint: I think it has something to do with hours in the day.
Daldry captures cinematic parallelism very well, but he fails to capture any form of parallelism in the persons of the three female leads.  Kidman is humorless, dry and cold; Moore is humbly subtle and conflicted; and Streep is curiously boisterous and campy.  Indeed, the three actresses all turn in riveting performances; notably Moore, whose Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress was overshadowed by her simultaneous nomination in another category for ""Far From Heaven.""  Kidman, who won the Oscar for Best Actress, is ironically the weakest of the three leads and has the least screen time.
The entire supporting cast is certainly the film's strongest asset, with strong performances from Jeff Daniels, Miranda Richardson, the delightful Toni Collette, and the underrated Stephen Dillane as the conflicted Leonard Woolf.  Others are sorely underutilized; namely Allison Janney, Claire Daines, and John C. Reilly.  However, Ed Harris, Best Supporting Actor nominee, is merely disappointing even at his best moments.
The cinematography by Seamus McGarvey is safe but adequate, and David Hare's screenplay is the same.  The musical score by Philip Glass is at times rather distracting-- it's one of those musical scores that is better when listened to by itself.  The film's real problem is that it fails to capture a fitting mood that is necessary to thoroughly move its audience in the end.  The film's message is lost in all the moviemaking and one isn't exactly sure why these ""hours"" are so significant.
Still, the film is worth a watch (and even an 4/5 rating) for some brilliant performances, especially by Moore and Streep.",1086566400,2,2490,5.1464019851116625
1442991,5,B00005JKTI,"It's really a pleasure to see all these great actos together in one movie. Spephen Daldry's ""The Hors"", about three women in different times is a beautiful masterpiece.
Virginia Woolf (performed by Nicole Kidman) is in the 1920s writing her book ""Mrs. Dalloway"" (near of London), Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) is reading it in 1954 (in L.A.), and Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep) is living the Mrs. Dalloway's life in the today-New York. This three women have the same character: They're living a life they don't want to live.
The film received 9 Oscar-Nominations, also for the best director - Daldry -, the best script - David Hare adapted very well Michael Cunningham's book ""The Hours"", and the best Film. It WAS one of the best films in 2003, maybe the best, with ""Far From Heaven"" and ""Chicago"" and ""The Pianist"". And the film with the most best actors: Nicole Kidman received an Oscar for her Virginia Woolf-playing, she makes herself little and small and ugly and you almoust forget it's Kidman who's there on the scope (perhaps also because of her wrong nose??).
Meryl Streep is laudable and brillant as Clarissa, there are small moments where you know she is a really great actress. For example the scene in the kitchen when Jeff Daniels is standing there and she beginns to crie, when she reallizes she is living a wrong life. Than you can see what's a real high-acting-level.
But actually the attraction, the best actress of the movie is Julianne Moore. Her performance is outsanding, and it's just not understandable why she didn't received an Oscar and just a nomination. With ""Far From Heaven"" and ""The Hours"" it's clear that she is one of the best actresses in our time. Maybe THE BEST. You can't describe her wonderfull acting...
A great actor-ensemble (also in supporting roles included Oscar-nominated Ed Harris - grand as ill poet and Clarissa's friend -, Toni Collete, John C. Reilly, Eelien Atkins, Miranda Richardson, Claire Danes, and many others) in an unforgettable film-event.

claustrophobia that the characters feel, but the characters are not themselves interesting enough to justify the overwrought emotions this movie tries to stampede over us.

1443019,4,B00005JKTI,"Reading the reviews here on Amazon, it seems there are many people who feel The Hours was hypnotic, moving, and intelligent. There are also numerous reviewers who felt that the film was overwhelmingly depressing, self-important, and ultimately dull. Both of the above statements are true!
First, let me say there is rarely a masterpiece created that isn't self-important. A visionary knows when he creates a masterpiece, knows going into the project that he is creating something that speaks of truth. It doesn't use irony or any kind of sideline, but hits the audience with truth head-on.
The first time I saw The Hours in theaters, I was dreadfully disappointed!  I thought it was pompous and pointless! It was only as I began to remember subtle details, scenes, and emotions from the film that I came to respect its greatness--the greatness of Kidman's wistful gazes and forceful intensity.. The pain and humility and wisdom conveyed in her voice and every gesture.  There is a line in the film, when Woolf (Kidman) is asked by her husband, who must die (in her novel). Woolf replies, ""the visionary must die."" I think that is the message of The Hours, but it took me a long time to discover it.
All three women in the film could represent visionaries, but there are forces suppressing them. Moore is trapped in a marriage to a man she does not love (and does not fulfill her needs), Kidman seems to be the intelligent and romantic dreamer surrounded by people who can only see the superficial qualities of life (only the young girl can see the depth inherent in her, and the significance that Kidman finds in the dead bird).
The film is flawed. The segment with Meryl Streep seems to drag, uninspired and depressing. Her performance is a weak link in a film that has two fully realized characters played by two of our best actresses today (Moore and Kidman). It is the compelling combination of brilliant performances, a haunting score, and masterful writing that gives the film its unique and lasting impact.
And to address those who feel Kidman only won the Academy Award for her deglamorized appearance, perhaps they should see the film again and look at the meaning Kidman conveys in every gesture, word, and soulful gaze.",1079740800,3,2230,4.819843342036553

I kept expecting Judith Light or Shanon Doherty to appear.  The performances were not compelling, and I can't for the life of me understand how Kidman received such priase for this yawner.  I guess if you stick a big piece of bubblegum in the tip of your nose, ugly yourself up a bit, that becomes award winning acting.  I know I should have felt something for the three women in this story... If not completely understand their pain and struggles, at least acknowledge it.  But, I felt nothing.  Actually, that is not entirely true.  I did feel something...frustrated.  For 2 hours I felt the frustration at these 3 actresses on the screen.  In the end, I was only too happy that it was over.  It is a film that really leaves you feeling empty.  This is not because the performances were so engrossing that you feel the emptiness and pain in these women's lives.  No, you feel empty because you sat dopwn to watch a great movie, and instead witnessed some mediocre movie of the week hogwash.

SOMEONE didn't do their homework. Does this reviewer realize that Virginia Woolf suffered from an acute mental illness that drove her to suicide?  This person needs to research these subjects a bit before ranting about them.
"" I was sort of glad at the end of the movie that Kidman ends it all, she was so unredeeming and irritating at the end of the movie.""- Ibid
You mean, unredeemable  aside from being one of the great novelists of the twentieth century?  I found Kidman did an amazing job of portraying Virginia Woolf's more disturbed side... it's clear from the onset that she is NOT a fully functional woman (as anyone who has ever heard about Virginia Woolf would know that she was not), and that she has serious imbalance issues throughout the film. While she was at her most stable during the writing of ""Mrs. Dalloway"", it's quite clear that it just means that she wasn't suicidal-- her malady was such that it seemed to be almost permanently hanging over her head, her behaviour becoming so erratic at times that she was branded an ""eccentric"". In fact, in the novel ""Mrs. Dalloway"" the character of Septimus is diagnosed and treated pretty much like Virginia Woolf was herself treated. Chronic depresison or schizophrenia, whatever Mrs. Woolf suffered from, was something british society was not in condition or knowledge to treat back then. If you read Mrs. Dalloway, you'll find an echo of Mrs. Woolf's condition in the paragraphs where she enters Septimus' mind. In the movie, the pathos of Mrs. Woolf is very well portrayed by Mrs. Kidman.",1078099200,,2210,4.688144329896907
1443022,2,B00005JKTI,"Okay, after watching the Golden Globes award show and seeing 'The Hours' crowned with the highest prize, Best Picture, and hearing incessantly about Nicole Kidman's fake prosthetic nose in the movie, it was time to venture into that darkened theater and see how good the awards-friendly 'The Hours' was. Little did I fully realize what I was getting myself into.
Nicole Kidman plays Virginia Woolf, who is in the midst of writing her novel Mrs. Dalloway, where she proposes to display a woman's entire life through the events of a single day. Julianne Moore plays Laura Brown, a housewife in 1951 having difficulty adjusting to a domestic life that she feels ill equipped for. Meryl Streep plays Clarissa Vaughan, a gay editor in 2001 planning a party for a poet and former lover (an emaciated Ed Harris), who is suffering from the late stages of AIDS. These three storylines will be juggled as the film progresses, with each woman's life deeply changing before the end of the day.
'The Hours' is a meandering mess where the jigsaw pieces can be easily identified. The attempt at a resolution for an ending, tying the three storylines together, is handled very clumsily. The film spins on and on that you start to believe the title may be more appropriate than intended. What this movie needed was a rappin' kangaroo, post haste!
The film is wrought with female victimization, and screams ""Give me an award already!"" Before you know it you're being bludgeoned to death with what is profoundly the most over serious Lifetime network movie ever assembled. And there's nothing fundamentally wrong with Lifetime movies (their corny sensibilities can be cheery) but 'The Hours' does not share the sensibilities of its ""Must-Sit-To-Pee TV"" brethren.
Kidman, nose and all, gives a strong performance displaying the torture and frailty of a writer trapped within her own mind, but too often relies on wistful staring or icy glares. Moore is effectively demoralized but cannot resonate with such a shallow character. Streep is the least effective of the three and fizzles amongst an over-stuffed assembly of characters. And for those of you that have been waiting for some hot Meryl Streep girl-on-girl action, your thirst has finally been quenched.
The supporting cast is unjustly left for dead. The characters are seen as parody (Toni Collette as Moore's unliberated homemaker neighbor), extraneous (Claire Danes as Streep's daughter, Allison Janney as Streep's lover, Jeff Daniels as Harris' ex-lover, you know what, almost anyone in the Streep storyline), one-note (the workmanlike John C. Reilly who plays yet another doting and demystified husband) or merely obnoxious (Moore's brat child that refuses to separate from her). It appears 'The Hours' is the three lead actress' game, and everyone else is not invited to play along.
Stephen Daldry's direction shows surprising stability and instinct after his art-house pandering 'Billy Elliot' showed none. The technical aspects of 'The Hours' are quite competent, especially the sharp editing and musical score, which just points out further how slickly hollow and manufactured the film is.
'The Hours' is an over-glossed, morose, agenda-driven film that is too self-important for its own good. It sucks the life out of everything.

There is such a ubiquitous sadness, and it makes one wonder if it is possible to find some sense of happiness or fullfillment in one's life, or if it is just a chimera.  Running away or dissolving your identity into somone else's or just walking into a stream is not an end, and, unfortunately is not much of a beginning either.  Are we all destined for unhappy desperation . . great talent doesn't do it, neither does a conventional housewife's existence give answers, nor, apparently does caring for someone else.

1443034,5,B00005JKTI,"If indeed there is a stream of super-consciousness that literally and figuratively transcends space and time, then such a force is manifested in THE HOURS, a powerful, gripping examination of three lives over the course of one eventful day.
The story is rooted in the novel, ""Mrs. Dalloway,"" and its author, Virgina Woolf (Nicole Kidman).  Woolf, in part due to her own depression and self-deprecation, abandoned realist literature with her novel and concentrated instead on the thoughts of her characters.  In the pages of her book human fragility is exposed, and this fragility permeates two other women in two different times:  a lonely, restless housewife in 1950's Los Angeles (Julianne Moore); and a present-day career woman (Meryl Streep) who is busily planning a party for a dying friend.  This film moves superbly from one place in time--from one character's growing angst and sense of misgiving--to another, until at last the three separate stories are tied together in astonishing and remarkable fashion.
Kidman, Moore, and Streep are incomparable; the supporting cast (including Ed Harris in a brief, yet haunting role) is stellar.  No, THE HOURS is not a film that will cheer you up, yet its somber, moody, even dark examination of the inner recesses of the human mind will stir your soul and inspire wonder.

1443035,5,B00005JKTI,"I would have given this movie the Oscar for best movie of 2002. Adapted from Michael Cunningham's fine novel and directed by Stephen Daldry, who, as I remember, directed BILLY ELLIOTT as well, this film has everything going for it: first rate acting by everyone involved, beautiful cinematography, music by Philip Glass-- a composer I'm usually not into, but his compositions work perfectly here-- and a thoughtful plot.
The action covers one day in the lives of each of three women. We see Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) on the day she commits suicide in 1923. We visit Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) on a day in 1951, the day she decides not to commit suicide; and finally, Clarissa Vaughn played by Meryl Streep on a day in 2001 when she is planning a party for her writer friend Richard (Ed Harris)who is dying of AIDS. The action goes back and forth among these three dates. Laura Brown and Clarissa Vaughn are connected to Virginia Woolf because of her novel MRS. DALLOWAY. Laura Brown is reading MRS. DALLOWAY, Virginia Woolf is working on the novel and Richard calls Clarissa ""Mrs. Dalloway.""
The photography is quite wonderful here and helps to hold the movie together. For example, the same images are repeated in each time sequence. Virginia arrives at the first line of her novel ""Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers, herself""and proceeds to arrange flowers. Laura's husband buys her flowers for ""his"" birthday, which she arranges. Finally Clarissa goes shopping to buy tons of flowers for Richard's party. There are also images of eggs being broken as the characters prepare food, the different women in bed, the scenes of the three women washing their faces, the three women kissing other women, and finally, on each day someone arrives early. These visual images make the plot even smoother than in the novel, I think.
Much has been made of Kidman's false nose. Nobody would recognize her as the stunning Australian actress here as she is quite frumpy as Woolf. Meryl Streep is as alway magnificent. There is a stunning scene when she meets the older Laura Brown who makes her apology for leaving her children-- ""I chose life."" Clarissa says nothing in words to condemn Laura. Her eyes tell it all. Acting doesn't get finer than this. As I recall Ed Harris got mixed reviews when the movie first opened. I am at a loss to understand why. He is totally believable as someone in the last stages of AIDS; indeed, some of his scenes are almost too painful to watch.
There are great lines in this film, some of them straight out of the novel. Woolf: ""Even crazy people want to be asked."" She wanted to ""look life in the face."" Richard: ""I have to face the hours."" ""I have stayed alive for you. Now you [Clarissa] have to let me go."" Clarissa remembers a day years ago when she and Richard were young and in love and there was such a sense of possibility. ""We thought it was the beginning of happiness, but it was happiness.""
The movie says so much about so many things that are important-- death, suicide, insanity, illness, friendship and, above all, love. I don't mean to make the movie sound trite. Is is far from that. People will be watching it years from now.",1074643200,7,3182,4.683928571428571

Isn't there a lack of something that makes a story interesting ? Yes ! This something is missing a lot. Believe me. It is boring and nothing happen except everlasting dialogues.

The plot connects the people through a book by Virginia Woolf.  I am not sure what the point of view of the writer was.  There are several philosophical statements repeated.  It seems that the movie is about people not living the way they want to live.  It never seems to develop completely.  However, the acting is superb.

However, this is as much a movie about being a woman over time as it is a literary biography.  We watch, fascinated, as each of these stories unfolds.  While there are certainly parts of this film which are tragic, the film takes the viewer on a deeply moving journey of masterful storytelling.  Every character is paired with an excellent performer, which is why the movie works so well.  In my opinion, this is a must-see film for anyone who appreciates snuggling up with a good novel on a snowy day... and especially for women who have struggled with role-strain during the daily course of their lives.",1074470400,3,731,4.724409448818897
1443039,5,B00005JKTI,"I'm not a Nicole Kidman fan, but she is stellar in The Hours, in which she plays Virginia Woolf during the 20s as she begins to write Mrs. Dalloway, her first great novel. Then there's Julianne Moore playing Laura Brown, a repressed, depressed, and frustrated suburban mom during the 40s (and her very frightened, preternaturally `aware' young son) who begins reading Mrs. Dalloway and starts to question her own life and its goals - and wonders if it's really worth going on. And then, in modern-day NYC, there's Clarissa (named for the title role in Mrs. Dalloway and played by the incomparable Meryl Streep) acting out the book itself as she buys flowers and plans a celebratory party for her friend and former lover, played by Richard Harris, who is dying of AIDs.
It's a convoluted movie, and while we can easily make the connection between Virginia Woolf's life and Clarissa's NY life, Laura Brown's place in this trio is unclear until the very end, when everything ties together so beautifully that it leaves you breathless.
See it now. Then read the book, and of course, if you haven't already done so for some college lit course, read Mrs. Dalloway.",1074124800,6,1158,4.795
1443040,1,B00005JKTI,"We wanted to give this film a chance. The Hours got great reviews, and both of us had read a couple of Virginia Woolf's novels in past periods of our lives. My problems with this film are three:

1) The cast is overwhelming. It's like a jazz band with too many soloists and not enough rhythm backup. Many supporting roles amount to cameos for actors who are capable of carrying other films. It becomes an exercise for the viewer of ""oh, hey, I remember them in...."" which in the end is a distraction. Also, each supporting player works so hard to make an impact in their short screen time that everyone just winds up sounding hysterical.

2)  Ed Harris as an AIDS victim? Uh huh. Nice try. A classic case of miscasting, and scenery chewing by an actor who should know better. Obnoxious.

3) An incredibly self-regarding, pretentious screenplay. The relentless degeneration among all of these materially very well-off characters is just completely implausible. NO ONE ever laughs. No one ever seems to even appreciate being alive, or take any pleasure in anything whatsoever. There is never a thematic break that allows the audience to see something positive - to give the viewer a break. Tragedy is best illustrated by also illuminating what was good about the protagonist. Shakespeare saw this, particularly in Othello. This movie does not, and fatally hamstrings itself.

The sadness of Virginia Woolf I can understand - but the Streep and Moore characters are beyond plausible. The movie continually grabs you by the lapels and DEMANDS that you appreciate the terrible psychological dilemmas facing these rich Yuppies.

After somewhere around an hour of this bathetic lachrymatory, we pulled the disc out and said, ""well, THAT was a waste of time...."" This movie is highbrow soap opera. I'm sure it's great if you're of a certain mindset, but I suspect many intelligent moviegoers are disappointed with this one.",1073779200,23,1915,4.950155763239875

1443062,5,B00005JKTI,"When sitting down to review this superb film, at first the task proved to be problematic. This picture is an adaptation of a prize-winning novel by Michael Cunningham, which is loosely based on one of the great modernist novels of the last century, Mrs. Dalloway. In many respects, too, the film touches on the author's life, Virginia Woolf. The singular genius of the film is its fundamental structure, in terms of running all the aforementioned pieces and their themes in tandem. This is extremely clever because this was Woolf's intent when writing Mrs. Dalloway: connecting apparently disparate people and themes in a coalescent manner. Virginia Woolf was an experimental novelist, who successfully used the literary technique known as stream of consciousness. Breaking away from the conventional realist or naturalist forms used predominately in the 19th century, where the narrative was carried along by way of external action, this new technique moved the action into the characters mind, known as interior monologue. In Mrs Dalloway, we are invited into Clarice's mind, gaining access to her memories of childhood and relationships, and at the same time, her life parallels Septimus Warren Smith, a war veteran on the edge of insanity. Their lives become interconnected on a level of thought and time.  In ~The Hours~ the lives of three women, existing in three different time periods, run parallel to each other, all searching for meaning, all connected on levels of thought, circumstance and time, all in one seamless narrative.
In many films the majority of burden is on the main character, the lead actor, to ensure the project is a success. As there are three distinct narratives in this film, and three leading actors, it would have only taken one weak performance to turn this film into a disaster. I believe the producers knew this and managed to hire probably the top three female actors in Hollywood.  Only one received the Oscar, Nicole Kidman, in the role of Virginia Woolf. However, Meryle Streep as Clarisa Vaughn and Julian Moore as Laura Brown put in outstanding performances, who more than deserved this recognition as well.
This is a complicated film but a beautiful one with a haunting soundtrack by Phillip Glass, which demands to be viewed more than once to discover its many nuances, allusions and their connections.",1073088000,3,2346,5.106770833333333

1443064,5,B00005JKTI,"This is a spectacular movie in which we get the opportunity to see acting by some of the best actresses of our time.
  The film asks how is it possible for an individual to exercise his/her freedom in order to break free from a situation that stifles creative growth. The surge into freedom is never black and white and is never penalty-free. .... for example,  in order to survive the bland, de-humanizing cliches of the '50ies ""family life"" the Moore character had to abandon her family and child.
Subsumed in the main three stories, which only come together at the end (in a masterful stroke of screen-writing and directing)  are several metaphorical streams opening (but never closing) the questions of intimacy, creative spirit and (emotional, physical and creative) survival.  Daldry ties together the three narrative threads by using parallel montage, sometimes by using the same motives or just the color of the clothes.
This is a deeply inspiring film, a true work of art.  It shows little compromise with the Lowest Common Denominator.

1443066,5,B00005JKTI,"""The Hours"" is indeed a powerful film.  The power trio of Kidman, Moore, and Streep turn in a subtly nuanced coup d' grace of a performance that to watch is to sit on the sidelines of a Super Bowl of an event of acting.
""The Hours"" is a skillful tale of interwoven lives threaded together through different ages and times; held together by a concept, an idea, and a tale--Virginia Wolff's ""Mrs. Dalloway.""  Each life is somewhat affected by the other as Virginia Wolff unconsciously pulls the strings in the writing of a story.  When Kidman's character proclaims, ""We still have to decide the fate of our heroine (largely paraphrased, mind you),"" as the audience, we sit with baited breath knowing the stroke of her pen will determine the fate of Moore's post-WWII houswife's life and Streep's 2001 New York City socialite life.
The screenplay and director's editing are quite a notch above creative genius.  In the opening scenes there are flowers and the scenes switches effortlessly from one of the woman's life to the other as they prepare for the looming weight of a fateful day each with flowers in the mix.  The effect is that we suspend time and follow the stories without conscious thought stepping back and forth.  The three stories in effect become one, held together by the overriding sense that they are not happy lives, they are not lives of freedom, but lives subservient to the will of others.
One of the best features of this DVD is the voice over narrative of Streep, Moore, and Kidman.  It is illuminating to hear their individual approach to acting and their experiences making this film.  It is like an acting class taught by the most prominent acting greats of our times.  It was very interesting to hear that Streep was proud that she was the only actress that gets up in the morning looking like she had been asleep.  She is proud of this fact and points it out.  That's a film perspective we didn't get in past film classics and makes the DVD purchase worth the price of admission.  Don't miss out on the ""Hours.""

He says it's about ""3 lesbians . . . who commit suicide.""  Leaving aside the issue of whether or not ""lesbian"" is the most appropriate way to describe two of the three main characters, this supposed plot summary is just plain false.  Only ONE of the women commits suicide -- the one who really existed in real life, and did indeed really commit suicide, Virginia Woolf.  And, guess what, she does it in the first five minutes of the movie.
It would appear that not only did the Wallingford reviewer ""know from the first 5 minutes"" that this movie ""was going to suck,"" but that he didn't bother to watch beyond that initial 5.

The strongest of the threads (and the most affecting) concerns an emotionally fragile housewife (Julianne Moore) barely keeping it together on a summer's day in the 40s in Los Angeles: the rhythms Moore and the wonderful child actor who plays her son are so assured and unnerving that it's almost painfully beautiful. Nicole Kidman garnered a great deal of critical attention (and an Academy Award) for wearing a prosthetic nose and playing Virginia Woolf herself during the composition of her greatest novel. Kidman looks and seems almost nothing like the real Woolf, but the performance is exceptional nonetheless: she almost seems to come unglued by dint of her sheer intellectual strength and sensitivity. In the weakest of the stories (a fault of the original novel), Meryl Streep is quite fine as a contemporary Mrs. Dalloway putting together a party for her best friend, a famous poet (Ed Harris) dying of AIDS, and she redeems the material here a good deal.

As much a mood piece as a narrative, this a wonderfully subtle snapshot of three lives in three different eras (1920s, 1950s, 2001) - interweaving literally and thematically in the most unexpected and poignant ways.
Each strand echoes and compliments the others - most obviously at the beginning, with clever intercutting as the three women awake to face the day. Contrasts and similarities effortlessly illuminate elements of character and setting, and this is something which continues throughout the film. Decisions and events are frequently mirrored, offering insight into the storylines, and to the choices that are made regarding life, and death. Every viewing opens up new perspectives and new parallels; it's quite breathtaking, really!
Superbly acted (what a cast!), beautifully-shot and accompanied by a wonderful score, this is a stunning film: subtle, beautiful, moving but never maudlin.
DVD extras: a good package, headed up by two commentaries; the three lead actresses were recorded separately for their commentary, which is unfortunate since when they're together in one of the accompanying featurettes they play nicely off each other.

So rarely can a movie weave 3 stories into one blanket with such accuracy and precise perfection. Although the stories never really connect they are all revolved around suicide and illness. There are some fine supporting roles in this movie by Claire Danes and Allison Janney just to name a few..The Hours is such a gem in movie making and it stands out in 2002 like a sun during night. Each detail is so carefully contructed its hard to find anything wrong with the plots and how they somehow converge into one.
Speaking in terms of myself, who is the kind of person never to really bother with huge succesful box-office movies since they always turn out to be drab and fab, this movie was different. It's emotions and fluttering lauguage can reach depths that you never knew you had. The whole movie is almost like a piece of poetry, en excellent poem.

1443071,3,B00005JKTI,"This is exactly the kind of movie I generally dislike, with a lot of moody people, and the general theme is the contemplation of suicide not once, not twice, but by three separate characters in three separate settings in three separate half-centuries.  Yet I came away from it with teary eyes (granted, not a high bar in my case).  I can't recommend it, really, yet it got my wife and me talking the way few movies do.  And the critics loved it.
There are too many characters.  You can't get involved in them in a satisfying way.  The dialogue poses as the sparse, deep sort of stuff that can be very effective if you've been drawn inside the character.  Yet as it is, too often it's just dumb (my wife's word, although she would give this film many many stars).
I nominate Ray (the Los Angeles 1951 husband and father) and Meryl Streep's (2001) daughter for a new category of academy award:  Best Sane Person in a Film Full of Annoying, Self-Absorbed People.  Ray has my favorite line in the film.  Describing to his son how he met his wife, he recalls being in the South Pacific during the Second World War, and thinking about a girl from his high school, a shy girl whom he decided he would marry when he got home-which he did-and he says about his wife and son, ""I imagined our happiness.""  I imagined our happiness.  That's what got him through the war!  The whole LA bit is so vivid, so flat and un-ironic, so like the Beach Boys album Pet Sounds, released in 1967 in monaural, certainly the last such, and there is something so crystalline about the effect.  And that's Ray, saying that totally campy, guileless line, in a movie filled with people who seem never to have imagined the happiness of another person.
Close second is Streep's daughter, who lights up the screen whenever she appears, with a wonderful, funny reaction (possibly the only humor in the film, very near the end) to one of her mother's complaints to the effect of ""Stop whining, you're just getting older.""  (Her mother's not so bad; she cares about Richard's happiness at least.)
My interest picked up hugely later on when Richard contemplated his photo of his mother, and by the end when Virginia Woolf slides into the river, and the voiceover gorgeously states how long and difficult every moment of life can be (she is quite a writer), I felt enough empathy for this ragtag group as a whole to feel rather touched.
The director goes to the length of conscientiously showing shots of round plates of food being cast into round trash cans fifty years apart (fortunately there's not too much of this sort of ""look at me"" stuff), very early and very late in the story.  So he's a careful guy.  But I have a quibble:  Richard's make-up is so terrifically believable, why let one of the last shots of him show his well-toned quadriceps muscle?  Is this an AIDS sufferer who is also a sculling champion?",1071014400,3,2879,4.557281553398059

1443083,3,B00005JKTI,"Directed by Stephen Daldry (whose previous film was the excellent BILLY ELLIOT) & Scripted by David Hare & based on the book by Michael Cunningham, THE HOURS is split into three different time frames.
The first is in London in the 1920s with Nicole Kidman in her Oscar winning role as writer Virginia Woolf where she is writing her first novel MRS DALLOWAY, and fighting an oncoming breakdown during the process.(The film opens with her suicide by drowning).
The second segment is set in the 1950s where suburban housewife Laura Brown (Julianne Moore)is herself battling depression and reading Woolf's novel, and finding it inspirational in this difficult period of her life.
The final segment is set in 2001 where Clarrisa Vaughan (Meryl Streep), a lesbian, is dealing with the plight of her ex-husband (Ed Harris, in an excellent performance) who's dying of AIDS.
These three different time zones are brilliantly woven to make a seamless whole, with the film giving vivid recreations of the different eras resulting in a slightly melodramatic but overall interesting movie. THE HOURS is a film which probably holds more appeal for female viewers, but guys won't find it totally insufferable either though it does seem a bit overlong. THE HOURS is the only Nicole Kidman movie to date where male viewers won't be drooling over her, but they won't suffer a coronary if their girlfriends insist they watch it. Interestingly, the movie was disqualified for the makeup Oscar because Nicole's schnozz was digitally enhanced to make it appear seamless onscreen. So basically how much you enjoy this movie depends on whether you are a fan of Woolf (I'll admit I've never read her stuff) & your gender. In my opinion the movie is good, but seriously overhyped.

Reilly, Ed Harris, Miranda Richardson, Allison Janney, Claire Danes, Jeff Daniels, Eileen Atkins, Toni Collette, and Claire Danes.  Even with this cast, though, I couldn't get myself to give this film a 10.  For some reason, I felt unattached to the Nicole Kidman - Stephen Dillane segment.
Not surprisingly, I was most affected by the Meryl Streep - Ed Harris segment.  I thought that their unrequited love, which is brought to both characters attention constantly, was genuinely constructed by all the characters involved.  It shows how this unrequited love affects not only Ms. Streep and Mr. Harris, but also Ms. Janney and Mr. Daniels.  Everyone in the segment knows that Ms. Streep and Mr. Harris should have been together, and that in most intimate ways, they are.
The segment that I found myself most drawn to was the Julianne Moore - John C. Reilly segment.  Watching Ms. Moore hide her true feelings from her son and Mr. Reilly was heartwrenching.  And while Mr. Reilly has the face of a true character actor, I am constantly amazed at the emotions that come across on Ms. Moore's face.  She has a face as smooth and beautiful as a Michaelangelo statue ... a porcelain skin too beautiful for words.  And yet she manages to use this face as an awesome tool in her considerble acting resource ""closet"".  This becomes very clear as her face is hidden beneath latex in later scenes.  Underneath the latex, she becomes less interesting and lucky for us director Stephen Daldry notices this as well and keeps that scene as short as possible.
Unfortunately Ms. Kidman does not fare as well.  Her performance - and that of Stephen Dillane - is great, no doubts about it.  But for some reason I was strangely uninvolved in her segment.  I found the other two to be so much less conventional that this segment, even anchored by the great work of Mr. Dillane and Ms. Kidman, seemed somewhat pedestrian.  I venture to guess that this segment was the easiest to write and direct.
In the end, I thought it was cool the way Harold Pinter and Stephen Daldry (and, I presume, Michael Cunningham) tied it all together.  Thematically it was tied together all the way through, but they really tie it up well.
Perhaps the greatest comment I can give the movie is to say that I am curious to read MRS. DALLOWAY now.  That, and that the film would make a great double feature with Ms. Moore's FAR FROM HEAVEN.",1069286400,4,2466,4.7109557109557105
1443087,5,B00005JKTI,"2002 review:

I loved this movie! I thought it was superbly done. It reminded me of MAGNOLIA in the way it intertwined the stories together, and how they all came together. It was a very moving, powerful film with EXCELLENT performances. Nicole Kidman was AWESOME as Virginia Woolf and Julianne Moore was mesmerizing. Ed Harris was PERFECT in his role. It is a film that really makes you think, and as you're watching it, you realize that at one point in your life, you have felt like these characters before. I will end up buying this one, and now I want to read the book as well.

2010 review:

It is clear to me upon reading many of the comments on this site, that most of the viewers did not ""get"" this film. To fully grasp the themes of the film, it helps to have read both Woolf's ""Mrs. Dalloway"" and Cunningham's ""The Hours"" in order to understand the psychology of the characters and the reasoning behind their life choices. This film is more or less about three women from three different decades, who are sublimely unhappy with their lives, and who try to cope with that unhappiness through art and creativity. All the while, they seriously consider suicide as an end to their misery, but opt to stay alive to make others around them happy. Some survive this inner struggle, and some don't. Some will argue with the film's humanist worldview, but as far as I can tell, these emotions are real, these situations are real, and they happen every day. The Hours only brings those things to the light.

Much has been made of the ""lesbian"" kissing scenes in the film. The viewers who have commented vehemently on these three instances have indeed taken it all out of context. These women so desperately want to make a connection with another human being, that the kisses aren't what they seem to be on the surface. They are not sexual, by any means. Yes, there are gay and lesbian characters in the film, but there are gay and lesbian people in life, as well.

Every time I see this film, it's as though I see it through new eyes. I always gain a fresh perspective, and this has much to do with the fact that I am older, and have gained much more life experience than when I first saw the film years ago. Everything about the film bursts with life, from the beautiful cinematography, to the acting, the Philip Glass' beautiful score. There is also an unexpected scene of forgiveness that is truly touching.

You should come away from this film a little more enlightened than you were before, that is, if you are willing to go there...and it always helps to read the books beforehand to gain a fuller experience. Those who have claimed that the film is about ""nothing"" are dead wrong. This film works on so many levels. It is nothing short of a miracle.

Highly recommended!",1067472000,,2777,4.530938123752495
1443088,4,B00005JKTI,"Exquisite and beautified by four flawless performances, ""The Hours"" is a period and character study of characters whose lives are, for whatever reason, unfulfilled and made unbearable by inner demons or the fates already pre-determined. Brilliant but tormented author Virginia Woolf's dark novel ""Mrs. Dalloway"" is the thread that connects the writer's character of 1921 and 1941 to those in 1951 and 2001. Each time frame has its own lead character painfully recognizing and then coming to terms somehow with the anquish and disappointments of their own lifes, and the power of the film is that each character superbly conveys the torment of their lives. Little wonder that Nicole Kidman, truly nearly unrecognizable, copped a richly deserved Best Actress Oscar for her devastating portrayal of the doomed Virginia Woolf. But, if it could have been, Oscars were as worthy for Julianna Moore as the '50s housewife who can't be contented with the facade of family harmony in that sedate decade, and for the incomparable Meryl Streep in her study of the contemporary character whose life seems to be lived as an extension of others. As a lifelong friend of Streep's character, actor Ed Harris delivers an equally painful and stirring performance as a gay man dying of AIDS. Far from being a ""feel-good"" movie, ""The Hours"" is an emotional experience for anyone who has hit the point when life doesn't seem to be enough and where the desperation stemming from absolute unhappiness can take us. Though it offers little to feel good about, the film is nonetheless a powerful force that begs the question how much of life each of us needs to be happy. The film's leads are no less powerful in conveying it and then looking for answers, some that, tragically, don't always exist. It's one of the best films of its type.",1067472000,2,1811,4.940983606557377

1443091,2,B00005JKTI,"The Hours is supposed to be a three story film where the characters are linked by depression and suicide although they themselves may not be suffering from these ailments but are close to someone who is. The stories are interlaced by these connections and by the book ""Mrs Dalloway"" by Virginia Woolf who also appears as one the main characters in one of the three stories. Its heavy on despair, misery, hopelessness and death.
The movie has some great acting from Meryl Streep but unfortunately the other cast are not really as functional as you would have expected. The movie does go to that next level in makeup effects such as aging, changing a persons face completely and the presentation of an aids victim. Tops marks all round for these effects and costumes but do these things make a film?
No, they do not. Stephen Daldry is not a very good director and if you did not like Billy Elliot then you will probably not like this vehicle either. He is an up-and-coming director but his work seems very amateurish as if he is not really conscious about the material at hand and realizing his vision onto the screen. Its ends up with many loose ends and missing connections that should have be made.
Nichole Kidmans character of Virginia Woolf ends up saying and doing very little. In most scenes she is just standing around doing or saying nothing. Unfortunately Julianne Moore goes one step beyond Kidmans character by simply walking straight off the set for ""Far from Heaven"" giving up a double-dose of a helpless woman in despair. The only one of the three that stands out is Meryl Streep and her performance is to be commended. Sadly John C. Reilly is wasted by also saying and doing very little but Ed Harris regrettably overacts his character to the point of killing any realism that he once had. Surprisingly enough the movie ends up not being as moving as what it makes itself out to be.
In short this movie is a misfire in a lot of ways and is pretty hollow overall. It is no ""Remains of the Day"", ""Shadowlands"", ""Magnolia"" or ""Beaches"" if that is what you are expecting.",1066953600,5,2081,4.596774193548387

1443117,4,B00005JKTI,"Great acting, music and storyline shifting smoothly within three settings are what makes this unusual film stand out. Three superb actresses shine in leading roles of three tortured women; Nicole Kidman, as author Virginia Woolf (between 1923-1941), hands in a difficult, wonderfully nuanced performance for which she got Oscar and Golden Globe (she said she found the role to be just for her after the divorce with Tom Cruise). Julianne Moore is once again at her most convincing as an unfulfilled 1950's housewife reading Woolf's novel ""Mrs. Dalloway"". And Meryl Streep plays a publisher preparing a party for her AIDS-stricken friend (a writer who calls her Mrs. Dalloway) in 2001.
The viewer gradually discovers more are more things the three have in common, while their stories symbolically entertwine on the cushion wings of haunting music score by Philip Glass. The messages the characters are sending are rather ambiguous, with Kidman's character probably more likely to elicit compassion in spectators than Moore's and Streep's. Director Stephen Daldry (""Billy Elliott"") was able to get the best also from other actors, including Toni Collette, John C. Reilly, Jeff Daniels and Claire Danes. Only Ed Harris tries a bit too much as Streep character's friend, his acting here being far from low-key.
Nevertheless, Harris was also nominated for an Oscar, as was Moore, and the leading female trio was given a joint prize for best actress at 2003 Berlin Film Festival.
Offering a post-modern view on human relationships in an enthralling, mesmerising production, ""The Hours"" is not a film for everyone, but lovers of good cinema (and acting with capital A) definitely should not miss it.",1066435200,,1692,5.224264705882353

The movie is an emotionally draining experience that works on many levels, acting, especially Nicole Kidman who provides a quite stunning performance, make-up, Ed Harris really does look like he has Aids, sets, fifties Los Angeles with all the cars they had to find and the English countryside looks like the English countryside, costumes, dialogue, music, lighting, it all blends together so perfectly.
But what really made this a great buy for me were the extras on this disc.  From past experience I find a lot of this stuff on DVDs not really worth watching (and certainly not more than once) but Hours has some fascinating material.  The commentaries by director Daldry and novelist Cunningham gave me interesting insights into what they were trying to do with the movie, on screen commentaries by the three leading ladies were equally as interesting.  There is an excellent thirty-minute documentary about Virginia Woolf and three other features, which perfectly complements the movie.  Composer Philip Glass gets his chance too.  So, overall an excellent package that I think will be worth many repeat viewings.",1066089600,2,1204,5.148717948717949
1443119,5,B00005JKTI,"A fine cast headed by Nicole Kidman (Virginia Woolf, England, 1941), Julianne Moore (Laura, LA, 1951) and Meryl Streep (Clarissa, NYC, 2001), presents the story adapted from the award-winning book by Michael Cunningham, ""The Hours"". The story juxtaposes the lives of a writer (Woolf), a reader of her book ""Mrs. Dallaway"" (Laura) living in an LA suburb in after-WWII times, and a NY book editor (Clarissa), who pretty much goes through an ordinary day in her life, getting set for a party she's going to throw later in the day for her friend Richard (Ed Harris), a poet who's just received an award. As simple as such a plot may strike you, it is a complex one, but a careful editing labor, a passion for storytelling, some outstanding acting and the music by minimalist maestro Philip Glass serve as the thread between the stories of these three women.
Complementing an already outstanding film statement, the make-up and the dialogs ring once and again, with Kidman's face virtually hiding away to bring Woolf's back to life, and when you listen to the lines of all the characters taking on a life of their own, almost moving away from Woolf, away from Cunningham... even away from the very adapter, David Hare, as if told by any of us. Because this is a movie not about trauma, or tragedy, or a sad or sorry existential life of a middle-aged woman (or group of women). This story is about our eternal search for happiness, ""the choices we make in that search, and their consequences"" as the director, Stephen Daldry, so brilliantly put it.
A small bit from the lines of Streep, when talking to her daughter Julie, played by Claire Danes:
""It wasn't the beginning... it was happiness. It was the moment, right then!"" as if to say, happiness is not a destination, it's the journey that we make every day, while we lead our very ordinary lives, it's in the moments that hide behind the hours, those that we inexorably face. All in all, this movie is now and will be for as long as I can remember it, a classic and a constant reference.
Final comment: I don't agree with the comments about another reviewer about the movie being JUST about homosexuality, though there are definite moments where a lesbian side of the characters comes across. If you can't see beyond the fact that some people will just live their lives in a different way than others, and realize that the movie actually does apply to all of us, then you are limiting your life in a very sad way.",1065916800,,2461,4.621004566210046
1443120,5,B00005JKTI,"The Hours is a marvelous exploration of the psychological burdens faced by three women.  All three women are alienated from the men in their lives, and all three find emotional and sexual companionship in other women.  But one of the ways the movie avoids cliche is that it doesn't depict abusive or neglectful men as the source of these women's alienation -- indeed, the men in their lives are caring, and in the case of Virignia Wolfe's character, deeply concerned about her welfare.  The film thus suggests that the pyshological burden faced by women runs deeper and is more complex than we think.
The Hours is also an incredibly inspiring, albeit painful, story of how one copes with illness and loss.  Meryl Streep's character dedicates herself to caring for her former lover and best friend who has AIDS.  Although she pretends to be cheerful as she brings him food and flowers each day, it is clear that she is in denial of the imminence of his death.  This denial begins to take its toll on her, culminating in a mental break down in a deeply moving scene fantastically performed by Streep.  One of the main messages of the movie is that one has to look life in the face, see it for what it is, face the difficulty head on, and then ""put it away"" (Meryl Streep's closing line as she turns off the light and goes to bed.)
The film is ingenious on many levels, including how it intimately weaves together the lives of women living in three different generations and also in the depth of its messages.  One walks away from The Hours with the curious feeling of being heavy from the difficulty of its content yet uplifted by its message.",1065744000,2,1641,4.57679180887372
1443121,4,B00005JKTI,"The Hours is a richly woven tale of three women, living parallel lives decades apart, linked by a book written by Virginia Wolf, who is played deliciously by Nicole Kidman.
The storytelling is very clever - and very visual.  The dialog is very engaging.  But the tale - when swallowed from a man's point of view - is ultimately very unsatisfying.
It takes a while to discover this, but all of the women are gay.  The characters living in the past (Nicole and Julianne Moore) rail against their husbands, and the society that constrains them.  Both try to commit suicide, although only one eventually succeeds.
The person living in the present, Meryl Streep, is the only one who is ""out.""  She appears to be the happiest, although her imprisonment comes from the emotional pain she bears while caring for a famous poet -- and former lover -- Ed Harris, who is slowly dying from AIDS.
Pruriently, the best parts are definitely the kissing.  Julienne Moore kisses her neighbor - who reacts by retreating into oblivion.  Nicole grabs the face of her sister (yes, sister) and thrusts her face upon her.  The sister resists, but not as though they haven't done this before.
Meryl's turn comes towards the end of the movie, and her's is the most reciprocated.  She kisses her lover out of passion and thanks, as if to say to us, `Gee, how surely times have changed!'
I thought Nicole looked great with the fake nose, and watching her (as well as the other women) smooch was definitely an unexpected treat.  Unfortunately, I wasn't thrilled to endure another work where the men, although loving, end up as inevitable emblems of repression.
If, as a guy, one doesn't mind watching a film - while an accusing finger is seemingly pressed against your chest -- the Hours is a masterfully well crafted tale that is movie-making at its very finest.",1065744000,,1834,4.721003134796239

In the late 1940's, Julianne Moore plays a housewife who is at the same time reading ""Mrs. Dalloway"" and contemplating suicide. In present day, Meryl Streep plays a New York book editor who is caring for her sick and increasingly spiteful friend and former lover. The film deals with an incredible array of difficult issues. Almost all of the characters in the film display some kind of same-sex attraction, which many of them don't seem to know how to deal with (at one point Virginia shares a long and inappropriate kiss with her sister). And all three of the main characters are living on the edge of sanity, desperately trying to cope both with their roles as mothers and caretakers and with their own demons and unfulfilled desires. Although this is at times a very difficult film to watch, it's mostly because the pain and anguish of the characters is just so real, mosty due to the excellent performances by everyone in the film.

The music was overblown, relentlessly repetitive in its deceitful cadence that is supposedly alerting the audience to some imminent dramatic climax that never happens. Even poor Richard taking the final exit out of his own squalid apartment window was a quiet mercy instead of a thundering tragedy. Did anybody besides me wonder why tireless devoted Clarissa had not taken it upon herself to get a housekeeper for the poor guy, perhaps an aide to help him into the shower.
The waste of the talents of Miranda Richardson, Jeff Daniels, and Claire Danes in their trivialized roles really blew me away. Hope these fine actors were paid well to take a disproportionately distant back seat to Nicole, Julianne, and Meryl.

The direction, creation of imagery, and attention to detail is faultless (thanks to Stephen Daldry's theatrical experience I wonder) Everything about this film is exceptional, from the lines to the costumes to the masterful score. It's elegiac, profound, literate, thought provoking, moving and engaging. Oh, and you'll either get it or you wont. You'll either want to go on the journey with these three remarkable characters, or you'll want to dismiss it as a pretentious literary chick-flick - a criticism I've heard from many a misguided film critic or film goer. For my money, you're missing out on a masterpiece if you choose the latter. I can't say anything else that hasn't been said apart from - see it, devour it, think about it and then - watch it again. The power of this film is it will speak differently to you depending on when you watch it, where you watch it, who you watch it with, and what mood you're in that day.

If you're looking for a flick with tons of action and story line, this one is not for you.  It's definitely a classic ""chick flick.""
""The Hours"" follows a day in the life of three women living in three different eras of American History.
Nicole Kidman SHINES as Virginia Woolf, deep into the writing of her classic ""Mrs. Dalloway.""  The viewer peeks into Ms. Woolf's psyche as she wrestles with her own demons, fears, insecurities and joy and finally uses her experiences to make Mrs. Dalloway real.
Meryl Streep plays a lesbian woman living in modern times, struggling with what she perceives to be a mundane existence.  We follow her for a day as she prepares for a party while simultaneously caring for a friend who is dying of AIDS.  Streep brings her character's struggle to life with a stellar performance that is both convincing and touching.
Julianne Moore is a housewife in 1950s suburbia.  As a pregnant mother of one toddler and a devoted wife to her work-a-day husband, Moore's character yearns for something different.

1443141,5,B00005JKTI,"This is by far the best movie I have ever seen.  Most people say that I am exagerating and that it isn't that good of a movie, but I beg to differ.  This film perfectly weaves the three time periods so exquisitly that the message and emotion the book and movie try to create are there at every moment.  I think that a lot critics either saw it as a chick flick or thought it was boring, but if you look at the certain detail of every scene and every actress, you will find a treasure.
This movie can be a confusing setting, but the way director Stephen Daldry crafted the plots makes it a clear film.  It starts out with Virginia Woolfe's suicide.  Then it progresses to introduce the three women: Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) of 1951 who is living for her husband's sake and her son's sake and suffocating under the pressure to create a perfect household and a flawless image; second to appear again is Virginia Woolfe (Nicole Kidman), who is living according to what her docter's say and her husband wants; and finally, Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep) is a 2001 New York woman living to care for her best friend, Richard (Ed Harris), who is dying of AIDS.  Throughout the film, certain characters approach each woman at different times and help reveal that they are all living (and dying, somewhat) for other people.  This movie is about how they discover happiness and what this emotion requires.
I believe everyone should see this movie for the acting, alone.  Nicole Kidman proves herself to be a magnificent actress that is versatile and will continue to show her skill.  As Woolfe, she lets her inner-pain spill out and manifest itself in one of the most spectacular scenes of the movie.  Moore was the second best of three.  As Brown, a nearly silent role, she feels devastation that she was sucked into the life she has.  She really explains this through tears and facial expressions to the point where you have figured her out completely.  Streep plays Vaughn a.k.a. Mrs. Dalloway acording to Richard.  She literally is living for Richard.  Every day she goes to see him, and feed him, and care for him.  In the movie, she is buying flowers for him, bragging for him and planning a party for him.  Streep really grasps onto Clarrisa Vaughn's sense of unhappiness with life.  She has yet to learn what it is to live for herself.
Throughout the rest of the film there are many smaller performances that caught my eye.  The first of which is Laura Brown's friend Kitty, played by Acadamy Award nominated Toni Collette.  She resembles Mrs. Dalloway in Laura Brown's explanation.  She is a confident woman that suffers but does not show it.  Collette has an ability to really portray these feelings so well.  Another great supporting performance was Ed Harris'.  He successfully plays a dying man, slightly insane but one who recognizes Clarissa's problem.  John C. Reilly, the boy playing Laura Brown's son and Claire Daines all had shining moments.
Bottom Line: Everything about the making of this film and everything about the acting and the writing were all so hauntingly beautiful it stops you in your tracks and makes you realize that this is a classic of film making.

1443142,4,B00005JKTI,"'THE HOURS"" is a beautiful movie made from a well written but ugly story. 3 tragic lives have obvious connections. In the 1920's a woman writes a novel called ""Mrs. Dalloway"", the author lives a sad life. She is unhappy no matter where she lives. She believes moving back to London will make her happy. When in fact she was unhappy there the first time. In the 1950's, a house wife reads the novel ""Mrs Dalloway"". In the more recent year of 2001 a woman is alot like the character Mrs. Dalloway from the 1920's novel of the same name. In this segment of ""The Hours"" Ed Harris is superb as a middle aged man with AIDS. He's a writer who after becoming ill begins down a road of severe depression. In the 1920's, Nicole Kidman stars.. In the 50's.. Julianne Moore stars, and in the present day segment.. Meryl Streep stars. All 3 stories in time are masterfully weaved together. All our characters have so much in common, tragic things and wonderful things too. Now lets bring up Nicole Kidman's Oscar. Yes she performed beautifully. However was this role deserving of an Oscar in a leading role? Perhaps not, the role was one that I feel was not large enough for a leading role Oscar, and as Denzel Washington said as he gave her the award that night. ""Nicole Kidman by a nose!"" I love Nicole Kidman, but I would have rather seen her win an award for her flawless work in ""The Others"". With that being said her work here certainly didn't hurt the movie. Just about everything about this film is worth praising. 4 stars",1062547200,,1517,4.460431654676259
1443163,5,B00005JKTI,"This is one film that richly deserved its critical accolades, definitely worth owning, or at least repeated viewings.
The characters are nuanced, with multiple and conflicting drives---not the tidy and simplistic cardboard-cutouts Hollywood usually comes up with.  The three women---Streep, Moore, and Kidman---are flawlessly directed and lead three vaguely connected, but very parallel lives.  Streep and Moore's characters reminded me of so, so many women I've known, both friends and family: women who maintain a happy facade (Streep as a dynamic, cheerful socialite and Moore as a placid suburbian housewife) behind which they are desperately empty, sad, and unfulfilled.
Nicole Kidman puts in the finest performance of her career---I never would've expected it, given the usually vacuous roles she plays, but her Virginia Woolf is nothing short of amazing.  You can just feel the towering genius and passion behind the eerie, unhinged exterior.  Devoid of makeup and hair coloring, and wearing a bigger prosthetic nose, she actually looks a million times more attractive, and more human, than her usual generic-glam-blonde getup.
Woolf's suicide was a courageous refusal to live a life (in her case, one of chronic mental illness) that she didn't want, could not change and could not otherwise escape.  Ed Harris's character also chooses suicide, rather than watch himself die slowly from AIDS.  For them, suicide is the only remaining gateway to freedoom and wholeness.
Moore's character finds the only alternative to suicide is to desert her husband and children.  Only Streep's character dangles in the middle, mired in the same deep, gnawing and nameless discontent but not yet having found a way out.
What many viewers may find deeply disturbing is the subtext that true existential FREEDOM---a beaten-to-death buzzword after 9/11---is not only very precious but very elusive.  Why?  Because most of us do not pass the crucible, are simply not willing to pay the REAL price of freedom: leaving behind everything that chains us down.  Even if that means killing yourself, or walking out on your family, or coming out of the closet.  Unwilling to let go of our lives, we become trapped in the misery of this clinging cowardice, we become prisoners who can only sit and wait for Death to come and get us, counting the hours dragging by.

The DVD is a good one, with four informative mini-documentaries and two commentary tracks.  The commentaries -- one by Kidman, Streep, and Moore, and one by director Stephen Daldry and novelist Michael Cunningham -- are better than most commentaries, and shed a lot of light on the processes by which this film, which gets better with each viewing, was accomplished.",1061856000,3,594,5.103092783505154
1443165,5,B00005JKTI,"did u notice that almost all of the 1-star reviews of this movie are from guys? i wonder why...(plz notice that i'm being sarcastic). children who reviewed it and called it ""boring"" sadly must not be mature enough to understand the plot. but don't feel bad, i understand. i'm 13, and i think that this is one of the greatest films ever made. tons of people i know turn away from this movie because it focuses on the lives of three lesbians. but that really shouldn't turn you away, because it's an excellent movie, and beautifully shot.
nicole kidman portrays writer Virginia Woolf... in an Oscar winning role. Troubled, annoyed, spiteful Woolf appears in the first scene, committing suicide. the scene is amazingly shot, very well done. my favorite scene in the film containts Kidman as Woolf--the one where she and her neice have a funeral for a dead bird...soudns corny, i know, but it's really beautiful. Woolf's scenes take place in the 1920's and 40's.
julianne moore plays Laura Brown, a character who, in her prime, lived in the 1950's. Devoted (?) mother, wife and terrible cook, Brown soon discovers that her best friend is about to have her ovaries removed. Perhaps she's TOO good of a best friend...Brown happens to be reading a book by Woolf, entitled Mrs. Dalloway. if you ask me, moore should have at least been nominated for this role.
Meryl Streep (who, i'll have you know, is the greatest actress of ALL time) portrays Clarissa Vaughn, friend of a dying poet who has AIDs. She's determined to throw him a party, but on the set date, he says he doesn't want to go. Vaugn is forced to endure the horror and pain of watching her only male lover jump out of the window. Streep's character lives in modern day times, and I think she should've gotten an oscar nomination for this (then of course, I think she should get nominated for everything she's in...and win the awards, too!)

I was mesmerized from the first scene.  It is simply brilliant, and Streep, Kidman, Lewis and Harris are, without a doubt, four of the greatest living actors.  When the film was finished, I couldn't move.  I sat and stared at the blank screen, and I can't remember when, if ever, that's happened with another film.
The DVD extras are very nice, and include a documentary on Virginia Woolf and interviews with the three amazing women stars, but to be honest, I had to watch those later because I was so blown away by the film itself that I couldn't concentrate on the extra features afterwards.  I think it's nearly miraculous that every aspect of this film -- the writing, directing, cinematography, and every single actor -- is excellent.  I think it's a masterpiece.",1061683200,3,918,4.6234567901234565
1443167,2,B00005JKTI,"This is a slick film, but let's not let that confuse us into thinking that it povides any kind of meaning.  A number of reviewers seem to have been baffled, as I was, by the seemingly pointless kissing scenes.  Meryl Streep's kiss at least made some sense in the context of the script, but Julianna Moore's seems to have been entirely pointless, and just for shock value.  But nobody, nowadays, is shocked by same sex kissing scenes, which have been foisted on us so much as to have lost all significant attention-getting value, and, in fact, they are showing up with such regularity in today's films as to appear to be mere gratuitous nods to trendiness.

The many-layered quality of the movie is at first sight intriguing, but don't be fooled -- it soon becomes evident that it is only a facile device to make us think that the story is ""deep.""  Of course, the suggestion that most women are either overtly or secretly lesbians must surely make it ""deep,"" no?  Well...NO.  It's merely a tedious false premise that is fast getting really old, tiresome and predictable.

Although there are 3 layers, each of them is disappointingly shallow.  As each layer peels away we are left puzzled because there is nothing underneath. What WAS the Julianna Moore character's problem anyway?  Her potential solution and her actual solution were a bit extreme.  OK, so some people react in extreme ways to their lives.  Fine.  But why are we supposed to feel sorry for her or care?  Is it because she has the same mental problems as Virginia Woolf or because, like Woolf, she's bisexual? Is it one or the other, or both, and are these problems enough to make any real woman abandon her children and thus destroy them? Why would such a self-obsessed woman be a sympathetic character; does anyone know!?

The terrible ""aged"" makeup job didn't help. Hint to movie makeup artists: old people don't have toned wrinkled skin: they have sagging wringled skin.

This is one of those movies that made me wish I could take back the time I spent watching it to use for something more purposeful and/or rewarding -- like washing the dishes.

1443168,3,B00005JKTI,"""The Hours"" is a somber, moody, and unique film that you either find ""stunning"" or ""boring."" It shows one day in the lives of three women:  British author Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman), living in 1923, suffering from mental illness; fifties suburban housewife Laura,(Julianne Moore), who is also depressed and reading Woolf's novel, ""Mrs. Dalloway, and sophisticated New Yorker of 2001, Clarissa (Meryl Streep), whose nickname is ""Mrs. Dalloway.""

The three leading ladies are each wonderful and it would have been a toss-up for me to pick the one to win an Oscar. (Kidman got it.)  Ed Harris plays the man dying of AIDS and he is brilliant here.  Phillip Glass' musical score is subtle, delicate, and a perfect background to the inner turmoil of the three women.

The movie is so relentlessly low-key as to be dull and I didn't care what happened to the women.  None of them were particularly engaging or appealing to me. However, if you are a fan of Virginia Woolf, I think you would probably enjoy the film a great deal.",1061424000,,1024,4.7897727272727275

Usually a discriminating moviegoer has to go to the independent theaters to catch a quality movie.  I personally love ""timeline movies"", and this one was very cleverly done.

If you are taking the initiative to read customer reviews (Amazon.com customer reviewers are the some of the best reviewers I have ever seen, way better than the ""movie critics"", except for Roger Ebert, of course), you will find this movie thought-provoking and intriguing.",1061337600,5,581,5.225806451612903
1443170,2,B00005JKTI,"I had heard a lot of buzz about Nicole Kidman winning the Oscar for this movie, and the trailers made it sound interesting without revealing what it was really about. Curiosity got the best of me, so I watched it. Yes, the acting was excellent. The cinematography and editing were also well done. But the story is another matter.
On a surface level - this is NOT a spoiler - you could say The Hours is about suicide and lesbianism (or at the very least, sexual confusion). On a deeper level, it's really about living with the bad choices you've made. Yes, life has its dark moments. Yes, we make bad choices. Yes, we regret those choices. But I'm not particularly interested in seeing a movie that emphasizes the bad stuff of life. The Hours was the most depressing movie I have ever seen. I just could not find any redeeming value in it. If this was supposed to be some feminist empowerment film, it only succeeded in empowering women to ruin their lives.
Also, a movie with a bad ending totally ruins the whole thing for me. I found the ending of The Hours not only unsatisfying, but downright disturbing. It doesn't bother me when movies end on a sad note or the main character dies or something bad happens, but there's usually a glimmer of hope or goodness in the plot somewhere. I found none here. Generally, I watch movies to be entertained, to be distracted, to be moved, to be educated at times, even sometimes to simply appreciate the art of the film medium, but always to enjoy. Unfortunately, while The Hours was somewhat interesting on an ""artsy"" level, it wasn't worth my time to see what all the buzz was about. It left me empty.

1443172,5,B00005JKTI,"I had to chuckle when I saw the disparate reviews, from those who loved and those who hated The Hours.  I did not know what to expect when I saw The Hours.  I had not read the novel, because I do not usually read any contemporary fiction.  Perhaps the planets were aligned in some such way, but I was completely floored by The Hours!  There are so many layers, you could keep peeling and peeling and dissecting for a very long time.  And, if you enjoy that sort of thing, then it is right up your alley.  If you don't enjoy introspection, and symbolism, and the study of the human experience, then you will be bored to tears!  I happen to love that sort of thing.  Asking questions - - why am I here, who am I, what does it all mean - - and questioning my roles - - wife, mother, friend, daughter, sister, employee, volunteer, female extraordinaire! - - and wondering `What If?' every now and then...  In The Hours, though, the layers are thick and heavy, so expect to work.  And if you are prone to depression, this could possibly bring you lower, although I found it rather satisfying and uplifting by the end of it.  While I personally did not agree with many of the choices made by the characters, they were choices nonetheless, life paths anyone could take, and not without repercussions.
As for the performances, every actor was superb.  Nicole Kidman has my full respect as an actress due to this film.  I completely forgot it was Nicole Kidman while I was watching the film.  Julianne Moore was fantastic as the housewife trapped in the 50s, and Meryl Streep managed to excellently portray the modern feminist who is just as scared and trapped inside as the 50s housewife.  The little boy who played Julianne Moore's young son was superb - - he conveyed so much just through his eyes.  Such excellent casting all the way around.  The music was also a huge influence on the film, haunting and repetitive, subtly infusing the atmosphere without being intrusive.  The whole experience was just enthralling!
It has been nearly 6 months since I saw The Hours, and I still think about it.  I've now read the novel, and have an even more in-depth feel for what it is all about.  I don't feel the time spent was an exercise in futility, I think I am more enriched and receptive because of The Hours.",1060732800,6,2299,4.480769230769231

The people that hated this movie probably only watch action stuff, and can't handle anything deeper than that. Now, the movie itself wasn't boring, for me, anyway. People who said nothing happened, probably didn't even watch the damn thing. Many things happen, but they don't hit you in the face. They are natural. Even when the main characters kiss other women, it all seems natural. The story moves along, and when it was finished, I didn't feel it was too long at all.

Their stories interweave with one another and there are common themes of mental illness, lesbianism and unhappy women with death wishes.  Not exactly light entertainment!

The screenwriting, on the other hand, left this viewer feeling like someone who ate good side dishes but was never provided the main course.
I agree that the director successfully interwove the lives of three women from dissimilar time periods to create three situationally identical stories in one feature. On the down side, watching The Hours had me observing predominant emotions whose origins were scantily put forth. For instance, Virginia Woolf was looking for new avenues of adventure and exploration; that's the easy part. Why she was driven to her points of despair I really could not determine. That is, were her depression and search for independence and, eventually, suicide, unfortunate byproducts of a woman who was living in the wrong place at the wrong time, or (and I don't mean to be ugly about this) were they the inevitable outcomes of someone who had too much time on her hands?
Again, much attention was paid to the inner struggles, but the causes of them were not really put forth, because it was not revealed to what degree each character interacted with society. So you could not tell if their psychological adversities were struggles from without (Was society that bad for each?) or developments that came from within (changes that might come with age or declining health), or both.

Because the book is so extraordinary, I was apprehensive about how the film, based on this complex novel, could possibly succeed. David Hare performed a miracle in writing this true and beautiful adaptation, in a manner faithful to the book, and also suited for the big screen. He captured everything, including the important literary allusions, with great sensitivity and fidelity. Stephen Daldry's direction encouraged the superb talents of his ensemble cast. Daldry has once again proven to be a master of his craft.
The film is a richly told, often tragic story, of the interwoven lives of three women, from three different periods in time. The common thread is Virginia Woolfe's novel Mrs. Dalloway.
Virginia Woolfe, brilliantly portrayed by Nicole Kidman, is living in isolation with her husband Leonard in 1923. Ms. Woolfe has a long history of mental illness, and has attempted suicide twice. Her doctors and her husband agree that she will possibly find peace away from London. The literary couple is living in Richmond, where Leonard has set up a printing press, thinking to involve his wife in publishing. She has begun to write ""Mrs. Dalloway,"" the story of a day in the life of one woman, Clarissa Dalloway, ""a woman's whole life in a single day - and in that day her whole life."" Virginia is plainly fixated on death. She understands the nature of her illness, and at one point explains to Leonard that although he must live with the burden of her illness, so must she. She decides that someone in her new novel must die. When Richard asks who will die, and why, Virginia responds,""...the poet, the visionary will die, so that the others will value life more.""
Laura Brown, (Julianne Moore), is a young housewife, pregnant with her second child, in post-World War II, Los Angles. She is desperately unhappy in her marriage. Her husband, a war veteran, clearly worships her. Their young son, with a child's intense perception, senses the tension and unhappiness in his mother, that his father seems oblivious to. Laura begins reading Virginia Woolfe's Mrs. Dalloway, and is deeply affected by the novel. She begins to have doubts about her life choices, and despairs that suicide may be her only way out.
Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep), lives in contemporary Manhattan, and is an editor and writer. She could be a mirror image of a modern Mrs. Dalloway. Her closest friend, and former lover, Richard, a novelist and poet, actually calls Clarissa, ""Mrs. Dalloway."" Like Woolfe's Mrs. Dalloway, Clarissa is giving a party, for Richard, who is about to receive a prestigious lifetime achievement award for his poetry. She sets off one beautiful morning, like Mrs. Dalloway, to buy flowers for her party. Then she visits Richard, whom she has taken care of for years. He is slowly dying of AIDS.
The intermingling of the three women's lives, and their struggle to find meaning, outside of brief moments of happiness, is very powerful. The visual montage of the three women, is superb and so effective. It is almost a collage at times. The musical score is haunting, and adds much to the film's mood. And the acting is superior, not just by the three women, but by the entire supporting cast.
The tension builds toward a powerful ending, which even though I read the book, still came as a surprise. This is a deeply moving film, about living out the hours of ones life, about love, survival, and about mental illness and creativity. I highly recommended it!",1059868800,8,3645,4.9092382495948135
1443197,4,B00005JKTI,"A Film By Stephen Daldry
The Hours is based on the Pulitzer Prize Winning novel by Michael Cunningham.  The movie stars Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep.  It was nominated for 9 Academy Awards and Nicole Kidman won for Best Actress.  Also nominated were Julianne Moore and Ed Harris for their supporting roles.  It was nominated for Best Picture and Best Director.  This is a film with a high class pedigree.
This film follows three women in three different time periods.  In the end, The Hours is really telling just one story and each of the time periods contributes to it.  We have Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) in 1923 England, Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) in 1951 California, and Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep) in 2001 New York.  The film does not have a story so much as it deals with issues revolving around the lives of these women: depression, suicide, death, and family.  The Hours does so in a way that is deeply personal but never pushes any viewpoint down the viewer's throat.
Virginia Woolf is dealing with her personal issues of mental isolation as she writes Mrs. Dalloway.  She deals with depression and a desire to die to silence the voices in her head.  Laura Brown is a housewife who has to deal with a faltering relationship with her husband and she feels a kinship with the character of Mrs Dalloway in Woolf's novel (which she is reading).  Clarissa Vaughn is living in New York City, and it seems that she is living the life of Mrs Dalloway.  The movie features supporting performances by John C Reilly, Ed Harris, Claire Danes, Alison Janney, Miranda Richardson, Toni Collette, and Stephen Dillane.
This is the type of film that is made for the Academy Awards but really only has a specialized audience outside the Award circuit.  Critics love The Hours, but it is a slow moving drama and this will not appeal to everyone.  It is extremely well done, make no mistake about that, but this is not the movie to go to if you are looking for escapism.  This is the movie to go to when you are looking to think critically about the film and what it is saying about the human condition.",1059609600,6,2119,4.625668449197861

I have nothing but the highest respect for Nicole Kidman as an actress, and donning a fake nose to tone down her pretty face was a wonderful choice. Julianne Moore, who I believe was the real star of this film, just goes to show how dialogue is secondary to body language and facial expressions. She says very little, but she carrys the film. Meryl Streep, of course, does an excellent job as well - her breakdown with in the kitchen was very believable. And you know the acting must be good with a supporting cast like Claire Danes, Ed Harris, and John C. Riley, all of whom do incredible, incredible jobs.
This is a movie of atmosphere, of characters. It has hardly any action at all - buying flowers becomes a big event. The whole mood of the movie is dark - not exactly depressed, but teetering on the edge. These women haven't exactly given up, but they are close to breaking, and so is the viewer.
Perhaps the best thing about this movie was the ending. One woman said ""Well that was just depressing."" In actuality, I think this film was very uplifting, almost life-affirming. ""The poet."" Says Virginia, ""The poet must die, so that others can better appreciate life.""
I didn't really care for the lesbian overtones, but they weren't too bad. This is not a movie for a good time, or a laugh.

1443254,5,B00005JKTI,"""The Hours,"" directed by Stephen Daldry, is an ambitious film that tells the interwoven stories of three different women in three different decades: writer Virginia Woolf (played by Nicole Kidman) in 1923, housewife Laura (Julianne Moore) in 1951, and Clarissa (Meryl Streep), who is caring for a dying friend, in 2001.
First and foremost, this film is a triple triumph for three of the greatest actresses of our time.  Kidman, Moore, and Streep give complex, emotionally rich performances.  They are backed by an astonishing supporting cast that includes Toni Collette, John C. Reilly, and Ed Harris.  Jack Rovello is particularly amazing as Laura's young son.
The DVD version of the film is full of terrific bonus features, including documentary featurettes and two full-length commentaries (one by Kidman, Moore, and Streep; one by director Daldry and novelist Michael Cunningham).  These great extras made me savor this beautiful film even more.
""The Hours"" is about many things: the magical, transcendent connection between writer and reader; struggling with illness, whether mental or physical; making choices in one's life; etc.  The chronologically separate stories are skillfully and seamlessly woven together.  The film presents a complex tapestry of human relationships and emotions.  It offers no easy answers, but rather challenges the viewer.  Yet in the end it is an emotionally full and satisfying journey.",1058659200,21,1422,5.461187214611872

It doesn't have your standard action sequences, male to female love interests, cute fuzzy animals, etc., etc.  It's a depressive look at 3 lives that are worth looking at because these sorts of people have been and are now in our society.

1443256,5,B00005JKTI,"""The Hours"" is one the greatest examples in film history of three actresses in the same film achieving Oscar level pinnacles.  While only one, Nicole Kidman, would secure a statuette for ""Best Actress,"" Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep performed at an equivalent level of brilliance.
Based on a Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Michael Cunningham, the story revolves around the creative act of novelist Virginia Woolf, played by Kidman, writing her most memorable work, ""Mrs. Dalloway,"" along with the impact that work had on other people at later points in time.  The book is referred to as a point of reference by Julianne Moore in her suburban Los Angeles housewife's life of 1951 and by Meryl Streep in 2000 Greenwich Village New York, where she functions as a book editor and seeks to comfort former lover Ed Harris, a brilliant poet who is dying of aids.  While Streep seeks to enhance Harris' desire to live by telling him that, by taking his pills he can live a good while longer, he reflects on what he sees as the hopelessness of his condition.
We ultimately learn that the little boy who fears that his mother, played by Moore, will leave him, is actually Haris in his youth.  Feeling the same doubts about life that Kidman experiences as Woolf while she writes what will become her most famous work, Moore goes to a hotel room with the idea of swallowing enough pills to commit suicide.  Moore decides not to go through with the suicide attempt, but later, after she has the child she is carrying, leaves her husband, her newly born daughter, and young son, who later, as a sensitive poet and novelist, carries the burden of that rejection with him.
Top British dramatist David Hare adapted Cunningham's novel superbly, giving a brilliantly cerebral written work a visual feel, while Steven Daldry directed with a skilled but never interfering hand, letting the brilliant performers establish their own respective voices.  What makes this film so unique is the way that a creative artist's impact is shown through the lives of people at another point in time living in another country, who are sensitively attuned to the pain the author felt as she grappled with the question of life and whether or not to continue living it.",1058313600,6,2235,4.822454308093994

1443259,1,B00005JKTI,"""The Hours"" is an angst-ridden, overacted, impossibly written mess.  I cannot understand how so many people could find it  compelling.  From the moment that Ed Harris falls to his doom, the movie becomes a convoluted, ignorant joke.  The final sequences in the movie are so questionable and impossible that it defies description.  Can so many charcters be so unlikable in one movie?  The answer, unfortunately, is ""yes.""  Why the heck is Meryl Streep's character gay... when she clearly has a thing for Ed Harris' character?  Just why does Julianne Moore's character seem so close to a breakdown, yet miraculously ""chooses life"" by becoming a librarian in Canada and somehow becomes an all-powerful woman?  Why on earth does the Ed Harris character tell people his mom committed suicide when he knows she did not?  This is such an immature movie trick... and this was up for umpteen Oscars!
If one word can describe this movie best, it's ""goofy.""  It tries so hard to be profound and deep that it makes one want to rent an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie (well, almost). And, don't say that just because I'm male that I can't ""understand"" this movie.  Frankly, I don't think that just because someone is female, that they should be bored senseless, either.  This movie has ""earned"" one star because I expected so much more, what with the stars in the film, all the fine press it received, and all of the awards it was up for.  What a letdown!

The pain of living with depression in unforgettably portrayed by Julianne Moore, whose suffering amid a reasonably secure and comfortable life jumps off the screen.  Making her perfectly sweet husband a birthday cake, talking to her child, getting out of bed--these simple acts make her character desperately tired and unhappy.  As it happens, she inflicts her pain on others, and it is made clear the damage she causes.  Yet, you don't see her as the villain, because it is so clear that she can't control how she feels and what her feelings make her do.  The other two ""linked"" stories involving Nicole Kidman as V. Woolf, and Meryl Streep as a contemporary woman planning a party for a dying friend and ex-lover, are less compelling, but as the story unfolds, you see that they are both really players in Moore's drama, which is the center of the story. The movie is flawlessly made, and manages to stay interesting, even lively, despite what I'm sure sounds to you like an emotional soup of wallowing.  Men certainly do suffer from depression, but if you've ever known anyone who was depressed who happened to be a woman, this movie will resonate.",1057881600,3,1303,4.811659192825112

One minor complaint I have is, I sort of wish the whole movie would have been about Nicole Kidman's character. I was fascinated with that particular story the most. Nicole Kidman has sure proved herself to be a brilliant performer. My favourite scene was when Virginia Woolf lays her head down by the dying bird and just stares into it's eyes. The camera angle was incredible and evoked just the right emotion it was trying to convey. It almost made me cry. This film's underlying theme is death, but it approaches this dark subject matter with grace and dignity.

But what really holds this movie together is the editing.  It was actually done perfectly. The movie took three similar, yet separate stories and wove them together effortlessly.
Meryl Streep can do no wrong and does a wonderful job.  As does Julianne Moore - in a very understated role that is not as similar to 'Far From Heaven' as reviewers led one to believe.  But I have to say - Nicole Kidman was extremely good.  Maybe she seemed so b/c I have never really cared for most anything she's been in.  Forget what you've heard about 'the nose' - it does not distract from her performance.
Even Philip Glass' music fits the piece - and I don't care for his music all that much.  He did a good job too.

1443284,5,B00005JKTI,"The Hours
From a Pulitzer Prize winning book comes the movie event of the year. Imagine the lives of three separate women, each a reflection of the others, intertwined yet fiercely independent, and you have the cinematic masterpiece of ""The Hours"".
Virginia Woolf. Laura Brown. Clarissa Vaughn. Two fictional, one is real. Three women who live a day in their lives that is a day that is their life. In her day, Woolf starts writing one of her masterpieces, ""Mrs. Dalloway"", which in her day, Laura Brown starts reading, which in her day, Clarissa Vaughn is living.
This unique, tri-layered story allows for complexity not often found in film: writer, reader, and character, honoring each spirit wholly and totally. This powered the plot of the book, and the movie successfully managed to honor that device. When one thing happens to a character, it may or may not show up in another character's story. Part of the pleasure and surprise of watching ""The Hours"" is trying to find those story elements mirrored in each other's story, and this lends itself to multiple watchings.
Whereas the story is unique, it's the beauty of the moments in ""The Hours"" that stun and awe any watcher. The buying of flowers. A funeral for a bird. A brief, questioning kiss. Despair in a hotel room. This isn't a film that has you at the edge of your seat, waiting for the next exciting, thrill seeking moment to grab you, but one that draws you in slowly, completely, as you wait to discover the blossoming of each of these women.
What is thrilling is the performances. Nicole Kidman, almost unrecognizable as Woolf, has created a completely nuanced character. She is real, alive, complex. Try watching her performance and remembering her fantastic turn in ""Moulin Rouge"", and you'll appreciate her talent. Julianne Moore's internal pain as Laura Brown is so realized, it's palpable. Meryl Streep brings to reality a crumbling Clarissa with both dignity and pain. Clearly, these three complicated roles needed equally talented actresses.
Some people may be put off by the film's subject matter, or pacing. But ""The Hours"" is a film that demands repeated viewings to appreciate everything it has to offer, which is, one of the best cinematic events in recent history.",1057708800,3,2246,4.928759894459103

The Hours is a dark, elegant and sinister film that questions it's characters and the actions they take in life.  You don't have to be an older woman to enjoy this movie either.  I am a teenage guy, and I found a lot to admire in this movie from the acting, to Philip Glass's score, and the fine editing.
Also, some reviewers are questioning the message of the film.  To people who are confused out there: NO, The Hours is not saying every deperssed housewife is a lesbian, or that suicide is noble and good.  Also, it is not saying that it is heroic to abandon your family.  If you're too dumb to pick up on the main themes, then maybe you souldn't be watching a movie of this caliber in the first place.
If you are interested to see a good film, no matter what gender or age you are, I do suggest picking up The Hours.  It's definetly worth a look if you enjoy fine cinema.",1057536000,6,1088,4.252427184466019

The movie starts out with three different epilogues in three different years: Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) in 1923, Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) in 1951, and Clarissa Dalloway (Meryl Streep) in 2001. Virginia is introduced as a mentally unstable author under a doctor's care, and the woman in her latest book is living vicariously through Laura Brown, who picks up the book in '51 and is seen reading it throughout the movie.
After twenty or so minutes into the movie, I figured the three stories going on would intertwine somewhere along the line (despite it being different years), but I still couldn't quite understand how Clarissa's life connected to the other characters' - that is, until near the end of the movie. I won't give away what Clarissa's connection is, because trust me, you'll know. And when you find out, you'll probably give a great big, ""OH!""
Nicole Kidman was very deserving in the awards she received for the part of Virginia Woolf, but like I said in my title, I think just about everyone should have won awards; especially Ed Harris, who played the part of Richard. I enjoyed everything about this movie, although I didn't quite understand the kissing scenes. But maybe that's just me. If you don't own The Hours, at least watch it once.

1443288,5,B00005JKTI,"""The Hours"" may or may not be the best English-language movie to have been released in 2002, but it is, to me, the most exquisite and delicate. As such, it is not designed to be a commercial movie for mass consumption; indeed, its relative box office success can probably be attributed to its powerhouse cast, led by Nicole Kidman, Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore. To people who love great acting, any one of these women in a movie makes it worth seeing. To have all three together is rather intimidating, and that fact, I believe, is what lead to some of the movie's negative reviews since, with that much talent, a project can be seen as all about the stars. Adding to the talent overload are such marvelous actors as Miranda Richardson, Claire Danes, Ed Harris, John C. Reilly, Toni Collette, Allison Janney and Stephen Dillane.
The movie, based on a Pulitzer prize winning novel, contains three stories which touch upon each other but rarely actually connect, the common thread being English author Virginia Woolf [Kidman] and her novel, `Mrs. Dalloway"". Woolf was a brilliant writer who suffered from severe mental illness. She committed suicide in 1941 when she finally could no long cope with her disease. There is the story of Laura Brown [Moore], set in 1951, in which the character, who is reading Woolf's book, toys with the idea of suicide. The last story revolves around Clarissa Vaughn [Streep]. Set in present day, it is about her relationship with her ex-lover [Ed Harris], who is dying from AIDS and whose only out seems to be to kill himself. On the surface, all this dallying with suicide may seem grim and depressing, the movie is actually life-affirming, but, as I've said, it's not meant for mass consumption.
Kidman deserved her Oscar for Best Actress in ""The Hours"". Like Bette Davis before her, she is always willing to take on an acting challenge. Here, having donned a prosthetic nose, she is barely recognizable. Still, I wish there were an Oscar for Best Ensemble Acting because that is the one ""The Hours"" should have received because each remarkable individual performance adds to the power of the film as a whole.",1057449600,42,2145,4.815718157181572

1443290,5,B00005JKTI,"Synopsis: Three women across three different generations simultaneously explore their own personal angst.
I'm not surprised that the back cover of the DVD has no description of the movie itself. It's hard to get a feel for it at first. Juggling three different timeframes and three story lines is a bit much when there's little to go on. However, as the film progress, the picture comes into focus clearly enough ... at least for those of us who can relate to the heroines of the story.
The Hours does a remarkable job of making the audience feel the restlessness and dissatisfaction of the main characters. Virginia is housewife of the 1920's tormented by what comes across as schizophrenic tendencies. Laura, a housewife of the 1950's, is burdened by family expectations she feels incompetent to fulfill. Clarissa is a modern day woman torn between feelings for an ill ex-lover/current friend (male) and her longtime significant other (female).
All three stories are told simultaneously. Once you get used to the rhythm of the changes, the method becomes refreshing. Three completely different women with three completely different problems interconnect by way of their common angst and feelings of futility in the face of life. Their differences become insignificant as their similarities begin to show.
The Hours manages to express the inexpressable devastation of human emotional pain thanks to the superb acting abilities of Julianne Moore (Virginia), Nicole Kidman (Laura) and Merle Streep (Clarissa). Kudos to director Stephen Daldry too!",1057449600,3,1546,5.288617886178862

I am tired of everybody focusing on Woolf's death and illness more than on her life and work. In ""The Hours,"" even her novel comes across as suffused with the aimless futility of the film. And if we wanted to be accurate, why not show Woolf in her occasional ""riding the crest of the wave"" phase of bipolar disorder, instead of always so moony and depressingly wise.

Woolf's work is varied and rich and provides the movement and life that this movie does not have by a long shot. I did not like the scene where Meryl Streep collapses in the kitchen in front of her gay friend's gay lover--the message of ""The Hours"" in this scene seemed to be : ""Look what women have to put up with; watch them go hysterical."" ... The moment you walk out of the movie theatre/turn off the tape you know that you are destined to trace a circle like the poor chumps in ""The Hours"", and after a while, when you've fumed enough about poor Woolf's legacy being perverted (in my view *not* too strong a word) by this stuff.....

You go back to reading ""A Room of One's Own,"" ""Orlando,"" ""To the Lighthouse."" You go back to being happy you got ""Mrs. Dalloway"" the novel before they put that ""Michael Cunningham ..."" button on it. What makes me angry is that people will now buy ""Mrs. Dalloway"" expecting something totally different. They will be disappointed and stop at page 3 or worse, finish the novel through a haze of duty. Then they will put in it on the same shelf that contains another similarly unreadable book, ""Ulysses."" Why does no one pick on James Joyce to this terrible extent?! Let me clarify: *Mrs. Dalloway* is on my top 10 list and Cunningham has used it to harp out his worldview.

By the way, Woolf's suicide was (as they often are) more complicated, and had something to do with the fact that the Allies seemed to be losing the war in 1941....

But damned if you can see it here. In short: those who like this movie will languish in complacency, having been presented with all they already agreed with (they will laud it to the skies for this); whilst those who don't like it, will hate it for all the liberal propaganda (or in my mom's case, also for reminding her of her own illness).

Hmmm I am depressed now, too.... At no dialogue, no opportunity for change.... Always the staleness, always the complacent liberal ideology, always....the hours.....

While she wants desperately to return to a more stimulating environment in London, the ideas for her next novel ""Mrs. Dalloway"" begin to form in her mind. In 1951 Los Angeles, Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) is a housewife with a loving husband and engaging little boy. But that life is unsuited to her and, finding it  unbearable, she seeks refuge in Woolf's novel ""Mrs. Dalloway"". In New York City 2001, Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep) is planning a party for an old friend. Her friend, a poet named Richard (Ed Harris), nicknamed her ""Mrs. Dalloway"" when they were young. Now he is dying, and Clarissa is left to reflect on their relationship and the life she has made for herself.

""The  Hours"" is a character study of these three women, based on the novel by Michael Cunningham. The three women are very different in character and circumstance, but are linked, not only by ""Mrs. Dalloway"", but by their emotional isolation and the thoughts of death that engulf them. ""The Hours"" shows us only one day in the lives of each of these characters. We learn enough about them to make them interesting, but not so much as to  make them tedious. The performances by Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore, and Meryl Streep, as well as the supporting cast, are excellent. Much has been made of the prosthetic nose which Nicole Kidman donned for her role as Virginia Woolf, and she truly is unrecognizable in the film. But it is her voice, which is changed as radically as her face, which transforms her into Woolf. Her performance really is impressive and may be her best work to date. Kidman easily holds her own next to the more experienced and acclaimed thespians, Streep and Moore.

One is Virginia Woolf(Nicole Kidman) who is living in 1931, and is writing her book, Mrs. Dalloway.  Virginia also has some problems though, in that she hears voices, and is also suicidal.  The next is Laura Brown(Julianne Moore) who is living in 1949.  She is a pregnant houswife, who has a loving husband(John C. Reily) and a young son.  However, she is unhappy with her life for various reasons, and is contemplating suicide.  She is planning to make a cake for her husband, and seems to be broken up about many different things.  Then, there is Clarissa Vaughn(Meryl Streep), a lesbian who is planning a dinner party that night for Richard(Ed Harris)her ex-lover, who has just won the top prize for poetry writing, and is also dieing from AIDS.
What makes the film work so well is the acting.  A film like this requires that we care about the characters.  The dialouge is well written and the acting is off the charts.  Without brilliant performances, this film would not be nearly as good as it is.  The reason acting is the key factor in this film is because 99% of the film is dialouge.  There's no action, no sex, or anything other than the characters talking.  That's just fine with me.
I found everyone in the film so intriguing and intresting.  The film is two hours, but I felt as though it could've gone on for another two hours and I still wouldn't have been board.
Another highlight of the film is the beautiful score from composer Philip Glass, whose music makes the scenes complete.  It fits the film too, because most of the music is like someone gradually gaining anger or frustration, and then exploding or wanting to explode.
Nicole Kidman won Best Actress for this film at the oscars, and rightfully so.  She is great as Virginia...but everyone else is equally great.  This is such a complete cast.
""The Hours"" was my second favorite film of 2002, only behind Steven Spielberg's brilliant masterpiece ""Minority Report"".  This film is one that you see, and cannot forget.",1056931200,5,2096,4.664850136239782
1443333,3,B00005JKTI,"I checked out ""The Hours"" because the movie was so highly touted by the critics.  Although I concur with the critics that the acting by Nicole Kidman, et al. was superb, I found the movie to be morally sterile and bankrupt, its main characters selfish, despairing of life (although for unexplained reasons), and extremely self-absorbed.
In the movie, the Nicole Kidman character (feminist-lesbian author Virginia Wolf)found life so unworthwhile that she committed suicide, although she had insisted in her suicide note that she and her husband had a great love and were happy together.  She must have known that her suicide would be immensely hurtful to her husband.  But never once was she concerned about him; instead, it's all about her.  Similarly, the character played by Moore abandoned a devoted husband, a precocious young boy who adored her, and a newborn girl--because she found suburban life as a housewife ""stifling."" Not only did her abandonment wreak a permanent emotional injury in her son, the movie did not inform us whether her ""liberated"" life was any better or meaningful or fulfilling.
Frankly, I am surprised that no review I read had noted this about ""The Hours.""  Instead, the reviews celebrated the movie--and in so doing, I can only assume that the reviewers also endorsed the movie's implicit narcissistic message that ""If you're unhappy with your life, the solution is simply to end it, whether by suicide or physical abandonment of your family--regardless of the impact on those who love you.""",1056931200,5,1522,5.096385542168675

So if you want to laugh and watch a light type of movie, this is not for you!  Julianne Moore gave such a brilliant performance as a depressed housewife in the 50's - she really should have won the Oscar!  The other actors were brilliant as well.
My husband and teenage son absolutely hated this movie - so I must say that it definitely goes into the chick flick group.  It deals so much with feminine issues that most men will not be able to understand it.  But I found it haunting and thought provoking.",1056844800,,666,4.2047244094488185

a wonderful film! i wish i could find a better word to describe it! you just HAVE to see it. and if you decide to get the DVD i assure you it's worth it. It's packed with special features, no not the kind you have to read yourself, these are interview, commentaries and even a special feature about Virginia Woolf herself!",1056844800,,779,4.23489932885906
1443336,5,B00005JKTI,"I went into the Oscars this year only having strong feelings about Conrad Hall and Thomas Newman for ""Road to Perdition"" in the categories of Cinematography and Original Score respectively and ended up one for two (Hall won his final Oscar posthumously but Newman lost out to Elliot Goldenthal for ""Frieda"").  However, I know want to be retroactively be outraged that David Hare did not pick up the little golden dude for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published for the seamless way in which he weaved together the three stories of three women in three different times and places that make up ""The Hours.""  By the point in the opening credits when Nicole Kidman's Virginia Woolf and Meryl Streep's Clarissa Vaughan both put up their hair for the day sixty years apart while in a time in between Julianne Moore's Laura Brown picks up the copy of ""Mrs. Dalloway"" that she is reading, the conceit is firmly established in our mind.
Granted, I may well find this particularly effective because I have consumed more than my fair share of twisted time travel tales, so unconventional narrative form violating rules of time and space (American montage from start to finish) does not inherently confuse me.  Instead, I found ""The Hours"" (the working title of Woolf's ""Mrs. Dalloway"") to be intellectually engaging.  Hare is presenting the stories in Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer Prize winning novel as parts of a puzzle.  Laura Brown feels that Woolf's novel is speaking to her on a deep and personal level, reading in it an impulse towards suicide; after all, Woolf ended her life by loading stones into her coat and drowning herself in the river outside her Sussex home.  But Hare's screenplay has Woolf reconsidering the ending to her novel and the question of which character should be fated to die, and that shift in thinking resonates through the years to Brown's situation.  The parallels with Clarissa Vaughan are decidedly different as she ministers to her ex-husband Richard (Ed Harris), a poet of intense bitterness dying of AIDS, and who insists on calling her ""Mrs. Dalloway.""  Not only does she share the same first name as Woolf's character, this Clarissa is also preparing to host a party, as is Brown.  The parties are quite different, but each character examines their life in light of preparing for the event.  Of course one party will happen and the other will not, but these divergent paths will ultimately unite as the narratives finally come together.
The performances in ""The Hours"" are as stellar as the cast, which is certainly not surprising.  I found myself thinking that they should not have listed the cast in the opening credits because as the list of names goes by after the big three (Ed Harris, Stephen Dillane, Miranda Richardson, Toni Collette, Allison Janney,  Jeff Daniels, Claire Danes and John C. Reilly, who only managed to be in three of the five Oscar nominated films for Best Picture) is sort of distracts you from the way the film is setting the stage for the drama (compare with the way ""Playing by Heart"" introduces us to an equally stellar cast).  The DVD offers two superb commentary tracks, the first featuring actresses Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore, and Meryl Streep doing tag team commentaries on their scenes, while the second offers screenwriter Hare and director Stephen Daldry (""Billy Elliot"").  They offer insights into how this finely crafted jewel of a film came into being.  You should make a point of sitting through both of those before you even bother going to the bonus disc.  In the final analysis, perhaps the greatest ironic truth of this film that is adapted from one novel which was inspired a classic novel is that it is such a literate film.",1056844800,,3742,4.897151898734177

1443338,5,B00005JKTI,"After reading THE HOURS by Michael Cunningham I took a respite from reading, so very superb was his book that I didn't want to share brain space with anything else.  Then seeing the film adaptation spurred me on to reading MRS DALLOWAY yet again.  Now the DVD is out and I rank THE HOURS with my top five movie favorites.  Cunningham's genius-quality response to Virginia Woolf's novel, MRS DALLOWAY, successfully admixes one day in the lives of three women from different times - Virginia Woolf in 1923 as she devises her novel and the characters' fates; Laura Brown a fragile housewife/mother teetering on self destruction, and Clarissa Vaughn in 2001 an editor and mother in a longterm lesbian relationship - planning a ""Mrs. Dalloway""-type party for her AIDS ridden poet friend Richard. David Hare has written a screenplay that seamlessly weaves these three women's lives through the hours of one day: Virginia Woolf inhales, Clarissa exhales, Laura Brown stares into the same type space as both Virginia and Clarissa.  The result is a wondrous, intimate exploration of the value of living, a value than can without censure include taking one's own life.  The dialogue is mesmerizing, a script (and book) that leaves you wishing you could memorize each word and line.  Every one of the ""company"" roles is acted (and directed) with uncanny finesse - Toni Colette, Ed Harris, Allyson Janney, Charles Reilly  - all of them.  The Phillip Glass music score is the perfect choice to meld these ingredients into an unforgetable film.  Another great joy of buying this DVD is the additional history of Virginia Woolf and the Bloomsbury Group, the enlightened (for once) dialogue among Nicole Kidman, Myrl Streep, and Julianne Moore, and the comments by composer Glass, writers Cunningham and Hare, and director Daldry paying homage to a project which all began with Virginia Woolf.  I cannot recommend this movie/DVD more highly. It is simply and uniquely  exquisite.",1056585600,,1963,5.065217391304348

I didn't know much about the movie, and when i watched it I found myself concentrating hard just to try to figure out what I was seeing. In the end it all began to make some sense, but I still feel I am missing something. It was very good to watch with excellent acting performances throughout. I would recommend learning a bit about the book or the plot before seeing it.",1056412800,3,435,4.190476190476191
1443370,1,B00005JKTI,"OK - my admiration for the author of ""To the Lighthouse"" approaches reverence, so I was skeptical of Cunningham's ""The Hours"" (too cute, surely), but I picked it up & was entranced:  a ghostly fugue of themes at the heart of Woolf's work, amazingly well done.
So I was looking forward to the film, knowing of course it wouldn't be as good as the book.  But it was awful beyond all conception.  The evil entities in charge of this film had one mental characterization of all 3 women:  ""hysterical.""  And that's what we get.
How else to explain having Clarissa break down in the kitchen, when in the book it's Lucas, a man?  How else to explain turning Laura's visit to the hotel (just to get to read alone) into a suicide attempt?  How else to explain turning the cool, collected Virginia into a babbling nutcase?
(The worst part, which almost made my wife walk out, was turning Vanessa Bell into a socialite who regards her sister like some kind of hippie loony.  There is nothing remotely comparable in the book.  For ex, when Virginia kisses her, she returns it, instead of acting like she's just been come on to like she does in the film.)
Cunningham has been much too gracious about this misogynistic travesty of a film.  With a dream cast, it should have been so great.  But it fell apart behind the camera.  See the movie, if at all, only for Kidman, who looks & acts much like one would imagine Woolf, when the script will let her.",1056412800,9,1438,4.467432950191571
1443371,5,B00005JKTI,"In a world full of such high maintenance films as ""The Matrix,"" ""The Hulk,"" et al., which all seem to strive for a blockbuster appeal, ""The Hours"" is delicate in its presentation, hypnotic in its music and cinematography. In short, a masterpiece. After viewing the movie three times over a span of a month, I could never quite remember how I got home from the theater. The dialogue, the voices, the lighting, the haunting melodies provided by Phillip Glass all merge together to weave a spell of haunting beauty. It is easy to see how Nicole Kidman won Best Actress for her stunning portrayal of a delicate yet bold and strong Virginia Woolf. It is difficult to accept the reality of Chris Cooper (""Adaptation"") taking an Oscar home as Best Supporting Actor over Ed Harris in his role in ""The Hours."" The cast is superb and heartbreaking, rendering a movie that will both tear at each emotional limb yet reconstruct those same limbs in a more statelier manner, offering hope for life. Depressing, yes. Emotionally wrenching, yes. But the power of this movie is found in this dissonance of the loss of life, of identity, and the power of choosing life. As stated in the movie, ""You cannot find peace by avoiding life."" It is a simple message perfectly displayed in a powerful package of the lives of three women interwoven to form a cinematic masterpiece. ""The Hours"" proves that you do not need the force of explosions or special effects to deliver an impact so rare in today's entertainment world.",1056326400,3,1498,4.743295019157088
1443372,3,B00005JKTI,"Let's start with the only good thing about this movie: the acting, which is spectacular, as you can expect from the cast. This alone deserves the 3 stars I've given it.
The story moves between 3 shorter stories: the story of Virginia Woolf, set in the 20's while writing 'Mrs. Daloway', a story of a housewife set in the late 40's / early 50'd era reading 'Mrs Daloway', and the story of a modern day 'Mrs. Daloway', set in 1999.
The story moves very slowly between all three threads, interconnecting them throughout it. The depth is supposedly given by the interlocking emotional issues between the 3 stories (hence the 'chick flick' reference). But I felt that the movie focused too much on this emotional connection between the women, and neglected to make me care about them as characters, or their relationship.",1055894400,,816,4.794326241134752
1443373,5,B00005JKTI,"Wow.  All I can say is wow.  I can honeslty say I have never seen a more beautifully portrayed picture in my life.  All elements of this film were fantastic.  The acting was superb, all three actresses deserved acclaim and oscars for their roles, as well as Ed Harris, who I feel is in a dead heat with Chris Cooper from Adaptaion for the Best Supporting Actor nod.  The depth of this film was extraordinary, I feel that a very important characteristic of a movie is that it can make you think and have a great amount of emotion for the caharacters, and this film succeeds amazingly in that category.  Character develpment in this film is wonderful, you feel pain and sorrow for all of the characters, they are all flawed in some way and are tortured by themselves and in the ways that they can't express who they truly are.  It is a very sad look into the human heart, and takes you on an emotional rollercoaster on its way.  The Hours is so beautifully and artistically written and portrayed on film it is unbelievable, to take a story that has no theatrical background and make it into such an extroardinary film is an accomplishment in itself.  It was very imaginative in the way it weaved three storiess, which at the first seem unconnected except for circumstances and emotions, into and explosively shocking ending.  The Hours deserved every critics' acclaim and award it was nominated for, honestly it should have been the Best Picture over the superficial and overrated Chicago.  I feel this film puts an end to the Hollywood idea that there must be significant plot events and tumulteous occurrences of death or whatnot for the film to be viewing worthy.  The Hours shows that the voyage into the human mind and spirit is just as, or in my opinion even more exciting.  I don't think it is nearly appreciated enough at this time but I also feel it will be looked back in years to come as one of the greatestfilms of all time.  A feat in film making and a step in the right direction for a movie world that is reliant on cheap thrills and sex appeal.  Overall, A+ for wonderful film that we are lucky to have blessed upon us, definitely worth the time to watch it, you should be so lucky to have a chance to.  You will be a bit depressed and saddened but that is part of life.  And if you don't like it at first, give it a few days to let it sink in and you'll feel much differently I guarantee it.  I wasn't sure what to think at first myself but your opinion changes believe me.  And if you still don't like it than you are a very shallow person in need of help, enjoy the Charlie's Angels premier.  Best picture of the year without a doubt.",1055721600,2,2651,4.382413087934561

1443375,5,B00005JKTI,"""The Hours"" is, in no question, one of the best movies to come out in 2002.  Its touching storyline makes the movie well worth watching.  Nicole Kidman's performance is the best in her career, making her well deserved of her Oscar win for Best Actress.  Julianne Moore showcases her continuing strive for improvement, which she's done since ""Boogie Nights"".  No words can describe how wonderful of an actress Meryl Streep is!  Her three-year hiatus was worth the wait.  No one can forget the other great performances of John C. Reilly, Toni Collette, Claire Danes, Miranda Richardson, and.......Ed Harris.  Harris should have won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor(not Chris Cooper), which he was nominated for.
  Because of all these wonderful performances, you can feel what it's like to live in an unhappy world.  Those who are looking for deep movies should watch ""The Hours"" as one will not be disappointed.

1443377,4,B00005JKTI,"One of the top contenders for the Best Picture Oscar this year, is The Hours, a story based on Michael Cunnigham's novel that takes a creative outtake on the penning of Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway. It revolves around a day in the lives of three women, each living in different times but all facing the same question that troubled the heroine of the book. 'What does it mean to be alive?' The first woman presented to us is Virginia Woolf , played by Nicole Kidman who is almost unrecognizable in her prosthetic nose. Woolf is under a virtual house-arrest due to her history of attempting suicide and her unstable mental condition. Living on the outskirts of London, she is pampered by her devoted husband but nevertheless feels smothered by the constant scrutiny and attention. Unfolding in parallel to Woolf's story is another about a 50's housewife, played by Julian Moore. On the appearance she seems to have a perfect life, with a doting husband, an adorable son, and another child on the way. But as she immerses herself more and more into  Virgina Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, she begins to sense a void which pushes her dangerously close to the edge. Finally, another story unspools, this one about a modern day woman, played by Meryl Streep, who plans to throw a party for her ex-husband who is dying of AIDS.
  The three stories run simultaneously and yet separately, frequently inter-cutting one another, but as they progress forward, two of them  start  to converge, and ultimately it provides the audience with a surprising closure.
  The greatest forte of the film is in the acting. It is little surprise that all three of its leading actresses  garnered an Oscar nomination this year for their roles. Meryl Streep, a proven veteran in the field, is effective as the modern-day Mrs. Dalloway, confused and in deep turmoil in the face of a loved one's mortality. Julianne Moore, another top performer commanding the admiration of many, is chilling as the suburban housewife on the brink of self-destruction. But it's Ms. Kidman who will be creating much of the Oscar buzz. Overlooked last year for her excellent dual performances in Moulin Rouge and The Others, Kidman is the strongest contender for Best Actress this year as the academy has a tendency to bestow a reparative Oscar to those they unintentionally overlooked.
  All in all I liked The Hours because it is in essence a well crafted drama with an engaging storyline backed by strong, grounded performances. However, I couldn't shake off the feeling that the movie tried too hard to get its Oscar recognitions. It's almost as if the movie was carefully engineered for this purpose from the very beginning. With three of today's best actresses all gathered into one, the movie can almost be accused of committing an anti-trust violation in terms of monopolizing talent. But be that as it may, it is nevertheless impressive how the director handles the many weighty issues in a manner that captures the essence of what Virginia Woolf tried to say in her novel: the transience of our lives, the sacrifices the society sometimes forces on women, the feeling of obligation to others, to norms and to conventions, and freedom, without which the only alternative is death.
All this, shown in a day in the life of three women.",1055462400,,3288,4.8658318425760285
1443408,3,B00005JKTI,"The Hours tells three interwoven stories of women across different time periods who are all affected by the novelist Virginia Wolf. One is a depressed wife in 1950's Los Angeles (Julianne Moore), one is a divorced woman in modern day New York (Meryl Streep), and one, well, IS Virginia Wolf (Nicole Kidman). All the main actresses play their roles very well, and it is Kidman (almost unrecognisable with her prosthetic nose) who delivers the films best performance.
The three stories overall link together well, although not as well as many people have claimed, as the time changes did seem a little laboured at times. All the women are affected by Wolf's novel Mrs. Dalloway and all bear an uncanny resemblance to her character, which was cleverly portrayed. Nearly all of the characters in the film are unhappy, and the overall mood of the film is a dark and haunting one, which added to the atmosphere.
The Hours is a good film, perhaps very good, but nothing more than that; it lacked the execution to make it a great film. Yes, there were good points, its uniqueness, the high level of acting, its cleverness of character and time transition, but it was more an experimentation in story structure than a great movie.",1054771200,5,1221,4.791469194312796

1443410,5,B00005JKTI,"Virginia Woolf is writing Mrs. Dalloway in a country house. A suburban wife prepares for her husband's brithday and a lesbian mother wants to give her best friend a party (for an award he has won). These three moments reflect the complexity of life in three diferent times. These three moments reflect the conflicts of repression, passion, madness and compromise. Without a doubt the most important dialogue of the movie is said by Woolf, as she decides not to kill Mrs. Dalloway: It must be the visionary... she has to kill the poet. This line just gave me the chills as I heard for the first time. It is the poet closing the circle the one who dies... the one who takes his own life... it is her and it is the little abandoned boy. Woolf must stay in the country because the city is driving her mad, but it is her choice, and she cannot live being in the margin of the world. She must be in the most trivial parties, she must be in the most absurd rhythm of the city, because it is the world, and she cannot live aside from it. It is the poet's death which redeems society. It seems to give some sense to those plain unwanted lifes. Like that suburban woman, who has escaped from the horrors of war through a marriage she didn't want, and which represses her true desires.
I've heard so many times that this is a sad movie. It was not to me. It was wonderfull and beautiful. Even the suicide scenes are beautiful. Kidman really earned her oscar in this movie (though I think she really deserved it the year before, for The Others, instead of Halle Berry). And it was just a crime the Julianne Moore did not won for her role (come on!, what is wrong here? when I could point several floppy and flawed scenes in Chicago!).
This is a movie about thinking and it is for you to think. what is the relation between poetry and art, and the everyday life... no, not entertainment and life... art and life. It is about finding the real poet of the world, the one compromised enough to it, to the point of die for it (and when I say the world I mean it in its more human sense -I am not talking here about politics, or warriors or killers).",1054339200,,2132,4.292803970223325
1443411,4,B00005JKTI,"""The Hours"" is a serious, complex movie with some beautiful performances. It is based on the novel of the same name, which in turn pays homage to Virginia Woolf's, ""Mrs. Dalloway."" The movie demands the viewer's attention and concentration.
""The Hours"" follows three women from different cities and eras: Virginia Woolf in London in the 1920's (Nicole Kidman); a post-WW II housewife in Los Angeles (Julianne Moore); and a book editor who lives in New York in the present day (Meryl Streep).
Numerous clever cuts and transitions link the stories (e.g., one woman cracks an egg and then the movie transitions to another woman doing the same thing) as well as more profound underlying emotions (Woolf had female relationships, Moore's character kisses another female character, Streep lives with a female lover).
I would recommend that a viewer read or see ""Mrs. Dalloway"" (Vanessa Redgrave played the role a few years ago) before ""The Hours."" It's not required but it increases your appreciation for the movie. For example, in ""Mrs. Dalloway,"" a character named Clarissa Dalloway spends the day planning a party and thinking about a long ago kiss to a woman (she's been married for years). In ""The Hours,"" Meryl Streep's character spends her day in party preparations and thinks about a long-ago heterosexual relationship (she is now in a lesbian one). I wouldn't recommend reading the actual ""The Hours"" before seeing  the movie: a plot twist late in the story would be ruined.
The performances are for the most part outstanding with Kidman and Streep the standouts to me. I found Ed Harris in the role of the modern day Clarissa's close friend stricken with AIDS (and her lover from years ago), a bit over the top. He's a fine actor; he just didn't seem to fit this role.
I would recommend this movie to individuals who like serious, literary films. I wouldn't recommend this movie to individuals who need-or simply like-some lightness in a film. This is a grim movie. Beautiful in many ways, profound, thought provoking-but grim.",1053648000,28,2031,4.973529411764706

The high literary pretensions Daldry, Kidman, Streep and co. were aspiring to are blatantly bourgeois, and to the keen watcher and listener their beningnly flippant, aloof and ever-so-slightly-dismissive collective attitude towards the audience is more than a little irking. The film left me feeling curiously played by the proverbial puppet master, in this case the filmakers, having stoically expounded  their relatively myopic, proto liberal feminist/lesbian rhetoric with maximum precision and clinical grace.

The movie doesn't really have a point like someone who gave the movie 1 star said, pointless. I think, but, this movie shouldn't have a clear point, is better.  I mean, what you feel after watching this movie is the point(so it's not pointless in such extent)!  The movie is so rich of what life really means.  To face, to regret, to avoid, even to die........the movie can either be positive or negative, depending on your thoughts.  But this masterpiece must not be the worst movie.

The character of Julianne Moore is the weak link. Meryl Streep and Nicole Kidman recreate an intimate association between Virginia Woolf and her tragic heroine, ""Mrs. Dalloway."" Drama is comprised of moments of silence as well as action. When Kidman lays her head down on the ground to look into the eyes of a dead bird, one is overcome with a sense of the fraility of life; in this instance, both the bird's and Virginia Woolf's. This movie deserved more than one Academy Award. I recommend the book, ""Mrs. Dalloway"" for those who want an in-depth look at the soul of one of the greatest British authors of all time.",1051747200,5,787,4.628571428571429
1443429,5,B00005JKTI,"The writer of this film has achieved the impossible in the movie business: create an intruiging, beautiful, yet filmable version of a very untheatrical novel. And boy do they succeed.
The film focuses around three women, remarkably portrayed by Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore and Nicole Kidman.
Kidman is Virginia Woolf, whom is the key in the plot and a link between the other two characters. As she begins to write ""Mrs. Dalloway,"" perhaps her most famous novel, we see events unfolding in a single day in the lives of two other women in different locations and time periods:
Pregnant Laura Brown, in a haunting, nearly silent performance by Moore mainly opposite a small boy, is coming to terms with the fact that she is miserable in her marriage to the humble and loving Dan (John C. Reilly). One of her only comforts is reading Virginia Woolf, in the film mainly ""Mrs. Dalloway.""
The third woman is Clarissa Vaughn, in a wonderful performance by Streep, whose link to Woolf is that she is actually living the novel ""Mrs. Dalloway,"" except in present-day New York.
As the single day unfolds, the emotions and personalities of the characters are the main focus, much like in Woolf's novels, and the seamless edits and chilling Phillip Glass score contribute to the overall sad mood.
All in all, the transition from book to movie is highly successful and smooth, the performances are marvelous, and director Stephen Daldry proves once again how talented he is in his craft.
I can also provide evidence for those reading negative reviews: the short running time in one review is actually pushing two hours, and comments about ""no plot"" are made with little knowledge of Virginia Woolf; the plot is the character, and I was as entertained with this movie as any of the other critically hailed films this year.

1443431,5,B00005JKTI,"Boasting an exemplary cast, purposeful direction, authentic production values, and a haunting musical score, The Hours is a sincere praiseworthy attempt to adapt Michael Cunningham's prize-winning novel to the screen.  It is provocative, introspective, hopeful, and at times downright desolate.  As evidenced by the opening sequence, the value of life itself is called into question and it sets the tone for the rest of the film.
The complex storyline focuses on one day in the lives of three women from three different generations.  Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) is living outside of London with her husband in 1923, recovering from mental illness and beginning work on her now famous novel, Mrs. Dalloway.  Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) is a 1950's suburban housewife, married to a World War II veteran (John C. Reilly), raising a small boy while expecting another child.  And then there is Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep), a present-day version of Mrs. Dalloway, so named by her one-time lover and now AIDS-stricken writer Richard (Ed Harris), living in New York and planning one of her renowned parties for him following his reception of a prestigious poetry award.
Yet there is a common thread among them that effaces any `real' normalcy in their lives and ultimately forces each of them to make life-altering decisions.  Themes revolving around feminism and sexual preference stir just below the surface.  But it is the prevailing sadness of these women brought on by the confinements of a restrictive and often stifling society that is at the core of this film. Their yearning for something more or for that `one perfect moment' in time places each of them in the painful position to question their own existence.  The sequences in each of their lives are carefully interwoven throughout the movie, enhancing their parallel struggles.
The Hours is skillfully directed by Stephen Daldry and contains some of the finest performances of the year.  Julianne Moore's depiction of Laura Brown is filled with subtlety and nuance.  She epitomizes a 1950's housewife with a constant shiny exterior who can barely contain the internal struggle of her life's claustrophobic confinements.  Meryl Streep's Clarissa Vaughn, though bound by memories of her past, is somewhat less restricted in her character as a modern New York editor living with her female lover and therefore has more opportunity to display her considerable emotional range.
However it is Nicole Kidman's portrayal of Virginia Woolf that is the most mesmerizing and transforming performance in the film.  She is completely submerged as the famous novelist of the early twentieth century.  The hype concerning Kidman's prosthetic proboscis and its alleged distraction is much ado about nothing.  To the contrary, it enhances her performance and allows her characterization of Virginia Woolf to fully emerge.  Audiences will not recognize her, nor should they.
But if it is familiar players and plotlines you are seeking then The Hours is not for you.  It is neither fantasy nor escapism, yet what it lacks in pure entertainment it makes up for with introspection and a somewhat hopeful ending.",1050710400,8,3153,5.238568588469185
1443432,4,B00005JKTI,"More intense and focused than the book that inspires it, ""The Hours"" has the presence of a gathering, angry storm, manifested in three women whose convictions, desires and wills do not entirely match, yet all find themselves wondering if their lives could have or should have more to them than they do.
 Nicole Kidman is the standout as Virginia Woolf, the early 20th Century British novelist both ahead of and trapped by her era, embarking upon writing her book,  ""Mrs. Dalloway,"" which she believes will fully distinguish her genius. Julianne Moore is Laura Brown, a 1950s  Florida housewife reading the book and attempting to prepare a proper birthday cake for her husband. Meryl Streep is Clarissa Vaughn, who intends to throw a party for a friend dying of AIDS (Ed Harris) as he's about to receive the Carrothers Prize for poetry.
 Director Stephen Daldry plays up the parallels of the three women, much as Michael Cunningham did in the book. In the compressed universe of a movie, these parallels are more obvious, and at times intrusive on the story, as Daldry seems to need to point and nod at his stylistic flourishes (See the flowers? Notice the dialogue?) to a point reaching irritation.
 But the performances carry the movie past the indulgences.  Kidman, as Woolf, stalks her brooding scenes as if she's in her final role -- Daldry likes how Kidman smokes a cigarette so much, he shows it several times. Kidman, with a prosthetic nose plastered on to complete the character's transformation, holds her cards close -- Woolf is brilliant, and slightly mad, and good at concealing her moods -- until a late, angry scene at a train station, as she attempts to flee her rural England home for London, a main source of her madness. Kidman controls this performance; it doesn't get away from her like Alice Harford did in ""Eyes Wide Shut."" She's outstanding.
 Moore and Streep, obviously, inhabit smaller roles. Between the two, Moore has to work harder to make us believe her housewife is teetering so much on the edge of things that she's prone to crack. I'm not sure she gets there; she doesn't have enough time to develop Laura Brown's quirks, and what time she does have she underplays.
 Streep has her own troubles, playing Clarissa, a fiftyish lesbian -- methinks Streep doesn't exude ""lesbian,"" hence, this aspect of Clarissa is downplayed -- who very well could have lived an entire life with her friend Richard (Harris), a brooding, mercurial genius not unlike Woolf, who once kissed Clarissa on a sand dune near the ocean and defined her one moment of pure happiness.  What I love about Streep is her willingness to let others chew the scenery -- she's a cheery team player for a superstar, ain't she? -- and boy, does Ed Harris gnaw away.
What the hell's gotten into this man? Five years ago, he was slogging around in ""Milk Money"" and hamming it up in ""Stepmom."" Now, with this performance and his tour de force work in ""Pollock,"" he's redefining anger mismanagement. Harris has two extended scenes, and it's all he needs to put a sad, cruel stamp on the whole movie, like Woolf, his mind is a caged animal, bound up in ways by AIDS in he can never shake loose. You might remember him more than any of the women.
 Inevitably, you compare the movie to the book. Daldry's version --- my guess is this kind of movie can and will be remade a different way -- holds up. Cunningham, in the novel, allows himself the ability to rustle through the minds of his characters -- all of them -- whenever he sees fit; one of the great triumphs of the book is that he keeps the reader on a clear and straight path through all the shifting perspectives. Although it contains suicides, the novel's pervading emotion is of fleeting sadness, or, in some cases regret. Daldry cranks up those emotions into a stiffer drink; an early scene with Clarissa in the flower shop, which passes without much incidence in the book, is an opportunity for Daldry in the movie to convey heavy tension. To his credit, Daldry isn't fearful to become less-than-elegant and press his camera into these women's faces. And what few special effects there are work nicely. In the end, Daldry respected the pedigree of his actresses and the novelist but worked them over a little, too, and the end result is unsettling and dramatic.
It was a mature, intelligent picture. It brought me to read the book, which I think might supplement the movie better than the movie would supplement the book. The book fills in the remaining blanks, but the meat of the book's power is right there on the screen.

1443433,5,B00005JKTI,"This movie blends three stories that appear, at least at first, to be unrelated except by emotions and themes:  Meryl Streep as a modern New York book editor, Nicole Kidman as the author Virginia Woolf, and Julianne Moore as a disaffected 1950s housewife.  As always, these actresses are wonderful (I much preferred Moore in this to her very similar part in Far from Heaven; and Meryl Streep is always a wonder).  Edward Harris as Streeps dying friend is also remarkable.
When I read the book on which this movie is based, I saw it as being as much like a piece of music as like a traditional novel:  themes rising, submerging, and reappearing just as in music (purchasing flowers; a kiss shared between two women; a life-threatening illness, etc.).  The movie seems to build on this musical analogy, the camera sometimes cutting directly from one story to an identical moment in the next.  The pervasive Philip Glass score adds to this sense of theme, variation, repetition.  Its a beautiful score but I found it a bit distracting.
Despite the distraction, if anything I preferred the movie to the book; the outstanding performances brought everything very much to life.  If you prefer start-at-the-beginning-end-at-the-end storytelling, however, it may not be for you.",1050364800,7,1270,5.014285714285714
1443434,5,B00005JKTI,"This film is extremely disquieting. It is centered on Virginia Wolf and her character Mrs Dolloway. This character, this book is transmitted then through two generations of people with very catastrophic consequences. The book, like Virginia Wolf, is haunted by suicide, by death, by those hours during which a person lives death in life waiting for death, expecting death, preparing death, the hours after death that can only be imagined and that are seen as a liberation from life, from a life haunted by death. The fate of Mrs Dolloway is transmitted to a female reader a few decades later, but this woman who tries the road to death steps back and chooses life. So she abandons her family, her son and daughter, her husband and goes to Toronto. But the seed of suicide is transmitted to her son, who will become a poet, and he will court death to the end like the poet in Mrs Dolloway. He will meet love in a woman and apparently have a daughter from her, or is it really from her ? But he will be a poet, the poet of Mrs Dolloway, to the end of his life. He will look for dangerous situations and dangerous experiments. He will get AIDS and he will eventually commit suicide on the very day when he is recognized as a great poet, as the great poet he is, because he cannot go on living with his disease, with his pills, with his fate, waiting for death to come when it wants, leaving him abandoned and stranded in the hours before death, hours that can last years because of the treatment he gets. So Virginia Wolf will drown away in a river and the poet, Richard, will jump from the sill of the window of his sick man's nook. And yet the film goes farther by concentrating on the suffering of Virginia Wolf's husband and of Richard's paramour. The suffering of those who are accompanying these people doomed to die by their own hands and decisions. A suffering that has no limits because it is like an accusation standing in the way, the accusation that their love has been a prison, that their love has been the prison from which those doomed people want to escape. The more they love, the more they try to protect, the more they try to motivate the other into living, the more they fail and the more the other wants to disappear, to cut short the hours of waiting for death and enter the hours of after death. Poignant. And the actors, especially the actresses are outstanding in their rendering of this suffering, of this exploration of death in life, of this witnessing of life in death. The composition of these actresses is so fine, so delicate, so sensitive that we hardly recognize them in their parts. Nicole Kidman is probably the most perfect rendition of this escape from any image of her we may have in our mind's eye. They reach archetypal acting that makes the characters more important than the actresses. They disappear as concrete human beings in the fictional people they render on the screen. This leads to a feeling of absolute enslavement in our own lives and a desire to get out of these waiting hours in which we live with death behind the wings, a death we had never seen but that becomes omnipresent at this moment. Are we going to go down the way Mrs Dolloway is pointing at ? Are we going to be the woman who invented and created this Mrs Dolloway ? Are we going to be the poet of the book who says goodbye and disappears in the hours after the passing threshold of the end of life ? We could watch and watch again this film a hundred times and yet not come to any real answer though our desire to get free from these hours of waiting, into these hours of undescribable liberation beyond grows with each viewing. Is suicide the way to liberation for individuals who can see beyond the surface of things ?

I found this movie to be simply revolting. There wasn't one single woman in the entire movie who didn't annoy me. Meryl Streep's character is a pathetic creature in love with a man who can never love her back. Julianne Moore plays a selfish 1950s housewife who can't see the world beyond her own navel, and Nicole Kidman captured the Oscar for her portrayal of Virginia Wolf, the depressive and ultimately suicidal author.
Every one of these women is presented as some kind of victim. None of them is responsible for her own actions and all them spend their time whining. This was an extremely dreary and lightweight movie.",1049846400,17,718,4.752

The film follows a day in the life of each woman as they try to accomplish what may seem simple tasks to some people. To these women however, these tasks are the world and what will make or break them. What makes ""The Hours"" such a briliant movie is it's ability to convey the women's depression and inner torture to the movie going audience without ever actually uttering the word depression.

A movie that should strike a chord with everyone (given how many people suffer from depression or other such diseases), ""The Hours"" is a must see at least once in your life.",1049673600,3,931,4.648484848484848
1443478,4,B00005JKTI,"I find the movie very delightful in remaining faithful to Michael Cunningham's novel except for some minor details. The scene in which Clarissa Vaughan bumps into Walter Hardy and invites him to the poet's party is omitted in the film. The scene in which Louis (ex-partner of the AIDS-stricken poet to whom Clarissa provides care for) confesses to Clarissa his affair with his student is truncated. Another minor inconsistency is time. The novel describes Clarissa pauses at the threshold of the vestibule door on a June morning; while Meryl Streep, with light-blue stained spectacles and lemon-colored dangling earrings, walks down West 10th Avenue strewn with snow. No big deal.
The Hours is a difficult one to film. It's not the straightforward narrative type of movie. It begins with Virginia Woolf wading in a river committing suicide. The crosscutting between three women at different times and space (Virginia Woolf recuperating from her mental illness in Richmond in 1923; Clarissa Vaughan kicking off a busy day preparing for a party to celebrate merits of a poet in New York City in 2001; and Laura Brown frustrating herself making a birthday cake that looks too amateurish in 1950s, Los Angeles suburb) proves to be challenging for both the crew and audience. In the first 30 minutes or so, the screen jumps from one woman to another, back and forth in time, to establish the common thread of these three women. Viewers who are not familiar with the book might not be able to spell out what this crosscutting makes of.
Two thirds of the film focuses on Clarissa's day that serves as the artery of the film. Meryl Streep delivers a solid performance playing Clarissa who is unhappy and melancholy though living a full life. The scene in which she breaks down while telling Louis about Richard's illness is striking. Julianne Moore is Laura Brown, a Los Angeles housewife from the 1950s. She too, is not happy with her life though she has a perfectly happy marriage and a cute 3-year-old boy. Laura wants freedom from motherhood and duties of a wife. She will go so far as to leave her own son with a neighbor for a few hours, check into a hotel room and read undisturbed. Then we have Nicole Kidman as the writer Virginia Woolf who suffers from mental illness and hallucinations. I really enjoy seeing her getting on the wrong foot with her servant Nelly, whom she sends off to London for ginger biscuit and China tea impromptu. Kidman adroitly captures Woolf's brooding and grudging intensity. No less impressive is the tenderness she shows when her niece Angelica buries a dead bird in the Hogarth House garden.
Viewers might question the whole purpose of chronicling a woman's day. I think the film is well done in the sense that unity of the novel is preserved. A notable flaw is that the film gives away the end too soon, at least sooner than it should. You'll know what I mean if you read the book prior to viewing the film. Philip Glass has done the background scores in piano that is a little too loud at times and withstands the acting (Is that intended?) I'm not in the least turned off by the shortcomings. I recommend everyone to see the film and treat oneself to a dazzling performance by a brilliant cast. 4.5 stars.",1049587200,2,3240,4.74645390070922
1443479,5,B00005JKTI,"""The Hours"" is easily the best movie of 2002/2003.
Based on a Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, ""The Hours"", it recounts a single day in the life of three women from different times: Virginia Woolf (1923), Laura Brown (1951) and Clarissa Vaughn (2001).

We get three different stories of true emotions, each heartfelt in its own way, combined into over 100 mintues of complex feelings that will have you in tears a couple of times before the end credits start to roll.

The central point of cohesion is Viginia Woolf's ""Mrs. Dalloway"". Virginia Woolf, an author troubled by by own insanity in Richmond (1923) is in the midst of writing her bookMrs Dalloway. Choosing between living in Richmond and death, Virginia Woolf will finally succumb to the voices in her head by killing herself.

Almost 30 years later, a lonely housewife, Laura Brown in Los Angeles (1951) picks up the book for a read and questions her own life and feelings. She decides to leave while the impact on her son, Richard, is so devastating in years to come. The movie hits a high in a scene when Julianne Moore's character becomes engulfed in a sea of water while in bed.

In 2001, a New York City gay woman being nicknamed ""Mrs. Dalloway"" by her dying AIDS friend, Richard, questions her own existence and priorities when Richard re-ascertains his love for her before leaping to his death, another emotional high in the movie.

In this well-executed movie, the cast has given stellar performances and props go to all three lead actresses. Nicole Kidman delivers a performance of a lifetime delivering a  convinving portrayal of one of the leading authors of all time. Her performance shines through in the scene when she argues with her husband for her own existence at the train station. Perfect!

Julianne Moore is the most outstanding here in her portrayal of a lonely housewife who makes a daring choice to break free and later confronts her son's suicide leap with much bitterness. If there were two Oscars to give, she sure deserves one too. Look for her Oscar-nominated performance in Far From Heaven!

Meryl Streep, as usual, doesn not disappoint in her lesbian role played to great emotions opposite Ed Harris's dying character whom she has stood by all these years. ""No two people would have been happier the way we have been.""

Simply breathtaking, a masterpiece!",1049587200,4,2364,4.875311720698255
1443480,2,B00005JKTI,"I approached this movie as an opportunity to learn more about Virginia Woolf, of whom I knew a little. It was not without substantial eagerness that I sought to learn more about her from this film. But this movie is to no substantial degree the learning experience I had hoped for, scarcely more so than if I'd watched WILD WILD WEST with the hope of learning more about Ulysses S. Grant. So what is there to get out of THE HOURS? Nothing very tangible that meets one's eye. A discussion early on alludes to suicide and reasons for not taking one's life. We stay here on Earth for the sake of those we matter to, so one character asserts. That's a reason not to commit suicide, we're told, and we might suspect that would define a consistent theme of the movie. But not all its characters live out that sense of  purpose. Virginia Woolf didn't, either in real life or in THE HOURS (that point being the one unambiguous element of non-fiction I could find in the film). At least one other character also declines to stay around for those to whom he matters. But if one is looking for evidence either for or against staying around for loved ones as the theme of the movie, the most compelling evidence comes from Laura Brown, played by Julianne Moore. This gloomy and depressed character, forever on the verge of ""losing it"" decides not to commit suicide. Yet, she abandons her family anyway. So the movie's theme would seem more to be that choosing or not choosing suicide is beside the point relative to that claim that we should stay around for those to whom we matter. Even staying in this world doesn't mean that we'll be there for them.
While Laura Brown's suicidal tendencies are rather unexplained, there is a hint as to why Virginia Woolf (at least the one in this movie, whether the real one or not) is having a crisis about going on. Part of the therapy for the conditions she suffers has her living in Richmond, a suburb of London. She longs to be back in the big city instead. I'll assume she has her reasons for wishing she were in London, however poorly explained they are in this movie. In fact the subject is poorly introduced. Apparently what is supposed to first hint at her bitterness over separation from London is a scene where her servants are preparing a meal. She tells them to use ginger. They respond that they are out of ginger and would have to go all the way to London to get any. She responds that she doesn't see a problem there. Her harsh words as she elaborates must be meant as the first sign of her torture over being condemned to this suburban life that she detests (however attractive the setting might look to a lot of us viewers). But a first time viewer of the movie is hard-put to discern such a message in this scene as it is playing. It is more likely to look like she is being haughty, even bordering on verbally abusive, toward her servants. You'd think the movie makers overlooked that obvious appearance in their zeal to portray sympathetically these supposedly parallel lives of three women .
Yes, parallel lives -- at least that is what so many are saying about this movie. The paralles are implied between the real life of Virginia Woolf and two fictional women who lived later, one of them being the aforementioned Laura Brown. But how deep is the parallel? Laura reads Woolf's novel, ""Mrs. Dalloway"". That's about it as far as a tangible parallel really goes. Are we supposed to think the parallel is grounded in ordinary reality, in some general aspects of ""the human condition""? Or is the parallel forged by some deeper, essentially supernatural influence? Little room for the latter possibility would seem to be allowed by the movie's tone, which does not at all generally seem to draw on supernatural effects. Yet, brief suggestions that Laura is somehow living out the life of Mrs. Dalloway are thrown into the mix. It is as if Laura is constrained to live out that life, according to how Woolf writes of her heroine (as if the two time lines were simultaneous, even though the novel was written a few decades earlier than the stage of Laura's life interspersed in the movie's flashbacks and flash-forwards). That particular plot element is indeed as if some curse or something doomed Laura to live out a literary character's life. There could be the potential for a supernatural thriller there, if the movie consistently pursued it. But the movie does not go for that option that could have made for entertaining, if somewhat escapist, fare. Instead the direction the movie does take is an incongrous, muddled mess that very weakly at best lives up to its billing as a profound exposition on parallel lives. Where so many would have us believe it delivers with a bang, its impact is really more of a whimper.",1049414400,14,4765,4.605882352941176
1443481,5,B00005JKTI,"This movie is so beautifully acted and made. It has a poetic resonance as it unfolds, sort of like how American Beauty portrayed. The film is stark in its ability to illustrate the truth and some people may react to the film in negativity. It is about pain, grief, choices on how to live your life or end it if you must. I think the overall emotion the film can reflect is compassion. Compassion for people who are living The Hours as they chose, not judging them, realizing they are we all struggle with pain, that life is not all pain and can be joyful. I was floored at how much this movie tugged at me. I am still reverbrating from it. Kidman, Streep and Moore were all outstanding! They made this movie an inspiration to watch. Notice how well Kidman achieves her accent and voice change. Her mannerisms are impeccable, they are not overdone, she channels her creativity it is so wonderful to watch. Streep is so honest in her acting, she becomes an emotion. Moore is subtle, very subtle and yet so effective! I was amazed at how much Ed Harris does for his roles. He is amazing! This movie is very emotional and can trigger depression. I felt a heaviness after watching it but there was also so much beauty layered within. So keep this in your mind if you chose to watch this film.

1443482,5,B00005JKTI,"Based on Michael Cunningham novel, The Hours is a true tour the force that really deserved more attention than it received at the Academy Awards.  The movie is a sophisticated and soul searching look into the lives of three women who lives in three different moments in time but share in the same pursuit of acceptance, self discovery, and fantasy that is beautiful, and at the same time self destructive as well. The script written David Hare weaves together the struggles of these characters in a way that really brings each of their stories into focus and makes the final moment almost as powerful as the first. Nicole Kidman earn Her Oscar in spades with her gut wrenching performance of Virginia Woolf, and Julianne Moore is just as great as the lonely housewife who daydreams about the life she years for. Meryl Streep rounds out this exceptional cast as a woman trying to give some support and dignity to a friend dying of Aids, who is played By the ever great Ed Harris. This film is a truly powerful and haunting piece of movie making, and it will not only hit you close to home with some of it's issues, but will at the same time give an up lifting feeling that will stay with you right after you see it.

1443483,5,B00005JKTI,"I really liked this movie, even if it is rather depressing. As another reviewer said, this is not just a film, it is an experience (and one worth having)...
If possible, try to see it when you are not particularly sad, because the story in itself is pretty gloomy. It talks about  depression, bleakness, suicide, sexual identity confusion and lack of purpose. The whole film is pervaded by hopelessness and ennui, and the melancholia is omnipresent.
On the other hand, Stephen Daldry (the director) somehow managed to achieve magnificently what previously seemed impossible: a movie based on Cunningham's book, ""The hours"". Where is the difficulty, you might ask (only if you haven't seen the movie)?. Well, the answer is in the plot of the film, based on three women: Virginia Wolff, Clarissa Vaughan  and Laura Brown. They live in different times and cultures, but they share something: a feeling of vacuity, a total absence of matter,an all encompasing emptiness that threatens them... It is really beautiful to see how  the film goes seamlessly from one woman's life to that of the other: there is a wonderfully perfect inconsistence that is only explained (and linked) at the end of the movie. You must pay attention, because the film, in order to link the story, shifts permanently forwards and backwards in time. However, that extra attention is compensated when at the last minutes of this movie you comprehend the meaning of the name of the film, and which is the link (besides those that are evident) between these sories.
Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman)is depicted as an intelligent woman battling against madness in the 1923 England, while she starts to write what will be one of her best novels, ""Mrs. Dalloway""... Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep), a successful literary agent in the present, is  planning a party for her former lover, who is now dying of AIDS. Laura Brown (Julianne Moore), a seemingly happy pregnant woman in 1949 Los Angeles, is trying to make a cake for her husband's birthday, while she starts to read ""Mrs. Dalloway"". Three women, three different lifes but something in common: how to fight against that we cannot touch, against depression, inner demons?.
""The hours"" shines... Its light is rather dark, that is true, but it is incredibly good even for someone like me, who generally doesn't like dramas. It is not only a film, but a masterpiece...",1048550400,6,2382,4.962406015037594
1443484,5,B00005JKTI,"I am surprised at the number of people who have missed the entire point of both Woolf's MRS.DALLOWAY and Cunningham's THE HOURS. In both works, the issue is how we live our lives:do we squander the good times,assuming there will be more?; do we hold back in some way those we love?;do we choose life over death,whether a literal life or death, or a perceived entrapment?
Virginia Woolf clearly expresses her love for Leonard in the frame narration of the film. She can not continue to ask him to cope with her life struggles. Clarissa Vaughan only learns to appreciate life as she understands that each moment is special and not to be wasted. Laura Brown is not a lesbian;she is simply a woman who cannot live a life that she perceives is more death than life--she does not abort her child, she does not kill herself, she leaves. Kate Chopin in her novel THE AWAKENING called her character's life "" a role for which fate had not fitted her."" While it is true that one could say:then why marry and have children? The 1890 Edna Pontellier and the 1950 Laura Brown both lived in societies which told women their roles and anyone who desired autonomy was deemed a pariah. More's the pity!
Don't worry about feeling depressed when watching this film, rather pay attention to the life affirming women who ""look life in the face and know it for what it is.""",1048464000,2,1350,4.559670781893004
1443485,4,B00005JKTI,"""The Hours,"" based on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Michael Cunningham, is a movie about three women, all of whom have a kinship to Virginia Woolf's character of Mrs. Dalloway. The three women, played in three different eras, are Virginia Woolf herself, Laura Brown, a fifties housewife, and Clarissa Vaughan, an editor living in contemporary New York.
Nicole Kidman is superb as Virginia Woolf. She captures Woolf's brooding intensity and recurring madness to perfection, and her vulnerability makes one's heart ache. Julianne Moore turns in another fine performance as Laura Brown, a suburban housewife who is depressed in spite of having a loving husband and an adorable little boy. Brown feels that she must escape or kill herself. Finally, Meryl Streep is Clarissa Vaughan, a successful editor who lives with her female lover. Clarissa also spends a great deal of time tending to Richard, a close friend who is dying of AIDS.

Stephen Daldry does a fine job of eliciting sensitive and compelling performance from a very fine cast, and the screenplay is faithful to the book without following it slavishly. However, the background score is too loud and intrusive, as if the director wants to emphasize that these people are going through major crises.

In addition, for those people who are not familiar with Virginia Woolf's life and writings, it is unclear why Laura Brown and Clarissa Vaughan are so unhappy. Laura may be bored with her life, but it is hard to understand why she could not have found some accommodation less drastic than the one that she ultimately chose. Clarissa's angst is also puzzling, since she has a full life, and is surrounded by people who love her. She is an attractive, vivacious, intelligent and successful individual. Her life matters.

Therefore, although the acting in ""The Hours"" is absolutely dazzling, I suspect that the message may be a bit cloudy for some viewers. Still, I urge you to see ""The Hours"" for the wonderful performances by a very talented cast.",1048377600,,2008,5.005988023952096

The 3 stories are interwoven beautifully, with little or no jarring when moving from one to the other. In fact, I really liked the way the film transitioned.
The acting is exceptional but I took 1 star off for the story itself being rather hard to follow. I got the feeling that I should have read the book first or at least known the history of Virginia Woolf and her book ""Mrs. Dalloway"". The research I did after seeing the movie cleared up some of the questions I had.
I've heard some negative reviews based on the homosexuality portrayed in the movie. It's sad that people would focus on that instead of just accepting it as part of the story. It's not a ""gay"" or ""straight"" film but the portrayal of 3 women who's lives are not what most would consider typical.",1047859200,3,916,4.300578034682081

1443520,4,B00005JKTI,"AT first I was concerned about this movie, about whether it would sustain my interest beyond the sheer force of the actresses involved.  Watchign Nicole Kidman first appear and then vanish like a wisp of smoke into Virginia Wolff was amazing.  Since To Die For, I've always thought her talented at the art of vanishing but she proves here again that its not a trick but a conscious ability.
Julianne Moore as always is a woman on the verge of....soemthing.....she plays longing well.  Someone who MUST make a change in their lives and who knows it.  Of the three actresses she gets to bridge the time frames of two of the characters to interact and though thsi requires heavy makeup, it sort of works.  Not very well but it does work.
Meryl Streep's piece is more ethereal because she's at the center of so many people's lives and expectations and she seems like she's been maintaining distance for awhile and no one has noticed.  The ability to play someone who wants to speak up but can't or won't is pretty incredible.
All in all this is a great film, and as always I advise patience with the film, its revealed how everyone is connected soon enough.
Ed Harris who's scenes are him floating in and out of dementia are also gripping as we only have Streep's character's adore for him to project what his life was like, who he was onto the canvas of someone in their last days.",1047427200,3,1378,4.514056224899599
1443521,5,B00005JKTI,"I approched ""The Hours"" with very high expectations, perhaps due to my reading the novel of the same name prior driving an hour to view the film. I must say without doubt, I was not disappointed!
Nicole Kidman was, to say the least, captivating, as the troubled and wonderful, bi-polar, Virginia Woolf! It seems that Kidman has not only erased every trace of her physical beauty, replacing it with the unkept, frumpy, and simply grey Mrs. Woolf, but she has also replaced her entire persona with that of the brillant, yet shocking, Woolf. Her stature, her body language, and her voice, were not her own!
The film begins in 1941, when Virginia Woolf put rocks in her coat pockets, and walked calmly out into a river, ending her own life. The film then backtracks to a day in her life years before, a day like any other when she rises to work on her books, Mrs Dalloway in this case, and then goes on to prepare tea party for her sister and her children. Later, Woolf runs away from home to the train station, her intention being, to escape to London. In these desperate moments, Nicole Kidman delivers a very heartfelt speech about her longing to return permently to London. ""I'm living in a town I have no wish to liuve in. I'm living a life, I have no wish to live!""
Julianne Moore put in a fair battle for her character Laura Brown, but I believe the character was simply too complex for her, or anyone, to adequatly convay to an audiance. But this is not purely at falt to the actress. Many of the events which occur in the day we observe in Mrs. Brown's life occur in the mental realm, rather than the physical realm, and cannot be protrayed on film in the same manner that the book can protray it. In the day we see of her life, she wakes to begin reading Woolf's Mrs Dalloway. (A very well written book I might add) Mrs. Brown then goes on to create a cake for her husband's birthday party, which does not come out to her satisfaction, so she tosses it. She then decides that she must escape for a while, and leaving her son with a sitter, she goes to a hotel, her intention being to end her life then and there, takeing a collection of medications she has brought with her, much of this is left unexpained, and could, I suppose leave the audience to wonder her purpose in visiting the hotel. Although, after a rest, she decides to live, and returns to pick up her son, and to bake another cake for her husband.
Meryl Streep plays the third woman Clarissa Vaghen, a New Yorker who is the modern personification of Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, as well as being nicknamed ""Mrs. Dalloway"" by her best friend Richard. Streep's character is perhaps the one the audience will most readally understand, being her expressions are the most outward of the group, as well as being in a setting most familiar to the viewers. Ms. Vaghen's day encompasses her preparing a party for her friend Richard, being he has won a poetry award. I will not give away the revealing details of the story, which tie the lives together, but is safe to say, on this ordinary day, this day of all days, Clarissa's day, her party, and her life are radically changed.
This movie is exceedingly gripping, and entertaining, if you let it be. I recommend you read the Pulizer Prize winning novel of the same name before you view the film, as it will not only give you a deeping understanding of the story, but also of the characters themselves explaining how the characters feel about many of the situations they face!

There are the more obvious themes which tie the main female characters together, however, there were many subtle themes as well (e.g., watch how the themes of eggs and baking recur during the different time periods).
The acting is absolutely top notch.  Although Meryl Streep did not get an acting nod from Oscar, she did deserve it for this performance moreso than some of her past nominations.
This is a movie to be watched over and over again to truly appreciate the strength of the characters, the strength of the direction, the strength of the supporting cast, and the timeless flow of the haunting score by Philip Glass.",1047254400,7,701,4.833333333333333
1443523,5,B00005JKTI,"The viewer has to prepare himself before watching ""The hours"". This is not a common movie. It's a deep, sad, and very depressive movie.
There are three timelines in ""The hours"", and director Daldry chose to show them simultaneously; all stories are about one day in the lives of three women. I'll list the three timelines:
1) England, 1923 - Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) is trying to write her novel, Mrs. Dalloway; she receives the visit of her sister; she tries to set her life straight, as she's not living the life she wanted, because of medical and psychological problems.
2) California, 1950 - Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) is a housewife with a little son; this is the day of her husband's (john C. Reilly) birthday; she's reading Mrs. Dalloway; she has doubts about everything, from her sexuality to her will to go on living.
3) New York, 2001 - Clarissa Vaughn's (Meryl Streep) day is about organizing a party to her friend and ex-one time-lover, the poet and writer Richard (Ed Harris), who is receiving an important prize of lifetime achievment in poetry.
The three stories are connected; the most obvious connection is that Clarissa Vaughn is the modern Mrs. Dalloway. There are recurrent themes in the three stories, all related to Mrs. Dalloway and Virginia Woolf's life: sexual doubts, depressive thoughts, death wishes. Stephen Daldry made a movie more complex than he wanted, without knowing he did it. Uncounsciously, ""The hours"" is deeper and denser than its director wanted it to be. You have to get a degree in psychology to fully understand all the relationship between the women characters.
Although ""The hours"" is starred by women, a movie about women, with three of today's top actresses, their constant presence and the fact that the three of them are so sad, depressive and unresolved characters, makes the male actors' (Stephen Dillane, John C. Reilly and Ed Harris) acting excellent. The best one in my opinion is Stephen Dillane's Leonard Woolf.
Two things I didn't like:
A) Meryl Streep lost herself here; her acting seemed a little bit forced and self-conscious, trying to make Clarissa a different character from other characters she's played in other movies: she couldn't do it. I've seen this same Clarissa in other Meryl Streep movies (Meryl Streep is much better in ""Adaptation"").
B) Nicole Kidman, although in good acting shape, played a character (Virginia Woolf) so sad and depressive that I couldn't care one bit what happened to her. I think the writers exagerated Virginia's depression to make the audience understand better what happened to her, but this trick completely backfired. No one can stand Virgina Woolf in the movie. And the scene with the dead bird is the oldest metaphore ever.
Without any doubt, the real star of the movie is Julianne Moore. As the sad and unloving Laura, she is the most complex, convincing and believable character of ""The hours"".
There are other aspects of this movie to be discussed, but this review is already too long.
So, to wrap it up,
Grade 8.7/10",1047254400,2,3032,4.923828125
1443524,3,B00005JKTI,"If you sense an overly-critical tone in my review it's due to frustration. This had all the potential for ranking right up there with Dangerous Liaisons in my book. However, I couldn't help but notice the hint of irritating pretentiousness with the film in general... and what was the deal with Kidman's nose (extreme and annoying). Her performance was Oscar-worthy but the nose was an overdone and unnecessary distraction. Streep was good... though not outstanding (despite her lame melodramatic character who I could've cared less about). Until the kiss, I honestly spent part of the movie thinking Julianne Moore's character was umm... shall we say... ""mentally challenged""? Considering her character's issues I'm not quite sure if that qualifies as a good or bad performance. In the case of all 3 women, I failed to grasp the reason for all of the self-absorbed suicidal angst.
In a situation like this, the real problem usually isn't with any of the aforementioned. Cinematic near perfection could've been achieved here. I've not read the source material but I felt like the screenplay may've missed some important theme(s) or failed in its attempt to sufficiently make the ""tie-in"" of the characters meaningful. There were tie-ins however. AND HOW! That ""Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself"" thing that spanned all three storylines had all the subtlety of a train wreck. Perhaps instead of throwing the audience that anvil they should've spent more time on character development... and I'd assume that this IS supposed to be a character-driven film. The leads didn't seem legit, especially Laura (how could she leave such a beautiful son that, clearly, loved her so dearly). Possible I'm sure but they didn't develop her enough to make it credible. As a woman who loves women, it should've been relatively easy relating to or caring about them.  The movie stayed in ""misery mode"" too much for my tastes without enough character development to really explain the misery. Instead I found myself either loathing them or occasionally thinking ""the acting's great but who cares?"".
There was something else that I'm not quite sure of that disturbed me deeply about this film... IT'S INTENT.  Some of the messages and portrayals in the film were questionable at best and unacceptable at worst.  All 3 women were portrayed as oppressed and the oppression is ended only by some form of flight, abandonment (of devoted husbands and CHILDREN) or by relationships being severed through suicide.  Husbands are portrayed as pathetic one-dimensional ball-n-chains. (Male-bashing in a lesbian flick is a cheap shot) The only enduring relationship is Clarissa's lesbian relationship.  In the two scenes where the wives are busy ""feeling up"" neighbors and sisters, oddly enough a child is in the background silently watching the entire episode.  What's that all about?  In one of the final scenes with Clarissa the film actually attempts to validate Laura's self-serving abandonment of her own children.  ""That was death. I chose life"".  That was the moment when I wanted to nuke the film.
Overall I gave it 3 stars. The photography, direction, art direction and acting definitely made the difference. The score's presence, or lack of, had its moments. I also thoroughly enjoyed Toni Collette (always hot), Stephen Dillane (the train depot scene was perhaps the film's best), Allison Janney (remarkably sexy) and Claire Danes (remarkably good)? All actors/actresses carried their roles extremely well. The exceptions were Ed Harris (his appearance was Oscar-worthy as an aids victim but his peformance was so pathetically over-the-top, I wanted to push him out of the window myself) and Laura's husband, who was so flaccid and one-dimensional that he was more like a caricature. I wasn't exactly sure if Laura was trying to kill herself because of the ""unhappy existence/sexuality thing"" or just to get away from him.
Though I noted the limitations of the screenplay earlier I must admit that there were some truly exceptional moments which I enjoyed. This type of film can walk a fine line between brilliant and unbearable (in this case it's closer to brilliant).",1047168000,4,4169,5.164444444444444
1443565,5,B00005JKTI,"With its shifting timeframes, towering literary heritage, and relentlessly melancholy tone, ""The Hours"" could have been a disaster.  Thankfully, in the hands of writer David Hare and director Stephen Daldry, it's an emotional powerhouse that enthralls from opening to final frame.  Adapting novels, especially award-winning literary ones, is a challenging business.  But David Hare's wonderful screenplay grabs the bull by the horns, boldly re-imagining whole sections of the book and creating action where there was once only interiority.  Moving seamlessly between three time periods, he delicately interweaves the emotional lives of three women.  But nothing is forced; his writing allows the connections to declare themselves, rather than making them obvious.  Such subtlety is helped enormously by the superb performances Daldry extracts from the actors.  This is truly an actor's movie, and it's blessed with an extraordinary cast.  Nicole Kidman has been the focus of most of the publicity and Oscar-mongering, but don't let that fool you.  Julianne Moore deserves the Supporting Actress award, too.  Meryl Streep is, as always, effortlessly perfect.  Ed Harris has never been better.  Even the minor plays - Toni Collette, Miranda Richardson, John C. Reilly and especially Stephen Dillane as the saintly Leonard Woolf - are superb.  Everyone here is so good the Academy is going to find it difficult to divide the spoils.  Kidman deserves the Best Actress award.  She has less screen time than you may expect but from the harrowing opening her presence hangs over the film even when she isn't on screen.  Some have criticized this as a rather humorless portrait of Woolf, with Kidman's performance failing to capture the wit and the charm of the great writer.  But the screenplay doesn't give her much scope.  And why should it?  This isn't a Virginia Woolf bio-pic.  It's more a film about her work and its impact than it is about Woolf's own personality.  And in that sense, ""The Hours"" succeeds brilliantly.",1046908800,,2018,5.263322884012539

Beyond the greatest actress of our time, everything else is absolutely brilliant about this remarkable film following the hours in three women's lives in different decades, each with similiar and compelling problems.  Nicole Kidman is perfect as Virginia Wolfe, the depressed writer dealing with a life that is stifling her, a world that she desperately wants to escape.  Julianne Moore is superb again (also giving another great performance in ""Far From Heaven"") as a 50s house wife that is also living in a life that she can't bare living.  Meryl plays the modern gal, rounding out the trio and all three are drawn together in some way by the book Virginia is writing called ""Mrs. Dalloway"".  Both Moore and Kidman received Oscar nominations for their roles and its a disappointment that Meryl didn't receive one as well.  But nonetheless, the entire film is beautifully directed and acted.  Ed Harris does an incredible job as a good friend and former lover of Streep's character.  This is the kind of film that makes you realize how important and artistic the media  of movie making is.

1443568,5,B00005JKTI,"3 Women tied together by a book. 2 women tied together by 1 man. This is the basic plot of The Hours. Nonetheless, as simple as it seems, it is one of the most emotionally intense movies you could expect from a spectacular leading cast of Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore and Nicole Kidman. Nicole Kidman as Virginia Woolf wrote the book Mrs Dalloway was read by Julianne Moore who substituted herself into the character of Mrs Dalloway and questioned about her own life. Meryl Streep, who was identified as Mrs Dalloway by her best friend felt herself suffering the way she didn?t mean to suffer. These 3 women, who were all on the crossroads of their lives, had to make a decision. However, no matter what decision they made, they had to live up with the outcome and the consequence. It is a question of life and happiness. Being identified as a happy person doesn?t necessarily mean that you are happy. Happiness is something you found within, but it is also a decision of whether you want to let it out or trap it inside. The process for searching for true happiness and relief is never easy, for you have to know what you want first, which is the catalyst to true happiness. Feeling being trapped in a life you think you don?t want to life requires enormous courage to break out from it. Nonetheless, this is another decision that one must live up to for the rest of his or her life. Death, regrets, relief may all be the outcome, but the problem is whether you are true to your own life. You may not agree with the ways these characters chose to break through their lives, but feeling the love, pain and happiness within them is the main focus of the movie. Without doubt, all Meryl, Julianne and Nicole put on a spectacular show in front of the audience. You may have personal favour for anyone of them, but they are all unquestionably great in the movie. Their acting is detailed and delicate. You can feel the life of these characters and feel the painful dilemmas that they went through. The movie would not be complete if it lacks anyone of them in it. Apart from the leading cast, the movie also has a very strong supporting cast ? Toni Collette, Claire Danes, John C. Reilly, Ed Harris etc., which added so much colour and life to the whole movie. Their performances are so natural and beautiful and finely tuned. One could not expect anymore refine acting than this one. The Hours may be emotionally intense and draining, but it would be a movie that touches the deepest part of your heart.

Film follows lives of three women in three different times: Virginia Woolf 1920's through 1940's as an author of a book ""Mrs. Dalloway""; Laura Brown in 1950's as a reader of the book and Clarissa Vaughn in 2001as an embodiment of a title character of the book. Sounds confusing? It is NOT.
This movie is a rare example of an excellent filmmaking. The cinematography is striking, shifts between scenes unlocking the interrelationship between these women are incredibly well guided and performances of all the stars involved in this film are superb. Although there are a lot of clues that connect Laura Brown with Clarissa throughout the film, realizing what that connection is worth the whole movie. It is a very well told story and is presented in a most beautiful way.
Excellent movie.",1046390400,2,1317,4.632478632478633
1443570,5,B00005JKTI,"A book is not a movie. A movie is not a book. While both are visual media, in the sense that we absorb the content through our eyes, a film must succeed primarily via what is unstated but suggested, while a book must make a statement. I loved the book. I was reluctant to see the film. I needn't have been concerned. The film is faithful to the essence of the book, and that's what is important.
With heartfelt performances throughout, exquisitely fine-tuned editing, and great directorial skill, everything pulls together to make a series of intertwined statements about the inner lives of women versus what is displayed externally.
Without question, this is the best performance Meryl Streep has given in a very long time. Her Clarissa is strong yet vulnerable; she is the classic caregiver whose feelings get glossed over or put on hold while what must be done gets done. Julianne Moore is, as always, flawless in her ability to make us feel what her character feels. And the big surprise is Kidman's performance; she moves in and takes up residence inside Virginia Wolfe--haunted and driven, conflicted and yet optimistic, even in her contemplations of death.
Splendid as ever in supporting roles, Claire Danes, Allison Janney and Toni Collette each offer fully dimensional characters in their brief times onscreen. I was particularly taken by young Jack Rovello as Richie and Ed Harris as the poet Richard. There is something very potent both in the casting and in the roles as they're played out.
Altogether this is a remarkable film--one that is about women but that doesn't show them to be weak or helpless or dependent upon men either for rescue or survival. It's about struggling to get past the restrictions of society and its imposed definition of who and what women ought to be. This isn't lightweight material; it's thoughtful and provocative--just as the book was. And so the film succeeds brilliantly in carrying the message successfully from one medium to another. Not cheery viewing, but definitely enlightening.
Most highly recommended.",1046304000,17,2055,4.994169096209912
1443571,5,B00005JKTI,"for the simple fact that this is a very intense film focusing on the debilitating suicidal depression of three very different women in three very different time periods. See this film on your own merit if AND only if it really is a film you want to see.  Do not go by recommendations or the fact that it is one of the major (and well deserved) Oscar worthy contenders this year.  In some ways, `The Hours' reminds me of Fassbinder's `The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant' another film I absolutely love but would never recommend to anyone. Although each film is completely different from each other, both films are about successful women and both explore similar themes of homosexuality, suicide and depression (common themes for Fassbinder who eventually succumbed to an untimely end through suicide).  So it's understandable why many will not enjoy `The Hours' and why I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who doesn't already want to see it on their own merit.
I won't go into the particulars of the film; by now everyone pretty much has an idea of what `The Hours' is about.  Instead I will say why I liked it so much.  What I found to be the most fascinating aspect of this film is how all the different stories tied together maintaining such an amazing linear quality. Throughout the film dramatic events that occur in one scene are carried over and applied seamlessly to the characters in the next scene.  The flow between characters and time periods is flawless, further accented by the engaging qualities of all the characters.  I also enjoyed how there were several events, three of which instantly come to mind, that are never addressed throughout the course of the film. Instead, they're left up to your own interpretation in spite of their importance to the story. I also enjoyed Toni Collette's cameo role as Julianne Moore's buxom 50s neighbor Kitty.  Collette is such a compelling and brilliant actress that I enjoy any film she appears in.  Also, one reviewer felt  the Laura Brown character's decision was despicable and disgusting yet that's what makes this such a good film: it makes you feel. Whether or not you like this film you will come away feeling something.  My eyes hardly stayed dry throughout the entire film.  Excellent.

1443572,4,B00005JKTI,"30-40 minutes into the movie, my wife wanted to walk out. She was bored stiff from the slow pace. Others had walked out. It's a movie you need to stick with, though, and because we stuck it out and finished the movie, we found ourselves really enjoying the movie. She and I talked about it for at least two hours from the moment we left the cinema. The movie definitely makes you think.
It trusts its audience members to figure things out for themselves...though it takes its time with a lot of tedious details. After the first hour, you think Laura Brown is a little slow in the head or a freak, Meryl Streep needs to take a long drive and scream her head off to remove some of that stress, and Nicole Kidman needs a trip to London.
The intertwining of the three periods is very interesting and keeps the mind moving, even while the film is sluggish.
The point is, stick with the movie. Watch it from beginning to end. Unlike Royal Tannenbaums, which was slow from start to its miserable finish, The Hours gets much better as the movie progresses, and ends nicely. Don't show it to anybody who enjoys cow tipping or Eminem.",1046044800,,1124,4.434782608695652
1443573,5,B00005JKTI,"Stephen Daldry's admirable ""Billy Elliot"" couldn't even begin to hint at the strokes of brilliance that make up his followup, ""The Hours.""  Based on the award-winning Michael Cunningham novel of the same name, ""The Hours"" tells the story of three women whose lives are numbed to all feeling and are desperate to escape the private hell that enslaves each of them.  The story travels within four decades and jumps back and forth from the United States to England.  Nicole Kidman is author Virgina Woolf, who is battling depression while living in the suburbs of London with her overprotective husband in the 1920s.  Julianne Moore plays a 1950s Los Angeles housewife, apparently stifled by her marriage while coming to terms with her sexuality.  Merryl Streep is living in present-day Manhattan and is preparing a party for her longtime friend and AIDS-stricken poet (Ed Harris).  To explain how these three stories are connected would give away potential spoilers (if you haven't already read the book), but the film's performances are nothing short of excellent.  Kidman digs deep into the angst and despair of Woolf; her performance is a blazing revelation, and it excels by a nose (pardon the pun).  Moore's scenes with her young son are crushing and heartbreaking; you don't know whether to pity her or resent her for her selfishness.  And Streep, is, as ever, a powerhouse.  But the real star of the movie is director Daldry, who extracts great performances, and does a wonderful job at bringing the screenplay to life.  ""The Hours"" is hardly a feel-good movie, and the recurring themes of suicide and despair may put off some. But it's no doubt one of the best films of 2002.",1045958400,3,1681,4.925531914893617

I read the book and thought, ""What a bunch of self-centered, boring women!"", though it did get me started reading Virginia Woolf for which I will be eternally grateful.  The movie was quite another story from my reading experience, I must have missed a lot and am now going to have to read it again!  If you are not more captivated by this film than any that you've seen in a very long time, well then, your tastes run differently than mine.  I saw it on a Saturday and went back to see it the next day.  Nicole Kidman was truly remarkable as Virginia Woolf, which is not to say that Julianne Moore and Meryl Steep were not as good.  No, they were every bit what one would expect.  It has been categorized in some circles as a ""chick flick"" which is too bad. If it doesn't walk away with at least 6 Oscars, I will be very disappointed.  Do yourself a favor and see this one on the big screen.",1045958400,,995,4.2
1443605,3,B00005JKTI,"The Academy Awards has done it again.  Take an obscure picture about a simple subject, bequeath it with several nominations from the major categories (Best Actress, Best Picture, Best Director), smother every movie trailer that airs on TV with propaganda (complete with rave quotes from magazines and newspapers) and everyone will feel compelled to rush out and see it.
The aftermath?  Most people are incredulous that they spent $8 on something they wouldnt have looked at twice at their local Blockbuster.
The Hours has relied on the glitter of marketing since it opened nationwide in January 2003 and it takes advantage of every favorable critique it receives.  The result is a continued and reliable box office profit that will persevere through late March if it manages to win a few Oscars.
The movie begins with a simultaneous look at the morning routines of the three pivotal characters  first off, in the year 1921, novelist Virginia Woolf (Kidman) awakens in her Richmond, England home to the sound of her doctor whispering to her husband Leonard (Dillane) downstairs.  The next clip takes place thirty years later in 1951 with pregnant housewife Laura Brown (Moore) sleeping soundly as her husband Dan (Reilly) roots around the kitchen.  Lastly, in the year 2001, Clarissa Vaughn (Streep) slaps her alarm clock with a heavy hand as she rises from bed, planning an extravagant dinner party for her friend Richard (Harris) who has just won a prestigious award for his latest novel.  All three women wrestle their inner demons throughout the film, Woolf battling schizophrenia; Brown, dissatisfaction with her cursory and monotonous life and Vaughn with her feelings toward Richard, tortured by the reality that he will soon die from a long, arduous battle with AIDS.
The entire film alternates between the different eras in which these women live, forming interesting parallels as aspects of their personalities and lives are revealed.  Woolf writes her pivotal novel Mrs. Dalloway while contemplating thoughts of suicide, Brown reads Mrs. Dalloway and also contemplates suicide and Vaughns life seems to mirror the book altogether, the start of her day echoing the very first line of Woolfs novel.
The biggest setback with David Hares screenplay (who has only written for the stage and TV) is not only loss of characterization but also a distinct amount of insight into the characters psychological dissension.  The adaptation of Pulitzer-prize winning author Michael Cunninghams 228-page novel to a two-hour film forfeits a considerable amount of poeticism and personification, a detail that most times cannot be avoided when adapting a book to a movie.  What is ultimately confusing is the homoeroticism incorporated into the story, Julianne Moores liplock with Toni Collette and Nicole Kidmans passionate smooch with Miranda Richardson utterly perplexing.
Most of Cunninghams beautiful prose is retained in the storys central figure - as Woolf, Kidman manipulates the pastoral dialogue with ease, her delivery rarely coming off as cliched or strained.  This is a high-caliber performance that not only well warrants her nomination for Best Actress this year but tops that of her nomination last year for Moulin Rouge.  Moore (also nominated) is slightly constricted as Laura Brown, her role more or less relegated to either holding back tears or letting them flow.  Streep, whom I adore, doesnt really get a chance to showcase her awesome dramatic powers because the role of Clarissa Vaughn leaves her little of an outlet.  This is a woman who has been nominated thirteen times for an Academy Award (and has won twice for 1980s Kramer Vs. Kramer and 1982s Sophies Choice) and its a little disappointing that such incredible talents only receive a small degree of divulgence.  Ed Harris comes off a little inadequate as Richard  the most memorable aspect of his character is the incredible job the films make-up artists did in rendering an AIDS patient completely emaciated by the disease.  Claire Danes, Jeff Daniels, Allison Janney, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Dillane round out the supporting cast and Toni Collette, although making a very brief appearance as Browns neighbor Kitty, steals the scene with an affecting portrayal of a woman suppressing profuse heartache.
Speaking of make-up, The Hours contains some subtle but remarkable transformations, most notably Ed Harris haggard physique and Kidmans transformation into the 40-something reclusive author.  Her prosthetic nose completely changes her physical countenance, rendering the actress nearly unrecognizable, along with her liver-spotted hands and arms.  Moore gets quite a transformation as well, her character showing up once more towards the end with a considerably aged face (60s to 70s, if I had to guess).
Director Stephen Daldry, responsible for 2000s cutesy critical fave Billy Elliott, is at the helm of the picture.  He presents The Hours in much the same manner as the classic novels of Woolfs time  heavily laced with idyllic sentiment but languorously paced, at times to the point where it can exhaust the patience of more attentive people.  There are even moments where there is too much silence, Philip Glasss lovely sonatas completely and utterly absent from the background; this is yet another aspect that can make people start shifting in their seats because the lack of a musical score can mean a failure to evoke a specific mood from its viewers.  Of course, for all I know, this could be Daldrys very intention, the silence that all three women keep the very reason for their torment  we are meant to share their discomfort with the stillness to gain a small understanding of their anxiety.
Although The Hours has a lot going for it (a Pulitzer Prize-winning book, an ensemble cast complete with Golden Globe/Emmy/Oscar winners), it has surprisingly little to flaunt in the end.  Despite the nine nominations it received from the Academy Awards, it is still just a trifle of a film.  If you want to watch a good examination piece, then rent 2000s Best Picture winner American Beauty  Lester Burnham is the moot prophet of the 21st century.",1045958400,4,6140,5.1882591093117405
1443606,5,B00005JKTI,"One of the absolute best crafted films of 2002, The Hours flawlessly combines the stories of three similar women in different times during one significant day of their lives.
The women; author Virginia Wolfe (Nicole Kidman), a 1950s housewife (Julianne Moore), and a modern day magazine editor (Meryl Streep), are the core of this film. Each feels trapped in a life they're not happy with, and want to find a way to improve it, or end it. This is a heavy film, dealing with suicide, sexual identity, love and happiness. And between the cross-cutting  in time, the film could have been a terrible mess. But instead director Stephen Daldry created a masterpiece. He never stays too long with one woman, knowing the exact moment to switch to another story. But each story is fully engaging, drawing you in.
Equally as astounding, if not more so, is the superb acting by each and every actor. If anyone stands it, though, it would be Kidman. She absolutely becomes Virginia Wolfe in a restrained, sorrowful way. She deserves the best actress win here. Moore and Streep also give powerhouse performances, but Ed Harris's magnificent supporting role as an AIDS stricken man is as astounding as Kidman's. His physical transformation is astounding in itself. John C. Reilly also turns in a good performance as Moore's disillusioned husband, but no one performs less then amazingly.
The subject matter may be a downer, but that doesn't make the film any less perfect. How it deals with sadness and the desire for happiness is realistic for many people experiencing depression. The world we live in is far from perfect, and this film shows how if we're not careful, it can bring us down in despair.
The Hours is a rare, wonderful film that deserves any awards it gets Oscar night. Though it may not be very cheerful, it is one of the best of the year. It gets my highest recommendation.",1045785600,2,1876,4.790123456790123
1443607,4,B00005JKTI,"Boy, if you're feeling suicidal, this is NOT the movie you want to see- It might just push you over the edge!
  The film follows three different Women in three different decades: Nicole Kidman plays author Virginia Woolf in the 1940's, Julianne Moore plays a desperate housewife in 1950's suburbia, and Meryl Streep is a modern-day woman distraught over a dying friend (Ed Harris) and a cheating lover (Allison Janney).
Woolf is in the midst of a severe depression as she tries to write her famous book, Mrs. Dalloway; Moore's character, Laura Brown, is trying to cope with her own desperation as she reads the book; and Streep's character, Clarissa Vaughn, finds her life echoing the life of the book's title character. The ways in which these women deal with their problems are disturbing, to say the least, and I had a LOT of trouble feeling any sympathy for Moore's character in particular; Her final solution to her life's problems is loathsome and unforgivable. The performances by the three leads are spectacular, as is Ed Harris' portrayal of Clarissa's dying friend. It's easy to see why the Oscar voters bestowed so many nominations on this film. The revelation of the connecting thread between the Moore and Streep stories was a stunner; It's sitting in plain view for the whole film, but I didn't see it coming. It hit me like a ton of bricks. While not a happy experience, The Hours is certainly a rewarding one.",1045526400,7,1425,4.788617886178862

1443609,4,B00005JKTI,"Virgina Woolf (Nicole Kidman), Laura Brown (Julianne Moore)  and Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep) are three women apparently connected through the book MRS. DALLOWAY. Woolf as the author, Brown as the reader and Vaughn as the embodiment today. This is a complex and nuanced story that is translated to film in a very effective way. The scene shifts which gradually reveal the nature of the interrelationships among these women (both symbolic and real) are incredibly well directed, and the three stars are all superb. There are several additional excellent performaces, especially Ed Harris as the dying writer and friend of Vaughn for whom she is having a party (which mirrors the parties in the hours we experience in the lives of the other two women). In one of the strange turns of fate, Julianne Moore is cast as a troubled housewife in the seemingly idyllic fifties, thus in effect reprising her role in FAR FROM HEAVEN. And John C. Reilly does a great job as her seemingly clueless husband, recreating his role in CHICAGO without the musical routines.
The overlapping stories of these three women are emotionmally powerful, but I suspect that as some reviewers have opined this is one of those instances where the movie does not and indeed cannot do total justice to the book given the inherent limitations in its format. While the cinematography is striking and the scene cuts among the three time periods well edited, there is an incredible amount of information for the viewer to absorb and little time to contemplate the events. (At times it would have been nice to be able to press pause or rewind, or to be able to reread a chapter or put down the book to think.)
My sole caution is that this is a movie that is entertaining but not uplifting. Several reviewers have commented that it is about life, but the lives in this movie are not lives of joy. This is about people suffering from mental and physical disease (depression and Aids) who are living lives of quiet desperation and for whom the ultimate solution is sometimes suicide. These are people who even when outwardly appearing to cope with life with various degrees of success are frequently experiencing despair. My wife enjoyed the movie and was completely absorbed by the story and the powerful emotions that it elicted. While I agree that it was a well made film and an interesting story and was entertained by the excellent performances, I did not find it particularly compelling or enjoyable. However, I did feel that the surprise ending was excellent and was one of the factors that made me glad that I had seen the film.",1045353600,,2598,4.799107142857143
1443610,5,B00005JKTI,"I used to read a lot of Nietzsche and imagine that my interpretation was different from what other people think because I could trace elements of an intellectual death wish sweepstakes theme through the myriad other elements in his writings.  I once had a governor who was asked what he did on his vacations, and who he was with, and his standard answer seemed to be, ""I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.""  This movie has a lot of stories that combine the themes which make the intellectual death wish sweepstakes idea palpable that is explained best by the line, ""I didn't want the servants to talk.""
  The timing on this movie, matching the geopolitical and economic turmoil of our times so perfectly, might illustrate how well a society can also reach a tipping point.  We are all so busy waiting for the fairwell note from Saddam that our failure to have our way with Osama bin Laden is hardly noticed anymore, except by people who are so far out of the loop that they might be considered effete intellectual snobs for peace.  There might have been a war on in 1941, maybe just a phony war in which London hadn't been entirely blown away yet, but the movie was not entirely clear that anyone going to London could end up with a rocket in her pocket, instead of rocks.  The rest of the movie had such peaceful settings that most people would not think this show is about spending a trillion dollars for thermonuclear weapons, but that is what was going on in the twentieth century, long after Nietzsche thought that he was dynamite.  Who dies?  In this movie, it's a long, slow process, and the intellectual involvement is the most intense aspect of self-destruction.  Society, on the other hand, seems to be set for whatever happens to people who don't have the opportunity to seal themselves away somewhere with plastic and duct tape.",1045353600,2,1852,4.601823708206687
1443611,5,B00005JKTI,"After having read Michael Cunningham's novel, I could not imagine how a successful movie could be made from it.  With its three separate plots, I expected visual confusion and disjointedness.  Instead, I was stunned by how expertly everything was brought together.  The adaptation is both first-rate and insightful, excising the extraneous and focusing on the most crucial matters contained within the original novel.  ""The Hours"" instantly earned its place in my heart as one of my favorite movies.
The film begins and ends with the suicide of Virginia Woolf, a writer driven by madness and a passion for both life and death.  Director Daldry then jumps to the 1950's as pregnant Laura Brown wakes up to her oppressive suburban life, and then to the 1990's as Clarissa Vaughn jumps from bed to prepare for a party for her dying best friend, a poet striken with AIDS.  Just as quickly, the audience is taken back to Virginia Woolf as she, too, embarks on a new day, one which will result in her penning of the beginning of her famous novel MRS. DALLOWAY.  The beginning is probably the most confusing part of the film as Daldry establishes these three separate lives in three disparate times; however, once the first five minutes has passed, everything is strongly established and easily discerned.  The minimalist soundtrack composed by Philip Glass couldn't be more perfect for this story of variations on a theme; the music creates tension by crescendo, then retreats into its quiet repetition, leaving the audience gasping.  I'm not sure how many people in the theater realized how well the music manipulated their reactions.
Most of the action in this movie is psychological.  It is a film of close-ups, where a twitch or averting of the eyes tells volumes.  Because of this subtle nature, the acting must be brilliant and understated.  Fortunately, it is - and then some.  Nicole Kidman's portrayal of the tormented and brilliant Virginia Woolf is extraordinary; she IS Virginia Woolf.  Julianne Moore also turns in an expert performance, while Meryl Streep is, well, very Meryl Streep - perhaps too much so.  Claire Danes, in her brief appearance as Clarissa's daughter, illuminates and enlivens everything around her.  Allison Janney as Clarissa's lover Sally provides a competent and natural performance, although her role is more ornamentation than character.  So much has been said about the actresses in this film that one of the best performances is often overlooked:  Ed Harris as the dying poet, Richard.
If you hate art films or crave fast-moving plots, you'll be disappointed with the deeply psychological nature and thematic development of ""The Hours."" All others will be richly rewarded by this powerful, expertly constructed film about what it means to hold onto life and then let it go.",1045267200,3,2807,5.052060737527115

Based on Michael Cunningham's brilliant novel, ""The Hours"" is (and will be for years to come) a stunning, jolting time-travel between three different centuries that is so real, it's all just about you and I and right now. Starting slow, the film opens with the apparent suicide of classic women's writer Virginia Woolf. A few scenes, an introduction to her husband, and the hypnoyic under-currents of Philip Glass's music opens the film. You are suddenly wisked away to the 20th century(1950) in Los Angeles, where a frustrated housewife deals with her unhappy husband and lonely, confused son. Not enough, the story transports to the year 2000, and two women living together, dealing with the up-coming demise of one's former male lover from AIDS. You need to know more, but that's actually quite enough. Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore, Nicole Kidman, Ed Harris, Jeff Daniels, and a surprising Claire Danes complete the near-perfect acting core. Stabbing at age-old issues and opening the door on the unmentionable, ""The Hours"" builds to an emotional crescendo that is almost unbearable. You cannot take your eyes away. What is life about? Why are we here? Why am I married to this person? How do I escape this decaying marriage? Is suicide an option? How do I survive this very next....Hour. Deftly directed, expertly acted, ""The Hours"" is shocking...because it's real. It's hard to take. I sat down wIth a box of popcorn. The drama started unfolding. The guy next to me left the theater. Raw reality can hurt. ""The Hours"" is more than a melodrama about 3 lesbians and a series of unattractive males. It's about real people, and the consequences of what we do.

1443613,5,B00005JKTI,"""The Hours"" is a breathtaking motion picture experience. The three stories blend together seamlessly, and quite surprisingly, taking the viewer for an emotional ride into the lives of three women, so obviously tormented by their confined sexuality. Virginia Woolf is writing ""Mrs. Dalloway"" in the early 1920's England. Laura Brown is reading the book in 1940's Los Angeles, while trying to bake her husband a birthday cake, and Clarissa Vaughn, a book editor in 2001 New York, has been dubbed ""Mrs. Dalloway"" by her friend Richard, a bi-sexual writer dying of AIDS. The three female performances are magnificent. The supporting cast is a knock-out. Many people have called this film depressing, but I don't think it's depressing so much as incredibly true to life, and very real. The emotions experienced by these three women, and the people surrounding them, are no doubt emotions we have all experienced at one point. The film does not shy away from these emotions and that makes it all the more powerful. The words pouring out of the mouths of the characters have such strength and beauty, is it impossible not to be touched. It's fascinating movie-making and the shifting of time periods is absolutely wonderful. Nicole Kidman as Virginia Woolf comes up with the first sentence for her book. ""Mrs. Dalloway said she'll buy the flowers herself,"" she writes. Laura Brown, the exceptional Julianne Moore in her second Oscar worthy performance of the year, reads the sentence. Then Meryl Streep, as Clarisa ""Dalloway"" Vaughn, tells her lover, ""Sally, I think I'll buy the flowers myself."" It works amazingly well. No doubt many people will be turned off by the film, but one has to appreciate the beauty of such an exhilarating masterpiece. The pulse-pounding musical score, different for each era, only adds to the genuine emotion. This is truly one of the best films of the year, and all three women deserve Oscar nominations.

1443625,5,B00005JKTI,"The Hours may be the best dramatic movie I've ever seen. I watched it last night at the AMC Ahwathuki 24 with my girlfriend. During the first twenty minutes two couples up front in the theater got up and left and I could only guess from their grumbling and non-verbal communication that they were not pleased with the film. They kind of derisively laughed at the screen. It's that kind of movie.
At its core, The Hours is simply about a human being's capacity/incapacity to reciprocate love in the face of death. My girlfriend said she couldn't identify with any of the characters in the movie except Claire Dains because they mostly can *not* reciprocate love. Death is inevitable, so why give back love. I thought it was pretty callous and not true of her genuine character. My girlfriend and I talked about the film and our lives and ultimately I reminded her that she, too, felt that way once -- after her divorce -- she wanted to die, and no longer believed in love.
It's a universal theme and in the case of Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore and Ed Harris's characters in the film, they represent an extreme -- they just can *not* give back love in the face of death. And ultimately this is not what most of us want to hear from a movie or a book. We want to know that people can triumph in the face of a day-to-day life that ends in death. To quit, simply doesn't make sense to a great many people (to the point of denying such despair could even be real), and that might be why people who feel negatively about The Hours do feel negatively.
Meryl Streep's character is the most realized in that the character drawn for her *sees* both sides of the range (love in the face of death) and comes to some kind of affirming end. My own opinion is that the ending was the only place in the film that breeched being too melodramatic, but endings -- quite literally -- are difficult.
I would absolutely love to see Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep in another film where they were actually on-screen together for more time. The final scene between them was so intense as to be palpable. They are simply two of the best actors I have ever seen. Nicole Kidman was so good I did not even recognize it was her playing Virginia Wolff for the first few minutes in the film. However, her vehicle in the film was less real to me, in part, because of my own limitations regarding a capacity for love. Perhaps, I just would rather not admit it.
A complex film.

1443626,4,B00005JKTI,"The three big names get rave reviews from most. The best supporting performance however is not mentioned in reviews I saw, the one-scene job done by Toni Collette. A great actress. A beauty who hides her looks inside her roles, as in ABOUT A BOY and as the mom in that awful overrated flick about a boy who ""sees dead people.""
Some reviews call it sad. It is dark, not sad. Disturbing, not hopeless. Sometimes it feels like a stage play shot with a mobile camera and other times is more cinematic. The missing fifth star, the off-center part, is there is a slight air of hokiness, of ""how we doin'?"" about it, a trifle self-consciousness perhaps.
And don't miss the score by Philip Glass, some of it also off-center because self-imitative.
Claire Danes? I think she did her best work when she was 15 or so on a TV series, ""My So-called Life."" A mature and finished teenage artist, she seems to have grown into an incomplete adult artist. Skillful for sure; but the greatness gone, thus, off-center, but more so than the movie. I await her return to greatness. (And I plan to see the new Spike Jones movie with the once-perfect Anna Paquin and see how she's doin' as a young adult or aged teen.)
The three leads' acting styles do not quite mesh either, which may be another aspect off-centeredness, or may be because they reflect the difference of the characters they play.

1443627,5,B00005JKTI,"This is an excellent film made by Stephen Daldry.  Superb writing distinguishes it from novelist Michael Cunningham and its adaptation into film by experienced screenwriter David Hare.  In lesser hands, this delicate, poetic work probably would have been crushed.  That they utilized an ultra talented ensemble cast sealed this into solid A territory. It is about the quiet desperation that is the way we lead our lives in the hours allocated to our existence.  The only thing that ends the Hours is Death and, for some, like Virginia Woolf, the Hours become so untenable that death must be hastened along with suicide. The women who follow Woolf in the future face the same battles with The hours even though we/they have the benefits of more modern existence.  Some universals never change though and The Hours are etched in stone as a universal.  Every actor is first rate but the two to be singled out for breathtaking performances are Nicole Kidman as Woolf and Ed Harris as a dying poet.  I was able to more fully realize how talented Kidman is by not being blinded by her movie star looks.  She drastically changes her appearance so as to become Woolf and she also is the most extraordinary on showing what it is like to live The Hours.  Her scenes with a dying bird and at the train station with her husband are incredible.  Harris is just getting better and better from role to role.  Seemingly there is no role beyond him and he doesn't care how likable or unlikable his character is.  Whatever he needs to do to get the job done, he'll do it.  In this case, he is desperation and dying personified as a poet dying in New York City of AIDS under the bleakest of circumstances, who turns out being linked to all three of our desperate women in one way or another.",1044403200,3,1772,4.587301587301587
1443628,5,B00005JKTI,"This film is the first film in a long time where I actualy agree with the film that may or may not bring home the big Best Pic award at the Oscars. Normally that prize is given to the film that's the most showy and obvious. This film had the power to do something very few films can do today and that is, give the audiece some more credit and give them some more to think about afterwards. Everyone is wondering WHY they were so sad. In the great tradition of Mr. David Lynch I believe that we don't always need to be spoon fed the answers. Haven't you ever been sad and could not for the life of you figure out why? The human person is far more complex then to just sum things up in a neat package. It's far too easy to dimiss this film as a ""chick-flick"" and just say that women are too dramatic. Women are complex and beautiful creatures. They are far more keen to their emotions then men are, and that is what the film is about. I thought this was a striking film and simply one of the best of the year. But to me it does stand out just a little bit more because it had a wonderful conclusion and I couldn't stop talking about it afterwards.
And about the whole repressed Lesbian thing. That is far too easy an answer. The only Lesbian in the movie was Meryl Streep, Virginia Wolf and Julianne Moore did it out of a repressed longing just to be free to do whatever they wanted. It was a sign of inner rebellion. To dumb the film down into ""a movie about three depressed lesbians"" is an insult to the film and the three great actresses who brought it to life. Each performance was just an eye opening experience, and the cross over from past to present was very reminiscent of another great film of 2002, Adaptation.
In a time where movies are far too straight forward and peddle the audience with easy answers it's nice to see that film's still leave themselves open to interpretation. Lives are not so neat and easy to explain. When you can answer all the questions that come up in your life abouts sadness and joy then come back to this film and ridicule it, but if you cannot I suggest you watch it again and admire it for what it doesn't answer.

1443629,4,B00005JKTI,"During the first couple minutes of THE HOURS, it's 1941 and author Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) commits suicide by walking into a river. That pretty much sets the tone of the film as a whole.
The body of the film skips back and forth among three timelines.
In 1923, Woolf is forced by physicians and her husband (Stephen Dillane) to live away from the center of London in a dreary suburb after two suicide attempts. The author resents her isolation, and tells her spouse that peace is not found by being shielded from the world at large. Virginia expresses her frustration by writing a book, ""Mrs. Dalloway"", in which the protagonist, while preparing for a dinner party, is confronted by events that raise into consciousness the shallowness and inadequacies of her life.
In 1951, Laura Brown (Julianne Moore), living in a Los Angeles middle-class housing tract with loving husband Dan (John C. Reilly) and young son, is reading ""Mrs. Dalloway"". Contemplating her lack of fulfillment in the roles of wife and mother, Laura bakes her husband's birthday cake, plans his party, and considers suicide.
In 2001 New York, Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep) lives with her same-sex partner, while at the same time caring for ex-husband Richard (Ed Harris), who's dying of AIDS in a dark and cluttered flat. Richard is an award-winning poet, and Clarissa (nicknamed ""Mrs. Dalloway"" by her Richard) is planning a dinner party in honor of his accomplishments.
THE HOURS is a complex film, the heroines of its three subplots all linked by the threads of self-destruction, ""Mrs. Dalloway"", and the extreme emotional and psychological dissatisfaction each feels in the relationship with the man in her life. Clarissa is already in a lesbian liaison, and there are strong hints that the other two would welcome such. The performances of the four principle actors (Kidman, Moore, Streep, and Harris) are all of Oscar caliber.
There are perhaps as many messages to be gotten from THE HOURS as there are people who will view it. I perceived the velvet chains that bind two people in a relationship. (""That's what we do. We stay alive for one another"". - Clarissa) Chains that may drive one to an exit of desperation if there's an absence of love, or the feeling of one's own self being smothered and not having a little patch of ground to call one's own. And the guilt we feel when those chains are broken, if even to the long-term advantage of self.
This is a splendid and brilliantly conceived film that deserves all the honors it will reap. The connection between the 1951 and 2001 timelines was cleverly done. But, for me, THE HOURS had one great flaw. It failed to establish any emotional attachment between the main characters and myself. Virginia was too sour, Laura too distant, and Clarissa too self-absorbed. I left the theater admiring the movie for its artistry more than I was moved by it.",1043884800,,2883,4.861788617886178
1443630,5,B00005JKTI,"I went into the theatre without a great deal of enthusiasm, expecting three remarkable divas to do a great deal of talking elliptically with many pregnant pauses accompanied by meaningful staring into space. It is fair to say I am not imbued with delight at Virginia Woolf's style of writing.
I am happy to have to discard my unkind premonitions and admit a delight and awe for ""The Hours."" It is a visual treat from the beautiful English countryside to the lush palms of 50's suburban L.A. to Clarissa's funky brownstone in 2001 New York City.  And the ladies! Nicole Kidman's slat thin, gawky strained and repressed Virginia Woolf, Julianne Moore's tragically unhappy but luminescent Laura Brown, and Meryl Streep's teetering on the edge of despair, Clarissa.  All three were magnificent, and it is difficult to choose among them.  Ms. Moore's tremendous restraint gave a powerful, suffocating tension to her role that overwhelmed me with its brilliance.  My companion thought Ms. Streep was radiant.  But I certainly wouldn't want to slight Ms. Kidman who said so little, but showed so much.  Her scene with her servant (who clearly intimidated her) insisting that she must purchase ginger for treats was masterful comedy.  She was trying to be firm while almost fainting with revulsion at the sight of the servant carving raw meat in her kitchen.
The supporting cast were each a star in their own right, they were so perfect in their roles. I couldn't help but smile at the thought of how much Ed Harris must have enjoyed the all-out bombastic role of Richard, the poet dying of AIDS.  I hope the costumier, Ann Roth, is awarded her Oscar for the beautiful authenticity of the attire. She even remembered that silk hose, lovely as they are, DO tend to wrinkle.  The score, while charming, got a bit intrusive at times.  There was a moment or two when I felt a strong desire to say, ""Live for the moment! See the sun, your child, and your lover right now and rejoice--your life is not that bad"" but I was quickly swept back up (or down) into the magic.

1443631,5,B00005JKTI,"To me, the premise of ""The Hours"" was a little intimidating to me before I finally managed to see the film: Three women are linked through three time periods to Virginia Woolf's novel 'Mrs. Dalloway'. I was concerned that my blazing ignorance to Ms. Woolf's work, and this one in particular, would hinder my enjoyment of the film and my ability to understand it. Not so. Yes, 'Mrs. Dalloway' was at the root of the three stories presented, but everything you need to know is in the film. This is it, basically: Mrs. Dalloway decides one morning -- the morning of a party she is throwing -- that she will buy the flowers herself. Though she projects the appearance of togetherness and cheer, she is a lonely, empty woman inside. Oh, and someone dies at the end. That's it.
In ""The Hours"", we meet three women. First is Virginia herself (Nicole Kidman), and our introduction comes in the form of her 1941 suicide at the age of 59. A feminist Ophelia, she places a stone in her dress pocket, walks to a nearby stream, and lets it carry her away. Her brief, mortal stroll is voiced-over by her suicide letter, which explains to her husband that this act of desperation is to spare him the madness she feels is returning. The rest of her story takes place in 1923 as 'Mrs. Dalloway' is working its way out of her. Flashing forward to 1951, we see Laura Brown (Julianne Moore), depressed housewife of WWII veteran Dan (John C. Reilly) and mother of a young son. It's Dan's birthday, and Laura, in the middle of reading 'Mrs. Dalloway', decides that she will feel better today and bake a cake. Cut to 2001, and publisher Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep) is preparing a reception for author and friend (and long-ago lover) Richard (Ed Harris). Richard has just won a prestigious poetry award but is too ill from AIDS and related dementia to want to go to the party.
Each of these women are depressed. Each awakes and acquires flowers. Each has something special going on that day -- a party of sorts. Each of these women kisses another woman. They all face suicide, and they all face the choice between death and the imprisonment of life. They each make a choice. The variations on these choices, while sometimes disorienting, are exactingly faithful to each other. Sometimes they reveal themselves suddenly, consecutively. Other times they surface gradually, inconspicuously. Like Philip Glass' subtle, driving score, they build gracefully from a whisper into a cry and by film's end find themselves whispering again.
""The Hours"" is a miracle of a movie. Literate, involving, active -- it is that rare film about women and their unique experiences that neither excludes nor condemns the role of men in their lives. The men of ""The Hours"", Woolf' stoic and supportive husband (Stephen Dillane), Brown's husband and son, poet Richard, and his former lover Louis (Jeff Daniels) -- the sexual politics of the film are sometimes scattered but fascinating -- are innocent bystanders who, while making decisions to maintain or find their own happiness, neither victims nor devalue these unhappy women. Their depressions are unto themselves, and their lives entrap them in ways that their respective others cannot assist or understand.
All of the performances in ""The Hours"" are excellent, uniquely extraordinary, and utterly unforgettable. Ms. Kidman, unrecognizable behind a prosthetic nose, does more refined work here than I have ever seen from her. Her Woolf is depressed but never pitiful and always strong whatever the hardship. Ms. Moore, playing a very different '50s housewife from her ""Far From Heaven"" turn, gets it just right. In the midst of true depression, something as simple as baking a cake becomes an overwhelming, impossible task. Moore's battle with the cake is heartbreakingly sorrowful when she fails, yet somehow sadder when she gets it right. Ms. Streep, meanwhile, shows us again why she is Streep -- equally profound unraveling before the party and, in a devastating scene at the end, as she just listens to a voice from the past that puts things into perspective.
Sad, but never far from hope, ""The Hours"" not only also has an outstanding supporting cast (including Claire Danes, Allison Janney, Miranda Richardson) and superb direction from Stephen Daldry (""Billy Elliot""), it is also one of the finest films of 2003 and of recent memory.

1443633,2,B00005JKTI,"Like many film fans, I eagerly awaited this much-heralded movie.  This much must be said about ""The Hours"" - the performances are excellent.  Kidman, Streep and Moore do not disappoint - nor does Ed Harris in his portrayal of the film's most underdeveloped character.  The problem lies in the script:  ""The Hours"" is the cinematic equivalent of a barium enema:  It's overblown, bloated, vastly uncomfortable, embarrassing, pretentious, and ultimately unconvincing.  We never learn the reasons for the protaganists' overwhelming anguish, and for characters who suffer so intensely, that's an appalling deficit.  For example, Moore's brilliant portrayal of a 1950s housewife with an inner angst so pervasive it very nearly leads to destruction is, in the end, frustrating and disjointed.  Her character's connection to Streep's modern-day caretaker is meant to be cathartic, but it's just another laxative in a film that doesn't need any more artificial balms.  Sadly, I left the theatre with the same feeling I endured in 1984 after the barium treatment:  I'd had enough bombast for one day - and then some.  I felt as if I'd been put through the sensory wringer - to no discernible purpose.  If this is the filmmakers' idea of restoring my fading youth, they didn't pull it off with any surety.  Fake noses notwithstanding, ""The Hours"" doesn't ring true any more than Kurt Cobain's tepid, recently-published diaries, and is, in the end, unsympathetic.",1043193600,12,1451,5.229437229437229
