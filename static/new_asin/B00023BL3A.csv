8021092,3,B00023BL3A,"This DVD is only 14 minutes long which was a disappointment considering the price. Subtraction of fractions was not covered. I bought this for my son who struggles in math. He said the goofy acting was more of a distraction than a help. He also told me he is now more confused about fractions than ever. I am giving it three stars because the DVD was both amusing and clear to me. However, math is one of my strengths. For a struggling young person who doesn't ""get"" math, the DVD was no help at all.",1105142400,8,500,4.273684210526316
