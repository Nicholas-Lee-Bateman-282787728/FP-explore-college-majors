Transferred the videos with scanned covers to DVD. At one time the only way that anyone could see this series again after its initial viewing on PBS. was to either be a teacher or professor at a college because as far as I can remember PBS never sold this collection out right.

Eventually libraries started getting copies and soon after if you had perfect timing you could get, and probably can still get, original copies in library book sales.

I'm still waiting for the DVD release of the series.",1320278400,,653,4.572649572649572
8283420,5,B001BKXBE0,"Obviously one of the most remembered and imitated aspects of the 60's was what was known as the coulter culture. That world of long hair,colorful clothes and unusually hip lingo has become nothing but a fasion statement today but,at that time it was a calling-a flag of membership for those tired of the world of flat top crew cuts,pill box hats and drably colored wardrobes. One choice this documentary made is to treat the youth rebellian of the 60's as two seperate movements;cultural ald political. Whenever you watch a TV show or movie about the 60's,you end up seeing images of hippies holding pickett signs,preaching to end the Vietnam War,etc. However we find out here that,while many hippies shared an activist viewpoint their goals were primarily to influeces the culture of youth,not it's politics. Obviously this part of the series starts off with The Beatles being introduced to Americans,and how their unusual looks and anti authoritarian attitude spawned interest in a change in culture that actually had a lot of similarity to the Bohemmian set. Suddenly hair became longer,sex and drugs became used more widely and young people began to become in general more thinkers then do'ers. This developed into a rather controversial period where,while a new generation seriously wanted to change the nations culture they lacked they emotional maturity by and large to do so correctly;this led to an alienating generation gap between them and their often highly conformist elders. In the end it all winds up with Woodstock-which,as it turns out marks the end of the counterculture as opposed to a peak;the point where it began to become more a fasion then a lifestyle. After the excessess of the tragic Altamont concert and the life crushing drug experiences some of the counterculture contended with the hippy ""look"" became a lot more common then it had been during it's day,but the attitude and values either became assimilated into mass culture or just faded from view,as many hardcore hippies moved to the country to make a go of a more agrarian lifestyle as the decade came to a close. As for the other younth rebellian in America...that's another story. ***TO BE CONTINUED***",1235001600,,2189,5.0497237569060776
