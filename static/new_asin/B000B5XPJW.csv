It is about a Parisian couple who are very much in love. He is an actor auditioning for the role of ""Shylock"" in an American production of ""Merchant of Venice"" to be presented in Yiddish and directed by an acclaimed American director (played by Peter Coyote).

Be warned, a much-loved person becomes fatally ill and yet the film has an upbeat feel to it and ...get this... it's heartwarming!

It is beautifully acted by French actors, none of whom you probably would know by name, a couple you would recognize from character roles they have played in the past. I will be on the lookout for Stephane Freiss because he is gorgeous, is a wonderful actor and looks like he's related to Hugh Laurie.

Some reviews:
  - ""A winning illustration of loving that O Henry himself would have approved.""
  - ""A delectable French treat! Funny, romantic and poignant all at the same time!""
  - ""Engaging and undeniably moving!""
  - ""Succeeds at the tricky balancing act of mixing comedy and pathos. Peter Coyote steals the picture!""
  - ""A charming mixture of slapstick and sorrow. Great pleasure!""
  - ""A crowd-pleasing dramatic comedy about love, friendship, role-playing and Jewish pride.""",1346198400,,1300,4.8144796380090495

First off Berenice is as lovely, beautiful and charming in this one as she was as Peppy Miller. As the film begins she is as light and beautiful as a sunny day in Paris (okay. That was a little flowery, but she is a charmer.)  Without giving anything away the tone gets much darker as the film goes on and Berenice is up to the task. She is a wonderful actress. I had never heard of her co-star,STEPHAN FREISS but after seeing this film I'll be looking for more with him in them as well as he is terrific in a difficult part. The two actors play a married couple and their love for one another is palpable. Beautifully done.

My one problem with the film is that change of mood I mentioned above as it comes out of nowhere and seems contrived. Once you allow yourself to suspend disbelief it plays out well.  Interesting to see Parisian Jews and to hear Yiddish with a French accent! There is also one very touching moment where an old man who is clearly a survivor of the camps, defends who he is in the world.

Not a great film, but at a short 90 minutes, you could do far worse. And oh, that Berenice!!",1327449600,7,1269,4.205761316872428
