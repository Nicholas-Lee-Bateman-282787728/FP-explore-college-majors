7026252,5,B00TZ6Q6R6,Excellent movie ... We all can relate in one way or another to the loveable dysfunction in this family.,1436918400,,103,4.473684210526316
7026253,4,B00TZ6Q6R6,Pretty good story-line but dealt mostly with dis-functions. Bought mainly because of Sarah Hyland. good actress.,1435622400,,112,6.0625

7026255,2,B00TZ6Q6R6,"I hoped this movie would be entertaining, liked the dysfunctional family angle, but from the opening scene on, the characters were too over the top to be believable and it tried way too hard - and fell very short.  I watched it longer than I needed to, just because I'm a Sarah Hyland fan, but ultimately I couldn't stand to see it all the way through, I just didn't CARE what happened to anybody in the show.",1433203200,,409,4.311688311688312

7026257,1,B00TZ6Q6R6,"I wish I could give this movie 0 stars. There is not one genuine moment throughout the entirety of this film. Every character is a cookie cutout of what a human being should be, saying things and acting scenes the way a person in a movie should say and act. Many characters are ignorant to the world around them, and the drama is infused in a way where it's only there to be drama. Not one moment hits, no character is relatable, and in the end, I just hate the people who the writers decided to share with me. A pretty decent and sizable cast has nothing to do with the year's worst screenplay.",1431043200,,595,4.228070175438597
7026258,5,B00TZ6Q6R6,"There really is a little something (someone?) for everybody in this film, which I'd recommend for anyone 18 and over. Certainly a nice date flick, for both sensible people and some of the crazies out there! Lots of laughs, just enough sentiment and a somewhat peaceful ending to an unintended family ""reunion."" Sarah Hyland does a terrific job in her lead role and everyone else turns in nice performances, too.",1430784000,3,411,4.885714285714286

Great film.",1459900800,,108,5.352941176470588
8703455,3,B00TZ6Q6R6,"This was a very fun indie film despite it being a film that was a bit dark and heavy. It was a very good family film that deserves it rated-R rating but has morals for the family. As someone who loves their family, I honestly suggest you watch this whether you love them or hate them. Either way, you'll gain something from this movie that ties into norse myths.",1453507200,,362,4.260869565217392

8703457,1,B00TZ6Q6R6,"Terrible movie, hard to follow, just a bunch of disgruntled dialogue.  Better less popular movies to waste your time on.",1451174400,,120,5.0
8703458,4,B00TZ6Q6R6,"Yeah, I agree... I'm pretty tough on films. A lot of films given four or five star ratings, I don't necessarily rate quite so highly. And at the same time I feel that the Netflix rating of two stars for this film came in rather on the low side for this little snapper. Even though it certainly does not pretend to have any seriously top notch production values,  it is entrrtaining at what it does do, and a had a certain warmth to it that allowed a lot of room to be simply be what it was.... fun! Funny, and a bit thought provoking!
I think many people will be able to identify with certain pieces of the dysfunctional mahem in this family,...enough so, that at some point it will grab their interest and they'll find something in it to like about it and be glad that they hit the play button! More of a 3 star but I gave it a 4 just because I thought it had been given an unfair shake over at Netflix ;o)",1450051200,,907,4.095505617977528

8703460,4,B00TZ6Q6R6,"Given the 2.5 stars on Netflix, I was positively surprised.  Would have given 5 stars but it seemed to lack depth which may have been a result of too much editing (I'm just guessing) but the casting was great and storyline was interesting.  I was hoping it was based on a book so that I could get to know the characters and back story in more detail.  Anyway, good movie especially if you're burnt out on the standard snarky comedy available now (they are good too I'm just a bit bored with the same old satire..).",1449360000,,514,4.333333333333333
