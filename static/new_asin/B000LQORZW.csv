8163829,3,B000LQORZW,"Too dry for my taste. I wanted to use it for an all girls HS physical education class. This would not keep their attention.
However, there were  some good teaching tips for  me to use with them.",1393027200,,194,4.216216216216216
8163830,4,B000LQORZW,This is good but I personally would rather watch and learn from someone in person.  I love to watch professional shag dancers.  They make it look so easy!,1391817600,,154,4.464285714285714
8163831,1,B000LQORZW,"Boring....boring....boring......zzzzzz. He talks WAY too much, and it's certainly not fun for anyone below 80, in my opinion. Maybe good for much older people? YUK!",1387152000,,164,5.6
8163832,2,B000LQORZW,"If you are beginner, do not purchase. Nowhere near enough time is spent on the basis steps which everything else builds upon. Instead the DVD crams in 18 patterns and goes over these way too quickly. After trying to learn from this product, I found a dance instructor and learned more in 15 minutes than the hours I spent watching this DVD. I regret my decision to purchase this product and would advise a beginner to purchase as well. Very disappointing!!",1366588800,,456,4.6419753086419755
