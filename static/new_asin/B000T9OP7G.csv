2895210,4,B000T9OP7G,"The Good Things:
-Plenty of action and special effects, particuarly for a TV show.
-The drama is not bad.
-Everything seems to correspond well with the first two movies (they're making the show under the assumption that T3 never really happened...oh well).  T2 did tie up all loose ends, but the show acknowledges this, and the characters have to find out how Judgement Day continues to happen.
-Characters are true to the first two movies (Sarah Connor seemed too weak at first, but she took on her usual tough-woman attitude very quickly).
-The guy playing the terminator is not as great as Schwartzenegger, but he does okay for himself, and has a few menacing moments.
-The other actors are fine.
-Some good ideas and more insight on the terminator universe (more on time travel, futuristic weapons, and so on).

The Bad Things:
-Some of it feels like the same old thing...Sarah and John are on the run again!
-No liquid metal terminators (at least not yet...)
-Some of the camera movements were jittery or hyper.
-Will we ever see the world end? This could become a very long and drawn-out saga...

Even though the first few minutes of the pilot episode had me worried, it quickly redeemed itself.  It fits well with the first two films, the action was swell, and the drama was not too boring to watch.  Unlike most other shows, I enjoyed watching this, and I hope to see more episodes.  Reccomend watching T1 and T2 first.",1200528000,58,1427,4.688

I especially enjoy (using their characters' names) Sarah, John, Cameron, Derek, and especially Agent Ellison who really works in that role, perfect casting. Laslo is very good also, I love his facial expressions and the way he mimics the first terminator in his motions. They are worth the price of admission as well as the great effects and music. The story works and the time travel once again works into it. Recommended for any fan of the movies.

2895279,5,B000T9OP7G,"One of the best sci-fi series there was.. until Fox terminated it for no reason. We'll never see season three, and should I ever build a time machine I might be tempted to go back in time and take out the Fox exec's mother who was responsible for it's cancellation. Seriously.

Summer Glau was quite believable as the complicated, ""more going on than she's letting on"" terminator Cameron. Brian Austin Green plays a soldier from the future, and surprisingly does a strong job, especially in Season 2's  Episode 5 ""Goodbye to All of That"". Lena Headly does a solid job at Sarah Connor, and Thomas Dekker as a teenage John Connor was completely under-rated. It was a solid cast, a superb plot and story arc and premise. The show was just getting off the ground, and had there been a Season 3 would have gone in an awesome direction.

Ah, forgot to mention two others in the cast. Shirley Manson (from ""Garbage"") plays a seriously cool bad/good terminator.  She has acting chops that I wasn't expecting. Garret Dillahunt is one great actor, who plays Cromartie/John Henry. He brought a bit of personality to the whole stone-cold emotionless terminator character. ""Thank you for your time."" (fake smile).  Leven Rambin plays John Connor's girlfriend and was quite a good actress. Last but not least, Stephany Jacobsen is just dan good in anything she is in.

So thank you, Josh Friedman, for this show. It was one of the truly best and in my mind, trumped any Terminator movie that came after T2. We saw what you were doing with the show, where you were taking it, and it was killed off in it's near prime. A tragedy, but none-the-less I'd rather have had two seasons with a cliffhanger we'll never know the conclusion on, than never having seen this show to begin with.

2895303,4,B000T9OP7G,"First season impecable, five star.  Regarding the second season; if Sargent Bilko was not quite so aggressively nasty, and the young John Connor (well schooled in subterfuge), showed more sense about associating with an obviously insincere damaged-goods person, and they kept the amazing Summer Glau more in the foreground, I may have rated season Two with five stars.  Also there is too much that goes on without closure such as Ms. Weaver; What is it?  Who's side is it on?  Why does it murder indiscriniately? And how did Riley reemerge from the future after it was established that she had been completely in the dark about what was really going on while she was attempting to infiltrate into John's life to distract him from the beautiful Cameron, who, though a machine, wouldn't be the first to develop, evolve to quality human emotions:  ""I love you John.  And I know that you love me.""

2895311,5,B000T9OP7G,"When Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles came out on television, I was immediately intrigued. I did not know what to expect with it being a Terminator television series rather than a movie. It starred Lena Headey, Summer Glau, Thomas Dekker and Brian Austin Green.  It aired on FOX.

In the year 1995, at the end of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Sarah Connor, her son John and the 800-series Terminator successfully destroy the T-1000, as well as the arm and CPU chip from the Terminator sent back to 1984 in the first film. The T-800 from the second film, at its own request, is then also destroyed to eliminate any future technology that could be used to create Skynet through reverse engineering. Despite this, at the beginning of the television series, a T-888 using the name ""Cromartie"" is sent back to 1999 to kill John. ""Cameron"", a Terminator that John sent back from 2029 to protect his younger self, leaps forward in time with John and Sarah to the year 2007 in order to prevent a delayed Judgement Day once and for all. Now wanted fugitives with the fear of pending leukemia playing on Sarah's mind, they must also face the reality that other enemies from the future could be after them.

The show at times seemed great and interesting.  But at other times, it was very predictable.  You knew nothing was going to happen to the stars of the show at episodes end most likely.  That makes it hard to imagine the worst to becoming the worst.  In a movie, anything can happen.  And, characters die.

Summer Glau does play her character as a Terminator as well as can be.  I enjoyed how she carried her character amd portrayed being a Terminator.  When she is fighting a larger Terminator can be a bit unbelievable at times not being defeated more easily.

Lena Headey was okay as Sarah Connor.  But, the title of the show made it seem like she was the main and most important character of the show when she was really not in the episodes.  I understand it was a show about what she experienced, but one would thing she would be the main character all episodes centered around and it was not the case.

I was not very interested in Thomas Dekker playing John Connor.  But, the John Connor character is hard to pinpoint how he should be portrayed being the potential future hero and leader of the resistance.  But, I still did like the show very much.  It was very interesting filling in the timeline, and seeing what and how the writers would continue forward in the series.

Terminator is a very good franchise, and any media regarding it is interesting.

I recommend Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.  I liked that much of it was centered during our current time.  I wanted to see how the series would move forward to make sense in the Terminator universe.

The show lasted two seasons from 2008 to 2009.",1457740800,2,2821,4.598

Summer Glau was magnificent as Cameron Phillips, the beautiful teenage female Terminator sent back in time to protect the teenage John Connor. Glau created a mysterious Cameron. Does she love John or want to kill him? Can Cameron really feel emotions or is she simply the best infiltrator Skynet ever created?

Lena Headey and Thomas Dekker star as mother and son, on the run from ruthless cyborgs.  The writing staff has not given the audience the usual coldly calculating more-than-robots, however.  These relentless cybernetic organisms can be, by turns, warped, a bit unpredictable, and even funny.  They lie as well, sometimes at interesting points in the story.

2895411,4,B000T9OP7G,"The most recent and indeed upcoming Terminator movies, while profitable, can no longer adorn the legacy of T1 or even T2 - each offering is staler and further from that original glory. Enter Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.
How misguided was my initial hasty snubbing of the show as yet more tacky franchise hijacking - and I hadn't even watched it yet!

I NOW STAND CORRECTED:

This show is the WORTHIEST SUCCESSOR to Cameron's masterpieces. Friedman & Co. have done utterly sterling work expanding and resuscitating the universe, art, mythology and science of Terminator in ways which baffle and inspire even die-hard followers.
In a time when the masses are switching off their TVs, this show brought out more depth and food for thought than anyone would've expected from sci-fi TV.

We witnessed the sci-fi horror of a Cyborg re-clothing itself in living ""Human"" tissue in a sequence eerily recalling the antics of Clive Barker's original Hellraiser film character Frank Cotton. Stunning work - riveting homage.
We are even walked through a Skynet slave camp complete with obsolete early-model Cyborg jail-keeper whose plastic features and shrewn ""hair"" give him more than a fleeting resemblance to the dreaded Michael Myers mask from ""Halloween.""
The show neatly captures the deeply immersing dark, mysterious, ominous ""night-time"" feel we all recall from X-Files. There's even a cryptic reference of sorts to Red Dwarf!
Such tasteful grasp of, and tribute to a wide palette of genres and screen classics is much appreciated.

There is a fiery moral, philosophical and emotional core which continuously questions and re-imagines what humanity should be and is heading toward, and whether it is something that can, or even should, be ""saved"". The romantic, domestic & comedic threads are equally gripping too.

This is the only mature, accomplished subsequent offering on par with T1, often surpassing the more childish, trivial aspects of T2, while incorporating its most essential elements.

Definitely buy this, and ask yourself why the *bleep* this incredible show was cancelled in favour of much of the unoriginal, brainwashed, vegetative drivel which pervades the modern viewing world.",1411430400,,2203,5.316091954022989

If you missed it when it aired you need to see this series. I felt the movie series started going a little sideways after the second film.

2895439,4,B000T9OP7G,We have enjoyed watching it. A little too much teen angst from young Connor. He questions his ability to lead almost as much as the viewer should. Summer Glau character very similarly played as her Firefly's River but much less depth.,1403049600,,234,4.7317073170731705

What's not to love about this series?  It has robots from the future, resistance fighters, current-day humans, just trying to understand the strange goings-on.  It has good terminators, bad terminators, and terminators that may or may not be good or bad!  It has our hero John Connor and tells the story of his coming-of-age.  And Summer Glau.

2895464,2,B000T9OP7G,Poor acting. Makes it seem more like a B rated movie with a low budget. Don't expect the best acting skills. Maybe they'll get better as the show progresses.,1400976000,,157,4.448275862068965

The character development helped no end in my understanding of Sarah Connor and all she survived in the effort to help John,and his cause, survive.

2895470,5,B000T9OP7G,"This series is absolutely amazing.  The acting is superb!  Lena Headey quite honestly plays a better ""Sarah Connor"" than Linda Hamilton did.  Take that with a grain of salt though, because Hamilton really defined the role and character, with Headey pretty much taking the role to new heights and dimensions based on Hamilton's portrayal of the character.

Thomas Dekker really pulled off the ""John Connor"" role as well.  And, of course, who wouldn't like Summer Glau in anything she plays in??  Seriously though, the entire cast was absolutely exceptional.

The writing and story lines were great too.  I really felt like the series was true to Cameron's movies, as well as a great tie-in to the Terminator 3 movie.

The only thing I don't like is that Fox decided to cancel the series at the end of season 2.  They did this without any warning or giving the writing crew a chance to properly close out the series.  As a result, Season 2 ended with a cliff-hanger.  Personally, I think this ought to be against the law ... but I digress.

2895475,5,B000T9OP7G,"Season one of Terminator is wonderful.  If you are a T1 and T2 fan, you will love this extension.  No doubt some purist will find things to dislike...but compared to T3 this is pure fun and intriguing. And it's just a TV show!

What happened in season 2?  Bad writing (too many cooks?), bad casting (you will cheer when unlikable girlfriend of John is, um, removed), bad character choices (of all people Derek would put the mission first, not allow secrets and affairs to rule him), no John Connor development as a leader.  It fails on so many levels....and I was trying to like it. All the promise of season one foolishly squandered. There are a few good episodes in two (the last episode, the terrific Lauren Fields character (resistance fighter) in Alpine Fields), but not like season one at all.

Season one is worth the watch.  5 stars.",1400198400,,841,4.604026845637584

However, I am glad I gave this series a shot, my wife and I have both been really enjoying it.  Its worth noting that my wife was never a fan of science fiction.  For her to be engaged in such a complex story line speaks very well of the show, in my opinion.

What I've noticed though,  is that the robots have a tendency to miss their shots quite a bit. I would have thought that a robot, with its computing ability would never miss a shot.  But if you ignore the inconsistencies,  it's a great show. Oh, and if I were the robot king I would send the terminators to terminate Sarah's parents.

2895502,5,B000T9OP7G,"To a Sci-Fi geek like me, TSCC is an exhilarating experience.  To me, the series' main accent was not on the action, but on the questions such as determinism vs free will, interaction and comparison between a human and an AI, and ethical questions arising in a guerrilla-style warfare.

The character development in the series is a guilty pleasure.  John Connor grows from a rebellious teenager to an unwilling leader, terminator Cameron - from a blunt instrument to a machine trying to understand and experience human emotions, Catherine Weaver - from T-1001 to a mother of one machine and one human child, and John Henry - from a computer program to play chess to the artificial intelligence that values human life.

Last but not least, TSCC portrays a fascinating place where the terminators cite the Biblical parables to justify or explain actions.  One of my ( many ) favorite moments is when Cameron explains to Sarah the Biblical reference to the story of the brothers of Nablus.  Another great moment is when John Henry asks his terminator ""mother"" Catherine Weaver about the story of Cain and Abel.  There are quite a few other references, which may be interesting to a man of faith.

In conclusion, TSCC is one of my favorite shows.  I understand that some people may find it boring, but I believe that for any inquisitive mind, it is going to be a delicious treat.",1398038400,,1375,4.767932489451477

Good plot line, good cast-Lena Olin who is currently the queen in Game of Thrones, Summer Glau, who was in Firefly and is currently in Arrow are great, as is the character who plays John Conner.

2895506,4,B000T9OP7G,I have already watch the series once before and I'm coming back for another look. New twist from any other 'Terminator' type shows. An interesting fact is that the series creators knew the show was going to be canceled at the end of the season so they also created a appropriate ending too for their characters.

A bit annoying. Then the final episode ... the subtitles were for a completely different show (Pushing Daisies)! So I wasn't super impressed with the caption service.

As for the show itself ... it was good. I'm not really a Terminator fan, but figured I'd give the show a try. It didn't really keep me super engaged. The robot gal was completely human-like before we, the audience knew she was a robot (her first interaction with John) and then after that she reverted to robotic ways. I'll probably continue on with the second season, but I'm not in a rush.",1396742400,,734,4.603053435114504

Really hate Amazon getting me and others hooked on great series then pulling out the rug wanting to charge a fee for next seasons. This is like a used car salesman hook and bait.

The FBI agent is an idiot, John's mom is overbearing, the liquid robot queen is a stupid bitch, and Skynet is basically correct in its conclusion that humanity is superfluous. I don't know why John Connors is resisting - I guess its just what he does.
Will we resist?

The others in the series weren't as good, but worth watching, once.  The only reason I rented this was for Summer Glau.  However, this tv series surprised me.  The plot and acting were fantastic, for a television series.  They took full advantage of the format to develop the main characters much more than in the movies, especially John Connor.

2895555,4,B000T9OP7G,"The Sarah Connor Chronicles is very different from the Terminator movies. Where those were self-contained movies with a single terminator, the series has multiple interweaving story lines with multiple terminators. However, the show works, generally. Lena Headey actually makes a compelling Sarah Connor, although she doesn't quite look like Linda Hamilton. Summer Glau, always the expert at playing emotionally distant characters, makes for a great terminator. The special effects on the terminators are good enough to be convincing for a TV show.

Where the show falters though is in the overarching story. Individual episodes are good at keeping your attention, but the overarching story is a bit fuzzy. Sarah Connor's goal is of course to stop Skynet, but that goal seems so distant in most episodes as to be irrelevant. The plot has a lot of dead ends and character development comes in fits and spurts. In some cases there are more immediate concerns, such as saving yet another person who is important to the Resistance in the future, but it's hard to become too invested in these arcs knowing the outcome.

In short, this is a fun series, but it's not clear that this is a story that needed a TV show.",1393113600,,1209,4.9507389162561575

Lena Heady as Sara Conner was the perfect actress for the roll. So wasn't Summer Glau as the Terminator. They were both forces to be reckoned with. Plus, they are both talented and beautiful women. I loved Summer Glau in Josh Weaton's Firefly tv show and movies. Can't understand the network stopping these shows so early. I know fan's tried to petition the network's to revive the shows, but of course they wouldn't listen. Now Firefly is considered a SiFi classic.  Thanks Amazon Prime for letting me revisit one of my favorite , short lived SiFi shows, TERMINATOR - THE SARA CONNOR CHRONICLES!!!!!!! Now if I can just get it back on the air with new shows.

The acting ranges from acceptable to good. Unfortunately, like Pushing Daisies, viewership fell off between the abbreviated first season and the second season due to the writers strike that occurred during season 1, and the show was cancelled before its time.

Terminator: Sarah Connor Chronicles was that show. I've always loved the Terminator mythos and especially loved the fact that this Terminator followed John and Sarah more instead of focusing on the Terminator character. I also like the fact that the events within take place after the Termintor 2: Judgment Day and Terminator 3: Rise of the Machine movies.

Lena Heady did a good job as Sarah Connor as did Thomas Dekkar and Summer Glau as John Connor and Terminator Cameron. The script was great and I loved the settings.

Season 2 was also great and that's what makes this series cancellation worse because there was so much Terminator history to build from that the series would still be going today.",1390521600,,915,4.670807453416149

But taken on it's own this does a good job, With a female terminator sent back to protect the conners. It is a fast moving series. And sadly it never got farther than season two. It was well made and acted too. Summer Glau is great in this one, but then she's always very good in most roles she does!.  In hd this looks much better than the dvd set by leaps and bounds. This was shot in hd film, so this is the way you want to go with this set.  Fans of the four movies should find much to enjoy with this series.  It was a fan favorite but it never had a chance on network tv.  You see that a lot in tv land. few sci fi shows last even three seasons.!  This didn't make it past two.

I say a bit thinner on special effects - than the Terminator movies.
My concerns - are mostly about it turned a bit too much into (attempts) at more emotional drama - than an intense action TV show.
The 2nd season - even more so. Still - I never understood why it was either canceled or not picked up for season 3??

2895660,5,B000T9OP7G,"To see John Carter(Thomas Dekker) as a kid or young man was a very good approach to this franchise. In my opinion he was a troubled genius.  Like most of them are. Leana Headey and Summer Glau were fantastic. The constant barrage of  terminators and the concept of time travel and paradoxes kept this show interesting.. What a toll it took on the writers and staff to constantly come up with  materials every week. But what fun too.!! I would highly recommend this show to any us who are  interested in computers and/or our computer generated world.

2895661,5,B000T9OP7G,"No Commercials - - - ALWAYS a BONUS ! ! !  Watching the ""Sarah Connor Chronicles Season 1 without commercials made the show much more enjoyable for me.  The continuity was just ""there.""  I saw Season 1, for the most part, when it ran on TV.  I did not initially appreciate Sarah (Lena Headey) because she was always worried.  Well, I have learned that her character has to be worried - she is trying to avoid an apocalypse. None-the-less, it wasn't until I genuinely appreciated her the 2nd time I saw Season 1 without commercials.  Season 1, John Connor (Thomas Dekker) was a boy.  As the young John Connor, I believed.  He was a great kid and knew he was meant for greater things and, I believed.  Cameron (Summer Glau) is amazing in anything she does.  Her dancing skill took her into the Terminator role with perfection.  She was a child in Fire Fly but as Cameron she is a female Terminator.  James Ellison was such a kick for me to see back on the Tube! I loved him (Richard T. Jones) in Judging Ammy as Bruce Van  Exel.  As James Ellison, he had the right stuff to match Cameron as well as Sarah.  He is just FUN to watch in this scifi series.  Garret Dillahunt as Cromartie was exciting but as John Henry, he was amazing.  The interaction between Ellison and John Henry was fabulous and the quality of their dialog was, again just FUN ! Sorry I blended Season 1 and Season 2 with Ellison and John Henry.  Season 1 and Season 2 are seamless with Amazon Prime.  We just joined again for the second time - I love Amazon Prime particularly when they throw in some freebees I didn't know about.  Sarah Connor Chronicles Season 1 - EXCELLENT ! ! !

From script to execution, this show delivers a quality punch and is one of the best shows I've seen in some time. Too bad it was yet another victim of the dreaded Friday night timeslot, and another botched decision by Fox to cancel one of the best shows in recent memory (Firefly, etc.).

This show takes James Cameron's 1980s Terminator mythos and raises everything up a notch. This is a direct sequel to 1991's Terminator 2 (the other movies are conveniently bypassed). Some of the ethical quandaries in this show are very thought-provoking. For instance, is it 100% inevitable that mankind will eventually create a machine that is capable of creating even better machines? Is it ethical for mankind to forbid this? Does that make machines nothing but a slave-race?

In short, the Sarah Connor Chronicles presents ethical dilemmas that would make Trekkers proud. Match this with lots of action and a very well-assembled cast, and you have an excellent show that was cut way before its time.",1384300800,,1087,4.934426229508197

I can't believe I didn't watch this when it was on TV.  I really wish a lot more people would have because there's only 2 seasons and I so wanted to see more.

i was WRONG.  Period.

Turns out this is a great series.  Yeah, there's a ""mom's perspective"" integrated throughout the show...but hey, we're talking about SARAH CONNOR here.  Turns out she does more than just whine and emote about her ill-fated son.

Oh, she does plenty of emoting.  But the driver of this show is the action, and giving us glimpses of the world(s) in which John Connor developed helps flesh out the genre quite nicely.

They've got a great cast, too.  Many, MANY great actors playing what may turn out to be ""the role of their lives!""

I avoided watching the SCCs because I felt they would be a crappy spinoff. When searching for Prime material to watch in the SciFi area, I skipped over this series many times. I finally decided to give it a chance based upon a recommendation from my sister and a lady friend. Two women that rarely watch SciFi stuff giving this show a good recommendation????

The lead actress, Lena Headey, goes a fantastic job. I did not feel any actress would be able to replace Linda Hamilton in this role but I was wrong. Headey reprises the role well in both attitude and appearance. She is a woman determined to see her son survive and nothing will get in her way.

The supporting actors also do very well. River Tam from Firefly does a great job playing the protector Terminator named Cameron. Brian Austin Green and Thomas Dekker are well suited for their roles.

Like Firefly, I would love to see this series given new life.

The writing is, however, somewhat machine-like which, despite the topical consistency, really doesn't help a show revolving about a conflict between man and machine intelligence of his making (and bent - somewhat tritely and arbitrarily - upon his destruction).

Like so many sci-fi series (The 4400, Revolution, and Continuum come to mind), there's a premise with a question or mystery with the promise of resolution at the conclusion.  In between, are serial complications, surprises which either tend toward the denouement (revelatory, in other words) or temporarily confound linear progress toward same.  The writers' job is to inject both variety and some plausible necessity into succeeding episodes so that these are not experienced by the viewer as mere placeholders... excuses to pad the series out for as long as may be required.

In that last, Terminator actually does better than most... but it is not a Fringe, a Fast Forward, or a Doll House.  One nice turn, though, is that the audience is made to care about the central android played by Summer Glau (recognized for her role in the Firefly series).

The story lines were also great, and awesome effects, so props on the writers and special effects guys on this TV series. There were a few creative liberties as with any spin-off, but they meshed well into the story.

The actress who plays Sarah, just can't convince even a baby child that she is the real Sarah that we saw in the movies. She is too delicate, centered and respectful to be the mother of the leader of the resistance! I mean, the real Sarah was locked in a hospice! No way anyone could ever think of sending this Sarah to an hospice.

I think they stopped the show at the ultimate point where their fans were finally coming together thinking ""Gosh, this is getting good, give me some more"" and then they do the amazing thing about sending John into the future and nobody knows him and the story ends?????  WTH
This could Have gone on for several more seasons with what ifs???  So sorry to see it go.  Had a good cast, killed off some good cast, but I like that sometimes you have to be realistic and somebody has to die - nobody lives for ever.

Sorry to see it go - maybe they can come back with ah on-line version like Sanctuary started out and we  can pay to see the next episodes and the end.  What an ending it could be.

The dichotomy between how humans and robots view a situation is always fascinating, I love how Cameron views emotion as an effective tool. The best stories are not about the terminators designed soley to kill but have specific missions and seeing how they go about doing them.

2895777,2,B000T9OP7G,"The writers are searching for a story that they never find. If they had condensed season one into a single episode, they might have had an interesting pilot. Not much happens in the nine episodes of season one.

Too many characters are introduced with too little character development. Scenes are short and jump from one character to another. Are the writers trying to figure out which characters belong in the series? (John's chemistry lab partner doesn't.) Or perhaps they hope that rapid scene shifts will prevent us from noticing that there is NO STORY.

There were too many flashbacks. They were unnecessary, dull, and occasionally confusing.

On a positive note, the casting is good. I found Lena Heady instantly believable as Sarah Connor (yes, she looks different and plays the character differently, but it worked for me). Summer Glau is fascinating in her role. The good guys are likable and the bad guys look like bad guys. Finally, there are fewer of Sarah's silly voice-overs than there were in the second movie.

One of the best television series ever. And I have high standards, for me M*A*S*H and Hill Street Blues are the zenith of writing and acting- but this is also up there with them.

Brilliant!",1369440000,,457,4.772151898734177
2895783,4,B000T9OP7G,"I should note that I'm a huge fan of the franchise, even of extensions that others don't like (such as the third film, or the games). As such I'm more open-minded than most, and I've noticed more than a few things about this series that others have been missing.

First off the premise, and the descriptions given by others, can be very misleading. This series is by no means a 'true sequel to T2', nor does it replace or ignore T3. This series is really a sequel to the established story. It alters the timeline from a previous point and causes the entire story to scew into something completely new. If you really want to get the most out of this series, watch it after viewing the films (and if you want, playing the games).

Secondly, the series itself does have some flaws that could be deal breakers to some. For one thing, you'd best be a fan of modern 'indy' filming. The series will barrage you with a series of split second shots and unsteady camera work. Most of the time you won't really be able to tell what's going on. Some people like the energy this style has, others find it confusing and even annoying.

The acting is solid all around, but the writing can be so-so. The series bounces between action sci-fi with a well developed plot and a soap opera for teens. It quickly becomes clear that the reason they set the series in modern day and violated the timeline was so they could focus on John's struggle with puberty. As such there will be times that Sara and Co. will be fleeing and fighting various Cyborg death machines and uncovering conspiracies, and other times we watch as John goes to school, feels awkward, and tries to get friends (mostly to get laid). It does have the spirit of the films, but it also has a strong vein of 90210, Beverly Hills, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

It's still a great show, especially by modern standards. But it is by no means perfect, nor is it set between T2 and T3.",1369267200,,1927,4.419718309859155

2895787,5,B000T9OP7G,"This is such an underrated show. It has some great action sequences and an excellent thematic score, but it also has a ton of subtleties that make it worth watching and re-watching.

2895788,5,B000T9OP7G,"This series had a lot of interesting things to say, some cool tech and robots fighting.  Between robot fights and explosions it wanted you to think about things.

This is one of Sarah's narrations when she may have come across one of the creators of Skynet:
On July sixteenth, nineteen forty-five, in the mountains outside of Los Alamos, New Mexico, the world's first atomic bomb exploded. The white light pierced the sky with such intensity that a blind girl claimed to see the flash from a hundred miles away. After witnessing the explosion, J. Robert Oppenheimer quoted a fragment of the Bhagavad Gita, declaring, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."" His colleague, Ken Bainbridge, put it another way when he leaned close to Oppenheimer and whispered, ""Now we're all sons of bitches.""

The stories are well connected and the characters are solid and well acted although it takes the young John Conner awhile to get his head in the game. It isn't as specail effects hweavy as the Movies but there is enough action and explosions to satisfy.,1368230400,,306,4.482142857142857
2895798,5,B000T9OP7G,Very we'll written and directed series. If u like the terminator but u have a hard time understanding it's paradox then this show will help explain. The show follows what the original creator in visioned with a twist. This was a good show and when originally aired it was put on the Friday Night line up so it was doomed to fail. I wish it has ended better...,1368230400,,359,4.294117647058823
2895799,4,B000T9OP7G,"I really enjoyed for the most part. It was intriguing exploring how far they were going take human simulations for the various android like or robotic creations. Some of the boy/girl stuff between young Connor and his girlfriend were a bit tedious,but necessary to a point. I am just sorry the the series,like so many, did not make it beyond the second season. But clearly something must have gone wrong for the viewership to drop like it did. Either that or the series poorly placed in the time slots and did not get enough exposure. I usually don't watch anything beyond 11 PM and if this was the case,its no wonder it failed and was dropped. Anyway it was good and could have been great if given a chance,but I feel maybe just 2 more seasons would have been sufficient to rap it up on the Armageddon theme.",1368144000,,809,4.472972972972973

""Arnold Schwarzenegger"" Arnold acting style put terminator on the map it may be the good one liners Arnold had.
These TV actors just don't cut it sometimes. Like the Matrix talk is all quiet and you cant hear them sometimes. Special affects are good for a TV show but its full of Misandry messages. Just like terminator 3 a female terminator is a better model and can do anything.",1367193600,,450,4.5

The longer Sarah Connor wages her war against the machines, the more she shows her fatigue and despair, while John Connor understands his role but desperately tries to hang onto some semblance of a childhood.  Meanwhile, [FBI] Agent Ellison begins piecing together the Connors' story and gets caught up in the future war in his own way.  Too bad it was under-promoted else it would easily be in its 6th or 7th season by now.  Ah, well, Lena Headey is making good in Game of Thrones.",1367107200,,633,4.824074074074074

2895808,4,B000T9OP7G,"This TV series takes up shortly after terminator 2 Judgement Day and leads partially up to the Rise of The Machines.  Even though the ratings were not what the corporate executives expected, the series needed a third season to properly wrap up this portion of the story.

In many ways, it was more interesting than the movies in my opinion.

The only serious critique I have is of how the character John Connor is written; he's kind of a lame whiner for ""the leader of the resistance."" The acting is fine; it's the characterization that's off, and for that I don't blame the actors.

Im happy i got it cause now i can watch when ever i want and the simple fact that i cant get it anywhere in my small little town.

2895822,3,B000T9OP7G,"The show is interesting. There is a lot going for it but unfortunately I think it is due to the setup from the movies. The writing of the tv show is actually really bad, the actors try to do their best but the sophmoric and stupid ""realities"" the writers create are so frustrating at times you just want to stop watching. Every character is two dimensional and they always do things they know better just to create tension. Also I got so tired of all the charcters ALWAYS against each other. You would think that because the end of the world is near they might set aside their stupid feelings and work to gether. They are always tough and trained exept when they need to be, they always figure things out except when they need to and the civilins always accept what is going on even when there is no evidence. Really annoying. Sarah's monologues are really bad and you just want to fast forward or turn the sound down. Basically, the writing is really bad.

When I opened the package I realized something was different. The DVDs case did not have a slip cover. Although disappointing, I was still happy to have the series. I opened up the case to find only the 3rd of three discs. I was ANGRY.

I contacted the company in hope to get the other two discs. I no longer had time to watch the DVDs before I left after the holidays, so now I just needed to get what I payed for. After a couple of hours I was contacted through email.

I was fully refunded for my purchase, and that is the only reason I gave it two stars.

The email went on to console me saying this normally doesn't happen (that's great and all but it did to me) and then went on to explain that they DON'T HAVE TO SEND ME ANYTHING.

I was not interested in this show when it aire don television, as I am rarely interested in television shows as I am overly pessimistic and think they look.. stupid. Well, I bought prime for the shipping and decided to check out this show. I immediately got hooked. Some reviewers stated that they felt there was a lack of story behind some characters. I never understood this. I get annoyed with flash backs and back story fill. The bit that this show did was more than enough for me. Flash backs and back stories just hinder forward progression in my eyes. Yes in the second season John becomes a little more ""emotional,"" but I felt that this was a good thing. he is a High School teenager, and it shows. You can't just make him some badass kid that saves the world right then and there.

Overall, good show. Wish there was another season.",1341619200,,921,4.411764705882353

2895918,3,B000T9OP7G,"This isn't really a review...it's just me complaining so here I go.

I hate it when TV shows/movies use the old staples of ""we only use 10% of our brain"" and ""why is the sky blue"".  We use more than 10% of our brain.  That has been proven and is just a false statement ([...]).  As for the sky being blue, the explanation is called Rayleigh Scatter or small particle scatter.  Small particles in the atmosphere scatter light, and these small particles are more likely to scatter radiation of shorter wavelengths such as blues and violets.  The eye picks us the scattering and sees the sky as blue.

As for the show itself...it's getting better than the pilot but not by much.  Still seems like some missed potential.",1338422400,,716,4.5390625
2895919,3,B000T9OP7G,"I turned the show off half way through the pilot the first time around.  There were a lot of little things that annoyed me, and I just thought the ridiculousness would continue.  After hearing good things about the show and how pissed some people were about it being canceled I decided to give it a second shot.  This time I watched the whole pilot, and I believe it's good enough to continue on but there are still a decent amount of minor annoyances in this episode:
-not realistic clip size...no body reloads
-the male terminator opens up his leg to take out a gun which I assume is from the future (because it's in his leg)...but it's a standard pistol from 1999
-male terminator turns to the class saying 'class dismissed'...he's a terminator.  He wouldn't make a funny quip he would just continue chasing John
-female terminator has more humanity and personality than expected (although we don't know her past so she/it could have been taught to act that way)

Now don't get me wrong.  I'm not a person that has to have everything be realistic, but there is only so much ridiculousness I can take before I give up on the show.  If the show is a character driven show I'm much more likely to forgive minor things (like Firefly and Lost).  But at this point I'm just not sure if this show will rely too much on it's mediocre unrealistic story or if there will be quality character driven moments.

I'll let you know when I make my decision.

Update**
Episode 5 of this season seems to be the turning point.  This episodes was very well done, and it was the first time the audience got some back story via flashbacks and learned a little more about the characters.  For the remainder of the season it continues in this vain, and becomes a pretty decent show.  I hope it's now found its footing and continues in this way for season 2.  For now I would upgrade to a 4 star rating.",1338422400,2,1881,4.446064139941691

The worst thing about the series was that it ended very open ended, as it was getting very interesting. I would love to see a season three, but its probably too late for that. I hate how series always end in the middle.",1335657600,,487,4.191489361702128
2895921,1,B000T9OP7G,"The only value to gain from watching this series is that the writing is so bad, you wish Sky-Net would take over the world sooner.

I never make a negative comment on a brand new concept because at least it is an experiment in entertainment, but, the Terminator formula is not new, it is a very basic plot about a relentless killing machine which travels through time to kill a human. The fact that the machine has no feelings, looks scary and it is unstopable makes the first Terminator a succesful story, and even though one would think that replicating the same formula would be easy as pie, yet, sequel after sequel, year after year, new untalented writers and producers manage to pitch their idiotic ideas and alter the original plot to the detriment of Terminator fans. This TV series is a perfect example of how you can take a good concept (The original Terminator) and turn it into garbish.

I don't really blame the actors, I can see how they are trying their earnest while the director and the writers are pissing the Terminator franchise away, not hard to do after Terminator 3. In any case, starting an episode with a cheesy dream sequence is stuff I have not seen since my first year in film school. No imagination.

Months ago, when I saw this pilot at Comic-Con and it was awful. After a second viewing on TV, it realized it was worse than I thought.

Watching the free pilot on Amazon was great because it allows you to fast-forward over all the bad parts, that is 90% of the show just to see Summer Glau, the only reason why anyone would want to see this mess is her. Poor Summer Glau does not look at all like a Terminator, the laws of physics go out the window when she fights heavier meaner robots, because of her natural sweetness she is clearly a misguided casting choice, the role of a mean killing machine may end up killing her career. She does not handle it as well as she did on Serenity and I truly hope she makes a difficult professional choice and quits this series before it is too late and get a job doing something more suitable for her.

There is so much that is wrong with the execution of the Chronicles, for starters the ""concept"" is completely misguided, a series about Sarah Connor and her son, no exactly an interesting pair. The fact is nobody cares about this pair of dysfunctional misfits getting shot at every five minutes (unless you are a misfit who gets shot at all the time). When they aren't docking bullets, there is lots of repetitive filler chit-chat between them, it is a soap opera, just not a very good one as it could have been.

Of course, if you came here to buy something that you can get for free on your TV, then your definition of ridiculous could be different from mine, and you may love this show. For the other half of the population, I would say stay away and do not support bad television.

There is only one reason to watch this show, and it is of course Summer Glau, who is still yummy eye candy even while surrounded by the absolute mediocrity created by the writers. To what she would probably say: ""Take a picture it will last you longer.""

I just watched the last episode ""The Devil's Hand"" for free on TV just to see if there were any improvements or merciful evolution in quality, and it was just as bad if not worse. On this one they have Summer learning ballet! I am sorry but if Arnold had danced ballet on the original movie...no one would have come to see the movie and there would not be a series.

Of course, the series has been inexplicably renewed despite the bad reviews, not surprisingly since it was renewed by the same people that made the mistake of making it in the first place. (Fox is notorious for dragging a dead horse until there is nothing left to squeeze out of it) Don't think that because Fox hasn't canceled the show that means it has good rating, all it means is that it is cheap to produce and the actor are been payed miserably. ""Galactica"" is a perfect example of a show that no one saw when it was on cable and now they are trying to shove down your throat.

Remember, if you don't buy this episodes then you are forcing them to write better shows in the future...no pun intended.",1334620800,2,4185,4.395348837209302

When I saw the commercials on the TV for this series, they did nothing to dispel my opinion about what this would be. So I skipped it. But when I saw this as free for Amazon Prime members on my Ruko box, I gave it a try. I was hooked. Watched Season 1 and 2 and really longing for more. The stories are very well done (some slight slow spots from time to time, but a minor issue for me.) Most of the acting is very well done and it flowed very well. I strongly recommend it for any Terminator fans that might have missed it.

Note to the Terminator franchise: This is what the movies after T2 should have been like. You should make a full length movie using these actors and the plot lines from this series. I think it'll work. And you need to get more with the fans on how to market this series. The commercials on the TV did nothing for me to make me want to watch it.

The directing, acting, production and casting is the equal of any great SiFi series you may know like BSG or Stargate Universe, IMHO.

Lena Headey playing Sarah Connors is adequate although I prefer Linda Hamilton. I think this is just a matter of taste on my part. Thomas Dekker playing John Conner I find more convincing with more screen presence than Edward Furlong in Terminator 2: Judgement Day. I find Furlong spends too much time screaming in a way I find very annoying in Judgement Day. This could be the fault of the directing I suppose. Nick Stahl as Connor in The Rise of the Machine was far better than either Furlong or Dekker. I thought Stahl was perfect for John's part . . . moody, introverted but with the ability to take on a commanding presence when needed which Dekker doesn't really seem to have.

Speaking of The Rise of the Machine, Clair Danes is a wonderful addition to the cast of The Rise of the Machines, IMO. And what about Arnold. Well . . . there is only one Arnold.

An interesting alternative supplied in The Sarah Conner Chronicles is Cameron Phillips playing the helpful Terminator. Summer Glau is a screen stealer in almost every episode. She is cold, calculating, lethal and everything a Terminator should be.

The excellent cast continues with the acting of Richard Jones as FBI agent James Ellison, and Brian Austin Green as Derik Reese, cousin to Kyle Reese, father of John Conner.

i like and appreciate amazon. it is still good to look a bit before ordering. last night i came across t2 in a collectors edition for $5.

Then comes 'Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles' and that question was answered.  Though with the recent movie being Terminator 3, the thought of the writing or anything like how that movie was done was in the back of my mind hoping that the show wouldn't be like how that movie turned out.  Surprisingly after nine episodes of the first season I was like this has to be one of the best shows out there and more interesting than most shows especially when it comes to any live action show out there these days.

The 'Pilot' episode was well done and it was like 'WOW!  This show definitely has promise and FOX would have to be idiots to screw it up.'.  Each episode it tells about how Sarah and John are trying to find a way to keep Skynet from being built however they can go about doing so.  In the process they find out the machines are back and making their fight that much more important as an attempt to stop Judgment Day from happening.  The premise is similar to that of the second film where there's one 'Terminator' sent back to kill John and one to protect him, but that's not all.  When being taken to the year 2007 they soon find out there's a 'Terminator' with a specific mission to carry out to help Skynet be ready for when the war starts.  It's interesting to see that they make nods to the first two movies like 'Cameron' for example named after 'James Cameron' along with other things.

Sure that this season is only nine episodes long not as long as other shows like this, but long enough to get a story going to set itself up for a second season, which that was longer.  All in all only nine episodes I want to say that they were good, almost perfect possibly, but that's only me.  One of the things is that the episode 'Demon Hand' does have a extended cut of the episode with this release.

2895954,5,B000T9OP7G,"REVIEW CONTAINS SOME LIGHT SPOILERS

OK, so this show really surprised me.  It works incredibly well in spite of itself.  On paper, TSCC had all the makings of a franchise-killing epic fail.  I'm trying to imagine how they pitched it:

""OK, so we're gonna take this big-budget chase movie that's pretty much been played out conceptually, and make it into a weekly TV series...But instead of Arnie, we're gonna put in this really hot robot chick!  And the dead hero from this first movie, it turns out he has a BROTHER nobody knew about...yeah, and we got this guy from 90210 to play him!  Can you believe it?!  Oh, and the lead singer from a 90s rock band with no acting experience!  It'll be great...""

It's an idea so wonky that only Fox would try it, resulting a show of such surprisingly high quality that only Fox would cancel it after a mere 1 1/2 seasons.  TSCC turned out to be smart, tense, disturbing, and surprisingly emotional in ways that reminded me more of genre classics like Blade Runner or Ghost in the Shell than the litany of StarTrek and StarGate spin-offs.  Briefly (and like I said, it looks wonky on paper) - John and Sarah Connor find themselves once again the target of the SkyNet program they had thought they had 'un-made' at the end of T2 (we'll ignore T3 and T4 here, as everyone should), which has <gasp> sent a terminator back in time to kill John Connor.  They are saved by another reprogrammed terminator sent back by future John Connor to protect past John Connor, and subsequently time-travel forward to 2007 in order to go on the offensive and try to destroy SkyNet before it can be created (also conveniently skipping over the 3rd movie and setting up an 'alternative timeline').  They aren't the only ones with this idea though (ignore the time-travel paradox, really, please do) and rapidly discover that the war against the machines is being fought across time, with both the human resistance and SkyNet sending back teams in order to alter the past and gain a strategic advantage in the future.  The result is a show that is part mystery, part action, part coming-of-age, and part character study.  Oh, and part creepy psycho-sexual tension (i'm not giving any more away on that one).

The real heart of the show is the characters, and the cast (and writers) of TSCC really do a superb job.  Lena Headey has the biggest boots to fill as Sarah Connor, and manages to acquit herself well against the iconic Linda Hamilton.  She takes full advantage of the TV format to flesh out Sarah Connor as a person, and seems to really enjoy asking the question ""what is Sarah Connor like when nobody is shooting at her.""  Thomas Dekker takes over from Edward Furlong as a 15 year old John Connor, and despite my initial reservations he makes some very smart choices with the character.  His angsty, guyliner victimized grungy teenage John Connor really gets under my skin a few times during the first season, but in the same way that an actual angsty, guyliner victimized grungy teenager would.  This is a John Connor that needs to grow up, and the initial frustration I have with the character makes his maturation later in the series much more rewarding as a viewer.  Derek Reese, brother of John Connor's deceased father Kyle, makes his way into the show in the middle of the first season portrayed by none other then Brian Austin Green.  I really didn't think the guy had it in him, but he does an excellent job with a gritty and morally complicated character, so much so that I actually forget he was in 90210 most of the time I'm watching him.  They are backed by a supporting cast including the fantastic Richard T Jones as an FBI agent struggling to reconcile his religious faith with the discovery that Sarah Connor might not be crazy after all, and Dean Winters as Sarah's paramedic fiance she left at the alter but whom John brings crashing back into their lives at a moment of crisis.

The real stand-out though is the terminator Cameron, played by the much-loved geek princess Summer Glau.  While it's perfectly reasonable to assume high praise for Glau is just collateral Whedon-worship from Firefly, I must object in this case and recommend actually watching the series to see why.  Glau has the difficult task of stripping as much human texture and expression from Cameron as possible, then turning right back around and serving as the emotional flash-point for most of the major character drama in the series.  Where most science fiction falls woefully short is by anthropomorphizing the 'other' (alien, robot, whatever) into a completely human character that just looks physically different.  A prime example is the mega-hit Avatar, or as I like to call it ""Dances with Wolves in Space.""  Where I think Glau (and the writers) really stand out in TSCC (and what I don't think the series gets nearly enough credit for) is never letting the characters or the audience forget that Cameron is not human, and never will be.  She is simultaneously curious, naive, and lacking in malice, yet capable of shocking violence and the kind of sociopathic problem solving that values human life only as it relates to John Connor's survival.  Glau's performance as Cameron is critical to most of the really interesting things that happen as the story unfolds, and she walks a very fine line with near perfect balance.  I can't imagine the show working with anyone else.

So having heaped praise on Glau, you might guess that the relationship between John and Cameron (and it's affect on everyone else) is the big character conflict in the story, and you would be correct.  TSCC manages to eschew or outright mock just about every bad coming-of-age story cliche, and moreover they use Cameron to ask a lot of existential questions that fly under the radar if all you are doing is watching for the explosions.  Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of explosions, gunfights, and enough general mayhem to suit an action franchise, but that's only half the story, and the less interesting half at that.  The show manages to weave carefully from touching and hopeful to disturbing and sinister with surprising agility, and thankfully never plays any of the character relationships for cheap gags or contrived attention-grabbing scenes.  If anything, it's the really subtle moments between characters that have the most impact, which is a rare thing in sci fi TV.

In terms of episode quality, I will warn you that the first season starts out a bit inconsistently.  Every episode has at least a few scenes in it that really shine, but there is definitely an adjustment that goes on in the first half of the season before the writers and actors really settle into the characters in a way that feels completely consistent.  After that though, there is a solid trajectory that propels the series straight through to the end, with only the occasional squabble between the producer and the network about including a few 'stand alone episodes' that seems to plague every serialized TV show.

I'd highly recommend TSCC to just about anyone with even a passing interest in science fiction storytelling, though I suspect that your enjoyment of this series may have an inverse relationship to your enjoyment of T3/T4.",1282521600,5,7232,4.779742765273312
2895955,5,B000T9OP7G,"I never watched this season while it was on TV. Friends recommended it to me, but my feelings were, ""Meh"". While I enjoyed T1 and T2, Terminator 3 left me traumatized. I finally broke down and rented the first DVD of Season 1.

The acting was intense and it immersed me into their world.

Character development: Some things are rightfully never explained, but inferred. Summer Glau's performance as Cameron (a Terminator) is a prime example, Cameron seems capable of putting on emotions like a person would put on clothing, sometimes they are dressed to the nines, other times not so much. Yet as a viewer I'm not watching Summer Glau. Not really. I'm watching Cameron, I'm watching her behave and try out emotional responses. Her transitions are subtle and often eerie... a machine trying to appear human at times and trying to become human at others. There are differences between her and the other Terminators such as she can make her eyes glow blue (obvious difference) and that her visual display is often fully color instead of the other terminators using infrared. Her motives though stated become giant questions in my mind, after watching her as a Terminator skillfully lie to those she claims to serve and protect.

The pacing of character development appears to be a rule adhered throughout the series, no matter which writer wrote an episode or which director directed. Wonderfully crafted.

I could write pages about all of the characters and the thought that went behind them. The actors did an amazing job (Lena Headey shows a great mix of being incredibly strong and emotionally vulnerable, you'll believe that she's on the brink of despair and giving up, but it's only her willpower and strength that keeps things going).

The individual episodes are for the most part extremely well written and directed. The choreography of the fight scenes are pretty good for a TV series (and re-affirms the Terminators bash each other into things motif from T2) and are completely believable.

All in all.. this is surprisingly awesome.

I bought both Seasons on DVD and have purchased about 6 copies of Season 1 which I've given away to some of my other friends so that they can watch it too.",1280102400,2,2198,4.86096256684492

The plot would change on a dime leaving episodes hanging and turn in a new direction.  The producers said that it was because Sarah kept pulling up stakes and settling somewhere else. Lena Headey, a British actor did an outstanding job portaying Sarah, a messed up American girl, made so by the establishment who wouldn't believe her story.  I fell in love with Summer Glau who portrayed the teenage Terminator, Cameron.  One of the reasons why the show didn't make it was that a lot of mothers didn't want Cameron to be a role model for their little girls and would not let them watch the program; one such mother was my niece.

2895963,5,B000T9OP7G,"Honestly, it boggles the mind that this show, which was the highest-rated new scripted series of the 2007-08 television season had only a two season run. It was very good and Fox dropped the ball as far as cancelling it after the second season. Well, as many of you know, this show takes place in between T2 and T3, with the result that T3 never happens given the time travel that the characters on the show do. In T3, Sarah was supposed to die of cancer in 1990s, but since Sarah and the gang jump to 2007, they jump over the year in which Sarah would have died. Sarah, of course, keeps worring that she will still die of cancer and the first season makes it a point for the viewer to remember whose Chronicles these are - not John's. The first season brings back threads from T2, such as showing what happens to Dr. Peter Silberman and bringing back Dyson's widow who, with great reservation, helps Sarah (who hasn't aged a year) continue her fight against Skynet (fearing that more innocent people will die simply for playing a role in constructing Skynet). We finally get to meet Derek Reese, John's uncle. Meanwhile, Sarah finds herself trying to explain the past to Charley. Given a telivision show budget and everything they managed to pack into the writer's strike shortened season of just 9 episodes, it's amazing how good Sarah, John and their terminator protector Cameron look dogging Agent Ellison (an FBI agent is putting everything together) and Cromartie, the terminator on their trail.

2895965,5,B000T9OP7G,"Ok, I know I made a pretty strong claim in my title, but it's true.  I don't watch TV very often, mainly the Science Channel and other geeky educational channels.  I've seen several decent shows in the past but this takes the cake.  Why?  This show is extremely smart, well written, well directed, well acted, and has very realistic special effects.  If you think this is going to be just another action-packed piece of junk that's just trying to cater to people who want some special effect eye candy, think again.  I have never fallen in love with a show before, but I couldn't help getting emotionally wrapped up in the characters and story line.  The characters are not only complex, but watching the character development unfold is just unbelievable.  This show has left me speechless, in shock with my jaw dropped, and in tears.  A TV show has never made me cry until now.  This show makes you think. Deeply.  It makes you question what being human means.  So if you want a show that you don't have to pay attention to, something that is superficial and mind-numbing, watch Dancing with the Stars.  On the other hand, if you want a show that actually MEANS something and has a point and a purpose, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles is the show!  Just don't turn your head or blink when you watch it because you might miss something ;-)",1260921600,3,1347,4.581589958158996
2895966,4,B000T9OP7G,"I did something with Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (TSCC) that I rarely do: I purchased the complete show on DVD without so much as watching a single episode during its run on broadcast television or reading even one review.  The reason for such a brash move? Well I've always enjoyed the franchise in its feature film form and figured that the weekly format would be a spectacular medium in which to fill in the gaps between the films.

As such TSCC does just that.  In fact the series could be viewed as Terminator 2.5 if the motion-picture timeline is one's gauge of measurement.  If you'll recall, Terminator 2: Judgment Day ended with Sarah Connor, her young son John (with the help of the 800 ""Swartz"" Series Terminator) manage to destroy both the liquid-metal T-1000, as well as the arm and chip from the first film's 800 Series Terminator.  The film was set in the year 1995 with a then ten-year-old John Connor.

Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines jumped ahead to 2004 where a nineteen-year-old John Connor is living ""off the grid"" in the areas surrounding Los Angeles after the death of his mother.  It turns out that Judgment Day did not occur in 1997 as had been predicted in the first film due to mankind's intervention to the timeline, which postponed the prophesied events.  As is the robots of the future's way, another Terminator has been sent back in time (this time the female T-X unit) in effort to pick off Connor's future lieutenants in the human Resistance.

TSCC begins in 1999 with a fourteen-year-old John Connor still living with his mother on constant run from both destiny and evil cyborgs. Following the movie-formula, the duo finds themselves pursued by a T-888 Terminator unit but aided by Cameron, a female (800 Series) Terminator that has been re-programmed and sent back through time to protect John.

But before you go and get used to life circa 1999, the crew make a desperate escape by time traveling to the year 2007 and in the process jump right over the time where cancer should have claimed the life of Sarah Connor.  The Terminator in pursuit in 1999 uses the eight years of their absence to reconstruct his damaged chassis and is quite alive and well by the time 2007 rolls around.

It gets worse still for our protagonists once they discover that that Skynet has in fact sent many Terminators back to the year 2007 for a whole variety of missions ranging from the execution of key resistance members to the physical construction of the network and facilities that will eventually become Skynet.

The bottom line is, and like the movies, our heroes have their hands full in what boils down to present day in effort to change future-history.  The good news is, as an hour-long episode format, it works.  The shows build with absolutely beautiful pacing, intense action sequences, and solid scientific explanations without tech overload.

I wasn't sure what to expect going in; after all, many of the films demanded an R rating to tell their tale not to mention boasted budgets that put even the ritziest television budgets to shame.  I can state with confidence that producer Josh Friedman recognized these limitations and went about crafting the source material into a television effort with style and grace.

The acting is well above what's typically associated with made-for-television action drama efforts and the effects, while slightly pale compared to the efforts of the last two feature films, are easily on par with (and at times surpass) the visuals of the first two.

More impressive than the acting and visuals however would have to be the story/ plot structure itself which manages to take many of the elements that have made the films so enduring, and interweaves them with a slightly more dramatic feel than that of the movies (which were typically mass-destruction chases).

My only complaint lies not with the show in particular but rather some of the typical snafus and paradoxes that the series (and time travel in general) call to mind.  Questions of predestination and multiple (parallel) existences can detract from an already difficult-to-follow timeline if the viewer allows themselves the distraction of pondering such things.  As has been the case with all of the Terminator incarnations thus far, it is best perhaps to suspend disbelief and simply enjoy the ride.

The show was one of those that suffered due to the writer's strike and hence consists of only 9-episodes for the first season.  Coming in at a total runtime of 394 minutes, the show spans 3-discs and contains a healthy dose of extras including staff commentaries over three episodes, audition clips, gag reels, and several deleted ""Terminated"" scenes. The second season was boosted to 22-episodes before ultimately meeting its untimely demise from television.  A shame really, as the show managed to surpass most of my expectations.  I'm working on the second season now and will review that one upon completion as well.",1257897600,2,4965,4.909090909090909
2895967,4,B000T9OP7G,"I am about half way through this season so far, having just bought it. I was curious as to how this series was, since I never heard anything about it other than they had made one. It was on sale so I purchased it...

Boy, am I glad I bought it! It is a load of fun and action and the drama's pretty good too! The actors and actresses all fit their roles well (while she is a good actress, the Lena Headey playing Sarah Connor is too skinny - Sarah, especially in the 2nd movie was way buff because she was preparing for war - this lady just looks like all the other way too skinny hollywood women trying to look tough. I find it really hard to believe that being so thin she could be as physically strong as she is portrayed to be, but eh, that's Hollywood/America these days). Oh, and like someone else mentioned in their review: some of the filming quality/cuts were very shaky/jumpy and abrupt which is distracting but not so bad that it ruins the show. Hopefully they fix this problem in the second season.

I AM disappointed the season is so short - but they have done such a good job on it. I am just hoping the second season will be as good. If you like sci-fi and the Terminator movies you should definitely enjoy this. It is a blast! It expands on the Terminator world too, which I always enjoy - things they don't go into detail on in the movies they can explore here. Definitely worth the price of the sale price, however for it being such a short season (only 3 discs, totalling 9 ""hour"" long episodes)I wouldn't pay over $20 for this. $15 would be ideal, but I paid $18.99 which wasn't bad - less than the price of most 2 hour movies (and this is about 6.5 hours long total).",1257379200,,1688,4.20679012345679
2895968,4,B000T9OP7G,"This season comprises only nine episodes, so it might seem as though it's over before it really gets started.  But, after having watched many shows with 26 episodes per season and wishing some of those episodes hadn't been made (Star Trek: The Next Generation, for example), this show comes across as tightly written and focused. A shorter season forces the writer(s) to make every episode great.  When you've got to bang out 26 episodes, you're bound to get some clunkers, which isn't the case here.

The show starts with Sarah and John Connor hiding in middle America, where they live with Sarah's unsuspecting boyfriend, a nice guy who knows nothing about Sarah and John's past.  Pretty soon, a ""bad"" Terminator rolls into town and attempts to take John out at his high school, where he's helped by a ""good"" Terminator, played by Summer Glau.  That pretty much sets up the start of the show, with the Connors and the ""good"" Terminator taking flight.  I won't spoil the story for you, but only say that the pace picks up from there.

Screenwriter Josh Friedman has done a good job fleshing out the gap between Terminators 2 and 3 here.  Lena Headey (Sarah), Thomas Dekker (John), Summer Glau (Good Terminator), Richard T. Jones (FBI agent), Garrett Dillahunt (Bad Terminator), and Dean Winters (the boyfriend) all do a fantastic job.  Glau is especially convincing in one episode where she contemplates killing one of John's high-school friends.  Most surprising is Brian Austin Green of ""90210"" fame.  He plays Kyle Reese's older brother and appears to have matured from his younger days into a solid actor.

2895972,5,B000T9OP7G,"I can't say enough good things about Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (TSCC). It's not a ""Terminator of the Week"" show. It's a drama with excellent writing, acting, character development and stories that happens to have some action.  It's an intelligent show - I've seen the entire first season multiple times and each time, I pick up on something new.  It makes me think.  The writers often leave things open to interpretation, which has fueled my imagination and left me wanting more. Bear McCreary's soundtrack is fantastic and adds another layer of brilliance to the series.  This is a series you'll want to watch over and over again.

TSCC is a story about a mother struggling with her son growing up, while literally having the survival of humanity on both their shoulders. It is a story about a boy becoming a man learning how to become the future leader of the human resistance.  It's a story about how to deal with knowing what the future holds.  It's a story about hope.  It's a story about technological progress. It's a story about war and the human effects of being a soldier. It's a story about perseverence.

You won't find a simple story with clear lines between good an evil.  Characters do what they think is best given their missions and the information they have and that may or may not be the right thing or ultimately best thing.  They make mistakes.  They do the wrong thing.

TSCC has trumped HBO's Rome (also an excellent series) as my favorite series ever and that is saying a lot.  I've enjoyed some other sci-fi movies and shows mostly on a casual level, but TSCC has completely tipped the scales and turned me into a full-fledged geek. No series has even remotely come close to engaging me like TSCC has.

If you enjoy this series, be sure to also purchase the second season, which is released on Sept. 22, 2009.  The second season adds firey Scottish singer Shirley Manson (Garbage) and Battlestar Galactica's Stephanie Jacobsen to the amazing cast.

This series, its characters, its story: ICONIC.  This is a half told story.  This was Josh Friedman's Terminator story.  It is the greatest.  And I love him for it.  It is the greatest, and I love it, and they killed it.  The only hope I see for its return is if the sales for Season 2 on September 22 are monumental.  The sales would speak volumes and get attention.  It's the only way I see.  They need Josh Friedman to make the other two seasons to finish the story.

Buy Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles Season One and Season Two on Blu-Ray.  Then you have yourself the complete story (so far, if it returns).  Season 2 does have a very appropriate ending.  It's beautiful as the last moment of the series.  But knowing there was more coming and it getting canceled, that is just wrong.

2895980,5,B000T9OP7G,"I just finished watching the entire series over about a 1 week period. I saw almost all of the episodes on TV and just missed so much trying to follow along week to week. Then I purchased the DVD season 1.

Wow! This series is just amazing. The writing is some of the best I can remember seeing in a Sc-Fi TV series in a long time since possibly Star Gate SG-1 or Firefly. Sure it's not a perfect tie-in to the movies, but the movies lost me after #2. Movie #3 is good, but #4 was puzzling. This DVD series makes up for all of that.

The final episode was so incredibly moving. I can't imagine that I would have felt it as deeply watching each episode one week at a time. Watch these back to back to back and it will have so much more of an impact on you. How many TV shows can you say that about?

Really good acting...effects...writing...tensions...stress...plot...

This series adds to the Terminator mythology in a very profound way.  For example: How long was the T-888 married to that lady without her suspecting he was a terminator? It made love to her and she totally liked it! Then in the end of course it terminated her! It's what they do!",1247356800,,1149,4.276497695852535

However, to my surprise, the first season has so far proved to be entertaining. It's hardly Shakespearean, but it is effective, works with good special effects and has some reasonable acting.

My personal favourite is Summer Glau playing Cameron the allied Terminator. This is a deceptively hard role to play, and she does it well, and is provided with some nice script touches that add humour.

The other cast members are competent, and though none are brilliant, they are good in their roles.

2895984,5,B000T9OP7G,"I was skeptical when I heard that The Sarah Connor Chronicles was coming to the small screen.  How could it do justice to such a powerful big screen franchise in this medium?  Very well thank you.

I was won over almost immediately by the total experience of this series.  Rarely, does an amalgamation of diverse professionals come together in such a symbiotic relationship to deliver such wonderful entertainment. I waited anxiously for every new episode and watched each one.  Then surprisingly, for me, I bought the dvd.  I have *never* bought a seasons dvd for *any* TV show.  I would not have done that for just any show.

The totality of the TSCC experience is such that I can watch episodes over and over and each time I discover previously unnoticed nuances that entertain and delight me.  This show is more than a production of ""pretty people"" although, it does have an attractive cast.  Rather, all aspects of production work wonderfully together to enhance the viewing experience. The camera work is superb taking you through unexpected angles and perspectives that will delight you.  The direction makes the most of the talented cast's efforts. Most TV seems two dimensional, as if you were watching actors on a stage from 20 rows back. With TSCC however, the viewing experience is more three dimensional.  One feels as though they were actually standing in the kitchen during one the Connor family's discussions, for example, thanks again to direction and camera work.

The entire cast, lead and supporting, turn in excellent performances. Their characters grow as the story evolves and they are shaped by their experiences. Summer Glau deserves special notice as the inanimate machine  that in her portrayal of a human absorbs some traces of humanity whether intended or not. Her subtle presentation of this process is wonderful to watch. It could have been easily overplayed but instead Ms. Glau has struck the perfect balance.

The special effects and the action sequences are excellent and tension filled. But, there is so much more to this series than explosions. There are wonderful interactions between cast members. There is comic relief in  black humor. There are deeper sociological and psychological aspects of the relationship between John and Cameron who enjoy an obvious bond that neither of them can understand, as Artificial Intelligence bonds to humanity and vice versa.

As good as the TV series was, it is even better when you can view the episodes without interruption and continue them at will. I will probably watch each episode 100 times before I can see and enjoy everything that is there to appreciate in this gem of a series.

It is very unfortunate that this show was not renewed.  Cancellation will  result in this unique assemblage of talent to scatter to other endeavors.  and that will result in the destruction of something beautiful and unique.

I anxiously await the release of Season 2 and will surely order it.",1246838400,,2959,4.9837067209775965

2895986,5,B000T9OP7G,"I was very skeptical about this show when I first heard about it, being a huge fan of the first two movies. I watched part of the pilot when it aired but it didn't grab me. Then after about a year and a half later, I decided to give it another chance.

For the first three episodes I was entertained, but not very impressed. However, during these episodes there were hints that the show had a lot of potential. And starting at the fourth episode the show just took off. It only took a few more episodes for me to decide that this was the best show I've ever seen. The writing is fantastic, the storylines take brilliant twists and turns, and the acting is pitch perfect.

This is not just an action dominated show like I predicted. It is a compelling and complex show that you can't sit through casually. It assumes that its audience is intelligent and prefers extremely well-drawn characters rather than gimmicks and predictable writing.

I would highly suggest this DVD set as well as the second season, which comes out in a few months. The second season takes everything further and will really blow your mind.",1244764800,2,1113,4.527363184079602

The show is canceled (as of now) at the end of season two probably because it is a little too complicated for the average viewer (my opinion). With out spoiling it, I will say that the last few episodes of season two (I know this is a season one review)are great and provide some closure to story lines. So DON""T feel like you should not start watching the series just because you will be left hanging (though it is not all wrapped up with a bow, they wanted to come back and had to have us wanting more).

2895989,4,B000T9OP7G,"The first (pilot) episode is kinda rough; they time travel, and almost jump the shark, but the show gets better from there.
  Summer Glau does a great job as the terminator Cameron. She does the whole detached from reality thing pretty d*** well. Strange roles seem to work out for her. Because she's a terminator, Summer's character has no social skills to speak of (she can mimic people, but doesn't know the meanings of the actions she's mimicking), which leads to some pretty funny moments, especially when she goes to school (to protect John and to make her seem like a normal teenage girl).
  Lena Headey makes a believable Sara Connor. Her acting never really wavers, and she shows her characters internal conflict pretty well. She doesn't have the intensity of Linda Hamilton (the original Sara Connor from Terminator 1 and 2), but her character is not going full blast all the time, so it works out in the end.
  Thomas Dekker also makes a believable John Connor. While everyone's character goes through emotional conflict (minor exception for Summer Glau/Cameron; it makes more sense the more you watch it), John Connor gets the worst of it. He does a good job showing the stress he's under from being the savior of mankind, being hunted by terminators, and even school events (a girl commits suicide, and John could have saved her).
  The special effects are both good and bad. You can see the work that went into making the CGI models, but it's painfully obvious that it's CG; when there is a shot of a terminator with no human skin, you know they green screened it in. Aside from that, the special effects are more than solid. The action scenes are basic, but well done and well thought out.
  The plot, from episode to episode as well as from beginning of the episode to the end, flows very well. It's not the kind of show you can watch a few episodes of here and there; each builds upon the last, so you have to pay attention, although you don't have to take detailed notes to understand what's happening.
  Ultimately, this is a very good show that Fox shouldn't have canceled (just like Firefly). If you're a Terminator fan and don't mind this being non-canonical (it's ultimately a giant, well written fan fic), I highly recommend it. If you're looking for a good TV show to get into, this is the show you want to watch.",1243641600,2,2338,4.620772946859903

There is too many great things to say about this show so I'm going to keep it simple.  Lena Headey (Sarah Connor) really surprised me of how she portrayed Sarah and made the role her own. She brought so much to the role and now I'm a loss for words.  Thomas Dekker (John Connor), again he brought so much to John and he really made me feel for what John was going through.  I was more drawn to the show because of the relationship between Mother and Son, which I thought was beautifully well portrayed by both Headey and Dekker. Summer Glau (Cameron) also gave an exceptional performance as the good Terminator sent back through time to protect John from being assassinated by Skynet.

With word that Fox dropped the ball on not renewing TSCC for a third season is beyond me.  At least the fans of TSCC got two great seasons out of it.",1242604800,,1197,4.3125
2895993,5,B000T9OP7G,"Boy, am I embarrassed.  I originally only watched the first half of the pilot and a little of the later season one episodes before I panned this show as ""Robo210"".  Cough...cough.  I was horribly unfair.  This thing's got depth, nuance, smarts, and a big helping of heart & soul.  I watched every episode of Season 2 as it was airing, and must say I'm floored.

In about 30 hours, Fox Television Network will officially announce whether Terminator - The Sarah Connor Chronicles gets picked up for a third season.  After having purchased the first season and being utterly consumed by it now, all I can say is Fox executives will need their heads examined if they cancel this.

I've got one friend working on Dollhouse.  I have another who worked on the first few episodes of Glee.  I'd gladly trade a hundred Dollhouses, Glees, and Prison Breaks for at least one more season of Terminator.  There's certainly precedent for Fox doing stupid things, though.  Hell, they canceled Family Guy early on, even though you had to be lobotomized to not realize it was genius.

I'd thought Fox had learned the error of their ways.  After all, they did finally bring Family Guy back, then rewarded the writers with a spin off at least as good: American Dad.  It's not as if this is Twin Peaks, you know, with the murder solved and the plot getting meandering.  I think ABC's cancelation of that show actually caused the last few episodes to finally go somewhere.

Terminator has huge oodles of potential left.  I get the sense the writers have more to say.  The characters are just heading up their arcs.  The show feels like something great right in its infancy.  It's a shame they moved it to Friday night in an effort to prop up Dollhouse's ratings, but it's done.  It still doesn't change the fact its DVR ratings were through the roof even in no-man's land.",1242518400,,1850,4.627692307692308

I've seen all the new FOX shows lately, I watched and enjoyed Fringe, I watched and enjoyed Lie to Me, and I watched and enjoyed Dollhouse, all are new shows, and trust me, TSCC is the best out of all of them.

2895997,5,B000T9OP7G,"Season 1 really drew me in from the first episode, a love at first sight kind of scenario.  This is by far the best series I've seen in a while.  The complex relationships between man and machine, and even mother and son are tested throughout each outing.  To add to that, the chemistry of Summer Glau and Thomas Dekker is mesmerizing, and is probably enough to get any teenager interested.  However, their relationship digs much deeper than the average boy meets girl scenario... Any fan of action, drama, and science fiction will easily be fascinated by what this show has to offer.  More than just a ploy to get some cash from the Terminator name, the series stretches well beyond the boundaries of the films.  Tapping into deep philosophies in unison with beautiful action sequences...the show mirrors great films like The Matrix while respectfully keeping to a Terminator based storyline. The series does not serve as a continuation of the films, rather an extension on a different pathway. This frees up the writing and allows creativity to flow. Despite only having nine episodes, this season makes up for it by putting incredible quality into each episode.  The special features are awesome as well, seeing how much work and care was put in really made me appreciate the episodes even more...and seeing the cast and crew sharing their experiences was very entertaining as well. As far as accessibility is concerned, my mom isn't an action fan or a science fiction fan and she watched 6 episodes straight last night...my sister has taken interest as well after seeing how captivated it has me :)  Need anymore convincing?

2896004,5,B000T9OP7G,"For awhile, I was very skeptical about the Sarah Connor Chronicles, because I saw the trailers for the show, and pictures of the actors playing the characters, and I just thought ""I don't see how this is going to work...""
Also, I'm not usually one to go for a movie or tv show based on a previous work, that doesn't have the original actors reprising their roles. (Mortal Kombat Annihilation....ugh).

This is the first one I have seen, where I was pulled into the storyline from the first episode. It starts off a bit slow to grasp, but then as you continue watching it, and also keeping in mind that the events of T2 altered the future(changing when Judgment Day occurs), everything just makes more and more sense as the season continues.

Probably the main perk I can grasp here, is the actors/actress's performances. The guy playing John Connor is 10x better and much more believable than who was picked to do so in T3. What was really cool, was that though the original cast wasn't present, the lines and actions done are totally fitting to the characters. The writers didn't take them way out into left field, changing the characters' mannerisms and whatnot, if that makes sense. And I was extremely skeptical about having a female terminator being a protector, especially being so close to John's age, appearance-wise. But Summer pulls it off quite well, and by the end of the season, I had completely forgotten about skepticism.

All in all, especially for less than 20 bucks, it's a very good buy. I'm anxious for the 2nd season to come out on DVD.

Buy this DVD because it is 6.58 hours of pure awesome for only $19. Sure it doesn't have the budget that Terminator 2 had, but it is just as amazing. As a kid we love action, but as we get older, we are more interested in suspense. This movie does have action as well, but it's focus on storyline is refreshing for television.

Such mysterious storylines got us hooked to movies like Matrix, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, and TV series like X-Files. If you've ever liked any of those movies for the storyline, you'll love TSCC.",1237852800,2,858,4.564935064935065
2896007,4,B000T9OP7G,"Have TV shows left behind episodic TV to take on the trappings of the novel? TV is now full of shows that have a vision of the series as a whole with a beginning, middle and end fully plotted before they even hit the screen. Shows like Lost, Hero's, Mad Men, and The Sarah Connor Chronicles have changed how we look at TV shows, and maybe the way we should think about them as well.

I have to admit that when the first season of The Sarah Connor Chronicles went on I was excited, being as I'm a fan of The Terminator movies but as I watched the first couple of episodes I lost interest. Then I applied for a job as book reviewer for an ezine and they also wanted the book reviewer to review a science fiction TV series as well, so I picked The Sarah Connor Chronicles. I didn't get the gig reviewing books for that particular ezine but I watched the entire first season in one or two sittings and was able to view it as  a whole and saw the emerging themes and directions the creators of the show were trying to take, and I got excited about the possibilities they were exploring.

The Sarah Connor Chronicles picks up after the second Terminator movie. Sarah and John have settled down a bit, Sarah in love and living with a paramedic in Colorado, but they're still doing their best to stay off the grid and not attract attention to themselves. A Terminator shows up at John's school one day as a substitute teacher with a gun implanted in his thigh. When he opens fire and chaos ensues John is saved by Cameron, the cute new girl sitting next to him in class, who seems to be able to take a bullet pretty well. John escapes to the parking lot with the teacher terminator hot on his trail and just as John is cornered Cameron comes out of nowhere with a truck and runs down the terminator, and reveals herself to be a terminator sent by the future John Connor to save his teenage self. John and Cameron find Sarah but the police and the not quite terminated terminator are in hot pursuit of the three of them. Cameron leads them to a bank vault a seeming dead end, but the future John Connor has been planning ahead (or is it behind?) and he's been sending emissaries back in time to set up an infrastructure to protect himself in the past. Cameron rips open safety deposit boxes and starts assembling a device, a time machine, Cameron is going to hide John and Sarah in the future!

After the escape to the future John convinces Sarah and Cameron that they can do more than wait for judgment day that they can again go after Skynet and destroy it before it can be built. They also discover that the terminator after John at the school got caught in the time vortex they went through so he's still after them, although he's a bit beat up and needs to reconstitute himself. Another antagonist FBI agent James Ellison is introduced, a police detective who believes Sarah Connor killed some police officers, and this addition has kind of The Fugitive feel to it and never really develops anything passed that.

Sarah soon discovers a computer prototype called The Turk that could become Skynet and built by a computer geek Andy Good, but she is able to torch it and unfortunately Andy's dreams. But John Connor isn't the only one salting away things in the past to change the future, Skynet is also stashing things such as a type of steel to build terminators. Sarah discovers that Andy has rebuilt The Turk and she runs off to destroy it (again) but finds she's too late that The Turk has been stolen and Andy Good has been killed by Derek Reese, the brother of Kyle who came back in the first Terminator movie to save her. Derek joins Sarah and John but is distrustful of Cameron and her motives because she is terminator but also because he knew her in the future and isn't convinced she doesn't have a hidden agenda, and some of her actions might indicate she has something to hide, Derek and Sarah discover that Cameron has kept a chip from a terminator but is she keeping it for Skynet's agenda? Or does she have a secret mission from the future John Connor?

In one of the more interesting episodes Bruce Davison plays another of his characters bordering on insanity. He's the psychiatrist at the mental institution Sarah escaped from in the second movie and he's stolen a hand from a terminator and Sarah is in a race to retrieve it before FBI agent Ellison does. In the penultimate episode of the season the doubts about Cameron finally come to the surface when it is discovered she saved the chip she was supposed to destroy. Cameron's motivations and actions increasingly are under scrutiny by Sarah. In the final episode Sarah and gang are offered the chance to buy the Turk for half a million dollars, and Sarah's love interest returns, and in the cliffhanging last scene Cameron is blown up by a truck bomb.

I hadn't heard of most of the cast before The Sarah Connor Chronicles but in researching this review I found that most of them have pretty solid television credibility having appeared on Hero's, Firefly, and The 300, all pretty solid shows with reputations for smart episodes, so it seems the cast was picked well. The acting is uniformly good it doesn't delve into kitsch or melodramatics and the possibility always exists for those roads to be taken. Brian Austin Green who started his career in the great Spelling schmaltz factory of 90210 had me worried when he came into the show in the third or fourth episode as Derek Reese but he has consistently shown that he has the capabilities of good acting and has even carried the dramatics in a couple of the episodes.

Allusion and metaphor aren`t found in a lot of TV shows, in a smartly written show you can find one or the other but not usually both. In the Sarah Conner Chronicles chess is used as a metaphor, and yes, I know chess is an overused metaphor in a lot of things but they didn't belabor the point and it worked in the context of the episode. The themes that are explored in The Sarah Conner Chronicles are more ambitious than in the Terminator movies. The show explores do the terminators cause people to act more machine like? Can machines learn to love man enough to need them? Can man love (come to terms with) his need for machines?

Each of the three DVD's have bonus features that are quite a fun enhancement to the set. I enjoyed the actor audition video's especially Lena Headey's. She's an English actress and she effects an American accent quite well and believably but as soon as she drops out of character her English accent is noticeable and almost undecipherable!

I think anyone who liked The Terminator movies and wants to explore that world a little deeper will certainly enjoy this series, as well as someone not all that knowledgeable about The Terminator world.",1237680000,4,6770,4.505700325732899

2896015,5,B000T9OP7G,"What is there to say other than Terminator: TSCC is TOTALLY FREAKING AWESOME!!!!! I love that it provides a different perspective and timeline for fans of the movies. What I like best is the change in the timeline because I loved the first two movies but was extremely disappointed with T3: Rise of The Machines. Fox has created an excellent show and I pray they don't cancel this show too. Summer Glau is an amazing actress and Fox has already dumped her once when they cancelled Firefly... Another TOTALLY FREAKING AWESOME SHOW!!!!! Too bad Fox didn't realize how badly they screwed up cancelling Firefly, hopefully they can fix that by continuing to produce great episodes of The Sarah Connor Chronicles.

As I said, Summer Glau is an amazing actress. I highly enjoyed her in the show Firefly co-starring Nathan Fillion, who by the way hasn't had too great of a track record with Fox since they cancelled his new show Drive in 2007. That show was TOTALLY FREAKING AWESOME too!!!!! Fox... They just don't know when they have a good thing. But anyway, she is also awesome in the movie counterpart to Firefly, Serenity.

Lena Headey... I admit the only movie I've seen her in is the movie 300. A movie I deeply enjoyed. And she carries that same strong performance she gave from 300 to the set of The Sarah Connor Chronicles.

I haven't seen much of Thomas Dekker other then the little bit of Heroes I've seen. But from just that bit I can tell he's gonna be one hell of an actor.

Brian Austin Green, damn. I haven't seen him since he was in Kickboxer 2 back in 1991. Still, he's a good actor and he fits the role of Derek Reese. My favorite scene from The Sarah Connor Chronicles has to be in the last episode of season one, when Derek takes John out for ice cream for his brithday and shows him a young Derek and Kyle Reese playing baseball in the park.

2896019,5,B000T9OP7G,"I had my skepticism about the show from the previews and commercials. My biggest worry was they would overuse TV-budget CG-effects for the Terminators, and thankfully that has not happened. In fact, the show has far less action sequences than the movies. I think the whole first season has less gunfire than T2. But what it lacks in summer-movie action it more than makes up for with great story, interesting characters, and an amazing premise.

If you only buy one show on Blu-ray, get this show. Because of the writers strike, season 1 has been cut down to only 9 episodes, but they are all memorable. This show deserves to be in glorious 1080p, and it shows. The Terminators actually appear very well rendered in HD and not overly fake. The sound is absolutely stunning on the Blu-ray as well, and if you're a fan of the music in the show like me, you'll appreciate the audio track.

No spoilers here, but I've found the continuity-inconsistencies to be minor and the story in each episode to be deeper than a lot of the other shows out there now. Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles does not need to rely on outrageous plot twists or shockingly unexpected gimmicks to captivate the audience, but it is far from predictable. I love the music from this show too, it's not too varied but the main theme sticks in your head in a good way.

Summer Glau's performance as Cameron is at times humorous and haunting. Lena Headey portrays Sarah in more of a motherly guardian figure for her son than the Sarah from the movies. It's like she really believes he will save mankind whereas in the movie she seemed more concerned with just keeping him alive because she had to. And Thomas Dekker makes for a great John. It's clear he just wants to be a normal teen at times, but it also shows he understands how serious the situation is. I honestly will admit that I see more of the strategist/military leader in him in the second season, though they've done less to really make me buy into how much of a computer genius he is or that he's capable of reprogramming Terminators. I suppose it's been established from T2 that he's something of a hacker, but the kid barely goes to school and seems a bit more angst-ridden this season.

Here's hoping that this show goes on for many more seasons. It was a close tie between The Sarah Connor Chronicles and House MD for me, but this show really took the spot as my favorite show of 2008.",1232928000,3,2425,4.529680365296803

Since I like this show so much and just got a PS3 I figured this would make a good purchase to watch in Blu Ray.  The show is so well written, directed, and acted.  There is quite a bit of action and I can't wait to watch it now in HD, I bet it makes a big difference.  I can tell you for a fact that Blu Ray is great, picture quality and sound far surpass normal standard defination and I can see how the Blu Ray beat HDDVD because the Blu Ray can hold so much more information on it then the HDDVD and I do have both format systems.

2896027,5,B000T9OP7G,"I'll have to admit that I was not looking forward to this show when it was announced.  The idea of taking James Cameron's classic characters and doing, what I assumed would be, a low budget weekly show sounded like instant entertainment death.  However, this is a well written, well acted show that has added great depth and complexity to both Sarah Connor and her son in a way that there just wasn't time for in the two Cameron films.  Also, Skynet is fleshed out in a way that the films never could, or at least never did.  The more it plays with the timeline, the stranger things get.  At this point no one is even sure which side they're on, not even the terminators.
  The Blu-ray image is full 1080p and the sound is crisp and clear.  Since I watched all of these originally on Hulu.com it was quite a step up.  There are some interesting extras including Summer Glau practicing ballet and some fun outtakes.

I see it like this: This is probably one of the coolest stories ever written and the more we see of it, the better it gets. This is just a thought but in order for the idea to work, that is, the idea that John Connor will save hummanity, he would have to be really tough and understand not only how terminators think, but how they work, where they operate, and most importantly when they will strike.

You might end up wondering how the timeline in this show can exist considering the story of T3, but if you consider that this was Skynet's fourth attempt at killing John Connor AFTER the TX failed then it would create a tangent timeline in which the events of T3 would never happen.

The show doesn't even attempt to explain this to us, however. I hate exposition as much as the next viewer, but TSCC has no sense of time, character or importance of event. Nothing is clearly presented to the audience and it's hard to keep with the barely interesting story. It's bad writing, plain and simple. And the constant in-jokes (a robot called Cameron, a character called William Wisher) are another sign of lazy writing which leads me to believe that the show is written by fanboys instead of qualified writers. Even this I could turn a blind eye to if they stayed true to the original story, but they tamper with too much of James Cameron's history. For example; Kyle Reese says he grew up after the nuclear war in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Terminator-Blu-ray/dp/B000F9RB9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Terminator [Blu-ray</a>], but here we see him and his previously unmentioned brother playing baseball on Judgment Day (now moved to 2011). And why didn't Skynet send back another T1000 instead of the old T800? It's not model 101 this time since Arnie wouldn't embarrass himself with trash like this, but it would have made sense to send a mimetic poly-alloy instead of the metal endo-skeleton surrounded by living tissue.

However, doing it that way might have ended the show on day one, and the folks at the WB need to s-t-r-e-t-c-h this junk out as far as possible.

Lena Headey is visually similar to Linda Hamilton, but I never liked the direction they took the character in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terminator-2-Judgment-Day-Blu-ray/dp/B000EWBKKI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terminator 2: Judgment Day [Blu-ray</a>], where she becomes hardcore warrior (almost a human terminator herself) who narrates every scene with a pointless and pretentious voice-over. There's very little to like about her in this show, mostly because she never displays any kind of affection for anyone around her, even her son.

Summer Glau is the only reason for watching this. Any scene that does not feature her threatens to kill the series dead on the spot. Some of this stuff is really painful, especially the Dr. Silberman plot. Not only is it incredibly disrespectful to what James Cameron had created, but they didn't even get Earl Boen back. Instead they got someone who looks and acts nothing like him. It feels like a totally different person and you can tell that he's only in there to stretch the lumbering story out further. Even composer Bear McReary seems frightened of using Brad Fiedel's iconic Terminator theme (and, let's be honest, it was the only noteworthy theme in Feidel's lackluster career). The score for the show is instead made up of noises and sound effects with the slightest of themes repeated in each episode with no variation. Plus, the existence of the Terminators after the destruction of Cyberdyne is still not clearly explained either.

I know a lot of shows struggle during their first season, maybe this is why the network gave TSCC the benefit of the doubt and ordered a full second season. But this nine episode Blu Ray is only worth the money if your a serious fan, and even then you're likely to be disappointed.

The Blu Ray features a 1.78:1 1080p picture that doesn't impress a helluva lot and an adequate sound design with lots of extras I couldn't care less about.",1226102400,5,3983,5.395498392282958
2896037,5,B000T9OP7G,"Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles has all of the things you would expect from an action show:  things blow up, people get shot, cyborgs tear apart sets and wreck havoc on each other in satisfyingly flashy and violent ways.  But what I wasn't expecting was how multi-layered the plots become.  Common themes explored are the journey from boy to leader of mankind, Biblical stories, references to The Wizard of Oz, (particularly the Tim Man as Cameron, in search of a heart), and the idea that the humans must become as ruthless and unsentimental as the machines to survive, while the machines must become more human in order to hunt them.

Moments of sublime beauty (Summer Glau doing ballet) are in stark contrast with cruelty, despair and dysfunction.  While it might start a little slow, when the show gets to Dungeons and Dragons it kicks it into high gear and never lets up. This is the rarest kind of tv show: the smart action show.",1226016000,,943,4.725609756097561
2896038,3,B000T9OP7G,"This show was both good and disappointing.  It started off great with the first few episodes as they were filled with action, we were really getting to know the characters, and the show was breaking off from the whole ""chase"" procedures established with the previous movies.  The season began to become boring and tiresome in the middle as it focused more on emotional issues instead of being action driven.  The emotional conflicts that were brought up when Derek Reese (another character from the future) travels back in are just boring.  The only exciting parts dealing with Reese are the glimpses of the future, other than that everything that surrounds his character is dull.

Things didn't being to pick up until the final 3 episodes.  This is not the worst show that Fox has spewed out but it isn't the best.  I do recommend picking up the first season on Blu-ray as Amazon's price is really great (they are charging less than what Stores like Best Buy charge for the DVD version).  The show also looks good on Blu-ray, it is not perfect but it does look better than the HD broadcast.  There are some minor flaws here and there that are normally associated with digitally shooting TV shows in HD.  TV shows often experience rushed productions and they are unable to go back and re-shoot scenes that don't out looking their best.

I gave this release 3 out of 5 stars as the show's quality starts off good, dips in the middle, and begins to rise back up near the end.  The video quality has some flaws but it looks great overall.",1225584000,3,1535,4.602941176470588

The cast is what truly makes the series, as Lena Headley (Sarah), Thomas Dekker (John) and Richard T. Jones (FBI agent James Ellison) are perfect for their key roles. Summer Glau (cyborg protector) and Garret Dillahunt (T-888 hunter) have characters that push the action forward, but do not overshadow the human aspects of the story.

Every episode feels like an entire movie. The special effects are stunning, the actors do their jobs very well and the story keeps you watching and wanting more of ""The Sarah Connor Chronicles"".

The 3 disc blu-ray set includes outtakes, commentaries, deleted scenes and a 10 minute longer version of one of the last episodes from season 1. I keep enjoying the satisfying feeling of buying this blu-ray set for an incredible price at amazon.com .

2896062,5,B000T9OP7G,"This show is excellent. Many of us, I'm sure, were hesitant to see an Arnold-less Terminator TV show, with a new actress filling the shoes of the iconic Sarah Connor, after being immortalized by Linda Hamilton. Well, as both a long time Terminator fan, and someone who is very picky about which TV shows they watch, I can safely say that this show delivers the goods in ways I couldn't have imagined.

The cast for this show is excellent. The producers wisely opted not to simply cast Sarah Connor based on how well the actress resembled Hamilton, but by how well she portrayed the character. Lena Headey is friggin' close to perfect for the role, and that was something that I was not expecting at all when I first found out they were making the show. Thomas Dekker as John Connor bears a stronger resemblance to his Terminator 2 counterpart, but more importantly he fills the role very well. Given that the Connors are the only Terminator 2 veterans who appear regularly in the series, it was fundamental to the show's success that they cast them properly, and thankfully they did.

The real show stealer though, is Summer Glau as the new character ""Cameron."" She's John's new cyborg protector from the future, and it's no surprise that she is rapidly becoming a fan favorite. The role of Cameron is much more complicated than simply an emotionless robot, because she's more than a regular Terminator, as the series slowly reveals. She's a machine that is slowly becoming more human-like, and Summer Glau is the perfect actress to convey both aspects of Cameron's personality. She's definitely one of my favorite aspects of the show, and I can't wait to see how she develops in future episodes.

The writing in the show is well done too. There are a few continuity errors in some episodes that you may or may not pick up on depending on how closely you pay attention, but those aren't really what's important. What is important is that the story actually makes you care about the characters, and eager to find out what happens next. Sometimes I would literally throw things at my TV when a commercial break started just because I was so hooked. They did an excellent job selling that these are the same John and Sarah Connor from Terminator 2, but the writers now have the opportunity to expand their characters a lot further than was possible in a 2.5 hour long movie.

If you are a Terminator fan, you owe it to youself to buy this set. The visual quality for the Blue-Ray is amazing, and it even comes with a slightly extended cut of the pilot, and a greatly extended cut of one of the later episodes that sheds even more light on Sarah Connor's character.

The blu ray edition is really good (DD 5.1, no TrueHD though), some extras in HDef, others in Low Def, but definitely a Blu ray you need to have ...",1221868800,,581,4.263636363636364

I never thought I would enjoy watching the kid from 90210, but he's an excellent Derek Reese.  Lena Headey does a great job as well, but I think the paramedic's wife looks more like Linda Hamilton and may have been a better choice as Sarah Connor.

The show stays faithful to the plot and story line of T1 and T2 (the events of T3 have not happened yet), and it will be interesting to see if some of these characters will be in or referenced in T4.

As far as the quality of the blu-ray, it is equal or better than the HD version on TV.  It's not reference quality, but it is an excellent presentation.

It is a fast-paced storyline about Sara Connor as she tries to escape from the terminators coming from the future to eradicate her and her son.

In some like T2, the camera slows down some, music begins, the Terminator comes out, and Sarah is terrified. To me, that's well done. In the series, it's just boring old fights, nothing too exciting to see. Not blaming the show, but it seems like a lot of newer shows and movies has this ""fast pace"" action or something that it looks sped up, and not at normal speed. I hate that. Plus, why SO close to the action? It's too close to enjoy it. This is part of the reason there is ""widescreen"", to ENJOY more of the film, the action, the drama, anything. and now you have too many CLOSE fast shots of action, it's silly and dumb. I'm not really going to blame this show because of it, being I see it in other places too. Maybe it's the new ""action"" view or something.

2896078,5,B000T9OP7G,"When I heard about this show, I was both excited and angry.  I always thought the Terminator COULD make a decent television show, but i don't trust Fox.  They tend to create great shows and then cancel them before they can find their audience.  They canceled Firefly, Dark Angel, Point Pleasant, Space Above and Beyond, and Drive (an amazingly addictive show that they didn't let reach the fourth episode).  They even tried to cancel Family Guy.

I knew it would be a decent show, but i was afraid to invest myself in anything remotely related to Fox and have it taken away AGAIN.  I'm still worried (Dark Angel was given a Second Season), but I'm glad I gave it a chance.

This show does everything right. I'd heard it was taking place after T2 and before Judgement Day.  So i was afraid they'd write themselves into a corner with the set future of the rather awful T3.  A quick time travel jump in the first episode immediately erases T3 from the Timeline.  ""There is no fate but what we make.""

The whole cast is about as good as Television can get.  Summer Glau is especially amazing as John Conner's new protector.  But it is when Kyle Reese's brother is introduced that the show really takes off.  Yes Brian Austin Greene is a strange choice for the part, but he really pulls it off.

We see how a terminator goes about regenerating it's living tissue when it has been overly damaged.  We see more of the future (including a couple of the rubber skinned terminator models mentioned in the original film).  We meet some of Sarah Conner's gun running connections from before her time in the institution. And we see plenty of Terminator on Terminator violence.  What a great show.",1220745600,10,1683,4.5719063545150505
2896079,5,B000T9OP7G,"I remember from before any episodes were aired, this series was getting a lot of negative buzz for whatever reason.
Most people who would consider watching this have already seen the terminator movies, as did any sci-fi or action fan. This series is similar in tone to the cult-favorite second movie although it is a better drama overall.

There are a couple of things that make it the series to watch.

Acting. Relative unknowns have been cast in main roles. I'd say the girl playing Sarah Connor is OK, the girl playing Cameron (the terminator) is good... and that's the worse end of the stick. Guys take the cake on this one. Young J.Connor, Agent Alison, and Derek Reese, Cromartie are played amazingly.

I like the music in the show, too. Most of it is a derivative of the main theme in the movies, although not as blunt. Lyrical melody is mixed with synthetic drum beats to great effect, IMO. I simply love the piece playing at main menus on DVD. It puts you in a right mood for watching this tale.

There are several main story arcs, and a couple of secondary arcs throughout the first season. There are no stand-alone episodes. Lastly, the episodes (and maybe the writing) get better the farther you are in the season. The last episode was probably the best example of the potential and of what there is to come in later seasons.",1220659200,7,1337,4.558333333333334

SO many police and lawyer procedural shows are now on, I look forward to the escapism this show provides.  No bad dreams.  Lena Headey is fantastic, as is, well all four of the major players are excellent.

I thought the movie series showed that time travel was extremely difficult. But in this storyline it's easy. At the end of the first episode they even use time travel to escape. Not as difficult as we were led to believe in the movies. Cheapens the whole Terminator universe with this introduced.",1220313600,,690,4.617886178861789
2896083,4,B000T9OP7G,"This is a superbly-directly, excellently-produced program. Movie quality throughout... I was amazed at the quality and creativity of the show, which shows its high budget.

Lena Headey and Summer Glau are superb as thinking man's cheesecake, and not in a way that should turn women off from the show, even as it should drag men in. They bring genuine depth to their roles, in a way that's exceptionally rare in television. Even the supporting actors and actresses are well-cast and fleshed-out, balancing sci-fi action/danger with humanity and irony. It's hard to imagine the show without Summer Glau's elusive ""humanity"".

All that said, the mastering on the Blu-Ray collection is odd. The menus don't really work right, in the sense that you put a disk in, and it simply starts playing all 3-4 episodes from the beginning as if they're one big 3-hour thing. Yes, you can, if you try, find the top menu to select the individual episodes, but it's as if the folks creating the menus didn't understand the whole concept of separate episodes. The episodes are more like chapter stops.

The menus aren't really a problem.. as other reviewers have mentioned, the high-def picture is very good.. but you'll notice it. I don't really know what kind of person would resist buying a DVD collection because the episodes are somewhat difficult to navigate, but if that's you, you might want to think twice.",1219968000,3,1396,4.931914893617021
2896084,5,B000T9OP7G,"To be honest, I have no clue what people can be complaining about with this series.  IF you like Terminator, you should like this.  There's no way Arnold S. and Linda H. were going to sign on for a TV series, so we get their capable replacements instead.

The timeline of this series is obviously after the second of the three Terminator movies.  In the second, the viewer is essentially left with all Terminator entities being destroyed, and Sarah Connor protecting her 10-year old son while preparing him for his destiny. Leaving Cyberdyne Systems in ruins, they enlist the help of Miles Dyson to destroy his own research that would eventually lead to Skynet and Judgement Day.

In the Sarah Connor Chronicles, Sarah (Lena Heady) and her teenage son John (Thomas Dekker) are fugitive nomads, moving from one remote town to another in order to stay under the radar, not only from the possibility of other Terminators, but also law enforcement.  However, that's not enough, and eventually a new Terminator model named Cameron (Summer Glau) meets up with the mother and son.  Luckily, Cameron is a newer T800 model - obviously prettier than all previous Terminators - sent by John to protect John.

Wonderfully cast, with great special effects and acting, the story and drama follows the original storyline smoothly.  Since insiders have noted that this series is in a different timeline than T3, the story-arc can be eliminated for confused linear thinkers.

It's very easy to become immersed in the plot for this series, and I'm already hooked.  There are years and years between John's childhood and his ascension to ""Leader of Mankind"", and the only thing in between this series and greatness is a lack of imagination.  The questions left by the first two movies (and even the blank spot between the second and third on that timeline) will be slowly answered, and John's formative years will vividly display how he learns to fulfill his destiny and become the wise, revolutionary leader of all future humankind.

Man, was I wrong.
Of course there are Terminators all over the place and they are constantly being destroyed and get back up and what not again and again but that's what the story is about.

In short, for those who don't know: Sarah and her son want to destroy the computer network Skynet to avoid a future Armageddon. They get help from a sexy fem-bot: Cameron Phillips.
The trio is being chased by the FBI who doesn't know that the Connors are the good guys and by the machines whose existence is at stake.

It's fun to watch (if you keep in mind that most of the shot people are in fact robots...)
Lena Headey does a terrific job as Sarah. She is convincing as a caring mother, but she also manages the action very well and even looks convincing when others think she's insane. (Sorry fans, but I didn't think Linda Hamilton ever pulled that off. She looked insane all right but for the rest ...)
Summer Glau as the protective Terminator is funny. The way she moves and reacts to emotional (and other) outbreaks always make me laugh.
Some SciFi critics think Thomas Dekker too old for his role as John but I never had a problem with that. He is a terrific actor in his own right (as he already showed us in Heroes) and fits perfectly in the story.
Richard T. Jones is very good as the FBI agent who senses there is much more behind all this.

If you don't take this all too seriously (who does?) you're in for a ride.
Of course I would have wanted more episodes in this season but because of the writers strike there are none. Well, less is more. Better this way than having a few more but written by amateurs.
Blu-ray is state of the art. Also the extras are nice to watch. Of course there's a making of with interviews of the producers and writers etc. but what I really liked were the audition tapes of all the leading actors and the dance practice of Summer Glau.",1219881600,21,2097,4.277078085642318

The Sarah Connor Chronicles

Awesome, awesome, awesome, a DVD must for every good Sci-Fi home movie library. Sarah's Chronicles offer something old, something new and the missing links to thread the both together. Great sets, CGI and extraordinary acting, this first season is jam packed with intense riveting footage so believable it will quickly pull you in and capture you. Trained ballerina turned actress Summer Glau is powerful as Cameron, a female cyborg sent from the future to protect a computer prodigy from the evil intent of ""Skynet.""

 I was first memorized by Glau's acting skills in Josh Whedon's ""Firefly"" series. Her offbeat character in ""Firefly"" makes Summer Glau the perfect cyborg choice to protect young John Connor who is destined to fight machines who will take over the world in the future.

A writers strike during the first season left only 9 episodes in the can but well worth the DVD purchase. If season two is anything like the first, hold on to your hats for an edge of you seat ride.

I again need to recommend a close watch of Summer Glau's gifted acting talents. Anyone who has seen a ballet knows a story unfolds through movement and expression. Danced trained in expression and movement since a child, Glau is a leg up over the acting skills of most actresses.

Great special bonus features in and on the Blu-Ray DVD's will provide hours of cyborg food for the hungry who just can't get enough of The Sarah Connor Chronicles. Couch Potato Review: 7 Potato More.",1219622400,,1508,4.825581395348837

However, upon a second viewing on Blu-Ray, the show seemed to get even better.  Thomas Dekker takes over the reigns as John Connor, and Lena Headey replaces Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor.  Both do well.  Summer Glau is a real treat as Cameron Phillips.  Upon first viewing, I thought that the writers had really screwed up writing Cameron, regressing her ability to act human quite a bit after the pilot episode.  It didn't feel that way the second time through, so maybe this series gains some momentum on Blu-Ray that makes the inconsistencies less noticeable.

Blu-Ray is where this series belongs.  The picture quality is quite good, and the sound is amazing.  The extras here are quite nice - there are quite a few deleted scenes, some commentaries, auditions, and a few others.

Casting is wonderful.  While Summer Glau clearly deserves acclaim for her portrayal of a character which bridges the human/machine divide, performers playing the other main (and even secondary) characters have certainly also delivered.

4)Solid plot/subplot story telling

Cons:
1)The DVD ""extras"" were nothing special
2)Some of the technology and events (very early on) required significant ""suspension of disbelief"". No spoilers from me, but this was required to move a plot device along and was not repeated.

2896098,4,B000T9OP7G,"The first season of ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"" surprised me; I expected the show to piggy back on the movies, be short lived and not be very good. Luckily, I was completely wrong on all counts. ""Chronicles"" manages to be engaging, expand on the first three films and be terrifically entertaining. Show developer Josh Friedman (""War of the Worlds"") establishes an identity for the show. The pilot isn't the strongest episode but sets up the story arc for the rest of the series which was what it was intended to do. The good news is that the show improves and becomes VERY good as it goes along.

The image quality for the transfer of the Blu-ray looks very good although it isn't perfect. Flesh tones look accurate,with nice, rich blacks. Image clarity and detail is extremely good although edge enhancement crops up on a couple of episodes. Audio sounds quite good with a nice dramatic score and a nice surround mix.

Following Sarah Connor(Lena Heady), her son John (Thomas Dekker) and Cameron (Summer Glau) a cyborg sent from the future to protect them the series focuses on their attempts to prevent Skynet from being built. They're also being pursued by a variety of Terminators sent into the past to eliminate them.

The set comes with deleted scenes and a number of commentary tracks featuring Friedman, actors Thomas Dekker, Brian Austin Green, Lena Heady Summer Glau and others. The commentary tracks are pretty good like the episodes themselves they improve as they go along although a couple are merely perfunctionary.

We also get a gag reel, deleted scenes, a three part documentary on the production of the show that DOES provide us with plenty of behind-the-scenes info about the series. One of the best extras is an extended episode of ""The Demon Hand"" (Both a reference to the hand of one of the Terminators AND Harlan Ellison's ""The Outer Limits"" episode ""Demon with A Glass Hand"" which was one of the inspirations for James Cameron's ""The Terminator"".

Well I have to say that after seeing the pilot I was immediately sold.  The action scenes are definately there but not over done and don't stretch past what their effects can do.

The three main actors are perfect for their roles.  The balance between Sarah Connor as mother and tough fighter has been perfected (some would argue that it's a very difficult balance to hold).

John, though not quite there, is starting to learn his leadership role and beginning to feel like someone who might actually save the human race.

And Cameron is....well perfect.  She plays the tough yet curious robot that keeps a couple of secrets to herself about the future.

I can see a lot of time and effort has been made to try and keep the original histories in tact.  There is a shot of the first terminators models that have rubber skin (referenced from the first movie).

It is a rather short season and the plot's focus starts to loose touch towards the end, so I'm hoping that the second season can keep the writing focused and tight.

I'm hopeful though because I've been nothing but impressed so far!",1219104000,,1222,4.534246575342466
2896103,5,B000T9OP7G,"More than six hours of film in nine episodes. The attempt is admirable. To link up the three Terminator films by telling us more or less the story of John Connor and his mother from the moment she gets out of her hospital and the final apocalypse. It can give some depth to John himself It can build around him some family or connections. He gets an uncle from the future. It can play on time and that uncle can look at himself in 2007 when he was still a kid playing baseball. It also gives some density to the mother who was pretty shallow in the films. It can show more about these cyborgs, a good one who protects John and the bad ones. The list would be long of all the good points of this series. It has a shortcoming though. In a story that relies a lot on believing in the vast ellipses it uses, if you want to get down to gritty details you may run into some contradictions. And we do. We need the FBI agent, for some still unknown reason. So he is saved twice. Once by Sarah Connor herself and the other time by a hostile cyborg. Why? We do not know. It does not though bring anything new to the story. It just brings some pleasure by discovering the deeper personalities of characters we liked and we could not explore enough, like John Connor for one. In this first series they avoided the absence of Schwarzenegger by sending a cyborg who was supposed to be the sister of the very young John Connor, hence his age and the other sex for it to be less suspicious, especially when they are not all the time together. I am expecting the second series some day to see the next stage in that slow travel towards Terminator 3, especially since we left them with a car exploding with John's cyborg sister in it. Is that cliffhanging or something?

This was one of, if not THE best new series of last season. Despite the writer's strike shortening this series' first season down to only nine episodes, it was action packed! Forget the few negative reviews out there saying that it ignores T3, because that's a good thing. This is supposed to take place after T2, therefore T3 does not exist in this story line. The writing is clever and sticks to the Terminator canon.

If you're not willing to accept that and enjoy the deeper character development, then don't watch this. In my opinion, as a die hard Terminator fan, this series is an excellent, excellent compliment to the first two movies, and ignores the dreadful T3.

2896106,5,B000T9OP7G,"When the idea for this show was being shopped around, I thought it would not see the light of day.

A movie spin-off, to TV, normally is not going to be any good.  Luckily that is not the case here.

This show takes place after T2, and follows John and Sarah as they try and survive and keep a low profile, while avoiding terminators.

One day something happens, they are spotted, and they meet a new terminator, sent back in time by John.  This terminator is to protect John, this terminator is played by the beautiful Summer Glau.

This show is explosive and pretty big budget.  The special effects look really good, the fight scenes are amazing, and the show has a pretty good cast.  The guest stars are really good too.

After you get to episode 4, the show starts getting even better, it settles into more of a series feel.  The first 2-3 episodes feel more like a big movie, then it gets into series territory, and it does a good job.

What I did first was put in my terminator blu-ray and watched it, followed by T2.  I forgot how good these movies were, and how awesome Arnold was.  When I watched the first episode of SCC I wasn't sure how this show was going to play out, would it be John and Sarah on the run, trying to avoid Terminators, or would it be something else?  Luckily it is something else, but also some running, the show surprised me, and went places I didn't think they would go, and they do a very good job doing it.  This is a pretty good series, unlike the guy below me, please view more episodes, try and make it to at least episode 5, by then you should be hooked!

The video quality is really good.  I'm impressed.  The audio is fantastic.  I love the menus, and the show has some pretty cool special features.  I sat down and watched this in no time flat, took maybe 6-7 hours, it flows easily, and is worth watching no doubt.

It is sad the show only has 9 episodes this season, but the 9 episodes are pretty good.  Some of the cast you will recognize from ""The Shield"", ""The Wire"", ""90210 - The Original One"" and ""Firefly"", ""The Unit"", ""The 4400"" and the movie ""Serenity""

The acting is great, Summer  will send chills down your spine when you view the episode where she is practicing ballerina lessons.

2896107,3,B000T9OP7G,"Of course to be human, I have always wanted to know more about the story behind the original terminator films. A desire or greed to know all about the little details and the stuff between narration. But this isn't the first time I am left disappointed and weary of the truth (think Matrix sequels or the Star Wars prequels). There was a reason why some exposition was left untold and why some backstory was left to the imagination. Most of the time its better to be left alone.

Even still, what happens in the Sarah Connor Chronicles might have been worth knowing, had the glaringly obvious been obvious: had it been written by the same people and directed by James Cameron who created the original films. As it stands, the chronicles are the BS story of impostors and fraudsters who have no right to tell us `what happens'.

The terminator saga was a science fiction too big for a puny FOX TV show. And what we get is a derivative prime hour of generic script writing in the same vein as shows like `prison break' or `heroes'. Not that there isn't a place for these shows but ultimately the original terminator story is stripped of its flesh and bones. What was an explosive cinematic experience is left to soak and fade. With unforgivable flaws like...

A completely non-threatening pin up girl posing as the terminator. Irrespective of her appropriateness in firefly, and even irrespective of the idea that this could actually be feasible. This was a blatant attempt to appease the pimple popping generation that ever since Buffy have forgotten what being a Geek is all about: The science fiction.

A hot mom who is more bang-able than believable. Someone like James Cameron had enough foresight to cast Sigourney Weaver in Aliens or Linda Hamilton as the original Sarah Connor. Linda may not have had feminine model features but she had a rugged bruising presence. And when I saw her doing her pull ups or screaming in the mental house: I could believe it. In contrast her `desperate housewife' counterpart continuously reminds you that this is a TV series in every sense.

The tension, the action and the progression of the story is watered down and uneventful.
The terrifying power of the cyborgs are glossed over. Indestructible in one scene, then weak at the knees in another. In contrast to the massive presence of T1000 or the leather strapped Arnie.

Maybe I wouldn't be so harsh if this was another `Alias' or `Jericho' which has its place in the entertainment medium. But its almost criminal to see such a great cinematic  franchise dissolve in the hands of a small time television host.",1219104000,3,2601,4.741150442477876

2896111,4,B000T9OP7G,"The first season of ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"" surprised me; I expected the show to piggy back on the movies, be short lived and not be very good. Luckily, I was completely wrong on all counts. ""Chronicles"" manages to be engaging, expand on the first three films and be terrifically entertaining. Show developer Josh Friedman (""War of the Worlds"") establishes its own identity for the show.

The image quality for the transfer of the DVD looks good but could look better. I'd like to see what the Blu-ray has to offer. Audio sounds quite good with a nice dramatic score and a nice surround mix.

Following Sarah Connor(Lena Heady), her son John (Thomas Dekker) and Cameron (Summer Glau) a cyborg sent from the future to protect them the series focuses on their attempts to prevent Skynet from being built. They're also being pursued by a variety of Terminators sent into the past to eliminate them.

The set comes with deleted scenes and a number of commentary tracks featuring Friedman, actors Thomas Dekker, Brian Austin Green, Lena Heady Summer Glau and others. The commentary tracks aren't very revealing with the actors, writers and producers focusing more on the dramatic content than the behind-the-scenes production information.

We also get a gag reel, deleted scenes, a three part documentary on the production of the show that DOES provide us with plenty of behind-the-scenes info about the series. One of the best extras is an extended episode of ""The Demon Hand"" (Both a reference to the hand of one of the Terminators AND Harlan Ellison's ""The Outer Limits"" episode ""Demon with A Glass Hand"" which was one of the inspirations for James Cameron's ""The Terminator"". The character of Ellison played by Richard T. Jones is also a tip of the hat to Ellison)which has deleted scenes that gives us information on the childhood of Sarah Connor's character.

I missed the first two episodes though and that's the main reason why I just have to have this on DVD. I'm also a huge fan of the original movies, especially ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"", which is one of my favourite movies ever.

I love the way the 'protective' Terminator this time round is a teenage girl and Summer Glau deserves an award for the way she carries off the emotionless, steely-eyed glare of the cyborg Cameron, (so named in honour of James Cameron, the director of the two first movies, I read somewhere), trying to pick up more human traits the more she spends time with them. Lena Headey and Thomas Dekker as Sarah and John Connor respectively are okay and all but it was really Cameron I tuned in to see every week. I get a huge kick out of seeing strong women on screen and Cameron kicks a**!

Basically, the story is still the same. Cyborgs are still being sent back in time; one to kill John Connor and another to protect him and on the one hand, it's pure cheese and pure escapism but it's also a whole lotta fun. I suppose it's possible one could watch the series and enjoy it without having watched all three of the Terminator movies (there are references all over the place) but I doubt it. I can't wait to see this again on DVD and I'm already gagging for season two!

Never would I have thought of him in this role, or in any other roles  that he cant play a teenager anymore, but here he is superb. He plays his disdain and mistrust of the Cyborgs with the needed restraint. The series does try to fill in the blanks by giving up background, with appearances by Bruce Davison as the former Tuscadero Psychiatrist, who has lost his mind and become a believer in Judgement day in the worst of fanatical ways.

  The police inspector who like Inspector Gerard, starts thinking that maybe there is a one armed man after all. Great performane by the actor in this role.

As far as the female terminator, I guess others have seen her in other movies but this was my first encounter with her on the sceen and at first I thought, great, Jailbait Terminator. But she grows on you. She is scary and cold.  The freakiest scene is where she is looking for the parter of the Turk computer creater who is also in trouble with the Russian Mob. She walks out of the room to the stairwell just as the button men show up.

That scene of the Terminator walking down the steps, not in a hurry,  totally oblivious to the gunshots and cries for mercy from the partner and his sister in the room she just left me freaked.

And maybe its just an opinion. But the Terminators being sent at this timeline seem really stupid and have none of the logic and sense of direction that the T-101 or T-800. Opening up fire in a class room full of kids does not help your mission priority.

2896119,5,B000T9OP7G,"Warning!  Spoilers ahead.

The first season of TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES was a good one. Though fans are now brooding over whether the series will be picked up for a second season -- this is, after all, FOX, killer of shows -- the ratings overall were good, especially in the 18-49 demographic. While I would be the first to acknowledge that you should never underestimate FOX's ability to kill a good show, even FOX will hesitate to cancel a show doing this well in the most desired demographic. If the series is cancelled, it would definitely rank as the most dim-witted cancellation in FOX's history. At least some of the other very good shows that it cancelled were struggling with ratings. My guess is that they will bring it back in the fall and pair it with 24 on Monday nights.

A lot of fans of the original two TERMINATOR films (we can all pretty much ignore the third TERMINATOR film, which even the makers of the forthcoming Christian Bale-as-John Connor film is not going to treat as canonical) were bugged to no end with minor or (in their minds) major chronology issues. My response is: who cares? First, we are talking about two very good SF films, but they are not the cinematic equivalent of WAR AND PEACE. Second, fans of the TERMINATOR films need to learn the same sensibility that fans of comic superheroes have learned: change is good. I mean, what is canonical in Batman? What cannot be allowed in Iron Man? There have been so many variants in comics that if it weren't allowed, there would be no comics. Besides, in the history of story telling there have been an almost uncountable versions of various stories throughout history. If TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES plays around with thee films' chronology, this is the biggest ""no big deal"" of all time. The question is whether the adjustments lead to some great storytelling. I believe it does.

Casting is incredibly important in a series like this. Although by the end of the season more characters are introduced than one might have initially imagined, this is mainly a three-person show. Lena Headley, who is best known to mainstream American TV viewers from the film 300 (though she has been in a very large number of other films and TV series), does a great job in the title role, with one exception. She looks the role, acts the role, comes across as tough in the role. I completely buy her. But I really hope in Season Two that they decide to dispense with the opening narrations. Though she is a good actress, she doesn't sell the narration. Kristen Bell on VERONICA MARS and now on GOSSIP GIRL makes it seem so effortless, as does Jim Dale on PUSHING DAISIES. But it is an easy to underestimate skill. No doubt the writing hinders Headley in her narration. It comes across as too self-conscious, too aware of itself, too unnatural.

Thomas Dexter, who most know from a controversial character from early Season One HEROES (his character was initially Claire the cheerleader's gay best friend -- but when Christian groups started complaining about a gay character, they suddenly un-gayyed him -- I wonder if people who are so obsessed about saving America from gays and the dangers gays represent to marriage [though I've never quite grasped the connection between keeping two dudes getting married and how that is going to make heterosexual marriages healthier] spent more time working on their own marriages if the Bible Belt, which currently has the highest divorce rate in America, would have more successful marriages, heterosexual or otherwise), does a very creditable job as John Connor, the sixteen-year-old version. The challenge of playing John is that it has to be made creditable that this kid would sometime become the kind of leader who could lead a resistance. My major complaint with T2 is that this wasn't done. I think Dekker by the end of the season started doing that. Early in the season he seemed more rebellious, headstrong teenager. But by the end of the season he had started maturing.

The producers of the show say that they created the role of Cameron with Summer Glau in mind. To show how crucial she was in their conception of what they wanted to do, she was offered the role outright, instead of auditioning people for it. And it is obvious that they knew why they wanted her: they'd obviously seen FIREFLY and SERENITY and saw how she played the on-the-edge insane River Tam, who is simultaneously a genius, a psychic, a highly honed killing machine, and a crazy person. There is some legitimate complaint about her performance in the Pilot, but it is the fault of the writing and directing and not Glau. In the Pilot when we first see her, she is a super friendly, socially smooth, chipper, giggly high school girl in the first episode. But the rest of the season she seems to have the same social skills that Arnold did in his turn as your friendly neighborhood terminator. Once they got past the pilot, however, Cameron became one of the best things in the show. Most robots on TV are clearly persons, even if they are not human. Data, for instance, was clearly, for all his lack of emotion, a person. Sharon on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA clearly is, as is Caprica Six. Even the Doctor on STAR TREK: VOYAGER is clearly a person. There is a famous thought experiment known as The Turing Test, from a thought experiment proposed the famous Cambridge mathematician and super genius John Turing. He imagined a test in which a human being and a computer were separated from a questioner by a wall. A series of questions would then ensue. If the questioner couldn't, by the answers that were given, tell which respondent was the computer, then, Turing reasoned, that computer could be considered a person. Cameron is the first important TV cyborg, robot, or android since Robot on LOST IN SPACE who probably couldn't pass the Turing test.

Let me expand a bit on this. Although Cameron can attend school, hang out with people, and basically pass for human, she constantly exposes the gap between her and humans. This is incredibly unusual for television. As a result, this could end up being one of the most important cyborg characters in the history of TV, at the very least the one that could inspire some interesting reflection. She is the first cyborg character on TV who truly seems to be completely devoid of compassion. Early in the season, when a girl she has ""befriended"" is about to jump off a roof in a public act of suicide, Cameron refuses John's entreaties that they do something to help her. Later in the season she promises a ballet instructor, from whom she seems genuinely interested in learning some ballet (it helps that Summer Glau is a real life prima ballerina -- her first acting job was on an episode of ANGEL as a ballerina and she and ANGEL creator Joss Whedon are reportedly working together on a ballet film), that she will save both her and her brother from the people seeking to kill them if they will give her information that she is seeking. They give her the information, but instead of helping them, she coldly (not cruelly -- Cameron does not seem capable of cruelty, just as she is incapable of compassion) exits the building. When asked later why she didn't help them, she replies that it wasn't part of the mission. When John asks her if she lies, she admits that she does, even to him. And the season is filled with some wonderful Cameron moments, such as when she one minute complains about their looking for the remains of a dead girl, because she a dead human is merely ""meat and bones,"" and a few minutes later is found sitting beside John, talking with him, as she applies pink polish to her nails. Her character is filled with incongruities. Oh yeah, she is blown up at the end of Season Two, but no one really believes that she won't be back, do they?

I liked the patience of the show in Season One. They very gradually brought along three supporting characters. Dean Winters in the Pilot played Sarah's fianc Charly and I fully expected the guy I think of as The Beeper King (from his role as Liz Lemon's boyfriend on 30 ROCK) to immediately disappear from the show. Instead he has reappeared in several episodes. My guess is either that he will be killed off or he will end up as part of Sarah and John's little army of supporters. I'm guessing the same will be true of Richard T. Jones's Agent Ellison, who started off as someone after Sarah because he considered her a mere murdered, but as the season has gone alone has come to believe that she was not lying when she claimed to be chased by robots from the future. The finale saw Ellison and a substantial group of FBI agents attack and get mauled by the terminator after John. I would lay money on Charly in the first episode of Season 2 taking Ellison to meet Sarah and having him become another member of her cadre. The third character to emerge was Brian Austin Green as Derek Reese, the brother of Kyle Reese from the first TERMINATOR movie and therefore the uncle of John. I didn't much care for his character by the end of Season One, but that is mainly because he was so gruffly written. I also got tired of his endless suggestions that something needed to be done about Cameron, that she was a killing machine that couldn't be trusted, bladdy blah blah. I hope they either kill him off or deepen his character in Season Two. I suspect they will take the latter route.

My last comment is that this show managed to do what any good show need to: it got better as it went along. I enjoyed the first episode, but with each successive episode I liked the show more and more. I am very much looking forward to Season Two. And completely confidant that there will be one. Not even FOX would be so stupid as to cancel it.",1215820800,17,9757,4.622260668973472
2896120,4,B000T9OP7G,"While this show isn't James Cameron calibur stuff, for television it is really well done with some nice acting and top notch visual effects. I was never a T3 hater, but after watching the first season of The Sarah Connor Chronicles, I prefer this storyline and will happily ignore everything in T3 (at least until the fourth movie comes out in 2009).

Lena Headey makes a good Sarah Connor, but the real star is Summer Glau, of Firefly and Serenity fame, who plays the cyborg protector named Cameron. She is cute, funny when trying not to be, and downright deadly when in combat. Not to mention the fact that this series shows off Brian Austin Green's acting skill and succeeds. What did I just say?

If your a fan of the movies, you will find much to enjoy here. It isn't up to par with shows like LOST or 24 just yet, but who knows what the future will hold?",1215561600,16,860,4.36875

2896126,5,B000T9OP7G,"Terminator: The Sara Connor Chronicles Season One has not been released yet on Blu Ray, but I have pre-ordered and anxiously await for its arrival.  However, I have downloaded the entire season from Unbox and the quality isn't bad at all, but rather good in fact, but not quite as good as the 720p hd version broadcast on Fox. I can't wait for the 1080p version on Blu Ray. I have already written one review about this series
for the Unbox download and mentioned then that I think the producers have done rather well considering that they did not have the budget to work with their big brothers' of the big screen had. I am one of those few,I suppose that didn't particularly care for T3. There was nothing technically wrong with it, but I didn't like the ending at all.  The T3 ending sort of messed things up as far as the timeline coda was concerned which took the saga into a different direction than the television series. I think the producers were wanting to get another crack at Arnold before he ran for Governor of California, and they simply wanted to just get another script out there. That's okay though, because if you look at Superman, it has several different spin offs as well as the original theme; ie ""Smallville"" and ""Lois and Clark."" In T3, Sarah Connor alledgedly died from cancer. The writers of the tv series explained that away as mentioning that when Sarah, John, and Cameron time travelled eight years into the future, they by-passed Sarah's death. Okay, that makes sense to me, I guess. In doing stories about time travel, you have the flexibility to explore different timelines and this technique will probably be used here; an indication of that has already been shown introducing Derrick Reese, Kyle Reese's brother. The bottom line is, I don't think the real Terminator fans are going to care that much, because it's all just pure fantasy anyway and great entertainment fare.

2896130,5,B000T9OP7G,"Firstly, I'd like to preface this with a caveat that I'm a huge fan of the first two Terminator movies and their supplementary materials (books, games, etc). T3, however, is definitely not on my list of favorite movies.

This show wouldn't have been as successful as it's been if it had had a different cast or a different producer. The fact that the show launched smack in the middle of a Writer's Guild Strike and still manage to perform well in both time slot viewings and DVR's says alot about the quality of the show.

The story lines are very well thought out, confronting issues of not only human relationships, but the relationships of humans and machines. I think putting forth the idea that SKYNET ultimately evolved from a simple chess computer (""The Turk"") is a great way of grounding not only the series but the franchise in simple reality, as well as generating a simple ""this could happen anywhere"" aura around the show. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, and I'll never look at my Dell the same way again. I'm also very glad they've avoided the ""Terminator of the Week"" series model, and instead of focusing on running away from SKYNET, they are making an attempt to face it. An attempt that we know will be ultimately futile, but it will be interesting to see how much of what happens in the series lays the groundwork for John Connor's eventual war against SKYNET.

I'd also like to give props to the actors, who have really taken their characters and run with them. I am a huge Firefly/Serenity fan, so Summer Glau was very familiar to me, as was Brian Austin Green. However, Thomas Dekker, Lena Headey, Dean Winters, and Richard T. Jones were all unknown quantities to me. Summer is as great as she's ever been, and has really gone from bit parts to a truly up and coming actress. Brian Austin Green has (thankfully) left his 90210 baggage behind and can now not only act, but do so really, really well.  Thomas Dekker is simply fantastic, and I think the best John Connor so far.

There has been some debate about who plays a better Sarah Connor, Linda Hamilton or Lena Headey? I think it's kind of a loaded question because both women play Sarah Connor at drastically different points in their lives. Linda Hamilton played Sarah Connor when Sarah's only concern was protecting John from attack. Lena Headey is portraying Sarah in a time when protecting him is still a concern, but training him for his eventual destiny is of even greater importance.

Another point worth mentioning is that after viewing the series, I finally broke down and rented 300. I'm a huge history buff, especially of ancient greece, so hyper inflated ""artistic"" portrayals of actual events don't really appeal to me. However, Lena as Queen Gorgo really impressed to me throughout the movie, and I see alot of Gorgo in Lena's portrayal of Sarah. I'm not accusing Lena of being a one trick pony (which she isn't), but I believe that her portrayal of a strong female archetype in a blockbuster movie was perfect training for her to assume the role of Sarah Connor.

Richard T. Jones as FBI agent Ellison and Dean winters as Sarah's ex-Fiance Charlie are fantastic additions to the franchise. Most of the humans in the franchise are intimately intwined with the events the series portrays. Ellison and Charlie both enter as relative outsiders and their gradual understanding of what is really going on in the world of the series is a great new perspective on the events of the show. Charlie and Cameron also have probably one of the most memorable exchanges between two characters in season 1 (during episode 6, ""Dungeons and Dragons"")

As mentioned before, TSCC produced and aired in the middle of a WGA strike. With a season shortened to only 9 episodes, the fact that this series has generated as much fandom and hype as it has is a testament to how great it is. News just broke that the series has been renewed for Season 2, for 13 episodes with the possibility of extension to the full 22.

Also, the DVD box set should be coming out in the middle of august, according to the producers. FOX will be releasing the box set and airing reruns on monday nights starting in august, as a run up to the premier of season two.

Apparently, the suits at Fox have learned from their Firefly Folly and are finally giving a hit sci-fi series the marketing and timeslot it deserves.",1209427200,15,4379,4.638709677419355

2896132,5,B000T9OP7G,"First, I was a Linda Hamilton fan.  I thought her role in the first two Terminator movies was the cement that held everything together.  However, Linda is 51 years old now and she really shows her age and not anywhere nearly as buff as she was in T2.  Lena Headey is about the same age Linda was, in her early thirties when Linda was in T2 which fits in the right time line. Lena's doing okay for a British actor portraying an American and I find her convincing as a hardened and calloused Sarah Connor.  As for the writing that one critic wannabe scorned, is not Gone with the Wind nor pretends to be.  William Wisher and James Cameron collaborated on T2 and the writing was not all that great either, but the story itself was.  I have four versions of T2 and will acquire my Blu Ray version shortly making five and on my short list of my all time favorite movies. T:SSC is an honorable endeavor for a television series. I am surprised that it is as good as it is given that budgets for a television series are lean to start with in comparison to their predecesors on the big screen. It perpetuates the Terminator franchise much to the delight of Terminator fans. The series opens limitless possibilities in  story lines and I like the soap opera aspect much the same way I did with the shadow government story line of X-Files. Both Lena Headey and Summer Glau are established actors in their own right, Heady appeared in Brothers Grimm and Glau in Serenity, and are premium talent for a television series. Summer Glau, 27 yoa, is very convincing as the second female terminator and she looks young enough to portray a high school junior or senior.  Twenty one year old Thomas Dekker has a more difficult time trying to be someone five years younger than he is.  In high def, he has the noticable five o'clock shadow of a mature adult male, but still, John Connor grew up fast.  One can nit pick at all the little shortcomings and all that does is prevent one can from enjoying a hour's escapism.  My only fear is that the series will end long before all the story ideas have been done because of burnout by the cast.",1209081600,4,2118,4.419023136246786

Fortunately though, other aspects of this show are so strong that it gets a huge enthusiastic thumbs-up from me.  The action and special effects are great, the science fiction elements are new and interesting, and the drama is excellent.  Acting is solid, and the teenage John Connor character is well-cast.  The Terminator protector fembot, Summer Glau, has the most memorable scenes though, and is the real star of the show.  She has far more shades and nuances than the Arnold bodyguard in T2, and manages to be both likable and creepy at the same time.  I also enjoyed Brian Austin Green as John's uncle from the future; he plays a gritty character similar to Reese (John's father) in the first Terminator, but wiser and more ruthless.  Finally, the evil terminators are played icy cold, and are a joy to watch.

2896140,5,B000T9OP7G,"The first season of TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES was a good one.  Though fans are now brooding over whether the series will be picked up for a second season -- this is, after all, FOX, killer of shows -- the ratings overall were good, especially in the 18-49 demographic.  While I would be the first to acknowledge that you should never underestimate FOX's ability to kill a good show, even FOX will hesitate to cancel a show doing this well in the most desired demographic.  If the series is cancelled, it would definitely rank as the most dim-witted cancellation in FOX's history.  At least some of the other very good shows that it cancelled were struggling with ratings.  My guess is that they will bring it back in the fall and pair it with 24 on Monday nights.

A lot of fans of the original two TERMINATOR films (we can all pretty much ignore the third TERMINATOR film, which even the makers of the forthcoming Christian Bale-as-John Connor film is not going to treat as canonical) were bugged to no end with minor or (in their minds) major chronology issues.  My response is:  who cares?  First, we are talking about two very good SF films, but they are not the cinematic equivalent of WAR AND PEACE.  Second, fans of the TERMINATOR films need to learn the same sensibility that fans of comic superheroes have learned:  change is good.  I mean, what is canonical in Batman?  What cannot be allowed in Iron Man?  There have been so many variants in comics that if it weren't allowed, there would be no comics.  Besides, in the history of story telling there have been an almost uncountable versions of various stories throughout history.  If TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES plays around with thee films' chronology, this is the biggest ""no big deal"" of all time.  The question is whether the adjustments lead to some great storytelling.  I believe it does.

Casting is incredibly important in a series like this.  Although by the end of the season more characters are introduced than one might have initially imagined, this is mainly a three-person show.  Lena Headley, who is best known to mainstream American TV viewers from the film 300 (though she has been in a very large number of other films and TV series), does a great job in the title role, with one exception.  She looks the role, acts the role, comes across as tough in the role.  I completely buy her.  But I really hope in Season Two that they decide to dispense with the opening narrations.  Though she is a good actress, she doesn't sell the narration.  Kristen Bell on VERONICA MARS and now on GOSSIP GIRL makes it seem so effortless, as does Jim Dale on PUSHING DAISIES.  But it is an easy to underestimate skill.  No doubt the writing hinders Headley in her narration.  It comes across as too self-conscious, too aware of itself, too unnatural.

Thomas Dexter, who most know from a controversial character from early Season One HEROES (his character was initially Claire the cheerleader's gay best friend -- but when Christian groups started complaining about a gay character, they suddenly un-gayyed him -- I wonder if people who are so obsessed about saving America from gays and the dangers gays represent to marriage [though I've never quite grasped the connection between keeping two dudes getting married and how that is going to make heterosexual marriages healthier] spent more time working on their own marriages if the Bible Belt, which currently has the highest divorce rate in America, would have more successful marriages, heterosexual or otherwise), does a very creditable job as John Connor, the sixteen-year-old version.  The challenge of playing John is that it has to be made creditable that this kid would sometime become the kind of leader who could lead a resistance.  My major complaint with T2 is that this wasn't done.  I think Dekker by the end of the season started doing that.  Early in the season he seemed more rebellious, headstrong teenager.  But by the end of the season he had started maturing.

The producers of the show say that they created the role of Cameron with Summer Glau in mind.  To show how crucial she was in their conception of what they wanted to do, she was offered the role outright, instead of auditioning people for it.  And it is obvious that they knew why they wanted her:  they'd obviously seen FIREFLY and SERENITY and saw how she played the on-the-edge insane River Tam, who is simultaneously a genius, a psychic, a highly honed killing machine, and a crazy person.  There is some legitimate complaint about her performance in the Pilot, but it is the fault of the writing and directing and not Glau.  In the Pilot when we first see her, she is a super friendly, socially smooth, chipper, giggly high school girl in the first episode.  But the rest of the season she seems to have the same social skills that Arnold did in his turn as your friendly neighborhood terminator.  Once they got past the pilot, however, Cameron became one of the best things in the show.  Most robots on TV are clearly persons, even if they are not human.  Data, for instance, was clearly, for all his lack of emotion, a person.  Sharon on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA clearly is, as is Caprica Six.  Even the Doctor on STAR TREK: VOYAGER is clearly a person.  There is a famous thought experiment known as The Turing Test, from a thought experiment proposed the famous Cambridge mathematician and super genius John Turing.  He imagined a test in which a human being and a computer were separated from a questioner by a wall.  A series of questions would then ensue.  If the questioner couldn't, by the answers that were given, tell which respondent was the computer, then, Turing reasoned, that computer could be considered a person.  Cameron is the first important TV cyborg, robot, or android since Robot on LOST IN SPACE who probably couldn't pass the Turing test.

Let me expand a bit on this.  Although Cameron can attend school, hang out with people, and basically pass for human, she constantly exposes the gap between her and humans.  This is incredibly unusual for television.  As a result, this could end up being one of the most important cyborg characters in the history of TV, at the very least the one that could inspire some interesting reflection.  She is the first cyborg character on TV who truly seems to be completely devoid of compassion.  Early in the season, when a girl she has ""befriended"" is about to jump off a roof in a public act of suicide, Cameron refuses John's entreaties that they do something to help her.  Later in the season she promises a ballet instructor, from whom she seems genuinely interested in learning some ballet (it helps that Summer Glau is a real life prima ballerina -- her first acting job was on an episode of ANGEL as a ballerina and she and ANGEL creator Joss Whedon are reportedly working together on a ballet film), that she will save both her and her brother from the people seeking to kill them if they will give her information that she is seeking.  They give her the information, but instead of helping them, she coldly (not cruelly -- Cameron does not seem capable of cruelty, just as she is incapable of compassion) exits the building.  When asked later why she didn't help them, she replies that it wasn't part of the mission.  When John asks her if she lies, she admits that she does, even to him.  And the season is filled with some wonderful Cameron moments, such as when she one minute complains about their looking for the remains of a dead girl, because she a dead human is merely ""meat and bones,"" and a few minutes later is found sitting beside John, talking with him, as she applies pink polish to her nails.  Her character is filled with incongruities.  Oh yeah, she is blown up at the end of Season Two, but no one really believes that she won't be back, do they?

I liked the patience of the show in Season One.  They very gradually brought along three supporting characters.  Dean Winters in the Pilot played Sarah's fianc Charly and I fully expected the guy I think of as The Beeper King (from his role as Liz Lemon's boyfriend on 30 ROCK) to immediately disappear from the show.  Instead he has reappeared in several episodes.  My guess is either that he will be killed off or he will end up as part of Sarah and John's little army of supporters.  I'm guessing the same will be true of Richard T. Jones's Agent Ellison, who started off as someone after Sarah because he considered her a mere murdered, but as the season has gone alone has come to believe that she was not lying when she claimed to be chased by robots from the future.  The finale saw Ellison and a substantial group of FBI agents attack and get mauled by the terminator after John.  I would lay money on Charly in the first episode of Season 2 taking Ellison to meet Sarah and having him become another member of her cadre.  The third character to emerge was Brian Austin Green as Derek Reese, the brother of Kyle Reese from the first TERMINATOR movie and therefore the uncle of John.  I didn't much care for his character by the end of Season One, but that is mainly because he was so gruffly written.  I also got tired of his endless suggestions that something needed to be done about Cameron, that she was a killing machine that couldn't be trusted, bladdy blah blah.  I hope they either kill him off or deepen his character in Season Two.  I suspect they will take the latter route.

My last comment is that this show managed to do what any good show need to:  it got better as it went along.  I enjoyed the first episode, but with each successive episode I liked the show more and more.  I am very much looking forward to Season Two.  And completely confidant that there will be one.  Not even FOX would be so stupid as to cancel it.",1204588800,15,9807,4.617562102830734
2896141,5,B000T9OP7G,"It's a rare thing that a TV series based upon a movie's premise ends up being as good as the show's origins: while slow to start, with a dreadful pilot and many sub-par episodes, the first series of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, over-all, became something that arguably lived up to that standard.

The show follows Sarah and John as they try, again, to prevent Judgement Day. The show follows on from the original two movies, generally ignoring the third (thankfully.) Much of the plot surrounds the character of Cameron, a female terminator sent back from the future to protect John. The show, so far at least, has eschewed predictable cliches involving the character, and often takes the viewer by surprise, from displays of dark humor to dragging the viewer through alternate displays of coldness and humanity.

Episodes I particularly recommend include ""Dungeons and Dragons"" and the jaw-dropping follow-up ""The Demon Hand"". Performances are variable. Lena Headey doesn't match Linda Hamilton's portrayal of the title character, reflecting more the post-La Femme Nikita (Dark Angel, Bionic Woman) obsession with angsty heroines. Thomas Dekker either gives the best or the second-best performance as John Connor, depending on whether you're familiar with the Director's Cut of Terminator 2. It's a good performance. The best performances are arguably by Summer Glau and Richard T Jones, as Cameron - a Terminatrix sent back to protect the Connors - and James Ellison - the surprised FBI agent chasing Sarah Connor - respectively. Glau's performance, while initially confused, provides depictions of humour and coldness that surprises or shocks the viewer every time.

This DVD set is reasonable for what you pay for, reflecting the short nine-episode run of the first season, cut short due to the 2008 Writer's Strike. The set includes a few commentaries and cut scenes. The aforementioned ""Demon Hand"" episode is complemented by a ""rough-cut"" of an alternative version, though the jarring changes in visual and audio quality make it somewhat difficult to enjoy by itself. Over-all, visual quality is excellent, I doubt you'll get much more enjoyment out of the less portable Blu-ray edition.

For all of their qualities, the original two Terminator films - at least, as released theatrically - were basic killer robot fantasies with their depth being limited to surface level discussions of time travel and anthropomorphism. Some would argue that the Director's Cut of T2 was a considerable step above this and I'd agree with them. But regardless, the first series of The Sarah Connor Chronicles managed to rise above the Theatrical versions of the movies: what seemed like another attempt to cash in on a pop-culture classic turned out to be a smart, entertaining, thought-provoking science fiction series. This DVD set is definitely recommended.",1204243200,115,2862,5.269736842105263
2896142,4,B000T9OP7G,"I've got to get one thing out of the way first, for all those who didn't like Terminator 3.  The Sarah Connor Chronicles does NOT pretend T3 doesn't exist, it addressed one of major issues in the film in its first 2 episodes.  And since this is sci-fi, complete with time travel, there's no reason that history (even future history) can't be re-written.

To the folks who think the action is ""great...for a t.v. show,"" I can only assume they haven't been watching t.v. in the last 10 years or so.  There have been several shows that far eclipse what is being done in movies (Buffy, Alias, two more girl-power shows just off the top of my head).

What really surprised me about the show is how faithful it is to the first and second movies.  In just this shortened (9 episodes) first season, we've seen the following characters from the films appear: Miles Dyson's widow and son, Dr. Silverman, Enrique and Kyle Reese.

As for the cast, Lena Headly is no Linda Hamilton, but her voice-overs became more and more convincing and even poignant as the episodes progressed.  And of course, what sci-fi geek didn't salivate over the news of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Firefly-The-Complete-Series/dp/B0000AQS0F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Firefly - The Complete Series</a>'s Summer Glau being cast in the pivotal role of female cyborg Cameron.  And considering John Connor has been played by 3 different actors, Thomas Decker acquits himself quite well.  He's less irritating than Edward Furlong, by a long shot.

If the show has a flaw, it's that at times it does feel a little too familiar.  One has to wonder how long the writers will be able to sustain Sarah and John's journey, without really damaging the integrity of the film series.  And I realize CGI is the norm for special effects these days, but give me a REAL metal (or at least plastic that looks like metal) endoskeleton over this computer-generated mess any day.

I think The Sarah Connor Chronicles is a fine continuation of the Terminator universe.  No, it's not that rare series that's actually BETTER than the movies (OK, it's not THAT rare in sci-fi...see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stargate-SG-1-The-Complete-Series-Collection/dp/B000TJBNHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stargate SG-1 - The Complete Series Collection</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buffy-The-Vampire-Slayer-Collector-s-Set-40-discs/dp/B000AQ68RI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buffy The Vampire Slayer - Collector's Set (40 discs)</a>), but it's certainly among the best t.v. adaptations of movie storyline.

2896143,3,B000T9OP7G,"I want to review both of these items because this is my first experience with both of these items.

Thanks to the Instapundit, I had the opportunity to download Amazon Unbox and downloaded my first episode of the Terminator chronicles.

I am using Windows XP with 512 megs of RAM and 1.1 Ghz Pentium 4 processor and a 40 gig HD. I downloaded Amazon Unbox without any problems.  It installed without any problems and I was able to download The Terminator chronicles without any problems.  Let me say that without high speed Internet (either DSL, cable or Fiber) it would not be possible.

My congratulations to people that designed the software for Unbox.  The install process was lengthy but it was successful.  There are no major problems as of yet.  Though I don't know what kind of data the software is sending to Amazon.

Now as to the Terminator chronicles.  It is better than the movie.  Plot and character development are much better.  Mother and son are very well done.  They both work well together.  But it needs some work.  The son has to grow up and become an adult, he just sounds petulant for now.  Hopefully that will change.

All in all a very good experience because there is an element of realism about it.",1203206400,,1224,4.592592592592593

2896147,5,B000T9OP7G,"I have to say that I found the show to be a pleasant diversion from the doldrums of reality TV. I watched with great interest being that I am a Terminator fan, and I have to say that it's a departure that I'm in favor of. I like the fact that they didn't go for the copy of Arnold or try like hell to be as good as the movie. I think this one takes a departure that is worth waiting for. You want to know how Summer Glau's character is different from other Terminator Models.

Some of the plot they borrowed from one of the Terminator Books that I read, but that's ok. I liked that book. I guess that I would say that I hope they allow the show to unfold enough to find its audience. I'm glad TV has not forgotten us Sci-Fi nuts and put something out there that I find watchable.

I look forward to seeing what's going to happen.",1201046400,6,829,4.0181818181818185

8208338,4,B000T9OP7G,"The discs come in plastic snap cases. The plastic swivel thingee that holds the season one discs has already broke. The plastic swivel thingee for the season two discs is okay so far. I've only watched this series once and I take care of my stuff so there's no reason why the swivel thingee for season one should have broken.

The series is overloaded with advertising. Every disc has ads for the terminator movies.

The first season of Terminator is short and good. The second season is a confusing mess, especially towards the end. Here's a laundry list of problems I had with season two: The season starts crazy with a big car bomb explosion, but no police show up in the neighborhood. Where they on strike or vacation? There's a big shootout at an apartment, but none of the other tenants notice. That's just the beginning of the stupidity. The female liquid terminator was too unrealistic for me. Pure fantasy. I didn't like it when Connor Trinnear from Star Trek Enterprise got shot. And the Riley character sucks.

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002), and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969), Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001), and The Tudors (2007-2010). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1521158400,,2475,5.368556701030927
