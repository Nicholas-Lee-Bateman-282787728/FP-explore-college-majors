8152193,2,B000JMK6HG,"The stalking that Charlie (Steven Roy) does was not done in a humorous fashion. His sabotage of his ex-girlfriend's relationship was more disturbing than humorous. Mallory (Josie Maran) appeared to be as dysfunctional of Charlie, and outside of her looks I failed to see the attraction.

Charlie gets a new girlfriend, one that would make me forget Mallory and quite a bit more. Charlie's friend Nick (Sean Marble) is one of those guys which women in real life hate, but in the movies, they love. Clare Kramer, as Charlie's boss gave us the best performance in the movie, but not good enough to carry it. I thought Josie Maran really sucked in this one, although the script never gave her any clever lines or personality, she failed to create one.",1340323200,,747,4.746153846153846
8152194,2,B000JMK6HG,"I got this movie because Clare Kramer was in it (Buffy the vampire killer fame) and she ended up to play a very small part as an office manager. The movie is about a jealous male stalking his x. Just the kind of movie I did not want to watch, but I painfully finished the movie off and it will go on the shelf in back where I will probably never see it again.",1304553600,,359,3.864864864864865
8152195,4,B000JMK6HG,"I have been waiting for this DVD to be released for quite a long time, I am a huge fan of Josie Maran and seeing as this was her film debut, I simply had to see it as soon as it was available.

The only clue as to the contents of the movie was the trailer, available online from several sources more or less as soon as the film made it's film festival debut. Since that's all I had to go on, the movie I saw tonight was different in tone compared to what I expected based on the trailer.

The Mallory Effect is more than slightly darker in tone than I expected. There are some very funny bits, don't get me wrong but there were also moments where I couldn't find sympathy for any of the characters at all.

Charlie, the one that gets dumped by Mallory at the beginning of the film, crosses the line between lovelorn obsession and felonious behavior more than a few times. And his treatment of another young woman towards the end of the film was reprehensible.

The writing was good, even though it sorta seemed weak at some points, it was an interesting storyline, who can't relate to being dumped, after all? The acting for the most part was good. The important thing to remember is that this is a low budget movie, there will be some weak acting and dodgy camera work and poor lighting at times.

Josie Maran did well for her first film, she had to go through a range of emotions and was fairly convincing throughout.

Three stars for the film and an extra star for Josie. She rocks!",1176940800,4,1485,4.285714285714286
