8408490,5,B000BP8QA0,"Raised as a Christian I had never fully understood the meaning of Passover and therefore, Holy Communion. Wow. I realize now how far modern Christianity has moved away from Jesus' heritage and God's heart for His original beloved people. (Yes, how little I've understood Paul's and the 12 disciples' identities, too). This video is like the missing puzzle piece that suddenly enlightened and made me feel whole. I can now be deeply proud to embrace the completeness of the Bible. I have always felt excluded from sharing with my Jewish friends who have been afraid to ""let me in"" as if I, a loving Christian, am somehow suspect as having some agenda to convert them.  On the contrary, I long to share with my Jewish loved-ones in partnership, praise and worship, to overcome those walls of distrust as God clearly intends in order to extend His love to all His creation, adopting beyond the ""chosen ones"" to save all who will come to Him. This video helps me understand and be patient, to love my Jewish friends in spite of feeling excluded.  If you, like me, always wondered why Jesus broke the matzoh, calling it ""his body,"" and shared the pieces with each one, not as merely ""remembrance of me"" and token Sunday morning snack, but as a CONTINUUM of symbolism from the EXODUS events, you will love this video for its illumination of Jewish/Christian prophetic fullfilment. I am indebted to David Brickner for his opening the door to me and inviting me to enjoy much higher order worship of our Lord. This was truly great to see!",1302480000,,1530,4.705223880597015
