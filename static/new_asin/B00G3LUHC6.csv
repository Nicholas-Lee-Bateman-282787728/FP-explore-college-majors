8620453,5,B00G3LUHC6,"I think this set of DVD's is well worth having in the library, of anyone interested in Martial Arts / Self Defense. Of course, not all of the 140 applications would necessarily prove to be the ""best move"" when in a particular situation as demonstrated, but a lot of the approaches were very unique, and insightful. The applications and techniques were well-filmed and well demonstrated, very clearly, from multiple angles. I appreciate the humor that was left in the final release of these DVD's, showing the models posing as assailants truly grimacing in pain, or cursing (bleeped) after certain applications were demonstrated. It was genuine, and unscripted.",1501286400,2,660,5.177570093457944

8620457,3,B00G3LUHC6,"I like the material and I'd even go as far to say that it's the best home study material out there. It is a bit boring though. And why I'm only giving three stars is because I've got all three how to get my Wado black belt, 140 combat moves, and advanced. Each one arived with a damaged case with dvd's floating around inside. The cases suck!",1430179200,3,342,4.119402985074627
8620458,5,B00G3LUHC6,Detailed instructions and a great assortment of techniques to practice.  Great production quality and great instruction.  Want to learn self defense and not commit to a lifetime in a particular martial art?  If so then this is for you.,1403913600,4,235,4.9743589743589745
8620459,5,B00G3LUHC6,"This set, is by the title, Advanced Combat Moves. The initial set was unbelievably good and this set successfully follows it.

I am 59 years old and have studied the martial arts for some 30 years. Everything from Kempo, to Jiu Jitsu, to Krav Maga.

This DVD set has expanded my knowledge incredibly. They are effective. Very effective, as I have tried most of them on various sparring partners. The techniques are not to be watched idly sitting in a chair. They should be practiced.

Jeff and John once again emphasize that there are not just 4 weapons available for self defense. There are at least 9. Including the knees, elbows and head. The only place I have seen these used is in Krav Maga and MMA tournaments in the United States.

But these techniques go even further. They incorporate moves that are NOT allowed in MMA competition. Krav Maga has many awesome techniques, but they can be devastating and subject to legal ramifications if over-used.

In this set, everything is so logical and flows so easily. I find myself anticipating what to do next. And then being surprised at what Jeff and John do in response. And they do it all so well.

They use the same methodology in this set as in the original set. They demonstrate in full speed, half speed, and then in slow motion. They even do stop action where they use arrows, circles and other video additions to emphasize the correct way of doing the moves. EVERYTHING is explicitly explained. It is like sitting in a front row seat at a seminar !

I have many favorite techniques that are sequentially numbered for easy reference. Among them are  #10, the goose neck hold.
#34 Pinch Chest, # 55 Twist and Throw which is awesome. But I will stop here. I could go on and on.

These are all great techniques for men. But what about women, you might ask ? They introduce Alicja beginning in combat move #100. She shows her skills at these techniques in a fashion that is very effective. She could very well have utilized the other techniques as well. These are not strength based moves. I cannot over-emphasize this fact. i feel so much safer walking the streets waiting for my bus, I cannot tell you.

One last point. These DVDS not only show you what to do, how to do it, but also where to do it. They do this by showing where on the body the punches, kicks,  elbows and pinches are to be placed. Yes, pinches. But these pinches are not the pinches that you did as a child. They are most effective and easily used in precarious situations. But, seeing is believing. And Jeff and John do sometimes show the effects of these ""pinches"" after they are done.

These ""pinches"" are actually being successfully applied to nerve centers and pressure points. They are not to be
under-estimated !

So, good luck and enjoy this set !",1391817600,5,2781,4.538
