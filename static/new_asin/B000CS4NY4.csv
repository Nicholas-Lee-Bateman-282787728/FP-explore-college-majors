All you are required to say is ""this is the importance of this exercise"". He is WAAAAAY too long winded. I think I'd learned PERHAPS five new viewpoints from this video. Save your $ & go join a Gum if you want to learn boxing",1472774400,,381,4.026315789473684
8101523,5,B000CS4NY4,"I myself come from an MMA Background.
I started Kyokushin and later went into BJJ a bit.
Then after that i started training MMA and did quite well so far. ( I currently have 4-1 stats in MMA competition)

However allthough i have natural punching power and hit quite heavy i always lacked the proper movement to make everything as fluid and effective as some of the guys i train with do. The guys who have the most outstanding movement were mostly former Boxers who had competed for 5+ years in Boxing and now tried some MMA.

One of my goals is to one day move as fluid and effective as they do.

I was searching through Videos and Instructionals on the Internet and this is where i someday found the Kenny Weldon DVD Series.
Now i found what i was looking for.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This DVD Series is exactly about how u can move any direction efficient,fluidly and with speed while being able to throw any punch with power from any position at any time.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Of course its no mystery that to achive these goal you have to work hard for several years.
However this DVD series gives you the right tools (detailed and precise instructions on what to train everyday) to succeed in case you decide to give it your best
