8435968,5,B004MFFB2Q,A very good movie with Ronald Reagan with very good acting performance!!!!,1422230400,,74,5.25
8435969,3,B004MFFB2Q,"I know Don Siegel has proven himself with other films, but he's done in by the script here and I think Ronald Reagan was done in by the direction. The problem isn't the supporting cast including Viveca Lindfors (kind of difficult to understand in what was supposed to be her break-out role) and Broderick Crawford. It's not that Reagan's that bad--he plays the difficult part of a scientist tormented by a secret (he has...epilepsy!!!) as its written. He's good looking, has a good voice, good inflection on the lines, hits his marks...and yet, to me, something about his acting always seems more like he's performing in a stage play. I think his stiff somewhat wooden body language is part of it and that I rarely feel he's actually interacting with his co-stars, really feeling it.

I have a feeling the director made a big difference in how well he did. For a really good Ronald Reagan performance, I'd recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Voice-of-the-Turtle/dp/B00A1AU6VC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Voice of the Turtle</a>&nbsp;Even though it's a light romance, he still brings acting talent that is not on display here, but would have helped. In ""Turtle"" he is expressive, natural, handsome and romantic, and brings the kind of charm and mannerisms that were associated with him as president.

This movie is filmed well in black and white, but the overall effect (including the loud, melodramatic music) as if its some kind of gothic supernatural suspense film (""Hitchcock on a budget"" is not far from the idea.)

The story seems as if it is supernatural or a mystery...only it isn't. Viveca is dealing with memories of her dead husband and the conviction that he still is haunting the house she has rented to Reagan. That part is a little interesting, but has no real pay off. And Reagan's BIG SECRET is that he has a mild form of epilepsy. This is treated with over-the-top hush-hush seriousness and he has a few speeches that are written like public health service announcements (invariably talk of epilepsy is accompanied by Very Dramatic Music). He is so ashamed of having epilepsy that he almost kills himself because of it.

Reagan and Lindfors are a good looking couple, the black and white set is appropriately atmospheric, and it's fun to see the President of the United States star in a movie. But other than this, I can't think of any reason to watch this film.",1418083200,2,2435,5.0648379052369075
8435970,5,B004MFFB2Q,"excellent movie. great acting ,great photography add to the mysterious nature of this movie. and this movie has a good moral teaching. this was when we really had great actors without the foulded mouth and trash put out by hollywood today. they had to know their craft reagan and landers start out as sceptics about life and end up coming around to believe in faith in the things they cant see. love and faith overcome",1396483200,,418,4.586666666666667
8435971,5,B004MFFB2Q,I consider this one of Ronald Reagan best movie roles.  Also Vivica Lindfors is great and the rest of the cast.,1395705600,,111,4.285714285714286
8435972,3,B004MFFB2Q,"""Night Unto Night"" is a hodgepodge of partially realized ideas, a crazy quilt of a movie which is nevertheless worth a look if only because of the presence of the startlingly beautiful young Viveca Lindfors.  Filmed in 1947, but not released until 1949, ""Night Unto Night"" was one of Lindfors' first vehicles under her contract with Warner Brothers, which hoped to make her into the next Ingrid Bergman.  Unfortunately, ""Night Unto Night"" never amounted to much more than a derivative B movie version of ""Spellbound"", Hitchcock's 1945 psycho-drama, with bits of ""Rebecca"", ""Hurricane"", and other melodramas thrown in for good measure.

Postwar America was apparently ripe for these kind of melodramas, in which heroes and heroines were cast as thinking people more than men and women of action, and plots showed them confronting antagonists in the form of inner demons.  In ""Night Unto Night"", Lindfors plays Anne Gracy, a strongly intelligent woman who is haunted by the memory of her deceased husband.  Needing to break free of her attachment, she sublets her house to John Galen (Ronald Reagan), a pipe-smoking biochemist who is tormented by his own mounting symptoms of epilepsy.

Lindfors and Reagan make a handsome couple, but though the movie strains mightily (with some effectively 'noir' cinematography)it ultimately fails to gel.  Oh, it retains some period charm ,  but stabs at pretentiously arty shots of swirling clouds, breaking waves, and oddly framed close-ups might cause your eyes to roll---and in the end, the script fails to let you know what, if anything, this film is driving at.  The characters appear to harbor intellectual pretensions that they are unable to express.  Secondary  roles (Ola Massen as a very jealous sister, Broderick Crawford as an sccomplished illustrator who longs to be a recognized artist, and even Lillian Yarbo as a warbling black housekeeper) add a lot of color to the movie, but no resolution.  The characters all appear to be waiting for something to happen.  But, in the absence of any real conflict, all that can be done is to ""cue the big storm.""  It's a  storm which bends the palms nearly horizontal, but still fails to resolve this rather pointless movie--- a movie that looks good but has no core.

Director Donald Siegel went on to direct many memorable films, including ""The Invasion of the Bodysnatchers"" and several films starring Clint Eastwood.  So there is some talent on display in ""Night Unto Night""---just not enough to rescue a movie with far too many loose ends and silly pretenses.  When you try to emulate Hitchcock, you run the risk of wading in to a level somewhere above your head.  That's what happened here, I'm afraid.  It's an interesting relic from a time when America was waking up to some possibilities, after WWII.  But it's still a badly flawed movie...there was a reason it was withheld from release for so long.",1390867200,,2898,4.995833333333334
8435973,3,B004MFFB2Q,"This is one of those films that rarely airs on TV.  And that is a shame, because it deserves to be recognized.

Ronald Reagan is at his best as an epileptic scientist who seems to be running away from his past but getting nowhere trying. (Mystery)

Viveca Lindfors portrays Reagan's love interest, Ann who eerily hears the voice of her late husband. (Supernatural)

The iconic Broderick Crawford portrays Shawn, a local artist who has in depth discussions with Reagan as to the existence of life after death.  (Philosophical)

Reagan's character, dismayed by his epileptic condition contemplates suicide. (Of course, the epilepsy theme is far dated by today's standards, but this movie is not from today).

The film climaxes in a Hurricane scene w/ all main characters present.  I will not spoil the ending as I urge you to view it yourself and decide.

Sadly, Warners issued this on a DVD-R format.  The picture transfer is good, but the audio level is lacking.  Will sound much better on a home theater system than a standard two speaker TV.

Nevertheless, better to have it available than to not.

Class Dismissed!!!!!",1373414400,5,1121,4.898936170212766
8435974,5,B004MFFB2Q,"I liked this film, I'm a nurse and thought that the topic of epilepsy was treated well by Hollywood...surprisingly.  Nice story.",1359417600,2,128,5.095238095238095
8435975,3,B004MFFB2Q,"Judged by today's standards, the ""Secrets"" hidden between the two romantic leads (Reagan-epilepsy and Lindfors-supernatural romantic feelings for a dead husband) are pretty tame but taken in the context of the late 1940's, I am sure it made for interesting material at that time...  If there is any doubt that Ronald Reagan wasn't a good film actor, those can be put to rest in this film as he turned in a very fine and sensitive performance.  In fact, I have seen several of his films and his performances are at least as good if not better than half the existing Hollywood Actors of today.

This movie contains a real atmospheric setting off the coast of Florida and the grand old house where the story unfolds is just perfectly suited to support the story.  Don Siegel directed this one and in later years, he went on to direct the ""Dirty Harry"" Films with Clint Eastwood among others.

The movie definitely kept my attention (and my wife's as well!)but both of us lamented that the film ended rather suddenly and after so much build up, we did find ourselves expecting a bit more...

All in all, a worthy addition to collectors of Hollywood's Golden Age of Films.",1353110400,4,1167,4.668292682926829
8435976,4,B004MFFB2Q,"Warner Bros. Pictures  presents ""NIGHT UNTO NIGHT"" (1949  84 min/B&W) -- Starring: Ronald Reagan, Viveca Lindfors, Broderick Crawford, Rosemary DeCamp, Osa Massen & Art Baker

Directed by Don Siegel

Based on a novel by Philip Wylie, the film stars Ronald Reagan as John, a young scientist suffering from epilepsy. Viveca Lindfors co-stars as Ann, who is recovering from the loss of her husband. Both John and Ann head to the coast of Florida for rest and relaxation, and it is here that they fall in love. John and Ann must contend with both their individual afflictions and mounting private demons.

Reagan and especially Lindfors are convincing in their difficult roles.

Wonderful soundtrack and original music by Franz Waxman, beautiful black-and-white cinematography by J. Peverell Marley.
