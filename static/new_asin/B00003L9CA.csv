This is a true movie lovers movie,with elements of the classics of days gone by. A Casablanca from a homeless person's perspective. A surrealistic fantasy about frustrated lovers on the fringe of society,and how the rules of engagement are the same for everyone regardless if you have a mansion or you live on the street. Please,someone,preferably Anchor Bay entertainment,get to work on a DVD transfer with 5.1 sound and loads of extras. This film derserves it immensely.",999820800,3,744,5.10655737704918

1331750,5,B00003L9CA,"This movie found me as a first year student of French and since then it has become my all-time favorite. ""Les amants..."" is a long and painfully crafted work that may seem, prima facie, difficult to approach.  Nevertheless, when such apparent difficulty is conquered, you reach the  simple joy of getting to know the work of a superior talent, plenty of  unforgettable moments. Juliette Binoche's face when watching paintings at  the light of a candle. Alex Lavant walking in the Paris metro tunnels,  where Binoche large-sized photos cover the walls. The Seine mirroring their  craziness and light... Images from the movie will haunt you with its  bizarre beauty for long time.  It should also be taken in account that the  story beyond the scenes of the movie is a drama on its own, worth to be  known.",963705600,4,804,4.802919708029197
1331751,5,B00003L9CA,"After Leos Carax's 1986 film Mauvais Sang (come on Miramax release it!) Juliette Binoche begged her then lover and director to never film her as a madonna again, and so the seeds for Les Amants du Pont Neuf were sown.  Mauvais Sang features a luminous and fetishised Juliette Binoche as a mask  like presence, with no physicallity. This was carried thorough to the  wonderful The Unbearable Lightness of Being, but Carax exploded the image  in his film. The story is simple, two down and outs meet fall in love, yet  despite the harsh realities of life, and love, on the streets they live out  an exciting and romantic (in all the senses of the word) existance.  This  movie is relevant for its amazing visual and tour de force performances.  Binoche is simply standout, she seems to live the role, something she later  admitted deeply disturbed her. The film is fabulously directed from the  grainy opening sequence to the amazing fireworks scene and the exilirating  conclusion. The film is littered with cinematic allusions from truffauts  Les Quatre cents Coups, to L'Atlante. In terms of context the film is  amazing because it juxtaposes harsh realities, the opening sequence and  fairytale like fantasy. We are led to question what is actually real, from  Binoche apparerntly committing murder to the street littered with gigantic  litter. In the end Les Amants du Pont Neuf is a film which needs multiple  viewing and some explaining or knowledge of French New Wave cinema to be  wholly comprehended, yet it is cwertainly accessible for the majority of  casual cinema goers! The film, as I always predicted, is only now beginning  to get the recognition it trully deserves.  Binoche has avoided this type  of movie since, although Michael Hanekes wonderful Code Unknown, though on  a smaller and more subjued canvas, has many similarities. Roll on the US  release of that one too. And Miramax, its about time you beagan releaseing  this type of movie on DVD, you're beginning to lag behind the other  companies such as Fox Lorber and Criterion!",962409600,15,2052,4.941348973607038
1331752,4,B00003L9CA,"Obsessive love, all consuming love, love that is blind...all that is possible, even magical, if the lovers live in their own island of reality, isolated by illness and self-rejection (Binoche), by being a social cripple  (Daniel), and joined by need. The beautiful artist running away from her  increasing blindness illuminates the tortured soul of the fire-breather  street urchin. He discovers caring and gentleness as he takes care of her.  Their mutual dependency blossoms into a miraculously beautiful passion  which lasts only till a cure for her illness comes along. Fear of loss  drives him to extremes. They reunite when he comes out and she is cured and  in society again. Or do they reunite only in death as all tragic lovers in  history have been doomed to? The movie reaches for universal depth, but  loses it in falling prey to gauche excesses of visual  scintillation...gorgeous fireworks over Pont Neuf, but irritatingly out of  synch with the point of the movie. Binoche brings her beauty and sparkle to  this role, but it is Daniel who truly pulls at you, building sympathy and  throwing it away moments later, the way those who cannot help themselves  always seem to do.",956880000,4,1189,4.969543147208122
1331753,5,B00003L9CA,This movie has gone from easy to hard. The story is about a almost blind homeless girl played by Juliette Binoche and a homeless fire eater played by Alex Lavant. One day they meet at the bridge Pont-Neuf. Romance builds  up and they fall in love. But living on the street is not easy and this is  what the story is about. I don't want to spoil the plot for those who  hasn't seen the movie. I truly recommend this to anyone familiar with  Juliette Binoche works. A true masterpiece.,950832000,8,483,4.333333333333333

1331772,3,B00003L9CA,"I bought this to replace a VHS in our local French video library.  It's not a bad movie and is interesting in spots.  This was the third or fourth time I've seen it, and I have to admit that I'm clearer on the characters after this viewing.  The film starts with a man who seems stoned out of his mind wandering down a street who then gets hit by a car.  This is witnessed by a raggedy woman who starts to draw him in her portfolio.  We later learn the woman is Juliette Binoche playing an artist going blind, and I frankly don't remember much about the man's background except that he lives on Pont Neuf, currently the oldest bridge in Paris, as it was being renovated in the early 1990s.  The man can sleep only with the aid of drugs, but he lets Binoche stay with him on the bridge.  We slowly learn her past and why she's homeless.  I don't quite buy the ending, so I'm saying this film is only OK.",1406160000,,902,4.14367816091954
1331773,4,B00003L9CA,"Pont Neuf is on the pedestrian route from the famous Gilbert Jeune bookstore, to the Forum Les Halles - a good central point for a visitor to Paris.  The movie is gorgeous, but the expression of it's themes is gritty to say the least.  Binoche is an angry young woman.  And she finds a perfectly suitable partner in crime.  If you come from somewhere near the Wrong Side of the Tracks, you will loveit!",1395187200,,402,4.391891891891892
1331774,5,B00003L9CA,"This is a wonderfully magical, although at times, erratic and unbelievable film.  It starts off as a gritty
depiction of homeless life in Paris then, by turns, it's romantic, sweepingly beautiful, fable-like and nearly tragic.
All the actors are spellbinding as are the visuals of Paris.  Many moments, including the breathtaking sequence
of the lovers speeding down the Seine surrounded by magnificent fireworks; their balletic, drunken dance on
the bridge; his fantastical, gymnastic fire-eating performance are unforgettable.  The bold, passionate choices
of the director and the mesmerizing performances make you believe that even when life seems hopeless,
love is still possible.",1376784000,6,684,5.752475247524752
1331775,3,B00003L9CA,"The film is not fun to watch. It is 'demanding'. The young couple are living in poverty but are pretty feckless. It is rather like a Mike Leigh movie without his humour. However, it is well made - often brilliantly photographed with some spectacular set pieces (fireworks and snow). So, we are glad to have been able to see it.",1360108800,,327,4.466666666666667
1331776,5,B00003L9CA,"I walked into this film blind.  I just saw the title and the actors (named Binoche) and remembered my complete obsession over another French bridge movie (The Girl on the Bridge, from 2000) and just felt this rush of excitement as I sat down to watch this movie.  The funny thing is that this movie is absolutely NOTHING like I expected it to be and yet it was everything I could have ever wanted.  First of all, this is not a sweeping romantic film.  It isn't pretty, in the typical sense (although the cinematography is lush and brilliantly used).  Instead, this is a rather densely broken tale about unexpected lovers who build a life on a bridge under construction.

Upon the film's opening we see Alex, a homeless street performer, collapse in a drunken stupor and get practically run over.  In the same breath, we see Michelle walking through the streets carrying a portfolio of her artwork.  Next thing you know, they are sharing a bridge and concealing secrets and falling in love.  Michelle is suffering from a severe disease that is corroding her eyesight and has obviously wreaked havoc on her life (since it becomes rather obvious early on that she at one time was wealthy) and so now she is living a life of destitution.  Michelle is distant and reserved and obviously shielding herself from affections, but Alex thrusts himself into her life and starts to (rather aggressively) build a relationship with her.  They complement one another and draw each other out in ways that others could not.

But love is never easy, especially if you're homeless.

Binoche and Lavant build very complex characters and develop them thoroughly throughout the film, even without letting us know their pasts entirely (there is still much mystery left to Michelle's past, even at the film's closing).  We feel as though we know them inside and out, and that is a feat in itself.  Really though, this is Leos Carax's story and his film and he carries it marvelously.  The film is visually enriched by sharp cinematography and an understanding of the importance of emotional conveyance through imagery.

This is a love affair that is far removed from what we are used to.  It isn't glamorous or lavish and yet it feels all the more earnest and sincere.  When the film ends, you will most definitely be moved!",1347321600,8,2300,4.762626262626263
1331777,1,B00003L9CA,"This movie starts slowly & drags on from there. There is nothing appealing about this film: even the lovely Juliet Binoche is made up to look horrible most of the time, & at best plain in some of the later scenes. Here's a clue for you: if the best thing that can be said about a film as shown in largest text on the back cover is ""Inspired & original,"" then you know you've got a real loser, since it isn't even ""memorable!"" OMG what a dog: take this thing back out behind the barn & shoot it to put it out of its misery!",1325721600,,522,3.980952380952381
1331778,5,B00003L9CA,"The raw depiction of the homeless greet you in the opening scenes. The child-like down-and-out Alex(Lavant) has made his home on the Pont-Neuf bridge during its temporary closure for reconstruction work. After having his foot run over while he was drunk,he staggers home to meet Michelle(Binoche),sleeping on his usual patch. She's a bourgeois art student,but an eye disease and some trauma from the recent past, has left her on the streets. We know little about the backgrounds or the pasts of either character. The two outsiders form an unlikely emotional attachment,much to the annoyance of Hans(Gruber).Hans' and Alex's features are monstrous, brutalised. Alex has tendencies towards self-mutilation. He also has no identity away from the bridge. There is a dysfunctional family structure,with Hans acting as father,Michelle as mother and sister,taking care of Alex,teaching him how to sleep without drugs and helping his assimilation to the social group. The 2 actors are at their peak.

Against the dazzling technicolour backdrop of Paris by night and the city's bicentennial celebration,sheer ecstasy and joy are visualised,water skiing on the Seine amidst mercury flares and fireworks,Lavant's ritualistic fire-breathing. Alex's excessive physical,violent character is tenderised by Michelle's love, her vulnerability with her degenerative eye condition. She also uses him as an artist's model. Minimalist plot gives free rein to rich visual invention. Les Amants was a grievous production. After Carax had secured a permit to film on the Pont-Neuf while the structure underwent major repairs,it turned into a lengthy and troubled shoot due to an injury to the leading man. Filming was shut down,the permit never to be renewed,the crew moved to a lake in the South of France,where a vast replica of the bridge+ environs had been constructed. Carax said ""I try to be a beginner...I started the film looking for something but not knowing what"".Based on sheer intuition, his adherence to the subject of joy,and his debt to film-making of the silent era,the Chaplinesque poetry of life on the streets. His off-hand grasp of narrative is offset by an astonishing visual style,bringing to a story of romance,the feeling of being in love,drawing emotional impact from an instinctive visual command. The costliest film ever made in France.",1294963200,3,2339,5.443526170798898
1331779,1,B00003L9CA,"This movie is loud, annoying and cliche. It romanticizes poverty and violence. Waterskiing on the Seine, and blind, coughing, limping amore-corniness to the point of pain. And bad acting! The giggling parts were cringe inducing, that and the ""art"". All in all, it made me dump the person who recommended it to me. I know that sounds like it biases me, but really, this and ""Blame it on the Bellboy"" were the two worst movies I have ever seen. .",1259971200,,444,4.5625
1331780,3,B00003L9CA,Interesting film. Its portrayal of homelessness and artistic bohemianism has a ring of authenticity. This is s very different sort of role for Juliette Binoche. It is advantageous to see here attempt something so different from her other work.,1236643200,,243,5.256410256410256
1331781,3,B00003L9CA,"I found this early work of Juliet Binoche to be both intriguing, very credible but a bit over the top. This is a reluctant love story to say the least but the selection of three odd bods as characters to highlight the problems of homelessness in modern urban societies is a very real device indeed.

Viewers may wish to watch this in conjunction with Subway, to gain a little different perspective. I think that the thematic element of art which ties all three together acts to expose the commonly held view of what constitutes art to the test. These disparate group of artists suffer much for their artbut because there is not the popular acclaim they are consigned to the dustbin of history.

What I find particularly interesting is the development of the character of the fireater who performs to free public acclaim but who drowns his personal problems in alcohol and downers. As the film progresses he slowly begins to change into a more ""normal"" type of a person who can express his emotions through interacting with a self-pitying selfish woman who is becoming blind.

There is more than a touch of the surreal throughout the movie and much pathos but within an urban context where there is little consideration for the down and outs such that drivers never even notice them as they drive over them on the street. Is this what modern life has become?

My main reservation is about the happy ending which just seems to be out of place given the storyline. Definitely more substantial than the usual entertainment films but one where the consumer is left wanting more.",1204070400,,1573,4.7299270072992705
1331782,1,B00003L9CA,"Late one night I happened to be flipping through channels with my boyfriend when we stopped at the Independant Film Channel to watch what we thought would be an amusing French movie (The Lovers on the Bridge). We were not intrigued by the dramatic plot the info box on the tv told us, we were rather drawn into the film by the ridiculous plot it had. ""A blind artist falls in love with a homeless man on a bridge in France,"" sounds like a winner, so we left the channel on even though the movie was partly over. Right away we found ourselves watching the silhouettes of a crazed man and woman frolicking loudly upon a beach at night. Did I mention they were naked? Yes all you saw were their silhouettes, but very obviously we could see the man atleast was naked. After that feast for our eyes, we watched as the rest of the movie dragged on, each scene an obvious attempt to push the main characters further into their desperation/drunkeness/hopelessness/homelessness/artistic loneliness. Each new ""twist"" in the plot was ridiculously predicatable and made us say, ""Are you serious? They actually spent money to make this into a movie?"" Finally the ""dark"" movie ends in what is supposed to be a ""happy"" ending but really makes the movie seem even worse as it only shows the recklessness of both characters and doesn't resolve the tension between the characters. It's like the writer of the film had an idea to make a dark artistic story but didn't want a tragic ending as most films of the genre do so he decided to abrubtly end the story and carry both characters away happily in a boat to the middle of no where, out of the story and thankfully now, out of my mind.",1188864000,,1668,4.526490066225166
1331783,3,B00003L9CA,"""Lovers On The Bridge"" is notorious, but not very popular. It caused a big scandal in France, not because of its content, but because of the caprices of its director Leos Carax. Much of the film takes place on the Pont-Neuf bridge in Paris, and Carax demanded to be allowed to film right on the bridge. So, the bridge was closed off just for him, and even then he couldn't finish filming. After he was kicked out, he built a life-size model of the bridge and part of its surroundings, somewhere in the countryside, and tried to finish filming there. Even then he went over budget three times, thus causing three separate producers to go bankrupt.

The film was a complete failure, commercially. Critics thought it was too long and too self-important. The public just didn't bother to see it. As a result, Carax's career was basically over by 1992. Since then he's only made one film, ""Pola X"" in 1999. (There's word that he's making another one right now, though.)

What is ""Lovers On The Bridge"" about? It stars Carax's favourite actor Denis Lavant as Alex, a bum who lives on the Pont-Neuf. Sometimes he puts on a fire-eating act to entertain passersby on the street. The rest of the time, he gets drunk. He's also addicted to pills of some kind.

One day, a woman shows up on the bridge. She doesn't talk about her past, but Alex finds out that she comes from a rich family. She was abandoned by her rich boyfriend, and she has a problem with her eyesight which will eventually make her blind. Because of these problems, she decides to run away from home and go slumming on the Pont-Neuf.

Naturally, Alex falls madly in love with her. They cavort on the bridge together and steal money from rich tourists. Then of course they're separated. Alex does a whole bunch of desperate and stupid things and loses his will to live. Maybe you can guess whether or not they're reunited in the end.

Carax's underlying worldview in this film is exactly the same as in his two earlier films, ""Boy Meets Girl"" and ""Bad Blood."" He believes in a thing called love, you see. But his idea of love has a lot of narcissism in it. His lovers are hopelessly self-absorbed. They can never have any kind of normal life together, simply because they would be unable to support each other. They can get drunk together, but they can't feel so much compassion or empathy. Alex, in particular, is a psychopath. He tries to prevent the woman from curing her eye problem, because he doesn't want her to leave the bridge.

And Carax also believes that the sensory impact of a film is more important than the logic of its narrative. So, this film contains many vivid, visually brilliant scenes that don't make much sense if you think about them. For example, Carax thinks that guns are romantic, so he puts a gun into the film and uses it in a long dream sequence. The sequence doesn't have much bearing on the plot, and actually it makes his heroine look cold and vicious, but it's exciting to watch.

The greatest scene of this sort is the one where the lovers celebrate Bastille Day by screaming and doing cartwheels on the bridge, to a deafening medley of classical, rock and rap music. The content of the scene has no meaning. But the effect is ecstatic. And in a way, it really captures a youthful feeling of falling in love.

If Carax's worldview doesn't appeal to you, then you'll probably agree with the critics who savaged the film. They have a point. But still, ""Lovers On The Bridge"" is Carax's best film.

First of all, he has a much stronger script than before. His two earlier films are full of long, artificial monologues, which are recited into space by the characters. But here, the dialogue is much more terse. Alex doesn't say much at all, and this is very appropriate to his character.

Second, Carax paid attention to the setting of his story. The plot might not be very believable. Of course that's the point. Carax wants to overwhelm the emotions by any means necessary. But nonetheless, the opening of the film just shows a few scenes taken at a homeless shelter in Paris. They are unrelated to the plot, and the main characters don't appear in them. But they make a very strong impression. Carax shows the bad conditions in which his characters live, without making anything up. Somehow, this realistic introduction makes the rest of the film much more convincing.

Third, the romance is just a little bit more subtle than in Carax's earlier films. In ""Bad Blood,"" for instance, it was hard to see why Julie Delpy loved Denis Lavant so much, since his character there was basically the same as here. But here, Carax implies that the heroine isn't quite in love with Alex. Or rather, she is, but only up to a point. She loves him while she's slumming on the bridge, but she doesn't want to take him with her when she leaves. She shows no concern for him when he suffers the most from her absence. She does remember him later, but she only wants to see him on her own terms. In other words, she's like him. That's not very nice, and in fact the main characters of this film are not nice people, but it's believable at least. It's also hard to see why she went down to the bridge in the first place, if she's like that, but that's not really the point. Carax needs the bridge because it allows him to make his grand spectacles.

I honestly don't know if I'd recommend this film. It's alternately unpleasant and thrilling. But it is Carax's best film. There's nothing else that's quite like that.",1156982400,8,5489,4.544534412955466
1331784,5,B00003L9CA,"Proof positive that the French function on an entirely different intellectual plane that their American counterparts. It's sometimes hard to believe that our two cultures inhabit the same planet. Imagine if your only island of sanity and security was an endangered bridge in the midst of one of the world's most exquisite cities. Imagine yourself without love or hope in the center of the most romantic of capitals. Imagine the moist chill as you awaken, hung over, under a sheet of plastic and litter, knowing your day holds nothing but the need to beg and steal to survive, devoid of any hope for salvation. And then imagine it all somehow turning towards a warmer sun... at least for the moment... after a crime you may or may not have committed. Think and feel what that moment would taste like. Binoche is captivating, riveting in a performance of courage and risk, an extraordinary actress by any measure. Paris has never seemed more beautiful, especially when devoid of human traffic in the hours where those from the other side of life wander its streets.

To be fair, my review is based only on the first quarter or so of this film, which was as much as I could stand.  If you -- like me -- have a limited capacity to get down and dirty with psychotic street people living like animals, then you and I are thinking alike.  Obviously many people have watched it and heartily approve.  To me, it is unwatchable.",1095897600,5,464,4.065934065934066

1331787,5,B00003L9CA,"One of the most beautiful films ever made.  Clear proof that Juliette Binoche is one of the (if not the) greatest actresses of the age.  Lacking, perhaps, in subtext or moral complexity - absences which would ordinarily prevent me from branding a film a great work of art, the extraordinary beauty (which I confess brought me to tears during the fireworks sequence,) the brilliant acting, the homages (especially to L'Atlante,) the inexorable progression from despair to hope all lead me to the conclusion that this is one of the greatest films ever made.
I was fortunate enough to see this first in a theatre (the Walter Reed at Lincoln Center) so the full impact of the beauty of the film came through better than would be possible on a home system.  However, I bought the DVD from Amazon UK several years ago and it is well worth owning.
Following Boy Meets Girl (very good) and Mauvais Sang (wonderful,) the followup to Lovers on the Bridge which was Pola X was staggeringly disappointing and undiciplined.  Worth owning largely for Scott Walker's brilliant soundtrack I could only look at it aghast and wonder what happened.
There is nothing even scheduled by Carax in the new ""improved""(?) Amazonified imdb.  We can only hope that he returns with something even approaching having the sense of wonder and intensity of this masterpiece.
Not just worth owning, but utterly mandatory.",1075248000,5,1387,4.910256410256411
1331788,4,B00003L9CA,"Set in the days before and after France's bicentennial, Les Amants du Pont-Neuf tells the story of three homeless people who have been cheated by life.  First is Alex, a street performer who seeks refuge in alcohol and downers.  Hans, an elderly bearded man who bears a resemblance to Jack Elam, provides Alex with the downers.  And then there's Michele, a homeless artist with a bandage over her left eye.  All three proceed to make the Pont-Neuf bridge in Paris their home.  This is possible because the bridge is under repairs and renovation and closed to the public for two years.
Hans though, does not like Michele and repeatedly tells her she must leave.  Alex convinces him to let her stay for a couple days.  A bond develops between the two, and the two share some of that bicentennial magic of fireworks for some heavy drinking and cruising in a police patrol boat, with Michele water-skiing.  However, Michele has periods when she is tired out--she even blacks out when she is drawing Alex.  Turns out she is going blind in her remaining eye.  In contrast, without his downers, Alex can't go to sleep.  Opposites if anything.  Hans detects the feelings Alex has for Michele and tells him ""Look around.  There's no love here!  There's no cold air in bedrooms.  It doesn't fit your life.  Forget it!""  He later tells Michele that life outside is not right for her, and it's up to her to live.
As her condition worsens, Michele tells her that the ""world's just a lot of blurry flames and I'm sick of it.""  That is mirrored in a scene when Alex sets fire to a row of posters along the subway hallways, a great visual effect, as there are posters on both walls, utilizing a symmetry akin to Kubrick.
The bridge symbolizes the stage of life for a person, from point A to point B.  In the beginning, it is in disrepair, under renovation, as are the lives of the three protagonists.  At the end of the movie, the bridge has been renovated.  ""Nothing is irreparable"" Michele tells Alex.  For some people, that may be true, but countless others are damaged beyond repair.
The sequence in the bus carrying the wounded Alex and the scene in the shelter is a very oppressive segment and it's a bit of tough going through due to the characters who seek refuge in the shelter.  And for the leisure pacing of this movie, it's a bit long at near two hours.
Juliette Binoche (Michele) is amazing here because she is not her usual glamorous self.  With the bandage on her eye, pale face, disheveled and fatigued look, she is far from the composer's widow in Blue, the idealistic Tereza in The Unbearable Likeness Of Being, or Vianne in Chocolat.  Denis Divant (Alex) does a good job in bringing to life someone trying to make sense of a new set of circumstances (Michele's arrival).  Good for the main leads, hampered by overlength and depressing atmosphere.",1075075200,5,2849,4.614314115308151
1331789,5,B00003L9CA,"THE LOVERS ON THE BRIDGE is a confusing movie. Director Leos Carax clearly wants the audience to sympathise with the plight of the two stars, Alex, played by Denis Lavant, and Michelle, by Juliette Binoche. As the film begins, the viewer sees that both Alex and Michele suffer from ego-shattering crises. In her case, she suffers from an eye disease that is gradually worsening to a state of total loss of vision. Further, she has just been dumped by her lover.  Totally bereft of hope, she joins the small army of homeless who live on or near Paris's Pont-Neuf Bridge.  Alex suffers too, but Carax chooses not to inform the audience why he has degenerated both physically and mentally.  He wanders the streets near the bridge, drinking cheap wine, stealing food, and generally showing every indication that his life may be measured only in terms of when he can get next that next drink. And then they meet.  As I was watching, I guessed that Alex and Michelle would somehow connect, that they would prop each other up in mutual support. And it is precisely here that Director Carax goes seriously astray.  If his intent were to present the morally uplifting story of two homeless rejects in the context of an artful exploration of love, needs, and values, then his message goes astray in the criminal activities of both Alex and Michelle.  Michelle gets hold of a pistol, visits her former lover, begs him to let her enter his apartment, and when he refuses,she shoots him through the door's peephole. He dies, and she is exultant.  He may have been a rotter for breaking her heart, but society cannot exist when this sort of thing goes unpunished. As gruesome as her crime is, Alex's corruption is far greater.  He learns of her eye disease by reading a series of posters glued prominently through a long winding tunnel leading to the bridge. He chooses not to tell her that an eye surgeon might cure her. He prefers to keep her dependent on him.  He shows his true needy and controlling nature by striking her on several occasions.  He ultimately refuses to accept her decision to leave him, thereby re-enacting the same scenario that caused her to kill her lover in the first place.  He grabs her and both fall into the river in an attempt that can only be considered as a potential murder-suicide. And this is after his earlier torching of a man whose only crime has been to glue those posters of her eye disease onto Paris walls.
  It was difficult for me to see these lovers in the positive light that Carax surely intended.  Much of the film involves incredible use of sight and sound that elevates Alex and Michelle to the status of Romeo and Juliet.  He the acrobat, she the artist. As the eye is dazzled by a masterly use of firework pyrotechnics and the ear is deceived by the superficial mutual protestations of love, the critical faculties of the viewer that ought to form the moral center of any audience is tempted to overlook the clearly criminal tendencies of two people who care not a fig for the deaths of others, nor for each other, nor for themselves. By the film's end, I simply could not accept their reconciliation of a happy ending.
  In movies like this, I would have vastly preferred to see the protagonists come to recognize the consequences of their actions as they ponder where they came from before they can so blithely find solace in an ending that suggests that the only conclusion to a romance based on disease and loathing must result in no hard-won self-awareness at all.",1023580800,11,3508,4.650485436893204
1331790,2,B00003L9CA,"I am amused that no one yet wrote something less complimentary about this picture.  It does begin interesting, proceeds Ok but then things start to creep.  Does her lover really love her?  To me, he is a dangerous psycho and he does not stop at hurting her by keeping her uninformed.  Wouldn't we judge someone like that as a heartless and cruel criminal?  Why all this sobbing that he really loved her? Do we indeed imagine this as a true love story?  And then at the end, like it wasn't enough suffering and beating for her, he almost drowns her and then both become happy and serene and rejoice in their escape.  This is hardly a role-model romance, a perfect case of male rage, obsessiveness and violence - what is it to admire?  In the very least, it is an expression of a really barbaric, brutal and animalistic instinct of male ownership over a woman.  Perfect case of abuse - I wonder how all who marvel at this film would feel if they've been knocked into the river Seine in the middle of winter as an expression of their sweetheart's love for them...  Love - no, sorry, this is absurd.  In addition, the ""lover"" does seem to be mentally retarded and in my opinion, is not an attractive personality in the very least.  But even if he was attractive...  It puzzles me that there are always people who would admire the most gruesome behavior by confusing it with love - didn't he know that she desired to get her sight back, more than anything in the world?  Would not real lover do anything to satisfy her desire, to help her get it back, even if it meant breaking up with him?  That what true love really is.  And for her part - thanks for portraying again a woman who enjoys being abused. I find the story rather ...non-convincing, although the acting is good.  Another example of French cinema being in a serious trouble when there is nothing more to say...Where are all good times of Eric Rohmer?",1003104000,8,1908,4.452449567723343
