7373770,5,B013VYHKJ0,Excellent Movie. WORTH WAITING 5 YEARS FOR!,1446508800,,43,5.285714285714286
7373771,4,B013VYHKJ0,"I saw this movie and I really enjoyed it. It is crazy and fun while at the same time relevant, but your seeing this movie mainly for laughs. If you are a fan of show then this DVD won't disappoint it is worth it I am glad Regular Show is still fresh usually movies and hype will kill a great show.",1445904000,,297,3.8852459016393444
7373772,5,B013VYHKJ0,"A movie is big name to live up to. There are many different kinds of movies as well. With that, It would be unfair to compare this to a full 2 hour movie as it runs just under 70 minutes. However, this is not a bad thing.  This movie plays out like a very large Regular Show episode but with all the action, suspense and even emotion as a cenematic theatrical release. I usually take suspicion to direct-to-video movies but Regular Show nailed this one. After the opening cenematic, the movie starts out like any Regular Show episode: just regular. But then gets more surreal and immersive as it continues. It's a time traveler story and is well written. Any Regular Show fan will be very satisfied! Also, the audio on the disc is encoded with true 5.1 surround. It's a nice touch since pretty much all other CN DVD collection/season releases are in only 2.0ooooooh!",1445731200,9,866,4.551282051282051
7373773,5,B013VYHKJ0,"Because REGULAR SHOW is a slice-of-life comedy taking place in an absurd and distorted version of everyday reality, the crash landing of a spaceship from the future is only slightly out of the ordinary for these characters. This movie is a bromance in science fiction epic clothing, and it packs an emotional punch by stretching Mordo and Riggs's friendship to the breaking point. One lie snowballs into a lifetime of bad decisions, and that's the real story here; the plot, wittily summarized on the back cover as ""Save the universe from yourselves, or you're fired!"" is almost irrelevant.

It's a very funny movie, but it's a shame that Warners has better things to do than release full seasons of REGULAR SHOW on disc.",1443830400,5,721,4.861788617886178
7373774,5,B013VYHKJ0,Can't wait for the all new movie to come out. I enjoy watching it and so does my family.,1443571200,,88,3.6842105263157894
7373775,5,B013VYHKJ0,"We're is season 4 already, and also buy the movie of course",1442534400,,59,4.0
7373776,3,B013VYHKJ0,"One of the biggest events in this show's history (a feature length movie) and CN can't pony up the cash for a blu ray title? It is in it's seventh season - which is very impressive for most shows, let alone an animated one. It's a real shame I won't be able to own a HD version of this film since animation really pops in high def. I can maybe understand not putting the seasons on blu ray anymore, but not having the movie in BR is just plain silly.

In regards to the movie, it was honestly pretty weak. Time travel movies are really hard to do right, what with paradoxes practically impossible to avoid. It is best to try and not dwell to much on the rules of time travel if you want to enjoy this movie. I think the space duck special was better than this. That story could have been great for a movie format. It's nice that there was no romance subplot, and it just kept with Mordecai and Rigby.

I would recommend this to only the biggest fans of the series.",1442448000,3,964,4.149732620320855

Just a note though: it MIGHT just be my dvd player or my particular dvd copy, but the sound on it unfortunately seems less-than-pristine. But the bonus features are great and are definitely worth it!",1452816000,2,358,4.343283582089552

8728950,4,B013VYHKJ0,"The product info claims that the movie is in widescreen, but that's not exactly true. It's actually presented in 14:9 aspect ratio, letterboxed in a 4:3 frame. If you want to see it in ""proper"" widescreen you need to use your TV's remote control to zoom in, assuming it has that function, which reduces the picture sharpness. Just why this couldn't have been presented as a 14:9 window on a full anamorphic 16:9 frame, with black bars at the sides, is completely beyond me.",1468627200,,473,4.642857142857143
