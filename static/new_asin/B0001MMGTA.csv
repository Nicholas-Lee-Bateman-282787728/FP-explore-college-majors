8014759,4,B0001MMGTA,"Modern Warfare is a must have for anyone interested in 20th Century conflict. The series, produced by the British news agency ITN, covers all the major wars after WWII including Korea, Vietnam, the Arab-Israeli Wars of 1967, 1973, and 1982, the Russian war in Afghanistan, the Iran-Iraq War, the Falklands War, and the Persian Gulf War of 1991. Special Forces and Terrorism are also covered. The episodes about Korea and Vietnam were lackluster, not nearly as detailed as other documentaries I've seen, but the episodes about the Arab-Israeli Wars featured some etraordinary rare footage. The episode about the Iran-Iraq War is the crown jewel, featuring extremely rare footage and an in-depth account of that conflict you won't find in any other documentary ever made. If for any other reason, this DVD set should be bought for its uniqueness. Modern Warfare is a unique historical archive to be viewed by anyone who wants to see what war is like.",1351296000,,948,5.006329113924051
8014760,5,B0001MMGTA,"My favourite war documentary it is packed with real life footage from wars explaining the events from a neutral standpoint. Unlike your typical dramatised History channel/modern documentary it lists the facts in an informative way.

Great documentary. Fantastic. Check out the Iran-Iraq war documentary on youtube which is (arguably) the best one from the bunch.",1280534400,,362,5.581818181818182
8014761,5,B0001MMGTA,This box set was exactly what I was looking for.  It was hard to find through normal box stores.  All the DVDs were brand new in their original wrapping.  The service was great.,1259193600,,177,4.303030303030303
8014762,5,B0001MMGTA,"Don't know what the other reviewer is complaining about.  You can't expect in depth coverage in a forty minute show.  These are actually better put together than your average History channel documentary[fewer talking heads, more combat footage as opposed to reenactments}.  Since this is British, it doesn't consist of the same old footage you've seen a million times and the footage is incredible.  A must for military history buffs.",1171152000,2,434,5.246376811594203
