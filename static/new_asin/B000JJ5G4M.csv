2671819,4,B000JJ5G4M,I had never heard of this movie previously and ran across it while searching the Internet for movies that might interest me. It is a very nice story and well acted. The Special Features included on the DVD were interesting and informative. I would certainly suggest it to anyone.,1274054400,,279,4.714285714285714
2671820,4,B000JJ5G4M,"Buy or rent the movie! Anyone who lived in or grew-up the Sheepshead Bay/Gerritsen Beach area of Brooklyn will find this a genuine treat...and a good film, as well. A good story about real people, shot on location at the real Jorden's Lobster House on Knapp Street, in what is considered by many a 'rural' area of Brooklyn, it depicts the life of a family-owned several generations wholesale lobster business and the sorrow and pain of the encrouching real estate values escalation, with all its unfeeling consequences.

A fine cast of professional actors, several of whom have Brooklyn in their blood, make the film tug at you in the right areas. The reality of the characters trying to untangle and preserve their own lives and and see their hands-on business move innto the future is well written, acted and directed.

It was especially touching to me since my young nephew used to work there during his high school years. He was killed in World Trade Center Tradedy and the film was dedicated to his memory; although he was not part of the story. In truth, his own story is a glimpse of growing up in Brooklyn under tough circumstances, in a difficult family situation, and yet becoming an exceptional human being. It has all the qualities only a true story can present. Brooklyn has that way about it...unlike any place else in the world.",1231718400,4,1343,4.735042735042735
2671821,5,B000JJ5G4M,this is a must for baby boomers from Brooklyn.  the movie is packed with nostalgia for the old days in Sheepshead Bay.  Danny Aiello shines and the movie holds your attention.  Do yourself a favor and check this one out,1224028800,2,219,4.425
2671822,3,B000JJ5G4M,"i watched this film recently about a restaurant that is on the verge of going down because of fast food business's coming in and other factors at work. Danny Aiello plays the same cliche fired up role that he is known for over the years.  it is a intense drama from start to finish that is a decent film,but is missing that knock out performance to make this film stronger. it was pretty good film and it is a seasonal christmas time picture. it deals with loss and family. interesting film.",1185840000,7,491,4.395604395604396
2671823,4,B000JJ5G4M,"Three generations of the Giorgio family have been in the lobster business in Brooklyn.  When the bank that had their restaurant renovation loan went under, the FDIC insisted on immediate payment--if not the place goes up for auction.

Oh yeah, and it's Christmas.

It's a great tale of a long-time family that struggles and survives, keeping their fight, their ingenuity and their sense of humor.",1179619200,3,396,5.061538461538461
2671824,4,B000JJ5G4M,"BROOKLYN LOBSTER is a fine little low budget film that boasts a good story (based on fact) written and directed By Kevin Jordan, an excellent low key cast, and enough family love to satisfy just about everybody's need for feel good movies.

Giorgio's Lobster Farm has been in the Giorgio family for years and has recently come on hard times: the bank defaulted on the note held by the business and the business faces foreclosure - and even worse, it will be auctioned off, removing it permanently from the family.  Frank Giorgio (Danny Aiello) is trying to keep his business alive, neglecting his wife Maureen (Jane Curtin) who is tired of living with the crustaceans, and depending on his daughter Lauren (Marisa Ryan) to be his computer, and trying to convince his son Michael (Daniel Sauli) to return to New York from his home in Seattle to help run the business.  Michael's steady girlfriend Kerry (Heather Burns) supports the concept of saving the business but when her family gets involved an incident occurs which damages all concerned.  How Frank's close friend Bill Lau (Henry Yuk) and wife Jen (Jo Yang) step into the failing picture builds to a climax that demonstrates how family, love, extended family, friends, and perseverance can heal just about anything!

The cast is excellent with Danny Aiello, Jane Curtin and Daniel Sauli especially fine.  But the overwhelming result of this little film is a restoration of faith in the human spirit - with a lot of help from family and friends. Grady Harp, March 07",1173744000,2,1521,4.853281853281853
2671825,5,B000JJ5G4M,"Brooklyn is my childhood home and ""Jordons Lobster"" (The Real Name For The Lobster Store In The Movie) was a place I frequented with my family.  For this reason the movie peaked my interest enough to watch it.  ""Brooklyn Lobster"" is the story of a family business on the brink of bankruptcy.  The story revolves around the families struggle to save the family business.  The movie is truly a great story with excellent acting and a heart touching ending.  Give this movie a try for something a little different.  I am giving this 5 stars because I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1169337600,20,570,4.65
2671826,5,B000JJ5G4M,"First I just have to say it's interesting how some movies make it to wide distribution and fame, even the ""art house"" flicks, and yet others, never seem to get the exposure they deserve.

Brooklyn Lobster never got the chance to be seen by many, and this is a true gem of a movie.
Danny Aiello and Jane Curtain expertly play a long married couple drifting apart while the family business hangs in the balance. One of Brooklyn's last Lobster Pounds is threatended by a bank failure, and
Mr. Aiello's character isn't too sure what plan of action to take.  Their son returns for the Holidays with his girlfriend, who is clearly from a more upscale family. The son is very ambivilent about a possible move back home, and he questions his relationship, just as his mother is trying to define hers. This movie also receives kudos for not portraying the family as being dysfunctional.  The dysfunctional family has managed to become as old a movie cliche as they come. Here we have a pretty normal family coming to terms with everything from coming of age, to coming of old age.

In this movie we see not only the older generation struggle against a changing society, but the younger ones as well. The best of parents can pass down their values, their businesses and more to their children, but sometimes the world has other plans. The times continue to change, even in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn.

2671827,4,B000JJ5G4M,"During most of the twentieth century, you could go down to Sheepshead Bay (on the waterfront) in Brooklyn and get a terrific lobster or fish dinner
for a song.  These lobster shacks are disappearing with the onslaught of Trader Joes, Long John Silvers, and other franchises which replace fresh food with fast food.  Danny Aiello plays a hard nosed, hard working businessman whose family has been in the lobster business in Brooklyn for 60 years. He's fighting for his livelihood - looking for a way to escape Big Money. Due to the fact that the local Bank which financed the Lobster House has ""itself"" defaulted with the FDIC, his small-business loan has been called and his business, his family, his workers, and his identity are all up for sale.

Throughout the movie we cheer for this American because he represents the human qualities of courage, endurance, and self-reliance that make America great...but this fellow and his business are on the auction block.  We will wait and see if it can be saved.  (As a metaphor, a broken water line that supplies sea water to his crustaceans is fixed at the last minute.)  For a glimpse of American life that we don't want to forget,  I recommend this film...it is definitely worth a trip to the video store.",1167955200,35,1253,4.746543778801843
2671828,5,B000JJ5G4M,"A hard-nosed father, played by Danny Aiello, tries to revive his business - and ultimately his family - from an uncertain future as a result of a failed bank loan.  Brooklyn Lobster is a fantastic character study of the differences and hardships faced by members of family pushed into financial turmoil. The movie brings to life the conflicting values and personality traits that are ever-present in families today.  Jordan manages to dive deep into each character and give us a better understanding of their relationships with each other, and in the end the overall identity of the family itself.  Still, more importantly it represents the hardworking middle-class business owner's identity in a changing society - one that is dominated by the franchise corporations and the ""biggest buck"" mentality.",1166054400,17,801,5.2421875

I really liked the subject matter and the conflict, but it was presented in such a non-climactic way that I was bored out of my mind.  The acting was good, the directing was good in ways of use of color and background, also maybe symbolism.  But like I said, it was just a boring movie.  I'm disappointed I chose it.

2671877,5,B000JJ5G4M,"Brooklin Lobster is the kind of movie you should watch when you feel as if the world doesn't care what you're going through. Danny Aiello gives an amazing performance as Frank Giorgio, the owner/operator of a family lobster business. Jane Curtain and Daniel Sauli play his wife Maureen and his son Micheal. Both actors gave understated performances only adding to delicate situation between them and Frank. When the bank that loaned them the money for the lobster farm closes Frank refuses help from those around him prefering to solve the situation on his own. He manages to get several extensions from the court to prevent the bank from auctioning off his business but when the ploys finally run out he is forced to sit while strangers bid on his life's work.
