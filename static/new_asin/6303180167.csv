7840445,3,6303180167,"This tape has a two-mile indoor walk and a toning section.
The 1st mile is easy to follow & gets my heart-rate up & ready for the 2nd mile. The 2nd mile, however, has cheesy Latin dance moves (cha-cha-cha in a figure eight) & pretend athletic moves (pretend swimming, pretend tennis, pretend basketball).
There is little cueing of the moves and Austin changes steps quickly without any preparation for the new moves so it takes several viewings to figure out where to step.
The last section addresses toning of legs & abs. There are multiple lunges in this section so it targets the quads. This section is good for teaching how to target specific areas in the legs and abs. The only thing missing from this section is armwork.
I got this tape because I thought it would be similar to Leslie Sansone's ""Walk Away the Pounds"" tapes, only more rigorous. I'm disappointed because the steps are not very athletic (very dancy) in the 2nd mile. I had a hard time keeping up without laughing (good for my abs!). There's a section where you have to pretend you're walking in high heels, swinging your hips from side to side. I felt pretty silly sashaying around the room in that section.
I would not recommend this tape. I will be giving it to my 10-year-old niece to 'pretend' dance.",1034812800,6,1275,4.5964912280701755
