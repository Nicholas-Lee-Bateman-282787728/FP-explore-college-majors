2452680,5,B000C3L2SE,"""See This Movie"" is a very funny film. If you like the work of

Christopher Guest (ie: ""Best In Show"", ""Waiting For Guffman"", etc.) you

will love this movie. A great premise (two bumbling, if well

intentioned guys, try and make a film on the fly in time for the

prestigious Toronto International Film Festival), hysterical acting

(particularly from John Cho of ""Harold And Kumar Go To White Castle""),

good direction and a cool look make this an indie flick well worth

one's attention. If you're looking for a funny and touching little

movie I would recommend that you (you saw this coming) ""See This

Movie.""",1139961600,3,615,4.726415094339623
2452681,5,B000C3L2SE,"Seth Meyers (SNL) and John Cho (American Pie, Harold & Kumar) make a great comic duo as wannabe filmmakers who bluff their way into a big festival without actually having made a movie.  Meyers and Cho keep the laughs coming, as do terrific performances from the other actors including Jim Piddock, Jessalyn Gilsig, Jessica Par&eacute;, and cameos from writer/directors Chris & Paul Weitz (American Pie), Miguel Arteta, and comedian Patton Oswalt. If you like to laugh... See This Movie.",1139184000,3,486,5.151898734177215
2452682,5,B000C3L2SE,"Saw this at a festival and really thought it was a great slap in the face to the festival system that Hollywood uses to seek exciting independent movies. John Cho (Harold & Kumar) and Jim Piddock (Best In Show) both deliver strong comedic performances in this ""mockumentary"" within a ""mockumentary."" And we even get a delightful performance from Jessica Par&eacute;, (Courtney on Jack & Bobby) who starred in another classic mockumentary, Stardom. Seth Meyers (SNL) stars with Jessalyn Gilsig (Nip/Tuck) and others. Wildy independent, very guerilla, and very funny!",1136851200,5,565,5.359550561797753

2452704,1,B000C3L2SE,"Watched about 10 minutes of it. I like Seth Meyers, but this was just too awful.",1425081600,,80,4.0625
2452705,5,B000C3L2SE,"See This Movie is a send-up of something so hilariously pretentious that it appears to be a documentary! The 3-day film school put me in mind of Ted Baxter's Famous Broadcaster's School! More outrageously, ""Dov Simens TWO DAY Film School"" is something that actually does operate in Hollywood. On his Facebook page, Dov Simens claims to have ""launched the careers of Quentin Tarantino, Spike Lee, Kevin Smith, Queen Latifah, Guy Ritchie & more."" Not bad for two days of study!

If you're a fan of Waiting for Guffman, definitely give See This Movie a try! Highly recommended for fans of cult movies.",1420761600,,598,4.862745098039215
2452706,1,B000C3L2SE,seems pretty pointless,1420156800,,22,6.666666666666667
2452707,4,B000C3L2SE,this is early work and plot is slim and story gets distracted but give it a watch has some decent people and you are wanting to sit on the couch anyway. This is not high tech special effects. This is not sex. This is not chic nor man flick. It is just entertainment. enjoy.,1413244800,,273,4.074074074074074
2452708,5,B000C3L2SE,This movie is just great! The acting is real and if you love SNL's weekend update anchor Seth Meyers you will love this. The shipping was great and easy to deal with! What are you waiting for get some more seth,1388448000,,210,4.146341463414634
2452709,5,B000C3L2SE,This is a hilarious satire.  My daughter was pursuing film studies and said she didn't like it because it was way too representative of what she saw in her colleagues.,1366675200,,167,4.566666666666666
2452710,1,B000C3L2SE,"This is one of the worst movies I've seen. It's only not worse than ""Date Movie"" because it's not epically unfunny (it doesn't take a crack at being humorous...I don't think?). It's uninteresting and doesn't make sense. The plot, what is it? The resolution? Seth Meyers is still hot as hell but I wouldn't be surprised if this sucky movie took home a couple Razzies.",1251331200,,366,4.6461538461538465
2452711,4,B000C3L2SE,"I ordered this not knowing what to expect, and it was better than I thought it was going to be. It's very different---but very funny.",1242086400,,133,4.36
2452712,2,B000C3L2SE,"More like 2 1/2 out of 2 stars...why won't you let me rate it that Amazon?! Anyway onto the movie called ""See This Movie"" where Jake Barrymore, played by Seth Meyers (SNL, upcoming American Dreamz) graduated from his film class and decides to make a movie in which there is no movie yet and in which he goes to the Montreal Film Festival where his ex-girly girl Annie, played by Jessalyn Gilsig (Nip/Tuck, Boston Public) happens to work. He and his friend Larry, played by John Cho (Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle, American Pie movies) swindle their way into the festival and their film...the film doesnt excist yet. Martin, played by the wonderful Jim Piddock (Best in Show, A Mighty Wind) is Jake's film school teacher and who also is going to edit the film...if one becomes one. Jake casts the movie with actors (actors I wouldnt wanna put in my film if I made one). Jake writes the script as the story progresses which is basically moments that have happened in the movie he just happens to shape and form them differently in the movie. Meyers is funny some of the time but his character becomes annoying as the movie progresses. Cho comes off the better of the two and Piddock is hilarious playing the Bisexual Martin. Also starring Patton Oswalt (Blade: Trinity, Failure To Launch), Jessica Pare (Lost & Delirious, Wicker Park) and Paul and Chris Weitz (Chuck & Buck, forgot which one played the man who Jake thought was Wim Wenders...funny scene by the way). 2 1/2 like I said...not a bad movie but has its flaws here and there. Surely worth a look for movie buffs",1143417600,3,1576,4.592198581560283

8095561,3,B000C3L2SE,I really like Seth Meyers that's why I decided to watch this movie however it's clearly a movie from when he started his career because I lost interest in the middle of the movie that's why I'm giving 3 stars because I'm not sure if the movie got any better from the point I stopped.,1433808000,,283,4.163636363636364
