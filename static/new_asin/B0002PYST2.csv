2113110,1,B0002PYST2,"Has Hollywood ran out of ideas? Garfield was an ok comic strip at best. You couldn't pay me enough to sit through this garbage. Do the people who make these movies think that we are all dumb? i know it's a kids movie, I hope its a kids movie, but there are so many much better movies out there for kids like shrek 2. This is not going to be entertainment. This is going to be a 90 minute or less lobotomy.",1085356800,,405,3.951219512195122
2113111,1,B0002PYST2,"Okay, so they got Bill Murray to replace Lorenzo Music as the voice of Garfield. That's not my beef with this movie. Considering that Lorenzo always was just a cheap substitute for Bill Murray anyway (think of the Ghostbusters cartoon series), and considering that he's dead now, this is not really such a big deal.
The problem also does not lie in their choice of what to do with CGI and what to do with live-action. In the comic/cartoon, Garfield looked more or less like an actual cat, while Odie looked more like a boot with legs than like a dog; this apparently did not stop the movie's creators from counterintuitively doing Garfield in CGI and Odie as a real dog. However, such a tremendous lapse in logic is perfectly understandable, since the movie's creators have probably never actually seen the comic/cartoon, as evidenced by Garfield's lack of black stripes.
No, the problem with this movie lies deeper. Like everyone else, I loved the Garfield comics and cartoons. But this movie is the epitome of everything that I've come to hate about hollywood: the rampant abuse of CGI that is plaguing the industry, and the recent habit of making live-action movies of things that should NEVER be seen in live-action format (think Inspector Gadget, Mr. Magoo, George of the Jungle, Scooby Doo 1 and 2, Dennis the Menace, Super Dave, the very shortly-lived The Tick series, etc.)
The only movie more fundamentally wrong than this would be a live-action Bobby's World or Ren and Stimpy. No wait, Howie Mandel is still alive to do the voice of a CGI Bobby Generick, so that would be only slightly less wrong. I would have also suggested a live-action Earthworm Jim, except that a live-action Earthworm Jim would actually be pretty dang cool...
Over and out.",1079740800,10,1757,4.801980198019802
2113112,5,B0002PYST2,"and this movie looks great. It has a lot of amazing details, and even a little odie!!! The cat looks amazing, I think this is going to be better than ""Cat in the Hat"" it is all CGI, but i think that from what i have seen this movie will be a huge blockbuster. It would be a great movie for the family.
there is a part that they have been showing of  Garfield dancing around and he looks just like that famous cat. Jennifer Love looks to be trying too hard, but we will see.

We were trying to get it to come up on our tv and couldn't -- then I thought I could get it on my phone and cast to the tv.  it had me download it but I couldn't ""cast"" it.  Then we saw something about trying to hook up my phone to the hdmi on the tv but couldn't figure out how to do that.  Then my husband DID manage to get the fire stick to bring up amazon on the tv and decided to rent it thru there.  However, it wouldn't complete the purchase.....so we have not managed to be able to watch the movie - we have guests and were trying to watch while they were here.

2113145,5,B0002PYST2,"I understand if you dislike this movie. I have found this film to be a blast. For one, Garfield was a pleasure as I was growing up, being a Garfield fan for a while, I have never heard of this movie until 2010 when I have gotten a DVD of this movie from WalMart, I haven't sat down and watched the whole film, that was until mid-April, when I have ordered this product on VHS, one reason I got this is I am a VHS collector, after viewing it, I have became an instant Garfield fan. Thus stating, I have made this my most favorite film I've seen, next to Storks, Nine Lives (2016), Zootopia & Inside Out (2015). I can tell you, Garfield fan or not, I recommend this film if you're planning on watching it, you'll like it, but not as much as I did.",1492992000,3,745,4.074829931972789

Parked on a comfortable chair in front of the television, feasting on his favourite dish, lasagna, and hurling insults at his beleaguered owner Jon, Garfield is the master of his universe. When Jon takes Garfield to visit beautiful veterinarian Liz Wilson, she gives Jon a pepped-up, tail-wagging, panting creature that represents everything that Garfield loathes. Garfield, meet Odie, a lovable, dim-witted dog. The wise-cracking cat is, for the first time in his nine lives, left speechless. The clueless Odie chases his tail till he's dizzy, crashes into walls, and barks without cause, all to the unbridled delight of Jon who eagerly welcomes Odie into his home. Odie turns Garfield's perfect world upside down. Garfield's solution: OUT, DARN DOG. When the hapless hound disappears into the evil clutches of local celebrity Happy Chapman, you would think Garfield would rejoice. But he feels responsible for the fate of another. With uncharacteristic energy, courage and selflessness, Garfield manages to pull himself away from his lazy life and spring into action. He's on the unlikeliest of impossible missions: to save Odie.",1473206400,2,1199,5.451612903225806

It wasn't as horrible as I expected it to be, but it still wasn't entertaining or enjoyable.  The story-line was boring.  Garfield was animated but all the other animals were real animals.  The movie dog version of Oddie didn't even look like the yellow one in the cartoons when I was a kid.  They had some random white dog play that role.  It seemed as though it was too expensive/too much work to animate Oddie too???  My kids thought it was ok enough.

2113340,2,B0002PYST2,"As a kid, I read the comics religiously.  And Garfield was a favorite back then.  I just loved this sarcastic, self-centered, lazy cat.  So I always intended to see Garfield: The Movie.  Somehow, I never got around to it until I caught it on TV.  Yep, free was the right price.

Garfield (voiced by Bill Murray) has it made.  As Jon's (Breckin Meyer) only pet, the cat can get away with just about anything.  Sleeping late?  Check.  Eating all of Jon's lasagna while leaving Jon his cat food?  Check.  And he never even has to leave their street.

All that changes on one of their frequent trips to veterinarian Liz (Jennifer Love Hewitt).  Jon has been in love with Liz since high school.  He goes fully intending to finally ask Liz out on a date, but instead comes home with a new dog named Odie.  Garfield doesn't like the encroacher on his kingdom.  It's even worse that this is a dumb mutt.  But when Odie goes missing, Garfield decides he must go on a rescue trip.  Can he do it?

Probably because the title character is so iconic, the producers made Garfield a computer animated character while everything else, even the other animals, are live action.  As a result, Garfield is the only thing that looks like his comic strip counterpart.  All the effects worked quite well, however.

The first few minutes of the movie were pretty true to the strip.  I was smiling as characters and things I hadn't thought of in years came back to me.  I mean, the first line of the movie is ""I Hate Mondays,"" a recurring quote from the strip.

But as the story starts to get going, the movie falls apart.  The movie wasn't really that funny.  Maybe Garfield's sarcasm and pessimism work better in small doses.  But I love that stuff, so I have a feeling the jokes were just falling flat.

Furthermore, the story was by the number predictable.  If I were enjoying it, I might not have cared.  But since I was already bored with things, I just sat there waiting for the movie to end.

And I never could get past the Jon/Liz relationship.  In this movie, the attraction is mutual.  In the strip, Liz can't stand Jon.  I was willing to overlook some of the other differences, but that's a pretty major one.

I'm not faulting the cast for any of this.  They all do a fine job.  But you can't make a non-funny script funny no matter how talented you are.  I was actually surprised to see several well known names voicing the animals.  People like Alan Cumming, Brad Garrett, Debra Messing, and Richard Kind voice characters here.  I've heard there was some debate about Bill Murray as Garfield.  Personally, I thought he was perfect in the part.

The few moments that put a smile on my face weren't enough to make the movie worth watching.  Instead of seeing Garfield: The Movie, find one of the comic strip collections.  You'll have a much better time.",1430697600,,2840,4.501968503937008

Okay so after watching it I can say It wasn't true to the comic.  Jon is not as much of an idiot, he gets the girl in the end and he lives in a nice house instead of a broken down place with ripped up furniture!!
However, being untrue to the comic did not make it terrible, just the oposite in fact I love it!!  I love who they picked to play my charactures and Nermal was great even though in the comic he is a striped grey kitty and they made him a slightly unintellegant siamese.

2113423,3,B0002PYST2,"Garfield The Movie(2004) is breezy, fun. Bill Murray is great as the voice of Garfield. Then again, this is watered down Garfield. Most of the dry, sardonic humor is gone and Jon Arbuckle is portrayed as a nice guy with nice clothes. In the comics and Garfield and Friends(1988-1993), Jon Arbuckle wore ugly clothes and he had problems talking to women. The filmmakers used a flesh and blood dog to play Odie and a CGI actor for Garfield. In the film, a crooked TV show host takes Odie hostage and keeps him under control with a shock collar! Garfield risks his life to save Odie. The film is a loose remake of an early Garfield TV special where Garfield and Odie are trapped in an animal shelter. The film has a couple of inspired gags. Garfield ends up splattering on a car window when a driver slams on his car brakes! This is a reference to 1980's plush Garfield toys in people's cars.

After becoming a parent I was surprised how many children movies have dark scary characters or contain scenes with fighting or hitting. I also like the theme of accepting the newcomer Odie as part of the family. It's a good lesson for families who may be expecting a new child.

Bill Murray(Groundhog Day) does a wonderful job providing the voice of Garfield(replacing the late Lorenzo Music, who passed away in 2001), who is enjoying the life of a lazy cat who eats a lot and drive Jon Arbuckle(Breckin Meyer, Franklin and Bash)crazy. But when Jon adopts a lovable but stupid dog named Odie, it incurred Garfield's wrath, and when an evil TV celebrity steals Odie, it's up to Garfield to save the day. Jennifer Love Hewitt(Ghost Whisperer) also stars in this excellent family comedy. This 2-disc DVD has plenty of special features including a detailed history of Garfield, interviews with Jim Davis and the cast and crew of the film, and an Ice Age short featuring Scrat that is very funny.

The basic premise is that Garfield lives with Jon and he is a fat lazy cat, no surprise. Jon has been taking Garfield to the vat a lot so he can flirt with the veterinarian, Liz (played by the ALWAYS gorgeous Jennifer Love Hewitt). Liz needs to find a home to a less than intelligent dog, Odie. Garfield gets very jealous of Odie and eventually locks Odie out. Well, Odie runs away and Garfield feels bad. Liz & John (who of course are developing a relationship) go out searching for the two animals. All the while, Garfield knows who has kidnapped Odie (a deranged pet performer who saw Odie dance at a dog show) is chasing after Odie. The chase ends up at the train station and a cat at the controls. Good, clean fun.

Overall, as I said, a good flick. I don't know that I would buy it or see it again, but I was glad to rent it. The chase story reminded me a lot of Toy Story 2, but that is okay. If you liked the comic, I think you will like the movie. The most interesting thing is that we learn that Jon can not hear Garfield.

Garfield brings some much needed sass to the big screen.  And I'm glad he's animated, because that means he won't have any dander (I'm allergic to cats).  Just kidding!!  (get it?  even if it was a real cat, it would be on the movie screen, so I wouldn't be allergic. it wouldn't matter if he was computer generated or real!)

2113536,4,B0002PYST2,"Bill Murray stars as the voice of Garfield in this live action/CGI film based on the famous Jim Davis comic strip. The only CGI animation in the movie is the character of Garfield, which might sound a little odd but works very well within the context of the film. The plot revolves around the cynical and self-centered Garfield, whose whole world is turned upside down when his owner Jon (Breckin Meyer) adopts a new pet: Odie, a loveable but somewhat dense doggie. Garfield is horrified to find that he is no longer the sole recipient of Jon's affections, and he does everything in his power to mess with Odie and convince Jon to get rid of him. However, a crazy man named Happy Chapman (Stephen Tobolowsky) is intent on putting Odie on television to advance his own struggling career. Chapman ends up kidnapping Odie and it's up to Garfield to save the dog that he loathes but has somehow come to miss having around.

""Garfield: The Movie"" is a really cute story that stays true to the spirit of Davis' comic. Murray's voice is the reason the film works so well: he is perfect in the role of the lazy, sarcastic cat! The only real issue I have with this film is that JENNIFER LOVE HEWITT is in it! She plays Jon's pseudo-girlfriend, Liz. What is UP with that?! Hopefully she won't be in the sequel. Other than that, this is a movie that adults and kids will all enjoy.",1153872000,,1370,4.48

If you are a diehard Garfield fan and have not seen this than you are not a Garfield fan.

Its about Garfield's lazy and very amusing life living with his owner Jon and Jon's other pet Odie. He eats enourmous amounts of food but his favourite is lasagna. However there are villains in this and it is Garfield's job to save Odie from them. Even though Garfield hates Odie he still saves the day.

2113565,3,B0002PYST2,"Since 1978, I have been following the exploits and adventures of Garfield and Odie.  When the movie came out, I wasn't sure how this was going to work as it was a blend of animation and live-action.  Although Garfield was computer generated and Odie wasn't, that didn't seem to hinder the flow of the film.

However, Garfield has a history of one-liners, which is expected when remembering that this comes from comic strip that must come up with a funny line in three or four frames.  In the movie, the writers seem compelled to force all the most famous one-liners into the movie.  This made the story feel a little sluggish at times.

Missing from the story, as well as the comic strip, is Lyman, who was the original owner of Odie.  I don't know of any reason for this, but it doesn't hurt the story at all.

If you obsess about the comic strip, then you will see this movie and will ask yourself why some things are missing.  However, you will get the character you love with the voice of Bill Murray.  After seeing the movie, you will always read the Garfield cartoon with Bill Murray's voice.  It seems to fit just right.

2113566,2,B0002PYST2,"Usually CGI enhances a movie, but if the writing and story are bad, it doesn't help at all. GARFIELD is one of those cases.  The story is generic and not very inventive. Bill Murray voices the feline bore effectively, but not even his presence doesn't help the film overall. One of the decision lapses of the film is that the creators use a CGI Garfield cat acting against live action cats and his nemesis Odie  (the dog) and it doesn't work. One cannot suspend disbelief because its as if there is a dimensional riff and two worlds are colliding. Also, on a technical standpoint, the CGI is not seamless.  There is a scene where Garfield is at an animal control shelter and one of the handlers takes out Garfield from a cage. It looks clunky and and unrealistic. Overall, a generally flat film based on a comic strip that all ready makes too much money from merchandising etc. (i.e. Remember those enoying GARFIELD stuffed dolls holding on to automobile windows with suction cups on the limbs). One does not need a successful film of the character to make even more money. Hopefully this film will set back a few buckos for cartoonist Jim Davis, his cartoon syndicate, the movie studio, and everyone else involved.

2113569,3,B0002PYST2,"I have been a fan of Garfield ever since I followed the comics in the local newspaper, then the subsequent cartoon, which is excellent and timelessly amusing, so imagine My delight when I first heard there was to be a film based on this feline icon - this time, completely rendered in CGI. Curious, I decided to pick up a copy of the movie the other day, and was actually pleased at the way he was presented, although the other characters lacked the same substance they do in the said comic and cartoon.

First off, I noticed the house was not Jon's. Odie is depicted as a regular sort of dog, and no use of that slurping tongue which is his primary characteristic was used. In My opinion, he should have also been rendered in CGI animation to capture that full effect. Nermil is not the cute and cuddly kitten either - just an onlooker hanging out with the neighborhood cats. And even Jon himself was rather dissappointing - he seemed to lack the personality of the original, and really ends up being presented like a milksop, who actually has good fortune with a pretty young thing, instead of the steady strems of failed dates he usually experienced.

Here, Garfield is introduced to Odie when Jon adopts him in an effort to impress a female vet, but ends up establishing a genuine rapport for the dog, taking attention away from Garfield, who will have none of that. Odie eventually impresses a judging panel at a dog show {using moves Garfield taught him!}, and becomes coveted by a gameshow host, seeing him as a possible ticket to the big time. So, after Garfiield uses his wiley ways to trick Odie out of the house, he runs away - Jon, distressed, places Lost signs about the neighborhood, which is brought to the gameshow host's attention, and basically ends up dognapping Odie after lying to an impressionable old lady who finds the pup on her porch. Feeling guilty, Garfield embarks upon a trek to the Big City to rescue Odie from the clutches of Mr. ""Happy Chapman"" who had actually affixed the pooch with an shock collar, but is himself imprisoned by Animal Control, but this is only a temporary setback. With the help of a street-talking rat, Garfield eventually employs the aid of some other animals to punish Chapman while implementing some poetic justice. And finally, Garfield learns the value of Odie's friendship, but still enjoys pushing him off the couch, instead of the kitchen table.

Bill Murray did do a good job with the voice {although I still would have liked to have heard Lorenzo Music instead}, and the Garfield kinematics were actually smooth and worked well to create the illusion of a living being. I believe the film would have been better produced using total CGI. The film does not match the cartoon strip or show, but is still an amusing movie for fans of this orange feline lasagnaphile.",1125446400,,2827,4.661322645290581
2113588,2,B0002PYST2,"In 1978, cartoonist Jim Henson.. or rather Jim Davis came up with a cartoon comic strip cat that he named Garfield.

In 1983, a cat lover since boyhood- while confined on some hospital, a fellow inmate or rather the-kid-right-beside me lend his VIEW MASTER viewer (you know those snap and slide 3d picture viewer toys back in the seventies) loaded with a GARFIELD disc  which eventually got me hooked to this great fat cat even since, all before this creation by Jim Davis became really that popular .. and by '87, I was at the peak of being a Garfield fanatic back then.

And thus to finally see GARFIELD in his first major motion pic is quite a treat, but then again- it so turned out that this movie rendition of the beloved cat falls so bland, granted that its nothing more but another commercial foil to line with the likes of the many disappointing cartoon/comic/strip adaptations such as that 80's Dennis The Menace- where the talent of the late Walter Matthau's completely wasted in the fitting role as Mr. Wilson. (more on the list later)

What wind up with this adaptation other than that the story which went on for the movie is not so well thought-out - it's that a lot of the characters have turned into a pale depiction against the comic strip basis. Garfield's owner Jon Arbuckle (played here by one i thought was the same guy who played Shaggy in that yet-another disappointing cartoon movie adaptation SCOOBY DOO) could've been well portrayed by John Lithgow, whilst Jon's love interest, the grumpy vet Liz (portrayed here by Jennifer Love Hewitt) would've been well if they maintained the character faithful to what the strips are.

Odie don't look like Odie. Nermul (that kitten who'd often steal the show from Garfield), is just not Nermul. And like a spoiled brat.. er, kid who just didn't get what he wants! I'm just so totally disappointed of this movie to the point of temper tantrums.

It's clever that they have Bill Murray to play the voice of Garfield - when its peculiar that Bill Murray's character in the cartoon rendition of the GHOSTBUSTER flick is voiced by Lorenzo Music who also did the voice for Garfield on the cartoon features, including that good cartoon series GARFIELD & Friends.

Musical-wise, this should've incorporated what they have started in the company of the cartoon features, and even more so - those that level well with Bacharach. But I guess the  people who created this movie adaptation don't really know the material that they have in their hands.
There's a scene where GARFIELD sang a song rendered as 'New Dog State of Mind' which is a very lame alteration of a BILLY JOEL song called 'New York State of Mind' -- totally it went flat (no pun intended).

However, the DVD contains the following features =

* feature lenght audio commentary Peter Hewitt (director) and John Hewitt (producer)

* behind-the-scenes feature: GARFIELD- Bringing the Cat To Life

* Multi-angle content: Jim Davis talks about creating Garfield

* ""Gone Nutty"" (ICE AGE spin-off featurette)

* Inside Look ( a featurette from the creators new project ROBOTS)

* Deleted Scenes

* Multi-language subtitles

* Scene Access menu

and ~ * Two 'virtual' games

As for the other disappointing comic/cartoon based movie adaptations - we have =

POPEYE (starring Robin Williams)
THE SHADOW
JUDGE DREDD (Stallone said so himself)
SPIDERMAN (late 70's TV)
CAPTAIN AMERICA
RICHIE RICH (this is one the most above it all)
STEEL
TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES (where the Turtles' personalities turned into some bunch of homies from brooklyn; and at worst! there's Vanilla Ice)
SCOOBY DOO
DENNIS THE MENACE
DAREDEVIL (put ELEKTRA as well on its side)
THE HULK (where good-ol' greenbag turns as big as King Kong (talk about over-doing))
and THE MASK

I guess for these movie adaptations whether based from another source such as a tv or movie feature, including those that've taken their sources from other cartoon, comics, or books series - one of the best adaptation that've surfaced is that of THE LITTLE RASCALS - I don't care what the detractors and/or critics would have to say, but whatever it is they stank to smell only from the stench of them purists.

After watching the movie, I can say that even though it wasn't the best movie that I saw, it certainly isn't that bad as people claim it to be.

The story is about Garfield, the lovable cat, enjoying his life as usual, with his food and TV (and Jon to an extent). Jon (Breckin Meyer) has a crush on Liz (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Garfield's veterinarian, who asks him to take Odie the dog and watch over him. Garfield feels threatened by Odie, as Odie is loved by everyone and seems to be invading Garfield's space, so Garfield decides to get rid of him. But once gone, Garfield feels guilty and goes on a mission to save his friend.

The credit firstly should go to the special effects people who created the 3d version of Garfield. I think they did a terrific job in making Garfield look as realistic as possible. Furthermore, people ridiculing the cast such as Breckin Meyer and Jennifer Love Hewitt should stop and consider the fact that these people had to portray emotions to a cat and a dog that actually didn't exist, and were created digitally. It's not easy acting out a role against an imaginary cat on set, and I think the cast did an excellent job on it! Sure, it's not an Oscar performance, but it should certainly not be mocked at. I think Bill Murray did a good job on providing the voice for Garfield. What does everyone expect? Garfield is supposed to sound bored and sarcastic, not yodel for everyone, and I think Bill Murray did a good job on that. The rest of the cast acted sufficiently.

Probably the only disappointment that I had in this movie was the dancing showdown between Garfield and Odie, which became a little annoying after a few seconds. If felt like Peter Hewitt, the director of this movie, was purposely trying to stretch it by adding the dancing sequence. Apart from that, I found the movie to be fun and quirky.

I guess people expected too much from this movie, considering the popularity of the comics and the TV show, which is why almost everyone trashed it. But if you watch this movie without any expectations, then you will be pleasantly surprised to liking Garfield: The Movie.",1123718400,,2289,4.508433734939759
2113590,4,B0002PYST2,"So far we have live action versions of Popeye, Scooby Doo, and the Flintstones, and now comes Garfield. Which almost all the characters from the show is seen, expect for pretty Binky, the Farm Animals, Al Swindler, Cactus Jake, and any of the other characters from the show that I am not thinking about, or so on the imdb's page from the show. Garfield looks animated, while it looks like a real dog is playing Odie. What they couldn't find a lot of orange fat cats to play Garfield? What could be next a live action movie of the Jetsons, I wonder who they will cast in that role. In the movie Garfield (Bill Murray replacing the late Lorenzo Music) lives with his owner Jon (Breckin Meyer). But then veterinarian Liz (Jennifer Love Hewitt) gives Odie to Jon to take home, and Garfield is not happy about this, and why would a cat be? So one night, Garfield is kicked outside, and before we know it Odie join him outside, and Odie's stuck outside, where he runs away from home, and is kidnapped by a tv show host (Stephen Tobolowsky). You can idmange what it will be like in the morning, but then Garfield realzies it is up to him to save his new housemate. Garfield and Freinds plays in repeats on Toon Disney, so if the kids like this, the introuce them to the show, this movie doesn't have a lot of humor of it to get the critics to hate it, but I am still going to give it a good review through, it seems to me that I love movies like this, but how many more live action movie can we take from an animated tv series, is it wearing out its welcome, it never had?",1123459200,,1565,4.237458193979933
2113591,4,B0002PYST2,"I desperately wanted to love this movie. I read all the damning reviews and heard all the negative word of mouth, but clung to my belief that it would be better than everyone seemed to be saying.

So, after all the bad press what's the verdict? Well, I am a loss to understand why the first Scooby Doo was successful enough to get a sequel and yet this cute vehicle starring the lovable, lazy kitty got slammed both critically and commercially.

Don't get me wrong, I like Scooby and the Mystery Inc. group. But any movie that features the (still) incredible looking Jennifer Love Hewitt and Bill Murray as the voice of Garfield is definitely far from as bad as people say.

Okay, let me put in a disclaimer here. I have a weakness of anything with JLH in it - how else can the fact that I liked ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"" be explained?

Back on subject, produced by Garfield's creator Jim Davis and starring Breckin Meyer of ""Road Trip"" and ""Rat Race"" fame as Garfield's owner Jon, this movie faithfully sticks to the formula that has made Garfield a cultural icon.

The voice of Bill Murray seems to flawlessly fit into the previous Garfield voice of the late Lorenzo Music. Murray triumphs in so perfectly capturing the qualities that Music endowed in the characters television appearances that, put side-by-side one simply cannot tell that the same person didn;'t do the voice of Garfield.

Here we have what could be considered an beginning story. The movie opens with Garfield as ruler of the roost, comfortable and content to be Jon's sole pet. This set of circumstances is soon threatened however when Jon smitten with sexy veterinarian Liz (played by Jennifer Love Hewitt) asks him to take in the talented pooch Odie.

Horror-stricken Garfield does everything to make Odie unhappy, but the dog remains committed to trying to be friends with Garfield - even joinging him on the porch once Garfield is banished from the house.

It is here that GARIFIELD takes a page out of TOY STORY in which a shunned Garfield is forced to rescue Odie from the clutches of an evil television host Happy Chapman who uses an electric shock-collar on Odie to make him perform tricks.

Special mention here goes to Stephen Tobolowsky who plays Chapman. He plays the part just right for the material here, nicely overacted with just the right amount of sneering menace. For the life of me I could not remember what I had seen him in, until I remembered his part of the nerdy game developer whose voice provides the team in one of my favorite spy movies SNEAKERS with access to the villains lair.

The movie is played with such good humor, some true laughs and such a likeable cast of characters (both human, animal and CGI) that its impossible for me to resist its charm. I was caught up in the entire plot and It made me a happy camper. And at a short 82 minutes my only regret was that it was not longer.

Far better than you may have thought, give this DVD a spin and see for yourself.",1123459200,,2988,4.5559701492537314

I am not a strict parent when it comes to movie watching but I also don't like my two litte one's going around saying stupid, butt, damn and ass.  All of these words were present in this movie.  I don't know why the character Garfield had to say stupid, idiot and other mean things.

Even he thought it was boring - and he was the one who picked it out becuase he liked the ""Garfield"" ride at Kennywood amusement park.  I haven't seen a more pointless movie in years.  The plot was mishmash of other plots, with the most obvious part taken directly from ""Toy Story 2"" (which did the rescue-a-friend bit infinitely better).  Bill Murray sounds incredibly disinterested, even for him.  Breckin Meyer is a sin against film and Jennifer Love Hewitt's career can be summed up in the fact that ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" was the high point.

2113607,1,B0002PYST2,"It's obvious that the cartoon comic-strip was meant for adults, but this is clearly for children. Why they set it for kids is beyond me. One of my friends was visiting from over seas and her and another friend really wanted to see this, I wanted to see something else but I still couldn't convince them. I was dragged into the theater to watch this horrible piece of trash. If I had Garfield for a pet I'd drown the little smart-ass. The jokes fell flat and were obviously for little kids, there was very little adult humor and when there was I found myself the only one laughing in the cinema. The plot is simple, Garfield gets jealous when Jon brings home a new dog who gets all the attention. The dog, Odie, is soon kidnapped and Garfield has to save him. Blah, blah, blah. Yadda, yadda, yadda...

Murray gave the voice of an okay Garfield, but the CG for Garfield was horrible. The actors didn't have the best interaction with him either. You often see the actors looking in an opposite direction. Overall, this is something for the kids when it should have been aimed at an older audience. Teenagers and adults will not like this movie.

2113610,3,B0002PYST2,"This movie could have been much better but it still gets a strong recommendation.

The plot is pretty simple but that's as it should be. This is a cartoon brought to the screen. The strip itself was never intended to be complex; it was just supposed to show the different facets of daily living with pets in a way that touched the funny bone. The film stays true to that idea.

The casting is great. Breckin Meyer is good looking enough to avoid looking like a nerd but has the right type of shy appeal to fit the role of Jon (Garfield's beleaguered owner) who's supposed to be decent but not particularly charismatic. Jennifer Love Hewitt has the right sort of appeal for the part of Liz as well. She's pretty, and very sexy, but it comes across in a way that's demure as opposed to sultry. Stephen Toblowsky makes a great heavy. His character isn't really evil as much as bitter. He's not a criminal. He just feels cheated and wants a better shake. Toblowsky has both the appearance and the demeanour to project that sort of aura. All of them are characters every viewer could identify with.

This is one of the areas where the movie falls short, and the blame has to lie with the writers, Joel Cohen and Alex Sokolow. The only emotional depth they give to the parts played by Meyer or Hewitt is an obvious affection for the pets and for each other. Beyond that these characters are barely even one-dimensional. Their lives are void of friction, problems, any sort of genuine happiness, frustration, basically anything to do with anything that could have passed as character development. They smile. They have the occasional frown and they have starry-eyed looks for each other but that's about it. Steven Toblowsky doesn't fare any better. He's allowed to show a conniving side but doesn't get to deliver any glassy-eyed looks of love. These aren't characters--they're paper dolls in people suits.

The CGI work in this film is wildly erratic. The best parts are so good it's easy to forget that it's a cartoon. The worst portions look exactly like what they are; a cartoon combined with live action. In scenes where either Meyer or Hewitt lift the flabby feline the work is seamless. In a scene where an animal handler picks Garfield up the human hands aren't even close to the ""fur"". When the latter happens it jars the viewer back to the reality of what's on the screen.

The saving grace for this film is Bill Murray. His voice is perfect for the role of Garfield and he appears to have to have embraced the part for all it was worth. He turns the corners of the emotional and psychological turns of the role as if he's walking on a thread. When he boots Odie off the couch his remarks make it convincing. When he comments as he bounces off Jon it's the character come to life. This may be one of his best performances in a while. He certainly lifts this project way above the mediocre ground the rest of the project was treading on.

But for Murray this would have been disappointment in a cat-suit. In many ways it still is. But because of him it also manages to be almost as much fun as it should be.",1116806400,,3110,4.50531914893617
2113611,3,B0002PYST2,"If you're 6 years old and get a kick out of animated cats dancing with dogs, you will enjoy this movie.  As a baby boomer, I loved Jerry Lewis movies like ""The Big Mouth"" when I was a kid.  Today, I find it too silly to watch, even for nostalgia's sake.  Garfield is the same.  It relies on the physical antics of the animated cat to carry the day.  I think the directors and animation artists were far more excited about it than I was.  One time in the movie: okay.  Twice: you're pushing it.  More than that is just plain tiresome.  So this goes well beyond tiresome.  Gone is the edginess of the character in the strip.  Instead, we have a piece of fluff that never comes close to its potential.  Even the Saturday morning Garfield and Friends cartoon was closer to the strip.  This movie is to the strip what Super Friends were to JLA: a watered-down version guaranteed not to offend anyone.  But your 6 year-old will absolutely adore it.",1116806400,,942,4.369942196531792
2113612,4,B0002PYST2,"I have to give this movie some credit: I thought it was good. I don't think it was great or anything, but it was at least good. I thought the best scenes were when Garfield and Odie were together. They made me laugh the hardest.

I'm a huge Garfield fan and I found this film to be enjoyable but somewhat bland. This would be a film that's kind of family-friendly and not raunchy and unfunny like the first Scooby-Doo movie. There are some good moments, some are mildly heartwarming, but the jokes are a little flat.

Yes, it doesn't seem to have weight especially in the scene where he is top of Jon in the bed; but that was not a deal breaker.  Garfield's facial expressions are superbly done; the fur looks amazingly real; Bill Murray's voice performance is excellent.

Too bad it didn't do well at the box office (fire the marketing team!) maybe that's the reason this DVD doesn't have ANY extras on the making of the movie.  I'd like to see some voice sessions showing Murray and some features on the creation of CG Garfield.  But nada, Fox just put it out to the market w/out putting any effort on it, what a shame.

He copes with the addition of the dopey but lovable mutt Odie to the household by arranging for him to get lost, then has an attack of conscience and goes to the rescue.  This really isn't a very good movie, but I liked it more than I should have.  I'm not sure why.  I'm not even a fan of the comic strip.  It probably has to do with Murray's vocal performance; nobody does sarcasm better than him, but he also brings some heart to the part.  The character design of Garfield is exceptional; just watching him leap on top of something, then madly scramble to keep his heavy bulk from slipping off is good for a smile./",1110499200,,708,4.366412213740458

Murray's voice brings the cynical, lazy comic cat to life and he's hilarious at times.  I laughed so hard when he kissed and stroked his teddy bear before going to bed.  That gotta be one of the most hilarious moments in life.  The orange fur coat is a bit too much at times, and ugly against solid-colored background (you can tell Garfield is ""pasted"" on the background), but you gotta love those fatty paws and that fatty tail.

Also, there was virtually no paralell between the strip and the movie.  In the strip, Jon originally had a roommate and Odie was the roommate's dog.  The roommate was faded out but Odie stayed.  In the movie, however, Odie was a present from Liz, the vet.  In the strip, Liz never passes up a chance to insult Jon; in the movie she's sweet-as-pie (gag).

Garfield has some very funny lines (down dumb dog) and gets into some very funny situations and Bill Murray was terrific as the voice with just the right adjustments here and there to be funny. Other than that the story is just enough to hold together the ""plot"", the human acting is painful (Breckin Meyer & Jennifer Love Hewitt need to fire their agents) and the dialogue is corny. Also I thought they should have made Jon the loser with women that he is in the comic strip and Odie should have been a CGI character as well.

2113656,2,B0002PYST2,"I never expected to watch the Garfield movie.

It earned terrible reviews from the major media reviewers and amateur reviewers alike. I was predisposed to avoid it. I didn't rent it, but was talked into it.

What we've got is a famous comic strip cat hamming it up on film. The premise in the film is that Garfield, an overweight and lazy, and occasionally witty cat, lives with Jon Arbuckle, a human. Jon's got a crush on Garfield's vet (played by Jennifer Love Hewitt), whom he's had eyes on since high school. The vet talks Jon into talking on a dog (Odie).

Garfield objects to Odie's innocent presence in their home, and puts him out for the night. Odie runs off, is captured by an evil TV animal entertainer. Garfield realizes he's in the wrong, and tries to chase down him down before Odie is brought to New York City.

Jon, in turn, feels awful, because as he sees it, he's lost both his dog and his cat. Worse than that, he's convinced his vet girlfriend looks down on him as a result.

The plot isn't so bad, especially when this is considered a children's movie. It is a little less complicated than other recent animated kids movies, like ""Jonah the Veggie Tales Movie"" or any of the message-heavy Disney song and dance cartoons. And it is less edgy than the Spiderman, X-Men or Hulk movies. How could it go wrong?

Poor scripting. Poor acting. Poor casting. Poor editing.

Poor scripting.
Good movies have good scripts. The classic Peanuts cartoons are classics not just because of the wholesale goodness of Charlie Brown, but because smart writers thought the project through. They did not, as Garfield's team does, rely on a cat dancing for laughs with a dog, or cheap one-liners. Even Michael Jordan's ""Space Jam"" went beyond this.

Poor acting.
Isn't Bill Murray funny? Can't Jennifer Love Hewitt actually act? Maybe Murray was just given bad lines, but he hardly seemed to care. Hewitt is cute, but that was it. She too wasn't there. Breckin Meyer was only OK. It seemed like an unrehearsed reading of a play.

Poor casting.
Murray as Garfield is predictable. Like Adam Sandler, Murray seems to only pick roles he has played before.

Poor editing.
We never saw the parts when Garfield made friends with a big nasty dog he previously tormented. No explanation was provided for how Jon cleaned up his trashed apartment in what seems to be a few minutes. We jump from scene to scene without the transitions needed for good storytelling. I'm guessing this ended up as budget cuts on the cutting room floor.

Your kids might like the movie, and you can feel family-safe with it. However, go into the Disney archives (before they went hyper-commercial), into the Warner Brothers cartoon vault, and find better quality flicks there.

2113659,3,B0002PYST2,"I try to open my mind up and not prejudge films, but it is admittedly hard to do. So I, an avid Garfield fan, went into this movie rather skeptical and actually came out (well not really, I rented but you get the point...) rather pleased. Sure this wasn't the greatest of films, but then again it wasn't that bad either.

I mean when Garfield has been around for so long, and in my opinion has been so humorous, it's hard to live up to the image. This film offered some laughs, some temporary entertainment and that is what the comic strip has been doing for years.

My only regrets are that Garfield in all of his CGIness looked like he did, but animation will improve over time. Also, I wish that Jon and Garfield were in more scenes together because surprisingly enough Breckin Meyer (Jon), who I thought my ruin the film, actually really helped it.

So overall, it's ok and I'd recommend it, but it's not necessarily going to be a ""family"" film for the ages.",1103932800,,962,4.393258426966292

It seemed like the director was merely out to get some cheap laughs; however, when I saw the film it was rather refreshing to me to see that there was quality in the film.  There was actually a moral resonance, for example, that came about in Garfield and Odie's relationship.

The main drawback to this film was unfortunately Bill Murray's rendition of Garfield.  Another issue was that Garfield, in all of his computerized glory just lacked a touch of reality.  If Odie was a real dog then why was Garfield not a real cat?

All in all, this film was very good.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys Garfield or just a good family film.",1103932800,,799,4.5

Upset by Garfield, he lets Odie runaway and the dog is taken by a greedy spokesperson. It's up Garfield with friends to save Odie before it's too late.

Entertaining comedy based on the popular comic strip and cartoon i grew up with. Jennifer Love Hewitt was perfect in playing Dr. Liz Wilson, Garfield did seem realistic on the fur almost like how realistic Gollum in LOTR was.

The DVD is pratically barebones with no extras at all but a sneek peek at next year's animated movie ""Robots"" by Fox and an audio commentary by the filmmakers.",1103068800,,738,4.45925925925926

The film is about average in relation to the amount of entertainment it provides and most of the jokes fall flat.  The plot is not all that bad, but the actors seem forced in portraying their roles/characters (though Jennifer Love Hewitt is absolutely GORGEOUS).  Nevertheless, the special effects are very good.

In all honesty, I'll take the cartoons anytime compared to the movie, though if you're a Garfield fan you might want to give it try, but keep in mind it's no masterpiece.",1102896000,,669,4.55

With that said, I didn't really like him here.  I know that this is me being a hypocrite, because I've said it more than once when other reviewers were talking about the quality.

Okay for every negative, reinforce it with positive.  The message was great in here.  Garfield, a spoiled, suburban fat cat whose owner Jon in an attempt to capture Dr. Liz, a vet's attention (who he's been in love with forever) he adopts a dog, Odie.

Needless to say Garfield is unhappy.  Not only does Odie live in his house, he touches his things.  On top of it, Jon is simply taken by this pet.  As Garfield at Odie's expense takes back his home we see Garfield realize his mistake and sets out to rescue Odie after he's dog-napped.

I did love Bill Murray as the voice of Garfield.  And Odie & Garfield dance off was hilariously funny.  So my kids love it, but I just like it.

2113676,3,B0002PYST2,"Wow. Some things are better left ...alone. Garfield is a great comic strip, but as a movie, eh, kind of loses something. Considering how difficult it likely was to bring this strip to the big screen, I guess it's ok as it is. But I noted some strip-to-screen inconsistencies. Like for instance, the fact that Nermal should be a kitten sized cat, that Jon (John?) isn't supposed to be decent looking (he'd have more normal dates in the strip wouldn't he?), and Liz the vet doesn't want to date Jon, yet in the movie, tsk, she does. If you're going to bring the essence of a comic strip to the big screen, I think it's a good idea to stick to the characteristics of it's characters. Still, it was kinda cute. And any movie I can watch all the way through is ok with me. Like this one.",1102118400,2,782,4.29054054054054
2113677,2,B0002PYST2,"I wasn't impressed by this movie at all. It's another attempt from Hollywood to cash in on an old money maker and let anybody script it.

I'm with the people who say this movie doesnt do any justice of the Garfield we knew in the comic or cartoon. Pretty much only the names, and Garfields look are recignisable. Much like THUNDERBIRDS & LOST IN SPACE they have just used the names and props and given it a completly different story line to what your used to. Garfield i can let pass, but John is not protrayed well, john was supposed to be a looser who couldn't score with the chicks, but in this movie he is a sucsessfull in love kinda guy. Odie was a dopey slobbering pup who was Garfields bash toy, in the movie Garfield is very jeloous when John brings Odie home, but the dog it self is a real live dog, and does very smart things. Nermal is supposed to be Garfeilds little cute Nefue or something that Garfield can not stand, but the movie shows it as being another normal cat in the neigbourhood, why even bother putting Nermal's name in it then? And Arleine was Garfields girlfriend, least he wanted it to be, but again, it's just another cat in the neigbourhood. There wasn't even a scene on the fence that was always int he comics.

The plot was pretty thin and predicatble, and you know what will happen between Garfield and Odie from the begining.

The kids will enjoy this movie, they most likely won't know who Garfield is, so they will think it's just a new movie with a cat, which is obviously what Hollywood decided to do when making this film instead of getting a script that does justice to the Garfield that people grew to love int he first place.

But seeing as how the kids won't know who he is, and they will like this movie, expect 100 seaqulls from Hollywood to cash in on the franshice that they have now made new for themselves.",1101513600,,1855,4.3526011560693645
2113678,3,B0002PYST2,"It is interesting that the comic strip ""Garfield"" got its first TV special ""Here Comes Garfield"" in less than five years but it was over 25 years until there was a Garfield movie.  From the start, the producers had to choose how to make the movie; whether to make Garfield a cartoon character in a live action background, use a live cat for Garfield (cats are very hard to train), make the whole movie a cartoon, etc.  There has been debate over which would have been best, but the computer generated Garfield works fine.

The story is one in which Garfield loves to bully Odie but nonetheless comes comes to his rescue when the pup becomes lost and captured.  This plot is hardly original.  Indeed it is similar to that of ""Here Comes Garfield.""  Here are some other problems I had with the movie.

It is not true enough to the comic strip.  In the strip, Jon does not get Odie from Liz.  Jon acquired Odie when he took Lyman, an old friend, into his home.  Odie belongs to Lyman who after the first two years of the comic strip mysteriously stops appearing in the strip.  I guess Lyman had served his purpose of introducing Odie.  In the comic strip, Garfield does not talk as he does in this movie.  Even in animated cartoons, such as the aforementioned TV special and the animated TV series that came later, Garfield does not speak.  Instead his thoughts are heard.

Jennifer Love Hewitt is a trendy choice to play Liz, Garfield vet, but perhaps not the best.

I would have liked for them to have used the same voice for Garfield as in the animated series ""Garfield and Friends.""  But I did a little research and found that it wasn't their fault.  Sadly, Lorenzo Music, who supplied that voice, has died.  Bill Murray is adequately convincing as the voice of Garfield.

In spite of the negative comments, I watched with interest because it is mildly humorous and I kept wanting to know what would happen next.",1101340800,,1913,4.521865889212828

So let's start with my take on this film, well the computer generated GARFIELD was pretty impressive but THAT'S IT...the actors in this film seemed disinterested and bored, the story even though it was targeted for kids was very boring and stupid and not funny, and our favorite cat was just not the same way we knew him from the old school days with the comic stripes in the local papers and those over-sized comic books but that's not  his or Bill Murray's fault i guess...so i'll just blame it on the writers and producers of this film for coming up with a quick script and them thinking that they had a sure-fire hit on their hands.
Well Guess what..THE MOVIE FLOPPED!!
As for my nephew's take on this movie, well he laughed for the first 5 minutes, then seem bored for the next 45 mintues..and finally fell asleep for the rest!
So in conclusion, i hated it and he slept through it, so if you wanna take a chance on GARFIELD, maybe just rent it instead of buying it!",1101168000,,1153,4.240909090909091

What I don't really get, is why they didn't animate the rest of the animal cast? It seemed odd to me that Garfield was animated and the rest of the characters were real.

While the villain was a bit silly, I liked the character of Jon and his girlfriend the Vet. I found myself actually caring whether these two got together. Jon was a surprising combination of inept cluelessness and friendly-scmuckishness.  Garfield...Was of course Garfield. A bit mean. Majorly self-centered and hard to like at first. Over time, he grows on you. Really

What can I say? this was a surprisingly cute film. The human actors did a great job interacting with the CGI animated Garfield. Well-done.",1101081600,,830,4.75
2113681,2,B0002PYST2,"First off, I'm a die-hard ""Garfield"" fan. Thus, I'm speaking of the comic strip series and the hit cartoon show (along with the Christmas special and others). Seeing how Garfield did so well in the 80's and early 90's, this movie feels a bit dated.

Since CGI is creeping around everywhere in movies now, I'd say it somewhat resembles Garfield. A weird look, but it works. I would been much happier if either the whole film was animated or all the characters other than Garfield were CGI (especially Odie!). The CGI Garfield and real Odie (and real Jon, etc.) just didn't work for me. Work in an mediocre story, and well, you have another great cartoon pasttime get caught up in the Hollywood shuffle.

Die-hard fans should avoid this film. New comers, I suggest getting one of Garfield books (like ""In Dog Years I'd Be Dead : Garfield at 25"") or cartoon collections on DVD. You'll see how the real Garfield is.",1100822400,,911,4.617283950617284
2113682,3,B0002PYST2,"Garfield: The Movie is a cute film featuring the feline icon that exploded on the scene in the early 1980s and is still at large (so to speak). The movie is funny; not in a ""haw haw"" way but rather in a ""ahhh, that's cute"" sort of way. It is a great family film. It does not have any of the superfluous silliness or the disgusting toilet humor that so many kids' films have. Nothing to embarrass adults here. It is rather slow at times but just being able to see Garfield in the fur is a treat for any fan.

The plot: Jon is the devoted owner of a fat, self-absorbed cat. He often takes his pet to see the vet as much due to his concern for his beloved cat's health as for the cute veterinarian Liz on whom he's had a crush since high school. Impressed by Jon's devotion to Garfield, Liz presents him with a little dog Odie who is in need of a home. Jon takes the dog and smothers him with attention causing his orange cat to turn green with envy; especially when Jon and Liz take off to a dog show with Odie with no intention of taking the cat along. Odie shows an extreme talent for physical acrobatics at the dog show catching the eye of television personality Happy Chapman. Chapman offers Jon a television career for the dog but Jon refuses. That night, the jealous Garfield locks Odie out of the house. Odie runs away where he is soon in the hands of the diabolical Happy Chapman who wishes to use Odie as his television sidekick. Without the time to train him, Chapman plans on using an electric dog collar to shock Odie into various stunts. The guilt-ridden cat, with the help of his mouse friend, leaves his beloved cul de sac in search of his canine pal.

Breckin Meyer and Jennifer Love Hewitt were good choices for Jon and Liz, but they have just supporting roles as the star is the computerized cat. As far as showing Garfield's comic strip personality (hating Mondays for whatever reason, loving lasagna, being too lazy to chase a mouse) it is a success. Garfield also encounters other animals from the strip like Nermal, Arlene (although there is no indication she is his girlfriend), and his mouse friend. Garfield is the only computerized animal. All the other animals ""talk"" except for Odie. At first I wished that Odie was computerized too, but the physical comedy of the dog actor is more impressive than any computerized stunts plus the real dog cannot detract from the true star of the film. In the comic strip, Odie was Lymon's dog (Jon's friend with the goofy mustache at the beginning of the series). Most people do not remember that short-lived character so it does not bother me that they changed the origins of Odie in the film. We also get the treat of seeing Garfield smashed against the car window like so many of those stuffed Garfields with suction cups on their paws we've all seen staring out of car windows through the years. As far as extras go, this DVD offers sneak peaks at upcoming films Robots and Because of Winn-Dixie"" A Dog's Tale. It also has the music video ""Holla!"" by Baha Men.

At the end when he danced out on Jon's porch singing I was laughing to the max and found him adorable.

There were a few things in the movie they changed nonetheless, like Nermal looks totally different from his comic strip form and Odie as well.

Having Bill Murray voice Garfield was a good move, since Lorenzo Music had also voiced Murray's old GHOSTBUSTERS character Venkman for the cartoon continuation of that film, but Garfield himself wasn't as anthropomorphic as he is in the strip and animated shows.  Breckin Meyer was a good call for Jon, but Jennifer Love Hewitt is far too nice a person to be the usually cranky Liz.  Naturally they couldn't find real cats and dogs to portray Arlene and Odie as they appear in the strip, but making Nermal a Siamese with the Brooklynish voice of David Eigenberg rather than a gray tabby with a high-pitched chirpy voice like Desiree Goyette did for the cartoons was a really bad move.

In spite of the over-exposure, however, Garfield remains a classic comic character.  Transferring him to the big screen and using CGI effects was a risk, and for me, it paid off, simply because it's an entertaining and harmless romp.  The mixture of real animals with the computer generated Garfield is questionable, but it works, and you can't help but enjoy this lighthearted, lightweight comic caper.

An unnecessary swear word was blasted near the beginning of the movie, which would have been okay if the movie had not been intended for a relatively young audience. Additionally negative is that Garfield's sayings concerning an ""astronaut game"" venture into the corny side, and that a collar that electrifies a certain man gets a bit too harsh for humor.

Based on characters created by Jim Davis, the film tells the story of this supremely spoiled pet, who wants the affection of everyone around him, only he wants it on his own terms. Trouble arises one day when, under the influence of the beautiful veterinarian Liz (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Garfield's owner Jon (Breckin Meyer) stuns him by bringing home a cuddly dog, Odie. Jealous at the attention Odie is receiving, Garfield locks Odie out of the house. Odie runs away and when he's kidnapped by the evil television personality Happy Chapman (Stephen Tobolowsky), Garfield realizes his mistake, and embarks on a brave mission to rescue his new housemate.

Bill Murray is a perfect choice to provide the loveable voice behind the computer-animated cat. Director Peter Hewitt keeps the story moving along at a clipped pace, which will ensure that children's attention spans won't be tested. Breezy and charming, GARFIELD is a nostalgic return to the past for older viewers who grew up with the fuzzy feline, and an engaging introduction for younger audiences who are meeting him for the very first time.",1099008000,,1235,5.083743842364532
2113718,4,B0002PYST2,"It's a perfect family flick, kids will surely love it (mine did) while the older ones in the family will appreciate Bill Murray's sardonic wit as Garfield's voice.  All of our favorite cat's obnoxious behavior are presented in full glory: his love for lasagna, his irritation with Odie. Breckin Meyer as the hapless John may border on the bland side unlike in the comic strip and cartoon where he totally loses control (maybe in the sequels). Even Garfield's friends are here like Nermal, although they are not CG like our fat cat. The CGI of Garfield is impressive enough, although there are some scenes where the people holding Garfield seems to be holding air.  Jennifer Love Hewitt is here basically to provide some smiles and some pulling power.

The story is pretty straightforward, you won't miss anything if you go to the kitchen if your kids want some popcorn or drinks, maybe except Bill Murray's funny one-liners.

And how's this: In the TV cartoon, Garfield was voiced by Lorenzo Music who also voiced Peter Venkman in the Ghostbusters cartoon. Peter Venkman was played by, guess who, Bill Murray in the original movie. Coincidence? Maybe not.

Buy this DVD for the kids, I'm sure they're going to watch it again and again.",1098921600,,1235,4.834123222748815
2113719,2,B0002PYST2,"The clever, ironic humor of Garfield hooked me a long time ago, and now that I bought this movie for my kids, who also love him, we find a slightly different rerun of a TV chapter when Garfield is caught and Odie saves him.

Sorry but the effort fell too short!",1098921600,,261,4.117647058823529
2113720,4,B0002PYST2,"He's orange, fat, rude, and has a cravin' for lasagna, and in the movie so aptly named for him, ""Garfield"" manages to entertain a broad demographic.  There's something cute and cuddly about having the overweight CGI cat intermingle with live-action dogs and cats.  All of the scenes involving real animals were funny, and were downright hilarious to my three year-old.  My little daughter laughed at Garfield and Odie as they danced to the Black-Eyed Peas.  She laughed when Stephen Tobolowsky and Garfield had it out at the train station.  She loved watching Nermal go flying out of the bucket so that Garfield could get a shot of milk without leaving the ""cul-de-sac."" All of these antics worked well to bring in the youngsters.

What made ""Garfield"" appealing to the older crowd was the fat cat's attitude.  He's lazy, hateful, and a huge underachiever.  That's what makes him so fun to watch on the screen.  He managed to be just offensive enough to bring in the adults, but remained soft and fluffy enough for the kids at the same time.

Bill Murray is great as the voice of our obese feline.  Jennifer Love Hewitt does a pretty good job as the sexy vet who has a thing for Jon.  Stephen Tobolowsky who, in my opinion, is very underrated, stole the show as the jealous brother of a big-time TV anchor.  He plans to use Odie as his new meal-ticket to success.  The only shortcoming of this movie is Breckin Meyer, who seems to be severely miscast as Jon Arbuckle.  He's just too gooey-gooey good.  I know that Jon's always been a nervous wreck around women, and that he loves Garfield and Odie more than anything, but Meyer just came across as too much of a loser instead of the shy geek I remembered Jon to be.  Luckily for us, the humans in this flick are used sparingly, so he doesn't become too much of a nuisance.

I recommend this flick to anybody looking for a good family flick that appeals to all age groups.  It can get a little bit syrupy at times, but not so much that it makes you lose your lasagna.",1098921600,,2016,4.5041322314049586

Don't try and compare a live action & CGI story with a 3 sqaure comic strip and you'll enjoy.  If you just sit back and let yourself be entertained, there's nothing wrong with it.

I liked the degree of realism for Garfield.  Obviously, he's CGI, but the way his fur is rendered is impressive enough that he becomes a character on the screen and not merely some flashy graphics.",1098835200,3,483,4.393258426966292

Still, it does have a little charm.  Kids seem to enjoy it.  Maybe this is a Garfield for the next generation.",1098835200,,445,4.556962025316456
2113724,4,B0002PYST2,"Just about everybody in the country seemed to dislike this movie when it was in theaters.  The famous tv critic duo couldn't stand the weird, fake look of the CGI fat cat dropped into the filmed background with other (real) animals and people.  It bombed in theaters when the adult children of the 80s who grew up loving the sassy feline thought that this just didn't do him justice.  But for some reason, the consensus from my kids (boys aged 2 and 6) is that it was pretty good, maybe even good enough to see a few times.  I have a feeling that they would be up for the sequel if it ever gets made.

Garfield (for those of you who haven't read the funnies in about 25 years) is a fat, wisecracking orange cat that is constantly getting the better of his innocent owner Jon, the milkman, the neighborhood dogs and anybody else that gets in the way of his pursuit of pleasure.  One day Jon agrees to adopt Odie, a smallish and not-so-bright dog that annoys Garfield no end.  On top of the indignity of having to put up with a dog, now our hero has to share the spotlight.  Clearly, somebody has to move out!  Thus begins a little adventure of the two as they make their way through town trying to find each other and eventually becoming friends.  It's a cute, simple story that children will appreciate along with the various talking and dancing animals, things getting knocked over and broken, etc.  This is a movie about on a kid's level to be sure.

Adults, esp. longtime fans of the comic strip, will no doubt be annoyed at the unnatural-looking version of Garfield waltzing around with filmed cats, dogs and humans.  This Garfield seems to have a nonstop running commentary which is at times funny, but it seemed to me that the comic strip Garfield was more selective with his one-liners delivered at just the right moment, so I felt that the spirit of the original character was not here.  Another departure from the printed version was Liz, played by Jennifer Love Hewitt; she was a drier wit in the comic, but here she's  sweet and crushing on Jon.  That's just my cynical adult point of view however, and because this movie was so obviously not made with me and my ilk in mind, I learned to disregard my expectations and see it through a kids' eyes.  It wasn't bad, after all.

Oh, and a little secret - to avoid being forced to watch the irritating previews at the beginning, hit your fast forward button as soon as they start (no, menu doesn't work) and it will take you to the menu.  At least it worked that way on my dvd player.

Three stars from me, five stars from the kids = four stars overall.  Recommended for younger kids.

Second, the special effects in creating the Garfield character, plus all the talking aimals, is just fantastic.  Third, Bill Murray was THE most perfect choice to voice the fat, orange cat.

2113729,3,B0002PYST2,"My son is a pretty typical 10 year old, and he asked me to rent Garfield for our Friday night movie. Needless to say, because I am writing this review, that his request was granted. As this movie was chosen by a child and watched by the whole family I will present two views: my son's, and my own.

My son thought the movie was amusing. I choose my words carefully here because there were no guffaws during the whole movie from my son. He likes talking animals and dancing pets and is entertained by the usual knocking things over and breaking things required in this type of movie. However, he did not get as excited about this movie as ""Sinbad"" which we watched two weeks ago. I think he is growing up and dancing dogs just do not make the cut anymore. So if you have a typical 10-12 year old do not look for great enthusiasm for this movie.

That said, I found the movie dull. Sure, it was cute. Yes, the dancing pets made me smirk. Yes, Bill Murray did a great job and was perfect for the voice. However, the movie was extremely predictable from the first frames to the last and was somewhat slow for a movie aimed at youngsters. The only thing that was out of the ordinary, I felt, was Jennifer Love Hewitt's character's forwardness. We always knew ""Jon"" would get the girl, but I expected him to catch her not the other way around. Otherwise very predictable from the villain to the antics.

So if your kids have seen everything else, or love Garfield, or are more amused by dancing pets and talking animals than my son, go ahead and rent this film. It contained nothing I found offensive or overtly sexual [unless a kiss is to racy for you], and is good clean, non-crude, fun for the whole family.",1098489600,,1704,4.352201257861635

When he sings and dance it is pretty lame too. However I still don't see no real reason to hate the movie. I actually think it's much better than the Scooby Doo movies too. I see the bad in the movie but still I got caught up in it too and it kept my attention through-out. Garfield trying to find and save Odie is fun. He's self-centered and feels like Odie took his place as John's pet. Odie grows on him though and they become friends and the result is cute and harm-less. Plus some people ask why all the other animals talk but not Odie, well did Odie talk in the show or comic strip ?...No. He's meant to be dumb and slobber a lot and the dog they chose for the part is adorable. Plus yes I did laugh at the scenes where he stands up and dances. Odie steals the show without a voice over unlike Garfield who makes you wish he'd just shut-up.",1098230400,,1083,4.018518518518518

They really screwed up BIG time because Jon didn't get Odie from the vet in the comic strip, Odie was Jon's roommate's  (Lyman's) pet. But later on Lyman just disappeared.

2113741,3,B0002PYST2,"Face it.  'Garfield: The Movie' has only one merit, but that one thing is well worth watching, which happens to be, why not? Garfield, that egoistic, fat, lazy cat which is created with the magical CGI techniques.  I say 'magical,' and that's not exaggeration because among the flood of the numerous CGI tricks in Hollywood, the images of this cat are impeccable, seamlessly fit into the surrounding scenery.

Forget the story, for it's just another poor excuse for the producers to make a feature film (and that barely exceeds 80 minutes).  Garfield, the fat lazy cat, is happy with his lazy life with his master Jon (Breckin Meyer, 'Road Trip').  But Jon decides to keep a dog, the emeny for all the cats, just to impress Liz (Jeniffer Love Hewitt), a beautiful vet at the animal hosptal.  Now, Garfield does not like it.  He hates the dog, he hates the new life.

After this rather contrived premise, some adventures for the cat follow.  The cast include Stephen Tobolowsky as a TV host of animal show who tries to use Jon's dog for his promotion, and voices by Alan Cumming and Nick Cannon.  You can easily recognize them.

But the most wonderful things of the film all belong to the creation and personality of Garfield, voiced by perfectly cast Bill Murrey.  His casting is the main reason for the success in establishing the credible, lovable character of Garfield, whose weary, cynical voices hide warm humanity.  And the Garfield's images are so real, without losing the comic touch of its origin. It's worth Oscar.

Director Peter Hewitt may be best known for 'Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey' but in this film you just can't expect originality in the story.  The occasional wacky humor and slapstick gags are amusing, but all remain in the safe territory.

In short, the only reason I can recommend 'Garfield: The Movie' is its title role: Garfield, and its personality.  Humans are far less effective and lively, and curiously, less human, than this cat.",1096675200,4,1963,4.794642857142857

2113744,4,B0002PYST2,"I'm going to go against the grain on this one. I've been a Garfield fan ever since I was a kid, and I was delighted by this film.

Sure, it has come a few years late, and I can quite understand the complaints that Garfield is presented out of character (i.e. far too active), but it does not stop the humor and spirit of the old cat.

Bill Murray's voice has always perfectly suited Garfield, and in this movie a series of innocent yet hilarious gags will have you laughing away. As the story progresses, we are introduced to a bunch of likeable characters and old fashioned nasty children's villains.  Throughout the movie Garfield keeps us smiling, and the effects on Garfield himself are well done.

In these days where most films are almost obliged to contain either plenty of violence or plenty of `adult' humor, it's nice to have a break. Garfield is a good old fashioned style kids film that will also appeal to adults like me. Don't expect too much, just enjoy the laughs.",1094947200,,980,4.519774011299435
2113745,3,B0002PYST2,"I purposely went in with very few expectations of this film.  I grew up with Garfield as a kid in the 80s, reading the comics in the daily newspaper, watching Garfield and Friends on TV and getting the comics at my school book fair.  Garfield was a part of me while growing up, much like Ninja Turtles and GI Joe was for other kids during that time.  So I knew meeting up to the legend would be difficult, especially without the original voice of Garfield, however, that could not be helped since Lorenzo Music died 3 years ago.

Bill Murray did an good job for what he had to work with.  He had to fill the shoes of Lorenzo Music, who was THE embodiment of Garfield and many of us veteran Garfield fans would be critical of his performance.  He had the saracsm and cynicism down almost perfectly, which is what Garfield is known for and why his popularity spread amongst kids and adults alike.

I remember Breckin Meyer for his nice-guy role in Rat Race and was not surprised to see him playing almost the exact same character in Garfield; nice and shy.  Now the original John was nice but NOT shy... just really, really, really dorkish.  He wore disco outfits, dressed up his animals and cat-called every girl he saw.  I liked the ol' dorky John that never seemed to get a break... or a clue.

Jennifer Love Hewitt plays Liz, the vet.  In the old comics, Liz didn't show any interest in John whatsoever... to his face at least, but you get hints of it here and there since she keeps reappearing.  In the movie, she's all flirty with John and practically hits on him.  Not to mention she seems kinda ditzy, especially the outfits she wears, I can't tell if she's dressed up for work or for prom.

Nermal and Arlene were characters that the director skewed beyond recognition.  Nermal's schitck in the comics and in the cartoon was the annoying, cute grey kitten that always got shipped to Abu Dhabi.  Why didn't they include THAT?!  I loved it when Garfield would torture poor Nermal, that was what Nermal was all about.  You do not get any of that in the movie and I was greatly disapointed.  Arlene was supposed to be Garfield's girlfriend that lacked all the attention despite her advances on him... didn't get that in the movie either.

Last but not least of my complaints; the villian.  Um... lame.  I agree with many reviewers here that an evil Binky the Clown would've fit... well, maybe a bit over the top, but the one they chose was really lame.  I think Bill O'Reilly or Michael Moore would've made a better villian.

There were some complaints about Garfield being the only CG character, and I think they should've made Odie in CG just to capture his tongue attack, something many Garfield fans have come to know and love to hate at the same time.

However, if you strip away the legend of Garfield prior to this movie's release, it wasn't all that bad.  I enjoyed the movie personally, they stuck to several old jokes from the comics and even though I saw them coming a mile away, it rekindled my childhood memories of Garfield and that's what counts to me.

I think they get the basic characteristics of Garfield although not all of them. The character of Jon is nothing like the comics but where could you find an actor to play that loser. This is more based for the children but adults (like myself) will enjoy it but will maybe be a bit disappointed as I expected more of the great and sophisticated Garfield humour to appear.

From here on out it's a typical Garfield adventure with all the feel of his wonderful animated series and specials, full of excitement, danger, comedic antics, and fun!

In 2001 we lost Lorenzo Music, the true voice of Garfield. Bill Murray (one of the genuinely funniest guys around) fills his shoes in this live-action feature, and he does it well! No, he doesn't sound EXACTLY the same, but there is something very familiar in their voices and deliveries. In fact, Lorenzo voiced Bill Murray's character, Peter Venkman, for the first part of the ""Real Ghostbusters"" animated series' run. Bill has exactly the right dry, sarcastic, and disinterested wit needed for the role of Garfield. One reviewer complained that he sounded bored. PERFECT! In this movie Bill Murray IS Garfield. I usually have complaints about CGI. I still don't think it's as perfected as the industry seems to think it is, but the fact remains, Garfield looks great. He looks real, yet he looks just like Garfield. Bill does him perfectly. His personality is totally intact. I read a review that complained about Garfield going on an adventure to save Odie, saying Garfield would never do something like that because he's too selfish and self-centered. Folks, if you are not a fan of Garfield's animated exploits, perhaps you may feel the way that reviewer did. The comic strip only gives us a few moments in Garfield's life each day, just enough for a simple gag or sarcastic remark. In the animated series and specials we see all the aspects of Garfield's personality. Under all that selfish fur and flab lurks a warm-hearted, loving cat that would do anything for his family (complaining the whole time, I'll grant you). Therefore, if you only love the brief, sarcastic moments of Garfield you read in the comics, perhaps you just won't get it. Fans of Garfield in animation will understand this film much better. After all, Jim Davis had a hand in this too, he didn't just completely turn things over to Hollywood.

Many complaints about ""Garfield: The Movie"" are from those who have prejudged this film without seeing it, or from folks who simply don't dig family entertainment. True, Garfield and the other animals move their ""lips"" when they talk, unlike in the cartoons and comics. The fact is, as long as the humans can't hear what they say, it doesn't matter. According to Jim Davis, they chose to do this because it just looks better on screen, and he's right. Movies like ""Homeward Bound,"" that rely on animal telepathy, can still be great films, but there's something a little more comfortable (oddly enough) about films where the animals actually ""speak"" when they speak. It's a very minor complaint, even to this long time Garfield fan. A more worthy complaint is over the fact that Garfield is the only CG character. This is also blown out of proportion. It's not that bad for the most part. CGI effects are far more distracting in movie previews, before you are engrossed in the films that feature them. In fact, the only visual aspect that I found really distracting was the fact that Nermal was a Siamese cat instead of a cute gray kitten. Contrariwise, Arlene looked more like a full grown Nermal. I really felt they should have reversed the cats that played these rolls, and I'm still not sure why Nermal wasn't a kitten. Perhaps these two should have been CG too. But overall it was a visually pleasing Garfield experience, with a perfect Garfield and Odie.

But let's not overlook the human characters. Breckin Meyer plays Jon, and one of my personal dreamgirls, Jennifer Love Hewitt, is the veterinarian, Liz. While the actors were nicely cast, their roles were not perfectly written. Jon was still a nice guy and almost on the mark, but he wasn't quite dorky enough. Where was the tacky clothing? Liz was just a little too sweet and into Jon. I guess it wouldn't have made for much of a romance angle, which was cute in the movie, but it would have been more true to the characters if she had been mostly uninterested in Jon. Overall, I'd have to say this is the only SOLID flaw in the film, and the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars. The villain of the story was very ""Garfield the animated series,"" but I often think it would have been nice if he had been portraying Binky the Clown instead of an all new character. But all in all, this is a wonderful, family friendly movie that really keeps the spirit of the fat cat intact and should be enjoyable to all Garfield fans if they don't prejudge or limit themselves to the world of the comics. This DVD edition, however, offers little more to enjoy than the film itself. You are given the option of viewing in full or widescreen, but there are no extra features related to the film. All the disc boasts is a behind the scenes featurette, but it isn't even about Garfield; it's about ""Because of Winn Dixie,"" a dog movie that was not yet in theaters at the time of the DVD release. I highly recommend getting a copy of this fun family film, but you may want to wait for the upcoming ""Purrrfect Collector's Edition."" Not sure what will be on that, but it's gotta offer more than this first release.",1094083200,13,6105,4.640480591497227

2113750,3,B0002PYST2,"And only marginally redeemed by Garfield.

There's not much to separate this from rubbish like Cats and Dogs and Stuart Little. Everything that happens onscreen is there to appeal to the youngest of kids. No one over the age of 8 will get much out of this movie. Unlike movies such as Shrek 2 or Brother Bear, there's absolutely NOTHING in this for adults at all. A shame really as the humor in the Garfield comic strip can sometimes be very clever and observant.

It's worse when you go see this with a bunch of screaming kids (and a baby-honestly why bring a baby to the cinema?!?) who laugh at every single thing. And that's including the stuff that isn't meant to be funny. It did get very irritating and proves furthermore that this is a movie for infants.

The tiny bit of humor the movie does have comes ENTIRELY from Garfield. Bill Murray is great, his delivery is catatonically laid-back and dry. The CGI of Garfield is also very good. He looks to cute that you just want to keep him. But any positive the movie has begins and ends right there.

Breckin Meyer may look the part of Jon but he has less than nothing to do in the role. Jeniffer Love Hewitt (gorgeous as she is) is totally slumming it in a role that requires her to do even less than Breckin Meyer and the other animal cast members resemble nothing like their comic-strip counterparts.

I was a little annoyed at seeing Garfield talk in the trailers but in the movie no humans can hear him or the other animals. There are some other things they have changed. Odie comes straight from the vet, though in the comic-strip he came from Jon's friend Lyman. Nermal does not appear to be Garfield's cousin and Arlene doesn't appear to be his girlfriend either.

The story of Garfield rescuing Odie from an 'evil' TV host is completely uneventful and nothing much happens around it. The ending is an unentertaining, unexciting anti-climax and disgustingly childish. I appreciate kid's stuff. I could watch 100 episodes of Sesame Street back to back. But this film was the most braindead excuse for low, low-grade kid's entertainment in a long, long time. Jim Davis should be ashamed for allowing his wonderful creation to me made into such a lousy movie.

The 3 stars are for Garfield himself ONLY. Otherwise, without him, it's a hardcore 1-star experience. You wouldn't find Calvin and Hobbes behaving this way.",1091318400,,2376,4.642857142857143

First off, if I weren't a sucker for happy endings, I'd be protesting the way John is presented - since when has he ever been lucky in love??  Yet here.. well, sufficed to say that he's happy.  At least his love interest is still the veterinarian.

What really fails in this movie is its inability to deliver any major laughs.  It does manage to pull out a couple of chuckles here and there, but overall there's nothing particularly special about the effects, story, or anything else.  (perhaps I've been too spoiled by the likes of Shrek, Nemo, etc.)

2113755,4,B0002PYST2,"That's right, that fat cat in your comic book is jumping out into theaters. Sure, it's already been on TV and videos, but a movie!? I'll tell you this. I never really liked the Garfield comics very much. I found them not very funny. I preferred Get Fuzzy or Dilbert. I did like Garfield's TV show, Garfield and Friends. I have one of his many half-hour videos. I was very cautious to going to this.
First of all, in the newspaper, it gave it a big fat 1 with the headline, ""A Garfield For All of Us to Hate."" But, the paper also gave Elf a 1 and Around the World in 80 Days a 3 1/2, so I gave it a shot.
I'm glad I did. The movie starts out with you seeing Jon's house. (Ugh, it's so ugly.) The camera goes inside and you see many pictures of Jon and Garfield. You see Garfield sleeping with Pooky. Garfield wakes up and talks to Pooky a little and tries to wake Jon up. (I remember that from the comics.)
After Jon gets jumped on, he wakes up and gives Garfield some food. Later on, it's off to the vet's office. There are 2 major things that are really weird at this part. A. The vet says she LIKES Jon. In the comics, she hates him. B. Liz the vet gives Odie to Jon!?!?!? I recall Jon getting him at a pet store.
There are many things that do not relate to the TV show and the comics in the movie. It's like they just took the characters from a popular comic and made them completely different people!
In Garfield the movie, they make Garfield a sort of more-clay-animated cat rather than just a 2-D comic book cat. Odie is a real dog that has no resemblance to the comic Odie. You couldn't even know that Nermal (the 'cutest' cat ever) and Arlene  (the cat that Garfield likes) were even Nermal and Arlene unless Garfield said their names. Nermal doesn't boast one word on how cute he is and neither of those cats (they're real too) look anything like their comic counterparts.
Next, the movie is highly predictable except for 5 year olds. Also, at the very beginning of the movie (before the movie even starts) is a clip of that chipmunk from Ice Age. Like people came to see the chipmunk from Ice Age in a Garfield movie.
But, Garfield is still an okay movie. It puts Garfield in the hero spot after Odie runs away and Garfield has to keep a greedy TV guy from bringing him to New York and making him a movie star. I don't even need to tell you if it works or not.
When you see Garfield, you'll either really like it or really hate it. You can hate everything Garfield and still find something to like in this movie. Despite my many complaints about the animation and the predictability of this movie, I give it a 3 and a half. Since you can't rate 3 and 1 half, I'm nice enough to give Garfield a 4.

Garfield was always incharacter, and while some classic bits were made into the movie, overall it was a new Garfield experience.  Best of the, the trailers for the movie did not spoil the movie at all.  Considering this is a CGI of a ""talking"" cat, it was extremely realistic.  The only problem with the movie is that, outside of Garfield and Odie, everyone else had a tendency to act out of character, especially Nermal.  Either they should have made him an obnoxiously cute kitten, or not bother adding him at all.  The same goes for the underused Arlene.

2113760,4,B0002PYST2,"Bill Murray stars in the world's first ""shaggy cat"" movie.  The plot of ""Garfield"" isn't as much a bunch of old ""Garfield"" strips stitched together as a single strip stretched to about 90 minutes.  In the story, Garfield and Jon live an idyllic existence in a small house in a sunny suburban cul-de-sac of somewhere-in-America (a huge metropolis looms at the edge of the cul-de-sac, sort of like ""The Emerald City"").  We don't know what Jon does but it doesn't require that he ever have to leave home.  Flamboyantly pathetic in the cartoon, Jon here is just a soft-spoken wimp, pining for Liz (Jennifer Love Hewitt) a girl Jon's yearned for for years, and is now Garfield's vet.  When Liz foists Odie, a stray dog, on Jon, he accepts, and now Garfield has some competition at home.  At first ""Garfield"" follows ""Toy Story"" - with Garfield as a meaner version of Woody battling the new pet for his owner's devotion.  Though Odie hasn't any lines (he's one of the few animals who doesn't speak at all) he soon proves he's no push-over.  Unfortunately, in stealing Garfield's fire, Odie attracts the unwanted attentions of an amoral pet-show host (Stephen Tobolowsky - also playing his more successful brother), and it's Garfield to the rescue.
""Garfield"" is light fun for the kids.  It doesn't have any of that subversive, frightening or just plain crude fun that marked ""Cat in the Hat"", and yet it's breathlessly edited so that it never slows down for those adults who have to sit through it with them.  Bill Murray, playing the voice of Garfield, has fun with the role - adding his lounge-singer routine from SNL to the original voice as done by Lorenzo Music and updating it for the 21st century.

It is a shame that the theater trailers didn't show enough scope of the film to indicate that it wasn't just about an egocentric fat cat, but an egocentric fat cat who learned a valuable lesson as he discovered what friendship is about.  Sometimes you have to be braver than you think you are to do what is right.

2113767,3,B0002PYST2,"Fans of the long-running comic strip get to see their favorite fat cat come to bold life in this pleasant family film featuring Bill Murray as the voice of the one-and-only Garfield.  The story:  Garfield's owner (um, primary caregiver--sorry Garfield), love-struck Jon Arbuckle, takes his favorite feline to the sexy local vet Liz for yet another unnecessary check-up so he can strike out one more time. But Garfield's easy life as the apple of Jon's eye is about to get unceremoniously upended--when Liz asks Jon to adopt a homeless dog named Odie, the lovestruck guy just can't turn her down, much to Garfield's chagrin.  Garfield goes out of his way to roll out the unwelcome wagon, but somehow Odie just never gets the hint.  But if Garfield doesn't want Odie a local TV personality does, and when Happy Chapman kidnaps the hapless canine Garfield surprises everyone--most of all himself--by setting out to rescue him.
Granted, this is not high drama, but it is a harmless, fun picture that is particularly good for kids and which adult fans of the classic strip should enjoy as well.  There's nothing even remotely offensive in the whole movie, with some nice messages about family and friendship to boot.  Murray's laconic, self-indulgent inflections are perfect for the narcissistic Garfield, and it's easy to imagine most of his lines coming right from the comic.  Breckin Meyer does a good job as the rather backward Jon, and Jennifer Love Hewitt is highly appealing as the seemingly unattainable object of his affections.  The only film element I question is the decision to make Garfield the only animated character in the whole cast.  It would've probably been better to either make all the animals animated or, better yet, use a real cat for Garfield.  As it is, Garfield certainly stands out--but maybe too much.  But after all, isn't that how Garfield himself would want it?

2113768,3,B0002PYST2,"Unless your a baby or have been in a coma for the last 25 years, Garfield is America's favorite comic book strip cat. He appears in newspapers, and there are comic room treasuries that are all about him. They finally decided to release it into a movie, in the ""Scooby Doo"" fashion. Make everything except the title character real, and then have the title character been created by using computers. The reason why this movie isn't as good as it could of been is for two reasons. The first reason is the plot. Last summer, Disney and Pixar came out with a movie called ""Finding Nemo"" which was about a fish trying to find his son in the middle of the ocean. Garfield has the plot about finding his dog in the city. The two aren't exactly the same, but they are similar. The second problem is Jennifer Love Hewitt. The women just cannot act, and she's proven so already in almost every movie that she's been in. She should quit while she's ahead.
The movie is about Garfield, who is voiced by Bill Murrey, good call. Garfield is a ""happy, fat, lazy, cat"" who only wants to eat, sleep, and watch television. He wakes up ""his human"" Jon every mourning to make sure he is fed, and he speads his days doing just about nothing. That is, until Jon becomes attracted to the vet, Liz, who he had a crush on in high school. Garfield's life changes when Liz gives Jon a dog named Odie. Garfield senses competition, and locks him outside, causing him to run away. He is found by an old women, who puts up posters claiming that she found a dog. The TV host Happy Chapman tells the women that the dog is his, so he could expand his career. Garfield decides to go find Odie, after seeing how upset Jon is, embarking himself on a quest around the city with the help of rats, cats, and dogs.
""Garfield"" had a ""been there, done that"" storyline. The movie shouldn't have had a story. The best parts in the movie come from the beginning, or the first twenty fine minutes, before Odie comes into the story. We get to see more of Garfield's life, and his relationship with the other animals around the cul-de-sac. Those are the most entertaining scenes, but once the dog and the story started, the movie started going downhill. Billy Murrey was good as the voice of Garfield, and he brought the very laziness of the cat that mostly all of us know and love. ""Garfield"" was a good movie, but it can't be seen more than once.
Before the movie was an animated short called ""Gone Nutty"", which is also featured on the ""Ice Age"" DVD. It is about Scrat, the squrrel, who loses his big collection of acorns, eventually having him trying to catch them all in the air, and leading to him getting hurt, hit, and finished. The short is also entertaining, but it's nothing to talk about.

Garfield(Murray) is a fat lazy happy cat. He hates Mondays and loves lasagna. He lives with his happy owner Jon(Meyer). They have a pretty simple life and both seem to be happy.
One day when Jon takes Garfield to see the vet. He's been doing it a lot lately because of the veternarian Liz(Jennifer Love Hewitt) who he has a crush on and has had since high school. Liz likes Jon and thinks he's a good pet owner. She gives him a dog Odie to take care of alongside his feline Garfield.
Garfield protests to the dog and does everything he can to make it leave. One day Jon and Liz go to a dog show. Odie under the chaotic circumstances that Garfield causes at the show ends up winning first prize as the best dog. Odie is spotted there by Happy(Tobolowsky) whos is a tv personality looking for a dog for his big act. He wants Odie for his own and is upset when Jon won't sign with him.
Garfield being jealous of Odie has a small accident at the house when they get home. Jon is made and throws hime out. Odie feeling bad for Garfield goes outside to comfort him, and that where Garfield traps him outside. Odie runs away from home and the search for him is on. He is found by Happy who plans on using the dog for his own good. It's now up to Garfield to save the day and find Odie so Jon can stay with Liz.
I liked the CGI that they used for Garfield. It reminds me a lot of Scooby Doo, though this is a much better movie. Bill Murray is the perfect guy to voice Garfield. Garfield is the epitome of sarcasm and nobody in the world is as sarcastic as Murray. He does a perfect job with as the voice and I love it when he sings.
I liked Meyer as Jon. He wasn't quite enough of a loser, but he did a good job. I loved Jennifer Love Hewitt. She's hot and she really is in the movie. Jon in the comic strip would never have gotten a girl like her, but I'm not going to complain that she was in this.
This is a great family movie. My broters and sisters liked it a lot. Hardcore Garfield fans aren't going to like this one a lot. However if you want to take the kids to a good clean movie than this is it. It's a fun 90 minutes at the movies. Don't miss out on it.",1087430400,9,2538,4.047713717693837
2113773,1,B0002PYST2,"I blame myself for this.  I knew from the trailers that the movie is going to be bad, and I wanted to avoid this movie with as much common sense as I have, but no. No, I just had to not resist my gaff obsessions with the comic strip character I grew up and love for years, and like a geeky fanboy that I am, rushed to the nearest cinema and see it.  And now, I want to beat the snot out of my fanboy-ish self!
[REVIEW]
20th Century Fox, I ask of you: why?  Why did you do this to me, and to the fans?  Do you think this is suppose to be funny?  Okay, Garfield: The Movie suppose to be, but I'm not laughing.  Sure, a theatrical Garfield film is a good idea...if it's 2-D animated, or maybe a 5-minute short for a much better family film.  But a live-action/3-D animation resembling the style of  ""Scooby Doo"", right away, it leads to personal negative presumptions.  So I watched this movie, presuming it's going to be bad, but no way was I aware how this movie has sunk even deeper into the kitty litter.
Garfield was the pet of the house, owned by Jon, until another pet comes around named Odie, and from then gains attention to the crowd more than the cat.  The fat feline became jealous, and just kicked the dog out of house, and later the dog was captured by a notorious newscaster named Happy.  Jon was sad that the dog was missing, and it soon affect Garfield, so the cat was set out the find the dog and--blahdda-blahdda-slab, yeah, it's the same plot coming straight from ""Toy Story.""  The movie could've just add some energy and some devoting fun to excuse the poor overused storyline, unfortunately, none of those, not even a hint of, exist in this movie, even if Garfield and Odie were reduced to follow the clich? G-rated dance-a-thon in one scene and another.  It's a family comedy, and I was leaving the theater sobbing instead of laughing.  That's a bad thing.
This is suppose to be a movie based on a comic strip, right?  So why is it that the comic-strip part seems lost in the movie translation?  Speaking of ""lost in translation"", Bill Murray really isn't the right guy to voice a character like Garfield.  He got the smart-aleck thing right, but the tone is entirely different.  Bill's voice seem uplifting and sleek, while Garfield has a more pessimistic, stuffy vocal (Okay, I'm comparing Bill's voice with the one from the 80s cartoon series, but I believe the cartoon Garfield's voice much relates to the comic-strip character).  And speaking of the voices, that's one of many problems on the comic-to-movie translation: the pets don't speak in the comics, they thought-spoke; there's a big difference between those two.  The pets THEMSELVES are another big screw-up: they just don't look like there comic counterparts; Nermal isn't the cute Nermal I know, and Odie is not close of being the laughable mutt. Using real pets is just the crew's way of being cheap; if your gonna make a crappy CG version of Garfield, why not make a crappy CG version of the other pets?  The same problem goes with the brain-dead cast.  Breckin Meyer as Jon...who hired this guy?  He's the biggest screw-up in the transition of comic-strip to movie.  The Jon I read in the comics isn't hot, he's a total dork, he doesn't get any girl, especially not to Jennifer Love Hewitt, and he doesn't sleep with Amy Smart on ""Road Trip.""  I can continue bragging, but you get the idea.
This cat got my tongue, but not only that, it got my dignity, my childhood enjoyment, and 90 minutes of my life that I'll never gain back.  It's not funny, it's empty, annoying, and even worse to a Garfield fanatic like myself, Garfield: The Movie nays almost anything from its comic-strip  ounterpart...except for Garfield hating mondays and having a teddy bear named Pookie, but is that enough to save this disaster?  Oh, what am I saying?  For all I said, I'm sure that a certain audience would find something to love with this movie...and that certain audience is under ten, sugar-obsessed, and mostly illiterate who are unfamiliar with its origins (no offense to your children, loving parents).  It could be just me not enjoying this movie because I might be a little unfair and serious with it.  Nah, it's the movie; it's terrible.  Do yourself a favor, fans and individualists alike, avoid this like Garfield avoids raisins.
(I wouldn't like to see how the ""Calvin and Hobbes"" fans react if their movie is going to be like this.  They should be thankful that's not gonna happen anytime soon.)",1087171200,2,4479,4.579673776662484
2113774,3,B0002PYST2,"Garfield: The Movie is a fairly straightforward story with no secondary tales or other touches that could take this film out of kidvid.  The interaction between the animated Garfield and the real actors and sets is subtle, rather than the eye-popping wow! of Who Framed Roger Rabbit.  Unlike better family films such as Shrek or Finding Nemo, this one is strictly for kids as there is little to keep an adult's interest.
The movie starts out with a few scene-setting vignettes, brief unconnected tales much like the Jim Davis comic strip the movie was lifted from.  But right away something is amiss.  Jon, Garfield's human, isn't presented as a complete loser.  He lives in a very nice house in an unspecified part of the midwest that looks suspiciously like Oak Park or a similar John Hughes location.  The furnishings are tasteful and reasonable quality.  And Jon isn't completly incompetent in his day to day actions.
And what's worse, Jon's unrequited feelings for Garfield's veterinarian, Liz, are not thrown in his face (as per the strip) but returned within the first 20 minutes.  The vet character is just as wrong as Jon; both are cute, thin, and dress well.  Jon should be a zhlub, Liz should be strictly business.  Here, Jon's a heartthrob and Liz dresses like she's on her way to a disco.  Wrong, wrong, wrong!
The major plot point is okay (evil cable-TV animal show host kidnaps Odie after dog wins a blue ribbon, Garfield rescues him), the animated Garfield is done well, and the status quo is preserved.  My kid liked it okay.  But I would not advise anyone over 12 to watch this unless accompanied by an interested elementary schooler.  14 June 2004 by mad-haus",1087171200,15,1678,4.78125
2113775,5,B0002PYST2,"Having been a fan of Garfield for as long as I can remember, I have been eagerly awaiting this movie for months.  I was not disappointed and can hardly wait to see it again as soon as possible.
Garfield's voice has passed from the late Lorenzo Music to Bill Murray with great success.  Murray has successfully captured all the subtle nuances of the tubby tabby as Garfield reveals his love/hate relationship with Odie, his disdain of Jon balanced with his desire to be #1 in his care-giver's life, and, of course, his love of lasagna, tv, and self.
What we loyal readers of Garfield may not have realized is that the Fat Cat is a smooth dancer as he gyrates, swings his tail, and even does an astonishingly good imitation of Elvis.
The plot takes us back to the day Odie came into Garfield and Jon's lives and of the jealousy that Garfield felt for the intruder in his happy home.  Also present are Pooky, Nermal, and Arlene. Though Nermal is far different from the cute little kitten who appears in the strips, he still is the butt of Garfield's not-so-nice little tricks.  On the other hand, the animation of Garfield is just right as is the moviemaker's ability to integrate a cartoon cat into a world of real humans and animals. Speaking of humans, Jon and Dr. Liz the Vet have had personality upgrades from the strip.  Jon loses much of the geekiness but retains the innocence and even gets a chance with Dr. Liz---something that's never happened in the daily strip.
There are plenty of laughs in this and I had a totally good time watching the full hour and twenty-five minutes.",1087084800,33,1584,4.563380281690141
2113776,3,B0002PYST2,"This is a fun movie to take the family to.  Bill Murray as Garfield really strikes the right chord and, for once, letting the movie go to the dogs is a good thing.  The people in the movie are merely supporting characters.  Garfield is funny and enjoyable and, if you like him in the comics, you'll like him here.  Wish they could've found a dog that looked more like Odie though.  It's worth a watch!",1087084800,,401,4.293333333333333
2113777,1,B0002PYST2,"Sometimes it is not a good idea to turn a lovable cartoon character into a full length feature film.  This was one of those times.  From the beginning of the film the story plodded along, never really capturing, never making me care.  I saw the film with my sons, 9 and 12, and they were duly unimpressed as well.  In fact, there were few laughed from the entire audience throughout.  I rank the film up there with ""Howard the Duck"" for poor plot and meaningless characters.  I was very sorry I spent the money.  I wouldn't even recommend watching it when it comes out on DVD.  It is a complete waste of time",1087084800,5,608,4.31858407079646
2113778,3,B0002PYST2,"CGI has allowed another classic character to come alive on the big screen.  This time it comes in the form of that fat cat, Garfield.  Even though Garfield cannot compare to CGI created armies of humans, an ex-hobit Gollum, or stampeding dinosaurs, Garfield is probably the best animal character I have seen (compared to the likes of Scooby Doo, Kangaroo Jack, etc.).  It would have been nice to have seen a CGI Odie to make him look more like the cartoon strip, but I suppose that would take away from the star, and the real dog grows on you anyways.
As for the story, here it goes.  The film starts out with pictures of the life of Garfield from small kitten to the cat he has become.  A fan of the franchise could not help but smile during this panning of pictures.  We are quickly introduced to Jon Arbuckle (Brekin Meyer) and the surprisingly attractive veterinarian Liz (Jennifer Love Hewitt) that just happens to be the love of Jon's life, aside from Garfield of course.  Here, Jon takes in Odie.
Odie is quickly introduced to his new home, shown the ropes, and treated very well.  This makes Garfield feel a little like he has been left out and decides he doesn't really care much for the canine.  One night, Odie is lost and a search and rescue must take place.  It turns out that Odie has been picked up by the movie's villain Happy Chapman (Stephen Tobolowsky).  Happy is a struggling cat food marketer who needs a dog, Odie, to become more famous.  So, Garfield, Jon, and Liz each try to find Odie on a chase of tricks, turns, and laughs.
Garfield is not a great movie in any way.  However, the movie did make me smile and there were a couple of parts that had me laughing.  One was the dance sequence that can be seen on the trailers.  One reason I may have been laughing was because the rest of the audience was laughing.  I have been told it is contagious.  Nonetheless, it was one of the better scenes.  There is also cute scenes involving Garfield in his bed with his teddy bear, Pookie.  Garfield also provides some one-liners and little spots that I won't discuss in order not to ruin them.
One thing I must praise is hiring Bill Murray as the voice of Garfield.  There is just something about Bill Murray that can make a person laugh.  It doesn't matter how bad the movie is, something about him draws a person to his character, even if he is disguised as an overweight, orange cat.  The way he can deliver a line really gives Garfield the personality that he needs.  Even if the movie has pepped him up a little from his normal eat, sleep, watch tv day.
A problem with the film is the running time, at a short 85 minutes.  Of course, some of this is the ending credits.  Anyhow, that's not enough to not recommend seeing it at least once.  As mentioned, some parts can't help make fans smile, kids will love it, and it should introduce the cat to new young fans.",1086998400,3,2883,4.402646502835538
2113779,3,B0002PYST2,"Ok, this is not the comic strip. Get that out of the way. The CGI Garfield is cute, but the real-life dog Odie is cuter (and sweeter). There are very few really funny moments in this movie, but at least we get to see the gang in real life. Bill Murray does a good job with the voice of Garfield (though he sounds bored most of the time). The plot is pretty thin too. At any rate, this deals with how Jon got Odie (after Garfield of course) and their first real adventure together. All in all, a cute film with only one use of profanity when the Happy Guy is bursting into his dressing room at the beginning. Otherwise, it's as family-friendly as it can get. The kids will probably love it, but adults may get tired of it quickly.",1086998400,,729,4.177304964539007
2113780,5,B0002PYST2,"It has been a long time since the famous cartoon cat Garfield has been dreamed of entering the Hollywood stage. I would give this cat a tremendous round of applause for his performance as the cat with personification. (He talked like humans, yet retained much of original actions of a cat. Truly lovable!) In whole, the movie is definitely full of laughs and tons of fun.
First of all, the cat has done an excellent job on the animation within the real world and Bill Murray marvelous imitations on conversations. Originally, this cat has black stripes in cartoon, which looked pretty nice. If it is done the same way in animation similar to characters made by Pixar (like Toy Story 1 and 2 and Finding Nemo), Garfield would be a tiger! Fortunately, the cat is painted in dark orange stripes, which gives the cat a very handsome look. Also, Bill Murray had the best voice in imitating Garfield. His humor, wits, and quick thinking enable him to make the whole movie extremely entertaining. Bravo, Garfield and Murray!
Second of all, Breckin Meyer and Jennifer Love Hewitt have performed lovely from the beginning to the end. Meyer, who played Jon Arbuckle, may not be the most handsome of all actors, his innocent and clean-shaved look and romantic act really suits the love story within the film. Hewitt, who played Dr. Liz Wilson, has the talent to treat Garfield, Odie, and Jon with profound respect. Not an easy job. They both end with working together to rescue Garfield and Odie from the main antagonist Happy Chapman. Way to go, Meyer and Hewitt.
Finally, the whole story really has lot of funny scenes and unstoppable laughs from the start to the end, with well organized sequence. Garfield's life was turned up-side-down when Jon, the owner of Garfield, adopted the dog Odie. Garfield wanted Odie to be out for life. Later, Odie was ""kidnapped"" by Mr. Chapman with his villainous plans to put Odie into the pet food commercial. Garfield realized Odie was in danger; therefore, the fat cat had to ""jump"" out of his couch and went to the city to rescue Odie before it was too late. This cat had met with many different obstacles that he had to challenge, yet he eventually showed courageous act to stop the evil from taking Odie. This movie really taught us some lessons of our life. It tells us (1) never give up all the time and you may be able to reach your goal sooner or later, and (2) love those around you, even your enemies, by understand each other objectively without rebuke and insult.
""Garfield: the Movie"" is the movie you and your family can enjoy. Watch it as soon as possible and you will truly understand that this movie is not boring. Do not believe in other people's criticism about the movie; those people may have not seen the movie before but, rather, they prejudge the movie before they start watching. Believe in yourself and watch the movie. I give the movie five stars. Garfield rules!",1086912000,,2918,4.678988326848249
2113781,2,B0002PYST2,"Though not in my top ten list of the worst movies ever made, Garfield is still godawful.  I went to see it with my nine-year old brother and though he claims to have liked the film I think he'll forget he ever saw it tomorrow.
The stars, Breckin Meyer and Jen Love Hewitt, provide very little to the humor or plot to the film.  Both seem to know that they are of no importance in the film and don't even try to act like it.  Their small love story is insignificant and they have no romantic chemistry, though both try, to the best of their abilities, to wield their shy (and sometimes charismatic) charms to have the audience care about them.
The kids I saw this film with were mainly impressed, not with the star of the movie, but rather with the little dog that played Odie.  His physical comedy got the most laughs out the kids.  His big eyes, dancing (a.k.a. jumping on his hind legs) and Garfield's constant abuse towards him got the most laughs out of the audience.
Billy Murray, though well casted as the wry, and cynical Garfield, needed a better script to get more out his role.",1086912000,6,1087,4.361386138613861
2113782,5,B0002PYST2,"I just saw this movie today, first showing at my neighborhood theatre. I am a 19 years old and not a nine year old. I have been a fan of Garfield off and on all through my life. I was super excited to see this movie, and on the whole it did not disappoint.
Yes, some of the one-liners were a bit lame, and I was rolling my eyes at some of them, yet it all seemed to work. Bill did a wonderful job with the voice of Garfield, it almost seemed like Lorenzo Music was smiling down at Bill while in the recording studio.
The plot in my opinion was quite amusing. Jon brings home a new dog, Odie and it Garfield doesn't like that, so Garfield locks Odie out of the house one night because of jealousy. Odie being a dog goes chasing after Happy Chapman, who was riding a scooter past the house. Odie ends up kidnapped by Happy, who wanted Odie for an act, after Happy saw Odie dance.
This plot makes for some wild hijinks in the Big Apple, for Garfield goes on a chase to resue Odie from the clutches of the Evil Happy, which I admit is a very cool name for a villian.
Since I'm not a fan of Jennifer Love Hewitt, I really didn't care for her portrayal of Liz, I much prefer the mean Liz who refuses John. Brekin Myer did a good job with John, I believe that with more roles geared towards adults, he will become a great hearthrob.
It didn't really bother me about Nermal or Arlene, because the story really didn't revolve around them. I really enjoyed this movie, although a bit cheesy it was a nice change from Troy and Harry Potter. I highly recommend it to everyone who wants a good laugh.",1086912000,,1587,4.1558441558441555
2113783,5,B0002PYST2,"Okay, let me paint a picture for you: Bill Murray, instead of doing the incredible job he does as the voice of Garfield in GARFIELD: THE MOVIE, is cast, like Jim Carrey in HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS and Mike Myers in THE CAT IN THE HAT, to cavort from scene to scene in a padded orange-striped cat suit, gulping down lasagna, lying around and kicking the dog.  How does that sound? Way too scary for me! If you were smart you'd agree and realize that such a nightmare would have only taken place twice before: with Carrey and Myers in each of their nightmarish roles!

No, GARFIELD: THE MOVIE is absolutely hilarious, splendidly showcases Murray's considerable vocal talents and brings Garfield, the master of mischief, to life most appropriately. GARFIELD ably proves that a voice can carry a part without the pain of having to watch a human fail miserably at trying to assume the proportions of a cartoon. Hopefully the Seuss people were watching and taking note how it should be done.",1086912000,,991,4.689655172413793
2113784,1,B0002PYST2,"I saw a sneak preview of this tonight, and was amazed at how bad it was. Bill Murray, what were you thinking? I don't think there's ever been as huge a quality gap between successive lead roles as between ""Lost in Translation"" and ""Garfield.""
What can I say. The jokes fall flat, Nermal's voice is all wrong, and what happens between Jon and Liz is... well, let me put it this way. What would you think if Charlie Brown were to talk to the little red-haired girl, of if Schroeder gave Lucy a present on Beethoven's birthday? Such things are just not supposed to be!
The only good thing about this movie was being able to look at Jennifer Love Hewitt walking around in some rather short, tight dresses.
The kids in the audience seemed to be enjoying themselves enough, but they enjoyed the ""Gone Nutty"" short that preceded the feature a *lot* more. What a disaster. Adults, only go see this if you have to because of your kids.",1086566400,,926,4.452941176470588
