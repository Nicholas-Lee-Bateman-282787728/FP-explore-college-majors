1386686,2,B000050YL3,"It's bizarre to watch this version. The music is there in its classical essence, but the costumes and scenery are set in a modern time period and are ugly and weird-looking.
The overture doesn't play to its end, but is melded into the first act. Tannhauser is on stage during the overture, to which has been added a sort of ""dream-ballet"" as in Oklahoma, during he wanders around,lost, and is tempted by Venus and her nymphs, who are partly nude, depicting the decadent atmosphere of Venusberg. OK so far.
But when he returns to the real (?) world, the castle in Thuringia is the same ugly setting, and the minstrel knights are a bunch of thugs in dingy gray.
The pilgrim's chorus is done by a bunch of people in dark gray work clothes. Again, the music sounds great, but the odd setting is a distraction.
Waltraud Meier makes a good Venus, and Jan Hendrik Rootering is a great Landgrave. Rene Kollo as Tannhauser sings well, but he looks too much like a bum to be a minstrel knight.
All in all, the visual distractions make this rendition not very entertaining.",1060041600,8,1062,4.56544502617801
1386687,4,B000050YL3,"As for the visual aspect of this ""Tannhuser"", it is dominated by gloom and a lack of colour to the point where it often looks like a black-and-white show.
The creatures living in the Venusberg look fleshy but hardly appetizing. ""La chaire est triste"" in this lovenest, and one wonders why Tannhauser went there in the first place. Wagner never suggested that his hero came from Mars, so why should he have felt attracted by that naked woman crawling over the scene and showing off her huge green (!)Bavarian buttocks?
Having fled this inferno (where boredom seems to be the greatest torment), our hero is supposed to find the colours and vigour of nature, but the real world is just as dark as the one he has left behind. There is no sign of hope in this opera (even the pilgrims come back dressed in black, just as they were before), so the only way out is death. All the more as Tannhauser's former friends are depicted as a bunch of unpleasant hypocrites, oddly dressed of course (I've got so used to these weird costumes that I hardly notice them anymore. Let's just be thankful they kept the scuba-diving equipment for next time).
The singing and acting is quite convincing on the other hand.
Meyer, Rooterink, and Weikl are excellent. Unlike other reviewers I do think Kollo sounds slightly past his prime. Some passages sound forced, and I prefer Windgassen anyway...
The biggest surprise for me wass Nadine Secunde. The prayer at the beginning of the third act moved me to tears. Here the bleak setting (not to mention the clothes) provided a potent contrast to the pure and deeply sensitive voice that brings light into this darkness.
The orchestra and chorus is very good. I love Mehta's interpretation of the prelude to the Third Act (the horns are magic)
All in all, I recommend this work in spite of its shortcomings. The overall quality is very good.",1045267200,16,1864,4.685975609756097
1386688,3,B000050YL3,"I was soon put off before the overture comes to an end. The venusburg was like a madhouse, and the crowd in the great singing hall was like just running out from a madhouse... Call me closed-minded, but I am fed up with these stage directors who simply produce ridicules and distractions to the music.
Kollo is admirabe except a bit restrained in the high range of his tone. Meier is a (fatally) seductive venus. Weikl, like a psychiatrist, is reliable as usual. Secunde is a superb Elisabeth. All in all, they deserve a much better staging.
Those who still do not have any Tannhauser on vedio should wait for the 1978 Bayreuth production (currently in LD format).",998352000,11,664,4.635593220338983
1386689,4,B000050YL3,"When American soprano, Nadine Secunde, appeared as Elisabeth in act II of this Munich production of Tannh&auml;user, I was transfixed. ""She looks like she is straight out of a '30's production,"" I thought. Could this have been what Kirsten Flagstad's debut in the MET felt like to her unsuspecting audience? How do you describe a star? Whatever it takes to be one, Ms. Secunde has got it. It is not only her voice and magnetic stage presence. She has this rare dramatic quality that hypnotizes you and makes you forget everything else. Despite this, she has performed for years, generally, to mixed reviews.
This is rather shocking. How can the existence of a talent of this order go unannounced by headlines in the media? All anyone has ever been hearing for the past half-century is that, ""there are no great Wagnerian voices these days.""  The truth is that some of today's young singers surpass their distinguished predecessors. The reason that they do not receive the same kind of adulation as these earlier legends is twofold. First, the public is conditioned by reissued recordings and has become less receptive to new talent. This rigidity, shaped and nurtured by technology, is unprecedented in the history of the performing arts. The second reason is that, in the opinion of a number of performers, the music and recording industry is a Mafia. This explains why some singers are regulars on every other new recording (e.g. C.S.), while others languish.
Another pleasant surprise on this DVD is Ren&eacute; Kollo. When he recorded this Tannh&auml;user he had been singing the role for a quarter of a century. I expected him to be beyond his prime. However, my impression was that even though his voice was not as youthful sounding as on the '71 Solti set, he compensated with better discipline. The impetuous quality of his sound production on the Solti was in character. It had its charms.  Though, it was somewhat annoying beyond a certain point, particularly with the occasional deficiency of vibrato. His conception of the role here is more detailed and controlled. Personally I prefer the wisdom of experience he brings to the role in this performance to his histrionics on the Solti set.
The rest of the cast is first rate. Waltraud Meier and Bernd Weikl are incomparable. Zubin Mehta conducts this score as if he had been doing it all his life. He supports the singers without drowning them, maintains just the right level of drama and does not use it as a vehicle of his ego to make a statement about the meaning of life. It is quite amazing to recall that only twenty years earlier Mehta was struggling to be taken seriously as a Wagnerian conductor in Europe. After you listen to this glorious cast on act I, you feel that this is as good as it can get. But then Nadine Secunde appears in act II, and the rest is history.
I lack the erudition, the refinement and the cultural sophistication to comment on the bizarre sets and d&eacute;cor.
There are now three Tannh&auml;users on DVD. This one has the best voices and the best sound. The Naples production benefits from film director Werner Herzog's genius and is reviewed separately. Compared to these two the MET's is shockingly traditional, in the best possible sense. It is a throwback to how a lavish Tannh&auml;user may have looked a hundred years ago. The dark lighting serves to highlight the romanticism. The major drawback of the MET production is the poor German diction of the tenor, Richard Cassilly. He also sounds strained. Picture quality on the MET is in line with other Pioneer Classics reissues-grainy. It is much better on the other two Tannh&auml;user DVD's.",987465600,47,3647,4.852327447833066
1386690,3,B000050YL3,"If you have never heard Wagner or this opera, skip this one. What you see is so ugly that it affects your perception of the music, as Wagner thought it would. And no, I am not so close minded as to be against an ugly presentation on principle; quiet the contrary. But I am against the inability of an artist of getting out of his mold. An artist has to be creative: he can not present ugly work just for the sake of being original.
There is value in that respect in the presentation of the first act and the Venusberg as it was described. Why should hell be beautiful? But the celebration of singing in the second act, should have been a celebration if only to emphasise the hero's downfall. Instead, Alden feeds us more ugliness because he is not an artist. Like Patrice Chereau, he wants to send us a message. Our only luck in this case is that the message was not Marxist.
Giving the music and singing a five and one for the eyes, it comes to a 3. If you have a good CD version and don't need to have every DVD version, don't buy it. Enjoy your CD.",987120000,10,1051,4.1568627450980395
1386691,2,B000050YL3,"Don't put your money on this lame horse,... unless you have every other recording or video. Not one of Wagner's best stage works,- although musically quite revolutionary - Alden's pretentious, symbolic production  reduces it to a travesty of what Wagner wanted and eventually achieved.  Rene Kollo, as Heinrich Tannhuser - a minstrel(?) lugs around a beaten  suitcase with his songs, rather than his harp,is frankly past it and it's  anyone's guess as to what they are all doing coming home from Rome,in Act  3. Only worth having for Waltraud Meier's 'Venus' - vocally and corporeally  - wonderfully seductive, and Brian Large lets the camera stay with her as  long as we can bear it. However all this is in Act1, and of course Venus  never comes back. Certainly, all very challenging for the Munich public.  Fortunately, Zubin Metha and the Nationaltheater Orchestra play Wagner  superbly, and don't have to care what's happening on the stage behind them  !",953424000,7,958,5.0

The costumes and setting are too modern in my taste. Ren Kollo who plays the part of Tannheuser is too old and way too much vibrato in his singing. The opening scene is confusing and bewildering. It seems as if David Alden had the idea of being strange for no other reason than to shock his audience. I am huge fan of Wagner and this production is a travesty. Zubin Mehta the conductor simply does not understand Wagner. Listening to someone like Von Karajan conduct Wagner, you feel the passion and emotions. Listening to this production you feel nothing. A huge disappointment! Not recommended. 2/5.",1317945600,2,733,4.734375
1386713,4,B000050YL3,"SOURCE:
Live 2003 performance by Oper Zurich, presumably from the Zurich Opera House.  There is no evidence in the accompanying package or on the disks themselves to indicate the date of the performance or, indeed, whether this set is a single performance or an amalgamation of performances and even rehearsals.

SOUND:
Perfectly competent 21st Century digital stereo--nothing noticeably outstanding or worthy of complaint.  Stage noises are relatively few and far between.  The disciplined audience maintains its silence until the ends of the acts and even the inevitable coughers are discrete and for the most part audible only if one consciously seeks them out.

CAST:
TANNHAEUSER, a figure of German legend, to whom Wagner attached the name Heinrich; a knight who combines an emotional disposition and a shortage of commonsense with a short fuse - Peter Seiffert (tenor)
ELISABETH, niece of the Landgraf of Thuringia, who loves Tannhaeuser - Solveig Kringelborn (soprano)
VENUS, the Germannic love goddess Holde hidden beneath a classical name, who runs a sort of underground Elysian Fields and who cares enough for Tannhaeuser to put up with a lot of annoying nonsense from him - Isabelle Kabatu (soprano)
WOLFRAM VON ESCHENBACH, the historical (c. 1170-c. 1220) author of ""Parzival,"" who adores Elisabeth with a peculiarly soppy mixture of courtly love and Victorian namby-pambyism, not standing a  chance against bad boy Tannhaeuser - Roman Trekel (baritone)
HERMANN, Landgraf von Thuringen, historical Duke of Thuringia (reigned 1190-1217) - Alfred Muff (bass-baritone)
WALTHER VON DER VOGELWEIDE, historical poet and minnesinger (c. 1170-c. 1230) - Jonas Kaufmann (tenor)
BITEROLF, a member of Landgraf Hermann's court bears the name of a major figure in medieval Germanic epic - Rolf Haunstein (baritone)
HEINRICH DER SCHREIBER, a member of Landgraf Hermann's court - Martin Zysset (tenor)
REINMAR VON ZWETER, historical minnesinger and poet (c. 1200-1260?), successor to Walther von der Vogelweide as leading German poet of his time - Guido Goetzen (bass-baritone)
EIN JUNGER HIRT, a youthful shepherd who sings a nice little song about the goddess Holde in her correct name, whom (s)he regards as a rather nice girl - Martina Jankova (soprano)
EDELKNABEN, noble youths, here conceived as pages at Landgraf Hermann's court - Kathrin Brunner, Sandra Kundert, Rebecca Ruegger, Katharina Gebauer (sopranos in chorus)

CONDUCTOR:
Franz Weiser-Moest with der Orchester der Oper Zurich and Chor des Opernhauses Zurich.

FORMAT:
Disk 1 - Acts I and II.  Disk 2 - Act III.

DOCUMENTATION:
What you see is pretty much what you get.  No libretto.  Subtitles available: German, English, French, Italian. Spanish or none at all.  Nothing about the circumstances of the production.  Nothing about the history of the opera.  No biographical material.

STAGE DIRECTOR:
As far as I can make out from the, to say the least, minimal information provided, the production was created and directed by Jens-Ernest Herzog.  By the evidence on screen, Mr. Herzog is a firm believer in minimalism--and not very much of that.  Overall, this ""Tannhaeuser"" is not very far removed from a performance on a blank stage in street clothes.  Considering the horrors regularly perpetrated on DVD by the hyper-inflated egos of the advocates of Regietheater, this simplicity in sets and stage blocking is actually admirable--in a very minimal way, of course.

SETS:
All three acts use a unit set that consists of a triangular playing area for the principals, base towards the audience, with the apex upstage curving upwards.  On both sides of the triangle are playing spaces about three feet lower for the chorus during the singing contest in Act II, and which allows only the upper halves of the choristers to be visible to the audience.  Downstage, within the triangle is an elliptical area somewhat raised above the rest of the triangle which serves as a platform, bench and lying space as required.

COSTUMES:
In Act I, Tannhaeuser is dressed in a frazzled suit, disreputable tie and that inevitable requirement in modern productions, a dirty and ragged overcoat, giving him the appearance of a denizen of Paris c. 1936 crawling home after a memorable bender.  This leads to an unintentionally funny moment when he is discovered by Landgraf Hermann and his courtiers, one of whom says that he is dressed as a knight and so must be one of them, that is somebody both noble and respectable.  In Act II, Tannhaeuser is still in an overcoat but cleaned up and looking as though he had just re-outfitted himself in a thrift store.  In Act III, Tannhaeuser the pilgrim looks like a gardener prepared to work outside on a cold day.  The court of Landgraf Hermann first appears in hunting outfits that might be appropriate for the entourage of a minor German prince in, say 1913.  In Act II, the courtiers appear to be stopping off for the singing contest while on their way to a Socialist political rally in 1950.  Venus is wrapped in a clingy  red outfit appropriate for a chanteuse in one of Al Capone's nightclubs.  Elisabeth is initially wrapped in  flowing gowns representing classic operatic purity and finally in a dark hoodie when she hopes to find the returning Tannhaeuser.  In Acts I and III, the chorus is decked out in voluminous and picturesque dark rags.  In Act II, as the stage audience for the singing contest, the women are in white formal gowns and the men in black formal attire.

LIGHTING:
Generally dim and cold-looking.

VIDEO DIRECTION:
The ""TV Director"" as she is described in the brochure, is Chloe Perlmutter.  Ms. Perlmutter has the usual failings of her kind, particularly an addiction to sweaty close-ups.  Video directors in general have never grasped the notion that opera is not and never has been enhanced by close-ups.  This is particularly unkind to Peter Seiffert, who drips with perspiration from beginning to end.  Ms. Perlmutter also has a couple of annoying ticks of her very own.  She doesn't trust her audience to think for themselves, so if a harp accompanies an aria--as it does in the tenor's ""Dir toene lob!"" she cuts away from the singer to show a harpist's hands plucking the strings.  Ms. Perlmutter is also indifferent to dramatic integrity.  At the beginnings of acts she cuts away from the orchestra to show the singers pacing around on stage, waiting for the curtain to rise.  (Arrgh!)  On occasion, her cameras face across the stage and into the wings where we viewers are allowed to see TV screens showing the conductor.  (Double arrgh!)  And her ineptitude in failing to capture the final collapse of Tannhaeuser is downright ludicrous.

COMMENTARY:
The legend of the knight Tannhaeuser is a medieval tale that is a precursor of the German-based Protestant split with Rome.  In this case, a repentant German seeks forgiveness from the Pope, but the Italian Pontiff gives him the brush off, only to be overruled by a heavenly miracle (unfortunately too late for the virtuous German pilgrim) that brings the uncaring Pope's staff to life.  Wagner took the story and changed its center of gravity to the sins and repentance of a not so virtuous Heinrich Tannhaeuser--although the core of the original story is still there in Tannhaeuser's Rome Narrative in Act III.

Wagner obviously did his homework in preparation for the opera, placing the once-upon-a-time Tannhaeuser into a specific time and place, then surrounding him with real people.  The opera takes place in the dukedom of Thuringia at the beginning of the 13th Century.  It might be noted that at the same time, far away across the English Channel, an annoyed King John was chewing on his beard, wondering how he could weasel his way out of that Magna Carta thing.

Wagner's research bore fruit later in his career.  Walther von der Wogelweide crops up as an authority (although long since dead) on style in ""Der Meistersinger"" and Wolfram von Eschenbach's ""Parzival"" is the primary source of the composer's ""Parsifal.""

""Tannhaeuser"" the opera went through a period of development and change.  It was premiered in Dresden with some success.  Years later, the richest opera house in the world offered Wagner a huge payday and a fabulous production in Paris.  However, a few changes must be included, most important of them being a ballet full of lightly-clad ballerinas for the discerning eyes of the loutish gentlemen of the powerful Jockey Club.  Wagner made changes but, being Wagner, he placed his new and improved orgy scene at the very beginning of the show, long before any self-respecting Jockey Clubber would deign to turn up.  The ensuing uproar should not, I suppose, be described as a riot--not quite.  Now, I have not gone down into my basement to dig out my ancient vocal score for ""Tannhaeuser,"" but the simplicity, verging on aridity, of the first half of Act I inclines me to believe that this DVD version tends toward the earlier Dresden version.

As might be clear by now, I am ... underwhelmed by the visual aspects of this production--but remember that is almost high praise when compared to my reaction to most of the Regietheater muck currently infesting operatic DVDs.

With regard to the musical aspects of this production, I can be much more positive.  I bought this set because I stumbled upon it on the second-hand shelf of a classical record shop and noticed Peter Seiffert's name.  Not long before, I had seen Seiffert in a vastly superior production at the San Francisco Opera.  I had been impressed with him there and snapped up this set as a record of his work.  I like him here, in spite of the sweaty close-ups and undistinguished production.  Oddly enough, had I known him only from this DVD set, I might have felt some question as to whether his voice was big enough in a truly live performance in a real opera house.  However, having seen him in a 2500+ seat theater and heard him cut through a full Wagnerian orchestra, I can affirm that he is justly to be included among the ranks of heroic tenors--such as they are in these piping times.

With two exceptions, I am not familiar with the rest of the cast, but they all sound fine to me.  Kringelborn as Elisabeth and Kabatu as Venus are not the best I have heard in either role, but they are unquestionably good.  I would be perfectly glad to see their names included in any future stage performances of ""Tannhaeuser"" that I might attend.  The same is true of the rest.

The two cast members I have encountered elsewhere are Jonas Kaufmann and Roman Trekel.  Kaufmann is widely regarded as The Coming Man among tenors of the heavier-voiced sort.  And it may well be true.  However, as Walther, he struck me as competent and nothing more.  Certainly, there is nothing in this performance to mark him as the The Coming Man--or anything else.  Trekel, like Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, a famous predecessor in the role of Wolfram, is a singer whom I associate with German Lieder.  In this opera, he sings with strength that I would not have expected ... but still, it seems to me, a little lacking in operatic oomph both vocally and as a physical performer.  This is absolutely not to say that he is bad, but that, in my opinion anyway, he both could and should have been better.

The conducting and orchestra also sound fine to me.  In some passages, the chorus sounds noticeably better than that.

The visual aspects of this generally dreary production range from blah to anemic--when they are not actually irritating.  On the other hand, I think that it is sung about as well as anyone could reasonably ask in this not very Wagnerian era.

Overall, I give this Oper Zurich ""Tannhaeuser"" a feeble four stars.

1386714,1,B000050YL3,"The interpretation of Wagner's music seldom causes really heated discussion among Wagnerians since most conductors are professional enough not to tamper overmuch with something that is difficult to improve. So this review will largely concern itself with David Alden and Roni Toren's contentious staging. Although few of us seriously want a ""traditional"" stage, looking like, say, an animated Pre-Raphaelite painting, we do recognise that many contemporary productions can hardly be considered an improvement on Wagner's original intentions. Looking at his works with a badly designed modern light only obfuscates rather than illuminates. We are also left with the suspicion that some directors feel it hardly necessary either to study Wagner's librettos or listen to his music before getting their Big Idea. The result is all too often an absurd clash between the music and libretto on one hand, and the staging on the other. We are all familiar with, for instance, the modern Siegfried who sings joyfully about the forest and the birds, but is seen walking about on the surface of one of Jupiter's more inhospitable moons. If I were smarter I might no doubt realise that this is possibly a statement about Siegfried's weak grasp of reality and his alienation, but as it is I simply feel that my common sense has been comprehensively insulted.

I get this feeling very strongly with David Alden's post-modern Tannhuser. Yes, we all know Wagner was strong on symbols, but Alden and Toren assault us with a symbolic world so ill-thought out, ugly and crude that they do violence to the music and libretto. These are ignored to the extent that Venusberg becomes a total nightmare and the Wartburg a physical and moral ruin. Of course, Tannhuser is ultimately redeemed by Elisabeth's love, but redeemed to what? - both parts of the Venusberg/the Wartburg bipolarity are so utterly repellent that Tannhuser's fate becomes totally devoid of meaning, a conclusion so depressing that if I ultimately felt it were true I should never want to see a production of this opera again.

In the opening Venusberg scene, set amid some sort of symbolic ruins, Tannhuser has had his usual surfeit of fleshly delights. What better, then, to create a ballet based in the hell section of Hieronymous Bosh's triptych ""The Garden of Earthly Delights"", complete with fiends, monsters and chimeras (and a bonus item, a woman-eating crocodile). But Bosch's powerful and fevered symbols, instead of adding meaning to Tannhuser's spiritual problems, serve only to distract our attention from them. Will the woman get an orgasm when she is nibbled?

This scene, however, is quite successful compared with what follows, up on the surface in the Wartburg. Alden wishes to make a Big Statement about German History. Well, fair enough - Wagner himself refers in a rather nationalistic way his country in this opera. So why not transform the ruinous Venusberg into a correspondingly ruined German city (Nuremburg or Berlin, perhaps)? The year would be 1945 - if it were not for the denizens' absurdly stylised costumes, drawn from just about every period of German history. Laying it on with a trowel. Amid the ruins and the historical burden of guilt, Elisabeth's beautiful welcoming song ""Dich, teure Halle"", becomes either ironical or just plain deranged. But then, I might say, isn't the whole population of the Wartburg/Germany living in a state of collective delusion? Beauty and spirituality are still celebrated but no-one seems to notice that they are living in hell. And just in case we are too obtuse to grasp this fully, the key to what led to such a state of affairs is written up in very large letters on a surviving wall: ""Germania Nostra"" , it says - linking in one oversimplistic fell swoop Germany, the Nazis and the Mafia. Camera angles that occasionally reduce ""Germania Nostra"" to ""mania Nostra"" (ho ho), can hardly be accidental.

The blindness of the Wartberg society and the admittedly suspiciously closed brotherhood of the Thuringian knights as Wagner presents them hardly motivate all these tiresome, clumsy, pretentious and dubiously historical allusions and devices. How much more effective it would be if the self-deluding Thuringians were to inhabit the visually beautiful world their creator intended for them. Now that would be drama!

And then there's Tannhuser himself. He's complex and Wagner treats him and his world with subtlety, ambivalence and respect. Wagner's Venusberg is hell, but it's a beautiful hell (did Alden ever listen to the music?). Wartberg appears superficially to be Venusberg's counterpoint - a heavenly place; but Wagner makes it clear to us that this is not so, and with far subtler means than slapping us around with Venusbergian achitecture. Both places contain good and bad. Tannhuser's dilemma is that he cannot make up his mind between them. He (or is it Germany?) is eventually redeemed by Elisabeth' love, for he cannot redeem himself. But little of this comes through in this grim and sad production. Instead, the viewer is bludgeoned first into to incredulity and then into despair by the heavy, inappropriate and effect-seeking interpretation.
The video editing works along with this. For instance, when Nadine Secunde as Elisabeth is pleading (with great beauty) for the life of Tannhuser, and is deserving of our full attention, we are treated among other things to a close tracking shot of one of the more weird knights stalking across the stage in a Gestapo greatcoat and von Richthofen goggles. I started to laugh.

Musically, things are as usual less of a problem, apart from the unfortunate choice of Kollo as Tannhuser (see other reviews for this). Mehta conducts satisfactorily, Secunde is good, Meier and Weike are excellent. But if you want a holistic music drama where images complement and underscore the text and music to create artistic unity and sense, then you would be wise to give this version a very wide berth.",1250726400,5,5967,5.102354145342886
1386715,2,B000050YL3,"It have a big and anacceptable mistake: The people appear dressede about the XIX - XX century. The people must be dressed as in the XIII century as say at the libretto of Wagner.
Please let me know if I can get of Tannhauser (Dresden version) where de oberture is played complete. The Paris version wasmade for the proper Wagner, in this the oberture is cut at he end and colaesce with the bachenale, in my opinion, a big mistake made for the proper Wagner.",1248048000,,457,4.3882352941176475
1386716,1,B000050YL3,"This Tannhauser production is a complete insult to the work and it should be boycotted by all!  By right it should be rated -5 stars!!  I could hardly imagine a more retarded hodge-podge of visual stupidity.  It's only redeeming feature is that it provides valid, solid evidence that most German stage directors of the present generation have collectively lost their way and perhaps their minds as well.  The singing ranges from pretty terrible (Kollo, who, caught about thirty years too late, huffs and puffs through the role and looks and sounds more like Tannhauser's grandfather) to surprisingly good considering what they are asked to to on stage (Secunde, Meier) and the less said about Mehta the better...an empty, top-line routine performance without even an attempt at interpretation...until VERY recently, one of the most mediocre of famous conductors.  The Chicago Ring I attended in 1996 would have a much more absorbing experience is someone else was at the helm.  To be fair, some of his performances over the last couple of years have been surprisingly good.  Perhaps the emergence of great young conductors like Jurowsky and Thielemann have scared the old guard into doing a bit of homework before they actually CONDUCT a performance.

Most other Tannhauser's on DVD hardly fare much better.  The Herzog production is almost as bad as this one... visually boring and with a second act that looks like more like a KKK convention. (No kidding)  I unfortunately saw this production in Baltimore several years ago and it was even worse live.

The Met production is visual near perfect, based on Wagner's own stage directions, but due to Brian Large's mindlessly poor video direction, most of the best effects (most notably the transformation scene in the first act) are lost in an unending chain of innane and purposeless close-ups of sweaty, contorted faces.  I saw this production in 1978 and it was unforgettable.  Cassily was in much better voice and Zylis-Gara was a FAR better Elizabeth in EVERY respect than Marton.  Sadly, on the DVD release it is clear that Cassily was having a very bad night.  The poor fellow runs out of voice by the second act and even had to drop several lines at the end of the third where he seems to be struggling with every syllable.  I still wonder why this performance was telecast in the first place.  It looks like a mediocre video dress rehearsal.

The more recent Bayreuth set, be forewarned, cuts over half of the overture and dives straight into the Venusberg scene.  It's visually and vocally pretty dull, though the ill-fated Versalle may be the best recorded Tannhauser in purely vocal terms.

The older Bayreuth set from the 70's isn't too bad if you can ignore Gwyneth Jones.  This woman took a beautiful lyric voice (that can be heard on the EMI Otello with Barbirolli and a pirated video of Don Carlo) and in less than three years converted it into one of the ugliest dramatic soprano voice in modern history  When she is singing she is as painful to watch as she is to hear.  In my opinion her Brunnhilde completely destroyed the Boulez Ring.  Her last Kundry at the MET was a disgrace.  Their was no audible tonal quality whatsoever on any sustained note and the wobble had gotten so bad at climaxes she sounded more like an ambulance siren.

Easily, the best DVD of the opera is one that, I believe, is only available through Berkshire Records (and maybe Premiere Opera) with Suitner conducting.  Suitner is his usual fantastic self, making point after point that other conductors either miss completely or don't care to project.  The cast are all very good, experienced singers that do much with their roles (Wenkoff, Casapietra, Dvorakova, Hubner...) It is a simple but very beautiful and effective staging (1981 East Germany production of the Dresden version) especially in the second act,  Unfortunately it is not subtitled and is a bit visually compressed, but it sounds great and the opera isn't cut it to ribbons and altered in the usual ways and it's the only DVD of a performance in which restores the rich ensemble writing at (according to Wagner himself) the dramatic climax of the opera in the second act at Tannhauser's words ""Zum Heil dem Suendiger zu fuehren"" And, best of all, it's only 8 bucks!!

1386717,1,B000050YL3,"There's only one real issue in this performance for me, and that's Renee Kollo's disastrous attempt to be Tannhauser at the age of 57.

Kollo IS too old, LOOKS too old, and his singing has an atrocious WOBBLE as he tries to hold the notes throughout. He does not star in this production, he ruins it. CAVEAT EMPTOR! Beware of this DVD at all costs. Although Waltraud Meier is wonderful, almost wonderful enough to buy this DVD for - almost - I can never watch this DVD again after the first time because Kollo is so bad and so ever-present.

1386718,3,B000050YL3,"It's too bad Richard Wagner never set Ibsen's great poetic drama Peer Gynt to music, that story in which Gynt is damned for the mediocrity of his sins and sent to the ""button maker."" Or Marlowe's Doctor Faustus - not Goethe's, which inspired several mediocre operas by other composers - though only if Wagner had refrained from tampering with the libretto. But Tannhauser comes close, at least in its broad outline, to a classic tale of the incurable wound of sin -that is carnal love - being redeemed by suffering. In this 19th Century paradigm of  Zarathustrian heroism, only the great sinner has the ""right stuff"" for redemption -- obviously a comfortable notion for Wagner himself, one of the greatest sinners of his times... or else one of the shabbiest humans. Two sides of the same coin, from my point of view.

There are not so many choices of DVDs of Tannhauser. Surprisingly few, considering the stature of the work. Two of the more available DVDs are quite old, Bayreuth productions from the Nibelungs' own film cellar. This production attracted me because of the conductor, Franz Welser-Most, whose work I respect enormously. His performance of Mozart's Magic Flute with the Zurich Opera is one of my favorites, the most intelligent realization, I think, of Mozart's vision of human perfectability. Seiffert and Kringelborn are fine singers. I have no inveterate distaste for modernized stagings; in fact, I'm not at all keen on the usual pseudo-medieval garb  worn on the Wagnerian stage. It reminds me of the hideous Disneyland restoration of the castle of Wartburg near Eisenach - Luther's castle before Wagner's - which reeks of Teutonic nationalism. So... tasteless generic street clothes? Why not!

Why not? It doesn't work. It's squalid and unprepossessing. Welser-Most brings splendid clarity to the orchestral score, but neither the singers nor the staging make visual sense. It's not a good movie per se. I don't know how one could stage Tannhauser most effectively, but this isn't it.

And as for disreputable, philandering Wagner himself, I have to wonder if a lesser sinner and a better human might have written deeper, more redemptive music.",1221350400,,2167,5.0588235294117645

I cannot believe that I am reviewing the same DVD that has received so much criticism by other reviewers?

The performance is top notch - led by Peter Seiffert as a wonderful, believable, expressive and dynamic Tannhuser. He sweats profusely - but only due to hard and fruitful labour. He is, after all, driven by lust and repentance, respectively. Roman Trekel - not Thomas Hampson as the depicted cover would have you believe - provides a heart-warming and tender Wolfram hidden behind a stone-faced exterior. I couldn't put my finger on a weak link in the cast.

The scenography is intimate and chamber play-like, the props sparse, costumes simple and it suits this work to a T. [I recently attended a Tannhuser production by Opera Australia in the Sydney Opera House, where I had the impression that all the glitter and razzmatazz (winged demons, strap-on-dildos etc!) where only there to please opera patrons who really don't like Wagner].

The recording is brilliant, the cinematography suits the chamber play set and the many close-ups allows you detailed studies of the singers mimics. BTW this is a wide-screen production - not 1.33:1 as stated.

Close-ups of singers are never to be desired, but we have little else here but close-ups (except when there is an aerial shot). It doesn't matter who is singing there is always a close-up on Tannhauser whenever he is on stage. When he is not, some other person is singled out for this dubious honor. I couldn't believe that when Wolfram was singing in Act III there was a close-up on Elizabeth's bowed head. (Perhaps she was dozing. I was by this point.)

1386734,4,B000050YL3,"This is the best Tannhauser presently available, chiefly because of Waltraud Meier, as Venus.

A major key in the success of a visual production of Tannahauser is an attractive Venus.  That's not something most of us, surrounded by political correctness, like to hear, but the essential tension in the story is set up by Heinrich's attraction to the sensual aspects of life (Venus) as opposed to ""ideal"" or more platonic or  altruistic love (Elisabeth). You only have to hear Waltraud Meier's passionate pleading with Heinrich (Rene Kollo), and see her writhing on the long dining table to feel Heinrich's attraction to the sensual side of life.

I don't agree with the reviewers who have said that Kollo's or Weikl's voices were ""past it.""  A few times, there may be a hint of straining, but generally they are excellent.

Kollo makes up for any hint of weakness through  great acting which he brings to the role of Tannhauser, especially as he taunts the other knights during the singing contest.

I was not blown away as others were by Nadine Secunde (Elisabeth).  Her singing is quite good, but certainly it did not steal the show.

When it comes to stealing the show, I'm not sure whether it was Wagner's ""Evening Star"" song, or Bernd Weikl's performance of it.  If you can watch and listen to that song, without tears welling up in your eyes, you must be made of stone.",1160265600,9,1375,4.735294117647059

Elizabeth should be glowing and her voice reflecting that. As for Kollo, he had no business singing Tannhauser with his vocal spread and wobble. To me, he was an embarrasment. Meier is wonderful -- not a pretty voice, but solid and exciting; the small item of her beauty doesn't go unnoticed, either.

The production/set is so depressing, I'm going to think twice before I complain about the VHS from the Met, although I'm not bowled over with Casilly or Marton. However, Venus is sung by Troyanos who is always a treat.",1129680000,9,651,4.612068965517241

Unfortunately, this ""Tannhauser"" has been done with vitually no background or costumes.  Possibly, going by Peter Seiffert's heavy overcoat and redscarf/tie it's supposed to be a innercity/mafioso 1950's setting.  I can't even begin to explain the occasional cowboy hat?  Understandably, singers of Wagner probably get tired of clomping around in armour, but it's very dull to look at and loses the historical romance of medieval fable.  That was my main problem with it.  As for the video direction which so annoys others, I rather enjoyed seeing the entrance of the conductor from off-stage and the performer's tense expressions as they prepared to go on stage.  It was interesting to note that for all the close-ups of the conductor's facial contortions and hand wavings, the orchestra very seldom glances up at him.

1386740,2,B000050YL3,"This production has a good deal wrong with it.  I'm not necessarily opposed to ""modern"" productions that employ symbolism Wagner would never have approved of: The Parsifal film produced by Hans-Juergen Syberberg intrigued me, and I thought that heavy load of symbolism was mostly pretty well integrated with the actual Parsifal.

Here, however, the first act has gone badly wrong.  The overture goes directly into the opening scene in the Venusberg. so far, so good; that is not how the opera was first produced either in Dresden (1845) or in Paris (1861), but Wagner had good reasons for doing it that way later on (1872--see Ernest Newman's ""The Wagner Operas"" for a guide through the various versions the composer attempted, combining his earlier and later thoughts and styles).

Where I dissent is that the Venusberg scene, which was intended as a lush and sensual ballet for Paris, has here been turned into a bleak and ugly representation of Tannhauser's despair, when he has found himself surfeited from delights he has enjoyed too much, for too long.

This makes dramatic nonsense out of the second act.  In the argument about the nature of love Tannhauser cries out that the other singers know nothing about what it really is, and he wants to go back to the Venusberg that exemplifies it (driving the action forward toward the third act finale).  But we know nothing about love or delight as it concerns Venusberg, only vacant-eyed characters symbolic of decedance, wandering aimlessly about the stage (occasionally doing backflips, struggling to carry heavy rocks, etc.).  The Mountain of Venus must have pulled hard at the hapless Tannhauser, not once, but twice, and we have no idea from what we have seen how it could have happened.

Other failings are more trivial, but I have to mention the completely inadequate ""chapter index,"" which runs up to #44 with short German labels and is without translations or guides other than act divisions.  The cast is listed, but amazingly the roles are nowhere assigned (or even named).

The singing I think is mostly pretty good, but Rene Kollo's wobble is markedly unpleasant, particularly at the beginning, and, although he looks the part, his gestures are too often of the school-play variety.  Rootering, Weikl, Secunde, and Meier are all outstanding.  Costuming is bad in places: the singers who find Tannauser on the road are supposed to be in ""hunting"" clothes, but one of them is suited for court, in white and gold.  Most of the women, both in Thuringia and in the Venusberg seem to prefer bodices (those who wear bodices) that shine like metal armor or very tight leather.

Wagner himself is considerably to blame.  The opera has two quite different musical styles, two concepts for the tastes of two different cities, years apart, and it reflects too many second- and third-thoughts.  The opera, for all its musical virtues, is badly constructed as it appears today.

I would, in any case, recommend waiting for a more coherent production.",1108252800,18,3002,4.97

Rene Kollo is a bit over-the-hill vocally here, but he still has some fine moments and his voice is simply more palatable then Richard Cassily's nasal tone in the Met dvd.  Waltrud Meier's singing is flawless.  Secunde, as Elisabeth, is very good, with a seemingly large-ish and beautiful tone, but I would not think of her as some sort of Kirsten Flagstad as one reviewer mentioned, mainly because her highest notes are not generally big and free which occasionally is a letdown, however there is alot to like about her singing here for sure.

1386742,4,B000050YL3,"I didn't hate it. . .

If you have read the chatter about this new release from `EMI Classics', directed by Chloe Perlmuter, then you will understand what I mean by ""I didn't hate it"". This new Tannhauser has met with quite a bit of resistance, not for the performance or the singing but because of the confusing direction. The biggest problem about this DVD, not the performance, is that it keeps diverting us back from the fictional world that Wagner so beautifully crafted to the reality of life as an opera singer. Set in a time indefinite (the costumes were dark and muted and seemed confused; there was no scenery to speak of: is this a period piece or a post apolalyptic era?) For those who have not seen this yet, in a nutshell, the director continuously brings us back stage to see the performers walking around, preparing and, in some cases, getting into character while the orchestra plays onstage. To some, this style may not distract (it was interesting to see what the singers are actually doing prior to the curtain rising) but for me it kept taking me away from the opera itself and placing me back into reality. The other major flaw here was the amount of close-ups. There are times throughout a performance that singers should not be viewed close up, especially if they are prone to sweating. Peter Seiffert, our Tannhauser, was literally dripping from the moment he took the stage. It was so noticable that it became a little uncomfortable to watch.

A word about the actual stage production and direction . . . terrific! I really loved what they did and some of the images were evocative, powerful and outstanding. The spackling of red throughout the Venus scene was well done and the placement of red fabric on the stage floor in an oval shape (caught from an overhead camera) - looked great. My very favorite Wagner aria (if there is such a thing) is Elizabeth's Act III Allmacht'ge Jungfrau. This can make or break a production for me. Here, Solveig Kringelborn did a beautiful job and captured the essence of the entire scene.

The performance overall, as it relates to the principle singers was top-notch; all did a terrific job and deserve mention. Peter Seiffert was a wonderfully voiced Tannhauser and remained in good voice throughout; his acting was also quite good. Solveig Kringelborn did an outstanding job as Elizabeth and carried out all of her tasks with beauty and ease - standing out among the other principles and chorus at the conclusion of Act II. Roman Trekel's Wofram von Eschenbach (named after the original writer of the prose work of Parsifal) did a noble job and made one genuinely feel for the character. Finally there was Isabelle Kabatu giving us a vampy, sexy Venus. One can honestly understand why Tannhauser would want to remain with her in Venusburg.

I love Wagner and think that Tannhauser is a great introduction for anybody wanting to explore his works. I always recommend listening to this first, as it is his easiest work. Unfortunately this DVD does not give one the sense of escape one looks for in Wagner. As noted earlier it keeps moving back and forth between pre-production and performance shots, and for me, it takes away from the actual viewing pleasure.

I will still watch this again, based on the strength of the performers, but I may opt to do some work around the office while listening. JG",1104451200,23,3363,4.722316865417376

My complains here are:

1. I don't care about those camera shots to the artists behind the scenes, i thought it was original and different...but then they were just completely OUT OF CONTROL!!, it was like watching a concert, and was very distracting, and I mean very. I just hate the angles of the cameras, and watching the director's hands only. Very distracting and unnecessary.

2. The director has no idea about opera direction. No idea about Wagner. No idea about productions. It was like she was told ""ok, do you see that guy over there? thats Tannhauser"" so she decided to stuck a camera on him, disrespecting the other singers, and for instance, making us losing the entire first act. I couldn't understand or realize what was happened on stage. A shame.

3. The reason i rate this dvd with 2 stars is because the sound and singers. THe sound and artists are awesome, and the production looks great, just as Zurich opera always does. Its a real shame that they chose a director that just destroy their production on dvd.

It is also insulting for the rest of the cast to be heard singing and not seen almost at all.

 There is not a single shot of the whole stage, so one misses completely the impact of the stage production and the scenery. This is a pity,particularly because wagnerian opera is not only singing but a total theatrical endeavor.

I think that someone should only listen to this recording and not view it, since there is some good singing involved and the orchestra plays excellent.

1386746,2,B000050YL3,"This is perhaps one of the most disappointing and frustrating DVDs I've run across. Musically, it offers rewards, but visually it is almost entirely unbearable to watch.  The camera work is, quite easily the worst I have ever encountered, beginning with the crowd noises as the orchestra readies.  We jump backstage to see Conductor Franz Welser-Mst fidgeting in what appears to be a dressing area (with the clock showing 10 past 8).  We watch from overhead - some stunning overhead shots of the pit - as he leads the orchestra in a simultaneously rhapsodic and spiritually delicate reading of the Overture, but within a few minutes the camera concentrates solely on his hands and the maestro is reduced to wrists, fingers and a wedding band.  It's at once dizzying and annoying.  Then there is a quick jump backstage as we watch Seiffert putting on his final costume touches, then head down stairs . . . I didn't like this one bit. Then we see as Venus doing the same thing.  At curtains rise we see what will be the overwhelming image for the rest of the production, Seiffert's face between his eyebrows and chin.  Occasionally the camera goes back to the overhead pit shot, or an enormous close-up of a pad on the clarinet.  It's terribly amateurish.

When we catch a glimpse of the Venusberg it is primarily a stage filling blowup of what appears to be a Victorian era hospital ward, with all beds empty save one.  There are no dancers, no images of sensuality or lust.  Frankly, were I Tannhauser, I'd leave out of boredom.  Even when Venus Isabelle Kabatu, who after a throaty sounding start pumps out some lovely, impassioned singing all we see - apart from a quick shot or two of her, is the sweating, visage of Seiffert.  And so it goes.

After taking a nap in a dirt bath and returning to earth we do get some cute interplay between the Shepherd and Tannhauser playfully throwing dirt at each other before he again collapses into the dirt.  Then we hear the hunters appear - but we don't actually SEE them.  At least for a while, for the camera remains on Seiffert's enormous sweaty face.  One becomes grotesquely transfixed watching giant beads of sweat first erupt from the pores then roll slowly down while still clinging to the skin drip in almost exaggerated slow motion.  It isn't pretty.

In the intro to Dich teurre halle, we get to see Solveig Kringelborn fidgeting on the set before the curtain's rise.  Why?  When it does go up, Kringelborn looks absolutely stunning and sails through the aria with ease (but with a little unnecessary pressure on the penultimate note of the penultimate phrase).  It's gorgeous singing.  Of course, the camera rushes back to dizzying shots of Welser-Mst's wrists. Enter Seiffert and BAM! the camera trains automatically onto him and stays there with glimpses of the lovely Elisabeth and even fewer of oddly handsome Roman Trekel's Eschenbach, however when we do see him, he isn't singing.

It's pretty much the same during the song contest.  Amazing.

During the Act III prelude we watch Seiffert in his dressing room and others waiting to go on stage, looking at each other, the floor, etc. before the curtain goes up.

More sweating - and spitting - throughout the Rome Narrative and even at his death, as the pilgrims sing of salvation and Hallelujah, the camera zooms onto the dead Tannhauser great sweaty mug.

EMI lost a great opportunity with a talented cast and a great venue as I simply can't imagine that, visually, this DVD will appeal to anyone.",1102464000,57,3511,4.739703459637561

It was obviously made by somebody who has no idea how to produce opera for video or just wants to be ""different.""  Most annoying are the constant closeups of Seiffert as Tannhauser, who is not a bad actor, but given that he is mainly shown from a distance of about 10 inches, we basically see him sweating and spitting (something one would not see from most seats in an opera house).  He is shown in closeups even if somebody else is singing (neither Walther nor Biterolf are shown at all during their long parts in the singing contest in Act 2).  It is hard to tell whether the stage production or the set are actually any good, since we never see the whole stage.  When the conductor is shown, we either see his head only or his hands only, tyically with what appears to be a nervous hand-held camera.  The video producer also shows complete disrespect for the music itself.  She figures that nobody can possibly be interested in just listening to the overture or the prelude to Act 3, so she gives us a pseudo-""making-of,"" with singers in their dressing room preparing for the performance or other silly nonsense while the music is playing.  It helps to turn the TV off and listen to the music, but that's not what opera and opera on DVD is about.

1386748,1,B000050YL3,"This is the most willfully wrongheaded opera video. Not the Zurich production; the video.  Cloe Perlemuter, the video director, should never be allowed near a camera again. She has done her best to keep us from getting sucked into this ultimate romantic opera. What's wrong? Well it begins in the first scene when we cut from Tannhauser to the orchestra harp. Wait. It gets worse. Poor Venus is hardly on camera even when singing. Instead we get a severe close up of Peter Seiffert - a decent singer but hardly an actor and no great looks. Everything is seen through Tannhauser. And throughout we keep cutting away to a shot of the orchestra from the balcony. And you know what? A distant view of an orchestra is not that dynamic. No shots of the conductor. Just the orchestra. And as it goes on you realize theses are the same few instruments from the same angle - harp, cello, bassoon. No horn, no flute. What would Wagner think? He hid the orchestra under a black cloth. As we get into Act 1 we seem to zero in more and more on poor Seiffert who by this point is sweating profusely. We get to see a huge drop form on his lip and drop into the void. Meanwhile the hunters are singing in the background. Will we see them singing? Once in the while. Indeed we get to see poor Wolfram not when he is singing but when he isn't. The whole thing is closeup after closeup of Seiffert. Act 2 starts out a little better. At least Kringelborn gets the camera for Dich Teure Halle. But we are still making random trips to the orchestra. And whenever there is a climax we jump to the balcony for that great shot of the orchestra, but now we begin to pan from there to the stage. It is hard to tell what the sets are like since we are so often in close up. The only distance shots are from that vertiginous balcony. It took forever to figure out the lay of Venusberg. Besides the close ups are often only of torsos. Singing bodies - no heads. That's interesting. And when the heads appear they are usually cut off and soon drift off screen.  The Landgraff sings off screen and that's a pity because he doesn't make it on voice alone. Instead we are treated to more Seiffert. Did his agent pay off the camera man? The whole song contest is sung off camera. Don't these singers pay their equity? So it goes. I figured Act 3 would be better since it is largely solos. But Cloe has a new trick. During the prelude when we should be focusing on her beloved orchestra instead we go backstage and watch Seiffert get ready, or we go onstage to watch Elisabeth and Wolfram wait for the curtain to rise. As as the actual act begins we glance by Elisabeth to see stagehands in the wings. We get to see Tannhauser and then Venus waiting to go onstage, Venus accompanied by more stagehands. In the Rome narrative the ever present sweat is accompanied by awesome feats of spitting. This man must have lost at least 20 pounds in this performance.  And guess what? It doesn't even stop when poor Tannhauser dies. Now we get to gaze into his glassy eyes for a good two or three minutes while the pilgrims sing. At least Seiffert does dead good. The production from what one can see of it is rather ordinary and straight forward with the trench coats de rigeur in every production today - no Eurotrash at least. That is left to the video. Is Cloe attempting some Brechtian alienation? She has certainly achieved it.  So what of the performance? Obviously with all this distraction it is hard to focus on the mere singing.  Seiffert is good, not great. Kringelborn is all right. Kabatu is a little off. The rest are mediocre. The orchestra plays well. Perhaps it is all that attention. Welser-Most is very good. Without the idiot Cloe this could have been decent. The sound is wonderfully natural. I will never return to this video. You could turn off the video and just listen but then there are many better CD versions.",1101254400,20,3891,4.421199442119944

The cover has been corrected. For the record, as it just arrived, I have not watched it yet (but Amazon required me to give it a star rating to submit this review!). The correct cast list according to the cover is as follows:

Landgraf Hermann - Alfred Muff

Tannhuser - Peter Seiffert

Wolfram von Eschenbach - Roman Trekel

Walther von der Vogelweide - Jonas Kaufmann

Biterolf - Rolf Haunstein

Act II is almost ruined, but (in the end) the torment of Tannhauser and Elizabeth still can move one.  Act III succeeds very well, as the power of the singing and the music is finally allowed to transcend the silliness",1086220800,6,337,4.508196721311475
1386751,4,B000050YL3,"The music is wonderful. Singers range from exceptional, Meier and Weikl, to very  good, Kollo and Secunde. That part of the opera is fine. The production suffers from an acute outbreak of obscure meaningful symbolism. There is a guy in a wolf suit, a woman dressed as the Bride of Frankenstein, a [body part] here and there, lots of film noir camerawork with big shadows, and some things that look left over from Evita.
The visual impact  is powerful, but to what end?  Meier's Venus is worth the purchase of the DVD.",1061596800,9,517,4.5978260869565215

7929227,5,B000050YL3,"Richard Wagner was inspired by nature for Tannhauser as in the case of the Flying Dutchman. When Wagner visited Wartburg in April 1842, he spent many months near a mountain ridge which he called `Horselberg'. This is where he completed most of this opera. This work was originally labelled as 'Der Venusberg'. It was changed in 1845 to 'Tannhauser und der Saugerkrieg auf der Wartburg'. He revised the score a couple of years later and changed the finale among many other things that included the addition of Venus and the funeral procession for the departed Elisabeth instead of a mere announcement of her death and it came to be known as the Dresden edition. It was revised once again in March 1861 and it came to be considered as the Paris version. The difference between these versions is that the initial two scenes were expanded through a Bacchanale with a pantomime written on a large scale. It also called for a ballet in the second act. Walther's song was also added in the second act. The Paris version brought out a nice contrast between the chromatic and the diatonic. The use of incidental music and choruses is also unique in this opera. It is surprising to note that Tannhauser was performed for the first time in Bayreuth in 1891.
This performance took place in July 1994 during he opera festival of the Bavarian State at the Munich national Theater. This is a modern staging of Wagner's opera. It is a deeply passionate performance by Zubin Mehta but it will fall in line after Sir Georg Solti's Paris version, Wilhelm Furtwangler and Sir Colin Davis' interpretations. Must have been exciting for the people who attended this Munich Opera Festival.",1424131200,,1665,4.784722222222222

7929229,1,B000050YL3,"I write in the shadow of all the previous negative reviews of this production, with which I generally agree. Wagner in particular has attracted a particularly obnoxious beast - the trendy young(ish) directors who, like all empty-headed rebels, think iconoclasm is as good as inspiration.",1394236800,,287,5.4
7929230,5,B000050YL3,"This is a tremendous piece of music. I have always loved Tannhauser. Zubin Mehta does an outstanding rendition of this Wagnerian piece along with Rene Kollo and the other opera singers. Even though it is surrealistic in its overall depiction, it is done beautifully.",1391644800,,266,5.068181818181818
7929231,3,B000050YL3,"I first saw this recording of Tannhauser on British TV in the mid-90s. I was only just discovering opera, and this was my first Wagner. I was transfixed! I had the foresight to record it on VHS, and watched it many times, until I moved to the US in 1999 and my PAL video cassettes went into storage. I often wished I could remember the details of the performance so I could see whether it was available to buy.

And then I found this in the public library! But after 14 years it wasn't all how I remembered. I'm more familiar with opera now, and I'm not so keen on Rene Kollo's voice. In some respects it is great - powerful and hits all the notes - but the vibrato is a bit excessive. First time around I thought it portrayed the character's desperation, but maybe with hindsight it's a bit much. The other male characters are a bit stiff (except for the odd guy with the wolf costume who messes about in the Waldgrave's entourage - what's that all about?), although well sung. The female roles are both excellently sung, and the orchestra under Zubin Mehta is great. The staging is another odd point. I'm not sure what to make of a lot of it.

But on the whole, although I'm not quite as blown away as I was 20 years ago (surely I'm not that old, am I?), from a musical point of view this is still pretty good. So far it's the best I've seen on DVD, although I have yet to see the Colin Davis/Gwyneth Jones Bayreuth recording, which some say is the pick of the crop.",1378339200,,1468,4.220640569395018
7929232,3,B000050YL3,"This production is way out there: the symbolism is obscure, the sets are ugly, the costumes bizarre, and the singers chew the scenery (such as it is) and writhe as if they are suffering from an obscure neurological ailment. The singing is however beautiful and the music as grand as ever. Wagner done well and a disservice at one at the same time.",1339113600,2,347,4.523809523809524
7929233,5,B000050YL3,"I do understand the criticism voiced in the other reviews regarding staging and director. The key to this is to treat it as a CD and to connect the DVD player to a stereo set up rather than to a TV set. Having done this, this recording offers one of the best Tannhusers of the last decades by far ...and there aren't many I do not own or have not listened to.",1333497600,4,359,4.0
