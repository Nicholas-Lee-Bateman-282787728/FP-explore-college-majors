2571086,5,B000FKP1QS,"Jumping persistently between so many couples throughout the entire movie is a technique I've never really seen before, especially in how it so effectively sucks you in AND breaks most Hollywood conventions while still being relatable. Conception earns its R rating through edgy adult dialogue and sparse nudity without jumping onto the ""shock value"" bandwagon of tastelessness and pointless crudity.

This is a sweet movie at heart, and Stolberg's ability to navigate through a wide variety of characters that you quickly grow to love and understand without the slightest bit of confusion makes it quite a rare gem.

And, for any of us who know filmmaking- shooting it in ten days (at least that's what I read somewhere) with roughly ten locations (I think), one for each couple, is flat out remarkable- and it certainly doesn't hurt to have such an experienced, likable, recognizable cast filling out every single scene: it's not often (or ever) that every single face in a low-budget movie with so many characters can actually be recognized, let alone have been pulled from some of the most groundbreaking television (and some movies) of the last few years- though half of those cast are actually working on hot shows right now.

This isn't a cliche-ridden, formulaic romantic comedy where characters are forced to figure out how much they really love each other, then lose each other, then get back together in the end- it's hanging out with real people who subtly (if not sneakily) grow on you, straight through to an ending that ties everything together in a very charming way.

Conception may be for adults, but it's essentially a love letter from parents to children.",1330214400,4,1674,4.989247311827957
2571087,4,B000FKP1QS,"Fun, refreshing look at a crazy time in a every parent's life.  A few of the scenes were a little too true to life to be comfortable :).  Very entertaining.",1330128000,2,156,4.166666666666667
2571088,2,B000FKP1QS,This movie was not good. There is no plot line and the acting is just okay. The constant skipping between couples is more annoying than anything else. The only reason I gave it two stars was because the kids they interviewed were cute.,1410739200,,235,4.488372093023256
2571089,4,B000FKP1QS,"Fun movie, funny and somewhat sexual. It seems to be a fitting movie to watch if you are trying to have a baby.",1407888000,,111,3.869565217391304
2571090,1,B000FKP1QS,I honestly gave up watching 45 minutes in.  Perhaps if I watched until the end it might have improved.,1404432000,,102,4.368421052631579
2571091,4,B000FKP1QS,Funny and prepares you for what may come.,1404259200,,41,4.25
2571092,2,B000FKP1QS,"Not memorable
Too disjointed
Lots of actors, very little story
Could not empathisize with any of the characters.
Would not recommend",1403568000,,132,5.333333333333333
2571093,2,B000FKP1QS,The movie just kind of came and went without any emotional attachment or provocation.  Disappointing.  Would not recommend it.  Gave two stars because I like some of the actors in it.,1403136000,,183,4.838709677419355
2571094,3,B000FKP1QS,"It was funny, lighthearted humor.  Related to all circumstances of pregnancy and age ranges. A one time watch to add to your list.",1402617600,,130,4.6521739130434785
2571095,1,B000FKP1QS,Fell asleep. Boring. Good cast.  Disappointed. Wouldn't recommend it. Nothing more to say hrte. Just dud like it.slow to get into.,1401148800,,130,5.190476190476191
2571096,5,B000FKP1QS,The story was interesting and held my attention.  I enjoyed it so much I watched it twice.  It was unusual.,1401062400,,107,4.3
2571097,1,B000FKP1QS,Did not even finish it. To say it is horrible is a bit of an oversell in my opinion. Where's the plot? Where is the depth?,1395014400,,122,3.730769230769231
2571098,3,B000FKP1QS,"Subject matter always holds one's interest, but this film adds a humorous twist to it all. Four more words required.",1380412800,,116,4.85
2571099,1,B000FKP1QS,Bad acting -- the screenwriting is worse.  Horribly edited.  I felt absolutely nothing for any of the characters.  Just a random grouping of scenes.,1378857600,,148,5.083333333333333
2571100,5,B000FKP1QS,my fiance and I were really shocked at how good this movie was - deals with all aspects of people trying and not trying to get funny and somehow all ties together,1377561600,,162,4.09375
2571101,3,B000FKP1QS,"This movie was not outstanding, but it was entertaining.  Basically it follows several story lines of couple who will all end up prego.  Has some funny moments and romantic ones too.",1377302400,,182,4.838709677419355
2571102,4,B000FKP1QS,"I thought this was a cute movie that sheds real light on young relationships, stuck relationships, new parents, engagement, marriage, flings and of course conceiving. This was a pretty good cast ensemble, dialouge was natural and very realistic and the movie in one way or another will be very relateable.

I'd recommend this movie if you just want to laugh or see how certain relationships may look from the outside, or want to feel like whatever relationship you're in is not foreign territory.",1376524800,2,496,4.975903614457831
2571103,1,B000FKP1QS,"I had just watched What to Expect When You Are Expecting, and this movie was recommended, because I liked that one.  The two movies were not similar at all.",1375574400,,156,4.379310344827586
2571104,3,B000FKP1QS,"It was okay, some what funny at times. It made an attempt to give nine different couples plait in having sex or conception.",1373328000,,123,4.391304347826087

2571107,1,B000FKP1QS,"I found this so called movie very boring. Nine different stories that does not add up to anything, no conclusions.",1372377600,,114,4.75
2571108,5,B000FKP1QS,"The different stories are funny, sad, endearing and touching. The ending is a perfect wrap up to the entire build up.",1366243200,,117,4.619047619047619
2571109,4,B000FKP1QS,Good story! Stanley Tucci and cast does a great job. Ending helps make the show. Not a lot of intensity between the male and female leads.,1363219200,,138,4.346153846153846
2571110,3,B000FKP1QS,This movie is okay.  It's fairly predictable and not unlike other movies with ensamble casts. Some of the individual stories are more well developed than others.  Definitely not a movie to watch if you're looking for action and excitement.,1361836800,,239,5.102564102564102
2571111,4,B000FKP1QS,I liked how it displayed different aspects of relationships. The actors were really good at portraying real life situations. The children were also really funny.,1361577600,,161,5.48
2571112,1,B000FKP1QS,This movie is less about the struggle to have a baby than it is just an excuse to look at boobs.  I was disappointed because I thought it was going to be about trying to have a baby.  I'd give it 0 stars if I could. it's so stupid that I think I lost IQ points watching it!,1352505600,4,273,3.689655172413793
2571113,4,B000FKP1QS,"This is a light-hearted treatment of the many different ways we enter this world.
The ending is particularly warm-hearted and upbeat.
Although I am not an expert, the editing seemed particularly good.",1351123200,,200,5.28125
2571114,2,B000FKP1QS,"Nine couples have sex. Nine couples get pregnant. Nine couples have babies. Nine couples live happily ever after. What are the odds? And not a flicker of doubt amongst the bunch! The happy parents-to-be include a pair of high school kids, another couple who otherwise would have (should have) broken up if not for the blessed news, and a cougar mom having a mid-life fling with some kid. Yikes. I'm tempted to think that all the R-rated hijinks were an underhanded attempt to advance some sort of anti-choice message. Nevertheless, it's a pretty awful flick no matter which side of the fence you fall.",1349740800,,601,4.788461538461538
2571115,5,B000FKP1QS,"I was drawn in by the well rounded and respected cast and gladly surprised to find a small independent film so well made, written and
at the end of the day a delight to watch. Will definitely be recommending to all my friends, especially for those looking for a GREAT DATE NIGHT MOVIE.",1347840000,2,285,4.39622641509434
2571116,4,B000FKP1QS,"I watched this movie a few weeks ago, and my memory is not the greatest.  But I really enjoyed this movie.  It was off-beat and funny.",1337644800,,134,4.115384615384615
2571117,5,B000FKP1QS,"How refreshing to watch a quality film with an original and clever concept. (hard to avoid that pun) If you're tired of rehashing the same superheros, wars, fairy tales etc, Conception may well be the film for you.

The idea that the most important and elemental part of life can come about and impact different people in such divergent ways is pure genius in its simplicity. 'Simple', however, rarely means 'easy to execute' because the stakes are high to get it just right.  Stolberg writes and directs brilliantly to bring several stories about couples, as different as they can possibly be, into one seamless and enjoyable work. There is only one common element (and I don't think this is much of a spoiler) they're all making babies whether they want to or not.  The miracle of life is perceived with varying levels of joy. (oh no! --> huh. --> over the moon!)

The acting was fresh and engaging.  Whether well-known or newer to the screen, all of the actors showed skill in their craft.  The children, of course, were adorable and brilliant.

Very enjoyable and highly recommended.",1331596800,2,1087,4.780748663101604
8124462,4,B000FKP1QS,Great movie. Lots of humor with some pretty emotional moments. Good movie to enjoy with your spouse.,1518220800,,100,4.9411764705882355

8124466,4,B000FKP1QS,"Being pregnant right now and having three little girls already, this film is hilarious.  I love how they start and end with the children interviews about conception.  I think this movie has a lot of innocence to it, even among the adults.  It is the many different ways that people get to that same point, a baby.  Only one couple from the beginning has a newborn ad it them handling sex and relationships after baby wile the other couples are on that pinnacle day where everything will change and then they will be that couple with the baby.  It is really sweet.",1441238400,,563,4.480392156862745
8124467,1,B000FKP1QS,Because some of my favorite actors were in this; I decided to watch it.  Not for me.  Too much flipping back and forth in story lines. Slow.,1436745600,,140,4.148148148148148
8124468,4,B000FKP1QS,Good movie,1429401600,,10,4.5
8124469,5,B000FKP1QS,"Very funny and interesting movie about relationships and the role sex (and ultimately conception) plays in them!

Unlike the infantile, unfunny, overused slapstick humour we're used to getting from Hollywood movies, Conception brings a good dose of witty humour we can usually find only in TV series. It's amazing how independent movies with shoe-string budgets manage to deliver what big production movies can't.

The movie revolves around 9 very interesting couples, and the only downside is that you'll likely feel the movie didn't develop enough on each one of them. I know I did, and an additional couple hours of movie would definitely be welcome.

To sum it up, it was a very pleasant surprise!",1420416000,,701,5.078260869565217
