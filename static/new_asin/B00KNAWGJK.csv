About 50% of the movie is interviews with Russians who survived the siege and it probably would have been interesting to hear what they were saying.  However, the people talk loudly in Russian and the translator speaks softly in English so you can't understand what the witnesses are saying - no matter which language you speak. Why bother translating it into English if you can't hear what the translator is saying!!  It appears that the people who produced the movie never watched (or at least listened to it).  Whenever I watch people speaking in a foreign language and it is being translated into English, they usually say the first words in the foreign language and then silence the foreign language speaker and do a voice over in English or else they let the person speak in the foreign language and they use subtitles so that you can understand what they are saying.  I was amazed to see that this came out in 2013.  Looks like it was done in the 1930s when people were just learning how to deal with sound in the movies. In addition to the terrible sound problems, all the film talks about is that the people were starving.  The film does not talk about the siege (for example, where were the Germans and where were the Russian troops).  It doesn't tell you about what happened to the buildings such as the Hermitage or some of the historical churches.  And finally, it spends about 90% of the time on the first 90 days of the siege and 10% of the time on the remaining 810 days.  To sum up, a lot of Russians starved in the first 90 days and even more people starved in the next 810 days.  The only good thing about the movie was that it had a lot of film taken during the siege so you could see how miserable it was.  Unfortunately, if I want to learn anything about the siege, it looks like I am going to have to read some books.",1506643200,,1924,4.370786516853933

8660254,4,B00KNAWGJK,"i think this was well done, put together nicely, and all around good.  this was only 50 minutes or an hour.  being a documentary i was hoping for 2ish hours.  this does have a wealth of info, never before seen footage ect ect ect.  i highly recommend.

the drawback, caused the whole loss of a star, its short.  made for tv maybe?  graffic in parts, because of what it is.  bad does not describe the situation.
anyone who's interested in the Russian front, the red army, or the siege itself would appreciate this.",1421798400,2,513,4.440860215053763
8660255,4,B00KNAWGJK,"From September 8, 1941 to January 27, 1944, the German Army conducted an intense, brutal siege of Leningrad, the second largest city in the Soviet Union. Director Michael Kloft's documentary film, ""The Siege of Leningrad"" offers a short overview of the siege. Spiegel TV produced the documentary in 2013 as one of a series of WW II films by Kloft. The film has been released by First Run Features which kindly has provided me with a review copy.

The film briefly describes Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union and Hitler's determination to destroy Leningrad. There was disagreement between Hitler and his high command, and the Germans settled on the course of deliberately starving the city into submission. The film focuses on the impact of the siege within the city rather than on military actions.

The documentary includes interviews with British historian Anna Reid, the author of an acclaimed recent study, ""Leningrad: the Epic Siege of WW II, 1941 -- 1944"" (2012). It also relies upon interviews with museum curators, other historians, and survivors. The film includes rare footage of the Leningrad and its inhabitants during the days of the siege. The visual aspects of the film are particularly compelling. The interviews are largely given in Russian with an English voice-over that is difficult to hear. It is thus important to watch this film with the subtitle feature activated.

The film documents what the narrator describes as the ""incredible story of heroism and human failure."" It portrays the starvation, brutality, and hardship of the long siege through German air attacks and a 1941 winter of unprecedented cold. It offers footage of the Russian army transporting food and other essentials over a frozen Lake Ladoga during the harsh winter and of the eventual evacuation of many people, including children, from the city. It offers a brief look at the American airlift of supplies during the latter days of the siege. The siege resulted in 750, 000 civilian casualties.

The film offers a good basic discussion of the enormity of the siege in terms of length and human suffering. It raises but does not answer many questions about military strategy, the reasons why the siege failed and why Germany did not succeed in capturing the city, why Leningrad did not collapse into anarchy even more than it did, and other questions. The movie thus offers an introduction to the siege rather than the full history. It may encourage interested viewers to explore the history further.

This documentary is suitable for students learning about WW II in high school or college as well as for viewers with an interest in and little prior knowledge of the siege. It is a well-produced basic documentary.

Total Time: 50 minutes
