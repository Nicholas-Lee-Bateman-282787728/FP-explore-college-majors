2697129,1,B000KRN2KI,"No starts would be appropriate. Broken Sky is one of the worst excuses for a movie I've ever seen.  Basically, it is a tedious mess. Almost no dialog, only commentary; when there is dialog, the lips don't match the dialog.  It's at least an hour too long.  The film ultimately reflects nothing.  You keep watching, thinking SOMETHING meaningful is going to happen -- it never does.  You feel like slapping the entire cast while telling them all to get a life.  I can't recall when I've seen such a tired excuse for a movie. I've seen many gay films -- this wouldn't so much as qualify for a bad home movie.  Save you $$.",1181520000,7,620,4.385964912280702
2697130,5,B000KRN2KI,"The first time I watched this movie, I was thinking .......what????? All that camera spinning had my head spinning, but even then something out of the ordinary seemed to scream right out of the screen. Then, out of sheer boredom (because every movie I own I've watched a thousand times already) I watched again. It suddenly was like a lightbulb went on in my head. Since then I've watched it two more times and every time I see something new that I haven't seen before. This is a brilliant piece of art. All my complaints from my first viewing have become positives. The lack of dialogue works. The slow movements works. The spinning works. And the final coup is the masterful use of the credits to give the final ending of the movie. The music and songs selected blend in seamless and the acting is superb. As with everything in life, nothing is perfect and use of lighting could have been better and there was too much ""choppiness"" to the feeling of the overall story. But, still, in a matter of weeks, this has become one of my top 5 fav movies of all time. I'm glad now I was bored enough to watch it a second time. I have a feeling I'll watch again a hundred times. Amazing!!",1180051200,6,1180,4.392694063926941

2697132,2,B000KRN2KI,"I'm giving two stars solely for the great cinematography. Otherwise, this is waste of over two hours. It's the simple story of an on-again-off-again romance between two college boys, one of whom is unwilling to commit. It's devoid of dialogue for the most part and it goes absolutely nowhere. Scene after scene of...well...nothing. The plot, such as it is, flashes back and forth to no real effect. It seems too much an attempt to be artsy and falls flat there as well. Thankfully, there was enough good camera work, lighting, etc. to keep me interested, but only visually. Two+ hours was just too much, though.",1176163200,13,611,4.828571428571428
2697133,1,B000KRN2KI,"this movie is very boring, in the 2hr and 10 min the actors only have about 5 lines that they speek. this is a very slow movie.",1175990400,10,127,3.740740740740741
2697134,5,B000KRN2KI,"First off, I want to preface this by saying that this movie is not for everyone.  There are those who like things spelled out for them in a movie and those who like a challenge, and this movie is a challenge to watch, but well worth it.  There is not a lot of dialogue in this movie and I read somewhere that the director did that because he wanted to capture the scenes before and after the characters would have spoken.  In the heat of the moment, so to speak.  So what we see are the characters at their most raw and vulnerable, and entirely naked in some cases.  Without dialogue to rely on, the actors are forced to use their facial expressions to express their emotions which they do superbly.

I have to say that I found everything about this movie refreshing.  I like the cinematography and the use of vibrant colors in certains scenes as well as the muted tones in others.  Everyone in the movie was just plain beautiful to look at and at first I felt that the movie seemed a bit long, but then when it kept going there came a point where I didn't want it to end because I had become so invested in the main characters who did not seem superficial at all.  They were very believable as we have all been in similar situations in our youth.  It seems there is always something better on the other side, but is there really?  I think the fact that the storyline is not totally linear might bother some, but I found that it made the story more interesting as it seemed to provide alternative versions or character perceptions of what was going on.

I was so excited by this movie that I had to order the director's first film ""A Thousand clouds of Peace"" which is filmed in a similar way (little dialogue, much longing stares, etc...) but I found it to be not quite as good.  Perhaps my expectations were set so high by this film.  Still, I think this is a director to watch for.  Next to Tsai Ming Liang, I think he is my second favorite director now.",1172448000,16,1957,4.279891304347826
2697135,5,B000KRN2KI,"Broken Sky is an interesting film, to say the least. There is little to no dialogue and, while the movie's theme is discernable, there really is no plot as far as getting from A to B. The lighting and cinematography are very dark and will be looked at as amateurish, which I disagree with (""mood"" anyone?).

The story is engaging enough: two young men meet, fall in love and eventually deal with what all young people deal with (is the grass greener on the other side?). The ending is ambiguous, many people will also hate that, and it's hard to tell where it actually fits with the story b/c of chronology (very similar to another one of my very favorite gay movies, Come Undone, which leaps back and forth between past, present and future).

The two leads are hugely responsible for helping to make this movie enjoyable and moving. Because there is little dialogue, they have to express whatever emotion you imagine the storyline dictates which is difficult because people will look at the film in completely different ways b/c of the lack of a set timeline. Miguel Angel Hoppe (Gerardo) has an angular poutiness and expresses beautifully the wide eyed wonder of love. Fernando Arroyo (Jonas) is sensual, dark and steely--a perfect foil for Gerardo.

It has some of the most open, erotic and honest lovemaking I've ever seen in a gay movie, which is a welcome change from the furtive glances that are somehow supposed to amount to love. You can actually see/feel the heat between the couple. There's also no angst about sexuality, they kiss openly and frequently, and no one is dying of AIDS or any other gay clich you can think of. The film takes some getting used to (could have sliced 30-40 minutes off its length) but the emotional rawness and openness are what eventually pulled me in and kept me watching. To most American film audiences, Broken Sky will be a frustrating experience, but for me, this movie is right up there with Come Undone and is now one of my favorites.",1171065600,36,1981,4.670487106017192
2697136,3,B000KRN2KI,"""Broken Sky"" (El Cielo Dividido)(Spanish, 2006) is a story of young love between college boys.  Gerardo first meets Jonas at a sports field on campus, and they are soon back at Jonas' apartment (The student accommodations seem to be much more than a dorm) having passionate sex.  While the relationship heats up quickly, it begins to cool off just as fast, with Jonas turning his face away when Geraldo wants to be affectionate when they are not in bed. When it becomes clear that Jonas is obsessed with Bruno, a boy he met at a disco, Sergio moves in on Geraldo, whom he had been watching during his time with Jonas.  Of course, Jonas fling with the other boy doesn't last, and he is soon pining to get back with Geraldo.

There are mixed reviews on this film, for good reason.  First and foremost, it is a beautifully photographed, almost lyrical story people can relate to, featuring a very attractive cast.  But the filmmaker chose to make a film devoid of almost all dialogue (Most of the Spanish dialogue, subtitled in English, consists of song lyrics and a few voiceovers), supposedly because he wanted to convey the emotions between the actions and words in a relationship.  In my opinion, this pushes the film over the line from ""arty"" to confusing as hell for the most part, since there are no dialogue references to clarify points that are unclear.  I could have also done without the director's habit of spinning the camera from one scene to the next (as if all sets were in one room), the frequent ""fade to light"" (which unfortunately made the subtitles unreadable), and the way this relatively simple story was stretched to an attention-straining 140 minutes.  Truly, this is only for the film buff with patience who can appreciate the ""message"" the filmmaker was trying for, rather than the average viewer who wants to be told a story.

IMDB lists this film as having scored a PG-13 rating, which must be wrong; the film includes full male nudity and explicit simulated sex acts.  DVD is listed as unrated, has chapter stops and no real other special features.  I give the film three stars out of five.",1169596800,84,2117,4.691891891891892
2697137,4,B000KRN2KI,"'El Cielo dividido' (BROKEN SKY) is a daring, experimental film from Mexican writer/director Julin Hernndez and as such it is bound to polarize audiences. Some will fault the film for self-indulgence while others will praise the bravery of a film of this topic to come from a country not exactly known for its flexible social attitudes.

Julin Hernndez focuses on the history of a first love and without using dialogue he tells his story simply with silent actors, minimal narrative comments which serve as program notes,  music, and ravishingly beautiful photographic composition.  Gerardo (Miguel ngel Hoppe) opens the film, a solo youth wandering what appears to be the streets of Mexico City finally ending up in an open amphitheater where his eye glimpses another lone youth Jonas (Fernando Arroyo) sitting staring into space.  Gerardo wanders over to him, sits beside him, gains the courage to touch his shoulder, Jonas responds glowingly - and love begins.  Through the next scenes we find the couple making love both in bed and in unexpected public places including the stacks of the library of the school where they both are students -and where another pair of eyes enters: Sergio (Alejandro Rojo) watches longingly as Gerardo and Jonas kiss and display an aura of passion Sergio obviously longs for.

The new couple share many experiences, all bathed in love, until they eventually go to a disco: Jonas dances with an enchanted Bruno (Ignacio Pereda) and a trace of chemistry is generated, a fact that Gerardo, watching the boys dance, senses and is disturbed.  A crack is created in their bliss and that crack only widens as they each have mixed responses to what they perceive is escaping.  Gerardo encounters the winsome Sergio and the two bond physically, a fact that forces Jason to reevaluate his initial feelings for Gerardo.

All of this story is told without dialogue of words but with a very strong dialogue of eyes.  Director Hernndez seems to want to share how love is an internalized emotion, only demonstrated with physical intimacy, but fragile as a newborn in its vulnerability to wounds.  Cinematographer Alejandro Cant finds stunning settings and lighting and sensitive explorations of love making that never exceed tasteful states.  His manner of showing time elapsing is to pan walls within a room that serve as flashbacks and flash-forwards as a means of carrying the story forward.  Film editor Emiliano Arenales Osorio uses some very creative techniques to keep the viewer guessing as to whether we are observing fact, fantasy, present or past. And the musical score by Arturo Villela deftly maintains the minimalist stance with simple phrases by cello, harpsichord, and violin, saving the passion expression for the use of Dvork in Rusalka's 'Song to the Moon' as ravishingly sung by Rene Fleming

All of those praises being said, the major reason this film doesn't retain an audience base is its length: it is 140 minutes long, repetitive, and would have been much more powerful had it been cut to 90 minutes at best.  It is far too visually stunning a piece of work to step beyond the patience of an audience happy to see the birth and blossoming and challenges of a first love between two beautiful young men.  The actors are indeed a pleasure to watch, but in this case less is more.  One wonders what Julin Hernndez will create next.  He deserves applause for this experimental film but hopefully will learn from its tendency toward self-indulgence.  Grady Harp, January 07",1169251200,22,3512,4.993138936535163

From meeting on the steps into a energetic sexual encounter.  Unfortunately, after about the first half hour, the passion cools and the rest of the film is devoted to their awkward and estranged lack of emotional connection.  They spend the rest of the film, 'not connecting' and being stressed and upset.  One guy wants to hang on, and the other wants to escape.  Overall, a real bummer depressing story and there is not a happy ending.  There is almost no dialogue either.  A sort of silent movie and the film tries to compensate for no dialogue with a lot of intense long glances between the two guys, but the technique gets stale.",1461196800,,793,4.535211267605634

Two very handsome and sexy teenagers are deeply in love, and they can't keep their hands (and mouth!) off each other, even in public places! After long scenes of steaming love and passion, one of them suddenly - and inexplicably - looses interest in the other. This leads to repeated - and tedious - attempts by the abandoned one to regain his lover's interest. His many unsuccessful attempts do not stop him from trying over and over!! Finally, he finds solace in the arms of a persistent and - again, very handsome - suitor who is madly in love with him.

All three young men are delightful to watch, and their love making (with full frontal nudity), in almost total absence of dialogue from beginning to end - is most enjoyable. Occasionally, a narrator gives a superfluous account on what is going on! Hence the unnecessary subtitles: it is practically a silent film.

The photography at times is stunning, but more often is boring and unnerving: moving back and forth in slow motion, in interiors so dark you can't see anything for long moments. I suppose the movie makers thing this is very artistic!!

Great music and cinematography accompany strong acting.
This is a poignant and powerful movie about young gay love and heartache.
Perhaps a favorite scene is Dvorak's Song to the Moon playing as Sergio pursues Gerardo in a darkened room.  A wonderful choice how the movie uses such a musical piece to underscore that their gay love is innocent and beautiful, and not at all creepy and eery as Hollywood has been so apt to portry gay love over the decades.",1370044800,2,645,4.466101694915254

Jonas figured that what he had shared with Gerardo was much more deep, than any dream relationship he could ever have with someone else.

This movie is more visual than any movie I have ever seen.  This offers a window in the lives of these two young men, where you can relate to them more than words can convey.

2697186,3,B000KRN2KI,I like this film. its so cool how there is almost no dialogue everything is conveyed through acting. Some things are a bit repetitive. Could have used more editing. A bit long.,1352851200,,176,4.53125
2697187,3,B000KRN2KI,"Other reviewers have pointed out that there is no dialogue in this film outside song lyrics and an occasional snippet of narration. I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing in and of itself. A lot of the story is told through scenes, the characters facial expressions and body language. It does come off really arty and psychological, and the story isn't all that clear during a lot of the film, but the emotions and feelings the director was able to capture without words was really impressive. All the intimate moments, and there are quite a few, are stellar. The love scenes, in particular.

The major problem I had was that the movie was just too long. There are many great moments where the emotion of the moment are delivered beautifully, but there are also long pauses where it's not clear what's going on. Better editing could have solved that problem.

I definitely think this is worth watching if you have amazon prime. I would even recommend it as a rental, if you know what to expect. The moments where the film does work should make it worth your while.

3 stars, because of the long pauses and the sheer length. It only serves to take away from the moments that do work. And those moments do work beautifully.",1336953600,,1227,4.593607305936073

2697192,4,B000KRN2KI,"Gerardo and Jonas meet each other in the very beginning and they hit it off. Quick. Before 6 or 7 minutes into the movie, they have hot, sweaty sex. It starts out as lust but grows into love (or at least I'd like to think). Apparently though, Gerardo is into Jonas more than the other way around because Jonas eventually gets the wandering eye, leaving his lover in the cold. Over and over again.

The soft, warm touches turn to cold shoulders. Jonas goes out, dances and looks for other guys. Gerardo tries to repair the broken relationship but his lover isn't really interested and it shows.

The movie isn't all negativity though. Although it is low budget and the sound effects aren't up to par, the music is quite effective more often than not. I found myself liking quite a few of these tunes that I don't know. The colors and scenery fit with the mood. I was totally impressed with the subtle things the movie did. And when the relationship was good between the two cute main characters, it was lovely to watch.

Overall, a slow watch but worth it all the same. I started out wanting to give it a 3. Then a 3.5. Then I upped it to a 3.8. Then a 3.9. By the end of the movie, it had upped to an even 4. Solid movie and probably my favorite gay one although there isn't much talking, there are subtitles you need to read throughout and I haven't seen many gay movies to begin with. That shouldn't take away from this one though. It's a keeper.

2697200,4,B000KRN2KI,"""Broken Sky"" is a foreign film that is watchable for anyone because director Julian Hernandez does an amazing thing: He tells the story with hardly any dialogue at all. In fact, a full 20 mins. pass by until the main characters speak..and even then, the dialogue is brief. What Hernandez does instead is tell the story through body language & subtle expressions as the camera follows the characters from one place to another.
The main characters, Jonas & Gerardo, are 2 beautiful Spanish youths who meet & fall in love at college. Their meeting begins passionately in a love scene that captures the exquisite thrill & discovery of love with someone new as the camera rests in one spot & watches the heated urgency between the boys. As the story progresses, the lovers' happiness begins to evaporate after Jonas begins to stray into the embrace of another. Subtly pushing Gerardo away in bed, eventually Gerardo follows suit, accepting the affections of Sergio, who has been shadowing the couple for quite some time.
""Sky"" becomes a lyrical study in passion & pain as the characters become entangled in their own emotional webbing. It's an example of what happens when you push someone close to you away...and then, when the two finally re-unite, it is too late to retrieve what was once there. As one of the songs on the track warble, they become ""close, yet so far away"".
Its ending is bittersweet as Jonas & Gerardo tearfully realize the damage they've created, although they are forever close to each other in their hearts.
Hernandez takes a casual approach to the pace, in which scenes in bed alternate with public scenes (most notably, the gay dance bar). ""Casual"" is the word; the running time clocks in at 140 mins., quite a length for a film such as this. So you have to have a great deal of patience in order to find out how it ends. The director also eschews using the ""complete camera rotation"" method, in which we expect to see another person in the room once the camera stops.
""Broken Sky"" is not for everyone. However, its portrayal of passion is honest, and its artistic range of emotion is unsurpassed.",1231804800,,2118,4.727027027027027
2697201,5,B000KRN2KI,"Not being versed in queer cinema I was a bit apprehensive when I started seeing this film. My past queer cinema experiences were not that great (Boys Dont Cry, Brokeback Mountain) so I was expecting more of the same shock and awe or apologetic BS from those other films. However I was NOT disappointed. This has got to be one of the most amazing/beautiful/engrossing films I have enjoyed in a while. Julian Hernandez is a true visual poet in a way few other directors are (Kar-Wai; DePalma; Spielberg) and his collaboration with cinematographer Alejandro Cantu, makes for one of the most visually sumptuous films of the last few years. Other users haver complained about the ""plotlessness"" of the film and I think this is unfortunately a sad side effect of contemporary film culture. If something shocking or fast paced doesnt happen every so often in a film it is quickly cast off as pointless banter. Admittedly this is a film devoid of fast paced action and a structured plot. However this is more of an asset as it forces you to focus your attention on the visual poetry being written on-screen. The lack of dialog is by no means a negative aspect of the film as all the information that you need to know is expressed in visual terms (the true nature of film).

So if you enjoy film, ABSOLUTELY LOVE the art of cinematography PLEASE do yourself a favor and pick this one up. As a supplement you may want to read Armond White's review of this film (NY Press Film Critic and arguably THE BEST film critic in the US).",1212796800,2,1518,4.580882352941177

2697204,4,B000KRN2KI,"After reading the reviews, I was apprehensive about watching Broken Sky. Turns out there were no reason to be because despite its flaws, I really enjoyed this movie which is beautifully filmed. The story is simple and captivating to watch. Gerardo and Jonas meet and begin a passionate affair. The young actors do a great job with their body language and expressive eyes. The sex and kissing scenes are natural as Jonas and Gerardo give themselves unreservedly to each other.  On the periphery of their affair is Sergio who longs for Gerardo who ignores him completely.

One night at a nightclub, Jonas dances with another man and becomes infatuated with this stranger who leaves him standing on the dance floor. Jonas loses his passion for Gerardo and thinks about the stranger all the time. Gerardo is hurt by Jonas' rejection and tries to rekindle their passion unsuccessfully. In time, Gerardo begins to reluctantly respond to Sergio's attention. Eventually Gerardo leaves Jonas and embarks on an affair with Sergio even though he does not feel as strongly for Sergio. Alone, Jonas begins to miss Gerardo and remember their love, but sees that he is now involved with Sergio. Jonas makes advances towards Gerardo who responds hoping to recapture their passion.  Meanwhile Sergio realizes that Jonas wants Gerardo back and senses something is wrong their relationship. However, Gerardo quickly realizes that he no longer loves Jonas and rejects his sexual advances. Gerardo reunites with Sergio and they profess their love for each other. Using a voiceover, we are told that some time later Jonas calls Gerardo to tell him how he regrets what happens and he will love him forever and they both cry. This poignant voiceover is accompanied by flashbacks to the boys' initial lovemaking and Jonas' encounter with the stranger on the dance floor. I am only giving a detailed synopsis because so many reviewers are understandably confused about the film's plot.

The director knowingly or unknowingly has made in this film in the tradition of Wong Kar-Wai using limited dialogue, music and voiceovers, but the movie has problems. The lack of dialogue hampers the story telling partly because we are so accustomed to dialogue, but also because by the time you discern what is going on in the scene, it is almost over and the next one is on the screen.  I can't imagine sitting in a theatre watching this movie, when at home, I had to rewind the DVD several times to catch things because there are dream sequences and memories spliced into the present day scenes which makes the story somewhat confusing.  Also, as other reviewers have said the movie is simply too long.  The first couple of times that Jonas rejects Gerardo is enough to get the point across so move on. It seems to me that directors of all eras and continents are unable to figure out when it is time to end their movies. Even with this criticism I wish the DVD had commentary or an interview with the director to get some insight into his thought process when he made this interesting and passionate film.

Broken Sky isn't for everyone, but it is a refreshing love story. We all can relate to falling in love and losing that love. There are no manufactured obstacles coming between the young lovers instead the story unfolds naturally. Also, it was great to see a gay love story not focused on the angst of coming out or AIDS or homophobia or the gay guy falling for his straight best friend.",1201996800,3,3458,4.81956155143339

2697207,5,B000KRN2KI,"Exquisite, hypnotic, achingly beautiful and utterly enticing, Broken Sky puts the rise and fall of a relationship under the microscope, depicting with blistering accuracy the pain of unrequited love, rejection and loss.

There's barely any dialogue - proof indeed that actions speak louder than words - with most of the action played out in body language: stolen glances and intense sex are the language of this piece. The BFI ([...]) says it's a ""masterful exercise in visual storytelling"" and it isn't wrong. The two leads, Jons (Miguel Angel Hoppe Canto) and Gerardo (Fernando Arroyo) as two students, are thoroughly engaging, and just so happen to be very, very easy on the eye - even if Jons bares an uncanny resemblance to Jason out of Coronation Street.

If there's one flaw it's the duration, an ailment modern cinema suffers acutely from - at more than two hours and eighteen minutes this one tests the patience, and my reaction might well have been considerably less favourable had I been trapped in a cinema for that long.
