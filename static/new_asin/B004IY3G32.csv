4389798,5,B004IY3G32,Carefully researched and entertaining while astonishing and motivating.  I showed it to my Organic Chem class for an excellent discussion.,1371686400,2,138,5.9
4389799,5,B004IY3G32,"This really opened my eyes.
This documentary explains which plastics can be harmful to your health And why!
Since watching this ive shared it with 3 friends, started recycling, and cut down on plastic dishes and utensils that I buy.
There Are alternatives to plastic.
A Great buy if you give a damn about the environment!",1363219200,3,321,4.75
4389800,5,B004IY3G32,"I watch a lot of documentaries that are in this vein but few are as thoroughly researched as this one.  Werner Boote travels across the world with his plastic globe to discover what it, and many other plastic products, are hiding in its chemical makeup.  The findings should be enough to jump start a true modern eco-friendly revolution given the implications of what today's plastics are leeching into our bodies and will continue to leech into the planet for over the next 500 years.",1333497600,,485,4.761904761904762
4389801,4,B004IY3G32,"Somewhere between any of Michael Moore's investigative documentaries and Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth, lies German documentarian Werner Boote's film Plastic Planet.

If there is one prime message to be gathered from watching this 99-minute film (packed in an environmentally-friendly cardboard package) it is that ""PLASTIC KILLS!""

Boote travels the world from China - where toys exported to the world are made from unsafe plastic - to the US to meet with scientists who are learning that using too much plastic in your house can actually cause infertility in both men in women. In all, he gathers 700 studies showing the dangers of the chemicals in plastic (which was first discovered in 1907 and is an integral part of our lives.). While some environmentalists are discussing the issue of recycling plastic bottles to save the environment, Boote's main cause is to show the effects on our health.

Like Gore (and Moore too), Boote uses animation and colorful graphics to make his point easier to understand. And, like Moore, he goes in search of the President of Plastics Europe, at a major trade show, to confront him with the results of the 700 studies he has collected. (And, like Moore, he is rejected in his efforts.). But there is a lot of technical jargon used by the interviewees, and Boote is not as ""humorous"" as Moore so the film drags in spots. Another issue is with the subtitles. Because Boote is meeting with international experts who don't speak English, subtitles are used often. These are in while lettering which makes them often difficult to read when the background contains white. I only wish that more filmmakers would use the bright GREEN or YELLOW that French filmmakers often use.

The bonus features include five brief outtakes that are interesting to watch plus a DVD-ROM ""Press Kit and Resource Center"" which I did not have time to investigate. Some of the advertising says that there is an Interview with the Director but - unless it is in the DVD-ROM features - I did not see it.

This is an important film - about an essential subject that is rarely discussed. I learned a lot from it. And so will you. The next time you heat up a plastic baby bottle or buy that toy made in China, you'll probably pause for a moment and thank the efforts of Boote to make this film.

8431354,5,B004IY3G32,"Recycling, as with most change issues, progresses slowly toward an acceptable resolution. Unfortunately we are beyond the tipping point where plastic is concerned. The oceans and beaches have become plastic graveyards. My city forced recycling by requiring citizens to pay for anything recyclable not placed in proper containers for curbside pickup. For many, this outstanding doc will be an eye opener. An eye opener.",1481846400,,418,5.546875

8431359,5,B004IY3G32,"This helps to explain why people think they were born gay. God made males and females. Bisphenyl A has changed the physical properties which determine gender. It may be a factor in the increase of autism also. We are destroying  ourselves. Our  efforts are considered in value based on how profitable they are. We refuse to look at the destruction they cause if we can make money. The bees,frogs, butterflies and other endangered species can't voice their frustration but we're going to experience the same fate if we don't wake up. This work supports my beliefs!",1393545600,,563,4.854166666666667
8431360,5,B004IY3G32,"Having already watched the documentary 'Plastic Planet' on LinkTV I knew that my purchase would be worth the money paid. Because I intended to loan the documentary to other people, therefore spreading the word, I was more than willing to make the purchase (I bought two). I strongly recommend that everyone that may be 'on the fence' to buy at least one copy and endeavor to loan it to everyone you know and encourage them to pass it on to everyone they know.",1390694400,2,459,4.542168674698795
8431361,3,B004IY3G32,"After waiting for over a year for NF to acquire this DVD, I broke down and paid $18 for it.  Werner Boot does the required footwork here, interviewing a couple of scientists and professors, and making lots of visits to plastic manufacturers.  In the end, though... we don't really get to see anything interesting, and the whole deal is presented in a dry, sedated tone.  Not entertaining, or engaging in the least.  In the end, we learn what many of us already know: Man-made stuff is usually unhealthy for us, and corporations will do anything to make a buck and hide the dirt under the rug.  I wish I had my $18 bucks back.",1379289600,,625,4.447368421052632
8431362,5,B004IY3G32,One of the most informative & shocking exposes ever on the plastics industry! A MUST SEE. Share this one with everyone you know...it may save your life.,1374796800,2,152,4.666666666666667
