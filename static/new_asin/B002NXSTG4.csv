3960559,5,B002NXSTG4,"It's a shame that Steve Coogan has not gotten more press here in the States. Ricky Gervais probably owes his career to Coogan among many other popular English and American comedians. He's my favorite character actor ever, and this boxed set is an excellent way to see all his seminal works from the 90's never seen on American television.",1295481600,6,338,4.745762711864407
3960560,5,B002NXSTG4,"A quick bit of advice for those in the US:
If you own a DVD player capable of region 2, PAL playback, then save yourself a bundle and buy this and just about every other UK TV series DVD that has been released in the US for NTSC at Amazon.com UK for Region 2, PAL.  Even after the currency conversion you save as much as 50% on most of these DVD's (US for this Coogan DVD is $119, but at Amazon. UK it sells for--as of this date--$59.00 USD).  Such titles to have been released in the US for NTSC are The IT Crowd; Spaced Definitive Collector's Edition (truly overpriced here in the States for NTSC; a real bargain at Amazon. UK Region 2, PAL); and just about every other title that has been released here in the US.  In fact, the US prices are so high, that I now buy UK series exclusively Region 2, PAL.  The studios here (Warner Video, in some cases) get really greedy.",1264982400,38,872,4.1726190476190474
3960561,4,B002NXSTG4,"If you're a fan of any of Steve Coogan's many, wonderful TV shows, this set is definitely the way to go.  You get all of his Alan Partridge incarnations (from failing talk show host to failed), the complete run of Saxondale (about the life of a former rock music roadie in the later years of his life) and everything else.  Considering the normal price of a single series of most of these shows, the value here can't be beat (and there's a lot in the set that can't be found elsewhere in North America).

My only complaint, and the reason I won't rate this 5-stars, is the packaging.
In theory, the packaging should be pretty good.  Each disc has it's own thin, plastic tray and all of the trays are connected on one side (like the spine of a book).  However, the problem is with the way these trays were produced - the production left a plastic burr facing the underside of each disc in each tray.  These burrs could have easily been filed down (I did so with my fingernail) or the trays could have just been produced so the burr was located anywhere else on the tray and not under the disc (since it's on every tray in the same spot, it must be a problem in the mold).

As it stands, ALL 13 discs in my copy were left with marks or scratches from this production defect.  I still think and hope that everything will play fine (I don't know, yet, as I haven't watched the entire set) but it's indeed a shame that such poor quality control could ruin an otherwise outstanding set.",1260230400,36,1480,4.317689530685921

8375619,5,B002NXSTG4,"Steve Coogan is brilliant and to have the experience to see a great deal of his work in this collection was incredible.
Perhaps the most underrated, on this side of the pond, comedic minds going today. If you liked The Trip movie series, I highly recommend seeing the beginnings of his comedy.",1509580800,,293,4.653846153846154

8375622,5,B002NXSTG4,I've been waiting for the price to come down on this priceless set.  Steve Coogan is a comedic genius,1470268800,,101,4.315789473684211
8375623,5,B002NXSTG4,"All persons named ""Steve"" are comedic geniuses, and Mr. Coogan is no exception. From Alan Partridge to Saxondale, from live performances of Paul Calf, you will find a breadth of that which upon you may laugh.

I believe this is the USA encoded set, but if you happen to order a UK version, try converting the DVDs using Handbrake. I have done this with much success.",1425168000,3,366,4.545454545454546
8375624,5,B002NXSTG4,"I considered writing a review, and decided I would.  Why do I love it? Hmmm.  I wanted to see a lot more of Steve Coogan's work, because I love him and would like to marry him. He's almost unknown in the U.S. and he should be known, because he's really great.  He was great in ""The Trip"", ""Marie Antoinette"", and very, very funny in ""Hamlet 2"", which I would like to share my review with you right now, but it's not in the Steve Coogan Collection. Some of the collection I could understand, though he does have an English accent, but for one of his raved about series about a low-class family in the East End, that I really wanted to see, my brain got too tired of trying to understand the low-class accent, and he probably does it well, because I couldn't understand a word. That's his brilliance and it was the part I missed, was disappointed I missed, and that's what I disliked about his collection. I still have more to watch, but I loved his, ""aha"" series, and the one that came after it. I would recommend this collection to those Americans who understand people who speak British, and who would like to know more about me and my world.",1390694400,3,1143,4.356807511737089
8375625,5,B002NXSTG4,"Because Steve Coogan is a comedic genius, that's why! Alan Partridge is classic but try the other stuff. He really shows his range.",1367884800,3,131,4.739130434782608
8375626,5,B002NXSTG4,This is a great collection of Coogan's brilliant work. Most of these DVD's are not available in North America and the ones that are would cost much more if bought individually.  If you are a Coogan fan this is well worth the money.,1300492800,,231,4.372093023255814
8375627,5,B002NXSTG4,"It isn't really fair to bring up Ricky Gervais in a review of a Steve Coogan boxed set but, as this is Amazon's American site and as the American audience for Ricky Gervais is exponentially larger than Coogan's, I would like to put Coogan in perspective for those who may read this and are not familiar with him.

It essentially amounts to this: as comedically brilliant as much of his work is, Gervais is second to Coogan on every level. Coogan had already mastered his awkward and annoying Alan Partridge on radio and television years before The Office, presumably while David Brent was still working his way up the management ladder at Wernham-Hogg. With less pathos and a broader appeal but equally as funny as the Brent character, Coogan crafted Partridge into a ""man you love to hate"" with razor sharp timing, brilliant writing (with help from people such as Armando Ianucci, another very talented Brit who has not seen much success in the States) and a sense of style somewhere in between Heathcliff Huxtable and Alex P. Keaton. Along with a stellar supporting cast the three Alan Partridge series (Knowing Me Knowing You plus series 1 and 2) are squirmy, irritating, tragicomedy gold. These alone are worth the price of admission, especially since Series 2 has never been released in the States. Without Steve Coogan there would be no Ricky Gervais. Far from being the ""Gervais of the 1990s"", as someone somewhere put it, Coogan is still relevant and funnier than ever and still doing brilliant comedy. Incidentally, it may come as a surprise to some people that Coogan is four years younger than Gervais.

If that weren't enough you also get both series of Saxondale, a show about an eccentric, good-natured ex-roadie/current pest controller with one foot in the present and one foot the good ol' days. When all is said and done Saxondale is even more brilliant than Partridge. Less broad and much more psychologically perceptive than Partridge Tommy Saxondale is too old to be cool but too cool to know it. Wearing Wrangler jeans, driving a lemon yellow Mustang and playing Genesis (early Genesis, that is) way too loud for someone ""his age"", he battles aching knees, rat infestations, the bad taste in music that kids have these days and his longing for Jim Beam breakfasts in America.

If I have done my job you have already added this to your cart. But if you are still not convinced then I must tell you that you also get Paul Calf (the staggering, drunken, chain-smoking dolt who bloody hates students), his sister Pauline Calf, Tony Ferrino (the smarmy, possibly homicidal, sex addicted singing sensation from Portugal), and plenty of other characters from live shows and other projects that Coogan has done over the years, notably the charming ""Coogan's Run"" featuring a number of one-off characters who should be resurrected in this humble reviewer's opinion (eh, Steve?).

I should also note that this set is packed with special features: all the ones that were available on the original UK releases of the individual DVDs plus one or two others that are, to the best of my knowledge, new to DVD. The only exception to this, and it is the only problem with this collection, is the strange absence of the Alan Partridge Series 2 special features.

Thirteen discs of prime British comedy, the best of which is on par with Fawlty Towers, Black Adder or any other classic you care to name.",1298073600,40,3404,4.821917808219178
