This is an interesting story for low budget movie. It warns against gambling which leads to debt. And to be careful who you sell your gold to. The price of $16 an ounce for gold dates this story to before the Great War. After it went to $20 an ounce until FDR reset the price to $35 an ounce and restricted the private ownership of gold.
