8259343,4,B0015OO1FU,"Towards the end of World War 2 a young child becomes ill. The father is still away at war and the mother does not have enough money for medicine and a doctor. She does the only thing she can to get money and save her son's life and that is to become  a prostitute for one night. Her husband finally returns home and, against the advice of her best friend, she eventually tells her husband what she did, expecting a compassionate response. His reaction is cold and brutal, vicious and violent. She didn't deserve what she got from him! Even his friend at work tells him his wife did the only thing she could to save their son, but he doesn't listen. I guess he wanted a dead son but an honorable wife. He even has more compassion for another young woman he meets who had been forced to become a prostitute than he has for his wife. Eventually there is a resolution to the husband's inner conflict and his wife's deep feeling of guilt.

This is a very well acted and, I believe, a realistic look at post war Japanese society. It is not quite an Ozu classic, but it comes close",1309305600,,1074,4.285714285714286
