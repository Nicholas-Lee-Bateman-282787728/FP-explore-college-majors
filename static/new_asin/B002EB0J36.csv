3916647,5,B002EB0J36,My 4 year old son watches this all the time. It comes with 4 DVDs in one case. That's kind of a pain but worth what I paid for my little train fan. It's narrated by a boy. There's lots to see. Toy trains in different types of environments. My son reenacts the scenarios shown on the episodes. It's great for imagination. My child is all about trains.,1406851200,,350,4.161764705882353

As I scrolled on my fire stick for a show to appease him as I got ready for dinner, I quickly chose this show, hoping for him to be content. He is obsessed!
