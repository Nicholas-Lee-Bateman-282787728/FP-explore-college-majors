8046373,5,B00079W9O4,"This absolutely the most compelling, well wriiten, perfectly acted,and masterfully produced motion picture I have ever viewed...even though it was subtitled in English, the storyline is overwhelming. I originally viewed it on YouTube quite by accident and was so overcome by the entire production...I did a search and found it was available on Amazon...I immediately ordered it and upon arrival, watched it three more times!  The DVD version, obviously, is far superior to YouTube's...the price was reasonable (I would have paid twice the price to get it!)...and delivery was the normal excellent service from Amazon. I'm a 65 year old tough retired cop and firefighter, I'm not susposed to be attracted to this movie genre...I dare you to watch it without sheading a tear...I don't care how macho you are!

8046374,4,B00079W9O4,"The movie takes on a very cliche and hard-to-stand plot: someone who died goes back for 5 days while no one recognizes him, but the director and the stars miraculously made it work. The soundtrack and cinematograph are great and the movie actually feels natural and realistic (as realistic as these kinda of plots can get). There is also sudtle emotional development in the Onion Head character during his 5 days on earth, from being curious to jealous to generous. Overall, it is a nice romantic tear-jacker.",1173052800,,509,4.862068965517241
8046375,3,B00079W9O4,"When the credits rolled out on the screen, I wondered how this film that seemed to have everything going for it: nice score, nice photography, and likable actors playing equally likable characters still didn't make a deeper impression on me.

Richie Chen plays a young man nicknamed ""Onion Head.""  He's blind and mute and earns his living as a volunteer for a hospital research program seeking a cure for blindness.  Onion's disabilities have not prevented him from developing a crush on one of his nurses, Autumn, who is played by Cecilia Cheung.  Anybody who's been in love can sympathize with Onion's insecurities and hesitation to confess his love for her.  After all, there's a doctor who is pursuing Autumn's romantic attention too.  But just when things with Autumn begin to look up for Onion, he dies in an accident.  His soul will go to Polaris but he's granted a wish before leaving forever. Onion, of course, wishes to go back and tell Autumn about his feelings for her.  The angel sets a couple of conditions for his return to Earth: Even though he will be able to see and talk, nobody will recognize him; he won't be able to reveal his true identity and he can stay for only 5 days.

Richie Chen and Cecilia Cheung are well cast in this film.  They will bring out some smiles and a few tears from the audience.  The story is quite straightforward though. There are no subplots, no layers to it, and this is probably why the film is somewhat predictable and ""safe.""  Don't get me wrong, Fly Me to Polaris is not a bad movie at all, but it's not a good-gotta-see movie either. It's just an OK movie to spend an hour and a half cuddled in front of your TV (with a box of Kleenex if you're the weeping type).",1153526400,3,1717,4.485530546623794
