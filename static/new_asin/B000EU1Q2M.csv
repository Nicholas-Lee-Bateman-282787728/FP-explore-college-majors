2534614,5,B000EU1Q2M,"Back in 1988, before this show's premiere I remember flipping through the newspaper one Saturday morning to find a short blurb about a new Alexander and Ilya Salkind production called ""Superboy, the TV Series""! Of course, I figured it'd be cheesy because the title of the show was ""Superboy"". But wrong again, Zod, to my surprise, I was delighted to find a spirited action-packed spin-off that had great 80s electronic music (all produced and performed by Kevin Kiner, who later did other big TV shows like the sci-fi channel's ""Invisible Man""). I digged the show to a great degree, actually, and became a frequent viewer and one it's devotees later down the road. I was probably one of the few people who grew up in the 1980s who religiously recorded the TV shows on VHS every week. Being my weekly guilty pleasure - be it John Haymes Newton or Gerard Christopher - the show was simply a lot of fun. Though Gerard Christopher was amazing as the boy of the steel - Gerard had a great sense of humor and to anyone Superman fan, if you want to see the goofiest Clark Kent of all, Gerard stole the show - get into Season 2 of Superboy! Produced very much within the spirit of the Christopher Reeve Superman movies, this time, it's about Superman when he was still in college! What a fantastic idea, and my own college years were coming right around the corner. Superboy is a winner, and the show has a lot of energy. Be prepared to be entertained.",1141948800,9,1444,4.53639846743295
2534615,5,B000EU1Q2M,"After a long and very hard legal battle and campaigning on the Superboy Homepage for the last few years...Superboy will finally see the light of day on DVD come June 20th. Season One starred John Haymes Newton in the title role of the Boy of Steel in his college years. Some of the great episodes of the season include ""Kryptonite Kills,"" which introduces the green rock that can kill Superboy. ""Alien Solution"" & ""Revenge of the Alien, Part 1 & 2."" Is about an alien that is the ultimate killing machine that invades bodies to add to his collection and now the Alien wants to add Superboy to his collection. Great series...hope to see Seasons 2-4 in the near future because Gerard Christopher was a great Superboy & Clark Kent.

2534616,3,B000EU1Q2M,"When this series came out in the late 80's I was only about 15 years old. At the time the very 80's look didn't bother me as it was the world we lived in, however this first series didn't age well. For a start John Haymes Newton was and in my opinion is the better of the two Superboy's who took the role on. He was replaced from the second season by Gerard Christopher who's acting ability left me cold. John Haymes Newton had a more natural element about him which helped support a very shakey beginning. The first episode isn't great. There is no lead in as to how he got there, Superboy has been on the scene for some time and we join the story as if we happened upon it! The acting from some of the supports is terrible, namely Lex Luthor who has this very strange accent and very wooden acting that from the word go you know we are in trouble. Considering when Superboy and Lex meet while Lex is attempting to steel an ""mystic"" jewel he greets Superboy with the line ""Ah you must be the one they call Superboy""! His attempt at being ""a man of the world"" comes off as close to comedic. John Haymes Newton is a fine actor and has a very physical dominance to the role. He didn't make Clark Kent the nervous mishap character as he is normally known as and this I think helps make Superboy that more a real character. It is clear that this first episode was done on a shoe string budget but as the season moves on the stories and the cast improve a great deal, (which they seem to peddle back from with some bad casting in future seasons). If you are a fan of the entire Superman/Superboy theme you will like this. It has its own originality to it but it has its hands tied by the producers who didn't have much imagination when to came to seeing where the character and story were going, unlike Smallville today which could have allowed Superboy to become Superman.

Its a big shame they changed Haymes Newton regardless of the ""difference"" in opinion. Gerard Christopher did have the added help of more money but his acting is just down right boring. Thank God they brought a new Lex into the show who stole every scene he was in with Christopher.

Over all first episode isn't great, but as the season goes on it improves and the casting is excellant, even having an Oscar Winner performing as the professor from the University. 3 out of 5 stars for the Season the two stars are lost due to lack of production and terrible acting from some of the supporting cast. John Haymes Newton not only saves the day, I think he saved the show!",1141862400,11,2538,4.307531380753138

2534629,3,B000EU1Q2M,"This series improves considerably in the following seasons.  Still they are some good episodes here.  Never tire of  ""The Alien"" and the 2 part episode when the Alien returned.  Those are the best of this season.

In it's natural state the Alien hadn't any form, it was basically a small cloud of energized gas.  However when it entered a recently dead, or well preserved, corpse, it could reanimate that body.  Even take possession of the living, if the host's will wasn't strong enough to resist.  The alien gained all of the body's physical abilities.  It searched the universe for the most powerful warriors it could find.

The alien first came to Earth in the Body of an Alien Samurai.  That body was destroyed by Superboy.  Then it attached Suberboy with all the bodies it had left.  Superboy incinerated them with heat vision.  Then trapped the cloud in an air tank.

Several months later the cloud escaped.  Taking possession of cops.  It hit Superboy with enough explosives to level a large building, and it barely stunned Superboy.  But even out cold, Superboy was to strong to possess.  After that the cloud planned it's revenge.  It decided to kill Lana and Jonathan Kent.  Then to spend the rest of Superboy's life attaching him, in one body after another, and killing anyone Superboy cared about.

To prevent that Superboy offered his body to the cloud.  He let the alien inside him.  What the alien didn't realize was that there was Kryptonite in the room. Superboy planned to keep the cloud trapped in his body, so they'd both die together.

Jonathan prevented that by helping the half dead Superboy into a cryo freezer, and then lowered the temp to absolute zero.  So when cloud fled his body, it froze solid.",1457222400,,1726,4.746621621621622

2534632,3,B000EU1Q2M,"This was the first time seeing the first season. When I was young I saw parts of season 3 and season 4 of Superboy so I didn't know what to expect in the first season. This is the cheapest season to buy which I am sure it has to do with it being the least favorite. Most people would say the 1st season was the worst, but I find that season 2 was unbearable to sit through. John made Clark someone who wasn't a geek or cool. I would say he was in between. It being the first season they didn't have much of a budget when it came to showing Super Boy's power. TJ's character was kinda like a version of Jimmy Olsen, but they didn't keep him after the first season. I think Superboy really lacked a back story even though we know his back story. I find that Lex Luther really didn't have a good story behind him either. Even though it has its flaws I still think John did the best he could playing Clark and Superboy. This season is mostly about Clark finding stories to write about and saving the day.",1450051200,2,1000,4.107142857142857

Did you love what Ilya Salkind did with Chris Reeves is the original Superman movie? Well, he's the executive producer of this series, and you can tell.

In this series, Superboy doesn't reveal himself to the world until he is in college. We see a flashback to that in about the fourth episode. We see mistakes get made, we see Lex Luthor lose his hair. We see Superboy deal with things that he does not understand.

I highly recommend this series to you, and eventually, I will also get Seasons Two, Three and Four when they also come down in price.

In fact, it's so good, I'll donate this copy to my local library so that others can enjoy it, too.

2534657,4,B000EU1Q2M,"I had recently completed viewing all 10 seasons of ""Smallville,"" and also all four seasons of ""Lois and Clark:  The New Adventures of Superman,"" and was looking for another series to continue my Superman fix.  I am aware of the earlier (1940s/50s) Superman TV series', however, I wanted to see something a bit more modern (post 1978 ""Superman"" movie), and found this.

I should note, if you are new to watching the Superboy/man television series, I would advise watching this series first, followed by ""Lois and Clark,"" and lastly ""Smallville.""  I unfortunately watched them in reverse order, and by far the best of these 3 is Smallville.

I found the first season of Superboy to be a bit campy.  However, when you look at the period it was filmed (late 80s), you'll forgive its campiness and unnecessary scripted dialogue.  Television in the late 80s were still focused around family entertainment, and did not ""push"" the boundaries of reality as in the late 90s, neither were special effects as cutting edge.  So I found this season to fit right into that time period.

In viewing this series, you would also have to not relate it to classic Superman mythology.  In the 1978 Christopher Reeves movie version of Superman, we see that the world only discovered Superman after he became an adult.  This series however, introduces him as a boy/young adult (since I don't think we can technically call someone attending their first year of college a boy) to the world as Superboy.  Although the series creators are the same from the 1978 movie, this series tends to negate the movie, so it must be watched in a ""stand-alone"" capacity.

Clark Kent, along with Lana Lang (his childhood crush) are in their first year of college.  The series does not go much into Clark Kent's discovering of his abilities as the ""Smallville"" series does, it just seemed to be assumed that he had always had them.  Also, it showed he had a relationship with Lex Luthor, contrary to the one shown in the Superman movie.  It also introduced us to his college roommate, T.J. White, a photographer for the University's newspaper, and son of Perry White, the Editor-in-Chief of the Metropolis Daily Bugle, which Clark Kent would later work for.  T.J.'s character, seemed to be molded after Jimmy Olsen's character.

Overall, I found this season of Superboy to be enjoyable entertainment, if you keep what I previously wrote in mind.  I would definitely recommend it.",1384732800,,2438,4.85956416464891
2534658,5,B000EU1Q2M,"I had heard a lot of negative reviews about the first season of Superboy. Many fans of the show seem to prefer the later seasons of Superboy, and Gerard Christopher's portrayal of the character. I watched this show as a kid, and only picked the show near the end of it's televised run. I had seen clips from the first season online, and to be honest, I wasn't sure whether or not I would like it. But I gave this season a chance, and was delightfully surprised with how much I enjoyed it. The first few episodes aren't top notch, but as the season continued it was obvious that the show was gaining momentum. I actually found myself preferring John Haymes Newton's portrayal over Gerard Christopher's portrayal of Superboy. People call this show cheesy, and it is. At the same time, I have to point out that this is a children's show. So it's not supposed to be taken too seriously. All in all I was happy with the set. There aren't a lot of extras, but I knew that going in. Though the extras you do get are really good. A couple of the episodes feature a commentary with John Haymes Newton and Ilya Salkind which I enjoyed a lot. There's also the short featurette Superboy: Getting Off The Ground which I liked as well.

I used to watch episodes of Superboy on Saturdays as a child. Superboy was poked fun of on MST3K. I am sure many TV critics thought it was bad. This show predates Smallville by about a decade. One really dark episode featured an evil spirit that took over Lana Lang's body. One of the lighter episodes features Mtxlplxk playing pranks on Superboy. The show recycled props from the Superman movies. The Superman film franchise was in trouble after the disappointing Superman III(1983) and Supergirl(1984). Superman IV The Quest for Peace(1987) was produced by Cannon Films.

2534673,3,B000EU1Q2M,"Many people nowadays who are fans or are familiar with the decade long running series ""Smallville"", may not know that another series about the exploits and adventures of Superman as a teen beat them to the punch some 13 years earlier. Premiering in 1988, ""Superboy"" ran for 4 seasons and had over 100 episodes.

The series takes place at Shuster University(named after one of Superman's creators, Joe Shuster) and follows the lives of a young Clark Kent(John Haymes Newton), his childhood friend from Smallville Lana Lang(Stacy Haiduk), and his friend T.J. White(Jim Calvert), son of Daily Planet editor Perry and the show's obvious 'Jimmy Olsen'. Clark/Superboy and his friends fight different kinds of bad guys, all the while attending school with Supes' biggest future enemy, Lex Luthor(Scott James Wells).

""Superboy"" was a syndicated show, so the budget for the series was probably not very high. Unfortunately, this made for some weak special effects and some cheap looking sets. Everything got better as the series went on, but the early stages of the show definitely had some kinks still to undo. The writing was not always up to par either. Some of the dialogue could be quite stilted and obvious, and you could see the pained reaction on some of the actors' faces. Acting-wise, the show was kind of wobbly there too. John Haymes Newton passes with flying colors though. Christopher Reeve is and always will be Superman, but Haymes Newton does an admirable job in the dual roles of Clark and Superboy. He looks great in both parts and does a good job of seperating the two in his scenes as the two. It's too bad he was replaced after this season. Gerard Christopher, who replaced him, was good, but Haymes Newton was a lot better. Stacy Haiduk does what she can with what is essentially the ""girl"" of the group who gets into trouble. Seeing this show again for the first time in nearly 20  years brings back memories of how she was one of my childhood crushes. She did give off a great vibe of sweetness and being innocent, but strong and flirty/sexy as well. Plus, she has the most amazing eyes. Wells, however, comes off quite hammy as Luthor, as if he is acting in an overdramatic school play. The show was produced by the Salkinds, who brought us the Christopher Reeve movies, so some of the physical flying of Superman is still cool. Done like in the Reeves movies. Nothing beats a real human on wires. I'm looking at you today's CGI!

Some of the highlights of season 1 include the two part episode ""Revenge Of The Alien"", which features Jonathan Kent being taken over by a being from outer space. Michael J. Pollard as classic comic book villain Mr. Mxyzptlk in the episode ""Meet Mr. Mxyzptlk"". Joaquin Phoenix, going as 'Leaf', appears as a child genius in ""Little Hercules"". A return to 1939 Hollywood in, well, ""Hollywood"". A classic telling of how Lex becomes bald and his vengeance on Superboy in ""Luther Unleashed"". Another good one is a thief committing crimes as Superboy in ""The Beast And Beauty"". 26 episodes in all. The DVD set also comes with an 11 minute documentary with the three main stars and producer Ilya Salkind. This could of been longer and much better. Plus, you get John Haymes Newton's screen test.

""Superboy"" will probably not go down as a huge shining beacon in the legacy of Superman. Can I recommend this a strong addition to the superhero sci-fi/adventure genre? Not exactly. Like I said earlier, the writing is weak at times, some of the acting questionable, and a lot of the effects leave a lot to be desired. But still, I am a fan and a Superman fan. What I can do is recommend this as a fun, amusing, campy piece of entertainment in the long history of Superman. Come on Warners!

2534680,4,B000EU1Q2M,"Recently bought SUPERBOY season 1 mainly for the nostalgia value. I remember watching this show as a teen in the late 80s and really liked it alot. I was disappointed that after its' initial run it vanished into virtual limbo for so long.

As others have said Season 1 is the weakest of the four seasons but that can mainly be attributed to the fact that the series was just struggling to find its ground in terms of characterization, visual effects, and most importantly types of stories to tell. This is evident as the stories and visuals got better as the season progressed with more realistic flying effects in the later part of the season and stronger stories written by professional comics writers familiar with the characters. Among the comic professionals who worked on stories are Andy Hefler, Mike Carlin, Denny O'Neil, and Cary Bates.

John Haymes Newton gives a somewhat uninspiring performance as Superboy but shines as Clark. Physically Newton looks the part and has more than a passing resemblance to Christopher Reeve but watching him you get the feeling that he really disliked wearing the red and blue suit and felt much more comfortable in the Clark persona. Despite some interesting character moments where Newton really showed his acting chops#such as in MEET MR. MXYZPTLK# it's really not that hard to see why the Producers decided to replace him at the season's end. The gorgeous Stacy Haiduk on the other hand was a perfect choice to play Lana Lang, bringing just the right amount of sex appeal and girl next door innocence to the role. She was born to play this role.

The tone of the first season is more reminiscent of the original Superman series with Superboy going up against the likes of crooked cops, crime bosses, and common criminals, only occassionally going up against a supernatural or superhuman menace. Despite the banality of the threats the season has a number of well known guest stars such as Abe Vigoda, Ray Walston, Michael J Pollard, Leif Garrett, Salome Jens, and Stuart Whitman.

In closing anyone who watches this should remember that the season gets better as it goes along and that the series as a whole improved greatly starting with the second season when Gerard Christopher replaced Newton in the title role and brought an appeal and enthusiasm that was previously missing. I highly recommend any SUPERMAN/SUPERBOY fan check this one out.",1252454400,2,2392,4.898765432098766

People who are expecting stunning visual effects should just stick with the feature films.  The show was meant to just be an entertaining romp of fun.  I liked all the characters.  I love the fact that they honored the creators of Superman in the series going to Schuster University.  John Haymes Newton seriously looks the part and I think plays the part well.  Regardless that he got replaced in season 2, he still got the series off to a good start.  The Salkinds are the masterminds behind the Superman movies and this series.  Hopefully Season 2 will be availiable sometime soon.  This is not a Smallville type show.  This has the tights and the flights, but it works.

2534690,3,B000EU1Q2M,"I remember this show well from the eighties. And what a view of the eighties it presents! Remember all the terrible fashions of the time? Well, they're all here, saved forever.

Robert Haymes Newton plays Clark Kent/Superboy this first season, and his college roommate, T.J. White, son of Perry White, is played by Jim Calvert. Stacy Haiduk plays Lana Lang as a sweetie from Smallville, while Scott Wells plays Lex Luthor as a straightforwardly psychopathic fratboy criminal. Of these, only Stacy Haiduk will make it past season 1; indeed, she will be the only principal character to finish the series.

The plots are just as over-the-top and comic-bookish as I remember, and the characters make it clear they are having lots of fun, again, just as I recall them.

The transfers in this collection, however, are not good. And uneven. They are never better than merely adequate, and some episodes, like ""Meet Mr. Mxyzptlk,"" are just horrible. It's obvious that nobody's been carefully keeping the source materials here. More like, ""Hey, we've got a chance to make some cash! Pull those reels out of the closet and send them to the DVD folks!""

All the same, the episodes with commentaries (by Newton and Exec. Producer Ilya Salkind) are great to watch and listen to. These two obviously had a great time working together, because they still do.

I've heard that Season 2 is coming out on DVD soon. I hope they spend a little more time with the color transfers this time. I know remastering is probably a pipe dream, but if you're gonna do something, why not do it well?

I have had the chance to watch the Gerard Christopher series and they are far better. Thou, with Newton we enjoy (with the cheesyness included) some adventures most of the time against crime bosses and Luthor plots worthy of laughing with his not so male roommate.

There is an episode called ""Countdown to Nowhere"" and the version they released on dvd makes the episode make no logical sense.

Intrigues at Shuster force Clark to adopt the alter-ego of Superboy. In this series' first season, Superboy first comes face to face with what become in the comics, Superman's arch-enemies, Lex Luthor (as a college student) and Mr. Mxyzptlk (hillarious performance by Michael J. Pollard-excellent casting choice). We learn how Clark develops a contact at Shuster (T.J. White, son of Perry White-editor for the Daily Planet) that will eventually lead to his job at the Daily Planet in Metropolis. We also get the story of how Luthor looses his hair, how he discovers Kryptonite as a deadly weapon to use against Superboy, and Superboy's first encounter with this deadly substance. Of course, these stories have already been told and re-told in different ways. But here we get another version of them.
I agree with prior posters that the first season suffered from poor writing, poor special effects and weak villians. On the plus side, John Haymes Newman makes the best ""Man of Steel"" since Christopher Reeve, much better than Dean Cain or Brandon Routh, I would have liked to have seen him succeed Reeve in the Superman role.

There were much better plots as the series progressed.  I wish Newton could have had those plots.  He would have been great. Newton looked more like a Superboy than Christopher, who looked smaller.

Now if you are a fan of Smallvolle, the show is more akin to the Superman show or even Lois and Clark.

The acting of John Hsyes Newton is very wooden Clark and a less than super superboy. a pre Seaquest Stacy Haduk shows her nettle in the role of Lana.

On the whole, this syndicate superboy from 1988 is good TV. A nice addition to any Superman collection

It has a super low budget look and looks like it was shot with a hand held camera sometimes.  However I respect it. It does succeed in telling the story of Superboy even if it is a little cheesey. Plus I  like in an episode how Lex is bulling a student to lose a basketball game so he wins a bet and Clark uses his super breath from a distantance to blow Lex into water behind him. Which gave me a nice thought...why can't Clark ever do that in Smallville. I mean Lex and Lana are kissing infront of a fountain or something and he blows them into it to get a laugh. Clark in Smallville doesn't have a sense of humor like that though. He just whines and complains ""Chloe, Lex stole Lana"", ""Chloe...Lana was mean to me"". It bugs me how he takes how Lana treats him after he saved her life a million times.

  Which brings me to the Lana in Superboy. She isn't over emotional and doesn't always bug Superboy to have a serious and waste of time emotional talk kinda like Lana does with Clark in Smallville in pretty much every episode!... Stacy Haiduk may not have Kristin Kreuk's sexy looks but she's still a cute Lana and...a less annoying Lana. Probably because the writer's of Superboy don't worship her as much as the writer's of Smallville. They focus on the story of Superboy while Smallville uses Lana so much that I'm starting think it's more of the coming of age story of Lana than it is Clark..

  Superboy doesn't have Smallville's budget to say the least but at least it's not a little too Dawson Creeekish like Smallville. Sometimes though it's like watching Saved by the Bell with....Superboy lol. I do like how it manages to tell good stories in just a half hour show though. It has more original ideas in a half hour show than Smallville can have in a whole hour.",1158883200,4,1944,4.249322493224932

Superboy is an awesome oppurtunity to get your Super fix if you do not care much for the Chris Reeve films or the more modern-oriented Smallville, and on the plus side, the episodes on this set are only 25 minutes or so.

It is a great way to introduce your friends or kids to the Boy of Steel without having to sit through a two hour movie or hour long show with overdeveloped stories. It doesn't take as much time which surely would be of interest to all the young parents out there!

Or if you are like me and you remember watching Superboy and his amazing adventures back in the day, this is a good chance to relive some of those memories of our carefree youth!

2534704,3,B000EU1Q2M,"""Superboy"" has been a long-neglected chapter of the 'Superman' saga, due, in large part, to Warner Bros., who refused, with a few exceptions, to allow the four-season series to be re-syndicated or marketed for 14 years (after winning a court ruling against Alexander and Ilya Salkind, long-time 'Superman' franchise producers). Fortunately, the WB has finally released the first season on DVD (in conjunction with the release of ""Superman Returns""), and, despite some obvious 'growing pains' in plot and execution, the series certainly is a worthy addition to any fan's library!

Filmed at the Disney/MGM Studios in Orlando, the first season of the half-hour series offered hunky John Haymes Newton, 22 (cast because of a resemblance to Christopher Reeve), as the Shuster University Journalism student/Superhero, with wholesomely sexy Stacy Haiduk, 20 (Newton's offscreen girlfriend) as his friend (who could be more), Lana Lang. Rounding out the 'regulars' was mop-topped Jim Calvert as 'Jimmy Olsen'-like T.J. White (nephew of Perry), who provided some welcome lightness and humor to the proceedings.

The first episodes appear rushed and routine (the introduction of occasional guest star Scott Wells as snobbish, evil 'frat boy' Lex Luthor is poorly-acted and disappointing), and, sadly, many critics who panned the series never looked beyond those episodes, to the later, more polished stories, penned by veteran 'Superman' comic book writers. Those episodes (particularly the introduction of impish Mr. Mxyzptlk, portrayed by a perfectly-cast Michael J. Pollard), show the promise of the VERY good series ""Superboy"" would become, in time.

""Superboy"" would foreshadow ""Smallville"", highlighting the bonds of young Clark to his adopted parents (portrayed by the excellent Stuart Whitman and Salome Jens), his small-town roots and sense of integrity, and the frustration of an attraction to Lana that he cannot consummate, because of the secrets he keeps. Newton, while lacking the smoldering sex appeal of Tom Welling, is very likable, and is far closer in age and personality to the character he portrays than either Welling, or Gerard Christopher (who would assume the role in Season Two of ""Superboy"").

Sadly, a combination of publicized scrapes with the local police (he seemed to drive at super-speed!), and salary demands would cost Newton the role after the first season, and most fans prefer Christopher's 'take' on the character, but this, to me, makes this collection even more 'special'. Comparing actor portrayals is a lot of the fun of the various incarnations of 'Krypton's Last Son', and Newton is certainly worth watching...

Give this collection a chance, and I think you will like it, on its own merits, and as the introduction of a long-absent chapter in the 'Superman' story!",1154908800,21,2801,5.4004576659038905

However, when we do get to see him, John Haymes Newton makes a visually pleasing Superboy, so I don't regret buying the first season...and more than likely would buy the later ones (once they are released).

On a few closing notes, the show seems more geared to older children than adults, so don't expect a lot of mature action to be occuring (He referees a basketball game at one point).  Superboy doesn't battle many super villains; he mostly foils the plans of civilian criminals.",1153180800,3,731,4.6434108527131785

2534731,4,B000EU1Q2M,"I gave up watching television in 1963, after having spent the majority of my teen years glued to the tube. Thus it came as a complete surprise to me that there even was a SUPERBOY series, let alone four seasons of it. I discovered it while looking for the third season of LOIS & CLARK and grabbed it immediately. I gather there are political and/or business reasons why the show was never shown beyond the initial airing. Whatever, I'm finding it a treat to watch the show now. (Actually it's a lot more fun than LOIS & CLARK, since that series degenerated into a soap opera by the third season. Why the idiots-that-be decided Clark and Lois should become engaged, let alone that she should discover his secret identity, I'll never know. They didn't consult me on this.)

The acting in SUPERBOY mostly is good, if occasionally wooden. The FX and productions values are fine (although I have caught the shadow of a crane when Superboy landed in a field, and in another shot, a microphone is clearly visible for several seconds). The stories and characters are fun.

What I find puzzling about the Warner Brothers release of the first season is that there is no pilot episode: nothing to explain why Lana Lang, Clark Kent and Lex Luthor have all migrated from Smallville and have converged on a university in Florida! And how did Perry White's son, TJ, from Metropolis end up there, too, and as Clark's roommate?

Bigger question: in the episode where Pa Kent is injured in a tractor accident and is in the hospital, why does Clark take an Eastern Airlines flight and a bus to get to Smallville when he could have just ditched the Clark Kent disguise and flown? Or hadn't he earned his interstate flying license at that point?

The shows in the DVD set are theoretically in the order in which they aired, but they're often out of sequence chronologically. For example, in about the fifth episode, after Superboy has rescued Lana and TJ several times, suddenly no one has ever seen him before. And TJ's hairstyle goes back and forth a few times, as do the opening credits.

All this carping aside, this is a fun series. The full four seasons are available in a set elsewhere, but not through Amazon. There are no bonus features, however. But then considering the inane bantering between Ilya Salkind and John Newton in the two commentaries in Warner Brothers' first season set, that's no big loss.",1152057600,7,2394,4.6635071090047395
2534732,4,B000EU1Q2M,"This show holds a special place in my heart.  I was 10 when it premiered, and it's what got me into a life of comic-book collecting.

The one thing that gets me the most about this show is the nostalgic factor.  While I watched every single episode when it first aired, this show was never available in syndication after its initial run and it's left me nothing but memories - until now.

Yes, the acting is pretty bad.  In many of the scenes the actors will fumble on their lines.  Yes, the special effects were terrible, and even I could see that at age 10.  And yes, the stories are pretty pedestrian.

But as I started watching the DVD's, I realized I couldn't stop.  Something about this series was magical.  Maybe it was it's innocence, maybe it was the fact that it felt like it was trying really, really hard.  And maybe its because we'll never get a series like this again.

I have to wonder if there's a camp factor to this first season that people watching the original ""Batman"" series 20 years ago would have felt.  I can't say for sure, all I can say is that I've had a pretty good time watching this set.

Let's hope this one does well so that we'll get to see seasons 2, 3, and 4.  That's when the show started to get really good.",1152057600,4,1245,4.260683760683761
2534733,4,B000EU1Q2M,"Yes, for  those who grew up as fans of this oft-forgotten series....SUPERBOY is back in an all new, long-awaited DVD set entitled SUPERBOY-THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON, avaible online and in stores now.

John Haymes Newton stars as  the  titular  Boy of Steel and his alter-ego, college student/reporter Clark Kent, and is joined by Stacy Haiduk as Lana Lang and Jim Calvert for 26 exciting episodes originally broadcast between October 1988 and May 1989.

I know fans of the series will probably remember the episodes featuring Gerard Christopher, who played the part for the next three seasons  after Newton was recast, but Newton  really isn't as bad as they claim. He is convincing as Clark and Superboy, and manages to give a new spin on both. He is often underated in discussions online about the legendary character, which is a real shame considering he is an excellent actor.

And can anyone here really say there is a  more desirable  Lana Lang than Stacy Haiduk, who was the single mainstay throughout all four seasons SUPERBOY was on the air. Younger sci-fi fans of course will recall her from seaQuest DSV and Kindred:The Embraced-or her appearances in  decidely non sci-fi productions including Melrose Place, Luther the Geek, and The Beneficiary- but this is the role that gave her first exposure as an actress, and her talents are definitely not wasted here!

Jim Calvert completes the trio as T. J. White, the son of Perry White who is hardly ever seen without a camera! It is easy to see the chemistry that all three leads had as they encounter-among other things-crime bosses, industrial sabotage, an alien shape-shifter, a certain imp from the 5th Dimension, ancient curses, and even a recurring  young Lex Luthor and his pal Leo. Plus there are bonus materials on this 4 disc set that offer insight into the series even going as far as interviewing members of the original cast.

Some may say this season was the weakest but it was good enough to be released as a box set with all the other incarnations of the Superboy/Superman character, and it is certainly good enough to buy whether in the stores in your local hometowns or online like at amazon.

Why not take the risk and see what SUPERBOY and his friends have to offer?

The only thing that concerns me is that people may watch this first season and be put off by poor acting and not-so-exciting scripts and villains. Please believe me when I say that this series did indeed keep getting better every season. This season John Haymes Newton played the part of Superboy and Scott Wells plays, in my opinion, a very poor Lex Luthor.

Next season Gerard Christopher takes over as Superboy. Sherman Howard takes over wonderfully as the new Lex Luthor. Mr. Howard is a marvelous Lex Luthor. We also see comic book villains such as Bizarro and Metallo. Gone is TJ White and in his place is Andy McAlister who also leaves the show after the second season when Clark and Lana work in the Bureau of Extranormal Matters. Stacy Haiduk is one of the only characters who remain the same.

The first year's special effects were not so great, but beginning in the second season many of the flying sequences rival the Superman movies. The scripts are MUCH better, the stories are much more exciting. And the best part is that this is one of the few shows where the show does get better and better each season. By the time you get to the third season you'll hardly believe it's the same show. The producers seemed to want to distance themselves from the first season because they renamed the show ""The Adventures of Superboy"". With just about a complete cast change by the third season, it does not seem to be the same show at all.

I urge everyone who is interested in this series to purchase it on DVD so that the remaining seasons will be released. You will not be disappointed. Give this series a chance to really shine.",1151280000,16,1750,4.549206349206349

Considering that I was buying Season 1 purely out of nostaliga, I was afraid that watching it as an adult would crush my fond memories of it. Yes, the show hasn't aged well, but I still enjoy it. The actors play their parts well, and the show still has a certain innocent charm. It was also nice to see the original actors on board to talk about the show. It's nice to know that care went into making the dvd when they could have easily just tossed episodes together. They also give you the original airdates on the inserts inside.

2534770,5,B000EU1Q2M,"I first watched this series growing up in the 80's - I was eight years old when it premiered in syndication.  To me, it is *the* definitive version of Superman/Superboy.  Looking back on it, nearly 20 years later, it hasn't held up as well as I remember it - but, it still gets five stars for pure nostalgia reasons.

I thought John Newton was much better as Clark/Superman than Gerard Christopher (both actors appeared later on Melrose Place).  Newton brought a realness to Clark - a regular guy who skateboarded and lifted weights with his buddies.  However, Christopher took Chris Reeve's interpretation and turned it up to 11 - displaying Urkel-level nerdiness.  Thankfully his Clark was toned down a bit after season 2.

Unfortunately, the first season suffers from a number of weak villains.  Too often, Superboy found himself pitted against wealthy land developers, cops gone bad, polluters, and old guys in junkyards suffering from World War II shell shock.  The villains got much better in later seasons.  Still, there are a number of standouts in the first year - the introduction of Kryponite, Mr. Mxyzptlk, battling a succubus, time traveling to Hollywood's golden era, etc. I like how certain elements from the movie franchise were melded with John Byrne's reinvention (Clark's father being alive in this version, etc.)  Incidentally, Martha is played by Salome Jens, who would go on to menace Deep Space 9 as leader of the changelings in the Dominion War. Another strength of the series was the impressive wire-work.  Take offs and landings were typically done well (using many people who worked on the Superman movies) and were very ambitious - much better than the ""whip pan"" cape over camera effect used in Lois and Clark to ""depict"" take offs.

I really hope people aren't put off by some of the plots of the first season.  For seasons 2-4, a number of comic book writers came on the show and infused a fun sense of adventure into the stories (not to mention Sherman Howard's maniacal portrayal of Lex Luthor - my personal favorite live action version yet!)  In addition, later seasons would see the show adopting a proto-X-Files format where Clark and Lana would investigate paranormal matters.  Noel Neill and Jack Larson (Lois and Jimmy from the original show) even make a cameo!  Please support this series on DVD - otherwise we may never get the later seasons released!

Now if Warner would release the 13 episode 50th anniversary Superman cartoon produced by Ruby/Spears (and written by Marv Wolfman) for CBS, I would be a very happy camper.",1143504000,116,2565,4.898148148148148

2534773,2,B000EU1Q2M,"I have no sentimentality or fondness for this show. It possessed poor acting, bad writing, wretched effects, and by far the worst pair of Lex Luthors one could ever imagine.

That said, it is Superman -- well, Superboy, which I am compelled to watch and analyze. Yes, I will purchase this DVD set.

In the show's defense, it improved in all aspects with each progressive season, but considering how horrible the first season is, that is not high praise.",1142467200,2,453,4.7215189873417724
2534774,4,B000EU1Q2M,"This was one of my favorite shows of the time period and have wished for re-runs for over a decade, only to be denied by the corporate legalistic idiots who have kept these entertaining fun shows under lock and key for SO LONG, and away from those of us who WANT TO WATCH, EVEN... PAY FOR IT.

After waiting so long I had nearly given up and eBayed the bootlegs!

Here we have such lovely shows such as Sledge Hammer being released on DVD, but no Superboy !????!

Season 2+ ... Wow, Gerard Christopher really deserves my royalties too darn it! Keep the DVD's coming!

Finally !

I have all of Wonder Woman, The (sort of) nice Batman film set, now ... Superboy. .. . .. SWEET!

Er... if only they could settle that 60's Batman TV series fiasco....

I'm ready for a big flashy psychadeli-comic box set.... ?!?!@?!@!",1142467200,7,813,4.416107382550336
2534775,3,B000EU1Q2M,"Being a huge Superman fan and a fan of the Christopher Reeve movies(well the first 2 anyway, I consider #3 a guilty pleasure along with Supergirl)I was curious to see what the Superboy show would be like. My local paper had a picture of John Haymes Newton looking very much like Christopher Reeve (something that didn't happen so much on the show itself)so I wasn't sure what to expect.

I was mildly disappointed with the first season. Newton made a decent Clark Kent/Superboy more in the mold of George Reeves,playing a much tougher Clark. It was the plots that I found to be a letdown. Once they started bringing in comic book writers the show improved greatly.

I am definitely looking forward to seasons 2-4. I always felt Gerard Christopher was a better Clark/Superboy even if he was channeling Christopher Reeve when he played Clark. Let's hope the season 1 set sells well so the rest of this very entertaining series will be released.",1142208000,5,942,4.737804878048781
2534776,5,B000EU1Q2M,"I grew up on this show and the first season with John Haymes Newton was definitely my favorite. Like so many other fans, I have signed various petitions to get Superboy out on DVD and I am so glad that we will finally get to see this great show again. More loyal to the comics than Lois & Clark or Smallville, Superboy is a must see for all who enjoy Superman in his many incarnations. John Haymes Newton really looks the part and had a coolness that some other the other actors who have played the Man of Steel have lacked. This show has a huge cult following and for good reason! Anyone who has only seen the later seasons with Gerard Christopher should definitely pick this up as well- you won't be disappointed!",1142121600,9,715,4.343283582089552
2534777,4,B000EU1Q2M,"I can't wait for SEASON 2 of SUPERBOY, but to get ready, I'm looking forward to the DVD release of SEASON 1 starring John Haymes Newton (Melrose Place & 'The Cable Guy' from Desperate Housewives). I just hope potential new fans (Smallville fans & Superman Returns fans) don't get discouraged when it comes time to purchase future seasons of SUPERBOY because they don't know that this show got better. SEASON 1 was probably the weakest of the series, with bad plots.

I can't believe Warner Brothers is releasing this DVD, since they filed a lien against the series in 1992 (the end of Season 4). WB blocked 'Superboy' from being rerun in North America, and from any further plans for occassional TV movies.

For the most part, 'Superboy The TV series' has been legally banned from future fans and viewers around the world which is why it has never been seen in syndication since. It cost the Salkinds a franchise, and the Superboy stars John Haymes Newton (Superboy/Clark 1), Gerard Christopher (Superboy/Clark 2) and Stacey Haiduk (Lana Lang) millions in royalties. Yet, despite this, the series is very much alive on the internet today and has spurned a loyal underground cult following.

Enjoy SEASON 1...John Haymes Newton did a good job as Superboy & Clark Kent.",1142035200,66,1267,4.856481481481482

So, I was kind of excited to hear about them creating a TV Series set within that universe. And while I do like seeing the costume used in the Reeve films once again and the fact that it is better than 2016's Batman v Superman, it does pale in comparison to the before mentioned 5 Salkind films. But I've heard the show starts getting better in Season 3, so the first 2 seasons are a good precursor to it.",1493337600,,563,4.371428571428571
8114417,5,B000EU1Q2M,"GREAT Season! A MUST for ANY Superman, Supergirl, DC comics, etc fans!  It's very underrated and pretty much forgotten really except by the hardcore fans. Season 1 is the only season where it's called just ""Superboy"" and the actor is John Haymes Newton. Then the next 3 seasons are called ""The Adventures of Superboy"" and Gerard Christopher is in the role and it doesn't make any sense. The actors are fine, it's the writing and the cheap sets that make it painful along with the film (not the DVD) skipping and losing sound at times. As for Season ONE, I'm so excited that this is on DVD with a ""making of"" in the special features! If you watch ANY Superhero shows, you have found a treasure! GET IT! I HAVE! =)",1488153600,2,712,4.435114503816794
