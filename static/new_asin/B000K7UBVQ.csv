2684675,5,B000K7UBVQ,"I first saw (and made a VHS tape of) this great traveloge during a local PBS pledge drive a couple of years ago.
Obviously, my original VHS tape quality cannot compare with this DVD version.
The photography is fantastic, and the aerial ""bird's eye"" view adds a whole new perspective to the many familiar sites that many of us have seen before either in person or through photos.
After viewing it I get the feeling that I should be raising my liter stein and saying, ""ein prosit der gemutlichkeit.""",1181692800,8,497,4.595505617977528
2684676,3,B000K7UBVQ,"Although the DVD is wonderfully shot, it is NOT in High Definition, and because it is in widescreen, I presumed it was.  Moral: never presume.",1177459200,3,142,4.68
2684677,5,B000K7UBVQ,"This is another excellent video in the ""Visions"" series where one sees the cities and the countryside from a helicopter.  This series covers Bavaria and the Rhine.  I look forward to more Visions of Germany covering the rest of the country.",1172102400,10,240,4.829268292682927

2684691,2,B000K7UBVQ,"Not to much description here. Lots of aerial photography,which is excellent quality,but doesn't describe too much of the country...Undecided whether I like it or not..",1430352000,,167,5.72
2684692,5,B000K7UBVQ,"This video is a favorite of mine. Not only does it show wonderful places, it gives an insight into what the people of Germany now love!",1430352000,,135,4.230769230769231
2684693,5,B000K7UBVQ,The German restaurant in our town plays this and hubby is always captivated by it. He was thrilled and surprised to receive it for Christmas. We hope to make a trip to Germany some day and visit these sites as both of our families are of German descent.,1427500800,,253,4.291666666666667

2684708,5,B000K7UBVQ,Great!  As expected.  Thanks.,1412467200,,29,6.0
2684709,5,B000K7UBVQ,"I love the Visions series.  I especially like the Austria and German DVDs since I am personally familiar with both countries.  The content of beautiful scenery, content-rich narration and accompanying music, plus the educational aspect of learning about another country makes for an exceptional viewing experience.  Also, it prepares you for travel to these countries and participate in their cultures.  Spending an hour or so enjoying this almost virtual travel experience makes for a very pleasant learning experience.

In addition, these Vision DVDs make excellent gifts for fellow travelers, plus good souvenirs of the respective countries to help you and fellow travelers remember the well-known monuments, castles, government buildings, museums, gardens, and even beer gardens, plus, of course, the fantastic natural scenery in winter or summer.",1408752000,,851,5.722222222222222
2684710,4,B000K7UBVQ,"I have all the visions dvd's and since I've never been to Germany, this was fun to watch.  Lots of interesting places to visit",1400371200,,126,4.25
2684711,5,B000K7UBVQ,"I had the opportunity to travel through Germany.  I bought this video with
the intention of reliving and reviewing some of my travels.  I much enjoyed
the video where it covered territory covered on our trip, as well as where
it covered other parts of the country.  Our trip was on land and along the
Rheine river.  This video provided an air view of much of the same locale,
so it gave me another perspective.",1399161600,,410,4.426666666666667
2684712,5,B000K7UBVQ,Great video for planning where you want to go on your next vacation to Germany or just enjoy the scenery!,1376352000,,105,4.3
2684713,4,B000K7UBVQ,"Don't pay alot of money for this...but it is beautiful.  It's soothing and calming.
Rather just make a donation to PBS.",1375747200,,119,4.666666666666667
2684714,4,B000K7UBVQ,"After being lucky enough to travel through Germany, I found myself really missing it once I returned stateside. This lovely,  mesmerizing video trip through southern Germany fills some sort of void... I find it very relaxing. It kind of reminds me of a couple of my recurring ""floating through Germany or Switzerland"" dreams I've had since my return.
Visions of Germany is quite enjoyable.",1371340800,2,389,5.078125
2684715,5,B000K7UBVQ,"Been there done that! but the memories are right there,when you see this again! Fantastic audio,female voice is  soothing to tranqulize you to a trip of a lifetime ! Where I was, everywhere they showed! For a Month!",1368057600,,215,4.657894736842105
2684716,5,B000K7UBVQ,I just love the music on the bavaria disc and the music on the along the rhein is great also. The scenery is fantastic. Overall I just love these two DVD discs. They really reminded me of my home country.,1361145600,,204,4.125
2684717,3,B000K7UBVQ,"Germany from above is better, but I have not been able to find it in English. So this was 'in lieu' of, but I would prefer the other.",1354233600,,133,3.7857142857142856
2684728,5,B000K7UBVQ,"Most travel videos look pretty much the same.  Not this one.  I appreciated the low-key narration, the titles, and the long running time.  This piece stands alone even if you have no intention of visiting Germany.  When I finished watching it, I was already looking forward to seeing it again.  I'm going to get the whole series, simply because I know I'll never see these areas from that aerial point of view.  The producers/photographers can count me among their fans.",1346457600,,470,4.8125
2684729,5,B000K7UBVQ,"Great video with helicopter perspectives on many grand sights of Germany from the Rhine Valley to Bavaris. Even if you have seen the various places, the aerial orientation will privide fresh perspective.",1346457600,,203,5.375
2684730,5,B000K7UBVQ,The video arrived quickly and the price was very good. The video of Germany is beautiful and the music is lovely.  Thanks.,1332633600,,122,4.545454545454546
2684731,4,B000K7UBVQ,"It was good in that it started in Switerland and ended in Stutgart Germany. It showed the many Castles and cathedrals along the Rhine river that one might see if one is on a River cruise, but from the air.",1325980800,,205,4.15
2684732,5,B000K7UBVQ,"I lived in Germany for three and one half years back in the late 70s/early 80s and visited most of the sites on the DVD. My wife and I also just returned from a ten day guided ""Highlights of Germany"" tour and again, went to many of the sites on the DVD. What amazes me about the DVD (I bought the Blu Ray DVD) is the unique aerial perspective and the amazing quality of the video. I was able to notice architectural features of the buildings and surrounding landscape that are simple impossible to see from the ground. Also, the camera is apparently mounted on the helicopter in such a way that the video that is produced is smooth as silk. With the helicopter constantly moving forward, it reminds me of the Ken Burns effect you see so frequently on photographs in PBS documentaries. We were spellbound watching the video. We have also purchased the Europe collection as well as Britain and Ireland...can't wait to watch them knowing what a treat awaits us!",1325980800,,958,4.543352601156069
2684733,5,B000K7UBVQ,"I bought this for Father. He saw it playing at a German restaurant and wanted one. My
wife and I viewed it also. It is very well made.",1316995200,,134,3.8214285714285716
2684734,1,B000K7UBVQ,"I was greatly looking forward to this item, but it never showed up.  I did get a credit on my account, but I'd rather have had the item sent and the money accepted.  Now I have to look elsewhere.",1281052800,,195,3.9743589743589745
2684735,5,B000K7UBVQ,Fabulous! Lived and was stationed in Deutschland from 1986-1990 and the video and narration are spot on!,1269993600,,104,5.176470588235294
2684736,4,B000K7UBVQ,"A beautiful perspective on this area, fascinating to see the inside courtyards and up close of towers of many castles and views of the Alps and the Rhine.  I am going back to So. Germany this spring and bring my twenty-somethings.  Now I am changing my travel plans to include a visit to the Rhine, and different castles than I had planned.  (I am now only interested in the outside views of Ludwigs more famous castles-----I want to see the INSIDE of the places Kings actually lived)  The truly old places look so fascinating, and close up aerial shots of many places are fascinating.  My father in law (from Germany) would have loved this set if he were alive now.  Great present for former German residents!  Exquisite photography, photographed in wonderful light and perfect time of year (seems like most shots were taken in the Spring/early Summer)  They sould put together a video of the little towns and such that are around the main attractions there ....I remember the villages near the castles to be wonderful. And also the residents of Germany to be gracious.  I cannot wait to go back!",1263859200,5,1097,4.701570680628272
2684737,5,B000K7UBVQ,I played this during a large Oktoberfest party.  It was a huge hit.  The scenery is absolutely beautiful.,1259539200,,105,4.777777777777778
2684738,2,B000K7UBVQ,"Love the shows for the beautiful aerial shots and wonderful background music. However, the Germany Bavaria DVD has the location titles at lower left cut off, e.g., instead of seeing the label ""Bodensee"", only ""ensee"" appears, and so on, for all the town names and sights. It's not a problem with our TV: we cycled through every possible viewing format (wide, zoom, wide zoom, full, etc) and none would allow for the complete labels to appear. It seems that when the DVD was made, the picture aspect ratio was made too narrow; the package indicates it's 16:9 widescreen but it sure doesn't appear to be. If we had known this before ordering, we probably would not have bought it, as part of the enjoyment is knowing what you're seeing. We rated it 2 stars instead of 0 because of the beautiful photography but in our opinion, the disk is defective. We haven't watched the Rhine disk yet.",1250985600,4,886,4.649681528662421
2684739,5,B000K7UBVQ,"VISIONS OF GERMANY is all it can be for anyone wanting a special look at Germany, regardless of whether you have actually seen the country in person.  Having never visited much of Bavaria this was an eye-opener and quite a pleasant visit using the helicopter vantage position provided in this wonderful DVD. It's taken me 2 1/2 years since the DVD release for me to discover this delightful film and narration of Germany.

I did see the Neuschwanstein Castle (the castle that inspired the Disney Magic Kingdom castle) in person several years ago. I remember the hard climb up the mountain and waiting for the tour. This DVD gives you a better view of the outside of the castle than you could ever get in person--unless you hire your own helicopter fly-over.

The Rhine trip also is much better seen from this DVD chopper trip than from a boat floating down the Rhine River. It is romantic and beautiful, if you get a sunny day, but you spend the entire trip wishing for an opportunity to stop and look closer, or at least wish you had brought a pair of binoculars. The ""Visions of Germany Along the Rhine"" DVD portion is better than being there...honest. To make it authentic, eat a brat and drink some suds while viewing.

If only that wonderful narrator's voice had been explaining the facts and history, and special notations along the way when we sat on the boat deck. Then I might have understood what I was seeing, and become educated to some of the wonders that the German country offers. Again, this DVD does a better job, thanks to that sleepy, soothing, pleasant alto voice of the DVD tour guide. It's a shame we never see her face.

The German music, used as background, is a mix of instrumental and vocal, plus classical to folk.  The music includes works by German natives Wagner and Beethoven.  It sets the stage of a total immersion into the German culture as you watch the countryside slip under your view. The music is also a part of the extra bonus footage, which is about 25 minutes per DVD. Narration is only a part of the feature portion, about an hour on each of the 2 DVDs in this set.

This DVD has educated me of the people, country, history, and more related to Germany.
This is a must if you are planning a trip to Germany soon.
It's a reminder if you've been there.
It's almost as good as being there in person for any viewer.
A MUST FOR ANY HS OR COLLEGE GERMAN LANGUAGE OR HISTORY CLASS.

Enchanting. A mix of the ancient and the modern in this aesthetic visual journey over much more than just castles. I'm super glad I finally found this DVD. You will be too.",1250899200,22,2591,4.4724576271186445
2684740,1,B000K7UBVQ,"Both items were ordered on May 29. The note from Amazon said they will be delivered by June 22.  As of June 23, neither orders were delivered.  I contacted the vendors, Super Mart and Deeveedees and they said they would reship. As of June 29, I have not seen either.
It would be better if the purchaser is informed of the tracking number at the time of shipment.
I rated one star, as I can not really rate without seeing them.",1246233600,,426,4.246913580246914
2684741,3,B000K7UBVQ,"I was a little bit disappointed when I watch these.  It seems like Germany does not have as beautiful a scenary as that of France or Englnad.  But I knew this is not true when I watched other travel DVD.  Let's put it this way: When I watched the Visions of England, France, Scottland, I can feel the distinct difference in each country and their beauty and was grateful for the hellicoper views of those coutires.  I had a hard time to even finish the first DVD. After viewing the first one, I lost interest to watch the second one.",1243036800,3,533,4.3
2684742,5,B000K7UBVQ,"I loved the 'Visions of Germany along th Rhine'. My husband and I lived there fo eight  years and three of our children were born there. Watching these videos makes me realy homesick.
I would like to know if anyone can tell me what the title of the female duet is that is sung at the beginning part of the bonus footage. [...]
Thanks,

2684743,5,B000K7UBVQ,"I just wish there had been credits for the music selections at the end. And I think they should have used the music of Wagner right away at the beginning of the scene showing Bayreuth. For some reson they used Smetana but at least Wagner kicked in a few minutes later. A few of the folk music tunes were a bit obtrusive and didn't really flow together with the classical pieces, but that's just my personal taste.",1220832000,2,413,4.376623376623376
2684744,5,B000K7UBVQ,This is a beautiful and breathtaking video . Scenery was out of this world and I am extremely glad I bought it,1211155200,2,110,4.045454545454546
2684745,5,B000K7UBVQ,"Much like most of you out there I first became acquainted with the `Vision Series' of aerial travelogue features on PBS television. Whenever I came upon one while channel surfing I'd immediately put the remote down and sit back and relax. It wasn't long before I decided these programs were something I'd never tire of watching and needed to be added to my private DVD collection.

Containing two program on two DVD discs, `Visions of Germany' is the fifth high altitude tour in the series following `Visions of ... Greece / Italy / England and France'. As with the previous four this '07 release whisks the audience away far above the maddening crowd to view Germany in all its incredible architectural and agricultural glory. Add to the visuals an robust German soundtrack and informative narration and your ready for departure!",1208131200,25,830,4.928571428571429

2684747,5,B000K7UBVQ,We bought Visions of Germany (2 DVD's) for my father-in-law as a Father's Day Gift.

8155024,5,B000K7UBVQ,"Our church's Oktoberfest was enhanced by this overhead view of Germany.  The scenery presented was absolutely beautiful.  One woman asked me where she could get a copy for her friends who were going to travel there!
After this event, I brought this to our father's memory care unit for viewing.  I'm guessing that many of the residents had traveled there and if they hadn't, they would enjoy the music and video of castles, anyway.",1508198400,,431,4.797297297297297
