1195754,5,B000006J0K,"A well written and very affecting film from Bill Forsyth.  There is nothing contrived or false, just honest storytelling with a little humor thrown in.  I watched this film after ending a relationship and I saw  myself in the character's examination of himself and his relation to the  world in general.  Highly recommended for any season (the film takes place  during the Christmas season).",927936000,6,391,5.03125
1195755,5,B000006J0K,"Wikipedia's summary of this movie is totally without any understanding of Glasgow or the background to the movie.  Here is the history: In the same way that the Chinese run laundries in  California the Italians run ice cream shops in Scotland.  The Italians came to Scotland in the 1800s and opened ice cream shops. It is said that they all came  from the same region of Italy which was suffering some economic depression at the time.  Their reputation for gelatos was probably the root cause of their success in this business in Scotland.  So now to the movie.  The movie has to do with a war between two ice cream companies, both Italian of course.  This war was meant to be a spoof on American gang war movies that featured mostly Italians.  Of course there are no killings in this movie which makes is a low scale spoof.  All in all the idea that Glasgow is the Scottish equivalent of Chicago is the joke that runs through the whole movie. Another movie with a link between Glasgow and Chicago is My American Cousins. This is also worth watching.",1373760000,2,1050,4.537234042553192

1195757,5,B000006J0K,"You read that heading correctly. Mark Knopfler wrote the moodier songs as the soundtrack for this movie, and the music does a wonderful job setting the tone of the film. In fact, it even inspired a couple of lines in the film.  Perhaps if the album had been subtitled as "" The soundtrack to Comfort & Joy"" we would be able to buy this wonderful movie on DVD here in the States!
I actually saw the movie in the theater and fell in love with it. I do have an old VHS copy and it is almost the singular reason I still own a player, along with a couple of other rarities. I would love to watch it a couple of times a year, but am afraid of wearing out the tape.
The movie is hilarious in an offbeat, touching way, like all of Forsyth's films, and only qualifies as a ""holiday film"" due to the setting, but I can't help but have to watch it every year in late December. Somehow, it boosts my morale after too much of our version of Yuletide. I won't summarize the movie hear, others have already done so, but urge you to see the movie and help in any way possible to get a DVD or iTunes or Amazon Instant release of the wonderful film.
And yes, Virginia, there is a Sanity Clause.",1356825600,2,1175,4.108695652173913
1195758,5,B000006J0K,"Although it's typically British Comedy, it tickles your funny bone and plays with the strings of your heart. It's funny from start to finish.

1195759,5,B000006J0K,"If you've had your fill of schmaltzy, cloying, over-the-top, faux heart-warming Christmastime movies and you can appreciate good films, then ""Comfort & Joy"" is the perfect holiday flicker. It's quirky, subtle, introspective, and delightful. The writing (Bill Forsyth) is clever, the acting (particularly Bill Patterson) is excellent, the soundtrack (Mark Knopfler/Dire Straits) is wonderful, and the cinematography/scenery of Glasgow in winter is magnificent. Bare in mind this isn't a Hollywood-made comedy (i.e. no potty gags aimed at 12-year-olds), so you have to pay attention to appreciate the humor. In addition, I struggled somewhat with the local accents my first go-around (I made the mistake of watching it late at night after a long day at work). Nevertheless, I can safely say this is the most intelligent and fun holiday film I've seen. Let's hope that Universal gets it together someday soon and releases this on DVD in Region 1.",1324080000,6,943,5.3355704697986575

1195763,5,B000006J0K,"I was looking online for days, just to find the name of this wonderful Bill Forsyth film. Seems others recall seeing this 25 years ago on cable, as I do, but have not been able to locate a copy to own. I was in radio at the time, and had a few lonely Christmases under my belt, so I was able to identify with this superb, quiet, witty comedy. If you like ""Local Hero"", you'll recognize similar devices here: the struggle between capitalism and individualism, the smart but oddball characters that never distract from the plot but decorate it, and the underlying sadness at a past that has no future. Even though I saw it twice in the mid '80s and never since, this is of my all time favorites. It's a real antidote to the smarmy, sugary junk Americans are drawn towards this time of year.

There is another film of the same name, and it is exactly what I mean by ""smarmy and sugary"". Don't be confused...this one is set in Scotland. Why no DVD ????",1260748800,3,948,4.325842696629214
1195764,5,B000006J0K,"Underrated, yes.  Great, yes.  Understated, yes.
Before Bill Forsyth retired from filmmaking, he made some excellent movies that will stand the test of time.  Along with ""Local Hero"" and ""Gregory's Girl,"" this movie reminds us what film can do for us by way of creating memorable characters and engaging stories, and by showing how people can persevere with humor and decency in a strange and surprising world.",1240185600,,410,5.08955223880597

1195766,5,B000006J0K,"Why is this movie not on DVD?  The saga of Dickie Bird the heart-broken DJ and the warring Italian ice cream vendors is one of my all-time favorite films. Never was comedy and tragedy so well married. There is so much crap out there that's on DVD and this great film stays an obscure classic? I wish someone would release all of Forsyth's films. What about ""That Sinking Feeling"" or ""Being Human""?  Or ""Housekeeping""? But not to have ""Comfort And Joy"" on DVD is truly a crime.",1216252800,,476,4.459770114942529
1195767,4,B000006J0K,"Comfort and Joy is an underrated gem of a Christmas movie. Bill Paterson plays Alan ""Dickie"" Bird, a popular radio personality experiencing a mid-life crisis sparked by his girlfriend's unexpected departure (a marvelously written and realized scene). Feeling rather superficial, underused and overqualified professionally, Alan embarks on a journey of self-realization, culminating in his brokering a deal between two bickering ice cream truck families embroiled in a turf-war (what?). This gentle and charming film demonstrates writer/director Forsyth's penchant for quirky, subtle humour and for stories possessing much more meaning than one would realize upon first glance. Some favorite scenes (besides the aforementioned ""break-up"") include Alan's numerous tapings of radio commercials, the ""Godfatheresque"" meeting between Alan and the patriarch of one of the feuding ice cream families, and an appointment with a therapist in dire need of therapy himself. A wonderful film, rivaling many of Forsyth's more well-known efforts, including Local Hero and Gregory's Girl. Purchase Comfort and Joy (hopefully released on DVD region 1 soon, as that is my only reason for witholding the coveted 5th star) for your Christmas film library.

1195768,5,B000006J0K,"Yes, an Ice Cream Mafia War. This is the high art that Bill Forsyth was so well-known for in the 1980s. Fabulous performances by all, as a DJ gets drawn into an ice cream war, helping him to get over heartache at the holidays. I don't believe CP Grogan as an Italian girl (nightmare accent when speaking Italian!), but she's gorgeous and they're all funny and it's worth it just to hear the partriarch say, ""Mr. Bunny.""",1126483200,10,419,4.454545454545454

1195770,4,B000006J0K,"Comfort and Joy (Bill Forsyth, 1984)

It's kind of hard to describe the appeal of Bill Forsyth's fourth (yes, there was one before Gregory's Girl) feature film, Comfort and Joy, without sounding like a raving lunatic. Not that that's ever stopped me before. A popular radio DJ, Alan 'Dickie' Byrd (Bill Paterson [Foyle's War, Truly Madly Deeply]), has his girlfriend Maddy (Eleanor David [White Hunter Black Heart, he Wolves of Willoughby Chase]) move out on him a few days before Christmas. While trying to get over it, he spies a gorgeous woman in an ice cream truck and, on a whim, pursues her, and it, to the outskirts of town, where it's attacked by a band of masked robbers. One of them recognizes Alan, which gets him involved in a turf war between the rival ice cream vendors Mr. McCool and Mr. Bunny. Which results, of course, in everyone around him thinking he's utterly mad.

While it's not Forsyth's best work (that title is reserved for Housekeeping), Comfort and Joy is, well, a joy. Forsyth's use of visual tricks and sight gags makes for a wonderful experience, and as for the plot, well, what can be better than warring ice-cream factions? An overlooked gem that's begging for a DVD release. **** ",1094515200,39,1214,4.7440758293838865
1195771,5,B000006J0K,"A real crime that this isn't available on DVD, as this is my all time favorite christmas movie. Quietly funny, sad and sweet, and the perfect antidote for a lonely christmas. Nice soundtrack by Mark Knoffler, full of quirky oddball performances, and a hilarious ""Mr. Bunny"" jingle that will stick in your mind whether you want it to or not (""hello folks!"").",1073606400,25,357,4.774193548387097
1195772,5,B000006J0K,"This is a thoroughly enjoyable film that I remember seeing on cable in the mid-1980's, wondering why it never got the attention that other films from the UK get.  In the same vein as Bill Forsyth's ""Local Hero,"" this film doesn't star any American actors, just good, Scottish character players.  Bill Paterson, (probably best known to American audiences for his bit roles in ""Crush"" and ""Witches"") portrays morning drive DJ Alan ""Dickie"" Bird, whom we meet a week before Christmas--the day his girlfriend leaves him.  Depressed and lonely, Alan looks for meaning in his life.  Along the way, he stumbles upon a nasty turf war over ice cream (between the ""Mr. Bunnys"" and the Mr. McCools"") and gets sucked in the middle.  Set in modern Glasgow at a popular radio station (by the way, the radio station scenes are realistic) this film includes a lot of light, matter-of-fact ironies and funny moments (check out Alan's precious BMW at the beginning of the film and at the end; the xylophone player and the vocalist at the ice cream plant; and the shirts Alan's audio engineer wears).  Enjoyable any time, but a shame this film will probably never be available on DVD.  My favorite Christmas movie of all time.",1041033600,29,1207,4.8019323671497585
1195773,3,B000006J0K,"With his usual tongue-in-cheek, director Bill Forsyth sets out to document the 1980s ice-cream wars in Edinburgh and Glasgow. Abandoned at Christmas by his long-time livein and kleptomaniac Maddy (Eleanor David), Edinburgh disc jockey Alan (Bill Paterson)seeks 'comfort and joy' in the company of his friend Colin and family, only to feel lonelier than ever. His ensuing involvement with feuding gangs of ice-cream vendors provides a fine comedic counterpoint to his sense of loss.
Probably the best scene in the film is a confrontation between ice-cream mafioso Mr. MacCool (Roberto Bernardi) and his wayward offspring. The mix of lowland Scots and Italian accents may be too much for most American audiences, but it had me rolling on the floor. Alan's obvious interest in the mafioso's daughter (the much-underseen C.P. Grogan) points up his sense of futility - she's gorgeous, mysterious, and obviously a tease, and he's middle-aged, balding, potbellied, and trying to hang on to vestiges of youth by owning 'the ultimate driving machine.'
Not as entrancing as 'Local Hero,' nor as sincere as 'Gregory's Girl,' 'Comfort and Joy' is just right for those who want to see a non-sappy Christmas movie.",987120000,8,1200,5.255208333333333

7904547,4,B000006J0K,"If you liked the movie Local Hero, also set in Scotland, you'll like this. Same director, The setting is not as charming as Local Hero which was on the Northern coast of Scotland in a small town, this one is set in Glasgow, the biggest city in Scotland, and is much grittier. The hook in this movie is a popular disk jockey who accidentally becomes involved in a territorial dispute between two local ice cream distributors that has devolved into street warfare between the rival companies. That both companies are owned and operated by Italian families imparts a sort of mafia twist to the whole thing as thugs bash in the windows of the Mister Bunny"" ice cream truck as the loudspeaker next to the bunny mounted on the roof continues to squeak out ""Hello Folks, Hello Folk"". It's got its own charm.",1427068800,,800,4.601398601398602
7904548,4,B000006J0K,"It's instructive to look at Bill Forsyth's mid-Eighties comedy in light of the Alan Partridge cycle of television shows, in which Steve Coogan portrayed a monstrously egotistical radio presenter completely unaware of the fact that everyone hates him, and would rather see him off the airwaves as soon as possible.  Likewise Bill Paterson's ""Dickie"" (actually Alan) Bird comes across as someone so wrapped up in his radio persona that he cannot see what's happening around him.  In the ersatz world of jingles, pop music, and inane chatter, he is a big star; to everyone else he is nothing but a pain.  It's thus hardly surprising that his long-time girlfriend Maddy (Eleanor David) chooses to move out.

Set around Christmastime in the center of Glasgow, COMFORT AND JOY looks as if it might be a highly ironic title for a film whose central character cannot find inner peace, and who becomes unwittingly involved in a turf war between rival ice cream sellers.  What makes Bill Forsyth's film so endearing is the way he shows so many people making mountains out of emotional and personal windmills.  Glasgow is sufficiently big to accommodate both the McCool cartel led by the Mafia-style boss (Roberto Bernardi), as well as the more fly-by-night outfit led by Trevor (Alex Norton).  It is simply pride - as well as other issues - that prevents them from arriving at a deal.

As the action unfolds, however, so Alan/Dickie undergoes something of a change of character.  He finds out that he can make things happen - not by trying to sustain his arrogant radio persona, but rather treating people on their own terms.  He manages to find a particularly satisfying resolution to bring the two sides in the ice cream war together, leaving him ready and willing to face the world with renewed vigor.  He might be on his own on Christmas Day, but he understands the importance now of maintaining relationships, both personal and public.

Shot in muddy color in perhaps the most anti-Thatcherite of cities, COMFORT AND JOY offers a glimpse of life beyond the mid-1980s illusion of prosperity and individual self-improvement.  People struggle to survive in this city in whatever way they can, even if it means selling ice cream for a living.  Their world deserves to be recognized, even though very different from English life at the same time.

The film is replete with memorable cameos, from Scottish actor Rikki Fulton's Hilary - Alan's smooth-talking boss who thinks his star employee has gone barking mad - to C. P. (aka Clare) Grogan's stellar turn as Charlotte.  COMFORT AND JOY might be a film with a morally soft center, but it manages to make some acute social observations along the way.",1418860800,,2690,4.892070484581498
