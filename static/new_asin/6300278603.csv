It was so cool for it's time because you began to see all the superstars of this era in a different light and they were outside of their comfort zone. It was something I'd watch so much that it was my night time lullabies. The video length was under an hour if I remember..,1405296000,,318,3.9076923076923076

""PileDriver"" the music video by the WWE and sang by Koko B.

Ware, marked a specifically new direction of the WWF, the

embrace of the music video and WWF Theme Music.

Remeber this was 1987 and during this period, several WWF

Superstar still came to the ring with no theme music,

except Hulk Hogan, Ricky Steamboat, MachoMan Randy Savage

and a few others. With the advent of theme music,

and video, the WWF new they could give the fans an extra

something. This was at a stage in the 1980's when the use

of the 8 track tape popular in the drug induced 1970's

was now coming to a close and was now being replaced

by cd audio. After this the WWF would start releasing

CD based WWF Theme music which they still do today.

This video ""PileDriver"" then shows us the music entrances

of then tag teams and superstars at the time. It literally

is a memorable trip down memorable. See the entrance

music for Axe and Smash of ""Demolition"". Demolition would

go on to be one of the most popular tag teams in WWF

history. ""Strike Force""'s  theme song ""Girls in Cars""

is also featured. ""Rock and Roll Hoochie Coo"", ""Honky

Tonk Man"" and of course the main song ""PileDriver""

by Koko B. Ware.

I really feel bad for Koko, a really good talent fired

by politics and a vindictive Vince McMahon, otherwise

this is a great video for wrestling fans to check out.",1123545600,5,1423,4.4609375
