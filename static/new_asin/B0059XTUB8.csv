4620928,4,B0059XTUB8,"Simon Curtis' ""My Week with Marilyn"" tells all in the title. It's the story of Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne), an aristocratic, well-ccnnected young Englishman, and how he had a brief fling with Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams) while serving as a production assistant on the film ""The Prince and the Showgirl."" The film, though very well-made, is pretty much a trifle, except for the astonishing performances of Williams and of Kenneth Branagh as Laurence Olivier.

Seeing production stills before I saw the movie, I didn't know how Williams was going to bring off playing Monroe; with her round, girlish face, she looks nothing like Monroe, and being dressed, made up and coiffed in full Marilyn drag only emphasizes her lack of resemblance. But this turned out to make no difference, for Williams becomes Monroe to the life, capturing her incandescence, her crippling insecurities, her manipulative flirtatiousness. If there is a more consistently impressive young American actress than Michelle Williams, I don't know who it might be.

Like Williams, Branagh bears no physical resemblance whatever to the world-famous actor he's playing, though his resume makes him a natural to play Olivier (even down to his directing and starring in his own versions of ""Hamlet"" and ""Henry V""). Branagh nicely captures Olivier's magnificence of voice and gesture, but even more, he captures something of Olivier's soul. Watch Branagh's close-ups, and particularly his eyes; on several occasions his eyes have that wild, imperious look that Olivier alone had, and no other actor in cinematic history.

I was less impressed with Eddie Redmayne; he was likable, but essentially just Richie Cunningham with a posh accent. The rest of the players, though, are superb. I was particularly gratified to see Judi Dench playing Dame Sybil Thorndike as a fount of thespian and worldly wisdom. Emma Watson, Derek Jacobi, Zoe Wanamaker, Philip Jackson, Toby Jones, Dominic Cooper and Julia Ormond also acquit themselves well. ""My Week with Marilyn"" is well worth seeing as a splendid showing for British Rep, as well as one American interloper.",1323820800,13,2120,5.266272189349112
4620929,4,B0059XTUB8,"An aspiring young filmmaker spent a short time in 1956 on the set of a Laurence Olivier and Marilyn Monroe film as an assistant director. He became close to Marilyn as many men had, and ended up a key figure in the production. Marilyn Monroe was notoriously difficult to work with in Hollywood and that is well-dramatized here. Michelle Williams IS Marilyn Monroe in this one and her performance highlights a realistic look at the difficulties that Marilyn had with trying to be a serious Hollywood actress while dealing with her insecurities and a prescription drug habit. This film was a pleasant surprise and another terrific movie to see during the holiday season.",1323475200,34,668,4.920353982300885
4620930,4,B0059XTUB8,"I went to this movie not expecting Michelle Williams to convince me she was the iconic Marilyn Monroe, but she surprised me. Bearing a striking resemblance to the famous actress, Ms. Williams is able to project the vulnerability, the sensivity and the fragility that we expect from Monroe. She is to be commended for such a really fine performance. Kenneth Branagh as Laurence Olivier takes a lot more getting used to. Even though he gives an okay performance as a sometimes stuffy, always impatient British actor, I did not see Laurence Olivier. Emma Watson as Paula Stasberg, Ms. Monroe's acting coach, is quite good. And Eddie Redmayne, the young man who plays Colin Clark portrays all the wonderment and awe that an unknown twenty-three-year old would exhibit should he be selected by the likes of Ms. Monroe to be her friend and confidante. Judy Dench as always is a terrific actress, whether she has 5 lines or five thousand.

The movie is based on the brief friendship that Clark and Monroe had when she was in England to made the film ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" with Olivier. Although the plot is rather thin, the movie is certainly worth seeing, if for nothing else, for the fine acting of Ms. Williams even though her body does not quite measure up to Ms. Monroe's.

Finally Lang Lang on piano is certainly a classy touch.",1322870400,2,1335,4.725321888412017
4620931,4,B0059XTUB8,"The real Marilyn Monroe was an inch and a half taller than Michelle Williams, a significant difference when one considers that there is no way Williams could have replicated the voluptuous physicality of Monroe's presence. Yet, the young actress does something quite unexpected in capturing the essence of Monroe's wounded psyche for all its frailties and doing a convincing job of conveying the public Marilyn for all her breathy sensuality in this modest 2011 showbiz tale. Directed by British TV veteran Simon Curtis and written by Adrian Hodges, the film depicts a minor piece of motion picture lore based on the memoirs of Colin Clark, who was a lowly ""third assistant director"" during the production of the Ruritanian romance,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Prince-and-the-Showgirl/dp/B00005RRJY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Prince and the Showgirl</a>. The mostly forgotten 1957 movie marked Monroe's attempt at being taken seriously as an actress in a well-publicized collaboration with Sir Laurence Olivier just after she married playwright Arthur Miller.

The story really begins with Monroe's arrival in London to start filming. Fully devoted to Lee Strasberg's school of Method acting, she constantly searches for her character's motivation even within the context of a souffl-light drawing room comedy. With sychophantic acting coach Paula Strasberg constantly by her side, she is chronically tardy on the set keeping her distinguished British company of thespians waiting for hours. Monroe's already renowned insecurities become heightened by Olivier's abrasive impatience as not only her co-star but her director. As a witness to her undeniable aura, the young Colin becomes smitten as he is assigned to be her protector when she begins to bond with him after Miller returns to New York. This leads to a getaway visiting Windsor Castle and Eton College before a comparatively more confident Monroe returns to the set. The film is bookended by Williams' fearlessly entertaining takes on the Monroe classics, Irving Berlin's ""Heat Wave"" and Harold Arlen's ""That Old Black Magic"" (although completely out of their original context).

Williams tackles the impossible with her empathetic performance as Monroe, and she manages it with aplomb without resorting to outright impersonation. One deliberate exception is the enchanting little dance she does as her character in the movie within the movie - she mimics Monroe perfectly in those few moments. Eddie Redmayne plays the callow Colin to the best of the screenplay's workmanlike limitations since the only hint of complexity is breaking the heart of the young costumer played in a fetching manner by an underused Emma Watson. As Olivier, Kenneth Branagh captures the ego-driven bluster and measured speech cadence of the legendary actor, but he is also underserved by Hodges' script. Judi Dench again steals her scenes as a fellow scene-stealer, Dame Sybil Thorndike. Barely making a ripple in the story are Julia Ormond as Olivier's then-wife, Vivien Leigh, with just a hint given of her descent into madness, and Dougray Scott as a taciturn Miller. For all its flaws, the film is worth seeing for Williams' mesmerizing work, for example, the scene where she romps through the English countryside conveying Monroe's sense of freedom in a way that recalls a similarly poignant scene in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Misfits/dp/B00005AUKC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Misfits</a>.",1322092800,103,3544,5.774378585086042

4620995,1,B0059XTUB8,"Ridiculous!  The film makes Marilyn out to be a moronic bimbo.  Michelle Williams' performance is strange and unconvincing.  In fact, if I hadn't known from the title that this was a portrayal of Marilyn Monroe I would have never guessed that was who Michelle was attempting to imitate.  Just dreadful.
Have the makers of this disaster ever actually seen any films of Marilyn Monroe?  It seems doubtful.

Also, Michelle (or whoever did her singing for her) sings far too well to capture Marilyn's fragile voice.  People seem to forget that much of Marilyn's actual singing was so bad they had to call in Marni Nixon to dub over the worst of it.  Don't get me wrong, I think Marilyn was a talented comedienne, but a singer?  No way!  And as the film opens with a fictional ""live"" musical number, the entire illusion of Marilyn is already shattered before any dialogue is spoken.",1475539200,2,877,4.7105263157894735

4620997,4,B0059XTUB8,"Michelle Williams nailed it. She captured the essence, vulnerability and physical mannerisms of Marilyn Monroe.

Eddie was good as the innocent young man enraptured with the magnetic star.  Kenneth was a little hamy but the rest of the movie made up for the times when the actors didn't nail it.",1473206400,,295,4.88
4620998,4,B0059XTUB8,"Not being interested in Marilyn, I wasn't in a rush to see this film.  However, I'm glad I did, because I did like it.  I thought that all of the acting was excellent with Michelle being outlier, with that said though, it is very difficult to play a real life person, in particular an actress who is acting.  I think a major hurdle for her was that she fully didn't look like Marilyn.  She didn't have Marilyn's hips, and the added padding to try to give her some was painfully fake.  More importantly, she did not have Marilyn's eyes, and Marilyn was all about the eyes.  She had eyelids that would go on for days, which Michelle did not.  (I'm actually not sure why the make-up people didn't just do a quick fix for that by discretely placing a thin piece of tape in the middle of her upper lid in such a way as to move the crease to back give her 'lids.')  Anyway, the first half hour of the movie where we were getting to know Colin was probably the best part.  Then the movie seemed to drag on for the remaining hour, which was the part about the romance between Colin and Marilyn.  Colin was the interesting part, and the original storyline of him struggling to please his parents was never re-visited.  Plus, the relationship between the two seemed highly implausible.  Does Colin (who wrote the book/film) really expect readers/viewers to believe that Marilyn initiated going skinny dipping with him and then told him that she had something in her eye?  Someone that beautiful would never need to use a line like that while naked, or not even with clothing.  So, I agree with those who recognize this as fiction.  Nonetheless, it was an interesting film with great scenery and excellent acting.  Even if the story line wasn't true, it's still a movie worth seeing, if for no other reason than to weigh in with a critique.",1472774400,2,1829,4.496969696969697

4621153,4,B0059XTUB8,"My Week with Marilyn is film that was based on two books by Colin Clark that narrates the story of Marilyn Monroe when she was in the process of making the film,The Prince And The Showgirl with Sir Laurence Olivier. It focuses on the time that Clark spent with Marilyn at London after the latter's husband left for the country. It stars Michelle Williams as Marilyn together with Kenneth Branagh, Eddie Redmayne, Dominic Cooper, Julia Ormond, Emma Watson and Judi Dench.

It was the summer of 1956. Colin Clark from Oxford was determined to make his way in the film business. He started by working as a lowly assistant on the set of 'The Prince and the Showgirl'. When Arthur Miller left for England, Colin introduced himself to Marilyn and introduced her to some of the pleasures of British life. Together,they spent an idyllic week in which he escorted a her to various places in London as she desperate to get away from her from the pressures of work and life as a movie star.

No question about it that Michelle Williams was definitely wonderful in her performance as Marilyn Monroe. That alone will keep the viewer interested all through out the film. Credit also should be given to the wonderful cast who also provided worthy acting just like Williams. In addition to that,we also get to witness other aspects of Marilyn's personality that is little known to the public like her flaws as an individual,her weaknesses and her vulnerability to the public pressure of being a Hollywood superstar.

4621243,4,B0059XTUB8,"But this is not total movie magic. I was touched by this movie, there were moments I could lose myself in  its conventions and narrative. There was always something missing. The movie - My Week with Marilyn attempts to operate at several levels. The author of the original story, Colin Clark asks us to believe this as his personal story. The director asks us suspend disbelief in favor of his vision and the various actors ask us to believe their portrayals of historic peoples. Each request is served well enough but the result is less than the parts.

Colin Clark tells us he is a younger and less accomplished son of Lord Kenneth Clark.  Desperate to make his own way he signs on as 3rd assistant (think modern studio intern) to a movie company owned by and about to star Sir Laurence Olivier (Kenneth Branagh). The movie will costar American star and sex symbol Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams). Ms. Monroe arrives newly married to play wright Author Miller, but her newly wed state does not keep Sir Laurence and every male for miles around from lusting after her.

Ms Monroe is not able to absorb the weight of her sexual popularity, is not confident in her acting skills and is not well served by her entourage. She is surrounded by people who will stroke her ego and drug her into compliance and other wise fail to give her the simple faith that might better serve her emotional needs.

Enter the new hired 3rd assistant. His loyalties are assumed to be with his titled employer, but between his own desires for Marilyn, native innocence and a sense of kindred spirit, becomes the person that the nearly over whelmed actress can trust. The romance is that she can love him, trust him even with her body and to strain the analogy be ""naked"" with him without him using her.  By making no demands on Marilyn, Colin becomes her strength.

The Marilyn story we believe is that she was a timid soul thrust into stardom before she learned to trust her skills. She would fear that she would never be taken seriously. Her fears and her experience with a variety of people, who used her, reinforced those fears. A Hollywood system that tended to abuse drugs as the cure all would, according to this version ultimately destroy her. This is the MM who inhabits this movie, but we also get to see the woman who could be ""Her"" at will and who mostly needed time to not have to be ""Her""

In one sentence Michelle Williams is not MM. She never captures her breathy vocal style and is not that perfect as a body double. This is not a fatal flaw.  There are moments, poses and smiles when you can believe that the Michelle is channeling Marilyn. There are others when she is only<?> delivering a nuanced and top rate performance.

There is a tradition in acting that there are no small parts only small actors. Somehow the British take this as a matter of honor. Dame Judy Dench as Dame Sybil Thorndike commands her every scene and it feels rude to mention she is here as minor supporting actress. Downton Abby's head butler, Jim Carter, has perhaps two scenes, and plays them as if the movie was about a pub owner named Barry. By the time we get to the leading supporting actors: Emma Watson proves she is an actress and will take supporting roles and deliver. Her fellow Harry Potter performer, Zo Wanamaker gives us an intense if somewhat too self-important Paula Strasberg. The great Kenneth Branagh gives us a living Sir Laurence Olivier. It is a role that requires his to be more of a caricature than a true leading man, and Branagh accepts that it is not about him.

The single moment that best symbolizes the historic tension between an English tradition of film acting trying to shed its Royal Shakespearean acting tradition in favor of an emerging American movie acting style is the arrival of a luminous , white dressed MM facing off against the assemble British cast all attired in various high Victorian uniforms and formal bejeweled dresses. It is unclear who is more afraid of whom.  As powerful as this moment is, the British had been making successful movies for decades; many staring the historic actors being portrayed in this cast. I was never convinced that the movie: The Princess and the Showgirl represented that kind of change in the history of movie making.

Likewise I could never accept Colin as that innocent. One suspects that Colin Clark, 23 raised to wealth and more subtle than he could admit was making deliberate choices based on an independent view of how to best server his masters and Marilyn. Ultimately this 1 week idyll was too idyllic for me to fully accept.

My Week with Marilyn has more than enough that is right for me to recommend it. This is a good movie with a cast that achieves some A list performances in wonderfully re-imagined period sets, but...",1409961600,,4793,4.623529411764705

The Goddess doesn't constantly force us to compare Kim Stanley's fantastic performance with the real Marilyn Monroe, because it doesn't constantly CALL her Marilyn Monroe. My Week with Marilyn doesn't give us that freedom, the freedom to appreciate Michelle Williams's performance on its own merits rather than as an impersonation of a much more charismatic and distinctive star than she is herself.

Viewers more familiar with Williams than with Monroe can rave about this performance, because they're not comparing it to anything. To them, Monroe is just a dizzy blonde standing over a subway grate with her skirt billowing up around her, and Williams plays THAT role as well as anyone else could. But she can't for one second deceive anybody who has experienced Monroe (seeing her is only part of the delight) in more than one scene from one movie.

Half of Monroe's power as a performer is in her face, one of the most beautiful and naturally expressive faces God ever made, and that's why NO actress can EVER successfully play her. No one else has that face.

Using a fictitious name would also have relieved them of having to portray the insufferably shallow and narcissistic Laurence Olivier, the most overrated actor who ever lived. I realize that they based this movie on Colin Clark's highly dubious and self-aggrandizing ""memoirs"" of his brief contact with Monroe, and therefore had some justification for their choices, but that was a mistake.

One of many mistakes. Worst: the stupid screenplay, which treated Clark's adolescent fantasy as truth and made it even more ludicrous than it already was. Second: the hackneyed direction that makes a story about interesting and real people seem as false as a soap opera. Third: the miscasting of every role in the movie.

Although the most egregiously miscast are Dougray Scott as Arthur Miller, Dominic Cooper as Milton Greene, and plodding Julia Ormond as ethereal Vivien Leigh, NONE of the actors convincingly portray the real persons they are supposed to be. Even Judi Dench is maudlin and icky as the decidedly UN-maudlin and UN-icky Sybil Torndike. I suppose Branagh is sufficiently pretentious and boring as Olivier, but the movie would have been better without that character.

The one good thing about this movie is that it calls attention to Marilyn Monroe. If it had motivated even one person who'd never done so to watch her movies, it would have been worthwhile.",1409097600,3,2854,5.2319474835886215

4621268,4,B0059XTUB8,"My friend commented leaving the theater, If you have to remind yourself that this isn't really Marilyn
Monroe, then the movie works. And that might be exactly what the Academy says if it honors actress
Michelle Williams with an Oscar nomination for her role as the Hollywood icon in the new film My
Week with Marilyn. What is so striking beyond Williams mannerisms so reminiscent of Monroe is the
films treatment of this sad and troubled celebrity.
The film is about the time Colin Clark spent as an assistant director during the filming of The Prince and
the Showgirl in 1956. Clark is played by Eddie Redmayne, who won the 2010 Tony Award for his
performance in the play Red. The film starred Monroe and Sir Laurence Olivier (played in this movie by
Kenneth Branagh). In the story, Monroe befriends Clark, and the two have an emotional affair during the
shooting of the film. It is through Clarks calming influence that Monroe is able to stay focused and finish
the film.
Clark is infatuated with a wardrobe assistant named Lucy, who is played by Harry Potter star Emma
Watson. Im not sure if this is exactly the first time Ive seen Watson outside her role as Hermione
Granger, but it has to be one of the first. And what film is Judi Dench not in these days (here she plays
actress Dame Sybil Thamdike)?
As historical narratives go, this film is much better than J. Edgar, and as far as film industry introspection,
it is more moving than Hugo. To those who say, She wanted a life of fame and glory, she should have
known what to expect, see the movie. The films portrayal of her insecurities, her entourage of
opportunists, her uncertainty, fears all brilliantly captured by a well-written script, beautiful scenes,

Even with Marilyn's hair and make-up, Michelle Williams was just plain.  She is a very skinny person and did not personify Marilyn Monroe.  Marilyn had a natural sex appeal that Michelle is seriously lacking.  When I watch a Marilyn Monroe film, I cannot take my eyes off her-but when I saw this-all I wanted to do was look away.

It is a rare glimpse into the Private Hells of extremely talented thespians and ""How to cope with the Horrors of Production and Very Personal Ghosts"".  It's quite a challenge to tell Branagh and Olivier apart - Branagh captures all the quirky mannerisms, the speech patterns and the man's immense  .... grandeur.  The attempted script read-through on the sound stage at the beginning is especially  delightful ... almost as if everyone is speaking a foreign language - Translator anyone?.

BUT it is not only Marilyn who has 'problems' - we briefly touch on Vivien Leigh's crumbling after the ""Elephant Walk "" fiasco.  Julia Ormond's cameo as Leigh is precise and spot-on.  Poor Olivier caught between Monroe and Leigh!

Michelle Williams as ""Norma Jean - Marilyn"" creates all the right tones and is very moving especially with Eddie Redmayne [the ""3rd"" Director].  Redmayne becomes her salvation during this torturous 'shoot' - which should have been simple and straight-forward .... but never try to mix 'the Method' and Comedy ...... [Dustin Hoffman shows us 'how' in 'Tootsie'].

Bringing up the rear so to speak we have Judy Dench as a very sympathetic Dame  Sybil Thorndike  - not forgetting the refreshing Emma Watson who brings a welcome touch of sanity to the show.

Overall it's really quite a charming nod at  'culture' or is 'acting' technique clashes during the mid 1950 ties ....... the very 'technical and painfully cerebral' meeting the 'mumble and grunt' method approach.

Footnote : Paula Strasberg was not Marilyn's first ""Acting Coach in residence"" - prior to Paula, Natasha Lytess.filled that role.

Her teeth are distractingly huge and the rest of her is a skinny twig - nothing like MM.  The Colin character is a brainless zombie with absolutely no backbone.

4621365,5,B0059XTUB8,"My week with Marilyn tells the story of the filming of the movie The Prince and The Showgirl from the late 1950s.  Specifically how the third assistant director on the film (or gopher as is more aptly titled) played by Eddie Redmayne befriended and ultimately fell in love with Marilyn Monroe, played by Michelle Williams.  It does a great job telling the story of how unreliable she could be to work with and how Laurence Olivier, portrayed wonderfully by Kenneth Branagh, who was the star and director of that movie both despised, and was in awe of Marilyn.  He put up with her both because, he was trying to use her appeal as being the biggest actress in the world at the time to revive his lagging career and because he wanted to sleep with her.

For Williams part, although she did not have the appeal of Marilyn (although lets face it few actresses before her or since could even come close) she did very well at showing her vulnerability, flaws and loneliness.  She did a good job at showing that the public face Marilyn gave was just an act, and was not really her.  And while the movie does not deal with her death, it certainly sows the seeds of the fact that it was that duality and both not wanting the fame, but not being able to give it up that caused her to drink and become more and more dependent on pills to function which ultimately led to her death.

As for extras on the blu ray there is a commentary track on the movie and a 20min making of/behind the scenes feature.  Not a lot, but okay for this kind of movie.",1395532800,,1534,4.339160839160839

Colin Clark (Redmayne) is a 23 year-old from an aristocratic family (renowned art historian, Sir Kenneth Clark, is his father) who signs on with Laurence Olivier's production company as a gopher prior to the shooting of the 1957 film, The Prince and the Showgirl, with Olivier (Branagh) and Marilyn Monroe (Williams) in the leads. It's an unlikely pairing as Olivier is widely acknowledged as the finest classically trained actor of the time while Monroe has achieved international icon status playing ditzy sex kittens but now aspires to be a serious Method actress. Olivier becomes increasingly frustrated with Monroe's unprofessional behavior; she's regularly late for shootings and often is unable to remember her lines. In the midst of this tense situation the emotionally fractured Monroe turns to young Clark as an improbable ally, confidante, and lover.

Michelle Williams' Oscar-nominated performance is breathtaking. She simply NAILS the part of the desperately troubled Monroe. Kenneth Branagh gives a very commendable turn as Olivier and Redmayne does fine duty as the young man in way over his head. Julia Ormond is exquisite as Olivier's wife, actress Vivien Leigh, and Dench, Watson, and Wanamaker are wonderful in their small roles. It's a great cast and a delightful and bittersweet story.

4621441,3,B0059XTUB8,"It's a semi-interesting film, depending on the ongoing popularity of Marilyn Monroe to sell it.  'Sort of like the many films about Jackie Kennedy and Princess Di.  This one is patterned after an alleged almost-romance with a young English fellow who worked on the set of the film she made with Lawrence Olivier.  I think the problem, other than the difficulty of finding anyone to do justice to Marilyn, is that the story is so thin.  It's about this Englishman who manages to get a job on the film set and then again manages to spend a little time with her.  It's more about him than about her but of course no one cares about him.  If they had had a real romance that might have been more of a story...but apparently this was little more than a school boy crush....a few encounters that he embellished greatly in his own imagination....wrote a book about it and now this film. You have to give him credit for parlay something very slight into a major motion picture.

As others have said, Michelle Williams does a wonderful job in an impossible task....who could play such a person?  Michelle captures the vulnerability, innocence, and lost-child qualities of Marilyn beautifully.  What she lacks is the  sheer sexiness.  Her scenes where she is ""successful"" in the film, playing the naughty showgirl are not convincing, and almost embarrassing.  The fellow who plays Colin, the young star struck fellow, is good as the innocent caught up in first love.  Emma Roberts is noteworthy in a small role as the wardrobe girl (not the acting coach as the Amazon reviewer stated.).  Kenneth Branagh is one dimensional as a constantly annoyed Lawrence Olivier.  I had to wonder if the real Olivier was that mean.  Also suspect to me was the character of Paula Strasburg, who was portrayed as almost an evil enabler of Marilyn's unreliabiltiy.

Since the story line is so flimsy and hard to beileve, the success of the film rests on the somewhat fragile shoulders of Michelle Williams to convince all the viewers that she is Marilyn.  It's a terribly difficult job and she does a heroic job, but that's not enough to make a  totally satisfying film.",1385856000,3,2142,4.7405405405405405

Marilyn had just married Arthur Miller and had signed onto making a movie with Lawrence Olivier to prove to the world, and to herself, that she really was a great actress.

4621492,5,B0059XTUB8,"Director Simon Curtis has gifted us with the intimate profile of the pop icon--a tale highly reminiscent of a similar 50s era saga, ""My Favorite Year"", presented through the eyes of a young Englishman beginning his own remarkable journey.
  Our inaugural view of Marilyn Monroe is during a scene of her giving a performance of her classic show tunes, courtesy of Michelle Williams in her formidable Oscar-nominated, Golden Globe winning effort. It has not been lost on me that the father of Williams' child was a blond actor who was found dead and nude in his bed after a drug overdose, just like Marilyn, and perhaps Ms. Williams considered this role to be somewhat therapeutic.
  Watching her onscreen is young Colin Clark(Britain's ""It"" Boy of the moment, Eddie Redmayne)the odd-man out in a prominent British family of high achievers. Despite opposition from his father (Pip Torrens), the soon-to-be- 24-year-old seeks a position with Laurence Olivier Productions at Pinewood Studios, where his idol and family friend, Olivier( a sublime Kenneth Branagh, who fulfills the prediction of his being Olivier's successor by, barring the difference in height and eye color, capturing Britain's most formidable thespian of the 20th century almost completely to the life) works.
  After many days of sitting on the couch of the office waiting room, Olivier offers Colin a promised position on a film at the urging of his wife, Vivien Leigh (Julia Ormond). Colin becomes the 3rd assistant director on a film Olivier is directing, tentatively titled, ""The Sleeping Prince"", which would later be revealed to the world as ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" (1957). As he learns his job, Colin becomes acquainted with such luminaries as a generous Dame Sybil Thorndike( Judi Dench), and begins a romance with a reluctant but savvy wardrobe girl named Lucy Armstrong(an intelligent post-Harry Potter era Emma Watson), which will be interrupted by the celebrated arrival of Marilyn and her husband of only three weeks, playwright Arthur Miller(Dougray Scott). Toby Jones, Marilyn's publicist, is among the journalists who speak with them and the Oliviers at a subsequent press conference, in which Marilyn gives her legendary guileless quips, a hallmark of her public persona.
 Colin secures a house for the couple to stay in, therein which will take place more drama than any on the script. He will be present during the tempestuous disagreement between the newlywed Millers, which results in Miller going home to see his children in the States. Marilyn's people, including Method Acting pioneer, Paula Strassberg(Zoe Wannamaker), and her co-production manager , Milton Greene(Dominic Cooper) are there to reassure her, and will have to continue to do so during a filming session as troubled as the star herself.
 Characteristically, Marilyn shows up late during the initial read-through of the script, and Colin and Dame Sybil will be the only ones who are sympathetic to her. Olivier, who at one point insults Marilyn by telling her to ""just look sexy"" when he expresses difficulty in portraying her character, Elsie Marina, will find her even more difficult to work with as a result of that.
 When he was supposed to have been on a date with Lucy, Colin is summoned to Marilyn's house to give her his perspective on the shoot, since he can see all sides of the situation. They have a drink and a walk in the garden before Marilyn must answer her husband's long-distance call, and the bodyguard sees Colin out.
 Greene confronts Colin about visiting Marilyn at her house, warning him that he will be just another brief fling for her as he once was. To Greene's ire, Colin dismisses his advice.
 Lucy expresses her hurt at having been stood up by Colin. In the meantime, Vivien Leigh, who had originated the part of Elsie onstage, becomes emotional at seeing the filmed footage of Marilyn in her former role and does not wish her husband well in his dealings with Marilyn.
  There are charming moments on the set, such as the filming of ""Elsie"" rehearsing her chorus girl number.
  But their one day off from work, Greene's admonishments for Colin about only having a professional relationship with Marilyn fall by the wayside, and Colin is seen getting into a car in which Marilyn is hiding under a blanket, wishing to take him on an adventure to the strains on Nat King Cole's contemporary tune, ""You Stepped Out of a Dream"".
  After a fleeting moment of wandering in a park, light of heart and fancy free, they travel to Windsor Castle at Colin's suggestion, where they are warmly greeted by the Castle's Librarian, Colin's godfather, Sir Owen Mooreshead(Derek Jacobi). Marilyn admires a picture book with the works of Hans Holbein, and then views the royal dollhouse, during which her personal longing for the idyllic family life she never had is expressed in her conversation. Well wishers applaud having the star in their midst after the tour.
  Their next stop is Colin's alma mater, Eaton, where, upon learning that the penalty for idleness is whipping, the star warns the young men crowding around her to work hard to avoid that fate, evoking a cheeky response by one of the students.
  Ironically, given her behavior, Olivier may have felt like whipping her given her frequent tardiness and ill preparation for her own job, although at one point he does express his admiration for Marilyn, given how tough an actress had to be to achieve her level of fame.
  Before the outing ends, Colin finds himself living la vida loca with the star as she takes an illicit skinny dip in a pond, and they share a kiss. As they travel home for the evening, Marilyn's countenance is wistful and the strains of Nat King Cole's ""Autumn Leaves"" sum up the mood perfectly.
  Colin will tend to the ill and emotionally needy star, whose frequently erratic behavior may have been a sign of the mental illness that resulted in her own mother's being institutionalized, through overdoses, and her first miscarriage before the shoot is over. An apologetic Marilyn will leave the set escorted by her sycophantic followers, but personally thank the up-and-coming young film producer in the presence of the pop-eyed pub keeper(Jim Carter) who had been skeptical of Colin's association with the star.
  Indeed, it was quite a week and quite an emotional roller coaster for the young man with a promising future.
  Bypassing the tragedy of the star's premature demise, the film focuses on the subsequent successes of Olivier, Monroe, and Clark, the last of whom left the world with an account of the Hollywood legend that he chose to remember joyously.",1376179200,,6619,4.980943738656987
4621493,3,B0059XTUB8,Don't have much to say about this movie it was ok.  This is all I have to say about this movie,1374192000,,94,3.4761904761904763
4621494,4,B0059XTUB8,"First, some background. This film encompasses the summer of 1956, in which Marilyn Monroe travelled to London in order to star alongside Lawrence Olivier in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Prince-and-the-Showgirl/dp/B006SA5XRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Prince and the Showgirl</a>, a light romantic comedy. She was hoping to gain some credit as a serious actress, whilst he (or at least the version of him that exists in this film) wants to recapture his youth. And how better to do that than opposite the world's most desirable actress? Marilyn was still six years away from her death-by-overdose in 1962, but that foreknowledge casts a shadow over the entire film, for the cracks in her life and psyche that ultimately drive her to her untimely end are apparent throughout.

Based on the memoirs of Colin Clark, a twenty-three year old at the time, he shares in his biographic account&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Week-with-Marilyn/dp/0006531792/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Week with Marilyn</a>&nbsp;that he - well, quite obviously spent time with the famous movie star. As third assistant to the director, Clark struck up a friendship with Marilyn that left enough of an impression on him that he was compelled to write about it many years later in the book of the same name, and upon which this screenplay is based.

It's really quite a simple bio-pic, chronicling the behind-the-scenes drama of the filming of ""The Prince and the Showgirl"", as well as portraying snippets of the movie itself and Colin Clark's budding relationship with Marilyn. The woman was notoriously difficult to work with on-set, keeping her co-stars waiting for hours while she prepared and frustrating the director with her attempts to get inside her character's head even though the role itself was feather-light. The stress gets to her, and it's only when she reaches out to Clark as a confidante that things begin to get back on track - though this comes at a heavy personal cost to Clark.

The film is jam-packed full of British thespians playing other British thespians. Kenneth Branagh as Lawrence Olivier, Julia Ormond as Vivien Leigh and Judi Dench as Dame Sybil Thorndike, as well as Dougray Scott as Marilyn's American husband Arthur Miller, Dominic Cooper as photographer Milton Greene, Zoe Wanamaker as Marilyn's acting coach Paula Strasberg, and Emma Watson as Clark's love interest Lucy (possibly the only fictional character in the whole piece). Heck, even Derek Jacobi pops in for a brief cameo.

Some of these actors are better showcased than others, but in their short amount of time, each one manages to not only project an understanding of their own character, but to demonstrate just how much of a turbulent impact Marilyn had on their lives. As the protagonist, Eddie Remayne does his best with a wafer-thin character, but let's face it - in a role that requires little beyond looking dazed and awestruck, he simply exists as an audience surrogate for viewers to experience the Marilyn effect. Most of the time he just stares at the actress in awe, and as early as the first three seconds of the film, in which his voice-over narration is discussing his background, you're already thinking: ""who cares? Get to Marilyn!""

And it is Michelle William's performance as Marilyn that naturally provides the film its purpose, a challenge that she tackles with remarkable self-possession. Who would have thought that the girl from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dawson-s-Creek/dp/B005CGI3ZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dawson's Creek</a>&nbsp;had this in her? In her hands, it's easy to see why the world was so captivated by the woman she plays, and Williams captures Marilyn's breathy speech patterns, fragile beauty, effortless sensuality and enigmatic nature with eerie accuracy. The entire purpose of the movie is really a character-study of one of the most famous film actresses of all time, and you find yourself scrutinizing her every time she's on-screen. At times confident, skittish, cheerful, seductive, vulnerable, childish and desperately unhappy, it's difficult to pin her down - which is precisely what makes her so alluring.

While watching, you begin to wonder: it is Marilyn's personality or the mystique surrounding her that enchants everyone? Is she really as vulnerable and helpless as she seems, or does she know exactly what she's doing when she makes the rest of the cast wait hours for her? What is hurting her more, her army of sycophants or her impatient critics? And who has the woman's true measure? Lawrence Olivier loses his patience with her on more than one occasion, yet ultimately acknowledges that her instinctual ability to work the camera is like nothing he's ever seen before. Vivien Leigh sees only a beautiful young starlet that reminds her of her own advancing age. Clingy Paula Strasberg does more harm than good when it comes to coaching Marilyn in method acting. Arthur Miller confesses that his wife ""is devouring me,"" whilst Milton Greene jealously warns Clark that Marilyn's only interest is in breaking hearts. Sybil Thorndike is gently encouraging, and Clark is just hopelessly smitten.

The final conclusion drawn is that despite her apparent instability, a woman like Marilyn Monroe needs to be as tough as nails to make it in Hollywood - though her eventual fate surely puts a damper on this interpretation. Yet as she says to Clark in the movie's final moments; as much as her lifestyle is harming her, she cannot do without it - demonstrated by a telling little scene in which she and Clark are accosted by a group of fans, Marilyn whispers: ""shall I be her?"" and so instantly transforms from a demure young woman to a smoldering sexpot.

The time period is beautifully rendered through costuming, location and props, and despite the film's rather slow pacing and lack of any real narrative drive (in my father's words: ""this was the most boring movie I've ever seen"") those who are interested in the subject matter of old films and the actors/actresses that starred in them may be intrigued by what ""My Week With Marilyn"" has to share.",1373587200,,6232,5.332655137334689

4621559,4,B0059XTUB8,"This enjoyable movie captures the dichotomy of Marilyn Monroe: worshiped to near-hysteria in the public, insecure to the state of near-paralysis in private.  What better way to encapsulate the jarring juxtaposition of those two ill-fitting half-lives than by adapting Colin Clark's fascinating memoir for the big screen. Clark's tale would seem almost Melvin Dummar-esque in its 'truthiness' were it not for this fact: it's the truth.  Clark's recounting of his brief, unexpected role in Monroe's brief, ultimately tragic life during the filming of 1956's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Prince-and-the-Showgirl/dp/B006SA5XRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Prince and the Showgirl</a>&nbsp;seems the stuff of fantasy.  That Clark released it only in 1995 (under the title&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Prince-the-Showgirl-and-Me-Six-Months-on-the-Set-With-Marilyn-and-Olivier/dp/0312143958/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Prince, the Showgirl, and Me: Six Months on the Set With Marilyn and Olivier</a>&nbsp;some 40 years after its unfolding gives one a clear indication of how dear this memory must have remained to his heart. The movie brings across the sense of wonder and serendipity that he must have felt as these events fell into his lap.

And who better to capture that feeling than Eddie Redmayne - fresh-faced, eager, brimming with action and yet-unsullied innocence. He's perfect for the role.  As noted by others, Michelle Williams - beautiful in real-life but no one's first thought as a va-va-voom blonde in the curvy Monroe mold - undergoes a physical impressive transformation here to inhabit the very bones and spirit of one of the world's most iconographic women.  I recommend seeing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wendy-and-Lucy/dp/B0029DV2OE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wendy and Lucy</a>&nbsp;to see Williams au natural to get a good idea how afield Monroe is for her physically.  Impressive stuff.

There's a treasure trove of other actors here in juicy, sometimes smaller, roles: Kenneth Branagh (so different here than in 'Wallender') as Laurence Olivier; Julia Ormond (who I'd put in every movie) as his then-wife, Vivian Leigh; Dame Judy Dench as co-star Dame Sybil Thorndike; Emma Watson as Lucy, a co-worker and romantic interest for Redmayne's character; and Dominic Cooper (see him in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-s-Double/dp/B006022NRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil's Double</a>!) as Milton Greene, co-owner (with the actress) of her production company.  Plus, a little Jim Carter for us Downton fans.  That's a stellar cast.",1366502400,,2757,6.784702549575071
4621560,3,B0059XTUB8,"During the filming of ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" (London 1956) Colin Clark - 3rd Assistant Director on the movie spent some private time with Marilyn Monroe. The book ""My Week with Marilyn"" is a very heartfelt & intimate journal in which Mr. Clark shares his personal memoir of that time. I am pleased to note that the movie follows his account quite accurately.

The problem with the movie is that as good as the actors may be when it comes to supreme icons such as Marilyn Monroe & Sir Laurence Olivier & Vivien Leigh it is just not likely to work.

These icons had something that transcended physical looks, it came across from within, a spark, an intangible aura & regardless of how well an actor can act it is simply not possible to bring that same ""It"" factor to life. Charisma can't be `created', either you have it or you don't.

It would be a disservice to say that Michelle Williams did not do a good job portraying Marilyn Monroe, I am sure she did the best she could, but Ms. Williams is no Marilyn Monroe. Kenneth Branagh, wonderful actor that he is, is no Olivier. Julia Ormond is a wonderful & beautiful actress but she is not Vivien Leigh & through no fault of her own it simply was not believable. Dame Judi Dench did a masterful job of portraying Dame Sybil Thorndike & Eddie Redmayne was very good as Colin Clark, other than that none of it felt true.

I watched ""The Price and the Showgirl"" right after I read Colin Clark's book & that was a hundred times more enjoyable to me!",1366156800,,1500,4.404332129963899

Everyone has talked about Michelle Williams portrayal as Marilyn Monroe, which was very good, but I have to give actor Kenneth Branagh a lot of credit for his role as Sir Laurence Olivier. He had his mannerisms and attitude down so well, even the tone of the voice sounded just like Olivier at times. The story is about filmmaker and author Colin Clark wanting to get into the film business. His first job was on Olivier's film The Prince and the Showgirl starring Marilyn Monroe. By chance he strikes up a friendship with her that takes him on the best and most heartbreaking week of his life. The emotional journey was heartbreaking and enjoyable (if that makes any kind of sense), but I simply loved it. Great film.",1365897600,2,788,4.635714285714286

4621583,4,B0059XTUB8,"Even though I felt somewhat prepared going into this movie, My Week with Marilyn was much sadder than I expected.  The story follows a young man, Colin, who is working on the set and has dream of producing.  Lucky for him, his first movie is with Marilyn Monroe.  Marilyn quickly takes a liking to Colin and without delay Colin does to her.  Marilyn was a well hated actress by this point by her peers and was an all together mess.  She is always inebriated and suffers serious mood swings.  Even though Marilyn is married, she and Colin do engage in an affair.  The story line is a bit transparent but the over all movie was enjoyable to watch.  I would say its more of a rent than a buy.",1365465600,,689,4.286821705426356
4621584,4,B0059XTUB8,"If you would have told me that Jen from ""Dawson's Creek"" would someday morph into Marilyn Monroe, I would have laughed.  Michelle Williams literally disappears into the iconic role, portraying the actress during the filming of ""The Prince and the Showgirl,""  as she battelsd her insecuriteis while attempting to branch into a more dramatic role starring opposite Sir Lawrence Olivier.  Kenneth Brannagh, whose own career has so many comparisons to Olivier, portrays the actor/director who is less than enthusiastic to have the starlet on the set with all her drama. The story revolves around the relationship that developed between Colin Clark, a smitten aristocrat turned directors assitant and the starlet when he is assigned to be watch over her during the tense production.

Great casting, with a veritable who's who of British thespians, including Judi Dench and Derek Jacobi, it is an entertaining look at a brief period in the tumultuous life of one of the worlds most famous and fragile actresses.",1365379200,2,1005,5.185185185185185

4621636,5,B0059XTUB8,"Marilyn Monroe was still a huge star when I reached my teens just as ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" was being filmed in 1957. I had a huge crush on her...just as most kids my age and older. I saw many of her films in the theater back then and have viewed most of them since. She was a huge star of course (ranked #6 among all female actors by AFI) and sex symbol; and with the right role and direction, she was also an excellent actress. I never knew back then how troubled and fragile and insecure she was; how difficult she was to work with; or about her prescription drug and alcohol abuse. This film is only a mini-biopic of Marilyn, but it does a great job of portraying her as she was in 1957, when she had already started down the road that led to her premature death. Michelle Williams, who bears more than a passing resemblance to Monroe, and is also drop-dead gorgeous, performs masterfully in the title role. Eddie Redmayne, in a breakout performance, also performs superbly as the young starstruck assistant director, Colin Clark, who is assigned to keep up w/Marilyn; and in the process, gains her confidence and falls in love w/her. The story is fact based, adapted from Clark's two books on his time w/Marilyn in 1957. The director and co-star of ""The Prince and the Showgirl"", was the great actor, Sir Lawrence Olivier, played by Kenneth Branagh, in his usual outstanding manner. Also look for excellent performances from Judi Dench who plays actress, Sybil Thorndike; and Emma Watson, in one of her first roles outside the ""Harry Potter"" series; as a wardrobe assistant, who is Colin's love interest before and after his week with Marilyn. This is a great film...one of the 10 best of 2011 in my opinion.",1360540800,6,1720,4.587662337662338

4621639,4,B0059XTUB8,I am personally a huge movie fan of all styles and types I went into this movie with an open mind and heart because I wanted to make up my own mind about what happened in the movie.  Michelle Williams did a very good job acting in this movie as Marilyn beyond what people have already posted about her acting chops in this movie as the icon Marilyn.  But for myself what added to the movie was the addition of actor Kenneth Branagh as Sir Laurence Olivier great acting job by him and Judi Dench also great job on her character.  But in my viewpoint its still a great movie to enjoy when you have a free night to watch a good movie with a good cast within the movie.  I have to say Michelle Williams has come a very long way from her days on tv shows inculding Dawson's Creek.

4621743,2,B0059XTUB8,"""She's the greatest piece of ass on earth. With tits like that, you make allowances."" This crude logic proffered by Marilyn Monroe's (Michele Williams) publicist Arthur Jacobs (Toby Jones) sums up how much talent it takes to forge an acting career in Hollywood provided that you've got the right package of bodily goods to ware. Let's admit it: Marilyn probably didn't get her famous role in Some Like It Hot because of her ability to re-create a character; rather, it was one more fulfillment of the persona Hollywood had created for her: that of a coquette who could get leering men hot in the pants by making kissing gestures at them with her forefinger and doing a little bunny-hop dance number. Shallow? Sure. As the old saying goes, sex sells. Sadly, such shallowness also sums up Simon Curtis's My Week With Marilyn, a film that I'd expected much more from.

Despite Williams's captivating and sympathetic performance as Marilyn, the film rambles and lectures, telling us little to nothing we didn't already know. It pretends to focus on a young starstruck university graduate and aspiring film-maker, Colin Clarke (Eddie Redmayne), and the halcyon time he spends with the most celebrated female sex symbol in movie history. Instead, we get a yawnworthy biopic that predictably shines the spotlight on the prima donna. We see Marilyn in all her forms: the consummate cocktease; the frazzled, incoherent druggie; the neurotic, insecure, catatonic mess; the unexpectedly intelligent woman who reads Joyce and Dostoevsky in her free time. In other words, we find out little more than we could have looked up in an encyclopedia or seen on a television retrospective. A good biopic should have more insight than that.

Yet I think the film is indeed clumsily trying to do more than that. Depicting Marilyn's performance in an English movie, The Prince and the Showgirl, as she stars alongside the movie's director Laurence Olivier (Kenneth Branagh), it makes a heavy-handed contrast between the British and American schools of acting. Olivier, portrayed as an unrelenting taskmaster by Branagh, castigates Marilyn for her constant tardiness, breakings-down during rehearsals, and inability to understand her character. He discovers that Marilyn can only method-act in a role she's typecast for; she falls apart when she has to step into an unfamiliar character's shoes. She's a big star but not professionally trained and probably not natively gifted enough to compete with even the lowliest British character actor.

Ironically, though, in My Week With Marilyn the British fall prey to the same hero worship of celebrities. The film's ponderous message boils down to little more than a simplistic observation of humanity's infatuation with stardom. Colin becomes so besotted with Marilyn that he breaks up his down-to earth relationship with Lucy (Emma Watson), the wardrobe assistant he's dating, in the laughably quixotic hope that Marilyn might forget her status as a famous personality and have a fling with a nobody. A co-actor, crone Sybil Thorndike (Judi Dench), builds up Marilyn's self-esteem, telling her that she can be a great actress despite her erratic behavior and incompetence. Even Olivier, despite growling that ""trying to teach Marilyn how to act is like trying to teach Urdu to a badger,"" is completely transfixed by her screen presence, even in her most fumbling and embarrassing moments.

I, too, find her irresistible, but I'd chalk that up to my weakness as a typical lustful, cleavage-loving male. Vicariously living through a star is not my idea of a fulfilling life. Truth be told, Marilyn didn't want to be Marilyn either. ""I just wanted to be loved like a regular girl,"" she tells Colin in one of the film's more poignant moments. Unfortunately, the film never really delves deeper into Marilyn's emotional conflict or her apparent resentment at being manipulated by the movie establishment. We never get more than a superficial glimpse into what made Marilyn the person tick.

If I have neglected to give poor Colin his due, it's because the film practically forgets about his troubles after his opening voiceover, in which he informs us that his family considers him a failure and doesn't approve of what they perceive as his frivolous career choice. It could have made for some interesting storytelling to explore his struggles alongside Marilyn's by showing us what they learn about themselves during their time together. It could have made their relationship seem plausible despite the very different worlds they come from. They've both pushed themselves into a career in the movies to try to conquer their nagging self-doubt. He's trying to escape his stuffy, elitist roots yet desperately wants his family to take notice of him; she wants men to love her more for her brains than her boobs. Their commonality is the alienation they feel as a result. Maybe they could be two kindred spirits after all.

Unfortunately, though, character development is skirted over in My Week With Marilyn as it would be in any C-grade Hollywood production. Like the real Marilyn, this film is making money off a name, failing to supply the substance to warrant its success.

I disagree with those reviewers who said Ms. Williams missed the mark portraying Marilyn due to a lack of charisma, bombshell sex appeal, etc. The film was meant to (and did) portray Marilyn as Colin Clark remembered her during the filming of The Prince and the Showgirl. Read his book and you'll find the film very closely follows it. Both the book and the film describe a woman who was tormented by her own fame and status as a bombshell, which she believed kept her from being taken seriously as an actress, a wife, and a person. Michelle Williams brings Marilyn's insecurity and sadness to this film in a way that is heartbreakingly real.

4621868,3,B0059XTUB8,"Marilyn Monroe captured the public eye until her death from a drug overdose when she was 36 in 1962. Five years before her death, she played an American showgirl opposite Laurence Olivier in the British movie The Prince and the Showgirl. The movie wasn't a big hit. During the production of the movie Marilyn developed a friendship with one of the assistant directors, Colin Clark, following the departure of her husband (then), Arthur Miller. This movie is based on Clark's much later biography which detailed his liaison with Marilyn. The depth of Clark's intimacy with Marilyn as portrayed in his book has been questioned.

The movie is entertaining but slow moving. Michelle Williams is the star, as Marilyn would have been. She portrays a broody, moody, petulant and spoiled star with a hint of naivet. In general, my reaction was, what's all the fuss? The sultry, sexy, melt your heart Marilyn was hard to find.

Michelle Williams embodies the troubled young starlet without always looking like Marilyn. Her performance, along with a strong cast including Kenneth Branagh, Eddie Redmayne, Dame Judi Dench,and Julia Ormond cannot, however, overcome what essentially is a rather boring story about a boring young man who spent a short time with the sexiest woman in the world.

I'm sorry but I've never understood the onscreen appeal of Kenneth Branagh (nor Laurence Olivier bar his roles in Marathon Man and Boys From Brazil--both with Nazi themes so Freudians have a field day with that). Sure, Branagh is a great Shakespearean actor but, sorry, I don't get him at all.

The young lad who falls for Marilyn is also less than convincing in that crucial role.

The DVD extra, for myself, was far more fascinating intersplicing actual clips from 1957 when the movie (The Prince And The Pauper) around which this movie is based was being filmed.",1351296000,,734,4.771653543307087

Well, I am happy to say I was wrong on both accounts. Although based on the book of the same name by Colin Clark, I chose to overlook whether I believed the story to be factual or not and just based my judgement on the film itself.
The casting was spot on as Kenneth Branagh once again gives an amazing performance in his portrayal of Sir Lawrence Olivier. Michelle Williams more than impressed me in her portrayal of one of my favorite Hollywood icons and her Oscar nomination was well deserved.

Even The supporting cast of Judi Dench, Eddie Redmayne , Julia Ormand and Emma Watson were all very well-casted.

Watson does a wonderful job in her underused role.

This was a young man who actually only knew her briefly and spent one week of his life with her. However, the innocence of both this man and Marilyn were so touching and the moments they shared so tender, that I couldn't help falling in love with her story all over again. Michelle Williams was brilliant, capturing the mannerisms and dialect of Marilyn so well, I forgot at times that it wasn't actually Marilyn. The plot is basically a snapshot of a moment in the late movie star's life, when she was filming The Prince and The Showgirl with Olivier in England. The relationship between Marilyn and her then newlywed husband, the late playwright, Arthur Miller, was only touched on, as it wasn't the focal point. As far as Sir Laurence, her strained relationship with the late great English actor and director was highlighted, as was his philandering and troubled marriage to the late Vivien Leigh. Marilyn's obvious emotional problems and insecurities give the viewer a sense of foreboding as to further troubles to come toward the end of her life.

4621970,5,B0059XTUB8,"There is no doubt that Michelle Williams is a very talented actress.  In this movie, she shines; she is the perfect pick to play Marilyn Monroe.  From start to finish, her performance is strong and convincing.  Story is told from point of view of a young man Colin, from privileged upper class (he is British) who wants to make his own way in the movie business.  He is only 23 and is well connected; his godfather is royal librarian and his family personally knows sir Laurence Olivier, one of the greatest clasically trained actors of his time.

As Olivier decides to make a movie in which he will start with Marylin Monroe, young Colin gets determiend to become part of the director's team.  He uses his connections to find out names of the people who can arrange Marilyn's stay in England by finding her a quiet and secluded house rental dutring the week of her filming with Olivier.  When Marilyn finally arrives, with her husband of three weeks, writer Arthur Miller, everyone is smitten.  Her presence is magnetic, but her insecurities, her tardiness and blind devotion to her acting coach is driving everyone mad. When Miller leaves her during filming to visit his family, Marilyn strikes friendship with young Colin.  He seems to be the only one to give her a peak to what it is to live ordinary life, without any pressures of Hollywood, fame and relentless admirers, journalists and photographers.  During the week that they are together, Colin gives Marilyn kind of friendship she deparately craves. Colin falls in love with Marilyn and pays the price in the process; his brief relationship with costume girl from the crew falters, Marilyn returns to her husband and Hollywood and Colin's unique experience helps him establish himself as a professional, capable of joining ""the circus"" as Laurence Olivier tells him at the end.

This is extraordinary film because it gives a glimpse of Marylin from a perspective of a young man, still uncorrupted and innocent.  Like most life changing events, for Colin this moment in his life is a kind of experience he will never be able to shake off.  But it is also his way of making his own way in the real world of which he knows so little about...This movie is based on a memoir, Colin Clark wrote in 1990s about the experience from 1956.",1349049600,,2290,4.738035264483627

4622040,4,B0059XTUB8,"Although I have enjoyed my share of Marilyn Monroe movies, I've never been obsessed with her or made it my business to read biographical info on her.  I certainly know she died young, was married to DiMaggio & Miller, etc.  Thus, I cannot speak even remotely to the truthfulness of MY WEEK WITH MARILYN.  I can say, however, that it was an interesting film that engaged my interest throughout, and that it features an eye-opening performance from Michelle Williams.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN covers the time period when Marilyn came over to England to star in Laurence Olivier's PRINCE AND THE SHOWGIRL.  Olivier (Kenneth Branagh) was directing and co-starring, and felt that Monroe would guarantee a big hit.  For me, as someone who worked for YEARS in theater, I was in many ways most interested in seeing the clash of acting styles between Monroe & Olivier.  Monroe was trying to be a method actor (and she travelled with her own acting coach)...which sometimes seems like a crutch she is using when she's feeling insecure.  Olivier was more old-school, where acting was more about craft and instinct and timing and delivery.  When the two great movie stars come together, sparks fly.  But they aren't the sparks that create movie magic...they create friction and frustration.  I enjoyed watching all the British actors struggling to deal with Monroe's ""method"" of acting.  (Best of the bunch was watching Judi Dench, doing all she could to help Marilyn...she gives a delightful performance in a tiny role.)

The movie is told from the point of view of Third Assistant Director Colin Clark (on whose memoir the film is based).  Clark is a young man, new to the film business, who essentially is the gopher for Olivier and everyone else involved in the film.  He forges an unlikely friendship with Monroe, who briefly comes to trust him more than anyone else around.  This alliance lasts about a week (hence the title), where Colin is practically living with Monroe, even sleeping in her bed to offer comfort.  There are broad hints that some of Monroe's erratic behavior is due to drugs, but for the most part, the film portrays her as very insecure and lonely and misunderstood.  While the film doesn't shy away from the ugly aspects of her life, it is safe to say they are left unexplored.

The film is a fairly loving tribute to Monroe.  While she can be difficult, she is always shown fairly sympathetically.  Actually, almost everyone in the film is sympathetic.  Olivier occasionally blusters and acts out...but honestly, we can understand his frustration.  Overall, he comes off well.  The movie FEELS evenhanded and humane...it's a nice mood.

Best of all is Michelle Williams.  She's done good work before, but much of it has felt SIMILAR.  She seems to play contemporary women grappling with some level of demons.  (BLUE VALENTINE, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN).  Her characters may have inner strength (MEEK'S CUTOFF, WENDY AND LUCY), but they aren't usually dynamic, charismatic, loud women.  In MY WEEK WITH MARILYN, we see a side of her that has not been much on display, and my estimation of her jumped up accordingly.  Her Marilyn is touching and grappling with demons, but she is also sexy and wildly charismatic.  When Williams portrays the ""public"" Marilyn, handling rabid fans or a crazy press conference...she acts so ""non-Michelle Williams-like"" that I was quite impressed.  Her many accolades were much deserved.  Branagh also does a great Olivier.  It's perhaps a bit more of an impression that a fully-realized performance...but he's charming and convincing and clearly having a ball with the role.  Others don't fare quite as well.  Emma Watson is bland (thanks to the script) as Colin's girlfriend; Dougray Scott doesn't get to do much as Arthur Miller and Julia Ormond is miscast as Olivier's wife, Vivien Leigh.

This is not a deeply revelatory film, but it is highly entertaining and the time flies by.  The art & costume direction is flawless, including the reconstructions of many scenes from Monroe films.  It's a feel-good film about a real life person who was nearly on the brink of self-destruction.  That's contradictory, I know...but that's how the film felt.  It is certainly worth a look.",1347235200,2,4217,4.957203994293866

4622086,3,B0059XTUB8,"Worth watching, but I agree with some others that the Monroe impersonation only works intermittently. There are some moments when the Marilyn mask becomes secondary to the performance and a vulnerable but winsome woman comes through. Interesting to see Olivier/Branagh reacting wide-eyed and in wonder at the film rushes, the script having him TELL us how luminous Monroe is on screen. Yes, Monroe was, but the Monroe/Williams in the rushes is much less so, excepting perhaps the little dance scene, which notably lacks a close-up. Otherwise decidedly not luminous.

I recommend to anyone with an interest in the theme that they see the far superior  Me & Orson Welles, directed by Richard Linklater. As in ""Marilyn,"" callow youth runs away to the ""circus,"" as Olivier/Branagh puts it (in this case the theater), meets a great star (the central performance by Christian McKay is brilliant), gets chewed up by the encounter, but receives a valuable lesson in adulthood. The Monroe film, while fun, is a much lesser achievement.",1345939200,,1026,5.137724550898204
4622087,4,B0059XTUB8,"Most people would say Marilyn Monroe is synonymous with sexuality, but for me it was definitely all about her ability to draw you in and suspend you in her special magic where all else seemed to dim and fade away.

The cinematography and costumes were wonderful transporting me to 1957 London including locations such as Saltwood Castle and Windsor Castle.  Many of the actors in the film did exude the same special Marilyn magic star quality including Eddie Redmayne.  Eddie Redmayne gave a fascinating performance in this movie speaking volumes with a mere expression and for me, he is the one who carries this movie depecting the week in which Monroe spent time being escorted around London by him.  Judi Dench also carried the movie by exuding the Marilyn special magic in her role as Dame Sybil Thorndike.  Julia Ormand and Emma Watson also shone and delivered the Marilyn magic to the viewer.  The American Film Institute in 1999 ranked Marilyn Monroe as the sixth greatest female star of all time.  While Williams does not demonstrate that quality of stardom or specialness and magic of Marilyn Monroe,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Week-With-Marilyn/dp/B0076NKNLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Week With Marilyn</a>&nbsp;did deliver transporting the viewer back into that special magic with the combined efforts of Redmayne, Dench, Ormand, Watson, costumes, cinematography, and  script.  By watching this one movie, one can taste again the specialness of that one star that shone so bright and was snuffed out too soon.

Says Clark of his week with Marilyn, ""here's what I remember most:  her embrace, her belief in me, and the joy she gave; that was her gift.  When I think of her now, I think of that time when a dream came true and my only talent was not to close my eyes.""",1345593600,,2667,5.504901960784314

I know films are personal and their interpretation subjective, but at this point I must confess that I could not care less for the negative remarks about the actress who played Marilyn or their cohorts.

It is an honest film, that shows the intimacy of a troubled, frequently intoxicated mega star. It is also sometimes moving if one understands what is really happening with the characters.

4622089,4,B0059XTUB8,"This movie has been sitting on my shelf for longer than it should have been before I finally picked it up one night and put it into the DVD player.

I think we all pretty much know the premise of the movie now, right? Marilyn, played by Michelle Williams, goes to make a movie with Laurence Olivier in England. Colin Clark, a man in his early twenties from a rich family, dreams of being in the movie-making business and lands a job working with Laurence Olivier. As the movie films, Marilyn is unsure of herself as she tries to be a real actress and has the potential to ruin the film. As Colin spends time with Marilyn, he sees glimpses of the real girl behind the blonde bombshell veneer and that life is not perfect for her, the story of which, is well-known.

I think that Michelle did a wonderful job as Marilyn. You can tell that she must have studied hours and hours of film to get Marilyn's mannerisms and speech patterns right. I sometimes forgot that I was watching an actress playing Marilyn Monroe. Judi Dench was perfect, as usual, as Dame Sybil Thorndyke. I liked that they gave a good supporter of Marilyn besides Colin. I kind of wish that she was in the film more. Kenneth Branagh was quite amazing as Kenneth Branagh. He did so well in the role. On the other hand, I completely disagree with the choice of Julia Ormond as Vivien Leigh. As a huge fan of Ms. Leigh's, I couldn't really see any facial resemblance or voice resemblance between the two. There had to have been a better actress to play that role. That part was rather distracting and took me out of the film slightly.

I really liked the movie. It was beautifully filmed as well. I'd definitely recommed having it on your list of movies to see.",1344988800,,1724,4.415094339622642

I wouldn't watch it more than the once, but like I said it wasn't outright terrible. Maybe someone who really really loved Marilyn would find it more a fascinating character study.",1344816000,,591,4.584905660377358
4622161,4,B0059XTUB8,"While I really liked this film, there are a couple of glaring issues.  1.  This movie took too much of a sympathetic perspective of Marilyn Monroe.  2.  Michelle Williams is a very good actress - borderline excellent - which makes her too good to play Marilyn.  Ms. Monroe never bothered to learn her craft as an actress (watch ""Seven Year Itch"" if you disagree with me, or even ""Some Like it Hot"" where she was strictly a prop to the far superior Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis) so Ms. Williams had to downgrade her skills here, which was obviously difficult for her to do.

Before you get too excited about negative comments about Ms. Monroe, I have read a book or two about her so I know most of the basics.  As someone in this film says to the third-string director at one point, ""Stay away my boy.  Otherwise, you will get burned,"" when talking about any relationship with Monroe.  Indeed.  From what I have read this was a common refrain; many men were left in her wake, to risk mixing metaphors.

It's too bad Marilyn died so young, but not for the reasons that most people believe.  Time is unkind to everyone, and it would have been particularly unkind to her.  People would have gotten the opportunity to see the real Marilyn Monroe, and I don't believe that they would have necessarily liked what they saw.  The rose-colored glasses surely would have fallen off.

Naturally, a terrific performance here by Ms. Williams, nonetheless.  And a very good movie in the sense that it wasn't afraid to have most of the movie set around Ms. Monroe's work, and those that strongly disliked here.  A fairly strong recommendation here by me.",1344816000,,1637,4.589655172413793
4622162,3,B0059XTUB8,"I remember when this film was released.  All the major complaints filtering in where that the film felt too much like a `made for television' movie and not a theatrical picture.  I can't say that that isn't the case, because this film just doesn't really feel like a movie.  That doesn't mean that this film isn't entertaining, because it is (and a large part of that is thanks to Kenneth Branagh), but at the end of the day it also feels a tad empty and it certainly doesn't say a whole lot about any of the figures depicted, Monroe included.  It tries to break into the fragile creature that flirted with the world and hid her pain with a mask of sensuality, but it doesn't quite succeed.  Instead it merely serves as a series of sequences that allow the actors to deliver fun dialog and recreate moments from 1957's `The Prince and the Showgirl'.

`My Week With Marilyn' centers on a young man named Colin who desperately wants to break into the movies.  He gets his chance after a chance meeting with Laurence Olivier and a little determination lands him the third directors assistant position on the production of `The Prince and the Showgirl'.  Through non-judgmental eyes he watches Marilyn and Olivier clash over acting styles, and he watches the world fall apart under the spell of greatness; Monroe.

Michelle Williams tried to snag an Oscar for her portrayal of Monroe, and she probably came closer than some think.  Mimicry is something the Academy salivates over, and Williams surpasses expectations with her layered portrayal of the complicated movie star.  She doesn't exactly mirror her in the way that Streep mirrored Thatcher (which is probably why Streep won the Oscar, and not Williams) but she infuses the common perception of her with something special.  It's just a shame that the film doesn't give her enough substance.  It pretends to, and from outward appearance it may, but when one digs a little deeper there isn't much here.  As special as Williams is, it really is Branagh who steals the show.  He nails Olivier's frantic obsession with Monroe and his jilted perception of his own talents and future.  He furrows his brow and clenches his teeth and ann-un-ci-ates with pitch perfect command of the character.

And so, we are left with a fun little film that gets some right and leaves a lot to be desired.  With the prospects of deeper insight, I'm saddened that this film didn't do more to make Monroe feel real and alive, outside of a spirited performance by the film's lead.  The ending feels tacked on, and the apparent impact that Monroe had on all involved feels lost on the audience because her antics always feel laced with mere fluff.  Maybe the film is just too short to produce any genuineness, and then again, maybe the script is just too concerned with other things.",1344816000,2,2809,4.7407407407407405
4622163,5,B0059XTUB8,"It's a great story, and it delivers some especially wonderful moments along with its insights into the real Marilyn Monroe. Her life as a famous icon had this unseen insecurity that really left Marilyn a ""candle in the wind"". But this movie finds the other side of that unpredictability - all the fun and the humor when hurricane Marilyn finally blows in to town on an old TWA aircraft. It reminded me of ""My Favorite Year,"" as a kind of love letter to a specific memory about one magical moment in time.

At first you're just rooting for 22-year-old Clark, who wants his first job in the motion picture industry. (His British parents don't approve.) He soon navigates his way onto Laurence Olivier's 1957 movie ""The Prince and the Showgirl,"" and as ""third assistant director"" he's basically just a personal assistant. He's eventually assigned some errands with Marilyn Monroe, who connects with him during emotional moments in her own life.

It's fun to watch the daily life on the set of a movie, which establishes the characters who will be affected when the legend arrives. Everyone wanted the favor of Marilyn Monroe, of course, but the movie shows that behind-the-scenes, she was deeply insecure about her performance in the film. There's scenes where the crew reacts as she continues to arrive late for the filming, along with a ""method acting"" coach who brings her own unwanted input for the director. The film is set just as Marilyn was starting that exhilarating transformation into a superstar, and she'd also just started her marriage to playwright Arthur Miller. (It's after a turbulent fight that she first turns to Clark...)

The character of Laurence Oliver hints that Marilyn knows exactly what she's doing, saying respectfully that you don't survive in Hollywood without being clever. There's a subplot which kind of gets lost, about how Olivier himself was hoping this Marilyn film would re-vitalize himself (to the dismay of his wife, Vivian Leigh). But I thought it was touching the way the script gives him a final scene when he's watching the finished footage of their film. It's like the script-writers inserted a special line of appreciation of the whole film industry, acknowledging this family of artists who magically leave behind this legacy of characters on the screen...

Towards the end, in a voice-over, an older Clark thanks Marilyn for the joy that she brought to the world. And I think that's the best thing about the movie - that while it depicts Marilyn honestly, with all the benefit of our modern hindsight, it also captures her at her very best. There's the giddy moments when she's the ultimate dream come to for a 22-year-old. (What if you could show up at your old high school with Marilyn Monroe on your arm?)

And there's the occasional line of tender advice from the chorus of older actors and other stunned onlookers onlookers around them. But it all builds to a moment, and a crossroads for Monroe herself. I thought Michelle Williams really brought the story to life, so I was glad that I finally watched this. It is a very good story, and the movie has some very entertaining scenes.",1344124800,,3134,4.850467289719626
4622164,2,B0059XTUB8,"My Week With Marilyn is all about Marilyn Monroe's appeal and stardom. The problem is the acting, script and direction is a B+. Michelle Williams is definitely beautiful, but she lacks that amazing charm and charisma that Marilyn possessed. Williams was better in the more melancholic, painful scenes, but it was frustrating, it could've been a much better character study.
Even if the film is a true story, it comes off as too much of a school boy fantasy, and the main character can hardly gain sympathy for playing the girl next door and then running off with the lead actress. The direction of the film told the story, but it lacked a memorable iconic moment. Lets get a few shots of Marilyn by herself, or at least some archival footage of the real Marilyn. Kenneth Branagh and Dame Judi Dench were the scene stealers for me, and Julia Ormond was lovely as Vivian Leigh. The movie left me wanting to see the actors actual films, like Streecar named Desire (Leigh), The Seven Year Itch (Monroe) and Hamlet (Olivier).",1344038400,6,1020,4.70391061452514

4622170,2,B0059XTUB8,"This is a story about a week a young, English man's encounter with Marilyn Monroe while she was working on a movie. The cast is full of very famous people and relies on the viewer's ability to believe that the people on the screen are who they say they are. You can't just say, ""Hey, Marilyn"" or ""Hey, Vivienne"" and expect us to go along. They are too well known. I found myself having to work too hard to keep track of the story because what was on the screen was too inexplicable. Vivienne Leigh and Olivier were supposed to have wild chemistry. This pair had none.

I have seen Monroe portrayed as a sex fiend, a drug addict/drunk, a lunatic, and a vulnerable girl. This movie attempts to show a bit of all of those sides to Monroe and fails. There are moments when Williams seems credible -like during her interactions with Arthur Miller. She comes across as needy and vulnerable, but what made Marilyn Marilyn was her sex appeal and incredible stage presence. I think that part was just wrong, wrong, wrong. As a performing artist, I just don't believe that can be faked. You can't watch someone turn it on and then emulate it. That is something that comes from within. If it were that easy, there would have been a million copy cats. There has only been one Marilyn Monroe.

My Week with Marilyn is sentimental, historical, and set in largely pretty and effective settings. It's even an interesting story, but it's not enough to make it good when the central focus of the story is just so wrong.",1341187200,2,1501,4.4945054945054945
4622191,4,B0059XTUB8,"Much better than what I'd expected, this film isn't just about Marilyn. It is about melancholy, longing and that grand divide between what calls us and what is in our best interest.",1340841600,,181,4.6875
4622192,3,B0059XTUB8,"I've seen most of Marilyn's movies and think she was underrated as an actress during her lifetime, possibly due to her reputation for being difficult.  She's almost revered now, not just as a sex symbol but as a fine comedic and dramatic actress.  Bus Stop, Some Like It Hot, Niagara, even The Misfits -- they all show her range and power and most of all, her presence.  This is where My Week With Marilyn falls down.  Michelle Williams does a fine job imagining Marilyn, but it's impossible for any actress to convey Marilyn's presence.  From a distance, I could almost believe I was watching Marilyn.  Up close, something was missing.  But I can't fault Williams -- nobody could have done it better.  The question is whether it should have been attempted at all.  We didn't learn anything about Marilyn that we didn't already know.

I enjoyed the movie mostly for the behind the scenes look at filming The Prince and the Showgirl, and the best parts of that were when Judi Dench as Dame Sybil Thorndyke took up for Marilyn, defended her, tried to help build her confidence.  I'd like to know if Thorndyke really thought MM was a ""great actress"" -- I'm skeptical about that.

I thought the movie also did a good job showing the effect on Marilyn of the public's adulation, being mobbed wherever she went, sometimes seeming to enjoy it, even seek it out, but at other times wanting to hide. The characterization left me with the impression that Marilyn recognized that people adored her because she was Marilyn Monroe, and not because of who she really was.  The thing is, did she even know who she was?  We'll probably never know.

Like other reviewers here, it was hard to buy into Colin's story of their relationship, but since I have no evidence to the contrary, I'm not going to call him a liar.",1340755200,2,1800,4.616352201257862
4622193,5,B0059XTUB8,"This is a highly interesting film well worth viewing, whether a fan of Marilyn Monroe or not, and well timed since August will mark the 50th anniversary of her death. Amazing that Marilyn still generates so much interest and has as big a mystique and charisma as ever.

This film takes place in 1956, when Marilyn traveled to England to film The Prince and the Showgirl with Laurence Olivier. Michelle Williams captures the essence of Marilyn brilliantly. Ms. Williams deservedly won a Golden Globe award and was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar. Marilyn is difficult, temperamental, neurotic, but undeniably dazzling and talented. Kenneth Branagh is perfect as Olivier and was also Oscar nominated. The friction Olivier experiences with Marilyn and with her acting coach/mentor, Paula Strasberg, is well portrayed.

The special features go behind the scenes and are fascinating. Highly recommended DVD and very entertaining.",1340755200,,927,5.342465753424658
4622194,3,B0059XTUB8,"The movie was okay, kind of dull at times, essentially nothing really happens. I think Michelle Williams did a pretty good portrayal of Marilyn Monroe, afterall I think it would be difficult to completely capture the screen presence and charisma that Marilyn had. There was something missing though...

I am rather skeptical that this week happened at all though, it sounds like a rather fanciful account from a young man. I'm not sure why Marilyn Monroe would have any interest in a third assistant director when she was just married 3 weeks, was pregnant, and had a constant retinue of people around her.

This is an account of a ""previously unknown chapter of Marilyn's life""....but maybe it's unknown because it didn't happen? I have read though that she was known to be difficult to work with, was frequently late, and heavily dependent on Paula Strausberg - and that is depicted in the movie.

I do not think Laurence Olivier and Vivian Leigh were portrayed well or even realistically in this movie, the casting was really off on them!",1340668800,,1041,4.837078651685394

4622196,4,B0059XTUB8,"When I first read that Michelle Williams was going to play Marilyn Monroe in the film adaptation of Colin Clark's story of an encounter with the legendary star, I was taken aback, as I doubted Ms Williams could carry it off. Was I wrong! Although there is little physical similarity to Marilyn Monroe, Ms Williams gives us a performance that captures the charm and the insecurities of the film icon. In addition, we are treated to her delightful interpretations of Marilyn singing ""Heatwave"" and ""That Old Black Magic.""

The movie is based Clark's story of the filming of ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" In London. Kenneth Branagh gives an entertaining performance as Sir Laurence Olivier, driven more than slightly batty by Marilyn's lateness, her insecurity about her ability as an actress (reinforced by Olivier shouting at her just to be sexy, as wasn't that what she did), and her neediness just a few weeks into her marriage to playwrite Arthur Miller. Clark, played by Eddie Redmayne, is the third assistant director who befriends Marilyn and with whom he has a friendship even though he must defy the powers that be in order to do so.

Redmayne is perfect as the young (23 year old) aspiring director, whose prominent and intellectually oriented family seems to find his ambitions childish. His infatuation with Marilyn is obvious to all, even though he insists it is primarily professional. Dominic Cooper and Julia Ormand are mostly wasted as Arthur Miller and Vivian Leigh, while Dame Judi Dench gives her usual entertaining performance in a minor role. Emma Watson plays Redmanyne's love interest among the production staff, a relationship that seems doomed from the start due to the English class differences between their respective families. For those of us who love books about movies and movies about movies this is just about perfect. Ms Williams playing the actress being herself with Colin but then ""becoming Marilyn"" when a group of university students appear suddenly was absolutely brilliant. She certainly deserved her Academy Award nomination as Best Actress for this performance. Altogether an enjoyable, entertaining, and thought-provoking film.",1339891200,3,2170,5.17948717948718

The tale is based on the memoirs of Colin Clark who served as a third assistant director in the making of a film (""The Prince and the Showgirl"") between Monroe (Michelle Williams) and an aging Sir Laurence Olivier (Kenneth Branagh). The focus compares and contrasts the the dazzling sensuality of Marilyn Monroe with her troubling lifestyle (ominous insecurities, prescription drug usage, people using her for her talent). Also starring Judi Dench, Emma Watson, Julia Ormond and Derek Jacobi.

This was a modest film budget put together in England. The budget for this small piece was $10M and it made a bit over $32M at the Box Office. Williams was nominated by the Academy Awards for Best Actress.

4622232,5,B0059XTUB8,"I remember when I was in Hollywood a few years ago and was on the Walk of Fame.  Out of all of the stars, the one that I saw the most people taking pictures of and literally laying next to on the (dirty) street was Marilyn Monroe.  It was actually quite astonishing that after all of these years Marilyn Monroe still captures the psyche of people.  She is the quintessential icon of classic Hollywood and the epitome of a timeless sex symbol.  At times I feel that the idea and persona of Marilyn Monroe is actually more alluring than her movies.

When I watched ""My Week with Marilyn"" I wasn't sure what to expect.  I knew it was critically acclaimed and Michelle Williams was nominated for an Academy Award.  However, in this day and age (at least to me) accolades and praise from the critics do not really hold a lot of water.

I have to say that this movie is really a breathe of fresh air.  It is different from a lot of the same cookie cutter movies coming out today.  The film is based on the memoir(s) by Colin Clark about his personal experience with Marilyn Monroe while she filmed ""The Prince & the Showgirl"" in London.  During the production of this film Clark and Monroe developed a kinship and a semi-romantic relationship...at least according to Clark's accounts.  In addition, the movie also displays the production and grapples of filming ""The Prince & the Showgirl"" and at about 98 minutes not a moment is wasted.

I found the acting in this movie to be superb.  Michelle Williams really did an amazing job in her portrayal of Monroe; right down to mannerisms, delivery of dialogue and appearance.  I must be honest; there were some scenes where Michelle Williams was a dead ringer (the cover of the DVD for instance) for Marilyn Monroe and other scenes where she looked nothing like her.  I realize this might be nitpicking, but I feel it should be noted.  Regardless, this takes nothing away from Williams' performance.  Actually, I have more respect for her as an actress after this movie; she even sang all of the songs. Kenneth Branagh was amazing (as always) as Laurence Olivier and Eddie Redmayne as Colin Clark was also wonderful.  I have a hard time believing this is the same Redmayne from the film ""Black Death""!  Also look for good supporting roles from Judi Dench, Julia Ormond and Emma Watson.

There have been so many ""stories"" about Marilyn Monroe that don't paint her in a positive light, this movie manages to show a very multi-leveled depiction of her.  The movie itself plays out like a comedy-drama and is able to be both innocent and melancholy.  The film does a wonderful job of detaining 1956 and showing an era that is long gone.  The score is also beautiful and haunting.

I have heard some people condemned Clark's accounts with Monroe finding it dubious, stating that it was fabricated and fluffed up.  I don't know if that is true or not, I wasn't there.  Regardless truth or embellished, it is a great story and for that fact a wonderful movie.  I can definitely see myself revisiting this motion picture in the future.  I recommend this movie to anyone who truly enjoys the ""art of cinema"".",1339027200,5,3139,4.615523465703971
4622233,4,B0059XTUB8,"Michelle Williams does a fantastic job portraying the two sides of Marilyn.  Eddie Redmayne, in his portrayal of Colin Clark, is remarkably eloquent!  The scene between Williams and Redmayne, Marilyn at 31 and Clark at 23, at the all boys private high-school Clark graduated from in England, is so magical that you really must see it!  Marilyn, on a day-break from the shooting schedule, at the high-school, when confronted by a group of students, turns to Clark and says, ""Should I become that other girl?""  Words don't give this scene justice.  A transfixing moment that can only be seen and heard to truly comprehend the depth of enlightenment this moment had to offer yours truly.  The entire movie is a highly refined tragedy, which may make watching it a bit of a drag.

Eddie Redmayne did a beaut job as the besotted young man by Marilyn's damsel in distress performance. To be fair he wasn't the only person, male and female, to be besotted by Monroe's girlish innocence and sensual aloofness.

The audience can only feel empathy towards Williams enchanting impression of Marilyn as she struggles with her insecurities of self-acceptance and desire to be loved. It is still amazing that the ""most loved woman in the world"" at the time found it so difficult to love herself.

Who ever understood Marilyn Monroe?  She became a movie ""goddess"" but was unhappy in life and never felt accepted for herself.  My Week With Marlyn explores the most famous woman of the mid 20th century, her feelings and her craft.

The movie highlights one week during the filming of ""The Prince and the Showgirl,"" staring Sir Laurence Olivier, Marilyn Monroe, and Dame Sybil Thorndike.  The movie  was to be Sir Laurence's film triumph and Marilyn debut as a serious actress.  The methods of Olivier and Monroe clashed, so the set was destined to be tense.

""My Week"" is essentially a love story.  Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne) a young assistant new to films is smitten with Marilyn.  Marilyn struggles with psychological problems from her youth.  Eddie reaches out to Marlyn and tries to comfort her and listen to her fits of fear stimulated by a low self image.  They become friends.

To me the best part of this movie is the acting.  Michelle Williams is outstanding as Marilyn.  Williams captures the internal struggles Monroe lived.  Williams is a believable Monroe who portrays her loneliness, frustration and insecurities.  She shows Marilyn's escapism to a fun self in an attempt to combat her emotions.  Somehow Williams senses that Marilyn Monroe is simply a character that Norma Jeane Mortensen Baker (Marilyn's birth name) sees as a role she projects to the public.

Redmayne portrays well  Colin Clark, the love struck boy who somehow is blessed with being able to understand Marilyn and provide her the friend she needs.  Judi Dench is brilliant as Dame Sybil Thorndike, and Emma Watson is delightful as Lucy.

I enjoyed this film.  I recommend My Week with Marlyn for a nice evenings  entertainment.",1337904000,,1718,4.947368421052632
4622238,4,B0059XTUB8,"Thirty years old and fresh on her third marriage, Marilyn is not only an acclaimed actress but the most desired woman in the world-- her appearance in a small town in England, to film ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" with Sir Laurence Olivier, threatens to produce riots and heart attacks among young and old alike.  Yet Marilyn does not want to be worshiped, only loved and respected, and both seem beyond her reach.  Her Lindsay Lohan-esque antics aggravate her colleagues, and her new husband-- playwright Arthur Miller-- condescends to her and secretly wishes he had never married Marilyn.  Enter directing assistant Colin Clark, who looks about 15 and drinks in Marilyn's curves as voraciously as her words.  He needs Marilyn as much as she needs him.

Eddie Redmayne's Colin, though undeniably pretty, did not really communicate anything to me.  Michelle Williams, on the other hand, is a beautifully expressive actress who brings to life the frightened girl beneath Marilyn's carefree facade of dancing, laughing and flirting, making her fears of ending up mad and alone-- like Marilyn's schizophrenic mother--seem real. People sometimes have a funny idea that beauty is insurance against being abandoned or betrayed by those you love.  As this movie shows, sometimes the opposite is true.

Of course, one wonders how much access young Colin Clark had to Marilyn at the time. The book came out long after the incident presumably took place, and apparently at the urging of publishers. But, my biggest gripe was with the characterizations. Branagh makes Olivier into a pompous old windbag. God knows who Julia Ormand was trying to be, certainly not Vivian Leigh. Michelle Williams provides a cuddly version of Marilyn with out much body or soul.

The other actors are also great: Kenneth Branagh is fabulous, as usual, as Laurence Olivier--and Judi Dench, Emma Watson, Dougray Scott, and Julia Ormond also turn in great performances. Eddie Redmayne did a fine job as Colin Clark, the film assistant whose relationship with Marilyn is the basis for the film; however, the character of Colin wasn't very likable (which is odd, considering the film is based on Clark's memoirs), and that diminished my enjoyment of the film.

The special features are rather lean--a commentary track and a 19-minute ""making of"" documentary. However, the documentary is definitely worth watching, as it includes interviews with the actors and director and gives a behind-the-scenes look at the production.",1337126400,,1005,5.320754716981132

Colin is a bright eyed, and hard working guy trying to make it in the film industry and he shows through determination, that he can do what is necessary to get the job done.

But what happens, which seems to be common in Marilyn's life, is that she connects with Colin and uses him to get through this tumultuous time. He is her soft place to land when everyone around her is scrambling to either holler at her lack of professionalism or kiss her feet as the greatest weak psyched actress around.

It is not a huge, fast paced movie but gives us a glimpse at what a troubled young woman she was, brilliantly portrayed by Michelle Williams. The only thing that bothered me throughout the movie was that Kenneth Branagh didn't make me think of Sir Laurence Olivier at all.",1337126400,,1023,4.4361702127659575

4622294,4,B0059XTUB8,"Good performances throughout and interesting glimpse into the frailty of Marilyn Monroe along with her self-destructive behaviors. Particularly her equating attention of any kind with genuine love, and the belief that self-acceptance was to be found thru the eyes of others. Michelle Williams was excellent as Marilyn `off screen', but I just didn't buy her as `on screen Marilyn'.",1336780800,,381,5.47457627118644
4622295,1,B0059XTUB8,"I guess I kept hoping that it would redeem itself somewhere. That did not happen.

Michelle Williams plays Marilyn Monroe. Unfortunately, Michelle Wililams is no Marilyn Monroe, at all. She does not have the face, body or voice. She is cute. Not beautiful. She just didn't have it. It was almost painful to watch. And there was something weird she did with her eyes, when she was listening to Colin talk - as if she was thinking and having some revelation inside her head - possible, but didn't come across as good acting. Just strange.

I also didn't believe that Monroe would become dependent on Colin Clark and they would have this wonderful day together, skinny-dipping and visiting Windsor Castle and all. When did she stop to take her pills?

Everyone around her told Colin to leave her alone or he would get hurt. He was warned that he would be used. Of course he did not care, what young man would? But I don't think this relationship happened, except in his fantasies.

Olivier seemed most on target that he could see through Monroe. She knew exactly what she was doing, being late, manipulating people, pretending to be helpless and stupid and not know her lines. And that she did not need rescuing. He was right about all that. But there was something strange about Kenneth Branagh playing Laurence Olivier. He wasn't right for the part either. I think his acting and speech were good, but physically, there was something disturbing. He didn't look like him, but it wasn't just that - his cheeks were too fat, his hair too slick? Just a bit off kilter there.

To sum up this film, sorry I wasted my time. In my defense for renting it from the library, I thought it was going to be about her time spent with Jim Haspiel.",1336521600,12,1730,4.567741935483871

We enjoyed the movie.  The fact that Marilyn had self-esteem problems has been documented in books and was presented in this movie visibly.  Of course Laurence Olivier could likely make anyone have self doubts.  At least in this movie he comes across as a first class horse's butt.  The movie centers around the filming of a movie starring Marilyn and Laurence that was finally named ""the Prince and the Show Girl"" although I don't believe that title was ever mentioned in this movie.  The primary action however was not the filming of the movie. It was about the problems trying to get Marilyn to participate in the filming as a result of Laurence's belligerent attitude and about the time she spent with the assistant to the assistant director, an Englishman, who was assigned to take care of her needs during her stay in England.  If you are looking for a romantic episode in this arrangement, you will be disappointed.  However you do get to see a ""skinny dipping"" episode when Marilyn decides to cool off during a walk and her host has to follow suite.  All-in-all not a great movie but a good one.",1335398400,,1331,5.274881516587678
4622326,4,B0059XTUB8,"""My Week with  Marilyn"" follows the behind-the-scenes social intrigues of the cast and crew of ""The Prince and the Showgirl"", Laurence Olivier's attempt at light comedy on the silver screen and Marilyn Monroe's attempt to work with serious folks, in 1956. The film's troubled production, which was apparently far more engaging than the movie itself, was recorded for posterity by Colin Clark, whose first job in the film industry was third assistant director on that film, essentially a factotum and assistant to Laurence Olivier. Clark was 23 years old at the time and enamored of Marilyn Monroe. He published a diary of his time on the set as ""The Prince, the Showgirl, and Me"" in 1995, followed by a memoir from which this film takes its name in 2000.

Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne) is from an old and monied English family that doesn't think much of his aspiration to a career in movies. But his persistence gets him a job with Laurence Olivier Productions, whose next film will be ""The Prince, the Showgirl, and Me"". Colin couldn't be happier at the prospect of meeting the glamorous, beautiful and very American Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams). The production is off to a rocky start, when Marilyn is late to the first read-through, and it's clear that she is more than a little nervous, insecure, and doped-up. Olivier (Kenneth Branagh) becomes frustrated with Monroe's personal problems and her ""method"" approach to acting. Meanwhile, Marilyn finds Colin a down to earth person to talk to in her time of crisis.

Laurence Olivier is intimidating and perhaps not as tolerant as he could have been of Marilyn's perpetual emotional turmoil, but I found him the most sympathetic character. He is bedeviled by Marilyn Monroe's dysfunction, which is creating a hellish working environment for him. But trying to compete with Marilyn's screen presence and sexuality leaves him in awe of her on one level.  He was a middle aged man seeking to renew and rediscover his strengths through a beautiful younger woman, but seeing himself on screen with her only made him feel old. And working with her nearly drove him mad. It's nice to see Kenneth Branagh playing a forceful character who is not always nice. I liked him in this role a lot.

Michelle Williams is perfectly competent as Marilyn Monroe: childlike, witty, dreadfully insecure, preyed upon, but manipulative and toxic to those whose emotions she toys with. Colin Clark was too green to understand that he could get hurt trying to be Marilyn's friend -and that no one, especially not a man, could really be her friend. But he was captivated by her, and she thought him innocent enough to be trusted. Colin Clark's character, while a reasonably good lens through which to see the others, is unfortunately the film's weakness. He is flat and doesn't have as much stake in how the production turns out as the other characters, which makes him less compelling. This is a star-packed cast that works nicely, but our guide, Colin, is the weak point.

The DVD (Weinstein 2012): Bonus features are a behind-the-scenes documentary and an audio commentary. ""The Untold Story of an American Icon"" (31 min) interviews director Simon Curtis and the cast about the film, the characters, and performances. Then it goes to Pinewood Studios, where filming for both Olivier and Monroe's film and this film took place, for a look behind the scenes. The audio commentary with director Simon Curtis is constant scene-by-scene commentary about story, characters, locations, and changes made to the book, which seem minor. Subtitles for the film are available in English SDH and Spanish.",1335398400,,3623,4.980165289256198

4622329,5,B0059XTUB8,"Having admired Marilyn since my boyhood (my Dad took me to see Bus Stop in a movie theater,) I'll confess, as I think most men of a certain age will, to having held a small soft spot in my heart for this gifted and wounded young woman... for my entire adult life.

I'm a fairly serious student of film. I work in the theatre business. In that light I can only say that I have never seen an actress so completely transform herself into another human being as Ms. Williams does in this film.

Whether one is a fan of Marilyn or not, she is in our collective DNA, an incomparable and central icon of our national culture to this day. We know her every expression, every intonation, every eyelash. For an actress to take on such a role must have been a daunting task.

Many actresses have played Marilyn over the years. Michelle Williams IS Marilyn. In this deeply moving film it's as though Marilyn has come back and inhabited Ms. Williams, and I choose that word very carefully.

You'll perhaps go into this film expecting a light hearted romp. You'll get much more than you bargained for.

One of the most astonishing performances by an actress that I've ever had the pleasure and the fully absorbed and riveted experience of watching.",1334966400,,1234,4.515695067264574
4622330,5,B0059XTUB8,"After watching the hit show Smash, I took an even higher interest in Marilyn Monroe. Michelle Williams is absolutely brilliant as Marilyn. She portrayed her bombshell beauty and bubbly personality that Marilyn Monroe had. The plot was very solid and other performances by the other supporting actors and actresses including Dougary Scott, Emma Watson and Judi Dench were brilliant as well. This film overall was absolutely amazing in every way. No one could have played Marilyn but Michelle Williams! Definitely worth a view for any Marilyn fan or any movie fan who wants to see an excellent film!",1334793600,,597,5.1020408163265305
4622350,4,B0059XTUB8,"Michelle Williams really made a splash with this role.  I am too young to remember Marilyn Monroe while she was alive but this movie was a wonderful sneak peak at a small moment in her life.

It was also nice to see Emma Watson in something else--it is just a small role but she is just as perky and fun as she was as Hermione Granger in Harry Potter.",1334793600,,351,4.072463768115942
4622351,5,B0059XTUB8,"In the Kinks song ""Celluloid Heroes"" Marilyn Monroe is described as being made of flesh and blood while expected to be made of steel.  ""My Week With Marilyn"" pretty much follows that philosophy.  It's not an all encompassing bio of Monroe but a snapshot of the actress at an important juncture in her life.  Set in England in the mid Fifties Monroe wants to eschew her sexpot image and be taken seriously as an actress by starring in Laurence Olivier's ""The Prince and the Showgirl"".  Sensitive to the demands of Sir Larry Marilyn forms a platonic bond with a third director named Colin Clark to get through the shoot.  Michelle Williams eerily channels Monroe that you are spellbound by her performance.  Though she is not as voluptuous as Monroe Williams captures the essence of the woman humanizing instead of idolizing her.  Kenneth Branagh effectively captures the vanity and tempestuousness of Olivier and still making him a sympathetic character.  Eddie Redmayne as Colin perfectly acts as a conduit to the movie star world.  Good supporting work is offered By Judi Dench as a grand dame of the theatre, Julia Ormond as Vivien Leigh, and Emma Watson in a grown-up role as a craftsperson on the set.  I'm not what you would call a Monroe afficienado but this film is a real winner.",1334793600,,1287,4.782805429864253
4622352,5,B0059XTUB8,"Excellent film! I really enjoyed the characterizations of the people and felt that she really caught the essense of Marilyn-the sadness, the sensuality and the innocence as well.",1334707200,,178,5.392857142857143
4622353,4,B0059XTUB8,"Based on the biographical book authored by Colin Clark (Eddie Raymayne), the story follows the week he spent with Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams), while she was filming ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" in London. Upon Colin's graduation from university, he embarks on an opportunity to work on Lawrence Olivier's (Kennth Branaugh) new film, whom he had met at a party and is a mutual acquaintance. After much prodding with Hugh Perceval and Colin's persistence to arrive at Perceval's office everyday until a job is opened, Olivier comes in and offers him the opportunity of a lifetime. Colin's first task is to find a private residence for Marilyn while she is in London. He has found the perfect home secluded from prying eyes which impresses the primary film crew. Now with the trust and his passion to prove himself, his next project will be even a more bigger challenge. He is chosen to keep Marilyn company for a week while her husband, Arthur Miller, has to jet off back to America.
During the film we see Marilyn's insecurities and child like behavior. She does not enjoy being alone and with her flirtatiousness she seduces Colin. He is warned from those who know her best that her infatuation with him will not last.
Michelle Williams' portrayal of Marilyn was right on especially in a scene showing her dancing on the set as Olivier and the film crew watches in awe. Eddie Raymayne played the naive Clark very well showing how touching his relationship with Marilyn was. Watching the chemistry between the two of them I could see that Clark was very protective of Marilyn and did not want her to be hurt. He truly cared for her while at the same time he was enthralled with her stardom and beauty.",1334707200,,1708,4.73489932885906

4622355,3,B0059XTUB8,This movie was not all that entertaining.  It was pretty sad and mostly showed the dark side of Marilyn's acting prowess.,1334707200,,121,4.761904761904762
4622356,4,B0059XTUB8,"I'm not a Marilyn fan, so I really wanted to see this movie because of the performances. Michelle Williams was great and brought different facets of Marilyn to life: vulnerability, playful childlike qualities, insecurity, and most notably to me, the moments where she has a true picture of herself...when she knows she's putting on the Marilyn image, and when she's apologizing for causing trouble.

I also loved Kenneth Brannaugh as Olivier, trying to recapture his youth, and I bet he loved being cast in that role.

I didn't find Eddie Redmayne's character, Colin, very endearing. (Yes, I know the real Colin was the author of the book.) I don't know if that's the way the part was written or the way Remayne played him, or just my perception. I look forward to seeing Remayne's portrayal of Marius in Les Miserables, though.

An aside: Emma Watson (of Harry Potter fame) has a small part in a horrific wig.

Bottom line: Definitely worth a viewing. These performances should not be missed.",1334534400,,993,4.8579881656804735

4622358,4,B0059XTUB8,"Classy and oh-so-proper in every way imaginable, ""My Week with Marilyn"" tells the story of Colin Clark, a self-described ""nobody"" who met Marilyn Monroe when she travelled to England to shoot ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" with Laurence Olivier. Newcomer Eddie Redmayne is all precocious charm as Colin, Kenneth Branagh chews the scenery as Larry, and Michelle Williams is again exquisite as Marilyn Monroe in a well-deserved Oscar-nominated performance. Judi Dench (as Dame Sybil Thorndike), Dominic Cooper, Emma Watson, and Julia Ormond (as Vivien Leigh) are all strong in supporting roles. The facts of this episode in the lives of Marilyn and Colin seem to be somewhat in dispute, but the ""what"" of this film appears to be far less important than the ""why""--Clark's story offers qualitative proof that, as we've heard time and again since Marilyn's premature and tragic death, she simply wanted to be loved and adored. The DVD includes a 20-minute behind-the-scenes/making-of short somewhat misleadingly entitled ""The Untold Story of an American Icon,"" which will nonetheless please film geeks (like me) who are interested in knowing about what goes on behind the camera as well as in front of it.",1334448000,,1200,5.22279792746114

I really think Michelle Williams captured the essence of Marilyn.  Of course, the real Marilyn's eyes spoke in such a way that no other actress can replicate.

I appreciated the story in this movie because it showed another side to Marilyn which helped to explain her pain.

On that note, see The Prince and The Showgirl.  It is, perhaps, one of my favorite MM movies!",1334448000,,520,4.548387096774194
4622390,3,B0059XTUB8,"The year is 1956, and the author Colin Clark, on whose book the movie is based on is trying to find a job, which he does on the the sets of a Laurence Olivier production, ` The Prince and the Showgirl' starring the most famous woman on the planet, the diva Marilyn Monroe. As expected, this dream pairing is a disaster, Olivier, trying to be a star and Marilyn trying to be an actor. Olivier, a genius is frustrated by the clumsy, neurotic and needy Marilyn along with conflicts between English stage acting and the new acting method followed by Marilyn, the Strasberg school. This is witnessed by the young Clark, who like the rest of the world sucumbs and vies of the charms of the drug dependant Monroe. He forms a friendship, love which lasts a week much to the displeasure of all of Monroe's handlers. Eventually, against the advice of everyone he falls in love with Marilyn and gets his heart broken, probably appreciating the lesson that  Laurence Olivier had learned: ""When it comes to women, you're never too old for humiliation.""
My week with Marilyn does not add to the legend of Monroe but is a showcase of her charm and genius on camera. As Clark tells her, ""Olivier is a great actor who wants to be a film star, and you're a film star who wants to be a great actor. This film won't help either of you"" The rest of the cast is great and perform well. Julia Ormond is perfect as Olivier's wife, who tries to cope with her own aging and loss of desirability. Kenneth Branagh is wonderful as the caustic, short tempered Olivier, who is both enamored and repulsed by Monroe. The moments when he realizes that he would never match Monroe's charisma on screen are indeed worth watching.
Michelle Williams is once again is fine form as she effortlessly matches the childlike innocence, vulnerability and nerves that was Monroe. Coming on the heels of Blue Valentine, another great performance.
Strictly for the fans of Monroe, three stars.",1334361600,,1945,4.621387283236994

4622392,5,B0059XTUB8,"When the making and casting of MY WEEK WITH MARILYN was announced there was much debate over the casting of Michelle Williams as Marilyn.  Marilyn Monroe who if you really study her film work was a very good actress is instead remembered moreso for the amazing aura about her.  She represented sexuality, sensuality, innocence, vulnerabilty all at the same time with an incomparable beauty and presence never seen since.  So people with this film were basing the casting on who looked more like Marilyn.  Luckily that is not how the producers of the film proceeded for it is the inner essence of Marilyn that made her who she was and a great actress is needed for that.  And today in film there is no greater actress than Michelle Williams.

They did a very good job in making her look like Marilyn but Williams went so much deeper and made her performance in no way a mere caricature.  She tapped into the pure soul and spirit of what was Marilyn.  The film takes place over a brief period when Marilyn was filming THE PRINCE AND THE SHOWGIRL.  This was a film when she was on husband # 3, Arthur Miller and sadly she didn't have much longer to live.  The film in and of itself is a pretty simple story.  The acting is very good all around but it plays as a slice of life piece except for the performance of Michelle Williams.  When she made her first appearance in the film I was comparing her to Marilyn but as the film went on I totally stopped and when the film was over it stayed on my mind for days.  I am a huge fan of both Marilyn and Michelle.  I knew the full back story of Marilyn at the time of the film and I found the performance of Williams haunted me long after viewing the film.

I really felt as if I had spent time with Marilyn Monroe.  Williams totally tapped into the insecurity, vulnerabilty, innocence and aura that was Marilyn.  She became her.  Repeat viewings of this film also help to see the greatness of her performance for Marilyn is such a strong presence that it may be understandably difficult to belive anyone portraying her.  There has never been a portrayal of Marilyn that captured her true purity and powerful presence as with Michelle Williams.  I cannot recommend this film enough.  Marilyn and Michelle got their deserved praise by this film.  View it and you will be enraptured by the essence of a legend.",1334275200,,2348,4.462441314553991
4622393,4,B0059XTUB8,"There've been other actress. Others who were better looking. More talented. Certainly there have been plenty more stable actresses. But there has never, in the history of film or TV, been any other actress who was more magnetic; who was more ""made"" for the medium than Marylin Monroe. Even in the earliest role I've seen her in, ""All About Eve"", she manages to capture and hold the audience like no one before or since. She really was the physical embodiment of the term ""star power"". She was also, according to most people who worked with her, somewhat challenging at times, and it's both aspects of her that come to play in this movie.

The movie stars Michelle Williams who channels Marylin expertly, playing her as she comes to England to film a movie with Lawrence Olivier, played by noted actor/director Kenneth Branagh. She's somewhat difficult to work with, which is like saying light moves a little speedily. Eventually she acquires/chooses a handler in the form of young third assistant director, Colin, played by Eddie Redmayne. The two bond and start to become close. Very close.

This was a really excellent movie. Williams embodied Marylin in all respects, right down to being so blinding on screen that her mere presence almost washed-out every other person in the frame. Everyone else does well with their roles, too, including Redmayne, who has a very daunting task playing against Williams.

The only complaint I can really level about the film is that the pacing felt a bit off. It dragged in places. Not severely so, but enough that I was checking the clock a few times.

That aside, this is a wonderful movie, and I highly recommend viewing it and reading Tony Curtis' book, ""The Making of Some Like it Hot,"" which also details much about Marylin and her life and personality.",1334102400,,1797,4.824675324675325
4622394,4,B0059XTUB8,"When Colin Clark, the wealthy son of a nobleman, was twenty-three, he worked as a third assistant director for Sir Laurence Olivier on the set of THE PRINCE AND THE SHOWGIRL. The movie co-starred Olivier as the Prince and Marilyn Monroe as the Showgirl. Olivier hired Monroe as his co-star because he was intending the movie to be the film that would ignite his career with American audiences. Monroe was hoping the experience of working with the illustrious Olivier in an English production would help her land more serious roles and be the stepping stone to becoming a seriously regarded actress. However, neither the experience nor the film itself turned out the way either had hoped. During the filming of THE PRINCE AND THE SHOWGIRL, Clark spent a week closely working with Monroe, becoming her escort and confidant.  MY WEEK WITH MARILYN is based off Clark's books (he wrote two different books about the experience).

The film begins with Clark (Eddie Redmayne) determined to get a job at Laurence Olivier's (Kenneth Branagh) film studio. He's eventually hired and goes to work as Olivier's third assistant director on the set of his newest production, THE PRINCE AND THE SHOWGIRL. Shortly after Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams) arrives in England with all her entourage, including drama coach Paula Strausberg (Zoe Wanamaker) and new husband Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott). There's lots of photo ops with Monroe and Olivier as the press eats up the meeting of American film royalty and British theatre royalty. The honeymoon is extremely short-lived and problems begin almost the instant filming begins as Monroe never on time and doesn't seem to understand the simplest direction. Olivier becomes outraged and the production becomes prolonged. During this time, Clark becomes acquainted with Monroe and she ends up choosing Clark to be her ""friend"" during this difficult period for her.

The acting in MY WEEK WITH MARILYN is superb. Williams delivers a stellar performance and is uncanny in her portrayal of Monroe. Likewise, Branagh's performance as Olivier is dead-on, too. I had never heard of Colin Clark before, but Redmayne gives a solid performance, too. Dame Judi Dench gives a wonderful performance as Dame Sybil Thorndike and Emma Watson, in her first post-Harry Potter role, is a delight on the screen as Lucy, the pre-Marilyn love interest of Clark.

I enjoyed MY WEEK WITH MARILYN, but I was somewhat disappointed by it, too. The movie features some fantastic acting and the story involves some fascinating, real-life characters. However, this movie isn't about Marilyn Monroe or Laurence Olivier. It's about Colin Clark. The film is told from his point of view. Therefore, though Marilyn Monroe and Laurence Olivier are featured, they aren't really what the story is about. The story is about this fascinating time in Clark's life and his thoughts and experiences while working on THE PRINCE AND THE SHOWGIRL. This one experience provides a lifetime of memories for him, but it's still just a week in his life and at the end of the movie he's not much different than he was at the start; he has a movie production under his belt, but he's still the son of a nobleman.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN is a movie worth watching if you enjoy great acting, are a fan of any of the actors involved in the production, or if you have an interest in any of the real-life people the movie is about. The pacing of the movie is a bit uneven and the focus of the story is Clark and not Monroe or Olivier. With that said, it's still rather interesting to see how this one particular person spent his week with Marilyn Monroe.",1333843200,,3627,4.910277324632952

4622397,4,B0059XTUB8,"Okay, so the film doesn't take place in Hollywood but it does tell the story of a young man's time with an icon who was unmistakably Hollywood: Ms. Marilyn Monroe. This is an interesting film that is elevated by the fact that it is not another paint-by-numbers biopic but a film focusing on a relatively unknown protagonist whose biggest achievement is writing the novel upon which this film is based. And rather than covering his lifetime (or Marilyn's, for that matter), it encapsulates only the brief period of time in which Marilyn flew to England to star in actor/director Sir Laurence Olivier's ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" (during the prime of her career). The film's aim is to let us inside the mind of one of the most compelling and mysterious figures in showbiz history. This is not easy but the movie is incredibly effective by doing just that. We learn just how talented she could be onscreen when she put her mind to it and how maddening it could be attempt to capture that talent on celluloid. We are keyed in to her many quirks and numerous problems in her personal life.

While Michelle Williams is never really able to disappear into the role of Monroe the way that Foxx captured Ray Charles or Blanchett nailed down Hepburn, asking her to do so would be a virtually impossible task. The performance she captures, however, was well worth the Oscar nomination she received. Kenneth Branaugh, playing his own idol Laurence Olivier, is absolutely brilliant & hilarious with many scene-stealing moments. Model-turned-actor Eddie Redmayne as our young protagonist is more than serviceable and this is the type of role that leads to bigger ones down the road. The authenticity of this film is what makes it what it is. And the fact that the quality of the film as a whole manages to exceed the performance of the extremely talented Williams speaks volumes about its script, direction and supporting cast. This one comes highly recommended.",1333497600,,1951,4.841317365269461
4622398,4,B0059XTUB8,"I have always enjoyed Marilyn Monroe's films for the sheer joy of living and humor they usually imparted, and with a few exceptions she mostly did romantic comedies--but I was totally unaware of the truly unhappy person beneath the seemingly care free fascade.  If we are to believe this biographical piece about Marilyn Monroe's stay in England while filming The Prince and the Showgirl with Lawrence Olivier she was a miserable person who was insecure, manipulative, and proped up solely by drugs and alcohol.  Michelle Williams gives a convincing performance of the air-headed Monroe, and Kenneth Branagh does a good job channeling Lawrence Olivier with his dark brooding, quoting Shakespear,  and festering mid-life crisis.  The movie tells the story of Colin Clark who was desperately trying to break into the film industry in spite of his upper class families' chargrin.  Marilyn sees him as an innocent young pup that she can rely on to try to burry her sorrows and chastly worship her without trying to take advantage of her sexually.  Olivier and the people surrounding Monroe making the movie are green with envy and as Marilyn (her husband Arthur Miller fleeing back to the USA unable to stand the men buzzing around his wife like honey bees and her incessant collapses from drug and alcohol use)calls upon Colin again and again to escape the misery of her existence.

Although a little before my time, I think the movie did a good job in portraying the 1950s.  I liked the film, felt the performances good, the only reason I'm giving the movie 4 stars instead of 5 is that I can't believe that Monroe was as stupid as she was depicted in the film.  I suspect that she was actually more calculating than portrayed here and that her passive aggressive behaviors that were only marginally hinted at in the movie, were actually probably much more pronounced in real life.  I don't believe anyone could have gone as far as she did in the film and modeling industry without knowing at least something about what they were doing.",1333411200,,2034,4.835734870317003
4622399,5,B0059XTUB8,"This story focuses on a young man (Eddie Redmayne) as Colin.  Through a series of coincidences, Colin becomes 3rd Assistant Director to The Prince and the Showgirl.  From there his youth and innocences continues to land him in unusual circumstances - namely the brief sparking friendship and romance to Marilyn Monroe.

Michelle Williams' performance as Marilyn Monroe is amazing, as many point out.  Williams' Monroe is spot on with her hushed breath voice and large batting eyelashes.  This particular Marilyn performance outlines her erradic behavoir and troubled life, but mostly focuses on her duel life style mentality - the child-like free spirit and the overwhelmed mega star blinded in the spotlight.  And in here, the viewers finally feel sympathy for the always changing Monroe.

But be assured that this movie is more than that.  The perephial performances are equally notched and carry the story.  We see Kenneth Branagh in wonderful performance as Laurence Olivier; his heavy-handed fist perfected film making is in stark contrast to Monroe's method.  Emma Watson's performance was surprisingly fresh and untethered to her Harry Potter past.

The story itself does focus on just a very narrow time period, giving the sense of urgency and fine detail that most biopics avoid.  This film is geunine and designed to give the viewer a sense of the author's original voyage.  In this film, we are Colin.  As the time passes, we both love and adore Marilyn only to have the week come to an abrupt end.  We feel like the days are passing too fast and the opportunity is not being appreciated enough.  In this narrow window of time, we not only see a believable Monroe but experience a believable encounter with such a legendary persona.

For those that enjoy the star, her films, biographies, or based on true stories - this is highly recommended.",1333324800,,1854,5.006535947712418
4622420,4,B0059XTUB8,"My Week with Marilyn features Academy Award nominated performances from Michelle Williams as Marilyn Monroe and Kenneth Branagh as Laurence Olivier.  The film is culled from the diaries of Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne) who worked as a third assistant director on the film The Prince & The Showgirl which is depicted in the movie. In the film, Ms. Monroe develops a trust and shares what may or may not have been an intimate relationship with Mr. Clark.  Ms. Williams may seem like an odd choice to play Marilyn since she really doesn't bear much resemblance to her other than having blonde hair, she does an amazing job capturing her spirit.  She has the whispery voice and the playful ingnue aspects of Ms. Monroe's personality down pat.  She also has the self-doubting, insecure persona that made Ms. Monroe such an enigma down as well.  Mr. Branagh is a commanding presence as Sir Laurence as he struggles to understand the method acting that Ms. Monroe is employing in finding her character.  Judi Dench plays actress Sybil Thorndike who becomes a buffer for and a champion of Ms. Monroe, Emma Watson has a small part as Lucy a wardrobe assistant with whom Colin takes out on a couple of dates and Julie Ormond plays Vivian Leigh, Sir Laurence's wife at the time.",1333324800,,1266,4.757990867579909
4622421,4,B0059XTUB8,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film, for which I had few expectations (I certainly enjoyed Marilyn Monroe in ""Some Like It Hot"" and ""All About Eve"", but I would never have called myself one of her fans). The photogenic Michelle Williams's seemingly unstudied portrayal of Marilyn certainly measures up to Academy standards, and British A-list actors Kenneth Brannagh, Judy Dench, and Michael Kitchen are top-drawer, as one might expect.  Zo Wanamaker is terrific as Paula Strasberg, whose sycophantic solution seems to be part of Marilyn's problem; and Emma Watson and Eddie Redmayne are very pleasant in their roles.

The spectacular English countryside, with the camera's visits to Eton and Windsor Castle, is well worth the price of the DVD. And Alexander Desplat's musical score, realised by Lang Lang's singular artistry at the piano, contributes to the tissue-thin ambience of the film's what-might-have-been scenario. For me, the only sour note is Julia Ormonde's portrayal of Vivien Leigh, whom I remember as being just as vulnerable, troubled, and lovely--even in her 40s--as Monroe was in her 30s. It seems to me that the director could have made a far more interesting film if he had compared and contrasted the two women and what their effect must have been on Olivier's psyche during the months of filming; but that possibility was overlooked in the casting of Ormond, whose characterisation of Olivier's unhappy wife is as hard as nails.

I found the most fascinating aspect of ""Marilyn"" to be in the recreation of the filming of ""The Prince and the Showgirl."" No, Michelle Williams is not the spit and image of Marilyn Monroe, but, for me she suggests her essence. Nor does Kenneth Brannagh resemble Lawrence Olivier, but his performance and hers certainly create a reasonable facsimile of what might have happened during the confrontation between Olivier, the immovable object, and Monroe, the irresistible force.

After all, who could hope to capture the exact reproduction of a cultural icon?",1333324800,2,2014,5.168711656441718

My mother was a waitress working for Saverin Restaurant in Pennsylvania Station, NYC. When not shooting Marilyn would come to the restaurant, and sit at my mothers' station for coffee every so often. When my mother came home after the first day of meeting Marilyn she told me something that I could never forget.

4622424,2,B0059XTUB8,"First off, I tip my hat to Michelle Williams.  She gave a valiant effort in trying to pull off an icon, but she only got it 50% right.  What she DID nail was Marilyn's emotions: vulnerablility, insecurity, brokeness, and need to be loved.  She painted a beautiful picture of wounded woman.  Where she missed the mark big-time was in not nailing the charisma, sex appeal, bombshell MOVIE STAR quality that men were captivated by and women wanted to attain.  Sorry, but Ms. Wiliams, as good of an actress as she is, simply lacks the glamour, punch and va-va-voom flair of an old Hollywood starlet.  This was like casting Anne Hathaway to play Elizabeth Taylor - just wouldn't work.  When playing someone famous, simply being a good actor won't do - you have to have at least *some* of the essence of the person being emulated.  Marilyn was lost in her internal drama a lot of the time, but she knew how turn it on and sell the showgirl image for the cameras.  Williams seemed to just be growing through the motions and looked painfully uncomfortable in any scene where Marilyn had to be ""on"".  You get the sense that she's a painfully shy/quiet person and couldn't turn up the personality enough notches to be believable as a 50's movie star.  This is where finding an actress who had a background in musical theater would have made a world of difference.  [No one knows how to ""sell it"" better than a Broadway actress!].

The poor casting continued with Julia Ormond [laughably] as Vivien Leigh.  Nothing, and I mean NOTHING about Ormond's looks and performance remotely resembled the icon america came to know and love as Scarlett O'Hara.

The only saving grace acting-wise is Kenneth Branaugh who nailed Sir Lawrence Oliver down to the very last crisply-accentuated syllable.  Well done!  Dougray Scott was pretty good as Arthur Miller, but [sadly] was not in many scenes.

Performances aside, the movie was slow, predictable, dull and felt inauthentic.",1333065600,36,1954,4.799401197604791
4622425,4,B0059XTUB8,"I have been watching Smash on TV and am very interested in the actors' efforts to capture the essence of Marilyn, which they mostly do by studying movies, imitating her mannerisms and vocal inflections.  I guess that works best for TV.  Marilyn as a person and as a character has been capturing our imagination for more than 60 years.

When Michelle Williams walks into the frame, she IS Marilyn.  She seems to have gone beyond the surface to understand the way Marilyn thinks and where she comes from.  Somewhat paradoxically, the result for me is that I stop thinking about whether Michelle Williams is like or unlike Marilyn.  I am instead totally invested in the Marilyn of MW's creation.  She responds instinctively and organically to the adulation of the crowd, to the blustering of Lawrence Olivier, to the besotted adoration of Colin Clark.  She is riveting to watch on her own merits and not because she is playing someone who was an attention magnet.

The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent.  Even with relatively little to do, Judi Dench, Emma Watson and Julia Ormond distinguish themselves. Kenneth Branagh's Olivier is a little over the top but it works.

The whole scenario for making the movie The Prince and the Showgirl is so intriguing.  Colin has a great line where he says that Marilyn is a movie star trying to become a serious actress, while Olivier is a serious actor trying to become a movie star.  That is really the turning point where Colin gains her confidence.

This is also a movie about the culture shock of MM going to England with her entourage, but with no one who truly loves her.  Obviously in a week Marilyn and Colin did not develop a deep and lasting love, but they were there for each other to get through the tough time together.

I don't think this is a great movie, but it is a very fine movie with a great performance by Michelle Williams.  I will definitely watch it again.",1333065600,,1923,4.625368731563422

Clark plays a go-between and confidant to Marilyn while attempting to date another stage hand, Lucy (Emma Watson). Lucy doesn't like to play second fiddle, even to Marilyn. Emma demonstrates she will be the one who will have an acting career after Potter.

The acting was superb. Michele Williams was able to capture the essence of Marilyn which made her into a worshiped idol. She demonstrates her frailty, her insecurity, and uninhibited sexuality. The film shows the difficulty of working with Marilyn and the joy she created once she ""nails it."" Very entertaining.

4622427,5,B0059XTUB8,"This is a lovely coming-of-age movie distinguished in two ways: first, it really happened.  Second, the woman with whom the young protagonist falls in love was none other than the silver screen goddess of the twentieth century, Marilyn Monroe.

A young Eton graduate of wealth and privilege, Colin Clark had the good fortune to wrangle an assignment as the third director on Laurence Olivier's film version of ""The Prince and the Showgirl,"" starring the fifty-year-old British master thespian and the thirty-year-old American sex bomb.

Olivier hoped the film would rejuvenate his career, and Monroe hoped that working under the direction of the legendary actor would lend her more credibility as an actress.

Neither ambition was fulfilled, although as the director notes in his commentary, both parties went on to score two of the greatest triumphs of their respective careers after this silly comedy, Olivier in the stage play ""The Entertainer"" and Monroe in the classic Billy Wilder farce ""Some Like It Hot.""

Now I remember seeing ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" many years ago, and I recall being struck at how effortlessly Monroe stole the picture lock, stock, and barrel from her infinitely more experienced co-star, who chewed up the scenery until it fell to the floor as the finest sawdust, all to little avail.

Fine performances dominate ""My Week with Marilyn,"" notably of course Michelle Williams as Monroe and Kenneth Branagh as Olivier.  One can see why Williams received an Oscar Best Actress nomination for this part, in recognition of her courage alone at stepping into the immortal screen icon's high heels.

Though Williams is a lovely woman, she still can't hold a candle to the luminous and magnetic Monroe.  Still, Williams does succeed in conveying the insecurity and vulnerability that lay right beneath Monroe's seductive facade.

Branagh in turn is clearly having great fun with the plummy role of Olivier, and his comic flourishes and bursts of pique at Monroe's antics are worth the price of the DVD by themselves.  Add in splendid supporting turns by Judi Dench, Julia Ormond, Zoe Wanamaker, and even young Emma Watson as Monroe's over-matched rival for Colin's attentions, and you have many magnificent performances to enjoy here.

I should also cite Eddie Redmayne as Colin, who manages to be both sensitive and sympathetic as the young man of privilege smitten with the vulnerable screen siren.

This DVD also includes a making-of featurette, as well as a director's commentary in which Simon Curtis emphasizes the meticulous attention to detail to which this production adhered in bringing this decades-old story to life.

In sum, fans of Monroe, Olivier, movie history, and coming-of-age stories will all find much to admire here.  Highly recommended.",1332979200,,2784,5.183035714285714

The film is directed by Simon Curtis, director of critically acclaimed the 1999 version of ""David Copperfield"" (starring young Daniel Radcliffe), and ""Cranford"" (with Steve Hudson).

""My Week with Marilyn"" succeeds more as an ode to the lost days of filmmaking than as a love romance or a coming-of-age story. With their different acting styles - Monroe constantly asking advice from Paula Strasberg (Zo Wanamaker), Lee Strasberg's wife, and Olivier, who obviously hates Strasberg's method acting - filming at Pinewood Studio turns out a nightmare. Williams and Branagh (very funny) effectively capture the insecurity and frustration of the stars, both of whom know something is terribly wrong, but fail to understand what it is.

After her husband Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott) goes back to America, Marilyn Monroe begins to find solace in spending time with Colin Clark, who has been dating a wardrobe assistant Lucy (Emma Watson). Though Michelle Williams is terrific as a charming and fragile star, characters of Eddie Redmayne's Colin and Emma Watson's Lucy seem underdeveloped.

4622429,3,B0059XTUB8,"Based on the recent memoirs of a filmmaker and producer, My Week With Marilyn follows a budding romance surrounding one of the most difficult film shoots of Marilyn Monroe's career.

Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne) has always wanted to be involved in movies, and he is determined enough to stick around the executive studios until he is hired as a 3rd assistant director to Sir Laurence Olivier (Kenneth Branagh). The world-renowned stage actor is preparing to direct and star in a movie opposite the beautiful Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams), but has little idea of what he is in for. Marilyn proves deeply insecure, temperamental, is frequently late to the sound stage, and fusses at the drop of a hat. Laurence is at the end of his rope, but Colin has more compassion for the American diva, who is newly married and in spite of her global success, deeply unhappy.

Circumstances throw them together and a friendship sparks that threatens Colin's attempts to woo one of the costume girls (Emma Watson). But as the shoot continues, he finds in Marilyn a young woman in a gilded cage, longing for freedom but without the courage to reach out and take it with both hands.

This film relies on impersonations of actors that everyone is familiar with -- from Laurence Olivier to his wife, Vivien Leigh (Julia Ormand). It seems strange to me then that none of the actors involved bear any resemblance to their cinematic counterparts, much less attempt in any way to impersonate them. I've heard glowing reviews of everyone involved but there was never a moment when I was convinced Branagh was Olivier, Ormand was Leigh, or Williams was Marilyn. None of them even bothered to alter their voice that much, which meant that element of the film was sorely missing. That aside, it is quite a wonderful period piece, full of gorgeous costumes and a cast that doesn't go ten minutes without introducing someone well known to costume drama fans. From Derek Jacobi to Michael Kitchen, it is not short on talent.

What the movie meant to convey and what it wound up revealing are two different things, but I often found myself frustrated with Marilyn and I'm not sure that is the emotion I was meant to have. The musical score is lovely and the script is fluid. Even though the lack of impersonations was disappointing for me, I quite enjoyed this film, not so much as its exploration of a certain week in time as for the heart that the actors put into it. Maybe they aren't carbon copies of their famous counterparts, but for the most part, they are trying their best. It's not perfect, but it is memorable and for that reason alone, I may return to it from time to time.",1332892800,,2659,4.6995708154506435

The point the movie really makes is Norma Jean Baker knew she was not Marilyn Monroe.  She wanted to be loved for Norma Jean, but she lost that persona through the sexual abuse in her teens, and was left with the fictional Marilyn.

Normally I am not a romantic retrospective kind of guy, but this was a brilliantly done movie.

The premise is that a young upper crust man wants to work in the movies.  He runs away from his noble home to ""join the circus"" and ends up camping out at Sir Laurence's movie offices where he literally camps out until work becomes available.

He is eventually given some small tasks that he excels at and is rewarded by being made the ""third director"" (basically the go-fer for everyone on the set).

Enter the big name Hollywood starlet, MarIlyn Monroe.

Normally I would add a spoiler alert, but you already know the plot.

Ms. Monroe is a difficult person to work with.  She has particular needs, and she gets what she wants.

I was a little worried that these fits of pique would all be explained away with psychobabble, and some of Marilyn's poor behavior is.  Still Director Simon Curtis does a good job at giving Ms. Monroe some empathy without making her a like able character.

Our upper crust runaway has his heart broken by his three day tryst with the married Marilyn, roll the credits.

I want to highlight one incredible performance.  Judi Dench, M from James Bond, steals the show.  She plays the grand dame of British film, and she plays the part perfectly.  The nobility radiates from her character in a positive way that enhances the characters around her.

This is a great film to cuddle up with and watch with some one special.

4622464,5,B0059XTUB8,"""My Week with Marilyn"" is great entertainment.  Michelle Williams is excellent as Monroe but for me one of the best things about the movie was the who's who roster of English actors, Brannagh as Olivier, Judi Dench is also present, as it Julia Ormond as Vivien Leigh (I believe she's French but she's appeared in many English productions and some American ones).  Michael Kitchen who is best known for the series ""Foyle's War"" is wonderful as is Zoe Wanamaker one of my all time favorite character actors, you'll recognize her from many, many BBC productions, in ""Marilyn"" she plays Paula Strasberg, Marilyn's acting coach and unofficial therapist.  Emma Watson who gained fame playing Hermione in the ""Harry Potter"" films also appears as Colin's would be girlfriend.  Eddie Redmayne is Colin Clark the young man who's diary the film was based on.  Redmayne is a face I didn't recognize but he's the epitome of a wide eyed, enthusiastic, fresh faced young man, the perfect foil for Marilyn's antics.  There was one scene when they return to Colin's alma mater, Eton, and as the two of them descend a staircase into a crowd of assorted Etonian students, teachers, cooks, and janitors, Marilyn turns to Colin and whispers in her vapory voice, ""Shall I be her?""  With that she sways her hips, purses her lips and poses seductively for her audience.  Michelle Williams transforms herself into Marilyn.  She captures Marilyn's vulnerability, her mood changes, her drug and alcohol use as well as her dream of being recognized as a great actress.  There was a scene from the film they're supposedly filming ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" where Marilyn is all by herself in a scene, she's humming and prancing around, both the dance and the song performed sotto voce, that was magic.  Michelle Williams disappears almost completely in these scenes, her personality is wiped clean and all you see is Monroe.  This is a film well worth your time.",1332720000,9,1936,4.904907975460123

I went to see it with a couple friends, without any prior knowledge of or interest in Marilyn Monroe's films or life, and didn't feel that I came away with much more of either. What I did find it to provide, quite powerfully, was a picture of the darker side of 1950s America.  A moment I found especially memorable is a scene in which a doctor calls a pregnancy a ""private matter"", very much as if it were something shameful.  Which, in that time of transition from Victorian prudery to equally superficial and judgmental body-envy, it may well have been.",1332633600,,619,4.508928571428571
4622466,4,B0059XTUB8,"I chanced to watch this film on a flight from Singapore to San Francisco. It turned out to be such a delightful film that I ended up watching it again before we landed. Marilyn Monroe died well before I knew much about her in India and over the years I had never seen  any of her films. But I have often read about her as a rather innocent person with immense sexuality and vulnerability. But lack of knowledge of Marilyn is not an impediment to enjoy this film. Whatever I imagined Marilyn Monroe to be was brought to life by the brilliant portrayal of Michelle Williams. She is vivacious like Marilyn as well.

The film is about the making of another film , 'The Prince and the Showgirl' in 1956 in England. The producer and director was the famous Laurence Olivier who also plays the role of the prince Regent of Carpathia. During the filming, Olivier flies into rage over Monroe's indecisive nature, her inability to fit into the organized structure of his work and her unpredictability. Monroeis intimidated and seeks refuge in the kindly, besotted, admiring 25-year old Colin Clark, who is the third assistant director in the staff. The movie is about the delightful simplicity of her life of one week with Colin. Then, her husband and playwright Arthur Miller returns from Boston and Marilyn leaves with him to the US, leaving Colin to cherish fondly that incredible one week.

Kenneth Branagh as Laurence Olivier is magnificent. Again, I have never seen Olivier's films but have read about him at various times. But Branagh just brings him to reality for me just as I had imagined Olivier to be. Young Eddie Redmayne as Colin is excellent as the 25-year old and very credible. And as I have said already, Michelle Williams is fantastic. She brings Marilyn's beauty, sexuality, innocence and vulnerability to life. She is the star of the film.

It is a must-see film simply for its ability to make you feel good about everything around you, at least temporarily!",1332633600,2,1969,4.7317784256559765
4622467,4,B0059XTUB8,"This review is from: My Week with Marilyn (DVD)
Customer review from the Amazon Vine(tm) Program (What's this?)
Colin Clark who comes from a very prestigious and well to do family is
not happy when he decides he wants to do something different then what
his family approves of and go into the movie business.
After being a constant nuisance he is finally hired as the 3rd
assistant to the director and at 23 he is going to meet and spend time
with Marilyn Monroe. In his time with Marilyn we learn how at thirty
she is on her third marriage to play writer Arthur Miller and Marilyn's
first to London to film the movie The Prine and the Showgirl with Sir
Lawrence Olivia.
We are then introduced to the sad, beautiful ,insecure and baby like
(always needing someone around) that is what Marilyn is all about.
She has a full time body guard and he has started giving her pills to
go to sleep and she also takes booze. When necessary Colin is sent to
find out what is keeping her while the entire crew waits for her (she
is always late) never seems to get her lines right on the first or
second take and is causing the company huge losses in money cause of
her mood and actions.
We all remember Marilyn as the sexy blonde bombshell and although I
must say Michelle Williams is absolutely wonderful in this movie I did
not feel she looked like what Marilyn looked like or was portrayed in
magazines and books she looks to shorter and is not as well endowed as
the real Marilyn but her acting is the reason she was a nominee as a
best actress.",1332633600,2,1537,4.321799307958478

4622469,5,B0059XTUB8,"""My Week With Marilyn"" is a bittersweet look into a young man's amazing encounter with the woman who defined stardom in the 1950s and early 1960s, and held millions of people in thrall from the silver screen. Colin Clark's true-life tale of his time working as a 3rd Assistant Director (i.e., a ""go-fer"") on the production of Sir Laurence Olivier's 1957 film, ""The Prince and the Showgirl"", is a charming, understated recreation of Clark's experiences during a few weeks in 1956, during which time he briefly became a member of Marilyn Monroe's inner circle.

Marilyn was, by all accounts, a fragile and insecure woman, and arrived in England for filming surrounded by an entourage (though small by today's media-darling standards) who tended her - and controlled her, to a certain extent. The 23-year-old Clark, in his position assisting Olivier, was often called on to get Monroe to the movie set on time and run errands for her as well as Olivier. It was in this capacity that he caught Marilyn's eye. As difficult as it may be to believe the events that unfold, as Marilyn takes Colin into her confidence, the film sells them with a charming, low-key approach.

Eddie Redmayne plays Colin Clark with just the right amount of wide-eyed naivet maturing into an increasing worldliness. Michelle Williams as Monroe is, in a word, magnificent. She captures Marilyn's beauty, fragility, and insecurity amazingly well, and is at her best, I think, when portraying Marilyn at her ease - whether charming young Clark during a day of playing ""hooky"" to see the sights in the English countryside, or lighting up with an impromptu star turn for admiring young Etonians or the staff at Windsor Castle during an unscheduled visit.

Kenneth Branagh is quite believable as Olivier, and the ironic juxtaposition of Branagh portraying the man whose career footsteps he has shadowed won't be lost on the viewer who is at all familiar with their two careers. Dame Judi Dench is delightful as Lady Sybil Thorndike, the septuagenarian actress who portrayed the Queen Dowager to Olivier's Prince Regent in the film, providing a supportive counterpoint to Branagh/Olivier's frustration and exasperation with Marilyn's tardiness and insecurity. Emma Watson, of ""Harry Potter"" fame, is charming in a small role as a junior wardrobe mistress with whom Colin Clark has a brief relationship before being drawn into Marilyn's orbit - the role is a foreshadowing of the great things to come, post-Potter, for Miss Watson.

Visually beautiful, and true to period in setting & wardrobe, ""My Week With Marilyn"" is a treat.",1332633600,3,2592,5.049065420560748

4622501,5,B0059XTUB8,I am a big Marilyn Monroe Fan and was not sure if I should even see that movie having very low expectations for Michelle Williams' performance. She is a good actress but I could not imagine her playing that role. But what a surprise! The movie was very entertaining and Michelle Williams so good I completely forgot sometimes that it was not Marilyn. The young male actor - Eddie? - was also terrific.

Michelle Williams doesnt particurly look like her, no, but shes such a great actress.  Despite physical differences I think she was perfect for the part.

4622507,4,B0059XTUB8,During the summer of 1956 Colin Clark was just getting into the film business as a 3rd-assistant on the set of 'The Prince and the Showgirl' starring Marilyn Monroe and Sir Laurence Olivier. His diary account of his involvement in that film's making in which we became her close confidant while she was trying to escape work pressures and the company of her Hollywood hangers-on.,1332288000,,379,4.846153846153846
4622508,3,B0059XTUB8,"Marilyn Monroe was an icon of beauty, of Hollywood leading ladies. To this day images of Monroe can be found on everything from posters to shot glasses. She is an image that film fans carry on even though many of them may never have taken the time to see one of her movies. Such is the price of fame and also a bit of the story seen in MY WEEK WITH MARILYN.

The movie is based on the true story of Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne), a young man who intends to not follow in the family footsteps but to become involved in the world of film making as he sets out on his own. Determined to get a job, he applies but is turned down for a position with Olivier Films, the studio overseen by Laurence Olivier (Kenneth Branagh). Through sheer determination and with a little luck, he gets a job there and is soon the third assistant director on Olivier's new film. In essence, he becomes a gofer.

It is 1956 and Olivier is about to begin his first non-Shakespearean movie, a romantic comedy called ""The Prince and the Showgirl"". Starring as well as directing he has chosen a Hollywood star on the rise as his co-star, Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams). But things start off bad and seem to get worse. Monroe is a method actor, taking time to work herself into the role she is playing while the cast and crew wait. Colin is sent to fetch her to the set and finds himself in awe; completely star stuck, but does get her there.

As each day progresses tempers flare and Monroe continues with her temperamental attitude. Those that surround her like her acting coach and manager continue to pamper her and keep up the steady flow of prescription medication. Their goal is to stay with the gravy train and ride it for all it's worth. Colin enters and instead tries to offer her a friend that she doesn't have.

After Marilyn's new husband Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott) returns to the U.S. to visit his children, Marilyn drops into another depression and calls Colin to her aid. Even though he was threatened by her manager, his devotion to the legendary actress continues. With the help of Colin as he distracts her and gives her the chance to share who she really is as opposed to the celebrity she has become, Marilyn does eventually finish the film. But at what cost?

The film fluctuates between two ideas and combines them to make an interesting feature. On the one hand we see the star seeking star treatment that then turns into a gifted talent. So great is her talent that Olivier even comments that she is a natural to Colin late in the film.

The other story is of a young girl who has seen the world, who has done what it takes to get where she is and who has lost something in the process. This is a fractured woman who feels she can't escape the caricature she has portrayed because it was after all fame, attention and love that she sought to begin with. But none of those around her truly care about the woman and seem more interested in the character. Except Colin, the young man who gets to know the real woman.

Don't think that the movie revolves around a physical love story. It's more about Colin's infatuation that becomes adoration and Marilyn's need for someone to accept her for nothing more than who she really is. In the end there is no way that this romance of sorts can happen or continue. Such is the price of fame.

Williams was nominated for an Oscar for her performance here. I'm not sure that it was that outstanding but she does a fine job. The performance is less about her ability to look like Monroe and more about her acting like her in the scenes of the movie being filmed and to portray her troubled psyche off screen. She does an amazing job.

More amazing to me was Branagh as Olivier with the same swagger and vocal patterns that fans of Olivier will notice right away. As always he turns in a great performance. Redmayne displays the innocence of a young man and fanatical side of a person infatuated with a star.

On the whole the movie is entertaining and enlightening. Will I watch it time and again? Probably not. But the movie is worth seeing at least once. With any luck it will help prevent a future actress from selling her soul to achieve her dream.",1332201600,,4189,4.428571428571429
4622509,1,B0059XTUB8,"In summation: This is a terrible movie about an insane, famous, horrible actress drug addict and her human dog. The end, that's the movie.

I am 25 so my perspective is fresh. I don't know Ms work personally. The most I've seen is her in playboy(I really don't know what all the fuss is about, she's not that hot) and I've never seen the movie that the film is about. Honestly if this movie portraying M is even 70% accurate M was bat poop insane. The entire time I was thinking to myself why would she... what's going on? This isn't a love story this is about a bat crap crazy crappy actress gaining a human dog for the duration of a film shoot. That's the only way to describe the 'relationship' between M and the boy. What I mean by that is you may like your dog and treat it well etc. but we all know that the dog has no choice but to obey and do as it's told. That's the way it is with the boy in the movie and M. All the crazy stuff she does he must go along with her and do as he is told he literally hasn't a choice in the matter. And one more thing I know M killed herself with drugs etc. w/e but really the way they just pump her full of crap is/was insane. The whole movie I was thinking to myself what bullocks this is insane. And the whole thing about her fame being crazy, it's almost like deep down inside as a species we've known for some time that God isn't real so we replace that vacuum with celebrities. Anyway, insane movie, insane time and unless you already know about M and that general time period I would say this movie is to messed up to watch.",1332201600,4,1571,4.051446945337621
4622540,5,B0059XTUB8,"Marilyn Monroe was every boy's (boys of a certain time period) fantasy girlfriend. She was my first idea of what a woman should be and my nave, adolescent idea of what sex was about. Marilyn was a little girl lost that every man she came into contact with wanted to save, and the different facets of personality continue to fascinate today, as evidenced in ""My Week with Marilyn"".

""My Week with Marilyn"" recounts a fairly well known moment in Monroe's life when she went  to England to star in ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" with Laurence Olivier. All accounts of the episode stress that it was a horrible pairing, Olivier in his work ethic as an actor and his craft which clashed with Monroe's insecurities and self-doubt about her acting abilities starting taking over her personality, as well as prescription drugs, which made Monroe late or a no-show for many days of shooting, or her trying to apply ""the method"" to her acting, all of which caused friction and down right loathing between the two. The story is told from the perspective of twenty-three year Colin Clark, who was a third assistant director in Olivier's production company, which essentially made him a gofer. But because Monroe took a liking to Clark he was one of the few people who Monroe would deal with and respond positively to, and they had a brief affair. The movie highlights the clash between the insecurities of Monroe and her acting abilities, and Olivier's insecurities about aging, with Colin caught in the middle and trying to appease both Olivier and Monroe.

Williams doesn't have most of Monroe's sexual charisma or most of Monroe's voluptuous attributes, what Williams has right is Monroe's look and the fragile vulnerability of the real Monroe (if there could be such a thing, Marilyn Monroe was the public persona of Norma Jean Baker, a kind of sexual Frankenstein's monster that got away from Baker but ultimately consumed her), and Williams lets that vulnerability show through the sex goddess persona as well. Eddie Redmayne as Colin Clark has the right eager naf-like quality for the role as the credulous liaison between Olivier and Monroe.  Kenneth Branagh disappears into his role as Olivier and although Branagh doesn't resemble Olivier he captures the nuances of Olivier from aging star to frustrated director trying to get a performance out of Monroe. There are also some very nice supporting roles, Emma Watson as a costume designer at the studio who Colin likes and who suddenly finds herself vying for his attentions against the greatest sex symbol of the 20th century. Dame Judi Dench has a nice turn as an aging actress who supports Monroe, and Julia Ormond as Vivien Leigh married to Olivier, not trusting his relationship to Monroe, foreshadowing the problems that would come later in her life.

While Monroe is an icon that still fascinates us to this day, maybe just that iconography may be sifting down to us. My sister watched the movie and thought it a bit boring, so this movie may be for people of a certain age, I hope not, I found it a well acted and interesting vignette into Olivier's and Monroe's life. If we don't remember the person behind the icon than we truly have hollow idols and lost the person behind them.

The bonus section has a nice making of the feature that lends insights into the principles both past and present as well as background material to the period. There's also a directors commentary.",1332201600,3,3432,4.828231292517007

4622542,3,B0059XTUB8,"With all due respect to Michelle Williams, a fine actress, who I'm sure put her heart and soul into this part, she just doesn't capture the brilliant essence of Marilyn Monroe. For the moment let's forget she doesn't look anything like Marilyn, nor does she possess the iconic curves (I would love to know why they didn't give the part to Scarlett Johannson, a wonderful actress who does possess those physical attributes). But the real missing ingredient here is Marilyn's dazzling screen presence. That's no knock on Williams! You can count on one hand the number of actresses who possessed the sort of presence as Monroe. Personally, I found the performances by Judy Dench and Emma Watson to be more captivating. But then again, they didn't have the unenviable task of trying to portray a screen legend! As a huge fan of Monroe I found the movie interesting, and I'm certainly glad I watched it. To be fair, Michelle Williams does an admirable job of portraying the person BEHIND the presence: an insecure, lonely, and unhappy woman. But I'd be lying if I said I wasn't ultimately disappointed. For those who aren't familiar with Marilyn's work, I think they would find the movie much more enjoyable.

Marilyn is overwhelmed with the job and her lack of confidence and co-dependence on other people for support is killing her acting in the movie. She and Colin strike up a relationship that leads....

This is a good story and a well-acted movie based on the book The Prince, The Showgirl and Me by the real Colin Clark. It is an interesting insight into Marilyn Monroe and the issues she had in her life. At thirty years old she was into her 3rd marriage by only a few weeks only to find that her husband Authur Miller (Dougray Scott) already didn't like being married to her and felt that her co-dependency was smothering him.

Michelle Williams does an absolutely amazing job at capturing Marilyn's essence, as though she were personally channeling the late star.

4622549,4,B0059XTUB8,"Marilyn Monroe remains one of the most famous creations of Hollywood for the last century.  In many ways she satisfied the needs of Everyman: she came form a abusive and loveless childhood, entered the realm of celluloid because of an incandescent beauty of body and face, she captured the hearts of everyone who flocked to her movies, she became the Queen of the World, and yet she was likely as fragile and insecure little porcelain doll as ever existed.  MY WEEK WITH MARILYN is apparently a true story written by Colin Clark based on his diaries `My Week With Marilyn' and `The Prince, the Showgirl and Me' and in Adrian Hodges adaptation for the screen all of the above mentioned qualities of the public and private Marilyn Monroe are condensed in a 90-minute film.  On many levels it works despite the rather choppy manner in which it is presented by director Simon Curtis.

1955 and Sir Laurence Olivier (Kenneth Branagh) is moving form the theater to make a movie in London. Young Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne), a lad form a wealthy family who is obsessed with being in the film business, wants to be involved and he navigates himself a job on the set. When film star Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams) arrives for the start of shooting, all of London is excited to see the blonde bombshell, while Olivier attempts to struggle to meet her many demands and acting ineptness, and Colin is intrigued by her. Colin's intrigue is met when Marilyn invites him into her inner world where she struggles with her fame, her beauty and her desire to be a great actress. It is this week of extreme fragility in Monroe's life where we discover more about Marilyn's psyche than we ever thought possible.

Populating the making of the film are Olivier's wife Vivien Leigh (Julia Ormond), Dame Sybil Thorndike (Judi Dench) who bolsters Marilyn's ego, Marilyn's current husband playwright Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott), Marilyn's acting coach and mentor Paula Strasberg (Zo Wanamaker), Marilyn's contingent of American movie moguls Milton Green (Dominic Cooper) and Arthur Jacobs (Toby Jones) as well as Colin's relative Sir Owen Morshead (Derek Jacobi) and Colin's would-be girlfriend Lucy (Emma Watson) along with a massive group of supporting actors in small roles. Michelle Williams and the makeup and costume department seem less interested in re-creating a Monroe droid, instead allowing Williams to enter the persona of Monroe - a wise decision and Williams accomplishes the impossible task of making us see Marilyn Monroe as a person.  The remainder of the cast is quite fine as one would expect with a group of actors of this caliber.  One can wonder why the many roles of Americans were cast with British actors, but that is a quibble. Though Williams has a lovely little voice in her many singing moments she does not resemble then inimitable Monroe sound and quirky vibrato - but that is in keeping with creating the spirit of Monroe and not imitating or mimicking the inimitable.  Alexandre Desplat once again provides a perfect music score for the film. In the end this is a satisfying if not overwhelming memoir of the one and only Marilyn Monroe. It works, thanks in large part to Michelle Williams. Grady Harp, March 12",1331769600,9,3226,4.895604395604396

Colin, the 3rd on the film, becomes Marilyn's friend and confidant; they also embark on a small love affair. While I have trouble believing every conversation and scene from this film happened in real life (this film is based on a true story book), it was still portrayed well.

Acting/Writing: The acting in this movie was very well done. Williams did well playing Marilyn. It wasn't a perfect performance, but it was pretty damn good.

The story of course is of a young english aristocrat who's love of cinema has him seek out a job in film.  Through his family connections he finally gets hired as 3rd assistant director in the film 'The Prince and the Showgirl' starring Laurence Olivier and Marilyn Monroe.  The story thereafter is of a brief non-sexual encounter with Monroe and all that happened in the making of the film. Kenneth Branagh is superb channeling Sir Laurence Olivier, in a performance that had me laughing half the time and mesmerized about the small aspects of Olivier's style he managed to hone without it coming across as camp. Marilyn famously clashes with Olivier, who as director, has to put up with her tardiness, forgetting lines and general fragile yet diva behaviour.

Now for Michelle Williams.  In the beginning of the film they show an excerpt of Williams performing Heat Wave from the film 'There's No Business Like Show business""  and I immediately had mixed feelings and almost thought she was miscast;  it was her body.  You see Williams diminutive child-like frame barely holding up a dress meant for a curvier woman. They pad her hips which contrasts two twigs meant to be legs, small arms and breasts, old hollywood make-up that left Williams looking old and washed out and not a hint of sexiness...I was aghast and thought ""This is wrong, ALL WRONG!!!"". They make up for this by later concentrating mostly on Williams face who is more than talented enough to exude the vulnerability, freshness, seductive sweetness and almost too open unguarded expressions we come to recognize as distinctly Monroe charm, also they leave off the heavy make-up.  This is a role where the physicality is important, we don't just remember Marilyn's face but the natural contours of her body, so to have an actress with the wrong body distracts the same way a too skinny woman playing Sophia Loren would have you questioning the authenticity of the role. The camera however compensates and concentrates on what Williams gets right which is the mood and cheekiness of Marilyn, the vanilla ice cream sexiness and little girl lost.  Its a distilled Marilyn that left me thinking ""Nicely Done!"".  Williams brings a dignity, humanity and authentic classy sweetness to the role. I'm sure Marilyn would have been proud.

There is no question that the portrayal of what went on at the shooting of The Prince and the Showgirl is accurate.  If you have read enough biographies on Marilyn at that time everything in this film just fits including the nature of he behaviour which today is attributed to Borderline Personality Disorder.  They show MM as manipulative but in the way toddlers are, grabbing hold demanding time, attention and affection when they need you and then forgetting you minutes later only to return and drain you a bit more, the difference is we don't take it personally when it comes from a toddler.  Marilyn was very emotionally demanding and consequently seduced a lot of minders and helpers and people who thought only they could protect her, understand her, help her when in the end they were simply dangling from her strings. It is said that during the filming 'The Misfits' Marilyn broke Arthur Miller who was doing everything and anything to make her happy; at the end of shooting she had arranged a ride from location with other people and got in a car which drove away leaving Miller deserted, abandoned, alone and without a ride on a deserted set.  It was as if he were merely an old shoe she had forgotten to pack.  Consequently they divorced but he like Di Maggio loved her dearly and both went to their grave never writing or speaking of Marilyn out of complete respect for her.  If only Princess Diana could have said the same.",1331769600,2,3976,4.837758112094395
4622602,5,B0059XTUB8,"While observing this solely on the movie's merit, not if it may or may not be 'factual', as it is based on the personal diaries of Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne), I definitely enjoyed this story.  A glimpse into one week of the iconic status of Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams) is a provocative notion.  I found Williams able to display the subtleties of her charge and make this demand convincing.  Williams fleshes out Monroe in a solemnization.  She neither fully inhabits nor imitates her as much as she celebrates the Marilyn Monroe everyone could appreciate.  I found her quite deft in balancing Monroe's obvious intelligence along with her shaky naivety at the same time.  Of course, Williams could never replicate Marilyn Monroe in a performance as the physicality of the two is widely different among other things, although I saw her bring the nuances and idiosyncrasies of Monroe's personality to life.  Her stage presence, sexuality, innocence, and vulnerability are all well shown.

Into London of 1955 comes the filming of the anticipated movie ""The Prince and the Showgirl"".  A young, and obviously obsessed with the film business, Colin Clark, is able to get involved with the production, but more so with the object of his desire, Marilyn Monroe.  He offers her a certain freedom with his friendship during an intense time of fragility for her. He provides laughter, hushed conversations, free-spirited romps, and the ability to escape everything which includes her own harsh reality. The film, presented in this way, shows the almost over-importance of Clark in the making of Laurence Olivier's movie concerning his handling of Marilyn Monroe alone. But, of course, this is all done from his point of view, his ideas and beliefs.

While the acting is all quite good, a complete stand out for me was Kenneth Branagh as Sir Laurence Olivier.  He pulled perfection into his portrayal of the ego driven icon that he was himself.  His mannerisms, temperament, perfectionism, and vocal all screamed ""Olivier"".  The renowned stage actor coming into the making of this movie was a huge transition, especially while wanting to cast the Hollywood ""movie star"", Marilyn Monroe, alongside himself.

An understated Vivien Leigh - 'Lady Olivier' - (Julia Ormond), shows an ease in her position of his wife and a more vulnerable side with her adoration of her husband.  The wonderfully astute Dame Sybil Thorndike (Judi Dench) lends a firm hand and a necessary leading guidance for Monroe especially when sparks start to fly.  In ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" she was the softest and caring anchor for Monroe's shaky resolve and awestruck times during the filming. This all happening as Olivier's control was escaping him.  She remained soothing and tried to keep the balance between these two iconic' actors, but, more so, these two egos.

""My Week With Marilyn"" is just that, according to Colin Clark.  His week along with her, done from his diaries and adapted from his book. With taking this all into mind, I thoroughly enjoyed the film and have watched it several times.",1331769600,10,3077,5.043478260869565

4622607,5,B0059XTUB8,"Marilyn Monroe will live forever, probably until the end of time. I don't know if it was her acting talents or lack of, her beauty, her portrayed innocence, her sexuality or many other qualities, but the thing is, we can't have enough of her. A lot has been written about her and her sad and misunderstood life, and the exquisite ""My week with Marilyn"" gives us a charming and honest look at Marilyn's character in some detail

Perhaps the best way to describe what this film is all about is by quoting the paragraph that opens it: ""In 1956 Marilyn Monroe went to England to make a film with Laurence Olivier. She met Colin Clark, who wrote a diary about the making of the film."" Colin Clark was a well-to-do young man who wanted to make it in show business, and for that purpose he went to Laurence Olivier's (Kenneth Branagh) production office on a daily basis, in order that he could be hired. His insistence paid off and Olivier hired him as third assistant director on the film ""The Sleeping Prince."" His position basically was that of an errand way, which he accepted and worked very hard at it. The star of the film, in addition to Olivier - who  also directed --, was Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams), who arrived to England with her then husband, writer Arthur Miller.

During the filming of the movie, Monroe was problematic, and it was driving Olivier insane, with, her coming late to the set, her insecurities, her constant auto medication, her troubles with her husband, and the presence of her controlling acting coach. Olivier was at one point advised to ""try to accept her in her own terms to avoid problems. Trying to change her would drive him crazy."" To the rescue came Colin, who, for some reason Marilyn got attached to, and became her confidant. This relationship would affect the completion of the film, and would change Colin's life forever.

""My week with Marilyn"" is kind of a coming of age film - at least for Colin --, but it also gives us an intimate look at Marilyn's persona, and how tormented she was. And, despite all this, she had the gift of stealing people's hearts, as well as a special kind of charisma on the screen. Judy Dench, who plays actress Sybil Thorndike, said it best, when she told Colin that ""first love is such sweet despair."" The film, which was later called ""The Prince and the Showgirl,"" was done before the successful ""Some like it hot.""  Needless to say, Michelle Williams was nominated for an Oscar for her amazing portrayal of Marilyn Monroe, and Kenneth Branagh was nominated for his portrayal of Laurence Olivier. The Blu-ray edition includes the DVD format of the film, commentary by director Simon Curtis, and a making-of documentary.(UK/USA, 2011, color, 99 min plus additional materials).

I pre-bought it thinking I would be moved by a different story other than the difficult, pill-induced Marilyn that I've seen portrayed. While Williams does give a strong performance of the electric and spell-binding Monroe, I found the film overall, predictable and two dimensional. I believe there was a lot more to M.M than this film portrayed- painful, desirous, and strong. However, I felt the story caricaturized M.M. to a point that she was a cardboard cutout, once again, used for other peoples' delight. This is unfortunate. I was expecting a more complicated illustration... Not some weak, diluted representation of someone's ill-assumed diary. No doubt do I believe this is a true story from the perception of the author- but I think it's a very superficial understanding, unless Miss Monroe, of course, was a pretentious, privileged one dimensional individual.

4622622,4,B0059XTUB8,"By Jim Clark, publisher Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS

Marilyn Monroe is best known as the quintessential American female sex symbol. After watching My Week With Marilyn I came away feeling sorry for both her, and the man who spent the week with her, aspiring filmmaker Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne).
According to the movie she never knew her father. Instead she kept a photo of Abraham Lincoln by her bed, the logic being ""it might as well be him."" Her mother didn't want to care for her, so she was placed with foster parents.
By the time we're into My Week With Marilyn she's been married three times, and divorced twice.
Marilyn, at the time, was married to Arthur Miller (the author of To Kill a Mockingbird). She is to be learning her lines for The Prince and The Showgirl. Arthur is there, partially to support his new bride, but mainly to work on his next novel. Marilyn is needy, usually distraught about something and an early victim of taking pills to get up, pills to go to sleep, and what ever else. Arthur can't concentrate so leaves.
That's when Colin moves in -- he's young, never been in a relationship and infatuated with Marilyn.
Laurence Olivier recognizes this and tells young Colin, ""Remember boy, when it comes to women, you're never too old for humiliation."" But it's to no avail - he's lovestruck.
Marilyn locks herself in her bedroom. Her co-stars become worried and frustrated because she is holding up production. The only person she'll talk to is Colin, who is more then ready to put up with anything just to be next to her.",1330992000,,1553,4.6268115942028984

A charming, flirty 23 year old British guy falls in love with the 30 year old Marilyn who's had three divorces and dwindling faith in her own personality. There is some dialogue about how Marilyn felt that everyone leaves her once they get to know her.  To sum up I'd like to say, this will serve as a perfect Home Box Office film for several decades to come. Also I must add that an actor who was nominated for oscar - Kenneth Branagh didn't act that well at all. Especially in the climax of the film.",1330992000,3,750,4.319148936170213
4622624,5,B0059XTUB8,"Marilyn Monroe has been portrayed many times on the screen, but never as sensitively or believably as with Michelle Williams' Oscar-nominated performance in MY WEEK WITH MARILYN, now available in a Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack from Anchor Bay Entertainment.

Indeed, Ms. Williams becomes Marilyn to the point where one forgets that one is watching a movie about Marilyn Monroe and believes that that is the real person up on the screen.

The film, directed by Simon Curtis, is based on a memoir by Colin Clark that details his experience as a 3rd assistant director on the troubled film, THE PRINCE AND THE SHOWGIRL, which starred Monroe and Laurence Olivier (Kenneth Branagh), who also directed that 1956 release.  Marilyn was newly wed to Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott) when she traveled to London for the first time in order to make the picture, and the playwright was having a difficult time dealing with her neuroses.  When he took a brief trip back to New York, Clark (Eddie Redmayne) was conscripted by Marilyn for a week to be her emotional support.

The casting of the movie is letter perfect.  I can imagine no other actor than Branagh as Olivier and, as with Williams, he quickly makes you believe that you are actually watching the legendary British actor in person.  Redmayne is very likable as the young novice Clark, as are Judi Dench as Dame Sybil Thorndike and Julia Osmond as Vivien Leigh.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN is a charming, thoroughly entertaining film that not only give viewers a realistic look at a nostalgic era of movie-making, but also an insider's viewpoint of some of that time's most revered figures.

4622625,5,B0059XTUB8,"I'm old enough to remember seeing most of Marilyn Monroe's films on the big screen when they were released. And I'm sure I had her pinup somewhere in my room. I'm sorry she never finished her last film ""Something's Gotta Give"" but, as I was watching Michelle Williams in the new film, I felt I was seeing a ""New"" Marilyn film. Williams was perfect casting. And I had never seen her before. I missed ""Blue Valentine"". She really channels Monroe and is both sexy and introspective.

As you have probably read - I won't go over the plot again, as others have surely done that here - the film is based on Colin Clark's journal about the week he spent on the set of the film that eventually became ""The Prince and The Showgirl"". I can't think of a male over age 18 that won't think - while watching this film - ""Wow! If only I was in Clark's position!"" And I'm sure many will dream of that! Honestly, I  can't say how this plays out from the point of the female viewer.

No this is not an ""epic"" film but rather the kind of small ""Quality"" films that the Weinstein Company finds and releases. (Just look at ""The Artist"", ""The Descendants"" and ""The Iron Lady""; all with superb casting and lots of Oscar noms.). And for that I can recommend it highly. It's not long - at just 99 minutes.

Both the DVD and the Blu-ray have the same bonus features. These include a full length commentary by Director Simon Curtis as well as a 19-minute "" The Untold Story of An American Icon"", which is the now-typical ""making of"" featurette which mixes comments from the cast and production crew with scenes from the film. There a few actually newsreels clips of Monroe included, but not enough to mention. And there is nothing included putting this ""week of filming in England"" into perspective with the rest of Monroe's career or the culture of the times. A short documentary on Monroe would have added greatly to the experience for viewers who were not alive during Monroe's life.

My five-stars are based on the film itself, as I want to encourage others to see it. But if I had to rare the package as a whole it would be 4 stars.

I hope you found this information both helpful and informative

4622626,5,B0059XTUB8,"""My Week with Marilyn"" is a biographical film that focuses on Marilyn Monroe starring in the movie ""The Prince and the Showgirl,"" which was shot in England.

The story is based on two books by British filmmaker Colin Clark (played by Eddie Redmayne) who had personal interaction with Monroe, and much of the film's narrative is from the point of view of Clark, who is warm and likeable.

Michelle Williams is exceptional as Monroe, and she presents with shining glamour and captures the vulnerability of Monroe's personality with poignant authenticity.

It is a credit to director Simon Curtis that he chose to make a film about Monroe, which focuses on an extract of her life and career, yet he was able to capture so many facets of the Monroe brand and persona without attempting to make a movie of her whole life. This is too often an overambitious target of filmmakers to pack a life into one film, but the selection of a set period of time was a masterstroke by Curtis, which allowed for deeper immersion of Monroe over a short period of time.

The viewer is easily enchanted by the beauty and complexity of Monroe, and Clark is a faithful friend and servant to her, who gets to see the person behind the star.

4622627,5,B0059XTUB8,"""My Week With Marilyn"" was at the top of our to-see list when we first heard about it, and especially after we saw a trailer.

We checked and checked and finally found it only at a mall theater about eleven miles away, but we shrugged and said to ourselves, ""Well, this is a special occasion.  OK.""  Then when we got to the theater and after we bought the tickets, we found that the movie was available only in one of those so-called dinner theater setups, with a total seating capacity of 32, and no seats available for us to sit together.  Now we like to have meals out, and we like to go to movies, but we just don't care to do both at the same time.  To us it is incongruous to watch a meaningful film with the smell of French fries and burgers or whatever, wafting over everything.  So we got a refund and went home very disgruntled.  And kept looking for the possibility of the movie showing up in wider distribution, as sometimes mysteriously happens.  Well, finally, we found it at a `normal' movie theater, fifteen miles away, and now we were flat determined to go see that movie.  And oh, how glad we were that we did.  The story was beautifully written and directed, the actors were all superb, and we walked out of the movie and all we could say was, ""Wow"".  And we passed the word along to all our friends, along with the less than encouraging difficulty it was to even find the movie being shown, much less in what we consider a suitable venue.

Apparently the receipts on this film are remarkably low because no one could find it, and yet the film has garnered all sorts of awards and nominations, including Academy nominations for two of the actors.  And we simply cannot figure out why on earth this jewel of a film was not as carefully marketed and displayed as it was carefully made.  Some of the films nominated for ""Best Movie"" made a lot of money.  At least two of them, in our opinions, weren't worth the digital material it took to film them.  There's no accounting for tastes.  But for all the folks out there who love good movies with good stories and good actors and wonderful settings, get the DVD of MWWM.  Ours is already ordered.

4622628,4,B0059XTUB8,"Every time I tune into a film about Monroe, I find myself unable to look away.  I suppose I am like those people who stare at car crash scenes or crashed plane sites.  It is that kind of sensation.  And although this movie has many lovely moments, every time Marilyn is on screen, we are aware of such a potential crash scene waiting in the wings. Michelle Williams thus well deserves her Oscar nomination for capturing a period in her life wherein she still had fleeting moments of happiness but most of the time could feel disaster closing in on her.

This is set in England while she was making PRINCE AND THE SHOW GIRL with Olivier. It is not one of her better movies although she is the best thing in it.  The problem in it was the massive ego of Larry Olivier and having that ego at the helm of the production as director. Monroe needed to be coddled through a film by a director with a handkerchief at the ready and a deep well of patience.  Olivier had neither. Colin, a young man who is third assistant director on the film helps take care of her while she is filming. Most of the time she is the Marilyn who is right at the edge of coming apart but she is still able to be delightful for brief periods and especially with this young man who is still an innocent compared to these vultures in the film industry.

Kenneth Branagh also does an excellent job playing Olivier and brings a great deal of humor to the film as he plays him so broadly at points that you are sure he is satirizing him. Branagh was an unexpected delight in this role.

Williams looks uncannily like Monroe and I think she accomplishes this with some fairly simple tactics.  One, rather than being overly made up, which is what is usually done by those playing her, Williams instead goes for capturing the looks she was more famous for in her stills when she was a lot more natural looking. Two, Williams really worked on her voice and body movements and captured them very well.  We actually identify people every bit as much by those expressive motions and she nailed them.

There isn't much plot here.  It is simply getting this picture made so she can be off.  We are so fascinated by her that any more plot would probably just get in the way.

4622629,5,B0059XTUB8,"When I went to see this movie in December, inwardly I was lamenting the overall quality of movies in 2011, with a plethora of remakes, reboots and sequels, and I wondered if Hollywood was running out of fresh ideas, while recycling the same formulas.  Remakes/reboots in 2011 included  Straw Dogs, Footloose, Arthur,  The Thing, Conan, Spy Kids, Final Destination 5, and Rise of the Planet of the Apes.

Some of the movies were high quality such as Girl with the dragon tattoo, and Xmen First Class.

Last year Michelle Williams deservedly received her second Academy Award nomination for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Valentine/dp/B0036TGTDE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Valentine</a>, and now she is nominated for the role of Marilyn Monroe.  I liked this movie enormously, and was disappointed that it did not get nominated for Best Picture instead of Extremely Loud and Incredibly close, a dubious choice.

Nevertheless politics being what it is  if MWWM was nominated it might give the appearance of Weinstein Studios having too much sway with the Academy Awards, as they also released the Artist with 11 nominations, and the appalling Iron Lady whose only redeeming grace is Meryl Streeps nominated performance, and last year had The Kings Speech.

What Michelle Williams and the movie delivers is a very delicately nuanced and multi dimensional portait of Marilyn that we have not seen previously, those shifts in personality, her ability to be vunerable, to charm, to seduce and manipulate, and if you are Larry Olivier the ability to frustrate your ambition to make an incredible movie. In a perhaps ironic twist in view of recent events we see the entourage of people who can't say no or risk punishment or exclusion.

So we have a young wideeyed  man who through connections gets his first job in the business working for Olivier, and responsible for keeping things even with Marilyn. If you're like me you wonder if he will be drawn too far into the web of Marilyn, and if the obvious siren attraction of Marilyn will be his doom.  They grow close and here is where the movie takes some liberties on the book on which it's based, but the will they won't they aspect will keep you guessing after the final credits roll.  The movie captures the period very well.

Although most attention has focused on the performance of Michelle Williams, I loved the performance of Kenneth Branagh as Laurence Olivier. He listened to Oliver on audio to perfect the mannerisms and the lines, and even had the exact same shoes custom made to fit the part.

It seems fitting that someone who has spent a career following in Olivier's footsteps, acting Shakespeare and bringing the plays to the screen, may finally get the Academy Award for walking in his shoes.

It's clear here that he is a superior actor, and perfectly achieves both his theatrical mannerisms and intonations particularly rolling the R's, and all the grand subtleties of the theatrical master.  At the end of the movie he delivers a portion of a soliloquy from Prospero in The Tempest.  This for me was like a spiritual experience, it was so sublime.  Naturally,  I hope that he wins although Christopher Plummer appears to the stern competition this year winning several awards in the runup including the Golden Globe.

When I left this movie I felt optimistic and relieved at finally seeing a good movie.  Shortly afterwards all the best movies were released in time for an Oscar run including  The Descendants,  The Artist, Warhorse, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and Hugo.  So, if you want to be an Oscar contender release your movie in December.

Recently we have seen a trend in the Academy Awards toward real life characters with Marion Cotillard winning for  portraying Edith Piaf, Helen Mirren for playing the queen, Colin Firth for playing a king, Christian Bale for playing an addict.  Usually the character has some flaw or adversity to cope with, tragedy, a stutter, addiction.  This year it's  Alzheimers, addiction/neurosis and racial discrimination.

Throughout the movie I laughed and also teared up at the deeply tragic side of Marilyn Monroe seemingly trying to decipher real life from her character used throughout her movies. When the movie ended, no one in the theatre moved for a while and there was a quiet awe of the movie. Any doubt that I had in Michelle Williams acting abilities were diminished when I saw how completely she played the role of the ""real"" Marilyn Monroe. I could watch this movie multiple times.",1329696000,3,600,4.513761467889908
4622691,5,B0059XTUB8,I have seen the film 3 times already and loved it.  Michelle Williams brings the kind of attention to a feminist that any woman would be thankful to have.  Marilyn Monroe was much more than a sex symbol she a symbol of an orphan who went on to become of the most successful and diverse actresses of her time and all time.,1329523200,2,321,4.161290322580645
4622692,4,B0059XTUB8,"My Week with Marilyn is based on two books by Colin Clark; one a diary documenting the shoot of The Prince and the Showgirl, the other a memoir of his alleged affair with Marilyn Monroe during that shoot. Even though it has origins in literature, the plot is noticeably lacking. Then again, I suppose My Week with Marilyn was never really about plot. Distributed by the Weinstein Company, this is a film for Harvey Weinstein to provide awards push. It's a slight film, where a strong, complex story takes a backseat to providing roles for talented actors to fill and potentially win Oscars for. That's not to say the making of the film itself or the performances are driven by greed or that any involvement is superficial, just that no one involved was surprised when they were nominated for their work.

This movie boasts several strong performances, but the focus comes down on Michelle Williams as the titular character. I trust Williams as an actress, but I never envisioned her as Monroe. To embody the cosmic force that was Marilyn Monroe is no easy task. Now, I can't envision anyone tackling this role so beautifully. For a brief 99 minutes, Williams is Marilyn Monroe. She embodies her, absorbing all of the characteristics and producing a performance with more dimension than what was initially on the page. It's no secret that Monroe was more troubled and complicated than her onscreen persona, but the film only allows glimpses of her true nature. After all, it takes place during a brief period of time, from the limited perspective of one person who had never met her and would never meet her again. Alas, this is not a Monroe biopic. It's harmless, award-hungry fluff that rises above the material with one of the most convincing transformations into a real person I've seen in some time.

Eddie Redmayne is 23-year-old Colin Clark, whose determination lands him a job as the assistant to Laurence Olivier (played by Kenneth Branagh, a nice touch) on the set of The Prince and the Showgirl. Olivier is directing the film and has cast Monroe, whom he can barely conceal his yearning for. Of course, Olivier was married to Vivien Leigh (Julia Ormond) and Monroe to Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott) at the time, but Monroe's affect on men has been well documented. Colin, like anyone in her presence, is drawn to her but is preoccupied with keeping his job and attempting to woo a set girl named Lucy (Emma Watson). With Olivier growing increasingly frustrated with the aloof Monroe, who is busy grappling with her own insecurities, Colin suddenly finds himself befriending Monroe. Romance, to some extent, ensues, but the film is coy about it. Perhaps the book goes into greater detail, but nothing about the story is particularly fascinating or memorable. It's all a backdrop.

To play a real person, an actor does not need to resemble the person they're portraying. Their job is to capture the essence of a person rather than embody their physical characteristics. Branagh and Oliver share only a fleeting resemblance, while Ormond hardly looks like Leigh at all. Meanwhile, Redmayne and Scott look a little closer to their real-life counterparts, but Williams is the whole package. Perhaps this contributes to how much her performance stands out. I'm not knocking Redmayne, Scott, Branagh, or Ormond, but Williams trumps them all and completely inhabits Marilyn Monroe, essence and all. How appropriate, in this context. Monroe embraced the Method approach to acting, while Olivier saw acting as little more than saying the lines convincingly. Branagh says his lines convincingly, but Williams disappears.

In life, Williams doesn't look much like Monroe. Makeup and acting ability apparently go a long way. She magically captures the voice, the charm, the more private aspects, and, of course, the iconic look. When she is onscreen, you forget you're watching Williams. A role like this screams ""Oscar!"" but she really brings it to life triumphantly. Her Oscar-nomination is well-deserved and I wouldn't be terribly disappointed if she won. The film does a sufficient job of showing the multiple sides of Monroe's personality, but is restricted from going too in-depth. Neither Williams nor the script is able to paint a complete psychological portrait of Monroe, but both successfully portray the many facets, public and private, of this sex symbol. Williams perfectly balances the mature, yet child-like, flirtatious, innocent quality that Monroe possessed, eternally locked somewhere between cute and sexy. Monroe is presented here as both the person and the ideal, with Williams playing her to perfection without a false note. Redmayne has a likable, boyish charm and it is fun to watch the other actors become Hollywood royalty, but Williams singlehandedly makes the film worth watching.

The direction by Simon Curtis is stagnant, simply because anyone could have directed it and there's nothing dynamic about the way the film is put together. The screenplay is fashioned well, recounting events with very little creative flourish. It just misses the boat on being a great film by playing everything too safe. It's a very standard portrait of a true story that would be solid, yet forgettable without the terrific performances. If the Monroe role had been miscast, the film likely would have been satisfying but would have completely slipped from memory afterwards.

A minor film with major star power, it's neither deep nor astounding but worth admission price for Michelle Williams' performance. She has already demonstrated a wide breadth of talent, but she shows here that she may not have even touched the surface of her own potential. Aside from my praise for Williams, this review may sound harsh despite my intentions.

The major weakness is that it is unapologetic, blatant Oscar-bait and it sticks so close to that particular formula that it lends itself to inferiority. However, blatant Oscar-bait is often better than most films and removing it from this context, My Week with Marilyn stands as a well-made, well-acted film that impresses without surprising. Just like a real-life week with Marilyn would unfold, the film flies by and, like the relationship between Clark and Monroe, there's no middle ground. The film has a beginning and an end, reaching the latter swiftly and almost abruptly. Just like spending a week with Marilyn, she's all that matters during this time...And after.",1329264000,2,6420,5.0853889943074

Rating: 3.5

Colin Clark was only 24 years old when he served as '3rd Assistant Director' on the 1957 film 'The Prince and The Showgirl' starring Marilyn Monroe and Lawrence Olivier. Clark kept a diary while on the set and later published it, along with a memoir of his purported experiences with Monroe. It's notable that Clark didn't seem overly impressed with the Hollywood icon, when he wrote in his diary, but when the memoir came out, his view of her apparently had changed to much more 'favorable'.

For those unfamiliar with 'My Week with Marilyn', it provides a glimpse at Marilyn Monroe at the height of her popularity, a few months after she married famed playwright, Arthur Miller, in 1956. This was a chance for Marilyn to show her chops, pitted against stage legend Olivier, who in turn was given the reins to direct, 'The Prince and the Showgirl', a light weight comedy with the ""most popular woman in the world"", in the starring role. Dougray Scott is a dead ringer for Miller but his character is only on screen very briefly, as Miller decided to go back home right before the shoot, as he was having trouble putting up with all of Marilyn's mood changes. Judi Dench is also too briefly seen as Dame Sybil Thorndike, who plays an older aristocratic woman in the film within a film.

Michelle Williams does a very nice job conveying the many moods of the starlet. When Monroe first came to the set of 'The Prince and the Showgirl', she was intimidated by Olivier, who was not impressed with her coach, Paula Strausberg, an advocate of Method Acting. While Kenneth Branagh doesn't look at all like Olivier, he ably conveys his contempt for both Marilyn's lack of professionalism and 'The Method' itself, as he was convinced that actors could never be spontaneous when utilizing such a technique. Olivier is seen warning Clark that he should not be fooled by Monroe's ""little girl lost"" routine. Not only was Monroe habitually late on the set but we learn of a more deep-seated insecurity, which she attempted to mask by imbibing huge amounts of prescription medication.

Williams also does well in conveying Marilyn Monroe's charm. Most of the film's narrative is about how Colin Clark acts as her buffer, 'protecting' her against the various people she felt assailed by, including her business partner, Milton Greene, who attempted to bar Clark from spending time with her, during the production. Clark appears to fall completely for Monroe especially after she continuously flirts with him. In one scene, Monroe encourages Clark to join him skinny-dipping in a lake, off the beaten path, in the English countryside; later, she invites him into her bed for some heavy duty cuddling.

While entertaining, the film suffers from the limits of its venue. We pretty much realize that the stakes aren't that high here to begin with--a young man takes a soft fall, after he realizes that his infatuation was just that--an infatuation! The 'dark moment' of the second Act arrives when Marilyn has her big meltdown, which threatens to shut down the entire production. All's well that ends when, when Marilyn wakes up and wants to go home for her mother-in-law's chicken soup, back in Brooklyn.

Eddie Redmayne may be a tad too old to play Colin Clark, but is still fine as the impressionable gopher. Emma Watson is seen for a short time in a throwaway part as Colin's love interest, perhaps the least interesting role in the entire film. There are other players in short bits here, that add to the film's overall verisimilitude.

Perhaps the most telling scene in the film is when Clark asks Marilyn to give up her career and run away with him. She graciously declines by replying that she enjoys her life. If that's the case, why does she spend so much time popping pills and generally being so down on herself? Olivier sees her as a lot shrewder than many of her handlers and sycophants, who appear to indulge and enable her. This is perhaps one aspect of Marilyn's character, the shrewd businesswoman, that is not explored very fully in this film--however, since we're only getting a glimpse of what she was like during a limited time period, such an exploration may be a bit beyond the scope of this overall project.

'My Week with Marilyn' sometimes borders on hagiography. Whatever talent Marilyn Monroe did have, it seems that the many men who 'fell in love' with her, fell more for an image than a real person. I wonder if she could have done as well in the acting department, if she wasn't completely addicted to all her pills. Nonetheless, here, Michelle Williams does a fine job in serving up enough aspects of Marilyn Monroe's character to keep us interested until the end. Sadly Colin Clark is no longer with us, but while he was alive, he must have looked back on those heady days of his youth, as perhaps the greatest experience of his life. 'My Week With Marilyn' allows us to take that journey too, and a good part of it rings true.",1328745600,4,4998,4.74223245109321
4622694,4,B0059XTUB8,"There are movie stars, and there are Movie Stars. For ten short years, few shone as bright as Marilyn Monroe's. In the fifties and early sixties, she was every American man's dream girl, from presidents to princes. She might have been the quintessential female star of the Hollywood sound era, a pinup Greta Garbo in living, luscious color.

You won't need to be a fan (or a man) to fall in love with ""My Week with Marilyn,"" which features some of the best performances of 2011. In a role that would scare off scores of actresses, Michelle Williams is nearly spot-on as the once-plain Norma Jeane.

At the height of her fame in 1956, Monroe traveled to Olde England to make ""The Prince and the Showgirl,"" directed by none other than Laurence Olivier, the regal grand man of the British stage and screen. During brief intermissions in the troubled production, the 30-year-old Monroe struck up an unlikely friendship (and perhaps more) with Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne), a lowly assistant director not unexpectedly dazzled by the blonde bombshell.

Clark's 1995 memoir (""The Prince, the Showgirl and Me"") was followed by ""My Week with Marilyn"" in 2000, and those few days have been translated with taste and movie-loving brio by director Simon Curtis and screenwriter Adrian Hodges. Unlike the exploitative handling of Monroe before and after her tragic death in 1962, Curtis, Williams and company have fleshed out the person behind the one-dimensional star image: insecure, innocent, frightened, and mercurial--as well as a heavenly vision of beauty and sensuality....

4622695,4,B0059XTUB8,"How is it that one film could dodder from enthralling to mediocre and back again, repeat cycle, so many times? It's what happens when you mix a so-so movie with an incredible performance by its leading actor. Michelle Williams sparkles like diamonds as iconic legend Marilyn Monroe. I've seen a good assortment of Monroe's films, and I can tell you, hands down, that Williams was Monroe, perhaps a little thinner, but she was Monroe. She's that good. I found myself gazing at the clock whenever Williams was off screen yet magically transfixed upon her return.

In My Week, we follow a young, mostly innocent movie entrepreneur, Colin Clark, who falls under Marilyn's spell during the production of The Prince and the Showgirl. Her marriage to Arthur Miller has begun to unravel, and things aren't going well on set. See, acting royalty Laurence Olivier is a great performer attempting to become a movie star and Marilyn is an icon seeking out her great performance. Problems ensue, and soon Clark is requested to spend a week's hiatus with the paranoid, pill popping Monroe. The rest is a gift for Clark, but more so for us, who welcome Monroe's triumphant return on film.

4622696,4,B0059XTUB8,"This was a surprisingly good adaptation of a questionable romance between Marilyn and Colin Clark (while on her honeymoon with Arthur Miller!) Kenneth Branagh and Dame Judi Dench are fantastic as Olivier and Dame Sybil Thorndike as well as Julia Ormand as Vivien Leigh. The costumes,  Make-up and set detail make it fun for MM fans to see what it was like to be on the infamous set of The Sleeping Prince.

The movie does show how screwed up Marilyn was emotionally as well as addicted to drugs and alcohol. Michelle Williams blew me away! She managed to capture the Marilyn Mystique through her voice and manerisms. Considering she really doesnt look like Monroe it is amazing. I think this is an extremely realistic look at the real Marilyn Monroe.

An Excellent movie and throughly entertaining from beginning to end.",1328054400,2,820,4.8428571428571425
4622697,5,B0059XTUB8,"I really enjoyed this movie. I am a huge Marilyn Monroe fan. I have been a fan since I was 12, and I am 20 now. I saw this movie weeks back with my mom at the mall in Spartanburg, SC. Anyway I was very impressed with Michelle's performance and potrayal of Marilyn Monroe. All of the movies based on her including Blonde, Marilyn Monroe the Untold Story, Norma Jean and Marilyn, this is by far the best and only good and decent movie that potrays Marilyn the way she deserves to be shown. I am so sick and tired and fed up with movies potraying her as a slut or a gorgeous blonde with no brains. Michelle really manages to shine in this movie as one of the most beloved Hollywood icons and legends of all time. She manages to show the gorgeous and beautiful woman and actress the public knows and the part behind that imagine that the public and the fans were kept from discovering: the fragile woman with a sensitive soul and a fear of being abandoned and alone. Michelle really did her research and had the courage to take on such a famous and Hollywood legend like Monroe to play in this film. I know quite a bit of Marilyn Monroe fans I know on facebook are disappointed not by her performance by the film itself: claming that the affair that happens between Marilyn and Colin Clark, the assistent director of the film ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" in which Marilyn starred along with probably the most respected and talented classical actors of all time, Laurence Olivier, isn't accurate or true. The film itself is based on the book,""My Week With Marilyn"" by Colin Clark himself. The film tells the story of making the prince and the showgirl and the tension between Monroe and Olivier doing the making of the film as well her one week innocent affair with Clark while her husband, Arthur Miller, is away in the USA visiting his children. After reading the book itself before the film was released in theaters and watching the documentary ""The Prince, the Showgirl, and Me'' told by Clark's point of view I believe the possibility of an affair did take place. Most of Marilyn's friends who are still alive today think it never actually happened while her co-star, Don Murray, from ""Bus Stop"" thinks it may have happened. I'm not saying that the affair is true or not. All I'm saying is I think it's a possibility. Afterall, Marilyn was under tremudlous pressure while filming ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" in England while she was stressed over her recent marriage to the famed and respected playwright, Miller. She was on edge due to Laurence's behavior and attitude toward her while directing the film as well as being her co-star and the tensions in her marriage especially after finding the diary left open by her husband saying he was disappointed in her and she wasn't the angel he thought he was marrying. I think she could have found comfort and solitude in Clark and felt he could be trusted. I was very touched and moved by Michelle's performance. At times I forgot it was Michelle who was on screen and thought it was Marilyn herself. ""All people ever see is Marilyn Monroe. When they find out I'm not her they run. Why is it that everyone I love leaves?"" Monroe confesses to Colin in a passionate scene from the film. Marilyn could have very well said that. It sounds very much like something Marilyn would have really said. Afterall she once said,""I want to be loved for myself and my talent."" She wasn't the typical movie star in real life. Marilyn Monroe was just a fanasty and an act she performed for the camera and the public. But it eventually became a burden. ""Fame stirs up envy."" And ""Fame is fickle,"" Marilyn Monroe once said herself. I was very pleased and excited that Michelle won the golden globe award herself for her performance in this film, an award in which Marilyn won 50 years ago. Michelle has never spoken cruel or disrespectful toward Marilyn ever in any of the interviews I've seen and always treated her with respect. She said,""She was a very complex person."" By her performance in this film you can see the Hollywood icon and legend and the real person she was in this film. I think that is the reason why I was very impressed with this film and loved it. I will definitely be buying it when it is released on DVD March 13, the day after my birthday. I was very impressed by everyone else's performance : Kenneth Branagh, Judi Dench, and Doughery Scott just to name a few. Kenneth mangages to do a wonderful and convincing potrayal of Laurnce Oliver and show him as the very talented actor he was as well as a vain and impatient man who had no patience with Marilyn's inability to remember her lines or deliver a perfect performance on camera on the 1st take or her obsession with the Method acting or her relibility on her drama coach, Paula Strasberg doing each take during filming. Michelle manages to show the insecure and lonely person Marilyn Monroe really was and well as her determination and dream to be taken seriously and become a dramatic actress. I rate this film 10 stars and will be watching this for a month when I finally get my hands on the DVD. Anyone who loves Marilyn Monroe and is a huge fan of hers like me should watch this film for Michelle's performance even if they are unsure of the accuracy of the film. They won't be disappointed. I wish I could see this film 2 or more times before it is released on DVD!!!! Go for it!! It would make a perfect gift for anyone who loves and is obsessed with this Hollywood icon. Definitely worth watching more then once and for years to come and to add to your Marilyn Monroe collection!!! :))",1327968000,3,5602,4.509341199606686
4622698,4,B0059XTUB8,"I finally caught up with this movie today.  I knew I would see a couple of excellent characterizations, but wasn't sure what to expect from the movie as a whole. I do have a soft spot for British settings, and loved the excellent of the cast, but what settled it for me was that I didn't want to break the spell when the movie ended.  Luckily, it was a small matinee audience, and I was there by myself, so was able to leave silently and drive home without noise or conversation. I can give this movie a strong 4+ rating for those who value excellent acting and a quiet but mesmerizing peek into storied lives.",1327881600,,610,4.2956521739130435
4622699,4,B0059XTUB8,"The protagonist, Eddie Redmayne plays Clark, his story is predictable. A well connected young British university student becomes the assistant assistant assistant director (a go-for) when Marilyn Monroe is in England shooting ""The Prince and the Showgirl"". He is assigned to follow around the difficult Marilyn and do her bidding. He falls head over heels, but maintains his distance like a medieval knight protecting the Queen.

Marilyn is the most popular actress in the world, but full of self doubt. She thinks she's a floozy only hired for her sex appeal.  She hires Lee Strasberg and his wife as an acting coach. (Far as I know, this really happened, or much of it).

Kenneth Branagh plays Sir Laurence Olivier, lead actor and director in ""Prince"", who has little patience with Marilyn's self-indulgent, druggy ways - full of booze and barbs - arriving hours late to the set. He assigns Clark.

The revelation here is Michelle Willliams as Marilyn. At times she sputters, plays Marilyn as a bit too withdrawn and too drugged, but when she connects, when she is firing on all cylinders, Williams is electrifying, you could swear you are seeing the real thing! Doing a little dance for photographers, playing with the smitten Clark.

It was an outstanding performance.  I am old enough to remember the ""real"" Marilyn Monroe"" and I must say that I felt that she really morphed the beauty and the sad essence of that tragic film star.

As far as the rest of the film went, however, I was less impressed.  Yes, the acting was good.  And yes, the story of the smitten young Englishman who worked on the set of ""the Prince and the Showgirl"" was heartwarming in his desire and his adoration.  And the theme of the film brought back a time and a place in history that has come and gone but is nice to remember.

However, once the concept of this movie was introduced, it got a little boring and there were really no surprises.  And, I must admit, that I actually fell asleep.

""My Week With Marilyn"" is not a perfect film.  However, it is well worth seeing.",1327536000,,983,4.316939890710382

4622734,2,B0059XTUB8,"I will try to keep it short and sweet! But will i be able to?
After all, we're talking about a movie telling the story of a famous and important shoot and film, and of a few major American and British Icons making it!
Let me start with:
This film is not apparently so bad,per se: it is simply another one of those UK period productions, backed also by some American money,rich of exquisite visuals,gorgeous sets,extraordinary gowns, some real interesting upcoming actors and accomplished Stars,and a lavish,if anonymous, direction with colors, good pacing,sex,humor,drama,and even a bit of mystery,to serve such a nostalgic mix. It reminds me actually of another UK,even slightly bigger budgeted, production,also with a huge cast like Julie Christie,Romola Garai,Eddy Redmayne,Jeremy Northam and Bill Nighy among others,""Glorious 39"". Well,that was, at least, trying hard to scare us with a fine Hitchcokian's plot and to present an unsettling twist,talking about 'appeasement' a subject matter,often way overlooked!
But this movie is sadly the triumph of superficiality!
I'd read the nostalgic, tragic book when it first came out(It feels yesterday but it was the late Spring of 1996!),never thought it was a masterpiece,yet maybe, one more way of digging into Monroe's endlessly moneymaking's source of Iconic stories.
But,at least,the novel was a real report of a conflict between 2 great actors: Monroe and Olivier,fighting horribly each other's on the set of the gracefully sophisticated comedy ""The Prince and the Showgirl""(1957)a very elegant and beautifully photographed(by another master: Jack Cardiff!!) Film,which had apparently a very sad shoot.
And at least, everyone felt real,even though,saying nothing new about the 2 great minds of these 2 great Icons,everyone was well depicted,and the shoot well remembered! It took almost 4 months to complete that film in London,and Warner Bros. was not too happy to hear that Monroe was often ill,or tragically lonely and unable to cope with reality,and go on with her acting job,while sir Olivier(who was also making a huge mistake by directing the lovely Terence Rattingan's play,instead of leaving that, to a more experienced comedic film director) was getting increasingly annoyed by his co-star,her rebellious streak, and her more vivid and natural way of acting(and photographing so exceptionally in any film,while not looking ""all that"" impressive on set: but that's film, and not Stage!).
Olivier apparently even tried to boycott her(but it may be gossip!),however,Marilyn,this time,and for the first time so much more than ever,was struggling a huge series of fears,and all by herself,trying desperately to please Olivier,the Studio,her manager and partner,Milton Greene(here just a cliche'role superficially played by Dominic Cooper)and even his, not so honest,but,super snob wife, Amy, who instead of being a friend to Monroe, soon became a judge(..and with which merits?)like feeling herself free to interfere with Monroe's performance. The Greene's had decided back in 1954,that MM was divine(too good of them!) ,but that 20th Century Fox(her well known main studio) was ruining her career! So, They convinced Monroe to strike against Fox, move to NYC,going to the Actor's Studio,along with Brando,Dean,Clift,Newman and so on, and changing her look into an absolutely very refined and more intellectual type of Blonde,photographed only by masters like Cecil Beaton and Richard Avedon,while asking for better pictures and bigger salaries! Not all of this was wrong,at all! And,in fact, her next picture became the best Monroe's film ever,the lovely,touching ""Bus Stop""(1956),presenting Monroe,just gorgeous but with a whole new depth and Look! However all of this in a ""A Week with Marilyn""(And,why a week? More like 17 weeks!!lol)becomes so superficially bland that The Inquire by comparison, may be,all of a sudden,a very profound publication,as well.
Marilyn was also trying to 'proof' herself with that film, to her new radical activist and greatest intellectual play writer Arthur Miller,whom she'd just married,leaving the World, completely confused. And,by admiring Olivier's wife,was trying to pleasing her also,and we're talking of course,about 'that Vivien Leigh',from ""Gone with the Wind"" lol also another tragic character, and alone wife of Olivier,which befriended somewhat Amy Greene,starting to looking down at Monroe and at her natural talent,like a too easy short cut for becoming such a superstar! And,while Monroe's NYC Actor's Studio faithful coaches(Paula and Lee Strasberg) were also for a while in London, trying to help Marilyn out,were seemingly instead,only there to be truly creating even more tensions and more tensions with Olivier who just loathed the 'Method'.
What a situation,uh? It might be as well the outline for a novel by Scott Fitzgerald or at least, from Edith Wharton,or David Leavitt,but this film takes on all the most shallow, predictable cliches,degrading (sorry but it really does!) some of the most important and most unforgettable Icons of the 20th Century,with suc a light script,way too light,way too 'insensitive' and lacking any depth for such material!
It miscasts Dominic Cooper,Wanamaker(as Paula Strasberg),Dougray Scott(as a laughable Miller!)Ormond as Leigh (C'mon!) and even Kenneth Branagh,who seems to have a hard time in playing what he normally plays best: Olivier! The only good scenes are those with Judy Dench(playing cordial supporting fellow actress Sybil Thorndike,a real Queen of the London's stage, who'd played the Queen Dowager in""The Prince and the showgirl"" a true gem then.. and now!) and the excellent and handsome Eddy Redmayne(the real lead) becoming more infatuated and more infatuated with Monroe's presence and loneliness,while she seems here to leading him on.
And,now,Let me just say: Sorry, Michelle Williams!
I loved her in a few things..like the betrayed housewife in ""Brokeback Mountain""or as the desperate working class woman in last year's splendid ""Blue Valentine"",where she was brave and strong,and real,
but she has just not the beauty necessary,nor the sensibility and finesse of one of the most emblematic and mysteriously tragic Icons of the 20th Century,who happens also to be,by the way,one of the most recognizable Faces on this Planet,even today!
What else to say?It's annoying because Williams not only is terribly miscast,and not sexy,not attractive (Hey, Does anyone remember Marilyn's fantastic,formidable,unique posture??)but what bothers especially is that she does not even try to be looking fragile here,but just a spoiled,often drunk movie star,living through this empty plot by almost giving the impression to be vile and arrogant!
I cannot forgive Williams for having NOT, at least,tried, to understand Monroe(it is always clear that she's miles away from the real Marilyn and her pain, But she is number 1 in accomplishing, and for the first time ever, a true dehumanization of one of the most moving American Tragedies,by acting always so unavailable to portray a personal anguish,pain and distress,which is truly all too bad,considering also that the strong make up effects and perfect reconstruction of some of Monroe's classic gowns are so out of place on Williams, to make her look,at times,just seriously laughable!)And so, while the film goes literally nowhere,dragging from a cliche' to the next,sadly creating some of the most ridiculous Portraits of famous Icons ever seen on East or West, to becoming just a sad,missed occasion for,at least, giving a more honest,more decent motion picture about one of the most gorgeous,tormented Ladies in Films and History,but just revealing instead little interest,and picking up like when it creates some time for hot Redmayne, to become something like the hot young idealistic stud trying to defend the poor 'Beauty' from the backstabbers,but, only because attracted and led on, even sexually, by her! This was not in the Book, at all! And it's in bad taste!
The two were always very distant, and barely exchanged a few words!!!
A simply ridiculous turn out,almost offensive, and,Williams,please,choose your roles with sense,as you've done so far... Marilyn is way out of your league: and it shows painfully!
So this may be one of those cases where a decently filmed movie is so wrong and vile to becoming a terribly dreadful movie, that I would like not to be watched by anyone, especially by those not aware of the Truth, like younger audiences,who should have been given, instead,a way more real,moral and much more different portrait of someone like Monroe, and her struggles,her people and her Times... Those were not Paris Hilton or Kardashian's Years, those were times were People still had high Ideals and Principles,and,when, Struggling for Fame, meant struggling for Art and Respect!",1325548800,9,8822,5.45900439238653
4622735,4,B0059XTUB8,"""My Week With Marilyn"" gives us a glimpse into a world we can only imagine, shared with people we only know as legends, through the eyes of a young man who knew he didn't belong but desperately wanted to and, through pluck and luck, found himself hobnobbing with cinema's elite. The film cannily establishes this young man as our sympathetic and amusing hero before granting us entree into the world of his and our dreams. The light humor remains through the film but parts occasionally to let us experience the heartbreaking insecurity and desperation of one of cinemas most revered stars as well as the devastation that fell on those she touched.

Michelle Williams' portrayal of Marilyn is a wonder.",1325203200,,702,4.85
4622736,4,B0059XTUB8,"Marilyn Monroe was and still is a bit of a mystery.  In her heyday, she was considered by most to be just a glamorized sexpot used as eye candy in most of her films.  A look back generally shows she had significant acting talent, especially in the right roles.  As this film adaptation of Colin Clark's memoir indicates, Marilyn also comes with a lot of baggage.  Director Simon Curtis personalizes Monroe's struggles with confidence, older men and pills.

The film is set in 1956 England where Laurence Olivier (a wonderful Kenneth Branaugh) is starring and directing ""The Prince and the Showgirl."" Monroe (Michelle Williams), then one of the most recognizable people on the planet, finally arrives and drives everyone on the set crazy.  And we're wondering if she doesn't have a bit of crazy in her as well.  Some of these early scenes seem to drag a bit.  OK, we get it.  But I think, it does put Monroe in bad light and I suspect that is the idea.  Then Michelle Williams really goes to work.  Her ultimate relationship with Clark (Eddie Redmayne) brings out the real Monroe.  She was neglected if not abused as a child.  She didn't know her father, but all of her squires have been older men.  Now she meets a 23 year old (""almost 24"" Clark insists) gofer on a movie set.  Monroe is 30 at the time.  After a tender kiss, she says ""I've never kissed anyone younger than me.""

Williams once again proves her acting chops in a stellar, award-worthy performance.  Her Monroe is vulnerable, needy and wants to truly be loved.  She wants a ""normal"" life and wants to have children.  These are not the same desires of her new husband, writer Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott) or any of her other previous mates.  As Clark had been warned by her former beau and agent Milton Greene (Dominic Cooper), Monroe is a heartbreaker.  But with Williams's performance, damn if I wasn't falling in love at the same time Clark was.  I just don't know if it was with Marilyn Monroe or Michelle Williams.

This Blu ray is beautifully done, consistent with the fine film version.  It is presented in 1080p with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, nearly identical to the original release.  Low light details are well done.  Flesh tones are perfect.  The DTS-HD MA 5.1 is exemplary as well projecting the music properly as well as low volume speech.",1325116800,3,2314,4.6330049261083746
4622737,3,B0059XTUB8,"It has a certain surface charm to it, particularly if you're interested in old movies and movie stars. But like Marilyn Monroe herself, My Week With Marilyn isn't that deep or that interesting. Nor is Michelle Williams's performance something to write home about. She's not embarrassing or inept, just unaffecting. She merely rustles up images of the real thing, who, we're reminded, was actually dull. Her inner circle may have sucked up to her like she was a brilliantly innovative and intellectual devotee to the craft of acting, but the bottom line is that people were fascinated with Monroe because they wanted to have sex with her or because they wanted to be like her, and that was why she was famous and adored (and hated, too, I imagine). The film offers up the classic ""I'm-beautiful-so-no-one-thinks-I-can-act"" portrait of Marilyn but declines to comment on it. This movie tries to make an awards grab without any fingers...

4622738,4,B0059XTUB8,"Michelle Williams paints a soul-deep portrait of a Hollywood goddess addicted to pills, alcohol, fame, and a little girl's notion of love, but Ken Branagh's Olivier also seems channelled from the Great Beyond. That rat-a-tat voice! Those serpentine eyes! That tight-lipped civility! Like Williams, Branagh offers us not an imitation but an incarnation.

Electrifying onstage, Olivier knew that the new generation of film stars had a mystical relationship with the camera that eluded him. In ""My Week with Marilyn"" even Sir Larry grumblingly admits that when she's ""on,"" Monroe lights up the screen in a way that he, for all his experience and technical training, never could. The film sent me home to watch ""Prince and the Showgirl"" on DVD, and yes! While Olivier seemed wooden and ""dead behind the eyes,"" MM was radiantly, effortlessly funny. Whether Colin Clark's intimate encounter with MM is truth or wishful fabrication hardly matters--I left ""My Week with Marilyn"" feeling greater respect for the abilities of Miss Monroe, the legacy of Lord Olivier, and the artistry of both stars portraying them.",1324339200,3,1104,5.237288135593221
4622739,5,B0059XTUB8,"First off, I'm a movie lover, but not really much of a critic.  My critiques of films rely almost solely upon how entertained I was.  I believe I have an eye for what is good on-screen, although I can't really pick things apart to discern if a thing was off, such as the direction.  That being said, I could not have been more captivated watching Michelle Williams portrayal of the different facets of the iconic Marilyn Monroe.  It's not really that she looks like her--I don't really think that she does--but more that she embodies the role with such grace and nuance as to shed light on Marilyn's evolving personalities so unselfconsciously that one suspends disbelief while watching her play the seductive temptress, the insecure woman-child, and the lonely and lost soul who's reaching out for anyone or anything that might save her.  She does all this with humor, candor, honesty, and most importantly, immense compassion and empathy for her subject.  Michelle's performance made me look again at Marilyn, an endeavor I started with the stunning release last year of the collection of her writings, ""Fragments"".

The supporting cast here is amazing.  Kenneth Branagh as Olivier is a revelation.  Again, I could not have imagined him in that role, but he is absolute perfection as Olivier.  Judi Dench brings her usual emotional weight and sweetness to her portrayal of Dame Sybil Thorndike, and Eddie Redmayne is pitch perfect as the besotted Colin, who wrote the book detailing his time with MM.

I cannot say enough good about this movie.  For people fascinated with movies, Marilyn, or just the trappings of the human heart, this movie is a wonder.  Michelle Williams is the main reason.  I found that, as with Monroe, one's eyes stay glued to her in every frame in which she appears--in fact, I actually missed her when she was not on the screen.  She gives a star-making performance that may well garner her the Oscar, in my estimation.  It will certainly be a game changer for her pick of roles...she'll never be seen the same way again after the due she's paid Marilyn in this wonderful treat of a movie.",1324080000,13,2117,4.806629834254144

8463048,5,B0059XTUB8,"Simon Curtis directs his magnum opus with his 2011 movie My Week with Marilyn. Curtis captures the most beautiful lighting in his excellent cinematic shots. Curtis' cinematography is compelling all the way into this sweet drama. Lovely scenes set up with care give way to powerful performances in this emotional biopic of an older Marilyn Monroe.

Michelle Williams is the real star of My Week with Marilyn. Williams portrays Marilyn Monroe with a seductive charm as well as a curious sadness. Williams perfectly expresses the emotional insecurity that Monroe suffered from with a respectful take on her drug addiction. Monroe's mood swings and depression couple together nicely with her joyless marriage. Williams plays Monroe's flirtatious movie star with a delicate innocence and a playful wonder. She always has this sweetness as Marilyn that draws you in deeper. She really is the spitting image of Marilyn Monroe and nails her dainty whisper voice that Monroe always sported. Michelle Williams gets you to fall in love with Marilyn Monroe, while simultaneously empathizing with her unhappiness. Michelle Williams is a delight!

Kenneth Branagh is superb as Sir Laurence Olivier. He gets Olivier's fervor for plays and serious acting as well as his frustration with Marilyn's inability to act. Branagh is so believable as the dramatic lead actor that just wants to make great films. You see how uncomfortable Marilyn makes him. Branagh is also very funny as the disgruntled legendary actor that must cope deal with the perpetually late, drugged up, incompetent, and inconsistent actress that was Marilyn Monroe. Kenneth Branagh has many moments of clarity that break through to you wherein you see his passion for acting and film making. It's an incredible supporting role from Branagh.

Finally, Eddie Redmayne is the new guy in Hollywood that is equally dazzled by the glamour of movie making and the charms of Marilyn Monroe. He matches his character arc with an eagerness to help make movie magic, then he must experience heartbreak to mature. It's a nice character portrait of a young man of the times. I liked Redmayne in My Week with Marilyn quite a bit.

Watch My Week with Marilyn for a heartbreaking look behind the screen Marilyn, behind the scenes of movie production, and a great many laughs at the ridiculousness of it all. Michelle Williams solidifies her place in movie history with her beautifully subtle depiction of Marilyn Monroe's emotional pain. My Week with Marilyn is one of the most nuanced films about a hurt Hollywood legend.",1523664000,,2557,5.124700239808154

8463050,2,B0059XTUB8,"First off, my rating isn't a verdict against the movie.. Michelle Williams truly, shines in her portrayal of Marilyn.  Instead this advertised Blu Ray movie bears no resemblance to what I received.  Instead of Blu Ray + DVD, there was only one disc.  Although that singular disc was identified as Blu Ray, the poor color saturation and grainy picture was equal to a poor quality DVD, and possessed no qualities even close to a good DVD, let alone sharpness and clarity a person expects from Blu Ray.  Although Blu Ray versions of this movie are supposed to be released in 5.1 DTS audio, sound quality of this movie was muddled and possibly equal to someone might expect from a lower-priced DVD.

In-short, this is one of my all time favorite movies and one I would not hesitate to recommend, both for its enchanting story line, as well as supurb acting and the film's ability to capture the essence of an era unlike any other film, before or since.  This makes it all the more painful that a copy so poorly executed could lower the quality of such a stunning film.  As a result, I returned this movie, and purchased a later (2012) two-disc release of this movie, with a gold banner at the top, identifying the Academy Awards attributed to ""My Week with Marilyn"".  That version is in 1080p resolution Wide Screen  Blu Ray, with 5.1 DTS Surround Sound, and includes the second DVD disc.  It is worth looking for this video, since it is not much more expensive, and a far better value than this version.",1520985600,,1500,4.584269662921348
