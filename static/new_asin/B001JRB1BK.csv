The best part is that it is so interesting and can be listened to again and again and always hear something new and exciting. What a group of music people to propel these harmonies.",1235433600,,269,4.869565217391305
3659619,5,B001JRB1BK,"Okay, I am a huge Brian Wilson fan in any case.  But this is his best effort since his peak back in the sixties.  The more I listen to it, the more I like it.

This album is a must for any hardcore BDW (or Beach Boys) fan.  For others it might not be their thing, and the autobiographical pieces will not be understood.  But for the true Wilson fan, this is a phenomenal album.

Definitely 5 stars.",1235260800,3,398,4.038461538461538

3659621,5,B001JRB1BK,"As a huge fan of the Beach Boys, Brian and the TLOS album, I was destined to like this dvd.  For me personally, the bonus features are the best part of the dvd, though - particularly the Yahoo set and the Black Cab Session.

I was very disappointed in the way the producers decided to present the actual TLOS ""concert"".  First off, the performance was in front of a very small audience at Capitol Records.  Although the crowd was enthusiastic, the actual concert I saw in November at the Ryman in Nashville was much more energetic and I'm not sure this dvd fully captures that energy.  Secondly, the vocals on the dvd are, to my ear, over-produced.  There is far more effect on Brian's vocals on the dvd than on the studio album and it contributes to making the dvd sound more like a studio recording than a live concert.  Additionally, Brian's vocals are so heavily overdubbed that at times it looks like he's lip-synching to a record.  Overdubbing the occasional bad note is one thing.  Completely re-recording and replacing the vocal performance that accompanied the video, on the other hand is something altogether different.  My personal preference is for music dvd's to contain the actual performance that was heard by the audience - mistakes and all.  The occasional off-pitch notes are like flaws in fine leather in that they verify the authenticity of the product.  Brian was in such fine voice on the TLOS tour that the overdubbing was, in my opinion, unnecessary and more of a distraction than an improvement.

Don't take my observations as suggestions that the dvd is not worthwhile, though, because TLOS is a moving, finely crafted work and the dvd is a treasure for fans of Brian Wilson.  I thoroughly enjoyed the dvd and highly recommend it to others as well.",1233792000,4,1774,4.736156351791531
3659622,5,B001JRB1BK,"Brian Wilson shows us once again why he is regarded as one of the best writers and performers by musicians and fans alike. This highly anticipated DVD was well worth the wait. The DVD itself is high quality, with superior picture and sound. Each track from the Lucky Old Sun CD is played in order. I purchased the CD when it was originally released several months ago, and have listened to it many times. Watching Brian and his spectacular Band, which Brian has molded together over the past 15 years, play each track to perfection, is a experience we rarely get to enjoy in todays musical climate. As a bonus, one of the extras on this DVD is another high quality recording of Brian and his band performing several live tracks including a few Beach Boys numbers. This DVD also includes a track by track commentary by Brian and Scott Bennett, giving us insight into the inspiration behind the music on Lucky Old Sun. A great DVD.",1233273600,10,929,4.568862275449102
3659623,5,B001JRB1BK,"Another masterpiece from the architect of the California Dream, Brian Wilson!  I just watched it for the first time and was completely blown away!  This ranks at least as good as the Pet Sounds and Smile DVD's released before it.  Although the ""live"" performance of the complete album was obviously overdubbed to sweeten it,it still works for me.  I mean, what other artist besides Brian and his band will perform an entire album for the fans?  As a native Northern Californian, I can relate to the feeling this album produces on several different levels but the DVD really brings it home to me.  Brian continues to do with his current band what he did with the Beach Boys years earlier except without all the hassles and headaches his family I'm sure gave him.  This disc is really packed full of extras along with the documentary and performance and is well worth every penny.  This is a must have item if you are a Beach Boys fan, a Brian Wilson fan, or a fan of music, period!",1233100800,2,980,4.528409090909091
3659624,5,B001JRB1BK,"Hi...I was lucky enough to see Brian tonight at the GRAMMY museum and they sold these early and Brian signed them for us...after a Q&A and a short acoustic performance that was perfection!
This is a terrific value...the performance of the new album at  Capitol Studios is only one of many interesting elements. the hour long documentary is certainly nice as is the 25 minute making of the album feature. The half hour Nissan Live set and Q&A is maybe the highlight for me featuring many great performances and some fun Q&A....
this is seriously a few hours of fun fun fun!!!

PS...Brian said the favorite song he's written was ""God Only Knows"" and his favorite recording was ""California Girls"". He also answered the Desert Island question by an audience member as to who's records he would want if stranded forever with ...The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and The Bee Gees!",1231977600,5,873,4.774834437086093

8313646,5,B001JRB1BK,"Watching Brian's magnificent band perform this suite of songs before a live studio audience is a joy.

The behind-the-scenes studio footage is priceless.  His conversation with Zooey Deschanel is very sweet.

I LOVE this dvd.",1411344000,,225,5.371428571428571
8313647,5,B001JRB1BK,"I was lucky enough to see the live debut of this album at the Royal Festival Hall in London.  It blew me away.  Brian Wilson has done it again.  ""Midnight's Another Day"" and ""Forever She'll Be My Surfer Girl"" are among the best work he has ever done.  This is a work of art that should not be missed.",1391385600,,300,4.033898305084746
8313648,5,B001JRB1BK,"This is a great offering from the greatest musician of all time, BRIAN WILSON.  This album paints a beautiful and enjoable picture of California and life in general.  The final song, ""Southern California"", is a tearful and beautiful tribute to Brian's music and and the California dream.",1390262400,,287,5.085106382978723
8313649,5,B001JRB1BK,"I have had the CD for ""That Lucky Old Sun"" ever since it came out and the music has really grown on me. I think, considering his life and his personal difficulties, that its amazing Brian continues to write such fantastic music. So I purchased this DVD and was pleasantly surprised by the live performance and mostly the Documentary and behind-the-scenes footage of Brian and his band in the studio.

If you're a fan of Brian and/or the ""That Lucky Old Sun"" album, this is definitely worth the money.",1272153600,2,500,4.617977528089888
8313650,5,B001JRB1BK,Brian and his band are as good as ever.  I saw this concert live in New York while he was on tour.  This DVD captures the essence of the live performance.  What a memory for the concert. A Modern day mini opus to Los Angeles!,1252713600,,225,3.9555555555555557

8313652,5,B001JRB1BK,"I recently ordered the DVD, ""That Lucky Old Sun"" by Brian Wilson. This DVD was outstanding. The music was great, the concert footage was great, the documentary was great, the performances were great, and the whole thing was very interesting. I would highly recommend this DVD for any Brian Wilson fan or Beach Boys fan. Though the years have slowed him, Brian is still a major talent and force in the music world. ""That Lucky Old Sun"" DVD is a home run for Brian.",1238976000,7,463,4.523809523809524
8313653,5,B001JRB1BK,"AFTER SEVERAL PLAYS DAYS APART, I FIND THE BEAUTY OF THIS CD/DVD. THIS IS GOOD STUFF AND NOT TO BE MISSED BY ANYONE. THIS IS NEW STUFF AND NEW DIRECTION. BRIAN CONTINUES TO MOVE HIS LEGACY FORWARD AND WE ALL SHOULD BE THANKFUL FOR HIS CONTINUING MUSIC MAKING SKILLS!",1237161600,4,266,4.448979591836735
8313654,5,B001JRB1BK,"Although Brian Wilson's previous live DVDs of ""Pet Sounds"" and ""Smile"" in their entireties are marvelous, in some ways ""That Lucky Old Sun"" is the most remarkable of all. It's one thing -- and quite a good thing at that -- for him to re-create some of his greatest music some 35-40 years after it was written with the invaluable assistance of one of the finest backup bands in the history of popular music. But it's quite another for him to produce brand-new music of such unexpectedly superb quality. Not only are the melodies and arrangements first-rate, but toward the end it becomes some of the most emotionally naked music he's ever recorded. The one flaw in ""That Lucky Old Sun"" is that, after a strong start, it drags a bit toward the middle, with ""Mexican Girl"" in particular not living up to the rest of the suite. But that's a minor quibble, especially since the best material of all is in the final third. If you're a Brian Wilson and/or Beach Boys fan, this is essential viewing. And even if you're not, you just might find it a real eye-opener. If you'll excuse the pun, I consider myself one ""lucky old son"" to own this DVD!",1235952000,3,1138,4.502415458937198
