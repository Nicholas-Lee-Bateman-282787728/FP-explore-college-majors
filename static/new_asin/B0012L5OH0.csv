8246645,4,B0012L5OH0,"This DVD was very interesting and informative for non-Jewish viewers like me.  For many years I have been interested in the Jewish religion and way of life and this was a good way to get my feet wet.  I've watched it several times now, which has sparked my curiosity to find out more.  As I've stated, this is a good start - but there is much more that could have been done to make this type of presentation an excellent presentation.",1240876800,,434,4.333333333333333
