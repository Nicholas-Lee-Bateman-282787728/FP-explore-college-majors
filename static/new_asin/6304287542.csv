8280787,5,6304287542,Heroes of Shaolin is one of the best kung fu movies nobody has seen ... i don't remember the other movies...but they weren't as good..but if you can find the set cheap its worth it... i want it on dvd,1132790400,,200,4.025
8280788,1,6304287542,"As far as the movies go, Heroes of Shaolin is a descent kung fu flick! The other Four Shaolin challengers is the worst kung fu film ever made! The fight choreography for 4 Shaolin was gay! It looks like a 5 five year choregraphed the fights! Heroes has some great fights choreography by Yuen Biao and Cory Yuen! But if anything, don't get this product! The picture is really bad and there are problems with tracking! Get the Venom Mob version of Heroes of Shaolin (which is actually called Heroes of the Wild) with better picture and you don't have to see the death of a baby wolf!",1110758400,,581,4.388888888888889
