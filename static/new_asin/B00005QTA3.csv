1650858,3,B00005QTA3,"I am a big Shirley Temple fan. So I just had to buy this and add it to my collection. I watched this movie and I thought that
Ashley Rose Orr did a wonderful job in playing Shirley. Nobody can take Shirley Temple so keep that in mind. The only thing in the movie that I didn't like is the ending. I thought that it was tacky that the Producer Melisa Joan Hart would have her little sister Emily play the teen age role of Shirley Temple. I don't think that her sister resembled the teenage Shirley in my mind. The ending just stunk. It left you hanging. I would of like it if it covered all the way to the end of her acting years as an adult. Instead it focus way to much on her childhood.",1010793600,6,688,3.9927536231884058
1650859,3,B00005QTA3,"I would say that my main criticism of this film is that the child who played Shirley was too old for the part.  The child was very good. She even has a better voice than Shirley has.  She faithfully recreated some difficult dance numbers.  My favorite being the one from Captain January.  It is unfair to expect one child to play another child between the ages of 5 and 12.  Also, if you read the book, you will note that things were not always quite so wonderful for young Shirley.  The movie came to an abrupt end after only 90 minutes.  It never went into the fact that her family mismanaged her money. The child is very talented that played Shirley.  It was an overwhleming task to play a living legend.",1010275200,4,707,4.343511450381679
1650860,5,B00005QTA3,"This was one of the most diffuclut tasks ,I believe because getting someone who could even match a glimpse up to Shirley had to be a task too hard to handle. I didn't see and big historical innaccuracies but like when she put her feet onto the Graumanns theater she didn't smile really because she had just lost a tooth and little things like that. I liked how they did this but I really wished they had showed more of her just being herself and the hard things and sad things like I really enjoyed her scene from Now and Forever where she had trouble with the crying because I could just imagine,and when Amelia Earhart died I started crying myself,one of the most tragic things is when she didn't get the part of Dorothy and when she said she didn't care but she really did and ended up basicaly crying herself to sleep. The life of Shirley Temple was very hard and wasn't all ""Lollipops and Apple Pies all rolled into 1!"" (Line from : Baby Take a Bow) but it was one heck of a ride and IT would be the experience of a lifetime and this movie shows you a little what it was like!",1009843200,3,1081,4.201923076923077
1650861,5,B00005QTA3,"Great movie! Very accurate, well-made, and entertaining for anyone who wishes to relive those adorable Shirley Temple days from when she was young. Ashley Rose Orr does a great acting job here, although I don't think she looked much like the real Shirley Temple. Sure, she had those same dimples and the curls, but I didn't see as much of a resemblance as I thought I would. But that doesn't matter, because it's Ashley Rose Orr's energy and adorable smile that made her believable as Shirley Temple, the little girl who stole the hearts of people worldwide during the Great Depression. The song and dance numbers were performed extremely well by Orr, and she was well supported by Connie Britton and Colin Friels, who portrayed Shirley's parents in the movie. I just found this to be a really sweet movie which gives viewers a good background on Shirley's younger life in the moviemaking business. Like Cherie Hapney, I'm also disappointed that Shirley Temple didn't get the part of Dorothy in ""The Wizard of Oz,"" although Judy Garland did play the part well. But we're not talking about Judy Garland here, we're talking about Shirley Temple. And I definitely recommend this autobiographical account on the talented young woman's life from ages 5 to 12.",1009065600,5,1254,4.892018779342723
1650862,2,B00005QTA3,"This movie was awful! Ashley Rose Orr, while a talented tap dancer, and singer (actually a little better than Temple was in terms of the latter), is a terrible actress. She plays the character as the Shirley that we saw on screen in her movies whether she's playing her on screen or off screen persona. So what we get is an overly cutesy, and wholly unrealistic (not to mention uninteresting) portrait. If one wants to see that side of her, one can just watch one of her movies. The only bright light here is Connie Britton's portrayal of Gertrude Temple. I don't think it was terribly realistic, but at least it was well acted. The Poor Little Rich Girl is definitely a better investment.",1008633600,2,689,4.564516129032258
1650863,5,B00005QTA3,"I loved this movie! It was a great remake of a classic life, and many people agree there was only one thing wrong with the movie in that it was too short!
Ashley Rose Orr is beautiful and talented and she deserves an oscar for portraying Shirley in this role.
The only thing that REALLY counts is that the story was told and it was ACCURATE.
Thanks",1007510400,,348,4.208955223880597

1650947,4,B00005QTA3,"One is struck by the high technical quality of this made-for-TV (?) light drama.  Costumes, sets, sound, casting, etc., are of super high quality typical of Disney.  One can't expect deep character development, I suppose, but one is left asking if there was more to Shirley Temple than the superficial.  Maybe not.  Very interesting are the bonus features.  Shirley's life was not without it's little dramas, but we have to ask ourselves if she was really this ""perfect"" in real life as on screen.  Or, is it the content of the movie the result of the ""Disney filter.""  In any event, this movie is highly entertaining and only slightly revealing of the ""real"" Shirley.  Will we ever know?  Was she perfect or was the perfect image created by the movie studio?  This movie doesn't answer any questions but provides solid, though superficial and fluffy entertainment.",1369440000,,865,4.903448275862069
1650948,5,B00005QTA3,"I taped this movie off the air when it originally aired on ABC-TV in 2001, and I'm glad I was able to find it on DVD.  Based on Shirley Temple Black's autobiography&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Child-Star/dp/B000LAXJKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Child Star</a>&nbsp;(Black was also a consultant on the film), and co-executive-produced by Melissa Joan Hart of TV's SABRINA, THE TEENAGE WITCH, this film is a lovely tribute to Shirley, with newcomer Ashley Rose Orr magnificent in the title role.  Emily Hart, Melissa's sister, plays the older Shirley in later scenes.  Hinton Battle does a magnificent job as legendary tapper Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson, and choreographed the entire movie, reproducing the dance numbers perfectly (almost identically, in fact, to the originals from Shirley's movies).  The DVD contains audio commentary from Melissa Joan Hart, a ""making-of"" mini-doc, and English, French, and Spanish subtitles.

I hope that 20th-Century Fox Home Entertainment corrects this oversight soon.

Had Shirley Temple remained in musical comedy as an adult, she probably would have challenged Ann Miller and Eleanor Powell for Hollywood's Queen of Tap Dancing; she was that good, even as a child.  Her later dramatic films didn't work, and it was probably fortunate that she gave up show business and had a happy ""second life"" with second husband Charles Black, who passed away in 2005.  Shirley ably served her country as a diplomat and ambassador, became a mother and grandmother, and received a well-deserved Kennedy Center Honor in 1998.  Given the tragic fate of so many other child stars who battled drug abuse, alcoholism, and depression, and, in some cases, eventually passed away - think of the late Gary Coleman and Dana Plato for starters - Shirley Temple Black made the right choice. Her long, wonderful life finally ended on February 10, 2014, when she passed away in her California home at age 85, two months before her 86th birthday.

God bless you, Ambassador Shirley Temple Black - we love you! R.I.P., dear Shirley...",1361577600,4,4084,7.966960352422907

1650950,5,B00005QTA3,"This is the best re-make of someones life that I have ever seen.  The little actress, who took you through Shirley's young life was absolutely awesome.  She nailed Shirley's voice, the pout on her face was remarkable and her dancing was incredible.",1344384000,,248,4.880952380952381

1651002,4,B00005QTA3,"Child Star - The Shirley Temple Story is a wonderful biography of America's favorite kid actress. Although not perfect, it remains one of my favorites due to the subject matter.

Ashley Rose Orr was a bit long in the tooth to play Shirley at some points of the story, but it was generally believable. The period costumes also added a great deal to the authenticity.

If you are a Shirley fan, this DVD belongs in your collection, right next to your real Shirley movies.",1202860800,2,469,4.571428571428571
1651003,4,B00005QTA3,"The fact of the matter is they searched over 10,000 girls before casting Ashley in the lead role as the young Shirley, this had to be a very tough role to cast, think about it, how many girls between the ages of 6 and 11 could do it, first of all the girl had to at least look similar to Shirley, next she had to be able to do hard dance steps (especially tap) then she had to be able to sing, and last of all she had to have the IQ to be able to act the part of Shirley and have similar speech and mannerisms, Well Ashley hit on all counts in my book and I have been a fan of Shirleys since I was a child (i am 49 now) the movie itself I thought was very well done and the acting by most of the rest of the cast was also excellent (the girl who played the older Shirley in the last few minutes of the movie was beautiful but her acting was not the best, however she was not all that bad, overall this was an enjoyable movie that I believe any fan of Shirley Temple will enjoy.",1164931200,2,977,3.8177339901477834
1651004,1,B00005QTA3,"When this movie was first played on TV, I was so excited because I have been a major Shirley fan since I was 9(I'm now 21) but when I was watched I was highly dissapointed. The story is supposed to be based on Shirley Temple Black's autobiography ""Child Star"" and I only saw a handful of items that were actually taken from the book, the rest of it was just fluff. Plus they didn't go past Shirley's early teens when the book covers up until after she marries her second husband. They seemed to only want to focus on the happy aspects of Shirley's life but she and her family were not always so happy go lucky. Ashley Orr is horrific at playing Shirley-first of all she's too old to play 5,6,7 and even 8 year old Shirley and she was too sticky sweet, I know Shirley was too but not that sweet. I would have actually given this movie 0 stars if I had the option, it was horrible. So if you want to know the real story find her book ""Child Star"" and if you want to see the real Shirley work her magic on the screen go find any of her movies and stay away from this one.

""Bright eyes"" , ""Heidi"" , and ""Poor Little Rich Girl"" are good movies to start off with.",1109376000,15,1158,4.078947368421052
1651005,3,B00005QTA3,"Based on her autobiography, Child Star tells the story of the fame of Shirley Temple, perhaps the most loved child star of all time. The movie does a good job of setting the time period, the depression by using newsreel footage and radio broadcasts. Many of her most famous routines are faithfully recreated, sometimes as clips from the movies, other times as if they were filming the movie.

The acting is good. Ashley Rose Orr ""sparkles"" as Shirley (Shirley's mother always told her to ""sparkle""). It's tough recreating a living legend, but she can sing and dance and act quite well, although she did say ""Oh, my goodness"" a bit too many times. Connie Britton is good as Shirley's mother, although Colin Friel is bland as her father. A standout is Hinton Battle as Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson.

Shirley Temple fans will enjoy this movie. She's one of those rare child stars who seems well-adjusted, so there's nothing really controversial in the film. Anything that is controversial, such as Shirley's father spending almost all her money, is sugar-coated, perhaps because Shirley was a consultant on the movie. Unfortunately, the movie veers off course in the end by showing Shirley as a teenager. A much better ending would have been her leaving the 20th Century Fox studios when they terminated her contract.

DVD extras include an audio commentary by Melissa Joan Hart, who produced the movie along with her mother, and an interesting feature on the making of the movie.",1107734400,7,1474,4.935483870967742
1651006,2,B00005QTA3,"I own the movie for the simple fact, that I am a huge Shirley Temple and since the movie is featured on Shirley's book I can imagine Shirley growing up on set.

But, the cast does a horrible job acting-- the show plays out like an melodramatic elementary school play. Ashley Orr the little girl who was in Annie Get Your Gun and The Sound of Music- does a horrible job as Shirley-- there is no magic or suddle acting with her- she's meant for stage not film. Ashley also looks too old for the part as well- an ten year playing someone who is suppose to be five or six is bound not to work. Some people have said that she looks like Shirley and there is NO resemblance what so ever and there is no magic when you watch her on screen. They should have spent more time searching for America's little sweetheart instead of Orr. But, of course there will never be another Temple. Shirley's mom dosn't do a good job either and most of the actors seem like they need to be on prozac.

All in all it's a good biography for fans but, a horrible movie.",1106697600,7,1042,4.17910447761194

What kept me interested were the dance numbers.  There wasn't very much information about her fame and life. All they really covered was how her contract changed from time to time how Fox changed to 20th Century Fox and that she didn't get Dorothy in Wizard of Oz (which im so glad she didn't b/c it would have just been aother Shirley Movie nothing big) otherwise. Ashley acts nothing like shirley would have acted off screne, looks nothing like her, sounds nothing like her, and why is a 10 year old playing a 5 year old?",1089590400,5,664,4.533333333333333

Plus, Ashley Orr did a terrable job as Shirley! Shirley had a differant, yet very cute, voice, which ashley does not have, and by trying to copy Shirley's voice she made it worse! If you want to know more about Shirley, then read Child Star, by Shirley Temple; Shirley Temple American Princess, by Anne Edwards; Or watch one of the real Shirley Temple movies.

The girl who plays Shirley Temple doesn't really look like her at all, to be honest. She tries WAY too hard to be cute (and she succeeds). I haven't spotted any inaccuracies so far, except for the crew singing for her and giving her a birthday cake (that part was added to the script just to show viewers how close Shirley and the crew were). The songs and dances are very enjoyable. But the DVD edition has very few bonuses, although they're really good. The commentary by Melissa Joan Hart (TV's Sabrina) points out a lot of things that aren't shown in the movie, and there are interviews with the whole cast. Still, they could have had other things like a photo album, some song tracks of the real Shirley, an interview with Shirley, and other cool things.

I have watched this 15 times since this movie came out and I am not even sick of it!  Ashley's appeal just doesn't get old. She smiles and grins and the drama she adds is great. Well yes Emily Hart played Shirley but i thought she did a wonderful portrayal as teenage Shirley ,her clothes were close to the original and she acted like i imagine ,a teen Shirley. Also Mellisa Joan Harts sister played the little Shirley in the beginning of the movie who I thought was very cute(she has a diffrent last name though)DONT say that its cheap to have these people play the movies because this is my favorite movie and its amazing....my friends who watched this movie were glued to the screen and imagine that,.....now they're Shirley Fans",1011398400,2,895,4.391566265060241

7951065,4,B00005QTA3,"Everyone who ever loved watching the real Shirley Temple will know that no one can compare to her. Like all of us, she was largely a product of the time and culture into which she was born, and in which she became famous. She wasn't perfect. She was a brilliant and talented child who worked hard, and deserved the attention and adulation she got back in the 30s. And in my opinion, Ashley Rose Orr did an exceptional job playing her. It is not her fault that she is not, in fact, Shirley Temple. Honestly, is anyone surprised at that? If the makers of the movie actually did audition 10,000 girls to find this one, I'm surprised that they found even this one.

Ashley does quite a respectable job of portraying her, and is an exceptional singer and dancer.

While she is not Shirley Temple (again, did anyone really expect her to be?) I did see and hear ""flashes"" of Shirley's personality every so often.

The book on which this was based is a great book, but the movie will do for those not as interested in reading.",1438128000,,1018,4.404255319148936

7951070,5,B00005QTA3,"Some critics savaged young actress, Ashley Rose Orr for her portrayal of Shirley Temple Black in this bio-pic ""Child Star: The Shirley Temple Story"" ..... well that's their opinion. I thought she was terrific. ""Child Star"" tells of how Temple got into the movies, her time in the movies (even recreating some of her iconic dance numbers with Bill Bojangles & Buddy Ebsen), her relationship with her family and her retirement for films & subsequent ""comeback"" to movies in her teens. I believe Shirley Temple Black acted as Consultant on this movie and wanted her mother portrayed as a caring, loving person but one who would stand up to the Hollywood moguls regarding her daughters interests. Connie Britton 's portrayal of Shirley's mother, Gertrude shows this wonderfully. Her movie as she stated in her autobiography was no pushy stage mom. Australian audiences will notice a lot of Aussie actors in supporting roles as ""Child Star"" was shot in Australia. A must for Shirley Temple fans.",1422144000,2,990,5.006060606060606
