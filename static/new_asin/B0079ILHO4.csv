5065865,2,B0079ILHO4,"I love my old VHS tapes of a previous series about English Houses, which tied in with an exhibition at the National Gallery of Art back in the 80's.  I cherish them because they really are well done.  This series is flawed though.  There were issues with the sound: sometimes the music was drowning out whomever the hostess of the series was interviewing.  There were too many repetitive shots of the properties from the outside and not enough focus on the actual treasures the title promotes, unlike the previous series which was all about the artistic wonders stored in those old places, with loving camerawork for the viewer to enjoy.  I was also incredibly frustrated at how often the hostess of the series would comment on some portrait or work of art in front of her or behind her without there being a decent close up view of the work of art or portrait.  And sometimes the camera angles were illogical, making it hard to see the art being discussed.  Very disappointing.  I recommend firing up the old VHS player and getting copies of the older series - which I wish they would transfer to DVD!",1341446400,21,1102,4.586734693877551
5065866,5,B0079ILHO4,"I am definitely pleased with this DVD and have greatly enjoyed it.  The tour through 5 of England's most famous treasure houses is wonderful.  Filmed in High Definition and well narrated, you get the feeling that you are actually following your hostess through the magnificent  houses.  This is one that I would recommend and it is one to be enjoyed over and over.",1341360000,,364,4.73015873015873
5065867,2,B0079ILHO4,"First of all, I'm a real Anglophile and can sit still for endless videos about the Royal Family, Stately Houses, pomp and circumstance of any kind BUT this defeated me.  The s-l-o-w progress through the houses, with repeated shots of things already seen, the endless long views of the houses from the air, the stifling commentary of Selina Scott all combine for one long snooze.",1340064000,17,378,4.815384615384615
5065868,5,B0079ILHO4,"This is up close and personal looks at the fine art, dcor, and antiquities as they meet Baroque architecture, kingly landscapes, and historical dwellings. It an excellent docent narration by Selina Scott, making the education of some of the most elaborate Britain fine homes a pure bit of bliss. Close-ups are almost like holding the items, and helicopter views of the grounds are something only a DVD like this can give you--well, unless you are as rich as the people who built these mansions.

5 delightful homes, one per episode with

Save your money.",1425686400,,143,4.142857142857143
8512777,2,B0079ILHO4,I would rather see more of the houses and less of the moderator.  The properties are beautiful and the series does not do them justice.,1395014400,3,135,4.4
8512778,2,B0079ILHO4,"This was not what it appeared to be.  I had expected to see the interior of some beautiful old British homes but was shown maybe 3 rooms in each.  Most interior shots were of the same spot in the house, over and over again.  I was very disappointed.",1393200000,4,249,4.145833333333333
8512779,5,B0079ILHO4,"I thought the piece on Chatsworth would be a rehash of other DVDs out on the subject, but they took a different approach revealing new material not covered in the other DVDs.  The other segments were equally as well done though I'm not sure I'd want a room-size painting of Hell in my home!",1381622400,,290,4.37037037037037

8512782,3,B0079ILHO4,"This film , spent time in only one or two rooms of the homes, giving long narratives on the details, and misssing other rooms, few if any views of the gardens or outside.  15 minutes on the foyeer was too much",1357430400,4,209,4.097560975609756
