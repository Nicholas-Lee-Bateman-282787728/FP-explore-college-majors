289528,3,6300256359,"Young runs hot and cold and during this epoch of his life, the tremendous challenges confronting him as a father of 2 children afflicted with debilitating illness had him preoccupied with their care. As a result, what most people, including his record company never knew, was that experiments like TRANS were meant to be a sort of working out of some technologies that might help his sons become more integrated into the world and give them an active way of participating in it. The technologies here also were part of Young's fascination and involvement in Lionel trains.
Does this make for good music? Not really. But this stuff came off better in concert than it did on CD. Sophisticated technical stuff is definitely overkill with Young in general, and some of the most humourous aspects of the biography SHAKEY, involve ol' Burnout obsessing over digital recording and so on. Young and the Horse are a one trick pony. It's a trick that is terrific when it has the spook, and a total mess otherwise. The bio paints this tour in particular as being a disaster of epic proportions that nearly had the stumble-bum musicians, especially Bruce Palmer, at each other's throats.
Nonetheless, by the looks of it here they actually managed to pull off a decent show from time to time. This video offers the NY fan a chance to evaluate the Trans period from the vantage point of Young's strengths: live performance. The star of the show is really Nils Lofgren, the diminutive guitarist from DC who resides now in the E Street Supper Club. There was a time in his career though where he brought out the best in Young, and for this show he is absolutely at the top of his game. Palmer has no idea he is in Europe, and the rest of the band is along for the ride, likely hoping like hell there is any money left at the end.
It's real innarestin, as the man himself might put it.....",1046908800,5,1872,4.574404761904762
289529,5,6300256359,"One of the things you have to like about Neil Young is that he doesn't limit himself strictly to one genre--his music moves from folk through pop to classic rock to near grunge--yet always retains his own distinctive edge and style.
This is an excellent video in that most of those genre's are covered in a fairly eclectic set of tunes that represent a good cross section of his career.  There's a bit of overemphasis on his ""electronic"" phase, which is somewhat understandable as he'd just released Trans prior to this tour.  That caveat aside, this is an excellent and powerful performance that features an equally eclectic array of periodic Young sidemen in a supporting role.
I'm not normally one for video music--I usually fine it flat and contrived at best--but this session is an exception.  The performance comes through with a lot of energy and highlights why Neil has a reputation as a much better than average live performer.
This is a tape that will please any young fan and will act as a good general introduction to those not familiar with his work.
Pick this up and keep Rockin' in the Free world!",1015200000,8,1112,4.6923076923076925
289530,3,6300256359,"The first few songs into this DVD I was almost embarrassed for Neil. I had always thought of him as a ""timeless classic"" kind of guy, but here, thankfully, is evidence to the contrary. I say ""thankfully"" because I think it's a good thing that Neil had the ability and the willingness to experiment with the trendy electronica that was popular in the early 80's. in Berlin, especially.
Hopefully, most people will chuckle a bit as Neil opens the show in a bright green double-brested weirdo kind of outfit, that eventually devolves into a black shirt and black jeans (with one of those skinny white ties that was popular back then). Much more appropriate for the kind of music that Neil gets back to during the latter 1/3 of the movie. This is where the ""real Neil"" really shines. Jamming, rocking guitars and lots of energy. The crowd really eats it up.
I haven't dabbled with the different audio settings yet, it sounds fine in regular stereo. The video quality is average. considering it's 20 years old, it's actually pretty good. Real Neil fans and collectors will love this video because it's so different from what most people would expect from a man with Neil's reputation as the ""Godfather of Grunge"".",1008633600,3,1208,4.729857819905213
289531,5,6300256359,"Without a doubt one of the best if not THE best rock albumns of all time. The DVD is even better than the laserdisk version. Young and fellow band members mesmerize the audience with most selections and especially the unique performance of ""Berlin"" (which is not available on any other NY albumn). The video performance of selections from his Trans album finally do justice to them. The alltime supreme rendition of ""Like A Hurricane"". An absolutely ""must have"" albumn for all R&R fans.",998611200,3,486,4.867469879518072
289532,4,6300256359,"My rating of four stars is something of a compromise.  I consider it to be a five star item for collectors, and all those guys who rated Trans at 4+ stars, but more like 3 for the more casual Neil Young fan.  This DVD provides fans with a rare oppurtunity to see songs from Trans performed live, specifically Little Thing Called Love, Computer Age, Transformer Man, and Sample and Hold.  Computer Age and Sample and Hold are both superior to the album versions, thanks to louder guitars and an overall fuller sound.  Transformer Man sounds pretty much just like the album (the music is actually played from a tape on this one) but watching Neil and Nils prance around like fools during this one is in itself worth the price of this DVD.  Whatever they were on that night was obviously good stuff :)  Those who who are not familiar with (or even blatantly despise) the Trans material will still find good stuff here, cause the rest of the DVD is more typical Neil fair, with fairly straightforward but well executed performances of favorites like Cinnamon Girl, Like a Hurricane, Needle and the Damage Done, etc.  Other highlites include a particularly good version of Hey Hey My My, and a song called Berlin which (to the best of my knowledge) isn't available anywhere else.
The audio quality is pretty good, especially considering that the concert in question was recorded nearly 20 years ago.  The 5.1 mix is disappointing though, all they've really done is pan the crowd noise and a little bit of echo to the back.  It really sounds better in plain stereo.  Video quality is acceptable, but not great.",993600000,,1604,4.6761565836298935
289533,5,6300256359,"Coming off the Trans tour, one would think this would be a medicore concert at best.  Not the case.  Neil mixes his 80's techno tunes Sample and Hold, Transformer Man and Computer Age, not with similar treatments of his classic songs (as he did with mr. Soul on the Trans album), but with wonderful classic renditions of Old Man and a powerful Cinnomon Girl.  To top it off we are treated to a new song (Berlin) that never made it on any CD.  A must have.",987984000,5,455,4.255813953488372
289534,3,6300256359,"This DVD captures a concert given by Neil and the Trans Band in Berlin in 1982.  If you are a Neil Young fan you will undoubtably enjoy the 60 minute concert with good versions of Cinnamon Girl, Like A Hurricane and songs from the Trans album.
The main disappointment of this set however is the complete abscense of extras (a disappointing 5.1 stereo mix is not an extra !),the uninspiring packaging and the short running time.
The main positive point is the inclusion of the unreleased track Berlin, which it has to be said is a damn good song.
As I noted earlier fans will enjoy this.  If you are looking for a definative Neil DVD I'd recommend the RoadRocks show.",986169600,5,666,4.4958677685950414

And, of course ""Computer Age"",  ""Sample and Hold"" Transformer Man"" played with the Trans Band, all are so exciting to watch.
There is no sitting down on this DVD.  Absolutely my favorite anything to watch......forever!  I'm a 62 year old rock'n'roll Gramma, thanks to Neil.",1206748800,,593,4.669902912621359

I had read the reviews and was really looking forward to this DVD. What an utter disappointment!! I would think Neil would be too embarrassed by this DVD to let it be available. The sound is just totally TRASH!!! I could only force myself to watch about ten minutes of the performance. It's hard to figure how none of the reviewer's of this DVD had anything really bad to say about the sound on it. The lack of sound makes this a total ""THUMBS DOWN"" DVD.",1195948800,,586,4.241071428571429
289588,5,6300256359,"Being a ""moderately serious"" Neil Young fan I bought this DVD for completeness and for ""nostalgic reasons"" (this Tour I experienced my first ever Neil Young concert). I did expect to get some kind of a ""bootleg"" with moderate quality and was surprized to find both a rather high quality sound and video, given this is a low price DVD and a rather simple recording back in 1982 (1983?).

What I do remember from that concert are blow-away versions of Hey Hey My My and Like a Hurricane, a rather ""embarrassing"" Transformer Man ""ballet"" and a Nils Lofgren jumping across the stage like some crazy ""Hampelmann"" (whatever that is in English). However Nils Lofgren did play a couple of own ""classic"" songs during the concert. I do not know if he ""was allowed"" to do that internationally, but he had a good name in Germany because of an excellent ""Rockpalast"" concert on German TV televised live over most of Europe.

Most of this can be seen and heard (about from the Nils Lofgren part) on this DVD and I think that some of the songs (including for example the other songs from the TRANS-Album) can still blow you away.

One thing I find rather strange is that the editorial of Amazon places the concert in 1983, where as all other sources say it was the the 1982 tour. I am however quite sure that I did own the Trans LP (bought in January 1983 according to my ""library card"") when I saw the concert which would place at least the Cologne concert in early summer 1983?!?

Whatever - an excellent concert considering time and effort - and the only chance to see and hear songs from the TRANS-period.  As an added bonus the encore is a song called ""Berlin"", which apparently never appeared again yet (let's all hope for the NY archives!). Berlin is actually an excellent song, it alone justifies the expenditure.",1187568000,,1806,4.578947368421052
289589,5,6300256359,"It's a pretty good dvd, and his songs 'Hurricane' & followed by 'Hey, hey, my, my,', these 2 really rock good. The bonus track called Berlin is ok, and the opener 'Cinnamon Girl' is good enuf to be called cool. I recommend to buy this if u want to see Neil in the early 1980's, cuz he's young in this video. Recommended. His other older songs r good 2, i.e. 'old man', and 'after the goldrush'. Just go out & get it, cuz Neil's a positive guy. Let him make your day (better than Dirty Harry, who's not Canadian.)",1182643200,,512,4.181818181818182
289590,5,6300256359,"I've never before seen Neil live, but now I understand what is the attraction. He's high energy. I kinda' already knew that, but to see him perform is very worthy of the time spent. Also I've never been a die-hard Springsteen fan, so when I saw Nils Lofgren on stage it puzzled me at first, but he immediately earned my respect. I actually came away from this video quite a bit impressed with him. He never used a guitar pick. That's a virtue all to itself. The video: It's old but it's good. Turn-it-up.",1175990400,,504,4.372340425531915

289592,5,6300256359,"I overlooked Berlin for a couple of years because I thought it was more of the same sounds. One day I got a hankerin for wanting to see a performance of ""Old Man"", a staple tune for me at age 16 in Rome, NY in 1973. When I bought Berlin, and opened the case, I got a real surprise. The surprise was that Neil also performed ""Like a Huricane,"" which was not listed on the outside of the case. Neil also did some Geffen Years stuff like Transformer Man very well. Now if we could just get some footage with Southern Man .....

Oh yes, Old Man was awesomely performed by Neil as well.

289593,5,6300256359,"Back in 1983, one of the first releases oriented to the emergent video market, a way to bring to distant consumers and fans musical performances otherwise limited to the lucky public present at them, Neil Young's ""Berlin"" reflected the sharp and original sensitivity of an artist that not merely perceives as also suggests and elaborates response to great impacts brought to all living people, meaning the outspread of personal computers and the imminent fall of the communism. Surrounded by a band carefully picked among his former gatherings (Buffalo Springfield's bassist Bruce Palmer, Crazy Horse's drummer Ralph Molina, post CSNY mate Nils Lofgren, Stray Gators"" Ben Keith and Stills-Young Band percussionist Joe Lala) Neil performs a tight set (one hour long) where we have one of the few opportunities to watch his songs devoted to this concern (""Computer age"", ""Transformer man"", ""Sample and hold"") how to surpass the artificiality and coldness of computerized tools and bring them to life. There, in the land of Kraftwerk, the kings of the rhythm machines, at one of the extreme borders of the so called occidental world, and using heavily devices as Vocoders that transformed voices and instruments beyond the human extent, the artist is able to superimpose those ""obstacles"" with warmth, lyrism and open emotions. Sure it helps having great performances of some of his hits as ""Cinnamon girl"",  ""Hurricane"" and ""After the gold rush"". The movie is perfectly captured by director Michael Lindsay-Hogg and the picture is very sharp. The sound was excellent at the time but this version suffers from not being newly remixed. It sounds as if it was pushed a little too hard in the equalization, but is not a problem at all. I only expected more from this great video, as well as having ""Weld"" (Neil and Crazy Horse's 1990 spectacular show) released in the DVD format.",1153958400,,1873,5.0811688311688314
289594,3,6300256359,"While this DVD of Neil in Berlin is visually absolutely superior to the 1983 video it is surprising that Neil who always exerts so much control over sound quality messed up this time. Because of his present state of reclusiveness he has allowed the sound mixers to do the stangest things to his sound. There is an overdosis of heavy low sound, most likely of drums and bass which were either shuffled more to the foreground and/or were remixed at much lower tone levels and increased volume levels. This doesn't sound like Neil Young
anymore. I played both the DVD and the 1983 Video various times, next to each other, simultanuously, switching from one to the other and there is NO doubt, the video sound is far superior and the DVD sound is simply very strange! Also very careless is the omission of Hurricane from the songlist!!
Wake up Neil !! Don't continue to hide in lonely reclusion, Red Rocks live and Greendales! Give the Fans what they are looking forward to; A Neil Young not going back to Silver&Gold but progressing to Heavy Metal, see the riffs you tried on Rockin' in the free world. THAT is progress on the garage sound and grunge sound of Live Rust, Ragged Glory and Weld. Wake up Neil Young, don't let those soundmixers take control and change the sound of YOUR music.",1081728000,6,1287,4.6
289595,4,6300256359,"For a variety of reasons, this video is a must-own for avid fans of Neil Young.  The setting is the final show of Young's 1982 European tour preceding the December 1982 release of 'Trans'.  In contrast to other Neil Young video recordings, the European venue offers a minimum of crowd noise (unlike Red Rocks Live) as well as an opportunity to watch Neil and Nils Lofgren work the runway jutting into the audience.  And, thankfully, we have only a few shots of audience members, often an editing nightmare threatening to destroy the integrity and impact of the performances (see 'Weld').  One also wonders if Young ever wore a tie on stage again, after watching him competing with it to pillage the six strings of Old Black on 'Like a Hurricane'.
The sound quality is excellent, while the film quality is very good... spoiled by today's standard, you will notice times when the filming blurs a bit, or the camera moves too fast to manage the light.  Nevertheless, there are several stunning images captured that more than make up for the deficiencies of 1980's technology.  In particular is a hypnotic 'drummers-eye-view' scene during 'Hey Hey My My', looking out over Neil's back as the audience throbs to the numbers incessant driving beat.  Neil's personal appearance is as 'clean-cut' as you will ever see him... quite a contrast to his overriding 'Grandfather of Grunge' image.
The personnel surrounding Young, and the song selection make this video quite unique.  Nils Lofgren brings an unbridled energy to the visual performance that is simply priceless.  Ralph Molina, Bruce Palmer and Joe Lala are an unassuming, solid backbone of rhythm for Lofgren, Ben Keith and Neil as they trade places on a variety of instruments.  Larry Cragg offers an understated banjo on 'Old Man', while Joel Bernstein adeptly manages the vocoder and synthesizer.
The hard rock numbers, 'Cinnamon Girl', 'Like a Hurricane', and 'Hey Hey My My' manage to sound simultaneously clean n' dirty in classic Young style.  If there is any weakness in the show, it would have to be the acoustic renditions of Needle and the Damage Done and After the Goldrush, which feel a bit strained and plodding.  The cuts taken from Trans, 'Computer Age', 'Transformer Man', and 'Sample and Hold', produce a compelling flashback as we witness Young perceptively addressing the embryonic advance of digital technology into Western culture which is rapidly becoming our second nature.  'Computer Age' and 'Sample and Hold' rock out, while 'Tranformer Man' is thoughtful, and features some theatrical miming from both Young and Lofgren.  Another Trans cut, 'A Little Thing Called Love', is a bouncy, effortless foray that seems out of character for the Trans LP, but nicely supplements the overall song selection for this video.
The concert, and the tour, is capped off with the completely appropriate 'After Berlin', seemingly written for the moment of its performance, and not performed since.  It's the only blues-rock number in the set, and Young's guitar is crisp and wailing throughout.  Seeing this rare performance was worth the price of admission for the fortunate few in Berlin, and owning it is well worth the price of the video or DVD for the rest of us.",1062633600,34,3228,5.005607476635514
