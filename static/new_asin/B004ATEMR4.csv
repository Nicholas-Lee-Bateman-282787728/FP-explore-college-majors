8420831,5,B004ATEMR4,"This is a great workout!!!  I love the fact that all of Paul Gallas' videos are virtual road (from different parts of the country) and narrated giving you the feeling that you are riding with a group outside. I get to see other parts of the country without leaving my home.  Each video has graphs for heart rate goals, gear ratio and cadence as well as hill profiles.  Each rider can be as intense as they choose. I am not a big fan of traditional gym spin classes.  They are boring and I constantly watch the clock.  Riding my spin bike with Paul Gallas' videos is one of my favorite ways to get in my cardio.",1416960000,,610,4.224137931034483
8420832,2,B004ATEMR4,I found this DVD very boring and not at all what I had expected. I guess I am somewhat spoiled by the Virtual Active DVD's,1388707200,,122,3.92
8420833,2,B004ATEMR4,This is an extremely boring DVD for riders. I was thinking Alaska would be an awesome indoor ride...no very boring!,1371081600,,115,4.8
8420834,5,B004ATEMR4,Very inspiring training d.v.d. has all the conditons as if your actually out on the road biking. Love the virualality aspects of true cycling that it posses. Highly recommend product for training and fitness.,1366070400,,208,5.147058823529412
8420835,5,B004ATEMR4,"This is another great workout by Paul.  This is a good route with nice scenery, though there is one part on a bike path that is rather generic, but that probably was the best alternative on the route.  This is a great video for those 100 degree days here in Texas when I won't ride outside since the Alaska scenery and weather project a nice cool feeling.

If you keep up with the RPM, resistance setting an heart rate, you will get a great workout.",1351555200,,449,4.258823529411765
8420836,4,B004ATEMR4,"A week ago, I didn't think I could do 1.5 hours, and with various training DVDs, including the Alaska extreme calories DVD, I DID it.  I am working on endurance and exercising below my lactate level to burn maximum calories and targeting the fat cells!  And this DVD was what I was looking for and the time did just speeded away that I couldn't believe I did it!  Sore bottom, but that is to eb expected.  I normally spin in class and since getting my own spin Ike, these DVDs by Paul Gallas are excellent.

There are a number of hills and all int the unexpected places with focus on keeping the cadence in the range of 75 to 95, plus speed work at over 110.  Paul talks a lot about nutrition and I picked up a lot of great tips and ar-ha moments.  The scenery was great and the little annoyance of some wire in view at the bottom left of the screen, I hardly paid much attention to it after 10 minutes into the ride.  Definitely, a DVD to do nce during the weekend when I have more time.  Just what I was looking for and a litle bit more.

Just bought the new 2011 muscle breakdown DVDs (total four hours) and I may attempt a portion of it tomorrow to change the tempo of my training.",1325894400,,1185,4.135371179039302
8420837,4,B004ATEMR4,I bought the DVD to help motivate me in my indoor cycling.  I think it is a good product.  I wish there was a bit more music but understand the copyright problems of incorporating music on the video.  It really does keep me moving and I would recommend it to anyone trying to cycle inside during bad weather.,1300665600,,308,4.275862068965517

8420839,4,B004ATEMR4,"I've only just gotten into using DVDs to help me get through an indoor training session while the snow is piled unusually high outside. My first training DVD came free with my trainer--Spinervals 23.0, Time Saver. It is a good way to get in a quick, hard workout. It's about 35 minutes with a challenging interval section in the middle. But I wanted a longer ""ride"" too. Something more like a real ride that I could get lost in and not think about the next minute on the trainer. Anchorage to Eagle Pass is billed as an aerobic workout and that's what I was looking for.

It has its pluses and minuses. The street scene and scenery, cars passing and stops signs all helped me get into the ""ride."" Trying to follow the onscreen cues for cadence and heart rate was not as easy without the ""coach"" pushing it. I kept looking down to see if I was meeting the goals. (If I could get my HR and cadence to appear on screen, then I would do better. Maybe I'll put the Edge 305 in front of me next time.) Keeping the rpms at the level suggested and the heart rate there as well is not so easy. I can see where someone could get into a comfortable, easy spin and go through the whole ride barely breaking a sweat. In that case it would be a good recovery ride video. But if you really try to match cadence and heart rate you will find it's hard to do. And you sweat buckets. I think he maintained a 90% of max HR for almost 10 minutes with a cadence of 95 or 100 on a false flat. I couldn't do it, and eventually had to ride a bit easier than suggested. Try it and you will get a work out. There are times where the suggested HR and cadence do not conform to reality. (Particularly after stop signs or traffic lights. The rid eis ""real"" and so he has to stop now and then, just spin easy during stops. There aren't many.) Sometimes the video doesn't align with the goals on the screen, ie, we're clearly beginning a descent and the rider is struggling as if still climbing. Also, the wide angle view makes it hard to recognize hills or get a sense of their steepness. Maybe they aren't steep, just long.  I also need work on high cadence, above 110 I really couldn't sustain it well without bouncing in the saddle. (Maybe my saddle has fallen a little.)

I wish there wasn't so much time spent on the bike path, but then the highway didn't appear inviting when we saw it earlier in the ride. If I were really there, I'd take the bike path. I began to tire sometime after the first hour and took the latter part of this ride easy, even though another climb came up. I think that leaves me with some work to do on this ""ride."" Definitely beats an hour-and-a-half of spinning to the clock. And to me it serves a different purpose than a short Spinerval DVD.

Note: You can see from my comments on Paul's post that I had some trouble getting the DVD to play in my laptop. He sent some instructions for running it off the PC, but I got just as good results merely copying the DVD to a file and double-clicking the 12kb .ifo file which gave me all menu options, etc.",1267660800,5,3050,4.208547008547009
8420840,5,B004ATEMR4,"I have purchased several of the virtual reality videos from ""Behind the Bars with Paul"" and this is a great workout.  The workout is plenty long enough and the heart feels it.  The virtual reality of the ride brings you into the ride and you can forget you are not actually out on the road.  The heads up information that is supplied on the screen keeps you honest in your effort and you can make it very real and sweet buckets in doing so.  I would highly recommend any of Paul's videos wanting a great way to workout or just get in some indoor miles.",1261526400,7,552,4.228571428571429
