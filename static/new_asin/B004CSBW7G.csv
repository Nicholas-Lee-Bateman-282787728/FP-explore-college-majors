4329119,5,B004CSBW7G,"Kings of Pastry is one of those documentaries you reluctantly add to your Netflix queue. After all, just how entertaining can a pastry competition be?

The answer is that it's surprisingly good. It's an emotional roller coaster that takes the viewer from gut-wrenching disappointment, to a triumph no less sweet than becoming heavyweight boxing champ.

As a documentary aficionado, I honestly didn't expect much from this film. I previously enjoyed other chef-related documentaries such as Pressure Cooker, but had already cast early judgement on a film about French pastry. I'm glad to say that I was deeply moved by the dedication and passion of the chefs participating in the contest, and discovered a new respect for those practicing their craft.

Very few documentaries have successfully captured a group of strong men at their most vulnerable and defeated moments, or the euphoria that can only come from reaching your life's greatest achievement.

This is a powerful and emotional film, and a welcome addition to my collection. If you're having second thoughts about renting a movie about a pastry competition, take my advice and watch it, you'll be glad you did.",1302739200,4,1170,5.174603174603175
4329120,5,B004CSBW7G,"It's a movie about cooking.  Some excitement, right?

In this case, with the movie Kings of Pastry, excitement is right.  Sixteen pastry chefs compete for the classification of Meilleurs Ouvriers de France - MOF- which is THE designation of superior performance.

These competitors are not short-order cooks.  They are chefs, and artists, and chemists, and scholars.  This is the PhD of pastry chefs, with their cakes, candies, desserts, and sugar-based sculptures.  And these competitors take it as seriously as a scholar working up to a defense of their PhD.  They've spent years in training.  They are lucky to get an opportunity once every four years to show their stuff.  Failure is commonplace, with some chefs repeating the effort two, three, even four times.

Their creations are beautiful, and fragile.  Breakage equates into disaster.  Beautify without taste is failure, and vice versa.

This film follows three dedicated chefs, in their training and in the competition.  You simply will be amazed at the effort they put into their craft.  The MOF selection process is brutal, and the viewer of this film will feel the pressure.  What is going to happen?  Who will be rewarded?  And who will be visited with ""the agony of defeat?""

Kings of Pastry is an excellent documentary.  Watch it with friends, and have everyone bring over a gourmet dessert.  You will certainly note this... whatever people bring over, however ""gourmet"" the product is, it will not stand against the superb pieces produced by these master chefs.

I would like to experience first-hand the talent of a MOF someday.  Yum.",1302048000,2,1603,5.053639846743295

4329122,5,B004CSBW7G,"Who would have thought that filmmakers D.A.  Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus - best known for making the first documentary on Bob Dylan (Don't Look Back) and the Clinton presidential campaign (The War Room) would be making a ""reality"" documentary on pastry chefs? Well, they have and it's a wonderful film now making its way to DVD. The competition for the Meilleurs Ouvriers de France (known as the MOF) occurs in France every four years. The winners get to proudly wear a red, white and blue collar on their chef uniform. I say ""winners"" because all can win, some can win, and all can lose. There is no first, second and third place. But competition is tough.  In 2008 - or 2009, I can't be sure - the filmmakers followed three of the 16 competitors. Two were French pastry chefs who live in France. The third - Jacquy Pfeiffer, is a Frenchman who teaches at Chicago's French Pasty School (the only school dedicated to French pastry). I won't give you a spoiler alert - and I hope other reviewers don't reveal the ending either. That's what makes the 88-minute film so interesting.

Except for Pfeiffer and his family and co-workers, everyone else speaks only French, so expect subtitles, but they are clear and easy to read. There is a soundtrack of gypsy Jazz comprised of original recordings by Django Reinhardt and Stephan Grappelli mixed with new recordings by a band named Django Memory. It comes and goes as the tension mounts. Many times there is no music.

The bonuses on the DVD include a five-minute interview with the filmmakers. (watch out for Pennebaker dropping a brief F-word bomb here), a four-minute demo by Pfeiffer and a most unusual three-minute video of a Chocolate Fashion Show. (Yes, models wearing chocolate dresses!).

First Run Features is on a ""food film"" roll now. They recently released the documentary on cooking in urban high schools. And this DVD has the trailer for ""Restaunteur"", a documentary on NYC restaurant owner Danny Meyer. I'm really looking forward to that!

4329127,5,B004CSBW7G,"You want to make a documentary film. You want the subject to have broad appeal. You want drama, suspense, comedy, exhilaration, passion, pathos and triumph.

In short, you want to make a film about the pursuit of excellence, even perfection.

So you make a film about pastry chefs? Yes!

The Meilleur Ouvrier de France (Best Craftsman in France) is a century-old competition that encourages artisans in a myriad of professions (including pastry chefs) to compete for the grand prize: recognition that you are one of the best at what you do. The winning pastry chefs are awarded a special collar which they then wear with pride, a symbol of accomplishment and a very, very great honour. There is no cash awarded. The prestige is all.

Whether you're an artist or an artisan, an athlete or in business, most people can identify with wanting to be the best. Thats why, even if you cant boil water, you can appreciate what drives each of the sixteen (out of seventy) finalists documented in KINGS OF PASTRY as they prepare for the ultimate challenge in this unique competition.

The U.S. filmmakers find the perfect way into this decidedly European subject by focusing on a transplanted Frenchman, Jacquy Pfeiffer, who, though French by birth (the competition is only open to French citizens) now lives in the U.S. where he founded the French Pastry School in Chicago. We quickly learn that he is a finalist in the 2008 competition.

Those who advance to the final are given several months to plan and practice their ideas and designs. We learn Jacquys reasons for wanting to participate in the prestigious competition and the sacrifices that his friends and family have made on his behalf. He is one very determined individual.

Along the way we meet some of the other competitors. We begin to care about them, which is vital if we are to share their disappointments, anxieties and excitement.

The competition is intense, with creativity and efficiency counting as much as taste and texture. Some of the elaborate pastry sculpturesin which everything must be ediblehave to be seen to be believed. It is amazing how much tension is created in the film, wondering if any of the sculptures will collapse. And if they do, what can be done about it?

Needless to say, such mishaps occur, but the ability to improvise and cover up ones mishaps is seen to be almost as valuable a skill as the ability to come up with the original design.

Nervous breakdowns in the kitchen, you say? Temper tantrums? Tears? This is high drama indeed, when the stakes are so high.

KINGS OF PASTRY is an incredible feel good movie. You find yourself rooting for any number of the chefs. They are driven, after all, to be the best they can be: an admirable quality.

One flaw is that the final food presentations are not photographed with any particular adjustment in lighting. This is understandable given that it is a documentary, recording a lightning-paced event as it unfolds. Still, careful lighting would have made some of the incredible food designs even more palatable-looking.

I also think the film should come with a warning: Before viewing this film, please stock up on &eacute;clairs, cupcakes, pastry, etc. Otherwise you will be salivating throughout.

I made up for this oversight the next day. For days afterward I couldn't get KINGS OF PASTRY out of my head or my taste buds. (As long as the cream puffs lasted)",1397433600,2,3401,4.831325301204819

It unveils the devotion, talent, and yet simple clarity that these chefs must have to get to this level. If you've ever had to work for something in your lifetime, you'll be able to relate to the steps to achievement and sometimes, devastating falls that make you question your choices.

4329133,5,B004CSBW7G,"In France, master chefs compete for the title of Milleurs Ouvriers de France. The Great Craftsman of France...also known as M.O.F.s.  Some of them are Kings of Pastry. To become a King and earn the Red White & Blue Collar, you have to be one tough cookie.

We follow a young pastry chef, Jacquy Pfeiffer, French naturally, but teaching his skills in Chicago.  His partner, an MOF himself, will help train Jacquy for this 3-day marathon event. And it is a marathon. The competition is grueling.  90 of the greatest French pastry chefs -- which is to say the greatest in the world -- will step into the kitchen for the preliminary round. Only 16 will make the first cut. From this select group,the new MOFs will be chosen. There can be more than one winner because this is not so much a competition as a stage, a level of greatness to be attained.

Jacquy hones his techniques, he creates incredible sugar sculptures, fantasies of chocolate.  Watching him make candy ribbon is amazing...I kept replaying it over and over again.  He sculpts gigantic swirls and swags made of melted sugar,amazing architectural structures...plinths and columns and pedestals of chocolate. He magically transforms ordinary kitchen staples into glowing amber spheres, yards of lacy confectionary, and stunning flowers, rich in detail with each petal and stamen made and applied separately. He builds wedding cakes (this year's M.O.F. theme) that are marvels of engineering and structure.  And always, he has to make sure everything tastes good. Not only must the presentation be breathtaking, the flavors have to be killer too.  No detail can lack perfection.  Even the tiny one-bite puff pastries, cookies, macrons, napoleons and other goodies that serve merely as plate decoration will be judged and must be unique in taste, appearance and originality.

Jacquy is sweating bullets.  He works all day at his culinary school and all night long perfecting his techniques.  For about ten days before the competition, he packs up his pastry chef tools and heads to France for endless practice sessions.

The event is taken very seriously not only by the entrants, but by the entire nation.  France is not like America.  As Jacquy points out early in the film, ""There is no 'all you can eat' in France.""  It is quality, not quantity that wins the French heart.  President Sarkozy opens the competition and attends the banquet celebrating the winners.  Imagine the President of the United States flying in to congratulate Muriel Wiggens on her prize winning Corn Doggie Casserole at the Pillsbury Bake Off!

We meet several other candidates, all of whom have invested a lifetime in training to be pastry chefs and to whom that MOF collar means so much.  There is so much tension during the competition itself, you will find yourself sitting on the edge of your chair. There is danger...some of those sugar and chocolate sculptures are more fragile than glass...and there is tragedy.  The pieces must be hand carried to the judging arena...and these are huge, heavy objects made of nothing more than sugar syrup, so delicate they can shatter from the slightest touch. Some break while cooling, some while being carried, and some...for no reason, shattering into little shards of broken dreams. One chef sobs out loud over the ruins of his creation...and it is very hard not to cry along with him.

But still, there are surprises, victories are snatched from the jaws of defeat, and sometimes snatched from those who are most deserving.  We share the sorrow of loss, the heady joy of success. The competition is more exciting than The World Series, more uplifting that watching election results.  Even the hard-eyed chef, chief of the judges, who dismisses someone's beautiful creation with a shrug and the tiniest curling of a lip, is overcome with emotion when he awards the collars to four chefs and breaks the hearts of another dozen.

If you love France, cooking, and sweet little movies, you need to see this. One word of advice: Stock up on some good french pastry first or you will, like me, be thrown into a frenzy of refrigerator and cupboard searching, desperate for something good and sweet and crunchy and custardy...I ended up with apricot jam on a saltine. Don't let this happen to you.  Hit the french bakery first. Hit it hard. This is no movie for sissies.",1350000000,2,4344,4.906976744186046

I'm generally a fan of documentaries, but knew nothing about this movie beforehand. I wasn't sure how much like a Food Network Challenge this would be.

I ended up really enjoying it. The story of the three chefs (though mainly one) is compelling and the drama from their four years of preparation being put to the test is meaningful. The personality shown by the existing MOTs made it for me. They seemed to empathize with the competitors.

Thumbs up.

This Pennebaker/Hegedus production follows French pastry chefs Jacquy Pfeiffer, Philippe Rigollot and Regis Lazard as they attempt to get their Meilleur Ouvrier de France ('MOF') Ptissier designation from the French Ministry of Labour.  The level of effort that the participants need to put into their preparation is astonishing.  I was hyperventilating just watching, so one can only imagine the excruciating pressure on the participants.  By the end of the three days, they're mentally, physically and emotionally depleted.

Without hammering you over the head, the film points out the high degree of skill, intelligence, commitment and creativity required by these craftsman.  I love the way the French culture honors and respects the work of the profession.  It's notable that Pennebaker & Hegedus start their film with President Nicolas Sarkozy's speech to the latest inductees.  That the President is there speaks volumes.  But, even more, is what Sarkozy says in his speech: that excellence in manual craft fields ought to be held on par with that in academic pursuits.  As Chris Hegedus commented in a complementary POV interview:

""The film is about pushing for excellence in your life and in what you do. There is something that Sarkozy highlighted when he was giving the speech about the MOF which is to recognize the manual craft fields in a equal way to how we recognize academic excellence. Education in this country needs to be re-thought in terms of a lot of these types of vocational careers, especially when you see the type of work and excellence that goes into the culinary career. Pastry is the type of occupation and profession that's not just about cooking and taste. There is all sorts of chemistry, physics and design that go into the chefs' creations.""

I agree wholeheartedly.  Vocational education has lagged in the US in the last couple of decades.  By contrast, countries like Germany and France focus on vocational training, set up widespread apprenticeship programs and create a culture that places value and regard on craftsmanship.  There's a lot to be learned here.

Of Mssrs. Pfeiffer, Rigollot and Lazard: You'll root greatly for these three likable gentlemen.  Not everyone can be a winner, but they're all winners in this viewer's eyes...as are the members of the MOF jury.  The jury's extraordinary show of empathy throughout the process is relevatory.  These are men that only want the best for their colleagues, but they have to balance that desire with upholding the rigorous standards of the MOF.  You can tell it nearly tears these guys apart to have shoot down some lifelong dreams.",1309824000,,3692,5.909604519774011

Even I can admit that a journey through the MOF competition has the potential to be pretty boring, but this is executed in such a way that you become drawn into not only the competition, but into the hopes and lives of the chefs themselves, which makes their successes and failures all the more poignant to watch. I'm sure there are people think ""how stupid, it's just dessert,"" and I wish they would watch this documentary to see how serious the MOF is. You can't understand how physically and emotionally exhausting it is to do such delicate and meticulous work until you've actually done it. I've had the pleasure of meeting Chef Sebastien Canonne and it's amazing how talented and committed you have to be to achieve such greatness in the pastry world.

This film was directed by Chris Hegedus and DA Pennebaker, who made Bill Clinton's War Room. A strange juxtaposition, for sure. However, this is a documentary that works, drama, great tension, family stories, and most of all camaraderie between the bakers and the judges. In this film we follow three of sixteen bakers who are competing for 'Les Meilleurs Ouvriers de France, the best craftsmen in France, or the MOF. This competition takes place in Lyon, France, every four years, over three intense days. The initial contestants started out with 70, were cut down to 16, and all are competing to win the big prize. There is some sort of scoring if which we are not awRe if, and all sixteen could win if they met the requirements and scored well.

We follow Jacquy Pfeiffer, who voted found Chicago's French Pastry School. We meet his fianc&eacute;e and daughter, a very close family.  The two Frenchmen, Philippe Rigollot USA chef for Maison Pic in France. Regis Lazard, had competed four years ago, and his sculpture fell apart, which shattered him for awhile. We observe all three men as they prepare, and it is rigorous. The showpieces made of spun sugar and rib ones and flours are very elaborate. Truthfully, I did not find many of them attractive, too puffy, too big, too out there for me. The other pastries, however, looked delicious.

Then we move into the competition. The men must work quickly, with precision, and everything must come together perfectly. This is the most tension in one room I have felt. There are disasters and obstacles, and in the end the winners are announced. The judge who announced the results had tears for those who did not receive the coveted award.

This film was indeed an excellent film, well worth watching.
