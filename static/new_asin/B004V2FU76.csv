8442671,4,B004V2FU76,"The DVD arrived top notch! I bought it for my best friend, since it's a film he quite liked when we were kids. We watched it, and as most things we enjoyed as kids, it's a lot sillier than we remembered, but the songs are still very good. The actors did a great job, and I thought it was a beautifully shot film. The story is your typical young romance film (especially in Bollywood), but the two leads have great chemistry.",1457913600,,424,4.246913580246914
8442672,4,B004V2FU76,"LOVE STORY Directed by legendary Rajendra Kumar to launch his son Kumar Gaurav and Vijayata Pandit
The film is typical love story but it's very entertaining especially how the couple escape and then the clash of egos, the way the couple realise they are in love and the climax
There is also a comic track of Amjad Khan who is hilarious
Direction by Rajendra Kumar is good Music was a big asset
Kumar Gaurav(real name Manoj Rajendra Tuli) did a good job playing Bunty though he does seem too awkward in scenes yet he suits his part Vijayata Pandit is good too in her role though her voice annoys Danny Denzongpa is superb and Rajendra Kumar is as usual Amjad Khan is hilarious",1305849600,2,675,4.495934959349594
