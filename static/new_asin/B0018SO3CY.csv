8270962,5,B0018SO3CY,"Considering the limitations of videotaping an illegal and extremely rigorous means of travel, Alison Murray has managed to produce a heck of a good documentary. I can't imagine how she pulled it off. For all I know, she may have had a full film crew following her around, but there is no evidence of it in this film. What we see instead is a lean, well-edited, and surprisingly entertaining story about ""riding the rails"". The director and star of the film is a charismatic and intrepid young woman named Alison. She takes huge risks as she and various companions hobo their way across Canada and the northern US. I did it myself as a teen, so I'm familiar with both the joys and the hardships. It's just about as tough as it gets.

Alison's excitement is palpable throughout, and probably the main reason I found the film so charming. Her mood often borders on exaltation. She starts out her trip with 2 male aquaintances, veterans of train travel who show her the ropes. As is common with road friendships, however, they quickly part ways. For much of the film her only companion is another very young woman named Wendy. The two girls crawl under fences, hide behind dumpsters, avoid the cops, and roll around in the residual coal dust of an empty hopper. Towards the end of the trip, time restraints force the pair to abandon the rails in favor of an infinitely more luxurious rental car.

It's evident from the start that for Alison, at least, the trip is an adventure, not a lifestyle. She doesn't hide the fact that she has money and a home to return to. (I'm reminded of a brief period in the 1980s or 90s when hopping freight, credit card in pocket, was practiced by a very few daring young professionals.) Way too dangerous, slow, and uncomfortable to attain true fad status, ""catching out"" seems to be rising in popularity again, especially among teens. I find that frightening, and sincerely hope that this light-hearted film won't encourage any kids to try it for themselves. Don't underestimate the risk; the hobos may look like they're having fun, but there is very little mercy on the rails, and one slip can cost a rider her legs or his life.

The care-worn, weathered faces of the older hobos are a more accurate reflection of the hardships they've chosen to endure. But danger and suffering, always lurking in the background, are not what this film is about. Alison is making a statement about freedom and courage, serendipity and fast friendship, all of the joys available to those who are young and fearless and healthy enough to take the risk. ""Train on the Brain"" is a simple road movie, an  authentic, sincere documentary, and quite an accomplishment for a young film maker.",1365206400,,2697,4.695560253699789
8270963,4,B0018SO3CY,"I really enjoyed this film, having an interest in railroading generally, and in particular the almost-vanished hobo culture.  It provides a gritty close-up look at the hardships of ""riding the rails"", while also highlighting the scenic joys of crossing North America in this unique way.  It's not for everyone, but if you've ever dreamed of ""catching out"" on the next westbound freight, you'll like it.",1297036800,,402,5.1692307692307695
