1618603,5,B00005KARG,"I have a confession to make.  Even with as big a Disney fan as I am, I had never seen any of the Davy Crockett movies before this came out.  I'd seen pictures and heard stories of the Crockett craze, but had no idea what these movies were really all about.
This set of DVD's contains all five of the Davy Crockett episodes from the TV show Disneyland as they originally aired.  This includes the opening show animation, Walt's intros and outros, and promos for next week's episode.  They are presented here unedited and in their original order.  Leonard Maltin introduces each episode and hosts the interviews on the second disc.  Of those, the one about the Davy Crockett craze is ok, but hearing Fess Parker's memories is interesting, especially to a Disney fan like me.  The picture and sound quality is great for something from the 50's, although I did notice that the picture does go to black and white once per episode.
Watching these for the first time over the weekend, I was captivated by the movies.  The scenery is beautiful and the acting is good.  There are a couple spots where a couple stories seem to drag, but they never last long.  My favorites are the two on the second disc, particularly the keel boat race.  Still, I plan to rewatch all the episodes on these DVDs many more times.
Any Disney fan will be pleased to have these in their collection.  They are a fun trip to yesteryear for every generation to enjoy.",1010707200,77,1433,4.533073929961089
1618604,3,B00005KARG,"I bought this DVD as a Christmas present for my 4 year old son, anticipating the ""crockett craze"" that I went through as a child. However, that didn't happen. The commentary just isn't necessary. Disney just as easily could have made the commentary a special feature, rather than showing it at the beginning of each feature. My kids don't care much for it, they just want to see the film. I really enjoyed the DVD, hence 3 stars rather than 1 or 2. If you're older, enjoyed the Crockett series as a child and really want to see an excellent film to DVD transfer, buy this DVD.",1009929600,6,576,4.392523364485982
1618605,5,B00005KARG,"I was 10 when DAVY CROCKETT was on TV. I had the coonskin cap and loved all 5 shows. I collected the bubble gum cards picturing scenes from the shows and saw the movie, too ... both in color, while the shows were in good ol' black and white. (I didn't have a color TV then anyway.)
The DVD quality here is both great and not so great.
1) First of all, [...it] indicates there is a hidden ""Easter Egg"", THE BALLAD OF DAVY CROCKETT sung by Fess Parker. I finally found it! ""Right click"" on the second selection on disc 2, which highlights Davy's cap. Then press ENTER.
2) The color on the DVD is superb, the sharpness is OK but the cleanliness of the films is less than I expected. I would have thought that every frame would have been digitally remastered, but no...some frames show spots, dirt and lines running down the screen.
3) Each show has multiple chapters as one would expect, BUT THE CHAPTERS ARE NOT LISTED ON THE MENU. Nor is there a detailed listing of the chapters and what they are about. I thought that was very strange.
(With the less than perfect frames and the lack of menu chapters, probably the Disney folks rushed to get this out before Christmas.)
4) In an earlier [...] customer review, someone indicated that there really was no George Russel. That's not true! He wasn't around all the time like Disney's Georgie, but he was indeed a friend of Davy's and written in Crockett's memoirs.
Now that Disney has given us Crockett fans what we wanted, we must force them to publish SONG OF THE SOUTH. The movie is no more politically incorrect than CABIN IN THE SKY or GREEN PASTURES, which are both currently in print. Michael Eisner ... what do you say?",1009324800,10,1672,4.431818181818182
1618606,4,B00005KARG,"Humor me as I do my man thing and let the little boy inside eek out.  It's all Walt Disney's fault.  In 1954, Disney premiered the first of five Davy Crockett episodes on his ""Disneyland"" TV series.
As a seven year-old, I was among the tens of thousands of kids caught up in the wildest media frenzy of the mid-Twentieth Century.  Davy Crockett, the King of the Wild Frontier, had become the king of TV and mass merchandising.  Every boy, particularly, had to have his own coonskin cap.  The matching buckskin pants and shirt helped, as well as the authentically licensed ""Old Betsy"" long rifle.  And it occurred overnight, literally, that Dec. 15 evening.
Those way-back days are vividly alive in a fun and nostalgic double-DVD set just released as part of the new ""Walt Disney's Treasures"" series.  Entitled ""Davy Crockett, the Complete Televised Series,"" the 4 hour, 28 minute extravaganza features all five as-aired Crockett episodes with the original Walt Disney introductions and previews of next week's show.  This set is a gotta-have for any baby boomer.
Before getting into specific episodes and supplementals, be advised that these Crocketts are not exactly as televised originally.  In 1954 and '55, the ""Disneyland"" series had only black and white broadcasts, so these gorgeously restored Technicolor prints are an upgrade.  Most of the introductions, however, are shown here in black and white.  Interestingly, there are scattered moments during the fourth episode, the keelboat race, that switch to black and white.  The existing color print of this episode is obviously a tad incomplete.  It would have helped if liner notes would detail exactly what happened in this regard.
In fact, a downer about this set is that the liner notes barely tell anything about the Davy Crockett production.  One has to get any inside info through movie guy Leonard Maltin, via his interviews that are included on the second disc.  The other negative is that, although it is advertised on the cover that a recent interview with Buddy Ebsen is included, there is no such interview.  It would have been super to hear his reminiscences about co-starring as Georgie Russell in the series.
At least the Disney people were visionary enough to film each episode in color, anticipating the soon-to-be color TV audience as well as theatrical showings.  Speaking of such, the first three episodes were edited together, and released with profitable success to movie theaters as the feature film, ""Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier.""  I remember well the exasperation of my Dad when he, Mom, my sister and I watched the movie at the local drive-in.  ""Why,"" he vexed, ""this is the same as we saw on TV!""  Which it was, basically.  We then sat back and enjoyed it in living color.
The set includes the trilogy, ""Davy Crockett, Indian Fighter,"" ""DC Goes to Congress,"" and ""DC At the Alamo,"" plus ""DC and the Keelboat Race"" and ""DC and the River Pirates.""  Although Fess Parker's Crockett history ended after fives shows, he wore a cookskin hat as TV's Daniel Boone, a non-Disney production, for six years thereafter.  The amiable Parker, now 76, is interviewed at his vineyard and winery, located in Los Olivos, California.  He has only good memories of his years at Disney, that began with the Crockett series.  He recalls dressing as Davy and touring 42 cities and 13 countries for promotion in the mid-1950s.  As incentive, Parker recieved 10 per cent of Crockett merchandising profits.
Author Paul Anderson (""The Davy Crockett Craze""), also interviewed, estimates that up to three thousand different Crockett items were available for sale at the time.  Some choice Davy Crockett trivia is revealed on this DVD.
As Anderson muses, ""Nothing anyone, including Disney, has done has come near it (the Davy Crockett popularity) before, during or since.""  That includes ""Star Wars,"" ""Harry Potter,"" and ""Hopalong Cassidy.""",1008720000,11,3908,5.035769828926905

1618609,5,B00005KARG,"My son got turned on to Davy Crockett last year when his Grandmother gave him the video. He and his friends play out the scenes just like the kids from the 50s did. In fact, he even has a coon skin hat. Last spring I found out that Fess Parker now owns a winery near Santa Barbara, CA. We wrote to him and received a personalized letter back. Davy Crockett still has magic for children today. In part that's because Fess Parker was able to bring his personnel sincerity to the film. Don't get this DVD just to relive old memories. Share it with your sons, daughters and grandchildren. There's a whole new generation that can experience the magic.",999648000,,646,4.436974789915967
1618610,5,B00005KARG,"Like many of these previous reviewers, I also grew up watching the Disney version of Davy Crockett.  Fess Parker will always be Davy to us... (and actually there is an uncanny resemblence between Fess Parker and the real Davy Crockett portraits- though Mr. Parker appears to be a tad taller...!).  Anyway, this version of Crockett makes many of the others who came later- including John Wayne- pale by comparison.  I would note that the last words of Davy's pal, George Russel were ""Give 'em WHAT FER, DAVY""!  It isn't... ""You can have ma fuhr""!  Sorry ... but I'm ""purty"" sure on that one, guy.  Anyway, this new DVD series is a real keeper and finally chronicles the saga in an order that makes sense.... and an image crisp to view (originally, the keelboat series aired AFTER the Alamo ""death"" of Davy... Disney hadn't reckoned on Davy being such a hit!  To many kids, Davy coming back like that proved he didn't really die at the Alamo after all... !).",998006400,8,956,4.621301775147929
1618611,5,B00005KARG,"It seems odd to be writing a review concerning a product that has not yet been released, but when I heard about this upcoming DVD, I really got excited. One of the pivotal events of my life was watching the Davy Crockett television shows on our family's old black and white Motorola television when they first appeared. Sure, I had the t-shirt and the plastic model of ""Old Betsy"", Davy's trusty rifle. I still quote the Disney version of his famous motto: ""Be sure you're right, then go ahead."" My friends and I spent many happy hours defending the walls of the Alamo (actually the cinder block back wall of our property) from Santa Anna's men. We would take turns being Davy and his friend Georgie Russell, who uttered the never-forgotten words I quoted above just before his heroic death. Now that I've grown up and read extensively in history, I know that a lot of what Disney put into the series isn't true, (for example, there was no Georgie Russell) but who cares? We all need heroes and role models in our life, and Davy Crockett, with his self-deprecating wit and sense of honor and justice was perfect for my generation. I'm just so happy this series is being released, for I will now be able to share my boyhood hero with my grandchildren; they need heroes too.",995500800,10,1272,4.558951965065503

The two volume set consist of the three original TV episodes that took our country by storm on disc one and the remaining two reprise episodes on the second disc. The episodes on disc one look very clean with great color and of course the wonderful locations used. This show was way ahead of it's competitors and had a look that was missing from many TV shows from the time and for years to come. Walt also shot the show in color which was unheard of because color TV wasn't even happening yet! This was a smart move because of the show's success he later edited the three shows into a feature film released in theaters.

Disc two has the two reprise episodes which have a different feel, but are very entertaining and in some ways even more than the original three shows. These two episodes look great too, but I did notice in some very small sequences that the color changed to sepia tone for a few seconds here and there. This is a little baffling as the show is shot in color so I'm not sure why or how this happened?.....maybe these few bits were damaged on the original reels and the only pieces of film they had to use were in sepia?

1618777,5,B00005KARG,"Walt Disney made five television shows about Davy Crockett with Fess Parker in the title role and Buddy Ebsen as his sidekick George Russel.  You can now own all five of these television shows in two versions.  This version presents all five television shows as they were first presented on ABC in the mid-1950s.  There is also a two-movie version that combines these five television shows into two movies.  I personally prefer the Disney Treasures version.  This version also includes additional material that may be interesting to a fan of the series.  The gem of the additional material is the interview with Fess Parker.

The television shows in this set are diverse in style.  The first three television episodes are ""Davy Crockett - Indian Fighter,"" ""Davy Crockett Goes to Congress,"" and ""Davy Crockett at the Alamo.""  These television shows have some basis in historical fact, though many of the things portrayed in these shows are wrong.  For example, Davy left the rifle he called ""Betsy"" back in Tennessee when he went to Texas.

What is amazing about these television shows is the response of Americans.  Suddenly children everywhere were sporting coonskin caps and carrying replicas of muzzle-loading rifles.  It became unfashionable to be a Native American, and very fashionable to say ""bar"" instead of bear.

Though Davy did not survive the events at the Alamo, Davy's popularity was such that Walt Disney brought Davy back in two additional television adventures, ""Davy Crockett and the Keelboat Race"" and ""Davy Crockett and the River Pirates.""  According to Walt Disney, this second set of adventures was based on stories created about Davy Crockett, who had become a legend in his own time.  The stories were more humorous than the first three, and showed an even larger-than-life version of Davy Crockett than the first three adventures.

What is most remarkable about these television shows is how well they hold up.  The story of Davy Crockett is timeless.  Davy's attributes are those that form the basis of how Americans see themselves.  Self-reliance, honesty, keeping your word, and being plain-spoken remain characteristics that most Americans value.

A viewer does have to forgive several things that we now regard as politically incorrect, particularly in the first part of the first movie, where Davy seems to have little regard for Native Americans.  However, in later episodes Davy clearly values his friendship with Native Americans and attempts to honor the commitments the U.S. government made to them.

I allowed my children to watch these movies when they were very young.  Yes, there is some violence in these movies.  However, Davy and George Russel used violence only when there appeared to be no other reasonable way out.  Given that the era depicted in these movies was violent, I think the movies were directed and produced well.

These movies are a great way to introduce your children to an era when the American ethic for honesty, hard work, and trust were formulated.  Davy Crockett was instrumental is being an example we can all follow, perhaps now more than ever.  This movie is a must for every family film library.  Enjoy!",1151798400,18,3172,5.055876685934489
1618778,5,B00005KARG,"Regarding the review, below, written by ""crazysunseteacher"", this complete TV series DVD set is nothing at all like the two theatrical film releases.  It contains the full, uncut original television episodes, as they were originally broadcast on ""Disneyland"" in the 1950s.  These five TV programs included considerably more footage than the theatrical film releases.

The theatrical film releases have been available previously on VHS (and now on DVD) and anyone who bothered to watch them and compare them to the TV series DVD set would know immediately that there is considerable additional footage in the TV series, as released on this grand DVD set.  There are even different musical cues in ""The Ballad of Davy Crockett"" in the film version that were specially written to accompany new film transitions.  For starters, the very beginning of the film version omits the scene at Crockett's cabin with his family.  How could you miss that if you watched the two versions at all?

The reviewer in question clearly did not bother to watch and compare carefully the two versions before posting the review.  Please do not let this uninformed, inaccurate review dissuade you from buying this DVD set.",1151107200,45,1197,5.102564102564102
1618779,5,B00005KARG,"Half century ago, Walt Disney and Fess Parker struck gold with The Adventures of Davy Crockett. It was a very different time for Disney and television in general. It was a time when both parents and children could watch a prime time television show and not have to be embarrassed about anything. It was a time when things like profanity, sexual immorality, and blatant disregard for one's neighbor were unheard of on the screen. It was a time when the heroes would sometimes even do something as offensive today as quote from the Bible (which Davy Crockett occasionally does).

On a lighter note, today's generation will not readily recognize the need or desire to wear a hat made of raccoon's skin on one's head. Nor would most young people today (myself included) be familiar with a phrase like ""Give 'em what fer!"" For the record, this phrase refers to beating the living snot out of something or someone which has rubbed you the wrong way.

This DVD comprises part of the ""Walt Disney Treasures"" series. This is a series of classic Disney shows from different eras or genres and is hosted by film historian and critic Leonard Maltin. Other releases in this series include ON THE FRONT LINES (an exhaustive collection of the cartoon propaganda shorts Disney put out during World War II) and DISNEYLAND USA (which chronicles the opening of Disneyland to the public and how it evolved over the years). And there are many, many more.

Whether or not you grew up watching Davy Crockett is really beside the point. This show is for anyone who has a love for the old American pioneer stories; the Old West; and perhaps most of all, the old Disney.",1121040000,16,1644,4.701388888888889

HOwever upon actually seeing these DVDs I was very disappointed.  It is exactly the same as those two movies it is just split into five seperate episodes.  The Episodes: Davy Crockett, Indian Fighter; Davy Crockett Goes to Congress; and Davy Crockett at the Alamo are all the parts included in the movie Davy Crockett King of the Wild Frontier.  The episodes Davy Crockett's Keelboat Race; Davy Crockett and the River Pirates; were what made up the movie Davy Crockett and the River Pirates.  I for one am planning on buying the newer version that came out in 2004 that is just the two movies on one disc.  The only difference between this set and the new set is that there are couple of features on this set and that there are introductions to the episodes buy Leonard Maltin and it has two discs in a tin collector's box.  The biggest difference of all is that this set runs from between $37-$100 whereas you can buy the two movies on DVD for $14-$16.

Sorry, no easter eggs on this set. (hidden DVD features)
Disneyland USA, the fourth and final volume of wave 1, is probaly the most important.  Here, as with all the others, the DVD is enclosed in a numbered tin, along with a lithograph of the poster for Autopia, and a program booklet with a list of features and a letter from Leonard Maltin, the host of the series.  On disc 1, we trace the early years of Disneyland with two complete episodes from the original TV show.  Each have an intro by Maltin
The Disneyland Story: The very first episode of the Disneyland Television series, which give clips of whats to come in each section of the Disneyland television series anthology.  There is a sneak peek of Disneyland, a peek at the new Davy Crockett series, and a tribute to Mickey featuring two entire cartoons.
Dateline Disneyland:  Join your hosts Art Linkletter, Ronald Reagan, and Bob Cummings as they cover live, the inagural day at Disneyland, with the late Reagan covering the dedication.  This is the most important of the set, and is a treat for Disneyland film buffs and fans alike.

The Magic Kingdom and the Magic of Television: This documentary gives a short history of the park and the Disneyland TV Show with Leonard Maltin
Gallery: A gallery of photographs and posters, as well as merchandise.
The smallest of the four in wave 1, Disneyland USA could have a little more material.  However, that is a small price to pay for the historical broadcasts in this wonderful set. I'll write the reviews for Wave 2 tomorrow.  See you then.

1618812,5,B00005KARG,"Davy Crockett is sometimes cheesy but it never fails to entertain. It has that Disney magic to it that we don't see anymore and probably never will see again from Disney. This collection of all of Davy's adventures gets its deserving treatment in the Walt Disney Treasures series and it truly is just that. I will admit, I bought this really to just complete my Treasures collection, but when I first saw it I was wowed. I was born a long time after this first aired, yet I could imagine what it would have been like. A great hero of American history coming to the tv screen on Sunday night back in the 60's. Davy Crockett, played by Fess Parker, starred in 5 features, all presented uncut as they were seen then, only now they are in color. That is a good thing though. All of the features have the original Walt Disney introduction from ""Frontierland"" and it is great to see classic footage restored this beautifully. The episodes included are:
Davy Crockett Indian Fighter
Davy Crockett Goes to Congress
Davy Crockett at the Alamo
Davy Crockett's Keelboat Race
Davy Crockett and the River Pirates
Davy dies in the third installment, only to return in two more adventures. Walt Disney explains why this is, as he was brought back due to the popularity of the character. This, along with the extras make this a great set to own, or at least watch once. Extras include:
""A Conversation with Fess Parker"" Leonard Maltin & Fess Parker
""The Davy Crockett Craze"" with Leonard Maltin
Easter Egg: ""The Ballad of Davy Crockett""

Normally I don't like watching cowboy/frontier/indian movies but I instantly loved these episodes. It is pure and simple entertainment that you won't see in today's more complicated time. But this is a great set, and also has a cool collectible tin to hold the case. This is a nice set, and although out of print you can find this without paying too much for it. No complaints on this dvd from me though, and I highly recommend it to Disney fans or anyone else in general. All I can say is check it out for yourself.",1088208000,8,2051,4.591280653950954
1618813,5,B00005KARG,Over 40's - turn durn the colour and watch the first episode in black and white to be transported back to an idyllic childhood memory.  Watch episode 2 then the river boat episodes.  Finally Davy at the Alamo - this makes more sense than the order presented on the DVD.  I cannot praise the transfer too highly (one of the river episodes does slip into B&W at some stage - probably due to lost footage being made up from other sources but this does not detract).  Thank you Walt Disney.,1081036800,,486,4.366666666666666
1618814,5,B00005KARG,"The Walt Disney Treasures- The Complete Davy Crockett Television Series is a great DVD that is a must have for fans of the show.  Telling the adventures of frontiersman Davy Crockett and his sidekick Georgie Russel, the five episodes follow the two men through the Creek Indian War, Davy's trip to Congress, the battle of the Alamo, a keelboat race with Mike Fink, and a showdown with river pirates.  All five episodes look great.  I never saw the original episodes so after seeing Davy Crockett King of the Wild Frontier for so many years, it was great to see the episodes as they were originally presented.  This is a great DVD that tells the story of a larger than life frontier hero.
  Fess Parker is the image many people think of when they hear the name Davy Crockett and its for a reason.  Parker's performance is truly great as the frontiersman, hunter, adventurer, and Congressman, Davy Crockett.  Equally as good is Buddy Ebsen as Georgie Russel, Davy's loyal sidekick.  The relationship the two men have is what holds all of these episodes together.  The series also starred William Bakewell as Major Norton, Basil Ruysdael as Andrew Jackson, Pat Hogan as Chief Red Stick, Mike Mazurki as Bigfoot Mason, Hans Conreid as Thimblerig, Nick Cravat as Busted Luck, Kenneth Tobey in two roles as Jim Bowie and Jocko, and Jeff York as Mike Fink.  The DVD offers all five episodes(Davy Crockett, Indian Fighter,  Davy Crockett Goes to Congress, Davy Crockett at the Alamo, Davy Crockett's Keelboat Race, and Davy Crockett and the River Pirates), introductions by Leonard Maltin, an extensive photo gallery, an interview with Fess Parker, and a mini-documentary about the Crockett craze.  Fans of this great tv series should have this DVD in their collection.  Check out this DVD!",1077148800,8,1782,4.8966666666666665
1618815,5,B00005KARG,"Disney outdid themselves in creating a beautiful set like this.  Enclosed in a beautiful tin case, you will get four things:  2 DVD discs, a postcard size poster of the Davy Crockett Movie, ""King of the Wild Frontier,"" and a booklet that includes a letter from Leonard.  I say, begin by putting in the disc.  At the very beginning, there is a preview of three other treasures,  then there is an intro by Leonard Maltin.  The first disc includes the life story of Davy Crockett.  The first episode, aired in 1954, one of the very first Disneyland Television shows.  This show is named ""Davy Crockett Indian Fighter.""  This show is the one that started the whole craze.  When Davy is a vollunteer in the army, he becomes the best one in the army.  They fight indian, but before they would begin actual war, Davy convinces the Creeks to sign a peace treaty.
The second show, also in 1954, was ""Davy Crockett Goes to Congress.""  Here, Davy Crockett leaves his family to go to Teneesee and find a new piece of land.  He has a shooting match against ""Big Foot Mason.""  When Big Foot looses against Davy and ""Old Betsy,""  he takes over Davy's neighbor's property, who is Cherokee.  He and Russel go over and fight him.  Davy sends them to court.  His town wants him to run for state Legislature, then they want him to run for congress.  He wins, and a so-called ""Friend"" sends him on a tour to get the Indian Bill signed to take away indian's lands.  Davy is outraged and returns to Congress to show what this is actually about.
The third and final life story of Crockett is ""Davy Crockett and the Alamo.""  Davy goes to fight with Russel, an indian named Bustedluck, and others.  When they arrive at the Alamo, they last a week before being killed.  Davy gave his life for Texas in the end.
This may seem like the end of the entire series, but it is definetly not.  There are two more.  These two are the legends of Davy Crockett.  The first one was in 1955.  This show was ""Davy Crockett's Keelboat Race.""  He has to race ""King of the River Mike Fink"" down the Ohio down to New Orleans.  They  Somehow win after fights with indians, stopping at towns, and going through dangerous shortcuts.
The final episode ever in the series was ""Davy Crockett and the River Pirates.""  Some River Pirates are disguising themselves as injuns and attacking all boats they could get.  The Chickasaw indians are ready to go to war if Davy can't solve the problem.  He and Mike and his crew get ready for the pirates.  A spy gets on there Keelboat, thinking there is gold in the hull.  It turns out to be rock.  They disguise the boat so the pirates don't know it's Mike Fink's.  They attack the pirates in there cave along they found the treasures they hid.  They kill the head one and the other two are knocked out by Mike.
As if this were not enough, There are bonus features, like a featurette called ""The Davy Crockett Craze.""  Leonard Maltin talks with Paul F. Anderson about the creation of the episodes, merchandise that was for sale, how Leonard loved it as a kid, the song, and the time period.
Another featurette is called ""A Conversation with Fess Parker.""  Leonard joins Fess at his winery in California.  Here they talk about Fess' experience with the show, director Norman Foster, and on publicity tour.  He talks about being at Disneyland at opening day, and amazed that he would sing and dance on live television.
Third, there is a beautiful gallery of photos of the creation of the show, merchandise, and theatrical posters for the two movies.  Davy sure has a lot to know about.  There is a hidden easter egg too.  I'll tell you where it is.  It is on Davy Crockett's Coonskin Cap on the Supplemental menu.
The shows are in superb condition.  They are in color and the sound is stuninng.  That is why I give it five stars, but not just for that, for the material within as well.  Davy Crockett pleased a whole generation.  This will bring it for generations to come!",1040515200,13,3960,4.492977528089888
1618816,5,B00005KARG,".... However, Disney has finally released what I wanted, and I snapped it up without even looking at the price.
The five TV episodes aired when I was five and six years old, and I immediately became one of the millions of kids with coonskin caps, buckskin jackets, and toy flintlocks, and I spent days searching the woods for Indians and guarding the front porch from marauding Mexicans with their ladders. ... Now, almost a half-century later, I got to watch the originals again-and they seem as fresh and new as the first time I saw them. Davy and Georgie in one exciting adventure after another, just enough talking to sustain the plot, right triumphs over wrong, and an unforgettable song that ties everything together periodically.
The story is hardly historically accurate, but who cares? It's also not p.c.: Davy fought Indians and helped establish Texas, which for a short time was a slave state. If they made this movie today, I guess they'd have to drag the viewers through the p.c. mud. But in that sense, frankly, the movie is a refreshing change from the revisionist frontier dreck made today. ...
Davy's ultimate fall at the Alamo was well-staged and quite moving, perhaps a little much for the younger kids, and perhaps the impetus for the softer Mike Fink comedies that followed. And comedies they were, with dozens of comic elements inserted into supposedly serious stories: bad guys slipping on molasses, Mike Fink ripping the top off the bar, Mike's crew in comic book fights, and so on. And though the pirates dressed as Indians rain a hail of bullets on Mike, Davy, and the rest of the good guys, no one is ever hit. But I love it.
The VHS tapes were fine, but the DVD is clearly superior. For me, and I suspect a lot of others of my generation, these are true treasures.

Now, 15 years later, I entreat Disney to release this version, all five episodes, on Blu Ray. They have released the truncated versions on Blu Ray, so why not give the Blu Ray treatment to the clearly superior, and complete, version? Come on, Disney, do the world a favor!",1039996800,6,2066,4.644808743169399
1618817,5,B00005KARG,"Davy Crockett is one of Walt Disney's most endeared and remembered live action characters. He was presented to American audiences by Walt Disney on the Disneyland TV Show in 1954. He was personified by Fess Parker beloved ever after by his sincere portrayal. This colorful and entertaining character was first seen in three episodes from the TV show (""Davy Crockett, Indian Fighter,"" ""Davy Crockett Goes to Congress"" and ""Davy Crockett at the Alamo""). Parker, with his coonskin cap and homespun drawl and witticism created a nationwide phenomenon in 1954. Who can forget ""The Ballad Of Davy Crockett"" composed by George Bruns and Tom Blackburn. Buddy Ebsen played his sidekick George Russel, whose adventures take them from Tennessee to Washington, D.C. to the Alamo in the first three episodes. The series' third episode focusing on the defense of the Alamo, though well remembered, is somewhat labored until we see the final image of Davy Crockett passing into legend and glory. This straightforward and beautifully photographed series expounds the virtues of honesty, integrity and bravery. The country could not get enough of Davy so he and George Russel returned in 1955 for two more episodes (""Davy Crockett's Keel Boat Race"" and ""Davy Crockett and the River Pirates""). For Davy Crockett's second season on television the show was retitled ""The Legends of Davy Crockett."" The necessary title change came about because we had seen Davy come to his end defending the Alamo and Walt Disney wanted to continue bringing us his adventures. ""Davy Crockett's Keel Boat Race"" is about a riverboat race between Davy and another American folklore hero Mike Fink. ""Davy Crockett and the River Pirates"" is about Davy's attempt to stop an Indian uprising with Mike Fink's assistance. In some ways these two episodes are the best. Davy Crockett appears less the frontier fighter and more the good-natured peacemaker in these episodes. The riverboat race with Mike Fink is very entertaining and a high point in Disney's American frontier live action adventures. I don't even think John Ford could have filmed this sequence any better. Kenneth Tobey, who worked with John Ford, is excellent in a great comedic part (Fess Parker made note of Tobey's performance in a supplemental interview on the DVD). Walt Disney gave this actor a chance to demonstrate his great versatility and range as an actor. Also, Mike Fink's boats may look a little familiar since they are the basis for the riverboat ride at the Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World. That's a nice nostalgic tie in! Bert Glennon's cinematography is beautifully picturesque as ever and is matched seamlessly with some very effective glass shot special effects by Peter Ellenshaw. This is one of the best DVDs to come from the Disney vaults. Walt Disney introduces each of the five episodes exactly as they were originally presented on the Disneyland TV Show. The Supplemental Features on this DVD are above and beyond what I had expected. Most of Disney's DVD extras seem to concentrate on the technical aspects of the feature presentation. This DVD focused more on the phenomenon that the legend of Davy Crockett created and the affect it had and continues to have on those who were brought up in those times. There are two exceptional Features: ""A Conversation with Fess Parker"" and ""The Davy Crockett Craze."" ""The Gallery"" of photos and memorabilia is also excellent. ""A Conversation with Fess Parker"" really hit home with me. Fess Parker appeared to be the genuine article that he was. In a world of eroded morals filled with dirt and filth everywhere you turn it was more than comforting to hear Fess Parker's fond recollections of his portrayal and the ideals that Walt immortalized through the tales of this legendary character. If your eyes feel a little watery its because your remembering a time not so long ago when our heroes were real heroes. This is one of the best and should help keep the legend alive for those that lived it, those that loved it and for those that will someday be touched by it.",1019433600,105,4057,4.976435935198822
1618818,5,B00005KARG,"Walt Disney Treasures presents the greatest of all Disney Western Shows, the five great Davy Crockett shows.  This treasure is one not to be missed at all.  Why did I give it five stars? For completeness for Pete's sake.  On this set, you will enjoy all five episodes of this hugely popular series.  Back in 1954, Walt was looking for an American hero for his popular ""Disneyland"" series.  He went reluctantly with Crockett and it turned out to be the greatest fad of all time!  He showed a preview of the show on and original broadcast of the very first ""Disneyland"" program.  During the series, who would be best to play Davy Crockett.  Originally it was Buddy Ebsen, who played Davy's partner Georgie Russel, in the series.  But who would play Davy?  THe answer came when Fess Parker was cast in the film ""Them.""  So when he went to audtition, he was chosen immediately.
Now I told you a little bit of history, I'll finish at the end of the review.  Now we have to do the features:
There are three shows on the first disc.  When you put in the disc, after a brief stint at the Walt Disney Treasures preview, you are in the ""Walt Disney Treasure Theater.""  When the curtain is up you see the Crockett Curtains.  When those part, our host, Leonard Maltin, will tell us what we will see.  Then the curtains close and open again at the main menu.  If you have deaf or hard of hearing in the audience, go to Captions and put them on now.  Then go to the adventures.  Here you will see the first series of the Crockett Saga.  Click on the first one, Davy Crockett, Indian Fighter.  Leanord Maltin will tell you about the show, then you will see the classic ""Disneyland"" television show intros.  Then Walt will tell you what you will see.  After the famous ""Ballad of Davy Crockett,"" he opens Davy's journal for the first story, the indian war.  Watch the show to see what happens.  The shows end just like they originally did.  The same thing happens for the other two shows.  These are ""Davy Crockett Goes to Congress"" and ""Davy Crockett at The Alamo.""  The introductions to the shows are Black and White, but the Crockett portions are color, mostly.
 The second disc is the second series of the saga, ""Crockett Legends,"" and Supplemental Features.  When you get there, go to the captions if you need them, then go to the adventures.  Here you will see the two final shows of the series.  The first one opens the same way like the ones on disc one, except that for some reason, Walt's introductions are color but the end is black and white.  Anyway, the shows are the same way, here are the names, ""Davy Crockett's Keelboat Race"" and ""Davy Crockett and the River Pirates.""  In these episodes, we have Jeff Kurti playing Mike Fink, King of the River.  Then Kenneth Toby, the person who plays Jocko in this episode is the same person who played Jim Boye at the Alamo.  It worked out great though.  Now for the final features.  The supplemental features menu features two featurettes, ""The Crockett Craze"" and ""A Conversation With Fess Parker.""  There is also a gallery and an easter egg.  The easter egg is the preview on the first ""Disneyland"" program for Davy Crockett and the gallery has photos, art, and theatrical posters and merchandise.
Here is the other half of the Crockett history:
Davy Crockett first aired in 1954 and was popular overnight.  There were books, games, towels, coonskin caps, and records, toy guns, anything that you could do with Davy.  Fess and Buddy were at the opening day of Disneyland which you could see on the ""Disneyland USA"" set.  After all of this worn down, Walt created ""Zorro"" and the ""Nine Lives of Elfego Baca.""  These shows were not as popular, but were fun.  I enjoyed the entire series of Davy Crockett.  It know you will too.  So Davy Crockett is still, King of the Wild Fronteir!

I have seen the movie versions; seeing them as originally presented, but colorized, was a treat.  I find the 2nd Disc better than the first, as I prefer the Davy/Fink relationship as well as the beautiful river scenery.  It does seem odd when the show slips from color to an odd black & white, but I feel it just reminds people of how it was originally shown.
I was disappointed in the Fess Parker interview.  Perhaps Fess was not up to it the day he talked.
I did enjoy the talk about the Crockett Craze, as I found it fascinating.  I did feel it was too short, however.
I also don't understand how come 2 discs were necessary; 1 disc should have held all 5 episodes plus the additional commentaries.

While some reviewers didn't care for Leonard Maltin's commentary on the DVD's, I found it provided insight into the tone and characteristics of the 2 different ""runs"" of the show that I might not otherwise have known.  The Fess Parker interview was also a nice addition.  Sure I could look up this information and read about these from another source, but it fits in nicely with this format.

7943013,5,B00005KARG,"Tom Blackburn, my dad, wrote all five screen plays. Originally there were only three episodes, the last ending with Crockett's death at the Alamo. But popularity was so great Walt asked my dad to write two more episodes. After completing on-location filming for the first three and the film crew was back at the studio in Burbank, California, Walt called my dad to his office and explained there was a problem. The director, while on location, didn't get enough footage to complete the 47 minute time requirement for each of the three shows and asked dad what can we do. Dad suggested using existing Crockett sets on sound stages and have a recurring ballad with new story-telling lyrics as the show progressed after the chorus lines. Walt agreed that was a possibility and called in George Bruns, a studio music composer, to see if he and Tom could work together in a hurry because the episodes had already been scheduled to run. Dad quickly wrote a few versus and Geroge put them to music. They presented it to Walt who didn't particularly like it but, being out of time, the Ballad of Davy Crockett was created. The studio was caught completely off guard by thousands of requests for the song. When Crockett came out around 1952. There was also a popular once weekly TV show called This Is Your Hit Parade. The Ballad of Davy Crockett stayed as number one for something like twenty two weeks, the longest of any song in the program's history.

A number of dad's novels have been published in hardback and softback books. Before entering the book, radio, and TV writing business he sold over 900 stories to magazines from around 1938 to about 1950. For Disney he also wrote Andy Burnett, Johnny Tremain and Westward Ho the Wagons.",1516579200,,1732,4.697368421052632

My son was seriously disappointed and I was disappointed with how much I paid for so little.  I enjoyed watching Davy Crockett with my dad as a kid, but didn't realize there were only 5!?!  Just know it's not a long series...",1515024000,,335,4.203125
