7796577,5,1565856368,"Daileader's series on ""The High Middle Ages,"" along with his previous set on ""The Early Middle Ages"" and now most recently with the 2007 release of ""The Late Middle Ages,"" provide nothing less than a superb learning experience for anyone interested in the medieval European period. The series was created with The Teaching Company, an organization that specializes in recording the premier lecturers of the day on a wide variety of subject areas (history, art, philosophy, science, and so on). Daileader's style of delivery is always fascinating, his narrative discourse both knowledgeable and insightful, and his choice of topics an outstanding way to develop an understanding of the issues surrounding this important epoch. Now approaching some 75 individual lectures when the entire three-volume set is combined (late, middle, and high middle ages), the coverage provides us a panoramic view of most all the basic themes of medieval Europe.

Daileader's speaking is highly engaging, and he uses his oratorical skill to weave a rich tapestry of information into a fascinating, and often, humorous, series of lectures. Could learning from a lecture ever be fun? Daileader proves it can be so, to the point we often find ourselves wishing for more at the end of each lecture. It is rare to find someone so conversational in tone while delivering such voluminous amounts of content, but Daileader pulls it off, actually making it look easy, even nonchalant. By immersing yourself in these lectures, you can develop a good understanding of the topic, and also be prepared for subsequent studies of more specific medieval themes. Rip these recordings onto your MP3 player and use them during walks, when going to bed, or simply anytime you wish to learn. It's an ""education in a box,"" and we glimpse what it is like to be in the best classrooms of the best universities every time we listen.

Although it's all good, some of my favorites in these lectures include the discussion of Charlemagne and his role in unifying large portions of Europe as early as 800AD, the rise of the University, Abelard's impact on the development of University of Paris, the Treaty of Verdun and how it presaged the modern borders of Europe, the life of famous monks and ascetics, and the discussion of scholasticism and its attempt to wrestle down the medieval problem of ""universals.""

Let me just say that this is one of the most delightful and informative lectures I've ever heard, and as a person who does a fair amount of lecturing myself, that's quite a compliment. Highly recommended.
