2791644,3,B000O77LWE,"I took in the ""talkie"" version of Cabinet of Dr. Caligari tonight..

Essentially, it's a reworking of the original 1919 film, utilizing a new speaking cast, and via computer superimposing them over the sets. Occasionally new material and sets are meshed in with the original imagery, but on the whole it follows it's source quite closely. This is kind of too bad, because the film actually works best in the scenes that aren't re-imaginings of how the original might have played were it shot with dialog. In fact it supposes that Caligari would have been a rather chatty picture with a lot more exposition than feels comfortable while still draped over the skeleton of the actual 1919 film.

The actors playing Caligari, the somnambulist Cesare, and his fist victim Allen are quite watchable (Daamen J. Krall as Caligari is particularly good). However, the rest are out-of-place and overly mannered even in a film this stylized, and it doesn't help that some of the dialog is wanting.

I'm not opposed to this sort of experimentation, and I don't doubt the sincerity of it's creators, but for me they fell short of pulling it off.",1184803200,3,1130,4.844559585492228
2791645,2,B000O77LWE,"I'm a big fan of the original film and was excited to learn of this digitized remake. The computer imaging and music were exceptional and fully satisfied my expectations for this type of film but the script and acting all but ruined the experience for me. The dialogue and plot seemed forced and fake. Daamen Krall (Caligari) and Doug Jones (Cesare) were wonderful in their roles yet I felt as if their talent was wasted on the weak script. The remaining actors were amateur at best seemed to be drowning in each other's over exaggerated dialogue and motions.
Overall The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (Remix) was a big disappointment.",1184198400,5,629,4.779816513761468
2791646,5,B000O77LWE,"""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cabinet-of-Dr-Caligari/dp/6305075492/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</a>"" is considered to be the first great horror film, but I also think that the 1919 silent film from Germany is the first prime example of ""cinema,"" by which I mean simply treating movies as art.  With its angular sets and the exaggerated performances by the actors representing the dementia of the title character, director Robert Wiene's film is clearly the best example of German Expressionism with its abstract, expressionists designs provide severely angled corners, crooked lines, and objects highlighted by decorative stripes. If ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battleship-Potemkin/dp/6305090033/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battleship Potemkin</a>"" opens us up as students of cinema to the possibilities about montage, then ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" does the same for mise-en-scene. The film also establishes many of the conventions of the horror film (e.g., the mad scientist, beauty and the beast), and when I reviewed it I commented that I was surprised the basic storyline had never been remade.

After watching ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (Remix)"" that statement is still true, because as the parenthetical part of the title points out this particular movie is a ""remix"" and not a ""remake.""  This appellation applies because what director David Lee Fisher did was to shoot his actors against a green screen so that he could use digital scans of the original sets from the 1919 film.  Then he added dialogue and sound to effectively bring the original silent film to life.  Shot in black & white, Fisher's cast eerily resemble their counterparts in the original and I found myself thinking not how a 21st century audience would respond to this film, but what it would have done to one almost a century ago.

Of course the story is exactly the same in Fisher's remix: Daamen J. Krall is the mad doctor, who uses his somnambulist Cesare (Doug Jones, best known for last year's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/El-Laberinto-del-fauno/dp/B00005JPA6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">El Laberinto del fauno</a>"") from his carnival sideshow to so his evil deeds, with Lauren Birkell as the damsel in distress.  The film is framed by a rather clever plot device that turns the narrative upside down in the end, as a young man (Neil Hopkins) tells the story of Dr. Caligari's visit to the small German town of Holstenwall to an older one, as they sit together on a park bench.  The cast also features Judson Pearce Morgan, William Gregory Lee, Richard Herd, and Tim Russ.  There is a concerted effort to act in the style appropriate to the time of the original, albeit with much more physical restraint than was required in the silent era.  The results are certainly uneven, but consistent with the atmosphere of the production, which is a fancy of way of saying on balance it works well within the framework of Fisher's remix.

The only thing you can really compare this 2005 film to would be Gus Van Sant's shot-for-shot remake of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Psycho/dp/B000G3GUAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Psycho</a>"" in 1998, which is not fair because you do not even need to see both films to know who comes out ahead: Fisher wins as soon as you hear the two concepts, because while also following the original shot-for-shot he has added a significant new dimension with sound and dialogue.  The original music by Eban Schletter deserves special mention because after the incorporation of the original backgrounds I thought the music was the most important element in making this remix work.

If you have not seen the original, then I doubt that checking out this remix is going to be worth the effort because you it is pretty difficult to appreciate an homage without knowing the homagee.  But that does not mean you should go out and view them back-to-back.  I did that with ""La Femme Nikita"" and ""Point of No Return,"" which was a mistake.  You need to fully come to terms with the original before you see a different version.  In the end I was tempted not to round up on this remix for two reasons: the first was simply that the original is a classic and as much as I admired this effort it is not on the same level as the classic.  The second reason was that I felt a bit short changed by the extras on the DVD since this time I really did want to know a lot more about how they did it..  However, the bottom line is that Fisher took a big risk with this remix idea and he carried it off big time, so I have to round up.",1181174400,15,4717,5.223841059602649
2791647,4,B000O77LWE,"This is a twist on the 1919 original silent film version of ""Das Cabinet Dr. Caligari"".  The new edition has an updated story plot in which you see the psychological unraveling occurring.  Overall I loved this interpretation. The background and cinematography was as beautiful and artistic as the 1919 version, and it still maintains its German Expressionist roots while updating the story to be engaging.

2791648,1,B000O77LWE,Lame. Laughable really. Stick with the original film. The digital backgrounds look like a bad soap opera. Cinematic feces for the easily amused.,1337126400,2,144,5.304347826086956
2791649,5,B000O77LWE,"I had never heard of either this 2005 film or the 1920 original; it came on a recommendation from Amazon.  Thank you so much, Amazon--you were spot on.  This is an amazing remix of the original film.  By remix, I mean it is the same backdrop and props of the original with the modern day actors digitally superimposed on them.  This may sound hokey, but it was amazing!  The bizarre twisted set of the original combined with the music and acting of the modern made for an unbeatable combination!  The modern superimposition actually made the movie more surreal and bizarre than the original.  (I did rent the original, also, after watching this one)  I like the modern version better  because the filming does not have the grainy, jumpy silent film era texture; the acting is less contrived; the two young male leads are attractive; the music is eery; and the script is nicely done with modern speech.

The actor portraying Caligari is amazing--he looks very similar to the original and has the right combination of insanity and menace.  All of the characters resemble those in the original.  The 2005 make up and acting is styled after the silent film but in a much improved manner.

This film was a real treat.  No sex, gore, etc, just a tense, surreal atmosphere that holds your attention from start to finish.  Well done.",1333411200,2,1325,4.7
2791650,4,B000O77LWE,"A little late I am with the review.  I found a copy of this movie by accident, and finally had a chance to watch it.  I believe it is the second time this movie has been redone (the first remake was in the 60s, and there is a ""sequel"" of sorts in the 80s, ""Dr. Caligari"").

Basically, the film is a ""green screen"" remake (remix) of the classic 1919/20 film.  The largest difference is that it has sound dialogue (along with another cast), but it still holds its Expressionist look quite well.  I have studied German Expressionism in its many media forms somewhat extensively, and my following comments have to deal with what German Expressionism was as an art form.  The ""look"" (maybe ""style"" is a better word) of this movie, (re)done with green screen effects, keeps with the original psychologically-induced discomfort of its classic counterpart.  It's amazing to see the backdrops, as well as many of the smaller details, being (re)used.

I believe my problems with the movie stems from the potential audience base for the movie.  Yes, ""goth"" still plays its part in today's society, but the society of the German Weimar Republic was entirely different.  ""Shell Shock"" cinema, a term used by many, was oriented towards an examination of institutions and entities that created a dehumanization of society.  WWI was a horrible war, with chemical warfare, new technologies (tanks, planes), and, arguably, unnecessary.  The war not only destroyed Empires, turning them to nation-states, but it destroyed the minds of young men who did not truly understand the meanings for what they were fighting, and saw friends blown to bits on a battlefield from hell.  One look at war pictures really puts it into perspective.

The Expressionists visually (and through writing) attempted to show the many problems that society was forced to face, and also the psychological toll from the impact of battle for men that had enormous repercussions.  The silent version ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" was the most important movie that dealt with these problems, and gave a height of terror and horror that truly made this movie a contemporary classic of the time.  It showed the problems with psychiatry (electric-shock therapy was widely used as the only cure).  It showed an uncaring bureaucracy (police officials).  It was simply a psychological tale of social injustice.

One of the problems with the 2005 ""remix"" is that it is more of an interesting ""fad,"" much like the several high-end music videos that gave nods to silent cinema greats (Red Hot Chili Peppers' ""Otherside"" and The Smashing Pumpkins' ""Tonight, Tonight, Tonight"" being the most noted).  There is nothing wrong with giving respect and paying homage to great films, but the context and climate in which the original art form was produced is long gone, and a type of ""nostalgic"" value is put in its place.

To be fair, I really do like these visually-impressive, recent cinematic works (and music videos).  They are much more interesting than most of the major Hollywood features of recent memory, and they do pay great homage to those films that were the backbone of cinematic movements ever since (Film Noir being the most obvious example).  The 1960s remake of the movie was a mess, which took the original film completely out of context!  This 2005 version was really good, regardless of the change of times, because it was paying tribute to a classic, not destroying it for its own ends.

I wasn't that impressed with some acting, but the staginess seems to be in tune with the original acting (paying homage, once again).  Although Klein-Rogge, Krauss, Veidt, and Dagover were all GREAT (and far superior) actors, the acting here doesn't make this movie a horrible mess (although the pierced ear of JP Morgan was annoying to see in close ups).  I thought that Krall did a great job with Krauss' original role, and was a dead ringer for the original character.  I notice some accents, California and (I believe) New York, but many silent actors could not make the change to sound cinema because they had awful voices and, in many cases, couldn't speak English at all (in the case of Hollywood).

Overall, very good work by the director, Fisher.  I can see he put quite a bit of effort in this movie.  However, I would rather just enjoy the original (I have watched it 5 times);  I was not disappointed by what could have been a horrible mess if it weren't for the love of the original.

2791652,5,B000O77LWE,"I was very doubtful that this new version of the classic Caligari would be any good. It seems every time I watch a remake, I am very disappointed.

This movie is the exception.

The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (remix) was very, very good. On every level, everything was done just right. In particular, I am glad it was decided to keep the movie in Black and White. Digital media has brought us new possibilities in video entertainment and this new version of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari proves it. Doug Jones was an extremely effective Cesare along with Damaan Krall as Caligari. Applause to all concerned.",1284336000,4,602,4.669811320754717
2791653,5,B000O77LWE,"I stayed away from this for quite a while since the original film is such a sacred cow and the thought of doing a remake seemed quite ill conceived.  As I started seeing still images from the film I thought it looked pretty good but when I finally watched the trailer I decided to give it a try.  I'm glad I did.  David Fisher has done the impossible, making a remake of Caligari that is faithful to the original and still providing something new and exciting.  The look of the film is incredible and it gives me an odd feeling to watch actors walking about on the original sets.  Its sort of like coming into your own home and finding strangers living there. This film is very faithful looking to the original (as it should be since the sets of the original were scanned for the background of this film).  When new sets have been constructed they look very much like the original sets. The cast, headed by Judson Pearce Morgan are all very good.  The script is intelligent.  The music is quite creapy.  This new version really works on every level and if you are a fan of the original classic film then you should give this one a try.",1266019200,12,1135,4.341232227488152
2791654,5,B000O77LWE,"If you're a fan of the original 1919 horror masterpiece, you may be wondering, is it worth my while to watch this new Caligari?  In my opinion, the answer is a resounding ""yes.""  The experiment here was to take the basic plot and digitally-imaged sets from the original silent film classic, and ""remix"" them with new music, actors, and dialogue.  The new film would preserve the spirit of the original or perhaps add something new and exciting.  I think it did both.

The original Caligari was a wonderful example of Expressionist cinema.  Expressionism displays the emotions of a character or characters by bending the physical reality of what we see on screen.  Thus, the streets, staircases, and rooms in both the original Caligari and the remake are twisted and distorted, representing the skewed perspective created by Francis's madness.  When David Lee Fisher added sound to the film, he skewed the auditory reality in the same way, with great results.

Eban Schletter's beautifully creepy soundtrack, with echoes of Bernard Herrmann and Krzysztof Penderecki, is everything one could ask for in a horror movie of this type.  It puts a fantastic musical spin on Francis's insanity.  The dialogue, with its Kubrick-like formalism, also suggests the terrifying obsessions that exist in the madhouse Francis inhabits.  But it is the weird sound effects that really frost the cake.  When Caligari first appears on screen, the music is accompanied by an eldritch cawing of crows, representing Francis's own fear and disgust of him.  And when Alan enters Francis's home, a distant foghorn blows, even though we are apparently nowhere near the ocean.  The music, coupled with the creepy sound effects and the visuals (everyone in Francis's narration is wearing eerie white makeup that makes them look dead), creates a dreamlike quality that is perfect for this film.

The performances, for the most part, are very good, and some of them are excellent.  Daamen Krall as Caligari is outstanding.  Doug Jones is the perfect choice for Cesare the somnambulist--Jones is this generation's Conrad Veidt (the German actor who played the original Cesare).  Neil Hopkins brings an expressive vulnerability to his portrayal of Alan, Francis's best friend.  And Judson Pierce Morgan does a great and creepy turn as the madman and narrator, Francis Geist.

If you haven't seen the original Caligari, you can still enjoy this very weird and stylish film.  But fans of the original may want to give it a spin as well.",1235174400,9,2501,5.078431372549019
2791655,5,B000O77LWE,"I've seen this done before: When Gus Van Zant took on Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, shooting it frame for frame from the original. I think the acting fell short in that film, and why it was a failure. Remakes are something that Hollywood loves, as much as they want recycled comic book movies. However, this film, using the ""original"" set designs, puts this in a superior quality achievement. It's refreshing to see a filmmaker want to tackle such a unique film. When Nosferatu was remade in in 1979 by Werner Herzog, I think it received the same skepticism. Though I love the original Nosferatu, I still think Werner Herzog's vision was fantastic (I own the DVD), this film goes beyond the blister packing remakes and keeps the same allure as the 1920 version. Of course, this was also remade in 1962 by writer Robert Block and directed by Robert Kay but moves beyond this personal claustrophobic vision. Great film for people who appreciate movie making. I recommend those who have not seen the 1919 (1920) version, should add it to their queue.",1219708800,3,1044,4.773480662983426
2791656,4,B000O77LWE,"As an avid film buff, I was surprised to pick up a copy of ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" and see that it was not a new DVD release of the 1919 German expressionist classic, but rather, a remix (read: remake) produced by a California independent in 2005. I generally keep up with film releases and had never heard a word about this new incarnation of ""Caligari"".  At any rate, I was intrigued enough to buy the DVD. I'm glad that I watched it before getting around to reading some of the reviews here and on IMDB, otherwise I probably would have thought twice about making the purchase.

Having spent no small amount of time sitting through insufferable Hollywood ""blockbusters"" and independent products striving too hard for edginess, I have to say that I was surprised to have enjoyed this version of ""Caligari"" to the degree that I did.  By filming the actors on a green screen and then superimposing their performances over footage from the original, the filmmakers have come up with a remake that is at once homage and yet uniquely original.  The look of the film is gorgeous, with the black and white images of modern actors overlaying the glorious, Expressionistic sets from the 1919 original.

While the modern dialogue, at first, seems incongruous with the turn-of-the-century setting, it soon becomes obvious that this is no normal world but, at best, a timeless place in some parallel dimension where reality is subjective and the landscape itself is distorted.  Personally, I think the dialogue adds to the atmosphere of unease, as does the creepy musical score.  I found most of the performances to be effective, particularly Judson Pearce Morgan as Francis, Daamen Krall as Caligari, and Doug Jones as Cesare. Jones is better known for his amazing non-human characterizations in ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and the ""Hellboy"" films, and his work here, as the murderous somnabulist, is equally mesmerizing.  Less successful, I think, is the performance of Lauren Birkell, as Jane, the object of desire for both Francis and his best friend, Allan.  Though her look is spectacularly eerie--sort of a buxom and grown up Wednesday Addams--Birkell's performance doesn't really work; even when she's supposed to be fully in possession of all her faculties, she's sort of not there.  That should add to her character's otherworldliness, I guess, but instead, it makes her performance seem disinterested, oblique.  In all fairness, I've seen actresses such as Nicole Kidman give equally unsatisfying performances with the same flat line readings, in otherwise excellent (I thought) films.

It is obvious that director David Lee Fisher devoted a great deal of time and care in the planning and execution of this stylish and spookily effective film.  And it's equally obvious that this was a labor of love which I think shows in every detail of this finely crafted ""remix"".  Not only does the movie work as an homage to the original vision of German director, Robert Wiene, but it recalls the recent works of David Lynch as well.  This ""Cabinet"" remix won't work for everybody, particularly most film purists, and those addicted to fast-moving, action-oriented horror films. But for patient audiences interested in seeing something familiar yet different, this latest vision of ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" should prove to be a satisfying experience.  I look forward to seeing future projects from David Lee Fisher.",1191801600,,3407,5.057142857142857

I think seeing the silent mid 1920s version first, gave me a mental biase  to the 'talkie' version of The Bat (the 'talkie' version of The Bat is entitled, The Bat Whispers.)
I think we're dealing with that same bias here. Most of us saw the silent version of, The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari before, we saw the 'talkie' version of it and, this has give us a subconscious bias to anyone who experiments at updating the original.

8183434,2,B000O77LWE,"Around eight years ago when ""Batman Begins"" was released, I complained about the tendency of some filmmakers to explain everything and turn icons of pop culture into celluloid human beings. I did not know that also in 2005, a few months later, David Lee Fisher had released his remake of the German Expressionistic classic, ""Das Kabinett des Doktor Caligari"" (1920), directed by Robert Wiene. I have finally seen it and I can assert that, if there is a clear illustration of the aforementioned fixation, that wrecks propositions and turns them into a mishmash digestible for the minimum common denominator crowd, it is ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" (2005). Nothing could be farther from the intentions of the German filmmakers in early 20th century than this. As it is outlined in Fisher's new adaptation, the protagonist, Francis (played by Judson Pearce Morgan, with trite tics and annoying manias learnt from the Method), constantly blocks the flow of his own subjective world, as it was proposed by Expressionism. Francis spends the whole film trying to find explanations to everything, taken from Psychology 101, a habit that perhaps he acquired from his work in the field of statistics, as he tells his best friend Alan. In the Expressionist subjectivity there are elements of irrationality, but in this exasperating re-reading those components have no place: Francis resists to open his heart and mind to them, to passion and excess, and he fails to recognize (as suggested by her beloved Jane) the strong homoerotic content in his relation with Alan. However, if there is an elemental opportunity that Fisher lost, almost a century after the release of Wienes film, was to stick to the tale of that demented summer in Holstenwall and suppress the explanatory frame (that producer Erich Pommer imposed, as legend goes, to tame the original story of rampant madness by Carl Mayer and Hans Janowitz). But even in this form, Wiene's original went along with the madness of Caligari and the other characters, all submerged in a distorted and oblique world, without the abundant close-ups that have been added to this retelling, following the so-called zero degree style of filmmaking.
As part of this explanatory strategy in cinema, many filmmakers believe that their products, enunciated in English with American accent, will be universally accepted, when what really happens is that their works are self-betraying concoctions that evidence a lazy vulgarity that makes no effort to enrich the films with the understanding of diversity. Everything is uniformed by common ways of their personal culture (which, obviously, is fine and correct to his/her peers), to make all things seem as American as apple pie, be it a vampire story in Romania, of Mayan chiefs in Yucatn or German folks in Holstenwall. The people in this village rent tents in their yearly town fair in dollars, and they relax their t's as if they had their mouths full of peanut butter. This Americanization of the Other has become so common, that most spectators take it as a given. It may be fine for entertainment or for stories about Americans, but for those who, as Fisher, pretend to make art and tell stories in foreign places, many of the results are cheap, coarse, and ugly. In this line of thought, it seems logical that research of the Expressionist acting method was not considered too seriously by anyone in the cast. In particular, this affected badly a key character of the story: the somnambulist Cesare. From the terrifying and virile creation Conrad Veidt made in the original, we were left with Doug Jones' Cesare that, sorry to say, reminded me of Polly Bergen, as if she had had a very bad day, with a cheap wig and make-up. In the end one has to admit that this ""Cabinet"" was, more than anything else, a technical exercise in which contemporary actors were skilfully placed among the Expressionist sets created in 1919 by Walter Rhring, Hermann Warm and Walter Reinamm, whose names do not appear in the credits, and the roles of production designer and art director are taken by two persons whose work may have been quite limited. On the artistic side, the exercise had no impact. If anything distinguishes the 1919 film is that it inaugurated the horror film, that it set a trend in fantastic cinema. and that in terms of lightning, composition and design it had an influence beyond the obvious genres (horror and film noir), that still manifests in some films, not always with good results.

I was hesitant to give this a try but I remember when I saw the original METROPOLIS and the remake one with rock music. The addition of the music and slight muted sepia tones made that a better movie so I thought I would give this a try. Got a gift card for Amazon and it was a cheap price so I thought I might as well try it. Plus I had the free month of PRIME so it was a no-brainer. I like the way they used alot of the original set/pictures. Very creative. The sombulist (sp) looks almost like the original. I thought it was a great remake. There is a nice extra included on the making of the movie which is really worth watching. Since it has been many, many years since I have seen the original I need to get that video in my collection to compare. However, even though I have both METROPOLIS movies I only now watch the the one with rock music (Moroder version). This was tastefully done and really....it is hardly different at all than the original. The only thing I would have liked to have seen added is a slamming soundtrack like METROPOLIS.",1389139200,4,1197,4.186147186147186
