7980190,4,B000089766,A fun mystery/intrigue sailing type of movie.  Entertaining to say the least.  Kim Cattrall is very sexy in this.  The acting is not the best but well worth the time.,1439683200,,166,4.466666666666667

7980192,5,B000089766,Interesting movie. unfortunately I had this DVD replaced three times and still didn't get a copy that wasn't damaged. The outside packaging in perfect condition. The inside product not good. All three replacements were damaged before being sent to me this was evident by the appearance of plastic wrap on DVD being scuffed and bits falling out of the DVD case that were broken. All three replacement copies sent over a two week period sent individually arrived in this manner. Very disappointed in your quality control on this product Amazon.
