8424616,5,B004D0B0JS,"These DVDs are well scripted with great footage of the Pipes of HRH's Scots Dragoon Guard and before.  I'm sure some of the old-timers giving their ""testimonies"" about their WWI piping experiences have gone on to their reward, but they are so interesting.  If you like bagpipe music and/or the history of the GHB, you will get a lot of new knowledge as a result of these DVDs. Go ahead, treat yourself to a wonderful experience.",1398297600,,428,4.618421052631579
8424617,5,B004D0B0JS,I am a piper; with Scottish and British ancestry. THIS DOCUMENTARY IS SECOND TO NONE. Nowhere else will you ever find a better or more thorough Documentary on the bagpipes and their place on the battlefield.,1349222400,,207,4.777777777777778
