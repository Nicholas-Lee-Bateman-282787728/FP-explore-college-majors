58872,5,0783229747,"Everything is 'A' about this movie.  I'm a little embarrased to say that I cried through half the movie (being a guy).  William Hurt & Meryl Streep (& even Renee Z.) all gave the best possible performances of  their roles.  The title didn't really catch my ear, but I thought I'd watch  it based on the cast - I'm glad I did.  I've only seen 2 drama's that I  would rate higher (Titanic & English Patient - neither of which are  strait drama's).  I'm looking forward to watching it again after my tear  ducts refill.",921628800,,516,4.336842105263158
58873,5,0783229747,"ONE TRUE THING could be described as a more thoughtful and quiet TERMS OF ENDEARMENT in the sense that it addresses relationships between mothers and their adult daughters--but this time the dying process is reversed as Kate  Gulden (Streep), beloved wife and homemaker of the June Cleaver/Martha  Stewart variety, is suddenly stricken with cancer.  Her adult daughter  (Zellweger) is asked to come home to help her father deal with daily chores  and, presumably, to prepare for the death vigil.  On the surface, it sounds  like the plot of a network movie, but the performances of Meryl Streep and  Renee Zellweger raise the quality far beyond that. Streep, in particular,  continues to amaze.  After twenty years at the top of her game (and earning  her 11th Oscar nomination for this role), she still finds the heart of  every character and creates the nuances that complement them.  This  performance ranks with her best work in SOPHIE'S CHOICE and THE BRIDGES OF  MADISON COUNTY.  But Ms. Zellweger is no slouch either; though the  character of Ellen Gulden is initially off-putting, this young actress has  enough imagination to show us the evolution of a self-obsessed careerist  (like her father, played incisively by William Hurt) to a mature and  compassionate woman.  As the overlooked son, Tom Everett Scott registers  strongly, as he did in THAT THING YOU DO, with an emotionally poignant turn  as Streep's alter-ego: a son with as much joy of life as his neglected  mother.  The movie also features a lovely, understated score by Cliff  Eidelman and sensitive direction from Carl Franklin, who is a smashing  success in every genre he attempts.  Highly recommended.",919209600,4,1679,5.073529411764706

58883,5,0783229747,"A wonderful story of family and passages, warts and all.  At its core it is the story of a young woman who puts her life on hold to care for her mother, who is dying of cancer.

Made in 1998 and set a decade earlier, it is a story that holds up well over time,  ",1473465600,2,407,3.9390243902439024

Is it as good as the book - about as close as a film can get in my humble opinion.  My 'one true thing' in my life was my mother who gave me all I ever needed - unconditional love.  My parents' marriage was not perfect and I spent a great deal of time being angry with my own Dad just as portrayed in this film by Renee's character.  So I completely related to both book and film on many levels and I believe others will do so as well because how many perfect families exist?  It's definitely a 'Two Thumbs Up' book and film for me.

58940,5,0783229747,"I am sad this film did not receive the recognition it deserves. There are tons of people out there who would give this film a standing ovation if it had been advertised properly. I don't know if a lack of advertising was the problem, however, I assume it  played a role because of how this film performed at the box office. If I had not decided to watch every single film Meryl Streep was nominated for, I myself would have missed this fantastic performance.

As I made my way through the twelve nominated performances I had not yet seen, I came across One True Thing.  It was an incredible film about a daughter and a mother who could not be more different. Meryl Streep's character is the perfect definition of a real mom; she does everything for her children and is a supportive spouse. Her daughter does not appreciate her or the choices she made to take care of children, a husband, and the house; until she learns how hard it is to play a role with so many responsibilities. It is only when Meryl's character is diagnosed with cancer that her daughter begins to understand just how great she is. There is a very emotional scene towards the end when Meryl's character says, "" Oh, I don't want to live like this...This is not living."" Once I saw that scene, I immediately knew Meryl Streep should have won her third Oscar for this performance. It is a powerful movie which can make one become overcome with emotion. I am so glad I watched this performance and am happy to add it to my collection of movies.",1413072000,4,1510,4.444043321299639

So...there's nothing bad about this movie.  Meryl Streep gives her usual impeccably nuanced performance as she plays the role of the sick matriarch, used to taking care of everybody and everything around her and now forced to rely on caregivers.  She is wonderful as she balances between trying to keep a stiff upper lip and remaining cheerful for everyone around her and giving in to the illness that is eating away at her body.  To paraphrase Braveheart, the big C may take her body but she doesn't want it to take her spirit.

Renee Zellweger gives a solid performance as the daughter forced to give up a growing career in New York to come home and take care of her mother.  She plays a daughter desperate for her father's attention, willing to do most anything for a nugget of approval from him.  The dad, played by William Hurt, is sleazy in most every way - but I think Hurt plays him very well.  He's a man who has to deal with failing at both being the perfect husband and with being an accomplished writer.

Watch the three of them interact with each other as they deal with the illness and help each other move through the grieving process and you learn what good actors can do with an okay script.

58982,3,0783229747,"Career hungry young woman is confronted with the competing loyalties of her family and career.

I saw this movie in the theatre when it came out and again now. So my review kinda mixes reactions from both experiences. I can distinctly remember feeling touched by a mainstream movie showing the uncomfortablness but yet love of a grown kid taking care of its parent(s) in the bathtub scene. It was the same the second time around. I mean our sensibilities are that it is very wrong to see our parents naked and vulnerable. But then our love for our parents kicks in when we have to help them do simple things like take a bath or help them to the bathroom. And from watching my mother do the same for her mother when my grandmother moved in I know 1) how very hard it is and 2) how important it is to overcome your objections on many levels. Anyway it is a reality for many people. Some people just shove their aging parents in nursing homes to be ""maintained""  until they die. Others bite the very hard bullet and take care of their parents as they should and nobody else can. And it is VERY VERY hard. But I should mention that this movie was more about a parent that fell ill than just got old.

Anyway I remember then and now also having equally strong emotions about the weird way this movie handled the dad's infidelity. It was so . . . men will be  men. It was liberal moralizing. And it was all too close to the Bill and Hillary Clinton mess for me. It was as if Hollywood was putting its agents out there to make the public OK with Hillary standing by her man as he walked all over her. It was wrong. The movie dealt with this incorrectly too.

But in addition to the above the movie was more simple than that. It showed how fake American families had become chasing the ironic Hollywood image of a life of the ""perfect American family"". It did this on so many levels. Even the Streep character's trip to her friend who had to movie back in with her mom as her husband left her achieved all of this. I mean for a time I can distinctly remember being influenced by the push for all families to be 2 parent 2 kids and 2 kids who went to the best school and had the most important best jobs scene. The SUV. Perfect Ralph Lauren clothes. Five course dinners at night. Involved in every extra-curricular and community activity around. But yet happy, well connect, well grounded families. You were pushed to be inhuman in a way. Robots. Fake. Plastic. But this movie showed that that is really all just temporary at best if you ever really achieved it at all. You could see this in how weak the ""strong demanding father figure"" was. You saw it in the daughter's relationships. You saw it in the son's career choice. You saw it in the marriage of the parents. You saw it in the ""friendships"" of the dad.

And after all that was exposed you saw how we all just eventually come back to the sameness . . . death. maybe grounded in death is a morbid way of putting it.

I'm sure some people will read into this how women are the backbone to families. How strong the mother was when everyone thought she was weak and stupid. And of course her suicide at the end was a big cheering moment for what was back then a big push to make assisted suicide OK. It wasn't then and isn't now. I feel that that really just showed another fake persona in this movie. Someone who wanted to make the perfect dinners, have the perfect house, have the perfect furnishings/clothes . . . criticism of Marth Stewart . . . of sorts . . . but when she realized she was too was as human as the rest of us she couldn't take it and instead of turning to booze like her husband or ""being strong"" and dealing with what God put upon her she downed a bottle of morphene to escape it all. Don't get me wrong I am not saying she had it easy by any means whatsoever. But suicide is weak, not strength.

59004,5,0783229747,"If there was one performance that Meryl Streep deserved an Oscar for it was her role as Kate Gulden in Carl Franklin's  ""One True Thing"". All the adulation she receives from her peers is justified but this is the role that puts her up there with her great predecessors on screen. There is an authenticity to this performance that reminds me of her early prime, the fabulous three that put her on the world stage: ""Kramer versus Kramer"", ""The Deer Hunter"", and ""Sophie's Choice"".

This film is an adaptation of Anna Quindlan's novel about a loving family drifting apart despite their closeness. Misunderstandings, prejudices, careers, weaknesses, will gradually eat into family life in this charming suburban Connecticut home of the Guldens. Streep plays Kate, a resilient, and always pleasant wife and mother. She is greatly loved and appreciated by her children but like all great mothers her kindness, her enormous patience and gentleness, is taken for granted. Despite all this she never loses her grace and generous disposition. Her care will continue to take on that uncompromising quality. She will continue to hold the family together. Her zest for life is undiminished in good times and bad. She will be the moral center that will reign the family in when the times are rough. These scenes of quiet struggle are among the more stirring moments in cinema that I have seen in years.

Her daughter, Ellen (Rene Zellweger), is an aspiring reporter and writer in New York, and Kate's husband (George), played by the great William Hurt, is a Professor of English literature, and an aspiring novelist. Father and daughter are very close; George will  encourage Kate to pursue her writing and both of them pursue their calling with uncompromising passion. George frequently talks about writing over dinner and quotes great authors and epigrams on writing. His impassioned discourses on writing in school, and at home, is eagerly absorbed by Ellen, who will take in all these sayings with complete attention and apply it to pursue her ambitions as a hard-nosed journalist with a keen sense for investigative storytelling.

As Father and daughter team up with common interests they unknowingly condescend to Kate. Kate will in turn take all this in her stride without a fuss. This is vintage Kate Gulden. She will continue to make the home a pleasant one for family and friends. She is a picture of the perfect mother. She does not have any failings. Streep plays this form of perfection with amazing ease. The perfection looks natural, lived in, and never appears pretentious. These scenes are beautifully shown with just that right touch; they never get over-dramatic or sentimental. The Director, Carl Franklin, is busy making his mark in the nineties as the director of the hour with his reinvention of the ""film noir"" genre  with ""Devil in a Blue Dress"" and ""One False Move"". He has wisely let Streep do her thing and the result is absolute magic on screen.

""One True Thing"" marks the return of William Hurt in the strongest role he has had for years. William Hurt's lean patch since the late 1980s is temporarily lifted with Hurt bringing back his acting heft to a role that is tailor made for him. It may be hard to believe for audiences now but he was THE bright star among the pantheon of younger, brilliant, actors taking over Hollywood in the 1980s from Mickey Rourke, Sean Penn, Timothy Hutton, and Jeff Goldblum to Kevin Costner and Tom Cruise. But then his star disappeared inexplicably roughly after ""Broadcast News"" (1988). He returns here as a contemplative, tragic father with sensibilities too delicate to get his imagined novel to the standard he wants to. This introspective, even secretive, husband and father is remarkably suited to Hurt's cerebral persona. A testament to Franklin's eye to see William Hurt in George Gulden.

This is also the second significant role of the rising star, Zellweger, a few years after she has made her stamp in  Hollywood with Tom Cruise in ""Jerry MacGuire"". Now Zellweger is the actor who really carries the film. She more than holds the movie as she drives the narrative between the deeper thematic notes sounded out by these legendary actors. Ellen and George set the contrast, however subtle that may be, to highlight the incredible character that Kate turns out to be.

The film is a meditation on the dissolution of family life. How life inexorably gets in the way of ties that in the end cannot, or will not, be severed. The film's mood is meditative and as such its moral themes are not preachy. The moral thematic notes will unfold with the story with every tragic turn that visits the Guldens.

When Kate is ill, terminally ill, the film handles the bleakness with the same contemplative mood. It feels like the scenes out of Ozu's ""Tokyo Story"", when the mother is ill and the family rally around her. The Guldens come together but not without the pain of converging together around the terrible plight that visits Kate. The daughter's decision to put her career on hold will be at odds with the father fading off into his literary world, into a novel that is not going anyway.  The clash between the inseparably close father and daughter will become the dramatic counterpoint of this tragic story. When George shuts himself in his book, the daughter drifts away from the father. She sees his true colors, his weaknesses, just as she begins to register the quiet strength of a mother who is being consumed by illness. Her decision to not pursue her journalistic career with a vengeance, as she thought she would, haunts her for a time. But in giving that up she opens up to her mother.

In a cinematic tour-de-force of acting and direction this film closes in to the climax with surprises, and real discoveries. Weaknesses and strengths are shuffled around but no judgments are made. Kate will ensure that. There is a consistent note of reconciliation as we are taken into the downward spiral of a disease that gets uglier with every passing day. Unexpectedly, in these scenes of disaster Ellen gets a glimpse of that one true thing in her life, just in time, before it slips away.",1359072000,,6146,4.847473784556721

59013,2,0783229747,"I gather from some other reviewers that I should have read the book first, but now I have no desire to read the book after the movie left me feeling so unsatisfied.  I guess I just didn't ""get"" this movie.  What I got at the beginning was that Ellen loves her mother but is positive she never wants to become her mother.  I definitely got that Ellen was justifiably enraged as she became aware of her father's transgressions against his marriage and his family, and his demands that Ellen move home and take care of not only her mother's needs but his as well.  Meryl Streep was endearing as Ellen's dying mother and I felt admiration for how she expertly cares for everyone around her and makes it seem so effortless, and I get Ellen's frustration with trying to step in and do all the things her mother does when it feels so unnatural and unappreciated.  (""I cooked the whole Thanksgiving dinner and no one even noticed!"")  But in the end, the mother passes away and nothing really seems resolved.  Ellen will return to her life, perhaps wiser but probably with lingering bitterness.  Her father will no doubt return to his same routine, feeling sadness at having lost his wife but in no way devastated by it, and though it seems that Ellen's anger toward him has dissipated at the end, I didn't feel like their differences were at all resolved. Also I would have liked to have seen a stronger bond develop between Ellen and her brother, but we don't even see him after the mother's death.  And the whole question of who, if anyone, helped administer the overdose of morphine - I guess that was supposed to illustrate a final act of love and sacrifice from the woman who took care of everyone and everything - but to me it just seemed a pointless part of the story.

59021,3,0783229747,"`One True Thing' is a familiar piece of family tensions that erode relationships only to reveal stronger connections and everlasting bonds.  It is handled with manipulative casualness, which strips away some of the honesty and gives it the appearance of heavy handed falsities.  `One True Thing' tries so hard that it loses the `true' part of the equation.  The performances are strong, especially from Zellweger, who undergoes some serious emotional shifts throughout the film, and she handles them with ease (she would have made a far more inspired Oscar nominee, as opposed to the always great but often over-nominated Streep).  Hurt is his usual self (with so much promise in the 80's, he fell into predictable shtick) and Streep tugs heartstrings with calculated fervor.  The thing is, when all is said and done, this film isn't memorable.  It just isn't a great movie.  I agree that the police angle was a misstep, but it wasn't the most grievous.  The film's internal tone just needed to be lifted from the obvious.  It is too apparent what the film wants you to feel, even within the plot manipulations that should read as honest twists (like with regard to Hurt's character and his apparent lack of concern); they come across too weighted down by the filmmakers intentions.  Insert scene, project sadness, receive bounteous tears; that is the whole objective of this film and it works well on that front, but when I walked away from the film I forgot most of what I felt because it never felt `real'.",1302652800,,1509,4.859375
59022,5,0783229747,"I have simply adored this movie from the first viewing.  Meryl Streep is amazing and totally committed to her role, as usual.  She always impresses me because every character she plays is truly unique from the others.  She creates characters in a way that few other characters do, and it adds so much to her films.  This is no exception.  Renee Z does a fine job (in an early role for her), too.  As the daughter re-assimilates into her childhood home to care for her ailing mother, she sees her family in new (and more accurate) ways, faces questions old and new for her, and discovers her mother's questions as well (as she also begins to truly discover her mother for the first time).  It really brings up a variety of feminist and independency questions, but abstains from providing answers.  As a viewer, I feel and support Ellie's outrage at being put in care-giving (career-sacrificing) roles simply because she's ""the girl"", but I also get to see the strength both she and her mother exhibit in those care giving roles. At one point, Streep's character laments that Alcott is less sympathetic to Meg than Jo ""because she has babies,"" expressing--slightly--her own frustrations from not being appreciated.  It's interesting to see Ellie become stronger and more independent and outspoken (differentiating more from her father) even as she grows to appreciate her own seemingly unliberated mother.",1301875200,,1403,4.961538461538462
59023,5,0783229747,"Meryl Streep  can command the screen in nearly any role and does so yet as as dying mother, Kate Gulden, who has put aside any passion for working outside the home in order to focus on her family. Her daughter, Ellen, is exactly the opposite, with all the ambition that she thinks her mother lacks. She is a rising star as a writer in New York and has questionable ethics, willing to do nearly anything to get ahead. She also has a reputation for being cold and unfeeling.

Ellen has never truly respected her mother but always adored her father, a college professor who seemed so much more heroic and larger than life than her mother. It is only when Ellen comes home, at her father George's insistence that she help take care of her mother that Ellen starts to see the family dynamics that eluded her all these years.

Rather than being a ""simple housewife"" Ellen begins to realize that her Kate Gulden is not only the heart of the home but perhaps the strongest one there. She is a major part of the community and doesn't just keep house but makes sure that those she loves are treated to warmth and love beyond what her father can provide. He is only able to be successful because she is there to watch his back. When Ellen tries to keep house like her mother she quickly becomes overwhelmed and understands that baking a meal or decorating a Christmas tree involves far more than going through the motions. These supposedly easy activities take true caring and commitment to others' happiness.

If you've read the book - as I have- perhaps you'll get additional pleasure from watching Streep and Zellweiger in their roles (William Hurt is also excellent). Some have called Zellweger stiff in her part but she is playing a woman who is shut off from her emotions and has a hard time facing harsh truths. Wouldn't such a woman be a bit restrained, apparently emotionless at times? She even turns away from her mother's pain until forced to confront it. In a way, only by taking care of her mother as she dies is Ellen able to evolve and soften, seeing how her mother is not as simple or restricted as Ellen always believed. Kate's life is indeed rich and complex - perhaps far more than Ellen's work and ambitions.

If you haven't read the book the ending may be a stunner. For that reason, I won't disclose anything about that. My favorite lines are:""""It's so much easier to be happy. It's so much easier to choose to love the things that you have, instead of always yearning for what you're missing, or what it is that you're imagining you're missing. It is so much more peaceful."" These lines make clear why Ellen's mother has chosen her path in life and I wish I could remember those lines every day of MY life rather than yearning for more.

59029,5,0783229747,"This is an interesting story about a young woman, Ellen, (played by Renee Zellwegger) who has grown up idolizing her father, a writer and college professor.  She follows in his footsteps, in a way, by going to New York where she has become a successful journalist.  When she goes home, reluctantly, for the holidaes, she shows the impatience of a young woman of her generation and lifestyle for that of her mother (Meryl Streep).  Her mother is a happy, stay at home mom, who excells at homemaking and dotes on making everyone else comfortable.  Totally not-ok with Ellen.

When she is still at home, her mother receives a diagnosis of cancer and her father, (William Hurt) asks Ellen to give up her job and life in NY to stay with them and take care of the Mom.

What follows is a beautifully told tale of the shift in perspective of Ellen as she struggles to take care of her mother, not because she wants to, but because her father has asked and because it's the right thing to do.  Along the way, her father falls off the pedestal and the whole family dynamic is re-arranged.

This could have been terribly maudlin but due to the sensitive direction, I guess, and the all-star cast, it succeeds as an extremely moving film.  Streep is always good and Hurt is wonderful in a difficult, many layered role.  If I have any criticism of the film, it's that I wish it had gone further into the character of the father.  Maybe the book does.  Renee Zellwegger does a fine job, too.  Some people think she isn't convincing as the hard-nose career girl she's supposed to be, but I think she carries it off pretty well.  She is at her best in the tremendously emotional scenes.  The scene at the town Christmas tree lighting is priceless.  (bring Kleenex)

Especially when the scene where the mother talks with her daughter about why she still loves her father even though she knows everything about him. Here's a line I will remember for a long time - ""There is so much to be happy about what you have..."". At the same time, I was angry at the father who in my opinion did not understand his wife's love for him. He was too proud. Even on the night when he was sitting drunk in a bar while his wife is in pain, all he was mad about was some famous author not remembering his book. At times like these, you want to jump off your seat and just lecture this guy about what life is about. I was also upset to see that he did not stay with his wife through the night, especially on her last night. Especially when she accepted him as a drunk husband, the night before. What love!

I have not been in a situation of giving care to a cancer patient. But after watching this movie, I know that if that option comes my way, I will do it! Love is Sacrifice. And this movie depicts an important aspect of that sacrifice.

The sad thing about such movies is this - We move on after being affected for a couple of days and then forget all about it. Our personal lives have become tangled and busy to let such a movie impact us for good. Sad.",1229990400,3,1328,4.123552123552123
59043,5,0783229747,"One True Thing tells the touching and sensitive story of how a young woman (Ellen Gulden, played by Rene Zellweger) comes to understand her parents and their relationship with each other when a crisis strikes the family. The acting is superb; and the cast is full of top-notch actors: Ellen's mother Kate Gulden is played by Meryl Streep; and Kate's father George Gulden is played by William Hurt. Look also for a fine performance by Tom Everett Scott as Ellen's brother Brian Gulden.

When the action starts, a tough as nails and ambitious Ellen Gulden comes home for her father's surprise birthday party. Despite the fact that she looks up to her father as a great writer, the fact remains that Ellen doesn't truly value her parent's lifestyle. In fact, Ellen even acts ambivalently at best without apologies toward her mother Kate who is clearly cherishing traditional values of motherhood that clash sharply with Ellen's values of climbing the corporate ladder as a single woman in a world where it's ""dog-eat-dog.""

Although Ellen returns to her high pressure job in New York City after the party, it is not long before her father George calls her back home--and this time George wants Ellen to stay a while. Sadly, Ellen's mother Kate has been stricken with an incurable form of cancer and George is too selfish to take nay responsibility for his wife's care. Ellen resents being ""stuck with"" her sick mother; and she slowly comes to realize that her father George doesn't exactly deserve to be on that pedestal she put him on. Ellen must deal with realizations and the truth about her parents and their marriage that she never dreamed of--for example, her father's endless ""flings"" with younger woman at the college where he teaches understandably upset Ellen. Moreover, Ellen finally breaks down just enough to ask her ailing mother just how she (Kate, her mother) manages to do all the household work. Ellen comes to realize that household work is truly a challenge in certain ways. The scene in which Kate talks to her daughter Ellen about the understanding, work and compromise that make a marriage successful is particularly powerful.

What happens when Ellen's mother Kate is in her final days? Can Ellen and George take the stress or do they fail to rise to the occasion? Moreover, throughout the movie Ellen is seen talking with the local District Attorney about exactly how her mother died--it seems that Kate died of a morphine overdose. This, of course, creates a ""flashback"" type of movie. Did Ellen or George intentionally give Kate an overdose to help her end her suffering? The answer may surprise you.

The DVD comes with a few extras; I really enjoyed the featurette in which the principle actors discuss their feelings about the film and working with each other. We get information about the careers of the actors and producer Carl Franklin gives his thoughts about the movie as well.

Overall, One True Thing is a movie with brilliant performances by all the actors and the movie thoughtfully examines the relationship dynamics within the Gulden family. We learn that in many families, not just the Gulden family, things are not what they always seem to be; and we learn how Ellen slowly but surely becomes a better person for having had a chance to truly get to know her parents, especially the mother she used to devalue so much.",1227916800,,3357,4.851657940663176

59048,5,0783229747,"One True Thing was released in 1998 (two years after Jerry McGuire) and stars Renee Zellweger and Meryl Streep. Renee portrays Ellen Gulden (or Ellie as her family calls her), a moxie journalist living in New York. She goes home to visit her family for the holidays and finds out her mother (Meryl) has cancer. Her father demands that she give up everything to move back home and take care of her mother. Because she adores her father and longs for his respect she does it.

One True Thing is beautifully filmed and acted. Without giving too much information, it is filmed from the perspective of Ellen as she's being interviewed by a lawyer about her mother's death. Her flashbacks are quite different from the words coming out of her mouth.

Ellie's mother has always been more of a silly inconvenience to her. As she begins to get to know her mother and see her father through adult eyes she realizes she has missed out on a truly fabulous woman. She also begins to discover the kind of woman she has grown into and what she wants out of her own life. I found this film interesting, entertaining and emotionally moving.

Gilmore Girls starlet, Lauren Graham makes an appearance as the loyal best friend, Tom Everett Scott plays Ellen's impressionable brother and William Hurt her emotionally detached father.

Professor Gulden has a phony, fake, false, make-believe job as a English college professor teaching classes where students read a few books and somehow they a ""journey"".  Professor Gulden is the stereotypical egghead or rather pinhead found on many colleges campuses who hold fake jobs and do not actually make a living like everyone else.

She is truly a star of the utmost brilliance and in reality should win an Oscar for any movie she's in...she's that good.

 The movie does not approach death in the typical maudlin fashion. Based on the book by Anna Quindlen, the story revolves around Meryl's daughter, played brilliantly by Renee Zellweger, as she is forced to come home and take care of her mother at the demand, not request, of her father, also beautifully nuanced by William Hurt. Here you have three Oscar winners showing why they have the statues on their mantels.

 I agree that the plot device of questioning Renee on the chance she helped her mother die is not necessary, but Zellweger's approach is so painfully etched, it doesn't hurt the movie. Tom Everett Scott as Brian, the son, is truly remarkable in an understated performance. His presence at the Christmas tree lighting is powerful in its silence. Hurt and Streep dancing to Bette Midler's ""Do You Wanna Dance"" is also very poignant and touching.

 Director Carl Franklin keeps everything subtle and controlled, and isn't it ironic that Bette Midler sings the movie's theme song. I like syrupy ballads, so I appreciated this one, too.

 ONE TRUE THING may be a ""chick flick"", but anyone who appreciates unparallelled acting and a good story will admire this film.",1090886400,3,1531,4.750943396226415
59072,5,0783229747,"If there's one actress that can get into the skin of her character, Streep is it. She effortlessly portays a regular housewife, embroidering pillows and decorating cribs one minute, and being a veritable fountain of love and understanding the next! William Hurt turns in a convincing performance too, as the aloof and careless Regular Husband, while Zellweger adds a mean punch with her rich and dynamic presence.
The theme is hardly anything earth-shattering, but there's a fine line between the genuinely moving and the saccharine, and under Franklin's low-key direction ""One True Thing"" succeeds where many pictures fail by maintaining its dignity and, just as importantly, its honesty. You won't cry out of a sense of obligation, but because the incredible cast drive the material straight to the heart.
Highly recommended if you're in the mood for a stirring ""Ordinary People"" type of a drama. Keep a Kleenex handy.",1087603200,12,920,5.181208053691275
59073,4,0783229747,"This was a really nice dramatic movie which Meryl Streep truly shines in. The movie also stars Renee Zellweger and William Hurt. Zellweger plays a workaholic who lives in New York, and goes home to visit her family for her father's (Hurt) birthday. She learns that her mother (Streep) has cancer and her father asks her to move home to take care of him, thus leaving her career, life and boyfriend behind in New York. Zellweger plays a cold character who is distant from her family, but she has to hold it together for all of them. She soon learns how much her mother does day to day, and finds herself growing with resentment towards her father who takes no part in helping or caring for his wife. He also has affairs and is emotionally distant from the family. The movie focuses mainly on the women, so you find yourself relating to them more than the father. The movie was well done and Streep stole the performance as the dying mother, nothing short of excellent work as usual. My only complaint is the way the scenes are put together. The movie starts in 1988 where Zellweger's character is talking to a lawyer, and then you watch the past and see the story interjected between these scenes, which cuts between the drama and is not very effective in my opinion. Also, in the end when the mother dies from drug overdose, the daughter believes her father did it, and vice versa. It was not explained very well or even exposed that the mother was the one who did it, it just seemed to sneak in right at the end. Overall a good movie though.",1078790400,3,1542,4.4522968197879855
59074,5,0783229747,"The first time I watched this film it was the 3rd movie we were watching in a marathon.  I promised myself I would let myself fall asleep...and with the slow beginning I thought I was well on my way to dreamland.  HOWEVER,something about the movie kept my attention, and by the end I was astounded by new revelations.
I watched this film again recently, and again I was amazed at all that this movie accomplishes in a very understated way.  At a time when I personally feel frustrated at all the preachiness I see going on in literature and movies, I am a champion of this masterpiece.  This film engaged me, brought me through a rich journey, and left me as a changed person...all without telling me what I should take away from the film.
For a little more background, the storyline is as follows: an up-and-coming NYC journalist (Zellweger) goes home to celebrate her father's birthday in a small town.  She despises the vulgar simplicity of the town, her mother, the costume party, etc.  However, she absolutely idolizes her father, who is a well-known English professor at a nearby university.
However, while she is at home, her beloved father coerces her to put her budding career on hold so she can take care of her mother (Streep), who she learns is battling cancer.  Zellweger's character is openly angered & offended by this request...which is just the beginning of script filled with a refreshingly honest look at our ugly, selfish & occassionally brilliant emotions in such situations.
In coming to stay with her mother, Zellweger continues to despise the ignoble life of women's meetings, town decorating, baking, etc. that she is forced to join.  Up to this point in the movie, everything is as you might predict or expect in the storyline.  However, where the movie goes from here is absolutely phenomenal.  As this daughter lives in her mom's world and begins to understand her mother's very understated, unacademic life, she is opened to whole new worlds of humanity.  At the same time, as her opinion of her mother rises, her opinion of her father comes into question.  As the movie explores this whole dynamic, more twists come and this daughter is overwhelmed by the complexity of relationships & adult life.  No one is right.  No one is wrong.  Nothing is simple, and everyone struggles as he fights his own demons.
At the very end, this movie shows (not preaches but shows) an absolutely breath-taking portrayal of love well after the rose-tinted glasses have come off.  I don't want to give anything away, but it's when Streep wraps her arms around her husband after his late night out.  After being barraged with so many images of Hollywood love, the daughter (and the audience) is speechless at a protrayal of deep, full, rich love that has grown in the face of so much pain & struggle of life.
This might admittedly be more of a girl's movie than a guy's.  One of my guy friends only stayed awake because of the DA interrogation of the daughter interspersed throughout the film.  However, many, many of my girlfriends who hate chick flicks were as pierced by this movie as I was.  (Many of them have also dismissed their mother's maternal role in their lives and have idolized their fathers.)
I simply can't express in words how wonderful and paniful and majestic this piece is.  And it's so refreshing because it goes where so many films aren't willing to go - to the stuff of our true, everyday lives & situations that aren't glamorous but are filled with ugly emotions, pride, and underestimations of others.",1074988800,29,3536,4.754500818330605
59075,5,0783229747,"Based on the novel by the same name by Anna Quindlen, One True Thing is about family relationships, especially that of the daughter (Renee Zellweger) with her parents. She's left home to establish herself as a promising young writer, but duty pulls her home (actually, unwilling/unable to do it himself, her father commands her to put her life on hold, come home, and care for her mother) to care for her mother (Streep) who is dying of cancer. William Hurt plays the father well; he seems to excel in playing roles of men who are distant and/or unavailable. What drives this story is anger and resentment and duty - and love. There's a twist, the possibility that someone (perhaps Mom herself) slipped Mom a fatal teaspoon of morphine, but you know? It was never conclusively proved or disproved, and it really didn't matter.
Very, very good movie.",1069459200,6,849,4.782312925170068
59076,5,0783229747,"Since I became very interested in Renee Zellweger, I had decided to rent this, and I thought it was such a beuatiful movie. After learning that her mother has cancer, Ellen (Zellweger) is asked by her father (William Hurt) to come back home to care for her. At first, she refuses, but finds the strength to do go home, and in the process begins to have a more loving relationship with her mother that she never really had before. I had never watched many of Meryl Streeps movies before, but just watching her playout this character who is indeed suffering a great deal made me totally upset, and like Ellen you wish so much to want to help her even if you can't. However, when I think more of it, it really is better to have loved than to have lost. And in a very beautiful way, both Ellen and her mother found that bond which will always be with them. I wish I could review more, but in a way as I write this, I am feeling a little emotional over it. There really are no other words. Except one love: love. I guess less is more.",1024531200,2,1029,4.202020202020202
59077,5,0783229747,"""One True Thing""  beautifully and poignantly demonstrates that appearances can be deceiving, and that what one sees on the surface doesn't necessarily reflect the deeper truth. In this brilliantly acted film, Zellweger (the daughter), discovers that her notions about her parents (Streep and Hurt) and about marriage in general were illusions, and, in turn, comes to a greater understanding of both her parents and the realities of marriage.
Zellweger's relationship with her mother was always strained. and she looked down upon her mother's life thinking it provincial and small. Her father, the college department head and National Book Award winner, however, was put on a pedestal, appearing larger than life to her. When Zellweger moves back home to nurse her dying mother, she painfully discovers that her father treats her accomplishments as ""small"" and irrelevant (comparable to her view of her mother), and that he is far removed from her idealized image of him. She, in turn, comes to a new admiration and appreciation for her mother's perserverance and wisdom about life.
Streep, one of our greatest actresses, can communicate more with a look on her expressive face than most actresses can with hours of dialogue. Zellweger, another talented performer, more than holds her own with the formidable acting talents of Streep. The two of them together create scenes of enormous power and emotional energy. They make this perceptive and absorbing film an unforgettable experience.",1013904000,58,1486,5.323404255319149
59078,4,0783229747,"I recall that when Meryl Streep was doing publicity for this film a few years ago, she cracked that when she first got the script, she assumed that she would be playing the daughter. In point of fact, if the film had been made twenty years before, she would have been perfect for the part of the ambitious young journalist, whose father virtually drafts her to return home and care for her deathly ill mother. Streep's patrician good-looks, her sharp features and cool air would have been perfect for the young Ellen Gulden.
Not that's she's bad as a suburban matron--Streep can pretty much pull any role off with aplomb. As the dutiful wife of self-obsessed English professor with literary aspirations, she never rings a false note. And it's remarkable that when she complains about how female faculty members in her husband department often seem to look down their noses at a ""mere"" faculty wife, it rings true. Streep, of course, radiates intelligence, and there is a certain irony in the fact that her character is made to feel less than adequate, at least momentarily, when in fact she is likely the intellectual equal of any of them.
As far as casting somewhat against type goes, there has been considerable discussion over the choice of Renee Zellweger to portray the ambitious journalist daughter. Well, aside from the fact that she looks nothing like Streep (though she could pass for William Hurt's child, I suppose), she is actually much better in the part than I would have guessed. We should not assume that all young women journalists are tough-as-nails dames who never betray an emotion. Zellweger actually reminds me a little of the author of the novel on which this film was based (and who also contributed to the screenplay). Anna Quindlen herself has always seemed to me to be an affable soul in many ways. Doesn't mean that she can't make a deadline or hold her own in a smoke filled room.
A good word should be added for William Hurt's work here. He could easily have just come off as the villain in this piece. He is certainly capable of being an insensitive clod, but Hurt does bring a certain pathos to his character and certainly would have developed him more had he had just a little more screen time.",1012694400,2,2227,4.698209718670077

59080,4,0783229747,"This adaptation of Anna Quindlen's novel of a daughter coming to terms with her mother's fatal illness is boosted immeasurably by Meryl Streep. As a wife and mother dying slowly, agonizingly of cancer, she turns in her by now expected superb performance; even so, there are scenes that amaze. When Streep, whose entire identity has been formed around her skills at running a household, instructs daughter Renee Zellweger on how to have a wedding that she will never have the chance to organize or preside over, her words, delivered without an ounce of false sentiment, will draw tears from the hardest-hearted viewer.
The film is fortunate to have Streep on hand, as she does much to alleviate weaknesses elsewhere. The structure and tone of Quindlen's book has been somewhat altered, not to its advantage. Hurt, playing the philandering father, comes off as more of a weakling and charlatan in the film script, thus skewing the emotional balance toward the women in the family. The mystery of whether someone in the family committed a mercy killing is clumsily handled, dealt with in segments showing Zellweger being interviewed by a police official that interrupt the flow of the drama. Finally, Zellweger herself, though sympathetic and a worthy foil for Streep, is not altogether convincing as a driven career woman. Still, the underlying truths about life, death and family, as brought forth by Meryl Streep's luminous performance, make this a drama worth savoring.",988243200,10,1470,5.129166666666666
59081,2,0783229747,"I expected something more from this film. Meryl Streep is always good, so she cannot be faulted. She plays a housewife and mother who adores happiness and doing things that are kind and good and loves to be the housewife. She becomes ill with cancer, and her semi-distant daughter, played by Rene Zellweger, comes home to take care of her. The problem here is that Zellweger is not believable in this role. She is supposed to be a hard-hearted and aggressive New York magazine reporter. She supposedly has a reputation as being very cold and heartless, but she does not give this character any convincing hardness. It is hard to picture Zellweger in any kind of role like that. She is just too sweet. She sometimes rolls her eyes and gets impatient with things, but she just looks too sweet and compassionate to make us believe that she could ever be an aggressive go-getter. William Hurt is Streep's husband and Zellweger's father. She idolised him and during her tenure as her mother's nurse, she learns a lot of unsavoury things about him. The film is very much about her coming to terms with her illusions about the family and what she felt about them. It also is about her coming to terms with who she is, but it is just so mushy. There are no clear cut lines of where this film is trying to go. Naturally Streep dies and all is basically ironed out, but the film is just so... unmoving.

If you want to pay attention to subtle dialouge details, be enthralled with rich, textural cinematography and possibly weep at  moments so close to your heart, it hurts, actually hurts, add ""One  True Thing"" to your video collection.
This film adaptation of Anna  Quindlen's book may be considered a ""chick flick""--and those  viewers may cluck all they like. But once in a while, I like to be moved,  deeply moved. And this cast does that: William Hurt, Meryl Streep, and  Reneee Zellweger (of Jerry Maguire fame), encircle a plot like campers  tending a continuous fire. Each doing their part to kindle, fan, and  eventually stare into dying embers.
One of my favorite scenes of this  ""daughter comes home to take care of dying mother, realizing her  perfect father has faults of his own"" drama, is when William Hurt  reaches for Meryl Streep's fragile hand, a rare reassurance of his love,  and ever so slowly swirls her to Bette Midler's rendition of ""Do You  Wanna Dance"".
I watched this film with yearning. Craving chances not  taken with issues regarding my own mother. She did not die of cancer--she  died of her own hand by pills, in my arms. I best stop here. Got  tissues?

59094,5,0783229747,"It seems less and less frequently that we get to see a superbly assembled cast of actors united in a story that tells itself in terms of its human interest, level of drama, and opportunity to learn something from the  characters about the nature of life, relationships, and ultimately about  ourselves. This movie offers such an opportunity. All of the cast memebers,  but especially Meryl Streep and William Hurt, do an outstanding job in  presenting this tale of a family in crisis, and the hidden secrets,  weaknesses and strengths of its members and their enduring bonds to each  other. The photography is well done, and the sound is excellent as well.
This is a worthwhile and serious movie, involving some interesting  intellectual issues about how the needs of a family of strong but loving  individuals and quite strong and needy personalities clash and interact  with each other over an increasingly critical stage of terminal illness for  the matriarchal mother of this modern American family. Overall, then, I  recommend this as an absorbing examination of an intellectual family with a  range of family issues such as rilvary, and a number of hidden dimensions  to the relationships within the family itself. It is painful to watch each  of them struggle to deal with a member's decline and death due to cancer.

This mother, played by a sumptuous Meryl Streep, has  dedicated her life to her husband and her two children, sacrificing herself  for a selfish family.
Along with Renee Zellweger, we will discover what  is hidden behind the boring everyday life of that woman. Discreetly, Carl  Franklin's camera chases the little tragedies and joys of human condition  and reminds us that life is not worth living without mutual tolerance.

Although the film starts off very slowly, l was  intrigued with the struggle and friction that exists within a family.
