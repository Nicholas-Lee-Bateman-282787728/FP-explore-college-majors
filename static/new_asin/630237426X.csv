457553,4,630237426X,"This video is a MUST for any music/concert lover.  Throughout, Prince and his band, The Revolution, shake their booties and shock us with outrageous performances including such classics as ""Purple Rain"",  ""Little Red Corvette & ""I Would Die 4 U"", as well as  unreleased gems such as ""Possessed"" & B-side beauties,  ""How Come U Don't Call Me Anymore?""  The video features Sheila E.  adding Latin flavour to Prince's musical genius.  This video will appeal to  a large audience and has something for everyone.  In the words of another  of his videos, this is truly a ""sign of the times""!",955670400,,585,4.818181818181818

457639,5,630237426X,"""Hello Chicago. My name is Prince, and I want to play with you."" With those words from off stage, Prince begans his concert to the loudest chorus of screams I had ever heard in my life. If you want to see Prince, and arguable his best band the Revolution, at the height of his powers and exploding onto the scene, then you have to see this for yourself. I own this recording and also saw this tour when it came through Chicago. This was easily one of the best, if not loudest, concerts I've ever been to. We had 10th row center seats and our ears rang for 15 days afterwards. This concert recording captures it beautifully. The first 30 minutes as he goes from one great song right into another still gives me chills. It's inevitable that Prince is going to take things over the top from time to time during the show. After all he is a shameless, and often self-indulgent performer but he is also one of the most talented musicians and most captivating, gifted live performers that has ever hit the stage. With every smirk, wink, note and brilliant solo Prince owns the stage and the audience. Why this concert recording hasn't been remastered and re-released is a mystery to me.",1235865600,,1179,4.488372093023256
457640,5,630237426X,This video has alot of sentimental value to me since I was there as a little 15 year old singing my heart out to Purple Rain. Purple Rain shows that Prince is capable of playing guitar as well as any Rock guitarist. My only gripe with him today is Prince very rarely these days goes over the 6 minute mark with Purple Rain its sad he no longer cares to carry the solo for that song over his set time limit. I saw him in 1984 in Atlanta Georgia with my dad and he did a nealy 24 minute version of Purple Rain I will never forget it the solo alone clocked in at 18 minutes and Eddie Van Halen would have been stunned and thats the Prince I love and remember. And for the person who said Prince wasn't playing his guitar I beg to differ I was there up close and personal you weren't I saw it all he was playing that guitar. Ever heard of cordless? Anyway get this video it is a bit self indulgent o Princes part but hey thats rock and roll and its worth every minute  of it,1231632000,,970,3.9743589743589745

457642,5,630237426X,"Even after all these years, Purple Rain is still my personal fav. album of all time. This concert captures Prince at, I feel, his very best. Still new, still fresh, and all 80's, the performance and music still holds up REALLY well today. I do wish this were out on DVD, remastered for better sound and video. As it is, the video is a little blurry, although that could be due to VHS. All in all, a good watch if you grew up in the 1980s'",1187827200,,438,4.104651162790698

457645,5,630237426X,"SIGN O' THE TIMES was an excellent ""concert movie""... but, as we all know, alot of it was re-shot and re-filmed with prince lip synching.  THIS, however, was NOT a lip synched concert (to the idiot who said otherwise) ... as for guitar not plugged in?  You can tell whoever wrote that review knows little about live performances... (...) ... it's called a wireless system... it's been around for YEARS and yes, Prince was one of the first to use it extensively.

At any rate, back to this review:  although Prince has a habit of dragging songs on and on, we all KNOW it's a remnant of his love of all thins Funk where George Clinton would have these marathon jam grooves... in fact, it's very much like PHISH or Grateful Dead in that respect.  But NO ONE else plays, SINGS, and DANCES at the same time... not then and certainly not now... This video stands the test of time, as do the songs.

Admittedly alittle self-indulgent, but hey... he was A-list #1 at the time.  Not as good a show as the PARADE paris shows (bootleg) or the German TV release of his LOVESEXY show (which should have gotten an official release), but still better than anything put out then ... and even now.",1121385600,26,1180,4.46046511627907
457646,4,630237426X,"Live at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse, Prince Rogers Nelson delivers an electrifying live mix of R&B, Soul, Blues, and Rock with a somewhat electronic treatment from the rhythm section known as The Revolution. Generously borrowing from some of his heroes including James Brown, The Kid makes the most of every inch of floor space for a great 90-minute set that offers extended jam versions of some of his earlier radio hits like '1999' and 'Delirious'. While some sections of the show move too slowly or are redundant, overall the vision of the genius is apparent. 'The Beautiful Ones' is poignant and sensual. 'Baby I'm a Star' culminates into a conga line of sorts, as everybody gets into the act onstage, including Sheila E. (his opening act at the time.) But the jaw-dropping, awe-inspiring 20-minute encore of 'Purple Rain' is the true gem of this concert, and it is only fitting he saved the best for last. A religious experience, to say the least: only once in a generation can a musical legend captivate and mesmerize an audience with one song.

With the advent of DVD recorders in 2004, it is possible to get a good 2nd-generation burn of this gig, to be preserved for all eternity. Sound quality may be compromised, unless you can find a good 4-head VCR and run the signal through top-of-the-line audio gear to EQ and sweeten the mix. Sad to say, that's only way you'll get this one to DVD.

Want the reason why? Check out A&E's Biography, or the E! True Hollywood Story, or even VH1's Behind the Music, on Prince. You'll find out how he felt he was being mistreated by the suits (to the point that he scrawled ""slave"" on his face,) didn't get the contract to say he could keep his own master recordings, and took the giant to war in court and through the media to free himself from Warner Bros.

The price for freedom is a very long memory, and Prince himself knows it. Since WB owns the songs and licensing for the concert, I seriously doubt we'll ever see it on the format...at least in this lifetime. So, if the ""product formerly known as the VCR"" is still blinking '12:00' in your basement, and you can afford another $70 for a new DVD burner, pick up this tape while you still can. It's a rare offering from one of the greatest musicians of the past 30 years.",1120262400,27,2274,4.541463414634146
457647,5,630237426X,"This is one concert video that delivers it all.  There are moments when you wish that Prince would just get on with it, but for the most part it is one of the very best concert videos that I have seen.  All of the songs from Purple Rain are here and even some that were hard to find back in '85.  The show ends with Prince and friends giving it all they have during ""I Would Die 4 U"" and ""Baby, I'm A Star"".  After that, Prince delivers an awesome version of ""Purple Rain"" that could make even the toughest man on the block cry.  It was an evening of music history that no Prince fan should be without.  My only complaint is that this is not out on DVD.",1099612800,6,653,3.9846153846153847
457648,2,630237426X,"First of all, let me say it's been a while since I've seen this video. However, there is enough that remains in mine own head to say what needs to be said about this video. It came out in 1985, so music from ""Purple Rain"" was the latest material. Somehow, even great stuff like that comes off as bland. It opens with a much-less-electrifying version of ""Let's Go Crazy."" The movie and album versions were much better, and for a live Prince offering, is very disappointing. There are also some more obscure songs filling the set, and those songs would be even more obscure today. However, the finale is what makes this video a must-see: a 20 minute version of Purple Rain! By this time, the audience is into the show. The instrumental refrains that play at the beginning of the song last for a few minutes themselves; it's actually a great experience captured live. The rest of the song completes the set, and even makes you think you've sat through something great... when you've only sat through 20 great minutes of some 90 minutes of mediocrity.",1093564800,,1047,4.60427807486631
457669,5,630237426X,"This is Prince when he was at the top of the Pop World and it shows. This show is just electric. Other Purple Rain tour shows may have been better or had rarer songs, but this is such an important document and a must have.

457670,5,630237426X,"Prince's first concert tour marketed to the masses. Although he had already toured and recorded 5 previous records the success of the album and film was enough to have the tour broadcast live on cable. Years ahead of its time the tour is still available minus the opening act with Sheila E. and her Orchestra. The show features Prince's legendary band, The Revolution at their very best just one year and two albums before their demise. Prince DID NOT LIPSYNCHE the show as someone had reported eventhough there are segments that feature backwards pre recorded messages featured just before The Beautiful Ones. Although the spectacular show features special guests Sheila E., Jerome Benton, Apollonia 6 as well as other memebers of Prince's purple posse... the Time is missing. This is due to the fact that by the release of their Ice Cream Castles album  the band had called it quits. It would have been great to see them join Prince in this wild extravaganza but their absence did not hurt the show. There are moments when the show does slow down though especially during numbers such as GOD and Let's Pretend We're Married. Perhaps this is to allow a sweaty Prince a moment to cool off from all that dancing??? The moments when Prince allows his band to shine are trully amazing especially guitarist Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman on Keybords. It helps when you have an amazing body of work that is so jazzy and trully talented people like Eric Leeds on horns. I did have a few problems with sound and lighting though. There are portions that are very poorly lit. I also wish that Prince's people had not tried to duplicate the When Doves Cry video on stage?! Who wants to miss out on his dancing, clothes, and band? Instead we get a rather annoying special effect that sandwhiches into a visual mess. I really wish that the people over at Warners would clean this show up and bring it back to date on DVD. It is a crime to let this amazing and historical moment collect dust and wither away. In spite of its small flaws this is Prince at his best and trully a historical performance for anyone to enjoy. Just in time for a 20th anniversary release don't you think???",1088208000,5,2170,4.6217616580310885

It is an absolutely amazing set of performances including songs like: Computer Blue, Nikki, When Doves Cry, Purple Rain, and How come you don't call me anymore! (I had no idea Prince sang that song before Alicia Keys!) I recommend any TRUE Prince fan to buy this one AND all of his other concert videos out there!",1053388800,,411,4.421052631578948

I bought this tape, didn't know quite what to expect, and the experience blew me away! Prince performs all the classic songs, and more! Before I bought this video I had never heard the song ""Delirious"", but now I walk around and hear the song all the time in my head. If you, like me, like Prince's music you should definitely buy this video. My only complaint is that the whole concert isn't on the tape. But, I guess you can't have it all. Anyway, this is the greatest concert (tape) I have ever seen. That pretty much sums it up! BUY IT!",1044576000,12,687,4.375

I was actually at the concert on this tape and although this is an awesome video the concert was ten times better (Due to sheila E and all prince's protege's coming out during a part of the show (Not shown on this video which was also being live telecast to europe) Prince was definatly at the top of his form on this night. The concert went well into the night if I recall it lasted a good 3-4 hours!! If you liked princes early stuff you will love this video it will bring back the 80's vividly in your mind.
The video is hard to see in spots however (as it was in person) do to the lighting used but the music is pure enjoyment.",1006560000,2,761,3.9161290322580644
457676,4,630237426X,"I used to own this video back in the late 80's,but it tore up in my older brother's vcr a few years later. This is a spectacular concert of Prince and the Revolution around the time of the Purple Rain album and tour. I agree with the other customer reviews,the audio mix as well as the picture when it's dark at times is not great. I am hoping someday that Warner Reprise Music Video will reissue this on DVD soon. The Hits Collection is the only DVD released by Warner so far;I Would Die 4U is on the video of the time of this tour. We know that Prince no longer records for the label,but they could put out more. I hope they release it in 5.1 Dolby Digital and also with multple camera angles on some songs,especially on When Doves Cry. The picture is split screen. Prince and the Revolution Live really funks and roll and again this a great concert but Sign o'the Times still remains the best out of all concert videos Prince has put out so far. Anybody who wants to write a review after this one here,I hope you share my opinions as well as other reviews. Thank U.  P.S.  Remember the videos they had played on MTV a long time ago on the Purple Rain tour:Take Me With U w/Prince soloing on guitar as well as I Would Die 4U(featured in the Hits Collection video)and Baby I'm A Star with Sheila E.and her band. Please Warner Bros.if you're reading this,I hope these songs go in the DVD as bonus songs.",982540800,14,1403,4.2706766917293235

This video is the next best thing I was one of the lucky ones to catch this  show when it came to my hometown.. I can tell you it is truly one  unforgettable experience..  Prince takes the audience on a two hour magical  musical ride performing all  the classic songs  1999, Let Go Crazy, Do Me  Baby, Purple Rain, Take Me With You , Little Red Corvette.. This a must for  all die hard Prince fans..  The reason why i gave this only four stars  closer to 4.5  is because the audio mix isn't great..
