I prefer Jodi Stolove tapes",1502323200,,61,4.636363636363637
8390031,3,B0036JC0JQ,Leslie Sansone talks so much that she is very inconsistent with the pace.,1470528000,,73,4.6923076923076925
8390032,4,B0036JC0JQ,"Typical Leslie Sansone--I mean that in a good way.  A nice low-impact workout.  The actual workout is the equivalent to one mile, which is kind of short for me, so I just play it twice.  Works for me!",1415404800,,200,4.2105263157894735
8390033,5,B0036JC0JQ,"I am 68 years old and suffer from severe osteo-arthritis and was looking for a walking tape that I could manage to do that wouldn't overwhelm me or my body. This is a good basic tape and moves at a good pace, but if needed a person could slow it way down for their own fitness level. If you are looking to do some kind of exercising to get healthier, this one is for you. I can see myself getting in better shape and wanting to challenge myself with something more challenging down the road, but it is just what I need to get my heart pumping and to feel good about myself, knowing that I got some exercise in for the day! I highly recommend this for seniors!",1408665600,3,659,4.116279069767442
8390034,5,B0036JC0JQ,"The Leslie Sansone ""Active Aduly 1 Mile Walk""  DVD is perfect for the over 65 crowd who wand to keep active.  Easy to follow.  Easy to do.",1408492800,3,138,4.037037037037037
