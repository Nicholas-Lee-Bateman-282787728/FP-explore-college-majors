1359233,5,B00004VY9O,this was well worth the time and effort. I have paid money to see much worse movies from major studios with big name actors. it is two steps above the typical SCIFI channel movie or the usual straight to video fare. I have no complaint with the sparsity of cast or the limited budget. The road warrior movies were not written as well as this and didn't have as much substance as this. I hope whoever made this film was allowed to make more.,1372982400,3,440,4.25
1359234,2,B00004VY9O,"This is just another of the Australian film industries bad movies. Bad acting, bad effects, and women that look like men. Just more of the same from down under.",1371513600,,160,4.551724137931035
1359235,3,B00004VY9O,"Stardard scifi flick.  OK 2 hour time waster but nothing remarkable.  Actrive cast a couple of nice effects, no real surprises",1368489600,,126,4.9523809523809526
1359236,4,B00004VY9O,"Nice job on the man versus himself bit. The first 25 minutes are kind of shaky and slow, but leads into a decent flick. I was expecting a classic post WWIII fight against the system/ government cover up, but really that is a sub plot. The protagonist is just a regular guy with a regular injury, coping in regular ways. After seeing this, I  appreciate the film for what it is, a regular guy with psychotropic substance abuse flashback issues dying and saving the day.",1367539200,6,468,4.5058823529411764
1359237,4,B00004VY9O,"... sparse scenery, small list of players, but the drama seemed to work quite well...interesting story and a good line of reasonable reaction by the characters...",1363219200,,162,5.269230769230769
1359238,4,B00004VY9O,"This is not an easy film to classify. It hovers in a strange realm between traditional sci fi action film and slower, more cerebral and arty science fiction fare such as SOLARIS.

Peter Phelps is a hugely likable actor. His central performance dominates the film and he shows he is fully up to the task of carrying a major motion picture; he has a lot of scenes where he is alone and they never drag on into dullness. Why he isn't as big of a star as Russell Crowe is a mystery.

The ""future world"" scenario that ZONE 39 presents is rendered well within the confines of the tight budget; this movie really shows what a dedicated production team can do in conjunction with a tightly written script. Nothing is attempted that cannot be pulled off convincingly. The ending is bit rushed, though.",1163894400,3,792,4.531468531468532
1359239,3,B00004VY9O,"It is in the tradition of mad max as the cover says (not Road Warrior), and I can see how it won awards at the festivals because it really is a decent flick for what it is. It does of course, lack the sheen of a hollywood production. If you like sci-fi though, and even sometimes like what others may consider bad sci-fi, then give it spin (I suggest rent).
There are some holes in the story, though it is original. The acting is pretty good, and there is an intensity feeling throughout most of the movie that you may or may not like. The ending could have been better, it feels like the producers were glad to get it over with (probably from shooting in the desert).",999129600,8,668,4.2265625
7924386,3,B00004VY9O,"Contaminated, controlled, paranoid, militaristic and bleak. Zone 39 has some good acting and some decent sets. Overall a entertaining science fiction story despite a plot that is a bit hard to follow.",1401062400,,200,5.28125
7924387,4,B00004VY9O,"Considering the low budget - and lack of special effects - this flick still holds your attention.,..wonder why..
could it be...
must it be...
the decent acting and story line?

Methinks yes.

Decent.",1393718400,,199,5.0
7924388,4,B00004VY9O,"slow beginning and a distinctly non-US film pace, feels much more like a 70's movie than anything modern. Worth a look if you like
""B"" movies, probably not if you don't.",1393372800,,169,4.483870967741935
7924389,5,B00004VY9O,"Not for those with serious ""quality"" of production requirements. It definitely has the 70's/80's film quality. But, it's a good plot, which is hard to come by most of the time.",1391385600,,176,4.709677419354839
7924390,4,B00004VY9O,"Occasional holes in the script, but overall, I liked it; much better than many of the same genre.  Beats the run of the mill B movies.",1390694400,,134,4.153846153846154
7924391,5,B00004VY9O,"Good movie , it did lack a bit of more action , but all in all it was a good movie",1388707200,,82,2.9523809523809526
7924392,5,B00004VY9O,"Not really action packed but enthralling story to see what will happen next and at the end. Though a 'post apocalyptic' story, it is more of a character driven thriller, in my opinion. Excellent acting and though a low budget film, you definitely won't notice. Effects are great. Be aware of a few scenes of full frontal nudity.",1388534400,,328,4.672413793103448
7924393,3,B00004VY9O,While not a great movie this was still a pretty good B movie. I was stationed in Australia near the location filming of this production in 1996. I'm surprised the release date is 2007. I was hired to drive actors and equipment around. Several US service members were extras.,1385424000,,274,4.612244897959184
7924394,2,B00004VY9O,This movie was rather low budget and didn't carry well. But when you don't feel good and just need something to zone to. It's ok,1381449600,,128,4.16
7924395,4,B00004VY9O,"Not an A movie but a high B.  Common plotline but a little different.  Characters were interesting, not much in the way of special effects.  All in all worth a free watch.",1376006400,,171,4.28125
