8334587,5,B001PSQGIG,"There is still conflicting information in the product description for this DVD at Amazon.  It mentions US region 1 in the description and also PAL, but this is positively a 100% PAL format DVD.  It wouldn't play on our TV or computer. I was overly optimist. Amazon graciously accepted the return.

I didn't want to give this one star as I couldn't view this DVD.  I watched it in its entirety on YouTube and wanted the DVD copy for myself.  So, I definitely would have given it 5 stars.",1361145600,,486,4.415730337078652
