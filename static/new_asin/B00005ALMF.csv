7935408,2,B00005ALMF,Kind of a quick movie. Not many twists and turns and the bad girl won in the end. Shannon Tweed is always fun to watch.,1458172800,,119,3.8
7935409,3,B00005ALMF,not bad but not as erotic as I had thought it would be. Other Body  Chemistry more garphic. could be better,1373155200,,107,4.095238095238095
7935410,5,B00005ALMF,Body Chemistry 4 full exposure has the rated and unrated version of this movie and both of them are worth buying. This movie is one of shannon's best and the role that she plays will keep you guessing till the end. The mystery and suspense are mixed together which makes this movie more mysterious. I rate this movie as a #4.,1323043200,3,325,4.344262295081967
