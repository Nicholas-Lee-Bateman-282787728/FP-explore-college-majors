8511556,5,B0077596HE,This wonderful program was shown on PBS in the 1980s.  It had detailed information the later NOVA program does not.  What a shame the original is not on DVD.  PBS is missing a great marketing opportunity and viewers are missing a riveting exposition of one of mankind's great achievements.,1340323200,,289,4.857142857142857
