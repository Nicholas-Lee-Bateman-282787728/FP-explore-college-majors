8519418,4,B007LNJ4IS,"This set is one of three sets released by Pop Flix distributed by Allegro that collect Giallo films from Italy.
Each set has 4 films on 2 discs, and 11 of the 12 titles have seen a release in the USA.
All of the films appear to have been borrowed from existing transfers and releases, and now withthe sets dissapearing on line may indicate a rights problem.  A title may get replaced and the sets re issued or they may be gone for good.
The films suffer from mild compression but otherwise for the price are a good deal if you don't alreay own the offical release versions.",1353024000,3,573,4.305555555555555
