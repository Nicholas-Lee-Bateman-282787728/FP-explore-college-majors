8502740,5,B006PEKTAG,"This DVD has been stunning, and has provided me a new and amazing perspective on Earth history. It is so easy to forget that plants set the
agenda for life. All humans all living things rely on plants for their survival. Now I realize that plants are the most powerful evolutionary force on
Earth. Plants have achieved their one goal, which is total domination of the planet. I agree that this is a story of ruthless ingenuity, seduction
