7937749,2,B00005BI92,"The Three Stooges Festival, 1947 film

These comic actors were popular from the 1930s to the 1950s. Children laughed but did not realize the bad examples they set. Would they be allowed on TV today? Is there market for their humor? Moe Howard played in a movie of a Shakespeare play. He did not have the looks of an Olivier or Gable. He earned more and worked steadily in these series. And thats what actors do.

Disorder in the Court, 1936
A lawyer questions a dancer: who killed Kirk Robin? The three main witnesses are out to lunch, but return. Take off your hat. Will something go wrong? Curly testifies. They will re-enact the event. [Can you believe their actions?] Gale dances. The boys show what happened. Is the trigger too hard to pull? Will an unloaded revolver fire? Order in the court. Can they catch the parrot? The note will clear Gale.

Brideless Groom, 1947
Shemp is a Teacher of Voice, we hear his student sing. He learns his uncle died and left him $500,000! [A lot more then.] But only if he is married. Can he get hitched? There is humor in a telephone booth. [Is this still funny today?] Shemp is prettied up. That woman greets Cousin Basil, then rejects him. Shemp finds a woman, they go to the JP for more comic action. Then five women arrive to be the bride. You wouldnt hit a lady with that. Were married. What will Shemp do now?

Malice in the Palace, 1949
Men enter a restaurant. Three waiters serve them, then must clean up the mess. The conspirators will need three men to do their work. Rabbit or hot dogs? Curly chases a cat then a dog! Shemp and Moe sample the meal. Curly enjoys the meal. These three will get the jewels for us. A message arrives, are they too late? We learn more about those two men. They are not what they seem to be. They study that map. [Note the names.] There aint no Santa Claus. Can they get that diamond without any trouble? [Then it wouldnt be funny.] I heard that cats are supposed to taste like rabbits, and dogs taste like pork.

Sing a Song of Six Pants, 1947
The boys have a tailor shop with new and second hand clothes. They get a bill for overdue tailoring equipment. The radio tells of a reward for a robber. Curly gets a spot out of clothes. Moe makes pancakes. Shemp reads the comics. What else can go wrong? A man takes refuge in their shop. 200% Wool. A detective enters to look around and sees nothing. Later that man returns to his flat. Moe finds a paper in those pants. A customer gets brushed off. A woman wants her dress dyed, and buys a jacket and slacks. Three men want their suits cleaned but they want that paper! After some comic conflicts the three robbers are given to that detective for a reward!",1396828800,,2682,4.3667334669338675
7937750,3,B00005BI92,"Given that this isn't coming from Columbia and there's no info about it, my guess is that's it's another repackage of the public domain shorts: ""Brideless Groom,"" ""Disorder in the Court,"" ""Malice in the Palace"" and ""Sing a Song of Six Pants.""",1311292800,,242,4.785714285714286

7937752,1,B00005BI92,I was disappointed with both the selection and particularly since Shemp is in most of the films. When one thinks of the Three Stooges the original Curly is essential. Sure give Shemp one but every other one! You are better off taping the shows and viewing them on your VCR; DVD doesn't necessarily mean better!,1056067200,2,310,4.654545454545454
7937753,5,B00005BI92,"4 movies:  Disorder in the Court, Bridless Groom, Sing a Song of Six Pants, and Malice in Plance.  They all equal about 80 minutes.  Special Features:  Biography, Film info, and Photo gallery.  All together a great movie at a great price.",1001203200,3,238,4.7073170731707314
7937754,4,B00005BI92,"I missed the old days when I sat in front of the TV in the 80's and laughed at Moe, Larry, and Curly.  This dvd brings back the laughter with digital video and audio quality.  You can just experience the pain of Moe slapping Curly on the head or Larry getting his hair pulled out.",994896000,,280,4.072727272727272
