2251032,5,B0007Y08MY,"The first time I saw ""Godfather, Part II"" was on NBC back in the pre-VCR days and they cobbled it together with ""The Godfather"" and told the Corleone family saga in linear fashion.  It was good but it wasn't until years later that I saw ""Part II"" properly.  Director Francis Ford Coppola effectively jumped back and forth between the young Vito Corleone (Robert DeNiro) and Michael Corleone who five years on was still trying to legitimize the ""family"".  The flashing back that Coppola utilized effectively pointed out the fact that the young Vito turned to organized crime as a means of survival in a New World where recent immigrants had to look out for themselves.  Michael's ruthlessness, on the other hand, can only be attributed to a deluded vanity that he tosses off as looking after the family's interests.  Al Pacino is simply superb here in an even-keeled portrayal as Michael.  It's hard to believe that this is the same actor who did the over-the-top ""Scarface"".  Good supporting cast includes Michael V. Gazzo as Frankie Pantagale, a disgruntled Corleone foot soldier, and Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth.  John Cazale's Fredo Corleone emerges in this film with all the seething resentments finally coming to the surface after years of being the forgotten Corleone brother.  Domenic Chianese(Junior Soprano) appears as Johnny Ola, one of Roth's associates.  Coppola offers a colorfully informative commentary that should not be missed.",1114905600,,1444,5.1063829787234045
2251033,5,B0007Y08MY,"The Godfather is one of the great films of the 20th Century, and Godfather II is one of those rare sequels that measures up to the original in every way.  This is a great and compelling story with a wonderful cast that turns in superb performances.  About the only thing one can complain about in this film is the absence of Brando, but that, of course, was more or less inevitable given the storyline of The Godfather.  On the other hand, Robert DeNiro turns in an absolutely flawless and powerful performance as the young Godfather: Vito Corleone.

The film wonderfully juxtaposes the Corleone family in more or less the modern age, circa 1965, against the early immigrant Vito Corleone as he flees the local mafia boss in Corleone, Sicily as a child, and seeks his fortune in early 20th Century New York City.  The Italian ghetto of New York, filled with hopeful immigrants, is incredibly well done, and the viewer feels transported to this brawling, bustling, and formative era of American history.  This is a great film.

Like The Godfather, although the protagonists, most of whom are criminals, are portrayed with some sympathy, this film shows the mafia and organized crime to be ultimately futile and self-destructive institutions in no way worthy of emulation or aspiration.  This adds to, rather than detracts from, what is a truly great story of the American immigrant and social experience.

The DVD features excellent sound and brilliant colors, and constitutes a very good value.  Any film afficianado will want to own this one.",1114214400,2,1543,4.922779922779923
2251034,5,B0007Y08MY,"In my opinion, Godfather II is THE greatest film of all time, yes, even greater than the first one. Before labeling what I've just said as heresy, hear me out. While this film depends a lot on it's predecessor, it not only manages to match it's level, but bring to a higher plateau. After Francis Ford Coppola establishes the background and characters in episode I, he brings us deeper into these characters and their pasts. Pacino, who in my opinion gave the most OUTSTANDING performance of anyone in episode I (yes, including Brando) does the impossible and gives one that is even greater. It is an absolute TRAVESTY that he was not awarded for his performance (Art Carney received it that year for ""Harry and Tonto""...who knew!!??) and Deniro was. What Deniro has basically done in his portrayal of the young Vito Corleone is mimmick every move that Brando made in the prequel down to the most miniscule detail (notice the scene where Deniro is shown buying fruit at a small stand...look familiar?). But while his performance is not original, it is still excellent. The film is filled with numerous great scenes. In most films, the viewer is given one or perhaps two memorable scenes (ie taxi scene for ""On the Waterfront"" or the mirror scene in ""Taxi Driver""). But in this, there is the Senator Geary scene with Michael during the party, the scene where Vito stalks Fanucci, the heartbreaking (in my opinion greatest scene of film history) betrayal scene with Michael and Fredo, the argument between Michael and Kay, and countless other's which i won't give away to spoil it for first-time viewers. At the heart of all the violence, betrayals, and plotting, I believe Coppola wants us to really concentrate on this one man Michael Corleone who thinks he is doing the right thing with all his cold-hearted acts because he firmly believes it is for the good of his family. The most tragic aspect of the film, is that in attempt to protect his family through a life of violence, we see that Michael ultimately loses them due to the it. The scenes with Pacino, Strasberg, and Deniro are ESPECIALLY well acted out. The music is stirring and the settings and backgrounds beautiful. The film garnered 6 academy awards and was nominated for many more. To put it into words, i would describe this film as having the visual and musical beauty of ""Lawrence of Arabia"", the characteristic intellect of ""Citizen Kane"", the seriousness of a film like ""Taxi Driver"", the memorability of ""On the Waterfront"", and a high standard of excellency in acting that is unmatched by any other film.",1112400000,4,2577,4.793258426966292
2251035,5,B0007Y08MY,"Why didn't Al Pacino win an Oscar for playing Michael Corleone in any of the Godfather movies.  Especially for this one, where Michael becomes a cold hearted killer.  Robert De Niro plays young Vito with an astonishing performance in his first big role.  But what about Al.  He deserved one for Scent of a Woman, but he damn sure earned a million for playing Michael.  Anyways with a great supporting cast, The Godfather: Part II exceeds the first one and is without a doubt the greatest sequel ever made.",1111881600,2,505,4.629213483146067

2251043,4,B0007Y08MY,"RELEASED IN 1974 and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, ""The Godfather: Part II"" is part sequel and part flashback to the first film with the main story focusing on Michael (Al Pacino) in the late 50s as the stalwart Corleone son who has taken over as Godfather with events taking place at Lake Tahoe, Miami, New York City, Havana (during the Cuban Revolution), and a congressional committee in Washington DC. The flashbacks concern Vito Corleone as a kid in Sicily and his arrival to Ellis Island with the story focusing on Vitos life in New York City when he was in his mid-to-late 20s (Robert De Niro) where he cleverly and boldly establishes himself as the formidable new Don.

MAIN CAST: Robert Duvall plays the adopted lawyer son, Tom, while John Cazale appears as the weakest Corleone son, Fredo. Diane Keaton returns as Michaels wife, who tries to put out of her mind her husbands shady business with Talia Shire reprising the role of Corleone sister, Connie.

The good news is that the flashbacks pertaining to Vito (De Niro) are good, starting with the shocking opening scenes. The saga of Michael (Pacino), by contrast, is relatively dull, particularly the first half, which mostly involves overlong scenes of talky drama. Michaels story simply lacks the energy and highlight-every-15-minutes of the prior film. Moreover, Pacino is thoroughly one-note solemn as Michael, lacking the characters interesting story arc in the first installment and the dimension of the third. Im not blaming Pacino, as he simply played the role as written and does it well. Im just saying that hes not a very captivating character, particularly compared to Brando or De Niro as Vito. Hes just too one-dimensional and therefore uninteresting. Thankfully, things perk up in the second half culminating with an explosive showdown between Michael and Kay, which had to happen in light of the climatic scene of the previous movie.

The moral of the story rings loud and clear: Choosing the life of organized crime will result in a grim life of constant heartache and premature death all around you. Lifes hard enough without taking that shady route.

Bottom line: This is a worthwhile crime drama with some highlights, but IMHO its not in the same league as the first movie in overall entertainment. Its good for what it is, but its overrated by people who cant see beyond nostalgia-tinged glasses. If you're a fan of the first film its almost mandatory that you watch this one; just don't expect the same dynamic greatness. I know its sacrilege to say this, but Part II is on par with Part III in tone and quality, although I personally give Part III the edge in all-around entertainment value.

THE FILM RUNS 3 hours & 22 minutes (overlong) and was shot in Sicily & Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Italy; the New York City area; Lake Tahoe, California; Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic; Acireale, Catania; Las Vegas; and Washington DC. WRITERS: Coppola & Mario Puzo.

2251054,5,B0007Y08MY,"I saw it in the theater when it came out. The first day it was out. I, like everyone, really enjoyed the first film. If you haven't read the book and you are a fan of the films, you must.
In the theater the film was very dark. It was commented on in the papers for this. In the DVD era, they have brightened the image because of this. I mention this for film buffs and fans who are interested in this type of thing.
By the way, the most important scene, where Michael tells Tom how he's putting him in charge, in the theater, the audio was terrible and you could hardly see what was happening. But that scene and Michael's then talking to Roth and then Frankie, must not be missed. If you don't know what is going on in those three scenes you're lost.
First: Michael tells Tom how he's putting him in charge. On DVD it's still somewhat dark and the audio is not as loud as I would like it but it's far better than the VHS copies of the past.
Next, important scene is when Michael tells Roth that Frankie did the shooting. In the modern DVD copies the audio is good, and the picture is a bit brighter.
Next, Michael visit's Frankie.  This scene let's you know that Michael knows that Frankie isn't responsible, for the shots fired into Michael's  bedroom. Michael KNOWS Roth is responsible. He wants to find out who within his family is hooked up with Roth.  In the modern DVD copies this  scene  is good.
So, on whole, old VHS copies aren't any good. Early DVDs aren't much better. The most recent DVDs are the best.
As for scenes which are trimmed or deleted, that is a massive subject. Only the VHS ""Saga"" has MOST (not all) of them. And compared to the DVDs, they are almost un watchable.
Take your choice. But buy recently restored DVDs.
Ok, as a fan I'd like to add, in God father two the switching back and forth between the two stories is still confusing for most viewers. The film should have run the Godfather Vito story from start to finish. It should have had title cards naming the segments.
Then, we could have read a title card with a summary of the first film's story. Then, the Godfather Michael era should have begun. This would start with Micheal becoming Godfather which is at the end of the first film.
Love you, Frances! Next film, let's do lunch.",1494460800,,2268,4.327058823529412

2251077,5,B0007Y08MY,"The Godfather Part II (1974) is another masterpiece in the trilogy. While a lot of people group parts I and II as one film, I'm one who thinks they're better-served as stand alone movies, the latter as the sequel. Why? While watching this film that debuted just two years after the first film, I found it to be a little different in overall feel and presence. This film doesn't have the same aesthetic or perhaps psychological depth that the first film possesses; that's not to say it's really inferior, but rather noticeably different. Also, Marlon Brando and James Caan made such a huge impression on the success of the first film, so it's harder to sustain its immortal status, though Part II is iconic. Some say that this film is superior to the first; I beg to differ. Still, The Godfather Part II is great entertainment, and at 3:20 in length, you're bound to find a lot of great stuff. The commentary by Francis Ford Coppola is interesting, too.",1452729600,,952,4.6390532544378695

On one hand director Coppola gets the details of the Italian-American experience down to the minutest detail. He accomplishes this with great storytelling combing script, dialogue, performances and editing. Unfortunately the actions of these family members are so appealing to audiences that it in effect glamorizes a certain lifestyle and singles out a particular ethnic group. However using his great innovative techniques Coppola created a cultural phenomenon. From a cinematic viewpoint Coppola's direction simply wins the viewer over with such grace and appeal that there is no room for ethical consequences. For years director John Ford decimated thousands of American Indians under the watchful eyes of Monument Valley. Nobody seemed to mind much in the end. Sometimes you are remembered for how well you tell a story and not so much for what the story has to say. Filmmaking can be a very dichotomous business.",1426723200,,997,5.356687898089172

2251114,5,B0007Y08MY,"I'm giving this 5 stars because most of it is wonderful.  I would love to have had more scenes from Vito's life when he was young and first came to America.  The book told some fascinating stories about how the family got started and moved to Long Island to the ""compound"".  I would like to have seen less about all his different mob connections and how they were killing each other right and left.  Also, less about Cuba.  And, a good explanation of how Michael got out of Cuba in the middle of the beginning of the revolution would have been nice.  A lot of good stuff that was in the book got left out.  The very interesting character of Sonny's girlfriend and what happened to her after he was killed, the doctor at the hotel, all very interesting stories and characters and all they gave us was  gangsters killing each other.  To me in the book Michael was never a one dimentional character as he is portrayed here. Vito retained his humanity right up to his death in Godfather 1.  Michael becomes a monster. I wonder if we are supposed to believe that the death of his first wife in Sicily changed him so much. Actually, it probably began with his killing the two men in the restaurant.  Once he had done that personally and not having ordered someone else to do it I think he could never go back to what he had been before. To me, Godfather 1 is still the superior film but I enjoyed DeNiro in his role as the young Vito very much.  He was spot on, nailed it perfectly.  It doesn't get better than that.",1420156800,,1510,4.3120567375886525

2251133,5,B0007Y08MY,"THE GODFATHER Part II (1974) continues the story of mob boss Michael Corleone
and also introduces the parallel story of Vito Corleone as a young man.

Al Pacino believes this film is more personal to director Francis Coppola,
who also wrote most of the script, often in conflict with author Mario Puzo.

The Corleone family now lives in Nevada. A failed assassination of Michael in his own bedroom sends him looking for whoever ordered the hit.

In a separate story set in Sicily early in the 20th Century, 9-year-old Vito Andolini becomes the target of local Mafia chief Don Ciccio when Vito's older brother is murdered by Ciccio's men. With his mother violently killed after she begs the Don to spare her only child, orphaned Vito is sent alone to America. His renaming to ""Vito Corleone"" by a dense Ellis Island processor, plus six months detainment for evidence of smallpox, are this future crime king's first experiences in his adopted country.

It's marvelous how the two stories often intertwine, and Robert De Niro as young Vito is the star of this epic film.

Many of the original cast are back, plus there's some top shelf performances from Lee Strasberg (as Miami mobster Hyman Roth), Michael V. Gazzo as traitorous Corleone family member Frankie Pentangeli, and G.D. Spradlin as Nevada senator Pat Geary. In the Vito story, standouts are Bruno Kirby as Young Clemenza, Leopoldo Trieste as comical slumlord Signor Roberto, and expecially Gastone Moschin as the greedy Black Hand Mafioso Don Fanucci, who ""wet his beak"" straight to hell.

Ironic in hindsight, at one time critics almost universally dismissed this ""Godfather"" sequel,
yet over the years many have come to rate it as superior to the 1972 original.
Currently at IMDb, Part II's voter rating is only a 10th of a percent less that the first film's 9.2.",1406937600,2,1824,4.9058441558441555

2251135,5,B0007Y08MY,"Al Pacino is the greatest Reptilian Shapeshifter that Cinema has ever produced. Unlike other actors who have to keep their BioDigital Reptilian eyes a fleeting secret, Pacino displays his with demonic gusto. It's as if this actor can shapeshift at his own recognizance. Maybe Pacino is the Devil himself. (Not surprisingly, he played the title character in ""The Devil's Advocate"".) In the recent Pacino film ""Stand Up Guys"" he plays the nemesis of 'Mr. Claphands' (a god-like Mob Boss) and the reason that Claphands has it in for Pacino is because Al killed the big boss' only son. (In one scene, Al mentions ""The Devil Himself"" as he looks around like the cat who ate the canary.) In the film's final moment, we see Al defiantly shooting up at Claphands as the camera continues to tilt ever upward toward the sky - suggesting that the film's allegorical conflict is really about defying the heavens.
 It is said that the Devil was the 'gardener of Eden' who created Mankind. (According to this theory, the Devil's name is 'Ea' and his dwelling place was known as E.Din (Ea's Den). In the great Pacino film ""Serpico"", he informs us that, ""If you love a man's GARDEN, you gotta love the man."" And while riding in the back of a car in ""Stand Up Guys"" he repeats this theme by informing his buddies, ""I got into GARDENING. I've got quite a little green thumb fellas!""
 But whoever this Master Reptilian Thespian really is, there can be no doubt that his bold shapeshifting remains unparalleled in the history of films. If you doubt this, you might want to watch the scenes in ""Godfather 1"" where Pacino is visiting his father (Brando) in the hospital...simply utilize your DVD functions of zoom-in and frame-by-frame to carefully study his eyes during this portion of the movie. You may find yourself in total amazement. As Pacino himself explained in ""Stand Up Guys"", all you have to do is ""look close enough"" (it was exactly at this moment that Pacino displayed a monstrous Reptilian slit as he exited a church).
 Perhaps you find this review to be implausible...mayhap johnellizz is a crazy, over-imaginative crackpot who has concocted a nightmare fantasy world comfortably removed from reality. Sure, I make a YouTube channel called: johnellizz which documents endless examples of irrefutable shapeshifts from the world's most famous movie stars...but this review is about ""Godfather 2""...so can I PROVE IT with this film?
 I certainly can - thanks to the remarkable willingness of Al Pacino to reveal his Reptilian eyes like no other actor. Let me first explain that all shapeshifts happen for a reason. Actors use their BioDigital eyes to subliminally convey the psychological undercurrents of what's happening in the scene. In ""The Godfather Part 2"" we see Pacino being strong-armed by a corrupt senator who expresses utter contempt for 'greasy Italians' and wags his finger at the young Mafia boss. We then see a blackmail operation which puts the senator firmly under the Mob's control by framing him for the murder of a prostitute...The next time we see the senator, he is meeting Pacino at a nightclub when they shake hands. The senator is now warm and respectful to the young Mafia boss! There is no sign of the former contempt he most clearly displayed as he says, ""Great to see you again, Mike! I'm glad we could spend this time together."" Pacino accepts this praise and nods his head as he shakes the hand of the senator.
 To observe a stunningly obvious shapeshift, simply zoom-in on Pacino's right eye (the eye to your left) and go frame-by-frame just as Pacino nods while shaking hands...you will observe his eye turn GREEN and slitted in an undeniable fashion!
 But WHY would he do such a thing? It's simple: The faade of warmth being affected by the senator is being subliminally contradicted by Pacino's Reptilian eye. Underneath the superficialities and pleasantries lies the dark TRUTH of the scene: The young Mafia boss now OWNS the defeated senator, who must kiss his greasy Italian butt forevermore!
 Such is the way of Reptilian shapeshifts, my fellow movie buffs: They always happen during moments of dark and twisted TRUTH - scratching under the surface to expose the cold, harsh and primitive conditions of life on Earth...
 Oh and by the way...let's not forget the beautiful Italian woman who tempted Pacino in ""Godfather 1""...it was said by one of Al's bodyguards in the film that: ""She could tempt the Devil himself"". Read all of my scintillating movie reviews here on Amazon.",1406160000,,4506,4.888743455497382

2251138,5,B0007Y08MY,"Let's talk about the greatest performance of all-time. Let's talk about Al Pacino as Michael Corleone in The Godfather Part II. Why do I love film? There's are a million different ways I can answer that but the most honest way being that I live to communicate with the art form. You don't choose the cinema, the cinema chooses you. I relish empathy, pathos, and things transcendental. I love being moved and I love to be haunted. In The Godfather Part II, I am all of those things simultaneously. Al Pacino's performance is the reason I love film. Pacino's portrayal of Michael Corleone is the reason I will always believe that magic exists.

Pacino's performance is fascinating. I have never seen a more disciplined portrait of a troubled and heartless man than the one he painted in The Godfather Part II. It is a flawless portrayal. That quiet calculation, that bitter chill. The frigid professionalism. The outburst. The breakdown and collapse. All under complete control and strictly regimented by Pacino. An uncanny talent. These are acting acrobatics. He is giving it his all and it appears so natural, but never truly lifelike, right? That would go against the man who Michael Corleone became.

This is the greatest performance ever in the history of film. It will never be beat. Pacino fully understood exactly who Michael Corleone was. He seems to have known him inside and out. He communicates emotions and provokes a pathos so authentic that what he accomplishes with the character is out of this world and absolutely one of a kind. He has conquered the impossible. It is the most complex performance I have ever seen and it's one that captivates not by nature but by command. Pacino demonstrates legitimate pathos. A legitimate pathos channeled through a legitimate monster. It is an unapologetically pure portrayal, completely and utterly pure.

Of empathy and concord, Pacino was masterful. He is so guarded here and so precise. His immediate refusal to grant you the permission to feel for him is the definition of courage in acting. To play a character who doesn't want to be the focus of the film's need for pathos or pity, a character who rejects the concept of being emotionally available to the audience. A character who's cold as ice, hard as stone, and already dead. Doing it is one thing but doing it so well is something entirely different. It's bravery on film. It's revealing. It's like Michael already lost his spirit. The Godfather Part II is the story of what happened after his spirit was forfeited. The Godfather Part II is about how his heart turned black.

The tenderness is gone. He has been asked to choose and he has made his decision. His heart will be forever black for what he feels obligated to do. And you can feel every moment of it. You can physically feel the shade of his heart getting darker. You can feel Michael losing both color and humanity. It is then that you can feel for him. You can feel for his lack of feeling. It is an extraordinary expression of loss. When he enters the screen, you can sense the chill becoming more and more permanent. He has entered the realm of the irreversible. His black heart is a part of him by the end of the film and it will never be altered or changed. Michael Corleone will never be saved.

Throughout The Godfather Part II, Michael is depicted as a very lonely and careful king. He is all alone and he can't trust anyone. Sadly, those who he still trusts begrudgingly will eventually go on to betray him, legitimizing his concerns. Michael feels like both a victim and a monster. You can tell that he shares both vengeance and shame. He is tested and he stays contained, in control. An outburst or two here and there are like miniature explosions and they pack more heat than dynamite. His occasional lapse of concentration over his self control are short lived. But these screams are alive and they serve to remind us that there is a person under that stone exterior. That behind the monster's mask is another one.

Pacino smartly portrays Michael as confused and enraged. He makes him out to be a man who is trying very hard to be intelligent, reasonable, and calm. Michael is a vengeful man and a loveless one. This was not the life he wanted but he was obligated to accept it. He demonstrates a strict adherence to the rules of business. He is silently dangerous and cruel. He is powerful and calculating, cold and distant. Contained. Under control. At war with his own family while he should be locked in battle with himself.

Yes. The most incredible performance ever. I watch Pacino in this film and I can hardly believe that someone could really be that good. And it is acting in it's most classical definition. A prime example of the character study. Mystical, magical, and ethereal. Perfection in motion. One of the most spectacular things that celluloid ever captured is Al Pacino in The Godfather Part II. A performance that reminds you that film is an art form and that actors are the messengers of the art itself.

There are other outstanding performances in The Godfather Part II, the most noteworthy being the great John Cazale as Michael's unfortunately dim older brother Fredo. Cazale was one the best, I'm far from alone in wishing that he had been well enough to do more films. The few parts he had have proven to be nothing if not legendary and emblematic. And as Fredo he is fearless. Fredo's shame and desperation, and emasculation, are all communicated by Cazale coherently and powerfully.

And some dude named Robert De Niro was also in it. :)

De Niro portrayed a young Don Vito Corleone. The film is ambitious in structure in that it tells two separate stories, one of social triumph and one of moral devastation. Vito's is the one about triumph. Set in the early 1900s, De Niro plays a cunning and honorable Vito. Still cold and calculating, but he is a man you can root for. You can sometimes see similarities in business tactics between Vito and his son Michael. But more often than not, you can see that what Vito found most important in life means absolutely nothing to his son. That the foundation his legacy and business was founded on can no longer be counted on. That his most tender son will go on to destroy it.

De Niro is great here. A quiet performance and a unique part of his repertoire. A very well crafted and honed character. Much like Pacino, De Niro shows great discipline when portraying Vito. Great discipline and patience. Unlike Pacino, who's brief manic outbursts shed the most light on the person inside, De Niro relies upon the actions of Vito to demonstrate truth and control. A fabulous performance, reserved and dominating.

Gordon Willis. You just can't write an essay about The Godfather Part II without talking about Gordon Willis. That would be akin to blasphemy. Willis was the director of photography on The Godfather Part II and it was some of the best photography I have ever seen. So well done, the lighting was so perfect, so divine. He nailed the atmosphere, he made it radiate. Some shots look so magnificent that you'd swear you were dreaming. A testament to the power of lighting. A maestro of atmosphere and a master of the lens, Gordon Willis is just as essential to The Godfather legacy as anyone else.

Director Francis Ford Coppola in the '70s was really somethin' else. So many masterpieces in such a short amount of time, it's hard comprehending the full extent of his genius run. The pacing of The Godfather Part II is second to none, it's style is all it's own. There's a reason why The Godfather Parts I and II look so unlike any other film you've ever seen. It's because Coppola's vision was original, unique, and perfectly captured. Those films are almost untouchable. They simply have the best everything. They are simply immaculate. They are films of an almost mythical realm. They are the reason the art form can thrive in a business climate. They are absolutely powerful. Timeless relics of a forgotten promise.

Like sage, Coppola burned.

Before I wrap this up I would like to take this opportunity to talk about Robert Duvall. As Tom Hagan, consigliere to the Corleone family,  he supplies the film with enough soul to fuel a jet plane. In a film populated with soulless characters, Duvall's Tom Hagan really stands out as a focal point for humanity. A very warm performance, usually opposite Pacino's vacuously cold and controlled tour de force. A friendly presence. A thankless portrayal that should be admired for it's comfort and compassion.

In closing, The Godfather Part II holds a very special place in my heart. I hold it near and dear. A lot of people wonder if The Godfather Part II is a film that lives up to the hype. I say of course it does, it crushes it. I have a different question, does the hype live up to the film?

This film is so moving and so powerful that it has earned it's enormous reputation. It's a film that can handle the accolade. It's a film that waits. It wants to be sought after. It wants to be examined. And it's an easy film to fall in love with. I know I did.

2251157,5,B0007Y08MY,"Few films have the passionate following that The Godfather Part II has, and few sequels are regarded as such purebred masterpieces as The Godfather Part II.  What makes this feat all the more impressive is that the original Godfather from only two years prior is ALSO that good.  This isn't a case of a film simply outdoing a mediocre beginning, but this is the case of a brilliant film only getting riper and better with the next chapter.

I honestly have a hard time deciding between the two films and chose to view them as one elongated masterpiece (refusing to accept the third, which is decent but nowhere near as good, as part of the film).  Continuing the story of the Corleone family, The Godfather Part II is interesting conceptually because it uses flashback sequences in order to parallel the rise of both father and son, showing Vitos humble rise to power and his son Michaels steady decline into the harsh realities of his family business, something he was so against in the first film.

Coppolas masterpiece (but then again, this is kind of one of many when it comes to him), The Godfather Part II is a rich character study that contains a slew of brilliant performances from the likes of Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Diane Keaton, Lee Strasberg and John Cazale, not to mention a slick visual sense of awareness and technical accomplishments to spare.  The lighting, the sound, the score, the sets; all of them come together to present the audience with a complete picture; a perfect film.

Starring a cast including Al Pacino and Robert De Niro with director Francis Ford Coppola, the film opens with a young Vito Corleone coming to America. The story switches gears to 1958 in Nevada where Michael Corleone has successfully moved the family. However, after a close call Michael goes to Miami and then Cuba to attend to some business having to do with a man named Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg). The story alternates off and on to Vito as a young man who begins making a life for himself. Upon returning to Michael, he is in a senate hearing where he narrowly avoids being indicted for his activities. From that point on Michael shows no mercy to anyone who is in his way and that includes his family. By the end of the film he is no longer the former idealistic Michael but a callous, cold mobster.",1370044800,,1282,4.482905982905983

2251177,5,B0007Y08MY,"I was 15 years old when the Godfather Part II was filming on the streets of NY.  I knew that the Godfather Part I was a huge success, but I hadn't seen it yet.  I know I never saw it in the theater and back then they didn't put films like that on TV for a while, plus home video did not exist yet.

Back in 1973 grandmother heard from a friend that the producers of the Godfather Part II were advertising in the Italian neighborhoods for extras, and given that she was a full blooded 66 year old Sicilian and up for a fun time with a friend, she managed to get cast as a non-speaking extra in the film.  I remember that she spent several weeks going way downtown to the street in lower Manhattan where they had set up their very elaborate and true-to-period street scene circa 1915, complete with pushcarts.  It's a scene that would have been familiar to her from her youth, as she and her mother used to shop on the Lower East Side all the time.

Grandma had a great time during the filming, but she complained about not being able to wear makeup as the production staff said that it would not look authentic enough for the time and place.  One evening, toward the end of filming, my parents, (who worked in Manhattan at the time) went to have dinner with her on the set.  The extras were lined up to get food from an outdoor food truck that was specially arranged for them, from which my father said he had the best sausage and pepper sandwich he ever had and probably ever will have (he is now 85).  My only regret is that I somehow was unable to come with them that day, and because of that I have been kicking myself for 40 years ever since.  It would have involved getting on the subway and meeting them there as we lived in the Bronx.  If I knew then what I know now about what a huge classic this film was going to become in the future, I definitely would have made that trip!

For years, my grandmother downplayed her role in the film (probably because she was hung up on being on the screen without makeup, LOL).  She never told me that her face is as large as life right behind Vito and Genco in the vaudeville theater scene where ""Peppino"" laments leaving Naples and his mamma for a ""no good tramp"".  I didn't see the film until years later on VHS on a 20 inch tube TV so I never noticed her.  Then one day 7 or 8 years ago I was flipping channels and found myself watching the theater scene.  Of course, by then I had a much larger tube TV and I was able to see my grandmother's unmistakable face with no problem.  Because the dialog went on for a while I kept seeing her face again and again.  There was a moment of recognition where I could not believe my eyes - There she was, immortalized forever in one of the most classic films of the 20th century!  Of course, by then my grandma had been dead for 20 years.

I don't know why, but it's taken me until now to actually own a copy of the film, but I'm actually glad I waited.  This restoration is so good that grandma is larger and crisper than I have ever seen her.  I compared this version with my friend's older, non-restored DVD, and this one is far superior, especially on a HDTV.  If I ever get a blu-ray player I will definitely get that version as I am all about seeing better quality versions of this film.

I was never into the gangster movie genre.  I appreciated the Sopranos from a distance but was never able to really get into it.  Same thing with the Godfather trilogy.  I suppose that because I am half Sicilian it somehow bothers me that Sicilians are always identified with organized crime and boneheaded ""tough guys"", when most Sicilians are not like that at all nor have anything to do with organized crime.  That said, after so many years I am finally appreciating the Godfather films for the masterpieces that they are, and as period pieces depicting another time and place.  I suppose being a teenager when they came out, I was not ready for them yet.  Now that I am, I am totally amazed at their authenticity and greatness as works of cinematic art.  I am proud that my grandmother is ""immortalized on the silver screen"".  She was a beauty when she was young and in my mind and heart still beautiful in this movie with or without makeup.  It's a shame that I never knew just how prominently her face appeared in the film until many years after her death.  Thanks to the ""miracle of modern technology"", I am able to appreciate it now for the rest of my life.",1353801600,16,4448,4.255952380952381

2251186,5,B0007Y08MY,"I've seen the Godfather trilogy many times over the years, and I watched it fresh in order to write this review. When so many sequels fall flat, The Godfather part 2 does a great job of holding steady with the high bar set by the first. The first movie gave us the here-and-now, the strength of the family. This second one gives us both the future and the past. We see how Don Corleone started from a young, honorable family man to building up his reputation and community care. We also see how his son, Michael, watches his family unravel around him.

There are so many great actors here, so many great scenes and lines. The looks, the touches, are just amazing. It shows how amazing a movie can be when everything comes together just right. You get a powerful glimpse into issues of racism, both back when Don Corleone is living in the run-down streets of his young adulthood, and also when Michael deals with the modern power structure.

I love the scenes in Italy, with their strong sense of life there. I love the scenes in old New York, where you see how the Italian immigrants band together (and sometimes tear each other apart). I love the delicate interplay of family members, their long term issues bubbling to the surface.

One reason I rewatched this was to see if this passed the Bechdel Test. Sure, it's #21 on the AFI list, but does it have two named female characters who talk with each other about something other than men? It seemed a simple enough task for this epic film. After all we have the mom, we have Michael's wife, and his sister just to start. But ironically it does in fact seem that the few times the women talk it's about Michael. Connie pleads with her mom to let her talk to Michael. Connie pleads with Kay to leave before Michael gets home. There is a scene where Don Corleone's wife brings in a neighbor to plead for help. Even there, they don't really talk with each other. So despite there being some stellar actresses here, their main role is to be a part in a male dominated scene.

Still, a minor complaint about an exceptional movie. Highly recommended, and well worth watching numerous times to pick up on the myriad of subtle details which fill the story.",1324684800,,2199,4.49
2251194,5,B0007Y08MY,"""The Godfather Part II"" is a brilliant follow up to the Corleone Crime Family story. Flashbacks provide deeper insight into Vito Corleone, and Michael Corleone certainly presents as a hardened Godfather, despite his efforts in the first film to not join the family business. The narrative is intricate and well presented, and loyalties even within the family are not spared from treachery.

2251197,5,B0007Y08MY,"This film came out in 1974, two years after the original Godfather hit the screen. Wow!  In many ways it is even better than the original because it includes the back stories of all the major players in the saga, filling in the gaps from the original film.  Again we meet Michael Corleone  played by Al Pacino.  He now lives in Nevada and is at the peak of his power.  Robert Duval is still around as his consigliere and  Diane Keaton is still his wife.  What's different is the introduction of a back story to the original film, with Robert DeNiro as the young Vito Corleone, the part played by Marlon Brando in the original version of the film.

Frances Ford Coppola directed this film as well as partnered in writing it with Mario Puzo, the author of the original Godfather. The result is a masterpiece and the complex and believable plot enhances the original and gives even more depth to the story.

Here are flashbacks to 11-year old Vito fleeing his native Sicily after his mother and brother are murdered,  living as an immigrant in New York assisting a elderly widow who is about to be evicted from her tenement apartment and as a hard working young father who outsmarts the other racketeers in building his empire.  Later we rejoice when he returns to Sicily to even old scores.

Some of the scenes are shot in darkness, reinforcing the ominous tension throughout and as the story weaves from the past to the present and then back again it felt as if the pieces of a puzzle were all coming together.  The story moves into the era of congressional hearings, the Cuban uprising and introduces the a character loosely based on Meyer Lansky played by Lee Strasberg.

This film is 200 minutes long.  But frankly, I didn't want it to end because it was just so good.",1310342400,2,1770,4.539432176656152

2251199,5,B0007Y08MY,"While the background provided in Godfather II to Vito Corleone's life reaffirms the impressions of the first film, the image that emerges of Vito's son and successor, Michael Corleone, forces a reevaluation of that character.

By the end of Godfather II, Michael is no longer the outsider who was accidentally drawn into the business by his desire to protect his father.  Rather, it was his father who groomed him as the business's outside member, to serve the family business as a judge or politician.  When his father is weakened by the attempted assassination, Michael seizes the moment to rebel -- he begins to act on what appears to have been his longstanding desire to rival and ultimately to replace his father, and he acts on it precisely by entering the business.

From this perspective, the corruption of power that we see in the course of Godfather II does not warp Michael.  Rather, it deepens his essential character.

Playing with a hugely successful commercial film property and particularly darkening it in this very un-Hollywood way was an impressive bit of risk-taking, which clearly paid off.

The filmmakers also dramatize the growing conflict between the Washington political establishment and the Corleone-type business, leading to a transparent pre-enactment of Jack Ruby's killing of Lee Harvey Oswald.  Again, risking a commercial film property by snubbing the official, lone-gunman claim about JFK's assassination and hinting at the organized crime hypothesis, while arguably providing a public service, is remarkable.  Fortunately, it seems not to have reduced the film's appeal (or perhaps was not noticed).",1306627200,,1635,5.3062015503875966

2251203,2,B0007Y08MY,"I wished I'd liked this movie more.  There were some excellent parts, and some excellent characters played by excellent actors.  I especially loved the early 20th century scenes with young Vito Corleone, when he was both a boy and a young man.  And everything set in Sicily was masterful.  Basically, most of what was taken literally from the original Godfather book was fantastic.  And basically most else stunk.

A list of the stink, in no particular order:

1) Frank Pentangeli was a silly character.  His inclusion at all was revisionist history, because they made him out to be a vitally important historic character in the Corleone family, and yet he was never once mentioned in the first movie or the book.  Silly.

2) Rocco Lampone would never sacrifice his own life so carelessly just to kill Hyman Roth, and a terminally ill Hyman Roth at that!

3) Diane Keaton becomes extremely and unnecessarily annoying in this movie.

4) Mama Corleone is terribly acted:  she comes across looking like a tall, heavy 45-year-old American fashion model unsuccessfully trying to portray a 65-year-old Sicilian grandma.

5) Fanucci overacts, and his part is overwritten on top of it, to the point that he comes across appearing stupid.  The book portrays him fantastically, with subtlety that this movie misses entirely.

6) Ditto for Signore Roberto.

7) The movie's ending is just a cheap, dirty, caricatured, retread of the first movie.

8) Little psychological logic in the way Michael had Fredo killed.  For instance, for no reason whatsoever (aside from increasing dramatic tension in ""kill-the-dog"" fashion), Michael let his son Anthony play with Fredo minutes before Fredo was murdered.  The only consequence of that, in reality, would be that that someday Michael's son, when he figured out what had happened, would despise Michael.  Thus Michael is portrayed as a dumb chess player who can't think more than one step ahead, which is out of character.

9) All the glitzy Lake Tahoe and Vegas scenes become incredibly tiresome.

10) Ditto for the Cuba glitz.

11) It became silly to have all the Corleone Cuban drama play out right on the night of Castro's overthrow of Batista.  The implication, which, sadly, is correct, is that the movie's storyline is so weak that it needs to be buttressed by extra-important historical facts.

12) I hate to say it, but Robert DeNiro didn't need to imitate Marlon Brando's throaty voice.  A drop more of his own natural voice would have been better.  (That said, aside from that DeNiro was brilliant.)

13) The 3 hour and 20 minute director's version was too long!

In closing, if this movie has a theme, it is the explicit version, with no subtlety whatsoever, of what was, if you are a thinking person, implicit in the first movie and the book:  that crime doesn't pay, that crime destroys, and that power ultimately corrupts.  Overall, in my opinion, this movie would have been better left unmade.",1295308800,6,2941,4.9266802443991855

2251207,5,B0007Y08MY,"'The Godfather Part II does not so much continue the story of 'Part I' as expand it in different directions. Instead of being a sequel in the true sense, 'Part II' tells two parallel stories. Firstly, we follow the young Vito Corleone as he rises from child immigrant to small time crook to local criminal kingpin. Secondly, we witness a continuation of the events of 'Part I', with Michael Corleone aggressively pushing into Nevada and Cuba, while battling internal betrayal and political investigations.

As many have noted, 'Part II' is a film of contrasts, both within itself and with the original film. The relatively warm, close-knit family structure of Part I has started to disintegrate into a divided, treacherous collection of individuals by Part II. And the ""honourable"" motivations of Vito's time have been replaced by a blind pursuit of money and power at all costs. Even the setting is a complete contrast from Part I; I can think of no better way to demonstrate the betrayal of everything Vito stood for than to shift the Family from the cultured, dignified New York to the capitalist wasteland of 1950's Nevada.

As before, the acting is impeccable. This is hands down the best ensemble cast you are likely to see in a movie. Al Pacino gives a very intense performance as the now cold and emotionless Michael, which is paralleled by Diane Keaton's more assertive Kay. Robert Duvall is again excellent as Tom, who begins to question Michael's increasingly violent and punitive methods (apparently this was supposed to be a plot point for Part III). And Robert De Niro is completely believable as the younger Vito, a cocky young criminal who still has respect for his friends and family. But you can pick any role: John Cazale as the weak and insecure Fredo, Lee Strasberg as the physically wasted but still-ruthless Hyman Roth, Talia Shire as the flaky Connie, and Michael Gazzo as the conflicted Pentangeli all deliver outstanding performances. The consistent excellence on display here means that Marlon Brando is never missed, which some people feared might be the case.

'The Godfather Part II' is often regarded as being that rare sequel that's superior to the original, and I would have to agree. While retaining nearly everything that made 'Part I' great, this film is even more ambitious than its predecessor, and every risk it takes pays off. The exceptional performances do justice to the film's multi-layered story, and the direction and production are of the highest quality. Quite simply, one of the best films ever made.....

2251212,5,B0007Y08MY,"The Godfather Part II has the rare distinction of being arguably the best sequel ever made, and one of the very few that is every bit on par with its corresponding original film in the franchise. The two films compliment each other by having a little something the other does not. For classic scenes and an inspired storyline, something that comes to someone in a dream perhaps once in a lifetime, the original rightly excels as an iconic masterpiece; for a dark political web of intrigue, a distinct, duplicitous villain and acting from Al Pacino that positively drips with subtext, Godfather II sticks in the craw in the best possible way.

The young Al Pacino was often exemplary, and his performance here should be required viewing in acting school. Pacino's take on Michael's  muted mental and emotional turmoil and the subtle power of his projection of this on to the screen is a special magic rarely achieved by others. One can't help but suspect that the presence of Pacino's mentor, Lee Strasberg - of The Actor's Studio - had somehow fueled his protg to greater heights than he had thus far reached. Indeed, the final confrontation between Michael and a lecturing Hyman Roth illustrates this beautifully, and is perhaps one of the greatest examples of an actor really performing while saying nothing.

Great performances abound: Robert De Niro is of course perfectly cast as a young Don Vito, and the supporting roles are all so well played that it's difficult to find one that shines above another. Character acting abounds in a locomotive of a plot that gorgeously showcases some of the darker side of human nature, as Godfather II might, just might, be a smidge more noir than the original.",1273795200,4,1703,4.845360824742268
2251213,5,B0007Y08MY,"If you liked The Godfather, you should like Part II as well.  It doesn't quite have the punch of the original, but it's still a worthy and gripping continuation of the story, taking us both backward and forward in time.

By looking at the past, we learn about Vito Corleone's origins, and I found the portrayal of immigrant Italian life to be particularly interesting.  Vito comes across not as a naturally aggressive or cunning person, but more as someone who's circumstances steered him towards his eventual life as a mobster.

When looking at the future, we see how Michael Corleone's story evolves.  What I found most interesting here is that Michael, like his father, comes across more as a serious and disciplined businessman rather than a violent person eager to physically intimidate (or harm) people.  We also see that, in exchange for his power and wealth, Michael pays a dear price in terms of deeply strained or severed family relationships; ""lonely at the top"" indeed.

Finally, I'd like to emphasize that, unlike other mafia movies (and The Sopranos), there isn't really a great deal of machismo or violence in this movie.  It's more about the stories of people trying to find their way in life, struggling to define their values and allegiances and goals, trying to figure out how to work with people or oppose them, etc.  In that sense, this movie is layered with themes, and some of them are fairly subtle.

Overall, highly recommended, especially to fans of the original movie.",1271721600,,1495,4.873517786561265

2251217,5,B0007Y08MY,"You can write the volumes about the Godfather, Part 2 phenomena. There is nothing that has not been said about it greatness, magnificence, perfection that radiate in every aspect, every moment, every inch of every frame, every performance, quote, glance, in the sound of the music, in both parts of the story, past and present that take the viewer to the journey in search of American Dream that turn to the epic vision of gaining ultimate power coming with ultimate loneliness. The story of one family of Italian Immigrants begins in Sicily in 1901, goes to New York City's ""Little Italy"" and spans over the most part of the 20th century. The viewers and the critics often argue which film is better, the original Godfather (1972) or Part 2. (1974). Both films are perfect in every way, and the vision and moviemaking talent of a young director named  Francis Ford Coppola are simply awesome. His idea of making an American epic, the story of one family raise to power, the price it takes and the eventual fall instead of a low budget fast moving gangster movie as the MGM studio had planned proved to be the stroke of genius. It is not easy to choose the best of two but I prefer Part II because I found the way Coppola tells two parts of the story by intertwining them and cutting effortlessly, seamlessly between the different time periods and geographic locations - incomparable. Yes, it's been done before and after him but never was I touched so deeply and amazed by the artistry and brilliancy of moving between past and future. I am surprised that the film was not rewarded for the editing because the team of editors contributed enormously in what is the magic of The Godfather, Part II.  The film is unique by being at the same time a prequel and a sequel to the original Godfather because it tells the stories of young Vito Corleone first steps to the top of the criminal world and of Michael, his youngest son who became Godfather after his father passing. Part 2 has the most important scene in the whole trilogy, the scene when Vito kills Don Fanucci - the choice that would eventually lead to his raise as the crime family patriarch. I can go on forever. It is known how many great performances Al Pacino gave back in the 70s, his prime time (four Oscar nominations in the row, 1973-1976) but Michael Corleone in Part 2 is something that has to be studied and admired for as long as the young aspiring actors dream of not being stars but the ACTORS. I am not a fan of Pacino's latest films and roles. He screams a lot, he overplays but all screams can't say more than one glance from the scene during the New Year Celebration in Habana. He said so much by his eyes only that had literally darkened with disbelief, grief, anger, and despair when he realized that he had been betrayed by his own brother Fredo - who broke his heart and left the viewers heartbroken. John Casale had only given five performances during his tragically short career but every one of them was remarkable and every movie he worked in belongs to the best America has produced. ...Robert de Niro speaking only Italian as young Vito gives one of his finest performances. He plays a beautiful, dignified, decent man, hard working, loving father and husband who would stop at nothing to make his family happy the best way he knows how... And above all - the melancholic, melodious, mournful score by Nino Rota, the Requiem for a dream, the best Rota's tunes outside Federico Fellini films, As great as it is, Godfather Part II would never be the same without musical themes written by Nino Rota specifically for the film, especially the main theme or the Kay theme - the sound of love lost and longing... And in the end - perhaps the best flash back scene ever filmed, Christmas and Vito Corleone's birthday celebration - the family is close together, the grown up children sit around the table, talk about future, some choices have been made, but there is no alienation, betrayal, losses, regrets, death....yet.",1259539200,2,3999,4.623066104078762
2251218,5,B0007Y08MY,"Although many consider this sequel to be better than the original, I am not so sure about that.  It is certainly a great movie, but so was 'The Godfather'.

This is a continuation of the story with Don Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) now in power.  There are flashbacks to his deceased father Don Vito Corleone (played by Robert Deniro in the sequel).  Both actors are superb.

The story itself is great.  There is a lot of action and intrigue in the Corleone crime family.  It will certainly keep viewers entertained throughout.

I would definitely recommend watching 'The Godfather' before seeing this one.  Although I think it would do fairly well as a standalone, it will be even better for those who benefit from knowing the background of the first one.",1248566400,,755,4.746153846153846
2251219,5,B0007Y08MY,"Two years after Francis Ford Coppola made an indelible mark on Hollywood with ""The Godfather"", he returned with writer Mario Puzo to add to the saga of the Corleones.  Part II is an ambitious film - it cuts back and forth between two timelines.  One tells the story of the original Godfather - Vito.  This part relies heavily upon Puzo's original novel.  The second part tells about Michael, Kay, Fredo and Tom Hagen starting about seven years after the end of the first film.

Essentially the entire cast returned for part II, with the exception of Marlon Brando.  The cast for this film is augmented by Robert Deniro, who won the Academy Award for best supporting actor, and Michael V. Gazzo and Lee Strasberg, who were also nominated for the same award.  Bruno Kirby, John Cazale, Robert Duvall and G.D. Spradlin could all have received the same nomination.  Talia Shire returns as Connie Corleone, and she was nominated for best supporting actress.

We see in early scenes the young Vito Andolini circa approximately 1900, born in the town of Corleone, Siciliy.  His father is murdered after insulting a local mafia chief and his brother Paolo is murdered during his father's funeral procession after vowing revenge.  Vito is spirited to a ship headed for Ellis Island and an immigration official assigns Vito the surname of his Italian home-town rather than his father.

We see the rest of the family at their Lake Tahoe home about seven years after the end of the first movie, celebrating the first communion of son Anthony.  Like the other films, this one opens with a large celebration that gathers the cast to allow the audience to become familiar with them prior to settling down to business with the Don.

Michael is planning a large deal in both Vegas and Havana, and he is eager to not let old New York contacts, represented by Gazzo as Frank Pentangili, interfere with his plans with Hyman Roth, played by Lee Strasberg.

When an assassination attempt floods Michael and Kay's bedroom with bullets, Michael realizes he had to be betrayed by someone very close to the family.  He turns the family business temporarily over to Duvall's Tom Hagen while he takes a trip to try to save the big family deals and discover the identify of the betrayer.

The scene where Michael unexpectedly discovers the traitor is one of the most famous pieces of wordless acting in film history.

We see scenes of the early Vito, played as a young adult by young Robert Deniro, mixed with the scenes of Michael fifty years later.  We see that Vito comes to the business by a sense of necessity, but uses his power as the Don with great human compassion, while Michael, who we know ten years earlier had no intention of joining the family business, becomes a more cruel Mafia Kingpin than his father.

The first two Godfather films are not only ""The Standard"" for films about organized crime: they are among the best films ever made. Period.",1240272000,2,2932,4.745562130177515

2251221,4,B0007Y08MY,"Many people consider ""The Godfather Part II"" to be the best film in ""The Godfather"" series, but for me, although I consider it to be an excellent film, it just didn't quite match the brilliance of its predecessor. ""The Godfather Part II"" is effectively two films combined into one. The main plot continues the story of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) from where the first film left off, while a secondary plot tells the story of Michael's father, Vito Corleone (Robert DeNiro) and how he became the Godfather in the first place. Although these stories never intersect, they are connected by the themes of family and revenge.

The story of Vito is the stronger portion of the movie. This story has a similar arc to the first ""Godfather"" movie, in that both show how a man can transition from an honest life to one of crime, and it did not surprise me to learn that this sub-plot was also based on material from Mario Puzo's novel. The plot about Michael, however, is all new material written especially for the movie and it lacks the direction and focus of the Vito plot. Michael's character arc was more or less completed in the first film. He has already transitioned from being an upstanding citizen to being a cold, hardened criminal, and all that is left for him to do is to become colder and harder. This second transition just didn't hold my interest the way the original arc did.

I have heard ""The Godfather Part II"" described as being a ""companion piece"" to ""The Godfather"", alongside claims that both films should be watched together in order to fully understand the saga of the Corleone family. Having just watched both films, I am glad that I have seen them both, but I feel that in future, I will only rewatch the first film. For me, the first film alone conveyed a stronger message than these two ""Godfather"" films combined.",1239321600,2,1835,4.643076923076923
2251222,5,B0007Y08MY,"Most sequels don't do justice when compared to the originals (such as Jaws 2, Speed 2, Poltergeist 2, and of course, every Disney sequel ever created). Only a few are either equal or better than the original (Terminator 2, The Dark Knight, Aliens). The Godfather Part II is considered to be either equal or better than the original classic Godfather. I guess it depends on everyone's opinion.

But anyway, this is yet another phenomenal masterpiece by master filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. It has a much grander scale, mainly because it focuses on two stories. The contrast between young Vito Corleone rising as a powerful Don and the ascension of his son Michael many years later is so painfully obvious. Here, we have young Vito spreading his love with his own family while still making progress in his own private (and seemingly dangerous) business. And then we have Michael, whose cold heart and harsh judgments start to destroy those close around him. Vito would not be proud of how his business is being run during the 50's.

While the first Godfather is set in New York City, Las Vegas, Hollywood, and Sicily, the locations in second Godfather is much more broad: Corleone in Sicily, New York City, Lake Tahoe, Florida, Pre-revolutionary Cuba, etc. They all look so beautiful and they all match with the appearance and feeling of the film.

The strongest points of this film are the performances by the actors. No doubt whatsoever that Robert de Niro was born to play young Vito Corleone. He's got the calm appearance, firm intelligence, and the Sicilian language down perfectly. He deserved the Oscar win. Al Pacino continues to amaze as Michael Corleone. His silent and not-so-silent rage is so believable, I would be so afraid to be standing face-to-face with this guy. Diane Keaton is a great actress, and she shows her outstanding acting abilities during the fight with Kay and Michael. It's an immensely intense scene, and kudos to actress Talia Shire for the suggestion that would break Michael's heart forever. Robert Duvall does what he does best as Tom Hagen; his professional look is truly outstanding. Michael Gazzo as Frankie Pentangeli is overall very worthwhile, although I do miss Richard Castellano as Peter Clemenza. Lee Strasberg knows how to be a good antagonist, and he shows it off as Hyman Roth. He really knows what makes people hate villains; it's a performance no one would ever forget. The standout in the film is the late John Cazale as Fredo, Michael's brother. Considered the weakest son in the Corleone family, his desire for respect and love is so heartbreaking. I could almost feel for the guy when he confronts Michael during the snowfall. Unfortunately, Cazale died of cancer when filming The Deer Hunter. I could only imagine what sort of success he would've achieved in film if he survived.

In my opinion, The Godfather Part II is equal to the original Godfather. Both are now a part of my favorite films list. I haven't seen The Godfather Part III just yet, and many people agree that it is the weakest in the trilogy. I see for myself if it's underrated, so-so, or just plain crappy.

The story centers around the brutal vengeance of youngest brother Michael (Al Pacino). It also gives a good demonstration of how the gangster lifestyle may look attractive on the outside but really is an unhappy one despite the wealth.

2251226,5,B0007Y08MY,"A sequel to any film, whether it follows a smaller movie, a mega blockbuster, or an instant classic, can be a daunting task to undertake for any director no matter how talented he or she may be. In the case of acclaimed director Francis Ford Coppola he was faced with one of the greatest sequel challenges of all, making a second chapter, in what would eventually become an epic trilogy, to the magnificent gangster ode, ""The Godfather"".

""The Godfather Part 2"" takes place a few years after the climactic ending to the mafia war, as Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) oversees all facets of the Corleone family business from their new home in Las Vegas. As Michael continues to lead the family in a similar fashion to that of his father, his vow to move the family into strictly legitimate business dealings is proving much more difficult than he had anticipated. With new enemies appearing in virtually every direction, and treachery around every corner, leaving no one above suspicion; Michael must do all he can to ensure his family's legacy without losing everything he has worked so hard to attain. So the question is in whom do you trust when even those closest to you may have betrayed?

Here's the astounding part about director Francis Ford Coppola's achievement with his second installment in the ""Godfather"" saga; besides the fact that Francis returned as both co-writer and director for the sequel, a massive chore all its own, is the reality that his sequel may have actually managed to surpass the original movie, which is one of the most iconic films of American cinema. Francis and co-writer Mario Puzo (author of ""The Godfather"" novel and co-writer of all three films) did an amazing job of crafting yet another gripping gangland saga centered around the Corleone family, without really repeating anything they had done in the previous film; starting with the structure for this one's storyline.

The first film's story was very linear from start to finish, whereas in ""The Godfather Part 2"" the story takes place in two time periods. The primary story takes place within the present day as Michael runs the Corleone family operations, and struggles to maintain his power and keep his family together; the secondary storyline occurs via flashbacks that showcase Vito Corleone (played by Robert DeNiro) arriving in America and his subsequent rise to power within the underworld of organized crime. What I found most intriguing about the two separate storylines is how Francis edited the film together to make them run concurrently with each other, in essence providing the audience a comparison between father and son, and the differences in how they handled their business. An interesting side note is that the flashbacks of young Vito were a part of the novel (which is essentially the original film's story); however, since these segments were not included in the previous film, Francis and Mario felt they would fit in nicely within the sequel to serve as a parallel between the two men and their families.

""The Godfather Part 2"" also included some intriguing story elements that seemed to mirror events that had occurred in our nation's fight against ""La Cosa Nostra"", namely Joe Valachi's admission to the congressional committee on organized crime that the mafia did indeed exist, and the inquisitions of mafia members that followed that event. The inclusion of the United States government's investigation into organized crime within the movie's storyline created an added depth and realism to the proceedings. While at the same time these moments within the film allows the audience to see just how twisted, dangerous and powerful Michael has become, and how far from his original plan of becoming legitimate he has gone in such a short time.

Many of the primary cast members for ""The Godfather Part 2"" were reprising their roles from the original film. Even though many members of the cast were playing characters that they no doubt had become reasonably familiar with; each actor or actress seemed to bring a fresh approach to their characters, almost as if they were portraying them for the first time. Thus serving as an example of just how different almost every single one of the returning characters had become since the conclusion of ""The Godfather"".

Al Pacino and Diane Keaton continued to have great onscreen chemistry as Michael and Kay Corleone. Every one of their numerous verbal exchanges was charged full of emotion and intensity, never once disappointing for even an instant. I appreciated that the story for Kay continued to build upon the revelation she had at the end of the original film, where she realized what exactly Michael had become and just how much she had sacrificed to be with him. Seeing her continued struggle with herself and Michael just building to a crescendo over the course of this film was intriguing, and provided some of the most intensely dramatic moments within the series. I was impressed by the way Al Pacino took Michael into even darker, and at times frightening, areas of his character, to the point that the innocence he once had in the first film is all but destroyed by the darkness he has embraced for his life. ""The Godfather Part 2"" is the movie where Al Pacino truly began to shine as an actor (in my opinion), and where we as an audience began to see the incredible passion and drive that he brings to each of his performances first beginning to manifest.

Three other returning cast members were Robert Duvall, Talia Shire, and John Cazale; all three delivered solid performances, especially Robert and John, both of whom seemed to receive even more screen time than previously. Talia was strong during her moments on screen, although she wasn't involved in this story as much as she was in the first one (which even then wasn't a whole lot); yet her scenes still provided plenty of dramatic punch and she made the most of the time she was allotted. Robert Duvall once again gave a terrific performance as Tom Hagen, the one-time consigliere turned family lawyer. Throughout the mid-section of the film, Robert was given an opportunity to take Tom in a new, more powerful direction which he handled perfectly and even added a hint of menace to the character that surprised me. Lastly, John Cazale as middle brother Freddo benefited greatly from a beefed up story compared to his previous turn as the weak-willed sibling. John showed us in ""The Godfather"" that he was a good actor, but it wasn't until this film that we were shown just how talented he really was. One scene in particular near the end of the movie provides John his moment to shine opposite Al Pacino, and in these few brief moments, John completely steals the scene away from Al with a devastatingly emotional performance.

One other cast member worthy of note would be Robert DeNiro as a young Vito Corleone. His scenes in the various flashbacks sprinkled throughout the film are superb. When watching his portrayal, with all the little nods to Brando's performance, and the flashes of intensity and power, it's not surprising that Robert won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this role.

Achieving what I personally would have believed impossible at the time, ""The Godfather Part 2"" manages to at least equal its predecessor, and possibly even surpasses it in the end. With a gripping dramatic story that spans two generations, incredible performances, and an ending that will leave you stunned, ""The Godfather Part 2"" is as perfect a continuation of the story from the original film as anyone could have ever hoped for.

He soon learns that it is easier to make money on the wrong side of the law and recruits a small gang of fellow Sicilians.

The Godfather, Part II is arguably the greatest film of all time. It is the only sequel to win Best Picture and, in my opinion, is  almost better than the first movie. Al Pacino gives an unforgettable performance in this movie as does Robert De Niro. Francis Ford Coppola's use of the two story lines going at the same time is wonderful.
The Robert De Niro (Young Vito Corleone) story line is the only part of the Godfather novel that was left out of the first film and it shows the rise of the Godfather. The Al Pacino (Michael Corleone) story line shows how Michael continues the family business after the first film. Both story lines are incredible and when they are put together it makes one of the greatest films of all time.
There is some very powerful cinematography in this film. The scenes are wonderfully shot on location in Nevada, New York, Sicily, and Cuba. I praise Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola for the best sequel ever!!

2251234,5,B0007Y08MY,"The Godfather II is about as good as any sequel can get, it many ways it is a much more ambitious film that the first, but with so many great characters gone from the first film I just can't give it top seed in this argument. Marlon Brando created one of the more memorable characters in the history of film in the first film and with him, Tessio, Clemenza and Sonny gone, it is amazing that the second film is any good at all.

Amazing yes, but despite this, the film happens to be almost as good as the first and certainly on the level. Part of the credit goes to the casting of Robert DeNiro, Bruno Kirby and John Apea as the young Don, Clemenza and Tessio coming to power. I could have watched an entire film of these three characters, but there is more! Pacino and Cazale give fantastic performances as Michael and Fredo and the mix of old and new have never worked better, it is an incredible film.

I have been spoiled because I own a VHS collection that includes all 3 films sewn together in chronological order and makes the 3 individual films pale in comparison. Why this has not been released on DVD is beyond me! When watching the individual films I must rank the first as the best. I think part two is great, but Brando's Don is such an incredible character that even Pacino can't fill the void. DeNiro does an excellent job playing young Vito and the film as a whole is exceptional. I just like the original better even if the sequel is more ambitious. The new DVD and Blu Ray transfers look better than ever with a ton of interesting extras. The Blu Ray box set in recommended.",1188604800,,1592,4.321070234113712
2251235,3,B0007Y08MY,"Godfather Part 2 is so hailed as the greatest film of all time it's time someone burst that overblown bubble and I've got the needle right here.  So let's take a closer look at what should be considered a mediocre sequel to the classic film, The Godfather.  First of all Marlon Brando is nowhere to be seen here.  Instead we get random flashbacks to Robert Deniro as the young Vito. We get some good scenes of old Little Italy though there's a Keystone-cops feel to some of it, especially the comic relief of the slumlord scene.

Part 2 has a much bigger budget but a script with weakened plotlines and dialogue, basically trying to followup everything from Part 1 logically becoming formulaic and soap-operaish, and ending up falling flat.

  The film begins with another celebration of some kind.  A brother's betrayal aspires to be that of Hamlet, but without the depth or wit (or brevity).  It's now the 1950s and Mike is in Nevada and is trying to buy a corrupt Senator.  The Senator is I suppose the film producer element of the first, but with nothing creative like a horsehead...just crass dialogue that doesn't ring true.  We also get a Mafia hearing in Congress which should have ended up on the cutting room floor.
  We also get (the great?) Lee Strasberg as some old shirtless and feeble mobster.  He may be a great teacher, but someone tell me why this is an Academy Award winning acting performance!  Am I just dumb?
  Al Pacino is great as always, this performance following Serpico, but his dialogue doesn't ring true.  When he begins, ""If history has taught us anything.."" I expect some deep wisdom to follow...needless to say it doesn't.  Talia Shire's character is also weakened compared to the original's Connie.  Here she just ""needs money"" and wants Mike to forgive Fredo because ""he's so sweet"".
  This mess of a sequel ends with a literal bloodbath, but following the formula of the first, and a final scene with the original cast (sans Brando) the actors of which were paid more than all their good work in the original.  I'm not saying it isn't worth seeing, just that it's inferior to the original in many ways.  But of course it isn't near as bad as Part 3.  My final criticism is that all these mob films intentionally or not glorify criminals.  Okay, now you can click ""no"".",1186704000,9,2304,4.641089108910891
2251236,5,B0007Y08MY,"Most critics and the Motion Picture Academy agree.  Godfather 2 is a worthy sequel to the blockbuster movie, The Godfather.

If you think that the Godfather saga is only about Organized Crime, you are wrong.  It is about Family dynamics in a Sicillian family who's business just happens to be Organized Crime.

Michael is the quintessential Idealist.  Whereas his father was a pragmatist bound in honor, and his brothers were respectivly a loose cannon and a milquetoast, Michaels idealism turned out to be his downfall.  Whereas a pragmatist can be flexible, an idealist always insists that he is right all the time, and he runs his life in such a manner.  When your life involves the Underworld, all your ideals will morph you into a pillar of granite.  This is what Godfather 2 is all about.

In it we see two stories running paralell tracks.  The first story is of Don Vito choosing to be a strongarm to protect his Family, his friends and his honor.  Then we see Michael trying to do the same thing, but his ideals get in the way and he chooses to abandon them.  He drive his friends and family away from himself by his sheer heartlessness and ruthlessness.  In the end of Godfather 2, he has no honor, for he kills everyone in his way.  Even his own brother, Fredo!  We see in the end him sitting alone on a bench with an icy stare. But after all, he believes that all his actions were not only neccesary, but RIGHT!!!  Michael tells Tom Hagen: ""I don't feel that I have to kill everybody!  Only my enemies.""  Yet to Michael, in the end, all those who do not agree with him are enemies!

To see Michael deal with his sins and attempt to buy his redemption, you must purchase Godfather 3 from Amazon.com!",1175299200,2,1709,4.490259740259741

He is so besotted with power that he does not want any one opposing him be it his wife, brother, or anyone. This movie shows us how life can change a ""War-hero"" to a power-drunk godfather.",1175212800,,345,4.492063492063492
2251238,5,B0007Y08MY,"Even better than the original - because it probes deeper into the personalities, especially of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) and his obsession with family and loyalty and snubbing out his enemies. He is quiet, educated, and coldly calculating. The movie traces his dealings in the 1950s-60s, set mainly in Nevada. Interspersed with these developments is the story of the rise of his father Don Vito Corleone in Little Italy in NYC in the 1920s, with Robert De Niro doing a brilliant job in that role. Both stories are excellently told. Despite my never quite understanding America's obsession with the mafia and its ilk, it's not hard to conclude that this is a major movie achievement.",1173571200,4,685,4.965217391304348

2251240,5,B0007Y08MY,"I'd read that Godfather II was a worthy sequel, so I was desperately hoping that this would be true - and, oh, how it was!  Although the movie was only filmed two years after the Godfather, about 7 years have gone by in the timeline of the story.  The Corleone family, under the guidance of their new leader Michael, have moved to Las Vegas to make money from gambling.  At the same time, the film also steps back into the past to show how Vito Corleone, Michael's deceased father and former Don, came to America and made his fortune.

As with the first film, the performances are incredible.  The standout actors are Al Pacino as Michael and Robert De Niro as the young Vito Corleone.  Both radiate power and dynamism the entire time they are on screen.  De Niro looks regal (as befits the older man played by Marlon Brando in the first movie) whilst Pacino smoulders, somehow looking much more mature than the Michael from the first film, with his eyes practically burning holes in the TV screen.  Some of the most moving shots were when Michael's face faded into Vito's, seeming to represent how the two characters were inextricably linked through time.

To watch the continuing transformation to Michael's character is both heartbreaking and fascinating.  At the start of the film we see how the Corleone family are falling apart - Connie has become wild and cold-hearted to punish Michael for her husband's murder, Fredo is as hopeless (although well-meaning) as ever and Kay has pretty much stopped hoping Michael will ever turn into the 'good' man she hoped he would.  Michael is also about to make some important business decisions, which cause tension and rivalry with other businessmen who don't want him to succeed.  This all creates a power keg of anger, violence and emotion that explodes across the next few hours with shattering consequences.  I thought it was a masterstroke to intertwine the present day happenings with the old story of Vito growing up.  The history of the family explains and enlightens so much.

There are too many great performances by secondary characters to mention.  Robert Duvall is sensational in his reprisal of the role of Tom Hagen. Diane Keaton completely nails the part of Kay - even when she reveals something completely shocking to Michael it is believable and her gaunt face seems to show all that has gone before.

The ending is completely satisfying, if indescribably tragic.  I was torn between hating Michael (particularly after he ordered a murder in the last minutes of the film that completely shocked me and showed how he has changed irredeemably) and yet I wanted to sob for him and for the loss of what his life might have been.  The final few minutes bring the stories of Michael and Vito together and leave you feeling like you've been punched in the stomach.

Overall, the Godfather II is just as iconic as the Godfather.  It's great to watch a sequel that continues the story so well and is faithful to the characters.  I have never seen a pair of films that so hauntingly and movingly trace the destruction of one man's soul and conscience.",1172361600,2,3105,4.753731343283582
2251241,5,B0007Y08MY,"This shows how Michael develops, fully in the saddle of power.  Not only is he very different from his father, but times have changed:  the family is splitting apart amidst new dangers and opportunities.  Throughout it all, Michael appears outwardly cool and in control and yet the stress is tearing him apart.  In so many ways, it is about terrible loss, even as the family enters new areas of profit.  Michael triumphs, but the cost is very very high.

The scenes about the origins of Vito, played by de Niro, are the best.  He is an actor of utter assurance, and you see him grow into the tough yet nurturing leader that he becomes, not a black guard like the thug he replaces, but someone who serves as he takes.  There is also the story of vengence and primal loss at the core of the film, which influences the other characters 50 years later.  Admittedly, it is a bit melodramatic, but it is deep as well.

The film is so dense with subtlety and intrigue that you can see it and re-interpret it innumerable times, always seeing more and always enjoying it yet again, such as his handling of the Senator from Nevada.  That makes this one of the very greatest and far superior ot most of the films you can find anywhere.

However, there are many things in this that are over the top, at least for me.  For example, Michael goes to Cuba, not just during the revolutionary turmoil, but on the very day that Fidel takes over Havanna.  Realistic?  Hardly.  But it made me feel, ""this is art, not life"", which bugged me as I had to suspend my disbelief consciously.

2251244,5,B0007Y08MY,"Times go on a-changing. The second generation, with a few flashbacks to the very origins of the Corleone family, how the last male survivor of the family is smuggled out of Sicily to the USA where he can start a new line, by changing his name circumstancially since it is a not too wise customs officer that gives him unknowingly a new family name, and without forgetting the vengeance he will have to achieve later rather than sooner for the killing of his father and brothers by the local Don in his village in Sicily. We see him establish his business in the 1920s by killing the local maffia boss in his neighborhood and taking over in a more humane and just way. But this is a flashback. We are interested in the next generation and what they can do in the 1950s. The takeover has already been dealt with in the first part. The apointed son for this takeover has already asserted his power over the five families that could challenge him in the previous film. Now he tries to develop his business. Drugs had been allowed but he remains rather distant from that trafficking. He develops his business in gambling, hotels, entertainment, in one word luxury industry or commerce. He tries to get into Las Vegas but is rebuffed by a local Senator, so he forgets about it. Then he tries to move into Cuba and take over some business there but too late it is the arrival of Castro. So he goes back to New York and Nevada, back to his traditional activities. But these attempts enable Coppola to show some new problematics that are coming up in the seond half of the 20th century. First of all the strong sectarianism Italians have to face from politicians who declare they support Italian-Americans as good patriots in front, and behind try to make them pay twice a service or to ostracize them out of their constituencies. At the same time they have to face congressional and judicial complications with hearings about their businesses and business practices that are accused of being too criminal to be accepted. In  other words we are beyond the time of Al Capone and Prohibition. And the world is also chaging. Cuba of course is a big change. But women are no longer what they used to be in this Sicilian culture. Women do not want to be simple ancillary appendices to men they do not see any more. This second generation Godfather is contronted to the abortion of his third chold and second son by his wife while he is in Cuba witnessing Castro's conquest of the island. Then she tries to take his children away and eventually get a divorce. She will get nothing except a separation but not the children. He also has to fight against some remnants of the old world that are handicaps and obstacles to his projects, such as the factr that he is the head of the family business and yet he is not the eldest son : hence he has to face his elder brothers, and that has been going on for a long time. The world is changing his way this time and he has to fight against the survival of what the world used to be. At this point this trilogy is becoming a vast fresco about the history of Italian-Americans or should I say Sicilian-Americans ? When the fresco is too vast we can wonder if it does not lose some of its possible meaning by diluting it into too many elements, periods and events. But it is certainly interesting to follow this intricate family history that verges onto a sitcom at times.

2251245,5,B0007Y08MY,"Early scenes feature prominently the Statue of Liberty, the symbol of not only freedom but hope for prosperity in the New World. She is, however, a solitary figure, and her promise comes at a price. The Godfather Part II is perhaps the greatest of American tragedy stories; a story about how overreaching in the pursuit of wealth and a corrosive  honor to family can lead to the disolution of the family itself. The film is thick with business about business, capitalism, greed, power, politics, faith, betrayal and denial. It features intertwined naratives charting the rise of father and son to power and the loss of not only control but meaning for the son. Michael Corleone came to the role of godfather reluctantly and then was consumed by it. His wife's name is Kay, but their marriage is one of decay. Below the surface of both stories of Vito and Michael Corleone is the story of the American immigrant experience and its corruption by bonds of the past and excesses of the rapidly changing American future, a future where old codes of honor prove increasingly elusive and then turn completely cancerous. The Godfather Part II rivals The Great Gatsby in telling the story of 20th century America. The conception, direction, staging and performing of the film rank the highest imaginable. It is a meditation on power and family and the arc of the country and stands as one of the most important statements in American cinema.",1167696000,,1432,4.844897959183673
2251246,5,B0007Y08MY,"Coppola's masterpiece is rivaled only by ""The Godfather, Part II"" in which the 1940s setting of the first movie is extended backwards and forwards to reveal the corrupting effect of power...The film, breathtaking in its scope and tragic grandeur, shows two parallel stories extending two different time periods: the early career of young Vito Corleone seen first around the turn of the 20th century in Sicily, and then in 1917, building his criminal underworld in the Italian ghettos of New York City, post World War I, plus that of his son, Michael (Al Pacino) desperately trying to keep his family together...

Al Pacino's performance is quiet and solemn... He is cold and ruthless, with a whole contrast from the idealistic innocent war hero we initially met at the beginning of the first film... Here he's a calculating and frightening force, seeking to expand casinos into Pre-Revolutionary Cuba and consolidating an empire surrounded by perfidy and treason, maintaining total confidence in his ability to control the situation whether testifying before enraging Senators or trying to outface his worst enemies...

The film's haunting final shot of a lonely, isolated paranoid Michael in his empty compound, is an unforgettable movie scene, a tragic portrait of a lonely and fully damned person, emotionally empty and finished, far from a waspish wife, more distant from a faithful lawyer...

De Niro's rise, from an orphan child by a family feud back in Italy to a hood in New York and his position as a respected Don, provides a welcome break from Pacino's relentless attitude... Since the people he kills seem to deserve it, Vito comes off better than Michael does, and it was wise of Coppola to shuffle the two stories together despite lengthy flashbacks and the disturbance of continuity...

The entire cast contributes greatly to the success of the film: Lee Strasberg, a fascinating mixture of lust and ruthlessness; G. D. Spradlin, absolutely right as the sinister and corrupt Nevada Senator; Michael V. Gazzo, unforgettable as the troubled gray-haired informer; Gastone Moschin, excellent as the blackmailer in white suit; John Cazale, marvelously timid as the vague, confused, and hesitant Fredo; Diane Keaton, clearly irrational as the long-suffering wife Kay; Talia Shire, too extravagant as the lousy mother; Troy Donahue too ambitious as the fortune-hunting suitor; and Robert Duvall excels as the confidant, and retainer to the all-powerful Corleone family...

Coppola's motion picture is not just a mere supply with new characters and events from the original, it's a far more complex and intimate movie than its predecessor... It is not really a sequel... It's just more... It cleverly shifts in time between two distinct narratives with extreme realistic violence and criminal mentality of gangsters...",1167436800,4,2825,5.282850779510023

I prefer ""The Godfather"" over part II, but I think that's because there were actors in the first film (Brando, obviously) not appearing in the second. Part II is a little darker, and not quite as romantic as the original. Nevertheless, it's a truly great film, and highly recommended. It's fascinating to watch Michael Corleone evolve and develop with such misery, trapped by circumstances, betrayed by those he loves. In some ways, the last scene felt a bit tacked-on, but it's very important to understanding his character.

2251249,5,B0007Y08MY,"THE GODFATHER was cinematic perfection, a film without flaw, considered by a great many to be the greatest film of all time.  There are just as many who believe its sequel - or, more appropriately, its ""continuation"" - is even better.  About 3/5 of THE GODFATHER: PART II is set in 1958, when Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) has taken over his father's crime syndicate.  The other 2/5 revolve around young Vito Corleone (played by Robert De Niro), his arrival in America and his start as a young Mafioso.  The film focuses particularly on how each Corleone runs the business and how they treat their families: Michael is clever and ruthless, but treats his family as though they were prizes, inanimate objects; Vito was very wise and deep in his heart, thoughtful, running the syndicate as though it were a business and always taking care of his family.

While THE GODFATHER was no light-hearted romp, THE GODFATHER: PART II is considerably darker.  I found Marlon Brando's Vito Corleone to be a likable guy, perhaps because Brando is my favorite actor and perhaps because I saw the good in him.  Michael Corleone, however, is a monster, a heartless fiend who wipes out anyone who gets in his way - family or otherwise.  Pacino is outstanding; this performance is the highlight of his career.  Robert De Niro is marvelous as well; he deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar.  Shockingly - or not so shockingly, depending on your opinion of the Academy Awards - Al Pacino did not win an Oscar for his performance, though he was nominated.  He lost to Art Carney in HARRY AND TONTO.  Lee Strasberg and particularly Michael V. Gazzo are both excellent as well.

Nino Rota's sweeping, grandiose score sounds even more magnificent here and really adds to the epic feel of the film.  Director Francis Ford Coppola and GODFATHER author Mario Puzo do a fantastic job with the script, part of which is adapted from the original GODFATHER novel (the Vito Corleone flashbacks) and part of which is original (the Michael Corleone scenes).  This film has as many unforgettable scenes as THE GODFATHER, and some memorable lines (""I know it was you, Fredo.  You broke my heart.  You BROKE my heart!"").  One of my favorites comes from Michael: ""If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone.""

Francis Ford Coppola's directing is truly masterful; very rarely has it been rivaled.  Gordon Willis' cinematography is stunning; something about the way the scenes are staged, the camera angles, the lighting, makes the violence seem all the more real, powerful, and unflinching.  The editing is seamless.  It's no small triumph to make a 200-minute epic film that keeps you riveted through the entire motion picture.

In the end, it all comes down to one of the most debated questions in movie history: which is better - THE GODFATHER or THE GODFATHER: PART II?  I cannot decide.  Some days I will sway towards THE GODFATHER, while others I will sway toward PART II.  What is certain is that THE GODFATHER: PART II is the greatest sequel of all time, and without a doubt one of the five greatest films ever made - perhaps even number one.",1155081600,,3172,4.774311926605504

2251251,5,B0007Y08MY,"I had been waiting for a while now to see this movie, but at 200 minutes, I had to find the time. Well, yesterday I found that time and I have finally seen this movie (obviously, as you are reading its review).

This is the continuing saga of the Corleone family that tells the story of a young Vito Corleone growing up in Sicily and in 1910s and 1920's New York; and follows Michael Corleone in the 1950s as he attempts to expand the family business into Las Vegas, Hollywood and Cuba.

The acting, like in the original Godfather is superb. Although he doesn't hardly speak a word of English, Robert De Niro gives a great performance as a young Vito Corleone. He actually feels like the character instead of a younger version of him played by someone else. You can easily believe he grows up to be Brando's character years later. Al Pacino was good in the original movie but steps it up here. Its a shame that he lost the Oscar that year for Best Actor, it just goes to show how flawed the Academy really is; he was absolutely spectacular in this film. Everyone else was good too; Talia Shire (Connie), Diane Keaton (Kay), Robert Duvall (Tom), John Cazale (Fredo), Lee Strasberg (Roth) and Michael V. Gazzo (Pentangeli) give great performances.

As with the original, the music is phenominal here. The iconic yet somewhat haunting ""Godfather Waltz"" (the main theme) is used to full effect here. All the other music complements each scene greatly, never overbearing or overshadowing the scene. Big props to Rota and (Carmine) Coppola.

Now, last night I said that this movie was self-indulgent (nobody on here will understand the ""last night"" part except one member who knows who he is). I used the wrong word there. What I mean is that it is just plain indulgent. The first film had a noir-gangster cinematography to it. It is gone here. Sure, the lighting is still low but the emphasis on coats, hats and stark shadows are replaced with a more lush, less menacing feel. Coppola indulges in his passion for including theatre and performances within his film with over long opera sequences, back ground plays, dancers etc. Coppola tries to weave an epic story through story points like side plots in Cuba during a revolution, but its the simple things that grip us; the confrontation between two brothers or the simple slap between husband and wife. I think The Godfather benefited because such a tight reign was kept on Coppola. Once he got a little leeway, his ideas and themes became bloated.

But, there are enough memorable scenes in Part II as well. Probably not nearly as many memorable ones as the original but it has its own (my particular favorite is the ""I knew it was you Fredo"" scene. Classic stuff right there!). The movie is never boring either. Even though it changes between two different storylines, neither is ever confusing (more on that in a second) nor intrudes on the other; the transitions feel right, never abrupt. Now I myself found this movie to be quite confusing. I said above that neithe story gets confusing, I meant you don't confuse one with another. But I found both stories to be confusing, probably because I have a hard time keeping families (except the Corleone's) straight in these films. But I still enjoyed it immensely. I figure once I see Part III I will go back some time and watch them all again so I can really pay even more attention to things because I know what is going on.

I myself prefer Part I to Part II, but not by much though. The original has so many classic moments and lines, that is was such an experience the first time watching it, that it can't not be my favorite of the two. This is a great sequel, one that complements the first one extremely well. It may be a better film than the first one, but I prefer the original.",1151539200,,3785,4.583456425406204
2251252,5,B0007Y08MY,"Unlike many reviewers, I did not think that ""Godfather 2"" was superior to the first film, although it most certainly was on a par with it. This film is all about Al Pacino's Michael Corleone and his reign as the head of the Corleone ""family"".Having ascended to the top of the Mafia hierarchy in the stunning murderous finale to ""The Godfather"", the sequel focuses on how Michael consolidates that control and how his criminal power leads him into paranoia, new levels of ruthlessness and the destruction of his own personal relationships. Running in parallel with this storyline ,as if to highlight the similarities between Michael and his late father Vito, is the story of Vito's murderous rise to power in the Italian ghettos of New York 50 years earlier, with Robert De Niro featuring in an Oscar winning role. The films narrative jumps between the two stories and Michael's latter day story itself jumps back and forward to Miami,Havana, Nevada and New York, so there is a lot happening in the film plot and action wise and viewers have to be on their toes to keep up with the chicanery and conspiracy throughout.

30 years on and the movie does look a little dated now, possibly because it(and the other films in the trilogy) inspired a whole series of spin off and copy cat Mafia movies such as Scarface, GoodFellas, Casino, Bronx Tale, Road to Perdition and Once Upon a Time in America (all of which incidentally are good in their own right).Al Pacino and Robert De Niro put in memorable performances in this iconic 70's movie.",1151280000,,1534,4.745318352059925
2251253,5,B0007Y08MY,"I can't even get a handle around Francis Ford Coppola's huge and Oscar-winning masterpiece, THE GODFATHER: PART TWO (1974).  Partly taken from Mario Puzo's novel and partly original (Coppola and Puzo share screenplay credit), this three hour and 20 minute combination gangster epic and Americana saga takes us from 1901 Ellis Island to Lake Tahoe in the late 1950s.  We open with the child Vito Corleone (who will grow up to be the Brando patriarch of the 1972 film) fleeing Sicily after his mother and brother are assassinated.  Vito arrives safely at Ellis Island.

Cut to sun-drenched Lake Tahoe with Vito's adult son Michael (Al Pacino in the performance of his career to date) hosting one of the most lavish and romantic wedding parties in movie history.  But then we cut inside the boathouse, where sinister actions and killings are being planned by Michael and G.D. Spradlin as the oily Nevada governor.  The Corleones want a controlling interest in Vegas and Tahoe gambling.  Note the fabulous Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola music outside in the bright sunshine contrasted by ace cinematographer Gordon Willis' use of dark shadows and low light inside.  (Location filming was done at the beautiful Getty Estate on the deep blue lake.  I heard a terribly sad story that Willis was denied two Oscar nominations for GODFATHER I and II because the old guard inside the cinematography guild thought he was a youthful student who did not know to turn up the lighting!  He finally got nominated for GODFATHER III after people in the Academy realized he was a maestro with light and shadow and color quality.)

Throughout the immense and hugely engrossing 200 minute running time of GODFATHER II, Coppola and  three credited film editors (Barry Malkin, Peter Zinner, and Richard Marks) cut back and forth between the young Vito Corleone  (an Oscar-winning Robert De Niro speaking only Sicilian with subtitles) in 1910's Little Italy; and his son Michael involved in gambling from 1950's Tahoe  to Miami to the Dominican Republic.  Linking the material is the last scene in the distant past, as Michael kills the mafioso who murdered his father's mother in the opening scene.  I really wish there could be a GODFATHER IV to show how the young Michael leaving Sicily in 1930 became Vito Corleone's adult son in the 1945 Brooklyn of the opening scene of the first movie.  What happened to the Corleone family during the Depression and World War Two?  When you see the first two movies recut chronologically, there is a gaping continuity hole here.

Dean Tavoularis' production design and Theodora Van Runkle's costumes are stupendous, capturing both the 1910's Little Italy and the myriad 1950's locales.  Tavoularis re-decorated existing streets in lower Manhattan to look like the 1910-1930 era, then took on the challenge of Miami and Cuba in the 1950's, including a lavish hotel party with fabulous music by, I think, Carmine Coppola; Carmine did the incidental music, while Nino Rota did the incomparable background score.  And cinematographer Gordon Willis, one of the world's great lighting cameramen, sets up stunning visual contrasts between sepia and gas-lit Little Italy, and sun-drenched Tahoe and Cuba.  I do not have enough praise for everyone who made this movie, on both sides of the camera.  It is certainly helpful to have Francis Coppola's audio commentary identifying all of the background character actors and noting how smoothly the mammoth 104 day shoot all over the world went, in contrast to the disastrous first film behind the scenes.

Diane Keaton and Robert Duvall do not get enough credit in this review.  They add a lot of flavoring, Keaton as Michael's second wife until a brutal flare-up 2/3 of the way through; and Duvall as the family lawyer.  Watch GODFATHER: PART THREE (1990), where Duvall's absence is sorely missed (contract negotiation matters) and Keaton is back on good terms with Michael.  Pacino's Michael in Part Two rots before our eyes, especially if you watch the two lengthy films on DVD on two consecutive evenings.  At the end of Part One, Michael has his sister's (Talia Shire) husband murdered.  In Part Two, Shire is heavily rouged with furs and endless cigarettes.  And Michael has brother Fredo (the neglected and excellent John Cazale, who died much too young in real life) killed in a boat on an Autumn Lake Tahoe.

It's a titanic film, maybe one of my five favorites in the American cinema, and Coppola's masterpiece among masterpieces.  I haven't even mentioned Michael V. Gazzo, playwright turned actor as a nervous Mafia hood named Frankie  Plantagalee; and legendary acting coach Lee Strasberg as a fictional version of Meyer Lansky, who wants to live in retirement in Miami with his wife.  Both Gazzo and Strasberg got Supporting Actor Oscar nominations, playing vivid characters who will not survive to the ending credits.

This enthralling, and admittedly very violent in spots (especially the final reel) gangster film/Americana epic ends where it really began--at the Getty Estate on Lake Tahoe.  It is Autumn with an empty lake and lots of leaves on the ground.  Michael has had everyone else killed one by one and is all alone in a chair, pensive, ponderng his whole life.  The first movie was made only two years earlier, in 1972, but Michael seems a good thirty years older here.  Cue Nino Rota's incomparable music score after maybe a full minute of silence, then a longer than usual black fadeout, then roll the end credits.  Man, I adore this movie!  Please, please, do not stay away from it because of the violence--and for heaven's sake take two nights if you need two nights for the 200 minute length.  THE GODFATHER: PART  TWO is one for the ages, a motion picture that everyone connected with can be extraordinarily proud of, now and forever.  Bravo, Maestro Coppola!",1150761600,3,5844,4.980412371134021
2251254,5,B0007Y08MY,"and absolute power corrupts absolutely,"" so said Lord Acton in 1887.  Godfather II is seemingly built on this statement.  In The Godfather, Michael Corleone has, at least early on, no interest in ""the family business.""  By the end of The Godfather, Part II, he rules that business ruthlessly, heartlessly and effectively.  So far gone is his conscious that he orders the murder of his own brother.

Godfather II is arguably the best movie ever made, even better than its predecessor.  It helps to have seen The Godfather first, but Godfather II is so powerful that it stands on its own.  It's not hard to follow.

Surprisingly, there are lots of people that have not seen either of the first two Godfather films (and thankfully for them the third.)  If you have not watched these movies, particularly Godfather II, you have not seen Pacino at his peak.  DeNiro is brilliant in this one as well, maybe as fine an acting job as he's ever done.

If you have not seen this movie, you've missed out on a true classic.  It is also worth owning.  I love having it at home, watching it once or so a year.  Buy this film or at least rent it.  Tonight!",1148774400,,1142,4.5024390243902435
2251255,5,B0007Y08MY,"The praises of this film have been said by others so I

will just raise a couple of points:

(1) It is well known that the character of the singer/actor

Johnny Fontaine from the first movie is a thinly veiled

representation of Frank Sinatra who supposedly got a part

in a movie the same way Fontaine did, with the help of an

""offer the producer couldn't refuse"", thanks to the Don.

In this second film, we see Michael facing a Senate Committee

that is investigating organized crime.  This is parallel to

the famous ""Kefauver Committee"".  The counsel for the real

committee was the young Robert F Kennedy. In fact, the dialogue

making up the cross-examination of the witnesses in the film

often comes straight out of the real-life committee.  We

see this panel fearlessly probing these hardened killers and

we develop an admiration especially for the young counsel

who wants to eradicate evil.  Bobby Kennedy, by the time his

life was tragically cut short, had fashioned an image of a fearless fighter for justice and opponent of war and racism.

Very nice.  However, later in the film, we see Michael and Fredo

having a difficult conversation about their relationship, but Fredo also says that the young investigator for the commmittee

is ""not fighting crime"", but actually in the pocket of Hyman Roth, the major crime figure who was carrying out a war against the Corleone crime family.  Thus the investigation was NOT designed to ""root out evil"" from American society, but was simply another weapon in the hands of a Mafia rival of Michael.

Are those who made this film making allegations against Bobby Kennedy himself?  It is well-known that Bobby's father Joe had many connections with the Mafia, especially from the days of Prohibition.  The Kennedy children (including one, John, who eventually became President of the United States) were always told never to ask where their old man got his millions.  Later, when Bobby Kennedy became Attorney-General, he was put in charge of the secret ""Operation Mongoose"" which was to  carry out the assassination of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, and in this role, Bobby Kennedy made contacts with the same Mafia figures he had been grilling as counsel for the Committee a short time before.

All I can say is, draw your own conclusions.

(2)  The flashbacks to the early days of how Vito Corleone got his start as a Mafia Don is very interesting, but still left me unsatisfied.  Somewhat to my surprise, we do not see him start as a ""soldier"" as a teenager, and then working his way up to the top of the garbage heap, but rather, he is portrayed as an honest working man who falls victim to another criminal, Don Fanucci who victimizes the entire Italian community in his part of New York, demanding protection money.  It is Clemenza who introduces him to petty crime, but somehow, suddenly, he is able to commit murder in order to get back at Don Fanucci. This suddenly puts him on top with his friends Tessio and Clemenza, and shortly afterwards he is a major crime figure in his own right.  We are not shown how he suddenly became so powerful.

(3)  I loved the scene at the birthday party for Hyman Roth in

Havana where they are cutting up a birthday cake which has

the map of Cuba on it.  Very symbolic.

(4)  This film also gives a good description of what eats away

at the souls of dictators like Josef Stalin and Saddam Hussein, who also, in their crazed drive for more and more power, ended up also turning on their own families, just as Michael did (""do you sometimes have to destroy the family in order to save the family""?)",1147046400,,3599,4.680511182108626
2251256,5,B0007Y08MY,"Now I do not agree that this film is as good or, as some critics have said, better that the original, but this is probably the greatest sequel ever filmed because it doesn't lose anything.  By that I mean that the film doesn't lose momentum, it doesn't lose interest, it doesn't lose it's brilliance...but I mean, it's just not the original.  Anyways, this is still a staple film and a deserved chapter in the Godfather triligy.  What's great about this film is that it gives you two stories together, young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) as he rises to power in the early 1900's, and it contrasts the life of his youngest son Michael Corleone (Al Pucino) in 1958 as he endevors to move the business throughout Cuba.  What's brilliant about this film is that it's not for once confusing or boring but holds your interest throughout and explains itself very well.  The acting on the part of the entire cast is extraordinary, but most notable are De Niro and Pucino who bring every ounce of passion and flare we'd expect after seeing the original.  Diane Keaton and Robert Duvall are equally impressive, and it's nice to see Kay's charactor explained much better here.  As trouble seeps it's way into Michael's life we see his fight to survive and his will to suceed and how that traumatizes his relationships with family and friends.  This is a breathtaking film that should be watched, and enjoyed by everyone.",1146268800,,1410,4.703252032520325
2251257,5,B0007Y08MY,"There was a Godfather marathon on this weekend on the AMC network.  I figured I would just watch a few minutes but then I couldn't turn it off.

That's because these movies are true works of art.

Part 2 is pretty involved.  I had to watch it several times before I really understood what was going on.

First somebody tries to assassinate Michael in his bedroom.  He knows it's an inside job because somehow the curtains were left open.

To find out who the traitor is Michael tells his enemy Roth that he's going to wack this guy who (Michael tells Roth) Michael suspects is the traitor.

But Michael really thinks Roth was behind it and he wants to make Roth trust him so he asks Roth's permission to do the hit.  They agree to cancel the hit and tell the intended 'victim' to have a meeting with these other brothers so nothing interferes with some other plans in Cuba.

But Roth turns this against Michael.  He sets up a phony botched hit on the guy and before they give him the 'Luca Brazzi' treatment they say: ""Michael Corleone says hello."".

Then they leave the guy alive thinking that Michael wanted to wack him.

So he testifies against Michael.

So Roth actually used the criminal justice system to try to get rid of Michael (but he gets the Jack Ruby treatment later at the airport).

I had to watch it about 5 times to figure this out.

Then the other big conspiracy is who is the inside guy directly within the Corleone family who opened the curtains.

Watch it and find out !

2251259,5,B0007Y08MY,"As great as the original Godfather is, part two is even better. Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro both give the greatest performances of their careers, as Michael and Vito Coreleone, respectively.

In essence, the film is really two separate movies interwoven into one. Michael Coreleone's saga continues where Part I left off; we find him living in Las Vegas taking care of his new-found business. After setting a crooked Senator and some disloyal ""friends"" straight, Coreleone and company are off on a business adventure in Cuba on the eve of Castro's revolution. However, Michael is in for some surprises...

The better part of this movie, however, are the scenes that portray Vito Andolini (later changed to Vito Corleone) and his early life in Sicily and subsequent migration to New York City at the dawn of the 20th century. Through Corleone, viewers are given insight into the plight and struggles of immigrants in Prohibition-era America. Filmed in Italian and featuring top-notch acting and cinematography, these scenes are among the very finest in motion picture history.

Sequels seldom live up to the original, but this is a clear-cut exception to the rule. This is one of the greatest films of all-time.",1142726400,7,1210,5.0703517587939695
2251260,5,B0007Y08MY,"This movie was without a doubt one of the best movies ever made. I missed not having the ""Godfather"" (Marlon Brando) in this second movie, but Al Pacino is such a great actor and has a lot of screen prescence so this made up for it. (And might I add, I never realized how sexy Al Pacino was. Just one look and it's like he's undressing you with his eyes. He's very yummy looking in this particular film as well as in Scarface.) Without seeing Part II, Your Godfather experience will not be complete. I give this movie five stars.",1140825600,,529,4.3
2251261,5,B0007Y08MY,"Director Francis Ford Coppola continues his Shakespearean prose opera of the Will to Power in 1974's THE GODFATHER, PART II. Universally considered one of the greatest films ever crafted along with its twin, the original THE GODFATHER (1972), THE GODFATHER, PART II continues the tragic tale of kingship and kinship begun in the earlier film.

Coppola creates a fascinating film study of Father and Son, as he compares and contrasts the middle-aged Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) and the young Vito Corleone (Robert DeNiro) as the former falls from authority into corruption and decline and the latter rises from obscurity to strength and power.

In two brilliantly crafted parallel period tales spanning the twentieth century, we watch the Father create a self-contained universe centered around Family, while the Son slowly destroys what his Father hath wrought.

DeNiro's Vito Corleone begins life as a frightened immigrant child fleeing a vendetta in Sicily; at his apotheosis, in an act of filial piety he kills Don Ciccio, the man responsible for his own father's, mother's and brother's deaths. Pacino's Michael Corleone begins the film at the height of his powers, then falls deeper and deeper into his own internal darkness. At his nadir, in an act of complete abnegation, he kills his own misguided brother, Fredo (John Cazale).

The difference between them is manifest in that while Don Vito kills only two men (the aforementioned Don Ciccio, and Don Fanucci, a neighborhood predator who takes away Vito's job as a grocery clerk, leaving him unable to feed his Family and driving him into a life of crime), Don Michael is drenched in the blood of other men. Where Don Vito uses his own inherent self-respect and the finespun fear others' feel to serve the essentially unselfish ends of protecting the defenseless in his world, Michael uses the brute force of his personality and unrestrained violence to maintain his own personal wealth and power, ultimately squandering both, and in the end, sacrificing both respect and Family.

The organized crime elements of this film are a dramatic backdrop to the biographical elements. They propel the story but are not the core of it.

Robert DeNiro's Oscar-winning performance as Don Vito Corleone marked the only time that two actors won Academy Awards for the same role (along with Marlon Brando as Don Vito in THE GODFATHER). Pacino's parallel performance as Don Michael is a bleak study in genius, well-deserving its own Oscar.

A gifted film, THE GODFATHER, PART II remains one of the few sequels to match or outmatch it's predecessor film.",1140825600,31,2597,5.096470588235294

2251263,5,B0007Y08MY,"One way to tell that a movie has become a classic story is to give it the repeat viewing test, and even though I have seen them many, many times, the quality of the first two Godfather movies has never been outdated nor degraded. Francis Ford Coppola created two of the best movies in the history of film with The Godfather Parts I & II, and Al Pacino gives a historic and timeless performance in both movies. Everyone knows that sequels are usually flops, and unfortunately The Godfather Part III would probably fall into that category, but out of respect for The Godfather Part II maybe we can forgive the limitations of the third. The first two Godfather movies are cinema classics, they stand up to the test of time and pass the test with flying colors.",1132704000,,757,4.532846715328467
2251264,3,B0007Y08MY,"In the beginning of Godfather II, we see Vito Andolini's mother begging for mercy for the life of her child.  She claims that Vito is slow and dumb witted and could not hurt anyone.  Instead of showing mercy to the child the local mafia chieftain orders the death of young Vito.  Vito escapes and flees to America, but the elements of mercy and forgiveness serve as appropriate book ends to this second part of the trilogy.  This movie is really a character study of two men in their 30's living in two dinstinctly different periods of time.  Both men are really products of their own era, but bound together by their criminal enterprise.  In the first sustained opening scene, we see why Vito had to flee Sicily and come to America.  His entry into the world of crime is, at first, just merely an interplay between necessity, peer pressure and sheer luck.  As Vito begins his rise to the top of Little Italy's criminal hierarchy, he runs his business in a sort of gentle and patriarchal way.  One of the faults of this movie is that Coppola does not include a scene detailing how Vito runs the enterprise out of the Genco Olive Oil Company.  Instead, we get a perfunctory scene dealing with a widow that is kicked out of her tenement, and Vito's ultimate success in getting her back in.  Coppola seems to want the viewer to believe that the America in the early 20th century was more kindler and gentler nation that even has a powerful gangster as having more admirable traits then negative ones.  For viewers that have seen the extended edition DVD we get to see Vito taking out revenge on the remaining members of the group that killed his mother.  These scenes go a long way in establishing that yes, Vito could be just as ruthless as Michael.  In the last flashback scene we see young Michael at his fathers side.  One of the last scenes in the flashback sequences shows Vito waving the hand of Michael as they leave the train station in Sicily.  When we see Michael 30 years later, he is still guided by the hand of his father.  Michael does not run it the same way as his father although.  Michael runs a vast network of casinos, stock holdings and international investments.  The old New York family is more of hindrance to Michael as he attempts to control his organization with minimal interference.  It is clear that Michael does not possess the charm that the old man did, and a reasonable viewer may believe that if Michael was a little more friendly he could have avoided his fate.

Michael is haunted throughout the movie by two ghosts.  The first ghost is his father's hand guiding him to continue on in administering the family business.  The second ghost is the life that he could have lead had things ended up differently.  This second ghost is really represented by his wife Kay who gives up trying to save Michael's soul.  Instead, she takes matters into her own hand and aborts their third child.  Throughout the saga, doors are constantly closed for the women in these films.  Kay's abortion is the only way that women can get back at the men in these movies.  We are left with the notion that Michael believes that he may have been better off had he married a traditional Italian wife that would have accepted her role and not rebelled against his overwhelming authority.  Michael is so confidant in the fact that he is saving his own family, but finally comes to the realization that he may be losing it.  The saddest part is that he has a chance for redemption if he would have forgiven his brother for his botched attempt at betrayal.  By the end of the movie it is clear that Michael has no ability to show mercy nor compassion.  In the same way, Michael is no better then the mafia chieftain back in Sicily who refused to spare the life of Michael's father.  Thus, the film comes full circle at the end with Michael committing the most terrible crime imaginable.  He has damned his soul and pays dearly for these transgressions in the next installment of the series.",1131926400,7,3995,4.549019607843137
2251265,5,B0007Y08MY,"Coppola actually veers into Kubrick territory on this masterful companion piece. Weaving past and present together like a fine tapestry, the film covers so much ground that the 3hours 20 minutes running time seems to fly by. The cinemetography, score and set design are all note perfect, but the main reason to see ""Part II"" is the remarkable Robert DeNiro. Whenever his youthful Vito appears, the screen ignites and you simply cannot take your eyes off of him. Pacino's performance has been the most lauded but I personally found him to be a bit of a bore. Brooding and being a model of restraint and silent fury is one thing, being dull and nearly expressionless is another. The first ""Godfather"" is still the best (Brando owned that film) but this sprawling followup stands on its own as a terrific, engrossing saga about family, loyalty, power and corruption. This is 3 hours well spent. A Classic.",1129939200,2,902,4.825806451612904
2251266,5,B0007Y08MY,"""The Godfather"" was a terrific book by Mario Puzo and, when its' readers were told that a movie was to be made on the book, we couldn't wait.  ""The Godfather"" the movie was every bit what we hoped for but we also had to rationalize that the movie couldn't show all of what was in the book.  Yet it didn't occur to many of us that a sequel would be made.  Once it was announced that there'd be one, the initial reaction was that nothing could top the original so why bother.  However, ""The Godfather II"" showed the industry that excellence can be duplicated.

The first time I watched ""The Godfather II"", I was immediately impressed but I initially felt that the switching back and forth in time was somewhat disruptive.  I've reflected on that from time to time and I believe that this concept enhances the story.  We are give a modern (somewhat) perspective of the Mafia while getting a comparison to the new world their ancestors came to.  We are shown how the earlier immigrants carried their codes and traditions into America and we can compare how the same code and rules have been adapted to a modern society.  It is the same ruthlessness but with modernized methods and organization.

""The Godfather II"" has a number of outstanding performances but the focus is clearly on Michael Corleone who is again played with excellence by Al Pacino.  Robert DeNiro was a new name to me and I was also impressed with his role as a young Vito Corleone.  At times there seemed to be too much glitz and glamour but it was always interesting to note how it never affected the focus of Michael Corleone; this man was all business.  The movie ends with Michael's focus still unabated.  To anyone else, it might seem that things had fallen apart but to Michael, he appeared like a man putting things into perspective and plaaning his next move.

""The Godfather II"" is not quite the equal of its' predecessor but, then, how many movies have been made that are the equal of ""The Godfather""?  However, it is a truly great movie that should command the interest of just about any serious film buff.",1126396800,9,2083,4.559139784946237

My favorite parts of Part 2 are the parts featuring Robert DeNiro as the young Vito Andolini Corleone.  I just eat up anything about Vito Corleone.  He was a great character.

My problem with Part 2 is the disintegration of Michael Corleone.  It's no fun to watch.  What is it - medicine?  Cod liver oil?  It's not enjoyable to watch a guy you like turn into a damn monster.  And he makes a boring monster because he plays it all with a poker face.

The scene where Diane Keaton discussed abortion with Michael should have been paced much differently.  ""Kay"" was clearly irrational in the scene, and in her life at the time, but Diane Keaton didn't play her that way.  The lines were delivered too slowly, and without enough emotion.  To deliver the lines that the script had her deliver to her husband, it should have been played to show borderline insanity, a person way over the edge, with no self control, just whacko.  That's definitely the way that scene should have been played.  She should have played it like a hyper loony tune.  It was much too bland, much too rational, for the words in the script.  She should have thrown a friggin fit.  She should have had the audience going ""Oh my God, she's out of her mind!""  That's the way emotional scenes play out in real life.  They don't play out like a poker game.

It's commonly accepted that the first two parts of The Godfather are the cream of the crop, and that the third part is an embarrassment.  Not in my opinion.  Only the original was a true masterpiece, and the two sequels were fairly equal to each other, with the exception of the DeNiro scenes, which were up there with the first movie.",1124064000,3,1754,4.481012658227848

You watch him strip away all human connections in order to protect the ""family."" He finally asks his mother ""Can you lose your family?"" She doesn't understand the question, but of course Michael has lost his family, as well as his own soul. The paradox in this--killing your family in order to protect the ""family""--is wonderful. As in Part I, Diane Keaton is kind of a weak link--just not a credible Mafia wife. De Niro gives one of the greatest performances ever--channeling Brando. I also love the young versions of Don Corleone's sidekicks when they first go into business doing things like stealing rugs. And Robert Duvall has had to work very hard ever since to equal this performance.

The acting is classy, silent, not overdone. Robert DeNiro won an oscar for his portrayal of young Vito Corleone. Francis Ford Coppola won Best Director for the movie. There were several rivetting scenes in the movie. But for me, the best one was the one in which Vito Corleone kills Don Fanucci. There are several simliarities with this movie and the original (Godfather Part I). For instance, in both movies, one of the parents dies, and after that, a treacherous family member is killed. All the other gang leaders too are executed at the same time. Yet, both have been done very differently. The movie is educational in it's own way, and is definitely a must see.

Would Kay and Michael really throw that overblown day long party with every Corleone acquaintance, including the senator from Nevada, to celebrate their son's first communion?  How could would-be assassins get outside Kay and Michael's bedroom window on that fortress-like compound?  I don't believe that Kay Corleone would have a healthy baby son aborted to stop ""This Sicilian Thing.""  Would Fredo really have instigated a hit on his brother that could well have killed Kay also?  I realize these are fictional characters, but their personalities are clearly drawn and understood by the end of G Part I.  So Coppola I think stretched credulity a bit in G Part II.
I also think Michael's dealings with Hyman Roth are a little difficult to understand as presented.  This was potentially a very fascinating relationship that could have been developed more fully. (""Michael, we're bigger than US Steel."")  I could go on with even little things (for instance the way Mama Corleone is dressed while in her casket), but I'll just assume that the director didn't consider these particularly important.
Still, as a sequel (and a prequel) to G Part I, this is a very fine film.  It is not a masterpiece as G Part I is, but it is exponentially better than the ill-conceived G Part III.  The cinematography is beautiful, and the musical score is, once again, superb.",1525392000,,1719,4.747474747474747
