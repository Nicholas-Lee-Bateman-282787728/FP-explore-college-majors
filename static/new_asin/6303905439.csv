723013,4,6303905439,"A sentimental comedy with an inevitable happy ending but still good fun. Carol Dempster does a convincing job as a free spirited circus girl, Sally, brought up by McGargle (Fields, of course)after the death of her parents.  The silent Fields shows his physical comedy skills, which are often  forgotten due the later strength of his spoken comedy. The quality of the  picture is excellent - again showing for me that B & W movies gain most  from DVD if the manufacturers make an effort.  A good movie for anyone to  watch, it is a must for the Fields fans to see the earlier stages of the  character that was to become so familiar in the later films.",950313600,21,650,4.504273504273504
723014,5,6303905439,"Quality of the DVD;  The picture quality was great, and was taken from an obviously well restored print.  Sound was excellent as well, (although  this is a silent movie).  I have seen very good silent movies with terrible  sound tracks of ill fitting music, but with this movie they used the  original sheet music that was made for it, with delightful results.  This  is a silent movie, but if you are a Fields fan, you will not want to miss  this one.  The movie captures the essence of all of Fields' future movies,  utilizing the formula of where he is the down trodden father with the  loving and devoted daughter and they see it through with each other's help  and find the golden lining of the grey clouds.  You even get a peek at some  of Fields' juggling. Best viewing wishes, Dave",941155200,20,789,4.457746478873239

723067,4,6303905439,"Even without his iconic voice, W.C.Fields' characteristic gestures are there, and his physical comedy really shines.  The story is as warm as the beautiful sepia tones of the film print; such details as buying a cigar for her pop rather than a candy bar ring true.  Through the entire film Ms. Dempster shows a wide range of very believable emotions.  In 1925 prohibition was simply a fact of daily life, not yet acknowledged as a mistake, and it is instructive to see how the definition of vice has changed since then.  The music was well chosen and appropriate.  I very much enjoyed this movie.",1407888000,,596,4.6923076923076925
723068,4,6303905439,"Carol Dempster shines as a circus performer who dearly loves her ""Pop,"" the circus showman--played deftly by W. C. Fields--who single-handedly raises her after her parents' untimely deaths. Fields' ""Pop"" character is a con artist, to be sure, but one whose heart is clearly in the right place. This silent film delivers laughs and loads of warm sentiment, yet it is sweet and engaging from start to finish.",1375228800,,406,4.985294117647059
723069,4,6303905439,"Consider how many times you've seen a film with these qualities: it's silent, non-epic, non-preachy, made by D.W. Griffith; its ""hero""--a single male, care-taking nurturer--is played by W.C. Fields. And to top it off, though maybe a bit sappy, it's actually a sweet film!",1354665600,,271,5.181818181818182
723070,5,6303905439,A wonderful combination of a great director and an actor/comedian not yet at his zenith. Fields shows his inherent warmth that he tried to conceal later on in his career. Grifith develops a story line that holds together in spite of moments that in lesser hands would drag the progress of the story.  Characters are well defined and work together to make a believeable cohesive plot. A most rewarding bit of cinema.,1282003200,,415,4.763888888888889
723071,4,6303905439,"This Kino edition comes with a score by Donald Sosin ! That's reason enough to pre-order, even if you've seen the film, or even if you own it -- even if you think the film itself is a bit incoherent. It's got some good Fields moments in it, and Dempster in a dream of a gown, and some very melodramatic Griffith titles.
The scoring by Sosin alone makes this a must-have.",1224028800,2,370,4.225352112676056
723072,4,6303905439,"I thought it would be a bit hard to really get into this film, since I'm not too familiar with the silent work of W.C. Fields.  Since he really didn't come into his own until the sound era, it's hard to see him deprived of that essential element in his comedy, his voice.  However, this film does seem to be regarded as one of his better silents, and he still manages to be quite entertaining and funny even without being able to use his voice or rely upon other noises.  It's also an interesting change of pace to see him in a fatherly role, given his legendary dislike of children (at least on-camera), even if Sally is a young woman and not exactly a true child for the majority of the film.

Judge and Mrs. Foster have a beloved only child, but when she announces her intentions to marry a circus man, her father throws her out of the house and tells her to never come back.  Several years later, we see her in the circus on her deathbed, her husband having already died.  She entrusts the care of her daughter Sally to Prof. Eustace McGargle, and he takes this trust very seriously.  Sally is raised knowing him as both her father and mother, and grows up a free spirit as the circus moves from town to town.  The two are very devoted to one another, even when they fall on hard luck and get in trouble with the law.  But when the two happen to pass through the town where the Fosters still live, they have more to worry about than the cops being after them for fixing a card game.  Judge Foster hates circus folk and entertainers, and in particular has disliked Sally from the very first time he saw her, so McGargle resolves to not tell either of them the true secret of her birth.  Sally has however made an impression on Mrs. Foster and a wealthy young man, Peyton Lennox, and they don't appreciate the efforts of Judge Foster and Mr. Lennox to run her out of town and put her on trial for her role in a crooked card game.  (It does seem odd that the courtroom would be so filled for such a minor trial, and that Sally should be at risk for being sent to a home for ""wayward girls"" over that, but a little suspension of disbelief is necessary sometimes to really get into a film.)  During Sally's trial, McGargle (who still holds the ultimate trump card, the secret of her birth) is on the run from some crooks, but Sally insists he's going to come through for her as usual.

Overall, it's a fun cute film, even if some of the scenes are a bit repetitive, implausible, and overly melodramatic.  It's a bit long for a comedy, so some of the less-essential scenes could have been cut out without the whole product suffering.  And I already don't believe in love at first sight, so I found the ""romance"" between Sally and Peyton rather unbelievable, even moreso than most ""love at first sight"" stories.  I didn't see any real mutual attraction between them, more like some playboy lusting after this new girl and pretty much forcing his affections and attentions on her until she gives in.  Much more believable is the father-daughter relationship between Sally and McGargle.  Carol Dempster was rather lacking in her acting skills, but she does an adequate job with the material.  It's not like she has a demanding role here that would have required more finesse and skill.",1202428800,5,3280,4.435
723073,4,6303905439,"Next to ""Battle of the Sexes"" this charming silent film surely rates as a superb example of legendary director D.W. Griffith's versatility and skill.  While probably best remembered for his serious historic and moral epics of earlier years, Griffith kept up with the times and directed a variety of other films in the mid to late 1920s, of which ""Sally of the Sawdust"" stands out as one of the best.  With outstanding stars such as W.C. Fields perfectly cast in the colourful character of Professor McGargle, and Carol Dempster as Sally, who replaced Griffith's earlier `stock' actresses such as Mary Pickford, Lillian Gish and Mae Marsh, this film shines and is entertaining and enjoyable every single minute.  Carol Dempster, who only appeared in over a dozen films and mostly under Griffith's direction, plays the part of Sally wonderfully and brings the character and whole story to life as she leaps spritely from scene to scene as the circus orphan who is devoted to her guardian and her `Pop', Professor McGargle.  But unknown to her, she has living grandparents who are also unaware of her existence, which makes for considerable emotional suspense and also sentimentality as the plot unwinds.  This busy story was in fact a popular stage play called ""Poppy"" in which W.C. Fields played the same role of Professor McGargle, and whose screen appearance in this film led to further future successful screen roles.  Griffith often demonstrated his skill in building suspense and action in his films, and ""Sally of the Sawdust"" is no exception as Sally waits for her Pop to evade a gang of thieves and finally arrive in court to tell the stern judge - who is in fact Sally's grandfather - who her mother was so that she wouldn't be sent to a home for wayward girls.  There are delightful moments of comedy as well as action and drama, all without the intensity and heaviness often characteristic of Griffith's earlier dramatic sagas.  Together with very good and clear picture quality and a perfectly suited piano score based on original cue sheets, this Kino Video production is high quality all-round, and shows Griffith and his stars at their best.",1177286400,7,2155,4.917355371900826
723074,5,6303905439,"The 1936 version, entitled 'Poppy', as was the original play, is  a must see, hilarious film! Got to agree with the other reviewer, it contains some classic Fields scenes... how about the croquet  game, or the get-away on the mayor's horse... or the scene where  Poppy announces that she is indeed the heiress... to which Fields replies, ""Well my dear, I'm glad to see you've finally come around""!.. or the toothless guy who spends the entire movies chasing the $5 Fields has bilked him out of in the first 5 minutes!
Please, please, please WHOEVER put the 1936 Poppy on a DVD!",993340800,7,577,4.637254901960785
7854447,3,6303905439,"I think it's fair to say that by this point in his career D. W. Griffith's powers were diminishing. Other film makers had not only caught up with him, they had superceded him and were beginning to produce more complex and less sentimental narratives.

Sally of the Sawdust is made in much the same vain as Way Down East, Broken Blossoms and other melodramatic ""social message"" pictures that Griffith had a knack for. Unfortunately he no longer had the same level of talent around him, as well as the social change of the roaring twenties, this effort ends up coming across as rather primitive. A simple story, with a simple narrative and simple editing, it all ends up coming across as a rather tired effort.

That said it has some good moments in it and W. C. Fields shows some early talent and comedic prowess that would see his popularity rise tremendously during the 30s. He would go onto reprise this role in the better known 'Poppy'. Carol Dempster as the young orphaned performer is okay in the role, but noticeably lacks the ability that Griffith's previous leading ladies had in abundance. The story is rather run of the mill and there aren't enough twists to keep you too interested, indeed the ending rather drags out with an overblown court sequence. There is nothing opulent or significant throughout that sets it apart, such as the ice-floe sequence in Way Down East or Lillian Gish's impending doom in the closet of Broken Blossoms'.

If you're interested enough in Griffiths then it is worth watching to see how he devolved during the 20s, but overall there's nothing that sets apart from certainly the more profound films coming out during the same period. The DVD itself has a really good print quality of the actual movie, which is refreshing, as most UK silent movie DVDs contain very grainy old transfers that stem from the films television airings over the years.",1502755200,,1885,4.758409785932722
7854448,5,6303905439,"Sally of the Sawdust runs a little long, as do many D. W. Griffith films, but overall, it is a delight. Peppered throughout the film are examples of the ""bits"" that W. C. Fields is famous for. I am a big W. C. Fields fan and watched Sally of the Sawdust to see more of him, but this one had a surprise for me in the form of Carol Dempster. As Sally, she became for me the funniest woman in silent film. With the naivet of Gilda Radner, the zaniness of many of the 20th century's great comedy women, and energy all her own, Dempster takes the show. At first, with just her eyes, and then with her entire body, she is lovable and laughable at the same time. I think Carol Dempster is the Buster Keaton of women.",1467072000,,709,4.107913669064748
7854449,5,6303905439,Heartwarming storyline. Classic silent entertainment.,1463961600,,53,9.8
7854450,3,6303905439,"""Sally of the Sawdust"" is a silent with a maudlin but often comic story line whose ""side attractions"" make it more likely some of us would want to see it.

""Sally"" is the daughter of a mother who was banished from her once-patrician home because she married a circus feller. The mother dies soon after Sally is born buy the dying mother only worries that Sally should be taken care of. The father has earlier vanished from the scene in an unspecified manner and it falls to Prof McGargle (W.C. Fields), a good-hearted side-show performer and petty swindler, to write to her grandparents to let them know what happened to their daughter, but he doesn't mention Sally.

The grandparents don't respond and McGargle brings up Sally (Carol Dempster) as a sort of innocent (in the midst of carny types) coming into almost excruciatingly adorable young womanhood. Many events and misadventures intervene as Sally and McGargle barrel toward the ultimately happy ending.

It's hard to give a star rating to a movie like this. The story line is, as I said, both maudlin and comic and you know it is likely to all resolve to the expected resolution. Yet it is charming despite (or because of) Dempster's cute mugging and posing; W. C. Fields (only his second role, I understand) is delightful; a talented and natural comic and performer, very recognizable and entertaining despite the lack of his humorous voice. He's surprisingly skinny and light-footed and pulls off the doting ""adopted father"" well. Carol Dempster is interesting not only for her performance but for her reputed favor with Producer D.W. Griffith (he may have sleeping with her, so produced an atypical comedy for show her off); I have heard that other performers hated her because they said she had no acting style of own, but copied the styles of other actresses. And her being the producer's pet would not bring admiration.

The other ""extra"" that makes this interesting is that it is supposedly set in Connecticut but it was filmed on Long Island. Before I learned this I kept thinking that the extensive outdoor scenes, buildings and locales looked like Long Island. There is even a dirt crossroads with one of the signs pointing to Hicksville, a familiar Long Island town. So the movie is also a time capsule that I thoroughly enjoyed, notwithstanding my three-star review.",1462492800,,2337,4.893939393939394
7854451,4,6303905439,"This is an enjoyable film, similar to ""Poppy"" which was made a decade later. Although it's silent, you can still imagine hearing Field's wonderful nasal voice as he pulls his usual scams. The film shows a bit of his juggling prowess; I wished there was more of it. Carol Dempster is very good as Sally. I think some scenes showing Sally's angst go on too long. Maybe that's because I'm looking at the film 90 years after it was filmed and more prolonged melodrama was normal in 1920's silent era films. All in all, it's definitely worth a look if you like W.C. Fields.",1455580800,,568,4.471153846153846
7854452,4,6303905439,"Interesting to see the great W.C. Fields working with director D.W. Griffith. The director was not known for his comedy work and Fields would need sound for his comedy to be fully realized, but the film still holds interest and gives us a glimpse of  a great artist on his way up and a great artist on his way down. Nice print.",1452297600,,327,4.274193548387097
7854453,2,6303905439,"The movie serves the story, and you get to see some of Fields' brilliance as a juggler, but he didn't really shine in movies until they began to talk. This story was reshot as ""Poppy"" a few years later. It's a better show.",1444176000,,222,4.186046511627907

7854455,3,6303905439,"Not up to its reputation(?). Shows Griffith's weaknesses. Strangely a lot of non-matching cuts within montage. Film does not show off Fields' skills with juggling. Acting is good, but it demonstrates how Griffith fell behind during the Twenties. Afterall, some of the greatest late silent films were made by then, and some forever greats come soon after.",1431388800,,354,5.228070175438597
