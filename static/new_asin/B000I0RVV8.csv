2650596,5,B000I0RVV8,This is a poignant movie. The only actor I recognized is Anupam Kher but they were all very good. Watched it in one sitting because it held my interest.,1388275200,,152,4.275862068965517
2650597,5,B000I0RVV8,This is a classic from Mahesh Bhatt and is highly recommended for all serious cinemagoers.  Should be in your collection.,1357430400,,121,5.05
2650598,5,B000I0RVV8,"A story based on some very common elements of society, focusing on characters, you cannot ignore, infact you will definately relate to them. 'Saaransh' tells us the story of an old couple who have lost their only child, but thats not all, the story keeps racing on to a much flamboyant side and quite easily engages our mind and soul to the film completely. So, what is so attractive about this film? no there is no superhit songs, no amazing dance sequences or over-hyped melodrama, in one sentence, the film is a simple genuine potrayal of the complexities in life and for you
to decide that how life should be lived further even when all hopes die and when all expectations drown. Anupam Kher plays 'B.V. Pradhan' a character perhaps enlisted successfully in the book of history of cinema, a character you may know, I may know. A true cinematic masterpiece, that will make you think and realize.",1312848000,,898,4.689873417721519
2650599,5,B000I0RVV8,"The late 70's and 80's were a golden era of Indian cinema; this movie is one of the gems from those times. This movie was not a typical 'art movie' . Some of the art movies were needlessly too boring. Saaransh is movie about rebirth, purpose of life, and the apathetic Indian society. My favorite scene was when Anupam Kher bursts out in front of the custom officer.",1272844800,3,366,4.397058823529412
2650600,4,B000I0RVV8,"Anupam Kher plays Mr Pradhan a retired teacher who lives in Bombay with his wife played by Rohini Hattangadi. During a botched mugging their son is murdered in NYC. So fend off their loneliness and to alleviate their financial burden the Pradhans keep a paying guest, played by Sonii Razdan who is in a relationship with Madan Jain who is also the son of a politician Nilu Phule. Nilu The story is quite interesting and the movie is summed up in its entirety in the final minutes of the film when Anupam tells his wife that the entire gist of his life lies in the wrinkles on her forehead. The movie is sans special effects, unnecessary melodrama and dance numbers. Anupam Kher plays an old man for the first time in his debut movie and he delivers an award winning performance. All actors in the movie are utilized ably. Certain scenes linger in your mind such as Anupam Kher's outburst at the customs officer, his interaction with the childhood friend of his son outside a library, and finally his realization that he has not failed as a teacher when he meets a politician who once was a student. Bombay never looked so gorgeous and peaceful, this movie was shot in 1984 and Bombay was crowded even then but the lanes and the by lanes look so peaceful and without a single soul on the street. Watch it for the acting and a nostalgia trip if you are from Bombay now Mumbai. See the credits to see that a lot of people went to bigger things Mahesh Bhatt who directs this movie, Anupam Kher, Suraj Barjatya who was an assistant director and David Dhawan edited this movie.

Rohini Hattangadi acted well too, but her character seems creepy. It was serious movie but got thumbs up by my kids 14 and 21.",1458000000,,304,4.333333333333333
