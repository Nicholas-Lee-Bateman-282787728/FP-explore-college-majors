8499067,5,B006IY1DSK,"Charles Doran's films are bizarre satires of people caught up in cultural hype and find themselves more lost than ever. The people of his films are arch consumers who buy into lifestyles they hardly even understand.
These films are important in that they address a society which hurtles further and further towards a fragmented cultural tribalism with the desperation of fitting in.",1463961600,,382,5.17741935483871
8499068,5,B006IY1DSK,"My heart is in LA.  It always will be.  As a former Westsider, I particularly enjoyed this satire.  Fun.

Ennui, a short black and white film on the disk, was just a good.",1325980800,,171,4.090909090909091
8499069,5,B006IY1DSK,"Bitingly funny satire of the snobbery that West Los Angeles people have about the valley. The movie is nicely paced, with some very colorful photography and music and narrated by a young architect who wants to work exclusively on the Westside. Some unpredictable events transpire. The actors are all impressive, and the narrator is very effective at portraying a somewhat self-centered snob, but with lots of interesting things to say. Director/writer Charles Doran has some priceless, knowing lines about the valley in general, architecture and people of the valley, and living the good life on the westside. Things go along at a snappy pace. Also on the DVD is Ennui, an earlier, black-and-white film by Doran (and nicely photographed by Laura Daroca), about a girl who's moved back to the Hollywood area and has a somewhat edgy attitude about life. The lead actress is noticeably impressive and has a magnetic personality, talking in a monotone voice that's very humorous. All in all, both movies are very effective in their edgy, humorous distinctiveness.",1325894400,,1059,5.162790697674419
