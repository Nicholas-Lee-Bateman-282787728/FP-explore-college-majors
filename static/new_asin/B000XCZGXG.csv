3001225,1,B000XCZGXG,"I thought that season 1 was great and couldn't wait to get season 2.  I was very disappointed with the story line for season 2, it wasn't as good.",1229212800,,146,4.0344827586206895
3001226,5,B000XCZGXG,"this is the best drama on television. a great cast, especially the two jasons who play the two brothers. now that 'the shield' is no more, this is the only crime drama left on tv worth watching. cudos to showtime for presenting this fabulous series.

just a brief vent: i recently discovered that the golden globes had nominated 'weeds,' 'californication,'and 'dexter' for awards.
imo, the best series showtime airs is 'brotherhood'. it's strong on acting, directing, and writing. completely ignored by the morons from the golden globe. btw, they also ignored the best movie of 2008 ""the dark knight."" throwing it only one bone for heath ledger.
don't get me wrong, i like 'dexter', but it doesn't hold a candle to 'brotherhood.'on the other hand, i totally hate 'californication' and if there's a more boring actor on the planet than dave duchovny, i'd like to know who it is. 'weeds' has overstayed it's welcome.
golden globes aren't so 'golden' in my opinion.

ps:  'brotherhood ' is in good company; 'the wire', perhaps the greatest series in tv history, was also ignored by the 'golden globes' and the 'emmies.' is it any wonder why mediocrity rules the entertainment world.",1228176000,4,1179,4.944444444444445

3001230,4,B000XCZGXG,"Showtime's Irish answer to The Sopranos; Brotherhood manages to get better and better with each passing episode, and the second season is no different.  Picking up a while after the first season concluded, season two begins with the Caffee family picking up the pieces.  Michael (Jason Isaacs) is recovering from the brutal beating he took at last season's finale, and coping with the unexpected mental side effects to boot, all the while still trying to stay in the semi-good graces of crime boss Freddie Cork (Kevin Chapman).  His politician brother Tommy (Jason Clarke) continues the campaign trail, and is drawn further and further away from his wife Eileen (Annabeth Gish) after learning of her infidelities.  Things get even more complicated for the Caffee's when their estranged Irish cousin Colin (Brian F. O'Byrne) returns to The Hill to reconnect with the family, much to the chagrin of Michael and Tommy's mother Rose (the excellent Fionnula Flanagan).  Also in this season, we witness the descent of cop Declan (Ethan Embry) whose life continues to spiral out of control.  While there isn't anything on Brotherhood that hasn't been seen before, it still manages to provide plenty of entertainment for fans of gangster crime-dramas and back-office politics.  Not to mention that by the time the season concludes, you'll be salivating for more.  All in all, Brotherhood still manages to get better and better with each passing episode, and here's hoping that the best is yet to come.",1222214400,16,1493,5.11522633744856

3001232,5,B000XCZGXG,"The first season of Showtime's dark, brooding Brotherhood spent time exploring its main characters, often at the expense of plot.  So much of what most people loved about the first season involved the family dynamics, the personal struggle and angst and the fine line between love and hate.  Just seeing the characters in their unique positions in life sufficed for a larger story.

The second season really couldn't repeat that.  Viewers now know these characters and expected more concrete plots to accompany the character studies.  Several long plots appear throughout the season, even though at times, the series feels misguided and directionless.  The primary stories focus on Michael's physical, mental and emotional recovery from his beating at the end of Season, Tommy's tit-for-tat affair and the arrival of the Caffee's cousin Colin, a blue collar Irishman bent on reconnecting with his American family, including the father he never knew.

That last plot comes with a heavy price for most fans of the first season.  To make room for Colin, the writers eliminated Michael's right hand Pete, a viewer favorite.  Colin takes his place alongside Michael, performing his dirty work.  Although a deeper more flexible character, Colin lacks the warmth and humanity of Pete, and the show suffers because of the trade.

Another change from Season 1 is the downward spiral of Declan.  Along with his non-existent relationship with his wife, Declan's drug abuse worsens, and he finds himself in a moral neverland at work, having to betray the trust of his friends to keep his shield.  Declan's duplicity is never better displayed than in the season's best episode, when he bribes voters to help re-elect Tommy, all with the approval of his supervisors who want the Caffee's blood.

Even though Brotherhood takes a step back in its second season, it's still among the best television has to offer.  Sharply written, wonderfully acted and as serious and somber as a funeral, the often graphically violent drama both entertains and challenges viewers with a family so unlike any other family in the world, yet also so similar to us all.",1199750400,28,2133,5.089080459770115

3001382,5,B000XCZGXG,"I like how Tommy is torn b/w the good and bad part of politics but also wants a good marriage and family life - making that happen is difficult for him with a gangster brother, Michael.  Michael has a love for the family too but torn b/w his true family members, a girlfriend that basically couldn't leave him even if she wanted to, and his circle of gangster friends.  Collin adds a great part to the story b/c he is a cousin from Ireland so caught b/w ALL the mix by unfortunately falling in love with gangster Michael's girlfriend yet devoted to Michael as a gangster, and loves his aunt and cousin, Tommy.  So he is woven into the family in an interesting way.  The question is, ""Who will Michael kill next?""  His violent leadership is bound to solve any of a number of issues that are all building into what has to end in tragedy somehow.  I watch each episode twice to make sure I catch everyone's names and the details.  My favorite character?  None - they are all fantastically equal!",1463356800,,992,4.412087912087912

That made for a great series and one you could get into without seeing it as just ""fiction"" with  realistic story lines and multi dimensional  characters versus the robot-like characters  many ""television""  produced series attempt to pass on to the masses. Always packaged neatly. Hot girl FBI agents and young, buffed CSI studs who would and probably would make more money on stage than on pavement.

3001536,5,B000XCZGXG,"I have to admit I may have rushed to judge this series in a season one review I'd submitted a few days ago. As the series continues into season two the storyline is getting more complex and the characters more cohesive and well established. The predictability I felt in season one has been replaced with unusual and clever plot twists. Unlike other recent series I've watched Brotherhood is not inundated with a glut of new characters at every other turn. Instead, the characters are allowed to mature and the viewer is allowed to get more connected with them. Almost every aspect I chided in season one has been much bettered in season two. I am now very much involved in the story and it's players and am anxious to see what is in store for season three! I highly recommend this show for anyone who enjoys great mob-tinged serial dramas.",1439683200,,839,4.6

3001557,2,B000XCZGXG,"It's interesting to watch Italian American Mafia/mob stories to see how they had the audacity to organized crime, take what wasn't their and hurl racist insults against minorities groups they often resembled in feature (guess who). So I wanted to learn how Irish people did the same sans the physical resemblance, and I  decided to give this series a try. Didn't like it. It's a Soprano wannabe series but with Irish people/mob who have a free pass to make racial insults against Black people & other races. Who knew that Rhode Island only had 1 Black official in the entire city? I would think that there would be other races than Irish people in the 21st century in Rhode Island. At least hire actors of different races and culture to walk by/in stores/in political office etc to make this town/storyline believeable! Two stars for giving me insight on how Irish Americans can be as thuggish, corrupt and racist as the Italian American
Mafia was.  The costume department must have saved tons of money on clothes because the actors looked like they rolled out of bed and put on what they wore the previous day or even from home! Michael's a big shot gangster who wears sneakers! Lol! And he wears a leather jacket from the '80s just about everyday when filming was done in the summer! Does a leather coat make you a ganster? Showtime thought so. Where does all the corrupt money go? Certainly not on their homes or for repairs in their home eg. Tommy couldn't run the A/C without it blowing a fuse. Come on! Where does his money go? And where does his wife get money to buy weed or coke if she doesn't work? Tommy is never seen giving her (or the kids) an allowance.

3001676,4,B000XCZGXG,"I'll always want to give Brotherhood 5 stars but the production quality is such crap especially considering they got such great talent to be in this show.  One example is when Tommy gives Eileen the famous ""filth in the hands of other men"" speech outside the school and the scene ends with Eileen almost totally out of focus and the brick building like, 200 feet away in focus.  Little things like that which take away from the show.  A mistake is cool here or there but gosh, it all adds up.  The quality of the video is poor too, they are shooting in video right?  I know you save a fortune NOT shooting film, but a good show deserves it.  I guess they blew the film budget getting all the actors on this that they did.  Who knows.

Another crappy crime show where everyone is a criminal or needs a psychiatric evaluation and keeper. From the adults to the children in puberty everyone has issues with either drugs or moral turpitude. This is another Hollywood BS show designed by the Left and Reds to bring down America and portray our country in a poor light. I say ""stuff it where the sun don't shine"" and avoid this garbage and the many other bad message shows with little truth and all BS. Boycott them and the programmers who are only interested in pushing drugs on you and your kids and the bad behavior (like pornography on the culture). They can only be stopped when they feel it in their pockets and bottom line. Money is their God.

Michael and Eileen keep the faade of a happy family alive.  Colin (Bran F. O'Byrne), the Irish cousin of Michael and Tommy, returns to Providence.  Rose harbors a deep distrust of him.  Colin sets out to find his actual father.  Rose's old, and often recent, flame Judd Fitzgerald (Len Cariou) turns out to be the culprit.  He wanted Rose but had to settle for Rose's sister.

Tommy keeps trying to move up the political latter.  A reelection has him garnering support from his sister Mary Kate (Kerry O'Malley), wife of ne'er-do-well and useless political aid, Jimmy (Bates Wilder) Martinson.

Kevin 'Moe' Reilly (Billy Smith) keeps an ear out for things.  (Inside joke.  You'd have to watch the series to know what was meant.)",1397174400,,930,4.631901840490798

My suspicion is that it was designed as a  more long-running epic series which got cut short because of poor ratings and budget limitations. As a result, we have a series that doesn't offer satisfactory closure in terms of character arcs and plotlines. Still, the two Jason's perform beautifully as gangster and politician brothers, ably supported by Annabeth Gish, Fionnula Flannigan and especially Kevin Chapman as the mob boss you love to hate.

3001756,5,B000XCZGXG,"Having gobbled up the first series on DVD box set from Amazon I was almost like a junkie waiting for my fix of series 2.
The characters are so well drawn in this series that you feel compelled to worry about their wellbeing, even the devious Michael Caffey.
Every character is well drawn even the bit players make the overall piece work sublimely.
Tommy's marriage now on shaky ground and Michael, recovering from the beat down he recieved in series one is trying to reclaim his territory once again from Freddie Cork.
His romance with Kathleen is under immense pressure due to his instability and his predictability has taken a turn for the worse.
Tommys reliance on old friends seems to be looking less reliable and he is learning that life in politics on the Hill can be as dangerous a game as any his brother plays.
Declans character takes on a major role in this season and if you didn't feel for him in series one you sure do by the end of series two.
The subplot of the attempted entrapment of Marty Trio and Freddie Cork heats up and so does the action with both the Caffey brothers fighting for their survival in their chosen arenas.
And like all good Irish families it's all held together by the love of a good mother, Rose, who has her battles to deal with as she comes to terms with her own ageing.
All the women in this series are so well drawn and strong they could almost carry the show on their own.
But like all good series it takes a well defined and acted cast to make you want to watch and I for one cannot wait for seazon 3 to start down here in Australia.",1233964800,3,1577,4.313131313131313

3235723,5,B000XCZGXG,"this is the best drama on television. a great cast, especially the two jasons who play the two brothers. now that 'the shield' is no more, this is the only crime drama left on tv worth watching. cudos to showtime for presenting this fabulous series.

just a brief vent: i recently discovered that the golden globes had nominated 'weeds,' 'californication,'and 'dexter' for awards.
imo, the best series showtime airs is 'brotherhood'. it's strong on acting, directing, and writing. completely ignored by the morons from the golden globe. btw, they also ignored the best movie of 2008 ""the dark knight."" throwing it only one bone for heath ledger.
don't get me wrong, i like 'dexter', but it doesn't hold a candle to 'brotherhood.'on the other hand, i totally hate 'californication' and if there's a more boring actor on the planet than dave duchovny, i'd like to know who it is. 'weeds' has overstayed it's welcome.
golden globes aren't so 'golden' in my opinion.

Picking up a while after the first season concluded, season two begins with the Caffee family picking up the pieces.  Michael (Jason Isaacs) is recovering from the brutal beating he took at last season's finale, and coping with the unexpected mental side effects to boot, all the while still trying to stay in the semi-good graces of crime boss Freddie Cork (Kevin Chapman).  His politician brother Tommy (Jason Clarke) continues the campaign trail, and is drawn further and further away from his wife Eileen (Annabeth Gish) after learning of her infidelities.  Things get even more complicated for the Caffee's when their estranged Irish cousin Colin (Brian F.

3235729,5,B000XCZGXG,"The first season of Showtime's dark, brooding Brotherhood spent time exploring its main characters, often at the expense of plot.  So much of what most people loved about the first season involved the family dynamics, the personal struggle and angst and the fine line between love and hate.  Just seeing the characters in their unique positions in life sufficed for a larger story.

The second season really couldn't repeat that.  Viewers now know these characters and expected more concrete plots to accompany the character studies.  Several long plots appear throughout the season, even though at times, the series feels misguided and directionless.  The primary stories focus on Michael's physical, mental and emotional recovery from his beating at the end of Season, Tommy's tit-for-tat affair and the arrival of the Caffee's cousin Colin, a blue collar Irishman bent on reconnecting with his American family, including the father he never knew.

That last plot comes with a heavy price for most fans of the first season.  To make room for Colin, the writers eliminated Michael's right hand Pete, a viewer favorite.  Colin takes his place alongside Michael, performing his dirty work.  Although a deeper more flexible character, Colin lacks the warmth and humanity of Pete, and the show suffers because of the trade.

Another change from Season 1 is the downward spiral of Declan.  Along with his non-existent relationship with his wife, Declan's drug abuse worsens, and he finds himself in a moral neverland at work, having to betray the trust of his friends to keep his shield.  Declan's duplicity is never better displayed than in the season's best episode, when he bribes voters to help re-elect Tommy, all with the approval of his supervisors who want the Caffee's blood.

Even though Brotherhood takes a step back in its second season, it's still among the best television has to offer.  Sharply written, wonderfully acted and as serious and somber as a funeral, the often graphically violent drama both entertains and challenges viewers with a family so unlike any other family in the world, yet also so similar to us all.",1199750400,28,2133,5.089080459770115

Quite focused on the darker side of human behavior, with occasional philosophical insights rendered by characters who one might assume are not that deep -- but it does not seem overly contrived.

Collin adds a great part to the story b/c he is a cousin from Ireland so caught b/w ALL the mix by unfortunately falling in love with gangster Michael's girlfriend yet devoted to Michael as a gangster, and loves his aunt and cousin, Tommy.  So he is woven into the family in an interesting way.  The question is, ""Who will Michael kill next?""

That made for a great series and one you could get into without seeing it as just ""fiction"" with  realistic story lines and multi dimensional  characters versus the robot-like characters  many ""television""  produced series attempt to pass on to the masses. Always packaged neatly. Hot girl FBI agents and young, buffed CSI studs who would and probably would make more money on stage than on pavement.

As the series continues into season two the storyline is getting more complex and the characters more cohesive and well established. The predictability I felt in season one has been replaced with unusual and clever plot twists. Unlike other recent series I've watched Brotherhood is not inundated with a glut of new characters at every other turn. Instead, the characters are allowed to mature and the viewer is allowed to get more connected with them. Almost every aspect I chided in season one has been much bettered in season two. I am now very much involved in the story and it's players and am anxious to see what is in store for season three!

So I wanted to learn how Irish people did the same sans the physical resemblance, and I  decided to give this series a try. Didn't like it. It's a Soprano wannabe series but with Irish people/mob who have a free pass to make racial insults against Black people & other races. Who knew that Rhode Island only had 1 Black official in the entire city? I would think that there would be other races than Irish people in the 21st century in Rhode Island. At least hire actors of different races and culture to walk by/in stores/in political office etc to make this town/storyline believeable! Two stars for giving me insight on how Irish Americans can be as thuggish, corrupt and racist as the Italian American
Mafia was.  The costume department must have saved tons of money on clothes because the actors looked like they rolled out of bed and put on what they wore the previous day or even from home! Michael's a big shot gangster who wears sneakers! Lol! And he wears a leather jacket from the '80s just about everyday when filming was done in the summer! Does a leather coat make you a ganster? Showtime thought so. Where does all the corrupt money go? Certainly not on their homes or for repairs in their home eg. Tommy couldn't run the A/C without it blowing a fuse. Come on! Where does his money go? And where does his wife get money to buy weed or coke if she doesn't work? Tommy is never seen giving her (or the kids) an allowance.

Little things like that which take away from the show.  A mistake is cool here or there but gosh, it all adds up.  The quality of the video is poor too, they are shooting in video right?  I know you save a fortune NOT shooting film, but a good show deserves it.  I guess they blew the film budget getting all the actors on this that they did.  Who knows.

Another crappy crime show where everyone is a criminal or needs a psychiatric evaluation and keeper.

This is another Hollywood BS show designed by the Left and Reds to bring down America and portray our country in a poor light. I say ""stuff it where the sun don't shine"" and avoid this garbage and the many other bad message shows with little truth and all BS. Boycott them and the programmers who are only interested in pushing drugs on you and your kids and the bad behavior (like pornography on the culture). They can only be stopped when they feel it in their pockets and bottom line. Money is their God. You have the power to change this in our country and make America great again.",1398211200,,807,4.527397260273973

Michael and Eileen keep the faade of a happy family alive.  Colin (Bran F. O'Byrne), the Irish cousin of Michael and Tommy, returns to Providence.  Rose harbors a deep distrust of him.  Colin sets out to find his actual father.  Rose's old, and often recent, flame Judd Fitzgerald (Len Cariou) turns out to be the culprit.  He wanted Rose but had to settle for Rose's sister.

Tommy keeps trying to move up the political latter.  A reelection has him garnering support from his sister Mary Kate (Kerry O'Malley), wife of ne'er-do-well and useless political aid, Jimmy (Bates Wilder) Martinson.

Kevin 'Moe' Reilly (Billy Smith) keeps an ear out for things.  (Inside joke.  You'd have to watch the series to know what was meant.)",1397174400,,930,4.631901840490798

My suspicion is that it was designed as a  more long-running epic series which got cut short because of poor ratings and budget limitations. As a result, we have a series that doesn't offer satisfactory closure in terms of character arcs and plotlines. Still, the two Jason's perform beautifully as gangster and politician brothers, ably supported by Annabeth Gish, Fionnula Flannigan and especially Kevin Chapman as the mob boss you love to hate.

To complicate things even more for the Caffee's, their estranged Irish cousin Colin (Brian F.

3236253,5,B000XCZGXG,"Having gobbled up the first series on DVD box set from Amazon I was almost like a junkie waiting for my fix of series 2.
The characters are so well drawn in this series that you feel compelled to worry about their wellbeing, even the devious Michael Caffey.
Every character is well drawn even the bit players make the overall piece work sublimely.
Tommy's marriage now on shaky ground and Michael, recovering from the beat down he recieved in series one is trying to reclaim his territory once again from Freddie Cork.
His romance with Kathleen is under immense pressure due to his instability and his predictability has taken a turn for the worse.
Tommys reliance on old friends seems to be looking less reliable and he is learning that life in politics on the Hill can be as dangerous a game as any his brother plays.
Declans character takes on a major role in this season and if you didn't feel for him in series one you sure do by the end of series two.
The subplot of the attempted entrapment of Marty Trio and Freddie Cork heats up and so does the action with both the Caffey brothers fighting for their survival in their chosen arenas.
And like all good Irish families it's all held together by the love of a good mother, Rose, who has her battles to deal with as she comes to terms with her own ageing.
All the women in this series are so well drawn and strong they could almost carry the show on their own.
But like all good series it takes a well defined and acted cast to make you want to watch and I for one cannot wait for seazon 3 to start down here in Australia.",1233964800,3,1577,4.313131313131313
