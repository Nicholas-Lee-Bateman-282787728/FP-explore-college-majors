8263535,3,B0016NOUYC,"This video was a little weird. I guess I wanted something a little more movement, little less meditation. I did the workout quite a few times but just didn't feel that I got much out of it.",1294185600,,189,4.135135135135135
8263536,4,B0016NOUYC,"This yoga video is great if you want a nice, calming set of stretching and breathing exercises.  I'm 30 weeks pregnant and just started it.  It allowed me to breathe easier, and I really appreciated the fact that it was nice and slow.  It's definitely more relaxation than exercise, but at 30 weeks pregnant and in decent shape, I didn't need something to kick my butt.  It's the only workout DVD that I've ever bought that I was excited about when it was over.  I really can't wait to do it again.  Her voice is soothing, but if you require lots of great camera work and scenery, you'll be disappointed.  I'm not sure why anyone needs high quality video while working out, but...I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could, only because there is one part (about a couple minutes) where she moves from pose to pose too fast for me.  Other than that, I think it's great if you just want to unwind and feel better!",1248480000,2,907,4.325443786982248
8263537,1,B0016NOUYC,"I ordered the Prenatal Yoga video since I started a prenatal yoga class and enjoy it a lot.  Yet there are times I am unable to get to the class and would like to do it at home.  This video to me was much more boring than I expected.  It does yoga moves that I like, but the background wooded area was sooo dull to me.  It looked dead and the in b/w scenes were just as bad.  I don't know, it just wasn't a great prenatal yoga video to me.  It's just doable if I need it.",1242777600,,471,3.7551020408163267
8263538,3,B0016NOUYC,"I was a little disappointed with this yoga DVD because it is SO low impact. I think it is probably good for someone that is about nine months pregnant and can barely move. I am 8 months pregnant (32 weeks) and can still do the power yoga, so this was not a challenge for me at all. If you are wanting something that will relax you and take minimal effort, this is the DVD for you.",1238112000,,380,4.0131578947368425
8263539,4,B0016NOUYC,"This is my favorite of three prenatal yoga dvds.  I started it at around 34 weeks, as a yoga novice.  I appreciate that it's ""doable"" -- she gives modifications of all the poses based on trimester, and I can do the entire workout without hurting myself.  Her voice, the outdoor scenery, and the music are quite peaceful and relaxing.  Also, the narration is not hokey; there are  videos of her sonogram, and she often asks you to think of your baby.

If you are expecting a hardcore workout, you will be disappointed.  This video is all about stretching and relaxing --  I love doing it before bed at night.  I find it a good complement to cardio workouts at the gym, and I count it as relaxation practice for my Bradley childbirth classes.

The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I don't like the series of seated chair poses; they don't feel good to me and seem to stretch the wrong muscles in the wrong way.  I substitute a few other poses during that part.  Otherwise, I really love this video.",1233532800,2,1009,4.365591397849462
8263540,1,B0016NOUYC,"I bought this dvd after reading the reviews of other pregnant women, and I was waiting something really nice. When the DVD arrived and I saw the first minutes of the workout I felt really dissapointed.
It is an amateur video, with a camera put in the middle of a park (?) and a lady trying to do some yoga. The image has a really bad quality and there is no selection of scenes.
It is really an amateur video of a couple: the husband holds the camera and his wife does the exercises.
Avoid it.",1232755200,,493,4.145833333333333
8263541,4,B0016NOUYC,"This yoga workout is very gentle and relaxing.  If you're looking for a good workout that makes you sweat, this is not for you!  However, if you want something relaxing and easy with some labor preparation then you should check this out.",1231632000,2,237,4.619047619047619
8263542,5,B0016NOUYC,"This yoga video was absolutely perfect during my pregnancy.  I had one other pregnancy video but the bouncing around of the aerobics was extremely uncomfortable.  After all, that's a lot of fluid and extra weight to be bouncing around! ""Yoga for Pregnancy"" was a smooth workout that stretched my sore muscles and helped my body feel invigorated.  The instructor had a soothing, reassuring voice, which helped me relax and get in tune with my body.

I carried my baby really high which lead to extreme shortness of breath.  I never felt like I could get a full breath in.  This video helped me to use the capacity of my lungs and to take in deep, full breaths.  It's amazing what energy can come from deep breathing!

Pregnancy can be so hard on a body.  This video was one of the only things I did that provided relief and made me feel better.  I highly recommend it!",1225756800,5,867,4.5
8263543,5,B0016NOUYC,"I love this DVD!  The poses are terrific-suitable for all trimesters and for REAL women.  I don't feel like I'm endangering my baby.  A wonderful workout that makes you feel energized, relaxed, calm, and more centered.  The music is lovely and the scenery is peaceful.  I feel like she's trying to help me, not kill me!  Highly recommended.

I am not one of those pregnant moms who thinks that I need to burn it all off now or never.  I wanted something that would be a gentle, but slightly challenging workout for someone like me.  I found it here.  I feel more prepared for labor, and more relaxed.  It has helped tremendously with my sciatica.  I feel more energized and like I'm not so short of breath.  I found this DVD very enjoyable!",1208131200,7,740,4.473684210526316
