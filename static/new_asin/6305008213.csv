962747,5,6305008213,"If you are a fan of Tim Conway and Harvey Korman you will enjoy this video.  Do not expect high production values.  Expect to see Tim and Harvey carry on in the spirit of Laurel and Harvey where what can go wrong will go wrong.  This does not tell a story and has no plot it is a collection of comedic episodes focusing on what happens when two inept people venture into the great outdoors of Colorado.

A couple of nice extras:

'The Prankster and the Stooge.'  Tim talks about pranks he played on Harvey during their 40 plus years working together.

'Tim's Great Outdoors Memories.'  This gives some wonderful insight into video with many asides.",1290211200,8,648,4.525862068965517

962750,3,6305008213,"We love Tim Conway & Harvey Korman together!!  We did enjoy this one, but we also felt it was not one of their best.  I think the problem was more in the writing than their performance.",1157932800,3,185,4.111111111111111

7882534,5,6305008213,Absolutely HILARIOUS! Those idiots couldn't hit the ground if they fell on it! They'd make Mrs. Wiggins look like Albert Einstein! It almost looked like a remake of Dorf with his caddy Leonard.,1490745600,,193,4.878787878787879

7882542,5,6305008213,"This DVD was a hoot.  Don't expect high definition picture because this isn't.  It is no doubt the original recordings from back before we even dreamed of high definition or Blu-Ray, but the content is the goofy silly antics Tim and Harvey are both known for.  I bought this for my Mom for her 90th birthday and she loved it!",1407110400,,325,4.383333333333334
