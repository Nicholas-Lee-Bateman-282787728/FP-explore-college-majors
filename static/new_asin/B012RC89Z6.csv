7358062,3,B012RC89Z6,"I see a lot of reviews say it was riveting / suspenseful, etc..  and rate it a 5...  However, I would rank something like Ironman. Expendables, Matrix, etc... like a 5.  This is more like a 3 or 4.  Very good, interesting, a little entertaining - certainly fun to see Norman in a leading role - but not a ""5"".

Thanks Norman - would like to see more from you!",1439596800,,359,4.071428571428571
7358063,4,B012RC89Z6,"I've read reviews that complained that this movie wasn't suspenseful enough, that it was too slow or that the twists were obvious but my husband and I were riveted. We kept on missing dialog because we couldn't stop commenting on things. I took this movie as a psychological thriller and it really worked on that level. What was driving these two men to do what they were doing was fascinating to watch unfold and after the movie was over it generated a lively conversation between us about them. Very well acted by both Reedus and Hounsou. I really cared about both of them. Wish I could have seen it on a big screen but it was only released in 15 theaters nationwide. If it ever comes around my area I will definitely go see it again though.",1439596800,51,743,4.430656934306569

7358069,3,B012RC89Z6,"I hate to be a fence sitter. This movie gets THREE STARS because it had some good elements, but equally bad elements. SPOILER ALERT!  The worse thing about it is the lack luster ending. Really?  Did we go all the way around the block just to get back here?

So a white guy and a black guy walk into an abandoned missile silo...stop me if you've heard this one...and the world has ended, all except for the people sleeping in stasis inside the silo that these two yokels are supposed to be maintaining.

The movies social justice racial overtones are obvious, but I'll let you decide just how obvious. It seemed odd to me that the killer didn't want to murder anyone, until his wife, who is asleep in stasis but appears to him in his delusions, tells him to do so. WOW. So the overall point of AIR is just a failed attempt at blaming the violence of one group on the power that the other group ostensibly has over them? Apparently.  Score another one for the SJW's that infest Hollywood.

Did ANYONE else catch this?  Was it intentional? In one scene, the Norman Reedus slap-kisses a poster of Farah Fawcett that he has taped up in one of the air locks. His pal, played by Djimon Hounsou, experiences a mishap with his sleep-tube. It catches on fire. Fawcett starred in a 1984 movie called THE BURNING BED. That has to be someone's intentional, inside joke!

Further irony, Fawcett's character was a mother of three in the 1984 flick, and here, Reedus had a wife and three kids. He allowed them to die in the nuclear/chemical attacks while he remained below ground and survived. That is all disclosed in the way of background dialogue, and really has little to do with the situation the two find themselves in as they are running out of oxygen.

I was okay for nothing else to do movie watching. I'd recommend a rental if you feel compelled to watch.",1501891200,,1849,4.479166666666667

7358089,2,B012RC89Z6,"I was very disappointed and kind of Glad when the end came. The theme of this movie is defenitly post apocalyptic and the story line was (excuse the pun) fresh, in that it looked at a possibility that hasn't really been covered by other post apocalyptic writers but It was for me like viewing a low budget film and after looking at these two interact on the same set for 98% of the film I was glad to see this one end. I felt the two main characters were very mismatched and the film doesn't give really any background into either one of them like what qualified either one to have the job they were given to start with leaving the viewer as well as he characters kind of thrown into the script and once you figured out what they were doing and why everything kind of goes downhill from there with very little drama or action. Norman Reedus played his character much as he plays Daryl from the walking dead and even left his hair the same and dressed the same ( minis the angle wing
vest) . Also this guy Hounsou who seem to put very little if any heart into his roll was really a boar to watch and frankly I think would do better playing the part of a silent bouncer in the corner of a bar that a camera might happen to pan across once or twice in any other film. The only thing that made me happy about this film is the fact I rented it before I decided to by it but even then I felt I paid way to much. All in all, It gave me the same feeling i get after going thru a McDonald's drive thru and getting home to learn the large container of fries I paid for was only half full and there were no fries in the bottom of the bag. Sorry Norman, but you should stick to fighting the dead instead of trying to bring life to an already dead film.",1475366400,,1740,4.046376811594203

He's great in Boondock Saints and his reality show, Ride with Norman Reedus is a fun show. The guy is cool, personable and down to earth and a huge fan favorite to boot! Unfortunately, the roles he is given do not showcase his raw and genuine talent.

7358137,4,B012RC89Z6,"If I could I would give this 3.5 stars.  4 seems high for what it was and 3 seems low.  So I'll err on the side of positivity because I did enjoy the movie and do not regret watching it.  I'll try to stay spoiler free as I've seen some of the other reviewers inadvertently it seems give some important information away too soon.  As a fan of TWD I was interested to see Reedus and Kirkman work together on another project but was disappointed when it was not given any fanfare or wide release.  It deserved it but having seen it I can understand why some distributors may have been skeptical.

The movie is mostly a character study of two high tech janitors responsible for maintaining the cryogenic tubes keeping the future of humanity (scientists, experts, and probably some politicians, etc) alive until the world is habitable again after war has left the air poisonous.  The two couldn't be much more different yet they do have some chemistry early on and it appears despite their differences they do work well together and like each other.  The actors are perfect for the roles.  Could the movie have been more widely distributed with bigger name stars?  Sure, but I felt Reedus and his counterpart played their parts as well as needed.  I would be interested to see if these two will appear in any movies in the future based on their work together in Air.  There is more going on under the surface than is out in the open, especially early in the movie.

There is little action for 90% of the movie which makes the 10% seem out of place rather than welcomed in my opinion.  However, it doesn't seem forced, just a natural progression of the story.  Still, I appreciated the earlier psychological and human complexities and when the story meets its final conclusion it feels like a letdown.  Not so much a let down as in disappointment but almost like it deserved a different ending.  Hard to explain because I liked the movie but it is not perfect nor for anyone.  I'd like to call it a well-done character study of human flaws and a microcosm of human nature, but that might be taking it too far.

PROs:
* Well-acted with decent chemistry between characters
* Atmospheric
* Decent if not totally original premise

CONs:
* Lack of action will alienate some audience members
* Does in an hour and a half what Alfred Hitchcock Presents and Twilight Zone could do in 30 minutes to an hour
* The third act and ending may not deliver as much as viewer expects after investing their interest

Overall: This is a different, moody, atmospheric and well-acted movie but it is not a ""great"" movie.  Totally worth watching, and with average expectations one shouldn't be disappointed.  Not resorting to jump scares or containing bad acting keep this a level above slasher films and many mediocre thriller/horror movies, but by delving into the psychological rather than the physical it raises the bar higher than it will deliver for most.",1456358400,,2933,4.630560928433269

7358197,4,B012RC89Z6,"Air is a movie with two (and a half if you include the woman occasionally one talks to in his mind) actors, there's a few extras as chronologically frozen style coma patients, but that's it. It's a confined to a bunker likely for the rest of their lives character driven plot, where these guys are awakened every six months to check machines aren't breaking down and everything is still running smoothly for the important people who are kept asleep until the world outside recovers enough for them to rebuild it. Obviously we wouldn't have much of a plot for the movie if nothing was going to go wrong and the guys were just going to back to sleep when the hour and a half of allocated oxygen or however long it was runs out. If you were after a Walking Dead style action film which is understandable since the DVD cover has that shows name in capitals on the front telling you it is from the same creator, than you will likely be disappointed as it is not that type of film. If you do like Daryl Dixon from The Walking Dead though, you may be pleased to know Norman Reedus is pretty much playing the same character, just with a different name. I actually found that factor a bit disappointing as I would have liked to have seen what else the actor could do. We've seen him as himself in the extras of TWD as we do on the ones on this, and it's pretty obvious he's nothing like Daryl and I would have loved to have seen that guy as a character or something else Reedus could come up with. Daryl Dixon does fit the story line of this one but yeah, something different would have been nice.

Like all these sorts of sci-fi movies, there's a lot of stuff we need explained to us about the scenario. Air disappoints in that it does't really tell us much, we don't even really know what happened to bring the world as we know it to an end. But aspects such as how putting people to sleep so they don't age is even possible. There's also factors like how can they just get up and walk and move after being asleep for six months when a comma patient for a month or so needs to learn to walk again with rehab? Why does their hair not get longer during the six months, why doesn't one start growing facial hair at all and the others not get longer?

Spoilers follow - There's also inconsistencies, outsiders couldn't open a door as well as get through a grate in the vents, due to how it was built to protect the occupants while they slept, yet Hounsou's character can get into these places without a code or special key or something. If he could do so (and rather easily) why couldn't people motivated with avoiding their own death do it?",1446163200,,2630,4.300403225806452

7358223,4,B012RC89Z6,"This science fiction story is almost a two-person film.  I say science fiction, because it is set in the future, but except for a few details it could be imagined as a future not far away.  In other words, the interest here is not in razzle-dazzle technology but in the relationships and the story.  The main actors are Sandrine Holt and Djimon Hounsou.  [I know, rightwho?]

Both the beginning and the end of the story are wrapped in a bit of mystery allowing you, the viewer, to fill in the blanks however you please.  This much is clear: someone was attacking cities with what appears to be a new chemical agent of death, that is airborn.  Who exactly was behind it, why they were doing it, and how the agent worked are left unexplained, because the main characters don't know.  The story starts with brief TV news-clips, showing chaos in the cities, and the US President at a press conference saying that the government was taking all needed precautions for our citizens.

This President was one of the few other characters you hear talking in the film and I knew Id seen him before but it took me a while to place him.  Thats Michael Hogan, the X-O or second in command in the Battlestar Galactica series.  He did a credible job here, looking and sounding like the President.

So the heart of the story is that self-contained underground bunkers are set up to preserve an important mix of people to repopulate above ground, as soon as the air becomes clear enough for survival.  In the meantime most of the inhabitants of the bunkers are in a sort of deep hibernation [the only technological part of the story that we aren't quite capable of today] and two engineers must spend the majority of their time in hibernation but once a day have to wake up for an hour or two, perform maintenance tasks and ensure that everything is still working properly.  Thats where our two-character cast comes into play.

The movie is an indie done on a pretty low budget, but I felt it made excellent use of the money it did have to spend.  The set had just the right sort of mixture of semi-high-tech, claustrophobic messiness one might expect under such conditions.  And like the crew in Last Days on Mars, two engineers with nobody but each other to talk to, day after day for who knows how long, soon start getting on each others nerves

I mentioned ambiguity.  Possible spoiler alert: at the end of the film, you DO see the hibernating people waking up.  What is not clear however is just how many survivors there really are.  Did only the people in this one bunker make it?  Did people elsewhere survive?  Will civilization go on, or only the species, degenerating into a new stone age, or are there insufficient survivors even for that?  At least the film ended with an encouraging note, that all was not lost.

Of course I have skipped much of the plot and this is just a brief overview.  At times it may seem a little slow for a sci-fi movie.  The soundtrack did not strike me as exceptional.  The cinematography was mostly on the dark side--not surprising, since most of the action is taking place in an underground bunker set to preserve power as long as possible.  I did like the visuals.  The acting is good, although the script occasionally would have benefitted from some additional tweaking.

For an indie science fiction film with a small cast and a low budget, this was better than I expected.  I give it a B.",1442966400,,3416,4.540098199672668

Cartwright (Djimon Hounsou) imagines and talks to his wife (Sandrine Holt). Cartwright's sleeper unit becomes damaged which sets the plot in motion as our two try to find a fix.

Oh yes, if you come out of the ""high tech coffin"" unit too fast, the oxygen transition can effect the brain.

This is a slow paced two man (and one imagined woman) drama with a sci-fi background. It is a character study. The scant details of what happened comes about 20 minutes into the movie. A twist? Sure.

If there is any doubt in anyone's mind reading this as to whether or not this is worth the buy: prepare to drop your jaw in awe of the raw humanity displayed within - the insanity, the personal relation to the characters' struggle with eachothers' perspective, the horrible psychological implications of what reality vs. fantasy can offer us, the viewer - it's all present, and the hour-and-a-half spent watching this was fully worth it; I wouldn't ask for a minute of my time on earth back, spent in viewing this.

Granted, Reedus's character's persona *is* similar to his TWD persona - but any stoicism possessed therein is quite lost at the height of the story this movie relates; his insanity would be anyone's, at the revelation about his co-worker's actions, as the suspense builds to it's climax.

If you aren't suffering from post-apocalyptic scenario burnout syndrome, then this *might* be worth your time. It's basically science fiction of the ""last man on Earth"" (no, not the comedy) variety. Air manages to run the gamut of man vs. man, man vs. himself, and man vs. nature, but mostly on a superficial level (i.e., philosophy you might expect from this type of sci-fi is conspicuously absent). While the skeleton is set up to make us expect big things, there just isn't much meat on the bones. If Air were a meal, you'd likely still be hungry after watching it.

You get the impression that Reedus was doing Air between scenes for The Walking Dead (TWD), because it's almost as if he walked off the TWD set and onto the Air set not wanting to depart too far out of Daryl Dixon mode (even his hair remains the same). Rather than a strikingly different character from the one we all know on TWD, we just get a Daryl who thinks less and talks more. Djimon Hounsou did a fine job as the counterpoint character. The soundtrack is decent, ranging from almost retro (reminiscent of Tangerine Dream) to more traditional and contemporary sci-fi incidental noise.

Final thoughts: Sadly, Air doesn't break new ground. It may be worth seeing if [1] you are head over heels for Reedus, or/and [2] you're a diehard sci-fi fan, and/or [3] you have a post-apocalyptic fetish.",1439769600,18,1391,4.735537190082645

No jump scares or spectacular effects are needed to keep you on the edge of your seat - just the tension between two great actors and a scenario that takes the ""ticking clock"" to a new level.  Norman Reedus gets to do some more serious acting here than he does on The Walking Dead, and does it with conviction. Djimon Huntsu deliers a subtle and solid performance even if he doesn't have as much to do.  First time director, and screenwriter Christian Cantamessa is a giant in the video game business, having led the design for the masterpiece that is Red Dead Redemption, and his talents clearly translate to film.
