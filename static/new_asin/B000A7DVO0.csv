2378568,4,B000A7DVO0,"Hey, this is just pure fun and it's great that the biggest dream match in boxing history sort of happened. Watching these two greats swap punches, even pulled punches, is a thrilling experience.

My only criticism is the computer decision. As evidenced in Ali/Foreman and Ali/Frazier, Ali can take some devastating punches and still go the distance. I would argue that both Frazier and Foreman hit harder than Marciano as they weigh quite a bit more as well. Add into that Marciano's short reach, and you've got to give this to Ali by decision. Marciano had not fought anyone of Ali-in-his-prime's caliber--his two toughest foes, Walcott and Louis, were both way out of their primes and in their late 30's while Marciano was in his twenties--prime years for a fighter.

I guess I can't blame the computer, as at the time of filming, Ali hadn't fought those heavy hitters and you have to wonder what kind of data was fed into the computer. Nearly every boxing expert gives this to the Greatest.

If you'd like to see a more fnatastic version of this fight, go watch Rocky 2. It's obvious who Balboa and Creed were based on.",1167523200,4,1122,4.685279187817259
2378569,3,B000A7DVO0,"Professional boxing seemed like the best sport to let the computer decide who was the greatest heavyweight champion ever. Since the complaint - which still remains - is how fighters from different eras could be ""evenly"" matched up, it was a natural for some promoter to take the human element out of the equation with the emerging technology.

A Miami-based boxing promoter made the idea a reality in the late 1960s with a series of radio ""fights"" between champs of different eras, with the results figured out through a computer, and the action transcribed for airplay.

The success of that series brought the ""Superfight"" of Muhammad Ali v. Rocky Marciano. Neither fighter was active at the time - Ali was suspended due to his religious stance against serving in the military and Marciano had not been in the ring for many years.

The participants met in a sparring session in 1969 where the action was choreographed and then edited for the ""match."" On January 20, 1970, boxing fans in 1,500 theaters in the U.S. and Europe witnessed the event, which actually had two different endings (one was only shown in several European markets). The movie also aired once on ABC's Wide World of Sports.

The hype surrounding the movie included the publishing of a magazine with photographs from the sparring session and leaving the reader guessing on what would happen in the latter rounds. What was most surprising was the outstanding physical condition of Marciano; who had been retired for about 13 years. He was to tragically die in a plane crash months after the film was shot.

More of a novelty piece for the boxing enthusiast, it showed how fans then had a unique interest in an emerging tool - the computer - as a means to determine the outcome in what remains a sport truly driven by the human psyche.",1167091200,10,1803,4.766025641025641
2378570,5,B000A7DVO0,"I saw the 1970 'fight' on the way home from a trip to the UK, and thought it was truly exciting; indeed, many of the Boeing-767 passengers around me seemed engrossed by it. It seemed like a real fight, but with the benefit of knowing it was not real, and no one was really getting hurt. It was originally even shown in theaters on closed-ciruit TV. It brought back memories of when heavy weight championship fights were world-wide events.

Though I have great admiration for boxers, particularly for these two, I think that the sport itself is cruel.  But that was not a problem here since they spliced together footage of the two fighters sparing with each other (and subtly pulling punches), according to computer projections.  I'm not sure that anybody could have beaten Ali, the greatest athlete these eyes have ever seen, in his prime; but, who knows what a war-horse like Marciano could have done at his peak. The result created a furor, with law suits flying back and forth with the makers of the film.  The 'event' was enhanced by leading boxing experts who differed on how the fight should have turned out. It was taken seriously by folks at the time, and maybe even now; but for someone like me, years later, it was great fun.",1144713600,16,1236,4.6045454545454545
2378571,2,B000A7DVO0,"What can I say. This may be a good watch for the common man but not for any true boxing people..Another attempt to sell something, which aint close to the truth. Rocky Marciano was around 180-185 pounds and a very smallish heavyweight. Muhammed Ali was between 210-215 pounds in his prime. Muhammed Ali was much faster and had the footwork to outwork Sonny Liston(easy) and the rest of 60`s best nheavyweights. Its really sad to see that this is just another attempt to get the white man(Marciano) to win over the black man(Ali).Iam white by the way.

The same thing happened(almost) to Larry Holmes. When he was on the brink of passing Marciano`s record with 49 victories(or equal it) they gave the fight to Michal Spinks..Its sad that authorites in boxing has this kind of power..

Muhammed Ali will in most people`s minds be the greatest heavyweight ever lived..",1144454400,6,865,4.798657718120805
2378572,4,B000A7DVO0,"They got it right. Very cool DVD for boxing fans. I owned the original version and I love what they've done with the DVD. Lots of extras and cool graphics. Great idea to include a radio tournament from around 1968, it was not related to the Superfight. They were two separate ideas. Ali lost in the semis of the radio tourney and ironically Marciano won it by beating Jack Dempsey in the final.

  Im a big Marciano fan and loved the dvd quality footage of the Rock training. As for history they got it right. I think Marciano and Ali were the two greatest champions in history with Joe Louis a close third. As for the the outcome I completely agree. Muhammad Ali was truly great (and made sure to constantly tell everybody) but he was not invincible. Joe Frazier fought him 3 times and gave Ali everything he wanted in every fight, winning once. Ken Norton matched up even better than Frazier, Ali never could figure him out. In their 3 fights Norton dominated the first one (even breaking Ali's jaw), lost a close decision in the second, then got robbed in the third encounter by one of the worst judges decisions in boxing history (please watch this and judge for yourself). My point is that Ali was not invincible, and I think Marciano, the best conditioned champ in history, would have caught up with anyone in rounds 10-15. He just never stopped throwing punches.

  And so all in all, a great DVD.",1141430400,16,1404,4.5078740157480315
2378573,5,B000A7DVO0,"I read about the computer tournament years ago and now to have this on DVD to experience, it is fantastic!  Watching the ""bout"" was just incredible.  As a huge boxing fan as well as an internet boxing writer, I learned a lot about both Marciano and Ali.  The highlight of the package for me were the radio calls of all the bouts in the tournament that led up to the Marciano-Ali contest.  The descriptions are so vivid, you sometimes forget you are not listening to real bouts.  This is a boxing fan's dream DVD!!",1137110400,11,513,4.414893617021277

2378616,5,B000A7DVO0,"I do NOT believe this fight was a computer fight as it was an actual fight. Nobody in their right mind can ever convince me that we had the capabilities to produce a computer generated fight with 3D superimposed figures of Ali and Marciano. The original simulation was done with shadows. It predicted Marciano as the winner which infuriated Ali's ego. As Marciano was retired at age 46, got back in the ring and did the marine workout for six months which he unconditionally agreed to meet the young Ali in the ring for an unofficial and yes, unofficial fight. As they fought you can see Marciano's traditional fighting hitting his opponent all over the torso. He even had his orthodox positioning and everything. Eventually Marciano knocked him out. And strangely Marciano dies in a plane crash several weeks later raising concerns of a conspiracy, a sorry fact indeed seeing that Ali was a boost to the black self esteem. And the copies of this film were destroyed and unbelievable that a copy was actually saved by the Library of Congress. You figure. All I say is an unofficial fight and Marciano remains the best boxer of all time. Period. That is my unbiased opinion. And this is by far one of the best fights I have seen.",1383955200,,1228,4.637614678899083

2378618,4,B000A7DVO0,"I heard a lot about the Superfight but didn't get a chance to watch it until the DVD came out. A computer determined the winner between Marciano and Ali. Both fighters acted out the ""script"" for this film. I was not disappointed when I saw it. It was very interesting and truly legendary as both Marciano and Ali were still in great fighting shape. Marciano was known to add muscle just for this computer-simulated fight because he took it so seriously while Ali was dancing. They say ""styles make fights"" and this boxing match proves it. Both Marciano and Ali have amazing records and legacies. Both fighters box convincingly with the computer tabulating results at the end of each round.

Special Features: Complete original fight, One-hour Superfight Documentary, produced by Michael DeLisa, author of The Cinderella Man, Color booklet of the history and photos from the fight, Bonus: Footage of Marciano's and Ali's careers, Bonus: All 15 (one hour each) original Radio Fantasy Fights

2378623,5,B000A7DVO0,"I opened the DVD this Christmas morning, just finished watching it and all I can say is, AWESOME!! This entire film is what Boxing was all about back in it's ""Golden Age."" Two Undefeated Heavyweight Champions with very different styles meeting to see who was the greatest of all time. The entire film was very informative of both Marciano and Ali in their fighting styles and dedication to the sport, along with old clips of each fighter training and rare interviews before the fight takes place. The actual ""fight"" itself was way more real than I was led to believe. I know the head punches were supposed to be pulled but in a few rounds it looks as if they both actually got in more than their share of real head shots, making the fight even better. Most people disagree with the outcome of Marciano defeating Ali but I think the computer did get it right. Marciano was willing to take a beating in early rounds just to wear down his opponents with bone crushing body shots and go in for the kill! The later the fight went on, the more dangerous Rocky became and it showed. This is truly a MUST SEE for anyone out there who loves or even likes Boxing.",1293235200,4,1153,4.417840375586854
2378624,5,B000A7DVO0,"The famous ""Superfight"" between Rocky Marciano and Muhammad Ali was the brain child of Maury Woroner.  After inputting countless descriptions of each boxer's style, strengths, weaknesses, etc. into a computer, Maury convinced the two legends to spar in an undisclosed location while being filmed.  Different outcomes were made and the results are captured here.  The original film was shown only once in theaters and once on ABC's Wide World of Sports in 1970.  I saw the film in 1970 and jumped at the chance to own a piece of boxing history.  Also included are the recreations of radio broadcasts of boxing matches between other great champions in a single elimination tournament to determine the ultimate heavyweight champion.  The price for the dvds is very acceptable and the quality is excellent!",1278720000,2,802,5.130769230769231
2378625,2,B000A7DVO0,"Marciano fought in the weak post WW 2 era. His matches he is most famous for were against boxers who were small or old or both. Ultimately this is the most reasonable way to evaluate a fighter: who did he fight? Consider that Ali fought Jerry Quarry, Larry and Ernie Holmes, Frazier, Norton, Foreman, Sonny Liston.  Yikes! Each of these heavyweights had skill or firepower that were a real danger to the mediocre or untrained fighter. He fought most of these during their prime.  Marciano scored k/o's against many I have never heard of. He is most famous for his wins against Joe Louis and Archie Moore and Walcott and Roland LaStarza. Of these: LaStarza looks like a light heavyweight, Louis and Walcott and Moore were approaching 40 during their fights. Much like a basketball player ages by his early 30's and loses his 'hop' <jumping abaility> , a boxer loses his fast reflexes by the same age. Ali against Larry Holmes said he saw the punches Holmes was throwing coming, but did not have the reflexes to react. Ali was the average age of Louis and Moore and Walcott that Marciano fought.

The best boxing book I have read is Kings of the Ring by Gavin Evans. The best sports book I have read is The Book of Basketball by Bill Simmons. Each book points out that the early stars of the sport  should be applauded and respected for their greatness but not compared to their successors years later, who had more size and speed and skills. Summing up: Mr. Evans writes that Marciano could not compare with Lennox Lewis .  Simmons writes that Steve Nash is a faster and more skilled evolutionary version of Cousy. For this reason, I grew up during the 70's but I have wondered how effective Jerry West would play in the current NBA, with the ferocious defense and above the rim play.

So Marciano should be rightfully lauded for being the best of his time and should stand out more, for his historical contributions, than for example Tyson or Lewis or Klitschko. Having said that in a real fight against these 3, Marciano would have been beaten up against the 6'6"" Klitschko, who has never been knocked down in his career and has a formidable jab that has 'dis-armed' heavy hitters such as Simon Peter and Corrie Sanders. He would have had a real risk of a serious injury against Lewis or <yikes> Tyson in his prime.",1267315200,2,2316,4.582125603864735

2378627,4,B000A7DVO0,"I love this guys response to how Joe Louis was past his prime when Marciano destroyed him,  louis was 38.
Ali was 35 during his last fight with frazier, and I think most would consider him still in his prime at that time.
As for the ""Rumble in the Jungle"" Ali was 34 fighting a much younger George Foreman.  And lastly even though I think Ali is great he NEVER fought anybody of Marciano or Louis's Caliber,  Sonny Liston(the paper champion) and Foreman and Frazier(who'd they ever beat). Marciano defeated a handful of former World Champions with ease, and yea he never lost a fight.",1238544000,2,584,4.542857142857143
2378628,5,B000A7DVO0,"Wow, this is a great two disc set and a must have for any boxing fan!  These two legends really go at it and it is a rather intrigueing event. At first it seems impossible that a fighter like Marciano could defeat Ali because of his quick speed, reflexes, and being a technician of the ring and dynamics involved as far as lateral movement, slashing combinations, and ability to take punishment as he proved through his entire career. But, as one watches, they see a Marciano (who surprisingly showed up in great shape for this event) who is able to turn his physical disadvantages into advantages.  As the fight progresses, the tide slowly starts to turn to Marciano's advantage (a lot having to do with his unyielding determination).  His awkward style really begins to throw off some of Ali's timing, and ability to use his left jab and lean on an opponent.  This fight (with all punches to the body being real, and the head punches only pulled back at times) was really a precursor to the first Ali-Frazier fight in many ways. Yet, unlike Frazier, Marciano does't bob up and down in front, where Ali nailed Frazier easily to the head, Marciano is clever by ducking underneath to his own right shoulder to avoid many punches.  Anyway, this two disc set also features footage of each fighter during their times, and opinions from others who knew them. It also has reproductions of posters inside (albeit small), but is great to see this extravaganza issued so nicely on DVD!  Let's face it, Ali and Marciano were two of the best to ever live, buy it and enjoy a hypothetical dream fight! If only there were more dream fights like this.",1202860800,,1637,4.627586206896551
2378629,4,B000A7DVO0,"We saw this movie, first run, at the Fremont Theater in Las Vegas. The under card was Allen Funt's ""What do you say to a naked lady"". All together it was a great movie night. We repeated it several days later. Ali, aka Casius Clay was having a lot of trouble with Uncle Sam about not wanting to be a soldier. He appeared in a Candid camera show too. The fight was just as exciting as any championship fight could be. Later I read that they fought 63 2 minute rounds to make the movie. Ali was a little upset over the ending in the movies I saw. They really did beat each other up pretty good. If you haven't seen this you should. Marciano didn't live very long after making it but he'll live on forever now. How's that for a fight that never was? The producers did a wonderful job.",1195516800,,781,4.144736842105263
2378630,4,B000A7DVO0,"Ali-Marciano never really happened, of course, and yet, in a sense, it did. If you were around when the computerized fight was originally shown, this DVD will help you relive an intriguing sports conundrum. Intriguing and exciting -- the staging was undeniably well done, more realistically than any fight sequence has ever been staged for a Hollywood movie.

Did the right man ""win""? I have no ax to grind between Ali and Marciano. I was a teen when the movie was first shown with a keen interest in boxing (the sport, not the joke it has become in recent years) and I took Rocky to win because, based on the evidence we had of Ali pre his hiatus, Marciano seemed just the one kind of fighter who would always have given him trouble. Two years later, at MSG, this hunch was proven right by Frazier, a Marciano replica in style and build. My belief -- and I can hear the chorus of disapproval as I write these words -- is that Joe Frazier at his peak (which he lost, for several reasons, quite quickly) would ALWAYS have beaten Ali at his. Doesn't make Ali any less of a great.

One gripe with the DVD. Potentially the most interesting extras on this two-disc set are audio recordings of 15 episodes of a fantasy tournament between 16 former heavyweight champions broadcast on radio in the late 1960s (and produced by the Superfight producer). The broadcasts are fabulously authentic-sounding, but listening to them on the DVD has been rendered almost pointless by the fact that most cut out before the climax! Maybe the original, 40-year-old masters are imperfect and this is the best the DVD's producers could do; maybe they just did a lousy job. Either way, a great pity. But the Superfight itself is in good shape.",1185494400,3,1718,4.629508196721312
