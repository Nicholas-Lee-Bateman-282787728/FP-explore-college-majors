4658850,5,B005DEUEWM,"Myself, I've enjoyed watching this series, so what if it's in B & W, heck that's what makes it so enjoyable. As for quality don't know what complaint is, looks pretty good to me. At least it's out.",1316995200,23,197,4.2105263157894735
4658851,1,B005DEUEWM,"To begin with, Amazon/Timeless tells us that what we're ordering is in color (check above description), but what we actually receive is in black-and-white.  Moreover, T's description claims that re-mastered transfers were utilized for this release, which is simply not true.  These are old, slightly dirty 16mm prints, a throwback to the company's junk releases (RIVERBOAT, THE TALL MAN, M SQUAD) and far below industry standards.  Obviously Timeless hoped that TV fans hooked on the superb 35mm quality of THE VIRGINIAN episodes (which were legitimately re-mastered for their run on Encore, with T ultimately getting the benefit), would assume that this Universal western series from the same period would look comparable.  Nope.  16mm back-up prints, and b/w besides.  Sadly, the show's pretty flat as a creative entertainment to begin with, but the proper presentation would have gone a long way toward making a guilty pleasure purchase like this acceptable.  A little bit of a mystery here: WAS this series shot in color?  Update: The pilot, presented here in b/w, was shot in Pathe color, according to the credit in the end titles.  All the other episodes (at least the ones viewed so far) were filmed in b/w.  My guess is that the color pilot sold the series, but ABC didn't feel like financing color for the twelve additional episodes.  As a result of this, some sources (Retro-TV western sites, Amazon, Timeless) incorrectly categorize DESTRY as a color series, while others (IMDb, Wikipedia) say b/w, but don't explain that a) the pilot was shot in color, and b) whether or not this first hour was actually broadcast on the ABC network in color.  For the record, the 16mm prints used for this release are NOT used syndie prints (DESTRY was too brief a series to make it into syndication); these old 16mm back-ups have probably been gathering dust in Uni vaults for years, but don't have the wear and tear on them that other sub-par Timeless releases are cursed with (as mentioned, M SQUAD is practically unwatchable).  Bottom line: If you're gonna go Timeless for classic Universal westerns, stick to THE VIRGINIAN and WAGON TRAIN (magnificent 35mm re-mastered material) and the upcoming MEN FROM SHILOH, which was probably prepared in a similar quality fashion (it's been out in Europe for a few years, so I imagine Timeless is using the same masters).",1316736000,50,2362,5.010230179028133

4658863,3,B005DEUEWM,"John Gavin  came to the time of Middleage, but still heart-throbingly handsome. It was B&W Western, boring few scenes of Gavin in each episode. I watched only 2 of 13 episodes.

As soon as it arrived I watched all 13 episodes right away.  Remembered enjoying it as a kid, but having seen it again, it was more entertaining than I remembered!  Having nevered gone into syndication I couldn't care how badly the images were, just wanted to see Destry again.  Actually the imagining was very good.  I'm very happy!",1394582400,2,465,4.348837209302325

4658875,3,B005DEUEWM,"Ordered this for my mom, Amazon you need to take Audie Murphy's name out of the description because I ordered it thinking it was the one she was talking about with Audie Murphy. Amazon refused to cancel the order, oh well, she will have the show to enjoy and I will see if I can find Destry the film on DVD.",1356134400,,307,4.049180327868853
4658876,5,B005DEUEWM,"We received our copy of Destry the complete series, this is a different style of western with Destry going out of he way to avoid a fight, John Gavin plays his part so well, we don't as a rule like comedy westerns, this however is not a violent or comedy western but happy to say some where in between. We also enjoyed the Bonus Feature John Gavin Biography. Thanks as always to Amazon and Timeless Media Group.",1347753600,,411,4.35064935064935
4658877,5,B005DEUEWM,"What I like about reviewing shows like this is the fact that they are little remembered or have never been seen. This tells the story of Harrison Destry played by John Gavin, famous for such movies as ""Psycho "" and ""Imitation of Life"".
This series is loosely based on the movie ""Destry rides Again"" with James Stewart back in 1939. Here we have Gavin playing the son of Tom Destry a famous sheriff who during his career had been shot at 37 times. It was the last seven,one night, that did him in.
The series traces Harrison Destry's adventures each week as he tries to track down  Charlie Bent the man who framed him and sent him to prison for two years. This is a comedy western,think of ""Maverick"" and ""Alias Smith and Jones"".
I really liked this series, although it only lasted for one season for 13 episodes. I don't know why this was as it should have lasted a lot longer. But thanks to Timeless Media Group this series long thought of as lost has been restored in all it's glory to be seen here. It's a great little series with a catchy theme tune sung by ""The Ledbetters""",1321747200,8,1078,4.36318407960199

4658879,5,B005DEUEWM,I CAN'T THINK OF A BAD WORD TO SAY ABOUT TIMELESS MEDIA OR THIS SERIES.  SHOT IN BLACK AND WHITE YOU GET 13 EPISODES OF THIS SERIES.  I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THEY WOULD HAVE CANCELLED SUCH A GREAT SHOW.  IF YOU LIKE OLD WESTERNS THIS IS WONDERFUL.,1318118400,2,242,4.0
4658880,5,B005DEUEWM,"I bought this 2 yrs ago from a different source, and am writing this because of the 1 star review, which it doesn't deserve. This was my favorite series way back when and I'm thrilled that it is out. It was black and white, as were all the other shows at that time that I can recall. It's as good as all the other westerns previous to this, like The Rifleman, Sugarfoot, Cheyenne, Bat Masterson, and all the others. It's a great show and deserving of good reviews. As for picture quality, what I bought was great considering the age and unavailability of it all these years. I'm just glad it's available and I'm sure what it being sold here is as good as what I have. It's a treat to see it again.",1317513600,6,697,4.208955223880597
4658881,3,B005DEUEWM,"Destry was a good show,unfortunately it didn't last long. I think it was on for half of a season. Timeless Media has done a masterful job on remastering on shows alot older than this show, the results were a bit lacking on this project. The last episode was best as far as clarity is concerned. Other than that I am happy to have it in my collection.",1316995200,10,350,4.2388059701492535
