8222049,4,B000WB1LKA,"The last minute of the ""Cask of Amontillado"" video is excellently chilling.  The perspective changes from Montresor's point of view to Fortunato's.  We are with him, being walled up in the niche, as the last block is shoved into place.

It has kept ninth graders silent and on the edge of their seats!",1256601600,3,301,4.6415094339622645
8222050,3,B000WB1LKA,"I was interested in the ""Cask of Amontillado"" portion of the video.  It was decent, but somewhat disappointing.  I was looking for a live-action version, with people acting out the story.  Instead, this was only a narrator reading the story aloud while the video showed paintings of the story zoomed in and out.",1251590400,2,311,4.830188679245283
