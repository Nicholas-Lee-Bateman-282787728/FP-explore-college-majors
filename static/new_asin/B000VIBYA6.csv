8218840,5,B000VIBYA6,"First and foremost, I just want to say that this one of the rarest TNA DVDs ever, if not THE rarest. How I managed to get my hands on it, well, I got lucky by buying the Triple Threat set. Also, this event itself is one good PPV overall. Anyway, onto my match ratings:

1. America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) vs. Matt Bentley and Alex Shelley. 7/10. Decent opener.

2. Super X Qualifier- Mikey Batts vs. Sonjay Dutt vs. Elix Skipper vs. Shark Boy. 7/10. Good X-Division action, wish it was a little longer, though.

3. The Diamonds in the Rough (Simon Diamond and David Young) vs. Apolo and Sonny Siaki. Probably my least favorite match of the night. 5/10

4. Chris Sabin vs. Samoa Joe. 8.5/10. Really good match.

5. Team Canada (Bobby Roode, Eric Young, and ""A-1"" Alistair Ralphs) vs. The Naturals (Chase Stevens and Andy Douglas) and Lance Hoyt. 8/10. Good tag team action, but wasn't too crazy about the finish.

6. Kip James and Monty Brown vs. Konnan and Ron Killings. 5.5/10. Decent street fight, but it was mainly to further the 3 Live Kru/Kip James angle.

7. AJ Styles vs. Sean Waltman with Jerry Lynn as the guest referee. 9/10. Great action overall.

8. Christopher Daniels vs. Petey Williams for the X-Division title. 9/10. Really good stuff right here.

9. Dog Collar match for the NWA world title: Raven vs. Abyss. 10/10. Brutal hardcore action, but it was a really good brawl.

Really good PPV but it's one that's really hard to find. Also, from what I see on here, it's up for a really HIGH price. If you feel like you should get it, do so, but don't pass up opportunities that cost a lot less. I got lucky, I will say that.",1311811200,,1658,4.460264900662252
