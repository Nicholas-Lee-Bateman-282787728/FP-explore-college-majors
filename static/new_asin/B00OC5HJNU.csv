8683141,5,B00OC5HJNU,Our family watches snowboarding videos every winter (and throughout the rest of the year) and J. Jones is a favorite!,1454976000,,117,4.9
8683142,5,B00OC5HJNU,"I'm an avid skier so I watch a lot of these films. Higher, the third film in a trilogy, is the finest ski/snowboard movie I've ever watched. You can typically throw on a ski movie and ignore it when you choose because they're short on plot, which is fine because you expect it. A good one has great visuals and an excellent soundtrack.

Higher takes it to another level. It draws you into planning the climbs and has a good dose of Jones's history; and the descents are beautifully filmed. The two previous films are also very good but I think they knocked it out of the park with Higher. Well done, TGR.",1440892800,,604,4.345132743362832
8683143,4,B00OC5HJNU,"Breathtaking.  Beautiful.  Amazing that you can film these types of adventures.  And the skill involved makes me at a loss to wrap my head around it and ask, each time he descends a mountain, ""how does he do that?""",1435536000,,214,4.435897435897436
