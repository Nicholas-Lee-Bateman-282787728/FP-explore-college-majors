8444931,1,B004WD1J60,What the h3ll is it with all these C-movies and the shaky camera?  I couldn't watch more than a few minutes without getting motion sick.  Plug pulled early.  Next!,1521158400,,163,4.551724137931035
8444932,5,B004WD1J60,"Hard to watch but you can not stop, the action is fast kind of a story line but very organic. Poor production value but who cares it is a micro budget zombie film!",1516320000,,163,3.9696969696969697
8444933,2,B004WD1J60,"Not too bad, but the volume of the music and the fact that most of the time it is not music but something more akin to the most annoying alarm clock that you ever heard makes it almost unwatchable. I don't think that the audio was mixed properly since the dialogue was close to inaudible and the ""music"" was ear shattering. Nevertheless, it did have some funny parts. Watch for the crazy special effects (which are also funny) when someone gets shot blood gushes out like a water balloon. Almost like a cartoon.",1509667200,,511,4.505376344086022
8444934,2,B004WD1J60,"Some bad guys are bumping off a witness by dropping a sealed glass tube of green fluorescent die into a stand pipe outside of his house. The next thing you know, we have armed zombies intent on revenge and attacking anyone around.

That;s pretty much it outside of some bad acting, lousy dialogue, and terrible sound quality.

""Better chance running and hiding on foot than driving in a car...""

Has great MST value. Bloody children zombies running and getting shot was my favorite. Part of ""Zombie Horror Fright Fest"" 4-pack.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1410134400,2,569,4.835051546391752
8444935,4,B004WD1J60,"Completely creative.  I give whoever came up with this idea mad props.  Zombies, guns, and the MAFIA!?  And it manages to all come together quite nicely.  It takes real talent to make a movie like this work--and they did!",1370390400,,221,4.589743589743589
8444936,4,B004WD1J60,"I found this movie to be as much fun as the title suggested it would be.  A lot of it you just have to take with a grain of salt...but I mean, it IS called Fast Zombies with Guns.  It is just that...lots and lots of gun wielding zombies, with a fun mobster plot that keeps you interested.",1368316800,,288,3.9482758620689653
8444937,1,B004WD1J60,"The movie sucks,stupid movie about people running around as Zombies. I would call the a low class F movie and I am being fair.",1330128000,,126,4.291666666666667
8444938,4,B004WD1J60,"I've seen just about every movie ever made that has to do with zombies. From George A Romero's Night of the Living Dead, to 28 Days Later (not a true zombie film), and Tokyo Zombie (the only zombie film I couldn't sit through.) Fast Zombies With Guns is just plain fun. What would you do if the world was not only overrun with zombies, but fast ones, and they carry guns?! I'd say we wouldn't stand a snowball's chance in hell. This is a great zombie movie with a twist, and just as gory as any other. Definitely add this to your zombie collection!",1314489600,,548,4.278846153846154
8444939,3,B004WD1J60,"So if you're tired of unarmed, slow-moving zombies, this is your movie.  Unfortunately, as fast as they go, the zombies still show up late, not appearing until a half-hour into the film.  Once they arrive the fun begins, with blood splattering like lawn sprinklers...or a Gallagher concert.  It's all in good fun, a Texas-sized barbeque of devoured flesh.  The dialogue is funny, the irony thick, (unlike the blood).

These zombies can shoot, and also outrun a Toyota, living up to the title.  They go for the neck, infecting their victims, something they have in common with vampires.  Several stories intercut which keeps the action moving, and most of the characters are entertaining.  The battle of the sexes, politics and other contemporary issues (gun control anyone?) complicate the main battle, and the movie delightfully doesn't miss the opportunity for some serious, satiric jabs.

But mostly it's non-stop action for a full hour, with more weaponry than you'd find at Fort Riley, and more blood than the Red Cross sees in a month.  You've been warned.",1313798400,2,1062,5.051724137931035
8444940,3,B004WD1J60,"Pretty amazing film with a clever bending of traditional rules for UNDEAD films.
As recently as ZOMBIELAND,They hinted at what one needed to do to survive.
Not once did they mention that the zombies could outrun you.
Zombies may fire back or worse have a weapon that is loaded and you wont.
This brings up more questions than Zombieland did, And yet takes you on this journey of who do you trust or Who isn't going to eat you.
The only characters we cared about was the hitman and his wacko model of a girlfriend.",1310601600,,513,4.410526315789474
