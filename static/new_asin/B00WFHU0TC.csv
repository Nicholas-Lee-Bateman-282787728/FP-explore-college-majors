7131509,3,B00WFHU0TC,"This is a low budget crime/drama/mystery. Travis (Kendrick Cross) working as a carrier loses his cargo to a crooked policeman at a checkpoint. Bear (Preston Pratt III) wants his ""50 stacks"" from Travis and gives him a couple of days to come up with the cash. It isn't long before Travis and his family are killed and the money is gone. Bear becomes the main suspect i.e. ""probable cause.""

The film has low quality sound that has a slight echo noise when shot inside a small room. You don't get to see any real action scenes, most of the film consists of drama, i.e. conversations that take place inside a room. The camera does pan some of the streets of Atlanta. The acting and story was a notch above most Atlanta low budget films.

Guide: F-bomb, brief sex. No nudity.",1439596800,3,771,4.5

8713075,5,B00WFHU0TC,"The movie was great to me!! Any movie with African Americans working hard to make a great story into a movie is alright with me.  The production was not all that great and the camera panned from one scene to the other but I really, really loved the story line. If an Entertainment Corporation such as Lions Gate or another major Entertainment Company would have supported this movie it would have been a box office hit. The only thing these movies that are considered low budget need is support!!!! Once again I loved the movie!!!",1448755200,,530,4.578947368421052
