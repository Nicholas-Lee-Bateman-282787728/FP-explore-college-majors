7983779,3,B00008G97N,"I was a little disappointed in this video.  It doesn't offer anything new concerning our fights for freedom and independence.  And despite the video's claim that the revolution evolved from a social evolution of the 1770s, most historians I know would say that Americans began rebelling against British rule after the end of the French-Indian wars, if not sooner, because of Britain's insistence that the American colonies pay their share of taxes to the crown for helping them fight the French.  The colonists didn't see it that way.

Although this video may be helpful for a middle-school history class, I'd skip it and recommend a more detailed video on the American revolution instead.  The history channel's own video on the revolution is quite detailed (despite cheesy reenactments).

Rent this from the library but I'd discourage anyone from buying this superficial coverage of our early American history.",1254787200,,912,5.212328767123288

7983781,2,B00008G97N,"I found this video contained not even the basics that was covered in 6th grade American history in public school. It has lots of star power; Katie Couric, George & Laura Bush, Chevy Chase, Whoopie Goldberg, Brad Pitt, Richard Gere, Robert Redford...the list goes on and on.

But very limited substance.

It would be a fair choice for someone from another country that hasn't been exposed to American history in school, but only fair.

For more in-depth content, I suggest the Ken Burns PBS Civil War series and the History Channel Civil War Journal as much much better alternatives. I don't know for sure, but I'm sure other History Channel and similar productions have terrific content on the American Revolution. In fact I'm here right now to seek some out!

Fighting for Freedom: Revolutionary & Civil War is only a couple of hours long, so not much can be expected from it.",1172620800,,877,4.75
