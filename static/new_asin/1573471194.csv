192193,5,1573471194,"Six average teenagers, going about their normal lives, are suddenly seized by a mysterious compulsion and find themselves drawn, against their will to a forgotten cemetery watched over by an ancient stone idol-a Totem featuring The Three Masters of Death. As the deadly night unfolds, they soon realize they have been chosen to be part of a terrifying ritual-three destined to be Killers and three to be Victims-the unholy sacrifices that will awaken the sleeping Masters, and bring the Dead of the World back to hideous life.",1024531200,,526,5.057471264367816

192197,1,1573471194,"...for watching this total garbage!  I love Full Moon movies, but this wasn't good at all.  Beyond chessy special effect, you could see all the wires and such that operated the Totems....Horrible acting by a bunch  of no name actors, all of which this is the only thing they have ever been  in.....Except jason faunt, he was beheaded in the beginning of  Witchouse.....That is a good movie, check that one out.  This was a very  short, like 65 mins movie, no basis or plot development behind it...Full  moon really has something  with puppets...i mean really, just stay with the  puppet master movies!  Watch this if you are a full moon fan, but don't  except anything!",958435200,2,669,4.721739130434782
192198,1,1573471194,This is one of those cheesy DEADALIVE productions that look like they were made by your brother and his friends after he got his first cam corder.  Basically standard issue and as predictable as an iceburg with the  Tittanic.  A group find themselves victimized by Totem pole that comes  alive.  Which is more than you can say for the movie.  You find yourself  wishing that you could have been first to die so you don't have to stay for  the whole film.,951091200,,454,4.451219512195122
192199,1,1573471194,"This one isn't very good. I thought that the acting was VERY bad, the special effects were VERY bad, and the suspense was VERY bad. The movie is barely an hour long. I guess I too would have been in a hurry to get it  over with.",950832000,,228,3.851063829787234
7798269,1,1573471194,"TOTEM (1999) is a FULL MOON production, about a group of six young strangers (three male, three female), who find themselves together in a remote cabin. They have no idea how they got there, or why. The area around the cabin is surrounded by a sort of force field, keeping them penned inside. When they happen upon an ancient cemetery, they discover the relic of the title. Of course, problems begin. Since this is a Charles Band story, the hideous, tiny creatures on the totem spring to life, causing mayhem. The rest is like a god-awfully dull,  dunderheaded version of THE EVIL DEAD. Due to insipid dialogue and insufferable characters, we can't wait for these people to be annihilated by this supernatural horror! There is a ""deep"" mystical reason for the occurrences, but with people this annoyingly stupid, who really cares?! Just watch them die. The diminutive demons are no help either, as they are only capable of causing fits of eye-rolling and / or giggles. Hardcore lovers of Band's PUPPET MASTER films should enjoy this. Others may be tempted to throw heavy objects at their viewing screens...  P.S.- The deadening effects of this movie are akin to those derived by knocking yourself senseless w/ a rubber mallet...",1505692800,3,1228,4.899038461538462

7798271,1,1573471194,"After seeing this film on a streaming service with a running time of only 68 minutes, I was curious to see the 80-minute version. Since it was very cheap on Amazon Marketplace, I picked up a copy of the Full Moon release, which is supposed to be the 80-minute version, and is even listed as ""approximately 80 minutes"" on the back of the cover. Not the case. The Full moon DVD is also the 68 minute version of the film. It appears the 80-minute version either doesn't exist or has never been released on DVD.",1497916800,,507,4.347368421052631

7798276,1,1573471194,"This Full Moon film is pretty lame.  For a while you had an idea what to expect from Full Moon but this one is definitely below par for them.

Six young people are mysteriously drawn to an old farmhouse.  The first five determine that they can not leave.  But once the sixth arrives they can traipse off to a hidden cemetery.  There they find a strange statue of three strange creatures.  For some reason they all think it looks like a totem pole and not three boxes stacked up.

As the story unfolds, they discover that half of them are supposed to kill the other half.  Each death will animate one of the creatures.  That is unless they can find a way to thwart the powers controlling them.

The people in the film are like any other group of teens, except they act decidedly urban although they are supposedly from the surrounding countryside.  The tallest has a European accent but is obviously Native American (obvious to the other characters, that is).  He can understand ancient dialects.  The creatures barely move and are some of the worst effects I have seen in ages.  The ending is abrupt and poorly explained.  The DVD itself is bare bones.  The menu has two option, Play and Trailers (5 movies including Totem).  This is definitely the worst movie I have seen from Full Moon and those who missed it didn't miss anything.",1107734400,8,1333,4.556962025316456
7798277,1,1573471194,"...is that it flat out sucks. I mean I love bad B rated movies, but this is not one of those so bad it's good, or so bad it's entertaining, this movie is so bad it sucks sucks sucks.

The acting is atrocious even on this level. The directing was awful. The camera angles and shots for the little demons was so bad that the little buggers got boring every time they were on the screen. You just wait for this movie to be over and if you make it to the end, well you basiclly accomplished wasting your time. You can't even tell your friends you watched this the whole way through, because they've never heard of it. If they have heard of it, they'll think you're too lazy to shut off the TV.

The gist of it in a nutshell is this. Six strangers are summoned to a cabin in the middle of nowhere. There is an 'invisible force wall' keeping them within the grounds of the cabin. They discover a graveyard with a granite totem pole with three ugly and incredibly stupid looking imps. There is an Indian among the six that knows nothing about Indians, but yet he can translate the mumbling of a girl who got a hatchette to the chest. Follow me on this, you just have to watch it.

So three must be a killer and three must be a victim. Over and over and over again we are told that the totem devils control their movements. So a guy kills a girl, then a girl kills a guy, this leaves the Indian dude and the best looking of the three females. The killers are dragged out of the cabin by demons.

The anti-climax is stupid and if you've made it this far, you are bored to tears by now and are praying for the ending. So the victims now kill their killers and the Indian dude doesn't kill the chick he was supposed to kill.

Not the zombies coming out of the ground. Aren't you supposed to bury someone six feet deep? The demons rise out of six inches of dirt. They have no purpose in the story, but then again you really won't care.

This movie is a waste of time, effort, and should never have existed. I will never see this again no matter what and I hope this has warned enough people to do something constructive with an hour and 15 minutes instead of watching this.

Once again I just have to say, this sucks.",1104192000,6,2205,4.161971830985915
7798278,3,1573471194,"I thought the acting was good in this movie, especially that of Jason Faunt and Marissa Tait. But the story itself was a lousy one...perhaps the killings, etc. would have worked had the pacing been better. But at times it was too rushed, or too slow, so it didn't really work out well.
If you like one of the actors, get it...it's always fun to look at them in different roles (try checking out Jason Faunt as a Power Ranger and compare him to this). But if you're looking for a good horror movie...don't get it.",1072483200,2,512,4.34375
