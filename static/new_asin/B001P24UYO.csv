Again All that have created this masterpiece used the proper atmosphere, mood, lighting, direction and dialogue that kept one going. I have never tired of it, having it on video which finally wore out. Evil is made with the faces, expressions and implied doom, not just cheap catsup thrown in for gore. I play this every Halloween to get me in the mood!",1420761600,2,408,4.527027027027027

8331850,1,B001P24UYO,"This ""remastered edition"" is total b---t. It was made at home but not original DVD. My fault I didn't check it carefully when was ordering. As result my husband was really frustrated. And by the way it was not even cheap.",1336694400,,221,4.414634146341464
8331851,1,B001P24UYO,"I received this DVD as a birthday present that I had listed on my wish list.
It claims to be Remastered, but I couldn't believe my eyes. The movie was completely distorted
in imagery and in some sections I notice audio and video was out of synch. I am totally shocked
that this DVD could even be sold. I did not look at the review for this ""Remastered"" version before
I put in on my wish list, and now I'm sorry I didn't. The case that the DVD was in was even cracked on the side. What a waste of money! As I can only place it where it deservingly belongs...in the garbage can. If I had purchased it myself I would have sent
it back to Amazon. My niece purchased it and she then gift wrapped it herself and sent it to me with other DVD's as a present. As she is in Texas, and I am in Nevada..it's just too much of a hassel
to ship it back to her and then she ship it back to Amazon. She did not include the shipping and return slip, so I would have to send it back to her. I recommend Amazon not sell this version
at all and stay away from DVD's comming from this distributor. As you have to rate giving at least 1 star..my rating is actually a negative five stars!",1275091200,4,1165,3.982905982905983
8331852,1,B001P24UYO,"Can I leave zero stars? I've never written a review, but felt compelled this time. Someone is looking to make some money by using the word ""Remastered"" in the description of this DVD. The thing barely played in my DVD player. All sorts of strange distortions. I really felt ripped off. Sent it back and am waiting for refund. Get the 2001 VCI Entertainment version of this fascinating (sometimes corny) film. There was never a need for this version, except to put some money in someone's pocket. AVOID THIS VERSION!",1257033600,9,515,4.733333333333333
