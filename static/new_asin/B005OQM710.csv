8481682,4,B005OQM710,"very good to have in the background.  there are several choices of audio to play along with the video.  i enjoy the guitar, as well as the handbells (played with piano).

this is slow moving and still shots with movement of snowfall and leaves.  can be use for meditative/contemplative moments.",1359676800,,294,4.82
8481683,2,B005OQM710,This did not look HD to me. The mts are in the distance so all you see is white. It's hard for me to even write a review on the scenery because its so unremarkable. The music is really bad and there is no option for nature sounds like other dvds of this kind. I'm returning this one tommorow.,1358812800,,292,3.9661016949152543
