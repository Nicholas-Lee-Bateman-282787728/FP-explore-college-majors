1288809,1,B00003CXTC,"I saw this movie originally in one of those cheap theaters where all the semi-old movies go.  I don't think there was a dry eye in the house, everyone was laughing their collective [rears] off at this movie's horrible editing and lack of...well...movie.  Let's start off -- any movie with LL Cool J (with the exception of Any Given Sunday) automatically sucks.  Add to that Chris Klein (who was decent in American Pie and excellent in Election), who just isn't cut out for action roles.  Instead of droning on, I'm going to list the best parts of the movie:
  (1) Infamous night vision scene where LL and Klein are being chased around by evil dudes, for NO APPARENT REASON.  Looks like it's being filmed on VHS.  All of a sudden they drive through a barb wire fence and the ""BOOOIIINNNGG"" sound effect (like in old cartoons) is played.  This was the highlight of the movie.
  (2) Amazing editing, where someone will be turning their head or walking, and then all of a sudden appear somewhere else.  rock and roll!
  (3) Pink's ""Acting Debut""...except for the fact that she only appeared on a tv in the background of one scene for one second, lip synching to a song that wasn't even hers...I think it was a Rob Zombie song or something
  (4) Rebecca Romajin Stamos:  her fake ...russian accent is hilarious, as is her scene where she's lifting weights topless, FOR NO REASON. apparently chicks do that all the time.  Also, her final line in the movie is classic.  I won't spoil it for you.
In summary, check out this movie...I haven't watched the DVD version yet but if it's unchanged from it's theatrical counterpart, then you're in for an excellent unintentional comedy.  I can't wait to see the deleted scenes in this movie...if they [were] even WORSE than the actual movie itself, then I won't know what to do with myself.  This is one of those movies where it's so bad that it's entertaining (like Fast and the Furious, only worse!)",1024358400,2,1936,4.618768328445748
1288810,1,B00003CXTC,"I hate this movie. It's one of the worst things I have ever seen. I guess they couldn't afford good lighting because of the nightvision scene. Terrible. I thought I was watching some secret covert operation with Chris Klein and LL Cool J riding on a motorcycle. Talk about trash, the camera work is so bad, you never know what is going on and why care? ""Rollerball"" is the most popular 'sport' in the world and they go in circles on rollerblades and motorcycles. Talk about excitement. You would think director John McTiernan who made ""Die Hard"" and ""Predator,"" both excellent movies, would entertain, but no. It was funny though how Pink made a three second appearance and got billed for it. Jean Reno a.k.a. ""The Professional"" should be ashamed of himself and watch for Slipknot's performance. Nobody did as fans of the 'sport' walked right by them without giving them a glance. It was funny. I highly suggest that when you see this DVD at the store, just make a cross and hiss. It's truly evil. Avoid at all costs.",1024185600,2,1017,4.624309392265193
1288811,2,B00003CXTC,"This film was a major disappointment. I expected so much more from the director of freaking ""Die Hard"". The direction, acting, and writing were all a joke. This film left you with the feeling that it was all just thrown together, and no one took it that seriously. There were lots of things in this film that just didn't make any sense at all. Someone explain: Why was that desert chase scene filmed in night vision? WHAT IN THE HECK WAS UP WITH THAT?! The editing was choppy and scenes were just thrown together. I gave this film two stars for one reason: The skateboarding scene at the beggining was sorta cool. Thats about it.
SKIP IT. ""Rollerball"" is a loser.",1024099200,3,663,4.487603305785124
1288812,3,B00003CXTC,"Rollerball is not a great movie. Its is survived by continuous action/violence, not by the plot. How this film achieved a PG-13 rating exceeds me. It has strong violence, language, brief drug content, and sexuality. Therefor, not youth friendly. I too was disappointed with the film after watching action-packed previews. The film contained a dull storyline and bad acting. It was either destroyed in editing room or rushed for a quick release. However, the street luge scene in the beginning is one of the best sequences ive seen in awhile. Rent it before buying, it is not for everybody.",1018569600,2,589,4.959595959595959

The players are the good guys while the owners see them as nothing more than dirt. Your knee hurts your are traded or vanished. Very popular ,=Dead, if you will not conform.

1289138,5,B00003CXTC,"This remake of the classic science fiction movie is well made and modernized very well. This movie is action packed with slams, hits, and takedowns that would make a pro wrestler proud! Look for cameos from Shane McMahon and Paul Haman, the WWE/ECW legends.. LL Cool J(rapper) and Rebecca Stamos(X-Men) also star in this thriller. Rollerderby is sometimes rough and this is an actual ""sport"" that often gets VERY violent in real life. This movie is about that sport taken to a whole new level. In the near future, corporations have just as much power as the government. They hire people to compete in the violent sports they condone. Rollerderby is one of them. One young man is ""recruited"" and he becomes a fighting machine that attracts crowds, and money, everywhere! He learns that the higher ups are paying off athletes to cheat and hurt people to get ratings. Now he must ""fight the power"" to shut down the illegal sport forever! Rated R for violence, language, and nudity. Enjoy!",1459296000,,985,4.8

1289140,1,B00003CXTC,"The first time I tried watching this waste of celluloid years ago I was only able to bear the torture for about the first 1/5 of the film before I was compelled to relegate it to the darkest void of forgetfulness.

But just yesterday I read someone's review of this movie which suggested that it might be a more tolerable experience if it were viewed not as a ""remake"" but more in the manner of a ""prequel,"" thus inspiring me to grant it another and more ""openminded"" look. And it's true... rewatching this movie for a second time with the new perspective did indeed result in me changing my original opinions about the film... FOR THE WORSE!!! The only thing different about my film-watching experience this time around was that I'd somehow managed to force myself to endure through about 1/3 of the movie before finally declaring that I'd willfully tortured myself long enough, thus proving to the world that I am not a masochist.

There is NO EXCUSE for this movie, and there is no amount of molding, manipulating, twisting, or distorting of perspectives & perceptions in defense of this movie that can justify us putting on any shameless pretense that this movie is anything other than what it is, namely, ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES EVER MADE IN THE HISTORY OF CINEMA! -- and I don't say that lightly, because I'm one who has the ability to find some small redeeming sparks of merit in some of the most atrotious movies in existence (e.g. I'm the guy who actually LIKES & owns ""Laserblast,"" ""The Boogey Man,"" ""Night of the Living De3D,"" and ""Xtro""), but this ain't one of those ""bad"" movies: not even ""so bad it's good""; beyond even ""so bad it's bad""; this one deserves its own distinct classification... let's call it, ""so bad that can't we just pretend it doesn't even exist?""",1457740800,,1779,4.6265822784810124
1289141,1,B00003CXTC,"Cannot stand movies that move from tight shot to tight shot and you really can't follow the movie. Had a headache after 10 minutes. Bad accents but did not have high expectations going into it. See the original, ""Rollerball"" movie instead.",1451088000,,239,4.853658536585366

1289204,4,B00003CXTC,"I remember the original Rollerball movie, where a corporate world introduces a violent game to demonstrate the futility of individual effort, and then deal with the inevitable rise of a champion player (James Caan as Jonathon E) by trying to break and then kill him - and failing.  In this remake, the technology has improved, the spikes are gone, and the bikes are faster - with male and now female players on the track.  And the players now can customize sections of their uniforms, to make them stand out more.  Fast, ruthless, busy, and Jean Reno makes an excellent bad guy.  And for sheer spectacle, the opening sequence of the luge race into San Francisco is amazing.  The remake adheres to the broad outline set by the original, adds a few twists of its own, updates the skates to in-line versions, and is well worth a look!  Enjoy!",1437609600,,839,4.635135135135135

When my boyfriend got me to watch this I thought it was gonna be not so good but when I watched I liked it. I would totally watch that sport on TV if it was real. I'd probably even play it maybe. Lol. For real though. I thought it was a good movie with a story line that I liked, a hard core sport, good music, and some pretty good action. Normally I don't like sports movies or sports in general. But this one as I said seemed like a cool sport. I liked this movie and think others will too.

It is obvious that someone here is far more interested in Roller Derby than they are in producing a good movie.  I like cerebral fiction.  I like dystopian fiction.

A few weeks ago I watched the 2002 film. Actually, the film was on late so I recorded it. I noticed it had McTierney as director so I thought it might be worth a look. I got through the opening sequence with the body-boarding and thought to myself - this does not look promising. After watching the first few minutes of the Rollerball game I realised this was not going to get any better so that was it - deleted without any further viewing.

Sky TV have recently been showing the 1975 original and it is STILL a significant film. In fact, the film's violence seems much more real along with a chilling message about our society.

Hollywood - if you are to make a film that is a ""remake""..?? is this this the best that you have to offer? Remakes are never easy I guess but Cohen Bros. managed a pretty good result with ""True Grit""

The most obvious problem is that instead of focusing around actual rollerball tournaments and, according to the description, fast-paced action, the entire film is basically a huge party atmosphere with younger people doing absolutely nothing at *all* but standing around laughing and drinking.  The entire rollerball aspect isn't even noticeable, and had I not known the name of the movie and just turned it on, it never would have occurred to me it's even SUPPOSED to be about rollerball.  That's a dead giveaway something is seriously wrong.

The evil side of me wanted to see the people riding down the highways to actually get hit by one of the many vehicles because at least going to the hospital would have provided a more enticing concept than whatever kind of crap the writers were attempting here.

There is no storyline whatsoever.  It's completely missing.  If it's there I sure as heck couldn't find it.  What a terrible waste of my time.

1289639,2,B00003CXTC,"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has a fascinating career slump, dating the origins of its downfall for many years.  The company used to be the king of producing movies, or at least it and Warner Bros. saw eye-to-eye, but the trouble began once Ted Turner bought the majority of the MGM library in the mid-1980s.  And then in the mid-90s, MGM started heading down the quality crapper with the release of ""Showgirls"", a movie I personally thought was enjoyable but I had to acknowledge the critical lashing the film had.  From then on, it kept a consistent record of producing below-average movies, with very few non-UA movies worth praising; not even the recent James Bond movies (sans ""Casino Royale"") helped them with their downward slope.  As of now, the once-roaring studio is in financial trouble and in danger of being bankrupt (despite being sold to multiple companies), so what films did it accomplish in recent years?  ""Soul Plane"", ""College"", ""The Mod Squad"", ""Sleep Over"", ""Good Boy"", ""Jiminy Glick in Lalawood"", ""Fame"" remake...and this movie, ""Rollerball"".  What can I say, at least they had ""Barbershop"".

I'm on the defense to say this isn't&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-worst-of-the-worst/dp/B0002J4YVK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the worst of the worst</a>, but if this movie expected for me to accept a dystopian world where corrupt businessmen are using this sport as a global-televised sensation, then it had another thing coming.  It's glorified roller derby, for goodness sake, and the way it was set-up is impractical.  This sport had a pretty small field of play, no bigger than a regular skating rink.  Since many players had to fill in the stage, it would be pretty cluttered to watch and to experience, and this sport is suppose to include skateboarders AND motorcyclists. Do you know how crazy is it to ride a motorcycle in a small area surrounded by other players? There's no way one can drive fast and maneuver around the field without running over the majority of players; although logic like that seem dismissible in this film since one biker manage to run over a player and he didn't get seriously injured.  And what are the rules of this game, besides hitting a metal ball at a goalpost?  The film's final act decided not to have any rules, but I didn't know what the rules were to begin with; the chubby announcer in the film hadn't any idea what to make of this sport either.

Even if I'm just humoring the premise, I can't deal with the film taking obnoxious lengths to be edgy.  For this movie to be edgy, every character has to be cocky and insulting each other (this is par for every sport, though),  they have to wear spikes and other ridiculous get-ups (with the girls wearing dominatrix attire),  the largely heavy metal soundtrack had to blast Slipknot and Rob Zombie whenever it can, and there has to be lots of jump cuts whenever the action occurs.  It tried too hard to be extreme that the film reached the point of pretentiousness.

And then there's the plot, which has ""The Running Man"" written all over it.  Chris Klein is the lead hot-shot, LL Cool J is the black partner, and Rebecca Romijn is the fanservice; they're part of an elite team of the popular sport, which is controlled by Jean Reno, and once they know how corrupt the sport is, they planned to fight their way out.  The lack of any exposition is what nearly destroyed this movie.  Somehow, everyone knows what's going on and where to go at particular moments without being told, so a lot of events just happened out of change.  There's too many characters and the film didn't bother to establish most of them, and often times it pulled random conveniences out of its edgy behind (i.e., how that one character manages to steal the locker key off of some other character without showing it).

The convoluted, inexplicable plot and the obnoxious hardcore attitude about itself made ""Rollerball"" almost unenjoyable.  I say 'almost', because I admit in enjoying the climax of the film, which had some tension and it wasn't boring (plus, I have a thing for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/uprising/dp/B0002JP2OI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">uprising</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/conclusions/dp/B000N6TX1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">conclusions</a>); plus, the whole desert sequence shot in night-vision was certainly new, if a bit of an odd design choice.

No enters Chris Klein's character that soon becomes a new hero of the circuit, but he realizes that some heinous plot is going on when one of his teammates got heavily injured by receiving a big iron ball in the face.

Well, that is the film's story, sort of. Actually, nothing really makes sense in those badly edited ""game scenes"" where players are seen hitting each other rollerskating, and motorcycles with howling engines stumbling on the rink (and one of the riders is beautiful Rebecca Romijn-Stamos from ""X-Men"" but you cannot recognize her ... again.) To be honest, I had no idea of what is going on and I'm afraid you won't either. Rules? Sorry, I thought there was an introductory part about them, but I stopped caring as the film got more and more incredible.

The original ""Rollerball"" a cult film by Norman Jewison, knew what it wanted by drawing the bleak vision of our near future and its actions are still refreshing and exciting to see. But this remake most unaccountably ignores the tone of the original's futuristic society and stays content just showing meaninglessly violent stunts. The film remains pointless throughout I thought as it has no drama not even a decent story and no character. The game scenes look terribly bland. In fact they look dull compared with what we can see on some cable TV programs.

To be fair, there are some good action scenes like opening skateboarding race or bike chasing in the midnight. But strangely they have virtually nothing to with the premise of the film, game of the title. Chris Klein is good and Jean Reno is just OK, but the latter's charisma seen in such great films as ""The Professional"" cannot be found here.

1289707,1,B00003CXTC,"The original Rolerball and this 2002 remake have recently been making the rounds on cable-TV. Simply, putting sequel up against the original is like comparing the XFL to the NFL.

The remake is simply dreadful, with a poor script, equally poor casting and a gimmicky figure-eight track with tunnels & sidetracks which is played on rollerblades - with other team members on motorcycles - and goals scored with the metal ball. Based in central Asia, the game becomes increasingly violent to boost TV ratings - especially in America - and to make for  growing fan interest.

It takes the anticorporate stance of Jonathon E and morphs him into outlaw exteme sports lover Jonathon Cross (Chris Klein), who ultimately leads the players and fans in a revolt against the senseless violence pushed by sport founder Alexi Petrovich (Jean Reno) and the networks. Sounds like a bad WWE storyline, and that may be why motormouth Paul Heyman is the ""announcer"" for the games. I was waiting for Heyman to belt out, ""It's Extreme,"" several hundred times.

Put LL Cool J, who plays an old friend of Cross and the person who gets him involved in the game, in the lead role and he may have saved the character from being absolutely unbelievebale. Perhaps putting Heyman as the evil entrepreneur may have made for a more sinister Petrovich.

And slowing the cinema-photography down from its rapid cuts may have forced editors to let the story speak volumes like the original. But in the end, Rollerball is a poor attempt in updating a movie that didn't need it.",1165276800,2,1541,4.821969696969697
1289708,1,B00003CXTC,"Rollerball.  In the original film, the game attempted to stand as an outlet of Corporation superiority; constantly demonstrating to the consumers (the people) that individuality is futile.  Apparently, one does not have to either read the screenplay or physically watch the original film for there to be a remake.  Decent director John McTiernan, who ""wow-ed"" me with such films as the remake of The Thomas Crown Affair as well as his early cult hits like Die Hard and Predator has obviously lost his ability to either A) do remakes or B) handle a camera with any sense of decency.  If I was allowed one question to have answered through the course of my life, my question would be, ""What was the point of Rollerball the remake?"", and I do believe there would be answer from any higher authority.  This film single handedly goes down in the record books as not just the worst remake to come out of Hollywood, but it is also a double threat, with it being in the top 100 of worst films ever conceived.  It is embarrassing to say, but it has to be said, that Rollerball is one of a few select films that demonstrated no ability in the fields of direction, acting, cinematography, or writing.  If Rollerball were deemed a student paper, it would have failed all four parts.  Nothing, I repeat, nothing of value can be found with this film, and I even tried hard, but one must easily look at this film and simply state, ""It failed"".

As I look at the description for this film through many web sites, I happen to notice that many times this film is classified as a ""science fiction"" film, which boggles my mind.  There was absolutely nothing science fiction about this film outside of the possibility of the actual Rollerball game being a rather sci-fi-esque type game, but when you look at it, there is nothing special about the sport.  The 1975 film version was extremely science fiction with its views on the future of our world, the surrounding environment, as well as subtly placed usage of the laser gun.  Yet somehow, this 2002 version is able to call itself a ""science fiction"" merely on the premise that it takes place three years in the future.  Three. Whole. Years.  That to me is the staple of why this film corrupted from the inside out.  The writing was atrocious to say the least.  It felt as if the writers of this film, one Larry Ferguson or one John Pogue (odd, this horrid smelling filth of a film took two of Hollywood's scribes ... ouchers!), took random ideas, threw them together and attempted to create continuity in the course of 97 minutes.  No doubtably procrastination was an issue, and to cut corners to meet a deadline these avid writers chose to cut characters, huge plot points, and any sort of solid stream of consciousness to create possibly the worst that Hollywood could ever offer.  Nothing, in the form of script, plot, or action/adventure is worth mentioning in this film.  I had difficulty enjoying the first one and it was a symbolic mess about the corporate hold on its consumers, while this filth had nothing to do with ... nothing.  Words came out of the actor's mouths, but they meant nothing, they stood for nothing, and half the time it just had me laughing due to the staged words that they were dealt.  Again, there was no value in this film.

Chris Klein has ridden the shirt tales of American Pie for a very long time (I always saw him as the Weakest Link of those films), so he decided to take a leading man's role in Rollerball in hopes that he could transform his career into a leading man, but you can't make cardboard stand on his own.  Could Chris have attempted to grow a backbone for this film ... is that possible?  The words that came out of his mouth had no emotion; he was together with Rebecca Romijn-Stamos for purely the physical admiration, and someone needs to tell him that by squinting his eyes harder doesn't indicate that he is upset or angry.  I cannot seem to shake the image of him riding with L.L. Cool J in the Russian night on a motorcycle using ""night vision"" for dramatic purposes, and Klein speaking unattached words out of my mind.  It was hilarity on a grand scale.  I remember the pair talking about something, but the laughter coming from my mouth was far more overpowering.  Nothing (which seems to be the common theme of this film) is of value in this film.  Klein proved that on more than one occasion.  That isn't to say that those like LL, Jean Reno, Stamos, or even my favorite Naveen Andrews were any better.  Klein led the pact with kindergarten acting skills, but Reno was completely over the top, which caused confusion as to who he was and why he was involved financially, Andrews was nothing more than filler, Stamos was used for the nudity ... that was all, and LL kept the ""hip-ness"" factor on a grander scale.  Nobody demonstrated anything close to talent in this film and it ultimately boils down to the failure of decent director John McTiernan.

Rollerball is one of those films that gives remakes a horrid name.  Even if the original wasn't worth writing home to mother about, films of this stature only place a black scar on the future of remakes.  I have to be worried about McTiernan because of my enjoyment of some of his past films and how anyone could see the final cut of this film and say, ""This is my best work yet!""  If you cannot say those words as you hand the final reel to the distribution company, I would reconsider the release.  Writing was far worse that imaginable, the acting was nowhere to be seen, and the cinematography (something I didn't feel like going into too deeply with this review) felt as if it was done by those who are afraid of camera.  Honestly, I have seen better amateur work than what Rollerball had to offer.  Why is this film still being distributed?  This is a very dark cloud amongst the Hollywood types and am very surprised to see that everyone is still able to acquire roles in Tinsel town after this disaster.  My only wish is that future directors and actors actually take pride in their work instead of just allowing the paycheck to do the talking.

At least for me, there are moments in life that redefine pain and pleasure.  A point that you can use to envy or be thankful for.  Like if you won the lottery.  I'm sure that every good thing that happened to you from then on would be slightly paler in comparison.  You might get a free bun from cinabon and think, ""Mmmm, this is a good bun...but it's not as good as that one time I won the lottery.

Rollerball is the opposite of winning the lottery.  If the lottery was where once a year someone was picked to get puched in the face on world-wide television, and one year it happened to be you, the feeling you would get of dread and unjustice would be close to how it feels to watch Rollerball.

1289763,4,B00003CXTC,"... but, gentle reader, I believe this movie is not the horror that the previous few reviewers thought it would be.

To begin, John McTiernan doesn't faithfully redo classics.  Instead, he changes them into a modern action film with modern concepts and modern values, and almost always with better than average, and often exceptional, characters.  Think of the aforementioned ""Thomas Crowne Affair"": its plot had very little to do with the Norman Jewison version (oh, gee, who directed the 1975 version of ""Rollerball""?  I forget...).  However, very similar sensibilities are there in the 1999 version.

Hmm...

FADE IN: Studio exec is trying to figure out what to do about his next production.  Suddenly a lightbulb goes on over his head:

  STUDIO EXEC

  (to SECRETARY, O.S.)

  Call John McTiernan!  Have him redo another

  Normal Jewison film.  What else has that geezer

  done?! (rifling through old DGA directory) (Beat)

  Rollerball!!  Perfect!!  Violence, fast-paced, slinky

  girls, lots of stunts, loud music!  Perfect!

Maybe...  Anyway, we now return to our original review.

So when McT, as he refers to himself on other commentaries (one of my major disappointments about this so-called special edition is the lack of a McTiernan wry, dry, and ever so enjoyable commentary), brings in the sensibilities of the original version, but addresses the subject in a more 2000-friendly way (i.e., ratings, and the immediacy of the decisions), he is shouted down because he didn't do what someone with a pre-conceived notion about what the remake ""should"" be expected.

Pardon the expression, but to borrow from good ol' Colonel Potter (and the writers of M*A*S*H), this is a bunch of ""horse feathers.""  The film has an excellent pace, an engaging, lively soundtrack, and fun action.  OK, so Chris Klein and Rebecca Romijn aren't Tracy and Hepburn, but this is the first role I've seen Chris Klein in where he has an edge.  He actually looks not like the puppy he normally looks, but someone who, when driven to it, can kill.  And I credit McTiernan with bringing that out of him.

Overall, yes, this is not an Oscar-winning weaper for which Merryl could win an Oscar because she learned another accent, but as far as summer entertainment, I'd say it's superior to most.",1113264000,9,2280,5.016129032258065

All the time thinking, it can't be this bad, it has got to get better. It is that bad, and it never got better. Other than the title, and some aspects of the game, nothing in common witht he original book. Very little in common with the first movie. James Caan vs. who ever he was. No contest Caan. Even Jean Reno is wasted in this mess. Poorly scripted, poorly acted, poorlly shot, poorly edited.  And loud, I mean Loud, you know LOUD.

1289765,1,B00003CXTC,"*SO* many other people have written about how awful this movie is, so what's another voice thrown into the fray?

Here is why I rented it: I love John McTiernan movies.

I got the special edition of ""Predator"" for Christmas and enjoyed the commentary; especially when McTiernan says that he just likes to make popcorn movies that people enjoy (cases in point: ""Die Hard"" and ""Predator""). Now, granted these two movies are pure popcorn, no one can deny that they are also great action movies that completely incorporate characterization and action.

So, for this reason, and the great cast including Jean Reno (who rocked out in ""Ronin"") and even Naveen Andrews (anybody recognize him as the sikh from ""The English Patient"" other than me?), I plopped down my rental fee and took the movie home.

They owe me two hours of my young life back!

*SO* many things are horrifically wrong with this movie, I'll just describe my biggest beef about it: there is about a 20 minute sequence--which, unfortunately, is essential to the pithy plot-- which was shot in NIGHTVISION; all grainy and green. I have *no* idea what was going on in McTiernan's head, I don't want to know.

I have never seen the original, but as I understand it the original story takes place in the future, which would at least be more appropriate. As a student of Russian history I take *MAJOR* issue with the producers and the director keeping it in contemporary times and just putting it half way around the world. It all seemed disjointed and forced and lame.

There should definately be an option on this reviewer system for NO STARS, I feel guilty dignifying it with one.",1107388800,2,1638,4.726315789473684
1289766,2,B00003CXTC,"This tedious and unnecessary remake of the 1975 James Caan classic has little to recommend it.  Director John McTiernan, who did so well with DIE HARD, blasts us with heavy metal rock garbage throughout the entire movie, action scenes that are incomprehensible and lifeless, and a cast that fizzles from the start.  Chris Klein's good looks don't help his vapid, uninspired performance; LL Cool J is surprisingly uneffective; Rebecca Stamjin-Stamos does better in blue make-up in the X Men flicks; Jean Reno is laughably miscast as the Russian owner.

McTiernan also films one lengthy chase scene in what appears to be night vision goggles; green of all things.  It makes no creative sense and adds nothing to the overall movie.

Remakes like this add further validity to the fact that if you're going to remake a movie, either make it as good or better, or let us savor the originals.",1092009600,3,885,4.873333333333333
1289767,1,B00003CXTC,"If all you are after is some digital candy, then this movie might suffice.  Sure there was some political maneuvering, some behind-the-back action, but mostly this movie is about a hockey player who went for the cash in a eurasian version of hyped up roller derby instead of going to the NHL.
The whole movie is based on the fact that TV ratings zoom up as players die.
This show was so unsatisfying for me that I kept hitting the fast forward button just to get through it!
I hesitate to say that this movie is a pale version of ""Rollerball"" staring Caan.  Now THAT was a movie.  If you are going to watch one ""Rollerball"" go with the version starring James Caan - THAT version has some real character development, some meaningful futuristic political intrigue, and the game is more believable, as is the action, than the new version.  Caan's Rollerball is a sport with rules you can follow, and you can see when they are broken, too.
Whatever you choose to do...good luck.

1289768,1,B00003CXTC,"Most of the classic science-fiction, horror movies of the late sixties/mid-seventies were message movies: They were parables, allegorical yarns influencing us to confront the fallacies of our society.
""Silent Running"", ""Planet of The Apes"", ""Omega Man"", ""Soilent Green"", ""Night of The Living Dead"", ""Logan's Run""; each of these movies touched on the negative trends of contemporary society, be it racism, crass-consumerism, generational gaps, ecological suicide... In short, Man's inhumanity to Man.
The original ""Rollerball"" showed us the global corporate culture of the near future. It threw society's sick obsession with both sports and violence right at our faces. The bloodlust that was in the fictional future's rollerball audience was only slightly little different from the real life demands young white men were making at that time of the then emerging sport of Ice Hockey.
The age of the Nation-State was over and the multinational corporation, who was the new totalitarian aggroprop motivator, was now ascendent. We no longer had to worry about ideologues but PR men telling you what, when and where to buy. Control through the supply and demand for consumer goods and pastimes.
Humankind still had an aggression complex: a need for one man to hurt -and yes even kill!- his fellow man. How does the Multinational Global Corporations contain, yet satisfy, this bloodlust (and at the same time further stupify an already flabby, dumbed-down populace)? ROLLERBALL. All the fastpaced, adrenaline inducing, death and maiming and scarring of WAR, shrunken down and sealed up into a tiny arena, starting and ending at precise times.
Sad. Hateful. However, like all those aforementioned movies did, showing a reflection of us: Modern, secular, selfish, self-gratifying Humanity.
2002's ""Rollerball"" instead of updating and furthering this warning/message, is rather just another example and prop of our malaise as a immature, gratification addicted species. No true message. Just bright lights, loud noise, hitech special effects and shallowness. The writers and artists have become just as negative and selfish as the lumpen.
It is because of movies such as this that I was putoff when I heard that there was talk of making remakes of ""Logan's Run"" and ""Omega Man"". When the respective stars being considered for these intended remakes are Leonardo Di Caprio and Arnold Schwartzenneger I easily imagine Hollywood rendering these beloved classics into meaningless, mindless action/thriller schlock and junk. All shoot-em-ups, chases, and silly  countdowns to explosive fireworks. Leaving no commitment or involvement from the theatre audience but laughter and cheers. No reflections. No introspections. No learning. No morality.
Hollywood, please leave the films of a better, more compassionate, more intelligent era alone. You can satisfy the mob you pander to without remakes. Thin plots, involving one-dimensional characters, speeding through long scenes of T&A, mindless violence and numbing special effects will more than satisfy your market and bring in all the revenue you lust for. Desecrating art is not necessary.",1082851200,27,3126,5.539748953974895
1289769,1,B00003CXTC,"Rollerball still stands as a solid sci-fi flick about the fear of corporate society and the crushing of the little guy (you).  Sadly, if you look around, we're slowly approaching it.
Fast forward to now and we have yet another remake.  With Rollerball (2002) I am now convinced that these remakes serve a functional purpose: to make the originals look like masterpieces.  If there is another reason, I've yet to see it.  At this point, I would be less insulted if Hollywood studios publicly declared: We have no ideas, we are bankrupt of original thoughts, so we'll just resell you the same thing, over and over.
The sickest thing about John McTiernan's Rollerball remake is that it had potential.  The original film took place in a sterilized future world where corporations had taken the place of nations, society had everything it needed, and the main distraction for the pesty public was the ultraviolent sport of rollerball.  Jonathan E began to meddle by somehow surviving the sport year after year and began to shine, which is exactly what the corporations did NOT want.  The sport was to prove the futility of individual effort.
In the remake, the setting is the near future, but the concerns are not global like the original.  Rollerball is more a fringe sport (like Slamball, or Arena Football, or backyard wrestling) operating out of central Asia (any of the '-stan' countries of the old Soviet empire.)  For the miserable masses who slave in mines, the sport, which is less coherent here than the original film, provides a distraction from their meaningless lives (sort of like all sports do, anyway.)
I did like this idea for the setting, making rollerball a regional interest rather than global phenomenon.  It actually makes it more realistic, and indeed there are references to WWE wrestling, which it resembles in the glitzy pageantry and shameless profiteering.  This, along with other elements, are wasted in the ensuing chaos.
An NHL draftee (Chris Klein, doing a career Keanu impersonation that is frightening) flees the USA because he's been busy illegally body-boarding down San Fran streets and runs off with LL Cool J to play for big money in the rollerball leauge.  The (naturally) evil team owner is Jean Reno, who covets more and more ratings by getting rid of rules, penalties, and other pesty elements of the sport that prevent people from dying.  This is all to satisfy some kind of global ratings meter that is instant and will gauge who is tuning in when.
I could go on and on about this film.  It was famously plagued during post-production (not to mention pre-production, production, and the 'idea', casting, and all other phases.)  The film is incoherent, plain and simple.  What you would call a mess.
It is highly recommended to bad movie buffs the world over.  I picked this baby up at a 2-for-$15 sale--that's less than the cost of seeing this clinker in the theater!  The DVD wisely throws in many extras to entice you and to give you something approaching value after you realize how appalling the film is.
The other recommendation is to buy the original Rollerball on DVD, also a good value.
I now heartily endorse remakes like this one, as I'm sure Norman Jewison (director of the original) does.  His film and his career shine that much brighter after atrocities like this.",1080864000,2,3318,4.86145648312611

His film, the second in his career 'remade' from Norman Jewison - after ""Thomas Crown"" - actually uses all the fashioned cliches of American action movies: all the scenes were shot and edited at 100 mph, in the MTV style (the musical background is unstandable). We have the impression to deal with a ""Fast and Furious"" on skates. The story doesn't have any slice of interest, and the too cool acting (especially LL Cool J's - 'Close your eyes and take the dough!') and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos disastrous Russian accent don't arrange anything. But what may be really shocking in this film is the presence of a woman in the games, which is really unacceptable when you see the great violence of this sport, mixing football, baseball, boxing and ice hockey, and where (maybe for the beauty of the show...) almost no blow is forbidden. There is no woman football or ice hockey league (so far...), but you can see a woman playing rollerball... look for the mistake! And McTiernan definitely turned his movie to politically correct, by locating the rollerball games in a poor country in central Asia.
Add to it this French actor, Jean Reno, who absolutely doesn't belong in here and ridiculizes himself more than anything else and you have a zero movie, one of the worse ever directed by McTiernan, maybe his worst, along with ""Medicine Man"". The advice I could give McTiernan is try to be more personal and independent, and to write screenplays of his own. What are the use and interest spending so much dough to produce things like this? The film was a big box-office failure and it's not surprising. A terrifying blunder. (Re)Watch 1975 Norman Jewison great classic instead.",1066262400,2,1944,4.8408408408408405

The PG-13 version is the only one I saw, and while I have read numerous reviews of it being incredibly violent I only have this to say: No. Yes it was violent, but in the end, it earned a PG-13 rating.

This movie is more about the trouncing of participants in the roller derby sport I used to watch on 1970's television.  So the only things in common between the two films are the name and the fact a ball rolls around a rink in a violent sport.
If one can disassociate the first film from this one, then this version can actually be fun.  In a brief synopsis, the star rollerballer in a central asian ring discovers that the league ownership is manipulating television ratings by staging violent scenes on the rink.  When he and a fellow American (played adequately by LL Cool J) decide to save their own necks by fleeing to the boarder, they are hunted down by the Russian thugs before they can make good their escape.  The inclusion of a Dutch motorcyclist, played by Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, provided the movie with a love interest.
The final game is a bit unrealistic as the wounded star, played by Chris Klein who surprisingly looks like a junior Keanu Reeves, stays alive on the rink long enough to confront his opponents in the front office.

1289928,5,B00003CXTC,"The 2002 version of Rollerball takes off with excitement from the first moment and keeps up the pace through the entire film!  It's not really fair to call this a remake of the 1975 version, which is good in its own rights.  This takes the basic premise of the Rollerball game, but instead of being set in some futuristic sci-fi world, it places the game in our current time.  Now that the Soviet Union has broken up into independent countries, men who were powerful under the Soviet government still seek to remain in power.  Rollerball team owners are incredibly powerful men - men who are not willing to give up the trappings of power.  They use their power with impunity, resorting to extortion, force, threats to accomplish their goals.
The pace can become fast and furious.  Much as if this were a real sport, the movie is cut with the style that would be appreciated by afficianados of this sort of sport - similar to the way professional wrestling is marketed.  The fast cuts, choppy action, insertion of elements such as the player's trading cards, persistent music, all help focus on the experience that the Rollerball fans would relish.
Chris Klein and L.L. Cool J are two Americans on a team based in Kazakstan (my apologies for any spelling errors).  Their team travels to compete against teams in other Central Asian countries.  When the TV ratings begin to drop, the team owners resort to any means possible to keep the ratings up.  The methods used, in light of the political situation in that area of the world, are entirely plausible and believable.  One should take note of the subtle ways that are used to control the team members.

Lead actor Chris Klein is Keanu lite, pure and simple... And it's all downhill from there, baby.

I should pause here to mention that even this low level of analysis lends this travesty too much creedence -- the script is pathetic, the acting nominal, the cinematography and direction are both quite shabby, and even the sound design is muddled and cluttered. To make things worse, if possible they write in the ""hero"" as a young, untouchable super-stud, rather than an aging jock whose skill and experience are only just barely enough to him fit for this dangerous new game.

Honestly, I wasn't feeling it after the first game of Rollerball. It pretty much lost my attention after that. It did however get my attention again when Slipknot made a cameo which was pretty cool.
The only thing I'd say Rollerball had going for it was the stars of the movie, Chris Klein, LL Cool J, Robecca Romijn-Stamos, former UFC Champ Oleg ""The Russian Bear"" Taktarov and the WWE's Paul Heyman. Other than that, very little. In my opinion, the action in the movie became less and less as the movie progressed.

The plot is pretty straight forward: Johnathon Cross, and extreme sports junkie, is persuaded by a friend to play Rollerball, a cross between soccer, rollerblading, and anything goes that's being played in Asia. He becomes the start player for his team, enjoys all the perks, including getting cozy with a fellow teammate, and then discovers that the owners of the teams are staging fights and accidents to boost ratings. His conscience kicks in, and he tries to find a way to stop it.
The special effects in the movie are nice, they scenes are patched together so it really looks like they're playing the game, flying through the air, and doing a bunch of stunts. The costumes are flashy, everyone has their own unique style, from a gladiator down to someone in a tutu. Everything is done in a flashy way, with lots of sparks or flashy lights.
The soundtrack fits the movie, there's hard rock for the games and parties and slower music for other scenes. The Rob Zombie song is well picked, it fits in with the style of the movie. What I liked best about the music is that you didn't really notice it, there weren't points that stood out and made you go ""Why on earth did they pick that piece?""
Overall I'd give it 3 stars. The first is for the music, it was appropriate. The second star is for the costumes and set design, it really made the movie more substantial, although not by much.

Aside from the rather interesting James Caan in the starring role, the flat direction by Norman Jewison and the almost laughable story guaranteed this film a place among the greatest cult films ever. Perhaps the makers of this version mistook its cult status for popularity when they imagined that this remake would appeal to today's audience. As if it was an indication of how the film would do, it was pulled from its original release date and ""retooled"" (Hollywood speak for shelved) before new trailers were made and the film was given a high profile launch earlier this year. It was all for naught, it seems, as this film couldn't be any worse. The DVD version is the R rated cut, giving teen audiences the blood and bare breasts that they missed in the PG-13 theatrical version. The slight glimpses of Rebecca Romjin-Stamos' breasts and some slight gore don't make up for what is ultimately a car wreck of a film, that fails to achieve on any level.
Chris Klein stars as Jonathan, the new superstar of Asian supersport Rollerball - the sport of near future kings - a combination of motorcross, Jai A'lai, and roller derby. With a clumsy opening credits sequence wherein an enthusiastic american announcer (played by a guy doing a Rowdy Roddy Piper goes to Pittsburgh accent) explains the rules of the game - we are introduced to our first taste of the sport. That the sport is as chaotic and violent as it is - what with motorcyles and people being hit with metal balls, etc. - it makes one wonder why anyone would bat an eyelash at people being killed during the matches. However, Chris Klein and co. become suspicious when they suspect that fatal accidents are being arranged to help boost ratings (incidentally, in this future a giant scoreboard reports the ratings numbers stock ticker style so the game's owner - played with bored detachment by Jean Reno - can immediately see how these ""accidents"" help boost the ratings. And, in another odd bit of out there movie reasoning - the second something dangerous happens in the game, these numbers jump by hundreds of millions of viewers (how such a fickle fan base manages to tune in at a moments notice is puzzling - but I digress).
As a fan of McTiernan's other films (Die Hard, Die Hard With a Vengeance, Predator, and even the Thomas Crown Affair) I expected that no matter how bad the story was, the Rollerball scenes would be well executed enough to hold my interest. After all, we never liked Die Hard for Reginald Vel Johnson - did we? Alas, it seems that John McTiernan saw the futility of the project and gave up long before shooting began. The action scenes are flashy and flat - sacrificing a well built scene in favor of the quick flash of less than impressive effects and stunt laden glitz. Its almost as if Mc Tiernan handed over control of the film to a second unit director itching to get his hands on a real film. Of course blame should be shared by cinematographer Steve Mason, whose camerawork shows that he doesn't have the imagination to shoot make believe sport films (add rollerball to the equally treacherous BASEketball of a few years back), his lensing of many scenes feels made up on the fly - and many times it doesn't work. This is espescially true of a long nighttime chase sequence shot through a green tinted lens that gives the scene the look of being filmed through night vision goggles. Equal parts distracting and headache inducing, it is one of the worst cases of a crime against cinema in recent memory.
Not that the actors do much to help the film along. Chris Klein, bless his heart, is so out of place in a film where it is required that he exhibit emotion or act like anyone other than Chris Klein. It's as if the rest of the cast and crew went along with making the film so as not to make him feel bad. I felt like a parent at a 3rd grade school play, watching someone else's kid butcher the production. Suffice it to say that when L.L. Cool J is forced to carry the film - the film is in trouble.
Rollerball is bad. It will never be revered as a piece of bad cinema to be enjoyed on the level of Showgirls or even Ernest goes to Jail. Rather, it will eventually find its way to the [price] reduction bin at [local store] - and even then its probably not a good purchase.",1028764800,4,4351,4.508860759493671

1290008,2,B00003CXTC,"Well, most of the people here are ripping this movie pretty good. One of the most glaring things that I noticed was the poor editing job; there are several instances where it looks like one of those old silent films where one minute a character is one place and another minute a character is another place. It is amazing to find that kind of thing happen these days in movies. Still, I think this movie had some potential. It was a relatively good action movie that used the corruptability of sports and ratings as its main theme. The basic premise is that in order to get ratings powerful sports organizers are willing to do anything, including sometimes brutal accidents, to achieve this. You may choose to look at this as a stab at what we do in America today (such as reality type television), or you may take it to ""glamourize"" this type of action (which I do not think the producers were trying to do). The lack of star power and script really hurts this movie, however. Also, it is overdone with a soundtrack that is seemingly never ending. I would venture to guess that half of the movie has music blaring in it during the action scenes. (It is fine to have a soundtrack, but you do not need to make the music the movie.) Overall, although this was not a good movie, I certainly do not think it was ""the worst"" movie you will ever see. Still, there are glaring problems with this movie that the average moviegoer will detect readily. For this reason, I give this movie 2 stars.",1027209600,3,1485,4.443223443223443

1290010,1,B00003CXTC,"Rollerball is a remake of a 1975 science fiction film of the same name that only succeeds in showing what the world would be like if the XFL had become the rage.  With how many problems this movie had in production, it was a surprise to see it touch theatres.
 Chris Klein, LL Cool J, and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos all phone in their roles as rollerbladers in a high stakes game that is televised worldwide.  The cookie-cutter nemesis is played by Jean Reno as the owner and general manager of the tournaments.  And with John McTiernan (director of Die Hard) at the helm, the whole thing is unexcusable.  It looks like he is well past his prime.
 In the original, the hard-core sport of Rollerball was a way for the ruling government of the world to show that individual effort was useless and futile, and only ended in death.  In this unworthy remake, the ruling corporations are replaced by managers of the game with no other motive than to get higher ratings and greater profits.
 This action disaster takes no hints from it's predecessor.  The James Caan version was timeless, using classical music to keep the movie from being dated and holding the action with a very well-done sci-fi backstory.  This is a movie filled with pop music that doesn't even fit the action and a barely-there plot that is filled with unnecessary car races and entirely unexciting action scenes.
 The game consists of rolling around a figure eight track with the help of rollerblades and teammates on motorcycles, trying to beat the other team by throwing a steel ball into a large gong.  Unlike the strategy and planning that went into the original's gameplay, this version looks like a circus.  The action is filled with slapstick falls and dubbed-in lines with the actors not even openning their mouths.  Somehow it manages to be entirely unexciting, with even the announcer looking bored and immersed on and off.  Spills look entirely unrealistic and overplayed, while music completely unfitting the action drones loudly.  Costumes look like chromed rejects from cirque de solei, with oversized helmets looking downright silly.  All in all, for a movie named after a game, no thought was put in and these are the worst parts of the movie.
 The plot jumps from here to there constantly with characters changing their standings instantly; leaving the viewer without a clue as to anyone's personality.  To bring the movie up to an R rating after it's PG-13 theatrical run, unnecessary bare breasts and dubbed-in language have been placed rampantly.  Cinematography during the action sequences is indecipherable, with horrible editing added in.
 By the time you get to the car chase filmed in night-vision and textbook face-off at the end, you realize some movies are great on their own and don't need an updating - they are great as they are.  Do yourself a favor and pick up the original for a great action-science-ficiton romp that has brains and brawn.",1026691200,39,2934,4.861167002012072
1290011,1,B00003CXTC,"`Rollerball' is a god-awful remake of the 1975 Norman Jewison film about a fictional sport in which murdering the players becomes a primary object of the game. The original film acquired what little credibility it had by setting the story sometime in the distant future. This version is set in the present, but it tries to maintain its believability by locating the league in Southwest Asia, under the parochial assumption, I suppose, that that part of the world is every bit as alien, exotic and dehumanized as any hypothetical future society. It doesn't work. It is simply impossible for us to believe even for a split second that the owners and promoters of this sport would think they could get away with such murderous shenanigans broadcast live to millions of viewers the world over. Might not the United Nations, among other international organizations, have a thing or two to say about all this? Also, will someone please explain to me just WHAT purpose is served by having the promoters of this sport killing off their own players? Doesn't that sort of deplete their own resources for future games? I can't imagine too many people willingly signing on to engage in this sort of gladiatorial tomfoolery.
Even if we agreed to swallow the whole thing merely for the sake of the entertainment value of the film, we would be forced to admit that `Rollerball' is a chintzy, clunky, uninteresting movie in all respects. The sport itself - sort of a cross between motor cross racing, roller derby, hockey and basketball - is completely unexciting, consisting of little more than blurred figures racing madly around a cramped, claustrophobic track. Without even the context of good action sequences, `Rollerball' is forced to fall back on its dialogue and characters, which proves to be disastrous for all concerned. Chris Klein, in the role of hotshot Jonathon Cross - played by James Caan in the original - comes across as a minor league version of Keanu Reeves. LL Cool J is wasted in the part of Jonathon's American sidekick, and poor Jean Reno gets to play one of the most laughable villains we've run across in a movie in a long long long long time.
In fact, this redux turns out to be good for nothing BUT a few hearty laughs. If you are in need of such, check out `Rollerball.' It's a real hoot.",1026172800,12,2303,4.76

And the fact that the whole sequence was filmed in nightvision was just plain weird.  I don't know what gave them that idea.  The brief nudity seemed to come out of nowhere and added little to the plot.  I had to rewind it to try and understand why on Earth it suddenly happened.

There are so many things wrong with this movie I don't know where to start!
Chris Klein is sorely miscast as the lead.  The rollerball game itself has been turned from it's original rollerderby/football hybrid into a jumbled mess.
John McTiernan should have had his name removed from this film and replaced with Alan Smithee.
Hard to believe this came from the director of PREDATOR, DIE HARD, and THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, three superlative action films.
I don't feel like going into too much detail, because just thinking back on this movie is painful for me.
Periodically, you'll see a movie that has had too many ""creative hands"" in it.  Plot lines and other elements were changed or created to please focus groups, principle photography began before a script was completed, or the whole project was initiated simply because the studio was SURE it had a built-in audience.
Film students learn on day one of Filmmaking 101 that even if you have all the right ingredients, that alone isn't enough to make a good movie.  There also has to be respect for the source material, good acting and directing, and cooperation between the director, the producers, and the studio.  With ROLLERBALL, everything seemed to go wrong.

1290079,1,B00003CXTC,"Sports fans probably remember Fox Sports Net's series of commercials a year or two ago, advertising the new ""Regional Sports Reports"". These spots featured absurd imaginary sports being played in some dry and dusty location which looked vaguely Central Asian. The tag line was, ""sports news from the only region you care about --- yours.""
This new version of Rollerball looks like it was taken from one of those FSN commercials. Gone is the SF storyline of the original story. Rather than set the story in the future, the film makers transposed it to Central Asia in the present day, post-Soviet world.
The game vaguely resembles the original Rollerball, but is so hastily edited and poorly choreographed that nothing of what made the original game so compelling remains. It's just blow stuff up. Instead of drama, you get bashed in faces. In fact, although there's plenty of mindless action, there's actually less game footage than in the original... and less action.
Jean Reno delivers a terrible performance as the capitalist mogul who is (gasp!) deliberately cranking up the violence in the game for (gasp!) higher ratings. With the wretched script he's given, he could hardly be expected to fill the shoes of the role played by John Houseman, the icy corporate chief of the original.
As for Chris Klein... Granted, he doesn't have much of a script to work with, but I still found his performance annoying.  I've seen him do better work (""Election"") but he doesn't project the kind of screen presence James Caan did in the original.
Curiously, although the script dispenses with the science fiction background, it does have men and women playing on the same team, and showering in co-ed locker rooms. I seriously doubt there is a culture anywhere on Earth today where men and women would participate in full contact sports together, let alone get undressed in the same locker room. There would have to be some very intense social upheaval to make that happen, particularly in Central Asia, which is a fairly conservative part of the world.
If you thought ""Replicant"" was a great movie, then you might like this one; but frankly, folks, Chris Klein's performance makes Jean Claude van Damme look like Olivier. In fact even ""Replicant"" is mildly more interesting than this new ""Rollerball"". At least van Damme can do the splits.",1024790400,3,2330,4.9438775510204085
1290080,5,B00003CXTC,"This remake could better be understood and appreciated if one looks at it as a ""prequel"" rather than a ""remake"".  The original Rollerball is set in the far future in a 1984ish society, were as the ""remake"" is set only 3 years in the future (more or less it is happening right now), were the keystones of corporate society are just beginning to be set by globalization.  And as you know in the ""real world,"" two of the main players of globalization in the Middle East and Central Asia is the Red Mafia and Islamdom, which of coarse are dependent on Rollerball in the ""remake"" for their wealth.  Yes, there are differences in the two versions. Rollerball in the ""remake/prequel"" is like most novelty sports (XFL, WWF, NWO, X-Games); the players are social rejects (criminals, psychotics, Goths, thrill seekers, or athletes from mainstream sports that play too rough), it is a coed sport (so much in this sport, that the leader of the Istanbul Hawks is a woman, despite representing an Islamic State: note continual footage of the woman with the sunglasses), heavy rock music being played, uniforms that represent  individual personalities, it serves as a front for gambling and other criminal enterprises, and is (officially) non-lethal.  Rollerball in the ""original,"" is played by respected and law-abiding individuals, it is for men only, the music played is classical or at least contemporary classical, uniforms are well....uniformed, the sport replaces war as the chief vehicle of socially acceptable violence in an ""One-Nation World"", and there is no denying that the game's lethality is the whole point of the game!  The key is you need to see where two movie overlap outside of having the same title. At the start of the film, you have Global leaders visiting Petrovich, with an interest in expanding this Islamo-Soviet sport ; are these people the founders of Energy Inc?  The game, in the prequel, for the first time, changes its rules; in the original film, the Houston coach mentioned that the game has had numerous changes, but was still the same game (obviously two of those rule changes did away with female players and personalized outfits,).  So is Jonathan E actually Jonathan Cross?  Is Jonathan E.'s estranged wife Aurora? In a Special Edition Version of Jewison's Rollerball, will you have La Guillotine digitally added to Team New York (another rule change, no team nicknames), to add to the mayhem? Will Chopin and Stravinsky replace Rob Zombie and Pink as Rollerball musicians?  Probably no, no, no, and yes.

1290082,1,B00003CXTC,"Several masters of action film have fallen prey to the undisciplined chaos of post-MTV, music-video-style editing and filmmaking.  Tony Scott's Spy Game was one, but that film at least had the star power of Robert Redford and Brad Pitt to rescue it.  Rollerball, on the other hand, has no redeeming features -- it is easily the worst film in John McTiernan's oeuvre.
Which is sad, because McTiernan's resume is an astonishing one:  Predator, Die Hard, Die Hard with a Vengeance, The Hunt for Red October.  Even his worst film up to now, Last Action Hero, was better than the mess that is Rollerball.  From the beginning, it's clear that this film has no interest whatsoever in characterization and pacing.  It simply thrusts you into sequence after sequence of undisciplined chaos.  Who is main character Jonathan Cross?  Who is his buddy?  You still won't have a clue 30 minutes into the film, and that's about 20 minutes too late.  Too much loud music, messy dialogue editing, use of pointless and ugly jump cuts, and hyperactive camera work conspire to make Rollerball an even bigger migraine than Swordfish...and that's saying a lot.  Handheld camera is an overrated device indeed, and in the case of Rollerball, there are so many characters onscreen at a time that you'll find yourself desperately straining to figure out who's saying what, who is the focal point, and what exactly is going on.  The overall feeling is that this film was shot in pure handheld-coverage style, the filmmakers simply mashing all the actors together in a location and then shooting endless amounts of film, without preplanning as to how it would all cut together.  Call this modern filmmaking, but I'd take the razor-precision of Die Hard, Lethal Weapon and Top Gun any day.
Matched with the stylistic anarchy is a cast of characters who mostly behave like animals or clowns.  There's not a single recognizable human trait in these characters; their motivations and behaviour are outlandishly cartoonish, without the entertaining factor.
What happened?  I believe that action masters like McTiernan and Scott may have been led down this undesireable path by all the young Turks springing up from music-video backgrounds to do features.  Unfortunately, as in the case of Rollerball, Swordfish, Gone in 60 Seconds, The Replacement Killers, this style is a true atrocity to action filmmaking.
