8406178,5,B003UUY3H8,"Days of Jesse James- Roy Rogers is our hero looking for famous outlaw Jesse James. But the movie has rewritten history, not only by transporting real life person Roy Rogers back to the 1800s, but Jesse James here is a good guy, who only robs from the rich to give to the poor ala Robin Hood. But who cares! It's all in the name of good clean fun with Roy singing a couple of musical numbers, everyone's favorite western sidekick George 'Gabby' Hayes, and of course Trigger. Roy made this one early in his career so he's particularly young and handsome. He definitely had all the qualities of a classic western hero.
Return of Billy The Kid- In the beginning of this film, Roy plays Billy the Kid. It's a bit disturbing to watch Roy shoot a guy in cold blood, even if he is playing a character. Although Billy is not exactly a good guy, like Jesse James in the last film, he does have a good side in that he protects the settlers from the evil ranchers in the wilds of New Mexico. That is why Billy's doppelganger Peace Officer Roy Rogers poses as Billy. This film has even more singing by Roy and his sidekick, Smiley Burnette. All in all, good clean western fun.",1278374400,,1163,4.364055299539171
