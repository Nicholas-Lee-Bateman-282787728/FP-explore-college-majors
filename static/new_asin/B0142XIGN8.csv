7382756,5,B0142XIGN8,excellent concert with tom morello doing a few twisted variation of the solos from several songs... highly recommended!! it has no special features... only the concert!!,1446163200,4,169,5.538461538461538
7382757,5,B0142XIGN8,"This show is one of the most memorable ones in RATM history.  It is a shame that the people who actually Produced it were not properly credited.  The entire team from DC3 were left from the credits on this show.  Even after repeated requests from our team and the band, the people at HD Logix refused to issue the credits to the key people who actually produced this project.  The ""real"" producers were Daniel E Catullo III, Peter Bowers and Lionel Pasamonte.  There were over 40 other key people intentionally omitted too, which is a real shame.  With that being said the DVD is truly a gem.  Hopefully people enjoy the DVD as much as we did producing it.  Being on the road with the band and capturing these moments was one of the highlights of my career and one that none of us will ever forget, including the band.  70,000 screaming Rage fans in London- how could you go wrong?",1445990400,6,881,4.422360248447205
7382758,5,B0142XIGN8,"Great concert.  The camera angles make you fell the energy of the concert.  Almost like you are part of it.  The extras are meh.  Finally Rage in HD, not much left to say after that.",1445904000,2,182,4.114285714285714
7382759,5,B0142XIGN8,Great show finally in 1080p. Only beef is why did I have to pay 17.98 for my bluray and now its 10.99? So not cool.,1445040000,2,115,3.64
7382780,4,B0142XIGN8,"this live concert kills fascists dead! amazing show and booming tracks from beginning to end!

7382782,2,B0142XIGN8,"The music is great but the place this movie fails is the video.  They switch camera views every 5 seconds, from the drums to the guitar to the crowd in back. How the F can you enjoy the visual part of the show when it's constantly changing.  The director really F'd up this one.",1463270400,4,278,4.12962962962963

7382786,1,B0142XIGN8,"Not a ""Verified Purchase"" because I received this as a gift (Blu-ray).

I had such high expectations for this release from Rage Against the Machine. Their studio album releases are widely known among music lovers to be some of the best-produced out there (especially for not being destroyed by the ""loudness wars"", as the vast majority of music is). Aside from good production, I love the band's style, the genre, etc.

Well, to my great disappointment, this release is yet another victim of the loudness wars. It has basically no dynamics - everything is horribly compressed, with some hints of extra clipping/distortion(not the good kind) thrown on top. As if that's not bad enough, the highs are elevated (making the sound ear-piercing/harsh), the vocals are elevated (I love Zach's voice, but not compressed, boosted, and maybe even with signs of distortion), and other problems.

ANY average Jane or Joe will be able to immediately notice just how bad it is, even with low-end equipment (maybe even 'especially with'). Just go to RATM's youtube page, they uploaded ""Bulls on Parade"" and ""Testify"" from this Blu-ray release. Compare back and forth with the album versions of these songs. It's a travesty.

I guess as a positive, the video quality is good, the performance is energetic (they are into it, feels like a friendly band reunion), and I can hear the bass guitar (signature RATM, unlike many other bands).

Having said all that, I cannot give this more than 1 star. It's un-listenable (if that's a word) and as a RATM fan I would feel ashamed to share this performance with anyone else because I don't want them to hear it. Buy and enjoy the original albums.",1456704000,5,1671,4.869718309859155
7382787,5,B0142XIGN8,"OMG THIS SHOW IS AMAZING!!!!! FROM START THE FINISH HAS YOU GOING CRAZY!!! ONE OF THE BEST CONCERT BLU-RAYS I HAVE, SOUNDS AMAZING, THE SOUND IS PERFECT!!!

8729484,5,B0142XIGN8,"Very well produced and stellar sound for a live show.  In comparison between this and ""Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium"" - this one wins as (again) time was taken to storyboard the shots/cameras but both are classic RATM for any fans!",1531699200,,238,4.666666666666667
8729485,5,B0142XIGN8,"Some of the best camera work I have seen in a rock concert video.  It captures the mood of the band and the crowd well enough to bring the watcher right in to the experience.  Besides the energetic performance of the band, the video has an interesting story to tell about how the concert came about.  Play it on good speakers and crank it up.",1520640000,,342,4.230769230769231

8729491,3,B0142XIGN8,"Great blu-ray concert marred by non-functioning subtitles, making the lyrics very difficult to follow for us hard-of-hearing folks. Otherwise five stars.",1467158400,,153,6.333333333333333
8729492,5,B0142XIGN8,"While I may not agree with all of the political agendas behind their music, this band puts on one hell of a show. The concert itself is phenomenal. The band performs some of the best live renditions of all of their songs, with a captivating and mesmerizing stage presence. The music itself is great, and performed exceedingly well. Rage has always been one of my favorite bands, and this performance really does a good job of capturing their raw talent and ability to speak to large groups of listeners.
The picture quality, sound quality, and cinematography of this performance is perfect. If you like this band, you need this DVD.",1466726400,,632,4.754545454545455
