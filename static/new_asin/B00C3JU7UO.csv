5690194,4,B00C3JU7UO,"Nice little late-80s action/science fiction anime.  Masamune Shirow (Ghost in the Shell, Appleseed) wrote and co-directed this one-shot OVA based off of a chapter from his manga of the same name.  Pretty good story, interesting characters and designs.",1430092800,3,251,5.578947368421052
5690195,3,B00C3JU7UO,"A military transport aircraft is brought down due to bad weather conditions. On the aircraft, two fully equipped androids dubbed M-66 are being transported. During the crash, the androids escape and are loose in the woods. It's revealed that they're programmed to neutralize a person. The military are soon called to capture the robots, but a news reporter named Sybel also involves herself in the affair.-summary

Black Magic M-66 is a short OVA that was released in 1987 and directed by Masamune Shirow. The OVA is also based on the 1983 manga, which is written by Shirow as well. Shirow is best known for the popular manga Ghost in the Shell(GITS). The only similarities between this and GITS, are that they're both of the cyberpunk and sci-fi genres, and in anime form Black Magic M-66 is nowhere near on the visual level as the film Ghost in the Shell.

The OVA is a simple story on the puppet master losing control of his puppets. The two androids are suppose to be the perfect robots and at times they seem to be, by utilizing stealth tactics and later on displaying a wide range of all out attacks. They quickly make short work of the military forces. The story begins to develop more of a plot when the target is finally revealed.

The main character Sybel, a journalist whom was captured by the military learns who the target is and decides to protect the person. Surprisingly, even for a short film(48mins.) character development is present. Sybel is well developed, and she eventually puts her personal goal aside to try and save the very possible victim, therefore it's pretty easy to cheer for her. However, the androids are the standouts to me despite having no dialogue.

The characters of the M-66's are developed and greatly enhanced by their robotic demeanor. They fit my vision of a true robot: A being whom happens to be cold, emotionless, and cannot be reasoned with. They are cold blooded killing machines with cruel tactics and they will accomplish their mission by any means. It doesn't take the action long to begin, and it delivers once it gets there. The action scenes are pretty cool during the first half. There's a good amount of violence with minimal gore, but it never becomes over the top. Later, the action scenes lose a small amount of appeal when the plot turns into just another chase.

The animation is pretty fluid during the battles. Some of the close in battles and shootouts are pretty good, with well animated choreography which switches between swift fisticuffs and weapon use. I really like the character designs of the two robots, because they come off really creepy looking. Their facial expressions tells the story completely.

The soundtrack may not be spectacular but it's well used. I really enjoyed how the soundtrack was put to work. Before the androids make their full appearances the BGM enhances their menacing nature, by speeding up to a more sinister tone when they were in pursuit of their possible victims via first person view. In this area, the BGM was also well assisted by the camera work.

I don't quite understand the deal when it comes down to older anime; but a majority of the time the dubs aren't really up to standard. The sub clearly outshines it in terms of better voice acting. The dub has a small amount of foul language though. There's also a small amount of fan service that doesn't get out of hand.

Black Magic M-66 also has a pretty good ending and surprisingly it doesn't feel rushed. Those out there whom truly believe that Blood: The Last Vampire can be excused for having a phantom story due to length should see this. This movie managed to pack quite a bit in its short run time. It's actually interesting to think what this could be should it ever be remade with better production values. I recommend this title only to the most die hard anime fans, fans of older anime, and fans of Shirow; but I recommend getting it cheap because it's not worth the insane prices I've seen.

Pros: Good action, good animation for its time, and nice character designs

Cons: Simple all around, really does feel dated",1428105600,3,4087,4.711484593837535

5690197,4,B00C3JU7UO,"Decent anime.  Story is average.  Animation isn't anything special.  I did love the robot, which is the main reason I bought this.  This version does not have an English dub.  Not a problem if you only watch foreign films with sub-titles, but some people may want to spend more on the other version to get the dub.",1411084800,5,314,4.43859649122807
5690198,4,B00C3JU7UO,"This is a non-HD transfer. Image quality is okay, but suffers if
you watch it on a large screen format HDTV.

Good replacement for those who own the VHS copy (as I did).

The film itself is cool. In a nutshell, take the action of Terminator 2...
and condense it into a 45 minute film. Classic anime action, worth
checking out.",1394755200,,326,4.327868852459017

8577117,4,B00C3JU7UO,"The first manga series by Ghost In The Shell creator Masamune Shirow was Black Magic. Originally a doujinshi, it was later printed by a mainstream publisher, and was a series of short stories all connected to a future civil war between Earth and a colonized Venus. Taking one of the single chapters from the manga and removing most of the background surrounding its continuity, a one-shot OVA was made under the title Black Magic M-66. Directed by Shirow himself along with Hiroyuki Kitakubo, the anime takes the basic premise for the manga chapter it was based on, and turns into a bizarre hybrid of 80s American action films.

 Set in a somewhat idealized future, an aircraft hauling two battle androids called M66s, crashes in the woods, so the army shows up to reclaim the robots which have now been activated and gone on a killing spree. Ace reporter Sybil gets wind of this and heads to investigate. The army deactivates one of the androids, but the other escape, now with its programming shifted to killing Ferris, the teenage granddaughter of his creator. Being only one to uncover the androids target, Sybil sets out to save Ferris by stealing an ""inner-city plane"", and arrives at the club she's at just as the M66 discovers them both. They manage to get away briefly, but the M66 seems near unstoppable, even with help from the army. The ultimate showdown has the M66 falling off a building Hans Gruber-style, and being reclaimed by the government.

Black Magic M66 manages to mix in elements from Predator, Terminator, and Die Hard into a single OVA which runs under an hour, and was probably put together in Japan with the intent of getting more Americans interested in anime. It did succeed in this respect, at least among the earlier days of U.S. otaku during the late 80s to early 90s. The animation is acceptable for its time, especially considering it was one of the first OVAs ever made. The love for the actual manga never really caught on out in the States, except for GITS fanatics who collect all things Shirow-related. The initial North American release was by U.S. Renditions in one of their few VHS selections, and later dubbed by Manga Entertainment. It's currently also available on DVD in subtitled-only by Maiden Japan.",1490918400,,2249,4.8062015503875966
