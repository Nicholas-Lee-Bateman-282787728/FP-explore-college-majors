7414563,1,B014L2Y7EW,"It does not do justice to the Halo Lore.  Artwork and storytelling are meager, childish.  It looks like it has a lot of potential and the trailers sell it that way, but it is, without an ounce of doubt, a complete waste of time.  I was very disappointed when I bought the limited edition of Halo 5 and got this!!  Spoiler Alert: You never actually see ""The Fall of Reach"" happen.  Compared to the book, this has like 5% of the material.

With the awesomeness that was Halo Legends, this animated series is a joke, non-existent.  A smear to Halo's universe.

If you really want to know about Blue Team and the Spartan-II origins, read Eric Nylund's The Fall of Reach -- its a much better use of your hard-earned cash.",1446595200,15,716,4.412213740458015
7414564,2,B014L2Y7EW,"Not a bad film at all if you know nothing of Master Chief's origin or story. Sad to see how they skewed everything so much for the film's sake. Honestly, if you're a reader...skip this and buy the book. You won't be able to put it down and you will get the real story. If not, this will get you enough of the beginning. Just not accurately and with far less of much needed details.",1446508800,15,381,4.093333333333334

7414569,2,B014L2Y7EW,"I watched this on netflix and it's nothing like what's in the book. The animation style is interesting, it's more artful then animated, but I never expected it to have Blur Studio tier animation. Mendez looks nor sounds anything like he does in the book which really disappointed me, half the parts on reach are nothing like they were in the book. John looks pretty similar to the john in the comics and in the book so at least they got that right. Half of the book ""Fall of Reach"" is not even in the short movie. I had to force myself to watch most of it. It should have just been called ""Story of John, 117""",1492300800,,609,4.213675213675214

7414574,4,B014L2Y7EW,I loved this movie. It was really good. I liked the premise of it. It actually told the story of how Master Chief came to be. The only downside is I thought that it told the story of how Reach ended by the title. But all in all it was a good movie. The art was beautifully done. It makes me want to watch and get other Halo movies. I enjoyed it.,1485216000,,345,3.8055555555555554

7414589,3,B014L2Y7EW,"Halo: The Fall of Reach is the title of a bestselling novel by Eric Nylund, which tells the story of the origination of the Spartans, the discovery of the Covenant, and the discovery of Halo. This CGI shares the title of the great novel, but only tells part of the story. It tells the story of recruitment and creation of the Spartans, their training, and their first operation against the Covenant.

Overall, I did not mind that this is something of a stripped-down Fall of Reach, as I am hoping its only Part 1 of a series that will bring the entire novel to life. I thought that the creators did a good job with the story, though there were some changes to it  apparently movie-makers ALWAYS have to change something! Its just not a bad story.

An even bigger problem with this movie is the quality of the CGI, which is surprisingly bad. The movie looks like it was made with years-old techniques, rather than the quality of other recent productions. I just don't know why it looks the way that it does!

But, that said, I did enjoy this movie, and I dearly hope that there will be more to come  hopefully even better movies!",1462752000,,1128,4.429951690821256
7414590,4,B014L2Y7EW,"Straight up front my biggest issue with this movie is the misleading title. This is NOT based on Fall of Reach the novel, this movie is very clearly based off the comic adaptation, Halo Fall of Reach #1-4 also known as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halo-Fall-of-Reach-Bootcamp-Halo-Marvel-Hardcover/dp/078515146X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halo: Fall of Reach Bootcamp (Halo (Marvel Hardcover))</a>.

The art style of the movie is clearly inspired by if not an outright mimic of the style seen in the comic and follows both the same storyline and stop point.

To that end it is actually a very good adaptation of the source material, the only noteworthy story cut I can find is that we don't see the SPARTAN-II's 'playing' capture the flag against trainers wearing MARK I exoskeleton body armor. A favorite scene of mine in both the Novel and comic which I think better exemplified how altered the SPARTAN-II's were rather than just showing John Kill some unarmed marines bare handed.

So yes this movie has its faults but I would still recommend it to people who either won't read the full novel or who can appreciate it for what it is; an adaptation of the COMIC which is a partial adaptation of the BOOK.",1461801600,,1252,5.28140703517588

The fact the fact the animation looked terrible and dead akin to n64 graphics?
the fact the voice acting was terrible?
The story was painfully slow and time misused in crappy story telling choices?
The fact they totally use the wrong models for everything from the Spartan Armor to the weapons used at the time? To making the Covenant look like the Storm Covenant from Halo 4? Actually they seem to use a LOT of Models from Halo 4, nothing looks like how it should, nothing looks like how it was in Halo 1, 2, 3 or.. you know.. Fricken HALO REACH!?

Don't buy this, don't bother wasting your time, Don't watch it on netflix unless you want to rage.

It literally stops half way through, and at the end you realize they changed it from telling the Spartans' story to a teaser for Halo 5.  Not to mention horrible animation quality.  Every scene feels rushed and several characters' pots are not even mentioned, including Keyes' story arc which is one of my favorites in the book.  Cortana is not even introduced!!!  This could have been so much I would love to see a live action version similar to forward unto dawn that has enough screen time to at least cover the whole story, even if it couldn't include every detail from the book.

It left out a lot, but when you only do 1 hour and 1 minute, you have to leave something out.  It followed the first book, ""The Fall of Reach"", somewhat.  However, the Master Chief didn't meet with his team and ask everyone to follow him.  They'd already had.",1454976000,,407,4.220779220779221
7414618,2,B014L2Y7EW,"I'm not usually one to bash an artistic/creative endeavor, and I have no idea what the budget was for this animated film (I have to assume it was...less than optimal), so it's with great reluctance that I give this film 2 stars.

I've read the short Sci-Fi novel upon which this film is based, and perhaps if the viewer has not, this film will not taste quite so impaletable. Having read it, however, I noticed pointless changes to the dialog which actually subtracted from the emotional atmosphere and ""punch"" of the interactions. Likewise, little plot changes (i.e. In the novel, John wins over his teammates not with stolen crackers, but with his actions on the next team test. The former action shows a person willing to bribe others with gifts and promises, needful or otherwise, whereas the latter suggests a person of actions and intent) were made that, again, seemed altered only to offer the chance for the screenplay writer to change something, or as Jubal Harshaw in ""Stranger In A Strange Land"" put it, ""You have to give an editor something to change, or he gets frustrated. After he pees in it, he likes the flavor better...""
Aside from the book-to-film differences/deficiencies, the animation is truly sub-par: Figures barely move, and when they do it is with the wooden economy of motion of an automaton. The voice actors do a good job with what they're given, but between backgrounds that are obviously painted stills over which the subjects are being projected/moved (a technique used to far greater effect in ""Akira"") and the jerky, semi-natural subject animation, the entire film comes off as a lackadaisical, half-assed rush job.
In a day and age where independent fan films and the graduate thesis projects of animation students produce wonders of innovation and imagination, this kind of production is massively disappointing. I'll admit that the original novel is far from being a Neal Stephenson or Jon Scalzi gem, but it deserved better representation than this.
The two stars are for the cast and crew/animators, for they've done something I have not: they've produced and sold a film. Well done ladies and gentlemen. Now, hopefully, you've honed your craft enough that your next feature is far more impressive.",1454889600,,2237,4.981283422459893

I got an oddly animated seemingly verbatim retelling of the book The Fall Of Reach (from what I can tell from plot summaries - I have not read the book).

The animation was a bit jarring to me having watched quite a bit of Ghost in the Shell and other 3D animated content. I had to commit to it for about a third of the movie before it stopped getting into my enjoyment of the story in a meaningful way. That being said, it's an odd thing - I can't tell if the animation improved or I adjusted to it, but at that 1/3rd of the movie, it stopped being an issue.

7414674,4,B014L2Y7EW,"Thank you Content Media Corp for sending us a screener to review!

The Halo series began in 2001 and after a few studio swaps, is still going strong to this day.  The current studio, 343 Industries, and Microsoft have worked together to make Halo: The Fall of Reach. It is based off of the popular book and is a prequel to the games, which discloses the backstory of John 117, also known as Master Chief.

John and seventy-four other genetically superior children were handpicked by Dr. Catherine Halsey to participate in an elite soldier program called Spartan.  These six-year-old children were taken from their families (with robotic clones left in their place) and raised in a harsh military environment.  In order to survive, or even be fed, these children had to learn to work together as a team.  John was a natural born leader and it showed.

After several trials that sometimes proved deadly, the worst was yet to come, augmentation.  The surgical procedures shown in this film are a bit gruesome and the fatality rate was 36% as these procedures were experimental and inhumane in many cases.  The doctor questioned her motives, but in the end was convinced that the ends would justify the means as these Spartan soldiers were humanitys only defense from the Covenant threat.

The alien races working together as the Covenant are convinced that they're doing Gods work by wiping out the human race.  Their technology is light years ahead of human capabilities but like many things, there is always a vulnerability.  John and his team have to find it.
 Not only is the story great in Halo: The Fall of Reach, but there is plenty of action, character development and references to various games in the series.  For example, some ODST soldiers make the mistake of picking a fight with John during a workout session.

Since we were sent a low quality screener, I cant vouch for how crisp the visual or audio quality is in the final product.  The movie is computer animated and is not as modern looking as some triple A video games.  Even still, Im curious how it will look on blu-ray which goes for less than $15 on Amazon.  The movie is relatively short and clocks in at an hour and five minutes.  According to the reviews, like many situations, the book is better.  As a casual Halo fan who has played the first two games, and hasn't read the books, I enjoyed watching this film. Because of the violence and language, it's best suited for older gamers and not children.",1449100800,2,2476,4.6875

All in all the series was okay.",1448928000,3,660,4.0458015267175576
7414678,3,B014L2Y7EW,"I'm a huge fan of Nylund's work... He was the one who breathed life into me for the II's and made me fall in love with them. He's also one of the best established universe/expanded universe (i.e.: Places like Halo, Star Wars) authors that I've ever read. He does a fantastic job nailing down characters, story, and emotion...

I knew from the start that this wouldn't be as good as Nylund's work, even with Steven Spielburg as the producer/director/whatever. The biggest problem was the length: This is a LONG book to adapt, easily over 500-600 pages. Especially when you find out that it's three 23 minute long segments. There would be a lot to cut out, but doing so also removed a lot of what Nylund did:

NOTE: I WILL not get into the technicalities of things... Meaning what ship/gun is supposed to be compared to what is used. This is purely based on plot/character development/my own reactions to the book compared to the movie.

First: Halsey's encounter with John. I honestly got goosebumps when I read about John catching the coin in mid-air and still call it. That was purely the luck only John would have. It's also the hugest reason Halsey chose him... He was fast enough to catch the coin in mid-air, and still call it. It was something that floored me, and having it cut down to him calling it a few times really changed my view of where this was going. Him fighting the kids? Eh... I've seen fights happen like this in King of the Hill. I was a participant in one of these for two days before the teacher found out. Kids can learn moves like that on tv or martial arts classes, so I don't totally blow it off.

Second: Training. I have a feeling this is more of a political move than a changing everything move. The training for the kids in the book is downright BRUTAL. It's effective and I don't say it's wrong, but I know a lot of people, including my parents/godparents who I mentioned this to in a debate about something like this... Would find this to be on FOX news or CNN saying how child abuse is being encouraged or some bull like that, I digress. They REALLY cut back on the training methods. The shock stick especially that was used in every disobedience. The first morning all the kids felt it when they didn't wake up in time, or didn't run fast enough, or do their exercises. It wasn't used as a threat, it was used as a motivation to get the kids moving immediately. Also, the kids would be dead on their feet at the end of the first day of morning exercises. 100 reps of jumping jacks, leg lifts, sit ups, and deep knee bends had them all on the ground not able to move. Not standing up and saluting. The playground was REALLY cut back also... Seriously, the kids were using pulleys to get themselves to the top, meaning much more teamwork because none of them could pull themselves up alone, or even two, not climbing over crates and jumping across little floating objects.

Thirdly: John's development as a leader. This REALLY annoyed me, and unlike the reason above, there was no reason to except time. John spent a whole day hating Kelly and Sam for his own screw up. He avoided them and blamed them for him losing dinner. It was only when Sam pushed him and Kelly and Sam threatened John that he went to help, mainly because he was so tired and hungry at that point he agreed to help. It was his admiration of the two that had him agree to keep as a team. And Frederic and Linda WERE NOT PART OF THE TEAM YET!!!

Fourth: Augmentation. They actually did a good job portraying the emotions, especially Halsey's, of the augmentation. I did like that. What I didn't like was what they missed out on. There's several little moments in there that they missed that really got to me, the biggest being was when Halsey spoke to John right before he went under. This was a VERY small moment, but the sheer pain you felt when she spoke to him like that and knew what was going to happen really got to me. Especially her and Mendez's reaction to him asking for help on how to beat this mission. This was completely missed in the movie, that and Fhajad's goodbye to John, a VERY small moment, but one that also I never really forgot.

Fifth: Anyone who's read the book knows this is coming: Capture the Flag after augmentation. Hands down, one of my favorite moments of the book. It gave me goosebumps to read how much they improved and what they could do. It's something you REALLY have to read to understand why this moment stood out and why I'm very annoyed they removed it completely.

Sixth: What happened to the rest of the 33 kids? Seriously, what happened to the rest of the kids? Did they disappear off the face of the galaxy to never be shown again? Granted, this is about Blue Team, but a lot of the time, THEY DIDN'T EVEN SHOW THE OTHER KIDS, especially when it came to the armor. You saw shadows, but seriously, you can't show anyone else except Blue Team? Especially with armor?

Seventh: Why does Dr. Halsey seem like a cold-hearted hag who treats the kids like lab rats most of the time? Granted, she did start this way. Even in the book. But even during training she grew close to the II's. She spoke to them by name and especially wouldn't treat John fighting a bunch of ODST's like a science experiment when Mendez is upset about it. I know that 343 seems to want to tear apart the II program and everything it stands for a lot, including people involved, but it's a FLASHBACK. You can't change what HAS ALREADY BEEN STATED!!!

What I liked:

Sam's death: I really liked how they portrayed Sam's death in the movie. They did a helluva job covering the raw emotion the kids felt when they left him behind. He left a huge impact on the II's and it was shown well here.

The Spartan lecture: A lot of people have been complaining about this from what I read. I bet they'd be shocked to know that it was a 100% accurate to the book. The book DID cover the 300 battle, and they DID lie to the children on who won. I can't exactly know why it was written this way, but if I had to guess, it was to show the children that they could do anything, that they could win against any odds no matter what.

They actually do a really good job in most of the scenes. Even with the changes, it's recognized for what it is and still can bring some emotion. It doesn't have the impact of the book, and it's VASTLY cut down to only a third of the book if that. But there's a lot of scenes I do enjoy, especially when the kids are in downtime waiting for a mission to start. It changed a ton, but it still is enjoyable on several parts, just not as well as the book has.

All in all, I would put this down as more of an adaptation to the COMIC than the book. Would I recommend it? If you are interested in the Fall of Reach Saga without buying the book, go ahead... If you LOVE the book, sure... But I would HIGHLY recommend you read/watch both to understand both perspectives. A lot of Nylund's part was either changed or completely removed, which loses a lot of the soul of the characters, especially when you look at how he writes and the characterizations he puts in.",1448668800,5,7093,4.347432024169184
7414679,3,B014L2Y7EW,"This was such a huge let down and disappointment. TFOR has been the PERFECT material for a Halo movie for years. And they finally get an opportunity to at least make an Animated one, 3D or otherwise. And they manage to mess it up somehow still.

That's not to say it's terrible or not enjoyable. Because it is, DEM FEELS. I waited what 14 years for something like this to happen? So no doubt there were a lot of good moments straight from the book that were so nostalgic and tear jerking... But everything is incredibly condensed and is missing the entire 3rd act of the book.  While omitting a very large chunk of what it DOES show.

The series is called ""The Fall of Reach"", which makes literally ZERO sense and is entirely a misnomer!
No doubt there will be endless people confused by the title at the end of the series if they haven't read the book.
Because again, it omits so much of Reach and the actual pivotal ""Fall"" of Reach.
The series starts and ends on the glassed surface of Reach but it feels out of context and out of place. Shoved in for no purpose other than to pander and tie in to Halo 5. Causing further confusion.

Perhaps they were simply too afraid to confuse the general casual fanbase by including one of the more important parts of the book. That lead up directly to the first game. Because it would be too much effort and work to sit down and iron out the huge contradictions and retcons with that load of heaping s*** called Halo:Reach (Though Jorge makes a cameo as a child here. Which I thoroughly enjoyed).

So, while this is very disappointing. It earns stars simply for being less of a catastrophic let down than Halo:Reach was and earns points for not steamrolling everything.

They should really just make a live action/CGi movie series based on this book, First Strike and the like.
It deserves so much more than this.",1448236800,3,1854,4.454277286135693
7414680,1,B014L2Y7EW,"I watched this in the episode format on Halo Channel on my Xbox One.  It's exactly the same program, just sliced into three parts.  I'm giving it a one star review for a few very major reasons, but I'll cover the good first.

One thing this had going for it was that it has amazing production value.  While last year's Halo: Nightfall utilized cheap animated effects and ended up looking like an under-budget SyFy amateur film in the end, Halo: The Fall of Reach is fully animated by a team (Sequence) who's become very familiar with Halo's visual signature (they animated in-game Terminal bonus content for Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, Halo 4, and Halo 2: Anniversary, making this film their fourth slice into the Halo universe - and their first full-blown one).  This experience pays off.  Everything looks like it belongs in the Halo universe.  I'm actually not a huge fan of the Sequence animation - I found its use distracting in the video games - but even I can't deny that, despite it not being my cup of tea, it's still very beautiful and very effective in this context.

Another guaranteed win this film had was the writing.  Nylund's 2001 novel The Fall of Reach, on which this is based, remains one of the top Halo novels to date.  It was the novel that exploded the Halo lore from a collection of loose notes at the Bungie studio into a full-blown Halo Bible with carefully developed and fleshed out plot threads and characters.  They shot themselves in the foot with this film adaptation, actually, but we'll get to that later - the point I'm making right here is that Nylund's plot and backstory for the genesis of the modern Halo universe remains one of its most compelling aspects.  That's exactly why we keep revisiting it (with the original 2001 novel, a 2010 reprint, some 2010-2011 comic book adaptations, and now this 2015 film adaptation - plus the first-time integration of some key Fall of Reach characters into the video game universe with Halo 5: Guardians).

This film just makes a lot of missteps.  By far its biggest sin is its branding.  I mentioned earlier that the team creating this film shot themselves in the foot when they decided to use Nylund's plot line.  The reason is this: The novel was titled ""Fall of Reach"" because, even from the beginning of the novel, this origin story for the Spartan-IIs was building to one final climactic battle on the planet Reach where most of the original Spartans would perish.  This battle - the Fall of Reach - and the events leading up to it represent the novel's entire third act.  As a result of the stakes, the novel spends a lot of time developing many of the individual Spartan-IIs who would eventually die on Reach.  The arc was really effective in setting up John-117's mindset going into the Halo event.

This film, in comparison, focuses heavily on Blue Team, to the point of rewriting some of Nylund's work.  There isn't necessarily anything wrong with rewriting previous work to fit within a new telling, but they made major cuts here.  They inaccurately depicted the original Blue Team as the same members we see in Halo 5: Guardians, but this wasn't true in the novel.  Not a huge deal, since they're trying to introduce players to Blue Team with this retelling.  That said, as a result of their narrowed focus in storytelling, they found a different point in the narrative that seemed effective as a climax - the first time Blue Team really works together in their suits of MJOLNIR armor boarding and destroying a Covenant ship.  This is an unforgivable cut that makes this film not just an inaccurate retelling - it makes its title blatantly false advertising.  The Fall of Reach isn't even mentioned in this adaptation.  The story here is missing its entire third act.  This would absolutely be more forgivable if they decided to retitle the project so that it wouldn't be so misleading - and that would give them more wiggle room for rewrites, too.

Another large blunder is that they took a few too many creative liberties with some of the classic scenes from this story.  John's famous coin flip scene, where he successfully snatched the coin out of the air and *still* predicted which side would land up, has been reduced to a few coin flips correctly guessed.  In that same scene, a child John is also shown roundhouse kicking and headbutting other children off the top of a hill while playing king of the hill.  It's not a major change, but it's weirdly violent and really seems out of place here - and is certainly not how this game was written in the novel.  Same thing with John's gym scene in which he accidentally killed a number of ODSTs.  In the original scene of the novel, the ODSTs came into the gym and bullied John into a boxing ring.  There, they approached John one-by-one and, very accidentally (because he didn't yet know his augmented strength), he accidentally killed a few of them with single punches.  In this film adaptation, the ODSTs approach John with weapons and he very deliberately subdues them - though it takes several hits to bring them down this time.  When he's got most of them down, he jumps on one and begins just wailing on the guy.  It makes John seem like a psycho compared to the original scene where he accidentally killed them with single punches.

Overall, fans of the game who are unaware of the extended universe should like this film okay.  It's got redeeming qualities, which I outlined above.  However, I can't help but feel most of its good qualities are mostly superficial and its heaviest flaws - like literally just lopping off the story's third and best act - are lazy solutions to storytelling problems and are unforgivable.  Therefore, I'm giving this film a one-star score to express my disappointment that 343 - a studio who has so far upheld the Halo lore admirably - would slip this disappointingly and let this crap be published as it is.  You guys get one star simply because I *know* you can do better than this.",1448064000,63,5975,4.672084130019121
7414681,4,B014L2Y7EW,"Read the novel (The Fall of Reach)! I am also a huge Halo fan. I was excited for this animated series to release but was disappointed when I only got three acts. I do recommend this animated series for Halo novice who DON'T want to read the novel or comic books. Seriously though, IT DID NOT EVEN, AT ALL, SHOW THE FALL OF REACH! That's really the only disappointing part of this animated series. Come on, 343i John was not that bad at all as described in the novel. But knowing myself, I will purchase this animated series because I love Halo. If the Halo series goes down the drain, then I will still follow it.",1447632000,7,613,4.293103448275862
7414682,4,B014L2Y7EW,"Consider this a 3.5 star review.  If you are the fan that will be enraged because the wrong kind of armor variant is used or because the book, Fall of Reach,  says one person is taller than another but that isn't represented in the animated series, this isn't for you. You will not like it.

If you are a Halo fan, even a hardcore one like myself but don't care so much about the minutia, then this is a pretty good animated series with the only major drawbacks being the limitations of the art style and the fact that it completely leaves out the actual fall of Reach.  Another act with another 20 minutes would have turned this from a 3.5 start to a 4.5 star.  I would say this isn't as good as FuD but better than Nightfall for sure and better then most of what we got in Legends.

Some fans will not like the departures it takes from the book Fall of Reach but you have to go into this understanding it is another medium with different things to bring to the table and different restrictions that WILL alter the story's telling.  The animation itself feels a but constricted with it, at times, feeling almost like a moving comic.  This is really only problematic in the actions sequences which often felt cramped and hindered by the art style.  But in the end, this version was more about story then anything else.

This animated series presents the pure essence of the book.  The forming of the Spartans, the building of their relationships, the development of Master Chief and finally, understanding the cost of it all.  This is the book Fall of Reach distilled into it's purest emotions and themes.  Yes, it leaves things out, but this series was not tasked with telling the full tale, only introducing us to and developing Blue Team.

The ultimate telling of this and the ultimate authority will remain the book, The Fall of Reach. This is not that and anyone thinking they were getting that book scene for scene in an animated retelling will be disappointed but that isn't 343's fault. What this did do though is bring a new facet to blue team in a new way and I found myself more emotionally invested in them than I had after reading Fall of Reach the book or the comic.",1446854400,6,2180,4.444723618090452
7414683,5,B014L2Y7EW,"Loved it. Right on par with forward unto dawn and nightfall, just an awesome screen adaptation. Deep story telling, my heart throbbed at points, hairs stood on edge at others. My only complaint is it's only 1 hour.. So so wanted more

Not sure why other reviewers are so salty about it.. Of course it's not as good as the book, but that's comparing apples and oranges. It's a motion picture adaptation. Producing such is a lot harder and more expensive than publishing books.

In my opinion, only having 1 hr to show us the story, they nailed it. Can't wait for more live action and/or animated Halo.",1446768000,2,600,4.546296296296297
7414684,1,B014L2Y7EW,This is just plain bad. I don't know why but they decided to change quite a few parts of the story. The source material for this was supposed to be the book Halo The fall of reach by Eric Nylund. This book is great on so many levels and the scenes that were changed were excellent parts of this book. Frank o Conner has been changing a lot of the source material to his liking and it needs to stop. 343 if you are listening check this fool in before he ruins halo.,1446768000,18,464,4.0

8731286,5,B014L2Y7EW,I don't think the feature is named properly since it very little to do with the fall of planet Reach but it gets a 5 star review from me anyway since it is a spectacular movie that basically outlines what is written in Dr. Halsey's journal. The name of the film should probably have been Dr. Halsey's Journal.,1522195200,,309,4.344827586206897
