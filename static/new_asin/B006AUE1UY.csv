8495835,2,B006AUE1UY,"On the 4th day of Christmas 2014 I'm going to review...ECW Fancam(04-13-2000). The Chilly Willy-Johnny Swinger match was pretty bad with quite a few botches to boot and the fact that action just didn't flow all that great. The Baldies-Roadkill/Doring tag team match was slightly boring to say the least. The Mikey Whipwreck-Simon Diamond match was also a dull contest. The Rhino-Kid Kash match while not bad,I wish it could have gone longer. The Chris Chetti/Nova-CW Anderson/Bill Wiles tag team match was not bad but it didn't click for the crowd. The Super Crazy-Little Guido match was short but sweet. The Lance Storm-Raven match was very dull & bland. The TV title match between Tajiri & Tommy Dreamer wasn't anything special either and it was pretty bad with too many outside interference to boot. The World title match between Mike Awesome & Tazz was also short but AWESOME! I give this card a 2 out of 10.",1418774400,,912,4.8152866242038215
