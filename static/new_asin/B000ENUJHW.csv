8111930,4,B000ENUJHW,"I don't know how the other reviewer can call this ""low in explicitness."" Or maybe he has a different definition of ""explicit"" than I have.

""Explicit,"" for the purposes of all of my reviews, means, simply, exposure of the genital region. And by that definition, this DVD has that in abundance. In fact I've been on a recent win streak with Peach DVDs which always are a roll of the dice when it comes to this kind of explicitness. Sometimes you get a lot, sometimes you get none at all. Other times you get so little that you end up frustrated. Not so here!

Jamie Lynn is one of the most generous Peach models when it comes to exposure, so we get to see long, lingering shots of her nude with legs spread proudly, from the front, from the back, from beneath--everywhere. Her name is on the front so most of the vignettes do feature her, although not all of them.

It's the normal stripping out of lingerie stuff that you expect from Peach (some of the footage can be seen in other releases...disappointing). Jamie is typically amazing and most of the other women here are hot too.

This in fact is so good that I almost gave it five stars, although it's not quite there. Not enough original footage or enough other models. But definitely a worthy purchase.",1383350400,,1257,4.475982532751091
8111931,3,B000ENUJHW,"Jamie Lynn is one of my favorite Peach models. She's great-looking and sexy, and considerably stacked. The problem is that of the 9 segments on PEACH OBSESSION JAMIE, she's only on 4 of them!! OK, so the other ladies on here (Jana Cova, Erica Jordan, Jessica Jaynes, Amy Ried, and Autumn Austin) are plenty nice too, but still I got it mostly to see Jamie. Of the 4 segments that Jamie is in, she's alone on 1 segment, and with one other lady on 3 segments in pretty hot but still R-rated girl-girl scenes. Most of the DVD, though, is the ladies stripping totally nude. I especially like the one with 2 of them shooting billiards and stripping. Run time of the main program is about 56 minutes. Bonuses are a 3-minute ""behind-the-scenes"" talking to Jamie and showing extra clips, a good slide show gallery running 2.5 minutes, and 4 trailers of other Peach DVDs. Overall, I like PEACH OBSESSION JAMIE enough to give it 4 stars, but I knocked off 1 star since Jamie is on less than half of it.",1343865600,,992,4.456043956043956
8111932,3,B000ENUJHW,"I buy a lot of these Peach DVDs because they are cheap and, while wildly inconsistent, always have some nice stuff in them. This one's ok.

You get the standard dance gyrating and stripping you expect in these types of flicks. Yes, Jana Cova and Jessica Jaymes are always nice to look at, but the scenes here were extremely tame, I thought. Jessica showed more in her Peach DVD, I thought, and Jana always shows more in her Hot Body (and definitely her hardcore) work. The only one who really goes the extra mile and offers some nice ""pink"" pleasures is Jamie - and she is hot.

Ultimately, I view these as those cheap, view once and toss (or re-sell) flicks, almost like a rental. You don't feel too bad that its kinda weak because you kinda get your money's worth. and hey, it IS hot chicks getting naked, so it ain't all bad.",1169596800,2,828,4.37012987012987
