8714739,3,B00X1FSSW8,"Being far from a Sabbath purist, I love the album Headless Cross and believe it to be one of Tony Iommi and Company's best!  This is captured during the bands subsequent album tour and though filmed pretty well, the sound is near terrible.  And I sadly wish that they would have performed more of the songs than just the two from the album itself, in Concert.  Forget Iron Man and Paranoid!",1505692800,,390,4.464788732394366
