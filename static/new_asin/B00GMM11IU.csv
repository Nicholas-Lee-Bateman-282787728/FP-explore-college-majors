6086775,4,B00GMM11IU,Monster Rancher: Season 1 is as good as I remember growing up. Sure I wish it was available on Bluray but still holds up well today. Only down part is that there are no extras to speak of but still I good classic Saturday morning anime.,1391299200,6,236,4.1521739130434785
6086776,5,B00GMM11IU,"Okay, I know this hasn't been released yet, but I like to share my opinion on this. When this was first announced, I couldn't believe it. I used to watch this series on Fox Kids when I was younger. I'm just so glad to see this being released on Season 1 Box set. I know that there are individual DVDs of this series, but I always prefer box sets of season 1, season 2, etc.

Now what do I expect to come of this Season 1 Box set?

#1. I am hoping that they have the Japanese language besides the English dub. I have a feeling that it won't be included which is going to lead to many arguments from other fans. Most of us prefer to have the Japanese language besides the English Dub.

#2. I also hope that this Season 1 Box set includes the uncut scenes. Take this scene for an example (from Tiger's Battle with Destiny):
[...] (Uncut Japanese Version)
[...] (English Dub)

The japanese version shows a lot of emotion & tension between Tiger and Greywolf esp. when Tiger knocked Greywolf out of the way when he tried to take the piece of meat. I don't know why that was edited out in the English dub. I think fans would have understood Tiger and Greywolf's brotherly bond better if that scene wasn't edited out. Just my opinion of course.

#3. No little logos such as TVY rating in the corner. I do find it a bit annoying when it comes to box set releases. The TV rating in the corner of the screen isn't necessary if you're watching the series on DVD. Isn't the rating of the series already on the back of the box set cover?

Well, no matter what this Season 1 Box Set comes with or doesn't come with, I'm still going to buy it. It'll be a nice addition to my anime collection.",1386633600,7,1677,4.192546583850931

6086799,3,B00GMM11IU,"Wasn't a bad show when I was a kid , while I myself will be waiting for the japanese version of these dvds to come out, I'm sure many people out there will enjoy this dub",1402790400,,170,3.75
6086800,5,B00GMM11IU,"Oh YES!!! I've been waiting so long for this show to come out on dvd like this! I love this, even now that I'm a adult still love it as I did as a kid when it first came out. This is a show that, in my experience at least, all ages can enjoy. I remember watching this with my older brothers when it was on Tv. It may seem like a kids show at first but it quickly grows up and becomes WAY more intense! If your having trouble finding a show you can enjoy with your younger kids or if you younger kids need a show that could get your older siblings to spend time together, give this a shot. Now, to wait for the next season. PLEASE BRING IT, IN FULL, NO SKIPPING EPISODES!!! WARNING: SPOILER AHEAD!! I NEVER GOT TO SEE TIGER AND GRAY WOLF FIGHT!!!",1395792000,7,745,3.973333333333333

6086802,5,B00GMM11IU,"This show is amazing...so much nostalgia.  The main character isn't completely useless for once and instead kicks a bunch of butt with his monster pals.  The characters are suprisingly well fleshed out especially the monsters.  There are some slight issues with the show itself (screwy sound and such, read other reviews) but it wasn't so bad that I would demote the product for it.  Watch it if your a fan of old stuff (Digimon, Medabots etc.) I promise youll like it!",1394928000,3,469,4.753086419753086
6086803,1,B00GMM11IU,There were multiple problems on disc 3 and 4 and disc 2 had a couple as well. It is really frustrating because I loved this show as a kid and wanted to have it so that my kids could enjoy it. I did not order from Amazon but from rightstuff.com and they sent me a replacement but it still had the same problems. I saw in another review that i am not the only one who has experience this problem. It is truly sad that the company does not do anything about it and is claiming there is no problem. I give the show 100 stars but only 1 for discs.,1394668800,2,542,3.891891891891892
6086804,2,B00GMM11IU,episode The great battle at sea on disc 3 has major pixel issues and audio issues and the company is aware of it and might not do anything about it. They say it's on their master copy and says that hulu has the same issue. Bad dvd release. Please send your complaints to discotekmedia.com to see if they will fix the issue. They could have easily have used the video footage from the vhs tape that was previously released to replace the damaged footage they were given.,1393113600,2,469,4.402298850574713
6086805,5,B00GMM11IU,"Deeper than most modern adult TV, Monster Rancher is a kids show that doesn't mess around or pull its punches (at least in the Japanese version I saw growing up), and unlike most monster shows with kids in, Genki is a total badass who fights side-by side with the monsters themselves. This is a story with a surprisingly deep and gritty backstory.

It's not often that a kid's anime comes along that is powerful, layered, and moving to the point that it makes me want to gush. Monster Rancher is something pretty special, particularly the super-rare unedited Japanese release. This is an incredible show, not least because of the amount that is hinted and implied rather than said. It has an awesome story and a perfect ending, I just hope that the box set does it justice!",1392940800,7,773,4.642335766423358
6086806,5,B00GMM11IU,"Monster Rancher (also known as ""Monster Farm"" in Japan) is based an series ""animal raising/battling"" simulators by Temco for the Playstation and Playstation 2. While it's easy to call it a ""Pokemon Knock-Off"", it actually has a lot more in common with Bandai's line of LCD Digital Pet games, Tamagotchi and Digimon. Though there is one defining thing that drastically sets it apart from those and that's being able to create monsters from various forms of CD-Rom media (and later DVDS), everything from music, to PSONE games, to even computer games can be read by the game and translated into a unique digital pet.

The anime is very good, focusing on a young boy who gets transported into the world of Monster Rancher and has to save the world from an evil fiend called ""Moo""",1392595200,10,776,4.7481481481481485

8624654,5,B00GMM11IU,"The whole entire first season of an very forgotten but underrated Pokemon and Digimon ripoff that never had much of a chance here in the US despite being a much different version of the original name, Monster Hunt but this was a fun series!",1501200000,,240,4.4772727272727275

8624658,5,B00GMM11IU,"This was such a cool cartoon as a kid. Back than, we loved monsters, well, the kind of monsters from the cartoon that is. I loved everything from this cartoon Monster Rancher, it had action, adventure, drama, comedy and cool characters in this. They had all sorts of adventures that were so cool, so many cool monsters. This is a piece of cartoon history gold here. I'd recommend this cartoon to any kids who love monsters in their own little world.",1455235200,2,449,4.555555555555555

8624661,5,B00GMM11IU,"I'm so happy that these FINALLY got released.  Admittedly, they aren't exactly ""high quality"" (in fact I'd say they are on par with VHS quality video wise), there are no sub-titles and no original Japanese audio, and the censoring done on a few of the episodes is still present...  But in all honesty, I'D RATHER HAVE THESE THAN NOTHING!!!  I bought all three seasons at once and the only gripe I have is that a couple of the disks (across all three sets... and I mean like 2 or 3) had some bad spots where one of the episodes on the disk would glitch for a little bit, but two of them my computer managed to play through though the video was a little garbled, and the third one I think I lost like 5-10 seconds of audio and video.  But other wise they all worked and worked well.",1419206400,,780,4.214765100671141
8624662,5,B00GMM11IU,"One of my favorite anime of all time finally came to DVD! And boy, was it worth it. There is SO much I could say about Monster Rancher!

My favorite things about Monster Rancher are the excellent dubbing, as done by the Ocean Group; while some content was cut for time or censorship (it aired on the Fox Family Channel, which was known to have done both), it was edited so well that i had no idea things were cut at all until very recently--and edits have no bearing on the quality of the dub itself. An especially well-voiced character is Tiger of the Wind, voiced by Brian Drummond.

Another favorite thing about Monster Rancher is the beautiful animation. This show was done by TMS Entertainment in their prime, and MAN does it show! Every frame is beautiful and crisp! Characters have soft outlines when it's raining or there's fire around, and the monsters' attacks are gorgeous!

My all-time favorite thing about Monster Rancher, though, is the story. Genki Sakura, a Monster Rancher champion, receives a special beta disk as a prize for winning a tournament. (Lest you think the show's too far removed from the games, the first episode essentially has him playing Monster Rancher 2, intro intact.) When he puts the disk into his console  and starts playing, he finds himself magically transported to the Monster Rancher world--and it's a world that needs his help.

The evil overlord Moo (get the laughs out of your systems now, folks) has been unlocked and is conquering the world by corrupting good monsters and changing them into bad ones. The only force that can stop Moo is the legendary Phoenix, who, it is said, can change bad monsters into good ones and defeat him. Genki sets off with Holly, her partner, Suezo, and his very own monster, Mocchi, to unlock the Phoenix and save the world.

But where the anime really shines is the personal connection. You bond with the humans and the monsters, cheer them on as they embark on an uphill battle, meet many friends and enemies, and grow as people. What's even cooler is that Genki fights alongside the monsters!

I love Pokemon, and I love Digimon, but my favorite 'mon' show is Monster Rancher.",1408665600,4,2158,4.708222811671088
