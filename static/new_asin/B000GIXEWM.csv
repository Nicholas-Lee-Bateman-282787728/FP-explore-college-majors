8132992,4,B000GIXEWM,It's a fairly cool movie brought out my emotions well enough. There is several flaws in it though. Her face shows the typical horror and flashes of brilliance. He looks like that poorly brought out character from a cheap and cr*ppy horror themed book. Several of the scenes don't align very well in the details. If you don't mind the fact it seems cheaply made then I do recommend watching it.,1504051200,,393,4.549295774647887
8132993,5,B000GIXEWM,"The film delivers as promised solid drama and mystery.  Plot is believable.  Acting is not that bad.  There is adequate suspense and tension to put you on the edge of your seat at times,  I don't regret a minute I spent watching the movie.

If you are offended by language, sexuality or violence you will not enjoy yourself.  On the other hand, if you are looking for a change of pace, give it a try.",1503792000,,400,4.266666666666667
8132994,1,B000GIXEWM,"""Murder Dot Com"" and ""Look @ Me"" are the same film. Tina (Elina Madison) likes to be watched, but under her terms. She models sexy clothing on an Internet program, but horrors! A fan wants to see more!!!! She rebukes the fan (Jeff Doba) who is off his meds and he kidnaps her....blah blah blah. Nothing new here. Script wasn't that great, scenes weren't that sexy, and the fan wasn't worth remembering.
