7796904,5,1568327900,"I first saw this program on my daughter's black and white TV when it was first shown on PBS.  Many years later, I searched for it on VHS with no luck.  I bought numerous dance tapes of Nureyev but had given up hope, when I finally found it on Amazon.  The tape is of old photos, but in remarkably good shape, considering the originals.  I am thrilled to finally have it.  All three ballets are delightful and the music is pleasure to listen to.  The Russian dancing in ""Petrouchka"" is spectacular and makes my knees hurt to watch those men doing squat kicks.",1378080000,2,558,4.368932038834951
7796905,4,1568327900,"This video is not only a tribute to Nijinsky but also to Nureyev.
I have seen this ballet in the 80's as I was young and I never forgot the exotic music and dance such as L' Apres-midi d' un Faune and the Stravinsky's masterpiece Petrouchka since then. There is also the most classical e known piece: The Spectre of Rose.
That is a pity the VHS version has not been remastered and transferred to DVD. Probably the new viewers will find the set production and the quality of the sound rather poor but those who appreciate a good dancer and variety of performances this is the video.",1248912000,10,581,4.388888888888889
7796906,5,1568327900,"We have no footage of Nijinsky (as far as we know) which is a crime.  Nureyev was the best of his time.  So Nureyev recreating Nijinsky's dancing (and his choreography in Faune) is about as close as we (getting close to 100 years after now) will ever come to seeing what Nijinsky did to change ballet.  I saw versions of all three of these ballets when I was a young adult and have loved them ever since, these are probably my most favourite ballets because they are so emotionally expressive and techniquely beautiful--and they all feature a male dancer which is refreshing.  If you want to see beautiful non-standard ballet, this is the tape to see.  I wish they'd converted it to DVD because my tape will disintegrate in not too many years and I will be without again.",1169942400,16,771,4.517985611510792
