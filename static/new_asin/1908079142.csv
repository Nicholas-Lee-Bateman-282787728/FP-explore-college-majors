7801192,1,1908079142,Too simple.  Just repeated characters.  There is more english then gujarati in the videos.,1468108800,,90,5.357142857142857
7801193,4,1908079142,"Pros: This is cute and keeps my 2-year-old's attention. He loves watching the animals and even repeats the words which are repeated. The main dialogues are in English, and when things are shown, both the English and Gujarati words are presented. The Gujarati is spoken by an adult's voice, and the Gujarati is spoken by a child, and there is enough repetition to help with memorization. The songs are catchy enough that my child sings them to himself while playing.

Only cons are: I wish it was longer. The vocabulary is pretty limited. The word for all the animals is given only in English (lion, elephant, etc) when introducing the characters. The songs are in English with only some words changed to Gujarati. The colors shown are not quite right... ""purple"" looks like pink, the rainbow colors are out of order, and instead of bhuro for blue, it has something else. The Gujarati is transliterated in English characters, so distinction between different Gujarati sounds is lost.

Overall I am happy with this since it's better than anything else out there, and we are getting a lot of use out of it.",1435190400,2,1103,4.769633507853404
