7914736,3,B00001TZ5U,"I was a bit skeptical at first that Aaj Ka Goonderaj could capture the feel of the Hindu generation it implies but was completely taken by surprise...and found it refreshing and captivating.  The cinematography was  first rate and Chiranjeevi's plotline is both mystifying and  satisfying...until the shocking end.  The film is both wonderful and  terrifying, wondrous and horrible.",958003200,,382,5.517241379310345
