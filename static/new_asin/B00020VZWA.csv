2053323,4,B00020VZWA,"This is the way that pilates should be taught.  The program is classical in nature, meaning that it follows the principles of Joseph Pilates, and therefore the order of the exercises are consistently the same.

It is repetitive for good reason and that is comforting, not boring.  It is therefore easier to measure your success.  Great way to work out at home if you aren't near a center that teaches pilates the way it ought to be taught.  If you aren't sure why it should be taught this manner with the exercises done in a specific order, remember that there is careful thought to the progression and to do it any other way is sacrificing safety and compromising mastery.  Keep it simple, and do this until you are ready for the intermediate dvd.  There are always more modifications to make it easier or harder, and this method is tried and true for well over 50 years--",1166400000,10,873,4.5576923076923075
2053324,2,B00020VZWA,"The ""head instructor"" (Carrie Clark) in this video has the most annoying delivery I've ever heard on a fitness DVD/CD... Her inflection is reminiscent of a melodramatic High School production of some Shakespearean play. It must be heard to be believed; but then, you'd have to purchase it.  There is a reason there are so many used copies for sale so cheaply here. There is one other segment led by a different instructor who is much better, but it's short (the Back Workout).

The exercises themselves are standard Pilates fare.",1128124800,8,529,4.866666666666666
8019725,3,B00020VZWA,"I have done pilates before and like this as a workout. You can pick from various workouts (to make it 20 or 30 minutes). However, I don't believe they give enough instruction for beginners during the workout. Yes, there is a separate guide section, but I like instructions during my workout so I don't forget. Therefore, I like stott pilates for beginners, but I do like this workout after you are a semi-beginner.
Also, if you want to work out your arms and legs, you need to purchase a magic circle.",1391731200,,501,4.516483516483516
8019726,2,B00020VZWA,"The instructor is annoying, but the worst part is the camera work.  The instructor clearly states which team member is the beginner example but they are very rarely seen.  When you do see the beginner person, you do see they are doing something different than the advanced examples who get shown much, much more.  I know very little about pilates, wanted to learn more, but am extremely disappointed in this ""beginner"" video.  I don't feel safe using this video as a learning tool at all. The back of the box does say the video has a Glossary with visual footage, but those are just still photos with a background speaker, not a video demonstration.",1347494400,,649,4.666666666666667
8019727,4,B00020VZWA,Good DVD BUT extremely expensive- not worth $90- very rarely is any DVD worth this price unless it's a rare item!,1339977600,,113,4.428571428571429
8019728,1,B00020VZWA,"Because this DVD is for BEGINNERS, I expected the DVD to focus on correct alignment, posture and technique.  Instead, there's an instructor who announces the technique and counts; two advanced students and one beginner.  The instructor struts around the room, barking out the count.  Her manner is as stern as a drill seargeant and her tone is as dramatic as a junior high school girl in her first play.  Yoicks!

As for the camera, it follows the instructor as she moves around the room rather than on the students.  In some cases, the students aren't even in view!  When the camera does close-ups of the students, it focuses more frequently on the advanced students than on the beginner...which would be okay except that this is a workout for BEGINNERS.

In the ""private instruction"" segment of the DVD, a still photo of the technique is shown while a narrator describes it.  Again, my complaint is that it shows the advanced posture rather than the modified beginner's posture.

I give this DVD two thumbs down and a big frowny face.",1267488000,3,1036,4.769662921348314
8019729,5,B00020VZWA,"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers about the instructors voice being annoying... at first. After using the CD a few times I realized she speaks that way for a reason. You get clear instructions on what you should be doing so there is no need to break position to sneak a view of where you should be. The CD is a real value in that you get not only the sessions but also movement by movement private instruction, in addition to a glossary of each movement and how it should be performed. I now understand what some of the other reviewers were talking about when they mentioned ""this is the way Pilates should be learned."" There is no rush from movement to movement but the importance of getting each movement done 'correctly' is really emphasised and you 'feel' the results. A must-have for your pilates library if you are just beginning or a little advanced.",1231286400,,872,4.490566037735849
8019730,5,B00020VZWA,"I have been doing Pilates off and on since 1997. One of the main problems I've had is finding classes nearby that teach ""classical"" or ""authentic"" Pilates. Over the years I have purchased a home reformer (the ""performer""), the box and pole, the half circle, two magic circles and a boatload of DVD's.
This is, by far, is the BEST Pilates investment I have made so far! I also take classes, and drive a good distance to get to them, and I have to say I've actually learned more from this DVD about some of the in-depth nuances of classical Pilates. Even though my classes are very good, this DVD is almost like having your own one-on-one training session. And it helps that I can stop the DVD and practice the correct way to do a movement until I get it right.
It offers several workouts including an excellent back workout that would also be beneficial, in my opinon, for anyone, but especially good for someone who is just beginning to exercise. It also has a short magic circle workout that is awesome and again, good for beginners.
But more than that, this DVD gives a plethora of tips and a short tutorial on how to perform each of the movements. If you really want Pilates to be effective while reducing your risk of injury, it's imperative that you learn the correct way to perform the movements and all of the nuances-- the C-curve, chin nod, articulation and imprinting, correct breathing, hugging the midline and working your abs at all times without arcing the muscles-- whether or not you intend to do classical (aka authentic) Pilates or one of the more contemporary versions.
As far as Carrie's voice, it not only didn't bother me, I enjoyed her clear diction and EXCELLENT cuing. She simply sounds like someone who has been well trained in theater, where you learn how to throw your voice, speak clearly and with inflection. She also paces back and forth just like my ballet instructor did when I was a young girl, which I thought added to the ambiance and helps with the whole Pilates/dancer kind of vibe that gets me in the mood to exercise, and makes me strive for excellence.
If you want to learn Pilates correctly, I can't recommend this DVD highly enough. My advice would be to carefully watch the extra tutorials and demonstrations on this DVD and you will be amazed at how much you can learn about Pilates and what a difference it will make in your workout!",1228348800,2,2379,4.573770491803279
8019731,2,B00020VZWA,"OMG, this lady is so ANNOYING that I could barely make it through the dvd once!",1226275200,,79,4.0
8019732,4,B00020VZWA,I like this DVD.  I take pilates classes.  When I am unable to go I use this DVD.  Since one is not always watching the tv every minute her voice inflections can be helpful.,1222992000,,173,4.029411764705882
8019733,2,B00020VZWA,"First of all, I must agree with the above review that Carrie Clark's delivery is about as pleasant as root canal.  (I honestly kept expecting her to put me on a time-out if I didn't do the exercise correctly,lol!)
I am a Pilates instructor, and while I respect the classical format, our lifestyles have changed dramatically in the 40 years since Joseph Pilates passed away.  Many people have needs and postural issues that could be made worse by using only the classical format, yet could benefit greatly from modifications and by changing it up.",1208649600,,546,4.797872340425532
8019734,3,B00020VZWA,"I also thought that the instructor was very annoying, and also very unnecessary. I did enjoy the workouts though, and I thought it was nice that there were 3 different people showing how to do the work out.",1176768000,2,206,4.447368421052632
