8529560,4,B008PX13TG,"Growing up, I have only occasionally heard snippets of traditional Chinese choral music, and have been trying to find some for a long time, without success. The musical style of The Dream of the Red Chamber (1962), while not exactly choral, is very close to what I have been looking for, and is generally a highly interesting experience. The story is taken from a snippet of an old Chinese novel, and this bit of it actually resembles ""Romeo and Juliet"" a great deal, depicting the difficulties of young lovers from different families trying to get married, with tragedy ensuing. The music is very melodious and pleasant, even when it bewails the cruelties of fate. I can only recommend the experience.

I have also had a chance to watch the 1977 movie version of the same story, and while it is extremely similar, it is actually not as good as this first version. The newer version has fewer and shorter songs, and one or two intriguing subplots have been excised. Go for the 1962 original, is my suggestion.",1360022400,4,1009,4.700564971751413
