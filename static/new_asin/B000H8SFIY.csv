True reading from The word of God married with beautiful, slow slideshows of watercolors.  I am grieved by the shallow, ignorant, and spiritually immature one star reviews of this series.  It would seem that the reviewers only watched 45 seconds of this 2 hour and 15 minutes video.  I have posted a short clip and photos of Adam and Eves nudity.  To claIm the images are vulgar and illicit is just plain ludicrous - they are barely recognizable as private parts and any child who has watched their mother breast feed or change a diaper already knows what these body parts entail. Simply placing a leaf over the ya-yas as one user so eloquently put, does not erase their existence.  The nude images are so insignificant they are barely noticeable and any childs imagination will do a much better job at fillIng in the details.  We have a 4 year old and 2 and a half year old and are absolutely thrilled with this series.  Give it a try and see for yourself its free!  This is the only series I would show my kids, it is just reading the Bible and watercolors, nothing more nothing less - just the way the Bible should be.",1526083200,,1509,5.822727272727272

8163069,1,B000H8SFIY,Waste of time. DO NOT SHOW THIS TO SMALL CHILDREN UNLESS YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH NUDITY. I was shocked when the story of  Adam and Eve came on and the figures had thier ya ya's visible.,1180483200,11,186,4.166666666666667
8163070,1,B000H8SFIY,"I was disappointed with this video as the animation is of poor quality and I was shocked that Adam and Eve were shown naked...my kids were watching it (ages 3 and 8) and they were in shock.  I usually watch movies before I allow them to see it and felt that I was let down by the title 'Children's Bible' when stark naked figures were shown.  Usually, cartoonists cover up Adam with branches and Eve with her long hair.  This was not so in the video.  The animation was slow and the story told by a narrator was boring.  The kids were bored.  I will not recommend this to any one!  It is a sheer waste of my dollars!",1174608000,29,616,4.126050420168068
