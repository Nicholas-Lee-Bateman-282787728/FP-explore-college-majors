8191210,4,B000PGTDI4,"Limited on details and not for beginners. For example, rather just playing the lick at the end of Nashville Cats, I wish he'd gone over it note-by-note. However, I love this guy's music and there are some great songs here. And John comes across as someone you'd like to jam with on the porchjust you, your guitars, a couple of beers and a sleepy old hounddog. Unfortunately, John sometimes changes the key from the Spoonful versions because he can no longer sing along in the original. By using a capo, he is able to demonstrate the correct chord formations while singing in a lower octave. He says it doesn't matter, but it does. Most of these songs sound much better when sung as originally intended.",1410393600,,702,4.624
8191211,4,B000PGTDI4,"One of the all time great song writers from the '60's!

Getting lessons from him is great, but I wish he spent more time explaining the chords he is playing.",1325980800,,157,4.233333333333333
8191212,5,B000PGTDI4,"John Sebastian does a nice job teaching these great songs while telling some short stories on how they came to be. You will enjoy this lesson if you are a big fan of The Lovin Spoonful.  The arrangements are easy to understand, but not so easy for a beginner.  Also, it will take some practice if you do not play with a thumb pick.  I wasn't aware that all songs would be taught with a thumb pick when I bought the DVD, though it is unfair to expect that the ad for the DVD would advise of such.  I already knew how to play these songs with a flat pick, but was looking to add spice to my playing of them.  Unfortunately, I have always played only with a flat pick, so I bought a thumb pick to try out the songs and I think I will eventually be able to learn these songs with a thumb pick, but learning the thumb pick style in conjunction with John's fingerpicking style will take some time for me.  A player who has experience in these areas might find this lesson too easy unless they simply want to see how Sebastian, The Man Himself, performs them.  That being said, this DVD is worth it if you want to learn thumb pick and fingerpicking techniques while trying to learn these hit songs.  All of the songs are played in open position, so you don't even have to know barre chords, which makes life easier for a player without barre chord experience. Give it a try, but practice, practice, practice.",1284940800,10,1401,4.260377358490566
8191213,5,B000PGTDI4,"I love the music; the instruction and arrangements were interesting and well within my novice grasp.  I love the kit (it contains both the DVD and the music) on several different levels; first it was fascinating to listen to John Sebastian talk about the origins of the songs, second, watching the DVD is rather like having a evening with this great performer, and lastly, it was really very informative; aside from playing the included songs you get a take away of techniques that you can use anywhere.",1277942400,2,503,4.781609195402299
8191214,5,B000PGTDI4,It's like having John over in your living room. His teaching is augmented with stories about the writing of the songs as well as hints as to what influenced the style.,1254528000,7,167,4.419354838709677
8191215,5,B000PGTDI4,"I grew up hearing these songs on AM radio. I 've played guitar for years
and had figured out some of these songs on my own, but still learned a few
playing tips from Mr. Sebastian. Almost all the songs are played from the ""C""
position. With the use of a capo you can find the key for your voice.
Speaking of voices, you'll be in for a shock when you hear John's voice.
Yikes! What happened? Most singers have to lower the key through the years,
but Mr. Sebastian's voice is completely shot. That aside, if you like these
songs you'll enjoy hearing John talk about there origins and how they were
written.",1183161600,13,604,4.307017543859649
