8179187,5,6303935036,I watch this video over and over.  The splendor of spending an hour with the words of N. C. Wyeth and listening to the five Wyeth children remember their father is magical. One can get the dvd from the Wyeth-Hurd Museum for about $40.  This is a must have for serious collectors and enthusiasts.,1295913600,12,295,4.444444444444445
