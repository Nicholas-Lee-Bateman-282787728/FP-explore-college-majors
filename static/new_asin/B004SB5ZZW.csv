4462225,5,B004SB5ZZW,"I found this to be another side of John Thaw, as a police detective Reagan, that really comes close to police work in the 1970's.  The period clothes, cars and customs was a nostalgic trip, if you lived it.  If you are younger I think it would be enjoyable to see what influence the 70's had on your parents. The UK brought fashion, movies and music to the US in the 60's and 70's.",1356912000,8,381,4.135135135135135
4462226,5,B004SB5ZZW,"Having just finished Life On Mars seasons one and two. I had to take the plunge. Not cheap, the set depicts a fast moving rather gritty british alternative to Kojak, McCloud, Columbo, ect. The Sweeney served as the inspiration for Life On Mars.
Fast moving ( for it's time ) you'll enjoy the car chases, roughing up of the bad guys, ect. Each show is fully independent
of the next. Some of the endings however; aren't quite the "" happy endings "" we've grown to expect. Lots of humor and british
slang circa 1970's. Though remastered, isn't quite up to the picture quality of the more modern shows. If you haven't seen Life On Mars you'll want to. Purchase the BRITISH release.",1349049600,6,676,4.549180327868853
4462227,5,B004SB5ZZW,"Did you?  what was law enforcement like in London in the 70s?  I'm sure this wasn't 100% factual, but it's a snapshot in time.  When you get tired of NCIS and CSI (wherever), and want shows with gritty realism, filmed largely on location, and the good guys don't always win a clean, clear win, a show with plot twists and turns, you'll love this.  ONE PROBLEM: they should have Closed-Captioned this show.  Yanks (like me) have a hard time catching every nuance of the UK slang involved in this.  I decided to watch this after watching the UK version of ""Life On Mars,"" which was closed captioned, and If there was ever a rough spot I didn't get, the CC would help me catch on in that series. If you can't get by that, get on yer bike, this ain't for you.  Otherwise: Get'cher trousers on, you're nicked...Enjoy!",1312156800,24,812,4.445945945945946
4462228,5,B004SB5ZZW,"I used to watch this series when we lived back in England.  It was an excellent series.  John Thaw and Dennis Waterman made an excellent duo.  Their acting was superb and the story lines were not far fetched.  If my memory serves me correct this show spawned a few others like The Professionals, but this was the best one of the lot.",1310083200,18,333,4.32258064516129
4462229,5,B004SB5ZZW,I bought this for my wife who is a big John Thaw fan. We both loved the Morse series and I found this earlier version of Mr. Thaw as a tough detective very enjoyable. Anyone who appreciates the acting of John Thaw will enjoy this series.,1306972800,25,237,4.173913043478261
8439601,5,B004SB5ZZW,"Been waiting for years to add this to my collection.  Has been totally enjoyable- man I miss the 70's.  Cars were mechanical and not computers, no one ever heard of political correctness, okay disco came along, every decade has baggage.

Anyways, spend the bucks.  Was disappointed that the complete collection didn't include the movies too",1424822400,3,340,5.127272727272727
8439602,5,B004SB5ZZW,"If you like British TV shows, this is great! It's gritty and realistic and a good mix of action and drama. The audio and video have been nicely cleaned up. There are a few things like seeing the same cars used in chases and the same thugs in different episodes you need to accept due to the budget constraints in producing a show like this in the 1970's. But all-in-all it is a very entertaining series.

If you watch much British produced TV, you will recognize a lot of the actors, some of whom are still around these days. Sadly, John Thaw is not among them. It was very sad to hear of his death not too long after the end of Inspector Morse. He was very good in several long running series.

If you are considering buying the whole set, you might want to check on the prices of the individual seasons instead. The only additional feature of the boxed set is the box. There are some bonus features for each season, including comments from some of the actors, stuntmen and others who were involved in producing the series. And some episodes with commentary.

Update: I just found out there are TV movies made after the end of the series that are not available anywhere that I can find. I would love to see those!",1424390400,3,1214,4.3628318584070795

8439607,5,B004SB5ZZW,I have long enjoyed John Thaw's performances and understood that The Sweeny was his favorite.  It is terrific. Each episode is dynamic but seasoned with humor.,1398729600,4,159,5.115384615384615
8439608,5,B004SB5ZZW,"I have the Morse series, The Lewis series and the Endeavour series. The English do it so well. Great entertainment. And you should see some of the clothes worn by the actors.",1392940800,,174,4.46875
8439609,4,B004SB5ZZW,"We loved John Thaw in Inspector Morse.  We learned of The Sweeney from friends, and wanted to see John Thaw in action at the beginning of his career.  We loved it.",1387152000,2,163,4.225806451612903
8439610,5,B004SB5ZZW,This set is so much fun. Had only known of john thaw from the morse show. This series is very different but equally delightful if less dark. Thaw was a terrific actor playing a hard nosed cop. Real ensemble acting with a period feel. I am enjoying watching this on the nights more often than not when there is nothing watchable on the television. Highly recommend.,1383955200,2,364,4.53030303030303
