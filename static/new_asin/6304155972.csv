796778,2,6304155972,"I saw this movie on the theater to see this Tim Burtons produced film, and surprise! the movie sucked, the music is based from the book and the book is based from Roal Dahl, but it was a tragic disaster, even the good music  and songs from Randy Newman(Toy Story, A Bug's Life) doesn't save the damn  movie, at least it's better than Tim Burton's previous film The NigthMare  Before Christmas.",929750400,4,393,4.507042253521127
796779,4,6304155972,"When I first heard there was to be an adaption of the book I was wondering, how on earth they'd handle a peach like that?
But they did it, and beautifully I might add. If they had handled it any other way I  just couldn't see it working as well. I'm not as happy with the ending.  Some aspects of it were just a little too convinient. BUT If one were to  disreguard that it was a fun movie great for all ages.",918518400,,409,3.9036144578313254
796780,5,6304155972,"Based on the novel by Roald Dahl, this movie is adapted from his book.  The film begins when four year old James Trotter (Paul Terry) loses both parents and has to live with his two vulgar aunts, Sponge and Spiker.  A  friend gives him green worms that would help him escape his cruel  guardians.  But they got away.  And James did too, when the dead peach tree  came back to life, miraculously.  He took a ride across the Atlantic ocean  to New York.  His aunts followed him across the sea in their Chitty Chitty  Bang Bang vehichle.  But the spider kills the Aunts in the end.  And James  lives in the peach pit in Central park from that day on.  One of the best  disney movies.  I wish that someone would release Song of the South on  video.",917222400,,744,4.268115942028985

But beyond that, I got bored and the plot never went anywhere. I ended up fast-forwarding through the last 3rd of the movie because I just wanted the movie to be over at that point. I'm an adult.

797579,2,6304155972,"A Tim Burton-produced Roald Dahl adaptation that does its best to capitalize on the success of The Nightmare Before Christmas via eccentric stop-motion animation. The love that seeped from every pore of Nightmare isn't here, however, and no amount of curious character design can account for that. It doesn't help that the Dahl story itself has been altered to suit a more typical film structure, stripping away much of the free-wheeling zaniness that made the book so unpredictable and entertaining. That can't have been for a lack of time, as the film is already dreadfully short: barely more than an hour, with some serious padding at both ends. The awkward blend of animation and live-action doesn't work especially well, either. Despite one great casting decision (AbFab's Joanna Lumley as the bone-thin, witchy Aunt Spiker), the flesh-and-blood scenes feel under-produced and B-grade, a sharp contrast to the more lush, professional efforts on the other side of the coin. At a glance, the quirky stylings that typify Burton's work seem a great match for Dahl's oddball stories. As a promo slick or movie poster, it's thumbs up all the way, but too much is missing to consider the whole effort as much more than a well-intentioned miss.",1474416000,,1241,5.058536585365854

798480,2,6304155972,"The 1961 JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH was among Roland Dahls better known childrens novels, but he did not believe it would make a good film and he repeated refused to sell the film rights.  After his death in 1990, his wife did exactly that and thereby proved that Dahl was right all along: while it wasn't a bad movie per se, neither was it a particularly good one.

The story, like most of Dahls works for children, is both extravagant and unexpectedly dark.  James (Paul Terry) is happy child with loving parents, and the family is on the verge of going to New York when his parents are somewhat inexplicably killed by a rhinoceros.  James is sent to live with his evil aunts Sponge (Miriam Margolyes) and Spiker (Joanna Lumley), who are brutally abusive.  One day, however, James meets a magic man (Pete Postlethwaite), who gives him a bag of magic ingredientsbut James accidentally spills the contents at the foot of a barren peach tree.  The tree immediately puts forth a giant peach, James discovers several insects living it, and they use the peach to escape from his aunts.

The movie differs from the book in numerous ways, mostly in terms of darkness; the filmmakers seem to be afraid of Dahls ideas and consequently soften them quite a bit.  Even so, they cant transform the story into sweetness and light, and many of the harsh elements remain.  But the real problem here is that the film is half live action, half stop-motion.  Neither are particularly well executed, they do not blend well, the script is non-descript, and the Randy Newman songs are immediately forgettable.

I love stop motion animation, but this particular movie is for children who aren't old enough to know the difference between good, bad, and indifferent movies.  The DVD has a few extras, but like the film they aren't worth writing home about.  At best, so-so.

798632,5,6304155972,"Roald Dahl had a rather grotesque view of childhood.  James and the Giant Peach is a sterling example of that.  The story involves a sad little boy who loses his parents to a rhinoceros, forcing him to live with his abusive aunts Spiker and Sponge.  When they aren't tormenting him............okay, they're always tormenting him.......James enjoys a rather fanciful look on life, helped by a passing stranger with a bag of magic green crocodile tongues.  The tongues escape and result in a HUGE peach growing on a dead tree.  The rest of the movie is an adventure in, on, and around the peach, held aloof by seagulls.

Love the music, written by Randy Newman (nominated for an Oscar).  The `animation' is fabulous (totally great that Jack Skellington shows up to fight the Centipede at the bottom of the sea).  It's a bizarre film but weirdly fun.",1417910400,,847,4.793103448275862

798830,5,6304155972,"James and the Giant Peach is based on the childrens book of the same name by Roald Dahl. This is director Henry Selicks first film after The Nightmare Before Christmas and already an improvement in the quality of the stop motion animation is evident. The film opens with a boy named James (Paul Terry) living happily with his parents as they picnic and plan to move to New York. Unfortunately they are killed by a rhino. This occurs off-screen, but it's also the only explanation ever given about their deaths. When James lives with his Aunts, they often use the rhino as a threat, making it more of an intangible representation of fear; not unlike the boogey man. James' Aunts, Spiker (Joanna Lumley) and Sponge (Miriam Margolyes) are cruel and grotesque. They beat and starve James while obsessing over their own vanities. Actually, they are far more disturbing than anything that James encounters throughout the film. When a mysterious traveler (played very theatrically by Pete Postlethwaite) gives James some magic crocodile tongues, they create the giant peach and James himself ends up entering it and meeting the insects. Together, they all decide to journey to the wonderful land of New York and escape James Aunts.

The characters that make up the insects are terrific. Theres the tough talking Centipede (voiced by Richard Dreyfuss), the French spider (Susan Sarandon), the wise Grasshopper (Simon Callow), the negative and depressed worm (David Thewlis), the sweet old ladybug (Jane Leeves), and the half-deaf glowworm (also voiced by Miriam Margolyes).

One of the first things to notice about this film is the way it blends live action and stop motion animation in a manner that's almost completely seamless. The first part of the film, being the opening scenes and those of James and his aunts, are done entirely in live action. The environments however, are spectacularly animated and picturesque. The neighboring town and ocean seen in the distance seems so much more vivid and peaceful than the dead, lifeless hill where James two Aunts reside. It's only when James enters the peach that everything, including James, becomes fully animated. The animation is incredibly detailed and nuanced; the characters can display a wide variety of emotions and movements that it's even a step up from The Nightmare Before Christmas only 3 years before.

I would argue that this film is much more established as a Henry Selick film than The Nightmare Before Christmas, which obviously retained a lot of influence from Tim Burtons designs and style (though Jack Skellington does make a cameo appearance in this film). In James and the Giant Peach, there are more bright colors and surreal images. The shark that attacks them in the sea for instance is not a typical shark, but a mechanical monstrosity that grinds up fish and shoots out their heads on plates. The best example however, is the Family song sequence. During this sequence, the insects sing a song for James and as the song progresses, the world around them becomes filled with moving colors and objects, floating around in the sky to the point where the very peach itself becomes part of a spinning mobile, which James then plucks from the background and takes into his hands. It's a highlight and the creativity and imagination at work here makes this entire film stand out as a great movie for children and adults to see. All the music is done by Randy Newman and with the exception of the song during the credits (the only one that he sings personally) it doesnt sound so typical of his normal musical style. Nearly every song is both catchy and memorable and all of them feel like they belong within the story.

James and the Giant Peach is a wonderful film and one of Henry Selicks best to date. There are some surrealistic qualities about this film but it always feels accessible and natural to the tone and visuals of the story. Even though this particular style of animation is more advanced and sophisticated now, as seen in more recent Henry Selick films like Coraline, this one still holds up very well in terms of sheer technical quality and great storytelling.",1397174400,2,4141,4.90299572039943

I checked the dvd that came with the blu-ray and the picture quality was the same. Very grainy and dark. So I took out my dvd copy from 5-7 years ago and the picture was much brighter and not grainy at all. It was ok for a dvd but it actually looked better than the blu-ray combo pack! Sad! I never returned it because the disc played perfectly fine. I just figured all the copies would be the same so why bother returning it. Wish Disney would fix this. They used a poor master to make the blu-ray and dvd combos from. Wasn't very clear at all. All their other releases on blu-ray look stunning.

The promotional poster/picture they show is NOTHING like the movie animation - the movie is nearly black and white - very very little color except the peach. The first 15 minutes or so are real people then it morphs into a Tim Burton typical cartoon-like animation. Blech. If it looked like the picture they advertise the movie with and had vibrant colors like that - mixed with typical Disney and/or Pixar animation it would have been a fantastic movie but no one wanted to watch it the way it is. I don't recommend. This version was creepy and the lack of color was depressing.

I know the live-action bookends are gauzy by design, but to have the color, contrast, and varying quality issues seen during the stop-motion sequences is just unforgivable. Disney needs to fix this disc. That said, the 5.1 audio mix is quite good and the stop-motion, if you can get past the flawed transfer, remains some of the most innovative and darkly charming work that I've ever seen. Worth picking up for ten singles or so, otherwise I'd regretfully recommend that folks give it a pass. Very hard to believe that Disney let this video transfer out the door.

799751,4,6304155972,"In recent years we have seen novels by author Roald Dahl receive an adaptation for the big screen.  From the 2005 film ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" to the stop-motion animated film ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" in 2009, back in 1996, another stop-animation film adapted from a Dahl novel, titled ""James and the Giant Peach"", was released by Buena Vista Pictures, produced by Tim Burton (director of ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", ""Corpse Bride"", ""Beetle Juice"", ""Batman"") and Denise Di Novi (""Heathers"", ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Batman Returns"", ""Ed Wood"", ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"") and directed by Henry Selick (""Coraline"", ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"").

The film would feature a cast of well-known talent which include actress Joanna Lumley (""Absolutely Fabulous""), Miriam Margolyes (""The Black Adder"", ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets""), Simon Callow (""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", ""Howards End""), Richard Dreyfuss (""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", ""American Graffiti"", ""Jaws""), Jane Leeves (""Frasier""), Susan Sarandon (""Dead Man Walking"", ""Thelma & Louise""), David Thewlis (""Harry Potter"" films) and Pete Postlethwaite (""Inception"", ""Clash of the Titans"").

The film is a live-action film in which the live action portions are used for the beginning and ending of the film but primarily utilize stop-motion animation.  The film also is a musical as there is a good amount of singing throughout the film.  Also, the film  is adapted from Dahl's movel, it's important to note that this film is easily accessible for children (although there are some scenes that may be a bit frightening for younger kids) but story-wise, the film is much more light-hearted than the original novel.

Originally released on VHS, the film was also released on DVD back in 2000 and with usual Disney re-releases taking place every 8-10 years, ""James and the Giant Peach: Special Edition"" receives its HD treatment with a 2-disc combo pack which includes both the Blu-ray and DVD edition.

VIDEO:

""James and the Giant Peach"" is a film that holds up quite well considering the animation was circa 1996.  The film is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:66:1).  The live-action portion of the film does show its age a little and there is a good amount of grain presented in the film.  The stop motion animation is well done and some portions are vibrant with colors and blacks are nice and deep.  Although a 16-year-old film, I felt the stop motion animation still holds up well today.

As for the DVD, the DVD is presented in widescreen (1:66:1) and is enhanced for 169 televisions and has been modified from its original version and formatted to fill your TV.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""James and the Giant Peach: Special Edition"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA and French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital. The lossless soundtrack is fantastic as the center channel is clear for dialogue, the fronts do a good job in showcasing Randy Newman's music (note: the film is also like a musical in which James and his friends are often singing) and with the film having its share of action scenes as the peach is rolling through the town or the group trying to survie in the ocean, there is a good use of the surround channels and LFE.

As for the DVD, the DVD is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound with French and Spanish language tracks.

Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""James and the Giant Peach: Special Edition"" comes with the following special features:

  * Spike the Aunts Interactive Game - New BD Exclusive! Inspired by the game that plays after the end movie credits, try your hand at spiking the evil aunts with the rhino and ring up major points!
  * Production Featurette - (4:34) A look at the making of the film featuring director Henry Selick and the cast of ""James and the Giant Peach"" who talk about taking part in the film and some being fans of the original book.
  * ""Good News"" Music Video performed by Randy Newman - (2:27) Presented in standard definition, the music video for ""Good News"" sung by Randy Newman.
  * Still Frame Gallery - With your remote, viewers can cycle through the various stills from the film.
  * Original Theatrical Trailer - (1:27) The original theatrical trailer and (1:25) ""Tim Burton's The Night Before Christmas"" trailer.

Note: On the DVD, all special features are included except the ""Spike the Aunts Interactive Game"" and ""Still Frame Gallery"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

""James the Giant Peach"" is a musical fantasy film that brilliantly combined a live-action story with stop motion animation when it was released back in 1996.  A film that would entertain not only children and adults but also bringing the characters from Roald Dahl's novel to life.

For many viewers today, it was wonderful to see how stop motion animation had evolved with another Roald Dahl novel to screen adaptation for ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" in 2009 and director Selick managed to achieve a major animated hit that same year with ""Coraline"" but in 1996, many wondered if Henry Selick and producer Tim Burton can pull of another hit with ""James and the Giant Peach"" like they did with ""Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas"" back in 1993.

Back in 1996, I've felt that Selick was able to successfully bring ""James and the Giant Peach"" to the big screen an come up with an enjoyable family film aimed at children but I also felt that ""James and the Giant Peach"", although entertaining, was short of being thought of as a classic and also despite being a stop motion fantasy film, I admit that at the time, I was comparing this film to ""Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and felt underwhelmed.

While other reviewers at the time felt that the live action segments took away from the film, I was more impatient when it came to the musical numbers.

Where a viewer hopes to be pulled into a film by its musical numbers, I felt impatiently waiting for the musical segments to be done and get right back to the storyline.  I don't think I enjoyed one song from the entire film and that's hard for me to say since I really do enjoy Randy Newman's music and what he has brought to many other films in his career.  I felt at the time that the musical numbers just took away the potential from the film which could have really used that time in developing the stop-motion animated characters and developing the characters even more.

With that said, it's nearly 15-years later since I watched this film and now this time around, I have a young son who can watch it along with me and because this film is targeted more for the children, I can get an idea of how the film would be appreciated by a child versus through an adult's eyes.

And sure enough, my son absolutely loved the film.  The concept of a boy and his friends riding a giant peach through the Atlantic Ocean and finding innovative ways of traveling captured his attention.  And through my son's eyes, he felt more confused during the live-action segments as he didn't understand why James' parents were killed and why would a strange man give him a bag of ""crocodile tongues"".  As for me, watching the film this time around, I actually enjoyed the live-action scenes much more because of Joanna Lumley's role as Aunt Spiker and Miram Margolyes as Aunt Sponge.  Creepy characters but as actresses, I am now familiar with their work and it enhanced my appreciation for the film's live action scenes a lot more.

As for the Blu-ray release, it's great to see this film given the HD treatment and as mentioned in my video review, the film does show its age just a little and there is a good amount of grain which will please most HD fans but for those expecting more features versus its 2000 DVD counterpart, outside of just a BD-exclusive game that can be played on your remote, there is nothing else that is new.  It would have been great to have a director's commentary by Henry Selick or even to have producers Tim Burton or Denise Di Novi chime in about the film many years later.  But unfortunately we are left with the original standard definition DVD features from 2000 and for a Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment release on Blu-ray, I was a bit surprised that nothing else new was included.

Overall, ""James the Giant Peach"" still manages to be a wonderful family film.  Granted, some children may be frightened by the pale and lifeless look at James' mean aunts but other than that, I'm quite confident that if my seven-year-old enjoyed the film, many children out there will enjoy it as well.  And also you do get that bonus DVD included, so if your traveling this summer, you have another DVD for those long commutes.

""James and the Giant Peach: Special Edition"" may not be appreciated by all grown ups but if you are looking for a new and fun family film for the family, definitely give this Blu-ray a chance!",1282003200,,8910,4.7964659685863875
799752,5,6304155972,"I was so excited about this release! GatGP seems to always be the movie everyone forgets, and I was so happy it was getting the Disney Blu Ray treatment... then I read a bunch of bad reviews about the transfer quality online and was too scared to pay the $20+ for it.  After renting it from blockbuster, though, I am proud to say that the nay sayers have greatly exaggerated, or maybe even invented, the transfer flaws.

There are admittedly a few scenes that look a little grayish and dingy, but my only explanation for that is that must have been the way Henry Selick envisioned it, because the rest of the movie looks absolutely stunning.  The live action and animation are equally beautiful.  I'm truly shocked that anybody could rate the video quality anything less than 4/5 stars.  I'm also disappointed in myself for not trusting Disney to deliver a quality Blu Ray release.  So far they are always on the money and take high definition very seriously.

About the extras, I rarely watch special features on any dvd release, so it doesn't bother me that the Giant Peach doesn't have anything new.  Hardcore fans will probably be disappointed by that, and understandably, but my biggest concern was the video and audio quality and since they both excelled my expectations I feel confident in my 5 star rating.

Overall, if you've never seen this movie before then buying or renting the blu ray is a great way to experience it.  I will say, though, that not everybody is crazy about the movie and since Disney doesn't want to hand it out out cheap, I wouldn't recommend getting it as a blind buy unless you just have to have everything by Disney.  If you've seen it before and know you'll love it, I think this HD upgrade is worth getting, probably even if you own the DVD.  Maybe 10 years down the road we'll get another transfer that will blow this one out of the water, but if so it'll be remarkable because I think this release is extremely faithful to the original look and feel of the movie while still offering the shiny perfection of 1080p.",1281484800,4,2052,4.561307901907357
799753,2,6304155972,"I'm sorry Disney, I know you've been spending the last 15 or so years vigorously trying to water down your brand and make everything other than Pixar films utter crap and direct to DVD, but when you make a BR ""Special Edition"" of a classic ""good"" film like James and the Giant Peach and then charge $25 for it, you'd better actually put content on the thing worthy of calling it an Special Edition.

That said this amazing movie looks great on BluRay.

Disney's decision to go extra cheap on the special features really make this a normal edition and not worth the full price. One thing that I've really liked about the Disney BluRay offerings so far is that they have always included fantastically informative and in depth making of features that go way beyond the basics. Sadly with James and the Giant Peach they are all but missing and the only features to speak of are some anemic poorly designed game and bad transfers of the original 5 minute TV/DVD/VHS featurette, and tired music video for Randy Newman's nice but nothing spectacular ""Good News"" track from the film, some stills and a trailer. Its sad to such a wasted opportunity to really explore this incredible film and rekindle the love and magic of the all to rare stop motion medium. As an animator myself I was really let down by the quality of this phoned in effort by the company that for all intents a purposed perfected the craft of animation.",1281312000,3,1414,4.58498023715415

He is forced to live with his evil aunts, Spiker and Sponge (Joanna Lumley and Miriam Margolyes). They beat him, starve him, and use him to do all of the work on the deserted island that they live on. Just as he reaches the pit of despair, having nothing to hope for, he is given a great gift by a mysterious stranger. A magical peach begins to grow, and with a group of new friends that James makes, he is able to face his fears and go after the dream he and his parents shared together: to visit New York City and The Empire State Building. Definitely a family-friendly movie, although there are some dark parts, especially with the orphaning of James and the evil treatment he receives from his Aunts (no worries...they get their retribution!).

It took 22 soundstages and 3 years to make it, and now it has been released in High Definition on Blu-ray for the first time. How does it look? There does appear to be a high amount of noise/grain that has been added. It doesn't really detract from the heavily stylized movie, but in some scenes it is more noticeable than others. The colors are vivid, and just like in the theater, the cinematography evokes a bygone art deco era. Sound is dynamic where it needs to be (especially the scenes with the Rhino and when the peach begins to grow!). Sadly, other than the game included, the rest of the special features on this disc are not in high-def.

AUDIO: English 5.1 DTS HD Master Audio * French 5.1 * Spanish 5.1

SPECIAL FEATURES:

* Games & Activities: Spike the Aunts Game. The goal is to score as many points as possible by ""spiking"" Aunt Sponge and Spiker with a rhinoceros as they spin around on a rotating wheel. It's a difficult game to get right, and I found myself bored very quickly. The Aunts don't even resemble the characters from the movie.

Special Features carried over from the previous DVD edition:

1. Production Featurette (4:34): A short look at the making of this movie. It truly is amazing how much work goes into a stop-motion movie; only 1 minute of useable film is produced in a week's time. Director Henry Selick thought that using stop-motion animation for the miracle world and then mixing it with live action at the end was a great way to bring Roald Dahl's novel to life. Actress Susan Sarandon (voice of Miss Spider) felt that this movie was ""empowering for kids, telling them that fears won't have any power unless you give it to them."" Jane Leeves (best known from ""Frasier"") was excited to do this movie (the voice of Ladybug) because it was her little sister's favorite book, and she often read it to her when they were growing up. Selick loved the book because like Dahl's other stories, it teaches children how to solve their own problems. Unlike other Tim Burton films, this one uses Randy Newman for the music.

2. Theatrical Trailer: shown here in a regular 1.33:1 ratio, it is interesting to hear the music from ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" underscoring it.

3. ""Good News"" music video sung by Randy Newman. This music video goes from 1.33:1 and low def for the Newman segments, and then up to 16:9 and high def when showing clips from the movie.

4. Learn how to take your favorite movies on the go: Disney File Digital Copy - a brief lesson on how to download your movies from the included disc to use on your computer and wherever else you wish to watch them.",1279756800,29,5045,4.886549707602339

799759,4,6304155972,"This is one of the darker clay-mated films that can be enjoyed by those who relish (or don't) in this sort of genre. Adapted by the famous children's novel by Roald Dahl, the story tells of James, whose parents were killed by a mysterious rhinoceros. He lives with two cruel aunts named Spiker and Sponge, who do nothing but verbally abuse him ever since he has moved in with them. On a typical summer day, James comes a cross a stranger who gives him a bag of ""crocodile tongues."" These tongues are important, as the stranger tells James that these will help him find happiness. Unexpectedly, James trips and falls, sending these tongues into the roots of a peach tree. Within moments, a particular peach grows until it becomes the size of a two-story house. With the aunts making money off of this strange phenomenon, James finds himself inside the core of the peach, where insects living inside have also evolved. A centipede, grasshopper, spider, ladybug, and earthworm become his friends. What comes next is a fantastic adventure, as James and friends are on their way (through sky and water) to New York City to find happiness.

The clay-mation here is wonderful. It's almost as astounding as the animation in The Nightmare Before Christmas. There's both beauty and ugliness (when required) all around. I've read the original Dahl novel, and it was nice to see these characters brought to life (though I expected the grasshopper to be a bit different than he was in the actual film). The songs here are quite forgettable; practically none of them are very enjoyable to listen to. But there are few songs here, so they're not too distracting. And finally, keep in mind, as little kids may be frightened at some creepy images such as the rhinoceros. This is still a lovely family film to boot. I can easily recommend it to anyone.",1255305600,,1834,4.7492163009404385

799843,4,6304155972,"Here's another inventive film, based on a book by the famous author of child books, Roald Dahl, who wrote ""Charlie And The Chocolate Factory.""

The animation, featuring stop-action stick figures, is outstanding, as are the colors. Each character is unique, like none I've seen before in other animated flicks. Not only the characters, but how they are dressed. (i.e. long gloves and stockings on a spider). The aunts in here are a real hoot to look at, particularly the one with the pronounced teeth.

The storyline is simple and there is absolutely nothing offensive. The only warning I would give is there is a bit too much violence for very small kids and the ending is a bit silly for adults.

This is a musical,  and the songs are nothing special. There are not a lot of them: five to be exact. In all, good entertainment and a good visual and audio film for a nice DVD system.  Boy, I'd like to see what this looks like on Blu-Ray!",1235692800,,937,4.520710059171598

799845,1,6304155972,"As a mother of two kids (ages 8 and 6), I have read nearly all of the Roald Dahl books multiple times in the past few years.  We all love his writing - his stories are usually quite dark and yet offer a lot of humor, warmth and love as well.  James and the Giant Peach is a wonderful story and well worth reading with your children.  Mind you, there is the usual dose of Dahl meanness and nastiness but it is great story with many wonderful characters, budding relationships, and ultimately a very happy ending.

I was thus incredibly disappointed when we borrowed this DVD from our local library.  The screenwriter took far too much liberty in changing things.  I found it crude and insulting to the memory of Roald Dahl.  If you have read the book, you know, for example, that the two horrible aunts are ""disposed of"" by the peach quite early in the story.  In this movie, the aunts live on and actually follow poor James and his friends to New York City.  Unbelievable.

Do read or listen to James and the Giant Peach (along with Matilda, the BFG, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) but skip this movie.  If you do want to see a Roald Dahl movie, you would be much better off with either Matilda or Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

What with so much talent coming into this project from the standpoint of writers, filmmakers, and the voices of some truly cool people, I guess I expected too much.

Talking about them makes me sound all whiny.  Am I being whiny? I dunno. What went wrong here? A lot. This animated behemoth of a production should have been darker in tone and content, and the brooding elements in the Roald Dahl book should not have been toned down just to strike out for a larger audience---which is I think what happened.

799925,3,6304155972,"This movie takes us deep into the imagination of Roald Dahl (the author of the original story) and it is quite a trip.

It's a story about James, a boy 8 or 9 years old, who, by a strange occurrence, finds himself orphaned and in the care of (prisoner of actually) his two evil aunts.  James' life is one of toil and suffering, but he holds onto his dreams and manages the best he can.

One day James encounters an odd gentleman who gives him some magic glowing worms.  These magic worms cause three things to happen: 1)A tree long thought to be barren produces a single peach that grows to an enormous size  2)Six bugs (a centipede, a grasshopper, a spider, a ladybug, an earthworm, and a glow worm (no relation to the magic worms)) grow to human size and are given the ability to speak, and 3)James is transformed into an animated version of himself.

James crawls into the middle of the giant peach, where he meets the six bugs, and they all become friends.  This intrepid group then uses the giant peach as a vessel ... first as a boat, then as a plane ... to escape from James' wicked aunts and then to travel to New York City (across the ocean from England) to fulfill James' dream of seeing the Empire State Building.

Quite a story ... with no lack of imagination, that is for certain.  But what ""James and the Giant Peach"" really has working for it is the decency of the character James.  He remains upbeat and hopeful despite his difficult circumstances, and this holds the movie together and keeps it on course.  The bugs are all right ... they're helpful and fun ... but they're always arguing with each other.  The bad guys of the movie, the two evil aunts, are pretty bad.  They look like ghouls and they act like sadists.  It is a very dreary situation indeed until our little hero manages to escape from their clutches.

I guess this could be called a musical, as there is some singing (of songs written by Randy Newman) and the songs are pretty good.  The animation is computerized and it is top-notch.  The actors and actresses who provide the voices for the bugs do an excellent job, and, like I mentioned already, there is no shortage of imagination (that is used) throughout the picture.  The final scene (in NYC) is carried out exceptionally well, and the ending is a happy one.

""James and the Giant Peach"" is entertaining and it is fun, but it is also quite creepy (and likely scary for young children) in parts.  This ""dark humor"" gives the movie and overall feeling that has ... creepiness and ... dirt in it ... and it holds the film back ... keeping it (I believe) from being the type of movie we would want to watch again and again.",1163030400,10,2661,4.425051334702259

800030,4,6304155972,"James (Paul Terry) is a kind-hearted boy who lives with his mean Aunt Spiker (Joanna Lumley, who is actually beautiful and a veteran actor) and Aunt Sponge (Miriam Margolyes, another veteran actor).  A rhinoceros, which we get to see a couple of times in this movie, took his parents away, according to his aunts.  James's aunts treat him terribly, but James is kind to his only friend, a spider (Susan Sarandon).

One day James is lamenting his life when an old man (Pete Postlethwaite, yet another veteran actor) appears and tells James that James has the power to change his own life, if he dares.  The old man provides James with a bag containing little green critters that do seem to have amazing powers, because when one jumps down James's throat he changes into an animated character.

James escapes his aunts into the peach, and it seems that no sooner does he enter the peach with its odd assortment of characters, a centipede (Richard Dreyfuss), a ladybug (Jane Leeves), a glowworm (also voiced by Miriam Margolyes), an earthworm (David Thewlis), a grasshopper (Simon Callow), and the spider, when the peach rolls over his aunts car and bumps its way to the ocean.  James is on his way (he hopes) to New York City!

Of course, James's journey is fraught with difficulties.  The first problem is escaping a giant iron shark.  Then the peach becomes lost and the companions must figure out how to determine which direction to travel to New York.  The companions have a thrilling and funny encounter with a group of ghost pirates as they attempt to solve their problem.

Eventually James and the others on the peach, now friends, reach New York, where they face even more challenges, and perhaps a place where they will find a new life.

I rarely call stories heart-warming because the phrase is over-used.  However, this story is just that.  When Tim Burton finds material that matches his style (not to overlook the contributions of director Henry Selick and co-producer Denise Di Novi), the results are usually excellent, and such is the case with this movie.  While there are a few tense moments that may make this PG movie unsuitable for extremely young members of the family, I think this movie is generally family friendly and will be one that most children will want to watch again and again.",1132099200,4,2307,4.775818639798489

The animation is clean and actually very visually relevant compared to any current stop animation movies. As far as the DVD is concerned, picture and sound quality excellent. The animation color and definition is absolutely perfect and clean.

The movie is a let down from the world I imagined.  Also, this movie is not suitable for adults.  It hardly held my attention, the songs are weak, and there is very little (if any) embedded adult humor.

800141,5,6304155972,"james (paul terry) is a nice and quite moral little boy who has two loving parents. while near the beach, he and his mom get killed (although this is not shown since it's a pg film) by a rhinoceros. yes this is a fantasy film in part and there are many magical elements in the film. james custody then is then taken over by two ugly aunts: aunt spiker (joanna lumley from ""absolutely fabulous"" fame) and aunt sponge (miriam margolyes)  who are classic examples of adults who abuse their children. they are the classic example of the trash and evil nature that exist in all wretched adults who seek exploit others
for their wealth. in fact, james's aunts use him as basically a slave to work around the house. they starve him and feed the breadcrumbs that are in the trash. they yell at him when james wants to make new friends and talk to kids who he can't
relate to. nah it doesn't get much lower than quality of life aunt sponge and aunt spiker have on james. one day a mysterious man gives james a mysterious bag full of crocodile tongues I believe, which he says are magic and can make James dreams come
true. In this case, James dream was to go to New York City and see Empire State Building. It was actually both James parent's dreams and James dream. However, even  though James parent's are long gone, James still wants to go to New York an accomplish the dream he and his parents set out to do. This is one impressive kid, he has a big heart and the kind of determination that almost no adults have nowadays. That's one lesson of the film right there , which is not to give up on one's dream, it's literally  embodied in this great kid.  So this special bag of magic combines with a small peach to grow into a gigantic peach which Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker capitalize for their own selfish profits!!!! Now if you think this made James's life any easier youd be wrong. Nope James's life continues as before, even wore as his rich selfish Aunt have become greedier and more manipulative and more vindictive. It's hard to believe that these ""aunts"" are the blood relative of James. Now before I go on, I couldn't help but think of James and Harry Potter. Sure Harry  Potter was an orphan, but he and James are taken in by their slimy relatives who basically want to exploit and abuse them without any rights whatsover. Potter eventually escapes his vile relatives and so does James. Potter becomes one of the most loved characters at Hogwarts and James also near the end (without revealing too much) becomes
one of the most loved kids in the world. Anyhow James interests in the peach grows huge to the point with the aid of the magic bad of tongues , James becomes magically converted to small size and invades the beach. Inside the beach, James discovers a group of zany characters all symbolizing common day insects who have now made James the center of attention. James meeting the characters of Mr. Grasshopper (Simon
Callow), Mr. Centipede (Richard Dreyfuss), Ms. Ladybug (Jane Leeves from Frasier), Ms. Spider (Susan Sarandon), learns that they have been watching him as he is mistreated by his aunts and know that James dreams of going to New York City. Eventually James learns that the characters not only want to go with him but they are going to help him
on his journey as well. This is a great movie about friendship as well. Let's face facts it's not likely James would have gone to New York on his own, but these group of wonderful friends give the help and encouragement to do it, when he needs it.
When James and the group decide on a plan to go to New York City, they're journey is stalled by several dangerous adventures which include a metallic shark, dead caribbean pirates, and the hazardous condition which threaten to end their journey. However that isn't stopping anyone and James and his friends, as a group are determined to make it New York and James is determined to make his and his parents dream come true....  As you can see you can describe the movie any better than better, and the movie itself is loaded with amazing special effects that elevate this entertaining fantasy world that James has now come into contact with. In fact when I first looked at the effects, I thought I was watching another classic fantasy film like in ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", and guess what both films were directed by the same great director, Henry Selick. I was success and an eye for greatness embodied in fantasy is a signature for
Selick. He really outdoes himself here.
Sony Imageworks and a trio of great animators provide the stop motion technology and animation that make the world of James and The Giant Peach so fantastic.  Speaking of fantastic the voice talents in this film are all great with Sarandon, Dreyfuss , Leeves, and David Thewlis as Mr. Earthworm are great, you can tell
that they captured the characters really well, but the person who outshines them is Paul Terry as James, he give's quite a performance and I couldn't think anyone better to do the role he did.  So as you can see James and The Giant Peach is far from being just a kids flick, it's that kind of stupid attitude that shows the true ignorance of so called critics who we'll miss out on the many meanings of films like ""James and The Giant Peach"". In fact  one critic even mentioned that the film brings up ideas by Karl Marx for example the relationship of the slave, and master which are true in some regard, but above this a film that really does capture the spirit of having a dream and not quitting until he or she achieves that dream, because as you watch the ending, you can see in the ending, that James's dream really affects many people, not just himself. I could go and on about how great ""James and The Giant Peach"" but I think I've nailed everything good about it, all that's left now is to recommend the film to those who haven't seen it.
DVD Details:
Ah, the DVD is excellent coming up with several extra features:

800142,5,6304155972,"I am really shocked that anyone could find this film ""horrific""!  It is far from horrific.  I think the aunts are the most entertaining part of the movie.  I guess you need a bit of a sense of humor to appreciate it.
It wasn't incredibly entertaining for my husband or me, but we did both enjoy watching it.  My five year old son, on the other hand, thinks that it is a movie masterpiece.  He has watched it about eight times in the week since he first saw it.  He loves to sing the songs from the movie.  He is moved by James' plight for freedom from the mean aunts and sympathizes with him as much as a carefree five year old can.  He finds the obstacles of James' journey with his bug friends very exciting.  He really likes bugs so I guess that a movie about a journey with giant bugs is pretty appealing concept for him.
I agree with a previous reviewer that the movie portrays a good lesson about facing hardships and overcoming them.",1078704000,14,940,4.265536723163842

800164,4,6304155972,"Roald Dahl's modern classic tells the story of James, an orphan who is treated cruelly by his aunts, until one day a benevolent stranger gives him some magical crocodile tongues -- and then marvelous things begin to happen! With new friends, James discovers that he is resourceful and loyal. He learns to believe in himself and trust in others.

This terrific story is given the treatment it deserves by director Henry Selick and producer Tim Burton (who also made Nightmare Before Christmas together). Stop-motion, live action and special effects combine to bring this incredible story to life, and the effort is dazzling, even though the work is almost a decade old.

The dvd features are marginal at best. While it's nice to have the option of DTS or Dolby Digital sound, the other features do not merit calling this a special edition. You can hear the dialogue in English, French or Spanish, and subtitling is available in Spanish or for the hearing impaired. There is also a 4-1/2 minute featurette, a trailer and a Randy Newman music video. Still photos are categorized as Concept Art (9), Puppets (9), Behind-the-Scenes (36) or Live Action (18), and they can be seen as thumbprints or enlarged. There are trailers for NBX, Toy Story 2 and Lady and the Tramp 2. Menus are a bit clunky.

I also think the Centipede is the best (of course) and I love how he and the spider constantly pick on eachother (there's a kissy scene at the end nothing...bad...but yeah know..it's kina different..I think in a good way...nnnyeah). Anyway, it's a good movie. I would like to read the book sometime and see how similar the characters are. Go watch it!

800166,3,6304155972,"This is a wonderful & amazing adaptation of Ronald Dahl's classic book. A definite addition to anyone's dvd collection. the story as you many know, tells of James and how his wish to get away from his evil aunts comes true in the form of a giant peach. James floats away to NYC in a giant peach being carried by a flock of seagulls and lots of sticky spider web. He learns to stick up for himself... that he really can make a difference, that he indeed counts!
The voice talent is great and the story ties up nicely at the end. Keep in mind, this Ronald Dahl, and anything can happen! =)
As for the Special Edition features.. There isn't much here. A still-frame gallery, a short making-of piece, trailers for the movie, and ""sneak peaks"" (more trailers) for other movies that are already out on DVD. I was hoping they would have at least included a director's commentary (which is most often 'standard' with the Special Edition designation) but no such luck. It is still worth owning of course, but just don't expect much in the way of Extras. This film is definitely worth the repeated viewings!! Go now & get it!",1025049600,19,1115,4.470588235294118
800167,2,6304155972,"This movie is boring.  This book is great...I really blame the same ole'-same ole' tunes of Randy Newman.  His music is C-level...think about all of the movies he has written for...the songs are really forgettable....and they all pretty much sound like ""Short People"" -- his lone hit in the 70's.  Not to make this a big ""I hate Randy Newman"" review, but music is so pervasive in movies even if we don't realize it.  Man, look at what John Williams did for Star Wars and E.T.  If you don't get chills when that music builds to a cresencdo, then you ain't listening!  Newman on the other hand, builds to a crescendo and we don't even know it...then we blame the movie for not being great.  Lokk at Monsters Inc.  (Newman again..and again forgettable...)  I think that another problem with the movies of this time was that they were so interested in getting ""big name voices"" and of course paying them and stroking their egos, that the movies suffer.  Burton had a big problem with this (Jack Nickolson , et al.) in Batman and he felt the movie would suffer.  He was right. I couldn't even watch Aladdin for a while because of all the Robin Williams hoopla (he was everywhere)  Now, I watch it and he is pretty okay. (of course the music is great...and Rice as lyricist is STELLAR...really listen to the words sometime..) James and the Giant Peach is another movie that is mediocre at best...I don't know what exactly led to its failure...",1019779200,,1437,4.5703125
800168,4,6304155972,"but it's not exactly worthy of the ""Special Edition"" distinction. Honestly, there really isn't a great deal of extra stuff here, apart from a somewhat skimpy art gallery, the obligatory trailers, a music video you'll probably watch exactly once, and a so-so featurette. Still, the video transfer is quite nice, and the bright, vivid colors practically pop off the screen.
I must say that I'm a little disappointed by the number of negative reviws here, but to each his own, I guess... to me, this film is beautifully surreal, and never ever fails to make me smile from ear to ear. Comparisons to Tim Burton's stunning Nightmare Before Christmas are probably inevitable, but really aren't fair. This is a far more lighthearted outing, colorful and fast-paced, but not nearly as ambitious or artistic as Burton's epic. Then again, it's highly doubtful that ANY stop-motion film will ever top the genius of Burton's lovingly crafted magnum opus. Stylistic similarities between the two films are definitely apparent (look for a cameo, of sorts, from Jack Skellington in the pirate ship sequence), but James and the Giant Peach, instead of feeling like a second-rate knockoff, manages to establish its own very appealing identity. It's the epitome of a storybook come to life, and makes for a highly enjoyable watch. Plus, any film that features the exquisite Joanna Lumley (of Ab/Fab fame) is fine by me.
Overall, a 5-star movie with a 4-star (well, 4 1/2, really) DVD that is wholeheartedly recommended for imaginative adults and intelligent children everywhere.",1003104000,2,1559,5.117647058823529
800169,2,6304155972,"First question, Joanna, why this? Stick to doing ""Absolutely Fabulous""---it suits you far better than this tripe.
Second question, Tim, is this supposed to even compare to your brilliance in ""Nightmare before Chistmas?""  Very dull by comparison, and visually bleak as well.
This effort is a little to high-strung for kids, and a little too (jest plain ol' dosh garn) stupid for adults.  There isn't the sense of humor that you had in ""Nightmare.""  Perhaps ""sense"" is the wrong word....""level"" is more precise.  At the same time, there is a sense of ""hurry"" within the movie that almost makes it seem like things were very rushed...animation, production, story line, etc.
If you're looking for good Tim Burton in this vein, get ""Nightmare"" instead.  Otherwise, stick to the greats like ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Edward Scissorhands.""
If you're looking for something to turn the kiddies into mindless zombies to get them out of your hair for (approx) 120 minutes, go for ""Chicken Run.""
If you're looking for something that Burton has painfully and repeatedly tried to imitate, get anything by the team of Rankin and Bass...preferably, ""Mad Mad Monster Party.""  It features the incredible Boris Karloff on vocals....singing songs of ""working ahead"" on your schoolwork to stay ahead of the game--- entertaining, educational, and inspiring for the kiddies. And, it is absolutely amazing stop-action stuff....same team that did the Rudolph and Frosty flicks that have been shown for the last 20 odd years.",1002067200,,1492,5.195833333333334

This is the sort of film where you realize that you are supposed to be entertained, but something isn't working. The whole thing is surreal and creepy, but there is far too much figurative language and imagery here - the thing screams ""the world as seen through the eyes of an idealistic child"". James' companions - Centipede, Ladybug, Grasshopper, Earthworm, Spider, and Glow Worm - are nicely characterized but completely flat parodies of the various social groups, but since most of the film is a passive journey, they have little to do but squabble. James faces a number of sophisticated dilemmas, including how to harness a flock of seagulls, and what there is to eat on a giant peach.
