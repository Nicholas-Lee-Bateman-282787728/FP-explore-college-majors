8608857,5,B00ES7TFRU,I love these and I'll keep my eye out for more every year. Past editions are great as well. So many great speakers and leaders and teaching to help people develop greater influence for greater purposes. I'm thankful they keep putting these on DVD so I and others who could not make it to the Summit can benefit from that gathering. I'm one who mostly waits until people sell their used one so I can get it more affordably but the wait is worth it if you have to go that route as well.,1457654400,,484,4.159574468085107
8608858,5,B00ES7TFRU,I have never been disappointed in the Willow Creek Leadership Summit.  This DVD of the Summit is an excellent video from leaders across the globe about the art of leadership.  I highly recommend this to people who are pursuing excellence in leadership.  The speakers are excellent and there is information you can glean from every speaker!,1397606400,2,339,5.017857142857143
