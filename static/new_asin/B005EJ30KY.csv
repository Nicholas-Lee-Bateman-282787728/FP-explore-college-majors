8468381,5,B005EJ30KY,"This long TV series is a drama of the reorganization of Japan at the end of 16th and beginning 16th centuries. There are high-qualitiy actors. Most produced by the Japanese side is VERY, VERY worthwhile to be seen, although several episodes does fit perfectly into the stream of time or appear fictious. E.g., the princess G seems never to have been a child.

BUT, the critique of the terrible English translation is justified. This film should be seen mainly by guys who understand Japanese. (Dr. Joachim Langhein, Heidelberg, Germany)",1351382400,,536,5.022471910112359
8468382,1,B005EJ30KY,"Translation does not make sense at all. Also, it includes only half of the season. I wonder who even got this DVD to amazon market. Totally defect product.",1332201600,3,155,4.571428571428571
8468383,1,B005EJ30KY,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS DVD! Though the video and sound quality is good, the English subtitles are extremely poor. I wondered if the translator even knew basic English? The subs didn't follow the contexts of the scenes or story. At certain points, the words and names were totally wrong! I would have to assume the Chinese translations/subtitles are just as bad. Also, this is NOT the complete series!

The return policy for DVD and CD apply to only items which are unopen or defective. Watch ""Go~Himetachi no Sengoku"" online where the subbing is better and understandable. My money won't be wasted if you do that!",1315785600,2,621,4.803738317757009
