7880129,3,6304904541,"This is an interesting, if not particularly outstanding low budget production from Corsicana, TX, made (I'm guessing, based on the godawful hairstyles and clothes) sometime in the late '80s, but not released to home video until 1990.

[BAIT-&-SWITCH WARNING: much like the Private Screenings video label, the hot chick on the cover of the video is nowhere to be found in the actual film, although she is at least credited by name - Traci Cannon - on the back of the box.]

It's not particularly gory or sexy (if that's what you're looking for), relying instead on premise and performances to carry the show. The former isn't all that bad (weary vampire seeks peace in a small town) and probably seemed relatively novel when this was made, though now with vampires all over the place, it doesn't seem so new. Unfortunately, the film is betrayed by amateurish acting (think better-than-average high school play thespianism) and some poor casting choices (the female lead, though an alright actress, is just dead wrong for the ingenue-ish part she's playing). The ""ironic"" ending is pretty lame, too.

Still, if you're into low budget obscurities like this one (and I'll happily cop to that), or are a vampire movie completist, then this might just be worth your while. There are worse ways to spend 90 minutes (like watching 3/5th's of any given ""Twilight"" movie).",1413936000,,1362,4.93886462882096
7880130,3,6304904541,"It's not actually the worst movie I have seen in my life when all is said and done.  Okay, so the acting isn't all that great but the plot is simple enough to follow.

Weary Vampire comes to town to sate his hunger in a small Texas town; Vampire then falls in love with a pretty local girl on the rebound, girl has an ex-boyfriend who is a Police Officer who quickly realises that girl's new boyfriend isn't your average run of the mill guy and then plot follows the usual Vampire bloodsucking rampage with friends getting it ""in the neck"" and the heroine not knowing which way to turn!

The special effects are none-existent, okay so the glowing red eyes aren't too bad but don't even try and put this in the league of Dracula 2000 when it comes to quality and budget.

This is a budget film with budget actors, most of who did not go on to make any other movies after this one.

All the same I've seen worse and it was good enough to watch when there was nothing else on TV and though it didn't scare the pants off me in any shape or form though it did make me jump once or twice, so not it gets stars for effort if nothing else!",1105315200,,1131,4.122727272727273
