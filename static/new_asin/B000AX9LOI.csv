8080018,4,B000AX9LOI,"This 1954 episode of Ed Sullivan's Toast of the Town features a special salute to I Love Lucy on the eve of the show's fourth season, as Ed pays an impromptu visit to Lucy and Desi, who try not to appear too natural. Vivian Vance and William Frawley drop by as well, and try to steal the show by doing an old vaudeville routine, while Desi belts out ""Babaloo"" and both pay heartfelt tribute to those who made their show possible.",1460160000,,429,4.308641975308642
8080019,4,B000AX9LOI,"I am a true Lucy and Desi fan, so I definitely enjoyed this video tremendously!  However, I only gave it 4 stars because this original airing of the ED Sullivan Toast of the Town episode was 60 mins long.  However, this video only shows 44 mins of the original airing. So sad!

Nonetheless, I still enjoyed all 44 mins!",1353888000,,319,4.372881355932203
