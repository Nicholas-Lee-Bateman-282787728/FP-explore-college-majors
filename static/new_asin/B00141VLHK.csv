3121771,4,B00141VLHK,This was fascinating film from an exciting 1st person perspective. Shamanism is a dying art that is the foundation of nearly all of todays cultures on earth.

3121774,3,B00141VLHK,"More about one person's quest, rather than the development and research of alternative medicine. This movie focuses mostly on preserving herbal knowledge. I think what he did was wonderful but the narration was dry and there are better alt. med. movies available.",1395446400,,263,5.285714285714286

3121776,5,B00141VLHK,"For those who have never been to Amazonia , this movie will give you a taste of the truly magical sense of wonder of being there . Having read Dr. Plotkins' book , and having also been fortunate enough to have spent some time in Amazonian Peru , this movie brought back many fond memories of this awe-inspiring place , and also put faces and personalities to people I already felt I knew somewhat from his book . This unique ecosystem is truly disappearing fast and everyone needs to see this film so they can understand the full importance of saving it . The jungles of the Amazon need to be experienced firsthand to grasp any real comprehension of what a life-changing experience can be had there , but this movie will certainly give you a taste . Very well filmed , and Dr. Plotkin is about as engaging as a scholar can be .",1376524800,2,827,4.341935483870968
3121777,2,B00141VLHK,"While watching this entire document, it was clear that the entire work was divided into subsections that always went the same direction - introduction about the magic of native practices, a quick demonstration, a 30 second spiel on environmentalism and saving the planet, and last but not least the perfect ending - a boastful anecdote on how the pretentious white american's actions somehow saved the life of the poor defenseless native tribe. This gentleman even went to the point of comparing the importance of his work to the bible.

I absolutely recommend this ""documentary"" to anyone that is looking for the perfect video full of self-absorbed comments and typical environmental rhetoric.",1345161600,3,694,5.252252252252252
3121778,5,B00141VLHK,Mark Plotkin narrates and guides us through this wonderful heart-felt journey to his teachers in South America's rainforests.  His impassioned argument for preserving and learning about the healing power of plants through shamanic knowledge is captivating.  A welcome introduction for anyone interested in an alternative medicine and approach to healing.  I cannot recommend this powerful film enough.,1315872000,,401,6.0
3121779,4,B00141VLHK,"I was thrilled to see how the medicine knowledge of the elders is being recorded and supported by people of great vision - Miranda Productions. It's a beautiful documentary of a place in the world where westerners are not only learning valuable teachings from elders but are providing the documentation and continued education of their own people. The circle of shared knowledge is a gift to all.
Thanks for making this interesting and well produced work of art.",1203897600,2,462,4.935897435897436
3121780,5,B00141VLHK,"I was pleased to see that Mr. Plotkin refused to divulge the information he gathered from the many Shaman to drug companies who were salivating at the prospect of cheap research done over millennia by indigenous people.  As it stands (under the GATT trade agreement)drug companies glean this information, synthesize the drugs, and sell them back to indigenous peoples whose rain forests have been cut down to satisfy other commercial exploiters.  Mr. Plotkin's plan to educate the Shaman as to the value of their knowledge (before any contact with commercial interests) is commendable.",1203465600,9,585,5.279569892473118
3121781,5,B00141VLHK,"""The Shaman's Apprentice"" is the remarkable documentary of Mark Plotkin's ethnobotanical adventures and work with shamans in the Amazon rainforest of Suriname.  The film is compelling for its insights into the ecology and people of the Amazon, both the indigenous tribes and the maroons--Africans who have adapted to the South American rainforest after fleeing slavery.  The Indians over generations have used plants to treat such illnesses as diabetes and fungal infections.  The maroons are able to treat sickle cell anemia and many other health problems.

The film is heartbreaking in documenting the loss of tropical rainforests around the world--over half have fallen to saws and fires in the past century.  The tribes and knowledge that have been lost are comparable to the destruction of many libraries.  Plotkin contrasts western science and medicine with the indigenous tribes that use plants in every aspect of their lives.

""The Shaman's Apprentice"" is my all-time documentary film favorite.  I urge you to see it!  It will change the way you think about the world.",1203465600,16,1076,5.2823529411764705

It is visually stunning, very informative, fast paced, and brings up very pertinent questions about cultural diversity and Western imperialism. It also touches upon the issue of bioprospecting, without mentioning the term. Most importantly it is very well edited. The Instant Video streaming made it easy for me to just rent it for a few days and show it to my class, without bothering to find the film in college libraries etc.",1424995200,3,595,5.144329896907217
