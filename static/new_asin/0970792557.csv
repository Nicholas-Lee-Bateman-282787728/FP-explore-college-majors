7798215,5,0970792557,"This 4-video set is the best documentary on Baby Doe, Augusta, and Horace Tabor I have seen.  The research for it was pain-staking and detailed, resulting in the publication of previously unknown facts about the Tabors in this video. Lots of vintage photographs and document reproductions from various historical collections enhance the videos.  There is also video of many locations as they appear today.  Accurate historical re-enactments add to the appeal of thes video set which is a ""must have"" for any serious student of the Tabors.",1030233600,,538,5.160919540229885
