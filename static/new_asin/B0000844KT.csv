7978866,5,B0000844KT,"This is an amazing series with an imaginative re-telling of Alexander the Great, with highly stylized artwork. This comes from the same artist (Peter Chung) that brought us Aeon Flux. If you're a fan of that series or animation in general, i highly recommend getting this set.",1410566400,,276,4.8936170212765955

7978868,3,B0000844KT,"This series had an amazing start: The first DVD shows that there is indeed potential for this re-invention of Alexander's story; while the second DVD built somewhat on the first's great potential, the series lost it's way in the third disc-little character interactions/exploration of emotional background, precious little story aside from the fighting and killing... The 4th and final DVD is frustrating, in that glimpses are given of what could have been a wonderful series, but all you get are glimpses: Alexander's interactions with Roxanne seem stilted and half-finished, his disgust for his mother is shown in maybe 2 seconds, his deep caring and attachment to his friends is almost non-existent. He suffers pain at Philotas' and Hephaestion's death for perhaps 2 seconds, none for Cleitus, and seems to be completely removed emotionally from everything and everyone-Alexander truly seems to view himself not so much as a person, but merely a tool of the Universe, and therein the problem: Alexander has been distant throughout the series, so his complete detachment from everyone does not seem too shock-while there is an slight underlying feeling of regret and sadness after Alexander destroys the world, and his friends, there is not enough of a contrast between himself ""regular"" and himself ""after he realizes he is ""Alexander""-he goes forward, he must"".
The major flaw of the series was that not enough time was taken to develop the characters, apart from perhaps Olympias, and Darius (please God!), who didn't need a lot of screen time... everyone else, you were given intriguing glimpses into, but always left just out of reach of ""connecting"" with. I think another 6 episodes, with a less accelerated story telling method, would have done justice to this unique vision of Alexander and his saga.
I do recommend the series though: frustrating and too-brief it may be, it is a bold, imaginative, and interesting take on a man who conquered the world in 10 years, died at the age of 33, and lived nearly 2500 years ago.",1061078400,5,2031,5.065671641791044
