These are actually not keepsake remasters, but just a quick and easy fix for a nice related subject package of classic movies for those who have seen some, and those who haven't seen some, all mixed up in four movie collection.
The only real tricky part is finding the right feature on non labeled discs, other than that, I wish there were many more collections like these with multi features in one package. Thanks TCM, I will buy more.",1299196800,12,674,4.625

In fact, the 2 Dracula films are presented on the exact same flipper disc that was released in the ""4 Film Draculas"" set a couple years back. Just figured I would go ahead and list this info for those people, like me, who are on board for a good upgrade of the films they love, but don't need it just for a new cover. This set would be best as an introduction to those who are just starting out in the Hammer Horror world, or if you didn't buy the previous DVD releases.

This type of disk is difficult, if not impossible to handle without getting prints and dirt all over.  I would be glad to pay a bit expra for 4 disks but doubie sided is a pain to deal with and usually results to damage on one side or another.  BAD IDEA IN AN AGE OF CHEAP MEDIUM.

4154663,5,B003M8NGG2,"in this TCM collection that comes in early September you've got a really fine set of double features to my mind . you have the first Hammer (color) british takes on Dracula ""Horror Of Dracula"" and its best sequel (in my opinion) ""Dracula has Risen From The Grave"" . in their proper aspect ratios and with subtitles . ""Has Risen"" is the third Christopher Lee Dracula picture after ""Horror"" 1957/58 started the series . Lee did not reprise the role until 1966 or so with the (not included) ""Dracula : Prince Of Darkness"" . next you've got Hammer's first Frankenstein picture ""The Curse Of Frankenstein"" circa 1957/58 and the Fifth (and series director Terence Fisher's personal favorite of the ""Frank"" pictures) ""Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed"" . for further critical reading and stills from the films i direct you to Eccentric Cinema . there again , the Frankenstein pictures will be in their proper aspect ratios and include subtitles . if you're fairly new to Hammer films you absolutely can not go wrong here .

4154728,5,B003M8NGG2,"I'm sure I've reviewed each of these classic movies individually but I've bought so many sets of Hammer movies that I end up owning the same films multiple times, so I may as well review this one, too.

All of the films are great but it is an odd mixture. You get the 1st Dracula and Frankenstein films and then the 3rd Dracula and 5th Frankenstein films are thrown in as well. There's no order to this at all.

Horror of Dracula and Curse of Frankenstein made Hammer the standard for gothic horror and each movie still holds up very well. Each movie has both Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. These are the foundations of what Hammer would become for the next 15 years.

Dracula has Risen from the Grave features Lee but no Cushing. Cushing wasn't in anymore Dracula movies until A.D. 1972. It is one of the better in the series. After the original, the stories became more focused on the characters and less on Dracula. In that regard, this may be the best sequel along with Prince of Darkness. The scenes at the Pub and with the atheist hero are all good material. Veronica Carlson plays a perfect, and gorgeous, damsel in distress. Lee doesn't have much to do here, but it's a great movie nonetheless.

Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed is a solid movie for the series, but I always preferred Frankenstein Created Woman. The story here is a little bit of a drag compared to some others in the series, but Cushing excels as the mad doctor anyway. One scene in the movie really stands out as extremely awkward. The rape scene. I'd be attracted to Veronica Carlson, too, who wouldn't? But it was completely uncalled for and the actors themselves were against it. There's no reason for Frankenstein to do that...nothing in any other movie portrayed him in that sense. Strange. Beyond that, it's a worthy movie and you might want to check out the Blu Ray release for a slightly better picture.

Anyone just getting into Hammer should check this set out. For the price, it's great. However, be warned that these are flipper discs. Two movies to a disc, one movie to a side. That is extremely disappointing. The discs will arrived all ready scratched due to the packaging and will be very easy to damage further just by watching them. I highly recommend buying each movie separately on a single sided disc.",1470355200,5,2301,4.602439024390244

For me, the Hammer films of 1957-60 were their best, with the exception of ""Dracula Prince of Darkness"" in 1966.  After the wretched ""Summer of Love"" in 1967, the look and tone of their films changed drastically...along with everything else in the world.  If you are a fan of post-modern hippie grunge, you will like the 1969 & 1970 films on this collection, ""Dracula Has Risen from the Grave"" and ""Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed.""  But my faves here are the 1957 & 58 ""Curse of Frankenstein"" and ""Horror of Dracula.""

The quality on these DVDs is wonderful.  Gorgeous color and clarity.  It's the first time I've seen HoD and CoF in over 30 years.  I've never seen them uncut, uninterrupted by commercials.  You know these must be great films when you can love them as a high school student and return to them 35 years later and discover what excellent productions they are all over again.

I grew up with HoD and CoF and took them for granted, seeing them on the late show Saturday nights...I thought movies like that would always be around.  Boy, did I dial the wrong number.

Seeing these again after so long was a wonderful trip down memory lane to a very happy time in my life.  And these English films, with their fine manners, meticulous fashions and excellent taste are such a relief from the ""urban"" ghetto culture that dominates television today.

If you already own these movies on other DVDs or DVD sets, I don't think this is worth getting because like another reviewer mentions, it is not really an upgrade in terms of picture and audio quality, but a decent quality set nevertheless.

Horror of Dracula
""Horror of Dracula"" may not be a faithful adaptation of Bram Stoker's classic Gothic vampire tale, in fact far from it, but it is a fine take of Stoker's novel. In this version, Jonathan Harker goes to Dracula's castle at the beginning under the guise of a librarian, but he actually knows what Dracula is and his purpose is to destroy him. Unfortunately, he is killed by Dracula and the vampire goes to London to prey upon Harker's fiancee, Lucy Holmwood [yes, they changed the names too], and later on Mina Holmwood, Lucy's sister-in-law. It is left to Van Helsing [Peter Cushing] and Arthur Holmwood [Lucy's brother and Mina's husband] to destroy the monster.

Christopher Lee, in his first portrayal of the evil Count Dracula, may not have much screen time, but he makes the most of the limited time he does have. His Count is sensual and evil at the same time - exerting a hypnotic effect upon his female victims that have them eagerly disrobing for the count's pleasure [and fangs:)].

Peter Cushing does an amazing job as Dr Van Helsing, vampire hunter and his commanding presence and determination to hunt down and destroy the monster that is Dracula is so credibly done that I was cheering him on all through the movie.

The female victims are suitably beautiful and helpless in the face of Dracula's charm and manipulations, and though this movie doesn't exactly scream big budget, I thought the production values were pretty decent - the vivid colors, the sets and scenery all enhanced the movie experience. There is a genuine atmosphere of menace that is effectively conveyed via the creepy score and sets.

Dracula Has Risen From the Grave
Though there are mixed reactions to ""Dracula Has Risen from the Grave"", I personally found it to be very interesting and thought-provoking. The story here begins with the little village in which Castle Dracula is located. It's been a year since the count's reign of terror ended, and yet mysterious events still plague the villagers. When the Monsignor [Rupert Davies] returns for a routine visit, he finds the villagers cowering in fear, including the Parish Priest himself [Ewan Hooper]. When the Monsignor undertakes to exorcise the Castle once and for all, events transpire differently - an unfortunate cut on the Priest's head proves to be the nourishment that brings the Count back to life, though the Monsignor remains oblivious of this fact, returning to his own village. The Count and his now faithful servant, the priest follow hot on the Monsignor's heels, bent on revenge - the target being the Monsignor's lovely niece, Maria [Veronica Carlson]. It's left to the Monsignor and Maria's atheist boyfriend, Paul [Barry Andrews] to save Maria before it's too late.

The production values in this movie were actually quite good - the sets, the score, and cinematography all enhanced the storytelling and made this movie very dark and menacing [the cellar under the inn where the Count is forced to reside looks very authentic].

The acting was good - Christopher Lee returns as the Count and this time, he is really mad and bent on revenge, with more screen time and dialogue to convey his anger. His lust for his prey is convincingly portrayed as usual and the female victims once again fall hopelessly under his spell, baring their necks in anticipation of the Count's 'embrace'. Rupert Davies is also strong in his portrayal of the Monsignor and special mention needs to be made of Ewan Hooper's fallen priest. His guilt and conflict comes across as genuine, and this was one aspect of the movie that made it really good for me - the corruption of good by Dracula, and the test of faith in both the Priest and also the atheist Paul.

The Curse of Frankenstein
""The Curse of Frankenstein"" (1957) is one of Hammer Films' best productions, with the great horror talents of Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee to entertain viewers. This also happens to be Hammer's first color film and the first in their Frankenstein franchise. Though I prefer my favorite horror actor Cushing as the ""good guy"", I think he excelled in his role as Frankenstein, not only here but in the other films as well. In ""The Curse of Frankenstein"", Victor Frankenstein (Peter Cushing) is in prison awaiting execution for the murder of Justine (if I'm not mistaken, Valerie Gaunt has played one of Dracula's brides in another Hammer production), a maid in his home. He is narrating his story to a priest via flashback; as a young boy, the intelligent, confident and wealthy Frankenstein forms a close friendship with his tutor, Paul Krempe (Robert Urquhart), and the two become partners in the various medical experiments thought up by Frankenstein. One of these experiments involves bringing a dead dog back to life, and Frankenstein is so ecstatic at his success, that he decides to create life itself in the human body, by piecing together different parts of the body. Paul Krempe finds this an abomination and refuses to participate, and is on the point of leaving, when Elizabeth (Hazel Court), Victor's betrothed arrives at the Baron's home. Paul realizes he cannot abandon Elizabeth in the hands of a maniac, and tries to shield her from the horrors of the Baron's experiments. The full horror begins when the creature of Frankenstein's making comes alive and unleashes havoc.

This movie is wonderful for various reasons - the sets, score, and costumes, not to mention the ghoulish manner in which Frankenstein procures the various body parts lend a truly macabre feel to the movie, infusing it with a high sense of Gothic horror. The acting by the cast is simply excellent - Cushing shines as the egotistical and maniacal scientist, and Lee (though almost unrecognizable, but not quite) is believably creepy as the monster (no lines here, but the horror is all too evident in the expressions on his face). The others, especially Krempe as played by Robert Urquhart, enhance this horror drama with their credible acting. An excellent horror movie in all aspects, this is a true Gothic classic, and a must-have for fans of classic horror.

Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed
With a title like ""Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed"", my initial impression was that this was going to be one of those over-the-top horror features that are quite characteristic of Hammer Films Productions. That opinion was soon revised after watching this movie, a perfect blend of drama, suspense, and great acting, especially by the talented Peter Cushing (one of my all-time favorite actors in the horror genre). Here, Cushing portrays the manic-obsessive Baron Frankenstein who flees from a scene of horror, only to visit his evil upon a pair of hapless lovers, a young doctor (Simon Ward) at an insane asylum, and his fiancee (Veronica Carlson), who makes the unfortunate decision of renting a room in her boarding house to Frankenstein. The pair are soon blackmailed to aid the nefarious Baron in his illicit activities, whilst the authorities try to track him down.

There are many chilling scenes in this movie - memorable ones such as the scene of a petty thief breaking into Frankenstein's lab, only to find himself facing a scene of indescribable horror and in mortal danger. There is also, disturbingly, a scene of assault in this movie involving a female character and the Baron, which I was quite taken aback by (definitely not a typical role for Cushing who always seems gentlemanly even when portraying 'monsters'). All in all, this is a well-made, atmospheric horror movie starring the great Peter Cushing in a monstrously evil role. A must-have for fans of classic horror.",1380412800,4,8468,5.0761494252873565

I previously reviewed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frankenstein-Must-Be-Destroyed/dp/B0001FVE5O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed</a>, and encourage you to head on over to that product's page and read my review. ""Dracula Has Risen From The Grave"" is perhaps the high water mark of the Lee Dracula movies. Both films star legendary ""Hammer Girl"" Veronical Carlson. In the 40s, Universal Studios had Evelyn ""The Screamer"" Ankers. Decades later, Hammer had Veronica. Both films are textbook of examples of films that mix non-stop tension with gothic atmosphere and superb character development.

""Horror of Dracula"" and ""Curse Of Frankenstein"" were excellent and effective first steps for the Hammer Horror franchise. In all of the Frankenstein movies, the real monster is Peter Cushing....and he plays the role with megalomaniacal glee. Universal owned the rights to all of their monsters' makeup, so don't expect a bolt-necked Boris Karloff or Lon Chaney lumbering about. In ""Curse,"" the monster (played by Christopher Lee) basically looks like Christopher Lee pushed through a wood chipper. In ""Destroyed,"" it's a normal guy with a brain transplant...because this movie's raison d'tre is to show you just how freaking crazy the good baron actually is.

I'm convinced that when it comes to reviews of Hammer Horror films, the people who read them are less ""newbies"" and more Hammer fans who want to see what other fans have to say.
