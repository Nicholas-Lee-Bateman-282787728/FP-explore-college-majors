I just watched it and loved the story line. I was on edge every minute not knowing what was going to happen next.  The mystery of  inheriting a building to finding the Jazz Club, to telling the story of the old Jazz Club was suspenseful., sexy, witty and fun, going from one era to next. I don't want to say too much to give it away but I would recommend watching this  movie. You can see as you are watching  the movie that an enormous amount of writing, life experience,  imagination,  creativity, and attention to detail went into this movie and the music is, wow the music!  Let your imagine go when you are watching this.....",1382054400,,778,4.244897959183674
