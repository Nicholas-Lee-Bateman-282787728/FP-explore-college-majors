7871624,3,6304443005,"This volume of the ADVENTURES OF BATMAN AND ROBIN series exemplifies the creativity we have seen in Warner Bros. animation during the end of the twentieth century. ""Heart of Ice"" explores the urban legend of Walt Disney's interest in cryogenics and produces a media magnate so obsessed with immortality that he enlist Mr. Freeze's help. ""Fire from Olympus,"" featuring Maxie Zeus (a deranged criminal who believes he is the ancient god) depicts Batman's Rogues Gallery as other members of the ancient pantheon. These programs bear repeated viewing, because they have rich concepts executed well.
That said, this tape offers a poor value, because it is not record in SP mode. You will get fuzzy sound and picture. This series deserves better packaging.",1003017600,2,750,5.155737704918033
7871625,4,6304443005,"This video was released when Batman the Animated Series was re-marketed as The Adventures of Batman and Robin.  So what you get is the second episode of the series featuring Mr. Freeze instead of the far superior ""Heart  of Ice,"" because Robin appears in this one.  It's a decent episode,  with a not-so-subtle wink at the urban legend that Walt Disney had himself  frozen.  Amusement park creator Grant Walker wants to become like Mr.  Freeze so that he can live forever.  Still, the tragic figure of Mr. Freeze  comes through intact, when Freeze tries to show Walker that immortality is  not all it's cracked up to be.
The other episode, ""Fire from  Olympus,"" features second rate Batman villain Maxie Zeus, and the  video actually makes him a better villain than his many years in the  comics.  The episode's backgrounds, including a Greek Pantheon built atop a  skyscraper, shows just the sort of detail that made this series special.",962582400,5,938,4.848101265822785
