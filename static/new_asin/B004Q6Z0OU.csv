I cannot find a replacement anywhere, and when I try to buy a digital version they will only let me use a special player for it, and won't let me just buy a file to play as I wish.",1426204800,,249,3.7169811320754715
8437966,3,B004Q6Z0OU,"This has some similar step moves toThe Last Step DVD. I am a former step instructor, and current PT. I did not like how quickly she changed moves- her cueing did not keep up. I also did not like the overlap with her other DVD and the rotations are a bit much on knees.  (She may call it something else, but same move)

I do like Petra's personality, but wish I had not bought this.",1364083200,4,381,4.066666666666666
