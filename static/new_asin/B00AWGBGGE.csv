8558339,3,B00AWGBGGE,"Sammy (Jordon Hodges) is the class spastic at a high school where everyone must look like they are 25. He is bullied until the point he goes Columbine on them. His sister (Gracie Denton) tries to get him to stand up for himself, yet every now and then she forgets her lines and calls him Timmy. Sammy goes to a mental institution and five years later, the kids, who still look 25, start to die.

Perhaps the best way to think about this film is as a spoof of the 70's and 80's films of High School revenge, because clearly as a stand alone film, it doesn't past the smell test. The acting was bad, dialouge predictable, and the shower scene a question mark as the girls wear bikini bottoms while in the shower.

The ending, i.e. the identity of the killer, was clearly a spoof as no one in their right mind would write such an ending.
