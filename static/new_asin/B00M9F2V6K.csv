8670887,5,B00M9F2V6K,"Hollywood couldn't have scripted a more beautiful story.  Sue Duncan is one of the most extraordinary, admirable figures in the history of Chicago education.  Many identify her as the mother of current U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan.  However, after watching this film and discovering the educational roots established by her extraordinary passion and dedication to teaching, one quickly realizes the more appropriate fact is Arne is the son of Sue!  Her modest, yet unwavering commitment to doing whatever it takes to help children reach their full potential through academic and social adjustment is legendary, and long precedes her eldest son's tenure in education and politics.  Sue Duncan quietly transformed the lives of THOUSANDS of children over 50 years.  Students who attend the Sue Duncan Children's Center continue to beat the odds and exceed expectations.  This is an AMAZING story and I am proud to say I WENT TO SUE!!!",1410393600,,942,5.24
