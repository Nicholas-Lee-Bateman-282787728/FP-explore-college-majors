2922049,4,B000UJ48RW,"This film showcases three major Hollywood names: Burt Lancaster, Chuck Connors and Virginia Mayo. Yet from the Amazon listing you would never know it, unless you look carefully at the cover image. Instead, a list of four totally obscure names (has anyone heard of John Alderson, Rudolph Anders, Leon Askin or Paul Bryar?) is given as the supposed roster of actors. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated example. It might be of interest to some potential buyers that one of the biggest names in Hollywood history is the star.

It's not a great movie, certainly, and other than Burt Lancaster, the other two stars are perhaps not the most glittering from Hollywood's pantheon. But to see the macho, bare-chested Messrs. Lancaster and Connors cavorting on an isolated South Sea island is definitely entertaining, and I'm delighted that this film has finally found its way to DVD.",1187740800,22,877,5.006849315068493

2922054,5,B000UJ48RW,"This is simply a fun movie, ... as only actors of the caliber of Burt Lancaster, Virginia Mayo and Chuck Conners  could do. I wish I had looked to see who the woman was that played the French ""madame"". She was also great. It was also interesting to see Paul Burke as the young, prim naval officer who seemed to be playing the ""straight"" for practically every other character in the movie. The stilted role seemed to suit him, a type of character he never seemed to evade the rest of his career. I think the movie was well made and met its intended purpose as a comedy, not to be taken too seriously, and I enjoyed it very much.",1411430400,,627,4.225

2922056,5,B000UJ48RW,"I enjoyed the movie, I enjoyed the humor in the movie, and the actors and actresses in the movie. I hadn't seen Chuck Connors in any movie or show older than the T.V. series ""the Rifleman"", so this was entertaining watching him play in a different role other than as Lucas MCaine in ""the Rifleman"".",1395619200,,298,4.4363636363636365

2922058,4,B000UJ48RW,"The movie's plot is ridiculous, but it is entertaining.  I enjoyed watching it after so many years.  I had seen it in the theater as a kid.",1312848000,,139,4.111111111111111
2922059,5,B000UJ48RW,"What can I say. This is a thoroughly splendid piece of World War 2 Hollywood blarney. It is pure escapist entertainment released for the family audience of post World War Two America. ""What did you do in the war Daddy?"" was a question often asked in those days following the war and a lot of kids whose fathers were Marines in WW 2 must have wondered if thats what it was like too.

As history or serious fiction it is bilge. The trial is all about protecting of a friend. Burt is like ""The Crimson Pirate!"" in a Marine Sergent's Uniform trying to save the brash and dopey Chuck Connors from a fate worse than death i.e. Virginia Mayo, the Bar Singer he met with the heart of gold. Add a supporting cast of Warner Brother castaway character actors and there you have it, an Irish stew of a movie!

The ending is action packed and injects some meaningful pathos befitting the time and setting. The improvised, nearly suicidal mission against the Japanese in a boat full of colorful characters is an act of personal redemption, patriotism, heroism, and sacrifice all wrapped into one, and all men, Veterans or not, had to love looking at Virginia Mayo and laughing at the stupid love story. It's all fantasy of course but it does not insult or hurt anyone.

You should see this once anyhow. It is certainly great escapist entertainment in the Hollywood tradition. It was no miss TV when I was a kid.",1231891200,11,1397,4.513833992094861
8213377,4,B000UJ48RW,"The oddly-titled ""South Sea Woman"" (""Sarge O'Hearn"" would've been better) is not remembered as one of Burt Lancaster's classic films, but I have always gotten a kick out of it.  The story begins at a court martial hearing for Marine Sgt. O'Hearn (Lancaster), who is refusing to testify.  Hot blonde Ginger Martin (Virginia Mayo) takes the stand and sets up the story in flash-back, starting in Shanghai, China.  O'Hearn goes into a saloon to collar P.F.C. Davey White (Chuck Connors), who has just proposed to Ginger, his ""baby.""  A brawl ensues, and soon the trio are adrift in the East China Sea where they are taken aboard a fishing junk.  After more adventures, they wash up on a Vichy France island, where O'Hearn soon is enjoying the pleasures of the local ""hotel"" and French girls.  The plot thickens because Davey only wants to  marry Ginger and forget about WW2 which has just broken out, and O'Hearn is determined to get them into it.  Opportunity surfaces when a disguised German yacht docks and unloads radar equipment.  There is an exciting scene when O'Hearn grabs an MP-40 and massacres the Axis forces who fall into a stream amidst lots of gunsmoke.  O'Hearn arms the yacht, gathers the unwilling Davey (with Ginger stowing away), frees the Free French, recruits some expatriate barflies, and sails right into the middle of the Pacific war.  The movie returns to the courtroom where the hearing officers are cheering on O'Hearn's exciting deposition like it's a football game.  ""South Sea Woman"" blends comedy, adventure, and patriotic heroism in an entertaining movie.  Oddly, the b/w production misses the opportunity for Technicolor that the South Sea story cries out for.  Arthur Lubin, the creator of ""Francis the Talking Mule"" films and ""Mr. Ed"" on television, directs a talking parrot.  Burt is handsome and macho, Virginia is young and delectable, and Chuck is gangly and enthusiastic.  Burt even gets knocked out by a swinging mast boom like Curly Howard.  Music by David Buttolph loves ""The Marines' Hymn.""  A good movie for guys, but women might like it too, especially when Burt strips off a frilly nightie to reveal his beefcake build.
