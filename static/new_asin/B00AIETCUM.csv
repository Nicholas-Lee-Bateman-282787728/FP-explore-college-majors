8552160,5,B00AIETCUM,"This is simply a delightful movie, filled with quirky characters, gentle souls, and a deft sense of humor, yet it is also possessed of profound insights into human nature. The plot is simple: an assassin develops an unwanted  friendship with a would-be screenwriter. In the end, both have to decide if they will betray the other. Along the way to that point are a lot of laughs and sweet, yet not saccharine, moments. It is infused with movie history, and the writers and directors clearly love cinema. An especially fun scene is the killer describing his mother's  life using the titles of movies.

It really is the kind of movie American creators once made, but in the current chase for next biggest explosion or most shocking-est moment ever, it is something forgotten and deemed not worth doing (financially, at least) by Hollywood. Frankly, I'm not sure Hollywood can even do something like this anymore.  Luckily for us, some folks in the world still know how to make a funny, touching and smart movie that leaves the viewer not only entertained, but thinking about more than explosions and special effects. If you love movies, do yourself a favor and watch La Comedie Humaine.",1412985600,,1183,4.841584158415841
