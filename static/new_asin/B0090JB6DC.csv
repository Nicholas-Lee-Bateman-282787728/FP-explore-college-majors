5200990,3,B0090JB6DC,"This was a movie that I wanted to love.  It was funny, but not hilarious.  It just fell short, particularly after how relentlessly it was marketed.  It will be best seen with a large group of people, either in a theater or at a party.

Sandy Patterson (Jason Bateman) is a businessman in Denver with a growing family and a job he needs, but is undervalued.  He takes a risk and changes employers, and all seems to be going in the right direction until he is told that his credit cards are maxed out and there is a warrant out for his arrest.  To save his family and job, he goes to Winter Park, Florida to track down the identity thief, intending to bring her back to Colorado where the police and his employer can fix everything.  But when his plan goes awry when he confronts ""Sandy Patterson"" (Melissa McCarthy) and must go on the run with her to avoid even more unsavory characters who want to catch her.

There are moments when this is a VERY funny film.  There are also moments when it wants to be and fails.  And then there are a number of half-funny moments.

The real problem is the identity thief herself.  The more the audience gets to know Melissa McCarthy's character, the less funny the film is.  I'm not used to a comedy that loses laughs as it progresses.  Additionally, there is barely any explanation of exactly why others are chasing her.  There's a vague reference to their motivations, but nothing that is ever developed (or develops into anything satisfying or funny).

The bottom line is, it was marketed as a big-laugh comedy, and the laughs are not frequent enough.  I don't know that I would recommend it for a full-priced theater ticket.",1360022400,11,1664,4.511705685618729
5200991,5,B0090JB6DC,Because it seems funny and it makes the audience want to laugh I love it and I can see it way more times now,1356652800,6,108,3.5416666666666665

5201254,4,B0090JB6DC,"Sandy Patterson is a corporate accountant in Denver Colorado. All round nice guy with a loving wife, Trish, and two young children. One day, he tries to use his credit card at the gas station and is declined. Apparently, he is over his limit due to his excessive purchases in Florida.

That's just the beginning of Sandy's problems. He's even temporarily arrested in Denver due to an outstanding bench warrant in Florida. To make a long story short, and to make it right with his boss, Sandy heads to Florida. In a stroke of genius, he realizes from one of the illegal purchases that he knows where the thief will be on a certain day and time.

His plan: to cart the thief, Diana Budgie, back to Colorado for charging. The police have given him a photo of the mug shot taken for her latest Florida arrest. As he's packing his bags, Trish tries to talk him out of the trip: ""Don't do this. This is not who you are. You're not Batman.""
Sandy holds up the mug shot: ""She's not dangerous. That number right there's her height. It's Hobbit height.""

It turns out Diana is a LOT more than he can handle. Add in two gangsters Diana cheated and a tough-guy skip tracer, and there is never a dull moment.

""Identity Thief"" premiered in February 203. It was #1 at the box office two of its first 3 weeks. It is a comedy but for the first half of the movie, the comedy is muted due to Diana's basic amoral nastiness. She is an astoundingly gifted and believable liar. When desperate times call for desperate measures and Sandy and Diana are forced to work together against the people chasing them, it morphs into a buddy movie.

I laughed out loud several times, and I liked the non-Hollywood, or maybe only semi-Hollywood, ending. Recommended viewing.

5201257,5,B0090JB6DC,"When I first watched this, I thought it was okay, but I later ended up watching it a second time and ended up loving it.  Maybe it grew on me, I don't know, buy I thoroughly enjoyed this.  While this is a bit of a dark comedy with some action and a road trip vibe, the general subject is a serious one showing how it easy it is for someone to steal your identity and destroy your life.  Melissa McCarthy, the main actress, talks about that in the behind the scenes featurette included in this DVD.  She was ready to cut up all her credit cards when she realized how dangerous identity theft is in general.",1480809600,,605,4.189655172413793

5201259,5,B0090JB6DC,"I rarely write reviews about movies, but this is one of the funniest movies I've seen in YEARS and I just had to comment. My favorite actors are starring in this movie - Jason Bateman is, as usual, just adorable playing the straight character or the everyday guy. Melissa McCarthy is a hoot and even when she's not trying she has me crying with laughter. I loved this film and own it in every possible format and in Amazon Video and Ultraviolet streaming outlets. It is a WINNER and I sure hope Bateman and McCarthy get together again!!!",1479600000,2,537,4.489795918367347

5201274,2,B0090JB6DC,"There's something to be said about a story of a woman who defies Hollywood stereotypes but this is a situation where the storyline fell flat.

The star of the film is a rotund, unapologetic, brash, virago whom makes a living off of creating counterfeit credit cards by way of convincing white-collar investment executives to give up all of their personal credit information including their social security number.

That, in and of itself, is far-fetched, but you never get the sense that she actually knew enough to even get a victim to give her their phone number.

This leads to her lead victim whom has to travel to Central Florida, bring her back and have her to convince his boss that he's not some deadbeat credit scammer.

In between, there are superfluous car chases, bar room trysts, and excessive profanity that doesn't fit in any of the moments - nothing here screams situation-dependent.

This movie's a dud. I wish the screenplay was as intriguing as the plot.",1477872000,,973,4.837349397590361

The cast is pretty good even the small parts have such comedic talents as Elie Kemper, Jon Favreau, Ben Falcone, Eric Stonestreet and John Cho. Honestly, I think it must be the script as the only laughs I really had were the battlin' prat falls when Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy got into physical confrontations. The movie is also way too long but then again we watched the longer version on the DVD vs. the theatrical cut so maybe that's why the two hours went slower.

The extras feature a pretty boring 50-second gag reel and a Making Of that was actually more interesting than the movie itself.",1468886400,,639,4.556521739130435

I wish Milessa would have had a few more incredibly funny moments (easy for her), but it probably would have killed me from laughing.

When I read other reviewers say how much they ended up liking her and how moving the movie was, twenty minutes into the show I was still thinking - NEVER. But they were right. The motel scene makes it impossible, to me, for this to be a movie for the whole family to watch. There are a few crude jokes here and there, but that scene is... well, you'll have to see it for yourself. Definitely worth a watch. I've seen it four times : )",1453766400,,560,4.242990654205608

A regular Joe (Jason Bateman) goes to extreme lengths to track down the person who stole his identity (Melissa McCarthy). Hes got nothing to lose and a bad credit rating to settle!

What did I think?

This flick is very hit and miss and suffers from a few pace problems especially early. A handful of lighter moments peppered with ridiculous humour save Identity Thief  from being a lost cause, though. The chemistry between Bateman and McCarthy definitely deserves a mention; McCarthy in particular is a delight to watch on screen.",1423958400,,549,4.870967741935484

All that being said, this was an hysterical movie, both Bateman and McCarthy are very funny, and a couple of small roles from actors we've seen in great tv comedies really round it out.

The comedy was great, and the small dramatic scenes were also well done.

My only complaint would be that with such a funny movie, there was a bit more graphic violence than I expected/appreciated.
I'm not opposed to movie violence that is integral to a good story, but I don't appreciate graphic violence in an otherwise hilarious movie. Maybe it is sexist of me, and I had this same issue with her appearance in 'The Heat' but I just cringed at the amount of violence on a woman in a movie that is meant to be a comedy. And I'm not just talking about the simple slapstick, which she is genius at.

Overall I loved this movie, have watched it several times and crack up every time.",1421193600,,1088,4.452261306532663

Then there were the investigators and his new boss who would not listen to a word he was trying to say about his identity being stolen.  Not at all how this goes in reality.  Ya, I said it, reality.

Melissa's characters always do things real people do.  She sings off-key to the car radio.  She flips people off.  She lashes out when her feelings get hurt.  She's real!

Identity Thief is priceless.  I rarely laugh out loud at movies, but this film cracks me up.  The interplay between the two main characters is absolutely wonderful.

5203247,4,B0090JB6DC,"Identity Thief
 Comedy is king with Identity Thief leading the pack in a big way this weekend with the Zombie flick Warm Bodies in its second week coming in a distant second.  Fans of Bridesmaids came out to the multiplexes to see Melissa McCarthy again.  And boy were they glad that they did.  McCarthy is to my mind the greatest practitioner of physical comedy working in the craft today.  She is hilarious.  In one of her best bits she simply lip-syncs to a series of current pop tunes.  It is this simple, effective, brilliant comedy that we have missed in this sad era of foul mouthed comedy.  Not that this is a G rated film.  It is rated R for all the usual reasons, language, adult situations and simulated sex between large people.
 McCarthy has the advantage of a very funny script by writer Craig Mazin.  Mazin also wrote such popular, if grossly improbable, hits as The Hangover pt. II, and both Scary Movie 3 and 4.  He knows how to write the laughs and McCarthy knows how to make them work.  Director Seth Gordon also is an experienced contemporary comedy craftsman.  Gordon directed the clever but unexceptional Horrible Bosses and the excellent Four Christmases.
 This might be the best acting that Jason Bateman has done thus far in his very active career.  He has the pleasure to play the straight man to Melissa McCarthy.  Amanda Peet has a small supporting role as the wife of Batemans character.  Multi-talented Jon Favreau, who is best known as the successful director of the magnificently popular Iron Man and Iron Man 2, has a plum if small role as the evil corporate head at Batemans work place.
 Melissa McCarthy is the Identity Thief in the movies title.  She tricks Bateman into divulging his personal information over the phone.  That info allows her to access his credit lines and effectively bankrupt him.  With no reasonable response from the Denver cops, Bateman flies off to sunny Florida to capture the thief and return her to Denver for arrest.  The result is a road trip, almost a buddy movie that combines humor with violence.  The thief skips out on a court date which puts a skip tracer on her trail and her crossing a drug lord adds a couple of mob hitters as well.  In between running from her pursuers McCarthy is seduced by a stranger in a bar.
 There is a satisfying character arc to the thief that I appreciate.  At first the thief is a totally repellent sociopath, wrecking peoples lives without turning a hair.  By the end of the film, she is less so.  The production values are excellent, as we would expect in a major studio production with a budget of $35 million.  This very funny comedy brought in just about that much over the three day week end.  I saw it in a theater full of laughing people.  Laughter is what we want in a four saw blade comedy and we get plenty.",1415836800,,2820,4.555776892430279

5203353,3,B0090JB6DC,"Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy (Jenny's cousin, in case you didn't know) team up in this road trip comedy focusing around the identity theft.

Sandy (Bateman) is a financial accountant with an extremely important jump for little pay or recognition. In fact, his boss gets his name wrong even though he's worked there for many years and degrades him to no end. Sandy decides to join a start up company to start making the money he deserves. Bad timing intervenes, as his credit cards and ids have been stolen by a professional con artist/identity thief (McCarthy). She goes on major shopping sprees (a Fiat, jet ski, several rounds of drinks for an entire bar, etc.) and quickly ruins Sandy's credit. Because the Denver police cannot work with the Florida police (which seemed extremely absurd by the way), he flies down to Florida to confront her and bring her to Denver to answer for her crimes.

 Because they both have the same identity, they realize flying is out of the question. Instead, they drive the entire way and meet up with a strange cast of characters during their journey.

This movie did have its laugh out loud funny moments, but it was definitely pushing the envelope timewise. It ended just short of 2 hours total. They should have looked for places that could have been cut, like when they were being chased by 2 separate groups of people. Seriously, 1 wasn't enough? It was OK for a few chuckles the first time around, but not something I'd want to watch again.",1412208000,4,1486,4.703846153846154

5203424,2,B0090JB6DC,"This was neither Jason Bateman nor Mellisa McCarthy's best work by a long shot. Both are much funnier than this movie.

The whole film felt like the two stars were being held back and forced into a script rather than let loose to perform it as well as they could.

There were moments that were absolutely hysterical. But those moments were snippets of funny that didn't really gel with the rest of the film.

***SPOILER ALERT***

The plot is decent enough at the concept level, but the execution is horrible. There are bad guys chasing McCarthy for half the movie who simply disappear. There's a crime boss who's got all kinds of power who wants her dead who just disappears from the plot. Neither are explained away. They just stop being part of the movie. It looks like it's just horrible editing.

The interactions of the main characters is just so unbelievable that it makes the movie hard to accept at all. Mellissa McCarthy is a horrible person who steals peoples' identity but everyone decides to love her at the end for no apparent reason. It's so odd that you can't buy into it as a viewer.

Don't get me wrong. I watched this movie and don't feel that my life was robbed of 2 hours. I laughed a few times. But I never need to see it again. I watched it on HBO so I didn't pay specifically to see the movie. If I had paid for this movie by itself I'd be much less happy.",1409616000,2,1379,4.346303501945525

I though that Identity Thief was hysterical and found that both Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy had great chemistry as well as great humor. The movie is about a guy whose identity is stolen and the law pretty much doesn't do a damn thing as it was done from out of state. Jason's character(Sandy) is forced to go hunting for the perp who is guilty of stealing his identity and throwing his perfect little life up in chaos. When he finds her, he must bring her back to his own state before the law will do anything and the road trip begins. I found the chase fun, the situations they get themselves in hysterical and I truly believe this is one of the better comedies out there.",1395360000,3,811,4.266233766233766

These two have such a great rapport and it was very well written.  Both of them are very funny but Melissa McCarthy is hilarious! She is not just a great comedic actress but she has no problem doing dramatic scenes. She is also great on her show Mike and Molly. My kids 19 and 22 also loved this movie.  It is a very smart comedy.  Highly recommend.  She is also amazing in Heat with Sandra Bullock.,1394236800,,545,4.142857142857143

5203937,4,B0090JB6DC,This movie is pretty funny but could have been even funnier without so much over the top silliness.  Sometime it was a little overacted.,1393545600,,136,4.666666666666667
5203938,5,B0090JB6DC,"This movie is very funny. I thought the guy was a bit dumb for giving his credit info out over the phone, though. I also wondered how the woman had used so many people's credit and never got caught.
  The gist of the story is, Sandy Bigaloo Pattersen has his credit stolen by a woman. In order to not lose his job, he goes looking for her and finds her. Through hilarious events of him trying to take her back to be arrested..this is a very enjoyable movie. I highly recommend it for anyone who likes good comedies.",1393545600,,515,4.244897959183674

5203964,4,B0090JB6DC,"Identity Theft was good, but not Oscar quality. Bateman/McCarthy make an interesting duo. Bateman plays the typical straight tight-assed Middle Class white guy (no shocker there!), and McCarthy plays an overweight mad at the world identity thief. Mix with some ""fat""  humor, and it gets entertaining. Of course there are the lessons they teach each other. I won't give that away, gotta watch the movie for something!",1392681600,,416,5.208955223880597

5203989,2,B0090JB6DC,"This is one of those movies where it seems they through in a lot of vulgarity because they didn't want a PG rating. Personally I think it would have made a great film, if the obscenities had been removed. The plot had lots of potential, but instead they the producers went the other way and tried to fill the seats by appealing to the more base side of society.",1391472000,,361,4.246376811594203

Why does every funny movie have to evolve into a sappy, feel good movie? I just don't get it. This movie has moments of really funny stuff but they aren't sustained well and are peppered throughout the sappiness.

Melissa McCartney is the main reason I wanted to watch the movie as she's a great comedic actress. What starts out as an interesting story line turns into a preposterous, predictable and totally unrealistic portrayal of two people brought together by identity theft. There's not a lot of laughs, and the stereotypical bad guys are boring. The moment you think Jason Bateman and McCartney could never rectify what's been done wrong is the exact time this turns into a farce then winds up like a TV comedy ending with lots of forgiveness and understanding.  McCartney is too good an actress to make these kinds of movies; she needs to hold out for better scripts.",1388793600,,750,4.631578947368421

He's good at it, but it's getting played.  Same goes for the fat chick.  She's one dimensional: offensive and it's getting old fast.
I watched this with three nine year olds and an eleven year old (all of whom had parental permission) and they all cracked up, but not nearly as hard as they expected to based on what their buddies had told them and I was checking the news on my iPad forty minutes in.

5204236,3,B0090JB6DC,"Directed by Seth Gordon, Produced by Scott Stuber and Pamela Abdy, Starring Jason Bateman and Melissa Mc Carthy. Music by Christopher Lennertz.

Storyline: Sandy Patterson (Jason Bateman) is an accountant in a multinational firm, living in Denver with his pregnant wife and two daughters. He struggles to make his ends meet due to low salary for a long time. Just at this moment, his credit card identity gets stolen through a fake call from a woman (Melissa). She is a professional identity thief with card printing machine and does this to live a lavish life at the expense of others. Sandy realizes one day about his stolen identity when his credit card gets declined in a petrol station, due to his outstanding dues on the card. Sandy almost loses his new job due to involvement of police and vows to prove his innocence by getting hold of the imposter. He finds her in Colorado and struggles to get her back to Denver and make her confess her guilt. During the journey, he develops a soft corner for her when he learns that she is an orphan and without a proper identity or a person to care for her, which shaped her behavior. Similarly, she also respects Sandy for his true gentleman nature and after meeting his beautiful small family. She finally confesses her fraud to the police and helps Sandy retain his job and good name once again. In return Sandy Patterson fetches her a new name and a her true identity forever, from government records.

Positives: A soft comedy with crime of a different nature mixed in right proportions. Melissas performance has taken the lions share of the movie. Her chubby body shape gives scope for enough comedy scenes. Nice car chases.

Negatives: The story is not new and nothing novel in the idea. Crime model is not practical as such fraudulent usage of credit cards can be easily traced and curbed due to latest technology. Involvement of some hooligans trying to get hold of Melissa seemed to be unnecessary. Comedy scenes are limited to Melissa and more of emotion linked to Jasons role. A movie that need not be for home collection but can be viewed once.

My rating is 2.5 out of 5",1388102400,,2131,4.659574468085107

5204261,3,B0090JB6DC,"Melissa McCarthy is one of the funniest females in Hollywood. After wasting her talent for 7 seasons on Gilmore Girls, she finally got her big break and hasn't slowed down since. One of her latest films is Identity Thief, which is also Seth Gordon's follow up to the hit comedy, Horrible Bosses. Much like his last film, Identity Thief has a whole bunch of funny scenes and outrageous characters, but fails to deliver a solid story to go with it. Sandy Bigelow Patterson (Jason Bateman) is a man with a girls name, making him the prime target for a female (Melissa McCarthy) who makes a living stealing from everyone else. The laws surrounding identity theft make prosecutions very difficult and it can sometimes take years before everything is straightened out. Patterson, with his new job and home on the line, can't wait for that and decides to confront his assailant. As I said earlier there are some real funny moments in this film, but the story is sadly extremely predictable. Identity Theft is something that has never really been done in comedy before. With the right story behind it, this really could have been the next Hangover, but sadly, the Hangover it is not. As usual Bateman and McCarthy are both terrific and to my surprise, had some pretty good chemistry together. Identity Thief is not a movie that sticks with you long after it's over. It is a good way to kill a few hours and good for a few laughs, but not much else.",1387584000,,1440,4.62890625

This movie falls just short of half way.  There are some funny parts, but they as they realized the film was lacking enough good scenes to get it good ratings someone decided it was a good idea to fill the gaps with raunchy slap stick humor and over the top exaggerations of awkward scenes that go on for way too long to remain funny.  I will admit I laughed a few times, but towards the end I simply smiled at some laughable jokes because of the crap they filled the movie with between the good parts.

Candy used to be indiscriminant in the roles he chose but his jovial personality made some of his ventures watchable.  Nothing in the script of ""Identity Theft"" is ostensibly funny.  McCarthy, however, through force of will and personality wrings what few laughs there are and sells to the audience that she may be having a good time.  Co-star Jason Bateman wisely cedes the spotlight to McCarthy in the knowledge that doing so will save this flick from being an outright turkey.

5204338,3,B0090JB6DC,"I skipped over this movie so many times. I finally watched it a few nights ago. It was much better than I expected.

Premise: McCarthy/Diana steals people's identities and buys lavish things. She steals Bateman's/Sandy's identity at a crucial time in his life and the police are not being that helpful. So, he sets out to correct the situation which means bringing her from Florida to Colorado and tricking her into confessing her crimes.

This movie quite funny. Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy worked well together. McCarthy, for the most part, can he hilarious. Even Bateman's straight man performance was packed with some good comedic moments.

The quality of the movie being streamed is very good. The audio and filming are well done.

Family friendly: In my opinion, McCarthy can be quite vulgar at times. Her discussion about sex to Bateman's/Sandy's two children at the end was very out of place and even made this 50 year old man feel uncomfortable. There are a few bad words, a sex scene in a hotel room and you see a man nekkid from behind. There are also quite a few scenes where McCarthy sexually ""acts out."" If this kind of stuff is not for your kids/family, skip the movie entirely. It is frequent.

Overall, I really enjoyed the movie. Lots of laughs. Well worth the rental.",1385596800,,1293,4.754464285714286
5204339,1,B0090JB6DC,This movie is not funny at all. You will want to kill McCarthy character by the end of the movie.

The premise, courtesy of little known writer Jerry Eeten, is ludicrous, as anyone who has ever dealt with credit issues knows all too well, and the screenplay, by Craig Mazin, who was also involved with such worthless endeavors as The Hangover Part III, The Hangover Part II, and Scary Movie 4, has enough holes in it to wonder what drugs were being ingested when he cobbled this script together.

As for the acting by the two main characters, let's face reality. Melissa McCarthy is Melissa McCarthy, so I guess her fans might enjoy her silliness, and Jason Bateman is Jason Bateman. Both are one dimensional personalities who come across as the same characters no matter what movie or television show they appear in, and, as a result, neither could have saved this from being anything but a bad movie.",1385424000,2,900,4.769230769230769

5204394,5,B0090JB6DC,GREAT MOVIES! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND WATCHING IT. IT MADE ME LAUGH ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT. YOU SHOULD WATCH IT IF YOU LIKE COMEDY!,1384905600,,126,4.291666666666667
5204395,5,B0090JB6DC,Loved this movie.  We actually sat here and laughed out loud at times.  Makes you feel good inside when you can laugh out loud.  Enjoyed it very much,1384819200,,149,4.25
5204396,2,B0090JB6DC,"For being billed as a comedy it was quite depressing for over 1/2 of the film.  Melissa McCarthy & Jason Bateman played their parts well as they could, unfortunately this film was hampered by a bad production and script.  The beginning starts like it's going to be a fun movie.  After the first :10 minutes the fun quickly goes away and you see both characters in anything but funny situations.  There are a couple giggles, but mostly you end up just feeling bad.  It isn't until almost the last :15 that it finally starts to go somewhere with the character development.  (you also realize it's more of a drama than a comedy)  However, the change to the characters and finally getting the plot to move along doesn't save the overall lasting feeling that almost 1/2 of the film could have been cut out and then would have had a good 1/2 a movie.",1384732800,2,844,4.477124183006536
5204397,4,B0090JB6DC,Melissa McCarthy at her best and raunchiest.  I would give this movie a chance if you're on the fence.  It is well worth the watch.,1384732800,,131,4.2
5204398,2,B0090JB6DC,Barely could make it through it. Would never watch it again. If you wanna laugh with Melissa Mccarthy get The Heat.,1384732800,,115,4.523809523809524
5204399,5,B0090JB6DC,"I really really loved this movie.  I don't buy movies often, but this will be one for my collection.

Sometimes I just want a basic no-brainer comedy.  And this delivered, big time.  It's rare that I laugh out loud when watching television, and I laughed...a lot!

I love Melissa McCarthy--that woman can perform!!  She totally stole the show from Jason Bateman.  I barely remembered he was part of the movie for most of it.  Totally forgettable.

Hilarious...will watch again and again and again.",1384560000,,497,4.891566265060241

These two actors, Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy, were perfect together and I hope they make a sequel soon!  The language is pretty harsh at times but still their timing and comedic acting is super funny...Jason as a straight shooter and Melissa as a wild scam artist is refreshing.",1384128000,,370,4.951612903225806

5204444,1,B0090JB6DC,I really wish I had not rented this movie. It is a total waste of time and not at all funny. Both actors can do much better than this.,1383609600,2,134,3.6551724137931036

5204446,2,B0090JB6DC,Funny but too crude. The sex scene and the many F-bombs were unnecessary. I think Hollywood goes overboard now with the whole shock-ya scenes and language and this movie is a prime example.,1383436800,,189,4.757575757575758
5204447,4,B0090JB6DC,"Because of a 'network error' the movie kept stopping and restarting.  I even restarted my modem to make sure the error was not on my side, but then Netflix was working perfectly, so the error must have been on Amazon's side.  Then, when we were totally fed up and I turned on the computer to look for the Amazon customer service number, it finally started again and this time played all the way through.  The movie itself it actually funny and entertaining, so the 4 stars is an average:  5 stars for the movie and 2 for Amazon.",1383436800,,528,4.357142857142857

5204449,3,B0090JB6DC,"I rented this movie just to see Jason Bateman and wasn't disappointed. He really is a chameleon. I enjoy watching him work.

Unfortunately, the movie isn't great. It has its moments. It's funny sometimes. There is an underlying positive message, which is nice. But it just didn't hook me. I think that it was because I didn't see anything of myself in either of the main characters. It's fun for a diversion, but not the movie you want to watch if you are looking to learn something, feel something, or experience something. Not bad. Just not a favorite.",1383350400,,554,4.653061224489796

5204461,4,B0090JB6DC,"Being a big fan of Melissa McCarthy and Jason Bateman prompted me to buy this movie.  It was funny and a lot of slapstick.  Melissa can turn her head and make me laugh, so I wasn't disappointed.  It is not a movie that will raise your intellectual value, but it is funny enough to keep you watching.",1383264000,,299,4.2105263157894735

5204463,5,B0090JB6DC,This is a very funny and enjoyable movie. There isn't violence and horror but just a thoroughly nice family movie that lets us know that identity theft is real and dangerous in today's world. I enjoyed it.,1383264000,,205,4.5675675675675675
5204464,4,B0090JB6DC,This movie wasn't as funny as I was anticipating.  There are definitely some good moments.  Overall not worth watching if you are looking to be in stitches but okay for a few chuckles.,1383177600,,184,4.545454545454546
5204465,5,B0090JB6DC,Mellisa is hilarious as usual.  Her rants are similar to This is 40 and bridesmaids.  Its so funny to see the other actor contain their laughter when she is going off!,1383177600,,167,4.354838709677419

5204469,3,B0090JB6DC,This movie is funny but it isn't the funniest movie I ever saw.  If you need a mindless movie to watch for a couple of hours to relax this is the movie for you. It is predictable but the story line allows for some good fun and laughs.,1383091200,,234,3.875

Even though I knew everything that was going to happen it was still just as funny as the first time I watched it! They really were a great duo in this movie and just the little bit of slapstick humor really makes this fun to watch. I'm kind of upset that I didn't just buy this and just rented it.

The service from Amazon was great as it always is... But the movie itself is poor..  JAZZ MAN",1381363200,,215,3.7777777777777777

5204669,5,B0090JB6DC,My family really enjoyed this movie.  If you like semi-slap stick comedy with a overall positive message then you will probably enjoy this as well.  Jason Bateman plays the straight-man comedy part as good as any of the classic comics.  Melissa McCarthy is just plain hysterical.  The movie ends on a high note and is not overly dirty.,1381190400,,335,4.724137931034483

5204672,3,B0090JB6DC,"There are  a few laugh-out-loud moments.  It's a pleasant way to spend a few hours, except foe the one scene of gratuitous sex.  It's not a particularly funny part of the movie and seems isolated from the silly plot. One wonders if some producer  said they needed a little sex and threw this in.",1381190400,,295,4.407407407407407

5204698,1,B0090JB6DC,"I love both Jason and Melissa but the movie was terrible. Oddly, for such a funny cast, the movie wasn't funny at all. The only few moments where I got a slight chuckle were the moments they already showed in the trailer for it. Save your money and time.....Dont even watch it when it comes on television for free as it was THAT bad.",1381104000,2,333,4.21875
5204699,2,B0090JB6DC,"After all the hype over this movie I have to say it was only so-so at best.  I love the actors and I'm sad for them that this movie wasn't better than it was.  My kids (young adults) and I kept watching and waiting for something outrageously funny to happen but all three of us were sorely disappointed. I hope this movie doesn't put a sour note in either actor's career.  Again, I love the actors.  The movie is seriously lacking.",1381017600,,431,4.283950617283951

Not funny, not enjoyable.  Rent this movie because you think she is funny and you will be disappointed.",1380758400,,268,4.448979591836735
5204718,2,B0090JB6DC,This movies best laughs were in the trailer. There was almost nothing funny about this movie. The only reason it got 2 stars from me is that I think Jason Bateman is an ok actor.,1380758400,2,178,4.114285714285714

5204720,3,B0090JB6DC,"I thought it'd be a lot funnier than it was. It's just ok. Meaning, I could sit through it but have zero desire to watch it again. It had about 2 scenes that made me laugh. And by laugh I mean a little snicker-not dying of laughter or anything to that extreme.",1380672000,2,260,4.019230769230769

5204723,1,B0090JB6DC,"It was an anti-buddy movie that just didn't work for me.  I really like the actors in ""Identity Thief"" just not in this particular piece of crap.  It was crass and harsh which can definitely work but in this case fell flat for me and just made me mad.  Should I have turned it off?  Well, yes but I paid for it and I had to finish what I started.",1380672000,,346,3.9
5204724,1,B0090JB6DC,Very painful to watch. Not funny at all. I like to watch funny movies on planes but I had to turn this off. Premise is dumb and acting was weird. Jason Bateman was too bumbling and stupid to be believable. His co star was just too obnoxious to watch,1380672000,2,249,4.1020408163265305

5204768,5,B0090JB6DC,This is Jason Bateman best work since Juno.  He is an incredible actor.  This dark comedy is fantastic.  I really enjoyed all 2 hours.  There are some violent parts so its really not for the kids.,1380585600,,196,4.361111111111111

The movie was completely irritating and we had to encourage each other to watch to the end.  The premise is ridiculous, why did the Jason character choose to tackle his problems the way he did.  A seemingly normal law abiding person would not travel alone to challenge a criminal,  and why was he so nice to her ? We all squirmed through a few of the scenes and were happy when it wa over.  I don't recommend the movie, even if free.",1380326400,3,526,4.21

He learns that he has been the victim of identity theft, and his job is on the line over the investigation.

She can do anything well, whether it's physical comedy or moments of drama. Her character is ruthless, but charming. This story was fast-paced with loads of laughs! I would recommend this to anyone who needs to forget about life's stresses for a couple of hours. I will be buying this movie to watch over & over again!

Since it was a 48 hour rental, and we had spent about an hour to try to restart or resume it, we decided to just leave it where it was and try again next day. Sure enough when we tried it the next day, it began ot run again from where we left off last night.  It ran for about 10 minutes this time and ""froze"" again. Another 15-20 minutes we finally got it to run again, this time for 5 minutes.  So we said concluded this was a lost cause. Needless to say, I won't be renting any more movies from  Amazon.

5205312,2,B0090JB6DC,"This is completely subjective, of course.  But my wife and I hardly laughed once.
I like the actors in the movie.  But none of the jokes landed for us.
I would look elsewhere, maybe rotten tomatoes or metacritic, for an actual review of the film. I'm just trying to give a quick product style review of the movie so you can decide whether it's worth spending money on.
In my opinion, since it's a comedy (ostensibly) and it didn't provide myself or my wife with very many good laughs, I think I'm justified in saying that it might not fully meet your expectations; it didn't meet mine and they were already fairly low.  Also, it's worth noting that there are some strangely mixed messages about body image in this movie that are distracting.  But again, that's somewhat subjective.
Bottom line, based on my experience, I cannot give this movie more than two stars and I regret purchasing it.  BUT I would hope that anyone who is on the fence would visit the aforementioned sites or at least read some other reviews, since it's so hard to give an objective rating to a film.

We waded through the lack of humor and the lame plot that required a suspension of belief and logic at every turn, and we watched scene after scene that magnified all the ugliness and moral bankruptcy that is unique to our country's culture until finally I blurted out how much I hated the movie, half-way through.

5205525,3,B0090JB6DC,"I kind of liked viewing one semi-comical answer to the question ""What would happen if an identity thief and his (in this case her) victim met--or, worse, had to spend quite a bit of time together?""  Jason Bateman's character is indeed ""baited"" by Melissa McCarthy's character.  Over the phone, he reveals information to McCarthy's character (whose name escapes me).  She steals his identity, goes on a huge shopping spree, and wipes him out.  He discovers her identity and is determined to get his own identity back.  To do so he must spend plenty of time with her.  Off they go on the strangest of road trips, for these two characters are very much different types:  He is pretty straight--a business type--what we used to call a yuppie--and too considerate of others' feelings for his own good.  For most of the film she comes across as an immature, self-indulgent teen in a woman's body, who is clever and quick as a, well, thief, yet who lacks a conscience.  In addition, as in ""The Bridesmaids,"" at times she is just too trashy and over-the-top; for instance she masturbates (briefly) in the bathtup (underneath the bubbles, thankfully. Bateman is good as the victim who likely never thought he'd be one, like the boy scout who thought he'd always be prepared--yet wasn't quite and who, knocked off his keister at every turn, must constantly figure out how to right himself.

5205531,5,B0090JB6DC,Jason is the perfect actor for this funny movie. He has designed a promising product and is trying to find a buyer/distributer for it. His Mother manipulates him into inviting her to accompany him! She temporarily becomes a mother from hell with her good intentions to help him. Not sure if we groaned in pity for him; or laughed ourselves silly over his Mother's antics. Loved it.,1377734400,,381,4.701492537313433

I enjoyed ""Identity Thief"" very much.

Warning though, this is definitely an ""R"" rated movie. Tons of foul language, a few scenes that made me wish they didn't happen (the whole Big Chuck scenario for example) but for adult humor I thought this was pretty great.

My family and I sat down to watch what we had hoped would be an enjoyable comedy.  Instead, after a few minutes, we all were cringing and saying,
give it a chance, maybe it gets better.  Well, after twenty painful minutes we ejected it out of the player turned off the TV.  So much for family movie night.

The movie opens with Justin Bateman's character giving his personal information over the phone to a caller (identifying herself as from the credit fraud department of his credit card company), full birthday, full SSN, and other details.  Everyone knows that nowadays a card company will only ask for the last 4 of your social, or one other piece of personal data.  You never give out everything willy nilly! Shortly after the call we find out this character is a financial expert investor!
Hello?  Are you kidding me?  An ""expert"" in the finance world and you just give out your data?  Oh oh.  This movie is not going well.
Finally we meet Melissa's character and the movie goes from bad to OMG horrible.

It is a comedy, there is no long drawn out drama situations and although somewhat predictable but there were some real 'oh no she didn't!' moments. The ending was emotional but realistic and you knew how the movie ended. I watched it again with my adult daughter but did not share it with my 87 year old Dad.",1377388800,,384,4.347222222222222

Melissa is extremely funny. she played her character perfectly and so did Jason. those two need to make more movies together. this is a great film. if you have not seen this movie I recommend you do,1377388800,,500,4.387096774193548
5205770,2,B0090JB6DC,"This is a funny movie, on the face of it. the premise is funny, the characters were funny, and there is a touching end. For what it is, it's a good movie. It COULD HAVE BEEN good Friday night fare for a young family, or anyone wanting lighthearted fare.
But our culture is so enamored with the F bomb that they had to put it in the movie and highlight it many, many times. It's tiring to have to sit and hear it, and it ruins an otherwise fun movie.
Because this has good character development and a touching ending, and the 'moral of the story' is one that would be nice to recommend to families with children, it would be nice to do that.
However, i WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT to anyone with kids, nor anyone, who in my situation is nearly all my friends and family, is offended by vulgar language.

I suggest and adult watch this before their kids do but they will probably watch it when you are not home whether you want them to or not.  There is a little sex and only an adult will appreciate the humor in the sex scene - it made me laugh a lot.  And it shows how easy it is to steal someone's ID and I had friends who objected to seeing that.  However, these were very very mature - oh alright  I'll say it out loud - they were old (at least 35) and out of touch with todays technology and didn't realize we all know how it is done anyway. It's a great movie, and I truly enjoyed it.  If you decide you don't like it, donate it to the library.  They will be glad to have it to share.

5206136,2,B0090JB6DC,The 2 stars is simply for the version of the DVD -- This is one of the funniest movies of all time and I would give the movie itself 5 stars for sure. I bought this version strictly because it came with a digital copy (in addition to the UV copy)  -- Except when I go to redeem the code for digital copy it says that the code won't work -- AKA it only contained the UV copy which I will never use.,1376524800,,397,3.783132530120482

It could not be any more far fetched. That being said, the acting was wonderful, the humor was there and at least two cars got wrecked. What more could you ask?",1376524800,,308,4.327586206896552

5206223,4,B0090JB6DC,"I came into this knowing it would be fairly good, and I wasn't surprised to find it was. Bateman intelligently chooses to stand back and let Melissa McCarthy shine here, and does she ever. Her timing is impeccable, and makes what would be an average script with any other lead very entertaining and funny. The script while reaching into unbelievable territory (which is what makes it a comedy) does have a very solid plot and doesn't get too lost in sentimentality to keep things moving at a decent pace. I didn't regret paying the rental fee for it, and I laughed out loud a good few times, and smiled for the rest. A good date movie or something to see with friends. I'd definitely recommend it to those who love slapstick comedy and its a film that was made by people having a really good time.",1376438400,,797,4.465753424657534

First of all I loved the movie and I was ready to hate it based on the reviews I had read before I saw the movie but it turns out that I fell in love with ""Diana"" as soon as I got to know her and her motives, plus the interpretation by Melissa McCarthy was remarkable and compelling. The movie has a lot of comedy and a lot of car chase and I loved them all. I also have to mention the character played by Eric Stonestreet (Big Chuck) was hilarious! Don't believe the bad reviews, this is a great movie. Bateman is also fantastic as the ""straight man"".

There were perhaps 2 or 3 mildly funny moments in the film, but the rest of it was a complete snore. Boring would be an understatement. It really seemed to drag, the story seemed very empty and superficial, and the lead character's sociopathic nature was annoying and repulsive. They make a few attempts to get you to care about these characters, but they fail miserably. This movie is just really, really bad. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money like I did, or you will most likely be disappointed.

5206620,3,B0090JB6DC,"What started as an amusing premise is squandered by an unnecessary mean spiritedness. While the ending tries to put a bow on it, the interaction between the two principals has a harsh edge that prevents the viewer from caring about them.",1376006400,,237,4.804878048780488

It's a mark of the untalented when they have to throw the ""f"" word and the ""GD"" word into every sentence.  I think all the nepotism in Hollywood has resulted in a lack of talent there and the resulting poorly made movies.  The talented people can't get into show business.  It's filled with the children and friends of the Hollywood privileged.  News flash:  Not everyone is a good actor, writer, or director.  I think Hollywood has already seen its best days.

I ordered this movie and I was sitting on my couch, watching it, when my boyfriend came in and gave me a funny look. ""What's wrong?"" I asked. ""You're just sitting there, seriously stonefaced,"" he said. ""It's like you're watching a documentary on the Khmer Rouge or something. You haven't laughed once.""

It was true. I took out my phone and started playing Candy Crush. I left the movie on in the background for another hour, but I still didn't laugh. All the shrieking started to get to me after a while, so I turned it off.

There were MAYBE 4 funny lines in the movies but I guarentee you have heard them if you watched the trailer. The cast was decent but the writing, plot, and humor was awful.

5206677,1,B0090JB6DC,"I wonder if these guys were hoping I would be under the influence of something before watching this movie? First, the entire set up is completely unbelievable. The idea that someone is constantly doing something illegal and not getting arrested doesn't work. Fraudulent credit card use is illegal everywhere regardless of where the credit card comes from. The idea that a guy with bad credit even when in the case of identity theft could get close to a money associated group or company is wrong. I rented the movie and stopped watching half way through because I couldn't get over how silly the premise of the movie is.

The movie could have ended when McCarthy tried to kill Bateman with her car because most logical people would have simply called the cops. Yet,instead Bateman decides not to call the cops but to find out where she lives so he can visit her. Why is he so patient with her? Why is it that he works with money but doesn't understand identity theft? There are way too many silly things in the movie to take it seriously as a comedy or anything else.",1375747200,,1067,4.557291666666667

5206925,2,B0090JB6DC,"Identity Thief! It sure does bring out the awareness, about your identities being stolen. When I first saw the trailer back in January I thought this was going to be very funny, and while it was funny, it's not that funny. Melissa McCarthy didn't look like Melissa, which was neat. I was disappointed at how the film failed to make the best of its actors, and  ideas. The film doesn't really give out that many good jokes. Well anyway let's start off this review with the negatives, which include the jokes, script, sub-plot, supporting cast, miss - use of actors, and dragging. This film is just not funny. You'd think that with Melissa McCarthy,  break through actress from Bridesmaid, could make this film a truly funny film, which was  said to be proven when the very funny trailer premiered, well most of the sole jokes were in the trailer. Jason Bateman is a wooden stick, that if used right could be a comedic relief, but most of the time he wasn't, and he appeared as a thin, anti-funny person. I am sad to admit this but this is just not funny, and should have been funnier, and could a been too. The script started out decent but started to get bland as soon as we meet Marisol and Julian.  It kinda gets boring and insulting as well. Nothing really works in the middle. We have an idiot tracker who kidnaps the fat lady, whose real name we don't know till the end, but everyone just calls her Diana. What we receive is a pretty gloomy, middle with very little jokes, except for one moment in which Diana sings tunes from songs in a car. The sub - plot with the tracker, and the two people going after Diana. It's pretty dumb, and boring, and I really wished to fast forward threw those parts as the characters are not that important to the film, and they appear pretty randomly threw out the movie.  The supporting cast, really don't help the movie and the worst examples include Jon Favreau as the UN - necessary and UN - funny boss of Jason Bateman's character. Jon, just didn't belong in the film, he should stick to his Elf and Iron Man roles. And Robert Patrick as the bounty hunter, well he's just plain annoying. I hated the actor, and his acting, and I hated his screen time. This film miss uses its cast. Melissa McCarthy, is given very little funny dialogue, and Jason Bateman isn't made fun of enough.  John Cho is an excellent cast member not seen enough at the beginning!  This film drags a lot, during the middle section of this film.  The film can't come to decide what to do and often bores while trying to decide what to do with its self. The positives for this film include the leads, make up, message, music, and the plot. The leads are excellent! Jason Bateman is the hardworking, family man, whose identity is stolen, and Melissa McCarthy is the tough and funky identity thief.  Melissa McCarthy is very funny and energetic in her role, and while she doesn't share much comedy with Jason Bateman, she still is able to pull off one or two, and Jason Bateman's character is a truly good dude, and a person who provides for his family whose life turns upside down. The makeup is excellent, and Melissa looks very - not her actually, and she looks instead like Diana. Very detailed her and make up, and she looks colorful and ugly.  The film's message is a big deal. The message is this, don't trust anyone.  And that  you can lose your job, most of your money, be warranted for jail, and have no car. So the message, while spread out wacky like is still strong and legit in a stupid way.  The music is funky and fun to hear. It is original and just lively. The plot is original, well sort of; it has the same formulaic, capture and road trip kind of deal with it but it also is supported by having a crazy lady and a guy who goes to get his Identity back. It's a plot I hadn't heard of before watching this.  All an All this film is  few in jokes that work, and drags but Melissa  is funny, and the music fun, making this not so much un enjoyable.

""Identity Thief"" makes a fatal mistake when Gordon attempts to incorporate a dramatic element to the story line. By going in this direction, it is no longer possible to view ""Identity Thief"" as a compilation of marginal fat jokes, sex gags, and slapstick humor. Instead, we are forced to absorb a ""serious"" aspect that is so poorly rendered it's unbearable to watch. There are bad movies, and then there's ""Identity Thief."" keep your money.",1375228800,,627,5.1568627450980395

5207208,2,B0090JB6DC,"**SPOILERS**

Directed by Seth Gordon, ""Identity Thief"" is one of those high-concept Hollywood comedies that starts off well, then fritters away its potential on contrived plotting, pointless car chases and crowd-pleasing sentimentality.

Jason Bateman stars as Sandy Bigelow Patterson, a mild-mannered husband and father of two in Colorado who has his identity stolen by a professional thief (Melissa McCarthy) living in Florida. Sandy decides to go after ""Sandy"" after all his credit is ruined and he loses his job, only to find himself bonding with his alter ego on a road trip back to his home state.

Bateman and McCarthy have charm and charisma to spare as the unlikely couple brought together by the oddest of circumstances, but they are undercut every step of the way by a screenplay (by Craig Mazin) that wanders aimlessly for much of the time, then loses the courage of whatever convictions it had in the run-up to the finale (hint: ""Sandy"" becomes a better person through the ordeal, while Sandy learns to loosen up a bit and take life as it comes).

Jonathan Banks from ""Breaking Bad"" and Eric Stonestreet from ""Modern Family"" are also largely wasted in minor roles.",1375056000,,1178,4.994897959183674

5207212,1,B0090JB6DC,"Not only did people not laugh in the audience of the movie theater, they hardly made a sound.  Most of us were cringing and looking away as McCarthy said and did things that were so inappropriate and degrading to herself.  The scene in the hotel is just awful.  Her language is terrible.  She makes herself out to be a buffoon simply because she is overweight and this sends a bad message out to other women.  Why can't she play a classy chick for once?  She was great in Gilmore Girls and didn't need to be so crass to be funny there.

It could have been a funny movie with better writing, and cutting out certain scenes.  I can't believe some people watched this more than once.  I was ready to leave the theater but kept thinking it would get better, but it only got worse.  The story line is so predictable and the 'bad guys' don't even fit into the movie well.

5207825,3,B0090JB6DC,"""Identity Thief""
(2013)

A strangely reserved, slowly paced film with a promisingly outrageous premise. Jason Bateman's businessman character has had his identity stolen by a crass, unrepentant con artist, played by Melissa McCarthy. While the two comedians have some chemistry, their styles never quite mesh -- Bateman reserved, and McCarthy (normally) completely outrageous and over the top -- and she seems to bend a bit more in his direction, holding herself in check while he never really cuts loose, even when his character goes rogue. There are funny, acerbic moments, bu the film never really catches fire. Lots of great Bateman slow-burns, a few over-the-top gags, but the overall delivery is kind of snoozy. This might have played better in a theater, I'm not sure, but as home video it was disappointing. Great to see McCarthy emerge as a leading character -- she's had great cameos in other recent films -- but she might have needed more free reign with this project. The bonus features were minimal, and the 30-second-long gag reel was a real dud -- super-short and seemed like it was just slapped on. Oh, well. (Axton)",1374278400,,1132,4.98941798941799

5207921,2,B0090JB6DC,MINI REVIEW: a comedy that fails to be a comedy which loses steam in the early part of the picture but then picks it back up to the mediocre to average range in the latter third of the tale. Story focuses upon a family man (Jason Bateman) whose identity is stolen by an unhappy female thief (Melissa McCarthy) and he's told by the police that the only way to clear things up is to catch the thief himself and bring her back. Also starring Jon Favreu and Amanda Peet. OVERALL GRADE ON THE SHANNON SCALE: C to C plus.,1374105600,,515,4.212121212121212
5207922,3,B0090JB6DC,"whats up with the $5.00 rental for 24 or 48 hours mostly for the good titles its too much and redbox is becoming me new option. Wish we could have the full 30 day rental instead of 1 click and 24 or less your movie rental is done.

otherwise this movie is not that funny as I thought it would be however there are some funny moments but the story plot lacks alot of chemistry and the jokes  could have been funnier and improved.",1374105600,,428,4.083333333333333

5207925,4,B0090JB6DC,"I anticipated lots of witty lines and slapstick in this movie.  Those things were definitely there, but there were also moments of drama and conflict that I wasn't expecting.  Those surprises made the movie quite good - better than I expected it to be.
Bateman played the same character he always does - the wry, straighlaced good guy with dry delivery of very funny lines.  McCarthy was a little more than the previews portrayed.  It was great to see a female actor do things usually assigned to the guys.
All in all, the movie was reliably funny and refreshingly different at the same time.",1374105600,,592,4.663461538461538

It's that new generation of fast talking, jaded sense of humour that you hear in bars and clubs in Hollywood.  Most people don't think it's funny!  The story had potential, I think it would have worked if it was more of a dark comedy, not over the top funny and contrived.  I also think it was totally miscast, even though melissa McCarthy is funny on her own, I think she prob. felt uncomfortable with the cast and crew.  Either that or she felt too comfortable.  I had to actually skip past alot of the film, it just got to dopey and ignorant for me.  The comedy was too juvenile in a bad way, like comedy writing 101.  People that like SNL and new comics might like this trash but there are so many good comedies out there that you can get a laugh from.  Watch Big Business with Bette Midler for god's sake!",1374019200,,962,4.294444444444444

CONS: No resemblance of comedy or humor. Acting is weak and the story-line weaker still. This is one of the worse movies I've almost watched. There is just no point in making movies this bad. None at all.",1373846400,4,260,4.22

I should bill producers for the wasted 30 minutes we spent watching before we turned it off.  Don't rent or certainly not buy.  Maybe a 10 year old would like it, but they couldn't watch due to the bad language and innuendo.  Two thumbs down!",1373760000,,375,4.3768115942028984

We got too tired of the non-stop cursing. (Where is Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy? Is this 48 Hrs, Part II?) If you want to take a course in how to cuss then this is your Cussing Class 101.

5208305,3,B0090JB6DC,"It is always a pleasure to see Justin Bateman looking adorable (I'm a girl, what can I say) ... and Melissa McCarthy ... well, I'll never forget that Saturday Night Live skit she did in which she was an office worker trying so hard to seduce Jason Sudeikis. She is amazing.

I'm not sure her comedic talents were really played to their full potential here, but then she kind of underplayed her role which I think was the better choice. What bothered me a little about the movie were two things: one, I was sort of expecting something along the lines of that series of commercials some years back in which someone was apparently enjoying all kinds of things and we saw a person vastly different who had evidently had his or her card information stolen; the photo on the cover of the DVD kind of sets you up for that sort of treatment. And, two, I thought I might learn something about identity thievery. Well, I guess I learned that someone who has donned your identity can go to jail blamelessly as you and when they skip town you're the one who gets roped in. But a lot of the antics done in the movie to steal, forge and use a stolen identity didn't go into much detail, or was sort of unbelievable, as when information was somehow uploaded in a bank in a way that I would suspect couldn't happen in a million years.

Still, the moral was cute so you'll just have to decide if the sight of Bateman and the schtick of McCarthy is good enough for ya.",1373673600,,1450,4.327205882352941

Bridesmaids, she stole the show!  Mike & Molly-She's awesome! Jason Bateman- He knows how funny he is & he is an amazing actor.  Putting these 2 together was a great idea & this movie is really funny! I love the fact that Molly's character steals Jason's characters identity & he decides to go on his own man hunt to clear his name.  Who honestly, in real life, would think that was a good idea in real life?  Needless to say, getting fake Sandy back to Colorado ended up being more difficult than real Sandy realized.  i had fun watching this movie & I'll watch it over & over again because these 2 have great chemistry together.",1373587200,,936,4.5568862275449105

This is a Midnight Run sort of film and really had some potential. I think the director and writer expected the actors to do their job for them because both actors are more than capable of making something like this work well, when they have the right people around them.

it felt like they made McCarthy's character too mean and unlikable and Bateman's character too bland. The timing was never right to make the scenes funny, and if feels more like camera angles and editing than the actors. I think there could have been more chemistry between the main characters if directed differently.

Jason Bateman is a new old find. I remember him from TV, but didn't remember much about him being funny. I must have been under a rock since people watching Arrested Development knew very well!  Couples' Retreat was my first re-introduction to Jason Bateman and ever since then I enjoy just about every thing I watch with him in it. Good on-screen chemistry.

The thief is a short, stocky, red head with no friends and an apartment that looks like a small, jam-packed department store.  She shops on other people's money.  She is good at what she does. In the beginning you hate her and the destruction she causes, in the end you want to adopt her. The main character who is pursuing her to get his identity back is your average great husband, great dad.  These two are funny together because of the mismatch. The F-bomb is dropped profusely.

But positive points aside, the plot was pretty weak, no one seemed at the top of their acting game, and every bit of the crude humor seemed added for no good reason. Each time any was attempted, my thought was, ""Oh God. Was that necessary?"". But what really killed it for me was the hotel sex scene. Why? Because I believe it was probably meant to be funny, but *that* was a seriously difficult tryst to watch. My stomach twisted through the whole thing, and I was praying for the end of the scene which came none-too-soon. There are things in it that I cannot un-see. And I really do have a good sense of humor. So the best I can say is that it was a movie worth seeing **once**, but I definitely do not want to see it again.

This movie had maybe 2 funny bits which I'm fairly certain were not part of the written script. Rather, a funny ad-lib by Melissa McCarthy. Jason Bateman is one of my favorite actors. I adored him in Horrible Bosses which I did think was funny!

If I could get my $4.99 back, I'd feel better. As it stands now, I feel like I suffered through this movie and made my partner suffer through with me.

I can't write much more without giving away the movie. If you liked Horrible Bosses, This is 40, or Silver Linings Playbook, you'll probably want to pass on this movie. Wait until it comes on tv (free) so you can turn it off and not feel bad.",1373155200,,799,4.25

Why all the 'F' words?  They were totally unnecessary and spoilt some of the wittier lines.

Yes it was funny at first to see someone get punched in the throat but over and over?

We watched for about 15 - 20 minutes and then switched off.  From that moment our day got better.

5208806,1,B0090JB6DC,"Identity Thief is a truly polarizing movie.  From reading the reviews you can gather that you either will love this movie or hate it.  I watched this with three others of mixed ages and all four of us thought it was one of the worst movies we've seen in quite a while - if I could rate it a zero I would have and no one gave it more than a two.
I think it depends on what you view as a funny movie.  If you like witty dialogue and unexpected plot turns built on common human frailties, or just slapstick fun, you'll be disappointed, I promise you.
If you enjoy watching a dysfunctional witch who represents a too-common class of uncaring criminals in real life (identity thieves) and see her portrayed as an unfortunate victim of childhood abandonment who only learns true values in life when dragged across country by a too-caring, too normal middle-class guy as they `bond' while haplessly enduring situations that keep jumping from harrowing, violent, humiliating, hectic, and yes, occasionally near-humorous - you'll love this movie.  Attempts at humor during car-chases ending in violent collisions they walk away from, lots of initial hitting and punching each other, name-calling, a bizarre scene with a pick-up in a bar that winds up in suggested, very-abnormal sex with a goofy `conservative' cowboy in a hotel-room (instead of funny we all found it disturbing), and the constant on-the-run avoidance of thugs who are out to kill her (them) seem to be written in at random places to fill the car journey with `crazy, hilarious mayhem'.
While you may be rolling on the floor by that point, I wound up feeling like I was enduring a terrible movie that gets weaker as it goes, with a sappy `moral' story as the main character (our at-first horrible but now lovable thief) metamorphoses into a deeply caring woman who displays true character at the end, making the movie not only terrible to watch but numbingly unbelievable as well. One of us went and did something else half-way through the movie - they were wise to do so.",1373155200,17,2030,4.709859154929577

Somehow this justifies the actions in the bad gals mind until finally confronted by one of the good people she's hurt.  If this wasn't a comedy, I would have hated it because I have not tolerance for not knowing the difference between right and wrong regardless of the past.  Since it was a comedy, I'll give it a ""like"" rating.  Melissa McCarthy steals the show as she usually does and Jason Bateman was great too.

This movie is definitely not the funniest I have ever seen but it does have its moments that will make you laugh although sometimes straying into the area of bad taste.  At times the jokes miss more than make you laugh and sometimes makes you cringe but Identity Thief does soften up at the end and comes across as being a somewhat sweet comedy in the end despite some of the cringe worthy jokes.

I will give McCarthy credit as she does about anything to get a laugh even with physical comedy and she is not afraid to ham it up for the camera.

This movie is definitely not in the league of some of the funnier movies I have seen (like Hangover or 40 year old virgin) but isn't bad and will keep you entertained.  I did expect more laughs though but this movie ends up being more cute than a laugh out loud comedy.",1372809600,38,1056,4.507853403141361

5209237,3,B0090JB6DC,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

I'm not really sure what I was expecting going into Identity Thief. I thought the basic premise was interesting; a man gets his identity stolen and has to track down the woman because the police won't/can't do it. However, it never crossed my mind that that's where the interesting part of the plot would stop. There's almost no way to fill in those blanks with two hours worth of footage and make it memorable or, at the very least, enjoyable. Unfortunately, Identity Thief suffers from just that. An interesting idea in theory, but not one strong enough to warrant making a film about it.

You follow a man by the name of Sandy Bigelow Patterson (Jason Bateman). As the title and trailers suggest, he gets his identity stolen by a woman named Diana (Melissa McCarthy). His work situation is complicated as he just joined a new business with an old coworker, Daniel Casey (John Cho). After receiving a bunch of weird calls he soon finds out that his identity was stolen and Daniel said that his bad credit scores are driving away potential clients. Because the police are incapable of helping Sandy, Daniel gives him one week to find the woman behind this and bring her to the police.

After that things quickly turn sour as everything that follows soon becomes your run-of-the-mill road trip movie; two people have to go across country, they're completely opposite from one another, bad things happen, they get arrested, yada yada yada. It's almost sickening how cliched and formulaic this movie is, but that's not all. Both of these characters feel stiff, lifeless, and, once again, cliched. Sandy has a family and he needs to get this fixed or else they will be poor and Diana has a sad backstory which is why she does what she does. There's nothing unique about either of these characters and the same can be said about the movie as a whole.

With that said, Identity Thief isn't all bad. The movie has plenty of laughs  scattered throughout it's lengthy running time, with most of them being provided by Bateman - it's never really what he said, it was more his actions and facial expressions. He's one of those actors that's very animated with his performances and I think that's why I've grown to enjoy him so much. To be completely honest, Bateman is one of the few things that actually holds the film together. He's returned with that clean cut, good guy character that we've seen him play multiple times before, but it works because he's so good at it.

McCarthy, on the other hand, was less than stellar. It's reaching a point where she's starting to paint herself into this weird corner. Most of the jokes involving her are either about her weight or her character's fashion sense, which, apparently, is a product of her weight. I just don't understand why someone would continuously play a character like that. Everything I've seen her in recently has been the same thing and it looks like the same thing she's doing with her recent film The Heat. Fat jokes in general are tasteless, but when an actor or actress keeps involving themselves with those kinds of movies it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

Along with the two main leads you have a group of recurring characters. Amanda Peet plays Sandy's wife, Trish; Jon Favreau plays Sandy's old boss, Harold Cornish; Genesis Rodriguez and T.I. play Marisol and Julian, two hitmen sent to deal with Diana; Robert Patrick plays another hitman by the name of Skiptracer; and Morris Chestnut plays Detective Reilly. All of these supporting characters were interesting, with the exception of Marisol and Julian, and their respective actors all gave solid performances as well. Patrick and Chestnut in particular gave fun performances.

Overall Score: 5.5/10 - Identity Thief is one of those comedies that has you laughing throughout, but at the end of it you're left feeling guilty. It relies on the same formula we've seen used countless times before and a good chunk of the jokes are tasteless. It lacks originality and inspiration and that's what ultimately ruins the experience. I would have a hard time recommending it because I can't see myself watching it again, but if you thought it looked interesting give it a shot.",1372809600,,4235,4.791780821917809

The film is kind of slow going and isn't as funny as most of the films both actors have stared in before but I went into the film not expecting it to be.

I thought it was funny but the characterization was not enough for me. I didn't buy it. I didn't think they did enough characterization on Diana to create a suspension of disbelief that she would be able to make a turn around nor did they give us any reason to believe Sandy would become FRIENDS with her. No. Didn't buy it.

The ONLY reason I'm not doing 2 stars is because my daughter loved it. She loves Melissa McCarthy-ish / Parks and Rec humor. There were moments of that. If they had taken out the F words and the stupid sex scene it would have KILLED with the preteens.",1372636800,,730,4.282608695652174

Of course, Dianna changed towards the end, not the case with our nemesis in Louisiana. Once the shock set in, we enjoyed the movie.

5209542,1,B0090JB6DC,"It's always risky watching movies that have an early year release (as this one did on 2/8/13), as this is historically a time when studios are known to dump all of their bad movies into the slowest part of the movie-going season.  However, my wife and I were looking for something funny, mindless and raunchy in the vein of ""40 year old Virgin"" or ""Hangover I"" - both well done, excellent, silly comedies for a Friday night after the kids go to bed, so we took a risk, without being aware of the 19% rotten tomatoes rating or the review on Amazon.

Shame on us, because there are literally a handful of movies that are so bad they make me cringe with irritation having to sit through them, and this is one of them.  We did expect lewdness and swearing as we would from any comedy with an 'R' rating - so that didn't bother me in the least.  No, it was the fact that it was not only unfunny, but had a vile theme (Identity theft), a completely unbelievable premise, unlikable characters, and nonsensical situations seemingly patched together.

Director Seth Gordon got a pass on the mediocre ""Horrible Bosses"", but this time he unleashed something truly worthless from script to premise to execution.  First there's the comedy - there is none really.  There are the usual cheap slapstick gags about fat people, alternative lifestyles, gay people, etc. etc. etc.  There are the thick ""hillbilly"" accents and stereotypes of various types of people - all poorly done at that.  The gags occur with a 1-2 punch of pointlessness and randomness that makes me wonder if they took stock bits out of other failed scripts to patch a movie together to meet a deadline.  Here's an example - the main character's name is Sandy Patterson.  Throughout the movie, when he gives his name to anyone, they without fail ask him why he was given a girls name.  It's a real knee-slapper.  I guess they could build comedies around guys named Taylor also (this will be the sequel God help us).

But what I really found repulsive was the attempt to create a sympathetic heroine out of a trollish woman who commits identity theft then uses her ill gotten goods to go on drinking binges, rack up DUIs, and purchase consumer goods she doesn't need - in effect justifying and propagating the all too common view in society that it's okay to break the rules because the man has somehow been unfair to you.  It's reflective of a real sense of entitlement that is impacting this country.  I have a hard time seeing the humor in it, and it at any rate makes for lousy entertainment. The contrived elements in it to generate the R rating only make sitting through this piece of comedic waste all the more agonizing.

The real crime is that this movie was made, and the real fraud was perpetrated against unwitting audiences who dared to watch it.",1372550400,,2810,4.588

The movie could actually have been cute (no socially redeeming value at all) except the storyline never got beyond the first act.  Repetitive, boring, a waste of 2 hours.

McCarthy goes all in as usual, she puts crazy in a new and unpredictable jack-in-the-box that is sooo fun to open and Bateman is the same character he is in everything which works, he balances the outrageous in his own humble, willingness to be self deprecating and wicked-smart-and-funny way.",1372204800,,372,4.828125

When I go see a movie I just go to have fun and get away from real life for a little bit and that's what this movie did for me. This movie is honestly the funniest movie I have ever seen I was laughing throughout the whole movie and it wasn't like I was waiting bored for the next laugh because it kept me interested and satisfied in between the laughs. The movie even had a little heart in it with Melissa McCarthy's character and she developed throughout the movie and became someone that was respectable even though she is stealing people's identities left and right. I honestly loved this movie so much and people can say all they want about it I thought it was perfectly scripted, super funny, and a little touching. I would recommend this to honestly every person I know.",1372118400,2,880,4.333333333333333

Especially when you see she does what she does JUST BECAUSE SHE CAN!  Not to survive, or to get even for a past injustice (How many blenders does a person need before payback is achieved?), but just to do it.  Jason Bateman is good, as always, doing what he does best:  carrying a story so his co-stars can perform.  Amanda Peet is again wasted as the dutiful wife.  It all works out the way it's supposed to, but if you need to cheer for an unrepentant criminal, turn to Leonardo DiCaprio in ""Catch Me If You Can,"" and pass on this one.

Jason Bateman just keeps getting better with age; he's a solid performer and makes a great contrast for ""Sandy"" - his feisty identity thief!!

Great movie for almost everybody - the one, very funny sex scene makes it unsuitable for children, but other than that if you're an adult and looking for a great comedy that isn't like the move you saw last summer, this is a good choice; you won't be disappointed!!!",1371686400,,593,4.584905660377358

5210276,3,B0090JB6DC,"This had some really funny bits embedded in the story, but overall it fell a little flat for me. I thought Megan McCarthy's character was more sad than funny; most of the time, her character came across as lost and desparate, so a lot of the jokes just made me cringe rather than laugh. And the premise - that a man actually found the person who stole his identity with the purpose of taking her back with him, eventually see things from her point of view, feel sorry for her, and allow her to become friends with his family - is just a smidge implausible, even for a movie comedy. But there are a few creatively funny bits (mostly to do with the dynamic between Megan McCarthy's sociopathic tricks, and Jason Bateman's sqeaky-clean earnestness) that I feel are worth checking out just on their own, without necessarily watching the entire movie.",1371686400,,846,4.6092715231788075

5210322,2,B0090JB6DC,"I'm not trying to be a downer here but it was hard to watch the beginning of the movie because Melissa McCarthy's character is a criminal and there is nothing amusing about theft. She disregarded the victims and what they would have to go through to rebuild their lives after their credit being ruined, losing evrything they worked for because someone did not care for anyone but herself. Hard to build laughs out of that.",1371686400,,422,4.64

5210350,2,B0090JB6DC,"This was an incredibly terrible movie. The premise was realistic I suppose, but then again a financial guru in a financial company should know better than to give name, address, phone #, Social Security #, etc., etc. from an unsolicited caller. But he just says ""Oh, thanks."" and hands it all over.

He then proceeds to feel sorry for her poor little life and escorts her on a cross country trip because his ID and her ID are the same name, birthdate, and address so they can't board a plane. It didn't matter that she had another 50 fake IDs.

Too many stupid things happen in the movie that make it hard to take it seriously, even for a comedy. In one scene she gets hit head on by a car going 40 MPH, smashes into and shatters the windshield, then gets thrown 20 or so feet through the air, pin-wheeling like a rag doll, slams to the pavement, then gets up and runs away. Terrible, amateurish writing.

All in all, I could not recommend this movie to anyone. Instead I'd prefer to warn people off of it. The only reason I didn't give it one star is because there are worse movies, like Lost in Translation and The Royal Tenenbaums.

The movie is sort of a sappy funny.  Overall, it seems sanitized as if someone directing this on Xanax was worried about going over the top with humor.  I don't recommend this movie. It just doesn't launch the humor.",1371427200,,359,4.313432835820896
5210472,3,B0090JB6DC,"Do you like Jason Bateman? I do. This movie isn't amazing, but it has Jason Bateman being his wonderful self and it's entertaining enough for a full movie. I wouldn't pay the price to rent it (if I had the chance to go back in time), but would probably watch it if it were on TV and I didn't want to concentrate on a movie.",1371427200,,323,3.9846153846153847
5210513,2,B0090JB6DC,"But overall was not very well put together.  It could have been much funnier.  They went way to unrealistic - clearly these movies are unrealistic quite a bit, but this was way off.  We finally finished it in 3 different sittings...",1371427200,,232,4.609756097560975
5210514,4,B0090JB6DC,What could have been a less than memorable film sends interesting messages about relationships and redemption. The two leading roles are played well by Bateman and McCarthy.,1371427200,,173,5.444444444444445

Unfortunately, aside from a few laughs (trailer was pretty great), the contrived plot leaked like a sieve and ""funny"" was more uncomfortable than anything. Disappointing.",1371427200,,248,5.384615384615385
5210519,4,B0090JB6DC,"This movie made me laugh.  Simple.  My wife and I love Jason Bateman and thought we would give this movie a chance.  Melissa McCarthy stole the show though.  From the very first scene she was a one woman menace of comedic proportions.  The script was a little disjointed at points, but overall the movie flowed well and kept you laughing.  Melissa McCarthy is a person you love to hate and hate to love in this film.  Both her and Bateman worked well together and you got a feeling they were enjoying their completely opposite characters.  Bateman with his usual calm demeanor and straight delivery coupled with McCarthy's in your face antics and larger than life over the top funniness.

A great movie for a date night!",1371427200,,720,4.650793650793651
5210520,1,B0090JB6DC,I was really looking forward to seeing this because of the great cast. Got 20 min into it and turned it off. Don't waste your time with this movie. Bad writing and predictable story.,1371427200,,182,4.382352941176471
5210521,3,B0090JB6DC,"If you have seen the trailer, you have seen the best moments of this film. It's a good, but not great, comedy. Bateman plays Bateman, McCarthy plays McCarthy, and that carries the movie. Some genuinely funny moments, but a bit uneven.",1371427200,,234,4.7317073170731705

5210539,2,B0090JB6DC,This was one of those movies that showed the funniest parts of the movie in the trailer and the rest of the movie was just not that funny at all.

5210540,1,B0090JB6DC,This movie was not funny at all and totally unrealistic.  Don't waste your money on renting or buying it.  My wife and I shut it off halfway through the movie it was so bad.

When I glance at a customer rating for a film I'm searching specifically for helpful reviews - for or against - of the film and not gripes about issues with late delivery or complaints about problems that are, in reality, caused by your crappy service provider (looking at you slow streamers.)

That being said, I think that this is a fun, silly, slapstick summer comedy. It's perfect for a laid back afternoon on the couch with friends or family and, of course, lots o' popcorn. It's not Shakespeare or too cool to be understood mumble-core indie. If I want intense and introspective, I look forward to Frances Ha at my local art house theater. (Actualy do look forward to that.)

5210733,4,B0090JB6DC,A good aftermnoon movie to spend time. McCarthy shows real acying skills. She makes the character a villian to human. In the end you will cheer and hope for redemtion.,1371168000,,167,4.6

5210736,4,B0090JB6DC,Had me and the teenagers laughing throughout...teenagers hanging out with mom AND laughing...makes for a memorable evening. Quirky and light...not a profound piece of filmmaking...but entertaining nonetheless.,1371168000,,209,6.777777777777778

It can get vulgar at times. I like some ""edge"" in humor at times, but sometimes it can go to a ""just plain vulgar"" level that, in my opinion, adds no real value or meaning to the movie other than shock value. I put that kind of just plain nasty humor in the same world of 'Two Broke Girls' and 'Two and a Half Men.' I would not allow children to watch the unrated version of this movie. I have not seen the other version. Hope this helps.",1371168000,,591,3.8925619834710745

5210765,1,B0090JB6DC,"This had such potential but dragged on and on.  It wasn't funny.  Instead of humor it just kept getting serious instead of funny. We watched almost 2 hrs of ""maybe it'll get funnier"" but it just didn't.",1371081600,,202,4.4324324324324325

I call this a ""coat tail"" movie. It's not actually that funny or particularly well-written, it just rides on the coat tails of funnier, smarter movies using the same actors. But buy it once (like I did, uff!) and they make their money, whether you like the movie or not.

The writing is thin and it was a little boring. We had a hard time staying engaged and ended up multitasking through the movie. I would've turned it off, but I'd already paid for it and I kept thinking, ""NOW it's going to get better!"" But... it didn't. And then it was over.",1371081600,,709,4.213235294117647

This actress was so funny in Bridesmaids, I thought she would be in something equally funny--but how very very wrong I was!  This movie was sooooo boring and not a bit funny.  My son and I sat through the first 20 minutes or so, and he gave up on it.  Both of us thought it was a terrible terrible stupid movie, but, I wanted to continue watching it, thinking it might get funnier.  It didn't, and then I fell asleep.

5210833,5,B0090JB6DC,"We busted a gut it was so flippin funny!!! Two thumbs up!!! It also gave you a shocking ending that I loved.

5210837,2,B0090JB6DC,Melissa McCarthy is a wonderful talent that I really enjoy. She genuinely added a new dimension to Bridesmaids - a humanity. This movie is lame and an excuse to put her through predictable paces the producers think will get laughs. It just wears on you. Jason Bateman is so talented. Thankfully we have Arrested Development to enjoy him - it isn't this. There are worse ways to wile away your hours... I heard it's Tom Cruise's Oblivion...,1370995200,,439,4.714285714285714
5210838,1,B0090JB6DC,Too awful to even finish. First :45 minutes was painful.  Noisy track. Bad writing. Predictable plotting. Stupid and silly without providing laughs.  Only for the most dedicated fans of Melissa what's-her-name.,1370995200,,210,5.741935483870968

The movie contained a great deal of adult humor, cursing, and sexual situations that are definitely not intended for children to view; however, the movie actually went beyond crass humor.  If you're good with that, you'll definitely like the movie.  The humor works well because the actors/actresses gel well together in an unbelievable, but almost believable, scenario.  It wasn't like the dumb, predictable slapstick humor (you know where they fart in someone's face) you find in most movies today, but was well planned and executed for the laugh.

The script is completely devoid of any humor and the situations are so slapstick and unbelievable without one hint of irony or even jut plain fun.

After viewing the trailer, I wasn't sure I wanted to watch this movie, but I like Jason Bateman and I watch Mike & Molly every now and then and I found out Morris Chestnut was part of the cast. It was a bit funny at times but I can't say I enjoyed it. This is what some call a goofy comedy, I call it stupid humor. What I did like was how Diana's (Melissa McCarthy) deep-rooted issues came to light, showing why she made so many bad choices no matter who got hurt. There were also touching moments and when it comes to identity theft, a person can learn from 'the real' Sandy Patterson's (Jason Bateman) mistake.",1370908800,,774,4.125827814569536

Not quite as inappropriate for children as I thought it would be.  I may actually let my 10 year old niece see it.  Many PG and PG-13 movies I think are worse than this for kids.  The OZ movie was worse than this for kids in my opinion.  That one was downright scary in some parts.  My niece had nightmares for a few days afterward.

I don't understand why writers, directors, actors, think the only way to make a good movie is to pepper it with f... this or f... that. There is no need for all that stuff. It WAS funny in between all the language or sexual content, unfortunately, those times were too few. The only reason I rented this movie was b/c I like Jason Bateman but in my opinion, the best thing about the movie was the trailer. Had the trailer been able showed more of the garbage, I would not have paid to rent this movie. I was faced with do I want to continue watching a movie I just paid for and am not all that impressed with, or do I just forget about the money and find something much better to watch. That was my choice, and I have to say I made the wrong one, I wish I had found something better to watch.

Sure the trailer had a few twists and some funny parts, but any good one does. I was also concerned that said trailer gave away those few moments of comedy.

Although each person's past is introduced at separate times, the movie creates a pretty good identity (haha) and back story for the two main characters. At first you see the protagonist as a little up tight, boring and possibly weak. You also see the Antagonist as being sloppy, lazy, and eccentric. Stay tuned though, Things get mixed up in a hurry.

All said and done I had a good laugh at several parts of the movie and had a positive feeling throughout the whole film. There were even scenes that made me burst into laughter. This felt almost like a genuine laughter and not something that could be considered ""slap stick"".

5211293,3,B0090JB6DC,"If you are fan of slapstick, potty mouth humor, and escapist road trips then this just may be a film for you. Director Seth Gordon keeps tight reigns on the genre he practically created (along with Paul Feig of Bridesmaids and Todd Phillips of Hangover/s). The presence of Jason Bateman counters the gross overly exaggerated performance of the ever larger Melissa McCarthy and the story requires little thought - just a lot of tolerance.

The plot is well summarized elsewhere: 'Sandy Patterson (Jason Bateman) gets a nice call confirming his name and other identifying information. The next thing he knows, a spa in Florida is reminding him of his appointment, and his credit cards are maxed out. With his identity stolen, Sandy leaves his wife, kids and job to literally bring the thief to justice in Colorado. But keeping tabs on the other Sandy (Melissa McCarthy) and run-ins with bounty hunters, is harder than he was expecting, and ultimately the cross-country trip is going to find both Sandys learning life tips from one another.'

There are some guest appearances by John Favreau, Amanda Peet, Morris Chestnut, John Cho, T.I., Genesis Rodriquez, Robert Patrick and Eric Stonestreet and they add some sparkle. It is all a matter of mood and taste. For a comedy that is what it sets out to be  - a divergence from the usual - it works just fine for an evening's TV watching.

Middle America fighting back the only way it knows how! The laughs weren't constant, but the story was well conceived and well done by the actors.  Maybe I'm just smitten with his charm and good lucks (I'm saying it is possible) but he delivered the star performance here with Ms. McCarthy in an almost believable 'bad guy' role.

5211384,2,B0090JB6DC,"Another instance where the the trailer was funnier than the movie. IDENTITY THIEF has about 3 movie genres going on at once. It doesn't know if it is a on-the-road buddy comedy, a mob hit movie, or a tear- jerker. Also, again, Jason Bateman plays the same character he's been playing ever since he started acting in adult roles. He and Melissa McCarthy have no on-screen chemistry whatsoever. It's amazing Hollywood keeps on giving Bateman acting jobs because he plays the same character over-and-over again and his acting style hasn't changed. The tone of the film is all wrong (or all over the place). For instance, actor Robert Patrick (Terminator 2:Judgement Day) as Skiptracer in the role of a bounty hunter is all too serious and all too straight. His scenes are so mean-spirited that they do not gel with the comedy part of the movie. Also, there is a pair of hit-persons (Marisol & Julian) whose dialogue are some of the worst lines written for mob hit men in the history of crime drama cinema and whose scenes do not gel with the movie. Melissa McCarthy is fine with what little the writer/director has given her so she's not at fault here because she switched from comedy to dramatic when the scene called for it. However, it just didn't sit well and it was sometimes uncomfortable when one is expecting comedy and all of a sudden, a serious scene pops up out of nowhere. Overall, an excercise in film making that misses the mark and a tax write-off for Universal Pictures.",1370563200,,1483,4.66412213740458

5211425,3,B0090JB6DC,"This movie had a lot of potential.  The first half of the movie is essentially an extensions of the trailers.  McCarthy and Bateman are great together.  This was a typical Bateman role because he always plays the conservative slightly damaged protagonist that learns something of himself in the end; while McCarthy was over the top and very funny.
Unfortunately that's where the fun ends.  I wasn't expecting a realistic story that would win an Oscar by any means, but I was hoping for a satisfying one at least.  The movie was long, and got very hokey...  Certain secondary characters kept appearing with no explanation at all, except to deter Sandy and Diana from getting back to Colorado; it got to the point my wife and I lost any attachment to the movie itself.  Seriously, Sandy and Diana are going across country, in different cars, and using cash for most of it... and these other characters keep finding them?  Huh?  That brings up my second point:  every cop was portrayed as just dumb.  Denver PD couldn't help him in less than year because they had to involve Seattle, Cleveland, and other metro PD's?  Wait...what?  That doesn't even make sense.
Of course movies don't have to make sense in the real world, that's why we go to see them, to be entertained.  But a movie should at least have a logical flow within it's own universe.  Look at the ""Hangover"" or ""Bridesmaids"" - no one can honestly say these movies could actually happen, but at least you understood what was going on and how they got from A to B.  ""Identity Thief"" was just a mess through the second half.  McCarthy and Bateman deserved better - they are too talented for this.",1370476800,3,1653,4.644827586206897

The Jason Bateman character finds out what it means to take a stand and to go outside the law when necessary.  Melissa McCarthy is her usual funny character, unabashedly taking advantage of the system -- midway through the movie, we find out her real story and realize the basis of her outlaw ways.  I thought it was warma and fuzzy, while there was still a preservation of her outrageousness -- very funny.  A lot of slapstick comedy -- I laughed out loud several times during this movie.

Many of the things which happen in the first part of the movie, I watched with grim discomfort. Foul language is also a problem for some, including me, and it is present in this movie.

5211494,1,B0090JB6DC,"When I was in college, a movie came out called The Mexican.  It had everything going for it: Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt starring, Gore Verbinski directing, getting released by Dreamworks.  All of those things together should have made a truly amazing movie, and they, instead, made the biggest on screen disaster I think I have ever forced myself to sit through.  I won't walk out on a movie.  I figure, for my 10 bucks, I owe it to myself, as well as the film makers, to at least watch an entire film. Identity Thief falls into the same realm as The Mexican--this should be comic gold, and it's horrible.  It's so horrible that I am actually a bit sad.  I hate to see what happens when good people make bad movies, and Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy are both brilliant actors.  Seth Gordon has made some great movies.  This is not one of them.

The main problem that faces Identity Thief is the exact same thing that doomed The Mexican--it has no idea what it wants to be.  The Mexican had moments that were romantic comedy, moments that were action film, moments that were suspense thriller, and none of them were really fledged out very well nor did they mesh in a way that seemed at all natural, leaving a movie that just sat there and did nothing.  Identity Thief wants to be funny, heart warming, rude, action packed, suspenseful, and over-the-top in all of those areas.  It probably is possible for a movie to do that, but this one doesn't.

It wants to be a buddy movie, but the buddies actually hate each other for at least 3/4 of the film.  It wants to have dramatic tension in it, but the comedic scenes short-circuit those moments.  It wants you to have an investment in these characters, but they are manipulated so heavily by the script that you never get a sense that they are making decisions or acting on their own.  These are people put in situations for the sake of maintaining a plot that has a very clear A to B to C trajectory that suffocates any potential for the characters to actually begin to seem like real people.

It also doesn't help that you spend the first half hour angry and hating almost everyone except the two main characters, who are only marginally likable.  Jon Favreau is so good at being despicable in his cameo that you're actually filled with rage if you have even a minor sense of decency in your body.  John Cho's character is flopped back and forth by the needs he serves to the plot that he is not a character so much as a device.  You also get very little sense of Jason Bateman's family beyond the vaguest, most glancing sketch.  For all intents and purposes, his character of Sandy could just as easily be single for this movie, but a family provides a few cookie-cutter emotional moments near the end to try to garner sympathy from the viewers.

Don't do it.  Melissa McCarthy and Jason Bateman are brilliant, but this movie completely wastes them on a cheap set-up on a predictable trajectory surrounded by paper-thin stereotype characters (the sociopathic red neck, the Latino drug dealer, the lonely good-ol' boy) who drag the entire ship down with them.  No actor could have saved this, ever.  Not even with a miracle from on high.  This is a steaming pile of a movie, and it makes me want to cry because I wanted so badly to love it, to even like it a little bit.  Ultimately, though, Identity Theft is like that abusive ex-lover you finally got the restraining order against--no matter how much you try to read the best into it, to make it seem better than it is, it will just throw another thing at you that makes you realize the lie you are telling yourself.  At its very best, it is a derivative comedy that squanders great talent.  At its worst, it's just mean-spirited and lazy.  These actors all deserve much better, and whoever green-lit this deserves to live in an alley for a couple years to think about what he did wrong.",1370390400,,3894,4.4978662873399715

5211498,2,B0090JB6DC,"Plot:
Woman steals people's identities and one of them just happens to be a man who is a hard working Joe who is supposedly being ripped by his employer because he doesn't make as much money as the CEO. He gets into trouble, almost loses his dream job, and decides to track her down and make her confess to get his life back.

Comments:
Very few funny lines. McCarthy shouldn't be able to headline a movie as she isn't up to it. She isn't as funny as you would have hoped. She is foul, trying to be funny. She thinks just saying something in a mocking way is funny and twisting her mouth sideways is funny. It isn't. Jason Bateman is the same character I have seen him in in every movie I have seen him in--think Horrible Bosses. He is one dimensional. And he just seems washed out and tired. . . looks it too. He isn't funny. He is kinda pathetic.

Yet again we are supposed to buy into this liberal idea that all ""mean people"" are really ""good people"" who just need to be loved. The idea that someone is an identity thief because they were a foster child is absurd at best. And the idea that all you have to do is be-friend criminals and care for them and they rehabilitate themselves is just lunacy. But that is what this movie is selling. And just because they put some hip music with two well known actors to it doesn't make it any more true.

There is the socialism sub-text that the Obama administration has been peddling. Jason Bateman's character supposedly does more work than the founders of his employer and they get 100% more money than him which is ""unfair"". Whatever. Funny how his character takes all the clients with him a few coworkers who defect to start their own company so he can make $250K a year. I guess ""he"" deserves it because it is him. That is what socialism, to me, is about. And this movie throws it right in there.

Profanity is just a lazy person's attempt at being ""funny"". It isn't funny. It is just offensive. And that is what 98% of this movie's ""humor"" is . . . filthy comments and innuendo. And when you have a character you are supposed to feel sorry for and then identify with and then root for . . . having them be a disgusting immoral person isn't the way to do it for most self-respecting viewers. Even Bateman's character calls her ""disgusting"". She is.

Also McCarthy really should lose some weight. She is just painful to watch. Big is  NOT beautiful. It is just unhealthy. It is NOT funny. It is just gross. She looks like someone made up like a clown waddling around with big hair and a dumb wild eyed look on her face. Watching her in those highway scenes running in slow motion because she is so short and overweight she can't move is just sad. I am not being mean or derogatory but honest. It is just so unhealthy.",1370304000,2,2766,4.319845857418112

5211500,1,B0090JB6DC,"I will never understand why Jason Bateman is in these big blockbuster comedy movies...he is SO unfunny...not even a little funny on occasion.  And he is boring to the extreme.  I don't know how his career got revived from being in Hogan Family and teen wolf 2 in the 80s..disappearing for decades then the past few years appearing in all these movies.  He must have an amazing agent or is really good buddies with other big actors who got him in.  He is beyond lame.  And I don't know why everyone makes a big deal out of Mccarthy...she is 100 percent not funny either.  All she contributes to any of her movies is potty humor and jr. high school type scripted jokes.  Both of these actors, especially McCarthy, try way way too hard for the laughs.  You can always tell when an actor is genuinely funny and when they are feigning to be funny and expecting the laughs.  And as we all know when people try very hard to be funny and expect the laughs, they are not funny.  Two of the most totally unhumorous people in a movie.  What horrible casting.

The past 5-10 years so called ""blockbuster Hollywood"" movies are truly so bad its beyond comprehension.  This movie makes the Hangover seem funny.  Don't waste your time or money.",1370304000,,1228,4.497737556561086

I can be entertained by good guys, by really evil bad guys, and even by inept and bumbling detectives.

Or how about slamming a guitar against someone's head? It's slapstick a la Three Stooges without the talent. This movie does not have the right ingredients for a decent movie.

While we did chuckle a few times, most of the movie was awkward to watch. First of all, I don't think the premise is funny - identity theft is a horrible crime.

I went into this movie expecting that maybe the identity theft was a one time thing with Melissa's character somehow stumbling into a situation she couldn't back out of. But to see that she was actually a life-long career criminal made it difficult to laugh off. The audience is expected to sympathize with the character when they learn some of her back story, but it didn't work for me. There is no way to escape the fact that she is a terrible person.

Sandy is forced to act on his own as he goes to Florida to ask Diana to please return to Colorado with him to explain to his wife and boss how he can not be in Florida and Colorado at the same time.

Now at this point the film becomes improbable as our duo transverse the county being pursued by the bad guys in a comedy that falls flat as the film takes on aspects of ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles"" minus the humor.

I took my friend, my auntie and uncle who are almost 80 years old and we were all laughing. I recommend it.",1366934400,5,440,4.011363636363637

I'm not 100% sure but it felt like she was improving most of her part and Bateman doing what he does best (playing the straight man) makes this movie much funnier then it could have been. The cast alone makes the movie worth seeing. Overall, a movie with a weak plot made hilarious by the perfect casting. I give it a B+.",1366934400,10,1051,4.28643216080402

I thought this movie was going to be hilarious, but i didn't laugh much watching the film. What i did find with the film was that it had a lot of heart.
The real Sandy Patterson, (Jason Bateman) realized that the fake Sandy Patterson (Melissa McCarthy) was just a lonely woman hiding behind a mask. She was abandoned by parents when she was born and raised in foster homes. I felt bad that she had to have such a s***ty childhood. Granted it doesn't give her an excuse to steal people's identities and she realizes that at the end. And she does do time in prison, but at the end she ended up with a family with the real Sandy Patterson, which i thought was nice.

If you are looking for laughs, i wouldn't come to this movie, some things were funny and some was a bit dry for my taste. But overall, i thought the movie was pretty decent and worth a watch",1366761600,,866,4.242424242424242
5211653,1,B0090JB6DC,"Some films should come with a government health warning.  IDENTITY THIEF is one of these.  The premise is a good one: nondescript financial services operative Sandy Patterson (Jason Bateman) is a victim of a credit card fraud, in which his identity is stolen by professional con-artist Diana (Melissa McCarthy). Sandy travels to Florida to confront Diana; and the two of them embark on a picaresque journey back to Sandy's home city of Denver, so that Diana can right some of the wrongs she caused.  The film's major shortcoming, however, is that it's just unfunny.  For those who like gross-out jokes about sex and a continual stream of coarse invective, I suppose it might have some attraction. Melissa McCarthy does the best she can with the script, but I wonder why director Todd Philips should find it necessary to make jokes at the expense of her size. Perhaps he felt a desperate need to spice up a plot that grinds its way towards the expected - and tiresomely sentimental - conclusion, in which order is restored and wrongs righted.",1365811200,15,1041,4.831460674157303

5211659,3,B0090JB6DC,"This was a movie that I wanted to love. It was funny, but not hilarious. It just fell short, particularly after how relentlessly it was marketed. It will be best seen with a large group of people, either in a theater or at a party.

Sandy Patterson (Jason Bateman) is a businessman in Denver with a growing family and a job he needs, but is undervalued. He takes a risk and changes employers, and all seems to be going in the right direction until he is told that his credit cards are maxed out and there is a warrant out for his arrest. To save his family and job, he goes to Winter Park, Florida to track down the identity thief, intending to bring her back to Colorado where the police and his employer can fix everything. But when his plan goes awry when he confronts ""Sandy Patterson"" (Melissa McCarthy) and must go on the run with her to avoid even more unsavory characters who want to catch her.

There are moments when this is a VERY funny film. There are also moments when it wants to be and fails. And then there are a number of half-funny moments.

The real problem is the identity thief herself. The more the audience gets to know Melissa McCarthy's character, the less funny the film is. I'm not used to a comedy that loses laughs as it progresses. Additionally, there is barely any explanation of exactly why others are chasing her. There's a vague reference to their motivations, but nothing that is ever developed (or develops into anything satisfying or funny).

The bottom line is, it was marketed as a big-laugh comedy, and the laughs are not frequent enough. I don't know that I would recommend it for a full-priced theater ticket.",1364083200,9,1651,4.511705685618729

5211683,3,B0090JB6DC,"Okay, here goes, here is the archaic plot of ""Identity Thief"" (hereafter IDT) in one (long) sentence:

""Wannabe yuppie Colorado bank executive Sandy Bigelow Patterson (Jason Bateman) locates the woman with multiple aliases who stole his identity (Melissa McCarthy) in Florida and attempts to drag her back to Denver to make her confess to the police and accelerate his name-clearing process.""

Perhaps movies like ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles"" (Steve Martin and John Candy), ""The Last Detail"" (Jack Nicholson and Randy Quaid), or even the obscure ""Chasers"" (Tom Berenger) popped into your mind if you read the plot synopsis above or saw IDT.  That would be quite understandable, since IDT is a frenetic mash-up of those movies, with ""Planes,.."" comprising a majority of the mix.  Does the combination work?  With a supreme effort of will, IDT does because of the raucous, powerhouse, go-for-broke acting of Ms. McCarthy, worthy distaff avatar of late comedic legends John Belushi, Chris Farley, and John Candy.

McCarthy's character (let's choose Diana) is wily, tough, profane, boisterous, covetous, flamboyant, and exasperating.  No wonder Sandy has his arms full attempting to persuade her to do the impossible and confess to her chronic identity crimes.  As if that weren't enough, Diana has a relentless, scruffy bounty hunter/skip tracer (Robert Patrick) and two slick, deadly hit people Julian (T.I.) and Marisol (Genesis Rodriguez) hunting her down.  The strait-laced, risk-abhorring Sandy leaves his comfort zone far behind as he and Diana go on a road trip through the nine circles of hell.  Just about everything that can go wrong does, and I'll leave it at that.

Because IDT (and especially McCarthy) bust a spleen to make you laugh, you probably will laugh unless you are a strictly logical and sober prude.  Even though McCarthy slams the ground running early in the picture establishing her outrageous, protean character by going drunk and crazy at a bar, including running up a $1,248 tab on a phony credit card created from Sandy's personal information, it does take some time for the shenanigans to build momentum because identity theft is a shocking, frightening mess that can happen to anybody.  Eventually, though, you get caught up in the road trip chase and wonder what Diane's, and to a slightly lesser extent Sandy's fate, will be and if it will be good, bad, realistic, or contrived.  In my opinion, their fates are basically a satisfying mixture of all those things.

Let's face it, McCarthy's in-your-face performance props up IDT and makes it pretty decent entertainment.  Like the best comedians, she (and her character) are funny and sad, especially when she explains to Sandy why she steals identities, and reminds us that a good name is one of mankind's most precious commodities.  After IDT, McCarthy should have no problem establishing her acting, comedic, and personal identity.",1362355200,,2919,5.202991452991453
5211684,2,B0090JB6DC,"Melissa McCarthy is a force to be reckoned with. In the space of a few films and one hit television show, she has become a new comedic leading lady, not an easy feat. In her few film performances, she has shown tremendous promise; in ""Bridesmaids"", she proved she was willing and able to do anything for a laugh and in the recent Judd Apatow film ""We are 40 and Whiny"" (or ""This is 40"", but I believe in truth in advertising, Mr. Apatow), her two brief scenes are the best in the film. In fact, one of these plays unedited during the end credits and this provides more laughs than the rest of the two hour plus film. In each film, she imbues her characters with an instant funny quality making each performance memorable and entertaining. The fact that she seems to be willing and able to do anything for a laugh is fairly stereotypical of plus-sized comedians, male or female, but McCarthy also brings a lot of humanity to her characters allowing us underneath the bombastic exterior and making her characters much more believable and interesting than most other comedians.

""Identity Thief"", directed by Seth Gordon (""The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters"", ""Horrible Bosses""), and co-starring Jason Bateman, allows McCarthy to bring all of these traits to her portrayal of Sandy Bigelow Patterson, a bottom feeder living in Florida who steals the identity of Bateman's straight-laced family man Sandy Bigleow Patterson who has just received a promotion at a new financial services firm in Denver. McCarthy is, by far, the best part of ""Thief"", providing the laughs that make the film watchable.

From the moment she first appears, with a big bush of red hair on top of her head, wearing pastel and floral prints, she looks like Lucille Ball on steroids. But throughout the film, she is given moments, many of which are accomplished with a simple look, which help to reveal the pain that drives her character's actions.

Naturally, because Sandy is ruining Sandy's credit history, it is threatening Sandy's new job, prompting Bateman's Sandy to drive to Florida to retrieve the criminal and bring her back to Denver to help him clear up the mess. This type of role, the oppressed Caucasian male doing a slow burn with every new development, is pretty much Bateman's stock and trade. He has played this role before, many times, and he does it so well he should get it trademarked. But while he is perfectly serviceable as the straight man in this comedic duo, the role of Sandy the First doesn't give him a lot to do to make his character interesting or funny. He really isn't either. And that makes ""Identity Thief"" lopsided.

It doesn't help that every other actor in the film is pretty dull and uninteresting. John Cho plays Sandy's new boss and does the role completely straight. Morris Chestnut is the Denver cop who helps Bateman's character figure out what is going on. Again, completely realistic and nothing interesting here. Amanda Peet plays Bateman's wife. She is good, but not funny.

Because the cops are unwilling to lift a finger and do some work, Sandy decides to travel to Florida, on his own, and bring Sandy back to Denver. Roadtrip! Robert Patrick plays a bounty hunter and T.I. Harris and Genesis Rodriguez play two hit men. These three roles prove to be more of a distraction than anything else. Yes, they fulfill their purpose and keep the two Sandys moving towards Denver, but they don't provide a single laugh. Eric Stonestreet (TV's ""Modern Family"") plays an over-the-top small-town realtor who likes to swing. His character has a few moments with McCarthy, but these happen pretty much in the middle of the film. Once Sandy and Sandy move on, his character disappears and no one is around to take his place.

In a road movie, all of the wacky characters the two leads encounter are there to provide little bursts of energy and interest before the leads move on to the next group. In ""Identity Thief"", this doesn't happen so there are long periods when nothing funny happens. Yes, there are laughs but it seems like you have to travel miles to get to the next one. In the recent ""Guilt Trip"" starring Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen, the supporting characters, most of whom are played by well-known character actors, pop up along the journey. Yet, each of them barely registers. So the focus of the film is on Streisand and Rogen. They actually fare better because there is a little more give and take in their relationship. Streisand has some laughs and some drama. Rogen has some laughs and some drama. In ""Thief"", everything rests on McCarthy's shoulders.

The slow burn thing that Bateman does is necessary to the film, because there needs to be a more normal person at the center of the journey. He has played this character before and could probably do the role in his sleep. When the role is played completely straight, as it is here, there are just no laughs and it becomes boring. There are a few moments when he has the opportunity to let loose and do something, anything for a laugh but these are not taken advantage of and become wasted opportunities. Each time, it seems like his slow burn is supposed to carry these moments into a laugh - he frequently reacts to someone by saying ""Really?"" in a low voice. But because we expect this type of behavior from him, it doesn't surprise or shock us when he reacts. Even though Bateman does this character well, I am bored with it and wish he would do something different and radical.

Seth Gordon first made his mark with a really good documentary called ""The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters"" about two rivals competing for a title in the arcade game industry. Then, Hollywood swooped in and put him at the helm of some very mediocre big budget studio comedies. ""Four Christmases""? Yikes! But last year, he made one of the best comedies released by a studio. ""Horrible Bosses"" is just different; the characters don't do what we expect them to do, the story is funny and the laughs are dark. It also provided a burst of energy to Jennifer Aniston's career, casting her as a character so different from any we have seen before. ""Bosses"" also stars Bateman, again doing the slow burn, but because he decides to get even with his boss (Kevin Spacey), Bateman has more to do and delivers more laughs. He is also one member of a trio of buddies, a modern-day Three Stooges and he plays well with Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day. In ""Thief"", Gordon takes a step backward and presents a pretty routine road trip comedy.

""Identity Thief"" is uneven, routine and unexceptional except for the laughs generated by Melissa McCarthy. But I don't think these moments are enough to warrant anything more than a bargain matinee. Maybe.",1361923200,,6709,4.707836456558773
5211685,4,B0090JB6DC,"If you enjoyed Jason Batemen as the put-upon, sane family member/lead in the short-lived TV series Arrested Development, you will probably enjoy him here. If you enjoyed Melissa McCarthy's in Bridesmaids, you will find many more moments of genius lunacy.

My one fear was that the trailer had all the funny set pieces, but not by a long shot. The movie was funnier.

This is a movie in the Hollywood tradition of road trips from hell on a deadline. (Think Rat Race or Trains, Planes and Automobiles.) I also found the revelations about her background made the outcome more satisfying. I'm happily in the 'it's a darn funny movie' camp.

I suspect other reviewers who hated it will mark this 'unhelpful,' but that just goes to show you. Take those negatives with grain of salt. I believe you will enjoy it, if you enjoyed the movie trailer of it.",1361750400,89,845,4.657718120805369
5211686,1,B0090JB6DC,"Identity Theft stars Melissa McCarthy as Diana, an ambitious con artist that makes her living by stealing other peoples identities.  Her latest victim, Sandy Bigelow Patterson (Jason Bateman) discovers his credit cards have been maxed out, his credit rating has been destroyed  and the only way he can keep his new job is to bring the culprit to justice on his own.  Patterson flies to Florida and is forced to convince Diana to accompany him from Florida to Colorado in order to clear his name, all the while they are being followed by a group of individuals seeking revenge for another one of Dianas recent cons.  John Cho, Robert Patrick, Amanda Peet, T.I. and Jon Favreau also star in supporting roles to round out the cast.

First things first  Melissa McCarthy should absolutely be praised for this role, due in large part to her massive amount of charisma and outlandish shenanigans.  Her effortless knack for turning obvious dull punch lines into acceptable humor is the only saving grace to be found in such a dismal film.  She is the ONLY shining star in this disastrous film  and without McCarthy here to save it, this could easily have been a far worse movie than it already is.  At this point, theres absolutely no reason to delve into the plot, since its so overly outlandish and absolutely ridiculous.

Outside of McCarthys often Chris Farley-ish slapstick, and mostly raunchy comedy  it should continuously be stressed how remotely uninteresting his film truly turns out to be.  Jason Bateman is probably one of the most forgettable actors in all of Hollywood and its shocking that hes even given any kind of starring role.  In all honesty, there are very few actors that could have been any less entertaining than Bateman and its almost unbearable to have to sit through any film where he is given a feature role.  He brings very little to the table and there are countless other actors/comedians that would have been a better fit for this particular film.  Its not very often that anyone says this, but where was Ryan Reynolds when we needed him?

Overall, Identity Theft is not worth one single dollar of your hard earned money and its definitely not worth the lengthy two hours of your time, which youll wish you had back.  Other than Movie 43, Identity Theft is easily the worst film thus far in 2013.  True enough, its only February  but films released this month are typically a good indicator of the quality of the film.  With very few memorable moments to speak of, Identity Theft easily lands itself in the worst movie of the year category.  This overly poor attempt to be funny will only serve to remind you of the current sad state of Saturday Night Live.  So, a word to the wise:  steer clear of this film at all cost.

IDENTITY THIEF, a perfectly entertaining comedy/road trip flick from Seth Gordon, is one of those instances. This year's first $100-million grossing film has taken critical brickbats and has even seen Rex Reed tear apart Melissa McCarthy's weight (nice going Rex -- plenty of things I can say about you but won't!), but the film itself is a crowd pleaser: good natured, funny in places, with solid chemistry between McCarthy as the frizzy haired title character and Jason Bateman as the hapless working man whose identity she steals. She's great, and the movie does enable her to do something more than play the ""crazy big woman"" in its second half, with some effective dramatic beats. Bateman is game too, and while the film isn't hilarious or particularly memorable, it is highly enjoyable especially if you like road-trip flicks with mismatched characters. Certainly there are worse ways to spend a couple of hours at the movies, which is exactly the type of thing that ""Identity Thief"" functions well as -- a decent timekiller with the two leads playing off each other extremely well. No wonder why viewers have enjoyed it for what it is instead of critics like Rex Reed, who needs to get over himself -- and get a life on top of it.",1361577600,3,1323,4.8584070796460175

  * Jon Favreau (""Iron Man 3"" yes, they are filming right now!) is Harold Cornish, Sandy's smarmy boss we love to hate.
  * Amanda Peet (""Gulliver's Travels"") is Sandy's wife Trish, who really, really wants to trust her besieged husband.
  * Morris Chestnut (""Think Like a Man"") brings a little sanity to the screen as Detective Reilly who is fair and logical, even though Sandy's story IS a bit outlandish; he's sorry his hands are tied by bureaucratic red tape.
  * Robert Patrick (""Gangster Squad"") is Skiptracer, a tenacious, tough guy who just won't give up.
  * Genesis Rodriguez and T.I. (both lots of TV) are the assassins dispatched by the cartel to settle the score with Sandy.
