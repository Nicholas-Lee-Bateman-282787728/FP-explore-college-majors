8490459,1,B00008L408,"The dialogue was so mundane and predictable it was almost hard to watch.  The acting was at best tolerable.  The drama begins with a typical young married couple with infidelity problems.  (wow, that's original)  The wife has an affair with her husband""s best friend.  The couple move away to start over and low and behold the husband is attracted to pretty but quite shallow co-worker.  Even though he barely knows her and she is very  superficial and has a fiance, he ""loves"" her.  He also loves his wife.  You can guess the rest.",1217462400,,532,4.634408602150538
