8343324,4,B001UD1Z46,"The adventures of Darth Vader's under achieving nephew is a good laugh. Rather than take over the galaxy, Chad is the Night shift manager trying to get his position back as Day shift manager. He may be an idiot, anal retentive bumbler and a complete moron, but that is not enough to get someone sacked. If you enjoy seeing people make complete fools of themselves, either look for Question time in Tasmanian parliament, or Chad Vader.",1382313600,,434,4.723684210526316

8343326,5,B001UD1Z46,"funny little spoof, good angle with chad (darth's twin brother) struggling with life and all too human.  funny use of lines from the movie, and some other zany little tangents.  created by some dudes from madison, episodes are about 6 minutes and feature cute music and titles.  the giggles lay in the contrast between darth's impeentrable image and chad's bumbling zeal.",1292889600,7,371,5.049180327868853
