8168469,5,B00004CJVX,"I found this in a pawnshop on VHS and I could not resist. Gary Busey + 80's action movie + Eye of the Tiger theme song= how did I miss this! This is almost as good as Roadhouse, which is the gold standard for eighties action movies. If you like Roadhouse, check this out. You will be glad you did. Mad props to Gary Busey for this one. I can't believe it took me 25 years to actually find this.",1302566400,3,394,3.9375
