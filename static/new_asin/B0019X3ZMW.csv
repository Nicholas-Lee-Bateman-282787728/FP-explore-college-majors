I took it out of my dvd player and put it away in the garbage can where it belongs.
it was a waste of time and money to make such a crappy movie.",1334707200,,231,3.549019607843137

5.0 out of 5 stars I can't even begin to fathom.., December 11, 2007
By  M. DeForge - See all my reviews
(REAL NAME)
I can't even begin to fathom the poor reviews this movie has earned.

This film is an indie war film and offers a fascinating story and dramatic storyline.

I could only ascertain that those whom submitted a bad review have absolutely to even watch the film.

When I first viewed this movie, I was under the immediate impression that it was made in the 50's based upon the dull coloring and acting. however I quickly became succumbed to the method in which this movie truly shines - the elements of ethnic drama and life.

View this movie if you adore war movies, have a willingness to enjoy a film for what it is, and not special effects, and if you don't immediately expect the demoralization of other nations aside from the usa. This movie poses no preference in accordance to usa/germany, and I think that's what initially throws everybody off. After all; how could a movie not truly exemplify the horrific nazi's as the monsters they were? This film doesn't; and emphasizes an element that is more important; the element of reality and humanism.

Two thumbs up.",1265932800,,1235,4.590909090909091
