'The Syrian Bride' released in '04 is a magnificent and profound examination of the many boundaries that divide individuals, families, religious communities, political persuasions and national identities. The setting is the Golan Heights played out against the backdrop of the northern border between Israel and Syria. A community of Druze Moslems have a wedding to celebrate, the bride on the Israeli side, the groom on the Syrian side.

When the moment arrives for the bride to give up her Israeli citizenship and cross the border never to return to her homeland the myriad of difficulties that arise during her attempted crossing can be viewed on numerous of levels;

1- A fascinating political statement on the absurd and uncompromising tatics used on both sides of the border to make the crossing difficult that only worsens the attitudes of both Arab and Jew.
2- An allegorical statement on the loss of humanity and personal identity caught in the wheels of bureaucracy and national interests.
3- A symbolic image of the various types and forms of borders that divide us that can only be overcome if someone is willing to take a chance and be bold enough to take the first step towards reconcillation.

Amazing film and another superb perfomance by the lovely Hiam Abbass. My highest rating: 5 Stars!",1197763200,,1408,5.030042918454936
