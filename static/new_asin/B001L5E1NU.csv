8317302,4,B001L5E1NU,I feel this is good instruction on different yogic breathing techniques.  Tim Kelly took the time to explain how different yoga type breathing techniques affect human anatomy.  He did a good job in demonstrating the techniques and the illustrations were helpful.  I gave it a 4 rating instead of a 5 because in my opinion the music was distracting and too loud during the instruction. Recommended.,1360886400,2,397,4.984848484848484
