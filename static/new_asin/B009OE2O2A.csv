5359485,5,B009OE2O2A,"I barely remember this show as a kid but when I heard it was coming out on dvd in seasonal sets, I just had to get it. I was not disappointed. Every episode is different. There is every type of delima imaginable so it's not boring. If you are a babyboomer, you will probably find this show very entertaining. Even if you are younger, or have never seen the show, I think you'll like it. The price is exceptionally reasonable too. I highly recommend this set.",1361145600,9,458,4.337209302325581

5359487,5,B009OE2O2A,TGG have done a very good job restoring Sea Hunt (well I presume they have as I could not find any mention of it on the box or individual DVD cases) - I suspect that even with restoration underwater scenes won't be as clear as video taken on land but the underwater shots are reasonably good so I am more than happy with my purchase.,1360886400,,333,4.138461538461539
5359488,5,B009OE2O2A,At last we a have a professional remastered release of one of the best TV shows of all time. After years of bad bootlegs its  so great to see. Great picture quality & sound.

5359542,5,B009OE2O2A,Love this series.  The acting is great.  Love the underwater footage.  Each episode is full of suspense and it doesn't always turn out the way you think it will.  We've now purchase all 4 seasons of Sea Hunt.  My only regret is that it is not in color.,1401840000,2,252,4.166666666666667

5359545,5,B009OE2O2A,I used to watch Seahunt in the 60's I purchased Season 3 and Season 4 and I just love them. The underwater scenes would be great in color but sadly these are all in black and white. They're still great to watch. They have great plot lines and keep your attention. There are 5 discs in this season Each disc has 8 shows on them. I would recommend these to every Seahunt fan and to all those who enjoy scuba diving themselves. .,1395446400,,426,4.144578313253012

5359564,4,B009OE2O2A,"Saw the B&W originals over 50 years ago and the quality/resolution  of these DVD's is superb. Plot lines run a little thin, and the technical errors in the underwater scenes are as entertaining as the episodes themselves... For what they are, a protrayal of our early heritage, I am pleased with them beyond measure...

5359566,5,B009OE2O2A,"Sea Hunt,Season Three,like the last two seasons,is a solid television show of family entertainment. Lloyd Bridges is the star who put the show over with his good looks and scuba smarts. Mr. Bridges already knew a thing or two about skin diving previous to shooting the show and his water""chops"" just got progressively better as it wore on. By the time the show ended in season four,he was doing stunts his stand in had previously done. The show looked realistic and authentic,and in many ways,it was. Sure there are the odd shows that have back screens and a prop boat,with the actors on it, weaving back and forth in the ""water"" below,but generally the whole crew was out on open water and below the surface doing their shooting. It is amazing what they accomplished.
In previous season reviews on Sea Hunt I have mentioned how tough it must have been to conduct actors and stunt people underwater. Well in this season the video picture is so clear that there are times when you can see small thin white lines attached to the divers,and on cue they are tugged,which signals the actors to go into tumbles as the scene dictates. The director couldn't just yell""Ok,roll over ...NOW!"",could he? Lamar Boren,who I have neglected to mention in other season reviews,is the man who was responsible for much of the pioneering underwater photography you see in this show. His work was nothing short of astonishing considering the conditions he worked under.
Last season saw the debut of Lloyd's son Jeff,and this season we see his other son Beau. Also not too far into this season there is a wonderful show featuring the talented Victor Buono. There is not an ep before or after like it. The camera seems mesmerized by his acting as he chews up every inch of the scenery. The intensity is something else to behold and you really have to see it to grasp just HOW intense it was. This season there is an emphasis on Bridges character Mike Nelson being a member of the Coast Guard Auxiliary. He also seems to be getting into quite serious situations tangling with foreign powers and in unstable Latin American countries. A definite sign of the times.
Throughout these seasons,though the picture quality is beautiful,there are the odd sound drop outs and even rarer picture glitches. On the third disc of this season,for example,I believe ep#1,there is a slight picture glitch where the picture for a split second stops and starts. I tried it on three different players and all had the same result. It is either something inherent in the show tape or in the production of the disc itself. When they occur they tend to throw you a bit as the picture is so good it looks as it was filmed just yesterday,so you just aren't expecting anything to happen.
As with the other seasons the discs come on two volumes,both sitting inside what I call a ""card box"".You lift the lid and there are the two sets. Inside the first keep case is a stack of three pancaked DVDs. In the other case is a DVD snapped onto a spindle on the back of the case,while the first one sits on a movable spindle,like a book page.
All in all another fine season of Sea Hunt starring Lloyd Bridges. It is a show I thought would never officially see the light of day again,and I am SO happy it has been put out by TGG.They are to be commended,as is MGM for doing a proper job on restoring the picture quality and bringing it back to vivid life.",1372982400,7,3394,4.583881578947368
5359567,5,B009OE2O2A,Great old tv series in black and white.  You just gotta love Mike Nelson.  Very good audio and video quality.,1372982400,,109,4.4

5359578,4,B009OE2O2A,I watched this when I was very young.  I did not remember Mike's fascination with women as that was not what  I thought of back then.  Interesting early sixties slant on the world but fun to watch.  Why does Mike always have more tanks than all other divers?,1372723200,,258,4.3125
5359579,5,B009OE2O2A,This whole TGG set is good. See previous review about broadcast or better quality. Love to see the lineup of guest stars including a very young (pre-Hawian Eye-Wild Wild West) Robert Conrad. Fun stuff.,1371686400,,201,4.9411764705882355
5359580,5,B009OE2O2A,great show! the picture and sound rate a 10. i loved this show as  a kid and watching it now just proves how bad the picture and sound was in the 60's. enjoy!.,1371513600,2,159,3.8181818181818183

5359583,5,B009OE2O2A,"If you love 1950's black & white serial television series, Sea Hunt is one of the best. These episodes have only been available on home made DVDS from VHS tapes, and now you can enjoy it straight from the MGM vaults. Get the entire series while you can-the transfers are almost crystal clear, considering the technology available to a low budget series in 1958. Lloyd Bridges is amazing as Mike Nelson. scuba diver extraordinaire.",1369526400,,430,4.824324324324325

5359585,5,B009OE2O2A,My brothers and sisters used to reenact Sea Hunt episodes in the family kiddy pool. We once used all the play money out of our Monopoly set to reenact an underwater bank robbery when Mike captured the culprits trying to escape underwater.,1367193600,,238,4.690476190476191

5359587,5,B009OE2O2A,"See my reviews of Seasons One and Two.

I have viewed all thirty-nine episodes of Season Three. The Season Three stories are in general a little more sophisticated than the previous two seasons. Mike photographs swimsuit models, spies on the Mafia, dodges underwater radiation, rescues eight-year-old Morgan Brittany from a mine shaft and Beau Bridges from a storm drain, and finds underwater cannabis.

The wonderful picture quality continues, and makes these episodes a real joy to watch.",1364428800,2,490,5.35064935064935
8543358,5,B009OE2O2A,"You like it underwater? Then look no further (or is that farther?). Down, down, down you'll go with every episode, deeper, deeper, a little more deeper still, and if you get the BENDS, you're in luck this time because Mike Nelson (if you've never seen the show, remember that name, but if you are a seasoned Sea Hunt devotee, you'll never forget it), as played by Lloyd Bridges, knows all the stops and when to make them.

With every episode he teaches you new tricks of undersea survival (although your life's ambition may be to swim through a dense kelp bed, it might not be such a brilliant idea, for example), all the while having a blast wearing the wetsuit and being recognized by most everyone as the most preeminent scuba diver the world ever did see, hear, or speak to (at least for the time period and in the confines of this television show).

About the only thing you won't find here on this show is flying saucers, and it's a shame there never was a tie-in with, say, The Outer Limits, for just one tiny episode, so we could witness how Mike Nelson might introduce the concept of ""buddy-breathing"" to inhabitants of another planet whose atmosphere is not quite the same as ours.

Don't let that dissuade you though, because this show is more fun than a barrel of sea-monkeys, and you NEVER see those for sale in the back of magazines anymore.",1512432000,,1355,4.522448979591837

8543367,5,B009OE2O2A,Lloyd Bridges is the star of this classic T.V. program of the 50`s and 60`s which introduced the Television audience to the fascinating world of the scuba diver as this type of underwater sport was relatively new at the time.  Season three offers plenty of action both underwater and on the surface.  For the lovers of classic T.V. this is a must have for your library.  If you can I would suggest you buy the first and second series from this show first.,1429574400,,455,4.457831325301205
