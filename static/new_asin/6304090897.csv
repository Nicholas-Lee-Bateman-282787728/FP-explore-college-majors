7860852,5,6304090897,"The idea of ""Is This Goodbye, Charlie Brown?"" came from a cartoon story Schulz published in 1966. To think that 2 of Schulz's most important characters would be written out of the series was unthinkable (similar in the vein of ""Snoopy Come Home""). Charlie Brown misses his best buddy, Linus, of course. Sally misses him, too (her hopes of her ""sweet babboo"" taking her to the movies would be dashed!). Schroeder reluctantly admits he misses Lucy (piano recitals would never be the same without that pest interrupting him!). Where would Lucy earn all her nickels? Peppermint Patty does her best to help good ol' wishy-washy (and lonely) Chuck. Linus gives his blanket away to Snoopy. The going away party is a scream, with Joe Cool's Party Caterer Services to keep the party alive! One thing I remember about this special is that it came out the same year I moved away from the town I'd lived in for years.  I'd like to see it released on DVD soon like many other Charlie Brown specials and all 4 films!",1055462400,8,1002,4.629213483146067
7860853,5,6304090897,"""Is This Goodbye, Charlie Brown?"" packs the wistful, bittersweet punch of ""Snoopy, Come Home"" into a half-hour package. But, of course, it has a happy ending. The emotions and comedy work well together,  as Charlie Brown grapples to deal with his grief as his best pal, Linus (as  well as his chief nemesis, Lucy), prepares to move away. I particularly  like the denial and willful self-delusion of Sally, who refuses to believe  anything other than that her sweet babboo is coming to take her on a date.  But, eventually, the moving truck pulls away and Linus even parts with his  beloved blanket (leaving it as a gift to Snoopy). Is that how the story  ends!  Watch to find out. This special is poignant without being smarmy --  a feat beautifully executed by the late Charles Schultz.",954720000,17,787,4.727941176470588
