3417818,5,B0018O3MKW,"I've been playing guitar on & off since 1988. By no means do I consider myself some sort of advanced player. With that in mind, I have to give Mark props for this DVD. He not only explains the concept of using the Whole-Step/Half-Step formula for making scales as well as showing you dozens of unique scales and how to play them in a medium then fast tempo.

The patterns he shows you are explained to tell you at which fret to start with what finger. He also explains the concept of octaves which is a valuable lesson in & of itself. He goes on to explain playing scales through two octaves, again not something you typically find in instructional DVD's and great for a beginner to know.

While this is not the CAGED system, he does use show how its done with the patterns given and he shows you literally tons of patterns from the Neopolitan to the Harmonic Major/Minor, to the Oriental/Chinese/Japanese scales & more.

This DVD is not meant to be used as a stand alone lesson becauss he has several other DVD's that cover chords, theory, basics/beginner, tricks, and so on. It's like getting lessons in a format that you can take inexpensively. Hard to complain about an instructional DVD that costs less than $12.00.

I recommend the system to those who are in the beginner to medium stage of development. I give it 5 out of 5 stars for its completeness & understandability.",1298505600,8,1378,4.544354838709677
8270212,4,B0018O3MKW,"Overall a nice guitar scales primer. However, I did not like the instructor's treatment of the modes. He appeared to start each mode of the key in the Ionian tonic note position instead of on the mode of emphasis. I was not taught that way. I was taught to start each mode with its tonic note of emphasis in order to stress its mood. I also thought the instructor went over the modes section without thoroughly explaining it, as well as, too quickly.  Finally, I thought he could have touched on the subject of parallel modes.",1512604800,,526,4.479166666666667

8270219,4,B0018O3MKW,This DVD from Mark Sternal didn't disappoint me once again he covers aspects of scale usage and how modes function in each. If you want clear cut answers and learn something that you will use the rest of your life this is it. He covers a lot of ground to include the exotic scales that you don't hear about or see on youtube. Many of these other scales can be used in many musicial applications. I am so glad I bought this DVD.,1360368000,4,427,4.156626506024097
