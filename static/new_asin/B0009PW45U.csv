8065138,3,B0009PW45U,"Claude Chabrol's Cop Au Vin (aka Poulet au Vinaigre) is no classic but it gets there in the end. All the Chabrol trademarks are here - petit-Bourgeoisie pettiness, small-town secrets, voyeurism, a dominant mother and the obligatory naked butt shot, this time provided by Pauline Lafont (if you're familiar with Chabrol's 70s work it's no secret he's definitely something of a butt-man). Also present and correct are some of the signs of the oncoming decline in his later work that would really come into its own after his last real triumph, La Ceremonie - there's a feeling of being on autopilot at times and the film only really kicks into life with the arrival of Jean Poiret's Inspector Lavardin, who soon belies his amiable exterior with his unquestioning acceptance of violence as the best form of interrogation. It's almost a shame he isn't introduced sooner. The first 40 minutes, while not exactly dull, don't have much spark, and the plot developments are pretty predictable. Major minus is a not-exactly bad but over-stated performance from Stephane Audran that veers too close to caricature without ever quite tipping over to be entirely successful.",1284076800,,1160,5.0785340314136125
8065139,4,B0009PW45U,"When we think of great Claude Chabrol films we rarely turn to his work from the 1980's. The '80's were a difficult time for Chabrol. In fact so were the late '70's. For whatever reason Chabrol was losing his audience, though many times the public unfairly damned him. His ""Innocents with Dirty Hands"" was entertaining as is this film, ""Cop Au Vin"".

 ""Cop Au Vin"" follows in Chabrol's tradition of attacking the upper class and exposing their secret desires, showing them to be less than appealing. But makes this film a little different from some of the others is how Chabrol injects some dark humor. In some ways the film is comparable to Chabrol's latest film ""Comedy of Powers"".

 The film follows Louis Cuno (Lucas Belvaux) a teenager who lives with his invalid mother played by Stphane Audran (Chabrol's ex-wife), who makes his life very difficult, not just because she is his sole responsibilty but because she constantly accusses him of fooling around with women.

 Louis, who works as a mailman, is fooling around with one of his co-workers, the beautiful Henriette (Pauline Lafont, who died at a tragically young age of 25).

 Meanwhile a group of people (played by Jean Topart, Jean-Claude Bouillaud and Michel Bouquet) want to buy the Cuno's house, who do not want to sell. The men harrass Louis daily trying to scare them into selling. So Louis decides to fight back and mysteriously people start dying. This leads Inspector Jean Lavardin (Jean Poiret) on the case.

 It's at this point in the film things start to pick up. Now it starts to take on the more tradition detective genre but because it's Claude Chabrol the movie has an intelligence we do not find in American cop and robber films. Chabrol does this by actually creating characters whom we come to care about and creating situations that involve us but there's also a sense of mystery lurking underneath everything. We feel there is more to the story than is going on. We can expect some twist and turns.

 While the '80's were considered a downfall for Chabrol, some feel he didn't start to rebound until he made ""The Story of Women"" in 1989, ""Cop au Vin"" actually shows Chabrol still had some tricks up his sleeve. I wouldn't go as far as saying this is one of his best films, but, it is entertaining enough to keep you interested through-out.

 Bottom-line: One of Claude Chabrol's better films from a decade most people consider dismal, the '80's. Solid storyline with a good amount of mystery and interesting characters make this film work.",1161820800,5,2521,4.76551724137931
8065140,5,B0009PW45U,"More aptly titled ""Poulet Au Vinaigre"" (Chicken With Vinegar) in France, this quintessential Chabrol whodunit is indeed a pungently sour portrayal of the deadly intrigues that can hatch in seemingly close-knit, placid communities. Extremely well-played, with Poiret a stand-out as Lavardin, a savvy professional who can be courteous one minute, brutal the next. A must for mystery fans.",1125964800,6,386,5.672413793103448
