8330280,5,B001OBMPAW,Just the type of information you should always have when you are buying a new/used Class A. I wish the dealer would of included his full set of these when we got our RV. We have them now. Tons of great information. The type of information you tend to forget from your quick walk thru from the dealer. Glad we have it!,1371600000,,317,4.129032258064516
