7926147,5,B00004XOR0,"I thought Cowboy Bebop was my favorite anime ever, and when I saw the ending to the series ending, it only strengthed my belief. It answers all the questions that you may have wanted the answers to and some you didn't want the answers to. There are even answers to questions you didn't even know existed. That only begins to tell you the quality of the product and the series. To sum it up it one word: beautiful.",1006473600,5,413,4.3076923076923075
7926148,5,B00004XOR0,"The first half of Cowboy Bebop was really good, but this one is even better. Vol. 8 has Faye and Jet's past revealed. Vol. 9 has Ed's solo episode and Faye's VCR hunting. Vol. 10 has a really great episode reminisint of the first tape. Vol. 11 is the most hilarious tape of Bebop. Vol. 12 has a little going away party for some of the characters and Vol. 13 is by far the most serious, violent and provoking two episodes I've ever seen. The first box set was merely a prelude to all this. Definetly worth buying, however, if you have a DVD player, just buy the DVDs. Either way, you gotta see the second half of Bebop. And the finale won't dissapoint you one bit. Promise.",973296000,3,672,4.2578125
