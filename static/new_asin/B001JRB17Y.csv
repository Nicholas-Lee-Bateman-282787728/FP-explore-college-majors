3659567,4,B001JRB17Y,"The Secret of the Magic Gourd is a very lovely film and deserves more notice in the U.S. than it is getting. The first of Disney's Chinese co-productions, the film did respectable business in China, where it is titled ""Bao hu lu de mi mi.""

In the interest of lip synchronization, the young boy's name is changed from ""Bao"" to ""Raymond"" and the Gourd's name is ""Bailey,"" from the Chinese ""Hu lu"" (could it be that the website hulu gets its name from here)?

The story, from a classic Chinese children's book, is a dreamlike, present day tale in which a boy learns to be careful what he wishes for -- a theme explored with horror in ""The Monkey's Paw"" and The Twilight Zone and with humor on I Dream of Jeannie. Some of the wacky antics caused by little Bailey in his earnest attempts to please his ""master"" reminded me very much of ""Jeannie.""

U.S. film and TV makers might take a closer look at Gourd, with its traditional family, caring teacher and pleasant friends. No bumbling dysfunctional parents (or lack thereof), no caricatured authority figures or no snarky, hip-holding preteens here. The kids aren't always nice to Raymond but they do stick with him in the end.

Speaking of hip-holding preteens, the presence of High School Musical star Corbin Bleu is very likely a device to allow youngsters the privilege of watching this movie without eye-rolls and loud sighs from older siblings. But don't underestimate him -- Bleu does a very creditable job. His natural likeability shines through his vocal performance. That's not easy when you've also got to act as well as focus on replacing dialogue recorded and animated for another language.

The film largely rises and falls on whether you like Raymond and especially Bailey, and it succeeds thanks to skillful work by the entire American cast, including Bleu and singer/actress Megan Hilty, under the guidance of Disney veteran Rick Dempsey, who also co-wrote the lyrics to the end title song, ""Worlds of Wonder.""

The English script also avoids an overabundance of pop culture references and slang. Bailey might say one or two Americanized things here and there, but he's not a boogie-ing gangsta gourd, as I'm sure the Chinese version of the Gourd is not either.

Speaking of music, the fine original score by Peter Kam is one of the things I enjoyed most about The Secret of the Magic Gourd, yet I've not seen it available either in an English or Chinese soundtrack album. I'd also like to see an English version of the book.

The bonus material is primarily Chinese promotional documentary footage with English subtitles. It would have been nice to see Bleu and the cast working on the dubbing, a very special kind of acting that takes special talent to carry off properly. All in all, though, the word ""nice"" is the best way to describe the film, and I look forward to the future co-productions.",1233014400,7,2860,4.763636363636364

The Chinese culture experience in this tale will have kids that are 6 and up asking questions about ""why are they doing that?"" or ""Is that how Chinese kids are in school?"" - things of that nature...  All in all though, a cute morality play that only lacks understanding and little continuity problems due to the ""Americanization"" of this traditional Chinese children's book...

3659586,2,B001JRB17Y,"I saw Disney and took a chance.  Bad idea.  They are obviously trying to take the Chinese made film and make money by throwing a High School Musical voice on it.  To clarify, this is a movie from China with voice overs (which are not done very well at all).  That doesn't ruin the movie but doesn't help.  There are a large number of times when there are signs or labels in Chinese and there is no english subtitle?  That is annoying and detracts from the film which is already in trouble.  The basic story is: a day dreaming/lazy chinese school boy wants all his work done without having to life a finger.  He then walks by his little sister being told a ""fairy tale"" about the magic gourd and falls asleep.  When he ""wakes up"" he goes fishing and catches the magic gourd.  Then shockers of shockers he realizes magic can do more harm than good!  The characters are not likable other than the CGI gourd.  I don't know where the frog on the cover comes in.  He shows up a few times but is not explained or fit into the story.
  The really disturbing part of this movie is the main character; he is a very bad example.  His parents are non existent and his grandmother is oblivious.  He is constantly running out of school and wanders around town with no supervision or consequences.  He lies, cheats, steals etc.  Now some of this is part of the ""lesson"" about needing to do your own work and not rely on other people/magic, but a lot of it is him.  OVerall, good CGI, fun gourd character then everything else in downhill.  Poor characters and character development, boring/bad story, horrible voice over, no translation of ubiquitous Chinese symbols.  I would skip this one all together, if you don't believe me, try renting it first.",1307664000,,1735,4.476038338658147
3659587,3,B001JRB17Y,"I viewed this overall as a 'be careful what you wish for' tale, because you just might get it. A young Chinese boy finds a magic gourd and wants his every wish to be fulfilled. Of course, this doesn't happen the way he wants or expects, so eventually he decides it's better to do things the right way than try to take the easy way out. The morality felt pushy, they kept emphasizing the same point over and over. While the cinematograhy and animation was very good the dubbing was not, my 6 year old noticed this right away. She also didn't like how Raymond treated the gourd. Although she did enjoy some parts of the movie, she has no interest in watching it again. It might be good for a rental, but overall we wouldn't buy it again.",1258848000,,735,4.294964028776978
3659588,3,B001JRB17Y,"The Secret of The Magic Gourd is a famous childrens story, written back in the 1950s, that is brought to vivid life by Walt Disney Productions in conjunction with Centro Pictures Entertainment and China Film Group.  It's about a young boy, named Raymond, who has a very vivid imagination but would prefer not to have to work very hard in school to get what he wants.

One day, while fishing, Raymond stumbles upon a mysterious creature, named Bailey, who tells Raymond that he can give him anything he wants.  He only needs to ask.  At first it seems like a child's dream come true, with Bailey providing Raymond with all kinds of things, such as food, toy robots, and different kinds of fish.  But Bailey doesn't always understand Raymond's wishes and makes mistakes that ultimately cause Raymond to look bad in front of the other children at school.  In the end, Raymond learns to become more independent and responsible for his own actions, which enables him to be a good son and a much better student.

The film took several years to complete, with some very impressive CGI effects that bring Bailey, the magic gourd, and all his amazing abilities to life.  Scenes such as one involving Raymond being chased by a dinosaur in a movie scene that's playing at a local movie theater, comes off quite stunningly.  You can really tell that the years it took to finish the production really paid off.  The message of the film is also a very universal one that will appeal to children all over the world.

The problem I had with this US DVD version, lies in the English dubbing of the Mandarin-speaking actors.  It does not fit very well and some of the dialogue is changed in the translation which causes some very awkward moments.  It's almost cartoonish at times, when it shouldn't be.  Happily, the original Mandarin language track (along with another in Cantonese) is also provided on the DVD, which sounds so much more realistic to listen to.  I had a similar experience watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crouching-Tiger-Hidden-Dragon/dp/B00003CXR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</a>, where viewing the film in Mandarin using English subtitles made for a much more enjoyable experience.  Unfortunately, the only English subtitles provided (for the hearing impaired) are for the English-speaking version of the film, so you can never fully understand what the original dialogue, in Mandarin, actually is.  Oddly enough, one of the nicest special features, the ""Making Of"" segment, is completely subtitled due to all the Chinese creator's speaking in their own respective languages.  Raymond's actual Chinese name is Wang Baeo, which you can hear the actor's actually saying in Mandarin for the film, but the English subtitles still say ""Raymond.""  As a result, it's difficult for me to fully recommend this DVD version.

Again, the 25 minute ""Making Of"" is quite good and very informative.  You learn the background of the original story and how long it took to make the film and perfect all the effects.  You can really tell that the creators were quite passionate about this work and wanted to produce the best product possible for the audience.  A definite labor of love to be sure.  A short but humorous segment of bloopers is also provided, as well as a music video and a fun little interactive game.  The music video is sung in Mandarin and no English subtitles are provided, but the song is discussed in the ""making of"" segment, which is subtitled and you can read a few lines of the song from there.

The film looks great shot with a widescreen aspect ratio of 2.35:1 (enhanced for 16x9 TVs) and the 5.1 Surround is quite good too.  Again, the only real marring is the bad English Dubbing, with no true Mandarin translation of the dialogue in English provided.  This will no doubt irritate some purists and cause them to stay away.

3659589,1,B001JRB17Y,"This film is a Disney product.  It's cutsey, kitschy, full of small ... yech ... children, and partly animated.  The only problem is that it's cutsey to the max, kitschier than ""Leave It to Beaver"", and the animation!  ...well, the animation's OK, I guess.

The ""Secret of the Magic Gourd"" is that it's awful.  There certainly isn't any other secret, because what the magic gourd does is telegraphed to you right up front, and the appearance in the narrative is even less of a surprise than the appearance of an E.T. in ""E.T."".  About the only surprise in the whole thing is that the M.G.'s finger doesn't light up.  Imagine the Disney imagineers forgetting that!

The gist of S.o.t. M.G. is that there is a Magic Gourd (yeah, OK, so?) and it will grant you your every wish.  Gourds are singularly unattractive objects (despite the opinions of deluded people who use them as decorations).  Why not a genie?  Disney does great genies.  But no.  We get a yellow gourd with big eyes and an off-side mouth.  A yellow gourd that ... well, here comes the plot.

Raymond Bao is your typical 11-year-old boy.  He's Chinese, which makes him statistically typical.  He's lazy and not interested in doing what it takes to be successful at whatever school wants him to do.  He's heard the story of the Magic Gourd and of course wants to find it.  As things turn out, it finds him.

Gourds are, as you will recall, basically hollow.  This one is no exception, especially in the upper part, where the brains ought to be.  It therefore never thinks wishes through, but grants them very literally, including brainless (of course) speculations as to what ""master"" really wants.

The results are naturally disastrous.  Over and over and over ... and OVER ... again.  You would certainly think somebody would catch on.  The audience ought to right away, but most of reviews of this film seem to indicate a gourd-like quality in the reviewers.  The gourd seems to have caught on in the end, sort of.  Raymond catches on at last and gets rid of the gourd.  He then actually works for a goal (winning a track meet), which of course he does because this is a Disney film.  Not for Disney the moral complexity and ambiguity of trying to explain how it's all right to practice your guts out and still not quite make it.

I'm sure some of you are waiting for the other bits like subplots, subtexts, secondary plots, or anything to make this more than a very long 8-minute cartoon.  Actually, ""Magic Gourd"" is even less complex than an 8-minute cartoon.  Animated humor for children is most successful when it aims some of its content toward adult viewers.  Adults need not apply here.

What we have here is a film that's got a moral point to hammer home, and hammer it does - so much so that even the most retarded 3-year-old will get the point by the time the story's half-way done.  This klutzy production has nothing on its ... um, ... mind but beating its little viewers about their collective heads with a single point.  The lack of variety is positively stultifying.  I was riveted to my seat with boredom.  Any child with half a brain would be, too - I would hope.  Nobody, however immature, should be subjected to this nursery rhyme gone mad.

On the other hand, I can see how children might actually like things like this.  The results from our schools indicate that the little troglodytes flee from mental challenges, despise learning, and are generally less attractive than the pre-Gourd Raymond Bao.  This sort of explains why, for instance, the study of evolution is so unpopular in intellectually challenged areas such as the inbred South and the Midwest.  It's so complicated and hard to understand - like long division.  It's so much easier to believe that some Magic Gourd in the sky made everything.

You can, if you wish, inflict this simplistic film on your children, in between episodes of Barney, Yu-Gi-Oh, Sailor Moon, Pokemon, and other mind-rotting fare.  At least this thing has a worthwhile moral to hammer them with, assuming they enjoy being hammered.",1251936000,,4054,4.685106382978724
3659590,1,B001JRB17Y,"I watch something like ""The Secret of the Magic Gourd"" and wonder what possessed someone to bring it over to the states.  There are plenty of great foreign movies that exist.  Most of what we get are made for adults but I have no doubt good family and children films exist outside of the states.  I can't start listing names of which of these films I consider worth bringing over and what aren't because I haven't seen too many of them, but my first impression of ""The Secret of the Magic Gourd"" is that it deserved to be left on the other side of the pond.  This is a harmless but headache inducing film.  It's one of those films where a young boy has dreams of doing something great and one day gets to do that...with a little bit of help of course.

The story involves said boy who fishes out a magic gourd one day (voiced in English by ""High School Musical"" supporting character Corbin Bleu) who has the ability to grant wishes.  Likewise the boy wishes for a lot of crazy stuff until some of it makes his life more complicated then it needs to be.  And...there's not a whole lot more to say because this is about as complicated as it gets.  This movie was made by Disney in conjunction with Centro, a Chinese film company.  The history behind the film itself is more interesting then anything in this film.  See, Disney has had a long, troubled history with China.  When Disney released Martin Scorsese's film ""Kundun"" they upset the Chinese government a great deal.

The Chinese government, who only lets 20 foreign films into their country each year, made it particularly difficult to crack the market.  This is one of the reasons Disney made ""Mulan,"" to help get on the countries good side again.  Then someone at Disney had the idea if they co-produced a film with a Chinese film company they wouldn't need to fight to get that film on the Chinese market (not a bad idea really).  Thus we now have ""The Secret of the Magic Gourd,"" which is the first in what I expect to be many co-productions between Disney and China.  Obviously the film is not great, but compared to some other Chinese films I've seen this one certainly is very advanced as far as film making is concerned (though by American standards it looks like something you'd see on Cartoon Network).

Sadly, though I didn't like the film much I must insist that in the future Disney take better care of the location.  An English dub is fine but the original language track needs to be provided as well (preferably with subtitles).  This is a Chinese production through and through, so it's perplexing that Disney is trying to pass it off as an American film (the cover itself doesn't clue you into the films origins very much).  I know this is for kids and adults likely won't care, but it seems just a tad disrespectful to still be doing this after the ""Princess Mononoke"" fiasco.  At least the bonus music video is in it's original language.  Do I recommend this film?  No.  For a better family Chinese import I'd recommend Stephen Chow's ""CJ7.""  Still, if Disney plans to get serious about their new partnership with China it could lead to some interesting family films in the future.

3659592,3,B001JRB17Y,"The Disney/Chinese production `The Secret of the Magic Gourd' is a overall well produced film that should keep children adequately entertained for its 85 minute duration. That's if the audience is 7 years old and under. Set in present day, up-scale China it's a contemporary re-visioning of a traditional story about boy meets gourd, a magical one to boot.

This is a story about Raymond, a rather unmotivated dreamer who appears unwilling to exert himself to succeed in anything. When he encounters Bailey, a walking, talking gourd while fishing the amazed Raymond is promised all of his wishes are about to come true. It appears as though he's now the ""luckiest kid on the planet."" However when Bailey begins to take everything Raymond says literally and act on every comment made by his young master things begin to fall apart. Eventually he comes to understand such important lessons as personal satisfaction in one's achievements can only truly be appreciated when obtained honestly and hard work is its own reward.

`The Secret of the Magic Gourd' is a kids only film, utterly lacking any underlying currents of nuanced adult comedy that would attract an over 7 year old audience. The adolescent cast is likeable, but the acting is stiff, while the magical gourd slowly evolves into a rather annoying character that looks like the Mister Potato head from `Toy Story' only without the moustache.",1241222400,,1400,5.0042918454935625
3659593,1,B001JRB17Y,"If there was ever any doubt that China couldn't make ...something (anything!), then this film should put that to rest.

A Disney feature shot entirely in China and dubbed for American audiences (in this version), THE SECRET OF THE MAGIC GOURD is a mixture of Disneyesque proportions with heavy Chinese influences. Although not troubling in terms of entertainment, it is if you're in the entertainment industry. How far will we go to save an extra buck?

The story itself does battle with inconsistencies and an incredibly simple -- if not downright ridiculous -- premise. It is the story of a boy and his ...well ...gourd. A magic gourd rumored to live not far from Bau Hu Lu (Chinese child star Peisi Chen) and spoken of in fable form by Bau's grandmother. The gourd, it is rumored, will grant any wish to whomever is its master. For Bau, who is lazy and wants nothing to do with his school work, it seems like a dream come true when he meets up with the Magic Gourd. But having all your wishes granted can turn to nightmares, as Bau learns. And the lesson is easily transparent for adults and kids alike. Perhaps too transparent.

Bau learns a few life basics by doing his own work and becoming a better person for it. No surprise.

One of the bigger story issues I had was the occasional incorporation of a frog-friend to the gourd who seemed to have no other purpose than to hop around and croak at us a few times. What gives?

Nothing remotely challenging can be found in this hybrid Chinese/American fantasy. Move along.",1240531200,2,1526,4.595588235294118
3659594,3,B001JRB17Y,"Honestly, I wasn't all that impressed with this movie. Was it a straight-to-DVD release? I don't recall seeing it listed in theaters. If so, I guess I could understand why...

The basic premise is about a kid who constantly daydreams and doesn't get much done (school work, etc.). He wants everything done for him. Enter the ""magic gourd"" capable of granting his every whim.

In predictable fashion, he gets everything he wishes for, whether he actually wants it or not. And apparently the gourd is kind of an idiot and keeps screwing up the wishes or fulfilling them in unintended ways. In that way it's kind of like the ""magic genie"" genre, genies being capricious and happy to foul up a wish if you're not careful about how you phrase it.

Equally predictably, the poor kid gets tired of the gourd fouling up his life and decides it's better to do his own work and revel in his own accomplishments...

To me it felt like a pretty standard story, a bit of a rehash that doesn't do anything particularly new or take many risks. Kids might enjoy it... But there are probably better movies out there? Might be worth a rental for the limited novelty?

On the other hand it's kind of nice to see some other culture's attitudes and legends brought to life. Though I think a lot more could have probably been done with it. Say, if it had been made as a period piece rather than being based in a modern school with a kind of hokey plot and equally hokey special effects.

Another plus is that it does contain special feature on the ""making of"" and a music video, some interactive games, etc. Again, worth a rental, but I don't know that it'll have any endearing / enduring value.",1240099200,2,1673,4.5049504950495045

My nephew complained several times that the voices didn't match the way their mouths moved and he's only 5 and a half. Typically they both will just sit there and watch a movie no matter what it is and not move. They had absolutely no interest in this one. I think because it's dubbed in English.

I even had a hard time watching this one as it was dubbed very badly. The only way for this to be any better would have been to subtitle it but then you have the problem of this is a child's movie.....!!!!! They can't read that good!

All in all I think this was a waste of a movie! Might have been good in the original language for those that can understand it and all but not for English speaking children....",1239840000,,908,4.2011494252873565

It wasn't until I started watching it I realized it wasn't what I thought. My seven year old and my three year old really enjoyed the movie. It gave us an opportunity to talk about where the movie was (China) which we live in the US and about the culture there but also the message of the movie - which is it's more rewarding to win and accomplish things on your own vs. cheating or someone doing the work for you. Other reviews have read other messages in the movie which I think are a little far fetched and too advanced for the age of kids this movie targets. My family enjoyed it. I am only giving it 4 starts because the voice over wasn't very good.,1238025600,,763,4.197278911564626
3659597,4,B001JRB17Y,"After viewing this film, the first association I had to my life was the day my Father taught me how to ride a bike.  With training wheels that I thought would never come off, I felt inferior to the other kids in the neighborhood.  I did not believe in myself enough to take the wheels, until my Father said he would simply hold the bike from the back of the seat and run down the street with me. With the wheels off, and my Father behind me, I finally experienced what speed was, instead of wobbling.  It wasn't till I got to the end of the street that I found out my Father was still at the beginning of the street.  I made it all on my own, and promptly fell. After realizing I actually did it, I was able to get the courage to ride the bike back, all the way, bruises and all.

It's not exactly the context of the story, however, it is the exact feeling that the film inspires.  Entirely made for personal interpretation, and more importantly, a stepping stone for children to realize they do not have to depend on others.  Be it selfishness, laziness, carelessness or just plain fear.  It goes in many directions.

With our main character, Raymond, he is simply a daydreamer.  Spending long hours sleeping, escaping, wandering, in his own world.  He is influenced by his Grandmother who tells a Chinese fairy tale about the secret of the magic gourd which is essentially a genie who will grant every wish.

We start the film with Raymond in space, and coming back from a out of this world mission where he is the hero... then he wakes up.  As usual, he gets up late, late for class, late for everything.  Of course, in this daydreaming state of mind, Raymond would never have time for homework.  Therefore, when he goes to math class, he is sure he would never be called to the board... and of course, he is the first that was asked to solve the problem.  He gives up, and then heads to the lake to fish.  It is here that we are introduced by his Granmother's influence, the magice gourd.  I won't tell you how, or many details, but Raymond does come back from the lake with a bucket of goldfish (who will fly in his presence only) ... which is obviously impossible.

At this point, we can do whatever we want... even fly.

Just wish it, and it's done.  Be it chores, laundry,  or even clipping your toenails... the Gourd will do it for you. Everything a child is suppose to do to learn responsibility.

It's a must for all children... of any age.",1238025600,,2773,4.670103092783505
3659598,3,B001JRB17Y,"11-year old Raymond Bao is smart and capable, but doesn't want to conform. He's a daydreamer who disappoints his friends, teacher, and parents by not being a ""team player"" and putting his own dreams and desires above the needs of the group. When, out fishing, he finds a magic gourd that grants his every wish, it seems at first to be exactly what he wanted. He learns, though, that effortless success is unsatisfying.

The film, a Disney production developed in China and with Chinese filmmakers, looks good and the animation is fun. My kids enjoyed the film a lot, and have seen it a few times. I'd compare it somewhat to Stephen Chow's delightful CJ7 - it has a similar feel, except that CJ7 is (frankly) more inventive and amusing and has a more subtle message. - I was especially interested in the way that standard Disney themes (about the need to see things from another's point of view, to get beyond selfishness, and serve others, to rise to the challenge of taking responsibility for others - think The Aristocats or The Lion King or Freaky Friday or even The Emperor's New Groove), the way these Disney themes would translate into a Chinese context. Surprisingly, they translate very well. There is a greater emphasis in this film on ""group values"" - and when Bao finally decides to give up the gourd it is both because he feels he has hurt his friends and because he wants to take initiative for himself. It is significant (spoiler warning!) that the contest he wins is a team effort, and that the reward for taking initiative is that he is accepted back into the group - upon succeeding on his own terms he is praised by his parents and friends and teacher, all of whom seem to feel that his apparent selfishness has turned out for the best because it has brought honor back to them, to his school and his team and his parents.

The secret of the magic gourd mixes live action with computer animation, and is your basic ""careful what you wish for"" story. The actor's interaction with the animated gourd is decent. You do get a feeling of chemistry between them. However, the movie is pretty lame compared to the movies I grew up with. As a live action/animation mix, this movie pales in comparison to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Who-Framed-Roger-Rabbit/dp/B00007AJGH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Who Framed Roger Rabbit </a>.

As other's have said, the voice over dubbing is horrendous (worse then your typical Godzilla film). That alone does not ruin the movie, but it certainly adds to its list of disappointments.

Wang Bao, played by Zhu Qi-Long, spends so much of his time daydreaming hero adventures that in real life he neglects his schoolwork. Spurned by his classmates for not pulling his weight on the group assignments, Wang Bao wishes that he could get the best grades without ever having to lift one finger.  Hu Lu, the magic gourd, overhears his wish and decides to serve the little boy. However, the gourd's enthusiasm and eagerness to grant the boy's every wish is matched by his little understanding of the human tendency to speak figuratively. And so as Hu Lu misunderstands the intention behind the words but still grants Wang Bao's wishes, the boy finds himself, instead, in trouble or embarrassed in front the very people he wants to impress. The irony is that the more Hu Lu tries to make things easier for his master, the more Wang Bao realizes that true satisfaction and respect comes from achievement and from working hard toward his goals

I watched this movie in Cantonese so that my mother would be able to enjoy it too while I followed the English subtitles.  Even with my limited knowledge of Cantonese, I could tell that the translation was not literal.  What I found funny was that Hu Lu is a character incapable of understanding figures of speech yet in the English subtitles he is uttering expressions such as ""What a cow!""  The English-dubbed version is all right but I'd rather watch this film with its original language track on.
As to the animation (by Hong Kong Centro Digital Pictures), it is not going to blow your mind away, but it is not cheap-looking either.  In fact, it is very good and provides a wondrous quality that younger kids will enjoy. Also, the special effects do not distract from the acting nor detract from the story.

""The Secret of the Magic Gourd"" is an enjoyable, family friendly film with a positive message on working hard towards what is important and on the values of friendship, teamwork and family.  Mostly, I like the fact that it is both Wang Bao and Hu Lu who do some growing up as they come to realize that having every wish being granted, as Hu Lu says, is not necessarily wise and may be more harmful than helpful in the end.",1237075200,3,2428,4.667447306791569

This is the first fully Chinese production, offered in English with English subtitles for the hearing impaired, a feature we always use to make sure we do not miss any of the dialogue.

The film combines animation with real live characters to bring forth the story of a kid who hates to work hard at studying or around his house and spends his time daydreaming adventures that take him flying into outer space. He hears the story his grandmother tells about a magic gourd that can grant all his wishes, from helping him with math scores, to fulfilling his every fantasy.

The magic gourd he fishes at a nearby lake accepts him as master and soon he starts to win at every thing he does and achieves much, but the end result is not what he expects and he longs for an ability to do by himself, which finally becomes reality through hard work and dedication.

In the end, the movie reveals that kids in China develop in an environment filled with hard work towards achieving the best education possible, exercising as they go to school in bikes, and dressing in uniforms that provide consistency and eliminate consumerism.

The lessons are many but our favorite was: ""if you are given everything you want, you become dependent on others and in order to achieve true success, we must learn to do by ourselves to become independent.""

When things start to go pretty haywire, he must figue out what is really important & how to turn things back around!

I liked this short, 85-minute film, but it was a bit jarring to start the movie & see that the soundtrack did not match up to what the characters lips were saying: it was only then that I looked closely at the back of the DVD & saw that this was an English soundtrack, to what is apparently a Chinese foreign film ~ recommended to people who are interested in a family-friendly (G rated), slightly 'different' fairy tale, that teaches life lessons, just like fairy tales usually do!",1236556800,,891,4.3293413173652695

Everyone in my family - my two daughters ages 11  and 3 , my husband, and me - enjoyed this film, each for different reasons.  The wee one was entranced by ""that cute little guy,"" meaning the Magic Gourd.  The 11  year old thought it was a little cheesy, but still liked it enough to watch all the way through with the rest of us.  My husband and I both felt it was a good film for a quiet family evening at home, but it just wasn't anything special.

In THE SECRET OF THE MAGIC GOURD, Raymond is an 11 year old boy who is not terribly motivated.  He lets his parents down, his teachers down, his friends down.  That is until he discovers the legendary MAGIC GOURD, which will grant his every wish.  Things go well at first, and Raymond impresses all of the people that were previously disappointed in him with his new-found prowess in, well, everything.  But eventually, people start getting hurt, and Raymond comes to realize that reward without hard work is a hollow victory.  In the end, both Raymond and the MAGIC GOURD learn the value of hard work and earning rewards on your own.

This film is Disney's first Chinese co-production, and THE SECRET OF THE MAGIC GOURD is a pleasant, cute film.  The problem is that it just isn't anything special.  While the combination of real-life and animation is very well done, and the message that hard work pays off in unexpected ways is an important one, the voice acting, including Corbin Bleu, is lackluster at best, and the dubbing is very out of synch.  There is no excuse for such disappointments in a Disney film.

Overall, THE SECRET OF THE MAGIC GOURD is a good choice for a quiet, fun family evening at home.  Younger kids will love it, parents won't hate it, and tweens and teens will tolerate it.  RECOMMENDED.",1236470400,,1838,4.465465465465465
3659608,2,B001JRB17Y,"The movie's message seemed to be that satisfaction can only be achieved from hard work.  Working hard should make you happy, because if things come too easily or without enough effort, this will lead to trouble.

 In theory, this sounds like a potentially good lesson for a movie, and I agree that there is satisfaction in working hard and achieving something.  However, the movie seemed to place more emphasis on moralizing than on telling an entertaining story.  It felt like a government message telling all viewers to be happy with their lot in life, so don't complain.

 I did a bit of research and learned that the story was written in the 1950s by Zhang Tianyi, an author assigned by the communist party to write children's literature.  So, the ""educational"" tone of the movie makes sense.  Other indicators linking the story to communist party ideals include:
  - the red scarves worn by the children (uniform of the Young Pioneers of China [Communist Youth League for younger children])
 - team grades in school, and mandated after school group study
 - The teacher explains that cheating is wrong because you don't want to let your *friends* down, rather than explaining that cheating deprives an individual of the opportunity to learn.

 The voice actors did a fine job with the dubbing, and the combining of live action and computer animation was well done.  Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to be a memorable movie.  Children will probably enjoy the talking gourd and comical frog sidekick, but parents may want to be aware that the story is a product of an official (communist) government writer rather than an ancient folk tale.",1236470400,2,1642,4.912727272727273

Although quite acceptable for the target market of primary school kids (my son has watched it twice in a row) it doesn't come close to being a Disney classic.

Recommended as a rental for a family evening if you have younger kids, or if you're young enough to know who Corbin Bleu is.*

3659610,3,B001JRB17Y,"The story of a lazy boy who wishes for everything to be done for him meeting up with a magic gourd who wants to use his power to its full capability and do everything for its master is a great foundation.
In the end they both learn the value of hard work and self accomplishment.

The Chinese social environment of teamwork, teaching by positive example, and family values also gives this movies a must see review by me.

However the English overdub was lackluster and poorly done. While not throughout the film, there are some attempts to Americanize the dialog that just seem out of place as they distract from the story.
(goldfish instead of koi, knight instead of horse, reference to food having no MSG, etc.)

Most of the animation was fantastic although the gourd looked more like flubber than a vegetable and the one scene with flying food looked like it was all plastic.

Had they spent a little more time in the studio and really tweaked the voice acting this could have been a box office hit. And with today's technology, there is really no reason they couldn't have reworked the gourd and had his English speaking match up with the voice.

Fortunately the movie has the Chinese voice track, I highly suggest you try that version. While still not as good sound fields as you find in US made movies The Secret of the Magic Gourd has an entirely different feel with the original actors doing the voices.

3659611,4,B001JRB17Y,"This is the story of a Chinese boy by the name of Raymond (a.k.a. Wang Bao) who has a creative imagination, but is chronically lazy and forgetful.  Ray has a hard time getting out of bed in the morning, and he stubbornly refuses to trim his toenails on a regular basis (which, of course, can eventually wreak havoc on one's socks and shoes).  The flaw that gets young Raymond into the most trouble, however, is his habitual failure to study for the rigorous math exams, administered daily by his demanding teacher, Miss Lee.  It seems that in China, students work in groups, so one slacker will negatively affect the whole team's grade.  Thus, Raymond's carelessness infuriates not only his instructor, but his classmates as well.  One fateful afternoon, a dejected Raymond flees the jeers of his peers and heads for the lake to do some fishing.  There he makes a wish, a wish to succeed in school and life without having to do any work or spend any time studying.  Enter Bailey (or Bao Hulu), a diminutive genie in the form of a Chinese bottle gourd.

Bailey seems like an odd name for a gourd (Gordon would be better), but this little fellow is no ordinary gourd.  Looking a bit like a dollop of soft-serve ice-cream, this anthropomorphic calabash has widely spaced button-like eyes on the upper half of his body, a hollow mouth in the middle of his belly, and no nose whatsoever.  He appears to be made of plastic, like a Mr. Potato Head toy, and his rubbery limbs stretch and expand like Mr. Fantastic's.  The Magic Gourd is also a shape-shifter, like the Shmoo, who can morph into anything from a speedboat engine to an alarm clock.  He can melt into a puddle or grow into a giant monster...he can even burst into flames at will, without being consumed in the inferno.  What's more, Bailey is an infinitely powerful sorcerer who can fly jet planes and make cheeseburgers and snack cakes materialize out of thin air.  He can build robots...calculate complex mathematical problems...and YES, he can clip toenails like nobody's business!  Can the gourd really free Raymond from life's day-to-day drudgeries...or will he only cause more trouble?

The Magic Gourd DVD boasts a beautifully clear and colorful widescreen transfer with Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  Bonus features consist of Bailey's computer-animated bloopers; a DVD game; a behind-the-scenes featurette; and a music video of the Chinese version of the movie's theme song.  In addition to the English dub, the Mandarin and Cantonese vocal tracks are included, but the only subtitle choice available for them is the closed captioning of the English version.  Since Bailey the Gourd is trying to do for nail care what Smokey the Bear did for forest fire prevention, it would have been nice if Disney had included a free pair of clippers in the DVD case.  Well, maybe they're saving that for the platinum edition.

The tale of the Magic Gourd is apparently a well known story in China, but Americans will probably find the whole concept of a gourd-shaped wizard to be kind of bizarre.  The folks at Disney have tried to Americanize this production by casting High School Musical's Corbin Bleu, changing all the Chinese names and having the characters say the word ""awesome"" a lot...but I doubt that the Magic Gourd will become the next Hannah Montana.  Nevertheless, this is a pretty entertaining family film with a positive message.",1236211200,4,3400,4.844290657439446
3659612,4,B001JRB17Y,"Disney has put out some really nice movies in recent years that appeal to a wide audience from Pirates of the Caribbean to it's Pixar films like Wall-E and Monsters Inc.  Best part about such films are their wide appeal to all audiences and not just the traditional child audience.  Films like Toy Story and Miracle dazzled children while adults could sit back and enjoy a film that was made for them too.

Enter ""The Secret of the Magic Gourd.""

""Magic Gourd"" goes against this tradition in an effort to appeal to children more than adults.  In fact, there was only an instance or two I actually genuinely laughed and it pertained more to the culture clash between Chinese and American culture.  I say this because the entire film is made in China with English subtitles or dub.  Being a hardcore fan of Michael Phelps and everything else US Olympics related I guess I kinda possess a healthy sense of rivalry between my country and China.  That said, it is very hard for me to take the film seriously but more on that later.

The premise of the film is very simple.  The protagonist, Raymond, is a very, very, VERY lazy 11-year old that has grandiose dreams and a wild imagination.  While fishing he finds a magical gourd that makes all wishes come true.  Sounds grand right?  Not really, but you'll have to get the film to hear the rest.  The basic moral of the story is that hard work and self-advocacy is more rewarding and fulfilling than having someone do it for you.  It is something I wish more of my countrymen would understand but that's a different debate for a different review (if any).

Now, I absolutely loved the landscape filmed.  As an outdoorsman, I found the bamboo woods absolutely breathtaking.  The lake was particularly nice and I can only imagine the kind of fishing they have there.  The computer graphic visuals weren't bad although they were more convincing than what the Chinese did during opening ceremony last summer.  The gourd, which looked more like a piece of... never mind, interacted fairly well with the live action characters and even the environment.

Now onto my own personal beefs.

First and foremost, this is a movie for children with little consideration for adults.  As a 25-year old male with a love for movies like Red Dawn and Death Wish, this film had very little appeal to me.  Now, before you ask ""Then why did you get it in the first place,"" remember that Disney has spent the last decade and a half trying to appeal to all audiences including adults.  Because of this, you almost get a false sense of marketing from Disney.

However, the child appeal will prevail with anyone under the age of 13.  I would recommend this to anyone to parents but don't expect a laugh when you see it.",1236211200,3,2738,4.603305785123967
3659613,2,B001JRB17Y,"This movie was filmed in China (where children may be familiar with a tale of a magical wish granting gourd) with an all Chinese cast.  it was dubbed into English.  The boy playing the lead, ""Raymond"" is cute and very expressive.  He's about all that saves the film from being a complete waste of time.

The basic story is that Raymond daydreams and avoids doing his school work, then finds the magical talking gourd, which calls him ""master"" and agrees to do his every bidding. This sounds great to Raymond at first, but then things start going wrong.  The gourd misinterprets his wishes and Raymond gets into all kinds of scrapes.  The final lesson is that you can't be proud of honors that you don't earn through your own effort.

I asked my kids what they thought of this film.  My eight year old said it was ""freaky"" and she left halfway through, completely bored.  My four year old enjoyed it though, and thought the talking gourd was hilarious.

I appreciate the fact that there was nothing too scary or gross in this movie, but the fatc that it is not offensive is pretty weak praise.",1236038400,2,1092,4.525510204081633

""The Secret of the Magic Gourd"" is interesting in that it was the first partially CG film that Disney produced for the Chinese mainland market.  The story is about a boy who finds a magical talking gourd that grants all of the boy's wishes.  Unfortunately the gourd can't differentiate between casual wants and real desires, and trouble often ensues.

The movie is a decent morality tale for young kids.  It teaches the value of hard work and struggle in order to make results seem more worthwhile.

The English dub is fairly dreadful, so I recommend watching the movie in the original Mandarin with subtitles.  It's a harmless enough film, but I don't think I'd ever spend my time ever watching it again.  Young kids may enjoy it far more than I did.",1235952000,,1026,4.380952380952381
3659615,4,B001JRB17Y,"This is a movie by Walt Disney but is a bit different from the proverbial film that Disney produces.  This is mainly due to the fact that this movie was released by the Chinese film company Centro in 2007 and then just recently released here in the United States by Walt Disney (in partnership with Centro) in 2009.

This movie is about a young boy named Raymond.  Raymond struggles with being a perfect person.  These grapples with perfection mainly gravitate towards school achievements and making his family proud of him. One day Raymond is fishing and isn't having any luck catching fish.  He wishes he could catch some fish and this is when he meets Bailey the magic gourd.  When Bailey introduces himself to Raymond and tells him who he is, Raymond doesn't believe him.  Raymond has heard the myth of the magic gourd growing up from his grandmother and believes it is hogwash.  A magic gourd is basically an enchanting creature that is able to make a wish come true.

Now Bailey tells Raymond to give him a chance to prove that he is in fact the magic gourd.  After a dramatic exercise of Bailey's abilities, Raymond is now a believer and wants this magic gourds help.  However as the movie progresses, Raymond discovers that his wishes come with unexpected consequences.  For instance, Raymond wants to pass his math test.  So Bailey copies another student's test and puts the answers on Raymond's paper, which makes it appear that Raymond was cheating.  Some of these situations lead to both heartwarming and funny situations.

This movie is saturated with CGI (computer generated/graphic images) which would normally bother me, but in this case it just added a surreal element to the film.  I also feel this movie has a great moral, which is honesty; hard work, working together and respect go a long way.  These are great messages for children (and some adults).  The movie doesn't have any bad language and there is some action/violence.  This action/violence that is very minor and so over the top that it (hopefully) will be more exciting than scary.

As formerly noted, this was a Chinese movie and was released later in the United States.  This means that the movie is dubbed in English.  I find that most movies that are dubbed can be somewhat difficult to watch and/or taken seriously.  In contrast, I adjusted to this dubbing quickly in this film and it really didn't bother me.  Bailey is a computer generated image so his voice dubbing wasn't a problem at all.  All the voice acting was pretty good.  Corbin Bleu (High School Musical series) provides Bailey's voice and he does a pretty good job.

The DVD provides a bunch of features and previews for other Disney movies about to be released and/or re-released on DVD. I found this movie to be enjoyable and I am an adult.  I am sure children would also like this film.  Since this movie wasn't made in America, it has a different flavor, this is a good thing.  Not only will this movie provide entertainment, it will provide children an insight to some Chinese culture.

As for the magic gourd Bailey, I found him to be a cute and funny character that happens to look just like a butternut squash!",1235952000,,3169,4.696914700544465
3659616,5,B001JRB17Y,"""The Secret of the Magic Gourd"" is the first collaboration between Walt Disney studios and two prominent Chinese studios, China Film Group and Centro Pictures entertainment.  This film is dubbed in English and has the voice talents of Corbin Bleu from the ""High School Musical"" films. It tells the tale of a good but lazy boy who goes fishing and catches a magic gourd who grants him every wish that he wants.  The gourd is old, wise, but extremely impulsive and grants every wish that Raymond (the main character) asks for with unintentionally hilarious and upsetting results some of the time.  The main theme of the movie, which was based on a best selling kids fantasy book in China, is that a person must earn rewards and praise on their own, and not with anyone else's help.  This is a very good message for kids, because especially nowadays parents unintentionally enable their children to do better when their children should be doing the work themselves.  The special effects are wonderful, the story is easy to follow, it is very family friendly and it is yet another great Disney movie.

 My kids loved this movie, and were very excited when it came out of the package it was shipped in.  I asked them to help me review it, and the following are some things that I wrote down from what they said in their ""review"":

 Kyle, age 5: ""I really liked it. My favorite character was the gourd.""

 Erik, age 7: ""I liked it but I don't know why."" When I asked this son as to what his favorite character was, and his favorite scene in the movie, he said: ""I don't know."" (At Erik's age I get this response a lot).

 The special features on this DVD include Bloopers, a behind the scenes documentary, one game ""Too Many Toys"" and a music video that is a tie in to the movie in chinese.  The Bloopers are worth the price of the movie alone, except that there are not enough of them.  But that is a very small complaint.  This is a great movie that is a welcome addition to any family movie collection.",1235952000,,1999,4.462809917355372
3659617,4,B001JRB17Y,"This film is a lot of fun. Kids will enjoy it even though adults may not. The story telling is a little different from American style (Asian films usually are), but the earnestness of the actors shines through. The kid was great. His performance was enjoyable. Corbin Bleu's voice over was fantastic. He made the character of Bailey the Gourd very likeable even when Bailey's magic caused more problems than it solved. I was hoping for a song by Bleu but, alas, there is none. The made up bloopers are very funny. The documentary at the end is good for about 10 minutes before it gets boring. The music video doesn't have English subtitles.",1233360000,5,640,4.62280701754386

8313640,4,B001JRB17Y,"I find it interesting to watch movies made by foreign directors (even, though this one is Disney).  They sometimes have a twist or some aspect that is different - often a more overtly moral message.  The movie itself was fine and the kids watched but weren't riveted.",1489795200,,267,4.659574468085107
