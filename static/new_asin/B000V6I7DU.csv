2931008,4,B000V6I7DU,"I wrote a similar review about Volume 2.  What they have done with these videos is taken them from TV shows, where viewers are presumably supposed to keep doing the exercises while commercials are playing.  The producers have not re-edited the DVD's for home use.  It's therefore common to have missing portions of the exercises (missing biceps in one case, only one leg done in another, one that completely misses out on any stretching, and so on).  If you have the patience to rewind the DVD or stop it to complete the full exercises (or don't care if you skip some parts) then maybe this won't bother you.

The other thing I find annoying is that the producers spend about a minute at the beginning of each 23.5 minute video playing the intro to the TV show, and I can't seem to skip past that quickly to get right to the exercises.  When you're doing a couple of the segments at a time, it sure seems to be a waste of time, particularly given that they play the theme religiously, but skip actual exercises that someone at home would want to do.

That much being said, the exercises themselves are terrific and very time-effective, and I'm a big Gilad fan.  I will use these when I'm pressed for time, but for a full workout I'll likely stick with the Ultimate Body Sculpt and Quickfit DVDs.",1199923200,51,1295,4.480851063829787

2931010,3,B000V6I7DU,"I love the exercises, but the quality of the DVD is really bad, you see exercises of the right leg (16 repetitions)  but only (6 repetitions) of the left leg , this  uneven way to show the exercises occurs two or three time during each session . I bought three DVDs for a total of nine workouts and the same situation is repeated again and again, is very annoying.",1196553600,27,364,4.260869565217392

2931050,5,B000V6I7DU,ANY DVD by Gilad is fantastic.  this is just like the show that was on FitTV.,1414713600,,77,3.8125
2931061,5,B000V6I7DU,Great workout.  I highly recommend Gilad.,1409184000,,41,5.833333333333333
2931062,5,B000V6I7DU,"Great work out and I was pleasantly surprised to sea how much I like the combination of aerobic, pilates, weights and Yoga! Previously, I had never really gotten into Yoga but now I love it.  He also has enough variations that you don't get boredand he's kind of funny too! I know he has other DVD's as well but I am most familiar with his Total Body Sculpt DVD's and would recommend them.",1392336000,,389,4.328767123287672
2931063,5,B000V6I7DU,"These are amazing, effective, short work outs. Each workout is about 20 minutes long, but your entire body gets worked. Love them!",1386115200,,130,4.954545454545454
2931064,4,B000V6I7DU,i love this dvd. he works every major muscle group and the you get a good burn with his workouts.,1380931200,,97,3.9
2931065,2,B000V6I7DU,"gilad is a joke. he didn't do these workouts getting his body sculped. BS. but, this isn't the shippers fault",1379894400,,109,4.5

2931067,5,B000V6I7DU,"I started using this CD about three years ago and often rotate with Gilad's other exercise CD's. Core and more is my favorite, but pretty tough. I like these exercises better for weekdays, especially in the morning. They work all your muscles in as little as 20 some minutes. You'll build strength and endurance over time and it never gets boring.",1373760000,,347,4.704918032786885
2931068,5,B000V6I7DU,"Watched Gilad's television show when I was in Japan.  His show is on Diamond Head in Hawaii. Gilad's workout is complete and doesn't require a lot of stuff to do it.  More sustained muscle control, less hype.",1368057600,,208,4.594594594594595
2931069,5,B000V6I7DU,"This is great for beginners.  It is simple enough to follow and the routines are fun.  Once you get comfortable with this routine you might want to get his ""Total Body Sculpt Plus.""",1360281600,,181,4.454545454545454
2931070,2,B000V6I7DU,"I had been exercising with Gilad for long time may be 15 years. I know and liked his style a lot. But I am dissappointed that he cut his work out in this DVD. This work out is not complete. It does not include all the motions he normally does in his routines. It is very short and incomplete. I wish I did not bought this DVD. I bought his DVD s because they closed FIT TV. We can not watch him from TV any more. Bad luck!
Sorry Gilad.",1349827200,4,435,3.8444444444444446
2931080,5,B000V6I7DU,I am training with Gilad for the last 17 years and he is the one and only one that I will workout with. I started with this and I look and feel very good :),1338163200,,156,3.4857142857142858
2931081,5,B000V6I7DU,I did Gilad on FitTv for years.  It was suddenly and without warning discontinued and FitTv changed to Discovery Fit and Health.  A very sucky thing to do.  Anyway this tape is the exact same show I exerciesed to.  This tape filled the void left by the FitTv.,1306886400,,259,4.333333333333333
2931082,5,B000V6I7DU,One of the best short Gilad's work out for Intermediate level. But some parts are cut out for commercials as on TV.,1299628800,,115,4.2727272727272725
2931083,4,B000V6I7DU,"This DVD is 3 of Gilad's workouts as seen on Fit TV.  He has selected 9 to record and sell, so there are 3 DVDs.  They are sold individually, and this is the first.  The commercials are cut out, which is nice:  you can do the workouts without having to wait for them.  However, sometimes Gilad is cut off before he seems to be quite finished with a set.  There seems to be just a bit more of this than on tv.  Also, it is too bad that more of these were not made:  there were at least 30 episodes made of this show.  Anyway, you get Gilad here, and if you like him on tv, then this DVD is just what you want.",1295395200,4,608,3.838709677419355
2931084,5,B000V6I7DU,"these exercise videos are just what I needed they are short workouts for the busy person just enough time to get the metabolism going . the only con is that they are from a tv show and there is a break where a commercial would of been and sometimes you don't finish the exercise so just keep the pause button handy and get a great workout I bought 1,2 and 3 I use these videos regularly",1272412800,,386,4.092105263157895

2931086,5,B000V6I7DU,"I have been working out with Gilad on fit tv so I was already familiar with these short but sweet exercises. They are very effective and I feel the burn even after I am done. Gilad has been doing this for years, so you really are in good hands with anything that he does. I have been going to the gym regularly for several years, however, these workouts have helped me push past a plateau. I feel my body getting tighter with each workout. They are just perfect for me after a morning run. I am seriously considering canceling my gym membership!",1216166400,9,545,4.352941176470588
2931087,4,B000V6I7DU,I am a pilot and basically live in hotel rooms. This dvd is great because I can take my workout with me. I just place it in my laptop and have a good 25 min. workout every day. I like these workouts becuase they get my heart going without getting too extreme. The workouts can be done with simple weights (I use a tension strap as I can take it with me). I have experienced great results in the 4 weeks I have been using the dvd.,1204761600,6,429,3.942528735632184
2931088,5,B000V6I7DU,"I absolutely LOVE Gilad and everything he does as his workouts are fun, invigorating, and extremely effective.  I feel the burn every time I work out with him and it 'hurts so good'.  If you want to sweat and instantly feel and see what you're doing is working, then I highly suggest this DVD and every other DVD that Gilad has out there.",1200009600,,338,4.349206349206349
