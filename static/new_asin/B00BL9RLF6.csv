8570296,5,B00BL9RLF6,"Watching ""Massage Parlor Murders"" made me feel like I was watching an old 70's stag film of some
kind. Sleazy entertainment featuring murder and topless/bottomless babes. The film isn't overly gory or masochistic, at least I find it to be. I Don't want to give too much away, but the film is just what the title says. That's all you need to know. The video and audio quality of the DVD/Blu-ray are top notch. Excellent. Vinegar Syndrome is quickly becoming my favorite home video releaser. I would recommend this movie to collectors of vintage horror and/or exploitation films or B-Movie fans in general. I had a good time watching it and will again. 5-Stars. Check it out!",1367539200,8,673,4.760683760683761
8570297,4,B00BL9RLF6,"I applaud Vinegar Syndrome for releasing films that no one else would touch and I also appreciate that most of them are 70's explotation and sexploitation films. It's like I'm reliving my teenage years all over again. They take the utmost care in the films' restorations and always show the films in their actual theatrical ratio. They may be the new kid on the block, but they are a welcome addition to old fogies like me!",1367107200,2,423,4.578947368421052
8570298,4,B00BL9RLF6,"Vinegar Syndrome's release of Massage Parlor Murders will remain one of the more respected exploitation releases for years to come. What you have here is a high quality Blu-ray/DVD release of bargain basement 42nd St. fun. Massage Parlor Murders is a movie that lives up to its title; pretty girls, lots of nudity, a killer with creepy motives (think Se7en), bad dialogue, awesome location shots (check out those movie marquees), even more bad dialogue, genuine 60s/70s fashions, a sub-par car chase and of course gruesomely murdered hookers...oh I'm sorry, massage engineers. The gore effects are fairly tame and cheap but the brutality behind them is oddly effective. Many reviewers have been rough on the opening scene presented in the slightly longer ""original cut"" (found on both discs) but I think it's hilarious. The dialogue and acting is completely absurd. The whole film should be made in to a play.

Great image quality. Very colorful for such a feature. Those of you cranking this feature through a high end system may get irritated with the lackluster and somewhat noisy soundtrack. Its not a problem of the disc just issues inherent in the original tracks. Bonus features include outtakes, trailers, a radio spot and some welcome liner notes by Chris Poggiali (he knows his stuff).  The outtakes are worth it just for the the location shots. There appears to be a problem with the radio spot on the Blu-ray disc (I checked two discs and neither had sound) but it plays fine on the DVD. Completing the package and adding an unusual touch of class is Jay Shaw's fantastic poster art, which is exclusive to this release. For a limited time you can get a high quality print of the poster on the Vinegar Syndrome website. Expect to pay a lot more for it when they sell out.",1366329600,,1782,4.8202614379084965
8570299,5,B00BL9RLF6,"I suppose the best way to describe this movie, would be as some sort of Grindhouse version of `The French Connection'. Not only is there a strong emphasis on the whole cop business and do we get treated to an extended car chase, both movies share the same kind of loose script structure. In typical seventies fashion, instead of a tightly written scenario based on cause and effect, `Massage Parlor Murders' offers almost random vignettes creating a wonderfully sprawling epic that clocks in at just under 80 minutes. In doing so, it has created a wonderful time capsule, which captures that seventies sensibility so well, with those instantly recognizable colors, the great music (which seems a cross between early Funkadelic and the Miles Davis of the period) and of course that truly awful and ubiquitous wallpaper. With a title like `Massage Parlor Murders!' you'd probably expect a straight horror movie, but probably the exclamation mark (which is there on the title card) should give you a clue this is going to be something entirely else. So besides the wonderful sleaziness of it all, the movie is played more for comedy than horror, with some truly hilarious moments though there are some gore sequences as well. In the end, what's most beautiful about this picture is its total refusal to be categorized and its willingness to go anywhere it pleases; what it may lack in coherence, it more than makes up for with poetic logic.

For only their second blu-ray release, Vinegar Syndrome couldn't have picked a better title than `Massage Parlor Murders'. They not only rescued this gem from obscurity, somehow they've managed to make it look like a million bucks too. When I saw the trailer for this release, I was very much surprised at how good it looked, and fortunately this doesn't limit itself to just the trailer. Sure, there is the occasional odd frame and the soundtrack isn't always pitch-perfect, but this is one scrumptious looking blu-ray. Vinegar Syndrome is a new player in town (their Expectations/Confessions double bill is already one of my favorite releases of the year) and everyone who considers himself a exploitation genre nut owes it to himself to check out their releases and this one is a good a place to start as any.",1365292800,16,2251,4.892670157068062
8570300,5,B00BL9RLF6,"MASSAGE PARLOR MURDERS has been all but buried since the 1970s, languishing in a vault somewhere.  Fortunately, Vinegar Syndrome is the Tomb Raider of video labels.  They have painstakingly tweaked and tweezed every molecule of the original camera negative to its original vibrancy.  In fact, you may opt to watch the DVD in this combo-pack; the Blu-ray is almost TOO crystal clear.

MASSAGE PARLOR MURDERS has no CGI, explosions, or ex-Disney bimbos.  So what do you get?  A pursuit featuring half a dozen or more $300 cars crashing into each other.  Luscious, REAL 70s honies in their finest eyeshadow.  Countless minutes of Sandra (LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT) Peabody wandering around NYC with her cop boyfriend.  Lots of dead massage parlor girls who have trouble not blinking while the camera is rolling.  Brother Theodore in freak-out mode.  A music editor with ADHD.  And above all, an ending that redefines the word ""overkill.""  I had very high expectations for this film.  While it did not deliver exactly what I had imagined, it surprised and pleased me well beyond what I dared hope.",1364774400,12,1090,4.9502762430939224
