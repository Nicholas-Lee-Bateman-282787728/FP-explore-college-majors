4168147,4,B003QF1N7K,"Walt Disney's True-Life Adventure series began with Seal Island, one of many ideas he had that seemed crazy at the time -- a genre of film in which massive amounts of nature footage was edited to tell a story. The series was a long running success, leading to an endless parade of shorts, features and, more than anything else, TV shows featuring animals.

There were also some controversies. Some animal specialists and other critics were not pleased with how these films created an ""anthropomorphosis"" for the animals, attributing to them thoughts and motivations created through the editing and narration rather than real life events. You know, like reality TV (so does that make Snooki the new Perri?)

However, that was part of the entertainment value of the films, and what made them so memorable. It's to the credit of those who create films either produced or released by Disneynature to acheive a similar quality with a keener eye for nonfiction.

They also have an advantage early nature documentarists never dreamed of -- high-definition photography and fascinating gadgets like remote helicopter-like cameras and deep-sea devices.

These developments and more are put to extremely effective use in Oceans, which offers spectacular footage never before put on film.

In place of the paternal Winston Hibler or the folksy Rex Allen, who did so much of the early Disney nature film narrations, Oceans is told with a combination of awe and matter-of-fact assertion by Pierce Brosnan. Listening to him narrate, I couldn't help wondering how many other commercials and films I had heard with his voice, but not realizing it.

Oceans is a dynamic, but fairly straightforward tour through the seas, showcasing the familiar, the strange and of course, the endangered (Disney Channel pop stars Demi Lovato and Joe Jonas add their ""Friends for Change"" note with a song over the end credits that is also a music video).

The bonus features examine the filmmaking techniques and also promote the Disney Corporate environmental initiatives, which might seem a bit self-serving to some but is a largely sincere and highly accomplished effort by those involved who are seriously dedicated to these issues. Disney's a big company and it's a business, but it also brings these issues into the mainstream and allows costly research to take place. And it gets films like this into the mainstream, too.",1287705600,4,2393,5.1048593350383635
4168148,4,B003QF1N7K,"In 2001, Jacques Perrin and Jacques Cluzaud were known for their wonderful work in the film ""Winged Migration"".  Whereas the filmmakers focused on the geese in the air, the two filmmakers now focus on the ocean with their French nature documentary ""Oceans"" filmed in HD and distributed in theaters by DisneyNature.

The film which was budgeted at $66 million debuted in US theaters on Earth Day (April 22, 2010) and earned over $76 million in the worldwide box office.

The film would take four years to film and was filmed in over 50 different locations.  The filmmakers took their time in making sure they could get the shots they wanted of ocean life but also to show how human activity has taken its toll on sea life especially with pollution extending from the rivers to the deep.

Featuring stunning cinematography and new hardware cinematic uses for capturing underwater sea life and creatures is fantastic and giving viewers a rare glimpse and close up of the animals underwater.

And now the wonderful documentary ""Oceans"" will be released alongside DisneyNature's ""The Crimson Wing: Mystery of the Flamingos"" on October 19th on Blu-ray and DVD.

VIDEO:

""Oceans"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 aspect ratio).  The fact that this film was shot in HD is amazing especially how the film looks on Blu-ray.  But what I enjoyed about ""Oceans"" is just the incredible shots that the crew were able to capture.  In the past, there was no way this footage would ever be captured, such as the animals around the coral reef because any slight movement or an appearance by a human would scare them and no animal would appear.  But in this case, the filmmakers were able to use high technology to capture these miniature animals and also capture footage of various sea animals from all over the planet.

We can see the detail among the surface of the lizard underwater, the clarity of the ribbon fish, the jellyfish, the turtoises, even close ups with a manatee, a great white shark, a variety of whales and more.  It's in this film with such clarity but also the amazing scenery of how the cycle of feeding looks on camera.  From the dolphins and birds feeding on the sardines and the birds dropping all at once towards the ocean, a great white shark or a killer whale feeding on seal lions or what happens when the baby turtles are seen swimming to the ocean to avoid being eaten by birds and how very few survive.  It's all captured in this film.

""Oceans"" comes alive in HD.  Detail of the various sea animals are featured with so much detail more than any oceanic documentary that I have seen.  The amazing closeups that the filmmakers were able to capture was wonderful.  ""Oceans"" is definitely a feast for the eyes if you appreciate watching nature-based films, especially oceanic cinematography.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Oceans"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit) and French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  It's not just the picture quality of this film that is amazing, there is good use of sound and it's one thing for the filmmakers to capture closeups of the animals via new technology via the cameras used for this film but the sound that was captured was amazing.  You can hear the dolphins communicating, the birds hitting the water to grab the fish, the turtles breathing.  The sounds captured on this film were quite incredible and combined with the musical score by Bruno Coulais, the lossless audio is awesome.

Narration by Pierce Brosnan was clear through the center channels, the ocean and animal ambiance coming from the front and surround channels was very well done as well.

Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""Oceans"" features the following special features in 1080p High definition (2:40:1) with English, English SDH and Spanish subtitles:

  * Living Planet - An interactive feature on the main menu which features a globe in which you can select destinations with your remote. Click on the various areas in several continents to learn real-time information of what is going on at several wildlife areas and also learn details about the film. You get the current date, time and temperature on the bottom right corner as well.
  * Filmmaker Annotations - While watching ""Oceans"", you get a picture-and-picture video with the filmmakers, DisneyNature staff discussing aspects of filming in the ocean and things they saw. You also get text annotations on the bottom of the screen.
  * Disney and Nature: Caring for the World We Share - (7:55) A featurette on how Disney takes part in protect nature and the planet.  From the earlier years with Walt Disney and the original series ""Disney's True-Life Adventure"" to today's DisneyNature and Disney's Worldwide Conversation Fund, Disney is involved with research and protecting the planet.  For example, how Disney donates proceeds to planting trees per dollar in the Atlantic Forest in Brazil and protection of coral reefs.
  * Make a Wave - (1:50) A Disney friends for change music video featuring Joe Jonas and Demi Lovato.
  * deeper in the ocean - The following are videos from the Blu-ray's ""Living Menus"" and ""Filmmaker Annotations"" but are kept separate on the accompanying DVD.  This feature has five making-of mini-featurettes: The importance of the ocean (2:48) - discussion of how important the ocean is for human survival; the sardine run  (2:39) - how the incredible scene of the birds swooping in for the sardines was filmed;activity in the coral reefs (:48) - the significance of the coral reefs and the activity on the reef; ""jonas"": the torpedo camera (2:27) - Using a torpedo camera to film the animals and the challenges of using that camera; and swimming with great white sharks (1:48) - How the filmmakers shot the amazing scene with the great white shark.

EXTRAS:

""Oceans"" comes with a DVD version of the feature film which is presented in 2:40:1, widescreen. Audio in English, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound and subtitles in English, English SDH, French and Spanish. Also, included is a slipover cover case.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Impressive!  I was very amazed by this film and I have watched a good number of ocean-based documentaries in my lifetime.

I think what really makes ""Oceans"" stand out is that it was shot in HD and there is just footage of ocean life that people may have not seen, let alone this personal and closeup.  You can watch the film but watch it again with the filmmaker annotations to see how the film was captured and the amount of technology that was used to film these animals and also how they were so patient within the four years to capture a scene, and making sure each scene captured was nothing alike any other scene throughout the film.

Probably one of most impressive shots was the use of the torpedo camera because the fish were not running away from it and looked at the device as one of their own and thus, the camera was able to pick up amazing scenes underwater.  The filmmakers did talk about how difficult it was to use this camera but just looking at the type of shots they were able to get, you can't help but be impressed.

Jacques Perrin and Jacques Cluzaud did amazing work with their previous film ""Winged Migration"" but what they were able to accomplish with ""Oceans"" was breathtaking and almost unbelievable.  The cinematography is awesome but also  the number of sea life, deep water creatures and to see them with such clarity is fantastic.

Of course, we also see how humanity has affected the oceans.  A satellite screen shows how much pollution is being pumped from the rivers to the oceans and how it has led to various paths that can be picked up by satellite and also footage of the creatures underwater swimming around polluted waters.  In one scene, we watch a seal that discovers a shopping cart underwater.

The film also shows how deep sea fishing has nearly made the blue fin tuna nearly extinct but within the process of capturing the fish, they have also captured other precious underwater creatures as well.  I'm quite impressed to see how the filmmakers were actually able to film the animals struggling to get out of the nets and being trapped in the nets while trying to escape and then above, we see fishermen killing the animals (this is not shown but we see perspective underwater near the nets).

As for the Blu-ray release, so far the DisneyNature Blu-ray releases have been top-notch and the fact that they have gone HD with their filmmaking is important.  So, far their last two previous films (""Earth"" and ""The Crimson Wing: The Mystery of the Flamingos"") have looked absolutely awesome on Blu-ray and ""Oceans"" looks even better.  You get a good amount of special features and also an accompanying DVD as well.

The documentary and so far every DisneyNature release are safe to watch and although we do see the cycle of how whales and sharks prey on young sea lions or birds eating small turtles, this is part of the cycle of nature and the filmmakers made sure there was nothing too gruesome in the film.  If anything, the film is quite useful in showcasing underwater sea life but also how human activity is affecting the oceans and also how pollution and poisons sent to the ocean can easily kill the underwater sea life and something must be done to stop it.

Overall, ""Oceans"" is a fantastic film from DisneyNature and if you are a fan of nature-based documentary/films, ""Oceans"" is one of the best underwater documentaries out there, if not the best that I have seen and heard thus far.  Very impressive in HD and is highly recommended!",1287619200,,9617,4.809002433090025
4168149,5,B003QF1N7K,"I seen the music video Make a wave, with Demi Lovato and Joe Jonas.  It was amazing about the ocean and seen a lot of aquatic animals that we never see.  You know, if anybody ever saw this movie and so does the EPA, they can do whatever they can prevent future oil spills or chemical spills that won't hurt the ocean and the animals.  This movie, can help everybody get involved protecting the ocean from future hazardus spills.",1286928000,2,428,4.3924050632911396
4168150,5,B003QF1N7K,"I saw this movie with my two grandsons and can not wait for its release in October. I'm pre-ordering it now so I'll have it as soon as it becomes available. The cinematography is indeed fantastic and there is no need to rate it any lower because of the narration. This is a must have in your collection! When my son-in-law inquired if his 4 and 6 year olds thanked Papa for taking them to the movie, the six year old immediately replied ""thanks Papa"". After a short time, and following another request from the father, the four year old replied, ""I'm NOT thanking him for making me watch a great white eat a seal!"" There are a few graphic scenes but they are REAL - big fish do indeed eat little fish.",1282953600,27,701,4.2781954887218046
4168151,2,B003QF1N7K,"Oceans is filled with some amazing pictures, from a lone scuba diver swimming alongside a shark that's 10 times his size to a series of close-ups of sea creatures that look more like something from a cheap Hollywood horror movie than something actually found in nature. Sadly, most of what's shown in the movie won't be new to the audience, particularly if you've seen any of the plethora of nature movies and television specials that have been released over the past few years (a cuttlefish is a cuttlefish is a cuttlefish), but it's still beautifully photographed and looks great on the big screen.

While it's lovely to look at, however, Oceans is more than a little tedious to sit through.

[...]",1278201600,7,700,4.776859504132231
4168152,2,B003QF1N7K,"I saw this in the theaters soon after it came out. After seeing ""Earth"" and the wonderful trailer for ""Oceans,"" I was really looking forward to it. It was kind of disappointing.

There's the expected wonderful cinematography, and if that's all you're looking for, this movie will not disappoint. In particular, there's one amazing sequence featuring dolphins, sardines, seagulls, sharks, and whales. That was incredible, and well worth seeing.

However, I spent most of the rest of the movie being very irritated with the narration. It was not only uninformative, but confusing and disjointed as well. Over and over and over again, the narrator would make half a point, and then move on to something completely different. For example, there's one little sequence where he's talking about animals depending on one another. We see a fish hiding in an anemone's tentacles. He says, ""Immune to the sea anemone's paralyzing tentacles, a clamfish hides..."" and then he moves on to something completely different without bothering to mention what the anemone gets out of the deal. He did this all through the movie! The end result was disjointed and distracting.

Plus, ""Earth"" had about four big stories with about 500 little complete stories in between. ""Oceans"" has no story. It has about 500 POTENTIAL stories, but since the narrator always just tells us half the story before moving on to something else, and almost never answers the question, ""why?,"" it's just frustration, over and over again.",1273622400,15,1493,5.110655737704918
4168153,4,B003QF1N7K,"On this Earth Day, let us reflect that, while environmental improvements have been made, more work needs to be done. Three scenes late in Disneynature's ""Oceans"" demonstrate this with chilling sincerity. The first shows a number of hapless exotic sea creatures struggling to free themselves from the snare of gigantic fishing nets. They were not meant to get caught - the blue tuna were, a species endangered due to overfishing. The second scene is comprised of satellite imagery, which to the naked eye reveals nothing out of the ordinary. But with the help of scanning technologies, we're able to see black tendrils of pollution flowing out to sea from populated coastlines. The third shows an island of trash, mostly plastics, floating listlessly in the water. A sunken shopping cart seems to genuinely confuse a nearby sea lion, and it might even have affected its ability to survive.

One of this movie's strengths is that it doesn't gloss over these unpleasant details, nor does it spare the audience of unfortunate realities - where there are sea lions, there are also hungry sharks and orcas, and where there are newborn sea turtles, there are also dive-bombing birds. At the same time, it doesn't bombard you with them; if anything, it's a celebration of sea life, a reminder that, in spite of humanity's interference, life does indeed go on.

It's above all a magnificently written and beautifully photographed expose of ocean life. This is the second Disneynature documentary, the first being last year's ""Earth,"" the reedited and redubbed version of the BBC and Discovery Channel miniseries ""Planet Earth."" Despite its breathtaking imagery and entertaining narration, it felt terribly condensed, and the plight of the various animal families seemed manufactured, almost like ... well, almost like a Disney film. ""Oceans"" wisely avoids this issue by not applying human traits to the animals; this time around, they're not characters in a story so much as subjects being observed. If the filmmakers were to spend all their time following two or three animal groups over a given period of time, the movie would fail to show just how immensely diverse marine life truly is.

Over the course of four years, directors Jacques Perrin and Jacques Cluzaud captured footage from over fifty locations, revealing all manner of aquatic creatures both above and below the ocean surface. Some are gruff and ugly, like the rockfish. Some are surprisingly beautiful, like the blanket octopus, whose long, flowing tentacles give the appearance of a scarf lost in a current. Some are adorable, like the otters that freely float on their backs in the open waters off Monterey Bay. Some are bizarre, like the dragonfish, which can only survive in the waters of the China Sea. Some are naturally acrobatic, like the school of sardines able to form perfect cones and spheres. Some are frightening, like spider crabs that attack one another in multitudes so vast, we cannot see the ocean floor when the camera pulls up for a wide shot.

The film is narrated by Pierce Brosnan, who sounds not like a stuffy nature show host but like a man telling a story he genuinely finds fascinating. His voice has an appealing warmth to it, a soothing and clam quality that seems to be saying, ""It's all right - that's what we call the circle of life."" Indeed, it isn't easy watching a shark make a meal out of a sea lion. It is, however, amusing to watch sea lions sunbathing lazily on the beach, getting comfortable with seemingly no effort at all. It's also heartwarming to see a mother walrus swimming with her calf. In documentaries such as this, one must take the bad with the good. This is especially true for younger audiences, who may not be aware of what happens out in the wild.

It's appropriate, then, that the filmmakers should include something about how we as a species affect our oceans. Show children the trash floating in the water, and the pollution running off from our rivers, and the animals caught in the fishing nets. This is what we have done and continue to do. It may only be a small sampling, but at least it makes them aware of it. And yet, there's no sense that the filmmakers are shaming or condemning us; if anything, they continuously try to instill a sense of optimism that we can, in fact, take steps to reverse the damage we've caused. I like this approach. We need to love our planet, but we don't need to feel guilty about who we are.

""Oceans"" is not merely entertaining and wonderfully shot. It's also insightful, and it effectively covers a wide range of topics in the space of just over 100 minutes. Despite its G rating, it doesn't pander to its young audience by making the animals overly sentimental; it simply presents them as they are, good and bad alike. It also has a point that it wants to argue, namely that we must know about our oceans if we're to protect them. This movie works nicely as a standalone piece, but it might do better as the first step in an ongoing quest for knowledge. Isn't it great when a film can do more than entertain, when it can actually inspire people to educate themselves and take part in something important?",1271894400,63,5163,4.789001122334455

Earths oceans symbolize the eternal mysteries of life and death themselves. No examination of them could ever completely solve that mystery. Perhaps it is better just to sit silently, observe, and respectfully marvel at the countless wonders oceans have to offer. With narrator Pierce Brosnan, and co-directors Jacques Perrin and Jacques Cluzaud, DisneyNatures Oceans takes exactly that simple approach.

DisneyNatures Oceans begins at a seashore, with a young boy silently gazing upon the water. Then, the documentary takes us on a rather comprehensive tour of the staggering variety of invertebrates (animals with no backbones), fish, birds, reptiles, and mammals that depend upon the sea for food, reproduction, communication, and even hygiene. Brosnan wisely does not talk endlessly throughout the documentary. Hell make an occasional remark about a previously unknown aspect about an animal, then largely let the classical musical score and the action speak for themselves. This reinforces the awe and respect humans really should feel for the ocean and all its creatures.

The animals run the gamut from sea slugs and crabs to colossal whales. For example, we see dolphins dash through the water and do spinning acrobatics. We witness sharks stalk and grab sea lions. We observe sea lions on land, quarreling with their neighbors and protecting their young from males sparring for breeding rights. All these animals, plus dive-bombing birds called gannets, chase a massive, whirling ball of sardines for their share of fish. We see giant humpback whales cooperate to trap sardines and herring in bubble nets and then scoop them up in vast mouthfuls. The largest creature in history, the blue whale, vacuums in tons of tiny, shrimp-like krill. We hear humpbacks vocalize with unique songs to communicate and attract mates. Killer whales swim perilously close to the shallows to snatch sea lion pups from the shore. Iguanas crop moss from boulders at the sea bottom. Baby sea turtles hatch and crawl frantically towards the water before they can be snatched up by a predator. A poisonous sea snake sinuously swims by. Various fish, including the largest living fish, the whale shark, allow tiny fish to swim around their face and mouth and eat the parasites and dead skin that annoy them, without ever giving into the temptation of swallowing them. A mother walrus cradles her chubby baby in the water.

The above images described in DisneyNatures Oceans, plus many others, show the harmonious balance among different animal species and their environments. Unlike other Disney nature documentaries, none of the animals shown (not even the sea lions, walruses, and penguins) are treated as comic buffoons or little people. They are wild, and often mysterious animals, and, I think, inspire curiosity and amazement. But then, DisneyNatures Oceans shows the main threat to this seemingly eternal harmony: us. With our noisy fishing boats and their wide nets entangling creatures besides fish, our oil refineries and hundreds of tons of pollution (one stark image shows a sea lion swimming past a shopping cart buried in the sea bed), this documentary shows that we have behaved shamefully towards the sea and that we must act soon to reverse our harmful influence before we lose the sea forever.

DisneyNature Oceans serves both as an educational biological and environmental documentary, and, I believe, should be shown in both middle school and high school science curricula. There are no truly graphic images of animal predation, although crabs, sardines and sea lions ARE killed and eaten; therefore, only truly sensitive people might not enjoy this documentary. However, there are also really astounding shots such as a scuba diver swimming alongside a 15-foot great white shark that make you appreciate the risks and chances these underwater photographers took to increase our oceanographic knowledge. Hopefully, that knowledge is increased enough so that people like you and me care enough to keep the eternal oceans just that  eternal. Fortunately, mankinds efforts to preserve the sea are the strongest they have ever been.",1454284800,,4174,5.3071104387291985

4168319,5,B003QF1N7K,"I saw the film - the uncut version. It satisfied my needs for watching films which virtually rape the senses. I rank it as one of the most disturbing and traumatizing movies I've ever seen.
The storyline is simple - a group of divers decide to put themselves into the shoes of the animals they encounter in the oceans - even if it means putting themselves at risk for exposing some of the horrific things stupid people do to satisfy their needs. If you're sensitive for scenes like definning this film is not for you. The brutal and horrifying reality the animals in the movie endure is also met with amazingly beautiful nature scenes most people will never see because they have been conditioned to live in an artificial world where direct contact with nature is not affordable to most people.
This is a film for strong stomachs and strong nerves and it was never meant to be a horror film - but it became one of the best documentaries where horror and fact merge and become one which have ever been produced - and also one of the most beautiful documentaries where nature and animal become one which have ever been produced.",1401840000,,1126,4.551724137931035

4168410,5,B003QF1N7K,"I grew up watching Disney's ""True Life Adventures"" and Cousteau specials on prime time, and I feel that nature specials need more attention to create than those I typically see ad nauseum on TV these days.  So I am a natural skeptic when it comes to nature movies.

After the first two minutes of slightly melodramatic mood-setting, Oceans takes you on a mesmerizing journey through both ocean life and the ocean itself.  The cinematography is outstanding, and many clips are of situations/creatures that I have never seen before -- I even like Pierce Brosnan's narration.

I wholeheartedly recommend this film, which I feel is appropriate even for very young children (it is one of my three-year-old's favorite films).  The footage and quality really are quite amazing.  It serves no purpose to tell you the specifics of what is in the film; like any great movie, it just deserves to be viewed.",1388102400,,895,4.894039735099338

Most of the filming is done underwater, and the shots are clear. This documentary is like a High Definition version of Blue Planet, and it looks better. It covers strange underwater vertebrate's that are mostly unknown, until watching this program. I enjoyed watching the large school of fish swimming together for protection. The view of the Humpback Whales swimming through crystal clear water stood out in my memory, the view was so clear it made me believe I was actually there.

This kind of documentary is one of the main reasons I invested in Blu-ray, and a High Def. television set. I am very pleased with this movie because, it offers and underwater adventure that feels like an aquarium in your living room. It also covers South African fur seals, being chased by Great White Sharks. And off the coast of South America, It shows Sea Lions, being pursued by Killer Whales. I first viewed this film from a streaming source; I didn't like the look of the water, so I decided to buy a Blue-ray copy.

I've had this movie for a couple of years now, and I'm just now getting around to posting a review about it. I would highly recommend this documentary for anyone's collection, you will not be disappointed. The part of this movie that stood out the most was the diver who approached the Great White Shark, and swam alongside of him, and it showed just how small the diver was compared to the shark. The Shark had a cute grin on his face that I will never forget. I also felt the diver took an unnecessary risk by showing off, just to be included in this film alongside the shark.",1364169600,,1702,4.5227272727272725

The French sound track is by far the easiest on the ear and you need a great surround sound system and large screen to really get the most out of the film. Some scenes seem almost too good, giving me the sense of aquarium shots now and again, but that is not to say that it actually was the case and if not then all credit to a first class production team.

The ocean is really a mysterious, fascinating, and oh, sooooo colorful, and beautiful! I knew it is, but after seeing this film, I discovered it is more beautiful than I could imagine! The animals, the life in the ocean is just exquisite...from the tiniest lifeforms to the largest whales. You would not know such beauty and grace before seeing this. It will leave you in awe. One part is shown which is not beautiful, and which is actually not part of the oceans natural realm. It is man-made-which is plastic. Millions of tons of plastic ends up in our oceans year after year. Our plastic is destroying life in the sea, and contaminating the water. Plastic never biodegrades or dissolves. It keeps breaking down into smaller and smaller pieces. Fish and birds, along with many other marine animals eat this plastic mistaking it for plankon or tiny shrimp like food. A larger fish will come along and eat the previous one-who has eaten the plastic. That's how it goes up the food chain. Humans are on top of that chain. When we eat fish, we are getting those chemicals of plastic back into our system. It is a shame what man has done to our own oceans, our planet which it the only planet we've got. For our oceans and all it contains to remain alive and beautiful for future generations to see, we must act now and fix what we've started, before it's too late. All our life depends on clean and healthy oceans, on water, and the fish we eat from it. If you can imagine an ocean without life someday, then you can also imagine a world without humans-due to our own destruction. I highly recommend this film. It will open your eyes, and hearts. To inspire you to want to keep the beauty the way it should be. This film did for me. We now must think about how much fish we catch. We should stop overfishing. Only catch what we really need-and no more. We also must think before we throw something away, and how we dispose of it. You never know. What we throw, may soon end up where we want it the least.

Over all, again, an excellent film for both children and adults. It is for all ages. I recently discovered that the talented actor, Pierce Brosnan is actually very much involved with ocean/marine conservation. He is the narrator of this film and makes it very simple and strait forward-easy to understand for all ages. I gained a lot of respect and appreciation for him. God Bless him. I'm sure you would wish him the same. And God Bless all of you. In hopes that this video inspires you to make a change in how we live to make the ocean continue to live. I read somewhere recently that the oceans are the lungs of our planet. It is a good way to put it. It is true. It can not breath without our part.",1319760000,,2853,4.413662239089184

My advice to the film makers would be to leave this controversial subject out of the film.  If you want to learn more about evidence for creation, one of my favorite resources is drdino.com.

I'm interested in all parts of nature, but developed a special love for the ocean when I was privileged to spend 2 of my teenage years with my family on Guam in the late 1960's.  We wasted no time qualifying for our reef passes, and getting familiar with the beautiful coral reefs and the multitude of life forms that abounded there; which ones to beware of, and which were harmless.  This movie reminded me of the thrill of just observing the natural beauty every direction you turned.  This is a movie I can't wait to share with my grandchildren.  From the 8 year old science lover down to the 3 year old investigator, this will be enthralling to all of them.  While this does have an important environmental message, it's not the only message throughout the movie.  This is more about understanding how wondrous and valuable the oceans are, and how critical it is that we make changes to preserve them.",1315008000,,1003,4.632768361581921

4168606,3,B003QF1N7K,"This film is eye candy, but not much more. The cinematography is beautiful, but the editing and writing is a mess. The commentary is uninformative. Rather than really teach the audience anything, the narration merely comments on the visual aspects of the footage in pseudo-poetic mindless drivel (""As the moonlight dances happily on the rippling waters, sea lions come out to play."") Ordinarily, I like nature documentaries, but with no worthwhile commentary, this 84-minute feature seemed twice as long. Transitions between scenes were abrupt with no connecting narrative. What's more, the film never took us more than about fifteen feet below the ocean's surface. In a film grandly titled ""Oceans,"" I would have expected and appreciated at least a few minutes to be devoted to some of the seldom seen deep sea creatures. Instead we get four and five minute sequences of large boats rocking on the ocean's surface during a storm. This film is shallow in every sense of the word. Rather than help us to care about the creatures depicted by knowing something about them, the filmmakers seem content to act like kids with Polaroids at the aquarium, snapping a picture of every animal without ever taking time to read the plaques or even note the names of what they're seeing. In the end, you get a random shuffling of sea animal pictures lazily stitched together with seemingly little sense or purpose. In this case, the photographers had a great deal more than Polaroids to work with and obviously the skill to go with it. The images are breathtaking, but there's no thought behind them.",1313452800,,1586,4.943820224719101

4168608,5,B003QF1N7K,"This is, without a doubt, the best ""nature film"" I've ever seen.  In addition to absolutely beautiful -- artistic -- footage of wondrous creatures, great and small, there are also shots, from various angles, of scenes that I had never seen before:  gulls dive-bombing a school of fish (amid leaping dolphins); schools of fish swirling in a perfect cone shape, morphing into a perfect sphere; a mother (dugong? seal? I don't remember) holding her baby close with her flipper (that image actually brought tears to my eyes); newly hatched sea turtles making a desperate, instinctive run for the safety of the sea (only to be picked off, one by one, by waiting birds); a very weird creature vacuuming the ocean floor for dinner; and many others.  The videography was almost poetic - I loved a shot of one of the divers swimming next to a shark.

Other people have complained about the narration, but I thought it was perfect.  I think the idea was for viewers to focus on the images, and Pierce Brosnan's narration was almost subliminal.",1313107200,,1033,4.780898876404494
4168609,5,B003QF1N7K,"I just finished seeing this film, and I have never before seen such serene images on the screen.  I watched in awe through the first viewing, and immediately thereafter, watched it a second time.  It was during this 2nd view that I was overwhelmed.  I realized that tears were trickling down my face in viewing the sheer magnitude of what I was seeing.
I found myself watching this film with my eyes, ears, and mouth wide open.  I saw images that in all my years, I never REALLY appreciated until today.  There is up-close video of animals in all phases of their lives. A lover of the ocean since childhood, I was awestruck with the pictures that I saw.  The word 'excited' doesn't even begin to describe my emotions.  During this movie, I grew to have a new understanding and appreciation for the ocean's creatures.
Species I've never seen or read about.  Such beauty and grace, even in the violent food gathering of the orca.  Their method for hunting includess a method for hunting sea lion pups.  They race through the waves, to the sand, almost beaching themselves, and pluck them off the sand, one by one.
Other visions that I will never forget:
A close-up of starfish walking on a rock...you could see the hundreds of tiny tube feet pushing it along.
Pelicans diving en masse to a school of sardines, to fill themselves with one of their prey.
Whales asleep peacefully, side-by-side, upside down in their mystical clear waters.  Shortly their ""massive and majestic body will be gliding along the ocean floor, without disturbing a single grain of sand"".
Views of a sea lion gliding about, then ""chasing a porcupine puffer fish for fun"".
Crabs that 'tiptoe' by snoozing sea lions, hoping that they will not be it's snack.
A great white shark leaping of of the water to catch a seal mid-jump.
Video of a blue whales' mouth and front body so engorged with water and their prey, the tiny krill.  Followed by them expelling the water, and leave themselves with a mouthful, a tasty appetizer.
Sizes of animals from the massiveness of the whale, to the tiny luminescent plankton that inhabit the depths.

All of this joined by photography was just outstanding.  Scenes were filmed from a variety of locations.  One was with a camera mounted on a heli-cam, just above the surface, to capture detailed images that I've never seen.  A camera on the end of a torpedo, capturing animals, in a way that others can only dream of.  On board ship cameras were utilized, and of course, underwater cameras as well.  Slow motion photography was utilized almost throughout, which was truly improved by the well-chosen words of the narration.  As narrated, ""Then in the span of one lifetime, as the human race reached for the stars, it seems like all of nature got out of whack"".  This was followed by images of the destruction and pollution that man is responsible for.

I saw instincts in animals that made me feel so small and unimportant in this world.  I was tied to the screen...it is the most explosive, gentle, riveting film of any type that I've ever seen.

All in all, visions that I've heard of before, read about before, but never REALLY SAW until now.

I wished that I had seen this on a full screen -- I imagine that it would have been breathtaking!  I will never forget this film.  Partially because I plan on going online later today to purchase a copy for myself, and for my aging mother, another true lover of the world beneath the surface.",1311984000,,3443,4.64026402640264

4168634,3,B003QF1N7K,"I bought this to show to a whole school of Elementary kids for Earth Day.  Last year we showed DIsney's Earth whih the kids loved.  I think they liked this one ok too, but there wasn't as much humor or action, and Pierce Brosnan narrated in this very lazy voice that made you want to fall asleep.  It was just a little too slow.  I think the kids enjoyed it, but I spent the whole time trying to keep my attention focused.  Hope next year's African Lions is a little more upbeat.

However, the scenery was still spectacular and it did have its moments (the army of crabs, the sea turtles, the sharks but there should've been MORE shark footage!)--it was a very beautiful film.  Just not geared for kids as much as I'd like.",1304121600,,723,4.311111111111111
4168635,5,B003QF1N7K,"My kindergartner and I watched this on a lazy Sunday morning, and we were both riveted to the screen the entire time, pausing to discuss what we saw every now and then. Pierce Brosnan's narration was suitably subtle, in rhythm with the gentle cadences of nature on-screen, and dramatic when the scenes on-screen called for it (as in the scene portraying a Great White shark hunting its prey).

The soundtrack was sublime - calm, soothing times when portraying birds in flight over the ocean; reaching a crescendo when there was something dramatic being shown on-screen, such as a killer whale hunting sealions, or a magnificent humpback whale creating the surface. The underwater scenes are incredibly detailed, providing the viewer with close-up scenes that had my little one practically gaping at the screen, and exclaiming each time she recognized a sea creature (we are frequent aquarium visitors).

This is a wonderful way to introduce children to the wonders of the oceans. It is a virtual field trip that will have youngsters clamoring to find out more about the amazing oceans and the fascinating creatures that live within.",1303689600,,1132,5.080645161290323

took to get the shots in this masterpiece. The photography is nothing less than breathtaking. There are shots of the ocean and its inhabitants in this film that will make your jaw drop. In the first few minutes of the film there is this AWESOME aerial fly over
of a rocky coastline where the waves are just pumping against the shore as the camera glides by with storm brewing dark skies in the backdrop. Not only does this scene look amazing, but it sounds amazing with the DTS-HD audio!! Most people know
the oceans are in trouble due to a number of human factors, (pollution, global warming, over fishing etc.) So attention Parents!! This is the stuff you should be showing to your kids. This is family entertainment with a great message. Hats off to Disney Nature
for showing us the beauty of our oceans and how fragile they are. I am looking forward to more films like this from disney nature.",1300406400,2,1156,4.5625

4168640,2,B003QF1N7K,"The film has some amazing cinematography that rivals that of BBC nature documentaries, but the writing is extremely banal and moronic.

The writer obviously did no research and had no idea what he saw on the screen, so he compensated it with flowery overwriting that means nothing. Instead of finding out what sea otters eat he wrote ""tender morsels"", instead of finding out how many species are destroyed by human activity, he wrote ""countless"". The film is filled with idiotic remarks like
""Born of a miraculous mixture of matter and energy, the ocean is an ancient place""---the land isn't?
""The yellow fin tuna can make some serious time, speeding through the ocean from east to west and west to east""---if that were really true, for what purpose?
""As far as the eye can see, north and south and east and west, the ocean smiles at the sky""---you will never find garbage like this in BBC nature docs.
""If dragons really do exist, this is where you find the narwhal, unicorn of the sea."" ---dragons equal unicorns?

There is a scene of sea birds, dolphins and whales feeding on a sardine ball similar to that in BBC's Nature's Most Amazing Events. I wouldn't have known what was going on if I didn't watch the BBC documentary, because in this film through the whole event the narrator was silent, merely saying at the beginning ""Barely scratch the surface, you will find charging herds in a breathless chase."" Herds of what? Chasing for what?

There is a great scene of millions of crabs of the same species moving toward each other and piling up. All the narrator says is that it is a ""fight"". I still don't know what was happening. This really makes me miss BBC nature docs.

There are some striking satellite images of mouths of rivers spewing pollutants, I'd like to know which rivers those are, sure enough, the narrator doesn't say. And what he does say has no credibility.

Watching this film is like listening to someone talking about things he knows nothing about for 1.5 hrs. You will learn nothing new about the ocean afterward. Spare yourself the pain and watch BBC docs instead. And to the cinematographers, you are wasting your talent, find a job with BBC!",1299369600,9,2171,4.7026315789473685

4168660,5,B003QF1N7K,"At first glance I thought this movie was just rehashed footage from the series Blue Planet, or Planet Earth...I was wrong. This is not like Disney Natures Earth movie which was recycled footage from The BBC series Planet Earth, this is all new, breathtaking, gorgeous underwater footage. In my opinion, one of the most artistic beautiful nature films I have seen...and I have seen tons! This is also one of the best films to show off HD TV picture quality and sound! I did notice the look of the footage has been altered to give it a more cinematic look. it is almost like they applied some kind of filter to bleach out the whites and give the blues a richer tint. This might bother some purists, but I think it really enhances the mood of the film. Most modern nature films are altered in some way. The only negative of the film was the awful pop song in the end credits that does not fit in at all with the rest of the film...why Disney...why did you do that to this film? Oh well, at least it's only for the credits.

I rented this movie through netflix, but I liked it so much I decided to cruise over to Amazon and buy it. Man, the price of these disney nature movies are really up there! I also wanted to buy ""The Crimson Wing"" another great Disney nature film, but these are both in the $26-29 dollar range...What the heck disney! I can buy the whole Planet Earth or Life series for a few dollars more (If I didn't already have them). Disney is one of the few companies that could afford to drop prices a bit, but I guess that's what made them as big as they are today. I may have to buy these used or get them on ebay. I wish bluray prices would come down a bit.

Anyways, the film is great, and I can't wait to see ""African Cats"" in 2011!",1293235200,8,1747,4.196428571428571

While true, they are selling the masters at Disney films short...for ""Disney's Oceans"" is quite simply, the most dynamic, mesmerizing and breathtaking nature film I have ever seen.  Perfect for all ages, the artistry of the filmmakers has captured the grace, uniqueness and raw power of one of the least explored parts of our planet...our oceans.  While I had rented the video for my daughter and I, I ended up buying it as a gift for my 99 year old grandfather, who has had numerous requests to offer encore showings as the evening's entertainment at his retirement village.

I sat and watched it with my 18 month old grandson who was so mesmerized that he had to stand right in front of our 32'' screen.  The actual footage and real live situations of marine life and the food chain were not as negative as some others I have seen but true to life and factual.

I even had the chance to meet two of the divers that had work on the production of this movie well I myself workt on a documentary in sulawesi Indonesia. If I hadnt seen earth or life I problaly would have liked this one as another nothing new kind of oke doc,but after watching the series earth, life, the most amazing events from the BBC, it just made this movie look like a very bad copy with nothing spectacular execpt a few shots of the crabs and someone swimming with great whites there was nothing good about it. The colours were terrible and the blue ray quality was unacceptable. I saw it yesterday and had the whole family meaning 14 people get together and got the movie started on my vw15 lcd sony projector on a 250 inch screen. And man ho man what a dissapointment this was. The colours of each image was so poor that even the coral reefs lookt all bleach out. The narrateding of broce pierce was the worst ever. Sometime without expectation you would hear this uninterested voice come out of the blue talking about something he didn't care or knew anything about. I will never watch this thing again and from now on I will screen all new documentaries before inviting anyone for a screening. If you have seen the series earth, ocean oasies or the series life this one is a total waste of money apart for seing a few animal dying in fish nets really a total bogus. Iam still angry at myself to have emmuliated myself towards other members of my family with such a piece of garbage. The colours the high definition supposely blu ray and the narrating. How could someone even considerd making such a piece of garbage after series made by the BBC is behond me.

But then there's the well-modulated, politely bored narration. Another reviewer wrote that she watches the film with the sound turned off, which sounds like a fine idea. I watched Perrin's Microcosmos years ago, when my son was very young. All these insects doing inexplicable things, my son repeatedly asking ""What are they doing?!"" and I couldn't tell him because the movie didn't give us a clue! That movie had almost no narration, this one has plenty, but it's not a good fit. Definitely watch this masterpiece of nature photography, it's gorgeous and moving--one time with the sound on, so you know the names and locations, then just look at the pictures.

A bit silly, just going on about how we have to be *in* the ocean to *understand* the ocean. Got a bit old.
