3165095,5,B0016RNONQ,"I saw this movie recently and loved it. The story line and plot draws one in very quickly, even if you are not a bike racing fan. The movie had several plot twists that I never saw coming and kept me wondering what was going to happen next. But as a biking fan, I also loved the racing footage and found my heart beating during several of the race scenes. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, young or old alike!!!",1300320000,5,424,4.182926829268292
3165096,4,B0016RNONQ,Was privileged to attend the premiere of this movie and must say it was one of the more inspiring movies I have seen.  Beautiful camera work with awesome race scenes and a good drama to boot.  Very thought provoking and family friendly.,1300233600,9,236,4.595238095238095

3165130,3,B0016RNONQ,"This movie has a lot of emotional driven scenes.  However, the end point of this film is about how a person turns to God and surrenders their life to him after having experienced the loss of his family in a car accident.

Preoccupied with battling his own inner demons, Chris reluctantly acclimates the prodigy, named Jake, to the fast paced world of Bicycle Racing. Using cutting edge technology and scientific training methods, Chris transforms Jake into a top contending cyclist; however, he struggles to teach Jake the most important lesson prominent in all champions - finding the true potential inside.",1362528000,,612,5.5212765957446805

3165136,4,B0016RNONQ,"Pro athletes have the ability to take it to that next level in competition, and sometimes that can be applied in their lives too. All to often that champion in us is foiled when our personal lives are attacked. We all have heard of the athletes at the top of their game. But their personal lives start to effect their performance in the game. That is what happens when tradgety strikes a cycle champion. For some reason, when it gets personal, that champions life starts to disenegrate. But can that heart of a champion apply what he has learned on the track, to his personal tradgety, and come back? Watch and see.",1359849600,,615,4.5
3165137,1,B0016RNONQ,"This is one for the choir. If you're not into Christian movies, don't waste your money or time on this vehicle for not very subtle Christian propaganda.

The title alone is a warning: ""The Potential Inside"", really? When was, ever, anyone's potential seen ""outside"" the individual? Apparently the aimed at audience is expected to have its ""Is"" dotted and its ""Ts"" neatly crossed to get the full message. Another revealing sign: all chronological indications appear as banners across the screen, e.g.: ""6 months before"", like in the silent movies of old; the usual techniques such as flashbacks, etc, must have been deemed too sophisticated and confusing for the intended audience.  Voice over narrations explain the who, what and where. It is early on that the genuine movie aficionado realizes it's going to be laborious viewing.

The story line is lamely predictable and in spite of the fast paced bicycle action it feels very slow going.

The characters are flat, one dimensional stereotypes with interpersonal conflicts so worn out that the term ""cliche"" is too lenient. The actors' modest talent is powerless to give life to these ready-made didactic  puppets, the dialogues remain trite, predictable, corny. One feels sorry for the cast who had to labor with such leaden material, but then everyone needs to make a living and young actors can't be choosy. The female spouses are especially cookie cutter types.

There is The Black Character, thoroughly stranded and alone in a see of Whites; where did he come from and how did he get into the mountain bike world, we never get to know. He has no family, no girlfriend, no interests but coaching and preaching on the side; the origins of his relation with the main character remain a mystery throughout. He is there just to help along, be of comfort, preach a little, sort of a spiritual footman. He is so lacking a life of his own that he even baby-sits in the happy end. One soon suspects that his character was actually parachuted to provide some racial diversity in the guise of a nice, polite, helpful, patient, kind, inspiring, comforting, strong, black token. No, the actor is not Sidney Poitier.

There are nice shots of the Blue Ridge Mountains, nothing breathtaking nor original in the least though, just Hallmark cards-like: average commercial nice. All country views, farmlands and farms are manicured, even the junkyard is neat and orderly, this world seems to have been borrowed from some travel agency video. Virginia subsidizes movies made in the state, were the producers giving back for the help received?

The mountain bike racing content is quite interesting, documentary-like, thanks to suspenseful grueling racing scenes it is the only memorable aspect of this weak, ideologically ponderous production.

With metronome regularity the Black Wise Character, later on the second major white one --the trainee-- drop a few loaded questions, recite religious advice: faith will solve all; they sound like they've memorized one of these pamphlets left behind in supermarkets and public phones. Those scenes have the feel of religious commercials, only the brand name is missing. Halfway through the movie we had predicted the ending and, oh surprise, it did have that exact happy ending --yawn.

This is a one purpose only movie, and it is not to entertain but to promote a more active involvement with their religion to sporting males who neglected their faith for whatever worldly reason; as such it is a revival trying to pass itself for a movie, a looooooooooong religious  infomercial --yawn.

I have seen incomparably better made for TV movies.

Thank Goodness, I didn't waste any money on it since it was offered as a ""door prize"", ""booby prize"" rather!

I'll keep it; should I give it to Goodwill or the Salvation Army, some good person might end up wasting her/his $2.50 on this product and, after all, it is a specimen in and of itself.

Boring though. Earnestly, unremittingly, extremely boring. It was a chore to watch it till the end, but I forced myself just so I could honestly say I had seen all of it. It is so tedious that you may forget pausing it if you need to temporarily leave the viewing area.

Positive aspects:
Technically good DVD.
Very informative and thorough about mountain bikes and bicycle racing like a ""how to"" feature. Interesting, very well shot racing sequences.
A good example of the Christian movie genre, its limitations and how strangely flat and uninspiring it can be.
Will satisfy those with a limited cinematic experience and low expectations: the Ned Flanders families and Reverends Timothy Lovejoy.

Once again: strictly for the choir.",1359763200,,4652,4.997412677878396
3165148,5,B0016RNONQ,"I bought this DVD in May of 2011 for a friend who loves cycling and was going through a difficult time.  He thoroughly enjoyed the film and was inspired and encouraged by it.  I haven't been able to borrow it so I can see it myself, though!  I'm just glad this movie came along at the right time for my friend.",1337385600,,310,4.049180327868853
3165149,4,B0016RNONQ,"A definite must, for your Christian film collection. My family enjoyed it very much, both on a spiritual level, and on the ""get out there and and get active!"" level. Thanks, guys!",1336262400,,179,4.625
3165150,5,B0016RNONQ,"Great story, Great message. I'm glad I finally bought this film. It's not often you find a Christian film that is done with this level of quality. The cycling action is great too; never seen a film about professional cycling",1336089600,,224,4.625
3165151,5,B0016RNONQ,"Jerry Franks (The Fall Guy, CHiPs), casting director, so we're off to a great start.  Then we introduce Ransford Doherty of The Closer.  His subtle, slow, southern charm, still evident even in this contrasting supporting role.  Enter Scotty Curlee, fitting this starring character like he was born to play, and destined to be known for this role, in this movie.

The beginning of the film reminds me of how we get lost in marriage.  Lost in a ""you belong to me"" mentality.  We think we have the right to make demands, make sacrifices on behalf of our mate, and control their actions and passions. Conversely, perspective, tragedy, change, and conviction lend itself to solving the issues of selfishness that are the plot and basis for this rare cinematic find.

The Lynchburg mountain views, rolling roads, and winding paths made a beautiful backdrop for this movie of moving faith.  I found the film to be an emotional drama, demanding of actors, and asking of viewers.",1335830400,,970,4.871951219512195
3165152,5,B0016RNONQ,"""The Potential Inside"" in one of my favorite movies, and it is one of only 3 that jumped there the first time I watched it. Like ""Courageous"", which came out later the same year, it is a compelling story with an equally compelling message. I am a cyclist, so that part appealed to me right away. And I am a Christian missionary, so I saw a pontential that others may not, to witness how God can work through life's darkest moments. This is a wonderful movie. I have given away a half-dozen copies so far. Buy it, watch it, share it.",1335657600,,532,4.2772277227722775

3165156,5,B0016RNONQ,Enjoyable for the whole family and carries a great message. Great to see good outdoor sport shots with beautiful scenery.,1306022400,,121,5.1
3165157,4,B0016RNONQ,"Other than the beginning, where the wife is mad at the husband for bike racing but the movie never develops or solves that issue and other than some overly-long bike racing scenes, this story is a winner. It follows the grieving and healing process that a bike racer goes through when he loses his daughter in a car crash. The process involves finding meaning again in life and in what he loves to do (racing; coaching) and compassion for others. It's thought provoking and I would recommend it despite some parts of the story not being buttoned-up.",1304985600,2,549,4.670103092783505
3165178,5,B0016RNONQ,"Awesome movie.  Well done, acting is very real...I have not seen such a good family movie in a while!  I hope that anyone in any walk of life will watch this movie with an open heart to see what God can do, even through our trials, when we let HIM take the reigns of our lives, and obey HIS words.  Nice to see the emotional side of men, who are able to share with the audience the reality of being human.  All glory to God our Creator and Savior.",1303689600,4,447,3.9887640449438204
3165179,5,B0016RNONQ,"Loved this inspirational and motivational film that is character of many sports related films.  However, love the added part that reminds us of the Biblical character Job.  In spite of so many of life's difficulties, God works out things for the good of those that let Him (much like the character in the movie).  Thanks for making a great film for all audiences!!!!  Keep them coming.",1303603200,3,385,4.787878787878788

This film is excellent !! Just finished watching it. The acting was superb. The story line kept our interest. The music really added so much to the film. Most of all the message was so real, and I loved how these men shared their struggles with one another. Our relationship with God is what gets us through the difficult times of life, and this film showed this in a very realistic way. Well done !!",1303257600,2,558,5.888888888888889

3165184,5,B0016RNONQ,"Fast paced, thought provoking, and inspiring do not do enough to describe this movie. A strong family friendly and real world plot combined with some great camera work and beautiful Virginia Blue Ridge scenery add to the viewing experience. It definitely makes you think about how deep you need to reach and who you need to reach for to find meaning in life after what seems important is lost. This is a must see for anyone who enjoys the best parts of competitive sports, mountain biking, or anyone who really wants to watch a movie with some positive values.",1301097600,2,560,4.666666666666667
3165185,5,B0016RNONQ,"This movie really helps you put life into perspective. Great family movie for older kids, highly recommend for youth groups as well. Not your typical cheesy Christian film. Loved it!",1300838400,2,182,5.1

3165187,5,B0016RNONQ,"This film is not just about mountain biking or racing. It is not a hit 'em hard the hellfire nor is it a weak-kneed apology for Christianity. What it is is a motivating and inspiring film about a real guy with real problems and is  for the real family. Fear, joy, disappointment, failure,grief and redemption are themes worth considering.

The movie is brilliantly cast and directed. It is of the highest quality in production and artistry. You will laugh and cry as you view the story of a broken man who finally understands the love of the Father.

Audiences of both genders and every age will appreciate this movie. Don't fear if you are not an athlete thinking you won't be able to relate. You can. The story goes way beyond the surface of the mountain bike racing world. This is a must see!",1300320000,15,795,4.506944444444445

Conversely, perspective, tragedy, change, and conviction lend itself to solving the issues of selfishness that are the plot and basis for this rare cinematic find.

The Lynchburg mountain views, rolling roads, and winding paths made a beautiful backdrop for this movie of moving faith.  I found the film to be an emotional drama, demanding of actors, and asking of viewers.",1335830400,,970,4.871951219512195
3399649,5,B0016RNONQ,"""The Potential Inside"" in one of my favorite movies, and it is one of only 3 that jumped there the first time I watched it. Like ""Courageous"", which came out later the same year, it is a compelling story with an equally compelling message. I am a cyclist, so that part appealed to me right away. And I am a Christian missionary, so I saw a pontential that others may not, to witness how God can work through life's darkest moments. This is a wonderful movie. I have given away a half-dozen copies so far. Buy it, watch it, share it.",1335657600,,532,4.2772277227722775

3399654,4,B0016RNONQ,"Other than the beginning, where the wife is mad at the husband for bike racing but the movie never develops or solves that issue and other than some overly-long bike racing scenes, this story is a winner. It follows the grieving and healing process that a bike racer goes through when he loses his daughter in a car crash. The process involves finding meaning again in life and in what he loves to do (racing; coaching) and compassion for others. It's thought provoking and I would recommend it despite some parts of the story not being buttoned-up.",1304985600,2,549,4.670103092783505

I hope that anyone in any walk of life will watch this movie with an open heart to see what God can do, even through our trials, when we let HIM take the reigns of our lives, and obey HIS words.  Nice to see the emotional side of men, who are able to share with the audience the reality of being human.  All glory to God our Creator and Savior.",1303689600,4,447,3.9887640449438204

In spite of so many of life's difficulties, God works out things for the good of those that let Him (much like the character in the movie).  Thanks for making a great film for all audiences!!!!

This film is excellent !! Just finished watching it. The acting was superb. The story line kept our interest. The music really added so much to the film. Most of all the message was so real, and I loved how these men shared their struggles with one another. Our relationship with God is what gets us through the difficult times of life, and this film showed this in a very realistic way. Well done !!",1303257600,2,558,5.888888888888889

A strong family friendly and real world plot combined with some great camera work and beautiful Virginia Blue Ridge scenery add to the viewing experience. It definitely makes you think about how deep you need to reach and who you need to reach for to find meaning in life after what seems important is lost. This is a must see for anyone who enjoys the best parts of competitive sports, mountain biking, or anyone who really wants to watch a movie with some positive values.",1301097600,2,560,4.666666666666667

3399684,5,B0016RNONQ,"This film is not just about mountain biking or racing. It is not a hit 'em hard the hellfire nor is it a weak-kneed apology for Christianity. What it is is a motivating and inspiring film about a real guy with real problems and is  for the real family. Fear, joy, disappointment, failure,grief and redemption are themes worth considering.

The movie is brilliantly cast and directed. It is of the highest quality in production and artistry. You will laugh and cry as you view the story of a broken man who finally understands the love of the Father.

Audiences of both genders and every age will appreciate this movie. Don't fear if you are not an athlete thinking you won't be able to relate. You can. The story goes way beyond the surface of the mountain bike racing world. This is a must see!",1300320000,15,795,4.506944444444445

8264177,1,B0016RNONQ,Got to be one of the worst films I have ever watched. Watched it because I am interested in bike racing but the acting and plot were pathetic. The idea that you can only win by God doping is ridiculous. The coach is so self obsessed is such a pre-pubescent way you just want to give him a slap and tell him to grow up.
