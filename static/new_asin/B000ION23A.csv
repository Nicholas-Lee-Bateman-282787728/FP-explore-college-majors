2660195,4,B000ION23A,"I couldn't help but like The Ant Bully!  The visuals were amazing, a plus if seen in Imax.

I liked the characters and the people sent to voice them.  The talent they found for this movie is amazing!

The story isn't bad.  It was a bit disappointing though.  They could have fleshed out their plot a bit more.  88 minutes didn't give enough time to cover any more than the absolute basics.

The message given out was helpful.  Empathy and helping each other.  Use your differences to make your world a better place.  That's something most adults haven't learned to do!

All in all, I liked The Ant Bully.  I'll probably buy it on DVD when it comes out and watch it a few more times!

Not that it didn't come with a few disappointments.  Still, it's certainly not the worst movie I've ever seen.  Not by far.

I'd recommend that you see it and make up your own mind.

As a side note, I really liked the scores!  I'm a sucker for anything remotely beautiful when it comes to movie scores!",1157155200,4,986,4.318681318681318
2660196,2,B000ION23A,"The Ant Bully (John A. Davis, 2006)

Davis (Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius) returns with this Pixar-esque kids' flick that is, in reality, not for kids. Nothing is sacred here, and not terribly much of it is funny. Who decided potty humor was a worthwhile place to go in a movie aimed at the preteen set?

Lucas Nickle (The Backyardigans' Zack Tyler) is a kid who gets bullied by the neighborhood lugnut and his toadies. Looking for something he can bully in turn, he happens upon an ant's nest. The problem is, ants are just as intelligent (if not more so) as humans, and Zoc (Nicolas Cage), the nest's wizard, concocts a potion that will make Lucas ant-sized so he can pay for his crimes. The colony's queen (Meryl Streep) decrees that Lucas will not be allowed to return to the human world until he learns to think like an ant, and your stock fish-out-of-water comedy plot begins.

To be fair, the second half of the movie, when Lucas is starting to get the idea, has some good one-liners. But it's not enough to overcome the vapid, vaguely offensive first half. **",1156377600,5,1063,4.554973821989528
2660197,2,B000ION23A,"Bright vivid colors, fantastical creatures, stars providing voices, a boy's journey into an unusual world; all are hallmarks of great animation. Yet, in ""The Ant Bully"", the newest animated film to hit theaters this summer, these elements combine and fail to create magic.

Released one week after ""Monster House"", the two films have a number of striking similarities beyond the obvious use of computer generated animation. These similarities only serve to force an unfavorable comparison to the newer film.

But first, the story...

Lucas (Zach Tyler), a boy small for his age, finds it difficult to live in his suburban neighborhood; a large bully leads a gang of kids around and Lucas is the frequent object of their atomic wedgies and dog piles. Powerless, he takes his aggressions out on an ant colony in his front yard. He has become such a constant threat to the colony they have named him Lucas the Destroyer. Lucas' parents depart for a second honeymoon to `Puerko Vallcarta', leaving Lucas and his older sister, Tiffany (Allison Mack), in the care of their alien obsessed grandmother, Mommo (Lily Tomlin). Zoc (Nicholas Cage), the wizard of the ant colony, creates a potion designed to shrink humans down to their size and leads an expedition including Hova (Julia Roberts), Kreela (Regina King) and Fugax (Bruce Campbell) to test the potion on Lucas. After Lucas has shrunk down, they return to the ant colony, where the Queen (Meryl Streep) declares that Lucas must live with them, become one of them. Hova decides to care for Lucas and teach him the ways of the colony, much to Zoc's dismay. As Lucas becomes familiar with the ways of the Any Colony, they must contend with a new enemy, Stan Beals (Paul Giamatti), the human exterminator.

Its interesting that two animated films released a week apart feature adventures of little boys who are essentially home alone. This is an effort to make the journey both more interesting and more dangerous, both of which would make it more meaningful. ""Monster"" does a better job of this. All children have some sort of a scary house situation in their childhood, the scary house no one wanted to go near. We can relate.

Because Lucas' journey is more fantastical (yes, I know ""Monster House"" has a possessed house, but even so) it has to work harder to make the story even slightly believable. Ants running around, talking, with little miniature boys, is more of a stretch.

The animation is beautiful, filled with bright, vivid colors, evoking a summertime setting. When Lucas joins the ant colony, the blades of grass in his front yard become as tall as a forest. As the adventure moves to different areas, common objects take on an uncommon beauty; a puddle of water becomes a beautiful lake, a garden gnome becomes a huge sculpture. The color palette aids in making these familiar objects appear unusually interesting. The bright colors make all inanimate objects appear real.

But even this works against the film, in a way, making it seem more unrealistic. ""Monster"", set during Halloween, is aided by a more somber color palette, perfectly evoking the fall setting. Again, its an animated film, but the darker colors help the filmmakers create a more interesting sense of reality.

All of the star power doesn't really add to ""Ant"". If you didn't recognize the voices, you would be hard pressed to tell Nicholas Cage, Julia Roberts and Meryl Streep were in the film at all, let alone playing the ants; Streep has all of two scenes. In many animated films, the actors are cast for their personalities and they add an extra dimension to the character. Disney is particularly good at this, giving the same characters familiar facial features matching the actor; Robin Williams as the Genie in ""Aladdin"", Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Potts in ""Beauty and the Beast"", James Woods as Hades in ""Hercules"" are all memorable examples. In ""Polar Express"", the filmmakers put Tom Hanks in a special suit and he portrayed a number of the characters, all of which were animated to resemble him. Putting aside the creepy factor, at least the characters had some personality. In ""Ant"", nothing is done to differentiate the ant characters. They look different, but just slightly and the animators don't imbue the creatures with the individual personalities of the actors. Paul Giamatti is the most successful because Stan is actually able to display some emotion, his eyes shifting to show his ulterior motives.

Another commonly used element in successful animated films in humor. Sometimes, it is too juvenile because the filmmakers are attempting to please only the children in the audience. Other films use humor to satisfy both young and old creating an experience to be remembered for a long time. Then, there is ""Ant"". Long, long, long periods of the film go by with nary a chuckle. The two most promising elements, Stan Beals and Mommo (Lily Tomllin) do generate some laughs, but the story is about Lucas' trip into the ant colony. During this portion of the film, the majority of the story, any humor is very juvenile and goes over with a thud.

The climatic fight between the ants and Stan is impressively done. The ants enlist a group of wasps to launch a war on the human and the camera follows them as they fly into battle. Each time Stan manages to swat a wasp away, we follow the winged insect's descent. As the wasps fly over the terrain of the giant, it looks like they are coming in for a landing on an aircraft carrier. These movements help to give this sequence a roller coaster ride feel as the ants swoop in, flying over the terrain of the human's body.

""The Ant Bully"" is a bright, colorful film which will probably keep very young kids occupied for hours. Buy them the DVD and let them sit in front of the television. Or you could put in a Disney or Pixar film and expose them to a much better effort, something you could enjoy together. Or take them to a park and let them create their own adventures.",1154390400,10,5969,4.796692607003891

I bought this for my brother as he loves 'ante movies' like this, Bug's Life and Antz. He liked this one as much. I actually ended up buying a used copy and it was PERFECT! Didn't even know it was used. Only difference was how it was shipped. Still two day prime shipping, but it wasn't triple wrapped in plastic. Fun movie, a few potty and nudity jokes, so if you don't like that, beware. They aren't that bad, just when the boy changes into an ante and back to human, he grows too small, then too big for his clothes. So they are just being true to life. The grandmother makes a joke about it, but otherwise it's ignored. There there is some jokes about peeing and more body jokes like that. So if you are really against that, this movie might not be exactly what you want, but if you don't mind, go for it. It is a fun movies.",1363478400,,1102,4.082949308755761

If you have seen it, you know what I mean, if you haven't seen it yet, rent it and after that you will want to buy it, so you can play it whenever the kiddies come to visit.

2660828,5,B000ION23A,"The Ant Bully is meaningful for a couple different reasons.  One, it shows children that they CAN respond and stand up to bullies despite what they feel is an overwhelming obstacle standing in their way, and two, it shows that it's probably best to show respect for ALL living creatures, even the smallest of insects such as an ant!

It's an animated story about a boy who gets picked on by a bully while standing in his front yard one day.  After the bully knocks him to the ground, the boy then gets angry about it, and takes out his revenge on the ants that are building a pretty sizeable nest in his front yard.  Well it turns out the ants are talkative, intelligent, and apparently genius little insects that actually have the ability to turn the little boy into a smaller boy- MUCH smaller, say, the size of an ant!

You guessed it right- the ants -despite constantly referring to the boy as a ""destroyer"" for the way he eliminates and tortures ants- actually end up helping the boy understand what it's like being the size of an ant and having to deal with the many struggles and the enormous hardships of survival that an ant has to endure on a daily basis.  Well not ALL the ants want to help the boy learn the errors of his ways.  For a while it would seem they'd all like nothing more than to trap and kill the boy, however the one female ant actually feels sorry for the boy and wants to help change him into a more respectful and compassionate person.

The story mainly focuses around the adventure that the boy takes the ants on by exploring the grassy lands and avoiding the obstacles in his own yard, so in a way this is like an animated version of Honey I Shrunk the Kids.  You will actually see all the obstacles that ants have to face concerning their predators.  My favorite being the frogs!  WOW, suddenly frogs don't look so innocent and helpless to me anymore, haha!  Let's just say, they have tongues of steel!  Remember this is all done playfully for the kids who are watching the film.

Overall, a terrific story with some pretty clever segments (such as the one where the boy and the ants wonder how to get across the carpet in the living room and decide to use flower petals and glide into a fan, which would blow them across the room).  I highly recommend it.",1333065600,,2288,4.388625592417061
2660829,4,B000ION23A,"Movies like The Ant Bully make people like me, who have never lived in the U.S, get some insight into their culture. Technology, science, literature, food etc are elements the sum of which is Culture. There was a time when In...dians used to tell tales of emotion, propriety, balance, repect-for-nature etc through parables like the Jatak Kathaiyan (Jataka Tales). This is what The Ant Bully does and in a contemporary way. The idea itself, where we are made to realise that we must respect nature and that even the tiniest living beings can teach us much and can sensitise us to their and our own needs, is universal and connects immediately with people across borders and age groups. The quality of animation is respectable. The dialogues are tight and the situations exciting.",1329436800,,779,4.909090909090909
2660830,5,B000ION23A,"My grandsons are both autistic, and fast paced movies usually keep their attention better than the rest.  For some reason, Ant Bully has captivated my little audience and as many times as they have seen it, they want to see it more and more.  The story is about a little boy who is bullied by the ""big kid"" in the neighborhood and after he is picked on, he turns his anger towards the ants in the yard.  The ants wind up teaching him that he can do anything he wants to do, and being small makes no difference.  My older grandson loves the part where he finds out what he is eating, and what he thought was a feast, is actually the remains of what a caterpillar has eaten for breakfast. He also enjoys grandma losing her teeth, and he looks at me after she drops her teeth in the drain and in the yard every time.  We both laugh because he knows that it can happen to me too.  Its a fun story for all, including grandma.  The cast is: Julia Roberts as Hova; Nicolas Cage as Zoc; Meryl Streep as Queen; Paul Giamatti as Stan Beals and Zack Tyler as Lucas Nickle (Peanut).

I would think since I paused it for 10 min in beginning to make sure everyone had popcorn and stuff that it would have spooled to the HD on the DVD player (which is 400 gig) but for some reason it did not do much of that and seemed to rely on data flow.

2660845,4,B000ION23A,"Talking insects make for good computer generated animation.  Pixar knew this (A Bug's Life), Dreamworks knew it (Antz and the Bee Movie), and it hasn't escaped the attention of Tom Hanks either.

Boasting an 83-minute runtime, the Ant Bully wastes very little time setting up its plot.

This is essentially the story of a ten-year-old boy named Lucas Nickle, who, because of his small stature, finds himself the target for the local bully and his cronies.

When he discovers that his parents are leaving for a honeymoon in Puerto Vallarta, Lucas finds himself under the supervision of his techno-happy older sister and their UFO-obsessed grandmother.

Because he is powerless to stand up for himself, Lucas finds himself taking out his frustration on an anthill in his front yard; water guns, hoses, firecrackers, Lucas' tormenting means doom for the terrified ants occupying the hill.

It turns out the anthill's resident wizard Zoc has devised a risky plan that could potentially shrink ""The Destroyer"" down to the size of the ants so that he could be tried properly for his crimes against the colony.

The adventure really begins when rather than sentence the now pint-sized human boy to prison; the ant counsel decides he is to experience the difficulties of daily life as an ant.  In the process, Lucas discovers that the things he wants most out of life: friendship, companionship, and the courage to stand up for himself have been at his disposal all along.  And more important still, that size is no measurement of strength.

Naturally it's quite impossible to even encounter this film without being mentally drawn back to the early days of computer-animated blockbusters like A Bug's Life and Antz.  And indeed nearly a decade of advancements in technology separating this film from the former two doesn't seem to have been as kind to the Ant Bully as it has been to some of the projects coming out of Pixar or Dreamworks.  However, what the Ant Bully does have going for it is a decent story that adults can enjoy while the kids marvel at the spectacle of life as seen from the perspective of a human no bigger than an ant.

While calling it gut-busting humorous would certainly be giving the writing a bit too much credit, there are no shortage of sequences that manage to generate a genuine chuckle from viewers of all ages (my own personal giggle-heavy moment arrives when Lucas detonates a firecracker that to him is the size of a school bus).

Though it's not made overly known in the marketing material, the film is actually the result of Tom Hanks' adoration for the children's book of the same name by John Nickel.

Voice work is especially genuine throughout with Julia Roberts giving a very uncharacteristic (natural) performance and Nicolas Cage walking the thin line between a character you either despise or sort of don't hate.

In all there's little doubt that the Ant Bully failed to generate the type of spark for Warner Brothers that would make Disney/ Pixar, Dreamworks, or Blue Sky stutter but the blame can hardly be placed on the film itself for that.  This is 89-minutes worth of fun family-oriented entertainment with some solid morals about life forming the foundation of the whimsy at hand.  The fact that the DVD contains 7 additional animated shorts, some of which are truly pretty humorous, is the icing on the cake.",1283558400,2,3354,4.8543859649122805
2660846,4,B000ION23A,It's one of those great animated movies that's entertaining for kids to watch and for adults when they get all the humor that's meant for them.

2660847,2,B000ION23A,"We've seen plenty of CGI-animated films that involve talking ants (Antz, A Bug's Life). The Ant Bully is the most recent one, released back in 2006, and I have to say that it's the weakest of them all. Not to say that it's incredibly bad, but it's still pretty mediocre. The good things about this film are the ants themselves: I found myself admiring their personalities and even their appearances. The animation looks good in some corners, and the orchestral score sounds great, even if it isn't very memorable. I especially like the lack of pop culture references that are typically found in today's CGI-animated films. Unfortunately, these things aren't enough to save the film. The story is predictable (even kids will probably figure out how it all ends), the human supporting characters are dull, the main character (the kid) is an especially unbelievable bore, and the jokes are very VERY stale. Like I said, it's not a terrible film, but it's not a good one either. This one is just below mediocre.

The animation is great, and the story too has a lot to recommend it. The story centers around a young boy, Lucas [Zach Tyler] who is constantly being bullied by an older and bigger neighborhood bully. Lucas in turn vents his anger and frustration on the ant colony in his yard. Typical of animated movies, the ants can 'talk' - there's Zoc [Nicolas Cage] a sort of ant wizard who experiments with a shrinking potion, his girlfriend Hova [Julia Roberts] who believes that ""Peanut the Destroyer"" aka Lucas is good at heart and that humans and ants can co-exist in peace. Lucas inevitably gets shrunk to ant size [well, a little smaller actually] and is sentenced by the Queen [Meryl Streep] to live and work in the ant colony, learning to 'become' an ant with the hope that Lucas will learn compassion. Over the course of the movie, Lucas learns that ants too have 'feelings' and that his actions of bullying the ants was not justified in any way - in fact, Lucas comes to form a real friendship with the ants.

What I didn't like about it was the gratuitous rude and uncivil dialogue between the characters which I felt was in poor taste and a very poor example for kids.  I would not show it to my grandkids, as they learn from movies and videos and I would not want them to emulate the attitudes expressed by the characters. There are already too much iresponsible and negative attitudes expressed on TV. I am amazed that Tom Hanks and the other Hollywood actors got involved in this cheap take off on ""Ants.""

It is affecting his life and making him feel miserable. To relieve his stress, he has been taking it out on an ant colony in his front yard.  Well, one night the ant's decide to turn the tables, and he is shrunk by magic to the size of an ant, and has to live with them to earn his way back to full size.

""The Ant Bully"" popped up in my New Releases category, so it got dropped in my queue without much thought or expectation.

What a complete surprise!  The child *adored* this movie, and the writing is witty enough that I can watch it repeatedly.  And by repeatedly, I mean over and over and over....  *sigh*

The more I watch, and so far we're up to eight times (ish), the more Bruce Campbell's character steals the movie for me.  Knowing the dialogue word-for-word hasn't diminished the humor yet, and I doubt more viewings will either.

I absolutely recommend this movie for children.  I didn't hear anything inappropriate from Nicholas Cage's character - he does have a very menacing ant-face once, but for the most part he's just an anxious and  neurotic ant.  Perfect casting...

It was a very enjoyable film, and one I'm going to be buying once I finish saving for my computer. The animation was nice, but this is coming from somebody who didn't bother with the movie ""ANTZ"". The perspective is nothing new.

It was a nice tale, decent-quailty animation and a cute story. Some gross-out humor (ANOTHER 'false teeth' joke? How many do we need?!) and minor language, but nothing too bad that I caught.

2660950,3,B000ION23A,"Warner Brothers presents CG animation film ""The Ant Bully"" based on John Nickle's book of the same title, co-produced by Tom Hanks. The film also features the voices of Julia Roberts, Nicholas Cage, Meryl Streep, Paul Giamatti and Bruce Campbell. Few films can attract these talents and my expectation level was high by knowing these names, even though the new film's story unfolds against the background of a colony of ants - just like Dreamwork's ""Antz"" and Pixar's ""A Bug's Life.""

I have finished watching the film and my impression is this: the film is OK, but nothing great and the current status of Pixar as trend-setting company will not change for the next few years. I am not saying ""The Ant Bully"" is bad. Its visual world, especially the images seen from an ant's perspective, is impressive and its ""Star Wars""-like battle scenes are both unique and exciting to see. Computer graphic technology has advanced more than we had expected back in 1998 when ""A Bug's Life"" was released.

But the same cannot be said about the script of the new film as ""The Ant Bully"" borrows so many elements from other films, animated or live-action. OK, ""A Bug's Life"" is virtually a remake of Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai,"" but the details are totally different with originality. John A. Davis (""Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius"") keeps the ball rolling with the adventures of Lucas, a boy called ""The Destroyer"" by poor ants, because he demolishes the ant hills. Shrunken, the boy has to learn a lesson or two, but the messages come with mildly gross humor and certain amount of goo, without which, I believe, they could have made a great family-oriented film.

""The Ants Bully"" is an amusing and entertaining family picture. I know this sounds like clich, but the film is good, but not great.",1173830400,,1777,4.800653594771242

2660954,5,B000ION23A,"Fantastic.  The Ant Bully is just a fantastic animated film on multiple levels.  The animation is superb, the characters are wonderfully memorable, the cast of voice actors boasts many a big name, and the story is as educational as it is entertaining.  Adults should have already learned the message of this film, but they can still enjoy The Ant Bully just as much as the kids.  Frankly, I had never even heard of this movie until a couple of weeks ago, and that's a real shame because this is an animated film that should have been talked about just as much as Cars, Happy Feet, etc.

Like Lucas (Zach Tyler), the little boy in this film, I used to squirt water on ants and destroy their little ant hills - I'm not proud of that, but I was just a dumb kid.  Lucas has yet to learn that tormenting other creatures is bad.  A local bully keeps picking on him because he's little, so he turns around and picks on ants because he is bigger than they are.  For their part, the ants in his front yard have had enough of the horrible beast they call ""Destroyer,"" and thanks to a young wizard named Zoc (Nicolas Cage), they have a way to fight back.  Using a potion, they shrink Lucas down to their size and carry him back to the colony.  Many of the ants want to kill and eat their nemesis, but the benevolent Queen (Meryl Streep) decrees that he is to remain in the colony and, through training, learn to become an ant himself.  Zoc's girlfriend Hova (Julia Roberts) eagerly volunteers to train him, which threatens to drive a wedge between her and Zoc.

Lucas makes for a stubborn student, rejecting the teamwork inherent in ant society; he doesn't need anybody's help, thank you very much.  Not having any human friends, he is even reluctant to accept the friendship that ants such as Hova offer him.  When the colony finds itself in danger, though - particularly when The Cloudbreather shows up to exterminate the lawn - Lucas sees the error of his ways, begins to understand how important friends are in life, and even goes so far as to risk his own life to protect those around him.  It's hard for a child to realize that a ""me first"" philosophy won't get you very far in life, and The Ant Bully communicates that very important lesson in a wonderful, expressive way.  While most animated films play strictly for laughs, The Ant Bully uses comedy to reinforce one of life's most important lessons.  Yes, there's an element of socialism in it all (and heaven knows how much I hate socialism), but the true message of the film is a good and proper one.

I love this film's animation and cinematography.  The attention to detail is amazing; for example, it would have been all too easy to just give the ants plain white eyes, but these animators went the extra mile to make their ants' eyes reflect the convexity of real ants' compound eyes.  In terms of the cinematography, I found myself thinking back to some of the epic battle scenes from the original Star Wars trilogy as the ants rushed to defend their base from an aerial assault by wasps.  I also loved the scene where the view pulled way back for a dramatic ant-sized explosion, only to show - from a human perspective - the very modest poof of a little firecracker.  That doesn't sound like much, but I thought it was brilliant.  In fact, I thought this entire movie was brilliant.  And wait - there's more.  You also get to hear the great Ricardo Montalban and Bruce Campbell lend their voices to a couple of characters, as well.  Wow!  What else could you ask for?  Truly, The Ant Bully is one of the best animated films I've seen in some time.",1172188800,8,3604,4.469418960244648

2660998,4,B000ION23A,"Before watching this movie, I thought it would be some sort of rehash of Antz or A Bug's Life.  In fact, it was totally different, with a unique and very original storyline.  Lucas Nickle is the protagonist, the new kid on the block who gets roughed up by Steve, the neighborhood bully.  He takes out his anger on the anthill in his yard, subjecting them to kicks, sprays from the lawn hose, and the dreaded ""yellow rain"".  But what goes around comes around as the ants' wizard, Zoc, concocts a potion that shrinks Lucas down to size.  He is taken to the ant colony, and forced to live with the ants until he learns their ways.  At first reluctant, Lucas soon gets in a groove and his training culminates in his saviour of the colony.  For this he is rewarded with an ant name, the complete adulation of the colony, and a return to his original size.

There are several aspects of the movie worth commenting.  First, the look of the ants is quite similar to the 1990's movie Antz.  Second, the CGI is pretty impressive and all the scenery, animals and people look realistic enough.  Third, there is a fair amount of action, but little violence, so the movie is appropriate for all ages.  Fourth, the comedy is subtle and clean.

When the Wizard of the ant community comes up with a portion to shrink Lucas and it is decided he must learn how to live like an ant the fun begins.  Lucas soon learns that working together can help you overcome no matter what size you are.  It was just a really fun movie and one that my entire family enjoyed.

The wedgies are so fierce they rip his underwear, and he's running out of underwear.  But he always has the anthill he can take his frustrations out on.  Until the night the ant wizard Zoc makes a potion that shrinks him down to ant-size.  Then Lucas has to learn what it's like to life an ant's life or he's never going to get back home.

Nicholas Cage, Julia Roberts, Meryl Streep, Bruce Campbell, and Zach Tyler lend their voices to the character.  The movie was based on a book by John Nickle.

Besides the adventure and the fantasy of being inside an anthill, THE ANT BULLY offers a lot to think about when it comes to being part of a community.  Lucas's challenges make him think, but they also make young viewers think as well.  In addition, the fast pacing and humorous bits will keep young viewers glued to the television until the end of the movie.

A video game was released at the time the movie came out, and some of the gameplay mechanics are obviously inserted in the movie.  Young fans won't know this, but for us old enough to figure things out, we see it easily (such has the hang-gliding from fan to fan sequence).

In this horrible and weak creative market that Hollywood has become, it's common place to forget movies these days, moments after watching them. You got the so, so's and the seen it a hundred times, the capitalizing off trend movies, the talentless talk of the town startlet movies, the kids want fart jokes movies and the hey, I'm independent and I'm cool movies and then there's movies like the ANT BULLY.

It's been two or three weeks now and I still think about THE ANT BULLY. It wasn't perfect. The animation doesn't quite reach the quality of PIXAR, but this movie was the perfect combination of childlike humor and adult coolness. Not to mention, it taps into that childlike innocence that we all can relate to.

You can relate to the bored kid destroying the ant hill in his yard. You laugh at the subtle humor as the ants cry with KATRINA DISASTER desperation as they ponder the fact that it'll take them a WHOLE DAY to rebuild everything. You smile as the Ants CRAVE and cherish the colored rocks (jellybeans) like they're the holy grail.

Yet, it's the effectiveness of the camera shots and the humor that grabbed me. Particularly the shots of the dramatic scene unfolding as Lucas lights the firecracker in an attempt to blow up the attacking wasps... a huge explosion is coming... and it cuts to a wide shot of the yard... and a distant, faint pop and a small cloud of smoke. Also, the whole entire avoid the frog and escape from the frogs scenario was awesome. The wasps were cool too... almost... StarWarsish?

Although I think it's the whole ANT BULLY package that had me feeling like a kid again, and for the first time in a long time, there was a movie that I remembered and thought about weeks later.",1165190400,4,1876,4.522123893805309
2661039,1,B000ION23A,"At what point in man's progress did bratty behavior in children become the standard by which all are measured and parents became bumbling idiots who need aforementioned brats to save them from themselves and their stupidity? Also, when did cartoon movies (semantics aside) come so fast and furious and so maddeningly short on originality? If you want more evidence of the monkey see monkey do dilemma killing Hollywood, I submit:  Madagascar vs. The Wild.

Enter this movie. First of all, are there no other insects that behave socially? Was a third movie featuring ants really necessary? Do bees demand more at the negotiating table?

As for the brats, the ""star"" of this waste of time is a bullied pain in the rear who deserves nothing but the grief he dishes out with such glee and malevolence. He never really apologizes with anything approaching sincerity and the lesson he learns (being a brat isn't always a good idea) is one I think he's should've learned long before. This punk gets beat up by the local thugs, so he then decides he needs to take his pent-up anger out on ants until they shrink him down to size to teach him a lesson. Whatever.

The last problem with this garbage is the actors who provide the voices. Some actors have the dynamics to really bring life to cartoons. Nicholas Cage is not one of these actors. I really like Cage's work, but his voice is monotonous, death to voiceover work. Ditto for Julia Roberts. I'm sorry, but if you're not getting folks like Eddie Murphy, Robin Williams, Ellen DeGeneres, e.g., then you're wasting everybody's time. Even the omnipresent Owen Wilson in this year's best (although still far from the mark) cartoon movie ""Cars"" has more vocal range than Cage or Roberts.

This is a bad movie with no redeeming message, no heartwarming moments, no comedy, and no creativity. There is only one good bug movie, so do yourself and your family a favor and pull ""A Bug's Life"" out of closet and watch it instead.",1165017600,9,1966,4.720116618075802

The story is one of friendship and setting your moral priorities in the correct order. It's a nice family film with the all important adult-asides. But nothing too grown up that kids would pick up on.

The picture is just awesome; this computer generated animation is amazing to see on a high-def TV. It's almost 3D. Unbelievable.

The voice-cast is terrific. I went into The Ant Bully without reading in advance who did the voices, and I'm glad that I did; it made it more fun. I'm about to say who did the voices so if you don't want that spoiled skip to my next paragraph. Ya ready? Okay...What a surprise to see in the rolling credits that Julia Roberts was Hova. I wasn't sure, but I thought throughout that Zoc was Tom Hanks (who was actually a producer for The Ant Bully); I was wrong. Zoc was indeed Nicholas Cage. And perhaps my biggest surprise was that Fugax wasn't Tom Arnold...it was Bruce Campbell! (If you don't know who Bruce is, let's just say he's the star of a famous Sam Raimi [Spiderman] directed, cult, not-for-kids flick on my Amazon Listmania List of ""15 Flicks Guaranteed To Leave A Permanent Impression"".)

Another cool trivia tidbit from The Ant Bully: Listen to the sound played in the background as Zoc marches towards Lucas' bedroom to deliver the diabolical potion. Did you recognize that sound? If not, you're too young or I'm too old. It was the sound that the ants made when in attack mode in 1954's classic giant ant attack movie (starring James Whitmore) THEM!

Oh yes, and the last bit of trivia...the 13 CGI movies of 2006: Cars, The Wild, Happy Feet, Doogal, Open Season, Monster House, Chicken Little, Barnyard, Over the Hedge, The Ant Bully, Hoodwinked, Ice Age 2 & Flushed Away.

But the overkill of computer animation in 2006 should not sway anyone into missing The Ant Bully; it is #1 or #2 of all 13 with the other top runner being Ice Age 2. Shame on Warner Brothers for not marketing this excellent children's book turned animated feature film better.

2661041,5,B000ION23A,"While other reviewers weren't as fond of this as me, I found this little film to be charmingly delightful and entertaining, perhaps my favorite animated movie of this year.  Sure, the message is heavyhanded and sentimental, but isn't that what these kind of films is supposed to do?  And what a voice cast:  Nicolas Cage, Meryl Streep, Lily Tomlin, Julia Roberts, Paul Giamatti, Ricardo Montalban...hey, that's top notch casting.  I was fascinated by the unity of the ant kingdom and how hard it was for The Destroyer, Peanut, to fit into their social patterns, but with deft plotting and key scenes, it all works out in the end.

I think the family would find this delightful holiday viewing.",1164931200,5,693,4.838983050847458
2661042,4,B000ION23A,"Some might complain that the lead wasn't likeable because he started out as a bitter kid who picked on ants, but I thought the pecking order shown in the beginning where Lucas did unto ants (and less obviously, his mum) as the bully did unto him was true to human, especially kid, nature. Maybe I'm a bad person but I recall that when the most popular kids teased me when I was younger, I'd take it out on kids who had even fewer friends than me. Teaming up with those kids and standing up to my original bullies might've been more productive, but my excuse is that this movie didn't exist to teach me that. Speaking of the message, I thought the lowbrow humour offset some of the preach factor that the message could've brought about. With jokes like that I didn't feel like it was written by a teacher, or at least not by a stuffy teacher but by the fun teacher who made gross jokes to win me over, then once he earned my attention, taught me something.",1163808000,7,955,4.311111111111111
