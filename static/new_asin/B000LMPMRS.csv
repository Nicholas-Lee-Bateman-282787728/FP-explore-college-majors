8286153,4,B000LMPMRS,"I used to love this movie as a kid. I had it recorded from tv onto a VHS tape as a kid and one day I went to watch it and my mom had taped a Miss America pageant over it. Anyway, I was excited to find this online. Good quality, my only issue that every once in a while words flash along the bottom of the screen that say ""for screening purposes only."" It's not horrible which is why I only bumped it down one star because the quality/audio is still good. Glad I found this and was able to add it to my collection.",1367452800,,513,3.849056603773585
