I understand that some people want to watch different, non-cookie-cutter movies, but that doesn't mean any crappy over-acted indie film is considered automatically good.

One star for a unique story - kudos to the writer. Other than that -

This was painful to watch. These actors really need to take some classes and improve their ""skill.""",1361491200,,461,4.961038961038961
8358366,1,B0029WLJE8,"One reviewer said this reminded her of a ""low low budget version of the television series Pushing Daisies ...because of the deadpan acting and odd dialog."" That's a pretty good description, leaving out the distorted, misguided attempt to reference Greek and/or Roman mythology by naming the characters Achilles, Persephone, Antigone, etc. Not one part of the story (what little there is) even remotely resembles anything from mythology. Weird, nearly unwatchable, I finished it only so I could legitimately review it here. It doesn't even deserve one star, let alone five. Watch at your own risk!",1358726400,3,596,5.28421052631579

I really enjoyed watching that movie.
A must see.",1267488000,,130,5.238095238095238
8358368,4,B0029WLJE8,"Enjoyed this film a lot. Good performances, characters, storyline, music...
The film has a nice look to it.  Just a fun and entertaining movie.
I highly recommend it.",1252713600,3,166,4.928571428571429
8358369,5,B0029WLJE8,"This is one of the better movies that I have seen in a long time. It was refreshingly different and unpredicatable. Each actor gave their character a uniqueness to the story. I highly recommend this to people that are sick of
carbon copy movies that are so overly rated. This is film making at it's best.
""The Watermelon"" is definately a 5 star movie.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Watermelon/dp/B0029WLJE8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Watermelon</a>",1249948800,5,495,6.294117647058823
