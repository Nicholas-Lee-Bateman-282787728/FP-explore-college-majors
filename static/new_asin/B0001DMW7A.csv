1992045,5,B0001DMW7A,"Based on Nobel laureate Henryk Sienkiewicz's trilogy, this TV mini-series recounts a fictionalized but fundamentally accurate story set during the mid-seventeenth-century rebellion of the Cossacks and Ukraine (literally ""outland"") against the arrogant and selfish Polish nobility.  The rebels had no beef with the Polish king or the Polish people, just the nobles--after all, many Ukrainians were originally Polish serfs who escaped from their cruel overlords.  The central character unknowingly rescues the rebels' general and is thereupon entitled to the general's favor in rescuing his fiancee from a vicious killer.  Within about 150 years, the nobles having sold their own people down the river, Poland was gobbled up by Russia, Prussia, and Austria and ceased to exist as an independent nation.
If you don't know Polish, make sure you get a subtitled version to avoid disappointment.

1992046,4,B0001DMW7A,"I was very disappointed when I first received this DVD. Because I was not able to access the sub-titles. Due to my annoyance I sent a frustrated review to Polart Video Inc. not expecting to get a response.

Not only did I recieve a response I also received step by step directions on how to access the sub-titles and a follow up inquiry. Needless to say I was impressed. Although I only liked With Fire and Sword, My family loved it (5  Stars) now they want parts 3&4. Please let me know when additional parts of this story will be available on DVD.",1376179200,5,549,4.320388349514563
1992047,5,B0001DMW7A,"A very great movie, one of the best I,ve seen in a long time,  I only wished I had brought the theatre version as with this one the starts of each section were over written in the titles.",1374192000,,187,3.9210526315789473

1992049,5,B0001DMW7A,"This is an epic in the true sense of the word that is it has a cast of thousands, a sprawling tale of love, war and intrigue with a healthy smattering of humour for good measure. It starts in an uneasy Poland of 1647 where the peace is a fragile one with neighbouring countries including Russia, the Ukraine and the Tartars. A disgruntled nobleman defects to the Cossacks to induce rebellion thanks to the hapless intervention of a noble lieutenant, the dashing Jan Skrzetuski (Michal Zebrowski). As Jan makes his merry way back to the prince he comes across a damsel in distress the smouldering Izabella Scorupco playing Princess Helena. Well after a few sensuous looks and an impromptu dance they both fall head over heels in love.

But oh dear her matriarchal guardian has promised her hand (and a few other bits) to the conniving Jurko Bohun who will stop at nothing to get her back. Then whispers of war grow ever louder as the Cossacks make their move to invade a besieged Mother land and the clash of nations is al but inevitable.

This is a sumptuous production, actually made in 1999 with no discernable CGI but brilliant battle scenes, sieges, cavalry charges and impaling. It is not a blood fest though as there are so many mini adventures going on in this 175 minutes of a film.

It is really called `Ogniem I Mieczem' (`With fire and sword') and was a four part made for TV production. Just to let you know that not everything is translated but generally the sub titles seem to be very good. However even a minor irritant like that could not stop me ruddy well loving this film, it has everything including heart brake and a lot of alcohol consumption, so if a vodka infused historical romp of a film is your thing, you should love this.",1362096000,6,1750,4.549206349206349
1992050,1,B0001DMW7A,Description said it was for region 1 but it was in some other language. this is the third dvd I received from Amazon in the same order. I have purchases many dvd's from Amazon and this is the first time this has happened. I should have returned them but I didn't.,1355097600,,263,4.176470588235294
1992071,5,B0001DMW7A,"I agree with the five stars reviews being given to this product, simply a great DVD .  I have read Sienkiewicz book, the basis of this movie, and find it very true to the key portions of the book. Captures the majesty and sorrow of this long neglected significant event in history.

Besides my pleasure with the DVD, I can't say enough positive about the company supplying the DVD.  One of the initial DVDs I received in the two volume set had a defect.  I will not go into details I had with contacting the company, but let me say that this is by far one of the best companies I have dealt with in the many years I have purchased items through AMAZON. PolartVideoUSA, the supplier through AMAZON is 5 star.  AMAZON needs to ensure that their other marketplace suppliers can ""measure-up"" to this companies customer service.",1339545600,2,823,4.533783783783784
1992072,5,B0001DMW7A,"A great movie with great actors, lots of action and a love triangle thrown in, most of the main characters in the movie were real historical people.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/With-Fire-and-Sword/dp/0020820445/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">With Fire and Sword</a>",1332633600,4,302,8.181818181818182
1992073,5,B0001DMW7A,"A great film epic from Poland, based on a famous novel by Nobel laureate Henryk Sienwiewicz, taking the 17th Century Ukrainian uprising by Bogdan Khmelnitsky against the Polish Commonwealth as a background, with Poles, Ukrainians and Tatars fighting against each other. My knowledge of Polish history is weak, so I cannot tell how faithful this movie is to the real events it depicts, but as an epic it never fails to entertain. Since this is a Polish film, Poles come naturally the best. Some may complain that the Ukrainian Cossacks are depicted as ignorant brutes, but they are nonetheless great fun to watch. Worst depicted are the Crimean Tatars, as oriental despots (and pederasts, as well, since the Khan is shown as an obvious boy lover). Though this was one of the most expensive films in Polish history, it took just small change to made in comparison with similarly themed Western movies, and the results for the money are impressive. The battles depicted here are great, and the filmmakers took care to involve many people in them, not just a few (presumably, without any aid from computer imagery). There is a great acting, as well (Izabella Scorupco as the beautiful Helena, Alexandr Domogarov as the impulsive Bohun, Ruslana Pysanka as the witch Horpyna, Krzystof Kowalewski as the comic relief Zagluba).",1322956800,4,1319,5.0
1992074,4,B0001DMW7A,"At the time of its release in 1999, With Fire and Sword (Ogniem i mieczem) was the highest budgeted movie in the history of Polish cinema. Directed by Jerzy Hoffman, the film is based upon the first book of Henryk Sienkiewicz's famous and historic Trilogy. Hoffman had already adapted the last two books, Colonel Wolodyjowski/Fire in the Steppe (Pan Wolodyjowski, 1968) and The Deluge (Potop, 1974).

In With Fire and Sword we follow dashing, young Polish officer, Jan Skrzetuski (Michal Zebrowski), as he joins in the fight against the rebellious Zaporozhian Cossacks under the command of Hetman Bohdan Chmielnicki. He meets gorgeous Helena (Izabella Scorupco) and falls instantly in love but must contend with his rival for her affection, the crafty Cossack, Jurko Bohan, played by the talented Alesandr Domogarov. The fight over the stunningly beautiful Helena is set amidst various battles of the Uprising.

After drop-dead gorgeous, Polish actress, Izabella Scorupco, starred in the James Bond flick, Golden Eye (1995), we all expected big things from her. Very sadly, her career never really did pan out. Let's face it, beautiful Polish woman are a dime a dozen, like grains of sand on the beach. But Bialystok-born Izabella was one of those exquisite Polish beauties that literally took a man's breath away. With Fire and Sword was her first film following Golden Eye.

Comic relief is provided by Pan Zagloba, one of Polish literature's most comic characters, portrayed with uproarious effect by Krzysztof Kowalewski. Andrzej Seweryn gives a memorable performance as Polish prince, Jarema Wisniowiecki.

I enjoyed this movie very much. Polish Americans will especially appreciate the 17th century Polish costumes and settings. The Polish cavalry charges do become a bit redundant after awhile but it is quite something to see the winged hussars in action. This isn't a 5-star film but it's close. Of the three Trilogy films, this one is, by far, the best.

Ukrainians objected to With Fire and Sword, saying it portrayed them in a less than flattering manner. For the Ukrainian take on the Uprising, check out Taras Bulba starring Yul Brynner and Cossack-with-a-Brooklyn-accent, Tony Curtis.

English translations of Sienkiewicz's Trilogy are available at major libraries. You will definitely want to read this patriotic classic for yourself. The movie's good but the book is a masterpiece. Helpful hint: Kuniczak's translations are much easier to read than Curtin's.",1278028800,2,2475,5.301020408163265
1992075,5,B0001DMW7A,"Wow! Rebelling Cossack and Tartar hordes vie with winged hussars for the fate of Poland in this extraordinary movie. Throw in a beautiful damsel in distress, a manly, emotionally charged protagonist, and complexly characterized antagonists and you have the mix for an extraordinary movie. With Fire and Sword has the narrative sweep and costumed sumptuousness of the great historic film epics along with the imagery one expects from world class cinema.
  With Fire and Sword is Henryk Sienkiewicz's vast and wonderful novel of the brewing crises of 17th Century Poland that eventually destroyed the Polish state.  Director Jerzy Hoffman has distilled this sprawling work into a compelling, fast paced dramatic work.
  Some reviewers have noted the ""cross talk"" feature, which can be distracting on a very few occasions.  I believe what is happening is that the Ukrainian characters are speaking in Ukrainian while a narrator repeats what they are saying in Polish.  Perhaps, if one could follow the original dialog in Polish this feature may be annoying. Relying solely on the English subtitles, it seemed to add an even greater sense of authenticity for me.",1267142400,,1158,5.227027027027027
1992076,4,B0001DMW7A,"I have been looking forward for years to see this screen version of Sienkiewicz's classic book. The movie version follows the story line of ""With Fire and Sword"" very honestly but leaves out a lot of the filler material. I am a bit dissapointed with the production in the sense that the battle scenes seem so sparsely populated after reading the novel. I guess that computor enhancement was not available to it's production crew. This was great Polish history but on a reduced scale.",1260748800,2,483,4.761904761904762
1992077,1,B0001DMW7A,"Very disappointed by this two disc version.
1. They divided it into a 4 part screen play which doesn't flow as well as the movie
2. The subtitles often miss out part or are one sided so you miss what one character is saying completely.
3. There is a strange voice over some parts repeating what the characters just said in a monotone voice that completely ruins the movie and there is no way to turn it off.

This is a fantastic movie and one of my all time favourites, but steer clear of this version. Try to get the dual layer disc that has all the characters on the front cover.",1201564800,15,581,4.1875
1992078,5,B0001DMW7A,"Yes, the DVD transfer could have been better.  I don't really care.  If a little graininess is the price we must pay for having the enjoyment of this film, then so be it.  It's a miracle that this sprawling, brutal epic --- the most expensive in the history of Polish cinema --- was made in the first place.  Reasonably faithful to both Sienkiewicz' work and the history of the Zaporozhye Uprising, this features good production values, excellent acting, and unforgettable characters.  Plus, it does justice to a great story!  For anyone who enjoys historical epics, this should be near the top of the list of must-see films.",1182988800,9,625,4.794392523364486
1992079,5,B0001DMW7A,"You hear often of how much Hollywood pays for screenplays and adaptations of popular work, but it seems that many times they overlook the most obvious source of magnificent drama which is history. With Fire and Sword was shown in Chicago back in 1999 and I always regretted missing it. Fortunately, I was able to catch the quick moving period piece the other day. The battles between the Poles and the Cossacks were riveting and spurred me to do a little research about author Henryk Sienkiewicz. As always, however, I loved seeing the beauty of the winged hussars charge into battle--a sight artfully recreated in With Fire and Sword. One's interest is piqued every time a horseman makes an appearance. It's hard not to root for the Ruthenians, and the love story makes the need for their victory all the more compelling. Overall, this is definitely a needed changeup for the mainstream viewer who has grown tired of Hollywood's schlock. I highly recommend it.",1171929600,19,961,4.865853658536586
1992080,5,B0001DMW7A,"A very good film characterized by marvelous acting, a very good soundtrack, and maybe more historical realism than some audiences are ready for.  The story takes place in 17th century Poland in the midst of the Polish-Zaporojan war.  There is a romance set against the backdrop of hostility between the Poles and the Cossacks.  An otherwise serious tale is offset by various humorous interludes (mostly centred around the supporting character of Sir Zagloba).  Excellent historical fiction.",1169078400,17,490,5.407894736842105
