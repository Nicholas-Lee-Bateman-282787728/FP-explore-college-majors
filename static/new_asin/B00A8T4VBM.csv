has so much to offer.",1358380800,2,109,4.0
8548458,5,B00A8T4VBM,Sad to see how the fading of Buddhism has affected the older generation. I would hope the younger generation would benefit from this.,1496534400,,133,4.826086956521739

8548461,5,B00A8T4VBM,"Great documentary of the evolution of Japanese Buddhism in Hawaii. The archival film footage and photos are priceless. My grandparents and their kids actually worked the sugar cane fields in Hakalau. I never realized the extent of their hardships. They never talked about it. Too bad that they passed a few years ago, as they would have enjoyed this film, especially with the Japanese subtitles. Very natsukashii.",1430870400,,413,5.17910447761194
8548462,5,B00A8T4VBM,"Great documentary on the history of Buddhism in Hawaii. Covering its arrival to present day challenges and directions. If you're a Buddhist out here or just restrained in part of Hawaii's heritage, it's well worth the watch.",1425254400,,224,5.081081081081081

8548466,4,B00A8T4VBM,"Part of the video could be more polished.  However, it is a well done documentary on the history of Buddhism in Hawaii.  It was almost too late to capture some of the early history. It is a wake up call to Buddhists as the documentary describes its decline.",1377734400,,257,4.333333333333333
8548467,5,B00A8T4VBM,"Great video on the history and evolution of Buddhism in Hawaii.

Just got back from Japan and my Japanese friends and relatives do say that Buddhism is for funerals and Shinto is for the happy events in life.  Sure is different from the way Buddhism has developed in Hawaii.

I would recommend this video to anyone who is interested in Buddhism in Hawaii - it's history, it's current state and possible future.",1375401600,,410,4.666666666666667
