8118220,5,B000F6ZD1U,I probably gave this a star too many because I am from St. Louis and the Wabash system was a big part of our railroad history.  That and the greatest railroad song ever written make the Wabash Cannonball my favorite train of all time.  If you are from the east or west you might disagree.,1350864000,,288,4.218181818181818
8118221,5,B000F6ZD1U,"An excellent show tracing the history of the ""Wabash Railroad"".  Many interviews with former ""Wabash employees"", ""Historians/Authors"", and members of the ""Wabash Railroad Historical Society"".  Some rare film footage also included.  Good action shots of the Wabash F7 #1189 locomotive at the Monticello Railway Museum.  Very nice show!",1296604800,,334,5.895833333333333
