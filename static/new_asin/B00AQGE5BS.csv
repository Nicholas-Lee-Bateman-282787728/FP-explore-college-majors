5470961,5,B00AQGE5BS,This series has the added bonus in the second and third seasons of having a menu which can be bought down on the side of the screen and tell you pertinent fact about a scene and how it relates to the story line as well as family history and map locations.  I don't use it all the time but it is nice to have when I do need  it.,1401840000,3,327,3.7246376811594204
5470962,1,B00AQGE5BS,"Create enough families to write about for infinity, pad your bank accounts, and please the masses who, heaven forbid, want to ""THINK"" . . . and further promote the death of true literature. There you have it! This is the fodder that creates ""REALITY TELEVISION"". A soap opera by any other name is still a soap opera despite the eloaborate trappings. Those characters the public want to see saved and those they wish to see demised become the despised saved and the beloved kill in the next episode, providing the viewers with more desire to see the liked saved and the despised killed ad infinitum.
What a load of crap camouflaged by tits and ass when nothing else will work to occupy the fans attention.
Listen. What's that? Did I just hear Faulkner moan and turn over in his grave? Did Conrad just take a bicarb for stomach upset? I believe these authors and the others who cared more about the human conditon rather than gladatorial mentality would never stand a chance in today's market of trivial penmanship.",1400976000,12,1013,4.696629213483146
5470963,5,B00AQGE5BS,"I am a very late bloomer to the Game of Thrones HBO series. I have heard so very much about it, but had never seen any of it before last week. I have yet to encounter anyone who doesn't love the series. Also, keep in mind that this series is in season four now and I still haven't encountered anyone who has seen it that doesn't just love it. I have however, encountered many who have not seen the series (once like myself). And, this is the main reason for my review. This is Must, Must See Viewing!! I recommend this series so Very, Very Highly!! My hope is that many who read this review will give this series a viewing. I love movies like TROY, GLADIATOR, and 300, just to name a few. I also loved the Spartacus series from STARZ(Andy Whitfield may you R.I.P.)! But, out of all the movies I own like this, and the few series, the only one in my top 25 is TROY.  Game of Thrones now sits atop all of my other viewing!!!!! And I own hundreds of movies, and many series. (Not to even mention that I've viewed over a thousand movies and series combined.) Game of Thrones is like real life being painted and played out on the screen for you all at the same time. I'm doing my best to illustrate how very bold, raw, and magical this series is, but it's almost impossible to put in words what this series truly does. It's so much more then mere words can describe. It will take you on an epic journey the likes of which you can't imagine. You truly have to see it to understand where I'm coming from, and desperately trying to go. It will take you to the STRATOSPHERE and so very far beyond, that your senses will be reeling out of control!! You will be on such a natural high that you never, ever, want it to end. I applaud the creative team behind this series for a job so very well done, that it truly is impossible for mere words to do it sincere justice. I can barely wait to get home from work, so I can lose myself in the Game of Thrones!! And last, but not the least by far, the Blu-ray is Superb, with Stellar audio and video. The cinematography is so breath-taking that it seems to transport you there. I thought I knew what my 7.1 surround system was meant for. But, I didn't. Now I know it was meant for the GAME OF THRONES to transport me on any epic journey the likes of which I've never been on, and may never go on AGAIN!!!!",1399852800,54,2337,4.147577092511013

5471002,4,B00AQGE5BS,"As someone who was admittedly very late to the Game of Thrones party - my exposure to the series, both HBO and book, was minimal until I decided to take the plunge and purchase this boxset in Feb of 2015 - there isn't a whole lot more I can say about the show that hasn't already been said: George R. R. Martin has created a vast, beautiful, complex world filled with war, sex, political intrigue, and dashes of mysticism that HBO has taken great care to faithfully adapt and bring to life on the small screen. The characters are many and multi-layered, and written and acted in a manner that makes the viewer either love or revile them appropriately. The series has received a lot of attention for its fearlessness in that all characters are expendable; the loved, the loathed, the minor characters, the major characters, the high, and the low are all equally likely to see their untimely and brutal demise. Such is the Game of Thrones.

I found the series strong and intriguing through the middle of Season 3 or so, then it started to struggle a bit (less certain notable exceptions....), but the lows never hit too far low. For those interested, the series does regain its footing partway through the 4th Season, which is sold separately.

The actual product is serviceable. The set includes each of the seasons separately packaged in their own labeled cases. Each season contains five discs, each disc holds anywhere from 1 to 3 episodes, which can be annoying should you be in the mood for binge-watching. I had no issues playing these on a normal Region 1 player. The current price for this three season set is right around $100. Interestingly enough, Amazon also currently has the individual seasons available for $35 each, but those individual season sets also include DVD and Digital versions, which this set does not offer. If you like the multiple versions, it's probably worth it to shell out the extra $5.",1424563200,,1918,4.722388059701492

5471036,5,B00AQGE5BS,"What's left to be said about GoT?  With a great cast, multiple story lines that maintain coherence through each season, extraordinary attention to sets, costumes, names, dialects, and even a title sequence that's worthy of kudos, GoT is just one of the best shows on television, period.  Not only does the show as a whole keep on getting better and better, but watching a new season underscores the excellence of the writing and acting in previous seasons.

With the possible exceptions of characters like Joffrey Baratheon and Ramsay Bolton played broadly and well as twisted sadists and the doomed Ygritte (yes we do get the idea that Jon Snow ""knows nothing""), characters grow and change as their back stories are filled in and they are buffeted by events.  Even cynical, smug Jaime Lannister (superbly played by Nicolaj Coster-Waldau) shows he has a conscience -- revealing that he chose to murder King Aerys Targaryen, rather than obeying the mad king's demands that Jaime kill his own father and slaughter the entire population of King's Landing.

The series is so good that it's more than worth the few extra bucks for the BluRay edition.  Immensely watchable, gripping and hugely entertaining, GoT is just plain superb.",1420675200,,1227,5.019704433497537

5471049,5,B00AQGE5BS,"To start this review is about the Game of Thrones: Seasons 1,2, &3 box set with a map on the front and the red/blue 18 (europe) rating tags on the lower corners (HBOuk.com). I felt the need to make this review because some of the top reviews for this were very negative, it made me very understandably cautious, so I wanted to share my experience as well. Just as a note in case anyone is interested, the seller I bought from was North to South. The blu-ray player I use is an older style Sony PS3.

When I received the set it was shipped separate, I received it with no broken parts or loose disks, the cases themselves in the box are stuffed with disks (there are 15 blu-rays in all).  At the bottom of the box was an HBO hologram sticker showing its authenticity. Inside each season's case was a foldout with a listing of all the episodes as well as a map or picture. It's all very nice and classy!  The face of the blu-ray discs list exactly what episode(s) are on them, as well as available special features.

Playing the discs:  Some of them have a longer loading time, with a waiting screen. Once they load though, you are presented with a nice menu system.  I tested disc 3 of season two for out of order episodes, and found no problems.  Episode 7 is indeed ""A Man Without Honor"" which is episode 7 according to both wikipedia and game of thrones wiki.

I also tested two episodes for proper subtitles, again they are exactly as I remember them the first time I saw them.  In Season 1 episode 6 ""A Golden Crown"" subtitles are present when they are meant to be there.  Not all Dothraki is meant to be subtitled as other characters will translate for them.  In Season 3 episode 3  ""Walk of Punishment"" all the subtitles are shown when scenes in Astapor play out.

All in all I am extremely pleased and relieved that both my box set came to me undamaged and with an attention to quality.  I hope this review shows an alternative and maybe eases doubts.",1418083200,49,1958,4.343406593406593

5471051,1,B00AQGE5BS,"I truly hate giving any product a bad review - especially when I am the first to review it.  But this one is just too bad in too many ways to not report it.

First, theres the packaging.  While the box did not arrive with any evidence of damage, the disc cases rattled with broken pieces before I even opened them.  When I did, and flipped through the sections, the internal disc holder sections of the cases broke free and fell out in two of the three cases along with all other broken fragments.

Second, there are no subtitles. Anytime the actors speak in the Dothraki tongue  which is a lot  there are no subtitles and those portions of the plot are lost.  And while my BluRay player allows me to select the use of subtitles in a variety of languages, Dothraki doesn't happen to be one of them.

Third, there is nothing to identify which episode is which.  This wouldnt be so important except that some of them are out of order.  For instance, disc 3 of season 2 contains episodes 5, 6, and 7.  Only 7 is really episode 5, 5 is really episode 6, and 6 is really episode 7.  Its completely maddening to get part way into an episode only to discover that the reason there is no continuity with the last episode is because you're watching the wrong one.

Lastly, each disc is marked as having bonus features, but Ive only found one disc so far in the first 8 that actually has an interesting segment of any length in which some of the actors discuss the making of one of the episodes.  The other remaining 1-5 minute segments on the discs seem to contain merely the usual warnings about copying the discs in a myriad of languages or medleys of video snippets from the episodes themselves.

It breaks my heart to see such an incredible series as The Game of Thrones be delivered to the public in such a shoddy manner.  My advice sadly is to purchase them in some other format  any other format - than this one. This one really should be taken off the market.",1416873600,128,1958,4.332417582417582

Each season also has an episode guide, with extras like maps, family trees/character guides or a small poster.

5471129,5,B00AQGE5BS,"Well I wrote an earlier review, based only on the first episodes of season one.  I have NOT read the books, and don't intend to.  [I don't have time to read fiction that long anymore].  Thank God--because invariably anyone who read the book(s) on which movies are based, criticizes the film because ""the book was so much better"".  Get over it.  They are different media and they operate differently.  Of course a book has a lot more details that get left out.  But a book is not a visual experience either (except in your mind, which has its own appeal).  OK this wasn't actually a ""movie"", it's a TV series.  And I'm now waiting for season 4.
Having gone through the majority of seasons 1-3, even my wife (who generally ABHORS fantasy) is hooked.  She admits, ""I have to see how it turns out!""
This was, they claim, the MOST expensive TV series ever filmed in Europe (so far).  It has very good actors, a very good script, great directing, wonderful cinematography, great blending of computer graphic images with real images, and in general it is addictive.
I've seen criticism about references to rape and how this is not politically correct.  Yes there are references to rape in the TV/Blu Ray series, but much less than the overall scenes of war and person-to-person conflict.  This is a story about a struggle of at least 5 people to become king, after the death of the reigning one without a clear heir.  It's the story of several continents and many families.  It's easy to get confused, but fortunately there's an in-viewing guide to help you when you forget who or where you are seeing.

Neither my wife nor I think there is an undue emphasis on violence toward women.  There's far more male-on-male violence.  Rape, just like deaths of civilians, and bad treatment of the enemy combatants, has been a part of warfare as far as we have any records.  In that sense, it is only ""realistic"" fantasy.  There is not any excessive gore in Game of Thrones (if anything the sex scenes are more explicit than the violent ones).  But the scenes of pure dialog outweigh any scenes of violence.  And the landscapes, both interior and exterior, are all exquisite.

The series is interesting because, like any good fiction, it touches on all the universal themes which play out in real life: loyalty, betrayal, honor, deceit, greed for sex or money or power, the tension between those who have and who have not, and whether good guys win in the end or don't.  The ""magical"" elements, though present, are really subservient to the story about the people, and are not dominant in the plot.  This is an imaginary world, clearly not Earth either in past or future.  However it's great fiction.
We watch one episode per night, and are going to miss it when we have to wait for season 4 to finish.",1404518400,,2786,4.611788617886178

5471132,5,B00AQGE5BS,"This is a fascinating epic of the power of force. One king against the others, each with their own agendas. In a fantastical world of ice walls and dragons, the disregard for human life seems to be an accepted part of the cultures, although only one has hope of a benevolent ruler, at least up to the end of Season 3.  The despicable Geoffrey is every bit as obnoxious as he is ruthless, and with a mother that is definitely a little off the beam, I'll be waiting with bated breath to view the rest of the seasons, in anticipation of just desserts!",1402963200,6,548,4.320388349514563
