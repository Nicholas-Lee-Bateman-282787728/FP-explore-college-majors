6454693,2,B00KZJX8GE,"Heatstroke is a South African/German production starring Stephen Dorff as a hyena expert Paul. For his research Paul travels to the African desert with his girlfriend Tally (Svetlana Metkina), but this time he has to bring his own daughter Josie (Maisie Williams, Game of Thrones), too, who obviously is not interested in Pauls lifelong study.

The father-daughter relation described in the first half of the film is credible, but you know, Heatstroke becomes a survival action, so things get more complicated and dangerous, when the three characters are involved with a group of armed poachers led by typecast Peter Stormare in the middle of the desert.

Despite the DVD jacket, the role of Stephen Dorff is much smaller than you might be led to believe. The main stars here are Svetlana Metkina and Maisie Williams, and to be honest their performances are underwhelming. This is partly because of the films not-so-compelling storyline and sluggish pace, as well as the dull characters who keep making stupid mistakes.

The location is convincing, with the beautifully-shot photography that captures the atmosphere of the African desert, but the film, in spite of hyenas and other creatures (plus cardboard villains), fails to build up tension. In short, Heatstroke needs a better storyteller.",1405555200,,1294,5.241545893719807
6454694,3,B00KZJX8GE,"This movie had so much going for it but in the end left me wanting more. The storyline is great but writing is awkward and just not good. Maisie Williams' character and the Dad both did a good job but the Russian girlfriend just annoyed me. In the end, it comes back to the script. Without a good script as a backbone ,everything seems to fall apart. The movie does have it's good moments and great cinematography. I do recommend watching it but In no means go out of your way to do it.",1405555200,,486,4.180851063829787

6454696,3,B00KZJX8GE,"""They looked like they needed help. He said they is a little off the desert."" Paul (Dorff) and his girlfriend Tally are taking a trip to Africa. His daughter Josie (Williams) is having trouble with the new relationship and reluctantly is dragged along. Instantly Josie and Tally clash until Josie asks to be sent home. On the way to the airport something happens to Paul and it is up to Tally to protect Josie and find a way to get her home safe. This is a movie that is hard to review. The movie isn't bad and moved at a pretty good pace but on the other hand it is really a overdone concept. The thing that does set this apart from others though is that the woman is the one who has to protect someone. While this may seem like an action movie it is much more drama then I was expecting. I was hoping for something like In The Blood but instead got more of a hide and seek type movie. Not that that isn't a bad thing but it needed something else to keep it from feeling as flat as it did. Overall, nothing amazing but nothing awful either. Really just a movie to put in when you have nothing else to do. I give it a C+.",1404777600,3,1121,4.076923076923077
6454697,2,B00KZJX8GE,"Only those who have enjoyed Maisie Williams' seasons-long trek on HBO's Game of Thrones may find something notable about Heatstroke, a survival thriller in which she crosses the African desert with another adult companion. Otherwise the film, directed by Evelyn Purcell in her first feature since the '80s, fails to take proper advantage of the danger-rich environment full of evil poachers, wild hyenas, and Mother Nature's brutal hand. With little to offer but bland, generic characters and lukewarm shocks, the real act of survival is making it through Heatstroke all the way through to the end.

Stephen Dorff is Paul, an expert on hyenas who is gearing up for a trip to the wilds of Africa to study the predators, bringing along his hot, tough-as-nails Russian girlfriend, Tally (Svetlana Metkina), to help out. The film kicks off with Tally, looking battered and frayed by the sun, eluding mysterious adversaries in a Cessna, so we know she can hold her own. But is she tough enough to deal with a bratty American teenager? Paul's daughter, Jo (Williams), was caught with drugs and now she's been forced to tag along with Dad so he can keep an eye on her. Jo is a spoiled brat whose face is always buried in her Ipad or ears under headphones, and when she does bother to speak it's to complain about Dad's lover or the boring surroundings.

It's a fairly one-note performance by Williams as the bratty teen, and for much of the first half of Heatstroke it plays out like an especially arid family dispute, one with the occasional hyena passing through. But then a string of events involving poachers (led by the ever-boring Peter Stormare), a car crash, and a murder thrust Tally and Jo into one another's company where neither wants to be. Chased by killers while low on life-giving water, the duo's squabbles are understandably heightened, and for a time there's a great deal of promise in watching these enemies leaning on one another for support. Exhaustion, fatigue, mirages, and the constant threat of heat stroke are long-term threats, but the most immediate concern is Jo's attitude and downright stupidity at times. Her stubbornness puts them in greater danger on more than one occasion, literally walking right into the poachers' base camp at one point. Fortunately for her, Tally's pretty badass, a sort of poor man's Lara Croft with survival skills in spades. If only we got to see more of them. And Metkina is certainly no Angelina Jolie; she lacks the charisma to lead a film like this, and the other performances are similarly underwhelming. Purcell, who also wrote the script, does a great job of capturing the exotic, wide expanse of bush country but is less effective at depicting action, something she's rarely been called upon to do and likely won't be called upon to do again.",1404691200,8,2803,4.861924686192468

6454701,1,B00KZJX8GE,"This movie was pitiful. Once again I am duped into watching a Stephen Dorff movie, thinking it's gonna be better than the last trash I saw him in. It's so disappointing as a SD fan to see him repeatedly make these horrible movies! This movie was so bad that I didn't get past the first 30 minutes. Spoiler alert...he dies in the beginning of the movie and what broke the camel's back is how the daughter didn't crack a tear! Yes! Her father dies and she didn't even flinch! Not a tear. She just continues on like someone stepped on her foot. From that point on, I was done. And that non-acting Russian woman was stiff and had no impact whatsoever. I'd say skip this and if you're a SD fan watch Blade.",1417651200,,701,4.2781954887218046
6454702,3,B00KZJX8GE,"OK. Let's start with the weaknesses. Formulaic plot. Jarring gaps in narrative. Stereotyped bad guys. Dumb behaviour causing the thematic problem. Now that that's out of the way, the scenery is fascinating, and the two female leads are absolutely fine in carrying out their roles. This is a part of the world we rarely see in film, and the settings are edifying. Also, the scientific material on hyenas is very interesting, and the development of a theme around their behaviour is pretty clever. This is a deeply flawed movie, but I didn't find it that hard to watch, and my memories of having seen it are mostly positive.",1414195200,,622,4.768518518518518
6454703,5,B00KZJX8GE,"Heatstroke is a well made movie about a man, his daughter, and his girlfriend.  The filming is very well done.  The acting is top notch.  The plot is engaging and well written.  The only complaint I have is that the movie poster does not portray the movie accurately.  This is a survival movie featuring two strong female characters.

There is a scientist who studies hyenas.  He is divorced from his wife, and his daughter comes to stay with him in South Africa.  There is tension between he and his teen daughter, but also tension between him and his girlfriend.  There is strong tension between the daughter and the girlfriend.

While out in the wild, the man and his daughter come upon criminals........

No spoilers.

I enjoyed the movie very much and appreciated the strong female characters.

I give this movie an A- rating.  Well worth watching.",1413936000,,853,4.7534246575342465

6454711,3,B00KZJX8GE,"Paul( Stephen Dorfff) lives, breathes, and teaches about hyenas. His girlfriend Tally (Svetlana Metkina) is a one woman Peace Corp traveling the globe helping people out wherever they need it. Paul is headed back to the grassland/desert with Tally when circumstances and his ex-wife demands he take his brooding 13 year old daughter, Jo ( Maisie Williams) with him. She of course creates internal conflict because Tally is to blame for her parents being apart, etc., etc.

As the film progresses, they come across poachers and are in a fight for their lives as they have seen and know too much. You know the formula.

This is the old two people are forced to bond in a bad situation action-drama. How well you like it is going to depend on how well you like or identify with the two lead female characters. There isn't much else happening. We needed something to bring the film full circle, i.e. something they said or did at the beginning of the film, saves them at the end...and it should concern a hyena...but it didn't.

Hyenas, poachers, and critters were the bigger problems than the heat which they seemed to handle effectively, but I guess ""Heatstroke"" tested better than ""When Poachers Go Bad.""

6454713,3,B00KZJX8GE,"She did well with the material she was given.  But, she was definitely not Arya Stark (and wasn't supposed to be).  Svetlana Metkina was convincing in her part (at least, by Hollywood standards).  The Hollywood standards part is what really killed this effort.  The director obviously decided to save a bunch of money by not employing anyone (AT ALL) who had even a remote knowledge of how to do violence (or much of anything dealing with realism).  Or else she thought she knew what she was doing and didn't realize the depth of her ignorance.  For example the garroting scene and the ensuing struggle was almost comical in its direction.  Tally, when presented with the option to pick up a great battle rifle with which to defend herself and Jo, passes it up in favor of a stick.  In fact, she favors the stick even though she has a pistol.  An airplane is constantly flying over Tally or Tally and Jo as they walk or run across a flat open landscape and they wait until the plane is about 50 feet overhead before ducking behind a bush (this happens a lot).  And they are not spotted.  Except for a couple of times when the pilot says, ""I think I saw something moving!"".  And all the others glance around and say, ""Naaaaah,  Nothing there.""  If you're a Stephen Dorff fan hoping to see him in action, you will be very disappointed.  He's not in it much and when he is in it, well...he should have stayed home.  I won't watch it again but I will pick up pretty much anything that Maisie plays a prominent part in just to see how she develops.  She's putting in a lot of work and I hope it pays off.",1406937600,,1599,4.366101694915254
6454714,2,B00KZJX8GE,"Here you have a movie with an incredibly intriguing story and a  rough heat soaked environment that is perfect for films and guess what?  The players sink it! ""Heatstroke"" is a seemingly non Hollywood movie that almost appears like it was made in the 90s. Stephen Doroh (from the film ""Brake"" and other less notables) plays a dad trying to mend fences with his bratty thirteen year old daughter on a trip to Africa . He's got a new girlfriend (the atrocious actress Svetlana Metkina) that his teenage daughter can't accept.

Even the preview tells you that dad gets murdered by a drug lord, so no spoilers here. It's now up to girlfriend and daughter to survive the African wasteland, avoid hyenas and not get captured by ruthless thugs. Sounds interesting right? Unfortunately, predictable moments abound and you just can't believe the actors. Maisie Williams ( dads daughter) is incapable of getting much sympathy with such contrived emotions and Peter Stormane (of Fargo fame) looks like he's lost all his menacing mojo.

The film does hold your attention on a minor level but I kept saying to myself , ""people don't act like this"".  The actress playing Dorph's wife, that has a relatively bit part is so bad, it could actually make you shake your head in disgust if your a big critic  of movie actors like me. ""Heatstroke"" however is filmed quite well for what was probably a direct to dvd movie and that falls into the ""what a waste"" category. I took a chance with ""Heatstroke""  and I would recommend that you don't take that same chance unless your using this film for demonstration purposes in a drama class on the ""donts"" of acting.",1406937600,,1640,4.713286713286713
