2063302,4,B000267JNI,"This video is a very basic introduction to western style boxing techniques.  Given that this was the videos intentions, one should not be too disappointed when they complete the video and are left wanting a lot more.  For someone who has never thrown a punch or bobbed and weaved, this video is a great starting point.  To someone who has had any training in boxing, even cardio kickboxing, they may want to seek a more advanced video.  For those who are couch potatoes and wish to change their lifestyles, this video is an excellent starting point.",1334534400,25,549,4.6875
2063303,4,B000267JNI,"before I work out to a DVD I always watch it to see what is involved.  I watched it today and I really like how you are given instructions on how to wrap your hands, your stance, and how to throw punches.  After all of the instruction there is a workout and it looks fun, engaging, and has the sweatability:-).  I don't know if I like the talking in the background, I will have to see how that works out when I actually do the video, but what I do like is that he is actually doing the workout.  He did not stop to walk to someone else, but he is working out too.
I will report back tomorrow after I do the workout tonight.",1305072000,16,623,3.96
2063304,5,B000267JNI,"This is a truly great DVD for those just beginning to learn boxing. It goes guides you through using wraps, mitts, speed bag, heavy bag, etc. Even if you don't have any boxing equipment, there is a huge shadow boxing section that allows you to practice your punches without equipment. At the end there is a jump rope workout and a medicine ball workout. It doesn't move too fast, yet by the end of the DVD you feel you have actually learned a lot about boxing.

I use this video 2-3 times a week as a great cardio workout. Once I get these skills down I'll probably try the advanced DVD. If you are new to boxing or just want to refine your skills by learning from the pros, this DVD is for you!",1139875200,48,695,4.186567164179104
2063305,5,B000267JNI,If you want to get a great work out; this is the dvd for you. I would make sure you do the warm up and cool down. The only equipment I had to have was a jump rope. Worth every penny! Comparable to my Tae Bo dvd. Only this dvd makes me feel I've gotten a better workout. I have been using it for 4 weeks and already see a HUGE difference.,1134518400,32,337,3.6944444444444446

8022653,3,B000267JNI,I bought this dvd thinking it was going to help me learn some more insights on boxing being that I'm a beginner. Come to find out I didn't learn anything new.
