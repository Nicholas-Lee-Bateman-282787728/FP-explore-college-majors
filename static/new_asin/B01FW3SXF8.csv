And thus Trading was born. I fell in love with this idea and prayed the movie would live up to it. I wasn't really disappointed. Its like Fight Club to the death, except the prize is financial security, after several trades of course. The rules put into place are brilliant, very well-conceived. So the story is awesome, all around. The acting is quite good and the direction is well done. When it comes down to the fights, some are quick, some are drawn out, but they're all pretty brutal. I love it when a wonderful concept gets a great movie, and even though it can be a little rough around the edges at times, this is a great movie.",1474156800,,806,4.140127388535032
8761606,4,B01FW3SXF8,"Traders is a psychological thriller that taps into the tensions caused by a depressed economy. Harry (Killian Scott) is a young man accustomed to the creature comforts afforded by his job in finance who is cast adrift when his company goes under in an economic downturn. Jobs have disappeared and homes are being repossessed. Suicide rates are at an all-time high.

Newly unemployed Vernon Stynes (John Bradley) might have the solution to the despair brought on by the recession. He masterminds a sinister, all-or-nothing plan he calls Trading. Through an underground network of similarly displaced individuals, two people agree to trade by emptying their bank accounts, selling everything they own, and putting the cash in nondescript green bags. They then bring the bags to a remote location, dig a grave, and fight to the death. The winner buries the loser and takes both bags of cash.

Writer-director team Rachael Moriarty and Peter Murphy have used real-world concerns to created a fictional game that taps into the desperation and humiliation of being out of work and forced to abruptly alter ones lifestyle. Since most people have at least on occasion experienced anxiety over their financial state, the films premise, though far-fetched, is intriguing. The movie poses the question, How much would you risk to regain your economic status and lifestyle?

The film flirts with the deal-with-the-Devil theme. Initially, Harry rejects Vernons bizarre proposal, but as his circumstances worsen and there seems to be no relief on the horizon, desperation trumps morality. Hes willing to give up his soul and humanity to kill for cash.

Bonus features on the unrated widescreen Blu-ray release include audio commentaries, making-of featurette, and theatrical trailers.",1470096000,,1770,5.333333333333333
