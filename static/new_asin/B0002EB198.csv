8027123,5,B0002EB198,This man gets to the common sense core of dog training. A lot of what he says works for children too.,1425513600,,101,3.857142857142857
8027124,5,B0002EB198,"These DVD's are full of great information on training your dog.  There is none of the old time dominance stuff promoted here.  Just good information to help you develop a leadership role and build a great relationship with your dog.  That said, the audio quality is not very good.  But because the actual training information is so good I can get past the poor audio quality.",1393891200,,375,4.636363636363637
8027125,5,B0002EB198,I have had dogs my entire life and find this to be the most helpful way to train!  My dog is really responding.,1376611200,,111,3.8260869565217392
8027126,5,B0002EB198,"Overall, this is the best dog training video I've seen. Yes, better than the Monks of New Skete, or any pop culture TV show on Animal Planet. These folks really care and are sincere about helping people create a true and long lasting relationship with their dogs.

Highly recommended to all dog owners!",1211500800,,302,4.69811320754717
8027127,5,B0002EB198,"For anyone sharing their life or interested in sharing their life with dogs I highly HIGHLY recommend the Tenderfoot Training video - I have never felt comfortable recommending a video or trainer until I came upon this couple in Colorado. I feel very strongly about sharing this video with everyone because this is the one video that truly shows people not only how to create a relationship built on respect and trust with our canine companions but it also gives a clear understanding of how dogs think. The Tenderfoot Training video has foundation drills and several relationship exercises to build a quality relationship between you and your dog regardless of age and issues.
I take seminars and am in contact with different trainers, behaviorists and vets around the country and overseas. Up until recently I have not been comfortable recommending trainers because methods and certain elements of the training did not sit well with me.  I was fortunate to discover the Simpson's of Tenderfoot Training whose method was not only gentle and effective but whose philosophy resonated with my own. I purchased their video and was overjoyed with what they were sharing and the amount of information they offered. They hold back nothing and their hearts are in the right place. Finally I had found what I was looking for. I encourage everyone, new dog parents and those who have shared their lives with dogs for years to check out the Tenderfoot Training video - I also want to make something very clear. I do not make any money or benefit in any way by recommending this video or couple. What I get out of sharing this is the knowing that dogs whose people choose this method will not have to undergo the frustration of being misunderstood and the pain that often goes along with it.
