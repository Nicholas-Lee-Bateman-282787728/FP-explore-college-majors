2168400,4,B000650M7A,"Contrary to what one ""reviewer"" has written, Quantez is a fairly good Western although certainly no great classic. Most major Western enthusiasts will enjoy this movie.

The DVD-R is quite good with stable images, good colour and considerable definition. Obviously the price of this DVD-R is quite high for a ""bare-bones"" disc with no ""extras"" but I'm glad I bought it. Fans of Westerns or Fred MacMurray will probably be pleased with this disc.",1319673600,2,445,5.013513513513513
2168401,2,B000650M7A,"This is the opinion of Brian Garfield in his Western Films book. I saw this film lately in a VHS version, which was a factory, good quality tape, but I felt just like Garfield after seeing this film. Some talking styles irritate. MacMurray's way of talking is such one for me. It is about robbers which quarrel with each others. MacMurray will see his bad ways. I remind you that in IMDB many have liked this film. I do not know why. The actors are good, though, but the story is from B-films.",1313539200,4,493,4.311827956989247
2168402,2,B000650M7A,"This was a slow and tedious western. MacMurray is not a hero for my taste. I expected more than long philosophical discussion what is good an evil. Too much talk. One pretty much knows how everything will turn out. The actors do their best, but the story is weak.",1201824000,3,263,4.387755102040816
2168403,4,B000650M7A,"Quantez was one of a number of Westerns made by Fred MacMurray during the 1950's. MacMurray had long been a popular star in Hollywood, but his career had begun to decline, and even though he was already one of the wealthiest, if not the wealthiest actor in Hollywood, he continued to soldier on films and television plays until his career was resurrected by his work in the live action Disney films like The Shaggy Dog and The Absent-Minded Professor and the hit television show My Three Sons. And MacMurray later said that he didn't feel comfortable in Westerns, adding that ""I didn't feel one with the horse.""

Well, Quantez belies those feelings, and along with movies like Good Day For A Hanging, At Gunpoint, and Day of The Bad Man, prove that Fred MacMurray conquered this genre as he did with every other genre he tried. In Quantez, MacMurray plays one of five desperate people looking for a way out. They are four bandits who just robbed a bank which led to a murder. Fleeing a pursuing posse, they head toward the Mexican town of Quantez, figuring to hide out until the coast is clear. The group consists of the ringleader, played by John Larch, Larch's girlfriend, played by Dorothy Malone, a young and obviously inexperienced would-be desperado, played by John Gavin, a white man raised by Indians, played by Sydney Chaplin, and MacMurray, the cool and steady professional.

The group finds Quantez deserted, not knowing that the govenrment has withdrawn their troops and Apaches have taken over the surrounding territory with the intention of killing any whites who stay too long in the area. As the group deals with uneasiness and internecine rivalry, the Indians begin to close in.
MacMurray is very believable in his role as he tries to keep the peace and figure out a plan before it's too late. The rest of the cast are good as well, and Quantez ends up being very enjoyable and entertaining. Another great Western candidate for DVD release, as are MacMurray's Westerns At Gunpoint and Day of The Bad Man.",1146960000,11,2021,4.771428571428571

8038642,4,B000650M7A,"I admit this is perhaps not one of Universal's finest westerns, but it does have quite a bit going for it. To start with - Fred MacMurray and John Larch (disgracefully billed last but one!) give powerful performences that hold the film together. Along with James Barton as a wily but scared (he has every right to be) old timer, and Sidney Chaplin as a white man raised by Apaches(!), they make the many long dialogue sequences very bearable. There is a hefty fist fight between Larch and John Gavin and an Apache raid. I couldn't help but find Dorothy Malone  miscast-Perfectly made up, blonde hair styled to perfection and not a wrinkle on face or clothes, plays a woman ""past her best"" and ""no man would look twice at her"" as her boyfriend Larch keeps on and on saying, and that is blatantly untrue. Also Gavin does not convinces as a green young Easterner, but minor points and not enough to spoil this western fans enjoyment. This UNIVERSAL VAULT SERIES DVD is excellent quality 2.39 ratio (bars top and bottom with good colour and sound. No extras. Recomended, with slight reservations, to the true western lover.",1451692800,,1119,4.680203045685279

8038646,1,B000650M7A,"This looks like a really cool movie. Recently, I bought this and 3 other westerns from Amazon, and could not get them to play in my DVD/Blue Ray entertainment system. I returned them and Amazon sent me a replacement, but that one didn't work either. All other movies I've bought from Amazon play perfectly. Quite a disappointment, because I've never seen this and would like to be able to someday. The good news is that Amazon was very prompt in having the movies returned and my account credited. Would still like to see them, though!",1404086400,,535,4.6421052631578945

8038648,4,B000650M7A,Widescreen B Western with some A-list actors.  A bunch of thieves hole up in an abandoned town threatened by warpathing  Apaches.  Not much action till the very end.  Rather talky but OK.  Beautiful photography and color.  No frills and no extras on the DVD-R.  It would have been nice to have included the trailer.  Otherwise not bad Western and a great DVD-R.  Recommended for Western fans.,1382313600,,392,4.818181818181818
8038649,2,B000650M7A,"The print of this DVD-R is OK, though no subtitles, no extra features. The promoshots and posters of this Western promise a lot of action, but there a lot of talking, mainly by MacMurray. Only at the start and during the showdown there is brief action. The many (moralistic) dialogues in between (on one location) are irritating me, too much talk.
My ratings: DVD: 3/5; plot: 2/5.",1342051200,,380,4.686567164179104
8038650,4,B000650M7A,"High quality DVD R with great image in Cinemascope aspect ratio.................this is an excellent noirish western............

I really like MacMurray in this role.......he is believable as the grizzled gunfighter...also I like John Gavin, three years prior to Psycho.  Recommended for Western fans.",1330041600,4,302,6.166666666666667
