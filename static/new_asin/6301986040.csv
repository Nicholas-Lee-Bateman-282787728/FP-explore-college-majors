410148,5,6301986040,"There are three most important reasons why you should watch this film, even if it is in black and white and slightly old in style. We would not make films like that any more even for TV, but we could also say that about Hitchcock or Charlie Chaplin. So what! Well, be positive and as I said before there are three main positive reasons for you to watch this film, or any film of that series, because it is a series. First it is Agatha Christie, and Agatha Christie is the most English woman that writes the most English detective stories with the most English ""private eye"" or ""sleuth"" no one in no Hollywood or even Bollywood could think of or imagine. Second Miss Marple is the sleuth of the film and that Miss Marple is an old fire-fox at that. She knits when on duty in a jury, and then she blocks the jury in its decision, one to eleven. Her imagination is totally twisted  and warped, just what is needed to find the criminal in the story, a typical English criminal, no serial killer or pure psychotic violent schizophrenic or whatever twisted lunatic you may think of. No, just a plain English person who for some reason or other has to kill someone out of logic, maybe not our logic, but a plain simple logic that says when endangered or menaced a plain ordinary simple unremarkable individual has to kill to survive. In this case the menace is blackmailing about some old childhood crime that had gone unpunished. And the third reason is that this Miss Marple is played by Margaret Rutherford who is a real pleasure on the screen or the stage, in fact I should say was of course since the film is from 1964 and she was already canonically old then. She is a real treat because she really acts and she turns her old age, her deformed body and her drooping skin and flesh into visual assets to build her character. This too is a very great particularity of England: first actors work equally on the stage or for the cinema or for TV, and they do make an effort to provide parts to older actors, and thus to give a picture of real society in which old people are part of our daily social landscape. Now to get the detail or details about the crime you'll have to go and watch the film. But be sure that in the most English way possible the private eye has the last word in the case over the public police officer and of course the woman sleuth has the upper hand over the male detective. Some will say the film is quaint, but that quaintness is a whole culture that you may not be able to witness any more in real life. The cinema is our unfailing memory.

410149,4,6301986040,"Dame Margaret Rutherford makes an unlikely but extremely entertaining ""Jane Marple"" in this film version of Agatha Christie's novel ""Mrs. Maginty's Dead."" In spite of considerable tampering with the character, the film is fairly faithful to the plot of one of Christie's more widely praised novels, concerning a young man wrongly suspected of murdering his landlady.
Of the four Miss Marple films starring Dame Margaret, this one shows the actress' celebrated eccentricities to their best advantage, and Rutherford fans will be delighted by her broad and extremely charming performance.  Christie purists and those looking for weightier fare will be disappointed, but for some truly lightweight entertainment with a 1960s British tone, Dame Margaret and company are hard to beat.",1008979200,27,779,5.546218487394958

Be warned, however, that Margaret Rutherford's portrayal of Miss Marple deviates sharply from the character in Agatha Christie's novels.

410436,5,6301986040,"It took me some time to warm-up to Margaret Rutherford's Miss Marple. As a die-hard Joan Hickson fan, I didn't think that humor was appropriate for this character. Yes, I was a Hickson-Marple snob. Then, when I was desperate, I watched one of the Rutherford entries. Then I watched another. Then another. Then I watched them all again...and again. OMG! I finally fell in love with this version of Miss Marple. It finally dawned on me why: Rutherford's character wasn't the self-effacing and demure Miss Marple I knew. She wasn't the type who always deferred to the power and position of the inspector and minimized her own abilities. Oh, no. This Miss Marple, after being rebuffed by the police, jumps into the fray and conducts her own investigation! She's not only brilliant; she's an action hero! And she's not afraid to tell the inspector how obtuse he is! In fact, she even tells him that Agatha Christie should be required reading for the police force! Now this is my kind of woman! This is no village spinster with just intellectual gifts. This is a brilliant woman with a pedigree that includes expertise in firearms, horse riding, and fencing! These movies are interesting, fun, and compelling. Murder Most Foul is my favorite. The beginning is priceless! And you'll see a young Joan Hickson in another one.

I absolutely love Margaret Rutherford as Miss Marple (or Poirot oddly changed into Marple, but no matter) - these four movies are a joy to watch and I wish she could have done more movies based on Agatha Christie books however loosely based.

Like Alfred Hitchcock making a subtle walk-on in all of his movies, Rutherford's Marple will respond to another character's query about the book she's shown carrying or reading and it's an Agatha Christie book  :D  She highly recommends them!

Black and white movie and no charm lost at all.

410580,5,6301986040,"Although the Margaret Rutherford Miss Marple films are more a vehicle for Dame Margaret  than a vehicle for Agatha Christie, it doesn't matter. Chritstie's Miss Marple is an autere old lady, serious, wise and a bit sneaky, hiding behind the typical old lady syndrome. Dame Margaret is full blown, a rollicking personality, a bloodhound on the scent but seldom taken seriously while in full view she connives to catch the killer. When joining the cast of a small theatrical compny where she hopes to ferret out a killer, Dame Margaret is hilarious reciting ""The Shooting of Dan McGrew."" Charles Tingwell plays Inspector Craddock perfectly, treading a thin line in which he has to appear  a competent policeman and not a klutz constantly one-upped by Miss Marple. Stringer Davis as Mr. Stringer is actually Dame Margaret's husband, and he has a balancing act, too, although in his role as a sort of factotem of Miss Marple, he pulls it off and saves his dignity.

Dame Margaret's wardrobe is simply stunning featuring among other creations a slinky grey job with a draped bodice into which is tucked an enormous artificial flower, and an elegant black velvet evening gown. The clever couturiers make Dame Margaret into a fashion plate and the result is wonderful to behold.

410765,5,6301986040,"For my tastes she's the best.  If comparing her to the more current renditions of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple then there is no comparison.  Her four films as Miss Marple set the standard in my estimation.  For one thing there is no gore or violence, there is no sex, but there is plenty of suspense.  Margaret Rutherford is oozing with character.  She is energetic, fisty and full of surprises.  She is a truly hands on amateur detective.

The plot of this 1965 film, ""Murder Most Foul"" begins with an eccentric juror who refuses to believe the prisoner is guilty of the murder, unique to the other jurors.  She sets out to prove him innocent by joining a stage play to find the real murderer.  She is placed in considerable danger as a result.  Her sidekick Stringer Davis is perfectly entertaining, as he cooperates with her schemes.  The police officer, Charles Tingwell, also a very convincing counterpart, is, as usual, sure she is meddling where she shouldn't be. How does she always end up at the scene before he does?  Each of the cast of the play she has joined are suspects. She sets a trap to find the guilty one.  I would rate this film very highly. Run time is 1 hour, 30 minutes in black and white.",1287619200,,1214,4.513761467889908
410766,2,6301986040,"Although it is a pleasure watching Margaret Rutherford steal every scene she is in (not hard, given that the supporting players in this movie are all grade B performers), this is not a very good film...much less a good story.  There are too many convenient elements that occur, too many convoluted plot and character threads, too many red herrings, and no real reason to care who did it or why.  This is one of those mysteries where the viewer is not given enough information to figure it out along with the protagonist, and as a result I felt manipulated.  Not recommended unless you are a big fan of Margaret Rutherford.",1278806400,3,622,4.636363636363637
410767,5,6301986040,"""Murder Most Foul"" is another installment in the Miss Marple series played by the charming Margaret Rutherford.  The theme is a series of murders taking place among actors in a repertory company.  For some reason these murders are taking place and once again, it's Miss Marple to the rescue.

Margaret Rutherford is her usual charming self as she navigates her way around the company searching clues and nab the murderer.

Being a lifelong fan of murder mysteries (Sherlock Holmes, Ellery Queen, Charlie Chan, etc.), I had to check this title out at the local public library.  Unlike today's murder mysteries that can be quite graphic and full of R-rated language, the Miss Marple series are more like a PG rating and are in black and white.  In my humble opinion, the older series such as Miss Marple and the older Sherlock Holmes and Charlie Chan titles are more entertaining and have a certain charm that newer series sometimes lack.

Comment aside, the film was entertaining, full of red herrings designed to distract Miss Marple, and full of the usual suspects.  Does Miss Marple nail the murderer?

Watch and see!
