8310971,5,B001IFZL8W,"I really enjoy learning how different cities are coping growth and how that growth is affecting the planet. This series is a few years old, 2008, but it still somewhat timely in 2013",1372723200,,182,4.545454545454546
8310972,5,B001IFZL8W,"PBS comes up with some pretty good shows but the series on Transport was brilliant. I wish students in efficiency, design and engineering all watch these as they grow in the process of embracing best practices and looking for new ones of their own.",1355616000,,248,4.659090909090909
8310973,3,B001IFZL8W,"The e series episode on the Paris Vlib system is extremely upbeat about the prospect of integrating bicycle traffic with cars and pedestrians. When the show first aired in 2008, the cheap bike rental system was less than two years old. Now Vlib is well-established, but there are still problems, which the show downplays or ignores.

They say nothing about the vandalism that leaves many of the bikes destroyed or in need of extensive repair. They do feature a floating repair shop, but leave the impression that the repairs are mostly for routine maintenance. Today's New York Times Green Blog observed that it is not unusual to find every bike unusable at any given Vlib station.

According to this e episode, the worst thing is that people like to ride the bikes downhill, but few ride them back uphill, making it necessary to haul bikes uphill with a tractor so that the bikes are well-distributed throughout the city. Meanwhile the bicycle stations are turning into trendy meeting places for Parisians and tourists, according to the Paris officials interviewed.

JC Decaux, an outdoor advertising company, underwrites the Vlib project in exchange for permission to scatter more than 1,600 billboards all over Paris. There are no interviews with Parisians who think that the ads are an eyesore.

Still, finding new ways to make it easy and cheap to get from one place to another is important, as is replacing transport that makes the city unpleasant (belching buses, gridlocked city centers).

Car traffic in central London has been reduced by charging a congestion fee. Pedestrians and bicyclists love the increased space the reduction in car congestion has made possible, but the interview with the cranky cab driver reveals that not everyone is a fan.",1318291200,2,2040,5.44620253164557
8310974,5,B001IFZL8W,"A short video about the shared bike system in Paris, the Velib, encouraging Parisians to use them and public transit. I am doing the same thing lately, in Charleston, SC and in Charlotte, NC. I try to take public transit when I can, minimizing the use of the car. It opens another world for me as an artist, and involves me in a whole new community of fellow citizens. It is wise for earth. Watch this!",1315440000,,402,4.302631578947368

8310977,5,B001IFZL8W,"The whole series of e2 is well worth viewing. The series brings a wealth of information about real initiatives that are being developed and implemented world wide in order to make environmentally sensible decisions. The Transport episodes introduced me to new ideas that have real value in today's fragile world. I highly recommend any of the series to people who are looking to be informed about all aspects of how mankind affects the environment and what methods of sensible design, manufacturing and utilization are possible and are being carried out.",1236729600,5,554,5.166666666666667
