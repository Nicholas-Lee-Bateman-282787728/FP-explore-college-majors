I really enjoyed viewing it. The only thing spoiling it was the fact that for some reason Film Shows, Inc. decieded not to use a host but instead used printing on the screen instead. This was distracting and sometimes flashed on and off the screen too fast to read the whole thing. This is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.",1156118400,4,512,4.079207920792079
