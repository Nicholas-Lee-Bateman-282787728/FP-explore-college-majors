3880961,2,B0029U0ZZY,The picture on the front is not at all what the movie is about you only get to see Margaret for about four minutes in the whole film.,1273363200,16,133,3.7857142857142856
3880962,4,B0029U0ZZY,"What is great about this old British film is that it is just plain deliciously fun! Some people gawk at the use of that word to describe something pleasureable, but I find it perfect for this mostly (unfortunetly) forgotten film. 1952's CASTLE IN THE AIR is witty, charming, and has a stellar cast throughout. This is really David Tomlinson's movie as he is truely brilliant as the Scottish Laird who's desperately trying to keep his sinking castle financially afloat. American audiences will most remember Tomlinson from Disney's 1964's megasmash Mary Poppins. Margaret Rutherford effortly shines as well, as one of the castles tenants who thinks the Laird is really the rightful King of Scotland - yes she is a bit eccentric, but afterall we are talking about Margaret Rutherford performance! I am a big fan of Miss Rutherford's and only which her part was a little bit larger. Can't say this was her most memorable role, but a perfect addition to this solid cast through and through. The humor revolves around the Laird's awful financially straped situation, and the desperate measures by which he and his loyal staff do to not end up in the poor house. At times the castle is a Bed & Breakfast and they even give ""Estate Tours"" to help raise runds. Between the tenants, bill collectors, an American guest, a repressed romance, tourers, mice, and a ghost - you have vintage old school, old world British humour at its best!  I also have to mention the often huge amazing sets and the adorable silly ghost named Emmentrude that helps the Laird at just the right times. My only complaint is not with the picture itself, but with the lousy transfer DVD quality they have for this particular disc. This really is an enchanting old film and it deserves a far better treatment that it has gotton here. Unfortunitely at this time of this review its the only way to own a copy of it on DVD, and being a fan I'd rather have a not so great copy than none at all. Despite the crappy transfer, I do love this film and recommend this bit of old fashioned fun to anyone who find a glimmer joy and inquirey to the words above. Hope you have fun!!!!!",1269302400,98,2137,4.608923884514436

3880977,3,B0029U0ZZY,"This British comedy is a bit of fluff, and enjoyable despite the gray and grainy transfer quality.  There really isn't much to it.  Its essentially a love story  will the lord of the (crumbling) castle finally propose to his hard-working, devoted employee (whom he generally refers to as Boss) or fall for the splashy, rich American who wants to buy his broken-down castle?  Hmmm, hard to guess  its not.  All very predictable.

Not as humorous as it could be, and at times, its rather annoying.  Oddly, it is rather noisy.  Lots of banging and clanging and bagpipes.  I kept turning the volume down more and more.  Some comedic moments fall short.  There is a ghost who ought to be a lot of fun, but isnt.

The always reliable and always enjoyable Margaret Rutherford tries her best, but maybe a little too hard, as the student of Scottish history, especially family trees, who insists the current earl is by rights the true king of Scotland.  Still, she is the best part, as both the earl and the Boss are a bit bland.

Not a bad movie, but not on my list of favorites.  If you feel the need, as I do, to watch every movie of this type, you will not be sorry, but you won't be passing out copies to your friends.",1467936000,2,1214,4.400900900900901

Strangest is the female ghost who appears when guests arrive for a guided tour. She seems to be ""real"" but nobody gets upset or freaks out or calls Ghostbusters.

I enjoyed the fact that it was just a fun rather fluffy story from the 1950s (I guess -- I do wish Amazon Prime Instant Video gave more details about their movies, especially the release date).

While the characters on Downton Abby all want to keep their great house and political power, this older Scottish cousin could care less.  The place is a funky burden where he has been turned into a tour guide.  His valet cannot play the pipes, and the front yard is too small to play golf.  The laird dreams of escaping to Cuba (pre-revolution) with the lovely woman who has helped him keep the house going.  All he has to do is sell it to an American woman who has the money to put another quarter mil into the place to update the mechanicals. The only blocker is a socialist government plan to usurp the land under a legal rule. As a side plot, a nutty lady genealogist believes he is the rightful king of Scotland by lineal descent, and she tries to organize a group to fight for him.  He keeps mentioning that he has some connection to Robert the Bruce, a hero to some and traitor to others.  When she discovers he is not the rightful king of Scotland, it is the last silly tie that he can leave behind.  Love leads the man away from poverty in the ruins.",1407456000,,1195,4.28

Whoever was responsible for producing this crappy DVD should be fired.  0 for not even making the effort.

As for the film, it's based on a play by Alan Melville (who also had a hand in adapting it for the screen).  It is, for the most part, an amusing story of a man and his castle (David Tomlinson as the Earl of Locharne).  He makes do by renting out rooms and foraging for food where he can.  ""What do you shoot around here?""  My neighbor's grouse and creditors if they come in range.""  He also gives guided tours of the place, payment first.  There's a handy ghost on call.  And a daft old lady (Margaret Rutherford) intent on crowning him King of Scotland.  It's insubstantial fare but just amusing enough to entertain.  I bought it primarily for Margaret Rutherford but the rest of the cast is exceptional as well.  It is a funny idea.  It could have been executed better.

3881041,5,B0029U0ZZY,"Old movies are fun.  First of all they're usually devoid of smut that can reduce the enjoyment of a good story and limit what children can watch.  This film was a rollicking lot of fun.  The story is ""almost"" believable and really enjoyable to watch.  Margaret Rutherford provided her usual riotous performance.  Altogether worth watching more than once.  It's sad that they don't make movies like this often today.",1375488000,10,415,4.942028985507246

3881045,4,B0029U0ZZY,"I enjoyed the British humor.  The movie was similar to other British comedies of the 50's, but not as bawdy.  Margaret Rutherford was a hoot, great pre-Marple.  It was an enjoyable movie but the picture quality was not as clear as newer filming techniques.  It is nice to have instant films at the ready, and there was no charge for this one!",1370390400,,342,4.467741935483871
3881046,2,B0029U0ZZY,"The film in itself was quite enjoyable but it was spoilt by the quality of the DVD recording.
I can only equate it to watching a recording made directly from a TV, not via a DVD or VCR but by actually pointing the recording device at the screen whilst the movie was playing. Both the viewing and sound quality were poor.",1369267200,3,320,4.262295081967213

3881048,4,B0029U0ZZY,"very entertaining. Delightful way to spend  an evening.

It has a ruin down castle, A penniless Scottish Lord, His faithful butler and the rich American widow . Oh yes and all the paying guests which are a hoot.

Well worth watching",1367712000,,232,4.609756097560975

3881051,3,B0029U0ZZY,"This is a British comedy about the owner of an old broken down castle. The owner is up to his eyeballs in debt and the place is falling apart. There is a beautiful ghost that makes quite a few appearances in this film and they did it very well. I was impressed at how well they did the ghost given the age of the film. I don't think they could've done the ghost better with today's technology/tricks.

There is much going on as he tries to keep the place afloat by renting rooms (and trying to keep those guests from leaving), giving guided tours to the public (for a fee of course), avoiding creditors who want to claim the place for his debt, trying to convince a woman from Denver to buy the place, while at the same time trying to convince an official from the coal board that the place is unfit to live in so he won't convince the board to take it over for a hostel - and a woman trying to get him declared the rightful King of Scotland. It's fast paced, cute and amusing.

However this old black and white film has seen better days and the picture quality is poor and sometimes a little hard to catch all the lines (due to the accents and that they talk a bit fast). I would like to see this movie remade.",1345766400,4,1211,4.148936170212766
3881052,5,B0029U0ZZY,Another great English comedy!  They really know how to cast a film. Enjoyed the film greatly and will watch it over and over.,1344988800,,125,4.434782608695652
3881053,2,B0029U0ZZY,"Bought this from the United States Amazon site, as although its a funny old British comedy we don't have it for sell here in the United Kingdom only bootleg copies. I wish I had not bothered as the quality is so bad it virtually makes it impossible to watch, I think it was sourced from a 16mm print thats what it looks like anyway. I believe it was released on VHS years ago & as this format has gone the way of the dinosaur(here in the UK anyway) this would have been a better copy to transfer to DVD than this poor quality version available here from Amazon.com",1309910400,4,564,4.231481481481482

8358246,2,B0029U0ZZY,"Watched this on YouTube for free but it was poor quality, very poor. I thought well if I but it from Amazon the quality should be greatly improved...HA I am a fan of Margaret Rutherford and David Tomlinson so I thought why not add this to my collection? $10.00 for the same poor quality I could watch on YouTube for free. Think twice before you buy this one...I have bought other old Brit movies on off labels from Amazon and was pleasantly surprised how clear...this one is one that should be reworked...how sad. If you can tolerate bad quality the movie itself is funny",1521072000,,571,4.5

Pros:

-cast was good
-weird
-random

Cons:
-not the best direction or execution
-predictable (except for the ghost...huh, what?!)

If you like British comedies you will enjoy this (unless you are someone that needs big budget movies).  Watch it because it is something new, not because it is an amazing or unique film (except for the ghost)...did I mention there was a random ghost?
Watch it on Prime, don't pay money for it",1486771200,5,482,5.207792207792208
