8238795,3,B0010W4D64,I liked how the movie began and even the middle was entertaining once the movie started to reveal what was going on and who was misleading who...it got cheesey.  The green glowing smoking couldron underground was cheesey.  The monster who came out of the couldron was cheesey...needless to say when Chole fought the monster it was cheesey.  If they had done a better costume/make up job on the monster I would have enjoyed it better and I do with they had not included a couldron that glowed green with smoke coming out of it.,1296345600,,526,4.574468085106383
