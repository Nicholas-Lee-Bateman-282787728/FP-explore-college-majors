8191815,4,B000PITGI4,One of the few DVDs out there that cover solo canoeing.  Paddling a canoe solo is an entirely different animal than paddling tandem.  Proper strokes and technique are very important.  I am a visual learner so this type of instruction is valuable to me.  There is not much solo paddling information out there so this is an important find.  I learned quite a bit from this video.,1448236800,,377,4.567164179104478

8191817,5,B000PITGI4,"I've had this book a few years now. I found it very helpful in learning to select, use, and equip a solo canoe. I often take extended trips into the Boundary Waters Cliff Jacobson's books, like this one, were a good place to start learning to live comfortably with a canoe.",1384819200,,273,4.372549019607843
8191818,4,B000PITGI4,"This video is good and touches on a lot of different things regarding solo canoeing.  Things from canoes, very basic paddle stokes, what to wear in differnt climates when canoeing and simple outfitting your canoe.  But he only touches on these areas and would have liked much more detail and info.  This video is like taking a beginners solo canoe class.  It's great and fun but your ready for more.  The video quality is excellent.  I would recommend this video for anyone just starting out in canoeing regardless if solo or tandem.",1314057600,,533,4.739130434782608
8191819,5,B000PITGI4,"if you are into solo tripping, solo canoeing, or anything close...I suppose you have to get this one.

Informative, a bit elemental, and I wish more time was spent on paddling loaded boats - empty canoes are fine for paddles within sight of shore...but I guess it's hard to cover everything.",1258588800,,291,4.705882352941177
8191820,5,B000PITGI4,"This a great ""How-To"" DVD for those at a beginning level in a solo canoe.  It is straight forward, in simple language, and presented in bite-size pieces.

If you want to learn to solo canoe, get this DVD.",1182124800,5,204,4.342105263157895
