8450328,5,B004ZQJ5C4,I was very pleased with this film. I have watched it several times and enjoy it and see more each time. I highly recommend it...,1313712000,,128,4.16
8450329,4,B004ZQJ5C4,"The movie is at once beautifully filmed, smartly directed, and certainly well acted. And the writing is very clever. But two things stand out above all else. Firstly, it is scary. VERY scary. And funny. There are moments of much needed laughter that work on every level. The ending threw me for such a loop. I never saw it coming. The film's acting standouts include Wolfgang Bodison (""A Few Good Men"", ""Akeelah And The Bee""), Will Wallace (""The Thin Red Line"", ""I Am Sam""), Oscar Torre (""Caine"", ""Libertad""), and relative newcomers Kyrie Maezumi, Francesca Brown, and Cazzy Golomb. Meazumi (known for her work on the daytime drama series ""Passions"") and Golomb play sisters who are at once beautiful and alternately disarming and vague throughout. Maezumi is such a fine actor that she pulls off a subtlety of character that is brilliant in its scope. A lesser actress would have likely gone over the top in the portrayal of the troubled Ari, the daughter of a serial killer trying to deal with her horrid past. The character certainly is unique, and Ms. Maezumi plays her with a tone of indifference which had me questioning her, mistrusting her, then loving her, throughout this roller-coaster ride of a story. It all comes together on screen in a way that left my partner and I talking about her performance for hours afterward. Ms. Golomb was equally unnerving in her portrayal of the younger sister who starts off as a sickeningly sweet stereo-type before morphing into a wonderfully deviant profile in manipulation. The chemistry between these fine actresses makes the film much more than a thrill piece. It truly is a fun throwback to the Hitchcock school of suspense. Very little blood, very high intensity. Ms. Brown, a knockout and hugely talented british actress, plays Tandi Lewis, a no nonsense Shock Journalist with a quick wit that leaves everyone she encounters a bit worse for wear. The character of Rick Larsen, the hapless sheriff pulled into a storm of bad news by a hot younger woman, is played with a fine flare by Will Wallace. The true tragic figure here, Wallace has a field day portraying a guy who's soul is far more tortured than even he is aware. But its Wolfgang Bodison who is the film's true high point on the acting end. He comes in late, yet manages to almost steal the show as a charming yet all business FBI agent bent on covering his boss's inexperience by leading the charge to find the killer, all the while adding a humor and poise that shine bright. His boss, played by Alisa Schulz, a ""Cosmic Radio"" alum, has such a powerful underlining vulnerability that you are left pulling for her even when it's clear she is on shaky ground and in way over her head in the investigation. Its hard to review this film without giving away too much of the ending, but I will say this: Legacy is deserving of attention from all lovers of suspense. It pulls you in, scares the hell out of you, then drops you on your head with a twist ending that leaves your jaw in your lap. Really great indie filmmaking, and Mr. Savage is a director well on his way to greatness. After viewing a few of his works now at film festivals and premieres, my opinion stands firm. He just gets better with every film.",1311638400,2,3223,4.656140350877193
8450330,4,B004ZQJ5C4,"Wow. Finally available on DVD. Sweet! I saw this movie at a film festival in California in a packed theater having no idea what to expect. As an ex freelance film critic I know how to follow a festival crowd to the best films. There seemed to be a lot of buzz around the film, and as I had seen another cool indie film by this director at the Palm Springs International Film Festival a couple of years back, I decided to check it out.  The first five minutes of Legacy were enough to show that I was in for something creepy. Not gory-slasher creepy. But scary creepy. But the same time, the cinematography was so beautiful, and the music so haunting, I instantly knew I was in for something a cut above the average indie thriller.  As a fan of indie filmmaking and filmmakers, and as a person who attends a lot of big and small film festivals worldwide, I will say this film stands alone in an old school Hitchcock like way. Not so much bloody as just plane edge of your seat scary. The audience I was with was jumping every few minutes. Me jumping the highest I think. A real who-done-it.  So many suspects. So hard to nail down the killer. And the twist at the end had everyone gasping ""No Way!!"" This is just a cool movie all around. I want to be scared and baffled by a mystery thriller, not grossed out every moment. Legacy is exceptionally well written, perfectly acted (an amazing cast of recognizable faces and new comers alike), and beautifully photographed. The dialog is smart and at times really funny. Some much needed comic relief helps make this a truly fun film. Not a big budget Hollywood masterpiece, but  much better than 90% of the indie films I see on netflix or iTunes. Good stuff!!!",1311638400,2,1705,4.420382165605096
