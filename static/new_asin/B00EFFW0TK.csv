5911505,5,B00EFFW0TK,Great Story,1465862400,,11,5.0
5911506,5,B00EFFW0TK,Good acting.....good story line.,1461283200,,32,7.25
5911507,5,B00EFFW0TK,Wonderfully acted and meticulously costumed and staged. Plummer and Langella are especially good. The use of actual footage of Ali lends a great mood to the film. This is an intimate and insightful look at the inner workings of the Supreme Court during a very explosive and fragmented period in our history. I remember these events well and this movie does justice to them.,1447632000,2,373,4.84375
5911508,5,B00EFFW0TK,"A truly excellent film, it depicts the events with great clarity and fairness and manages to involve the viewer emotions.",1440806400,,121,5.1

5911510,5,B00EFFW0TK,"I remember what happen and the injustice and waiting for a final answer from the Supreme Court.
How politicians can screw up the lives of citizens with no accountability",1436400000,,169,4.862068965517241
5911511,5,B00EFFW0TK,"Great behind-the-scenes look at the SCOTUS judges and of the legal arguments for this particular case.  The editing, including the footage of Ali and of the events taking place during that time period adds to the tone and allows the viewer to become even more vested into the goings-on that influence the judges' decisions.  Unfortunate how politics sometimes rears its head into certain judicial decisions.  Highly recommend this movie to fans of the law and fans of Ali.",1435968000,2,472,5.0256410256410255
5911512,5,B00EFFW0TK,This was a great movie.  Enjoyed it.  It brought sports and law together.,1435363200,,73,4.538461538461538
5911513,5,B00EFFW0TK,"Excellent movie that really gives you an inside look at how judges and the Supreme Court Justices think, change their minds, write opinions...and even are swayed by public opinion sometimes. Even more so, it shows just how much their law clerks influence their decision-making and voting. I loved that it uses real footage of Ali. Upon refreshing my memory of each of the justices, I think the movie was spot on with casting. An inspiring and excellent movie all the way around.",1433635200,3,478,4.841463414634147
5911514,5,B00EFFW0TK,"Seeing Christopher Plummer play my real-life grandfather, Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan, is nothing short of a thrill. The movie is a slow burn but builds very effectively and gives insight into why the law is so important in the U.S.",1419206400,4,247,4.904761904761905
5911515,5,B00EFFW0TK,Great movie!,1413158400,,12,5.5
5911516,4,B00EFFW0TK,"I'm a Supreme Court buff. I just watched this movie last night, quite a while after its release, because I guess HBO didn't promote it that much. Is this too arcane or difficult for non-lawyers? The answer is definitely ""no."" They do a good job of handholding the audience to introduce them to the few aspects of court procedure that need to be explained and how things work, etc. If anything, it's a little ""dumbed down,"" but I appreciate that while I didn't need the dumbing down, plenty of other people DO, so I'm fine with it.  They did a great job of highlighting the justices' character traits, though they are a bit TOO much of a caricature of the actual men.  Sadly, the only one they did a BAD job of representing was Hugo Black, who strove to be every bit as apolitical as Harlan did. He was a lot more clever and charming than they make him out to be here. Many of the justices' signature lines or quirks make it into the script, showing that they did their homework but made it accessible. In the end, they probably picked a bad case to highlight because it didn't make real lasting precedent like so many of the other cases did. The drama of the minority/dissent becoming a unanimous majority opinion happened even more famously in Brown v. Board of Education. That was going to be 5/4 in favor of continuing legal segregation until the chief justice had a stroke, died, was replaced by Earl Warren, and the case was reargued the next year. Many other case (Roe v. Wade among them, which is actually discussed in this movie) were far more important cases. There are a few moments that are just over-the-top corny (clerk: you changed your mind? Harlan: No..no...you changed MY mind.). That said, if people know nothing about the court, the movie is important for showing that the court is made up of real people, that they grapple with questions that are difficult, and that the personalities on the court have been, at times in our history, every bit as interesting as the life or personality of presidents.",1409097600,4,2020,4.577348066298343
5911517,5,B00EFFW0TK,"I liked this, in particular, because it illustrates how the US Supreme Court works behind the scenes.  I use it in the constitutional law class I teach for that purpose.  Although the justices involved are played by actors, the footage of Muhammad Ali is of him in person!",1408406400,,272,4.645833333333333
5911518,5,B00EFFW0TK,Muhammad Ali's Greatest Fight is one of the best movie's I've ever watched.  This one is a keeper.  The editing was superb.  I learned so much from this historical work done in a way that was entertaining and educational.,1408233600,,221,4.615384615384615
5911519,5,B00EFFW0TK,"One of the best I've seen in a while, certainly about the US Supreme Court.  Some really great performances, fine writing, etc.",1403308800,,127,4.7727272727272725
5911520,5,B00EFFW0TK,Great service.  Amazing movie!  Very interesting movie that shows the inter -workings of the US Supreme Court.  Good gift for history buffs or those interested in Constitutional Law.,1401580800,,182,5.428571428571429
5911521,5,B00EFFW0TK,"A moving story, beautifully told by a perfect cast.  Christopher Plummer and Frank Langella
are perfection!!!! I've watched it five times on HBO and now have purchased it.",1401235200,,171,5.107142857142857
5911522,4,B00EFFW0TK,Great acting and compelling story about racism in a changing time. The movie mixed clips of Ali and the scripted dialogue well.,1397692800,,127,4.818181818181818
5911523,5,B00EFFW0TK,"Fine acting, good direction - never apparent nor showy. This is a very good film. A must see so that one can learn about both the issue presented to the court and how the arguments went to get to the final decision. Plummer and Longella at the top of their game.",1397260800,6,262,4.1568627450980395
5911524,5,B00EFFW0TK,This made for TV movie had a great cast and told an even greater story.  It provided a behind-the scenes view of the Supreme Court.  The cinematography was beautiful and the acting was top notch.  It was fascinating to see the scenes play out of the Nixon era 40+ years later.  Don't miss this one; it is enjoyable on many levels.,1395705600,8,330,4.360655737704918
8605083,5,B00EFFW0TK,I enjoyed the film.,1514505600,,19,4.0
8605084,4,B00EFFW0TK,Intercut with actual footage of Ali doing his things this tells the stories of Supreme Court Justices as they argue among themselves as to what actually they think that the law actually means as it pertains to Ali and being a conscious objector and unwilling to fight in a war he felt was unjust and against his religion. His beliefs were questioned as if the judicial system could open up his heart and could determine his actual position. Insightful and frustrating to see 'sausage being made'. Some swearing.,1510444800,,511,4.818181818181818
8605085,4,B00EFFW0TK,This movie was done in pretty good taste and the director takes you inside the Supreme Court. And shows how the decision to over turn Muhammad Ali's case proved to be a turning point in his career and life. I'm not sure how accurate the story is but it all took place during the Nixon administration. Not a bad story.,1504051200,,317,4.3
8605086,5,B00EFFW0TK,Very satisfied.,1490572800,,15,7.0
8605087,5,B00EFFW0TK,"provides incite into how the supreme court works. also presents Islam in a positive way. Muhammed Ali was not only a great boxer, he was, even as a young man, very intelligent, and willing to sacrifice his freedom, career and  the money he could have made in his peak years, to stand up for his morals and religious beliefs  and help other people in the future retain their rights and freedoms.",1476662400,,394,4.535211267605634
8605088,5,B00EFFW0TK,"Excellent movie. A peek inside this nations ""greatest"" as well as SCOTUS with a dash of drama.",1474156800,,94,4.588235294117647
8605089,4,B00EFFW0TK,"Procedural, with several great performances, and with a window into a landmark decision that almost wasn't. I enjoyed the film though the pacing is a bit slow. The title is a bit of a misnomer, as Ali is not present in the film except for a few (real) vintage news clips. The film totally focuses on the backroom wrestling between clerks and justices over the case. It's worth watching once.",1470268800,,391,4.6
8605090,5,B00EFFW0TK,Love it!,1469404800,,8,3.5
8605091,3,B00EFFW0TK,The authors tell Ali's legal battle with the government over his conscientious objector decision well.  My disappointment is that the screenplay for the film does not take much from the book.  The book only summarizes how the screenplay acquired information about the caucuses of the Supreme Court judges and how their minds were changed through their interaction.,1468800000,,364,5.368421052631579
8605092,5,B00EFFW0TK,This is a wonderful lesson in American history.  It should be shown in schools to show how the Supreme Court works. .,1467590400,,117,4.318181818181818
