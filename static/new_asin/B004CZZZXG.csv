8629214,2,B004CZZZXG,"""Charge of the Lancers"" is a 1954 Technicolor film concerned with the Crimean War. The War took place from 1853 to 1856 between the Russians and an allied force of French, British, and Ottoman forces. Historians consider it the first ""modern war"" for the tactical use of railways and telegraphs, and for the introduction of modern nursing procedures by Florence Nightingale.

The most famous film about the Crimean War is Errol Flynn's ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"", based on the epic poem by Tennyson.

The film stars Jean Pierre Aumont, Paulette Goddard, and Richard Stapley.

Paulette Goddard (1910-90) was best known as the wife of Charlie Chaplin and his co-star in ""Modern Times"" (1936). She was nominated for an Oscar for ""So Proudly we Hail"" (1943) but her screen roles diminished after that, and this film was her last big screen appearance for nearly 10 years. She plays a gypsy who helps the allies, although at 44 she was getting a little old to be playing a ""gypsy girl"".

Jean Pierre Aumont (1911-2001) was a debonair French actor who appeared in more than 150 films between 1931 and 1996. He was active in the US in the 40s and 50s. He plays a French officer who tries to rescue his British friend who has been kidnapped by the Russians.

Richard Wyler (aka Richard Stapley) plays the British officer who is in possession of the plans for a super canon that can knock down the Russian walls and change the outcome of the war. Wyler made some 30+ films between 1948 and 1978.

Director William Castle (1914-77) made 50+ films between 1943 and 1974, the most well known include ""The House on Haunted Hill"" (1959) and ""The Tingler"" (1959).

The NY Times called it ""an all too typical Columbia ""B"" adventure film ... with inexpensive sets, fading stars, and miles of stock footage."" Indeed, only the bright Technicolor stands out.

The top grossing films in 1954 were ""White Christmas"", ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"", ""Rear Window"", ""Carmen Jones"", and ""The Caine Mutiny"". Bogart had 2 films in the top 10 as did Bing Crosby. The big Oscar winner was ""On the Waterfront"" (Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actress). Other notable films released that year were ""Dial M for Murder"", ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon"", ""Godzilla"", ""The High and the Mighty"" and ""Johnny Guitar"".

The acting is good enough for a B action film and the Technicolor is certainly vivid, as it was in many early 50s productions. But the enemy is one dimensional and cardboard cutouts, and the cast of dozens is certainly not impressive when the attacks come.",1312416000,3,2554,4.7995444191343966
