7888635,1,6305371873,"After the success of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Chow Yun Fat has truly become one of the hottest acting commodities not only in the United States and Asia but across the globe as well. But with this great fame there are many money grubbing executive pushers that are literally taking food out of his mouth. By selling these cheap, horrible transfer movies (Most that are not really Chow Yun Fat movies to begin with) these companies are not only tarnishing the integrity of CYF star but are disrespecting and confusing the viewer as well. How the heck are you going to take a forgotten hong kong flick, splice in short Chow Yun Fat footage from another movie, then call it Hong Kong Corruptor? Chow should really consider suing these a@#holes! I don't even think that Chow is aware what is going on. Well in behalf of Chow Yun Fat and his fans BEWARE!!!",1027209600,,857,4.607843137254902
7888636,1,6305371873,"I have to get the word out there to warn the public about these arena titles. They are trying to bank off of the American Success of John Woo, Chow Yun Fat and Jet Li. Let me review them in a few steps.
#1. Some of  the titles aren't even John Woo or Chow Yun Fat films. The one called 'Hong  Kong Corruptor' (banking off the success of the Corruptor), is actually an  Alan Tam film entitled 'Return Engagement' (a better tomorrow ripoff) with  an unrelated Chow Yun Fat scene from another film pointlessly edited in.  This one 'Hong Kong Face Off' (key words FACE OFF), i cannot place. I know  John Woo's filmography and I can't place this one (if anyone can tell me  the real title, please mail me). John Woo's directorial debut 'Hand Of  Death' was released on Arena home video as 'Strike Of Death', and banks  more on the apperance of Jackie Chan (only a minor character in the film,  but takes over the cover of the box). so all in all, point #1- the films  don't really match.
#2- Extremely poor quality. I purchased 'Strike Of  Death, and master copy it was from must have been warped. The picture  quality was horrbile. Another one I bought 'Shanghai Killer' was a HK tv  movie called 'The Bund'. this one was just cheesy tv fare, with nothing  good but the laughs. Another was an early CYF film called 'Blodd money'  under another title, which had subtitles, but the film was a pan and scan  version, so the subtitles were totally chopped off throughout the whole  film, leaving it indecipherable.
The only one purchased that was decent  quality and a fun movie to own was under the Arena title 'Killers Two',  which was pawning itself off as a sequel to the killer (how?). It is  actually a very early 80's film called 'Heroic Cops', with a stickly thin  Yun-Fat, and Danny lee sporting flare pants and horrid haircuts. This film  is only good for unintentional laughs, and the Cantonese Version of  'Stayin' Alive""!
All in all, Beware these Arena Titles. I stopped  buying them. It's better to get the HK version.
Ps- the reviewer below  was reviewing 'The Corruptor' not 'Hong Kong Corruptor', i don't want  people to get confused!",949276800,,2143,4.541884816753926
