3702719,5,B001MYIQMM,"A interesting documentry into the current politics and goings on behind the scenes of the retro banked track sport known as Roller Derby.  The story is sad yet inspiring.  One can only root for former Bay City Bomber owner Tim Patten for putting his life savings and much of his free personal time in bringing a sport he and many loved, and keeping Roller Derby going as long as he did!",1239494400,5,386,4.422535211267606
8322437,5,B001MYIQMM,"Nobody tells it like Tim Patten. He's America's original male Roller Derby bombshell with the knowhow to tell a story of it all. From describing the thunder and vibration of rolling wheels on the banked track to the sweaty locker rooms where skaters told their deepest darkest secrets.

Being a life long skater and Roller Derby coach, I have to own and read everything Tim writes.  Bravo again my mentor..and thank you.

8322439,3,B001MYIQMM,"My roller derby league is a member of WFTDA, which is nothing like the theatrical, banked, old school derby in this film.  That said, it's important to know the history behind Flat Track derby, and this film does that fairly well.  And there's one common bond shared by all involved in derby, no matter the format.  And that's the passion for the sport.",1387152000,,353,4.571428571428571
8322440,4,B001MYIQMM,"Extremely interesting documentary. Watch as a fan, along with several 1970's Roller Derby stars try to revive the sport. It's a true labor of love. An Ann Calvello interview is a great bonus feature.",1362960000,,199,4.882352941176471
8322441,1,B001MYIQMM,"I'm not sure why people are giving this movie good reviews, it was terrible. I would gladly pay someone to take this DVD off my hands. It nearly turned me off of roller derby. It's basically about a lot of washed up druggies and focuses more on men's roller derby than anything else. Even that makes it sound more interesting than it is. Trust me, it's bad. I want that hour and a half of my life back.",1284681600,,402,4.166666666666667
8322442,5,B001MYIQMM,Very interesting insight into the world of roller derby. Whether you're part of the modern flat track movement or old school derby - it's a must see,1253232000,2,148,4.518518518518518
8322443,4,B001MYIQMM,"Jam (Mark Woollen, 2006)

There were two movies entitled Jam released in 2006. I actually thought I was getting the Craig Serling traffic-accident flick when I fired off a request for this one, but what I got instead was Mark Woollen's documentary on the attempt to recapture the glory days of roller derby circa 2002. (The attempt, it should be noted, is still going on as I write this; Cleveland has its own team, the Burning River Roller Girls, and it's certainly not the only city in the midwest that does.)

Thanks to both the nostalgia-based subject matter and the sense of desperation that pervades the lives of the subjects, this reminds me a great deal of Chasing Ghosts, the documentary about videogame superstars. With roller derby having had its heyday in the sixties and early seventies, however, the former stars to be found here are older, and thus even more pathetic than those in the other film. I use the word ""pathetic"" here not only in its current comic sense, but also in the original sense of pathos; while you're both laughing at and pitying these people, you have to admire the kind of tenacity that will cause people to bang their heads against a wall for thirty-plus years in the face of complete public indifference. (Especially since the rise in popularity of roller derby that seemed impossible a few years ago does seem to be getting underway.)

This is one of those movies where all the filmmaker really had to do was get out of the way and let the subjects do their own work, and it's amply done here. Well worth your time. *** ",1248739200,,1560,4.620938628158845
8322444,5,B001MYIQMM,"Jam follows an eclectic group of middle-aged roller derby stars on a seven-year comeback odyssey. For those unfamiliar with televised roller derby's format during the 60s and 70s, this uniquely American art form, with its scripted story lines and choreographed stunts, combines elements of 19th-century melodrama with roller skating action.  Two teams, one heroically playing by the rules, the other wickedly cheating at every opportunity, enact live theatre while skating on a banked track. Roller derby fans cheer the good guys and boo the villains, making this a truly interactive entertainment.

Inspiring, poignant, and hilarious, the film captures a certain quirky ""only in San Francisco"" sensibility as it chronicles the colorful lives of fiercely determined skaters as they doggedly pursue their roller derby dreams.",1245628800,,824,5.637096774193548
8322445,4,B001MYIQMM,"This documentary is a must-see for roller derby fans everywhere! It is an informative look into the roller derby of the past. It provides insight into the sport, its origins, and allows viewers to appreciate the effort involved in the ""comeback"" of derby today. It is quite moving to see Tim's dedication and passion for the sport, despite his experiences with significant obstacles along the way.",1244764800,,397,5.03030303030303
8322446,5,B001MYIQMM,"Jam is a must see for any roller derby fan or roller derby skater. The story is inspiring, it shows what one is willing to do to keep their dream alive and to keep them feeling alive.",1241740800,3,183,3.972972972972973
