1192864,5,B000006C20,"This is one of Li's best martial arts films I have seen.  This time, Li's character, Fong Sai Yuk not only provides comedic elements on screen, but also brings along his sidekick mother who blends comedy with high-kicking  martial arts.  This film is not to be missed if you like the Once Upon a  Time in China Series.  Li's display of his martial arts skills in this film  is wickedly entertaining if you are a true action fan.  Li is no doubt a  rare martial arts phenomenon since Bruce Lee...I highly recommend this film  to all action fans...and if you think you don't get enough of Jet, check  out Fong Sai Yuk II in which he also stars with of course his sidekick mom.",932256000,,674,4.362903225806452
7904045,5,B000006C20,"Fong Sai Yuk I&II were the first 2 HK movies I saw, though an accident of video recording meant that I had to wait at least a year to see the beginning of Pt I and the end of Pt II. Even in incomplete form, the two films were enough to make me an instant fan of HK Cinema (after years of disappointment with the Hollywood fare I'd been exposed to). I think they're possibly the best introduction to the territory's movie industry there could be... if you don't love Fong Sai Yuk, chances are Hong Kong Cinema is not the cinema for you. It's a rare example of everything coming together, if not perfectly then at least very well.
The solid script from Jeff Lau is the anchor without which the movie would not have succeeded. In typical Jeff Lau style it bounces all over the place, from stupid comedy to high (melo)drama via a little romance and the obligatory gender confusions, and of course leading into the incredibly imaginitive action sequences choreographed by director Corey Yuen and former opera brother Yuen Tak.
The production values for the movie are very high, if not quite as slick as the Once Upon A Time In China movies they clearly aspire to emulating. Ann Hui is credited as Production Designer here, a rare role for the critically adored director. The cinematography from Jingle Ma is top notch, framing the luscious sets and costumes and the action very well. The soundtrack from James Wong (with regular partner Romeo Diaz) seems a little too close to his score for OUATIC in places, but mostly does a commendable job.
Jet Li has said that Fong Sai Yuk is the character that most closely resembles his real personality from all those he's played. From the small time I've spent in Jet's company I'm not sure his self-image is entirely accurate, but he's probably in a better position to judge than me Certainly Fong Sai Yuk is a very likeable chap the way Jet plays him, and you can tell Jet was 100% into the character and the project. Despite this, the show is unequivocally stolen by Josephine Siao Fong-Fong as Fong Sai Yuk's kung fu fighting mother. She plays her character to perfection, showing a fantastic knack for comedy which I'm not sure she ever got to display in her roles when she was ""in her prime"" and also kicking ass in . Sibelle Hu also steals a fair amount of screen as the mother of Fong Sai Yuk's love interest (the beautiful Michelle Reis), and wife of semi-villain Tiger Lui (Chan Chung-Yung?), who also shines with an affably overstated performance. Of all the cast, Fong Sai Yuk's father (Paul Chu Kong?) is probably the only one whose performance is rather weak and forgettable. Main villain Chiu Man Cheuk is conspicuously far more charismatic and convincing than in any other movie he's been in apart from The Blade.
Fong Sai Yuk could be described as a light-hearted riff on the wire-fu wave launched by Once Upon A Time In China. Certainly humour is brought to the front here whilst the politics is pushed quite far to the back. Hong Kong humour can be an acquired taste, and the jokes sometimes fall flat in Fong Sai Yuk. Jeff Lau's jokes are generally a bit hit or miss, but he aims so wide that it's not surprising. There are some genuinely funny moments though.
When it comes down to it, the action scenes are what really got me hooked when I saw the movies though. Since Tsui Hark raised the bar several notches above anything people had imagined possible for fight scenes when he made Once Upon A Time In China, the Hong Kong choreographers had been engaged in a battle to see who could produce the most inventive and outlandish action scenes. The best of the bunch tended to be in Jet Li's movies, and the fights in Fong Sai Yuk are fine examples of HK creativity. Purists will no doubt cry that the fight scenes rely too heavily on wires, editing and stunt doubles, but I'm sure that Bruce Lee's statement about missing all that heavenly glory applies here. Grandly conceived if not flawlessly executed, the fights in Fong Sai Yuk were especially impressive to these innocent eyes that had never seen action Hong Kong style before. ""How the? What the? Did they just?"" etc etc. I wish they'd spent just a little bit more time tightening up the camera angles and hiding the obvious doubles better, but I can't fault them for ambition. I think the movie won the ""best action"" award that year, which is pretty impressive for a HK movie made in 1993, the year the new wave style reached its peak.
Fong Sai Yuk is definitely a movie that has a special place in many fans hearts, even though it does have too many mis-fired jokes and rough edges to be called a true masterpiece. Still a must see for any fan of Hong Kong cinema though, a wonderfully representative example of what makes it so special and unique ....",1043971200,7,4769,4.552968568102445
7904046,5,B000006C20,"""Fong Sai Yuk"" is one of my new favorite Kung-fu flicks.  It has all of the elements necessary for the genre (Great fighting, charming hero, winsome heroine, secret societies, justice, cross-dressing mother who seduces the mother of her sons bride-to-be).  It's all here, and the whole package is put together with style.
As an additional element, ""Fong Sai Yuk"" is hilarious.  (Intentionally hilarious, to boot.  Sometimes Kung-fu films are funny for the wrong reason, but the translation is good and the comedy works here.)  There is some very funny slapstick and mistaken-identity humor.  I was cracking up.
If you like Hong Kong Kung-fu, your collection is not complete until you have seen ""Fong Sai Yuk.""  It is really good.",1015200000,3,729,5.07563025210084
7904047,5,B000006C20,"This is definatly my favouraite Jet Li movie and maybe my favouratie all time movie ! Amazing stunts make the movie.. and it also manages to be quite humerous as well.
A DEFINATE buy. Get it now !",1000684800,,196,4.184210526315789
7904048,5,B000006C20,"""Fong Sai Yuk 1 & 2"" are both filled with Jet Li's most impressive wire-work and kung-fu performances. Unbelievable wire scenes are heightened beyond the sky by Jet Li's graceful and yet powerful kick-[butt] kung-fu.
Sound, choreography, and acting are superb. As usual, Jet Li always manages to stun his audience with a smashing performance filled with passion and unbelievable kung-fu moves. The plot is touching to any audience, for in the first ""Fong Sai Yuk"", Jet Li fights for his father, and in the second, he fights for his mother. Shockingly creative fight scenes that will blow your mind.
BTW, the sequel ""Fong Sai Yuk II"" is a must-buy, for Chiu Mun Chuk (can't spell his name) and Jet Li dual at the end to hit the ""top kung-fu scenes"" list.",993686400,,753,4.712121212121212
7904049,5,B000006C20,"This is probably Jet Li's best movie!  A must by for all Martial Arts Fanatics.  The story is hilarious and the action, though a little subtle compared to other Jet Li films, is AWESOME.  This is a tale of the beginnings of one of the legendary Canton Tigers.  Check it out!",983318400,,274,4.313725490196078
7904050,5,B000006C20,"This is another one of Jet Li's masterpieces(which he has so many of) and has some very origional fight scenes throughout. Chiu Man-Chiuek is a great bad guy in the movie and you'll never get board of the FEI-HUNG vs. FEI-HUNG  matchups. While many people will say this is the best of the series I would  have to say the escond is the superior one,but this is an excellent start  to lead you through the bad boy sequel. Get them both if you can,these two  movies can just about account for all 6 OUATIC movies combined,but are much  harder to find.",959558400,2,548,4.3861386138613865

7904052,5,B000006C20,"This movie is one of the best Martial-arts movies ever. Jet Li displayed his awesome athletic ability and wushu wizardry against another master of martial arts, Chu Man Cheuk (Zhao Wen Zhou). If you never watched any Jet  Li movies before, start with this one, or if you're a hardcore fan like me,  you'll definitely enjoy Fong Sai Yuk.",943920000,4,336,4.677966101694915
