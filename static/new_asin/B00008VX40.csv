She (and I) both wanted to see the tubbies doing their story-thing, and this dvd was a waste of time. 'Here Come The Teletubbies' is much better - I bought that one too.",1071619200,6,356,3.9583333333333335
1862774,5,B00008VX40,"This Teletubbies is a step above the rest of their videos. It copies the TV show very well with colors, numbers, shapes, and many different things to look at. All their other videos step away from the PBS format and leave out the standard counting, colors, numbers and games. This one puts it all in there plus much more. There are lots of segments with children, the Teletubbies playing outside, and dancing. My 3 year old (with autism) is captivated by this DVD all the way through and the others she only watches for 15 minutes tops. Besides you can't beat the quality of this DVD. I've never seen such bright colors! It's a real find. Highly recommended.",1054771200,30,658,4.584745762711864

7987235,5,B00008VX40,"If you have a small child in the family you must introduce them to the Teletubbies.  My grandson is three and still enjoys them.  His sisters however, who are six and nine, groan when the tape is played. Very innocent fun play with lots of repeats which little ones love.",1395792000,,271,4.4
7987236,5,B00008VX40,"My granddaughter is a gret fanatic of teletubbies and this dvd did the trick, she loved it! have to get her more!!",1375920000,,114,4.2272727272727275
7987237,1,B00008VX40,"I never received this so I can't rate it but if it is as bad as the other one I bought, it probably wouldn't have been any good, anyway.  Again, I was too busy with the holidays to bother to send back and paperwork was misplaced.....",1367366400,,233,4.065217391304348
7987238,4,B00008VX40,"My son recently saw a teletubbies video on youtube and instantly fell in love with the show. Since teletubbies is no longer aired in the US, I searched my local retail stores for a DVD to no avail. We ordered this and several other teletubbies DVDs off Amazon.com and my son was a very happy camper. Great, kid friendly show. I would recommend this to anyone with small children.",1359417600,,379,4.507246376811594
7987239,1,B00008VX40,"My 21-month-old loves the Teletubbies and it's the only TV she watches (we limit TV viewing).  This DVD is boring, too simple, and my daughter asked us to fast forward through all but one segment.  I recommend Here Come the Teletubbies (her favorite), All Together Teletubbies or Naughty Noo-Noo.  She also found ""Look!"" boring.  We haven't seen any of the others.",1164067200,,364,4.918032786885246
7987240,5,B00008VX40,"""Look"" is a simple, yet engaging program for toddlers.  I see one reviewer felt this DVD compared unfavorably to other Teletubbies selections because of its plainness, but I think there's a place for plainness with viewers that young.  They don't need a great lot of stimulation at this age.  I've watched this several times with my two-year-old, and I think its perfect in its way.

Also - the ""Little Bo Peep"" stop-action animated bonus feature is *very* charming, including a turn-of-the-century Bo Peep, a flock of Cockney sheep, and an adorable lamb that trails behind them as they search for each other through the Teletubby landscape.  Worth the cost for this feature alone.",1149811200,5,681,4.991150442477876
7987241,1,B00008VX40,"There are several good teletubby DVDs, such as ""here come"" and ""funny day"", that have unique skits and stories.  A lot of this DVD is just teletubbies dancing on against a solid-colored, blank backdrop.",1128816000,,202,4.9411764705882355
7987242,5,B00008VX40,"With its bright colors and plenty of 'Teletubbies Everywhere', this DVD is a hit with the Teletubby lover in our household.
Much like the PBS show, the opening 'Teletubbies Everywhere' segments are chock full of colors, counting, shapes and appearing/disappearing Tubbies.  Highlights for us include the segment with the Tubbies discovering the mirror outside in Teletubbyland...really good for giggling.  And we also enjoy the video segment with children from England taking photos in the park...the one little girl is so bossy, yet so funny!
If you have a Teletubby fan at your house, you will not be disappointed with this DVD.  Enjoy!",1078876800,10,638,5.235294117647059
