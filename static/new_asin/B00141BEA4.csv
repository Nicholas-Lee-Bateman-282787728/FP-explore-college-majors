3121756,5,B00141BEA4,"The Zildjian Company launched another ""Mission"" from Gadd North American clinic tour giving drummers an opportunity to share Steve Gadd's humility, generosity and creative genius ; On this DVD, Steve is featured in a intimate master-class setting at the Manhattan School of Music in May 2006. For all the fans of Steve ( and others ), the wisdom'Steve is always a treasure ! Everything from Steve is there : funk patterns, rudiments applied to the kit, playing with a click, tips for the studio, brush patterns, odd phrases, Mozambique/Latin ideas ... Wonderful !!! The extensive question-and-andswer allow Steve to discuss several of his legendary performances ( Aja, Nite Sprite, 50 ways to leave your lover ... ). There are also solo pieces that contain the essential tools and technique with his incredibly influencial style and approach ; As I said before, indispensable and essential, Emilio ( France ).",1214784000,2,909,5.148648648648648
3121757,5,B00141BEA4,"I, too, am a drumming DVD junkie and loved this one! I have nearly all of Steve's other DVDs and would rate this the best of the lot. Steve is an amazingly humble guy who listens carefully to the questions from his audience, but he is also great at explaining and demonstrating his techniques and style. I got a LOT from this video and highly recommend it. You know, every drummer worth his salt tries to learn the drum parts to ""50 Ways to Leave Your Lover,"" and ""Aja"" and it is nice to see them demonstrated here (and easily seen from the camera setup), and, indeed, he makes it all look so effortless. Thanks Hudson Music and Steve Gadd!",1213833600,8,640,4.341666666666667
3121758,5,B00141BEA4,"This is an exceptional DVD, but like every thing about Steve Gadd, it's hard to ""put a finger"" on the exact reason.  Perhaps it's because you can't help but like this true master who is unbelievably humble.  Perhaps it's because his drumming ALWAYS sounds so great, even his ""simple"" stuff sounds fabulous.  ESPECIALLY his simple stuff sounds great (how does he do it?).  Maybe it's the way he make everything look so easy.... total effortlessness.  Perhaps only about 1/2 of this DVD includes any playing from Steve (though there is more in the extra features section), the rest is a question answer session with the audience.  I'm an instructional DVD junkie.  Of about 18 DVDs on drums and percussion, this will be on the top shelf.  Great inspiration and just plain enjoyment watching this ""one-of-a-kind"" drummer.",1207353600,14,818,4.963235294117647
3121759,5,B00141BEA4,"I attended the 2005 leg of this clinic in Phoenix. Before the clinic began, Steve took the time to meet every person waiting in a long, long line to see him. When it was my turn to meet him, he looked me in the eye, asked me questions, and listened to me intently. He also signed the bottom of my K Custom Session ride cymbal (from the line that he helped design with Zildjian). Then as I started to walk away with my wife, Steve motioned for her to come back so he could meet and speak with her as well. He expressed this genuine interest in everyone he met at the event. He is truly a wonderful person. Steve employed a warm, conversational tone throughout the clinic that followed. He communicated his ideas and techniques in understandable ways, and he demonstrated them on the drumset. While watching him break down some of his grooves, a sense of awe engulfed me; yet at the same time I felt inspired and empowered to become an innovative drummer in my own right. GET THIS DVD!",1207008000,22,983,4.377049180327869

for years.",1388188800,,114,4.2272727272727275
3121761,3,B00141BEA4,"This DVD is not what I expected, although there are some great moments with Steve playing some great grooves and breaking the beats and rudiments down.  I was expecting more of an instructional ""one on one"" type of format. This is a video with various out takes from a large venue clinic.  Audience members would line up at the mic and ask Steve various questions.
  No doubt, Steve Gadd is the master. For $9.99 and free shipping, it's a good addition to the drumming library.",1383782400,,477,4.576470588235294
3121762,5,B00141BEA4,I found that I learned more about drumming simplicity viewing Steve's DVD than I did from any other resource that I tried. I'd recommend this to everyone.,1359936000,,154,4.7407407407407405
3121763,5,B00141BEA4,One of the best instructional videos out today.  Steve Gadd is one if not the most influential drummers in modern drum set technique today.  This video has several great grooves with excellent explanations.  It has been a real pleasure to watch this over and over.,1354320000,,264,4.822222222222222
3121764,3,B00141BEA4,"Not having any prior knowlege of steve gadd, i thought i would check out this video.  im more of a lars ulrich, neil peart type drummer. everything i know i learned from them. my opinion means little, any drum instruction video has its learning potential, and this on has some.  I think its a fundamental mistake to hold someone else in high regard. Steve Gadd seems to be a technical drummer as far as rudiments are concerned, he has a lifetime of experience wich you can draw from.  try to learn from his mistakes and this video will serve you well. buy it if you collect drum videos its a good price.",1344643200,3,603,4.366071428571429
3121765,5,B00141BEA4,"If you're a drummer serious about your instrument and craft, this video should live in your media library and you should break it out now and again. There's a lot of great dialog, several tributes to Mr. Gadd, and of course, there's a wealth of performance footage. Be sure to check out Vinnie Colaiuta's tribute, in particular.

If you saw Steve on his ""Mission From Gadd"" clinic tour, much of the content will look familiar. Still, this video is entertaining, produced well, and entirely worth owning. There are many learning opportunities contained herein.",1337990400,,559,5.010752688172043
3121766,5,B00141BEA4,My husband is a drummer and this guy is his favourite drummer.  He is learning so much from this DVD and gets pretty excited about it all.  Recommend big time.,1297728000,5,159,4.266666666666667

His dialogue, explanation, and sample drum parts are excellent, and put forth in an easy to understand way. He plays all different styles and explains and plays them all.  He has years of experience, and well know drum parts to work with. Most folks know of the drum part in ""50 Ways To Leave Your Lover"". He explains how he came up with that, for example. He is like a wise professor, giving us great information in a comfortable, easy manner. I don't think it matters what level you are at, or what style of music you play - you'll get useful information from Mr. Gadd and this DVD package.",1279238400,3,769,4.408450704225352
3121768,5,B00141BEA4,"Steve Gadd is one of the few true masters of the drum kit. With a bangin' opening introduction, Steve Gadd interacts with his audience in a ask-respond type of manner. 3 hours of really good information, Steve Gadd demonstrates some of his grooves/licks/etc. and overall musicianship. If you're a drummer, then get this at all cost. This is a drummer every drummer should study. He's excellent when it comes to explainations. However, don't believe you're going to get detailed technique patterns like the Moeller technique. This is to demonstrate what it means to be a real musician, by the legend himself. EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT A DRUMMER, this is essential. This is a video and musician can watch and learn how to be a better musician. Even Steve Smith, a legend, came to this event at Manhattan School of Music to learn from him. You can't get any better than that. GET THIS!!",1278547200,3,876,4.73202614379085
