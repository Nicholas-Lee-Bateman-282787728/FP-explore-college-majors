But if you wanna see Angela Mao whip some butt check ot the ""sting of the dragon fist"" or ""lady kung fu"" and of course she the one who played bruce lee's sister in ""Enter the dragon""  ""Lengedary Strikes...Excellent.""",1128902400,3,295,4.25
7891641,3,6305582904,"THE LEGENDARY STRIKE (1978) is no kung fu classic, but it does offer a good cast, a fast pace and a series of picturesque Taiwan locations that recall American westerns in their rugged beauty. The plot is rather convoluted and involves the battle over a sacred pearl called the Buddha's Relic between several different parties, including corrupt Ching Dynasty officials, Ming rebels, Korean agents, Shaolin monks and Japanese emissaries.
Sporting a dramatic red costume, Angela Mao appears as a fighter for the Koreans who allies with the Ming rebels, led by Chu Kong (THE BIG HEAT, THE KILLER). Their enemies include corrupt Ching nobles played by two worthy kung fu performers, Carter Wong (THE 18 BRONZEMEN) and Chen Sing (THE MAGNIFICENT), and a Shaolin monk played by Kam Kong (MASTER OF THE FLYING GUILLOTINE).
Angela has a few good fights, although the film could have made better use of her (and the other performers as well). Still, it's a good-looking film with an acceptable level of action and ranks as a slightly better-than-average title in Tai Seng's Martial Arts Theater line-up of old school kung fu releases.",1041292800,2,1126,5.026737967914438
7891642,3,6305582904,"A fair movie with good stars,but it is lacking in something. The movie stars Angela Mao,Carter Wong,Cassanova Wong and Chen Sing.
The plot revolves around finding a missing Japanese Shoguns pearl. Summary of this movie - Great Stars but only Fair Movie.",973900800,,253,5.0476190476190474
7891643,3,6305582904,"Carter Wong, Cassanova Wong, angela mao, to name a few star in this film that never really seems to pick up.  It's filled with a lot of talking, and  a lot of walking around, and only a little of fighting.  Although the fight  scenes come every long while, they are entertaining.  Cassanova get's a  chance to show of why he is one of the greatest kickers in martial arts  history, also Carter Wong shows off what we all know he can do.  Angela Mao  plays the hero, along with a partner they try and take on the many villians  that are thrown at them.  A great final fight, which ends though before you  actually realize it's over.  Ok movie",967334400,2,641,4.285714285714286
