8184099,5,B000O9GRKE,"The one line in the movie about the USA being only 6% of the world population but wanting 50-60% of its resources, says it all about the why, we are involved with dictators, and death squard thru our CIA around the world.
The movie does an excellent job explaing thru words and image, the devestation that has been wrought in Central and South America in our name.
In the movie there was the one small victory of the closing of the school of the americas, only to be reopened under a different name. Also, we are informed that there are many similar schools across Central and South America that are performing the same functions.
I can't help but feel that many Americans are aware of what is going on but want to remain ignorant, so they can enjoy their Starbucks, Coca Cola, SUV, and cheep labor to take care of their homes, children and gardens.

Thanks
