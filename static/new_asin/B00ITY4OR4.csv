8645460,5,B00ITY4OR4,"Just Planes videos has for some years produced high quality ""Airport"" and ""Flight In The Cockpit"" videos. Many of the newer videos are available in Blu-ray format. These videos were sold on the Just Planes website and were listed and available through some of the commercial airliner enthusiast magazines. Approximately one year ago Just Planes ceased offering video discs for sale and now offers these videos only for computer download; most of the originals in regular format and the newer ones in HD format. All of the videos that were originally available as DVDs are now just available on the secondary market. Just Planes appears to be expanding it's catalogue and producing new offerings, but, again these are offered only as computer downloads. This particular Blu-ray video from 2014 details operations of the Mexican airline ""vivaaerobus"" based in Monterrey, Mexico and described as the only airline in Mexico with a real low-cost model.  This ""flight in the cockpit"" video details flights from Monterrey to Acapulco, Cancun, Houston, Mexico City, Monterrey, Mazatln, Puerto Vallarta and Veracruz. As usual with these videos the quality is fine, the in air scenery is enjoyable and the cockpit presentations are very interesting.",1491782400,,1239,5.289340101522843
