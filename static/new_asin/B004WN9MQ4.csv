To my surprise it was delivered to him (I had them send it to his house) on Christmas eve 2 weeks before the estimated delivery time. The DVD was everything I thought it would be, it was in great condition and my brother now can have his wolves fix whenever he wants!!",1357948800,,648,4.0310077519379846
