6675092,5,B00NP06E7U,I love One Piece! It's so great that they actually try. The English voices are great and the transition from japanese to dub is pretty good. Funimation nailed it in my opinion and they are going at a pretty good pace. Keep up the great work. I'm an avid supporter and I own all the voyages. I don't wait for the season collections.,1425859200,,331,4.26984126984127
