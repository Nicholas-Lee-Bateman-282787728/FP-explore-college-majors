8585040,5,B00CQMEQI2,"Bill Spicer did a beautiful job explaining how wonderful a relationship can be between a human and a squirrel.  Squirrels are clever and loving... and make wonderful friends.  Bill's movie brought back many memories of my squirrel Perry, and her offspring that lived on our property in the 1960s & 1970s.  She lived in a Oak tree at the top of our property in our woods.  The memories endure until this day.  I still remember the way her soft tummy felt.  One day as my mother unloaded groceries she left a newly purchased mop outside the back door.  That evening when she went to bring it inside she found it had been gnawed to a nub ... all the mop strings were gone!  We walked into the woods and looked up at the tree Perry lived in and saw the mop strings hanging outside of the entrance.  Having a relationship with these squirrels ... and yes, chipmunks too, made for a very enjoyable time in my life.  Perry however, was the only one we allowed to come inside the house.  She quickly found the bowl of peanuts we kept for her and would frequently help herself when we were busy with yard work.  Recently, that old Oak tree had to come down.  I waited until the very last minute because I wanted to be sure squirrels were no longer living in the tree.  When it was determined the free was free of wildlife I finally allowed it to be cut down.  It was a sad occasion because it was the only physical remembrance I had left of that sweet little squirrel.  I do still feed the squirrels, but since my return to this house I have not had the time to train any of them since I am the sole care giver to my mother.

Needless to say I very much enjoyed the 'Squirrel Whisperer'.  People do not know what they are missing when they don't allow animals such as these to bless their life.  I enjoy the friendship and love with many animals.  They are truly a blessing from God.

If you've every wondered about branching out from the typical cat and/or dog relationship I would highly recommend Bill Spicer's film.  It is not only enjoyable, but educational as well.  Beware ... these little animals become part of your heart.  Always there, never to be forgotten, and leaving you looking forward to seeing them again some day.  Because I am among those who can't imagine Heaven without animals.  Lots of them!",1517875200,,2306,4.4052132701421804

8585042,5,B00CQMEQI2,Wow!  Watching this will have you bright eyed and bushy tailed! (or taled).  I love feeding squirrels and like Bill I do feed them from my hand.  I don't try to name each one as squirrels don't have long lives and I want to enjoy all of them.  Bill's Blu-ray is the best and I watched it twice the first week.  Everyone on YouTube will notice that all over the world (except Australia where none live) have fun interacting with squirrels.  This is one of the best and Bill is truly the Squirrel Whisperer.  I will be the Squirrel Nut --but many people also probably claim this nickname.,1476748800,,586,4.37037037037037

8585044,5,B00CQMEQI2,"If you are an animal lover and especially if you have a passion for these little creatures, you'll love this film.  it is well filmed with and edited, including lots of action shots, to create a story of how Mr Spicer patiently enticed a whole community of squirrels to trust him and bond with him.  His peanut bill must be high, though.",1383696000,,337,4.419354838709677
