5777701,5,B00D90UW42,The fact that it is in French subtitle makes it more engaging than other suspenseful thrillers on American Television. You cannot take your eyes away for fear of missing any dialogue. But that's the easy part. The subject content is intense. You are visually glued to the images on screen. Tearing yourself away is nearly impossible. Beautiful audio with a hovering gloom frame to frame. Conflicting and subtle. Edge of your seat the entire time. I love it.,1384732800,2,457,4.871794871794871

5777705,5,B00D90UW42,"I just finished the first season and all I can say is wow. You will be hooked within the first ten minutes, and unlike many other shows, this one maintains the same level of excellence throughout with a great ending to boot. I also enjoy The Walking Dead alot but at the end of the day even that can't hold a candle to this incredible, eerie, and tense show. There is a pervasive sense of unease and ominous tension, coupled with a masterful score that fits the theme so well, that this show will undoubtedly leave a mark on you. So please, don't let the subtitles deter you. You'll be so hooked you won't even notice!",1384387200,2,618,4.336206896551724

The Returned (French: Les Revenants) is a television drama series created by Fabrice Gobert and shown on Canal+ in France, BeTV in Belgium and SVT in Sweden. Eight episodes were shown from 26 November to 17 December 2012. It is an adaptation of the 2004 film They Came Back (in French titled Les Revenants). Season 2 is to air in 2014.

Credit to Wiki for the synopsis:

""In a small mountain town, many dead people reappear, apparently alive and normal: road accident victim teenager Camille; suicidal bridegroom Simon; ""Victor"", a small boy who was murdered by burglars; and Serge, a serial killer. They try to resume their lives as strange phenomena occur: amongst recurring power outages, the water level of the reservoir mysteriously lowers, revealing the presence of dead animals and a church steeple, and strange marks appear on the bodies of the living and the dead.""

Let's get the obvious out of the way. Yes, the audio is in French and there are subtitles. Yes, the French are generally not known for producing TV with international appeal (the excellent series ""Spiral"" being the exception). First point: As an evolving connoisseur (like my use of French here) of international TV, I have come to actually appreciate subtitles. Why, you ask? I have found that watching a program (TV or movie) with subtitles requires a greater level of concentration (hence commitment). I can't be checking my email or playing marbles on my laptop when I have to read the subtitles. As an added benefit, I found my long forgotten high school French coming back to me, as I began to understand more of the spoken words and even some of the inflection. Second Point: It would be a huge mistake to discount Les Revenants due to the so-so reputation of French TV in general.

I was hooked after the first episode by virtue of a plot twist that I didn't see coming. I am also interested in how people live and the imagery and bleakness of the French alpine town provides the perfect backdrop to the plot. While it is not a perfect analogy and I am not even certain that it is a proper catch phrase, Les Revenants has a ""Twin-Peakish"" feel to it.

Give Les Revenants a chance and don't be scared off by the subtitles. Kudos again to Sundance for taking the chance. With ""Top of the Lake"" and Les Revenants, I can only hope that Sundance continues to introduce the USA to interesting international programming.",1384300800,97,2411,4.728571428571429
5777707,5,B00D90UW42,"This is a fantastic show.  There aren't many ways to watch it stateside unless you happen to have the Sundance Channel so take advantage of watching it here!  Looking for something to fill the hole shows like Twin Peaks, Lost, or the X-Files left behind?  Right here.  Shot beautifully with music from the excellent Mogwai, you'll get hooked. I really dig this show and wish all 8 episodes were available!  Guess I'll have to wait.",1384214400,10,431,4.693333333333333
5777708,5,B00D90UW42,"I was absolutely chilled by the first episode. Its matter of fact tone while dealing with the shocking reality of long dead family members returning as they were to a future they cannot comprehend is a fascinating concept. This is a brave and intelligent take on the 'undead' without the usual clichs. I was mesmerized. There are many little twists and turns and unexpected little surprises throughout.

I have seen the first two episodes, and it is my new favorite series. It's too bad American TV always has to go for the flash and over-the-top horror movie tropes in their tired attempts at gothic chills (Fox's Sleepy Hollow, NBC's awful Dracula). This quieter but much scarier French show delivers genuine shock and will haunt you days afterwards.",1384041600,60,752,4.921259842519685

5777710,5,B00D90UW42,Loved it. Things tie together slowly but surely.,1461715200,,48,5.125
5777711,5,B00D90UW42,"Both seasons are extremely good. French cinema is usually very unwatchable for a lot of American viewers because they sort of hate endings. They don't like their movies to come to any kind of resolution, somehow that's not French enough. I lived in France for quite a few years and I can tell you they actually chop the last 5 minutes off of most American movies because they hate the end. So, that being said, there is WAY more resolution here than I was expecting. At the end of season two you get a sketchy explanation as to what started the whole thing. Not all questions are answered- like, what the heck happened to Adele? I watched that scene like three times and I still have no clue. Also, I am almost positive that Lucy is a succubus, and not at all like the rest of the undead. And what was with the dead animals in the water? Basically, you never find out. But the overall storyline has a lot more explanation than I was expecting. This is bordering on horror, but it's not at all, it's just a crazy, dark, creepy thriller. Really, really good",1461369600,,1055,4.387755102040816

5777713,5,B00D90UW42,"This show is a haunting in the best way possible. From the acting, to the cinematography, to the music, everything has just the right amount of eerie beauty. Yes, there are subtitles, but it only made me pay more attention and I wanted to anyway. I was totally engrossed in this story. This show is constantly making you think and I really enjoy that. This show goes down in history as one of my favorites. If you're looking for something beautiful, creepy, and thought-provoking, I would recommend this series. The American one is crap compared to this. It lacks the same creepiness, and since it was cancelled you only get one (unfinished) season. This one answers most of viewer's questions with the end of Season 2.",1459123200,,719,4.714285714285714

5777725,5,B00D90UW42,"This series is amazing. The acting and story are so good that I am as committed as a family member to the characters, and forget they aren't really related to each other (meaning members of various families). That the story follows a popular subgenre but allows the characters to retain their original appearance was a welcome twist, which in the end deepens the plot and the viewers' commitment to the characters. The series overall is quality stuff.",1450915200,,451,4.87012987012987
5777726,5,B00D90UW42,I have watched the series numerous times and I can say everytime I have noticed something new and I solve some puzzles but new ones are revealed.  The cinematography must be seen to be believed.  The atmosphere and layers to the plot are amazing.  Nothing else like this has been on american TV.,1450656000,,295,4.528301886792453
5777727,5,B00D90UW42,"Well,I've now seen season two ,which is the conclusion of this story line. This is easily the best show ,shown during the 2015 TV season. There isn't anything anywhere to touch it.  It is an incredibly well done and well written show. Unique and different and filled with superb performances.
I really don't want to say much about the actual story besides you can read a brief synopsis right here on this site. Suffice to say,if the story sounds interesting to you and your brain hasn't been destroyed by staring at your phone for ten hours a day,by all means buy or rent this and prepare for a very special treat.
I have seen some complaints here about the fact it has subtitles,as it was made for French TV,I thought the language made it all the more perfect. I love the fact that the French haven't caved in to our flash cut style of film making and the film is slow and deliberate and it is all the more rewarding for it. It does contain some violence and nudity,which of course,on US TV means they left all the violence  in the Sundance TV showing but still felt the need to blur some breasts. That speaks volumes to why Americans are the way they are,don't you think? However,when the Blu ray is released,hopefully next year. I will dive on it and see it the way it was shot and I can't wait to watch it again.
In the meantime,Please check this show out,it's a once in a decade series,that will actually turn your brain on,I can't stop turning it over in my head and I'm grateful for that pleasure.",1450569600,,1504,4.406474820143885
5777728,4,B00D90UW42,This unique story line was enjoyable.  Disappointed season 2 was cancelled but season 1 is still worth watching.,1449273600,,112,5.222222222222222
5777729,5,B00D90UW42,"I can't recommend this show enough. The music, cinematography, the location, great acting, and really compelling story telling made me want to watch it over and over. It's a little off center so it's creepy and provoking but not scary, it's not a typical horror/zombie/back from the dead type of show.  There is an air of forboding and danger and not fully knowing what is going to happen next but as you see the season unfurl and things come more and more together all the plots and stories come together so amazingly.  It sexy and a little dark but not depressing in anyway for me. So many interesting and new storylines woven together at a compelling pace, not rushed, yet spellbinding.  It's not an action thriller but go along for the ride and I know you will find it rewarding and well worth the watch. It's one of my favorite shows of all time!",1448841600,,851,4.512987012987013
5777730,5,B00D90UW42,"Great eerie (yet sexy?) story with music to match. The subtitles force you to really pay attention to what is going on, well worth the effort!",1448409600,,142,4.5
5777731,5,B00D90UW42,after re-watching the 1st US episode (started with the subtitled French) it sucked me in and had me hooked. Lots of twists and turns that keep you guessing. You don't know what you think you know!  Enjoy!,1447891200,,204,4.513513513513513
5777732,5,B00D90UW42,"I was totally sucked in by the pilot.  So many fascinating characters and unanswered questions, just had to continue with rest of Season 1.  Finished it off still trying to figure out some of them, which is part of the show's brilliance.  Makes you think.

Of course you need to be able to handle subtitles, this is the original French series.  And accept you won't be spoon-fed explanations for everything that's going on.  I can't wait for Season 2 to go to DVD, admit a little hope it might clear up a few things that still baffle me.",1447891200,,537,4.428571428571429

5777751,3,B00D90UW42,"This series started out strong. The casting, acting, & writing were very good. The series poses the question of how we would react if our deceased loved ones returned. We think that we would embrace them with open arms. But would we? Our lives have moved on. They would not fit into our lives in the same capacity as before. Also, the return is unprecedented; so there would be all sorts of implications: why this person and not that? Are we to treat these people as some sort of religious personage from history? Is this return some sort of a message? All these issues are confronted with startling verisimilitude.

Then there is the adjustment issues faced by the returned themselves. In this story line, they have no memory of how they died or that they were dead; no memory of an afterlife prior to their return. In this series the returned we meet have been gone anywhere from 4 to 30 years. The world has moved on. They have to find a new place for themselves in it. These issues are also examined in realistically human ways.

But the last 2 of the 8 episodes did not ring true. Some of the characters started reacting in ways that just felt off. Also, a new plot element  was added that detracted from the beautiful story arc already in motion.

Some of the performances are noteworthy. The actresses playing the 2 daughters are world class despite their youthful years. The troubled nurse is also deeply moving.

Also, be forewarned that these episodes were intended to be a part of a larger story arc that is not completed. We are left hanging with some of the mysteries unresolved and unexplained.

One more element to mention. This is not a Hollywood slam bang production with cheap scares. It is slow moving. It allows time for deep character development. Most viewers will demand faster pacing. If you have the patience to allow the plot to unfold at its own pace, this show is very rewarding.",1431648000,2,1907,4.594117647058823

The emotions are more raw and spontaneous and easier to relate to.  As you watch, you can imagine yourself reacting in much the same way...reacting to a situation (in wonderment and disbelief) that is surreal and very real at the same time.  Although I was a bit surprised at the turn of the plot...towards something that is mundane and all over screen these days (""living dead"")... I'm hoping the second series adds a bit more.

Now years later the lake that the old town hides beneath is drying up for unknown reasons and people who died in different violent ways are returning. This is not a zombie show. They don't know why they've come back anymore than anyone else does. But it is odd that no one in the town leaves or calls for help. It is definitely a show with secrets. Excellent acting and writing. Very happy to read that there will be a season two of the French version. I have read that the U.S. version misses all the subtlety of the original.

5777770,5,B00D90UW42,"Visually stunning, enjoyably creepy, and full of psychological nuance, this series (the second season of which is in production as of 2015) takes place in a village in the French Alps. It centers on the inexplicable resurrection (fully fleshed and functioning) of a number of people who had died in recent years, and it features an arresting (and often beautiful) cast of characters. Each episode focuses on a particular returnee and those who are closely involved. As both the ""returned"" and the townspeople try to accept and understand what's going on, there are simultaneous hints of an unnamed past disaster involving the reservoir that forms a huge part of the immediate landscape.

So that is the real origin of both series. and of course we are going to get  a 'returned' show in America as well. So that's 3 shows in all based on people returning from the dead.  I missed the sundance showings of this so I had to buy this. And it's very good.  It's atmospheric and darker than resurrection' in some ways. And I like it.  What do the returned want.  We had two seasons of 'resurrection' so far and this one has a second season coming out on sundance.  This is well worth checking out too.  They say the u.s version will be somewhat different.

The fact that it is English sub-titled just requires you to totally commit to it......it's not a time to multi-task, I can tell you that!  What you don't see or what you can imagine is happening or about to happen perhaps is much creepier than a predictable zombie movie with a body count. A suicidal bride-groom, a teenage girl, a little boy, and a serial killer are among those who are for some reason resurrected several years after their prospective deaths.  All of this takes place in a small, beautiful French town in the mountains near a dam (and there's a back story to the dam, as well.) The former dead return to this small town, some to their families, former acquaintances, or in once case in particular, strangers.  Some of the dead are welcomed back, some are not.

The first episode is the one that caught my interest and after that the story line becomes becomes almost like a soap opera. Jumping back and forth, in and out of the lives of different people loosely connected.

5777810,4,B00D90UW42,"I heard about The Returned from Stephen King on Twitter. It is amazing how social media changes the way we watch TV and movies. Overall, I was a fan of this show. The only concern was the fact that it had subtitles. Even so, I still thought the plot was very well thought out and it offered a unique story line. I am a huge fan of anything that is time travel based. I will not spoil the show for you but there is a lot of time travel and it makes you think outside the box.

Interestingly, there are a few other connections to this show. There is a book written which is titled The Returned by Jason Mott. This show is not based on that book. In fact, that book came out after this show had been produced. The story lines are similar but there are some differences. The American TV Show Resurrection is the adaptation for the book The Returned by Jason Mott. I know this can be confusing but just note that The Returned TV show I am reviewing is not based on the book The Returned.

Social media plays a very large roll in my life. Heck, I created Wojdylo Social Media because of the strong influence. If you are looking to find more scary shows that make you think I would strongly suggest following Stephen King and some other horror fiction writers that are active on Twitter. You will find that they tweet out some of the shows they watch but these shows tend to not be the most popular shows in the United States. Check out some authors, actors and screen writers on Twitter and you will likely find some great shows such as The Returned.",1406937600,,1544,4.266211604095563

5777814,4,B00D90UW42,"I love this show - it helps that I'm a bit of a Francophile but this series, especially the earlier episodes, do a wonderful job of evoking the mysterious and supernatural in a suggestive and subtle, yet menacing, way.  The soundtrack by Mogwai (one of my favorite bands, and the way in which I first discovered this show to begin with) is also very good.  Would recommend picking up their soundtrack (which goes by the French name for the series, Les Revenants).  My only quibble with the show is that, as the mystery becomes less pronounced and the recently-returned become more recognized by the everyday inhabitants of this sleepy, French, mountain community, some of the charm wears off, but hopefully Series 2 will restore the impact by having some excellent stories and good explanations for what has been transpiring.  My only other complaint is that some of the sexual content seems very forced and unnatural, and thrown in for no reason other than to provide some gratuitous nudity.  I feel that all aspects of a work, whether a novel, movie or tv show, should feel organic and natural within the framework of the story rather than tacked-on for some other purpose.

That quibble aside, though, this is really good, and I enjoy it much more than the U.S. interpretation that aired last season.  The only barrier is the language, but if you don't mind subtitles, give this a spin - you'll probably love it.",1404950400,,1415,4.774590163934426

Much more interesting characters, each with their own complex storyline.  Have not been bored for one second.  Can't wait for Season Two.",1402876800,,381,5.064516129032258
5777820,5,B00D90UW42,"I almost gave up after the first episode.  It was interesting, but slow.  But the pace and intrigue built over time.  It's not going to be a fast-paced show, like True Blood.  There's no humor.  But as time goes on, you're like ""hey! That chick was so-and-so, in the coffee shop, two episdoes back, remember?""  Everything is tied together, and it's the kind of show you'll enjoy watching more than once, because you'll pick up stuff you missed.

It's frustrating that the series was so short--it was just getting going when the season ended.  But worth it.  If I hadn't bought the whole season (and do that...so much cheaper) I would have given up after episode 1.  Glad I didn't.

The little kid is super creepy--great acting.  Simon looks like Peter Brady.  LOL...then he has nude scenes, and it's like watching Peter Brady have sex.  Weird!  There are a lot of sex scenes (some, like the ""psychic"" sex scenes, were just...weird, awkward, and fake).  I won't give anything away, but I was thinking...in this situation because of what's going on around them...how are these men ""keeping it up"" while they have sex with her???  So yeah, if you don't like nude scenes, skip it, or look away, because there's one or more with each episode.  But they're brief...they're not going for shock value, like with True Blood.

Oh, and it's France, so there are a lot of minors smoking and drinking in bars.  As an American, it's really confusing trying to figure out how old the younger characters are, until you remember how young kids can drink there.  So I think Camille is around 14 or 15, and her sister Lena is 18 or 19.  But she seems to be in high school.

All in all, it's good tv.  Not light entertainment, but interesting intriguing, and you something to be watched when you're not totally brain dead.  It's not scary, or nightmare-giving (to me), like Walking Dead can be, and it's not action-packed, or fast-paced.  The overall vibe is basically ""creepy.""",1402617600,,1958,4.668621700879766

5777832,4,B00D90UW42,"another take on the genre, arguably one of the most optimistic and imaginative yet.

there is probably no easy translation for the term zombie.  it may have resulted from an american corruption of the intial haitian/creole, but apparently a typical french translation is le revenant, one who returns.

so what if they did return, but weren't decayed, stunted, or made less than human by the experience of their death?

what if they were just simply who they had been, now only trying to find their way back home, and how best to fit into their former lives?

The emotional reactions of the returnees and their families and friends are entirely believable. A fifteen year old returnee  girl asks her sister if she was afraid of her, and then admitted that she scared herself.

Slow moving, with a stunning mountain locale, the creepiness just keeps growing, ably assisted by the atmospheric soundtrack from Mogwai - the English sub-titles do not detract whatsoever, and for me, just added to the  'otherness' of the whole show.
Hate to think how the Americans will ruin this show in their forthcoming version [ I can hear the studio suits now - ""hey, this is too slow-moving.... we need to speed things up a bit! It needs some explosions, car chases, lotsa sex and more blood and guts... etc etc"" ] like they did with ""Being Human"" and numerous others.

The music, scenery, dialogue, directing, casting, everything so far superior to any ""made in America"" programming.  I've long been a fan of foreign film, they leave out all the ""ridiculousness"" silly dialogue, forced acting, and get to the heart of the story and have a way of speaking to each individual viewing the unfolding tale.  Anxiously awaiting the new season.  Sadly, the American version was soppy and had little substance.  Like watching bread soaking in water , no flavor, no substance, unappetizing.  America - learn something from foreign film and stop all the silliness and unrealistic dialogue.",1395964800,,933,5.052287581699346
5777848,5,B00D90UW42,"Okay, I don't usually get sucked into a program and sit for hours clicking from one episode to another, let alone get the chills from the creepy soundtrack that resounds in your brain. But when I watched The Returned, or as the French say it, Les Revenants, that's exactly what happened.

Yes, you have to read subtitles, unless you got an A in high school French, you won't understand a word. Nevertheless, that didn't bother me, because boy this series is nifty.

You know me.  Usually I like British TV, but I must say this story is great.  Since Resurrection started on ABC this season with people coming back from the dead, I had read that some wondered if it was a spinoff from this series.  However, I think it's similar, but not based on the same underlying premise.

Let me further state that I am NOT a fan of zombies.  In fact, I have never read a zombie book or seen a zombie movie or watched The Walking Dead. Shocking, I know.  So I am definitely not zombie influenced. (It makes you wonder what the fascination is with all these shows about dead people. No more friendly ghosts. They've returned in the flesh.)

I think what drew me into the story, is how it plays out bit by bit like a puzzle of people.  Those who have returned, of course, certainly have a past.  Some don't know why - others do.  Somehow in this small mountainous town in France, they are all connected.  The location has a tragic history, too, but if I told you the tragedy it would be a spoiler, so I'm not going to do that.

Needless to say it's worth tuning in.  The end of the first season of eight episodes has left me hanging by a thread.  What's going to happen next?  Do I have to wait until Season 2?  Will the humans live?  Will the dead people reign?  You left me hanging at the last episode!!  The show sort of reminds me of Lost.  You really do get lost in it, because you're trying to understand what the hell is going on. So you keep tuning in hoping to find the answer.

Looking for a good creepy show?  Tune in to The Returned and sharpen your French.

Oui trs bon!

There is some violence (serial killer).  Oh, and it is sexually graphic by the way - lovemaking, breasts, and frontal shots of men well endowed to make you blush. Well, what do you expect? It's French, and they are open about their sexuality.",1395705600,4,2312,4.316279069767442

Unlike fast-paced American TV series, this one takes its time, revealing bits of the puzzle here and there.  The atmosphere is often creepy and mysterious.

I was blown away by the originality of it and by the superbly tight performances that give as much away with an eyebrow, a brush of a finger, a hunch of a shoulder or a smile than pages and pages of dialogue.  I don't want to spoil a moment of it for you.  Let's just send Robert Redford (he went to France and found this and brought it back to us) a really really big thank you card!!  Even if they rip it off over here and they will if they haven't already it will not be done nearly this well, nor will they ever find as haunting a cast to play it out.  This little village in the French Alps now seems like the neighborhood next door and I can't wait to find out what happens next!!  I unreservedly recommend this for entertainment of the highest order.  Trust me.

I would caution American audiences that French audiences do not disdain violence when it's due (nor do they overdo it) and when nudity is called for it is naturally occurring and not luridly displayed as is sexuality dealt with naturally in the course of things.  Neither they nor you will feel self conscience about it.",1395446400,3,1248,4.363636363636363

5777854,4,B00D90UW42,"His might change to a 5 star review when I finish but I just couldn't wait to write a review of this astounding effort.

Here's the scoop. Set in a quiet, northern France town, various people who have died over the years begin to come back to life and head back to the town. This wrecks all sorts of havoc on those those their family and friends.

To begin with, this is a great idea, and I like the way they play it. They don't go, openly, for the spook factor. They don't need to. The idea is creepy all by itself. Here they play it for the strong human element surrounding the reappearance of these people. Face it. What would you do if someone you knew who died, suddenly walked back into your life? There is nothing in our makeup that prepares us for such a thing. But this is just part of it. All these returnees are part of other stories. Each has their own story on their death, and other weird stuff is happening. Why does the town's power randomly go out. Why is water in the lake by the dam receding? The writer/producer doles out little tidbits here and there as the story begins to come together.

All the writing, directing and acting are at a professional level. The music, by Mogwai, also helps dial up the creep factor. I also get the feeling this won't be a slap-dash ending. I'm thinking all this will come to a satisfying conclusion.

And I mean GRUESOME! like a serial killer eating the liver of his still living, cut-up young female victims, and other creepy bloody scenes.

On the plus side; it's filmed in a beautiful little mountain town with spectacular views and there is an appealing atmosphere to the show. Again, it could have been good, with less gruesome scenes and more solutions to the mysteries.

There is no rhyme or reason to who comes back and who doesn't, and the show isn't particularly interested in explanations, which is a good thing. It happens, and people need to deal with it.

I've read descriptions calling The Returned ""a French take on zombies"", but I never thought of ""the returned"" as zombies. They are normal people who come back and have to deal with the challenges of their unique situation. There is definitely a feeling of dread surrounding those who come back, but it's not the dread of mindless zombies or an overbearing evil.

The series is much edgier and keeps you waiting to see what happens next. I also saw the BBc series In the Flesh which as far as plots go is ok but the simply crazy weird look to the zombies with make up on made it hard to watch.

None of the characters in this show are perfect - all of them are flawed in some way & all of them are interesting in every way.  Usually I am spot on when it comes to figuring out the plot lines of movies/shows but this one has me stumped.  There's no pattern for the dead coming back.  Some were dead for decades, others only a few years.  None of them are related.  A few of them know they're dead while others do not.

Every scene not only informs the next but all that have come before it too.  This is a many layered onion and it's peeling itself slowly and deliciously for a global audience who has correctly made this the most exciting new series on the planet.

Which is extraordinary enough that something can no longer be said to just appeal to all of America, or Peru, but an entire planet.  Enter the age of the global audience.  But the fact that the premise, the characters and the setting is so engaging and well crafted that we know now is truly the Golden Age of television.  And yes you can call a show that teleports its images to phone, tablet, amazon or TV television.  No new word need be created.

Again, this demonstrates what good story telling is.  Having just enjoyed a week or so making a mediocre filmmaker with a really bad short film defend his cinematic excrement, he still just refused to get what audiences want.  The Returned shows us how an audience can be engaged by superb concise writing and well written characters without the need for special effects so many today need to use in order to hide the absence of substance in their story telling.

But the Returned is a tale of the undead that has a story arc as mysterious and multi-layered as Fringe and character development on par with Battlestar Galactica, although the scope of the story is smaller.

The returnees function as visitations of unresolved karma. So the most interesting questions are raised by the actions and reactions of those who have remained alive and now must deal with whatever they weren't dealing with.

The Returned is a fusion of sf, horror, mystery and detective genres. It is slow and creepy, but also intense and poignant. The acting is  good, but not riveting. The fine script and surprising plot twists make up for that. One of the better shows out there.",1390262400,2,768,4.803030303030303

This is one masterful attempt at a trendy subject matter that subtly proves that thrillers or mysteries or zombie movies don't need to be packed with in your face, over-the- top action all the time to be successful. Actually, I find it way too stereotypical and pitifully desperate when all hopes are hitched on the run of the mill action scenes that you don't even need to watch to know what happens.
What is done in this series is something much more difficult and you need to have refined eye, not be afraid of falling off the mainstream wagon to produce something this captivating.
Having said that, I trust European and world film makers much more than I would trust a Hollywood exec to come up with something that makes me go wow.
Still, if you have a repulsion to subtitles and do not speak French or find anything cerebral to be a strain on your brain cells, or will be devastated to learn that there is not a car chase, a shoot out with automatic rifles every 15 min, stereotypical meaningless chit chat in this series, then avoid this one :) because it requires you to engage both with your soul and mind in order to carry you to a magical place.",1390176000,2,1306,4.400826446280992

Their deaths have taken place at different times and for different reasons.  Their families and friends react in different ways to their return - obviously.  One of them is a serial killer.

I lost a loved one a few weeks  before watching it and the first few episodes, while somewhat creepy, were strangely comforting to me. I'm sorry to say however, that the last episode is dreadfully disappointing. The series takes off in such a wonderful, wondrous direction only to arrive in a very hackneyed placed. Such a pity.

5777918,5,B00D90UW42,"One of my favorite lines from the TV show ""Pushing Daisies"" is when Ned the Pie-Maker criticizes the term ""living dead"": ""When you're dead, that's what you are. But when you're dead and then you're not, you're alive again. Can't we say 'alive again'?""

He might as well have been talking about ""The Returned"" (aka ""Les Revenants""), a French TV show that explores what happens when the dead return to life in a small French village -- and what it might lead to. Twilit, murky, gory and always filled with a sense of unease, this is an exquisitely haunting piece with plenty of twists and unanswered questions.

Five people mysteriously appear in a small mountain town in France, with no memory of their deaths or anything after that. Simon (Pierre Perrier) and fifteen-year-old Camille (Yara Pilartz) finds that in the years since their deaths, their families have moved on -- hers has fallen apart, including her troubled twin Lena (Jenna Thiam), and his fiancee Adele (Clotilde Hesme) is about to marry another man.

But family drama is not the biggest problem: one of the ""Returned"" is a serial killer with a penchant for repeatedly stabbing women to death, then eating their internal organs. And the killer's last victim, Julie (C&eacute;line Sallette) finds herself caring for a strange little boy with mysterious powers.

Power fluctuations and small floods begin to plague the town, as the ""Returned"" try to fit back into their old lives -- or in Camille's case, try to make a new one for herself. But more problems keep cropping up -- Lena suffers from a mysterious gangrenous gash on her back, and Adele's jealous fiance Thomas (Samir Guesmi) tries to frame Simon for the murders. But as the enigmatic Pierre (Jean-Franois Sivadier) gathers them together, it becomes clear that the dead are not returning by accident... and the five ""Returned"" are not alone.

""The Returned"" is not a show to watch casually -- it's a complicated tapestry of many plot threads, woven and twisted until you can barely see where they end. Seemingly ordinary stuff turns out to be incredibly weird and twisted, and seemingly cliched characters turn out to be... well, something very unexpected.

The story unfolds slowly, moodily building to its odd climax with every episode. The story is also pretty well-balanced between the screwed-up personal lives of the Returned, and the mysterious supernatural goings-on (mostly from Victor). The supernatural is kept pretty low-key most of the time, but it's clear that something bizarre and otherworldly is in town. And it's graced with some striking if disturbing imagery -- consider the drowned animals floating over a city submerged in a clear green-blue lake.

It's never made entirely clear if the Returned are undead or truly ""alive again."" But unlike your stereotypical zombies, they seem to be fully cognizant. The actors almost all do amazing jobs here, from the troubled teenagers to the psychic prostitute, the jealous cop to the serial killer -- and all of them are painted in shades of grey, each with their own motives and flaws. The only exception is Swann Nambotin, who is just kind of... blank.

Honestly, the biggest problem with this series is that it ends on the ultimate cliffhanger -- we have no answers about the Returned, what caused their reappearance and what happened. Season Two is a long, long way aways!

You would expect nothing but joy if the dead returned to life, but ""The Returned"" shows that sometimes that is only the start of the trouble. Almost perfect, except for all the unanswered questions.",1389571200,4,3564,4.956448911222781
5777919,5,B00D90UW42,"Almost. If and when they release it, dubbed into English, that's when I'll buy it. Or, since it WAS so good, I may wait for a US studio to buy the rights and reshoot it in English. (Since US studios have a history of doing exactly that.)

And less than a week after I first posted my review of The Returned, I discovered Resurrection. As of January, 2014, Resurrection is filming in the US, and is scheduled to run in spring of 2014. (Tentatively beginning in March, 2014.) I'll repeat myself, and go on the record: If and when they release The Returned dubbed into English, so I don't have to miss a significant chunk of time reading subtitles, I may still buy it. It really IS that good, but not good enough to tolerate subtitles.

(And seriously, it's not rocket science. A studio can release a film with any number of audio tracks to select from, if they're willing to invest the time and effort.)",1389484800,,901,4.421686746987952
5777920,5,B00D90UW42,"Since the first time I heard the story of Lazarus rising from the dead, I have been fascinated by the idea of, for want of a better phrase, the living dead. Did Lazarus' family treat him differently upon his return? Did he act differently than before he ""died""? Was he a social pariah? Did the children of his village fear him like the Bogey Man? Was there rejoicing at his return? I always thought one thing was certain: life after death could not have been as before. Could it? The Returned explores some of those questions.

The newly resurrected have been called the ""walking dead"", the living dead, zombies, walkers, biters, ghouls, or even Frankenstein's monster, but, for me, the bottom line is this: zombies are fascinating. I've seen old films from 30's, 40's, and 50's showing""zombies"" created from voodoo or magic spells. But George Romero's Night of the Living Dead marked the era of a new type of ""zombie"" - a creature risen from the dead, slow-moving, craving flesh of the living. They were used to be one of ""us"" and now they are ""other."" This film really brought home to me how the abyss really is scary place teeming with monsters, and sometimes the ""monsters"" are us. Of course, it's not a surprise that the post-apocalyptic series, The Walking Dead, is one of my favorite TV shows. Ever. So I'm always interested in a new take on an old favorite.

""The Returned"" (Les Revenants) 8-episode marathon aired on the Sundance Channel during Christmas holidays, and due to lots of holiday drama, I missed it. But my sister (Bless her heart!) watched it and told me about it. After checking and checking in the vain hope of a repeat marathon, I gave up and ended up purchasing the first season through Amazon Instant Video. It was very much worth the (almost) $16 of my mad money and approximately 8 hours of my time.

First, a word of warning: there are English subtitles. If you find this distracting or just simply don't care for it, this series may not work as well for you as it did for me. But, please don't dismiss it just for that because it really is tremendously good. I will say this series demands all of your attention, but I happily gave it because I was hooked like the proverbial fish from the first episode.

Each of the eight episodes titles' are named for an inhabitant of this remote Alpine village. For example, the premiere episode is ""Camille"" and introduces the first of these returning dead, a fifteen-year old teenager killed in a bus accident four years ago. Her story as well as the other Revenants like Mrs. Costa, Simon, Victor, and Serge unfold slowly and beautifully. The effects of grief and loss on the loved ones left behind is told with compassion and real understanding. The tone and visuals are remarkably creepy, as well as some of the characters like ""Victor"" and Serge. I think season 2 is expected to air sometime this year on the Sundance channel. I know I'll be front and center when it airs.",1389484800,3,2947,4.6183206106870225

5777960,5,B00D90UW42,"I am purposely not calling it a horror series because it is more of a supernatural drama similar in many respects to the U.S. program LOST or even a bit like David Lynch's TWIN PEAKS.  The series was created by Fabrice Gobert and originally shown on Canal+ in France and since has been distributed internationally.  Most recently it has been shown on The Sundance Channel.

The story is set in an idyllic, french, lakeside village at the base of the Alps. It is about the ""return"" of five individuals who had previously lived in the village and each had died under different circumstances. They are still dead but look the same as the day they died.  The focus is primarily on four of these ""returnees"".

First there is Victor, a young boy who was shot and killed along with his parents and older brother during a burglary.  He attaches himself to a young woman who has been damaged both physically and emotionally by an assault and attempted killing.  He looks upon her as his guardian angel or fairy and he is now looking for the men who killed his family.  He is both a sweet boy and an entity looking for revenge.  His beautifully haunting brown eyes hides his mysterious and painful past.

Second, there is Camille, a teenage girl who died when the school bus she was riding went over an embankment.  She is a twin and her sister, now four years older than she, has stolen her first love and Camille's primary mission is to rekindle this love without giving away her true identity.  Her family has been in mourning since her death and are overwhelmed with her reappearance but are scared at the repercussions it may cause.

Third, is Simon, a young man who died on his wedding day before he was able to say ""I DO"".  It is now ten years later and his fiance has moved on.  She was pregnant when he died and now they have a  ten year old daughter.  She is also about to marry her current boyfriend, the deputy of police in this town.  When her boyfriend realizes that her past fiance has returned he is out to make sure they do not rekindle their past romance.

Last is Sergei, a serial killer who preyed upon many young women in the village, attacking them in a tunnel under one of the roads, repeatedly stabbing them in the abdomen and eating their flesh.  Now this happened  before he was one of the 'undead"".  His mother had tried to protect him but his brother had been outraged at the sick behavior of his younger brother.  Now the Sergeir has returned and his brother must deal with this dilemma all over again.

Each episode describes the past life of one of ""the returned"" and how it is effecting them, their immediate family and close friends. At the same time that the characters return from the dead, strange phenomenon begin to happen in the town.

There is much leeway for individual interpretation with this series. I thought it was about the eternal question of what happens after death and the way most people ignore that question. We often pretend that our mortality is not worth contemplating until we have to and the fear that occurs when confronted with our mortality is put aside in our thoughts until it is absolutely necessary.  In this series the villagers are forced to literally come face to face with this issue as their loved ones, their friends and their neighbors return from dead and the question of where they have been and why they are back slowly becomes the primary focus of all.

The only issue I had with the series is that it was too short, (only eight episodes), and now after a gripping final episode it may be a year or even longer before the audience gets any answers to the questions posed in the finale.

The town itself is outside of time, lying beneath an ominously leaking dam and a drowning power station.  The series gradually introduces us to all the characters and their stories, and soon we care about them and about their relationships.  Well-written, beautifully acted, I didn't want it to be over.

When Les Revenants/The Returned based upon the film of the same name aired on Sundance, I had to watch. And I'm enthralled. ""The Returned"" is one of the best TV series of this decade. The eerie theme of the dead who return to a small, unnamed French town, is simple and yet profound. We get to see and know weird zombie twin connections, a returned serial rapist/killer, and a creepy kid named ""Victor."" And among the living is that fundamentalist Helping Hand outreach -- that's got enough food to outlast impending disaster and is armed to the teeth. And what *is* it with those dead animals floating in flood water??? How is the priest involved, what does he suspect -- or know? And then, there's the fact that *nobody* seems to be able to *leave* this town. What IS this series really about?

Is the nameless town really Purgatory, and all the people in it have been ""floating"" there since the first dam burst back in the 1970s? (This would fit nicely with it's Catholic flavor.) The Returned are the strangest zombies I've ever seen -- sure they decompose a little, but they also are able to reproduce sexually with the *living.* Weird. The Returned asks us to set aside our perceptions about death and life. It certainly made me think how I would react if my own dead came back. (I'd welcome them, I think, as long as they didn't eat brains or Service Dogs.)

The one thing for certain in the world of The Returned is that love *endures* -- especially motherly love. (Again the Catholic thing going on here.)

Spoilers

Having just watched episode 8, I was surprised to see that the entire series so far happened in only one week! It looks as though this is all about the flood, years and years ago when the dam broke and so many were killed. Some speculate that ALL of the people in the town are actually dead-it is just that the 'living' don't know it.

Regardless, since the town was once again flooded at the end of episode 8, it is certainly a reenactment of some kind. Did the authorities KNOW that the original flood was coming, and simply did not warn anyone?

Creepy Victor is still somehow a child needing protection and care. He hints that he doesn't 'mean' to hurt anyone. I am so CURIOUS to learn why all this is happening.

And why do the 'dead' want all of their own with them??? I have to say that the, ah, Sherrif (?) is pretty low, sacrificing other people's loved ones in order to get his child back, but when they want HIS wife he suddenly is willing to defend against them.

I AM glad that the twin sisters reconciled-but imagine the trauma of your loved one coming back, and then being taken from you by the 'undead'.....

Season 1 left a lot of unanswered question and left me with my mouth hanging open. For example what happened to the scar on the back of the oldest twin, Camille's sister. It just hit me, the oldest sister was experiencing what the younger or the returned twin was getting ready to go through. Twins are connected.

I had lost hope that any well-done supernatural drama existed. I am NOT a person who is patient or who likes subtitles....but PLEASE give this show a chance and start watching. The heart of the series is in the silent, eerie, no dialog moments ... this group of actors are excellent in their emotional resonance with all the feelings that pile on with the return of long dead and grieved loved ones. Add to that the slow revealing of supernatural happenings in the breath-taking Alpine village, and WOW....one has an extremely original and fascinating tale that truly gets under your skin.

5777999,5,B00D90UW42,"The Returned is not your atypical paranormal drama. Don't expect ghosts with elaborate make-up. Don't expect monsters lurking in the darkness. Don't expect predicable plot lines or to rely on your hunches on what will happen next.  Don't expect any form of logic. Do expect a rediscovery of the paranormal/horror genre.  Do expect to be spooked in the most unexpected manner.

The baseline of the story is about a small French alpine town where the town people's lives, both past and present, intertwine in complex and disturbing manners. The first episode focuses on Camille, who awoke from the location of her accident mysteriously and returned to her life as if nothing ever happened and utterly confused by the reaction of her family. The story unfolds carefully so as to not disclose the amount of time that passed nor the logic to the story. Every other episode then shifts focus onto another character, living or undead, but without missing a beat on the flow of all the story lines. Time, as does the town itself, also becomes an important character that drives the plot line. This is not particularly apparent in the first episode, but as the series goes on, it becomes more and more prevalent and important. Nevertheless, the stories are carefully pieced together and the tempo is well paced so that the audience follows all the backstories without missing a beat. That's when the creepy factor works itself in under your skin.

The creepiness and the spookiness is not derived by your atypical ghosts and monsters in the dark of the night.  Rather, as the other reviews noted, it comes from the atmosphere (mostly daytime), it comes from the environment surrounding the stories, and it also comes from the situation and the sequence of events.  You may also become emotionally invested in each character and the strange story developments will take its effect on you.

The cinematic direction is similar to Tomas Alfredson (Let the Right One In), Lars von Trier (The Kingdom), and Gus Van Sant (Elephant), who all managed to challenge their audience's expectation of what shock and horror is. They, too, utilized the mood, the atmosphere, the sets, and the natural locations to build the story.  These elements themselves become pseudo characters in the fourth dimension as something both the audience and the character can sense and feel but have no control over. In ""Let the Right One In"", it is the apartment.  In ""The Kingdom,"" it is the hospital.  In the ""Elephant,"" it is the school.  As the story unfolds in ""The Returned,"" you will begin to see this fourth dimensional ""character"" manifest itself slowly in subtle yet disturbing ways.

The artistic direction of the show is also noteworthy.  The opening credits is hauntingly beautiful and elegant.  The cinematography is very composed and effortless.  The result is a perfect blend of the paranormal and the super ordinary with the gorgeous French alps as the backdrop.",1386115200,3,2939,4.969387755102041

5778001,4,B00D90UW42,"The French series Les Revenants/The Returned aired on Sundance. The music by the Scottish band, Mogwai, is essential to the mood and feel of this series. This is a mystery, but not a who done it, it is more a question and a lot of missing parts.

The series is set in the aftermath of tragic bus accident which took the lives of an entire class of students on a school trip. The Alpine town featured in this series has beautiful scenery. We meet a young girl,climbing over an embankment onto the road and walking back to her home. She was one of the girls who perished in that tragic accident. She arrives home, goes to the refrigerator and starts eating. Her shocked mother comes into the kitchen and can't speak. Camille, the young girl apologizes for being late and says she is so hungry. She goes onto say that she doesn't know what happened, but she awoke from a nap on the side of the road. The family is confused, and in other parts of the town strange happenings are occurring. More people are showing up, the water level in the dam is dropping, the lights are going on and off. People are coming and going.

What is happening? Is Camille real? Where are the rest of the children? What happens now?

The episodes are alarming and wondrous. No zombies, just real,people arriving home from who knows where. What is to come? An inviting , scary, wonderfully acted series. A French series with subtitles.

It's the living who have problems adjusting to the inexplicable resurrection of the dead, even more than the formerly dead. The technical competence of the series is remarkable.  It is better than Orphan Black (which I like a lot, just for fun) or Silk.  It is not a soap opera like True Blood (tried but could not watch it).  By the way, I don't like The Walking Dead or zombie stuff in general.  This series is not about zombies.  I do like 28 Weeks Later a lot. Ditto for Night of the Living Dead.

The Returned (French: Les Revenants) is a television drama series created by Fabrice Gobert and shown on Canal+ in France, BeTV in Belgium and SVT in Sweden. Eight episodes were shown from 26 November to 17 December 2012. It is an adaptation of the 2004 film They Came Back (in French titled Les Revenants). Season 2 is to air in 2014.

Credit to Wiki for the synopsis:

""In a small mountain town, many dead people reappear, apparently alive and normal: road accident victim teenager Camille; suicidal bridegroom Simon; ""Victor"", a small boy who was murdered by burglars; and Serge, a serial killer. They try to resume their lives as strange phenomena occur: amongst recurring power outages, the water level of the reservoir mysteriously lowers, revealing the presence of dead animals and a church steeple, and strange marks appear on the bodies of the living and the dead.""

Let's get the obvious out of the way. Yes, the audio is in French and there are subtitles. Yes, the French are generally not known for producing TV with international appeal (the excellent series ""Spiral"" being the exception). First point: As an evolving connoisseur (like my use of French here) of international TV, I have come to actually appreciate subtitles. Why, you ask? I have found that watching a program (TV or movie) with subtitles requires a greater level of concentration (hence commitment). I can't be checking my email or playing marbles on my laptop when I have to read the subtitles. As an added benefit, I found my long forgotten high school French coming back to me, as I began to understand more of the spoken words and even some of the inflection. Second Point: It would be a huge mistake to discount Les Revenants due to the so-so reputation of French TV in general.

I was hooked after the first episode by virtue of a plot twist that I didn't see coming. I am also interested in how people live and the imagery and bleakness of the French alpine town provides the perfect backdrop to the plot. While it is not a perfect analogy and I am not even certain that it is a proper catch phrase, Les Revenants has a ""Twin-Peakish"" feel to it.

Give Les Revenants a chance and don't be scared off by the subtitles. Kudos again to Sundance for taking the chance. With ""Top of the Lake"" and Les Revenants, I can only hope that Sundance continues to introduce the USA to interesting international programming.",1385337600,4,2411,4.728571428571429

5778012,3,B00D90UW42,"I write this in the middle of episode 4 ""Victor"" and maybe I should wait until the season is over before I right this review... I may edit this as it progresses, if I can bare the show much longer.  The positive's... Great tension, suspense, and it's eerie and atmospheric, the acting is also fantastic.  The story... Small town France and all of the sudden roughly 3 years later dead loved ones start returning to the town to families, lovers,  and to complete strangers.  When they return they show no signs of age and more incredibally there isn't a SINGLE sign that distress has taken place physically, much less that they died, violently. Nor are they aware of their apparent death at all.  This isn't the only glaring plot hole, and I do mean glaring.  This is supposed to be a psychological conundrum of sorts, attempting to have you sympathize with the characters and their reaction to the returned.  Why do I say that, because each time a reveal of dead human to alive human happens, after the initial shock of the situation of course, the alive humans treats the situation as if nothing is wrong.  They so desperately want to have them back that they dare not mention the phenomena.  However as you can imagine in a small town where dead people are walking around stalking ex lovers and drinking at the only bar in town.  It manages to stay an absolute open secret, like no biggie.  Personally it's more unbelievable to me than the dead returning, how they mange to fly under the radar with so many people knowing about them.  Not only that but they have antagonists as well and still the reactions are inexplicable to me.  There is only one person who had a reasonable reaction in my mind up to this point maybe two.

This is an entertaining show and I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and the tie-ins that must be around the corner.  I'm also ready for the mounting tension to break, the alive and the dead to snap and people to start dying.  The show does have me gripped in mystery and anticipation and I like that and I recommend the show especially if you're not a stickler for detail.  If you are you will have bouts of frustration with the show but as you can see from the other reviews not many people are too distracted by these issues.  So for now it is 3 stars but like I said I may revisit this review at a later point considering I am only 4 episodes in.",1384992000,5,2391,4.407744874715262

If you need non-stop action, you'll never make it through the first 15 minutes. But, for serious drama fans this is an absorbing collection of character studies about how seemingly real people's lives are changed when their deceased relatives come home, after 4 years, 10 years, and in some cases, more than 30 years. The show is set in a beautiful mountain village in France and although I watched with English subtitles (and don't parles Francais), I was too engrossed to notice that the actors weren't speaking English. There is a big mystery here, of course. (Why is this happening?) As that mystery deepens, we become privy to the lives of these people before their loved ones died and after they returned. Name every emotion you can think of and it is beautifully explored here -- as the deceased characters try to absorb how things have changed without them and the survivors struggle to accept something their minds tell them is impossible.
