The ""Pawn Stars"" reality series has made it into a second season from the History Channel about a family-run Gold and Silver Pawn shop in Las Vegas with three generations of men assessing the value of antiques, historical items, vehicles, and junk from a number of bizarre customers in need of money.

Rick Harrison and his father affectionately coined ""The Old Man"" own the shop together. Rick's son, Corey known as ""Big Hoss"" is hoped to one day take over the shop if only he and his idiot friend, Austin ""Chumlee"" Russell were less moronic. Each person has their own style with dealing with customers, but always take the same steps to assess by asking questions, calling in experts when their own knowledge is lacking, and in the restoration process of certain items.

Rick is by far the most charismatic everyman of the bunch. He is friendly, courteous, and occasionally exercises a little bit of sympathy in the bargaining process. What is very impressive about Rick and his father are their knowledge of history and they can usually tell the customer more about their item than the customer knew walking in and that's before calling in someone to check items out for counterfeit and condition. It's a great way to learn things about history that you might never have learned before, for instance, George Washington was not the first president. There were several people who took on one year terms before the country officially became the United States of America!

""The Old Man"" is always cranky and insulting to the others who work in the shop (who more often than not deserve it) but it's enjoyable to see him get excited about an item that comes in. His face never changes expression but suddenly he moves more quickly and his voice goes above a flat line of emotion. He and Rick get into arguments over whether items were from WWI or WWII, etc. since he was in five wars or something like that. He is a fan of old cars.

Big Hoss and Chumlee are very questionable characters on the show because you keep asking yourself, can anyone be THIS dumb? THIS lazy? THIS out of shape? Just talking gets Big Hoss out of breath. There is probably quite a bit of truth in their interactions, particularly when Big Hoss is actually being responsible, but Chumlee says the most off the wall things to customers. For example, an original script owned by the actor who played Odd Job in ""Goldfinger"" came in and Chumlee pipes in with, ""I love Austin Powers!"" and later it shows him in the backroom reading the script and trying to act out the parts like a little kid. They make him test out all questionable guns since he's dumb enough to do it.

The sad thing about the show is how many people are bringing in things to pawn or sell because of ""the economic crisis"" and/or losing their job. Others have the good fortune of happening to find something in their attic, new storage bin, or were asked to haul something off and find a treasure. It is always disappointing to find out when they were ripped off and something is counterfeit or a treasured family heirloom passed down through generations turns out to have ""replica"" stamped on it somewhere.

What's great about this show besides the educational aspect is when a customer brings something in hoping to get a few hundred bucks or a new guitar and leaves with several thousand once the expert assesses the value. The Gold and Silver Pawn shop never appears to rip customers off and usually call in experts before talking price and when they don't call in the experts, they sometimes get screwed.

It is fun to check out and best when it sticks to what it does best, focusing on the unique items being brought in instead of the idiocy of the employees and giving them reality tv show subplots.

Bonus Features:

There is additional footage from many of the episodes that appear to be segments played during commercial breaks and are pretty interesting. For example, Big Hoss discusses how to tell if a diamond is real, Rick explains the differences in pocket watches, they talk about the strategy of bargaining, and you get to hear the story of how Big Hoss and Chumlee met (a fist fight).",1285804800,18,4190,4.6423751686909585
4153264,5,B003LLVVX0,"That first reviewer must have had a bad experience with a pawn shop.  Either he got mad about a deal they offered him on something he thought should have been worth more, or his dad told him some horror stories about pawn shops.

What's great about this show is all the items people try to sell.  You usually get a brief history lesson on the items brought into the shop.  It's especially great when there's a rare item involved.  Once, sometimes twice an episode, a specialist is brought in to take a look at an item to check out authentic qualities or otherwise.

It's also cool to see the negotiations take place, and to see the look on the customer's face when he's looking for a lot of money and not getting it.

Now since this is a reality show, the other factor of the show is ""the characters"" - The Harrison family who own the pawn shop over in Las Vegas.  There's Rick, his father referred to as The Old Man, and Rick's son Cory - Big Hoss.  And of course, there's Chumlee.  Chumlee, or Chum for short, is a friend of Cory's who worked there since he was 21 - and has become a trademark on the show.  Chumlee is kinda dumb, and pretty damn goofy.  If you ask a person about the show - usually they'll mention Chumlee.

Damn good show",1285200000,8,1242,4.256410256410256
4153265,5,B003LLVVX0,The other rewiewer is out of his mind. This show is great and shows how to negotiate in a fair way. This dvd comes with 32 episodes.,1285027200,8,132,3.925925925925926
4153266,1,B003LLVVX0,"Season two?!  Are you kidding me?  How did this get picked up again?

The only thing this show manages to teach you -- and teach you well it does -- is never to sell anything to a pawn shop.  Head for eBay instead.

The show consists of one segment after another of some chump getting way less for his item than he could have, had he been a little smarter about it.

Extremely unsatisfying TV.",1283904000,4,393,4.173333333333333

The series is very entertaining, the characters make for funny situations. While the object in question keep you wondering how much they are worth and how much are they willing to pay. If it becomes included again I'll finish watching the series.",1424390400,,481,4.593023255813954

4153276,4,B003LLVVX0,Pawn Stars is another in the history channels line of informative reality shows.  The characters are generally interesting minus Chumlee who comes across as too dumb and lazy to possibly be true.  The items that come into the shop and their history are unique and it's always fun to see what they will buy and what things are worth.  Good informative family show without all the over the top bickering and fighting of some other family reality shows (I'm looking at you American Chopper).,1420675200,,488,4.785714285714286

These guys just crack me up!  I never fail to have some good laughs, and especially love Chumlee!
I discovered the program by chance when looking up one of my favorites -  the History Channel.
Strange that I am a fan of the Smithsonian Channel, and Discovery as well... always learning something...
Pawn stars is really a departure from my usual entertainment... but I find these well-learned comics very refreshing... a great stress reliever!  Keep up the good work Grampa, Rick, Big Hoss, and Chumlee!",1413244800,,648,4.81981981981982

4153340,4,B003LLVVX0,"The interesting thing about Pawn Stars is that it gives you an education in history and one in business.
You also get a better appreciation of what ""valuable"" means in the real world.
Not bad for a half hour show.",1403740800,,213,4.35
4153341,5,B003LLVVX0,"""Pawn Stars"" the surprise hit on the History Channel, is now one of the few shows they have that actually tells you interesting facts about history. This is such a clever idea--the Las Vegas pawn store business run by a grumpy grandfather (""The Old Man""), his middle aged son Rick--the one who really runs it--and who knows an amazing amount a  out history--his tattooed grandson ""Big Hoss', and their friend, funny and endearing ""Chumlee"".

Two things make this show work for me:first, the characters who are fresh and original and have a real, quirky sometimes prickly, sometimes funny, relationship (not like the many clones the History Channel has experimented with ever since they realized this was a hit). Second, is their pawn business itself, which is not your basic, ""Hey, what'll you give me for my grandma's Timex watch?""

On any given show, they may have someone come in with a Superbowl ring from 1964, a signed Salvador Dolly print,  a gorgeous Samurai sword from the 16th century (or is it a reproduction?), the battle plans for D-Day (or are they a copy?), a Les Paul guitar signed by Les Paul, a first edition Huckleberry Finn (or is it?) or a 6 -foot tall ""Steiff"" Teddy bear from the 1930s ""found in grandma's attic"". People come in mostly wanting to sell, not pawn (it's illegal to show a pawn deal on television) and you learn interesting things about the items. Although Rick is amazingly knowledgeable about many items, he often calls in experts who confirm the value--or, sometimes, dash the hopes--for the owner. Then they bargain. Sometimes they leave the store to try out a gun or a plane (or more often a car or motorcycle).

The relationships and the items and even the pricing and the bargaining really hold your interest -- I even like the little ""multiple choice trivia questions"" that come just before and after the commercials. This is a fun way to learn about interesting history--like a much more fun and even wacky ""Antiques Roadshow""--great for the whole family, even kids will start liking the characters and then get interested in the stories behind the items. Highly recommended. (And Rick's a good businessman who describes the surprising behind-the-scenes of running a pawn shop in Las Vegas--has even written a book about it that's quite a good read,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/License-to-Pawn-Deals-Steals-and-My-Life-at-the-Gold-Silver/dp/1401324304/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">License to Pawn: Deals, Steals, and My Life at the Gold & Silver</a>",1403740800,,2533,5.229064039408867

4153351,5,B003LLVVX0,"My wife and I love the show and really like the old man and his son Rick but we can't stand Corey & Chumlee as they are arrogant, overbearing and knowitalls and absolutely do not listen to their experienced elders and do not know how to treat customers.

4153353,4,B003LLVVX0,Reminded me of antiques roadshow but with many more swear words! A fun look into a family business and dynamic.,1399939200,,111,4.6

4153356,5,B003LLVVX0,"This is a very entertaining show full of interesting items and characters. Learning some of the background to the items that come into the pawn shop is very interesting.

4153358,4,B003LLVVX0,I've always liked this show.  It's interesting to see the many things that people bring into the pawn shop.  The antics and banter among the shop's staff adds entertainment to the show which actually educates the audience in antiques and history as well as other things.

4153365,5,B003LLVVX0,I actually watched this with my 5th grade class because we had been talking and reading about Paul Revere. Loved that Paul Revere spoon and the history that went with it.,1393545600,,170,4.516129032258065

4153375,4,B003LLVVX0,"Tv is of course a personal choice but I find pawn stars entertaining to watch. It is sort of like Antiques Road show where any item at all will show up for appraisal and the fun for me is trying to access their value in advance. The family who runs the pawn shop are entertaining too... they are,always bickering among themselves. Since the show takes place in las Vegas, I do wonder just how many of the customers who walk in the door are looking to hock their possessions ( or perhaps someone else's, ) for some quick gambling money. In any event, it is a fun time-passer for me, especially if one subscribes to PRIME... watch as many episodes  as you like without commercial s.",1390867200,,680,4.396825396825397

4153379,1,B003LLVVX0,I only rated this volume so i could ask this question.  Why I am I asked to rate these two volumes when I did not order them or view them?,1389830400,,138,3.6
4153380,5,B003LLVVX0,just to meet these colorful characters :).  I hope the show goes on for many more seasons....and Chum Lee doesn't give Rick and the Old Man a heart attack.,1389830400,,155,4.344827586206897
4153381,1,B003LLVVX0,Low class and low character team solely focused on their own profitability. The character of the father is certainly reflected in the offspring.,1389830400,,144,5.304347826086956

4153383,1,B003LLVVX0,My husband watch the show all the time but we always think that the insulting of Chumblee goes too far... almost to the point of bullying.. I can't find out who plays the Chumblee character. He does a great job... but we think he should be shown in a better light on some shows.  he is a supporting part but should be shown from time to time as  a good loyal employee not just as a big dumb clown.  fans from Indiana,1389312000,,416,4.048780487804878

4153388,5,B003LLVVX0,"Starting with 2009's Fired Up, ending with License to Pawn & there's some Bonus stuff too! But the packaging is a misnomer as it's NOT the full Season. History SHOULD have done each FULL Season 1, 2 & so on. It's not right & it's not fair if you're a true Fan, which we are. We keep hoping there will be more DVDS released as they are over 2 yrs. behind. NOT the Harrison's Fault(not even Chum's fault this time!)",1388016000,,413,4.175

4153394,3,B003LLVVX0,"My first watching of the series started up before Monday Night Raw came on, and un-doubtedely it was one of those shows that had great antics. The one that got me the most would have to be the old man himself. He wasn't meaning to be funny most of the time, but his anger fits were enough to make even a deaf man laugh. Just the expressions his face made me chuckle. The other characters were a hit as well, but the owner of Pawn Stars had the spotlight for this season. Especially on the episode ""Old Man's Booty"". It was a fun ride full of antics that may have even made the Old man grin.",1383264000,,590,4.094827586206897

4153397,4,B003LLVVX0,They always make me laugh at the end of each episode. It usually involves the old man or chum Lee.,1381276800,,98,3.95
4153398,5,B003LLVVX0,Love it and watch it often. Its the best show on prime and I will watch everyday of my membership,1380412800,,97,3.9

4153402,5,B003LLVVX0,I like finding out the historical aspects of items. But this show can be over the top when it comes to dumb and dumber. I watch it for the items not for the stupid antics.,1378425600,,171,3.914285714285714

Rick is fairly engaging but the rest of the cast is so-so

It's actually quite educational as many of the items, weapons and historic documents are from the Revolutionary or Civil War period.  Interesting to see the look on people's faces when they find out sometimes the family heirloom that's been around for decades is a fake.

4153444,4,B003LLVVX0,"This is a great show. I love to see the different items that come into the store and hear the history behind them. It turns out to be a rather informative show.

The only negative for me is how mean they are to each other. I know that that adds ""comedy"" and ""drama"" to the show but it's almost over the top sometimes.",1366329600,,317,4.031746031746032

4153446,3,B003LLVVX0,What I like most about the show is finding out the value of old items and memorabilia. The shop owner trio dynamics annoys me at times and I find the lack of professionalism to their son's friend who is an employee distasteful and down right mean.,1365897600,,247,4.391304347826087

I have learned so much about the value of various things and what to look for to keep from getting taken advantage of. Everyone at some point in their life buys and/or sells something.

4153461,4,B003LLVVX0,"My family and I enjoy watching Pawn Stars because we learn many historical facts and information in an entertaining way.  Often times we go on a journey to find out not only how value an item is, but why it's valuable and what the history is behind it.  All of that plus the humorous conversation between the family and workers at the pawn shop, they pick on each other in a down to earth fashion that usually doesn't get too heavy like many other real TV shows.",1363219200,,462,4.2988505747126435
4153462,3,B003LLVVX0,While I enjoyed the theme and I like the idea of folks turning in heirlooms for cash.  I didn't care for the lack of integrity and the pompous opportunistic attitude of the folks at Pawn Stars.

4153472,5,B003LLVVX0,"Rewatching these in order on Amazon Prime, it's easier to see the show's popularity growing, and it become more divorced from reality. Still, I like the show, but the fake alternate storylines and the fact that an expert seems to examine every item before the fact makes it less of a show about pawn shops and more of antiques roadshow in a different setting.",1361491200,,359,4.625
4153473,3,B003LLVVX0,"This show is still pretty interesting. People still bring in interesting things. I could still really do without the bad language (which is experienced as frequent waves of bleeping""). The family drama still typically comes across as contrived too.",1361232000,,248,5.384615384615385

4153477,5,B003LLVVX0,I really enjoy learning more about things and seeing what they look like when they are restored.  Pawn Stars gives one a more real price for things than some other shows.,1360454400,,170,4.483870967741935
4153478,4,B003LLVVX0,I really enjoy this show. Its both informative but more importantly entertaining. The relationship between the three generation of the pawn shop owners is fun to watch especially the old man. Chumlee (friend of the youngest owner) is hysterical and should get his own show.,1360454400,,273,5.088888888888889
4153479,5,B003LLVVX0,Awesome show of antiques and great cast of personalities to discuss these artifacts. I would compare this to a newer Antiques Roadshow.,1360454400,,135,5.181818181818182

So I'm not gonna talk about the show, I'm gonna talk about what everybody is talking about and that is the PATHETIC history channel.  BEWARE!!!!! Most of the DVDs they offer are not the full season. They are using a lame advertising tactic to make you buy this DVD which costs $2 a show. Absolutely ridiculous!!! Please make them do something about this and go to the historychannel.com and write to them how unhappy you are. I read numerous other people being upset about this and it pissed me off too so I wrote to them. Please pass the word so they can fix this and give us the ENTIRE season.

Now about this DVD itself, I decided to buy it because I thought this was the only season out of all offered that was complete. After getting it, I still think it's not. Very sad! :( Shame on you history channel!",1333411200,6,922,4.323699421965318

4153485,5,B003LLVVX0,I just finished this DVD set and I can say that the series is continuing as well as the 1st season. The Old Man is as crusty & funny as ever. The only things that I do not like is how badly everyone is treating Chumlee and I am sorry to hear that Peaches got fired.,1288051200,3,265,3.75
4153486,5,B003LLVVX0,"I enjoyed season one so much that I purchased season two. What is realllly great is there are noooo commercials.  I purchased the DVDs for the entertainment value, not education.  The value of any one item can go up or down any day faster than the stock market. The interaction between the Harrisons is entertaining, although I wish they would cut Chumlee a bit more slack. (Doncha just love the old man's hat?) Actually, the folks who rehabilitate items that look as if they had been dredged from the landfill are more interesting than the customers. Their work is frequently amazing. The experts are an important show component.  The constant turnover required to meet overhead must be gruelling.  If any education is involved in the show it is that, if something is valuable there is a large chance it is a fake. Lots of viewing fun for a rainy afternoon.",1287187200,3,858,4.7

8399727,5,B003LLVVX0,"I am officially hooked on Pawn Stars. I really do enjoy this series. It just gets better and better. At first I wasn't absolutely sure about Rick and the Old Man but now I know that they really are who they portray themselves to be. They are extremely interesting gentlemen who have a lot of knowledge pertaining to the world of 'odd stuff'. Occasionally they do get stumped when a really peculiar item comes into the shop to be sold. I enjoy seeing those episodes. Rick gets 'creeped out' over certain types of items too. I am thinking he might be just a tad superstitious. The grandson ""Big Hoss"" is pretty neat too. I think he will eventually get to the level that his dad and grandfather have obtained. I am not so sure about Chum. He seems to be the least realistic person on the show. Nobody could possibly be as dumb as he seems to be and hold down that job. But now that I think about it, he might be the smartest one - by playing so dumb, he gets out of a lot of work. Something to consider. Anyway, this is an enjoyable series that you can watch with your entire family. It has something in it for everybody. Good entertainment with some history thrown in to boot!",1428624000,2,1174,4.292792792792793
