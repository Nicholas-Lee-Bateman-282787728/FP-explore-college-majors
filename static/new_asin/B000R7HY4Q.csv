We see many of his items on display with guests like BILLY MARTIN and MICKEY MANTLE who had used parts of his memorablia in his restaurant. We can easily see that BARRY is a lifetime baseball fan. As for the other program,it deals with the art of collecting or how a kid pastime became a huge business. If you are a true baseball fan,you are gonna like this a lot.",1515456000,,477,4.252747252747253
8199101,5,B000R7HY4Q,"The collection this gentleman has is fantastic. His house is like a minature baseball hall of fame.

The story of how he got started collecting his baseballs as a child and meeting the players that he did is a dream come true for any baseball fan.

To see Billy Martin and Mickey Mantle was great.

I've watched this movie many times and show it to baseball fans whenever they come over my house.",1300752000,2,396,4.397260273972603
8199102,5,B000R7HY4Q,"I bought this based on it's description and wanted to check it out. I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it. It consists of 2 shows. One covers the Barry Halper collection, which was later sold at auction in 1999. It was probably the single largest and comprehensive private baseball collection ever. It is truly amazing to see. The second show talks about baseball card collecting and how it changed in the early 1990's. As a baseball card and memorabilia collector, I enjoyed it thoroughly. If you collect, this is a must see video.",1264809600,9,539,4.74468085106383
