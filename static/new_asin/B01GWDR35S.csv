8764080,4,B01GWDR35S,"Made four years before J. Lee Thompson's ""Eye of the Devil"" (produced by the British branch of MGM) and also taken from a literary source, ""La vergine de Norimberga"" has a similar story about a wife who decides to investigate the dark side of her husband's affairs while visiting the man's castle in an European village, and both are in the end realistic stories with a sinister facade. While the tale of the British movie is rooted on frightening manifestations of folklore and tradition in France, this one has a political secret behind the mystery and the horror in Germany. But the similarities vanish in the visuals, for ""Eye of the Devil"" is in black and white and has a cold leading lady (played by Scandinavian Deborah Kerr), in opposition to ""The Virgin of Nuremberg"" which is in vivid colors and led by a fiery protagonist (played by Mediterranean Rossana Podest&agrave;). Both women are brave characters and not precisely screaming queens, and although there are some screams here and there, they are moved by undaunted curiosity, decidedly firm in their quest to find the truth. Much in the vein of Roger Corman's Poe adaptations, Podest&agrave; wanders, runs and hides in corridors, torture chambers, dungeons and gardens; there are some miniatures that evoke Ulmer's fascinations with scale models, Christopher Lee plays a scarred servant, and Riz Ortolani provided a highly dramatic score.
