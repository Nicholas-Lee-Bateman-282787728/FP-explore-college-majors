1664824,1,B00005U8F4,"This dog of a film suffers greatly from poor acting, fails to even remotely follow what REALLY happened, and contains an absolute muriad of continuity mistakes. Purists will be offended, while unfortunately most people will be enamured purely by the special effects - which are the only things that make this waste of film watchable",1010188800,9,332,5.054545454545455
1664825,5,B00005U8F4,"This is a true story about a relatively unknown event during World War I.
The film was done in the same style as Saving Private Ryan. When action was happening, the cameras were right there. Plenty of detail added to the authenticity. It is especially interesting for anyone that is familiar to the ways in which warfare was fought toward the end of WWI.
Bayonets! Man, I'd hate to have been a soldier at this time....  Some of the scenes are not for the squeamish. The film holds nothing back...
I have seen the film twice in the last three nights. I am still picking up information. In my opinion, the cast did an excellent job of bringing this film to life. Even from the German point of view, this must be a good film. The details in the trenches as well as the ""no man's land""...  The weapons used...  It all makes for a good film.
It is a definite must for any collector of war films.",1007596800,187,890,4.285714285714286

This was a tough battle of WWI so expect graphic fighting, bloodshed, and dismemberment. It probably depicts reality that men faced then, like my grandfather who survived. Rick Schroder is brilliant in his performance as leader. Sometimes it appears, feels like to be live footage caught in the battle segments, but I know it's not. Just good directing and acting. Action packed is understating it. It will alert you to what Veterans' Day is really all about.

Even though lots of movies have a touch of Hollywood, The story of The Lost Battalion warrants being told

Same mentality as the 2001 ""Pearl Harbour"" (in which history becomes a mere background to the plot). We have here a bunch of cocky New Yorkers who ""will never surrender or retreat because they all come from tough neighborhoods"", pleeeease spare me!... They refer to each other as ""Jews, Dagos, Polacks, Micks and Whops"", etc., and, lost in the mix, a one lonely guy from Montana with a badly faked Mid-western accent, yet they all use university-level, grammatically correct language and within just a day  combat, they treat each other like brothers - love among all nations is so good, it makes you loose all cuss words! The battalion is led by a Major who is a New York lawyer in his civilian life, not a career military officer - not explained how did that happen in 1918 - voluntary enlistment, maybe?!...; anyway, who cares, we shouldn't let the facts stay in the way of the point to be made: a civilian intellectual has not only more compassion, but also more combat spirit, military discipline (routinely asks his soldiers torn apart by shrapnel and covered up in dirt, sweat and blood to keep their tunics ""buttoned up"" to the neck) and he is an all around superior human being than all of his career superior officers; audience, heed and do not ever join the military!...;  about mid-way thru the movie, the Serge get his shoulder blade impaled by a large wood splinter sticking out about a foot off his back like a coat hanger and then he proceeds to go about his normal combat duties for a few more days with that thing in his back - no infection, no bleeding, no fever, and can't even guess him being discomforted by it too much, while his joking ""my mother always told me I should find a place to hang my hat"" - cute!... Unlike their American counterparts hunkered down inside dusty wooden bunkers field HQ with dirt falling thru the roof planks, the German HQ officers, on the other hand, are inside a country estate, are all impeccably clean dressed and drink coffee out of fine porcelain cups. Judging by the fact that they share the same battlefield and for a heck of a lot more many years than the Americans, and considering that they were just a few weeks away from the stalemate of the armistice, this is truly an amazing stretch even from a sanitized historian! The ending is the worst: The general salutes the Major and the Major in disgust of... (I am not sure what he is disgusted about), does not return the salute and we are supposed to believe that the Major gets away with it! Just one day in the boot camp would have made all the difference to meet with a little reality. The thing that bothered me the most, it is that no attempt was made to develop a sense of purpose for which these soldiers decided supposedly to fight to the bitter end(?...); this is key, as they were obviously not fighting for their homeland, but dragged across an ocean to fight for,... what? This, while still part of a larger debate, needed to be much better developed. No army would ever dismiss surrendering and overcome an extremely high threshold of tolerance without having developed a firm belief in whatever is that they believe in. Lacking that, this movie is no more than a video-game. In reality, this battalion was fighting for simple survival because they were indeed ""lost"" in a forward operating position and cut off from the front lines. This should have been a story of survival under most adverse circumstances, not a story of,... I don't even know what this story was supposed to be about?!",1473552000,2,3740,4.622556390977444

In the subsequent battle the Battalion was all but wiped out.

Based on all the hamming up actors did in this movie, I would guess very little of it reflects what really happened. However that is fairly common with movies that are trying to depict a complex event like a battle that lasted multiple days. It is very hard to do a good job of that in a few hours.

 As a war movie in a generic sense, it was pretty good. No doubt the purists will complain about the lack of authenticity. There are some really good special effects in this movie that make it more realistic looking and that adds to the watchability at least.",1470614400,,852,4.120481927710843

1664907,5,B00005U8F4,"One of the more inspiring films in my entire home video collection is The Lost Battalion, a 2001  made-for-TV movie from A&E Network.  ""The Lost Battalions stars include Ricky Schroder (billed in the film as Rick Schroder), Phil McKee, and Jamie Harris. Written by Jim Carabatsos and directed by Russell Mulcahy, it tells the true story of a U.S. Army battalions heroic defense of a small area in the Argonne Forest during the last days of World War I.

In October 1918, Major Charles Whittlesey (Schroder) leads his battalion of 600 American soldiers to Charlevaux Mill, deep inside the Argonne Forest. His orders are to capture this location and hold it until relieved. The battalion is soon completely cut off from its sources of supply and is surrounded by the German army. The Germans repeatedly launch heavy attacks against Whittlesey and his men, who are also bombarded by their own artillery. Whittlesey and his executive officer, Captain George McMurtry (McKee), steadfastly determine to hold their position as ordered at all costs.  They inspire their men with superior leadership qualities and uncommon courage under fire. (Whittlesey and McMurtry each later receive the Medal of Honor for their actions at Charlevaux Mill.)

The Lost Battalion is one of the better war films Ive seen in quite a while. It does a credible job of telling its story with historical accuracy. The acting and writing are excellent throughout the films 100-minute runtime.

Combat scenes are realistically bloody and violent. Filmmakers used  the latest in handy-cam filming techniques  similar to whats found in Saving Private Ryan  to bring full brutality of war to the screen. My only criticism is that instead of using the current standard 16x9 aspect ratio, filmmakers chose the older 1.37:1 (4x3) format instead.

Despite this minor technical flaw, The Lost Battalion is a first-rate war film about a little-known event in World War I. I draw great inspiration from it every time I watch it. Highly recommended.",1467763200,23,2006,5.107033639143731

Should be mandatory in every high school history class.  To those who nitpick possible historic angles, I say----give the producers a break!  An uncle of mine was a WW 1 vet who reluctantly discussed the horrors of that era's battlefield and I think this movie does a superb job.  He also spoke of an incident where a German officer actually refused to wipe-out an American squad which had run-out of ammo, and let them withdraw during one of the ""woods"" campaigns.

Rick Shroder's lines are often more legendary than factual and sometimes downright cheesy.  This is a movie that needs to be given time to develop, it is a movie that needs to be told in 2 1/2 hours instead of 1 1/2.

1664951,4,B00005U8F4,"Excellent movie, great story, nice historical film about a group of tough Americans in a poorly coordinated battle.  The film shows why the warring parties fought to a stalemate, given what behaviors the Germans expected from the American forces based on German battle tactics. In a disturbingly realistic scene, the Germans, being desperate to chase the stubborn Americans out of their woods, used flamethrowers to kill and horrify the Americans into submission.  Whittlesly's historically accurate resolve and ability to adapt to various German battle tactics, was well done and seemed appropriate, given written history.  Rick Schroder is an EXCELLENT Whittlesly, very believable.

Very good special effects, very good sound. Overall a Great War movie from the infrequently covered WWI.  I docked the film 1 star due to the exaggerated use of NY City colloquialisms. Though the makeup of the US combatants had a number of New Yorkers, I thought some of it was overdone.

For 5 straight days Major Charles Whittlesey, a civilian attorney turned enlisted soldier, as portrayed by Rick Schroder, in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds, held off the German advance with no food, water or reserve ammunition. In addition too, sustaining bombardments from friendly fire because the communication lines were cut, as was their supply. Directed by Russell Mulcahy, this original A & E movie, depicts the heroic stand by American soldiers from the U.S. Army's 77th Division, 308th Battalion and all that they were subjected too and actually withstood before they were rescued. A mere, five weeks before the entire war, ended. For his valiant efforts, Major Charles Whittlesey was rightfully awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. For holding his position and for keeping his men fighting, under constant assaults and lack of provisions. This A & E, single, DVD, disc packs a powerful wallop in the face of constant adversity. An awe-inspiring, true-life, story of heroism with non-stop action and World War I adventure. A big-screen tribute to the to the United States 77th Army, 308th Battalion in France during WWI.

Due to the demand for bodies they were reluctantly inducted. Before the war  they were considered lower orders of humanity and not really American,Not likely to be able to ever be true Americans. They fought very well.
The Black unit was given to the FRench ARmy and did extremely well. They were not discriminated against and received high unit honors.

 The  upper class ANGLo guy ( Whittlesey)was the commander. He eventually commited suicide,after the war. Its not a pretty picture behind this very well done movie.",1427328000,,899,5.2727272727272725

Their tenacity in battle and refusal to give up frustrates the German commander.  When one of the men is captured by the Germans he tells the commander that he and his fellow soldiers are a bunch of American Gangsters, when asked why will not surrender by the German commander.  Rick Schroder is a good actor.  This is a made for TV movie and it is very enjoyable and I enjoyed watching it.  The movie is well written and well directed. I found it a bit confusing to keep track of all the soldiers and who lived and who died, but most war movies are like that.  I recommend this movie.",1420070400,,754,4.3428571428571425

1665104,4,B00005U8F4,"A very impressive performance by Rick Schroder as the WWI Major Charles Whittlesey who, against his better wishes, was ordered to take his 600 who were short on food, water and ammunition into the Argonne Forrest of which they had little intelligence on.  They successfully followed him to take the area only to be cutoff and surrounded by the German army.  They were lied to by an aggressive general and told the French army was on one flank and the Americans on the other.  In reality they were stranded and on their own without any supplies and low on ammunition fighting hand to hand to hold their little spot.  They were reduced to taking used bandages off the dead to use on the wounded.  Schroder did an excellent job as a quiet lawyer in wire rimmed glasses now being thrust into a war that he believed we should not have been in and forced to lead his men into a battle that he deemed as suicide.  He made a point of telling the general that he doubted if the general would ever see him or his men again.  Excellent movie and very well done.  Russell Mulcahy did a good job of developing an insight to some of the soldiers that made you care about them.",1415232000,,1162,4.372093023255814

1665127,3,B00005U8F4,"This is a wonderful story and worth telling and the letters home was a nice touch.  The biggest problem I had is that it is a promotional for Ricky Schroder.  Apparently he is not getting enough work and is using this to attract roles for movies.  His face is stamped above all else on the cover and in the extras it lists his biography and previous work (filmography) and does not offer any information on the other actors or even the director.  Personally, there are right ways and wrong ways of doing things, and if you are out promoting yourself, it should not be done via a true story.  It is a good movie and deserves a better rating but this movie is not about the Lost Battalion so much as it is all about Ricky Schroder.",1407024000,,729,4.291970802919708

It is realistic with great acting on both sides of the trench.  It is realistic and probably not for younger adolescents.  The uniforms, weapons and equipment are accurate to the time period.

Very well done movie and historically sound.",1404172800,,402,4.32
1665131,5,B00005U8F4,"This is a 99% true story of the 77th Division, 308th Battalion of World War I.

I say 99% because there were so many other horrific incidents that actually happened that are not in this picture. Why? Time. There is only so much you can fit on a 90-minute video.

Yet, what is on the video, is 100% accurate.

How do I know?

My father-in-law was one of the few that walked out of the Argonne Forest.

This epic remembrance (I refuse to call it a ""story"") is just that - a remembrance of what these fine young men experienced while surrounded by the German's while defending France.

This remembrance is horrifying, memorable, sad and yet, leave you a feeling of pride for those wonderful Americans who fought and died to help an ally, a friend. It makes you stand up a bit straighter as you witness the few men who survived.....many to succumb to the lung cancer or TB that invaded their lungs from being huddled with their dead comrades for so long.

Rick Schroder did a phenomenal job as Col. Wittesly who at first, had no idea what he was doing. Each day for him was a lesson in progress and learn he did!

This is a real MUST see video.....a tribute to our awesome fighting men and women and a true very often untold part of our history.",1403481600,18,1241,4.341991341991342

Surrounded and decimated, out of contact with their command, starving and scared, these men did their duty even when, as with the commander, they didn't agree with the U.S. being involved in the War.

1665162,5,B00005U8F4,"On the whole, the First World War was wholesale slaughter, valor was equal to suicide, especially on the Western Front.

This movie, The Lost Battalion tells the tale of a battalion of the 77th Infantry Division which was cut off from friendly units in the Argonne Forest in 1918.  The division heroically holds out for days against German counterattacks.

This movie is filmed in the gritty, hand-held camera way, much like Saving Private Ryan and it is equal to that movie in portraying the gore of combat.

In this movie, Ricky Schroder shines as Major Charles Whittlesey, the valiant commander of the battalion.  In many ways, the stories of the American veterans of the First World War are untold, their valor has long since been superseded by the veterans of the Second World War.  This movie brings to the surface what had been submerged.",1369872000,2,845,4.833333333333333

Most WWI war movies use the Springfield which is incorrect.  Only Marines were armed with the Springfield while the US Army fought with the venerable P-17.  They finally got it right.

1665170,4,B00005U8F4,"This is a great film about an infantry commander in World War I.  Yes, trench warfare, all that stuff.  He doesn't believe in the war, but he's here, and he's been ordered to attack when he is sure that such an attack will lead to his men's deaths.  But he's a good soldier, and he leads his mean forward through the hell of trench warfare, and unlike all the other commanders, he refuses to retreat, and he refuses to surrender.  Ultimately, they are trapped behind enemy lines, but they still won't give up, and as it becomes increasingly apparent, the Germans really need them to do just that.

Mostly I got this because I was interested in seeing what kind of actor Rick Schroeder grew up to be (a good one, it turns out), but I was really impressed by the battlefield scenes and the grit of his fellow officers.

As in many other accounts of war, both in actual events as well as in fiction, bonds are formed between men whose lives so clearly depend on one another.

The battle scenes were certainly exciting.  Most of the fighting seemed plausible.  I would have liked, however, to have heard a little discussion between the Major and his men on how to neutralize the Storm Troops armed with flamethrowers.  Would somebody actually try to tackle and knife a German with flamethrower instead of shooting him--or were they really so low on ammunition at that point?

As for the scenes in which the high-ranking German officers back at headquarters professed such a high degree of admiration for these Americans--they seemed too unlikely to take seriously.",1338163200,,920,5.019736842105263

The filming was good, great special effects and all the acting was above average. For a look at WWI I recommend watching this movie and for an unforgettable WWI book,  reading ""The Guns of August.""

  As a former combat infantryman who was wounded a few times I'm not a fan of the term Acceptable Loss or losses which is why it was the title of my first book on the Vietnam War, told from an Infantry Soldier's Perspective. What is 'Acceptable' to some, cost everything to those caught in the category.
  When I heard the term used in the movie it jarred me because what the movie portrays, and portrays well, are the sacrifices the grunts go through to achieve a general's goal. Rick Schroder and the cast do an excellent job in demonstrating the hardships, horror, and cost of what the actual soldiers endured during their ordeal in the Argonne Woods. While a few may criticize its overall production value, I personally found it to be convincing enough. We don't always need bigger explosions or special CGI graphic designs to carry a story that the actors do so well on their own.

The Lost Battalion is the name given to nine companies of the United States 77th Division, roughly 554 men, isolated by German forces during World War I after an American attack in the Argonne Forest in October 1918. Roughly 197 were killed in action and approximately 150 missing or taken prisoner before 194 remaining men were rescued. They were led by Major Charles White Whittlesey.
To be honest the Movie does glorify the United States but that is to be expected because this is just a movie. The movie does kind of make the Germans look a little stupid but at least doesn't demonize them like in Flyboys.

This is a story about the men and the situation, and does a more than adaquate job of conveying the essentials.

Given the number of WWII movies with an American theme, I found it pleasing to watch one with a WWI perspective as there aren't as many. It was valuable to see some of the methods that were used in war from that period; such as using carrier pigeons to relay messages to Head Quarters. The narrative is mainly focused on an American Infantry Battalion that maintains its line, despite other allies falling back from positions on their flanks, and fighting gallantly to subdue a well equipped enemy. For the most part of their contact with the German's their exact position is unknown by command, which means that they must fight with increasing casualties and depleting resources.

The Real Story is the men of the Lost Battalion. They gave full measure of heroics and honor. Rick Schroder did an outstanding of playing the Major. He portrayed a new officer thrown into the Gates of Hell and came back with honor and dignity. I would follow him all the way. His men did.

1665221,4,B00005U8F4,"Yes the Americans were late for both World wars but they didn't half make an impact. Some have said that this is one of the few American films about WW 1 and I feel this type of film really ought to be encouraged. In actual fact the Americans have been making excellent WW1 films since Hollywood began including 'All Quiet on the Western Front' (3 versions), 'Sergeant York' the awful 'Fly Boys (that's the one with the lion and is like a dumbed up 'Pearl Harbor)and many more. The difference is this is new and is firmly set in the retelling of the horrors of war. And the Americans fired more shells on their first day in action than during the entire Civil War, so their commitment should never be underestimated.

The plot is one which happened many times in the 'Great War' and that is a battalion goes forward believing it is supported on both flanks, alas they are not and due to a breakdown in communication they stay put and decide to battle it out despite facing a hopeless situation. It is based on actual events and it is lovely to see carrier pigeons being shown in action as they were vital, the French almost exclusively relied upon them at one point.

The acting is all excellent and the plot unfolds in real time in that there are no flash backs which are often used to build empathy with the characters and the audience (i.e. they are not just soldiers but husbands, sons etc. That could lead to the charge of non character development, but the film does not suffer from this as the humanity is clear from the start. At 92 minutes long it flew by and for followers of war films and more explicitly WW 1 this is highly recommended and almost as good as the excellent 'Beneath Hill 60'Beneath Hill 60 [DVD] [2010] in terms of accuracy and compelling story line.",1302566400,4,1777,4.447852760736196
1665222,5,B00005U8F4,"Just a month before the war ended, a single battalion of 600 men managed to advance against heavy German resistance and reached their objective, even when the rest of the division managed not to. Misled by his commanding general's insistence that the Americans and French troops are still supporting his flank, a young Jewish lawyer out of New York, and now a Major in the U.S. Army, stubbornly tells his men not to give ground and must hold at all costs against the German infantry that launch desperate assaults against his line of men that continue to fight without food, water, or much medical aid. His battalion is made up of veteran officers and Polish, Jews, and Italians out of New York that amaze the Germans with their continuous resistance. Sadly, barely 175 men remain of his battalion when they are finally relieved, and the Major hears his general after his arrival as he inquires, ""Where's the rest of your battalion?"" while looking around at the stunned, dirty, and battered survivors in the shrunken perimeter.
We must not forget these men for what they had accomplished barely a hundred years ago, even after the recent passing of the last WWI doughboy. And let's not forget that after the Major and two of his captains won the Medal of Honor, the Major went on to being promoted to lieutenant-colonel, but soon became broke and depressed after the war ended. Unable to deal with the horrors that nearly destroyed his men in his memories, he committed suicide by jumping overboard off a ship in 1921, but the fates of what happened to his survivors have been forgotten.

It's no wonder there was a movie made about them. This unit had such a profound effect on our national identity and it's quite sad that so few people now and days don't have a clue about it. First off, the tomb of the unknown soldier at Arlington Cemetery was first started to commemorate one of the unidentified remains of a soldier from the lost battalion. Second, Major Whittlesey was awarded the first medal of honor from WWI and he was also one of the pall bearers at the laying of the tomb of the unknown soldier. What A&E leaves out is that several years after the battle it claimed its last casualty in Major Whittlesey when he disappeared during a cruise across the Atlantic. It is rumored that he committed suicide because in his cabin the authorities found a note left by the Major apologizing for not being able to stop the artillery strike soon enough and he also left his medal of honor to Captain McMurtry. I commend A&E for bringing the story of the lost battalion to light.

He's of German descent and speaks fluent German, so I'm willing to take his word for that part.  But he himself recommended the movie to me as a reasonably accurate and well-made portrayal of the story.",1291593600,,490,4.951219512195122
1665226,5,B00005U8F4,"World War I is largely forgotten today, but for absolute carnage in a localized place -- the trenches of the Western Front -- no one has seen the like before or since.  Never have so many lives, so much blood, so much treasure been expended to achieve nothing.  For nearly four years the static lines of combatants moved only yards and those yards were purchased with buckets of blood.

This is a very good movie and is not your typical big budget Hollywood epic.  It is a historic documentary-drama made for television's A&E Network.  It was shot on a very tight budget at the actual location.  Rick Schroder as MAJ Charles Whittlesey, gives one of his finest performances as the battalion commander of the 308th Battalion, 77th Division AEF. The supporting characters of CAPT Holderman [played by Adam James] and CAPT McMurty [played by Phil McKee] are an asset to the film. These three were among the seven men actually awarded the Medal of Honor in this single battle.

I was vey impressed by the attenion to small details in this movie.  Unfortunately, the producers were able to locate a full-size replica of the D.H.-4 two-seat observation aircraft of the type flown by the 50th Aero Squadron, AEF.  D.H.-4's from the 50th both located and dropped supplies to the trapped battalion.  Two members of the squadron, Lt. Harold E. Goettler and observer Lt. Erwin R. Bleckley, made the first drop and were shotdown and killed on the second.  Both men received posthumous Medals of Honor.  The aircraft in the film is a 7/8 scale replica of an S.E.-5A fighter and is totally wrong both in size and type.

Whether the character of General Alexander, 77th Division commander, is accurate or not is open to question.  As depicted, he certainly does reflect all the bad charracteristics of many World War I commanders; arrogant, disdainful of subbordinates, and detached from the suffering of the combat soldiers.  When the survivors of the battalion finally are rescued, his appearance at the site of the battle seems contrived -- I do not know if this incident is historically accurate.  That he would have actual empathy for his troops seems completely out of character.  That such a haughty individual would be capable of such kindness and consideration is a reach (for me).

One of the trivia items concerns the rifles of the Americans.  Contrary to most Hollywood epics, including Gary Cooper's ""Sergeant York"" (1941), the great majority of American troops carried not the M1903 Springfield rifle, but the M1917 ""Enfield"" rifle.  The M1917 was a modified British Pattern 1914 originally designed by Enfield in England. This Mauser-pattern .303 caliber rifle was being produced for the British by American manufacturers Winchester and Remington.  When war clouds were gathering and most thought it a matter of time the United States would be drawn-in, Americans realized that M1903 production at both Springfield Armory (Nassachusetts) and Rock Island Arsenal (Illinois) was totally inadequate to arm what became the American Expeditionary Force (AEF).  Therefore, the Army asked the American commercial producers whether the Pattern 1914 rifle could be redesigned to the American .30-06 Springfield cartridge.  It turned out both Remington and Winchester were thinking along the same lines and the modified rifle was standardized as the Model 1917.  Over 2.5 million M1917 rifles were manufactured by Remington Arms, Eddystone Arsenal (a Remington affiliate), and Winchester Repeating Arms.  In contrast, combined production at both Springfield Armory and Rock Island Arsenal only produced 1.5 million M1903 rifles.  The rifles carried in the movie are, correctly, the Model 1917.

Another blooper -- in a scene, a soldier is shown watching for the Germans and is armed with a British No. 4 Mk I rifle that was not in use until World War II.  Someone in the prop department messed-up.  The prop department did get things right showing the American troops armed with both the Colt M1911 .45 pistol and M1917 .45 revolver.  The use of the M1914 Hotchkiss and M1917 Browning machine guns is correct for the period.  The M1915 French Chauchat automatic rifle shown with Private Krotoshinsky is an outstanding piece of accuracy.  Unfortunately for American troops fighting real Germans, the French Chauchat was the WORST machine gun ever forced on the combat infantry soldier by any government.  The gun was so poorly manufactured that it refused to work most of the time.  Unfortunately, the Americans took the horrible French design and made it worse -- we coverted some of these junk machine guns to use the American .30-06 Springfield round that was more powerful than the 8mm French cartridge.  The result was the marginal M1915 in 8mm French was unacceptable and unworkable as the M1918 in U.S. caliber .30.

These are minor points and do not detract from the overall quality of this movie.  I give this a 5 star rating.",1290643200,2,4924,5.042027194066749
1665227,5,B00005U8F4,I found this DVD to be well produced with good sound and video quality.  A well balanced look at one battle between a unit of Americans (mostly from NYC) and Germans in the Argonne.  Attention to detail is meticulous.,1289088000,,217,4.538461538461538
1665228,5,B00005U8F4,"I noticed this film currently has no reviews, and so had to put in my two cents.  Anyway, to sum it up, if you are a war film enthusiast like I am, this film is a MUST HAVE.  Being produced by A&E, you can be sure it is pretty historically accurate, and still manages to tell the incredible, and TRUE story of a single battalion in WWI that moves forward in one of the last major offensives of WWI.  The rest of the Allied adance gets halted, then pushed back, except for this one battalion that doesn't get that memo.  The Germans throw everything they have at this unit, and as the American soldiers they were, they kicked ass! :) This battle was so fierce, two or three of the officers got Medals of Honor, with several enlisted members earning Silver Stars and the like.  They suffered massive casualties.
And if your afraid that this film, being made by A&E, is some low-budget, bad-acting film only to be tolerated because of the story itself, relax.  It might be low-budget- I saw nothing wrong with the special effects, there were nice explosions, the Allied charge across No Man's Land in the first few minutes of the movie was incredible to see, and the wounds received by the men looked plenty realistic- and I would know. I've been to Iraq twice, and counting. :P
Lastly, if you care about such things, Rick Schroder even LOOKS a lot like Maj. Whittelsy, the guy he portrays.
Again, this movie is a real treasure, being not only one of the rare movies made about WWI, but a fantastically-made movie at that.",1278979200,12,1519,4.4855072463768115

1665231,4,B00005U8F4,"The Lost Battalion is one of those stories you just can not help but think ""is this real""? Most assuredly it is real and compelling viewing. The story once again looks at the American citizen soldier and just what he/she can do when the going gets tough.  Told against the horrors of the First World War a battalion of soldiers is cut off from their support in an ill-fated attack in the Argonne in 1918. That they manage to hang on against all the Germans can throw at them for days on end is a tribute to the leadership of their officers and the tenacity of the men.

 Rick Schroder is outstanding as the lawyer-turned-soldier who leads and inspires his command to hang on in the face of fearful odds. Stick with this one as it shows the futility of war as well has the triumph of the human spirit.",1271203200,,800,4.32

World War I does not get much ""copy"" in today's high school textbooks, and the majority of my students begin this unit not even knowing when the war started or why.  Especially relevant are the scenes depicting the ethnic diversity of the front-line soldiers (NY immigrants meet Midwest farmboys).

1665241,5,B00005U8F4,"'The Lost Battalion' is a very gritty and moving movie about a famous incident that happened toward the end of the war in October 1918. The battle scenes are surprisingly intense for something made for A & E. But I believe this was right choice because combat in World War I was truly horrific. The scene going across No Man's Land is a definite highlight as is a defense against German flamethrower assault. Rick Schroder as Whittlesey does a fine job invoking the conflict in his character whether the stand is worth it. Overall, a great depiction of American valor.

One of the great quotes from the movie is by Major Whittlesey (played by Schroder) and sums up the American fighting man for all wars: ""You'll never know what they've been through, or what they can and can't do. They're better then you, General. They're better then me, they always are.""

The DVD has good picture and sound and does justice to this fine film.

Highly recommended!",1249948800,3,950,4.676646706586826
1665242,4,B00005U8F4,"How nice it is to find yourself surrounded by a good story of military history during a week when the rain never seemed to end. A colleague provided the DVD and I sat down to learn a little bit more about a forgotten war, the Great War, entitled, ""The Lost Battalion.""

To add to the spirit of the time frame, a scratchy sounding song of the era introduces the credits and the start of the film. (And I knew instantly that this remake would be better than the 1919 version as it had sound, and not just someone at the piano).

Major John Whittlesey played by Ricky Schroder commands a battalion of the 77th Division from New York. The division commander gives him an operation's order to attack through the Meuse Argonne Forest against the Germans. Whittlesey sets the theme by protesting the order as his unit is undersupplied in every conceivable way. He wants assurances that Americans and French will protect his flanks.  He agrees to the order but tells the general that he doubts if he will ever see his battalion again. The general mumbles to an aide after the major's departure that he will see what this New York lawyer is made of. The insinuation is transparent.

The film wanted to stress the ethnicity of the players and the origin of a division.  They created foils in the characters of Lieutenant Leak (Jay Rodan), a Texan who couldn't pronounce their names, and an ""apple-knocker"" Pvt. Yoder (Rhys Miles Thomas) from Montana assigned to the regiment. You get to know the ethnicity of the characters as soon as you hear the poor Texan begin a roll call of the Irish, Italian, Jewish, Polish and Chinese names. I began to find this part of the film overdirected or overdone like an explosive that fails to go off--a dud. The high point or low point of this, depending upon your point of view, is the smiling, captured Lt. Leak telling a German intelligent officer in a smiling southern drawl, ""What you got are a bunch of [ethnic slang] ... gangsters from New York City, and they'll never surrender--never."" The acting compensates for a script of modern slang such as ""fuggetaboutit,"" and ""knock yourself out,"" and a bunch of smiling, clean white teeth that looked like an Ipana commercial. Ricky Schroder, who was about thirty-one when this was filmed, still looks fifteen and slightly younger than Audie Murphy, in spite of (probably) an exhausted make-up department that racked up overtime trying to make him look older.

The battle scenes are one of this film's highlights with the hand-held cameras being used right in front of the actors. It looks realistic without being gory. The sound effects are good with the exception of artillery fire that can never be faithfully replicated, but the pilot who starts his engine from the cockpit is inaccurate. No one turned the prop for him as was required with the technology of the day. The Germans were also described as Krauts, a term that didn't gain currency until WW II. Heinies and Huns were more common epithets for the enemy.

What also came through in this movie was a certain chivalry that existed during this war. The American surrounded by German bayonets was captured rather than killed. The Germans treated their prisoners with every courtesy as Germans of two regimes later would rarely do.

In real life, the Americans went into the attack on October 2, 1918 with approximately 465 men and were reinforced by a lost ""K"" Company that brought the number to 550. All were low on food, water, and ammunition. After constant sniper, machine gun, and mortar fire, infantry attacks and inaccurate American artillery that fell on them, the New Yorkers held their ground and defied the two options the Germans offered them--surrender or die. They were relieved after five days with only 194 men alive and unhurt. They did not surrender. The war to end all wars ended five weeks later.

So, if you ever find yourself surrounded by the walls of your home with inclement weather beyond them, and war genre is your schtick (sorry), this is a drama that is well worth digging in to watch. The players are colorful and there are sporadic bursts of good script when it isn't ""cliched."" It was written by James Carabaltsos and over-directed by Russell Mulcahy.

It will still be one of my favorite war movies.

P. S. I recommend putting the name of Major Whittlesey in your search bar to find out more about his post war life and tragic end. He and Captains McMurtry and Holderman received the nation's highest award, the Medal of Honor for valor. Pvt. Krotoshinsky, Polish-Jewish immigrant, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.",1246233600,,4597,4.769811320754717

In that role I am quite critical of all films in that genre, and I found ""The Lost Battalion"" to be practically flawless, which is indeed a rarity.  The producers, director, and actors displayed a penchant for historical accuracy in this film, and provided rare glimpses of what it was ""really like"" during World War I.

There is a chilling reality throughout the film, to include how the war was seen and pursued from the lowliest fighting man through the top echelons of command, and even from the German perspective.  Frankly, there are relatively few films that cover World War I very well, but this is clearly the very best.  I feel that my collection - or anyone else's - of war films would be incomplete without ""The Lost Battalion,"" as it is clearly the WWI equivalent of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and one of the best war films of all time.",1151107200,105,972,4.5

Many of the supporting roles are equally convincing. Holding the film back from being really remarkable is the somewhat tired treatment of the ruthless commanding general who talks about acceptable losses as he sends his men to their doom. It's a tough situation to portray in a film, but I thought he was a pretty one-dimensional character, especially compared to the rest of the cast, who show more subtle and real human emotions. The general's sudden appearance in a staff car at the end of the movie, having simply driven up a road to a battlefield that he hadn't been able to find for four days, seemed a little hard to swallow as well. A small point but a pity that the editors didn't pay a little more attention to detail.",1135036800,5,956,4.5964912280701755

1665293,5,B00005U8F4,"Russel Mulcahy's 2001 film based on the true story involving Major Whittlesey's brave defense of a key position in the middle of German lines in 1918.  An excellent film that is quite graphic for a TV film and very accurate.

Although less people (especially civilians) were killed in WWI than WWII, it was more brutal and devastating on the battlefield than WWII for several reasons.  Unlike the mobile mechanized tactics of WWII, the Western Front was a static arrangement of complex trenches and bunkers covering over 500 miles between the English Channel and Switzerland.  Both strategic and tactical maneuvers were limited to full frontal infantry assaults against a heavily entrenched enemy creating nothing more than meat grinders for the attacking soldiers.  By the war's end, about 75% of the male population ages 17-35 in Germany and France was either dead or permanently disabled by the war. Of those who were injured, many were amputees, horribly maimed/disfigured, or suffering permanent pulmonary/neurological damage from exposure to gas. The suicide rate amongst veterans was also high after the war.  Gas was used freely by both sides and modern medicine was relatively a new discipline: the understanding of shock, trauma, and infections was limited; there was no penecilin, no blood transfusions, and no plasma.  Infections were treated mainly with alcohol and ether.

The story, as the main reviewer says, is quite simple.  Whittier's batallion is ordered to take a hill in the middle of the German line and hold it until his flanks can catch up to him; he is ordered to stand until further orders and not retreat.  Unfortunately for Whittier's batallion, his flanks never caught up to him and they find themselves completely surrounded and low on provisions.  Whittier, very much in the style of Chamberlain at Gettysburgh remains defiant and is able to repel several German assaults over several days.  Despite losing over half his regiment, Whittier survived and later received the Congressional Medal of Honor along with a few of his men for his outstanding bravery.

This is a great film and one of the few war films to cover WWI.  The acting is good and the direction is superb.  The film is very accurate as to all of the details of the period and also quite graphic for a TV film.  The film also has a documentary which recites various letters sent by/to the doughboys, nurses, and others who took part in the war.  It's a great deal!",1126137600,7,2461,4.97799511002445

1665296,4,B00005U8F4,"""The Lost Battalion"" is the true story of the 77th ""Liberty"" Division from New York during World War I.  On October 2nd, 1918, five weeks before the end of the war, they advanced into the heavily wooded terrain of the Argonne Forest in France.  Although their advanced was supposed to be supported by French and other American troops, the 77th was the only Allied unit to achieve its objective.  As a result, the ""Lost Battalion"" was surrounded by the German army and constantly attacked for six days.  However, the group failed to surrender, despite being low on ammunition, food, and other supplies.  Before the battle the 77th had around 600 men, but only 200 would walk out from the Argonne Forest.
There was a silent movie made about ""The Lost Battalion"" in 1919, in which director Burton L. King used the soldiers themselves to film the story, which was more of a documentary re-enactment than a theatrical film.  It was not until 2001 that such a film telling the story of the 77th was finally produced.  Rick Schroder plays Maj. Charles White Whittlesey, the battalion commander and a New York City lawyer who thinks his group's assignment is a suicide mission.  Of course his concerns are dismissed, because if there is one iconic image of World War I infantry it is that of climbing out of trenches to be mowed down by enemy machine guns (e.g., ""Gallipoli"").  Whittlesey's battalion is ordered to advance into the Argonne, and to take and hold their position at all cost.  With their lines of communication cut except for a handful of carrier pigeons and a few desperate efforts by American airplanes to locate and contact the surrounded unit, the men of the 77th do not really understand how desperate their plight is or that their efforts would be the key to breaking the German lines and leading to Armistice Day.
The unit is made up of mostly young men from New York City, who look at their fellow soldiers who hail from places like Montana as if they were from another planet.  There is an element in the story of how combat forges a melting plot here, and there is a telling scene where one soldier explains that while he came from Poland he is now an American because he took the test and nobody gets to say that he is not.  It is left to Lt. Leak (Jay Rodan) to explain to a German intelligence officer: ""What you're up against Major, is a bunch of Mick, Pollack, Dago, and Jew boy gangsters from New York City. They'll never surrender. Never.""  The German generals are used to the methodical approach of the French army and do not know what to make of the rash Americans, whose actions are deemed unpredictable if not evidence of outright madness.  These are officers and troops who complain about going on the mission in the first place, but who rise up in righteous indignation and anger when the Germans show up with flamethrowers.
For once the use of hand-held cameras works to the advantage of the story when the technique is used to film the attacks across No Man's Land and in the Argonne Forest (although as a general rule the use of the technique combined with constant cutting from shot to shot in action movies is quickly driving me to distraction).  One of the strengths of the production is that most of the faces of the actors are unfamiliar (Phil McKee from ""Band of Brothers"" might is the obvious exception to prove the rule), so you have no problem thinking of them as the actual soldiers they are portraying.  The biggest weakness of the film is that the foreshadowing with regards to Whittlesey is a big heavy handed, as is the growing respect the Germans have for the American detachment they cannot obliterate.  The script overplays both of those understandably necessary elements.
The DVD also includes a History Channel documentary on ""Dear Home: Letters from World War I,"" which combined archival film footage from the period and actual letters written by the Doughboys and nurses who fought in the war.  This is a nice complimentary piece to the movie, especially given how little most Americans know about what actually happened in the War to End All Wars.  If most Americans can name ""Sgt. York"" as a WWI movie they have seen that might be par, especially given how many other movies about the period are from the German perspective (e.g., ""All Quiet on the Western Front,"" ""The Blue Max"").  The obvious reference point for most Americans will the story of the besieged 101st Airborne as Bastonge during World War II's Battle of the Bulge.  There are so few films about World War I that it is not surprising that when we actually have one like ""The Lost Battalion"" they tend to stand out.
That is also why so many fault the limited information provided at the end of this film telling us what happened to Whittlesey and some of the other key members of the 77th.  You do not have to do much research on this true story to learn that Whittlesey committed suicide a few years later, which lends a definite pathos to Schroeder's performance and his character's anguish over the idea of ""acceptable losses"" Gen. Robert Alexander (Michael Brandon) keeps harping.  But you can see how ""The Lost Battalion"" combines the heroism associated with American soldiers in World War II movies with the lack of faith in American commanders that is a key theme in movies about the Vietnam War.  A nice documentary exploring the history of the 77th and how this helped end the war would have been a helpful addition, certainly much more than the biography and filmography of Rick Schroeder.",1117065600,4,5518,4.682523267838676
1665297,4,B00005U8F4,"Why does it seem that all the interesting stuff is coming from cable television nowadays?  Russell Mulcahy's THE LOST BATTALION is a 2001 A&E production that tells the based-on-fact story of an American battalion - about 600 men - that became `lost' during an offensive operation in the Meuse-Argonne sector of France in 1918.

  Rick Schroder plays Maj. Charles Whittlesey, a New York lawyer before the war broke out.  Soft spoken and hidden behind a pair of wire framed glasses Schroder nails the part, conveying the character's strength with whispered stubbornness. By the end of the film, when one of the characters tell the Major his men would follow him anywhere (okay, there's a clich or two in this one), we believe him.  With its jittery camera amidst the men and relative absence of establishing shots LOST BATTALION is emotionally gripping, if at times a tad confusing and dizzying.  In any event, the movie successfully renders the muck and grim of trench warfare, and delivers an exciting and grisly view of a war cursed with primitive communications yet possessed of highly developed means of mass slaughter.

  The dvd also contains a 45-minute History Channel special, `Dear Home: Letters from WWI.'  Employing archive footage, period photographs, voice actors and a great number of letters to and from the soldiers it's a nice, sometimes touching, introduction to US involvement in WWI.  Both movie and special are highly recommended.",1116028800,42,1451,5.101694915254237
1665298,5,B00005U8F4,"This is an excellent film, and I am impressed by the technical and historical accuracy.  The inexperience of the men, the backgrounds of the officers, and even the props were correct to a fine degree of detail.  Everything covered in this film was covered well, but the film makers neglected to mention what happened to the battalion commander, Charles Wittlesey, after the war.  Under the circumstances, I suggest that this should not have been left out.  It could have at least been addressed by some of the text at the end of the film--so cheaply that I have to conclude that the ommission was intentional.  If so, this is to be regretted.

As pointed out in the text at the end of the film, Major (later Lieutenant Colonel), Charles Wittlesey was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, along with two of his officers, after this awful battle.  But this was not the end of the story.

Other honors were bestowed upon him.  After the war, General Pershing called him one of the ""three outstanding heroes of the AEF.""  He served as a pall bearer for the opening of the ""Tomb of the Unknown Soldier"" in Washington.  He was Chairman of the Red Cross Roll Call.  But most telling of all were the circumstances of his death, almost exactly three years after the war.

Depressed by requests for help from soldiers and widows, about whom he felt responsible and helpless at the same time, he commited suicide on 29 November 1921, after putting his private and professional affairs in meticulous order.

It is regrettable that this fact was not at least mentioned in this very fine film.  It was considered important enough at the time to be mentioned at LTC Wittlesey's memorial observance by Major General Alexander, Commanding General of the 77th Division during the war, in the context that LTC Wittlesey was as much a casualty of the war as he would have been had he died in the trenches.

It would have been simple to include this, and it is a pity that this was omitted.  Otherwise, I have nothing but praise for this film--one of the best about the Great War.",1111968000,4,2064,4.641873278236915

Although cinema tends to degrade the experience to two dimensional, this film succeeds in communinicating the concept of ""war"" in a way that American viewers will have little difficulty understanding. Our lack of knowledge and understanding of the past has contributed to our present-day ignorance and ill-formed opinions about the world outside our borders. This movie does a good job of filling in some of the blanks about WWI- now all we need is an objective look at the rest of the history of the world.",1104364800,2,664,4.782608695652174
1665310,5,B00005U8F4,"The lost battalion is about the men of the US Army's 77th division 308th battalion who are in the Argonne forest and are completely surrounded by German troops during world war 1. With the fake promise of reinforcements on either side of them, they plunge headfirst deeper into the woods, where they battle to survive in desperate, and brutal battles with the germans.

Rick Schroder gives an almost masterpeice of a performance as Major Charles Whittlesey, a man who is a lawyer from New York, who leads his ""city boys"" without food, water, or ammunition. He tries to tell his commanders that he needs reinforcements for his men, but recieves none. Nevertheless he refuses to surrender to the German troops and continues to keep his men linked together.

The movie is a great action film, yet it is also a moving film as less than 500 men try to survive an almost impossible task in front of them.

The german troops serve as men who want to win, no matter what, they are determined to destroy this small thorn in their side as quickly as possible.

The americans are trying to stay alive, using every small trick in the book to try and last another day. Everytime another battle has ended Whittlesey collects the dog tags and binds them together to make one huge pile of tags at the very end of the movie.

 Warning: This movie contains some graphic violence that isn't for everyone. Nothing as bad as Braveheart, or Passion of the Christ, but there are some scenes that would make people shudder. Like when they get bombed by thier own artillery, one of the worst things that could happen, and when several german attacks leave almost no one alive.

But anyways, the rest of the characters are great too, several of the ""city boys"" tend to stick together at the beginning of the movie, but near the end they turn to the boys who grew up around trees in order to live another day. Several of Whittlesey's officers are great too, they provide strong supporting characters.

This is a great movie, and the surprising thing is it is a tv movie! This was a low budget film, yet they manage to give it almost a fantastic level of excellence. I would highly reccomend this to anyone who is a War movie fan, this is one very underrated film and deserves our attention.",1096934400,7,2263,4.57037037037037

This is hands down the best WW1 film ever made.  It has none of the Hollywood triteness or silly conventions that pollute virtually all other Hollywood war movies.  There are very few symphony orchestras on battlefields and there are none in this one.  On real battlefields men rarely scream when they are hit.  They just blow apart, drop, or keep going when they are hit, although they may cry with pain afterward.  Battle orders are not given with some histeric little actor's scream.  They are issued coolly and matter-of-factly, just as they are in real battle.  This film depicts the violence of war as it really is.
The action is depicted on the slopes of the Argonne Forest in October.  There are no trenches and very little rain, as winter is just setting in.  The previous reviewers have described well the plot and political implications of the film, so there's not much left to say.
I would, however call attention to the few reviewers who have given this film low marks.  One can quickly see that they were rating the idiocy of war, the stupidity of some Headquarters commanders, or some other aspect of war, not the quality of the film.  They are making political statements by rating the film low.  Take that into consideration.  I can think of no faults in this film.  It is perfectly written, perfectly cast, perfectly acted, perfectly filmed, and perfectly edited.  It is a spellbinder from start to finish, and it is true.
It is also interesting to note that Major Whittlesey, the actual commanding Officer of the unit depicted, committed suicide three years after the events depicted.  He was obsessed with brooding over the decisions he made that resulted in 300 of the 500 of his men getting killed because he tenatiously followed orders to hold his position.  Three Congressional Medals of Honor were awarded as a result of the action depicted.",1088899200,11,2125,4.743869209809264

While the US government was foolish in getting involved in a European brawl, that does not detract in the slightest from the dedication and bravery shown by our lads who fought in the conflict.  This movie is gritty, realistic, and relentless in its depiction of battle.  I was particularly impressed by the realism of the artillery barrages.  People don't just fall over during shelling; bodies are torn to bits.  None of the violence was gratuitous, but sugarcoating war does nobody any good.  Rick Shroder is perfect in his portrayal of the Battalion commander (who after the war committed suicide).  War is Hell, and senseless war is a sin.

I agree with another comments, that you really only see 50 men during the movie and there are supposed to be like over 500 men from the beginning.  I tend to think most war movies have a problem with this.  Gladiator, White Knight and Braveheart did it right though.  I guess the producers/directors just think we will use our imagination and believe that the other guys are off in other places.  Not so.
I really like how they emphasise the multiple battles... I kept thinking 'This time the Germans are really going to get them.'  It shows how through it all, the American men would not give up. It really made me believe that they would rather be killed down to the very last man than to give up.

1665319,5,B00005U8F4,"In late 1918 WW1 was about to come to an end. The US, now fully involved in the war, participated in an offensive alongside the french in the Argonne forest. In typical first world war fashion, the modest gains of the offensive were ultimately lost as the allied forces simply withdrew back to their trenches. One battalion, however, comprised mostly of New Yorkers of the US 77th division, did not withdraw. Instead they advanced, held, and fought to the bitter end. This is the story of the lost battalion; the 308th.

AE really got this one right. Wonderfully scripted and with lots of attention to historical detail and accuracy, this film really comes off as more than just an AE original, but something worthy of a trip to the theater had it been there. The movie opens with new recruits coming in before the offensive. The fresh troops are indoctrinated quickly into the frightening world of trench warfare. Rick Shroder does an amazing Job as the Major in command of the 308th. Having been a lawyer back in NYC, he has no real taste for battle, and struggles with his supperiors over the danger posed to his men by the over-ambitious objectives given to them.

Once they are in the Argonne forest, and fail to retreat like thier comrads, they become unknowingly surrounded by the Germans. The commanders, amazed that the 308th is sitting right smack in the German center, decides to lie and tell them that the french are still on thier flank, and to hold at all costs. Thus begins a desperate fight for survival, as ammunition and food runs out, and as wave after wave of german counter attacks are repelled.

 As the bodies pile up we are given glimpses into the personalities of these brave men. Being mostly NYers, the troops are diverse--with the interaction of Italian, Jewish, polish, and other Americans creating an interesting dynamic that makes for both comedy and food for thought. The movie shows how an interesting transference occurs as the code of the streets, or neighborhood pride, than many NYC kids grow up with, lends itself heroically to the battlefield--not allowing for honor in surrender. The presence of a southerner thrown into the battalion adds a really interesting dynamic between the characters. I enjoy viewing the story as much as a commentary on national and cultural identity as a war movie.

The acting throughout the movie is quite good, and special effects are gritty and realistic for a TV movie, without surrendering to the temptation to embellish. Lots of nice touches are added into this movie to make it a pleasure to watch and a tribute to the courage of the men, without glorifying the war itself or giving into the seductions of nationalism, although there's a distinct Americanism and bias pervading the film, to be sure.

The Germans, for example, are unable to understand why this battalion has not withdrawn or surrendered as any normal unit in WW1 would do. At this point, the southerner of the battalion (who's been captured by the Germans) warns them that they are ""up against a bunch of New York City Gangsters"", who will never surrender. Finally, even a fearsome special unit of German storm troopers are repelled, and only a handful of the 308th are left when allied forces finally link up with them once more. The loss of the Argonne, puts the German line off balance, and contributes to the further advances that end the war. That an eventual German defeat may well have been inevitable at this point is neither mentioned nor is it really relevant; the main point being the war ended sooner due to this turn of events that it may have otherwise.

I enjoyed this movie quite a bit as it shows both the futility of the war, and delves into the character of those fighting it. AE has managed to make a decent war film that is worthy of a place alongside many of the Hollywood classics of the genre.",1076198400,179,3859,4.725111441307578

The Lost Battalion is about a battalion  that is trapped and surrounded and instead of surrendering, chooses to fight (actually there were 2 battalions although the movie concentrates on 1 of them). There is not a lot of character development and the story line sticks pretty much to the task at hand. This was much like Blackhawk Down where you are only given enough information to get you into the battle.

  As far as those critics who blast this movie as hype or over the top American propaganda, think of this. In the actual battle, 5 Medals of Honor were earned. The movie only mentions 3 of them and they were the ground commanders. Two were also awarded posthumously to a pilot and his observer who helped to find the lost battalion in the thick forest. The pilot was shown briefly in the movie but is not later mentioned as a MOH winner. Name another battle where only 700 men fought for 5 days and earned 5 Medals of Honor. There is no need for hype here.

The good news is, if you're one of those suburban, coffee-table book reading ""war historians"" who think Saving Private Ryan hovers somewhere between the US constituion and the Bible in terms of its sacred status, you're going to love this little gem. It has sequences of the German commanders wondering out loud why they can't overcome the plucky, gutsy Americans - not once, nor twice, but thrice!

You've come to the right place - some of the dialogue between those gutsy little Yankee grunts is straight out of a Mel Brooks movie. Those Americans are just so darn witty when they're under artillery fire.
The bad news is, if you're not one of those types, this movie will probably want to make you eat your socks. Bummer.",1065657600,24,1172,4.75

The Lost Battalion is a DVD I had in my collection for over 8 months before I watched it. I figured Rick Schroder, made for TV movie (A&E), no 5.1 only DD 2, plus it did not get the hype like a lot of other war movies did, I'll watch it whenever. Well I watched it today and I can say that this is one of the best war movie I have seen. I'm sure it did not cost as much to make as SPR, Pearl Harbor or BOB but it was just as entertaining.

1665326,5,B00005U8F4,"This excellent film features a famous but little known incident today from the First World War.  The Lost Battalion of the 308th Infantry rightfully deserves its place in Great War heroics of the US army as does Sarjeant York and others.  This A@E movie tells the story with a degree of accuracy and has none of the over-the-top antics that many big budget Hollywood films today seem to be plagued with.  A@E productions provide a refreshing perspective to American movie making and show that this country can still produce decent cinema.  Its good to see the First World War portrayed for a change.  American viewers have gott'en their fill with World War Two, Vietnam etc., but little has been done recently on the Great War.
Here we have a conflict every bit as tragic in its own right because of the massive loss of human life through use of futile tactics on the battlefield.  We have Germans that are not Nazi's for a change which is also refreshing.  While this film over-does a bit of the ethnic tensions within the 308th Infantry, and some of the acting at times seems a bit too contemporary, what we have still is a pretty accurate recreation of events.  The standard German vs. American elements are there, with the Germans learning to respect the yanks and such, but what is important to remember here is that by late 1918 the German army was a shadow of its former self.  Exhausted from its earlier offensives that year, the US army does not contend with a first-rate Imperial army.  Had the Lost Battalion incident occured six months earlier it is doubtful that this little band of American heros could have survived for very long against overwhelming Stosstroopen tactics.  Still, the combat scenes are vivd and well done, and the acting is not bad overall.  This movie should become part of the relatively small number of good World War One films out there.  Deffinitely worth adding to one's collection.",1051747200,12,1920,4.746987951807229
1665327,5,B00005U8F4,"I had never heard of this story of valor in WWI until I accidently came across this flick.  Based on a true story, this film is one of the most inspiring war films I have ever seen.
Major Charles White Whittlesey (played wonderfully by Rick Schroder), was a pacifist who felt obligated to serve his country. Magor Whittlesey led the only unit that made it's objective on October 2, 1918, and that is why they were trapped.  After the battle, Major Whittlesey was awarded the Medal of Honor.  The citation reads as follows: ""Although cut off for 5 days from the remainder of his division, Maj. Whittlesey maintained his position, which he had reached under orders received for an advance, and held his command, consisting originally of 46 officers and men of the 308th Infantry and of Company K of the 307th Infantry, together in the face of superior numbers of the enemy during the 5 days. Maj. Whittlesey and his command were thus cut off, and no rations or other supplies reached him, in spite of determined efforts which were made by his division. On the 4th day Maj. Whittlesey received from the enemy a written proposition to surrender, which he treated with contempt, although he was at the time out of rations and had suffered a loss of about 50 percent in killed and wounded of his command and was surrounded by the enemy.""
Two others received Medal of Honors and many of the heroes received Distinguished Service Crosses along with many other awards.  If you want to be inspired, watch this film!",1046476800,3,1505,4.667924528301887

1665341,5,B00005U8F4,"I will keep this short, but I must add that what all the other reviewers have said here is true. This is an amazing film made by A&E and broadcast on the A&E network. I am sure the DVD version is much more impressive, but the televised version was a first rate portrail of the ""Lost Platoon"" and the realities of Trench Warfare in WWI. Rick Schoeder was at first a difficult to imagine officer in command of a battalion of men, but he grew up before my eyes, as many young officers were forced to do in the real war. It is an outstanding film and not a Holliwoodized version of history. The Battle of Belleau Wood that all of our great grandfathers would not speak about, is in this film for you to see. It is where France found a new respect for the American fighting man, it is where the world gained a heads up that the U.S. Army was more than just an ""expeditionary force"". This is real history, this is our blood our country, our pride. It is one of many battles that our country has built its freedom upon, defending freedom, defending democracy, and standing up with our allies for what is right. These are never easy matters to stand for, but yet it is what the fabric of our country was woven with. If you know anyone who wonders why we are in Afganistan, or possibly Iraq, show them this movie, and ask them how much more difficult world politics must have been to understand in 1917?",1042070400,3,1394,4.284090909090909
1665342,5,B00005U8F4,"ABSOLUTELY one of the Best war movies Ive ever seen! (and that includes, Ryan,Platoon,Band of Brothers)
Rick Schroder's Performance gets my vote for the BEST portrayal of ANY War role in recent history (and that includes Tom Hanks in Ryan) The emotion and despair in Rick Schroder's eyes and facial expressions is so convincing that it becomes hauntingly scarey!
His genuine compassion and human interaction with the men in his battalion are not often(if ever) shown in most hollywood movies.
The Battle scences and authentic WWI equipment and weapons were outstanding as well. Another unique aspect to this movie is the
realistic portral of the German soilders as young men with the same fears as that of the US soilders they were fighting.
This movie stuck in my head for days after viewing it, in most part due to the performance by Rick Schroder, I can't say enough about it. I think it far out pace's ANY other Ive seen and I think he should have won an OSCAR or something for the role!",1040515200,9,991,4.7011494252873565
1665343,4,B00005U8F4,"The Lost Battalion depicts more of how the chain of command flows in the army. Different soldiers have their different viewpoints, from front-line newbies to their General himself.
Unlike the other war movies (i.e. All Quiet on the Western Front, Gallipoli), this movies shows not only the futility of trench battle, but more of their mission: spearhead through the German lines. The battalion fights through what is behind the enemy lines, with skirmishes in the forest. One can actually feel the pain and anguish the soldiers have to go through. The battle sequences, where the Germans retaliate with multiple counterattacks, are quite intense and realistic, almost comparable to the beginning of Saving Private Ryan, but not quite.
Even with all positive attributes of this movie, I have to add that there are some points to consider. As like many of World War I movies, the trenches seem to be a little too ""clean and tidy."" But this movie has nothing to do with trench battles so that can be easily looked ever. With over 400 men charging into the forest, no more than fifty soldiers can be seen throughout the entire movie. Although they may be spread out throughtout the forest, I would not believe that an entire batallion until later shown in the end. As I have stated previously, the battle sequences make you feel as if you're a part of it, but after the two counter attacks by the Germans, it kind of makes the viewer feel desensitized. The fights in the Argonne Forest are all pretty similar, so by the time the third battle is fought, you tell yourself, ""This better be the last one."" Surprise... it's not. In other words, it... drags... on...""
Other than these minute differences, The Lost Battalion is very unlike classic World War One movies, probably because this movie actually has a point and without senseless running to enemy trench... run back to own trench... repeat process until we all die. This movie is worth watching more than one time. I have watched it five times and each time brings the same excitement and anticipation as the first time. If you like Saving Private Ryan, it'll definetly have a similar impact. Thank Cher Ami.",1036713600,9,2159,4.806451612903226

The movie portrays very well the horror of WW I combat, although not as good as Saving Private Ryan does for WW II. Other than the B&W version of All Quiet on the Western Front I'd never seen a WW I movie and even with that movie it's hard to visualize the horror of combat. This movie does well to let one gain a perspective.
It also portrays very well the really unfeeling attitude that higher officers had for the men in the field. An attitude that resulted in casualties that make the mind boggle at places such as the Somme and Verdun. In contrast to that however were the officers in the field, portrayed excellently by Schroeder, that did care for their men and knew when they were being ordered to slaughter and tried their best to prevent it if there was a way.",1029974400,2,910,4.3274853801169595

1665349,5,B00005U8F4,"""The Lost Battalion"" eclipses anything done for TV having to do with war.  War should not be made to look glorious.  ""The Lost Battalion"" does not.  It shows combat with an honesty that is rarely seen on any large screen, much less on television.  Rick Schroder continues to impress as he enlarges his arsenal of acting skills as Major Charles Whittlesey.  He actually makes his boyish looks heighten the heroism of his character by utterly ignoring them as he fills in all the textures of this whip-smart lawyer with a backbone of steel.  The ensemble cast is a perfect compliment to Schroder.  Still, the real star of this movie is, and should be, the incredible stand these battered but brave men made against truly impossible odds.  It's a story long overdue in the telling and A&E tells it without flinching or softening.  This is one of the finest war films ever made -- for ANY medium.",1018828800,4,892,4.666666666666667

Based on a true story, the movie although gruesome, leaves the viewer with the feeling of patriotism, in a war where some European forces actually refused to fight. The courage these American men found is beyond our comprehension.",1018828800,,492,4.9397590361445785

1665352,5,B00005U8F4,"Good movies about the ""Great War"" (as WWI was known before there was a second one) are few and far between.  After ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" and ""Paths of Glory"" the list is pretty short.  This film doesn't quite live up to those standards but it's still an excellent film.
In broad terms, the film is fairly accurate in terms of its depiction of WWI combat.  The battle scenes come as close to ""Saving Private Ryan"" level of realism as you can get on commercial television.  Be warned that some scenes, especially the ""friendly fire"" artillery attack, are not for the squeamish.
The supporting cast is a colorful and original collection of characters, devoid of most of the usual war movie cliches.  You couldn't look at a character and say whether or not he'd be dead by the end of the movie.  It was easy to imagine that these characters had been plucked off a New York street circa 1918.
Rick Schroeder gives a first rate performance as the deeply conflicted Major Whittlesey, torn between doing his duty and the welfare of his men.
There are a few moments where the film hits a false note.  Whittlesey's car at the beginning probably wasn't built for 15 years after the Great War ended.  The scene where the major receives his orders seems to ignore military protocol.  And in a major continuity glitch, Whittlesey's executive office talks about the errant artillery barrage was it had happened that day, when it had happened the day before.
This are just minor potholes in an otherwise first rate effort.",1017532800,5,1517,4.672932330827067

Watching this movie gave me a better idea of what these fellows really looked and acted like. The scene of the soldier being obliterated gave me a better persepctive of my own relative's death.
I think Rick Schroeder was great, but then again I believe they all did a superb job. The equipment was marvelous and appeared quite accurate right down to the P-17 Enfield rifles.

1665355,5,B00005U8F4,"Originally broadcast on A&E in December 2001, it is of course a Fullscreen movie.  But don't let that discourage you from checking it out.  Yes it really should have been filmed in Panavision, but its really good enough to overlook that.
OK enough of that, The Lost Battalion is a movie about an American Battalion led by the ol' Silverspoons kid actor Ricky Schroeder.  Yeah OK, he's over 30 now, but you know, its funny to see a successful kid actor these days that hasn't gone off the deep end.
In the Lost Battalion Ricky is ordered to take his Battalion of troops, mostly made up of new recruits from New York City and one Texan Lt., through the German lines to take and hold a Mill out in the middle if the Argonne Forest.  The Battalion made it all the way to the Mill due to American ""stubborness"", as described by the German commander, (""They didn't withdraw when they were supposed to"").  The thing is that he was supposed to be flanked by supporting British and French forces as well.  However those attacking forces were forced to hold at their trenches.  Thus this left Shroeder's Battalion out there all alone behind enemy lines.
However, this breakthrough created a major thorn in the side of the German forces.  In the meantime the German forces had surrounded Shroeder's Battalion and continued to assault them.  It had driven the German commanders absolutely beserk as they could not beleive the stubborn defense put up by a Battalion that was low on food, ammo and other supplies that it actually helped bring about the end of the War.
There are several intense fighting scenes where men are showing their greatest under the worst circumstances.  Think ""Hamburger Hill"" in a WWI theme.  You have a mis-directed artillery barrage, ala the helicopter friendly fire episode in Hamburger Hill.  A flamethrower assualt in the end that winds up disasterous for the Germans.  And several other ""over-the-top"" kind of WWI engagements.  Except all of this is out in the middle of some woods.  This movie also shows off how carrier pigeons were used to transfer messages from the frontlines back to HQ when out of range from telegraph wire.  Too bad they didn't have Nokia phones back then, eh?  (""Can you hear me now?"")
But anyway, this movie is watchable again and again.  Just for the pure action and the determined resistance of a stubborn American Lost Battalion.  I'd definately recommend it if you like good WWI action.",1014076800,12,2435,4.754761904761905

The action scenes (throughout the film) are second to none, and comparisons to Saving Private Ryan (with a much greater budget) are valid. Except unlike Ryan, this film doesn't let up after the first 30 minutes. It grabs you and won't let go. The acting is very good, and I highly recommend it.",1012262400,2,673,4.711864406779661

The jerky filming style in the midst of the battle adds to the queasy feeling we should ALL have in the pits of our stomachs at the idea of such devastation.  It is WELL acted, avoids almost ALL maudlin sentiment (which can't be said of Private Ryan) and the knowledge that it really happened increases the impact of it.
