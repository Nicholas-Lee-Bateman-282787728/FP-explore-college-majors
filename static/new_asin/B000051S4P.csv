1387087,1,B000051S4P,"This forgettable attempt at sci-fi action stars the boyish Casper Van Dien, who acts with pop eyes and sounds like he studied voice under Scott Wolf. When CVD notices the same man appearing in pictures from 3 different historical disasters, he stumbles across a temporal travel entertainment, whereby tourists from the future use a timeline to visit past disasters. The man in the pictures resembling Max Schreck from FW Murnau's Nosferatu gives the phenomena a gothic touch that is never taken advantage of - as soon as we hear him speak the illusion is broken. When we learn that the current popular attractions all occur within days of CVD's realtime, the always reliable if-you-change-destiny genre is presented. Regrettably the screenplay doesn't demonstrate the depth of intellect that such a genre requires for an audience to empathise with the fate of those involved. CVD is a journalist for the ""National Inquisitor"" and the momentary concern he has over the parallel beween the timeline tours and contemporary news as entertainment is quickly dismissed. However there is a redemptive twist in the narrative, and a payoff for the running gag of a geek rookie cop who has transfered from MIT. His superior played by Lawrence Dane has nothing to work with except for his authentic gruffness, as opposed to CVD's juvenile gravel tones. Matters aren't helped by the music that never lets up, and Mario Azzopardi's less than inspired direction. He has a fondness for chases and crowd scenes. It's just unfortunate that he has no gift for them, and relies upon generated FX. Logic doesn't appear to be a priority either. A relative is found at the 3rd attempt of looking amongst 11,000 victims covered with blankets, and someone who is capable of destroying a car with a missile gun is stopped by a locked door. When CVD steals someone's car, the owner delivers the camp and superfluous howler ""What do you think you're doing?!"", and CVD also gets to deliver an awful reflective speech full of mixed metaphors after he is caught ogling the breasts of his female interest, Jag's Catherine Bell. Martin Sheen has a few video appearances as the leader of the conglomerate, and Theresa Saldana wears an unflatteringly alien cow-slicked hairdo as someone chasing CVD, though I doubt either of them will be listing this film high on their resume of greatest achievements. Catherine Oxenberg appears as the timeline advertising hostess, her English accent contextually odd until I learnt she is Mrs CVD.",980726400,16,2499,5.024096385542169

1387098,5,B000051S4P,"I've liked Casper Van Dien for a long time,but I bought this movie on clearance sale very cheaply and didn't expect much from it,but I was happily surprised. I found it very well put together and got totally engrossed in the story. I really enjoyed the plot twist here-that in the future time travel has been mastered and an underground company sends people back in time to witness great disasters for ""entertainment and adventure."" Sure,its been done before but its not a common plot when it comes to Sci-Fi movies and that was refreshing. Everyone did a great job in their roles,the two leads especially,but I also thought that Peter Outerbridge as a  ""time agent"" from the future with a touch of humanity rebelling against his orders was outstanding. Sure,there were a couple of things that were perhaps improbable or not the most realistic but you are going to likely have that in any movie,especially Sci-Fi. I felt that the standards and quality were really high for a TV production. Its just a terrific film and one that will stay in my mind for some time to come.",1397433600,,1071,4.696808510638298

1387121,5,B000051S4P,"I bought this movie years ago because it was cheap and I thought oh well, it will be a good movie to watch on a rainy Saturday afternoon, but what a surprise!  I found this movie to be totally engaging!  The plot line was extremely creative and the characters were very compelling!!  I found myself hating the bad guys, especially the villainous woman, and really rooting for the good guys!  Casper Van Dien was intelligent, flawed and totally sympathetic. His chemistry with the perfectly matched Catherine Bell felt very unforced and authentic.  Today's filmmakers would do well to take a look at this ""little film that could""!  It shows that a good and even memorable film need not be big budget or filled with vulgarity and ear-screeching special effects!  I've had this film for years and every time I watch it I enjoy it just as much, maybe even more when I look at the bilge that's being put out by today's filmmakers. So next rainy Saturday, pop this in the DVD, make some popcorn, then relax and enjoy a fun, unpretentious, thoroughly enjoyable film!!!",1384473600,,1061,4.702702702702703

But the reviewers who called this a nice surprise are right on target.  The story opens with a tabloid reporter's noticing the same individual in photos of multiple historic disasters.  It spins into an engaging cat-and-mouse chase as he foils the ""thrill-seeker,"" invoking the wrath of the illegal sponsors bent on plugging the timeline shifts he's causing in the future.  The script is clever, with humor and a few well-placed twists, and for a low budget film the special effects and acting are quite good. Highly recommended.",1362441600,,695,5.290909090909091

1387128,5,B000051S4P,"This movie was great! Made-for-TV movies usually stink. But in my opinion, this ones a rare gem. I rate the movie in and of itself 5 stars. But this Digiview release of the film i only rate 2 stars due to the fact that it unbelievably edits out the use of the word ""ASS"" both times it is said in the movie! Really? REALLY??? I mean dam, if the word is good enough to be used in the original TBS broadcast of the movie, then it should MOST DEFINATELY be ok to say the word in its DVD release! I just think thats so stupid!  Now theres another edition of this movie for sale here on Amazon listed under its official title ""Thrill Seekers"" and i believe it was put out by a different company, not Digiview. Some say Phase 4 Studios and others say York Home Video. Maybe their versions are probably unedited? But anyway, this movie is definately worth watching. It focuses more on the actual plot-line than on blood and carnage. I know if this was made now for theatrical release, the subway crash and the stadium explosions would've been a huge CGI extravaganza with lots of destruction and graphic depictions of human injuries. But this movie focused on the expressions on the characters faces during the catastrophies rather than showing the actual catastrophies. Maybe that was due to budget constraints? Whether that was the case or not, i think the movie worked out better by not being graphic and being more plot-driven. Good movie.",1352073600,,1435,4.562015503875969

1387143,5,B000051S4P,"I am always a sucker for a good Sci-Fi Movie or show. This little-known gem is a great story, and it is well made(possibly a made-for-TV movie). The only criticism I have is the paper cover picture. It doesn't really capture the fact that this is a Great Movie. I see that it is being re-released in a new picture cover, that at least makes you interested in checking it out. Just looking at the old box, if you don't actually check reviews and trailers on it, you would have no idea what this movie is about. It also has an alternate title: Time Shifters, but is still referred to as Thrill Seekers in the new release. The title Time Shifters, gives a better idea of the story-line of time travel, than Thrill Seekers, which is a good explanation of why the people are time-traveling. It begs the same question that applies to many things in the world, today: Just because we can, does that mean we should? A conscience is a terrible thing to waste.......",1338681600,,956,4.4375

I'm not a huge fan of pretty-boy Casper Van Dien (Starship Troopers), yet I liked his character in this movie. I love science fiction, and I would rate this as science fiction ""lite"".  The time travel story was familiar, yet all in all, it was entertaining with strong action and a bit of a twist.  I think this movie had another title at one time because I also find it listed as ""Time Shifters"" in some websites. Like most time-travel stories, time paradox is responsible for much of the story's conflict.  The old idea ""if you go back in time and kill your grandfather, how were you ever born to be able to go back in time to kill him?""  My one gripe (with all time travel movies) is that when the paradox occurs, why are some people aware of it and not others? It doesn't make sense that one could remember more than one time line.  Oh well, time travel is always confusing.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thrill-Seekers/dp/B000051S4P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thrill Seekers</a>",1331510400,,1099,5.044198895027624

I was frankly impressed to find this to be a well made movie with the exception of the character of the obligatory thick-headed, stubborn, and curmudgeonly FBI agent. I cringed when his character was on-screen. The rest of the characters were well done and even the bad guys had their sympathetic moments.

1387170,5,B000051S4P,Casper Van Dien does a perfect shallow journalist who matures a little.  Catherine Bell does a wonderful job as the eternal research assistant who gets really involved with the investigation.  Theresa Saldana does a wonderful job as the self-involved expedience agent.,1212537600,3,268,5.512195121951219
1387171,3,B000051S4P,"The cover of my copy of THRILL SEEKERS features the title in an appropriately scary font.  Directly above it appear the words: ""Your passport to danger.""  But the picture the DVD company chose to use was one of a bored-looking Casper Van Dien taking a phone-call.  Perhaps this is not quite conveying the thrill that the filmmakers were seeking.

Actually, despite the dull cover, THRILL SEEKERS is actually a decent little made-for-TV movie.  The story is predictable, but fun.  The actors do a decent job.  And the direction is of a slightly higher caliber than one would reasonably expect.

Casper Van Dien stars as a former hot shot TV reporter who is now reduced to working for a World News Weekly style tabloid.  While researching a story about famous historical disasters (the Titanic, the Hindenburg, etc), he happens to notice the same man appearing in different file photographs who looks exactly the same regardless of how many decades separate the events (the revamped Doctor Who would -- six years later -- use the same plot point and the same bad Photoshop technology).

Taking this knowledge with him on a flight to D.C., Van Dien is rather disturbed to see the same man sitting across the aisle.  Putting two and two together and managing to avoid a horrific air-disaster, he finds himself on the run from a pair of threats.  One is the law enforcement of his own time who aren't quite buying his explanation of ""Sorry, officer, I had to hijack the plane in order to save it.""  The second is from two assassins of the future whose very existence depends on Van Dien not using his new-found knowledge to alter their timeline.

Along the way, he teams up with the tabloid's chief archivist, Catherine Bell, who I was most familiar with from her role as the woman in the uniform on that show about fighter jets and courtrooms.  Martin Sheen also has a part to play in Earth's apocalypse.  Literally videophoning-in his performance, he is an angry CEO from the future seen only on a small screen barking technobabble at his time agents.

I will complain about a certain plot point which is all too common in these types of time travel movies.  If the plot involves changing history and then you kill off one of the main characters, I am not going to be especially surprised if somehow the dead person gets brought back to life.  Stop trying to shock me like this.  The bigger surprise would be if you killed off the person, and then left them dead.

I find myself with not much to say about THRILL SEEKERS.  It's predictable, the production values reflect its made-for-TV status, and it takes itself a little too seriously.  But I sort of liked it.  The pacing is good -- swift enough that you don't really notice any of the story oddities.  Some of what I enjoyed I'm hesitant to describe for fear of providing spoilers, but it's a diverting enough way to spend an hour and a half.",1186358400,,2894,4.638506876227898
