7931675,5,B000056B00,"This was a great documentary about a fine flamenco troupe in America.  The important part (the music and dancing) is really great, and the history of the troupe is fascinating.  The footage of Carmen Amaya, though, is the hightpoint of the entire dvd, and is more than worth the purchase price.  When it arrived, I watched the entire video, than watched the Carmen Amaya scenes six or seven times, and then watched the entire video again.  If you like flamenco at all, you will enjoy it.",1408665600,,487,4.627906976744186
7931676,3,B000056B00,"it is a heartwarming documentary and i enjoyed the fact that anyone can
join in and improvise to the beautiful music and as the participants said,
it just feels like a big party.... i am looking forward to receiving flamenco women ..
i saw flamenco women about forty times on the aeroplane trip to england and they
were screening it again on the way home....",1357344000,2,358,4.523076923076923
7931677,5,B000056B00,"No, it's not an ethnographic documentary, and it's not a survey of the whole genre, but it's a very powerful hour of performances, interviews, backstage footage, and more from a breathtaking talent and her ensemble.  The archival clips of her aunt Carmen Amaya are astonishing and unforgettable.  While nothing can compare to the power of a live show by this caliber of talent, this video does document the energy and spirit of the music and work.",1230508800,5,447,4.868421052631579
7931678,3,B000056B00,"I found this a bit flat, not the usual fire that comes so often with flamenco.",1216166400,,78,3.9375
7931679,3,B000056B00,"The video can be a little slow, but it gives insight and perspectives about the history and culture of the Gypsy.  My students particularly loved the dancing by Carmen Amaya!",1184198400,3,174,4.8
7931680,5,B000056B00,"Hola,

Omayra Amaya has shared herself in this film, which is a very intimate presentation of her life and dance.  A good film if you are interested in the flamenco behind flamenco.  Insightful, and, of course, always great music & dance.  Omayra is definitely gitano puro...",1175644800,6,275,4.913043478260869
7931681,5,B000056B00,A great little documentary of the trails and tribulations of being a Flamenco Artist in Boston Ma. Great footage of Her Great aunt including a clip of Carmen Amaya and a younger Sabicas playing for wounded troops during WWII. I must say Omayra has a lot of Duende (flamenco Sprit) and is a fist rate Flamenco dancer in her own right!!,1148515200,22,334,4.491803278688525
7931682,3,B000056B00,"This fifty-minute tape contains substantial footage, all very short segments, of Omayra Amaya, who is a young woman with her own flamenco dance company in Boston. The clips are from class and performance. It contains a few precious black-and-white glimpses of Omayra's great-aunt, the immortal Carmen Amaya, considered by some the greatest flamenco dancer of all time, in performance.
Omayra and other family members discuss natural dancers versus classroom dancers, tradition versus experimentation, and other topics of interest to anyone studying any folk dance tradition.
A film of this length that tries to be both dance documentary and in-depth interview ends up being neither. The flashes of insight offered are tantalizing, but nothing more.",1039478400,10,748,5.5701754385964914
7931683,2,B000056B00,"This is short but mildly entertaining because Miss Amaya can dance and they at least film some of it.  Most of her numbers are not complete presentations, however.  She does leave you wanting to see more of her dancing.  I'm still looking for a really good tape of Flamenco and wishing the National Ballet of Spain had some of their performances on video.  The other tape, ""Flamenco"" is worse than this one.  So far, the VHS ""Nights in the Gardens of Spain"" and the Spanish film of ""Carmen"" set in a dance studio have the best examples of Flamenco dancing I've seen on video.",1026345600,15,575,4.490384615384615
