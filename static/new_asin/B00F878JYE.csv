5969728,5,B00F878JYE,"This is essentially a documentary, but it is much more than that. It is made by the Taviani brothers (Padre Padrone and Kaos to name but two). They set up in Rebbibia Prison in Italy where the prison authorities put on a major play every year. We see them announce that they will be doing a sort of updated version of Julius Caesar by William Shakespeare. The film starts with their triumphal performance in brilliant colour and then we are taken back to beginning some six months prior, and revert to a black and white format.

We see the prisoners audition and get cast and some of their auditions would put most of X Factors to shame. We follow them rehearse and learn their lines and get thoroughly immersed in the characters they are to play. Where the documentary melts away is when they perform the play in scenes set around the prison with the guards watching and soundtrack added for more immediacy. The bleak settings actually lend themselves to the story. The prisoners are mostly some big hitters some are in for life and in Italy life means life. Whilst some have no hope of ever being free they seem to universally able to find a freedom of sorts, in acting and the total absorption of the play. No one over acts they are all so compelling that I started to think this was a pretend documentary as there was no way such amateurs from such unsuspecting pasts could be so completely convincing.

It has a real wow factor and just flew by. There are so many layers to this in terms of analysis that you have to see it yourself to really grasp the depth of the piece. Shakespeare aficionados please be warned that some of the dialogue is translated into modern Italian or slang, but despite this the beauty of the Bard still shines through. This is a truly remarkable piece of film making and I hope it gets to the wider audience it so richly deserves.",1385769600,17,1862,4.473529411764706

8612971,5,B00F878JYE,This 2012 documentary was made in the high security Rebibbia Prison in Italy.  Its inmate theater program does a production of William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. The film intersperses scenes from the auditions and rehearsals (in black and white) with those of the production (in color) before a delighted audience.  Many of the prisoner-actors are long termers or lifers for serious crimes.  They relate intensely to the violence and conspiracy of the drama and their acting carries a powerful sense of reality.  I haven't seen professionals do better with Shakespeare.,1436745600,2,571,5.382022471910112

8612973,5,B00F878JYE,"Best Brutus I've ever seen. Most directors (in or out of prison) would likely have cast Salvatore Striani as Cassius because of his ""lean and hungry look,"" but he delivers an honest, tortured, impassioned Brutus I won't soon forget. Yet he's merely the best of a superb, very Italian cast, and I must admit that Shakespeare's musical language (modified only slightly in translation) rolls more naturally -- and convincingly -- off these actors' lips than from the mouths of urbane British and American actors. These actors understand the stakes, the honor code, and the contemporary relevance of Shakespeare's bloody valentine to Italian history.",1417305600,,646,5.281553398058253
8612974,5,B00F878JYE,"Now I understand Shakespeare.  It's strange I had to watch an italian prisoners movies in order to better understand Shakespeare.  The Italian actors in this movie (95% of them) are really good.  I mean Damn good.  It's an excellent movie for non-Hollywood movies lovers.  The set is minimalist its however just perfect! exactly what the set needs! i'm not saying this movie is perfect because there was no high tension or something everything was low leveled.  But overall now i will never forget what this play was about.  And more importantly I *understand* this play, the motivations behind the players, what made them do what they did, the little things.  So its very good to understand the play through this movie.",1413590400,2,720,4.892561983471074
8612975,5,B00F878JYE,"The movie demonstrates that Shakespeares plays were structured in such a way that they apply to our modern times. There is no need for any form of modernization of the plays in order to make them relevant to our present situation. As long as the movie or theater director faithfully follows the original plot and respects the plays setting, the play will carry its magic and deliver its intended impact. Caesar Must Die is an excellent example of delivering such an impact. Even changing the original dialogues into todays slang did not affect the accuracy of Shakespeares message. The prisoners staging Julius Caesar did not have to be told what Shakespeare meant. They could recognize their own experiences in the characters of Julius Caesar. They did not have to act their roles; they just needed to be provided with the means by which they could project onto the audience what they knew and what they felt. Julius Caesar provided that means. The other important factor was the use of simple props that allowed to preserve the original setting. The result is a truly exceptional presentation of the play. I would risk the statement that it is probably the best presentation of the play ever made. Unlike other adaptations of the play, the identification of the prisoners with the plays characters allowed them to unveil the crucial element of the plays plot: from the very beginning Julius Caesar knew about the preparation for his assassination and he knew who his assassins were. An unscripted episode, in which the actor playing Caesar confronts one of his inmates, further emphasized the fact that it would be impossible for Caesar not to know about the intention of his companions. And this is the key factor that is needed to fully comprehend the play. At the same time it provides a hint about who Shakespeare was and what he was writing about.
The movie clearly illustrates that attempts at so-called modernization of Shakespeares plays are the result of misunderstanding Shakespeares texts. There is a belief among the movie and theater directors that in order to adapt a play to our modern times, the original setting has to be changed accordingly. This is not so. Such changes rather sterilize the plays and corrupt their inner dimension (e.g., see my previous reviews of Joss Whedons Much Ado About Nothing and Ralph Fiennes Coriolanus). Caesar Must Die would entirely lose its impact if the inmates were not using their simple but very effective Roman props.",1396396800,2,2474,4.9352517985611515
