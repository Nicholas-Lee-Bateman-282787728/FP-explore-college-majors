2474447,2,B000CSTK60,I was hoping to find out more information about Patty Hearst but didn't; the castles were pretty to look at however,1364256000,,115,4.523809523809524
2474448,5,B000CSTK60,"Obviously, if you saw the America's Castles series when A&E was A&E and not a reality show channel, you will appreciate owning this. Anyone who has ever been to San Simeon knows how overwhelming it all is to take in. This DVD let's you take it all in and re-examine it's astoundding beauty piece by piece - over and over. Nice to have for viewing in your own home. Five stars! An asset to any collection.",1327363200,2,404,4.328947368421052
2474449,4,B000CSTK60,"This is the best video about Hearst Castle I have seen.  High quality video and a very comprehensive look at one of the most impressive estates in the world.  I am planning a trip to see Hearst Castle and wanted to whet my appetite with a little video tour.  This really exceeded my expectations.  Of course it includes a biography of William Randolph Hearst and the history of his ""ranch"" home in the San Simeon hills.  There is simply so much of Hearst Castle to see and this video gave me a taste of nearly all of it.  I can hardly wait to tour Hearst Castle in person.  I suppose for me it would have been 5 stars if it were longer and gave me a summary of the tours available - which tours covered which parts of the estate - that sort of thing.",1252713600,,750,4.13103448275862
2474450,5,B000CSTK60,"We've been to Hearst castle on several occasions but now we live in Idaho, not California. My videos were good but you really can't beat the professional videos such as this one to really get a good combined story of the overall history of the 'castle' as well as the images of rooms and items you just can't get unless you go on multiple expensive tours at the facility. If you've been or are thinking about going get this video from Amazon sellers, don't wait to buy it from the gift shops, way more expensive there!",1239926400,7,518,4.40625
2474451,4,B000CSTK60,"We just visited Hearst Castle, took several tours, saw their featured ""Building the Dream"" DVD, purchased a DVD tour from their store. I learned more from this A&E presentation than any of these others! Excellent footage (including live movie clips of Hearst during the 20s), shots of different rooms, history of the art. This makes an excellent souvenir if you have visited, or a feasible trip if you live too far away to go in person. The Castle looks better in this film than in person since the film is about 15 years old. Wish I had seen it before our visit to have better appreciation of what the tour presented. Highly recommend!",1167523200,16,636,4.6371681415929205
2474452,3,B000CSTK60,"First, know that this is a 45 minute documentary; at $20 or more, it's a rip-off.  This is a travelogue oriented presentation, and although it's well photographed, the information is presented in a sort of stream-of-consciousness manner -- it jumps around all over the place, and then goes back to things that you thought had already been covered...including repetition of several shots.  There are two reasons to recommend it. Reason 1: if you want a souvenir of your visit to Hearst Castle, this is certainly better than any home video you can take yourself.  Reason 2: if you've never been there, and don't know much about it, it does serve as a decent, although scattered, introduction.  Of course, nothing can compare with actually going there, and that's what I recommend most of all!",1145059200,8,790,4.917293233082707

8102229,5,B000CSTK60,"Having visited there and taken one of the tours was a great experience.
This video brought back reminders of the visit my husband and I had
taken years ago. It showed much more than we were able to see with
only having been on one of the tours.

8102232,5,B000CSTK60,"Replacing all VHS tapes with DVD's. Hearst Castle is an amazing view into the world of the ""rich and famous"". William Randolph Hearst had so much money he never had to worry about anything. So why not built a huge place for entertaining which was never completed before his death.",1429401600,,280,4.62
8102233,4,B000CSTK60,"The Hearst Castle at San Simeon is an incredible structure and this video helped me realize just how impressive it is. Also interesting how long it took to construct and the many revisions it went through. My one suggestion - some summary information such as just how many square feet it comprises, the size of some of its larger rooms, how it came to become a property of the State of California, and just how many other major properties Mr. Hearst held.",1422921600,2,455,4.560975609756097

8102237,4,B000CSTK60,"This is an excellent overview of the Castle, not just the life of Hearst.  We purchased it prior to taking the tour, which I would highly recommend.  It helps to see what is generally viewed so one can concentrate on any specifics to see and ask about during the tours.",1364428800,,269,4.36
