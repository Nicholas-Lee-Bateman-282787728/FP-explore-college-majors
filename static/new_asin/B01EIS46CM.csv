I starts with the newly promoted Inspector being jailed for Murder, losing his position and after being found not guilty of the crime, so to speak, he was allowed to rejoin the ranks of his fellow officers but back at square one.  However, to Murdoch, he considers his lowly title really ""in name"" only.

Unless I was dreaming, this was the only season that did not leave us hanging on a Hitchcockian 'top of Mount Rushmore', or on the 'top of the Statue of Liberty' before the last salvo of being saved.  Sadly, there was no season ending cliffhanger leaving us with baited breath.  Other than that, we have lost the beautiful medical examiner (Coroner) to her 'new' LGBT lifestyle.

7735305,5,B01EIS46CM,Murdock Mysteries is a change from the mundane programs one sees on local TV. It is well written and the characters are interesting and unpredictable. I re-watch episodes because there is always a clue or scene I have missed.,1490140800,,225,4.794871794871795

7735308,3,B01EIS46CM,"If you LOVE Murdoch, you will probably still enjoy this 9th season, but its also probably the weakest season.  I'll try not to put any spoilers in here, but let's just say that there are episodes where I was rolling my eyes and saying, ""They are kidding!""  Yes, that absurd.  Murdoch as always a little on the edge of ""would that really work?"", but they have outdone themselves.  The return of James Pendrick is great, as he was always a favorite, but the science / math is SO bad, I almost thought they were laughing at themselves like it was an inside joke. The episode with William Shatner as Mark Twain will go down as my all time most disliked episode.  It's not exactly bad, its just incredibly boring.  It is as if they decided Shatner could just do Twain for forty minutes and we would be really entertained.  The episode with Dr. Grace's friend is just plain odd and doesn't make a lot of sense, but they apparently just needed to come up with a script to close that out.  Never understood any of that relationship because it was apparently just done for affect anyway.  She and George were such a good couple, breaking them up was so sad.  Speaking of George, if you love the character, he is different in season 9.  He is somewhat the same, but very different in radical ways.  Would the George we know and love really take up with a burlesque dancer / prostitute?  He was also so shy of women and that was part of his charm.  That's gone now.  He is ""with"" two different women this season.  So very sad to see.  Summer of '75 might have been interesting if it made any sense at all.  And the final episode has a conclusion that is so far fetched, we can imagine it was really just a dream sequence.  IN SUMMARY, there are a few good episodes in this season, but only a few.  Most I won't watch a second time.  They do seem to be losing it.",1488931200,6,1851,4.291907514450867

I am in love with Constable George Crabtree (Jonny Harris) who is ever the optimist no matter how much murder and mayhem he experiences. And all of the ""famous people"" that are represented on this show (Harry HoudiniArthur Conan Doyle, Mark Twain, Nicola Tesla, Carrie Nation, Winston Churchill, etc) makes us see these historical characters in a modern persona.",1486684800,,538,5.267441860465116

In addition, Murdoch teaches us about science and logical thinking as he solves his cases.  Every once in a while there is an unusual word slipped into the conversation between the characters that inspires me to research the meaning and thereby improve my vocabulary.  The science, logical reasoning, and the vocabulary hopefully spark interest in any young minds that may watch the show.  The love interest between Murdoch and Dr. Ogden is always tastefully nurtured. The relationships between the other main characters are very nicely developed as well.  Each person plays their part and personality very professionally.  The dialog and the acting are mature and believable.  For me, it's just a great show, and I really enjoy everything and everyone in the series.",1484092800,2,925,5.12

7735636,5,B01EIS46CM,"In another great season of this Canadian series, Detective Murdoch, Dr. Ogden, Constable Crabtree and the other members of the constabulary of Station House No. 4 continue to bring justice to Victorian-era Toronto.  Detective Murdoch is as inventive as ever and his marriage to Dr. Ogden gives their relationship more continuity.  Constable Crabtree continues to be kind of an early Google.  When asked to find information required by the case, he quickly and unpretentiously returns with all available background information on suspects, newspaper articles, financial data and other relevant material.  The episodes are set against the political landscape of the time including women's suffrage,  the temperance movement, and the tension between the US and Canada.  The series with it's clever and attractive characters and historical backdrop is much more interesting than many of the US crime series with their cynical characters and dark themes.

We watch Murdoch using an Acorn subscription form Amazon.  Season 9 is the last season currently available but Season 10 is just finishing on CBC so hopefully will be available on Acorn early next year.",1481932800,,1153,5.402234636871508

7736001,4,B01EIS46CM,"Clever mystery series featuring William Murdoch, unsung inventor extraordinaire. Set at the turn of the 20th century, when the forensic sciences were just starting to play a role in criminal investigations, the series explores the role of science. The series also takes on a number of very contemporary social issues (abortion, voting rights, women in the workplace, and more). Likeable characters include Murdoch, Constable George Crabtree, and not one but two female coroners (at a time when it was nearly impossible for a woman to receive medical training).

A few digs at modern life make it highly entertaining.",1478390400,2,616,5.285714285714286

7736012,5,B01EIS46CM,"Clever, sly, witty melodramatic murders that often slip on a banana peel.
Clever turns of phrase, clever looking forward while in the past (the invention of a putty that is silly, or wooden blocks that won't ""letgo"").
Great writers!
Characters, scenery, costumes all eye candy, especially Murdoch himself. Extremely handsome, yet a bit of boyishness that is appealing. Women hit on him constantly, yet he shyly ignores and sticks to business. His unshaken morality is refreshing. That black suit is certainly on his color wheel; he comes out of every scrape, fights, dunking, journey on horseback, always pressed and polished. Doesn't even lose his hat.
Toronto is so clean and orderly---no slums, families all live in large Victorian houses, no sign of poverty. How do Julia and William manage to live in that posh hotel on civil servant salary?",1478304000,,846,5.093525179856115

7736021,5,B01EIS46CM,"Throughout its long run, ""Murdoch Mysteries"" has never failed to tackle controversial subjects.
Infidelity, sexual orientation, corruption... they have all been grist for the Murdoch mill in the past and Season 9 is no exception. This season, in addition to its mysteries, the series also focused a fair amount of attention on the overt and covert racism that was an all-too-prevalent feature of Canadian life in the early 20th Century. Series newcomer Rebecca James (played nicely by Mouna Traore) encounters it early on in the season when she is denied an opportunity to work as a morgue assistant because of the color of her skin. In an episode later in the series the theme is explored even more dramatically when a former abolitionist is murdered not long after giving a speech at an all-black church. It is a powerful episode, one that reminds us of the need for men and women of goodwill to continue doing all they can to ease tensions between different groups of people rather than exacerbating them.
As usual, this season's episodes also featured the introduction of historical figures into the storyline including Mark Twain (played with understated charm by William Shatner) and temperance leader Carrie Nation. Perhaps my favorite historical figure to emerge this season, however, was Canadian writer Lucy Maud Montgomery, the author of ""Anne of Green Gables,"" who has a brief - but memorable - visit to Toronto where she meets Constable George Crabtree.
In addition, this season features a lot of Steampunk inventions: Gliding suits, rocket ships, and even a device to measure brainwave activity are woven into the stories.
And, mixed in with its trademark humor, there is drama; lots of drama including the near death of Murdoch's wife Dr. Julia Ogden and a short, but very well-played scene of a black couple deciding that they are not going to be denied a seat at a restaurant.
All in all, this consistently brilliant series lives up to its high standards in its ninth season. A well-deserved 5 stars",1478217600,,2016,4.985163204747774

We're experiencing deprivation because we can't see new episodes any more. Fortunately, our memories are not as sharp as they once were, so we're restarting the whole series (Seasons 1-7 on Netflix) and it's fun all over again. We remember now that the first seasons almost always involved one of the plethora of inventors who were prominent at the turn of the last century. Tesla and Edison feature prominently. If you're at all geeky, this is great fun. And the characters are a hoot too. Murdoch is borderline Asperger's, Julia is a feminist (almost) firebrand, George, the constable, is...well George and adorable. The captain, Brackenread, is all bluster, but also someone you come to love.

7736069,5,B01EIS46CM,"A very clever detective show dipped in the spirit of the of the Age of Invention, an age that promised a much better world, in their time, to those lucky to be alive then. (Two World wars and the Great Depression were still decades ahead.)
Murdoch is a genius detective that is also a genius inventor of all sorts of practical and fanciful gadgets, many way ahead of their time -- but familiar to us in ours.
Excellent acting, tight scripts full of surprises, good deadpan sense of humor, very likeable main characters, with only one of them leaving the show, so far.
Characters and stories have changed throughout this by now more than nine-years long series, and to me, the changes have kept the end product fresh and enjoyable as they were a the very start.
My only complaint, and it is a big one, is this:
When are they going to bring Terrence Meyers back from Outer Space?
Frankly, I cannot imagine Turn of the Century Toronto -- indeed cannot even imagine Canada as a country worth thinking about -- without Terrence Meyers in it.",1475884800,,1036,4.545454545454546

7736083,5,B01EIS46CM,"This series continues its strong and suspenseful storyline. Anyone who has watched the previous seasons knows the changes the characters have been through and the realism of the background they happen in, add to the justified continuation. If you wonder about the story arc of a tenth season, this ninth season will most likely only whet your appetite even more. The characters are as real and able to pull us in as before and the finale showdown episode that culminates in a fight between Dr Ogden and a femme fatale offers female fans the chance to see another level of devotion between the main characters who literally love one another to death. The series has gone from Murdoch as primary to the subtle and not so subtle art of how a man and woman mutually share the same passion for justice despite being very different personalities. Here is perhaps the greatest  mystery in the series intended to be unfolded by the author--it is not merely about clues and techniques to show the evolution of criminal justice but of the relationship between men and women. This makes the series unique indeed among those with partnerships (think Holmes and Watson not coincidentally a detective and doctor duo like Murdoch and Ogden). Enjoy faithful viewers!",1475107200,,1250,4.89622641509434

This series has engaging characters, interesting stories, wonderful costuming, inventions and ""guest stars""' that make viewing even more entertaining.  For Season 9 we have none other than William Shatner as Mark Twain in an episode that has the famous writer a less than welcome guest speaker.  In addition to Mark Twain, this season also has episodes revolving around Temperance legend Carrie Nation and the beloved author of ANNE of GREEN GABLES, Lucy Maud Montgomery.  The stories and mysteries not involving famous characters, are equally interesting, and have the always appreciated (especially by the resident scientist here) solutions that are based on scientific principles, sometimes newly discovered or posited ideas from the time period.  A classy production, this DVD belongs in good mystery collections, and for those that enjoy Victorian or Early Twentieth Century dramas.

They started in the late 1890's and are now in the early 1900's. Murdoch is still coming up with new inventions, and ""inventing""
his forensic techniques. Some old friends and adversaries return in season 9. A few surprises. There are some extras, on the making of several episodes, and there are English Subtitles for the hearing impaired. Everything about this show is first class and has consistently stayed first class and gets better.  (although the autopsies get a little too graphic).

7736122,5,B01EIS46CM,"Murdoch Mysteries is one of my all-time favorite shows.  My wife started watching season 1 on Amazon Prime and she would tell me about some of the episodes. So, one day, I sat down and watched one with her. Weve been watching ever since. Weve watched the first nine seasons on Prime and are going back and re-watching season 1, while we wait for season 10 to be released.

The shows take place in Toronto, Canada around the turn of the 20th century. The main character is Detective William Murdoch of the Toronto Constabulary. Although the automobile is just starting to gain popularity, Murdochs primary mode of transportation is his bicycle. Each episode features an intriguing murder that Murdoch and the other players on the show have to solve. Some of the cases have unique and interesting twists to them.

The main characters in the show are warm and engaging. Their personal growth throughout the seasons is well done.  My favorite part of the series is the way that late 19th and early 20th century figures are featured in various episodes. Weve seen Thomas Edison, Arthur Conan Doyle, Nikola Tesla, Alexander Graham Bell, Buffalo Bill Cody, Harry Houdini, Mark Twain, and Bram Stoker to name a few. The show also introduces us to the new science of the times: fingerprints, ballistics, the war of the currents (AC vs DC power)",1472947200,,1335,4.791304347826087

7736146,5,B01EIS46CM,"This series gets better and better as each season brings fun in the form of clever capers and tongue-in-cheek storylines. Anyone who's watched the earlier seasons knows that Yannick Bisson so winningly plays Murdoch, you believe he IS the savvy Canadian detective, and the superb supporting cast (Helene Joy as Dr. Julia, the love of Murdoch's life as well as his crime-solving sounding board; Thomas Craig as Inspector Brackenreid and Georgina Reilly as Dr. Emily Grace) adds to the enjoyment. While every season includes smartly cast guest stars, Season 9 brings us the the always quirky William Shatner starring as Mark Twain. Much of the fun of Murdoch is seeing his interactions with historic figures from the past, and this year's includes a delightful surprise when Lucy Maud Montgomery, beloved author of the Anne of Green Gables saga, turns up. This is a show to be savored multiple times, and whether you watch the 18 episodes in order or not, you'll find yourself transported to a simpler time when crime solving was less about DNA and cell phone photos and more about smart detecting and a few of those Eureka-type moments. Always a gift on Acorn's Murdoch series, this one is no exception with a bounty of bonus material to enhance the entire Murdoch immersion.",1471478400,2,1274,4.930232558139535

I am so glad that they are making a season 10 of this show.  I hope that this show goes on forever.  I am going to gift my relatives this Christmas with seasons of Murdoch, since we all love these kind of authentic realistic period mystery shows.  This truly is the best show ever.

Was glad to see Dr. Grace leave since she wasn't one of my favorite characters and was hoping they'd bring Dr. Francis back who was very funny and added a lot to the episodes he was in.  Instead Dr. Ogden is back in the morgue which is fine but now we have to descend to PC and have a female  assistant (which she never needed before).  Love Terrence Meyers but he was only in one episode and was disappointed no Sherlock Holmes who was a popular character.  Always liked James Pendrick - he was in one episode.  Last episode of the season was ludicrous when a comatose and shot up Dr. Ogden miraculously arises from the coma to rescue Murdoch who seems more downplayed in favor of female characters such as the morgue attendant and the lady private detective.  Seem to be scraping the bottom of the barrel for ideas.  I see they are having a season 10 and certainly hope they do better.  George Crabtree and Thomas Brackenreid were great as always.",1470787200,3,1096,4.4623115577889445

7736170,5,B01EIS46CM,"Murdoch Mysteries, Season 9, starring Yannick Bisson.  This popular, award-winning Canadian  television series, which is broadcast in the United States on the Ovation network as THE ARTFUL DETECTIVE, here returns for a ninth season. Its based on the crime novels of Maureen Jennings; made by the British firm ITV, as far as Im concerned, this gives it a touch of British mystery as well.  As ever, the historical mysteries are set in Toronto, Canada; weve now moved to the early 20th century. In this season of period pieces, Detective William Murdoch (Yannick Bisson, SUE THOMAS: F.B.EYE) and his wife, Dr. Julia Ogden (Gemini winner Hlne Joy, DURHAM COUNTY), plan their future life together; Constable Crabtree (popular comedian Jonny Harris, HATCHING, MATCHING & DISPATCHING) faces serious consequences for his emotional decisions. Dr. Emily Grace (Georgina Reilly, THE L.A. COMPLEX) experiences  personal crisis. Inspector Brackenreid (Thomas Craig, WHERE THE HEART IS) suffers an eccentric houseguest. New morgue cleaner turned lab attendant (Mouna Traor, CARRIE) brings a new face to Station House 5.

The costume drama continues its winning and clever ways, with affection on hand in the cop shop, while battling criminals from serial killers to bank robbers, from the darkest opium dens to outer space. As Murdoch, Bisson continues to carry the production manfully.  It continues to introduce the celebrities of the day, as Murdoch and his friends encounter historical figures like Anne of Green Gables author Lucy Maud Montgomery, temperance advocate Carrie Nation, American humorist Mark Twain, played  in a special guest star appearance by William Shatner (STAR TREK). The police procedural continues in its mix of unique, unusual mystery plots and some rather more shopworn; continues to achieve power in several of its episodes. It continues to introduce current day issues and concerns without beating viewers over the head with them;  to be as charming as ever. In fact, I think that since Bisson began executive  producing the show, it is paying more attention to the lives, interactions of the stations people than to forensics, which I consider a pity, as I enjoyed the primitive forensics.

MURDOCH MYSTERIES has earned more than two dozen Gemini noms, won the 2016 Fans Choice Award at the Canadian Screen Awards for lead Bisson.  The box set includes five discs, comprising 18 episodes running approximately 624 minutes. I received it as a review copy.  It has a bonus featurette Making Murdoch running 43 minutes , a photo gallery.  And, thank goodness, English subtitles, for those of us not native to the Canadian West.  Further, beware, sensitive souls, those looking for family viewing, some disturbing scenes, drug use.  Though really, these scenes are quite mild, should not prevent anyone from enjoying this smart, fast-paced police procedural.  I did notice a couple of oddities though.  Many, if not most TV series, choose to end each individual series with a cliffhanger episode, theoretically to leave audiences hungering for the outcome.  The last episode of this series gives us several cliffhangers, but proceeds to solve them all  before close of play.  Odd that.  Can Canadian audiences not be trusted to wait for the next series?  Also, on a more personal note, if I may: Note to Messrs. Bisson, Higgins.  Your overly  ambitious rugs, Botox treatments have given your foreheads a distinctly odd look. Cut it out, guys. But don't let anything stop you viewers from enjoying this sterling entertainment.",1469836800,,3540,5.258007117437723

7736173,5,B01EIS46CM,"Authentic period props & costumes, amazing multi-plots, complex characters, and a crime/humor mix in season 9 with 10 being planned. Realistically gritty but with fictional unveiling of then-new inventions, science and forensics beginnings, and new merchandise. Murdoch encounters historic personalities. It began as being adapted from novels but has become an entity in its own right. Season 9 is 1903 era entertainment, suspense, bits of romance, and ample tongue-in-cheek comedy throughout.
Cast is a big part of Murdoch Mysteries success. Yannick Bisson's leading role is joined with his boss, Insp. Brackenreid (Thomas Craig); Constable Crabtree (Jonny Harris, a comic genius) and Constable Higgins (Lachlan Murdoch). Dr. Julie Ogden (Helen Joy) is Murdochs wife, Dr. Emily Grace (Georgina Reilly) works the morgue which gets newcomer help via Rebecca (Mouna Traore). Baby Roland steals many scenes when he appears.

7736174,5,B01EIS46CM,"Do you remember that Season 8 ended with a cliffhanger?&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Murdoch-Mysteries-Season-8/dp/B00VKEWZQ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Murdoch Mysteries, Season 8</a>
It will be resolved in Season 9, but at first it will appear to be resolved in a most unsatisfactory way. But keep watching, your fears will be unfounded!

The cliffhanger resolution is not the only excellently crafted mystery in this season of Murdoch.  Its the year 1904, and I not only enjoy the murder mysteries, I enjoy the historical tidbits, new inventions and real people brought into the plots. And the humor, I love the humor. As usual, much of it stems from the perfect straight-man's foil, Constable Crabtree.

Season 9 of Murdoch Mysteries originally aired October 2015 through March 2016. You get 18 episodes totaling 792 minutes; that's 44 minutes each without commercials. This Region 1 DVD set does NOT include the December 2015 Christmas Special, ""A Merry Murdoch Christmas"", which can be purchased separately,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Murdoch-Mysteries-Christmas/dp/B01IDRSGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Murdoch Mysteries Christmas</a>. If you watch the B;u/Ray//DVDs, the show is presented in 16:9 widescreen and 5.1 Dolby Digital. English SDH subtitles are available on the episodes and the ""Making Murdoch"" Bonus features. I find that these featurettes are usually interesting, with background information or insights into the writers' thinking. The last disc also has a 2 minute Photo Gallery.

....Episode 1 ""Nolo Cotendere"" If you don't know what this legal plea means before you watch this episode, you will after.
Bonus (5 minutes) Commentators include Peter Mitchell (showrunner), Yannick Bisson (plays Murdoch), Jonny Harris (plays Crabtree), Christine Jennings (executive producer) and Helene Joy (plays Dr. Ogden). Harris explains the show: ""We are just a little bit on the side of the fantastical. But that just opens up so many more possibilities.""
....Episode 2  ""Marked Twain"" The renowned humorist visits Toronto. And gets shot at. His parting gift to Crabtree's budding writing career: ""Reality can be beaten with enough imagination.""
Bonus (5 minutes) And speaking of fantastical, who would think that guest star William Shatner would be so good! He is a commentator in this Bonus, as well as Peter Mitchell, Yannick Bisson, Jonny Harris and Helene Joy.
....Episode 3  ""Double Life""  Grief and murder find Toronto Stationhouse No. 4.
Bonus (5 minutes)  Commentators include Georgina Reilly (plays Dr. Grace), Joran Christianson (writer), Yannick Bisson, Helene Joy, Thomas Craig (plays Brackenreid) and Jonny Harris.
....Episode 4  ""Barenaked Ladies""  New electroplated life-sized statues turn up in the park. Naked statues. Hear Brackenreid give a typical response to one of his constable's theories, ""Crabtree! Stop being such a happy dafty!""
Bonus (4 minutes)  Commentators include Helene Joy, Mouna Traore (plays Rebecca James), and Peter Mitchell. I think James is a great addition to the cast. If nothing else, she has a smile made of pure sunshine. As Mitchell says, ""It's really really important to have characters like Rebecca and characters of other ethnicities in a show, because that is very accurate to Canadian history.""
....Episode 5 ""24 Hours Til Doomsday"" The spy Terrance Myers teams up with Murdoch again, as well as the two-faced spy can team. Even better, this episode brings back fellow inventor James Pendrick. How about rockets and the first wingsuits! Love this episode for the hilarious ending.
Bonus (1 minute) Commentators include Paul Aitken (producer, writer), Yannick Bisson and Peter Stebbings (plays Pendrick). Believe it or not, there were plans for rockets in 1904.
....Episode 6  ""The Local Option"" The fight for prohibition comes to Toronto, and the famously tippling Brackenreid has to put up with the famously judgmental Carrie Nation as a houseguest. And she brought her ax! This episode has a lovely intricate plot, but no Bonus feature.
....Episode 7  ""Summer of '75"" In 1904, the ""summer of '75"" refers to 1875, when Murdoch was a boy. A sleeping murder to be solved, or he dies.
Bonus (4 minutes) Commentators include Michelle Ricci (writer), Yannick Bisson, John Paul Ruttan (plays young Murdoch, for the 2nd time) and Carol Hay (writer). Ruttan says, ""You're out here in 40 degrees [Celcuis = 104 Fahrenheit] wearing three sets of wool clothing.... I don't how they survived [in 1875}.""
....Episode 8  ""Pipe DreamZZZ""  This takes us back to a time when smoking opium was legal. Even if you die smoking it.
Bonus (4 minutes)  Commentators are Michelle Ricci (writer), Helene Joy and Yannick Bisson.
....Episode 9  ""Raised on Robbery"" Yannick is visiting the Traders Bank of Canada, trying to get a mortgage for building their own home. His spiel to the bank manager is interrupted by an alarm. This is good, a cop on hand during a robbery. No Bonus.
....Episode 10  ""The Big Chill"" Famed Arctic explorer Joseph-Elzar Bernier has just returned from his first expedition, and is in Toronto raising money for his next. He also brings the body of his dead navigator to the morgue. Could Crabtree be right in proposing that he was killed by Qalupalik, a creature who crawls out of the sea to grab the unsuspecting?
Bonus (4 minutes) Hear from Yannick Bisson, Peter Mitchell and Helene Joy.
....Episode 11  ""A Case of the Yips"" At the Toronto Athletic & Golf Club, a man goes into the trees to find his golf ball, and does not come out. To solve the case, Murdoch needs to take up golf. Brackenreid warns him, ""Golf is a cruel mistress.... I could believe that he hit the ball into the woods on purpose, then killed himself just to get away from the game.""
This episode pokes fun at golfers' foibles and has no Bonus. But I'll add this trivia. The golfers carry around buckets of sand and make mounds for their tee-offs. But Murdoch has learned of a new invention, a wooden tee. In real life, George Franklin Grant, the first African-American professor at Harvard, invented the golf tee in 1899. It took a while to get to Toronto.
....Episode 12  ""Unlucky in Love"" Mrs. Brackenreid has become a wedding planner. But her first wedding ends when the groom is electrocuted by the lights on the wedding arch. Meanwhile, Crabtree holds a writing class, where his most promising student is Lucy Maud Montgomery. He has some constructive criticism for her first try at a novel. The heroine of ""Anne of Green Gables"", he tells her, should be changed to a boy; how about ""Dan of Green Gables""? This episode is delightful.
Bonus (3 minutes) Hear from Jonny Harris, Alison Louder (plays Montgomery) and Lori Spring (writer). Harris smiles, ""What attracts women to Crabtree? I think it's his looks. [laughs]""
....Episode 13  ""Colour Blinded"" Rebecca James' church, the Colored Wesleyan Church, invites Frank Parker to speak. He is respected for his efforts on the Underground Railway. But he's no angel, which might be why he's found dead in the church vestry. A white man killed in a black church. This is going to go badly.
Bonus (4 minutes) Peter Mitchell and Mouna Traore talk about this episode.
....Episode 14  ""Wild Child""  A man is found dead in the woods, and the chief suspect is a wild child, raised by wolves and displayed in a cage to view at 10 cents a pop. In this episode we see heartbreak born of goodness. And Murdoch invents night vision goggles! No Bonus.
....Episode 15  ""House of Industry"" A man is found with his throat slit in the bathtub at the local workhouse. But if he's been breaking stones for money (to make gravel for the county), why are his fingernails clean and his hands lack calluses? See the 1904 equivalent of the slipped-on-the-floor con. And follow Crabtree's attempts to try the new rage in beach treats, the banana split sundae: ""My God, Henry, this could be the best concoction ever conceived."" No Bonus.
....Episode 16  ""BL**DY H*LL""  Murdoch and Brackenreid escalate their attempts to uncover the venery of a high-level policeman. With dire consequences. No Bonus.
....Episode 17  ""From Buffalo With Love"" The Star Room Theatre is not for ladies. Except the ones undressing on the stage. It may be an exciting show, but how can it be that nobody heard when a customer was shot at his table? No Bonus.
....Episode 18  ""Cometh the Archer"" A character from the past returns, in a big bad way. This episode suffers from a high degree of unbelievability, but it was interesting to see Murdoch's newest invention, an electrical brain signaler.
Bonus (2 minutes)  Commentators include Yannick Bisson, Helene Joy and Peter Mitchell. Mitchell says, ""I didn't want to have a cliffhanger this year because I wanted to have a nice clean slate for next year.""

A top-notch season of Murdoch!

I hear there is a season 10 and can't wait until those of us who live south of the Canadian border get to see it.  The whole idea of the series is both educational and enjoyable.  I how the series continues for many seasons to come.,1462924800,25,398,4.12987012987013
7736187,5,B01EIS46CM,"I Love this show,.It is one of my favorites. I first discovered it on ovation as the Artful detective. I became addicted and found it here to catch up all the earlier seasons. This new season 9 was as great as all the others.  I could not hold out and watched the entire season in a few days. I hope they continue the series for a very long time to come. Some great actors and plots. I love how they have they weave in historical facts. Buffalo Wings. LOL.  I hope they continue for many more seaons. I will wait impatiently for the next season.",1462579200,11,545,4.180952380952381
7736188,5,B01EIS46CM,"I first discovered this series on Netflix and I was hooked from episode 1. I have long been a fan of realistic period pieces and Murdoch Mysteries  brings Victorian era Canada to life beautifully.  All of the regular series actors and the guest stars have been impressive - though I have a special affinity for Thomas Craig (Inspector Brankenreid) and Johnny Harris (Constable Crabtree).  Both of these characters are well formed and go from funny to deep effortlessly.  Aside from the wonderful acting, the detail historical re-telling of pivotal people and inventions is simply a marvel.  I know nothing about Canada and have found myself perusing the internet after a show for more info on Canadian cities and citizens of note like Lucy Maude Montgomer the author of ""Anne Of Green Gables"".  I even read a few of her books because of this show! Loved them by the way. Keep it coming because you indeed have an audience.",1462147200,53,922,4.80379746835443

7736190,5,B01EIS46CM,"I absolutely love, love this series. Great cast, spectacular acting. I have re-watched each season over and over again, including watching again for some scence that I think are great between Murdoch and Julia. However, I noticed that a two-hour Christmas special titled ""A Merry Murdoch Christmas"" is missing from Amazon list. I had to search elsewhere online, where I could watch it and I am glad I did because it continues to show the wonderful chemistry onscreen between these two people and how they make it believable. With the help of Julia's flair for getting Murdoch to be a little bit more open, it carries through in this Christmas special at their home. Can't wait for Season 10.",1461715200,31,691,4.815126050420168

8758774,3,B01EIS46CM,"I stated collecting this series DVDs for their insights into Toronto history.  Regrettably once the CBC became involved the show has become too politically correct, inserting racial characters who never would have been protaganists in their portrayed roles in the Toronto of the time late 1800s so I have ceased following them.",1532390400,,327,5.288461538461538

The main characters seem like old friends, and I especially enjoy the period setting, the accomplished women, e.g. Dr. Ogden, the historic figures, e.g. Thomas Edison, and the science behind solving the mysteries. Not to mention the ""Making Murdoch"" sections that add historic background and interest. The CDs are good quality and arrived as promised.",1529107200,,378,5.316666666666666
