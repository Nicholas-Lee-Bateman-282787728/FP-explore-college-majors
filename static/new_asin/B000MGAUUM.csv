2730275,1,B000MGAUUM,"I'm mother-tongue french and this DVD is so bad done. First of all they mostly speak in English, then the scenes are poorly done. I don't suggest to anybody to buy this DVD.",1296259200,8,173,4.2727272727272725
2730276,5,B000MGAUUM,"My 6 year old grand daughter absolutely loves this 2 volume set of learning French. It is just a great introduction to the language and engages children so they really want to learn.

I wish the company would make a set at level 2 so she could continue to learn even more French. It is a good investment.",1288915200,,304,4.241379310344827
2730277,5,B000MGAUUM,This video was perfect for my French kids who have forgotten a lot of their language.  It helped stimulate their memory and they really enjoy the characters.,1255478400,3,157,4.814814814814815
2730278,5,B000MGAUUM,"A bit cheesy..but aren't all language videos? It has a proper amount of pacing so that the language is easy to pick up. Easy to watch multiple times (well, loads easier than watching BARNEY videos anyway).",1203120000,6,205,4.722222222222222
2730279,5,B000MGAUUM,"We bought this video after previously watching and enjoying the French volume 1 from the same company.  My 3-year old daughter loves this one even more!  The production quality and animation has improved and the songs are even better.  In fact, my daughter wants to hear the songs again and again.  She also enjoys the ""quizzes"" at the end of each lesson.  The actors, who are older versions of the same kids in the first video, are very cute and charming.  My daughter loves to see other kids speak French and it encourages her to speak it as well.  The level of the video is fine for my daughter who recently enrolled in a French pre-school.",1172102400,10,643,4.491379310344827

8168457,2,B000MGAUUM,"The narrator's accent isn't good. He said ""le matin"" in a way where the emphasis was totally on the wrong syllable and made it nearly unrecognizable.  In addition to the English/French narrator, the dog Pezi has a weird voice that makes it hard to understand as well, although the 2 year old liked the dog. Additionally, it switches back and forth from English to French, which wouldn't be bad, but it's inconsistent: sometimes the English it switches to is WRITTEN subtitles, so my baby can't read it.  Other times, the narrator speaks it.  Makes it fairly useless for any kid who's not at reading age.  The sound quality varies within the DVD.  The kids are easy to understand, but the mother's voice is super soft and low in a way that you can't discern consonants well.  Some things are crisp, others aren't, so it's frustrating.  They could fix a lot of these problems in a subsequent update to the product, so maybe it will be better at some point.

From the library, it's not terribly insulting, but to buy it, I would've been not thrilled with my purchase. It's better than nothing, and adds variety to our viewing list of Muzzy, Little Pim and various Disney videos (like Little Einsteins) in french.",1370476800,,1209,4.669811320754717
8168458,2,B000MGAUUM,It was much too difficult for a 5yr. old as the characters spoke to quickly that it was hard to learn how to pronounce the words correctly.  My husband and myself had a difficult time as well.,1365033600,,192,4.1891891891891895
8168459,4,B000MGAUUM,"My little dauther loves it. We are not native English speakers. We are native Spanish speakers learning French as a second language, so I would prefer less English speaking on the DVD.",1344556800,2,184,4.78125
8168460,1,B000MGAUUM,"One star is very generous,it definitely earned ZERO STARS!!  But it won't allow me to rate it with zero stars?  I don't have experience with French language videos, but my daughter began learning Spanish with the WhistleFritz language videos and Speakee Videos and Salsa videos which are a worlds apart from this video. Even the Little Pim series which is somewhat boring and reminds me of Baby Einstein has this beat hands down.

My daughter recently decided that she wanted to learn French, so I thought this would be some entertainment/education.  The video is neither, and I cannot bring myself to watch it a second time. And my daughter is not interested in it again either, in fact I had to continuously encourage her to watch the video the first time.  It is so poorly done that I had to have the subtitles on to understand it.  Yes, it is repetitive, but that doesn't help, if the child (or adult) doesn't understand what the characters are referring to. I could have easily misinterpreted if not for the translation.  The narrator has to explain in English, because the editing leaves out scenes that would make it follow a comprehensive time line.  For example the in one scene the children are leaving the house to go to school, but in the next scene they walk back in the door apparently arriving home from school.

The characters also tend to talk among themselves more than to include the the viewer.  The viewer is not engaged to participate like in Kai Lan or Dora videos or previously mentioned Spanish language videos.  I cannot image how bad the first video must have been when I see the reviews that the second volume is much improved.  I based my purchase decision on the reviews of both the first and second volumes...seeing as how volume 2 had a limited number or reviews.  The reviewers who rated it more than one star must not have watched or received paid compensation for their favorable review.  Do not buy.",1298937600,,1935,4.669616519174041
8168461,2,B000MGAUUM,"I bought this for my three year old.  The idea was that I would watch it with her to guide her in her french learning.  But Pezi's voice is so terrible I can hardly stand it.  I can't believe no one else mentions this in their reviews?!  My daughter doesn't seem to mind as she seems entranced by the ""big kids"" - but she gets frustrated by the ""game"" which doesn't work on our DVD player and can't be skipped, forcing us back to the main menu to pick the next chapter.  Even though it was relatively inexpensive, I don't recommend it.  For a non educational video, but nice exposure to french - we both enjoy the Barbapapa cartoons but you can't get them on amazon.com",1298160000,,669,4.26984126984127
