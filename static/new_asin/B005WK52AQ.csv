8487940,5,B005WK52AQ,"When this review was written there were no reviews below five stars. That may seem suspicious to some readers. I want to stress that the message and its underlying arguments are the reason one gives it that five-star mark. The editing, music, design etc are not top notch, but for a documentary that is not important in the same way it would have been for an entertainment piece.

Watch the trailer on YouTube which have been uploaded by DenkmalFilm (username). It truly is one of those documentaries that will make you wonder. There are many highly respected members of society that does not want you to have an opinion about genetically modified organisms (GMOs).

This documentary requires no foreknowledge. It is sort of like listening to George Carlin about marketing or Richard Wolff about trickle down economics. In all seriousness, there is no reason to avoid this documentary. I would recommend it even if cost 5 times the amount of a regular movie.

Simply put: You will be a better educated person after watching that documentary. Do not be afraid to check every reference given throughout the video. There are no false bridges here. I encourage everyone to prove me wrong.",1469836800,,1184,4.880597014925373
8487941,5,B005WK52AQ,This is an extremely informative dvd. It's facts are formed from hard science and there are some personal stories from family members who were interviewed. It's a subject under the radar of mainstream media but very pertinent in our everyday lives.,1399852800,2,248,5.073170731707317

8487943,5,B005WK52AQ,"Important DVD giving info about how scientists are ostracized for trying to tell the truth. GM technology has never been proven to be safe for either consumption or the environment. Each time scientists, ecologists and environmentalists try to speak their opinions, their voices are stifled, many times vehemently, by corporate interests. We ignore the voice of reason at humanity's risk.",1396137600,3,388,5.483333333333333
8487944,5,B005WK52AQ,"Many scientists around the world have been under attack from the Big Ag Industry who control all research on their seeds. Scientific American magazine (August 2009) has an editorial about this called "" A Seedy Practice"". Most people are unaware that 70% of all grocery store food is GMO and the little independent testing that has been  done about the health effects are not pretty. Also see Jeffrey Smith's books and films.",1347494400,8,424,4.888888888888889
