The Marines special on the parade prep which showed the training they do was fascinating (Bonus Film: Pageantry of the Corps), but the early history before WWII seemed a bit rushed since there were 3 eps rather than 4 which some other branches got (but this didn't really detract from the film).

The Navy eps included new tech that the others didn't really mention.

The Army does a more equal survey of their history from the Revolution to Desert Storm.

The Air Force eps start from the Wright Brother to present & includes some examples of spy craft.

The Coast Guard eps was the shortest but was well done, and had some interesting stats when compared to other branches.

While most go through Desert Storm & focus on WWII to some included Desert Fox, and the war w/ Afghanistan.

Special Features:

Discussion of the seals for their branch (Branch Heraldries) & PDF files of material related each branch.",1325030400,4,921,4.7125
8084263,5,B000BB151Q,"I bought this because I thought the topic was interesting. I'm a big fan of the History Channel for the way it engages you, but not the type to read history books in my spare time either. Don't ask me the dates of anything. I'm here for the story... and that's exactly what you get here.

I especially appreciate the inclusion of the Coast Guard, which serves a very important function, despite it coming off as a footnote more then anything else history-wise. To be honest, I probably would not have bought the set if they weren't in there.

No, I'm not in the military, but still found this to be a very worthwhile set to add to my collection. Did I learn something? Yes. Was I entertained? Yes. Have I watched it more then twice since I've purchased it (6 months ago)? Yes. Do I recommend this set? Yes.

Hopefully some of that helps you in your decision.",1201996800,15,858,4.383647798742138
8084264,4,B000BB151Q,"As you would expect, typical History Channel stuff.  I do think thought that the Coast Gaurd one was very informative adds a lot of value to the set.  Great gift for the military buff on your gift list.",1165968000,4,202,4.2894736842105265
