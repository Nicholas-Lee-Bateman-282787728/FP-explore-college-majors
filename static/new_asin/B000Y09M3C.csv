8230445,5,B000Y09M3C,"We bought ""Chinese Take-out Specialty Dishes Cooking"" as part of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chinese-Take-out-Cooking-DVD-Box-Set/dp/B001EYG168/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chinese Take-out Cooking DVD Box Set</a>. This video does exactly what we hoped it would do, show us how to make the dishes we like to order when we go get Chinese Take-out.

We enjoyed the ""Egg Foo Young"" section the most on this video. This is one of our favorite take-out dishes and is very close to how our local Chinese restaurant makes it.

The video shows every cut, not fast forward or cut away. This can get a little tedious when she is pealing and cutting a 10 or so shrimp, but it isn't too bad. Compared to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chinese-Take-out-Main-Course-Cooking-DVD/dp/B000UWH1WS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chinese Take-out Main Course Cooking DVD</a>, this disc has a lot of ""narrative"" and voice over direction.

Some things to note:

* The ingredient list is very quickly shown at start of section, so it is best to pause and write them down because they are not always identified as the dish is being prepared.

* They also point you to their web site for spice and ingredient info. I should note that there is a lot of good information and tips on the site.

* They reference other videos in the series for more detailed instructions

* The video was shot without benefit of a tripod, so it can be a little jumpy and a little distracting

* The background music is somewhat repetitive and also a little distracting

This is a very good video and it does exactly what it advertises, teach you how to quickly make popular Take-out dishes.

Highly recommended!",1232496000,2,1757,5.474074074074074
