I spent my early childhood in Argentina during Evita's final years, and remember much of this history, which in many cases has been distorted and misunderstood, and this film brings some clarity to the Evita myth.
Eva Duarte (1919-1952) grew up in the small town of Los Toldos, one of five illegitimate daughters of a rancher, and then moved at 15 to Buenos Aires with a touring tango singer, later to get a job on radio, and by 1940, she had become a big star.

Evita met Juan Peron, a colonel twice her age while she was helping earthquake victims in 1944, and the rest is history. The pair changed the face of Argentina, and were loved by the workers and hated by the oligarchy; Evita gave women the vote, but freedom of the press was stopped, as well as the radio...when she bought the station that had once employed her.
It was a complex history, with Peronism almost a backlash to the extreme behavior of the wealthy and powerful before Peron came to power.
Her energy, dedication and ambition knew no bounds, but the flame burned for a very short time. Her massive funeral is shown, as well as the aftermath, where her remains were shuttled from country to country for decades.

Narrated by Jeremy Anderson (who sounds exactly like TV anchorman Peter Jennings), the voice of Eva Peron is spoken by Donna Cherry. It also includes interviews by people familiar with the history, some with heavy accents and who may be hard for everyone to understand.
Two things about the film I wish had been different: They never have an audio of Evita's voice, which must be available along with the film footage, and I could have done without the few minutes wasted interviewing Madonna, which feels stiff and pretentious, though it does point out how casting Madonna as Evita in the 1996 Andrew Lloyd Webber film was one of Hollywood's biggest blunders.
Total running time is 75 minutes.
Evita's fear was that she would be forgotten...a fear that I'm sure will never come to pass.",1103155200,7,2163,4.64490861618799
