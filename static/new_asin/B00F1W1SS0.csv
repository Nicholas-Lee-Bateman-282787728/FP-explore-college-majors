5963328,5,B00F1W1SS0,This is an outstanding collection...the only problem with my copy is I got 3 dvd/2 cd....it is supposed to be 2 dvd/ 3 cd....it has 2 copies of one of the dvd's and is missing the first cd......the dvd is unbelievably awesome......highly recommended for ALL Dream Theater fans,1383609600,,276,4.770833333333333
5963329,5,B00F1W1SS0,"First off, HOW does anyone post a review of something BEFORE it comes out?????
5 stars ONLY because of the inane 1 star review posted by some imbecile.
Dream Theater are a phenomenal band, and I can't wait for this massive live set to come out. That being said, I shall withold judgement until I actually listen to it!
FYI - the new studio album is absolutely fantastic, and I don't care what some half wit has to say in some ""review"". If I like it, that's all that matters. And the same should go for any true music fan - trust your own opinion, NOT someone else's.
Music is a personal experience, where others opinions are meaningless - listen to and buy what YOU like, not because someone gave it a good or bad review on a website.
I like what I like, and that's all that matters - if you don't like it, I DON'T CARE!!!!!!

5963330,1,B00F1W1SS0,"this band needs a new singer.  their concerts are boring and their music is overplaying... they have butchered songs from elton john to zebra throughout the years.  the new release is just as boring as all the rest.  talented, however their music puts me to sleep...  you want to listen to a top notch act???  RUSH!",1382745600,7,315,4.553571428571429
5963331,3,B00F1W1SS0,"I want to believe the DVDs and Blu-rays are mixed better than the movie-theater one.  John Myung was barely audible or visible in it. They really made him ""the silent bass player.""  I was really surprised he or the other band members did not speak up on it at mixing?  To me, the Dream Theater sound has always been about the four instrumentalists and not just the guitarist and vocalist. Man, I hope the DVDs or Blu-Rays are mixed better. This is Dream Theater...not Bon Jovi!

Nevertheless, I am thankful they continue to create this amazing music.  And props to James LaBrie for maintaining his vocals after all these years...",1381708800,14,629,4.681818181818182
5963332,5,B00F1W1SS0,"I saw this at an Ipic theater and was totally blown away.  Dream Theater has produced a number of excellent DVD releases and this one is no exception.

Although part of this rating is for the excellent picture and sound from the theater the camera work is exceptional.  John and Jordan are masters of technique and this film does the best of any release of showing what they do.  Mangini is really fun to watch and his speed is truly amazing.  John fills the bottom at a level consistent with everybody else in the band.  On the ballads James is excellent and he is pretty good on the faster stuff.

The real strength of this is showing this band is incredibly tight while they are all playing individual parts that are extremely difficult.

If you are a fan you have probably already decided to buy this.  If you are on the fence get it, you won't be disappointed.",1379980800,45,865,4.424050632911392

5963339,5,B00F1W1SS0,"In typical DT fashion - this is outstanding! The Petrucci guitar solo in particular is simplified, but, very moving and impessive. Mangini solo is unparalleled. Jordan, Myung and LaBrie are top notch, like always.",1478736000,,213,5.294117647058823
5963340,2,B00F1W1SS0,"First of all the product is advertised as Blu-ray when in fact I received a DVD disc set. Second and most important, I should have trusted the reviews that I read about the Audio quality, the mix is awful! I simply gave up watching the concert after 3 songs and I am returning it. I am definitely not a fanatic audiophile and I don't even have a home theater or surround sound system in my home, but it never prevented me to enjoy watching other concerts or movies. I just have a good ear for music and I like enjoying each instrument when I watch a concert.

However after re-reading other reviews about the sound quality (some of the reviewers seems pretty knowledgeable) I am wondering whether an actual Blu-ray disc set has a better audio mix than the DVD. As far as I understand the biggest difference to be expected when comparing a Blu-ray with a DVD disc should be the image quality. Moreover, I am not sure whether this concert actually requires a surround sound system (5.1 / 7.1 / 9.1 ...) to be appreciated. If that's the case I won't be able to watch it.

Just to make myself clear, my complain here is about the Audio MIX and not the audio quality itself. The audio is crisp and clear but the MIX is TERRIBLE. You simply cannot hear all the instruments. In a scale from 1-10 about what you can hear in this concert I would say: Guitars (10) / Vocals (8) / Drums (6) / Keyboards (3) / Bass (1). I would rather enjoy the beauty of the silence than such an off balance music.",1473292800,,1486,4.303571428571429

5963405,4,B00F1W1SS0,"Dream Theater's Live at Budokan Blu-Ray, in my opinion, is how live sound should be done. The mix fits the heavy nature of the songs, and the drums are clear and punchy.

The same cannot be said for this release, and I was pretty disappointed as a result. As a drummer, I obviously pay more attention to the recording of the drums than anything else - and that is where this recording falls flat. The toms do not sound punchy, and the bass drum is not ""commanding."" The cymbals don't punctuate the music quite like I wanted them to. On top of that, the guitar sounds isolated and not blended well with the rest of the mix. The keys are very quiet, which makes parts of songs that feature the keyboard sound off.

That being said, the performances are outstanding, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching the band with Mangini as their newest addition. The video quality is top-notch, and they did a good job in the editing room of showing specific members of the band during parts of songs where they are features. Dream Theater has been my favorite band for a long time, and their awesomeness overcomes the sound issues to still make this a solid and enjoyable release.",1399939200,,1164,4.538095238095238

5963407,4,B00F1W1SS0,"If you are a DT fan and on the fence about adding this live performance to your collection (and therefore reading reviews to help make that decision) the following may prove useful.

1. The audio mix is quite good. I could hear each musician clearly and consistently.
2. James LaBrie does as good a job or better on this live recording as other live DT recordings.
3. John Myungs bass playing is mixed in nicely and you can hear it just fine.
4. The quality of the video production is technically excellent. Lighting and mood is fantastic.
5. The Petrucci solo is delivered with powerful emotion and is unlike others youve heard
6. The acoustic version of Silent Man and Beneath the Surface supported by a string quartet is excellent.

If youve never seen DT live, I highly recommend you watch this or any live DT video you can get your hands on as youll have a greater appreciation for their musicianship.  If you own other live performances, this one has enough new material to more than make it worth your time and money.

The DVD and Blue Ray are reasonably priced and buying music like this supports the band and makes it possible for them to continue producing great music in a variety of formats (deluxe editions, etc.) Is the DVD perfect  no. Is worth $13 - $20 for the standard edition? Without question - yes.

Why not five stars? I do hope that the next time a live DVD comes out (God willing) that John Petrucci is not partially obstructed by stands.  This drove me nuts. On the slow tracks you can hear some mic hiss on the vocals which is a little distracting.  Id also prefer that the camera slow down and focus more time on each musician instead of flying around so much.  Dont let these minor imperfections dissuade you from picking this up, however.

Finally, while there are not many negative reviews (1-3 stars) at this time, I found that most of them are written either by fans lamenting Portnoys departure, people who don't like the surround sound mix (could be your system or your ability to set the EQ appropriately for this DVD), super die-hard fan/musical types whos expectations are way beyond that of the average listener (lowering star rating because DT is no longer using Korg Keyboards and Tama drums  seriously? Thats kind of a cool perspective to me, but come on Kramer Drummer really?), or are otherwise nonsensical musings that are dealt with appropriately by other commenters.",1398556800,4,2412,4.651764705882353

5963410,5,B00F1W1SS0,"I have been a DT fan for over 20 years.  This is the first video with Mike Mangini as the drummer.  I just saw them in concert a few weeks back and they are the real deal!!  The addition of Mangini has elevated the entire band to the next level.  This Blu-ray has many songs from the ""A Dramatic Turn of Events"" album.  The zoomed in footage allows you to witness these masters at their individual crafts.  I would highly recommend to DT fans.",1397692800,,443,4.214285714285714
5963411,5,B00F1W1SS0,This is another great Dream Theater DVD....The band is tight and preform so well together....Mike Mangini is a beast...I love Portnoy and wasn't sure how Mangini would fit in but they made no mistake by hiring him.....he covers the old stuff so well you wouldn't know it wasn't Portnoy....but he does have his own flair with the old stuff....he played everything almost note for note but makes it his own by the way he accepts differently...but still honors the work Portnoy did originally. Buy this if you love Drteam Theater....You won't be disappointed.,1396915200,,556,4.989247311827957

5963416,5,B00F1W1SS0,"I purchased this DVD because I have followed Dream Theater for over twenty years. In the category of progressive hard rock, they truly have no equal! After thirty years of being a musician, particularly a drummer, I am constantly amazed by this band. Live at Luna Park exemplifies what this band has accomplished over the years, and how their musicianship transcends from studio to stage. If you're a Theater fan, you will truly enjoy this DVD. If you simply enjoy progressive rock, you'll be blown away. A must have for any aspiring musician wanting to expand their musical knowledge, enjoy.",1394928000,,592,4.93

They might be extras simply because the quality is not as good as the main concert, but that was the frustrating part, there is no way (or at least obvious way) to play them as a whole... The bonus song returns to the main menu and you have to manually select the next one to play...",1394668800,,543,4.313725490196078

First off...the drum solo...AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I want it as my ringtone!!!
I don't think I've heard better vocals from James LaBrie live since the images and words tour.  In fact the band sounded so much like the studio recordings that I almost thought it was dubbed lol.  This DVD is in no way dissapointing, on par with Live at Budokan and Score!  My new favorite Dream Theater DVD!!!",1393372800,,452,5.0675675675675675

5963428,4,B00F1W1SS0,"Gosh, us Dream Theater fans are really picky, right? I've been a fan since I&W was released, WAY back. Saw them play at Jaxx bar in Springfield, VA to a couple hundred people, and then again for SFAM tour, which was fantastic. Anyway, suffice to say, I've seen the band grow and I've been able to appreciate all the style changes. I like DT....a lot! So why not 5 stars? Like I said, us fans can be picky! Bottom line, this one doesn't stack up to Budokan, either visually or sonically. I'm going to rate Score better too. In fact, I even liked Metropolis 2000 better, even though it's SD, 4:3 and stereo only. What??? Does that mean this is a bad Blu-ray? Not at all, but it's missing something. The picture is HD, had sweeping camera work, but it felt static and dry. The sound is a problem too. The surround mix is really bad. For me the best sound combination was to choose the stereo track and then process it through my receiver's THX Cinema mode, which made for a much better sound stage. Even then, the bass and keys were really low in the mix. HINT: Don't let Petrucci mix the sound! LaBrie's vocals are often spotty live, as I feel he pushes himself too hard live. And that's the case here a few times, but overall his performance was good. I can't say that Mangini's interpretations of Portnoy's work was spectacular, but it was fine. He really shined on the songs he recorded on though and his solo was amazing! Everyone one else was great too, which is no surprise. A couple other things about the release that bother me are that 6 of the songs are in the bonus section and they were clearly part of the show, so I'm not sure why they weren't just included in the main program. Also, you can't play all of the bonus songs together, you have to choose each track individually. OK, that being said, this is a good show overall, despite my criticisms and probably belongs in any DT fan's collection. I just wished they could have delivered a 5 star product!",1392422400,2,1967,4.391780821917808
5963429,5,B00F1W1SS0,"Its BluRay...looks great! May be my settings but the everything seemed to drown out some of Mangini's magic.

5963437,5,B00F1W1SS0,"This DVD is not a disappointment. A lot of people freaked out when Mike Portnoy (The FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE BAND) quit in 2010 and left a huge void to fill. Most fans saw the try-out videos and therefore know how that all went. Mike Mangini was the only possible choice and this DVD is the proof. The man is amazing! you have watch closely to get how fast he's able to move his hands and feet. Portnoy ain't no slouch but ""Holy-Soup"" this guy isn't quite human. A ""one-handed"" drum roll is gonna leave the viewer with that impression. The whole video is amazing. Great camera work even-balanced sound and along standing Dream Theater tradition of constantly pushing the envelope makes this a damn great DVD.  A must have for any true Prog fan and for damn sure a must have for Dream Theater fans.",1391472000,,796,4.4520547945205475

5963439,5,B00F1W1SS0,"I'll start out by addressing the elephant in the room.  Mike Portnoy is gone and Mike Mangini is behind the kit. Difference?  None.  Mike was the right choice for the band when M. Portnoy opted out of the band. He's missed as a member of the band, but the band with M. Mangini still rocks and plays brillinatly with their brand of Progressive Metal.

This is my third DT video and I have to say that the band has brought it to the stage each time.  This crowd truly loved the band and DT loved them back.  All 5 members did what they do best...play.

Don't hesitate if you're hesitating to buy this. This is a band still getting better as writers and as musicians and as performers.",1391040000,,682,4.28125
5963440,3,B00F1W1SS0,Please will someone record a dvd with real live sound again. This is like a studio album with a crowd you can barely hear added. Also missing classic brilliant leads by the players is just sinful and shows a lack of knowledge of the bands work or extreme laziness.

While Mike Mangini can never match Mike Portnoy's personality behind the kit (no one can), he is an amazing talented drummer.
The only flaw is the mix, in which the keys, bass, and toms are a little low.",1390003200,,381,4.428571428571429

5963448,5,B00F1W1SS0,"Another stellar release from DT. I have read through most of the negative reviews and sound mix seems to be a recurrent theme. Personally, I did not find a consistent lack of mix. There are a few times, VERY few, where Jordan's mix seemed to be way down (the second chorus run of Breaking All Illusions is the only one that really stands out). Otherwise, I didn't find the mix issues that many have reported. I have listened to the concert through my sound bar and through my TV's speakers and both sources, the mix of instruments was consistently balanced.

Video wise, excellent quality. As with any live concert I have seen on Blu, there is no getting around how blue lights just don't translate well. Other than the ""blue light"" instances, video quality is excellent.

Overall quality of the camera work and presentation, I really liked the different angles we got this time around compared to their 6 other official live concert releases. Boom shots were used a lot more as well as the handhelds were put in different locations than on previous recordings. I have seen other reviewers say Myung is not seen much, but I am not sure what concert they were viewing, but he was consistently seen, just as much as he ever is or wants to be for that matter.

Song list boasts 11 songs previously not seen via any of the previous 6 official releases; 9 of those being from A Dramatic Turn of Events. I enjoyed the fact that we have the whole album represented here in the main concert and bonus songs. The song ""These Walls"" is presented for the first time ever in an official live video as is ""Caught In A Web"" (It was part of the live CD for ""Once in Live-Time"" but not on the video). The rest of the set lists includes staples and two songs we have not seen on an official video since their first live from Tokyo video (A Fortune in Lies and Wait for Sleep). If I had any real critique of the set list, it is I wish they had gone with ""Glass Prison"" from Six Degrees rather than ""War Inside My Head"" and ""The Test that Stumped them all"". Mainly because ""Glass Prison"" remains one of my favorite songs of theirs and it has yet to be featured in an official live video release. By the way, I keep saying ""official"" so as to be clear I am referring to the previous 6 official live video releases to date. I realize there are bootlegs that have featured all of their songs at one time or another, but my review is speaking specifically to only the official releases.

All of the players are in top form. James' vocals are stronger than ever. I swear he has gotten better with age. Myung, Rudess and Petrucci bring their A++ game and then some. Mangini, the man is a beast. But more so, his energy and presence is a major breath of life to the band live. I have seen some other reviewers say the concert was lifeless. I cannot disagree more. Mangini makes eye contact with each and every member of the band at some point during every song. The obvious connection there takes the energy level up 10 notches. This is the most animated I have seen the band as whole. Finally, we get with this set something we haven't seen since ""Once in a Livetime"" and that is an intimate setting segment. The songs ""The Silent Man"" and ""Beneath the Surface"" are presented in an acoustic setting with the addition of a small string section. A very nice touch. We get to actually hear Petrucci's backing vocals in this setting.

The bonus 5 songs are a welcome extra, to include a multiangle option on one where you see first hand the many different angles we were given in this concert that sets it apart from others. The ""making of"" has all the right balance you would want and the behind the scenes is the usual peek behind the veil. All in all, the bonus content is satisfying.

All together, everything in this release receives high praise from me. It was recently announced that the boys are going to record a special concert at Berklee to be featured in a future video release. It is a great time to be a DT fan for sure.",1389744000,,4005,4.390835579514825

5963468,5,B00F1W1SS0,"The best DT concert video I have seen (and Score is hard to beat).
Petrucci was amazing in every way. You can see him leading the band, which is cool. The thing I like about the band with Mangini is that the guys are visibly playing off of each other. This was noticed when I saw them live on this tour as well. They move around the stage more, they interact, especially around the drum throne. Watch Score and you don't see that. Also I like Jordan's use of his iPad apps.

Portnoy vs Mangini? Both are outstanding, though I do think Portnoy has a certain groove that Mangini doesn't quite match (I'm being picky here).

Also given the fact that it was delayed till after the release of the new disc, .... I just don't get it. Also didn't care for the long acoustic part in the middle. Just too long.

And I missed some songs from Falling Into Infinity (Peruvian Skies/Trial of Tears/Lines In The Sand). But that doesn't take the quality of this DVD.

5963485,3,B00F1W1SS0,"Here is the problem with Dream Theater in 2013. They are not as exciting as they were in previous years and I am not quite sure why? They have a drummer in Mike Mangini that other bands would salivate for. They have the talent and ability to play and write whatever they want. They are all familiar with direction and where each other is going. So what gives?

The loss of Mike Portnoy has meant 2 things.

1. The spontaneous nature of the band has been lost with regards to set list's being different every night. Dream Theater in 2013 rarely deviates from the same show every night.

2. The music risks seem absent.

I am one of the few who believes it was time for Portnoy to walk on and someone else come in. Mike had obviously completed what he wanted to with the band and go play with 34 other bands. His personality of ADD/OCD is just too much to keep up with and it apparently didn't fit in with the other guys any longer or to his liking. The situation seems better off. The band now has 2 Grammy nominations since he has left, both records have been Top 10 records for DT on Billboard. They seem more at ease.

BUT.

This DVD is pretty BORING. I don't see anything that is over excited or crazy about this crowd as they advertised. It seems pretty standard to me. The musicianship is top notch and Mangini puts on one of the best solos I have seen in my life. But it comes up short this round. I eagerly await the new tour and hope they film this one as they should be more comfortable to explore and improvise more with Mike having been in the band almost 5 years by the time the tour hits the states.",1386547200,,1612,4.200647249190938

5963487,5,B00F1W1SS0,"Dream Theater is one of those bands that fans often get excited about when a live concert video/album comes out, it almost never fails. Live At Budokon is a favorite amongst many, and the Blu-Ray reissue is a must-own. Chaos In Motion was often criticized for it's boot-leg picture quality, but the sound quality was the best, and it was a great document of the band's Chaos In Motion tour. For Live In Luna Park, there's a certain divide amongst fans: ones that love everything on it, and ones disappointed with the sound quality. I'm one of those that love it for what it is, and it sounds awesome. I'm not a sound engineer or musician, but I've heard enough recordings, and my ears can hear certain elements in the music. All I can say is try both audio tracks. I never really find the DTS track to my liking for concerts, I usually go with stereo. As far as the tracklisting: like other Dream Theater concerts, it's expansive. For this one, it's not quite career-spanning as they don't cover every album, but it's long enough that you won't really care enough to be bothered by that. Everything on the Blu-Ray disc totals at about 300 minutes, while the main concert alone is about 2 hours and 40 minutes, and that doesn't include the six bonus songs. Be prepared for marathon-viewing if you try to view it all, but otherwise it's totally worth it for the right price.",1386201600,,1372,4.536290322580645
5963488,3,B00F1W1SS0,"Not much to say about the performances, these musicians are masters of their instruments. Too bad they didn't hire people that are masters of their mixing boards and mastering projects. This seems to have been happening a lot lately, with RUSH and also Dream Theater, where the digital driven environment have been causing a great disservice to the **quality** of the audio productions of late.

The mix on this production offers a sound that is thin, has no spacial depth. Part of the problem in my opinion has to do with the choice of instruments - for example, listen to the DT recordings when Rudess was still using Kurzweil keyboards instead of Korg. His sounds were more refined, 'professional' so to speak. Same goes for the drums, where everything changed. I think this is a change for the better when it comes to the drummer, Mangini is vastly superior. But his equipment is sub-par, cymbals are low quality (I wish Mike used Paiste cymbals) and his Pearl drums just don't have the same 'body' TAMA has.

Add to that a mixing work that doesn't take into account dynamics and correct use of the frequency ranges produced by the instruments, and you get a thin-sounding, light, medium-frequency heavy mix that just doesn't translate correctly what this band is doing on stage (or in the studio recently). I don't know if the recording equipment in Argentina was appropriate or not, or if the sound has been captured wrong, but this work leaves a lot to be desired.

The camera work doesn't bother me much, although I have seen better. Sometimes the musician shown is not the one doing the heavy work at the moment, so some passages where it would be interesting to see ""how in hell did he do that"", aren't shown.

So my conclusion is yes, it's worth it to have it in the collection. But the sound quality will leave you sad. The heaviness and Hi-Fi just isn't there anymore.",1386115200,,1881,4.673716012084592

5963494,4,B00F1W1SS0,"Dream Theater's latest live release is another very worthy entry in their much admired catalogue and demonstrates why the band continues to reign as the kings of progressive metal music.

If I could, I would rate this release a 4.5.  My only quibble is with the set list, which to me is a little unbalanced, but that is really just a matter of personal preference.  There are already many detailed and well thought reviews here - I won't attempt to compete with those but would like to share a few observations of my own.

Unlike some reviewers, I think the sound quality is good.  I have not heard the 5.1 mix but to my ears the quality of the stereo mix is such that I would rank the recording among the best of the band's numerous live releases.

In particular, I think the ADToE tracks benefit from this slightly more aggressive and 'guitar prominent' mix. (I thought the orchestral synths were overdone on the studio album).  The band as a whole plays very well throughout and in my view they do not suffer at all - in a live setting  at least - from Mike Portnoy's absence.  They remain a fearsomely powerful - and it would seem very contented - live band.

I do find the video editing to be annoyingly fast, but unfortunately that is a relatively standard practice these days and it's one I'm (reluctantly) adjusting to.

In terms of the set list, I think the show would have been better had it included a true epic such as Octavarium or A Change of Seasons. Or something from Black Clouds and Silver Linings (preferably the ambitious and majestic Count of Tuscany),  particularly as no live recording have been released from that tour.  But a band with a catalogue as extensive as Dream Theater's will never please everyone and I don't doubt that most fans will find much to enjoy (particularly given the generous inclusion of the alternate tracks).  I know I have.

I should add that the packaging on the deluxe version is very good.  The hardcover book which houses the six discs is well constructed and printed on good quality paper and the photos themselves are well done.  Some written reminisces from the band on the tour or perhaps a piece from their biographer would have been a nice touch, but again it is unfair to complain about such things.  Beyond the inclusion of the full show (and bonus tracks) on CD, there is no additional video content beyond that included with the standard Blu-ray or DVD release.

In summary, this is an excellent release that serves many worthwhile roles.  It is of course a wonderful document of the ""Dramatic Turn"" tour and a fine complement to that album and its fascinating documentary on the recruitment of their new drummer.  It also acts as an excellent introduction to Mike Mangini for fans like (those in Australia) who have yet to see him perform live with the band.  Finally, given the production delays and subsequent quirky timing of its release, it serves to very effectively whet the appetite for the upcoming tour in support of their recent, and very strong, self titled album.  I, for one, cannot wait to see them again.",1385596800,,3084,4.6286764705882355
5963495,5,B00F1W1SS0,"Great show, great musicians, with perfect crowd and performance.  New drummer shows his stuff.  Yes he can carry this music and work in this mix of the truly greatest musicians of our time.",1385337600,,189,4.696969696969697
5963496,3,B00F1W1SS0,"Overview:
I had to notch this rating down to 3 because this was definitely not up to typical DT standards.  It almost goes without saying for anybody that knows DT, the songs and artistic musicianship are not of this world.  These guys are like music Olympians.  I've been a follower of DT since '97, own every album, and have multiple DVDs and been to 10+ concerts.  They are all of exceptional quality, and this one does not follow for some reason.  It's a little painful to write anything bad about my favorite band, but I must swallow my pride.

The Good:
The video is very nice in HD.  I like the setlist.  It was nice to see ""6:00"" done live as I have never seen this song performed live.  You don't hear much from the ""Awake"" album.  Speaking of the ""Awake"" album, ""Caught In a Web"" is available on the bonus tracks and ""The Silent Man"" is done acoustically with a string quartet.  I think this is one of the highlights, since you don't get to see this side of DT very often.  There was also a song (A Fortune In Lies) on there that, I'm guessing, is a either very very old or a new bonus song, because I've never heard this song before.  Where did this come from?

This is the first tour with new drummer, Mike Mangini.  This guy is a machine and you will be impressed by the drum solo.

Bonus features are also done well and always enjoy the behind the scenes.  A little on the short side for me.

The Bad:
My short stoner version would be... dude? c'mon man.
I just can't believe how off balance the mix is.  How did this happen?  The guitars and vocals are very hot, keyboard very weak and the bass.... well, that almost doesn't exist!  Drums seem ok.  This is highly disappointing for me.  It's bad enough to where I wouldn't show this to people that are seeing DT for the first time.  ""Live at Budokon"" and ""Score"" are much better live DVDs for the mix.

Conclusion:
It is an enjoyable DVD and worth having for a DT fan, but just be prepared to barely hear Mr. Rudess on the keyboard and Mr. Myung on bass.",1385251200,20,2019,4.263852242744063

It's definitely one of the best live concert DVD/Blurays I've ever watched.",1385164800,,434,4.723684210526316
5963498,5,B00F1W1SS0,"*Edit: Okay...I've checked back and I 5 people have not found my review helpful. I knew my review was long, but I guess it was a little too long for people to read or understand properly. As such, I've condensed this review somewhat (even taken out a couple of unnecessary ramblings) and hopefully it will be more informative and well-received than before.

As the title of the review says, if I could give this DVD/CD 4.5 stars instead of 5, I would have. It's not perfect by any means, but it is excellent. I want to focus on three main things in this review: the band members and their performance here, the setlists on each DVD/CD, and the audio mix.

I'll start by giving an overview of each of the current members and how I feel they performed here. I'll give each of them a rating out of 5, and I'll explain why briefly in each overview.

John Petrucci (Guitars/Backing Vocals): Along with John Myung, John Petrucci is the only original member of Dream Theater still touring and recording with the band. It is worth mentioning that John has a guitar solo on this DVD/CD. Through his solo and in the songs, you can tell that he pours his heart and soul into every note he picks. Petrucci gets a 5/5 on this performance.

John Myung (Bass Guitar): As already mentioned, John Myung is one of the original members of Dream Theater.  He is an absolute monster of a bass player. Some of his finger work is so fast that it literally looks sped up on some parts. Check out the 32nd notes he does on 6:00 and you'll see what I mean. Like with Petrucci, John Myung gets a 5/5 on this performance.

James LaBrie (Lead Vocals): James has developed somewhat of a mixed reputation over the years with his voice. However, despite suffering from a major setback in 1994 and seemingly developing some bad habits over the last decade, he has come a long way and has improved noticeably over the past two years. He just needs to improve his high mid range (still too nasily sounding, as you'll see during many of the songs from Images and Words/Awake that are performed here) and stick to the melody more closely and he'll be pretty much back to his old self. James gets a 3.5/5 here.

Jordan Rudess (Keyboard Instruments): The keyboard wizard himself! Jordan is definitely your stereotypical musical prodigy.  Jordan is very technical on every instrument he plays here, from the Keyboard to the Continuum Board to his Ipad! Like John Petrucci and Mike, Jordan has a keyboard solo here, and it is very much a treat to see! Jordan gets a 4.5/5 on this performance.

Mike Mangini (Drums): Mike Mangini is the newest member of Dream Theater. He's incredibly technical, being able to play complex polyrhythms and pretty much fly around the kit all the while keeping time very precisely. He showcases his talent throughout the songs on this performance as well as in his solo, which he does during the first half of the main show. I'm definitely glad he joined Dream Theater, and I can't wait to see what he has to offer in the coming years. Despite a few slight timing hiccups (which every drummer has), Mike gets a 4.5/5 on this DVD/CD.

Next, I'd like to talk about the setlist on both DVDs.

The first DVD (and the first 2 CD's) contains the full show plus encore song from one of the two nights that was taped. Being that this was the tour to promote A Dramatic Turn of Events, a lot of songs from that album were played here, 7 in fact (with the other 2 being in the bonus tracks). Even so, a lot of the classics were played here, such as A Fortune in Lies, 6:00, and of course the inevitable epic (and my favorite Dream Theater song), Metropolis. The array of songs and dynamics is fairly balanced, leaning towards the louder, heavier songs as per usual with this band. As mentioned in the profiles of each band member, there are three solos on this DVD! I don't think I've seen this many on one of their live tapings yet, and each of them contributes well to the overall show. Also, a bonus is that on several songs there is a string quartet that backs up the band and gives a sound reminiscent of some of the tracks from their Score DVD. As usual, the concert ends on a high note with one of their longer, more epic songs. First, there is Breaking All Illusions, which is one of the last tracks from A Dramatic Turn of Events. Of course, no Dream Theater show is complete without an encore, and they chose Metropolis Part 1: The Miracle and the Sleeper. Just in case I forgot to mention, the concert is just short of three hours long.

The second DVD contains all of the bonus materials. First, there are six bonus tracks. These are These Walls, Build me up; Break me down, Caught in a Web, Wait for Sleep, Far From Heaven, and Pull me under. The two songs from A Dramatic Turn of Events that were not included on the first DVD are played here. Two of the songs include the string quartet mentioned just moments ago, and they do a great job. This DVD also features a Documentary, a cartoon introduction, and a couple of other tidbits. They aren't necessary to explain, but they are cool to watch.

I bought the package that also had the CD's of the show. The CDs are simply the songs from the DVD. The first two CDs are the main show while the 3rd CD contains all of the bonus tracks. Not much to them other than that.

Finally, time for my favorite part, the mix! I don't know much about cameras and camera work, but it seemed adequate, as did the crowd interaction with the band and vice versa.

Overall the mix was quite nice. I did have a few issues, which I will talk about here. As far as the individual instruments go, I think that most of them were EQ'd, Compressed, Panned, etc. fairly well. I thought a few little things were lacking, though. For one, John's backup vocals were a tad too quiet. Also, the electric guitar was a hair too loud at times. Some of Jordan's settings were louder than others, so at times he was a hair too quiet. They should have focused on making those more consistent. The bass was also noticeably too quiet, which made the mix sound a tad empty in terms of the low end. Some VERY slight panning on the guitars and the keyboards would have been nice so that the bass would have more room. Finally, I felt the drum mix needed some slight tweaking in a couple of areas. First, the panning on some of the cymbals was a bit distracting and the big gong behind the kit should have had its own microphone (or they should've turned it up louder if it did). It sounded too ""distant"" and I'd like to have that ""full bodied"" gong sound when he hits it (which was only once or twice, but still). Also, the 26"" kick drum needed a bit more low end, and the 20"" gong drum needed more life. It was all ""attack"" and no body or low end, both of which it needed a significant amount more of. If I could have made one change to the mix overall, it would be to add in more room sound. It sounded too dry and ""studio""-like. The amount of room sound on Live at Budokan was perfect and should have been used here also. Still, the mix was a lot better than on the Score DVD (where there was too much room sound and the drums were mixed TERRIBLY), so I can't complain too much.

Well, I think I covered it all as much as I can. Dream Theater continues to put out great music and live performances, and I think they've still got quite a future ahead of them. Let's all hope and pray they don't go through any more lineup changes anytime soon and that LaBrie gets his hi-mid range to sound like the rest of it, and everything will be awesome! In short, I'd recommend this DVD. I enjoyed it, and I look forward to listening to the music many more times to come. Thanks for reading!",1385078400,,7683,4.362237762237762
5963499,5,B00F1W1SS0,"Perfect Picture.  Amazing lossless audio.  Anyone who is a fan of music perfection must own this.  Even if you are not a Die Hard Dream Theater fan, such as I, take a look at this one, for the sheer sonic awesomeness of this Blu Ray",1385078400,,232,4.111111111111111
5963500,4,B00F1W1SS0,"The setlist is great, though I maybe would have swapped out some of the ADToE songs for some more of 6DOIT or SFAM stuff. The Awake songs played are the highlights for me. James' singing sounds really good to me, better than Budokan but not as good as on Score.

The worst part of this is the mix though- Petrucci is God, but he's way too loud and he almost completely drowns out Jordan (keys) and Myung (bass). In fact, not only can't you hear the bass you almost never see Myung at all! What did he mess around with the editor's wife or something? Strange that's he's left out on almost every song.

Mangini is a machine, almost to a fault. At least it looks like he's having a great time and he can play Portnoy's stuff with his eyes closed if tasked I'm sure. I'm sure JP doesn't miss Portnoy's spittle all over his amps but I think I miss his presence. I miss his alternating setlists, that's for sure.",1384992000,2,907,4.267441860465116
5963501,4,B00F1W1SS0,"Great show, great documentary. DT is always amazing. Good price too.

The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that the audio is not perfect. I know it's a video, but with the DTS HD Master Audio I expected better. It's not that the audio that is there isn't nice, it's that the production mix isn't great all the way through. Some songs have a fair representation of all instruments, some are low on drums, bass, or keys.",1384905600,,426,4.325
5963502,4,B00F1W1SS0,"I love this band and the new lineup, DTOE was awesome, timeless and classic, and the songs are even better live. The performance is legendary, and the DVD captures it honestly. Somehow I've waited a long time for this to come out and it kind of missed the mark. First of all, I hope the DVD/Blue Ray/CD/Vinyl/T-shirt $100 bundle craze GOES AWAY SOON (I have a bigger beef with Black Sabbath). Put out the standard crap and let us buy the same thing over and over again in different media formats (we will). No separate cd and no I-Tunes as I write this. Secondly the inherent sound problems with the mike totally ruin the acoustic set for me. Third no songs from Train of Thought whatsoever, criminal since that was the one that got my wallet involved. My last gripe is the bonus performances, songs which should have been in the main show (yes it's true they didn't play Pull Me Under in Chicago and now that I've heard it Mangini-style I'm even more pissed). The documentary is cool, it's a long show, and it's really the marketing that I have an issue with. Now I'll go listen to their new studio cd, Moving Pictures.",1384819200,,1120,4.46829268292683
5963503,5,B00F1W1SS0,"Its awesome how a  20 year band still delivers power and talent. I need to be sincere, this Concert is not my favorite from them in terms of camera angles and sound quality, The camera angles are sloppy at times, and Myung is almost missing...Whyyyy? In sound quality the voice of Labrie takes an emotional passage throughout the show, but at times, its just out of tune (but not horribly). I was listening to Scenes from NY cd, and the sound of every instrument just sounded perfectly balanced....here, some of the instruments feels overpowered by the guitar, depending on the song. The drumming is great, but if you compare it to Scenes from NY, it sounds muffled, it just don't has that ""thumping"" sound. I think the mixing could be better, BUT RATHER THAN THAT, ITS A MUST BUY FOR EVERY ONE, FAN OR NOT. TALENT DONT NEED FANS, JUST MIND AND ATTENTION....and don't miss the documentary, is beautiful! I was going to rate it 4/5 but the documentary made change my mind so 5/5!!! This band deserves it!!!",1384819200,,1005,4.614525139664805
5963504,5,B00F1W1SS0,"These guys are at the top of their game. Blasting the album through my hifi and checking the crystal-clear blu-ray release; I don't really think the sound mix is too bad (it's a little flatter on the DVD though)
I bought the 60-page deluxe edition

The band are completely reinvigorated after all the crap they've been through. James LaBrie comes across as very gracious and genuinely humbled by the bands reinvention with Mangini. Say what you want about DT going on without Portnoy, but these guys seem spiritually closer and happier together.",1384819200,,545,4.923913043478261
5963505,4,B00F1W1SS0,"I was really looking forward to this release.  Dream Theater is a tremendous band but live is where they really shine so, to me, the live releases are always my favorite.  This release doesn't disappoint.....almost....

Visuals:  Top notch quality.  Good camera angles and cuts although you miss Portnoy's influence on the production.

Band Playing:  Best in years.  I love Portnoy and Mangini but the band seems so energized and excited with this new lineup.  Mangini brings a different musicality to the performances and the personalities of the other band members really shine through.  In particular John Myung's bass playing stands out for me in this release.

Sound:  Ahhh yes the sound.  I have to admit that I watched this Blu Ray before I read a single review and found some serious issues with the sound.  In particular when James LaBrie is singing ""softly"" the ""S"" hisses and pops from his mic/processing are distracting to the point that I have to fast forward.  Also the cymbal mic'ing is terribly uneven.  The mix is not the best and, in my opinion, doesn't convey the collective energy of the band.

Overall:  ""A"" for performances and visuals.  ""B-"" for sound.  A- overall because I can get past the sound issues.

Next time please please please hire Kevin Shirley to engineer and mix your live releases.  He is the master of catching heavy bands live (see Budokan, Iron Maiden, and anything else he has touched).",1384473600,11,1428,4.8625
5963506,5,B00F1W1SS0,"This review is for the Blu-Ray version. I sat last night and watched this concert. To me, it started a little slow or ""off"", but once they got warmed up - YES!! The sound quality and the mix are excellent. Their were a few times where James Labrie's voice was ""scratchy"" and this could have been a microphone issue, and it was amplified on my sound system. I was just sitting here thinking - what if I had never heard ""Take The Time"" on the radio in 1994? I would have lost so much musical enjoyment and inspiration from this band and all of the bands I have discovered since this band. If you like a variety of music types that span over 20 years from the best band on the planet than I would say this is worth the money even for the basic disc.",1384473600,,746,4.116438356164384
5963507,3,B00F1W1SS0,"I have collected all of their DVD's, I love the band.  This IS a good show, no question...but I think the vocal mic on this recording sounds really bad and it drives me nuts.  It's very crispy, not a fan of the way some of these sounds were put on tape (or computer...however you look at it).  It's nice to see Mangini play these tunes...but I have to admit that I think the new self titled disc is 5 times better than A Dramatic Turn Of Events...just from the ""Song Writing"" standpoint.  The majority of this concert IS A Dramatic Turn.  All this said, if you are just getting into collecting their 6 or 7 live DVD's...these are my fav's...Score (an amazing show, but I also love Octovarium,, great disc) and even though it also doesn't sound great audio wise...""performance wise""...Live In Japan...their fist live outing on ""Images and Words""...James is on fire on that one!!!",1384387200,3,878,4.602564102564102
5963508,3,B00F1W1SS0,"Disclaimer: I'm not an audio engineer.
Admission: The mix is terrible.

I'm not sure what else to say.

For some context, I happened upon the Blu-Ray at a local HMV. I was excited to get home at watch it. Of course, it's always fun to watch DT rip through their repertoire, but I felt like whoever mixed this album has a love affair with guitarists. I didn't purchase the Blu-Ray (with full DTS surround sound to boot) to only hear Petrucci, as much as I love him. Rudess and Myung are completely lost in the mix. At first I thought I had blown a speaker or that something was wrong with my system, but after fiddling with the settings for about an hour, I just gave up.

Also, the camera work had to be organized by someone who was high on a serious dose of caffeine. That's all I'll say.

Negatives aside, I still had fun watching it (although I doubt it will ever get a second viewing in my house). And the best part for me was the documentary. I love getting a bit of an inside-view into the lives of great musicians like these.

However, I do find it a bit strange that, out of 3 hours of content on a concert Blu-Ray, the most fulfilling segment wasn't even a portion of the live show.

Major disappointment.",1384387200,13,1214,4.279475982532751
5963509,3,B00F1W1SS0,"It's a fairly good show. I like the mix of old and new music. Some old staples that haven't been heard in a while. But the over all feel is nothing special. Maybe they were at the end of the tour and burnt but they seem kinda lifeless and just going through the motions. And I guess they'll just never be the same DT to me without Portnoy. Mangini is competent but lacks the soul that Mike gave to this group. Video quality is pretty good. Not too much cut and pan. DTS HD gets a 3.5 to 4 star. Some places really good. Other times a bit washed out. Drums / keyboards / bass all disappear in a wall of noise. Not reference quality. But not too bad. Definitely worth having if you're even remotely a fan. Budokan is better.

Got to give them credit for being touring fiends though. Maybe that's it. They are definitely showing age. And weight. Aren't we all!",1384300800,5,857,4.225609756097561
5963510,5,B00F1W1SS0,"I will come back later and beef up the content of my review... just know that I'm a HUGE DT fan.  I honestly wept when I saw the performance of Metropolis Part 1 on this DVD.  The band just nails it and they've never been able to come close to nailing that song on previous concert releases (yes even the Score version).  I just can't explain the joy that rushed over me to hear the band perform all of these songs.  Mangini is an absolute monster, and the rest of the band sounds 100 times tighter than ever.  I now understand why Mangini needs to be the drummer for this band.  I'm amazed by everything here: Bridges is a bad ass opener and they kill it.  Lost Not Forgotten is mind bending.. everything is just so good.

I will admit that Labrie gets a little too far out with 6:00 but it doesn't even come close to ruining this masterful performance.  His voice sounds amazing through most of the songs here.  I let my kids watch this and they are mesmerized by Jordan R on keys... (they think he's a real wizard, and I'm starting to think so, too!)

Watching this concert brings back my faith in music.  AMAZING STUFF.  Dream Theater are now operating on all cylinders and there's no stopping them.  They are untouchable on stage.",1384300800,4,1235,4.359649122807017
5963511,5,B00F1W1SS0,Overall the band is in top form here. I only wish the filming was done a little more tastefully however. Too many spinning shots and not enough wide shots of the stage from the audiences perspective. Also Jordan and Myung are a little lost in the mix at times. Still an intense watch but Live At Budokan is still my favorite.,1384300800,,325,4.344262295081967
5963512,3,B00F1W1SS0,"Because this video made me insane.

I'm going to join the naysayers after this blu ray.  I tried to be supportive of their new choice of musician but Portnoy is greatly missed.  That drum machine... I mean robot... I mean Mike Mangini is nothing more than a drummer reproducing sounds.  Portnoy would accent something different during every show.  If I wanted to hear the record, i would listen to it.  It's great they can replicate complex rhythms and flurry of notes but the soul is missing.  It's certainly amazing they can jerk off on there instruments, that's why I first fell in love with them, so no need to get into that.

Next, The mix.  What happened?  Sure, I'm a guitarist but that's not all I listen to DT for.  It's the collective of musicians that makes the band.  Where is John Myung?!  No really, you won't be able to hear him, or even see him since he only has about 5 minutes of screen time in 3 hours.  I'm just glad other reviewers have made the same comment.

Lastly, the actual film it self.  Let's just say if I were a squirrel the editing would have been amazing, but since i have an attention span it's too fast and scattered.  This is Dream Theater, not Green Day where it needs to be flashy or you'd be bored to death.  And because it is DT most fans would like to watch each musician a bit closer and for longer, especially during their respective solos or parts.  This concert is another example of Portnoy's great talent.  He was excellent in the editing process as he painstaking made sure every cut coincided with a musical theme going on.

For the points that are decent.  The band, tight as ever.  The JP12, yum.  The songs from there back catalogue.  With great performances of ""Spirit Carries On"" and ""War Inside My Head/Test That Stumped"" as they loosened up a bit to play those.

Definitely watch it if a fan or new comer.  It's a good reminder of why music is so fun.

Thanks for reading",1384300800,5,1927,4.413105413105413
5963513,3,B00F1W1SS0,"The band is always generous in their DVDs production and here in Luna Park is no exception with more than 3 hours of music, a documentary, behind the scenes and a nice multi-angle feature of one song. First thing that strikes me when I put the Blu-Ray on was the crystal clear picture quality. The sound is also clear, but the mix could have been better for John Myung and Jordan Rudess instruments, who are buried in the mix. Let say that the camera don't focus very often on John Myung. The surround mix is mostly for ambiance and for the James Labrie's vocals.

The set list contains many songs from ""A Dramatic Turn of Events"", that is not one of my favorites CD of the band. Those songs have been spread out in the main feature with 2 hours and forty minutes and as a bonus of 6 more songs. Usually I don't enjoy a drum solo, even those of Neil Peart, but here, I found that Mangini did something that captivate me, go figure what it is! James Labrie's vocals are clear and strong and he was very generous and emotional on his compliments about Jordan and John Petrucci, when it was time to both of them to do their solos. Again John Myung was left out as it is in many bands, who want hear a bass solo?

I am pretty sure that plenty will enjoy this DVD, especially if you enjoy most of the Dream Theater's CDS, including the latest one, but to me, I think that the band is starting to repeat themselves. The similarity of some song structures in their latest CDs is too obvious that you could think that their best day are something from the past. However this is a good concert, the music is still better than many of that genre of progressive metal. Good, but not essential in your Dream Theater collection. 3.4 stars",1384300800,,1725,4.320987654320987

The video quality is simply top notch and the audio, provided you have a decent system to enjoy its awesomeness, it is crazy good. I can even hear John Myung and that's usually a non existent quality in many previous DT releases. Add a Buttkicker to your couch and be ready to get pounded by Mike Mangini!

5963518,5,B00F1W1SS0,"It's hard to add to what has been written already but I do want to point out my favorite feature.  I love playing with the camera angles on ""Outcry"" on the Bluray.  I can isolate on any of the band members or change to one of them when they are performing a segment that I particularly enjoy.  I haven't looked at the documentary yet so I can't comment on it.  I read one rating where someone said that the crowd seemed a small part of the show.  I agree and to some extent I like that.  While I do miss the 'electric' or pumped feeling, it does add tremendously to the quality of the sound of the show.  It looks to me like part of the cause of that is assigned seating?  Maybe that's by design.
EDIT:  I just noticed the comment about the drums sounding flat.  I have the show on Bluray and played through a lower to mid range 5.1 home theater and it sounds awesome to me.",1384214400,,874,4.088235294117647

5963520,2,B00F1W1SS0,"I love many of Dream Theater's live albums/DVDs. Live Scenes from a Memory is absolutely brilliant. Unfortunately, this performance (or combination thereof) pales in comparison to past efforts. The album starts out with my favourite song off of A Dramatic Turn of Events: Bridges in the Sky. The first thing I notice, 2:20 in, is that Jordan's grinding Hammond riff is nearly mixed out. This is unfortunate, as Jordan may well be the most talented member of the band, and he's certainly my favorite. Instead, all we get is John's guitar and Mike's drums. That's a running theme throughout the album: Jordan was nearly mixed out. James' vocals are not mixed out. This is also unfortunate, as his voice was pretty awful during these shows.

For Dream Theater fans wanting a great live experience, there are better options. Pick them up instead.",1384041600,5,842,4.929577464788732

I'll admit, it could have been better.  Not much on the low end and not as good as Budokan, but length of the footage makes up for it.  The bonus songs are also mixed in DTS-HD 5.1 and 2.0 which is nice.  I wish they had just mixed those songs into the main concert, but a minor gripe.  Video looks awesome.  It does bounce around a lot, but it's about impossible to find a concert that doesn't do that.  I would have easily paid another $5 for a better audio mix, but for the price, this is excellent.

5963522,4,B00F1W1SS0,"Live at Luna park includes the Blu-ray, 2 DVDs and 3 CDs in one release with the CDs only available in this deluxe edition.

This live concert is a 160 minute main show -- with bonus material. This concert set includes many of DT's classic tracks, including ""Metropolis Pt. 1"", ""The Silent Man"", ""Pull Me Under"", ""The Root Of All Evil"", ""The Test That Stumped Them All"", ""The Spirit Carries On"" and the ""On The Backs Of Angels"". The bonus material includes live versions of ""These Walls""; ""Build Me Up, Break Me Down""; ""Caught In A Web""; ""Wait For Sleep""; ""Far From Heaven""; and ""Pull Me Under"". Bonus features include a documentary, the trailer for the cinema release of the film, a ""behind-the-scenes"" feature and the cartoon intro that ran on big screens prior to the band taking to the stage in Buenos Aires. The Blu-ray additionally features six multi-angle options on ""Outcry"".

I will qualify my review by saying I am a big fan of the band and have been since Images and Words. Since then I have managed to get every release that has come out and even hunted down their first album prior to Labrie and even their Majesty stuff.

DT is one of the few bands that I have seen in concert that sound as good live if not better than their albums. They always bring a musical majesty to their concerts that leave you blown away and always add something new to their music when they play live. So anytime they put out a live DVD/CD, it is always worthwhile to get this and enjoy what they do when they transform their songs to live versions.

Live at Luna Park does a great job at bringing the concert to you on DVD and CD. For those that haven't had an opportunity to see them live, then this is the next best thing as this gives you a great selection of their music and shows off the musical prowess of each band member. For full effect, watch the DVD in full surround sound and you will almost feel like you are there live. Is this my favorite live album from DT, no, my favorite as far as live albums is probably ""Score"" or ""Budokan"" but this is a good live package and worth watching. DT fans like me will definitely enjoy the Blu Ray presentation.",1383955200,,2152,4.385964912280702

Having been a DT fan now for decades it is nice to see this terrific performance of new and old songs.  Lots of variety spanning the band's career, terrific renditions, and some really nice documentary coverage to boot.  The glimpse into DT's pre-show rituals and non-verbal communications during the show was great.  Even my daughter sat glued and said, ""Dad...this is great"" during the documentary and she loved jumping up and dancing around during the actual concert.

The band sounds tight, and is certainly one of the most talented around.

5963525,5,B00F1W1SS0,"I'll try to make this brief. A quick note on the show.......the boys are in their usual top notch form. But you probably suspected that to begin with and is why you are here.
Originally, I posted a 3 star review of this show. Like many, I found the mix substandard for a band of this caliber. John P was overpowering and Jordy and John M were sometimes almost inaudible with Mike's mix coming in on the weak side. My first impression was based on the fact that the night I first popped this into my Oppo BDP95 player, it was after 11:00 pm and wifey was in bed so I had to keep the volume on the down low. This evening I finally had a chance to watch this again, this time with the volume cranked considerably louder than before. All I can say is this concert disc rocks. The sound is soooooo much better turned up. So do as the title of this review suggests and TURN IT UP........that is, if your system can handle it!

BTW; just a side note. I noticed that John Petrucci produced the audio portion of this bluray so I have to think he listened to and approved the final version.",1383955200,,1080,4.1923076923076925
5963526,4,B00F1W1SS0,"I love Dream Theater and have been a long time fan. I did enjoy the concert however I don't think the mixing comes even close to the Live at Radio City Music Hall. The band is far better with Mangini than Portnoy, who used to rush thru a few parts of some songs and I have to say the back up vocals of Petrucci are so much smoother compared to Portnoy's. However, I think James LaBrie really needs to find a new style of singing for his voice. He could still it the high notes if he'd only try some cleaner vocals instead of yelling. The other 4 guys are just out of this world...I just wish Labrie would not try SO hard and relax, it would all sound much better.",1383868800,3,663,4.068702290076335
5963527,4,B00F1W1SS0,"As far as the music it is true Dream Theater and the sound was pretty amazing. I do think their latest CD album had much better and more balances sound. On the album the drum sound really stands out. I would have liked to have heard the drums and keyboard more in some songs. As far as the video I was disappointed somewhat. Producers seem to feel that to do a music video you need to jump all over the place from shot to shot. And they like to shoot from all over the auditorium. The reason I buy a DVD is to have the best seat in the house, the stage.
Who wants to watch from far away. Zooming and moving is frustrating. With Dream Theater you want to see the Musicians, and at times the guitar should have been highlighted and we see mostly the drummer or keyboard. If you would like to see the bass player, good luck because he is hardly ever shown. I would have liked to see more and longer shots of guitar and bass. This DVD really needed the ""angle"" feature. The DVD did get better nearer the end of the concert. I recommend the concert for the great music.",1383782400,,1064,4.144927536231884
5963528,4,B00F1W1SS0,"So Dream Theater's Luna Park concert film has finally arrived.

Mostly, it's as good as we all hoped. The band sounds great, and James LaBrie is absolutely on fire. Overall, the show is tighter if not more scripted than before - the band play to a click track while vocal harmonies are piped in to a poorly miming John Petrucci. Some will find this offensive, but really, it's for the best. Whereas James often sounded weak and thin as the sole singer on choruses of previous releases, here none of the songs feel incomplete compared to their studio components.

The main feature contains almost all of the songs from A Dramatic Turn of Events, while the rest of the ADTOE songs are included as bonus features. This makes Live at Luna Park a unique and worthy installment in a series of concert films from a band who already have so many, though I can't help but feeling like there was some missed opportunity, too. ""The Root of All Evil"", ""The Test That Stumped Them All"", ""War Inside My Head"", and other songs on one or more previous DVDs are present, while other songs which have never gotten good DVD treatment are left unplayed.

In what appears to be an anomaly, the Beunos Aires crowd is disappointing, and buried in the mix anyway. They can barely be heard, and they are not energetic, anyway.

In another dumbfounding move, the ""wealth of extras"" promised with the first delay has also not panned-out. There's a barebones documentary here, as well as some behind the scenes stuff, but really there isn't much here you wouldn't find on a typical concert film.

But overall, the main feature is what counts, and I'm happy to say that it's up there with Score and Budokan.",1383696000,5,1678,4.617449664429531
5963529,5,B00F1W1SS0,"Let's see... where to start?  I'm first going to rate the aspects of this show on Blu Ray, then I'll get into more details later.  The band's performances are 5*, the sound quality is 5*, the video quality is 5*, the video presentation is 3.5*.

First of all, if you are a DT fan, you already own this or have ordered it... enough said.  If you're new to DT or thinking about checking them out, this is by far in my opinion, the best place to start watching them on video.  The setlist for this Blu Ray is 26 songs, including every single song from Dramatic Turn.  It includes a very nice assortment of classics, spanning most of their albums and touching on both their harder and softer stuff alike.  My wife and I saw them on the Dramtic Tour of Events tour for four different shows in 2011-12, and loved every one of them.  Ok, on to more specifics for this show...

The band's performances are absolutely top-notch, in my opinion they do not look or sound better in any of their other recorded shows, including Budokan.  Major props to all DT members for being the amazing musicians that they are, their talent and performances are very moving and inspiring.  While my favorite all-time band is admittedly Rush, I will say that you cannot find better musicianship outside of Dream Theater ANYWHERE!  John Myung is his typical amazing self on bass... very quiet and unassuming, shying from the spotlight in spite of his ridiculous chops.  As always, he sees his part as supporting the rest of the band most of the time, and he does it flawlessly.  Jordan Rudess never fails to amaze on the keys, and his stand-alone ""piano"" solo will astound you with it's breathtaking beauty.  John Petrucci is an absolute BEAST on guitar as always, and shines especially bright in what has become my favorite guitar solo of his at the end of Breaking All Illusions.  If you haven't seen Mike Mangini on drums for DT yet, you're seriously missing out!  While I was a huge Mike Portnoy fan, I have become an even huger Mike Mangini fan.  His raw talent is unexplainably ridiculous (he is faster with a single hand than plenty of drummers are with both), but his love of his bandmates and sheer joy of playing with them is always apparent and an obvious blessing to the rest of the band after Portnoy's noisy departure 3 years ago.  It is apparent that while they lost a brother in Portnoy, they found a musical soulmate in Mangini and the chemistry is just amazing.  Finally last and NOT least, I must proclaim James LaBrie's vocals to be stronger and more powerful than ever.  His voice has gotten so much stronger over the years, he actually seems to have found the fountain of youth!

The sound quality of this Blu Ray recording is also top-notch.  It has crystal clear sound, with excellent high, mid and bass tones.  The microphones seem to have been placed and set near perfectly for all band members, as I feel that both vocals and instrumentation were covered flawlessly.  This seems to be a very hard thing to do, because so many rock (and especially metal) concerts have at least some instrumental distortion; and the vocalist often gets drowned out.  Not here though, James' singing is as I mentioned earlier, very strong, and the mic volume for him is higher than most vocalist's volumes would be which results in actually being able to hear him and understand many of his lyrics... GAH, who'da thunk???

The video (picture) quality is equally impressive.  It is 1080p on Blu Ray, and gives you very clear coverage, wherever the cameras chose to be.

Now for my single gripe on this presentation, and I admit that it is a matter of personal choice/opinion.  I feel that the director chose to move around too much for most of this concert, with too much camera switching.  Considering that the main setlist at Luna Park is two hours and forty minutes, I feel like more patience should have been exercised in choosing when to switch cameras, allowing the viewer to absorb a little more from a given camera angle before switching to another.  When cameras are switching as quickly as they were in much of this show, I feel a bit unrelaxed and nervous at times.  For reference, Rush's Time Machine 2011 tour on Blu Ray shows much better direction in this area as I felt the camerawork and editing for that show were top-notch.  However in the end, this shortcoming at Luna Park can be overlooked in light of how good all the other aspects are, and is not enough of a gripe to lower the overall 5* rating.

In closing, I am thrilled to finally own a copy of such an epic concert performance from a tour that my wife and I so thoroughly enjoyed in person.  DT does not disappoint here in the least, this should be owned by all fans of anything progressive or metal!",1383609600,46,4757,4.561837455830389

I can't compare to the DVD quality on sound and video but from what I just experienced it is one of my top favorite concerts on disc I've ever seen. The sound is very clear and some of the shots are just amazing!
The setlist will not disappoint you. There's a good mix of styles. If you're a fan of Dream Theater you should definitely have this in your collection. I even showed it to some friends that were not familiar with their work and they ended up loving it as much as I did!

There are three solos (guitar, piano and drums) and I had to rewind a couple of times for each one just to appreciate a little better the quality of the sound and the incredible skills of these musicians.

I think this one might be a little bit longer but for some reason I think it doesn't reach those heights. Both are amazing and if you can, definitely get them both. But if you're thinking about getting only one, the other one is probably a better option.

100% recommended!",1383609600,4,1252,4.845794392523365
5963531,5,B00F1W1SS0,"The band is in top form here. A lot of the songs are long and demanding utmost concentration but are brilliantly performed, making it very difficult to pick a highlight. The setlist btw is their most coherent and varied since Score. As all of you know by now, the boys are incredibly strong technically and all of them have terrific chemistry. I should also mention that they are also fantastic songwriters. This is by far the best DVD Dream Theater has ever put out. The sound and picture quality are stellar. It's almost on par with Opeth's Royal Albert Hall DVD in every notable category. It is a must buy for any rock or metal fan, even for those who are new to Dream Theater.",1383609600,,680,4.448

I'm a John Myung fan, but the cuts to him on the bass were infrequent, which was disappointing. But other than that, you have to love the virtuosity of these guys. Incredible musicians.
