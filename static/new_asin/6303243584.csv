Instead this looks more like a ornithology study of the birds visiting the etosha national park. If one sits with a handicam at a pond near one's home, he can catch many of the birds against insect interactions himself.

Not worth the price. Pure amateurish product this one.",1110326400,,363,4.584615384615384
