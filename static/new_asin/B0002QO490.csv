8030709,1,B0002QO490,"DVD is 45 minutes from a TV show or pilot. The ""action"" takes place in Houston, Texas where it is apparently legal to shoot at repo men as long as you are a lousy shot and don't kill one. In fact white cops will give a gun back to a black man. There is a very brief history of Repo, a plug to buy stock in the company, a bunch of people talking about the trade, and oh yeah, they do a few repos.

Uncensored because there is nothing to censor.",1419984000,,443,3.868131868131868
