8033412,5,B0002VS24S,"For families that want exceptional educational entertainment, NEST Learning offers the best on the market!  The quality of these products is amazing, from the animation to the historical accuracy of the stories.  The Animated Hero Classics, my family's favorite biographical video series, can be used as a teaching tool to supplement any elementary age curriculum.

The biographical sketches and historical information contained within the stories is conveyed in such a way that children not only retain the information, but they beg to watch them over and over!  In today's world of violence, fast action, and valueless entertainment, it is wonderful that parents have an option such as NEST.

As an added benefit, educators should be aware that these would be perfect supplements for elementary age students of any educational setting.  If you're studying the American Revolution, watch George Washington or William Bradford.  If you're studying the Civil War, watch the Abraham Lincoln or Harriet Tubman DVD. Integrate the DVDs into your studies.  They have DVDs available on dozens of subjects.
