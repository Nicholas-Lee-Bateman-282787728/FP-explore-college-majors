  Hope this information could be useful for the next buyer.",1290297600,5,175,4.733333333333333
3718941,4,B001NIN56Y,"Great price on an excellent collection that's very nicely (and appropriately!) packaged, but there's an apparent factory problem with the set. So far I've gotten two of these, both factory-sealed, and from different sellers, yet both containing a factory mis-labeled copy of the 2001 version of ""That's the Way It Is."" What the alleged 2001 version is, is actually a duplicate 1970 one. 9/10 of this purchase is great, but beware that you're not getting all 10 disks that the product info describes.",1238198400,14,499,5.024096385542169

8327137,1,B001NIN56Y,"I purchased this set as a birthday gift for a relative. The Viva Las Vegas and Jailhouse Rock DVD's are defective and do not work. We attempted to play them on three different DVD players (different manufacturers), and none of them work. There are no visible scratches or signs of wear on these DVD's, either. The other DVD's in this collection work fine. Unfortunately it is too late for a refund or replacement, so the best I can do is warn everyone else. DO NOT BUY THIS SET.",1489708800,,478,4.443181818181818
