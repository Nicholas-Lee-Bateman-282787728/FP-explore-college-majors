Porter, who was Prima Ballerina at the Royal Ballet in London (see Wikipedia article on her), went on to teach ballet, and what an amazingly good teacher she is, because she goes slowly and clearly, demonstrating each move before inviting you to join in with the exercise to the live piano in her studio.
I have taken a local ballet class once a week for several months, and realized that once a month is not enough to become strong enough to do even the barre work properly.  I felt like a (dopey) failure during every class. Since getting Balletcise for Beginners, I do B for B every day at home, and now perform much better in class.
Within only a few days of starting B for B, I was strong enough to do everything on the tape.  I now have great posture for the first time in my life, and am more toned and fit since my aerobics days in the '80s.  I am 62 years old and now feel 20 years younger.
I will be putting this on DVD soon, as I don't ever want to be without it.",1382486400,,1154,4.184684684684685

WHY WHY WHY isn't the Advanced  Balletcise available??",965692800,2,168,5.384615384615385
7904409,5,B000006HYY,"This is the first exercise video I actually found enjoyable to do--a pleasant, yet effective workout--minus all the annoying loud music and frenzied activity of most aerobic videos.  I took ballet as a child, but  it's not necessary to know any ballet to use this video.  Ms. Porter has a  very winning manner to her instruction--love the British accent.  I, too,  wish the Advanced Balletcise were available.  I've seen it--the beginning  is similar to the Beginner, but without all the explanations, then Ms.  Porter goes on to add difficulty to the basic exercises.",963187200,3,568,5.021505376344086
7904410,4,B000006HYY,"This *would* be better if the entire workout were available at the end without all the talk, but a FF button on the remote helps.  It's deceptively gentle; you realize *afterward* how hard you've been able to  work.
Why, why, WHY is the advanced version unavailable?  I also use  Melissa Lowe & love it, but it's a *much* tougher workout, and assumes  more familiarity with ballet in general - Porter's is more calming, and  very good for a ""recovery"" workout, or a first-time  exercise.
Also - with the fast-forward, you can get through this workout  in an easy half-hour, making it a real option for every day, if you have  that time.
It's also SO nice to have pretty music, not frenzied.  Which  is also true of M. Lowe - both use fine piano accompaniment, which is part  of what makes it so relaxing.",962064000,2,804,4.506944444444445
