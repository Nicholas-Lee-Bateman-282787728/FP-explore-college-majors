8413336,3,B0042AH2I2,"I was hoping there would be more on Katy Perry instead of two or three people talking about her that I didn't even know.  That is not my idea of a good DVD.  I love to watch Katy, but they had very little of Katy in the DVD.",1296604800,5,224,3.6458333333333335
8413337,1,B0042AH2I2,"This dvd went from the dvd packaging into my dvd player and then directly into the trash (cradle to the grave scenario)...this product should never have been released because it's of zero quality (btw, who the heck are the three twits being interviewed, they seem to have zero relevance to the artist whatsoever)...I took a chance on this knowing it's an unauthorized release, and I got burned big time! Buyer beware, this thing stinks!",1294790400,10,436,4.905405405405405
8413338,1,B0042AH2I2,"I don't know who the people are on this interview, even though they are labeled as ""entertainer"". The Narrator sounds like he is reading a book report that half of it is filler. The few times we see Katy Perry speaking was taken from random TV interviews or was taken from vlogs. Somebody was looking to make a quick buck with a DVD with Katy Perry on the cover.",1294185600,9,362,4.260869565217392
