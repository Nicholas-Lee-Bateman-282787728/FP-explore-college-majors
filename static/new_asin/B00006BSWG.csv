I thank you.",1502841600,,61,5.2
7966951,5,B00006BSWG,"This is a magnificent Trovatore.  Fedora Barbieri sings her music and it seem Shakesperian in its intensity.  Gencer is superb and one knows why she was so popular in Italy.  DelMonaco at his best, trumpeting high notes and ever diminuendoing effectively.  It's a great opera and if you consider the subject it's Verdi once more showing compassion for the down-trodden; gypsies!  Not so silly a libretto!  The Marx Brothers were showing their appreciation even as they paridied it.",1501113600,,481,5.102564102564102
7966952,5,B00006BSWG,"This is the best there is, period.  Why, first of all: THEY ARE ALL VERDIANS to the utmost degree.  Gencer may have been Turkish, but she sang the best Leonora ever--Callas excepted, and I am not comparing, just saying ther both reign supreme. I had no idea Del Monaco was matinee-idol handsome, and I had to chuckle as he channeled Nora Desmond with his rolling eyes.  Bastianini was wooden (they were dubbing, after all), but the real srprise for me was Barbieri.  Let me repeat: this is the best interpretation on DVD I have watched. I has allowed me a glimpse into an age when opera was taken seriouly, before the advent of Eurotrash.  On records, of course, gimme, Leontyne Price and Monserrat Caball.  Note: I forgot to mention an unexpected bonus.  The DVD does not have subtitles in Spanish, but French, English and Italian, so I chose to follow the latter.  Amazing! It was like having the libretto right in front of you.",1410566400,,930,4.628048780487805
7966953,2,B00006BSWG,"Directed (barely) by one Claudio Fino and mouthed to a prerecorded soundtrack, RAI's 1957 studio film of IL TROVATORE runs for a little over two hours, and its crude charms are sufficient only to carry it through a scene or two. As Plinio Clabassi, Leyla Gencer, Ettore Bastianini, Mario del Monaco, and Fedora Barbieri made their vocal appearances in that order, my first thought was that if an equivalent to one of these voices were to emerge today, it would be cause for great excitement. If equivalents to all five were to emerge, we would have entered a different age, and it is not something on which to pin one's hopes. On the other hand, important singers of the present day would never be embarrassed by a presentation such as this one.

I can well imagine another viewer watching and thinking, ""Oh, what a charming product of bygone days."" In fact, that was my reaction to a similar FALSTAFF (1956, directed by Herbert Graf and conducted by Tullio Serafin, on VAI DVD). The difference: the FALSTAFF is professionally and even artistically directed, far better conducted, and competently acted (in some cases much more), even by one of the same cast members (Barbieri). It is a shame that the FALSTAFF is the one that looks and sounds as though it were left out in the rain, and the TROVATORE is the decently preserved one. I went through three discrete stages: (1) In the opening scenes, grateful to have a visual document of these singers looking young and attractive and sounding great. (2) About 20 minutes in, fighting the urge to turn off the picture, then just giving in and taking the unintended laughs where they might come. (3) By the midpoint, impatient and a little bored.

In the final scene, when Manrico is listening to Azucena's worries about her impending execution, Del Monaco bites his fist while his eyes bulge and dart all over the cell maniacally. This single example is representative of the histrionics throughout: intentional parody would not have room to go much further. Not to be outdone by her leading man's deft enactment of thyroid crisis, Gencer spends most of her time simulating a ruptured ovarian cyst from beneath her troweled-on albino clownface, and the camera stays mercilessly close (the benefit: we are spared a longer view of the sets). Everyone has a single dramatic attitude. Manrico is FIERCE! Leonora is TORMENTED! Azucena is DERANGED! Luna actually comes off pretty well, in that Bastianini seems to be playing a real person who thinks about and reacts to things. In this company, he practically seems modern. But all of the singers have been abandoned to their own devices, and their training has not prepared them for it, and results are often uncomfortable. Then there is the lip-synching, which is poor, as it usually is in opera films of this vintage. If the singers were actually performing live on a stage, their hamming would have some conviction behind it. There would be the high-wire excitement of its being joined to their sound production, and they would also have a crowd off of which to feed. But the miming makes the gestures not only silly-looking and not well suited to the medium, but hollow.

The draw, of course, will be the singing. Clabassi is a Ferrando of the first rank, and deserves to be considered among the principals. Gencer (Turkish by birth, the one non-native) is in her vocal prime, both expressive and very well set up for Leonora technically -- I marveled, for example, at her precision in the cabaletta of the Leonora/Luna duet, at a very quick tempo. Leonora's rival suitors provide the expected reserves of lung power and testosterone, although they are more impressive for the exciting noise they make than for refinement or musicianship. Del Monaco, especially, is unwilling or unable to modulate his dynamics, so that even the tender sentiments of ""Ah si, ben mio"" come out in an emphatic bellow. ""Di quella pira"" is an example of good intentions defeated by imperfect technique. The tenor starts out articulating the semi-staccato semiquavers rather well, but the more of them there are, the sloppier he gets, as if he can't concentrate on note values and do the other things he has to do at the same time. Within a few measures, he's just neighing his way through them. Barbieri's other commercial Azucenas (the more solidly vocalized one under Cellini; the more musically thoroughgoing and dramatically shaded one for Karajan) were better than this one; but once past a shrill and unsupported ""Stride la vampa,"" and with charity given for an under-pitched high note or two thereafter, she settles in nicely -- an Azucena of distinction.

Conductor Fernando Previtali throws in a random eccentricity every so often (usually in the form of just hanging onto a note longer than we expect), but primarily elicits a quick, bouncy, rather insipid reading of what there is of the score. Expected cuts are in place (no ""Tu vedrai che amore"" for Leonora; a single verse of the remaining cabalettas), but it is probably to the good that the maestro does not take repeats, because he makes all of it sound like what we already have heard. This is startlingly unimaginative, two-speed conducting; Verdi in a vacuum.

An audio recording of the soundtrack probably would be easy enough to find, and the connoisseur who goes that route will be spared much besides the unconvincing post-synchronization and silent-movie emoting: the scenic look is cheap and flimsy overall (in Act II Scene 2, Luna and his men pick their way through mismatched trees, bushes, and shrubbery -- the ""whatever you can get your hands on by 5:00"" school of set decoration); supers/choristers break character in seeming apathy; blocking is often palm-to-the-face stuff. Of the last, two of the worst examples are in the convent scene: Del Monaco running right at the camera while looking insane; at scene's end, belatedly and for no good reason, nuns and retainers surrounding the principals in the manner of children watching a schoolyard brawl.

The performance is worth acquiring in some format for its Leonora most of all, because Gencer did not make major-label recordings and so it is always a treat to find her in a complete performance of a great part. Good sound for the period (as here) is a bonus. For the most part, though, this is the kind of artifact that gives IL TROVATORE a bad name. It makes the music seem trite and the drama stupid, and neither should be the case. Of documentary interest only, and cause for anti-nostalgia as much as nostalgia.",1285891200,7,6528,4.876576576576577
7966954,5,B00006BSWG,"When Italy began broadcast television in the late 1950's, it was natural that producers would turn to opera. This is one of several titles now available on DVD (others include Lucia di Lammermoor and Don Pasquale). It's in black and white. The picture is grainy. The sets and costumes look artificial. The lip-synching is poor. Even the subtitles are full of misspellings. But for me, it's five stars anyway because the four leads give five star performances. To heck with the rest!

Leyla Gencer brings out the lyric beauty of the arias composed by Verdi for Leonora. She sings them at a slower pace than usual, but that only showcases the elegance of an aria such as ""Tacea la notte."" She then takes the quick-paced cabaletta that follows and performs it in a light and dreamy mood as opposed to the usual desperate rush we're used to. Truly unique.

In Act IV, the ethereal quality that she brings to ""D'amor sull'ali rosee,"" makes her heartbreak just that much sadder for us watch. It's one of the most beautiful renditions of the aria that I've heard; the way she floats those high notes is just stunning. It's only in the ""Miserere"" that her desperation begins to show, making it understandable why she would poison herself.

Mario Del Monaco's deep tenor voice is stronger and louder than we're used to modernly. Combine the sheer power of his voice with his old-fashioned dashing and heroic interpretation of Manrico, and it's a performance to treasure. I love how he savors every note of the tender and slow ""Ah! si, ben mio"" instead of rushing through it to get to famous battle cry, ""Di quella pira.""

Fedora Barbieri has a powerful mezzo voice with great range from low to high. But along with its power, her voice possesses a beautiful flow that is associated more often with sopranos. She moves flawlessly from crazed to loving mother. I'd heard her Azucena on CD (it's one of her signature roles), so it's a great treat to see her on DVD.

Ettore Bastianni has a beautiful burnished baritone voice - almost a bass baritone - yet he is at home in the higher notes too. He emphasizes the human side of Di Luna, managing to make him a sympathetic character. This is helped by his superb rendition of ""Il balen."" His success in drawing our sympathy in this aria is due in large part to the pure beauty of his voice.

Take these four superb solo voices, put them together in Verdi's ensemble piece, and the resulting duets and trios are riveting. The Manrico, Leonora, Di Luna trios that end Acts I and II really rock. (Sorry, but I think of them as rock and roll trios because of their driving rhythms; I can hardly sit still through them.) The Act IV duet between Leonora and Di Luna builds to a lightening-fast pace, their voices blending beautifully as her desperation turns to a kind of otherworldly ecstasy as she believes that, by sacrificing her own life, she has saved Manrico. It's thrilling to watch. The icing on the cake is the short Manrico, Leonora, Azucena trio just before the opera ends. The soprano Gencer takes the low note, the mezzo Barbieri takes the high note, the tenor takes the middle, and we are transported musically to that heightened place to which only opera can take us.

If you love Il Trovatore as I do, don't miss this DVD.",1191715200,19,3269,4.625862068965517
7966955,5,B00006BSWG,"I just finished watching a video of Trovatore from 1957 that has me

wondering why it's been so long since I've watched it.  I believe this is a

television production using the RAI Milan forces (there are almost no

production notes whatsoever).  Despite the grainy black and white picture,

boxy audio (which peaks out at crescendos, varies wildly at times and can

really become constricted during large ensembles), painted clouds, sets that

range from starkly stagey yet realistic to ""huh?"", lip-synching that for

most of the film is so good it looks as though the singers are really

singing then degenerates into hit 'n miss, and some nasty cuts, the

performances are simply astonishing.  I hadn't planned on watching the

entire thing, but once in the video machine I was along for the ride.

Leyla Gencer absolutely amazes me.  If this woman were singing today she

would be having productions of whatever she wanted, wherever she wanted and

cast with whomever she wanted.  Verdian style, ease of vocal production, ear

ravishing mezzo voces and spot on high notes attacked with precision and

clarity that had me doing something I hate to do - rewind whole sections and

play them over and over again - so much so that the 2 hour video took me

closer to 3 hours to watch.  In ""Tacea la notte .."" she throws in this soft,

high Db that may be one of the most beautifully produced single notes I've

ever heard.

(Note:  I have to say, right here, that listening to Gencer today I was

struck for the very first time at how similar a sound she shares with (drum

roll, please) Renee Fleming.  I'd never noticed before, but the weights of

both of their voices are very similar, they have similar sounding ""chest""

(Gencer seemed to sing almost all of ""Tu vedrai"" in chest voice - which blew

my mind!) - and just the sheer sound of their voices has an uncanny

similarity.  I'd never once thought of Fleming as a Leonore, but now I'm

wondering ... )

Mario Del Monaco is thrilling both in sound and looks, his acting right on

the mark for Manrico.  His high note (C?) at the end of ""Di Geloso amor"" is

not nice and sounds like it's tagged on, and maybe not even his (though I

doubt that).  All of his other high notes are definitely THERE and I was

particularly affected by his ensemble work (who said he always had to show

off?  He's definitely a team player in this show).  The ""Pira"" (down a tone)

has all the ping one could want.  He's just terrific.  (Okay, admittedly, in

Act IV Mario definitely goes over the top, all flashing dramatic eyes and

Bela Lugosi poses, but I don't think these are out of place because they

seem to come genuinely from him.)

Although not one of my absolute favorite singers, Ettore Bastianini is

commanding, and in excellent voice as DiLuna and a great foil to Del

Monaco's Manrico.

Plinio Clabassi opens the film with a fairly rousing ""Abbietta zingara"" and

the men's chorus act and sing nobly.

There are touches of humour in the direction (notably in the Anvil Chorus)

both intentional and seemingly unintentional (a gypsy who's mock anvil

striking can't help but provoke a grin).

Fedora Barbieri (the most unfortunate victim of the wardrobe mistress),

despite her protestations in a recent Opera News article, uses chest voice

and does so splendidly (I think she likes to call it something else, but

it's chest to me).  But her Azucena has so much beauty throughout. One of

her most beautiful moments comes in that little trio toward the end:  Gencer

sustaining a lower note, Del Monaco ""buffing"" the middle and Barbieri enters

ravishingly, on a higher sustained note returning to her ""Ai nostri monti.""

It is the magic of Verdi right there and it is the magic of singers who know

what to do with this ravishing stuff.

Any director worth his salt should look at this and realize that ""concept""

is irrelevant, unnecessary and can stand directly in the way of telling a

story.  The power of the music and singers who know how to react to it and

eachother, are more than enough.  The drama came through in spades here,

despite the deficiencies of great visuals or expertly engineered sound.

Many moments I jumped up to my feet, cheering at the screen.  The ending,

for once, felt as brutal and stomach churning as Verdi must have intended it

to.  Oh, to experience a Trovatore like this in a house just once!",1125446400,48,4389,4.615384615384615
