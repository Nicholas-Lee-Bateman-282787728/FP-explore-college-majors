8225026,4,B000WPNHCG,Came in quick and really enjoyed it. Its not a workout video like I hoped but its a instructional about stances and submission as well as jabs and hooks. Very cool and good to know how to actually swing or kick,1502928000,,210,4.146341463414634

8225028,4,B000WPNHCG,This is not a work dvd but you will sweat it teaches you fighting moves . I learnd how to do trangle choke arm barr and more sure you have to do and learn more for the cage but if your an average Joe its great for a street fight or if your bouncer or if your getting bullied i debt like fighting but Im not going to let someone hurt me or my love one nether should you. if you can't afford an mma gym or boxing this is the next best thing. thanks john and the pit crew make more.,1382140800,,479,3.7058823529411766

8225030,3,B000WPNHCG,"This is Chuck Liddells whole game plan, not bad for beginners.  Also Hacklemans jokes actually are funny.  Good for someone who just wants to know a bit and not overwealmed with too much.",1266451200,,187,4.636363636363637
8225031,1,B000WPNHCG,"First thing's first, if you're buying these DVDs because you're a Chuck Liddel fan, HE'S NOT IN IT!
Secondly, these drills are a joke, if you've ever actaully trained in an MMA, Muay Thai, Boxing, or BJJ gym these workouts are complete nonsense.
They're poorly paced, there is no discussion of technique at all and if you're used to a real fight gym the intensity level here will put you to sleep.
Even if you aren't really training there are better resources, I would recommend Bas Rutten's set of CD's, they're well paced, well produced, and you can load them into an ipod or boombox anywhere you need them.",1244332800,2,609,4.5963302752293576
8225032,3,B000WPNHCG,"This video was OK.  They showed a bunch of techniques but nothing out of the ordinary.  If you have trained anywhere for about 6 months, then you know all of these.

Buy it if you just want a Chuck Liddell video, which is what I wanted.  They spent plenty of time promoting stuff like the gloves and pads.  You could tell a few times that they don't actually use that equipment.  They were just throwing it in for the money.",1221955200,,424,4.2375
