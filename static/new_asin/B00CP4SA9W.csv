5731686,4,B00CP4SA9W,"Blue Dream is an enjoyable, eye-opening journey if one never forgets the second word of the title.  It is, first and foremost, director/writer Gregory Hatanakas vision of what has happened over the past 20 years to the media business, and perhaps more broadly to the American workplace, the economy, and our society as a whole.  The decline appears to all to be inevitable, so the characters for the most part choose to take advantage of the loosening of societal strictures to enjoy the descent as much as possible.

Dont expect a linear storyline, or a sequence of events which follow logically from their predecessors.  Blue Dream is indeed a dream, and like most dreams, the plot jumps around, sometimes abruptly.  Some scenes appear inserted purely to convey a mood or arouse feelings.  The plot is not entirely the point, although it is generally possible to determine what is happening.  Certain characters speak entirely in parables;  others at times do or say crazy things;  some characters may be entirely figments of the imagination of the main character.  Anyone who watches Blue Dream expecting it to be as close to real life as an episode of The Office is going to be severely disappointed.  Again, don't forget the second word of the title.

Ultimately it is an exercise for the viewer to decide how broadly to apply Hatanakas vision.  Could Blue Dream only happen to people who work in an industry in inevitable decline (the print newspaper business) in a city like Los Angeles, with its Hollywood morals and vices?  Or is Hatanaka speaking to a broader segment of the American economy and society?  Watch Blue Dream and see what conclusions you reach...",1384732800,8,1670,4.893238434163701
