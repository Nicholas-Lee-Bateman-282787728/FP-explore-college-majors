269510,3,630024752X,"It was nice to see such a serious and great actor in a father mode. Although it is not one of his best movies, I found it refreshing and enjoyable to view. The childrens attitudes were laughable and entertaining.  Tuesday weld leaves much to be desired though. She came off as somewhat  stale and monitone. I think pacino was a bit uncomfortable at times working  with the kids but he managed to pull off a realistic attitude with the  pressures of fatherhood. He should attempt another lighthearted movie such  as this.",940636800,,520,4.670329670329671

269672,5,630024752X,"This is probably going to become one of my favorite movies.  There is an explosive chemistry for me among four elements:

The on-location filming in New York City that made it a rich, vibrant character.

Al Pacino's character, a father of young children.  The warmth, tenderness, and naturalness of his relationship with all 5 children did more than make me feel warm and fuzzy; it hit me like a blast furnace and put a fire in my belly.  I've always been stoked to a gentle purr by Pacino's beautiful face, grace, intensity, etc.  But seeing him as a loving father made me swoon.  Plus, I enjoyed seeing him play this character with a sensitivity, subtlety and nuance that well becomes him.

Seeing Al Pacino walking in his natural element : the streets of New York City. Maybe you have to be a native New Yorker to have that resonate the way it did with me.

And last but not least, that townhouse in the Village.  Maybe you have to be a native New Yorker to be in awe of the fireplace, the beautiful antique chandeliers, the garden in the backyard.  I think that put final puff of smoke in my pipedream: nesting with the strong, loving, warm, effectionate grown-up man Trevelian with his five delightful children in a townhouse in the Village.",1449100800,7,1246,4.5675675675675675

In the video version, Pacino and the kids are at home instead of on the street. I won't say more than that, but the 'sweetness' of the ending is missing.

As Armenian playwright Ivan Travalian (Pacino) is left with a houseful of lovable kids whose fathers don't want them. His play has ""trouble with the second act"". The delicious actress Alice Detroit (Dyan Cannon) moves in with Travalian, then moves out when she realizes she can't handle ""kids all the time"". The all star cast includes Alan King in a hysterical turn as producer ""Kreplich"", with Bob Elliot as the all suffering ""new"" director, Morris Finestein. Radio's Bob Elliot and Ray Goulding play the financiers of Travalian's new play, and all hell breaks loose as Travalian struggles to rewrite ""the secondact"", raise his son, step sons and step daughters.

Well, for some reason that only Fox executives can understand, they cut the final scene from the film - even though it was really funny, heartwarming and a perfect ending for the story.

269960,3,630024752X,"Lesser known Pacino film, but fun to watch again. The video quality is superb, especially those who have widescreens at home. There are two options on audio, Stereo and mono. I started watching it in Stereo on my Dolby digital system, but found that I had to switch to mono. The stereo sounded a bit synthetic, unnatural.

My biggest problem here was the ""missing"" final scene. At first I thought my DVD was malfunctioning, only to discover that Fox must have re-edited it for some reason that only they can understand. It was badly done, too. For those familiar with the film, on the part where Pacino says to his youngest son- ""It means Heraldo gets his snake""- Pacino's mouth isn't even moving. The frame is frozen and the credits roll. Then, on the music overdub you can actually hear (if you listen closely) the sounds of kids laughter on the last scene that they cut, suggesting that something was missing. Again, those not familiar with the film won't notice. But, to those of us who are familiar with it, it's rather annoying and disappointing.

WHAT'S THE REASON? My guess is marketing. At some future release, they'll come out with a DVD with the final scene in tact, as well as the kid's interviews on some sort of ""Where are they now"" feature. This way, fox will get everyone to buy the DVD again and make profit once again on the film. Just look at how many different versions George Lucas has on ""Star Wars.""

269962,4,630024752X,"There are two good things to be said of Arthur Hiller's Author! Author!
(at the Plaza): Tuesday Weld and Dyan Cannon. The former plays Al
Pacino's wife, the latter his mistress. Both are actresses of
distinction. Both look terrific. Both should be reminded that this too
shall pass.

As Broadway playwright Ivan Travalian, an Armenian Neil Simon, Al
Pacino is another matter. Pacino is an actor of distinction, but he
does not look terrific - he looks, in fact, unaccountably dissipated,
like mid- period Leonard Cohen - and he has retained the leaden
lifelessness he brought to Cruising. Because Israel Horovitz's
abominable script was apparently conceived with Richard Dreyfuss in
mind (Ivan Travalian is a twinkly, manic shouter), Pacino's
lugubriousness sabotages whatever infinitesimal chance the movie might
have had for success (it's not what you'd call a great loss).

The much-married Ivan is rearing, $ la Dustin Hoffman's Ted Kramer,
five children abandoned by Ivan's various wives. He is a loving father
and is so devotedly altrustic he is lacking an artist's ego - the
reason this mother hen wants the newest play to become a hit is so
there will be enough money to feed the chicks.

The brood is composed of the most appalling set of exhibitionistic
child actors this side of Eight Is Enough; the delicately modulated
characterizations achieved from the young performers in E.T. and
Poltergeist by Steven Spielberg appear to be the products of another
species.

That this comedy is not funny is bad enough; that it is resolutely and
maliciously anti-female is unforgivable. Miss Weld's witless wife is
so self-absorbed the audience actually applauds when Pacino tells her
to stay out of the ocean and ""give the sharks a break,"" while Miss
Cannon's Broadway actress is so selfish she can't stand more than a
week with the playwright's kiddies. (I know why: as a performer of
sensitivity, she is tortured by the bad acting in the house.) Kramer
vs. Kramer's mild sentimentality about single fathers has become a
full-blown disease in Author! Author!: Israel Horovitz hasn't written a
character; he's put Mother Teresa into a townhouse. Benjamin Miller,

Having to deal with a cheating wife, and still write a play. It showed the love that a father has in these kids. Mind you only one is his. The other 4 are his by marriage and he loves them as if they were his own. But to take out the one scene that was fun and touching is stupid. What is wrong with the kids showing there father that, not only is he a success on Braodway but that he is still their Dad. I loved that scene and hoped that when it was released on DVD it would be there. But NO! They took it out and stopped it when he is reading the paper. They really need think.

Pacino channels a little Woody Allen as Armenian playwright Ivan Travalian (at one point he quips ""you can always tell an Armenian; their last name rhymes with Armenian"") with a mid-life crisis, a failing marriage, a new play to finish, and a stable full of kids (mostly from his soon-to-be-ex-wife's previous couplings) all with their own distinct personalities and issues. It makes a pretty nice comedy-drama jambalaya that doesn't hit any high marks, but is entertaining nonetheless. Look for delightful cameo roles by Bob and Ray as brothers investing in Travalian's play. Also worth noting is a young Eric Gurry who plays Pacino's oldest son and sometimes his father's caretaker. Apparently Gurry left films to become involved in the venture capital industry but this film shows he had some promise as an actor.",1139788800,4,966,5.081761006289308
270083,3,630024752X,"This is a sweet, heart-strong film, and features a terrific performance from Al Pacino. Made a couple years after Kramer Vs. Kramer, it is similar in placing a loving father in the predicament of fighting for their children when his wife decides to leave them. Though this isn't about divorce, rather about the charm, pleasure and pressure of parenthood and a professional life.

Pacino and the kids are the best part, while the two women, his wife Gloria-mother to four of the five kids, sired by three different men, prior to Pacino's Ivan, and Alice Detroit-famous actress starring in his new Broadway play, have flimsier, partial characters to work with. Particularly Gloria, played by Tuesday Weld, is a heartless and troubled woman, but the film expresses her need to abandon men and children as her just ""being who she is."" This statement is made after Ivan tracks her down to bring her home to her kids, who could use a mother, during a good scene where it is brought home just who she is and what she is capable of. Still, it certifies her as a villain of less-than-justified-motivation. Alice Detroit, played by Dyan Cannon, is sweet and nice, swiftly starting an affair with Ivan, then just as swiftly moving in with him and the kids, but her part is ancillary too. The kids, particularly Igor, Ivan's only natural child, and Geraldo, the one kid who stays with him when the others return to their blood fathers, are terrific. The films scene with Ivan and the two boys is at it's best. Ivan is an orphan and his desire to raise and care for the kids is beautiful, an aspect of Pacino's character that hasn't been seen in a while.

Written by playwright Israel Horovitz, this is a good theatre-themed film too. As a writer struggling domestically and professionally it is fun and believable.

The music seemed oddly similar to ""Tootsie"" too. Anyway...

It seems like Pacino doesn't do this kind of work anymore. Like DeNiro in Stanley & Iris and Falling in Love, Gene Hackman in Twice in a Lifetime, Dustin Hoffman in Kramer Vs. Kramer, etc. The middle class/working class domestic drama/comedy. He is truly excellent in the part, which is low-key, true and sweet.",1139184000,5,2175,4.7612732095490715

The movie bounces along nicely enough and as long as one doesn't probe too deeply beneath the surface it's pretty entertaining. It's typical of a ""kind"" of picture that seemed in vogue during the early 80s, which depicted the breakup of the family as adult characters tried to pursue their work and ""find"" themselves at the same time.

270086,4,630024752X,"Author! Author! is a guilty pleasure. It features Pacino in one of his rare forays into comedy (the other being the underrated and little-seen '70s gem, Scarecrow) as a beleaguered New York City playwright who has to juggle a houseload of kids, a wife who is cheating on him and a play that he is struggling to get off the ground.
This is a sweet, endearing film that isn't too sappy as to give you diabetes. Pacino really keeps everything grounded and delivers a wonderfully understated performance. He lets all the kids ham it up and deliver the best lines, especially, as one reviewer pointed out, the youngest one who is a really good little actor. What happened to that kid? And you've got veteran thesps like Tuesday Weld, Dyan Cannon, and my personal fave, Alan King, who doesn't do enough films, IMO.
This is one of those comfort movies that you end up turning on partway through on TV and then watch all the way to the end. There is just something about it that is so fascinating to watch. Maybe because it was so reviled by critics and ignored by audiences that it now languishes in Cable TV limbo awaiting a possible DVD release... some day?
This film is also a great snapshot of NYC circa the late '70s early '80s. The film uses its locations so well and anyone who has lived there (or still lives there) will instantly recognize certain places and areas. It's almost like stepping into a time machine to a New York that doesn't exist anymore.
Watching this movie makes me wish that Pacino would do more comedies but sadly, he has a rep for doing intense dramas and is probably only offered these kinds of films anymore.",1071100800,20,1632,4.535593220338983

Obviously this woman read Moll Flanders, or something. . . she  deposits variously fathered children with Al like he's the bank.
Al is a Broadway playwrite, living in my favorite city, New York. He's a vegetarian, looks lovingly after his 5 or so kids, while trying to write a play, get over his awful, awful wife and have a relationship with Dyan Canon. Read: He's stressed!

270088,4,630024752X,"Al Pacino is such a heavy weight actor and most of his movies are heavy weight movies.  Well, this is just a light hearted comedy, with very little swearing (except by the kids!).  Aren't Al's movies usually heavily into swearing?? Anyway, HE provides a home and family that all these kids (only one of them is his) want to stay in, when their mother runs off with yet another man.  Meanwhile, his new play is about to open. He has an affair with the leading lady.  The kids have to go leave and live with fathers that don't want them.  One by one, the kids make their way back to his home.  He tucks them in and tells them,""As long as I gotta home...you gotta home.""  His play is a success and these cool kids help him celebrate. These child actors really ARE cool, too.  Tuesday Weld looks great, but Dyan Cannon is stunning.  Alan King is a great New Yorker.  You'll enjoy it.",1023321600,3,879,4.304878048780488

7806978,5,630024752X,"This is the overlooked Al Pacino movie.  It's great, it's old, it's funny, and of course Pacino is magnificent.  Probably his most overlooked movie.  Enjoy.",1479427200,,156,5.16
7806979,3,630024752X,".Except for the Adam Sandler Jack And Jill a few years ago.  Where he kind of made fun of his own character.  Did Al Pacino ever do a comedy.  It is surprising how good this movie is.  He plays a playwright who basically cant get a break.  Professionally or personally.  The three leads Pacino, Tuesday Weld and Dyan Keaton are all terrific.  Tuesday Weld back in the day was one of my favorite actresses.  She is rather unlikeable in this.  And right off the top of my head I don't know the names of the characters or the real names of the kids without looking them up.  But they are all well played also.  Especially the one who ""inherited his tremendous nose.  And the spanish saxaphone player.  This is truely a hidden gem.",1475539200,,727,4.37593984962406
