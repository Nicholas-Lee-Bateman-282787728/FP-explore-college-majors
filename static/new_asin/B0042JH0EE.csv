4251117,3,B0042JH0EE,"Ever since Phil's first solo album it was clear that he had been heavily influenced by Motown and Soul music.  That and Phil's enormous stage presence were reasons why I was so excited to own this concert on Blu-Ray.

Perhaps I had my expectations too high.

Phil's stage presence was not even close to his best and his performance was remarkably sub-par.

The band backing him up were very talented but Phil's renditions of these classic Soul and Motown tunes did nothing to improve upon them.

It was almost as though Phil never rehearsed the set, as though he phoned in his performance.  Ever see ""Live Karaoke?""  It's just like Karaoke but with a live band backing you up instead of music tracks.  That's what this reminded me of.

I am a HUGE music lover with a great appreciation for Genesis and Phil Collins but this purchase will sit on the shelf and gather dust after my initial purchase.

I own over 150 Concert Videos and rate them honestly, even if I am fans of the artists.",1296345600,33,986,4.519774011299435
4251118,2,B0042JH0EE,"I really looked forward to this video. I loved Phil's foray into Big Band jazz some years ago. The band is great, and the arrangements are in most cases as good or better than the originals. But...there are two problems.

First, the sound mix is very much the same as you might find on a CD. It doesn't sound like a live show at all. Instruments, and Phil's vocal track, are all isolated so clearly there is no evidence by listening to it without watching that it even is a live show. I like live show recordings because they have an energy and immediacy to them that studio recordings usually lack. This one has that mostly squeezed out of it.

And second...Phil is a great singer, for many styles of music. Most of the tunes he chose for this...not so much. I read he has had some physical problems, neck and spine, which are keeping him from playing drums and piano. This is somewhat evident in how he appeared to lurch around the stage, stiffly. I think it also affected his singing. Ballad singing was mainly OK, but he just simply lacked ""soul."" I love this music and am about Phil's age. I know how he must feel about doing these tunes justice. For one reason or another, I just don't feel he did. If you are a diehard Phil Collins fan and you need the complete set of all his performances, this is for you. Otherwise, you may want to avoid it. I hate to say that - I think he's a great musician and performer. He just struck out on this one.",1295654400,,1449,4.2846715328467155
4251119,3,B0042JH0EE,"I have been listening to Phil Collins from the time he was the drummer for Brand X playing jazz rock fusion and released some really Good Albums over the years and one was Morrocan Roll also saw him Live with Genesis back in the 80's and again playing with Eric Clapton so had to get a copy of Going Back Live At Roseland Ballroom NYC 2010, a Well Recorded Blu Ray with a Good Picture & Sound and Talented Musicians but was disappointed with the live performance & was expecting a better show with more guitar bass drums and so on ... This Live concert is more like a motown top 10 o pop hits playing & singing 26 songs :Intro Signed Sealed , Delivered (I'M Yours) , Ain't Too Proud To Beg , Girl (Why You Wanna Make Me Blue) , Dancing in the Street , (Love is Like A)Heatwave , Papa was a Rollin' Stone , Never Dreamed You'd Leave in Summer , Jimmy Mack , You've Been Cheatin' , Do I Love You , Loving You is Sweeter Than Never , Going To A Go-Go , Blame it on The Sun , Ain't That Peculiar , Too Many Fish in The Sea ,  You've Really Got a Hold on Me ,  Something About You , The Tears of a Clown , Nowhere to Run ,  In My Lonely Room ,  Take Me in Your Arms Rock Me A Little While , UIptight (Everything is Alright) ,  Going Back , Talking About My Baby , You Can't Hurry Love and My Girl ... so if you're a Fan & into motown hits theres a good chance You'd like this Blu Ray concert in spite of the average performance  .",1294444800,10,1425,3.879725085910653

4251125,5,B0042JH0EE,"Filmed in June 2010 at New York's famous Roseland Ballroom, this concert blu-ray captures Phil Collins taking his new album ""Going Back"" into the live arena.  Backed by an 18-piece band, Phil Collins covers the soul and Motown classics that he loved as a teenager.  This is not a concert of Phil Collins songs - he describes this production as  ""a Phil Collins blu-ray with nothing but Motown and Soul music on it"".

'Going Back - Live at the Roseland Ballroom' is a real chance to get up close and personal with Phil Collins as he covers the greats including  Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and William 'Smokey' Robinson.

In September 2010, Phil released the audio CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Going-Back/dp/B003HC8I5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Going Back</a>&nbsp;to complement this concert that took place in June 2010.

Running Time: 126 minutes

Phil Collins really put his heart and soul in his rendition of ""Too Many Fish in the Sea"".

""Papa Was a Rollin' Stone"" and ""The Tears of a Clown"" brought out the best in the 'The Funk Brothers' and the rest of Phil Collins' band, including members from his old pop group Genesis.

I may be putting myself on a limb here, but Phil's lighter take on ""The Tears of a Clown"" is as good as William 'Smokey' Robinson himself!  Funk Brothers', Bob Babbitt plays the bass line here.  Babbit in fact, wrote and played the bass line for 'Smokey' Robinson 1967 original recording of ""The Tears of a Clown""!  So, crank up the volume and enjoy this Motown hit which Phil Collins describes as having 'one of the most fantastic bass lines in a pop song'.

""Papa was a Rollin' Stone"" can only be seen as a great tribute to the songwriters Barrett Strong (rest his soul) and Norman Withfield.

""Uptight (Everything's Alright)"" - will have you dancing your blues away!

With the last track ""My Girl"", the Roseland Ballroom turned into one big karaoke party, as Phil had everyone on their feet and singing.  You'll be doing the same long after the credits are posted!

4.5 stars as 'a cover of soul and Motown Music'.  Phil's 'blue-eyed soul' voice is too soft for some of the tracks.

5 Stars as 'A PHIL COLLINS BLU-RAY with nothing but Motown and Soul music on it'!

There is ""Papa Was a Rolling Song""  and  each section of the orchestra repeats the beat before he starts the song.  He takes some of the MOTOWN Greats and adds his own touch with an orchestra,, Heatwave, Jimmy Mack, Going to a Go Go! and Take Me In Your Arms are just a few of the classics that are on this DVD.  All the songs are great and I love listening to it. The orchestra adds a special touch and makes the difference!

4251137,5,B0042JH0EE,"What a tribute this journeyman's appreciation of the contribution by those who came before him.  Phil Collins could certainly stand tall on the body of work he has accumulated over his time in music.  This DVD adds to that height through his tribute to the Motown sound and with this production, a high fidelity not only to the sounds but the nuances as well.  Outstanding work and thank you Phil.",1396656000,,397,4.642857142857143
4251138,5,B0042JH0EE,I had never heard Phil Collins sing Soul songs from Detroit.  He did a great job and I enjoy seeing him perform in the Roseland Ballroom.,1394409600,,137,4.269230769230769

4251140,1,B0042JH0EE,"Phil tried to carry it all as the only lead singer and that was a mistake. He is not a soul singer and it shows. The backup singers and instrumentation was good accompaniment to a performance that fell flat, song-after-song. It was a good idea that did not work.

4251143,5,B0042JH0EE,High quality sound and video.  Great songs and worth every penny.  A great way to get Motown sound recorded in today's quality.  A fascinating 1 hour story can be seen about the production of this on one of the cable channels.,1377216000,,226,4.463414634146342
4251144,4,B0042JH0EE,"Even though Collins appears to provide a perfunctory performance, it offers enough variety to keep the interest of the viewer. Most songs are continuous , without a lot of unnecessary introduction, which is desirable.",1371686400,,217,5.411764705882353
4251145,5,B0042JH0EE,"How you view the making and production of this album/dvd is really a matter of perspectives AND biases.
When I first started listening,I was biased, so I missed a lot of the nuances and chemistry. I was born and raised in Detroit ( not the suburbs either I mean 1 mile from Chrysler's  Jefferson assembly plant ) and having heard the originals my whole life, I have become accustomed to AND spoiled by ( does anyone really have anything close to or as generation defining stuff as Motown and the music? ) such masters as matter of the fact, the par normal. So I let my biases color what I heard, but soon it was obvious there was a lot of effort put into making this production. From the long deserved admission you can't do it with out the ""funk brothers"" to the 60's Motown girls on the stage singing along, Phil knew you can't replace or better the sound, it was an era a generation and like wine, much different now than then. Phil did a great job to keep the idea of the song intact( people these songs are #1 chart topping song!!! The same people that want him to change the vibe are the same IDIOTS that mag wheels on a Honda civic, and you know who they are!!) and instead add to it a certain flavor. He tries to maintain and add to rather than redesign it over( Was the wheel a good invention? Why replace it then?). IF you can listen and understand that these songs were written by blacks that couldn't even use the same toilets as whites ( I mean how do you reproduce that kind of ignorance that leads to dumb !@%^^Y* like that?) and still they overcome to produce the most soul stirring sounds on vinyl!!! These are the sounds Phil was reproducing, and does a great job with it, a little Phil and a little Motown, a whole lot of a different era... makes for one my favorite remakes. Oh by the way I can't stand him as a singer, but I like this one by him, his best by far, for what he DOESN'T do!!!!!

4251146,1,B0042JH0EE,"May I have the attention of you pinheads who produce & direct concert DVDs, some of us don't have ADHD, and would appreciate a concert that isn't directed by a 8-year old who can't leave the camera switcher alone.  Just because you have 20 cameras in the venue, doesn't mean you have to use all 20 in every minute of every song.  This ""Going Back"" video is the unfortunate victim of  hacky smash-cut MTV style editing (which might be OK for a 3 minute concept video aimed at hyperactive teens.  But since is a 2-hour live concert, and Phil's demographic is a little more 'mature', you might try the occasional shot that lasts more than 3 seconds once in a while - and a little more artistry with the jib/boom shots.  My initial reaction was to turn it off in disgust.  Then out of morbid curiosity (like rubber-necking at a horrific car wreck) I turned it back on and set a digital timer to beep every 60 seconds, so I could count the number of cuts per minute.  Most of the minutes averaged around 20 smash-cuts per minute - which is RIDICULOUS even for an amateur student film.  I noticed there's no Director credited on this page, no wonder - pitiful work whoever you are.  I come into this video as a Phil Collins fan who likes Motown music, and I found it completely un-watchable.",1364428800,3,1285,4.43404255319149

Phil Collins is amazing and soulful, the back-up singers have great energy, beltin' brass...its got it all.  The bass guitar rhythm from ""Papa Was a Rollin' Stone"" will replay in your mind for days.  This will take you back to your youth.",1359158400,,331,4.672413793103448
4251150,4,B0042JH0EE,"It was nice seeing all these old songs played by a great band using the ORIGINAL arrangements. After all, you don't bring in three of the Motown studio players and tell them to learn new parts. The band sounds great but even on DTS the guitars, bass and keyboards are too often buried in the mix. No doubt Phil could have sung better 20 years ago. But he is being compared to recordings made by guys in their 20's who were always told to sing these songs as high as possible. Phil doesn't have the right look or sound and people singing these songs usually have at least some of the moves. But he succeeds because this is 60's pop. While James Brown, Wilson Pickett and Otis Redding were making great R&B/Soul music, Motown was aiming for the pop charts because that's where the money was. Nothing wrong with that.",1357344000,,814,4.433333333333334

4251153,5,B0042JH0EE,I have been a Phil Collins fan for years and have never been disappointed.  Seeing and hearing some of the original Motown musicians was great and like Phil I also grew up with many of these songs.  I wasn't too keen on some of the back up vocals but Phil was spot on. I don't think anyone would be disappointed if they purchased either the CD or DVD.,1344902400,,351,4.147058823529412
4251154,5,B0042JH0EE,"I happened to catch this show on TV and my first reaction was, ""Why is Mr. Magoo singing 'Ain't Too Proud to Beg'?""  When I realized it was Phil Collins, I began to wonder why he was singing soul songs.  But the more I listened, the more I was intrigued, and I appreciated that he didn't do anything ""fancy"" with the songs; he sang them as they were originally sung. I also realized that the backup singers and the band were great too.  The thing that really won me over was the fact that he wasn't singing just the usual, familiar Motown songs of the Temptations or Four Tops.  For example, I couldn't believe he sang two songs from Curtis Mayfield and The Impressions--my favorite soul group of all time!  That did it for me; I had to go out and buy the DVD.  I love it, and my only regret is that he won't be doing more performances because I'd love to go to one of these shows.",1342137600,,881,4.183431952662722

Eddie Willis and Ray Monette playing the Motown signature guitar parts!
A Motown song with out a backbeat guitar? UNTHINKABLE!

8413748,5,B0042JH0EE,"Yes, it was on AXS and I watched my first Phil Collins concert. It was Motown music that will have you watching and remembering those songs, sort of forgotten, but renewed here. Where did Phil Collins come from? I had never heard of him before. Now I have the Motown concert, widescreen too,  as well as one of his HITS concert that hasn't arrived yet (not widescreen) . His talent is beyond belief. He knows what he is doing and can handle his orchestra with a mind that makes sure it is all perfected before it is recorded. A professional that I had never heard of before. Thank you AXS. You are a winner HD channel too. Sorry I missed his interview. Hope you repeat it.",1515369600,,672,4.333333333333333
