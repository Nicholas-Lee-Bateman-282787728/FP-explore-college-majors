8151566,2,B000JL13P6,I wish this movie was on DVD,1485734400,2,28,3.142857142857143
8151567,5,B000JL13P6,Why I still this movie $70??? Want the movie but the most I'll pay is $30 bucks. For goodness it's in VHS. Gotta buy a VHS player,1481414400,,129,3.814814814814815
8151568,4,B000JL13P6,"Why has this only had a limited release and no DVD ? This is a simple story. Gladys Knight and her real life husband have a rocky life and it mkes it worse when he goes to work on the Alaskan pipeline. Against all the odds Gladys has to find him,Alaska (at the time not often visited) is a wild place. Its basically your boy meets girk sort f thing with the theme So Sad The Song included but like Mahogany starring Diana Ross, we have had to buythis from abroad as they seem to have sank from trace. It's a nice easy piece of viewing with good performances and nice scenery but it needs a release on DVD.",1431302400,4,605,4.092436974789916
8151569,5,B000JL13P6,I am a super-fanatic SUPREMES fan and I believe this movie is far superior to ms. ross' 2 movies as far as reaching inside someone and truly touching their heart and emotional make-up. This is a very touching love story. Let's write Ms. Gladys Knight re: buying the rights to the movie and releasing it herself on DVD and she could reap most of the profits. I have no doubt she has a very large following that would make it worth her while..,1429833600,3,441,4.325301204819277
8151570,5,B000JL13P6,a dvd format is greatly needed for this film. it is not easy to find and they are not even showing it on Tv.,1379635200,5,108,3.5416666666666665
8151571,3,B000JL13P6,A decent video-VHS-for previously viewed.  Searched and searched for this movie-have never seen it on cable or anything within last 10 years-not TCM FXM or AMC.  It is the only movie Gladys Knight ever made.  I liked it and so did many other people.,1337299200,8,249,4.613636363636363
8151572,3,B000JL13P6,"In her acting debut, singer Gladys Knight plays Maria (hey, that's Glady's real middle name), a devoted wife who travels to Alaska to reconcile with her estranged husband (Barry Hankerson, Glady's then-real life husband) who works on the Alaskan pipeline for a crooked boss who has a prostitution ring on the side.  Will Maria get her man back and bring down that mean old boss as the average songs performed by Gladys and the Pips chirp in the background?  Will the beautiful cold Alaskan scenery offer any romantic spark?  And why didn't the Lifetime movie channel exist back then?

Gladys and Barry have a playful chemistry, while the evil boss comes off as someone who wears a black cape and cackles alot (and wouldn't you know it?  That evil boss is caucasian.  Right on blaxploitation fans!).  Entertaining in a tv-movie-of-the week sort of way.",1182902400,8,851,4.868055555555555
