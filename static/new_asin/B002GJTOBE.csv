8369793,5,B002GJTOBE,"Exceptional program about the life of R.J. Mitchell, British inventor of the 'Spitfire' airplane. Mitchell changed the course of British aircraft history. Those who had known Mitchell well described him as an adaptive genius, possessing excellent attention to detail, and was a great thinker. Mitchell passed away just after the 'Spitfire' was completed and put into action during World War II, but he and his plane will never be forgotten!

R.J. Mitchell was born in Staffordshire, England. After leaving Hanley High School at the age of 16 he gained an apprenticeship at Kerr Stuart & Co. of Fenton, a locomotive engineering company. At the end of his apprenticeship he worked in the drawing office at Kerr Stuart and studied engineering and mathematics at night school.

In 1917, he joined the Supermarine Aviation Works at Southampton. Advancing quickly within the company, Mitchell was appointed Chief Designer in 1919. He was made Chief Engineer in 1920 and Technical Director in 1927. He was so highly regarded that, when Vickers took over Supermarine in 1928, one of the conditions was that Mitchell stay as a designer for the next five years.

Between 1920 and 1936, Mitchell designed 24 aircraft including light aircraft, fighters and bombers. As Supermarine was primarily a seaplane manufacturer, this included a number of flying boats such as the Supermarine Sea Eagle, the Supermarine Sea King, the Supermarine Walrus and Supermarine Stranraer. However, Mitchell is best remembered for his work on a series of racing aircraft, which culminated in the Supermarine, and the famous Supermarine Spitfire fighter.

In 1931 the Air Ministry issued specification F7/30 for a fighter aircraft to replace the Gloster Gauntlet. Mitchell's proposed design, the Type 224 was one of three designs for which the Air Ministry ordered prototypes.

Mitchell was awarded the CBE in 1932 for his contribution to high-speed flight.

The Supermarine Spitfire first flew on February 19, 1934, but was eventually rejected by the RAF because of its unsatisfactory performance. While the 224 was being built, Mitchell was authorized by Supermarine in 1933 to proceed with a new design, the Type 300, an all-metal monoplane that would become the Supermarine Spitfire. This was originally a private venture by Supermarine, but the RAF quickly became interested and the Air Ministry financed a prototype.

The first prototype Spitfire, serial K5054, flew for the first time on March 5,1936 at Eastleigh, Hampshire. In later tests, it reached 349 mph, consequently, before the prototype had completed its official trials, the RAF ordered 310 production Spitfires. Mitchell is reported to have said that ""Spitfire was just the sort of bloody, silly name they would choose.""

In 1936 Mitchell was diagnosed with cancer, and subsequently, in early 1937, Mitchell gave up work, although he was often seen watching the Spitfire being tested. Mitchell went to the American Foundation in Vienna for a month, but died on June 11, 1937 at the age 42.

Mitchell's design was so sound that the Spitfire was continually improved throughout the Second World War. Over 22,000 Spitfires and derivatives were built.

At the end of his life, Mitchell was quoted as saying, ""If anybody ever tells you anything about an aeroplane which is so bloody complicated you can't understand it, take it from me: it's all balls.""

Watch this program. It is truly a great memorial to a remarkable man!",1378080000,,3455,5.207207207207207
8369794,5,B002GJTOBE,"This is a concise, informative and entertaining documentary about the man behind the Spitfire and more besides.  I liked the format.  I recognize William Woollard from a t.v. programme I used to watch in England called Tommorrow's World.  It was a science-based programme and so well done.  This film has some wonderful footage of planes.  The fly-over Buckingham Palace was fantastic and Holst music just perfect.  This doesn't just cover the Spitfire, it also gives credit to others in the arena fighting WW II.

Highly recommended.",1277942400,7,534,5.1395348837209305
