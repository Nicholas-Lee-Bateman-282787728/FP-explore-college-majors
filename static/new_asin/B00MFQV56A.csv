6576911,5,B00MFQV56A,"This is a fabulous Blu-ray presentation of the original ""Battlestar Galactica"" series. This exclusive box set even includes ""Galactica 1980"", the sequel series with Lorne Greene reprising his role as Commander Adama. I highly recommend this Blu-ray box set giving it five stars!",1487289600,14,278,5.488372093023256

8671953,3,B00MFQV56A,"The DVDs are fine, but the fragile box they came in had several broken ""hinges"" for the DVD flaps which held the six DVDs inside, making it impossible to even close the box without carefully positioning the loose flaps with broken hinges each time I took out a DVD!

I ended up using six old DVD cases for the discs and throwing away the cheap and easily broken box the discs came in.

Why do the manufacturers of these box sets use plastic cases that are to flimsy they're broken by the time we receive them?  Durable plastic cases are NOT that expensive!  Good DVDs and Blu-rays usually don't have this problem.",1531526400,,613,4.446428571428571
8671954,4,B00MFQV56A,I as of now would suggest the Remastered Collection. It as of this time going for 25 bucks. Including BG 1980 in the set.,1517961600,,121,4.083333333333333
8671955,5,B00MFQV56A,"This show is a 70's sci-fi classic!!  Some of the shows were not cleaned up for blu-ray, so a couple were of lower quality, but that's alright. I watched these as a kid when it was first aired, and really appreciate watching it again as an adult.  It comes with the Battlestar 1980.  Did anyone else ever notice that the cylon chest plate is the essentially the Cylon face stretched out? There is another version of the blu-ray box set with a red color to it and from some of the reading, it might be better, but I chose this one for the price.

The behind the scenes footage is a must to watch. The actors discuss pranks, life on the set, and it's nice to see that even after 20 years, they are as much a family as they had made it seem on the series.  And yes, I got the blu-ray set of the rebooted series too, :-D",1515110400,7,816,4.075
8671956,1,B00MFQV56A,"it did not play in either the computer, laptop, tv.",1509926400,,51,4.2
8671957,3,B00MFQV56A,"I have to think the ""Battlestar Galactica"" reboot was far better, but the 1978 version was geared for the time it was made I suppose.  Characters are kind of 2 dimensional with little to know about them.  Some characters, especially secondary characters, could easily have been replaced by cardboard cutouts and no one would notice.  Special effects were really good for the time.  Some of the episodes are worth skipping while others just don't make any sense.  ""Galactica 1980"" is so hokey it belongs with the Saturday morning kiddie cartoons.  Absolutely no explanation of what happened to the missing characters from the original series (except one).  This series is not for everyone (including me).  Doesn't stand the test of time.",1509580800,,736,5.075
8671958,4,B00MFQV56A,"I'll start off by saying as far as the quality and discs are concerned, no complaints at all.  I do have to downgrade the set because there are no notes or index either separate or on the discs.  The only indication is the disc number but no indication at all on what is on the discs.",1508889600,5,284,4.053571428571429
8671959,5,B00MFQV56A,Bladt from the past. This show is sooooooo cheesey but a gas to watch. Revisiting the late 1970s. Highly recommend!!!,1504915200,,117,4.9
