8358822,3,B002A0KV7A,"I bought this product for Toby McTeague.  It was a bonus to have the other features included.  I could tell the movie a replicate of the VHS because you can see the lines and spots caused by film strips.  However, you still get the full image and it is everything I remember it to be as a kid. I loved that I could share it with my kids.",1409616000,,337,3.926470588235294

8358825,2,B002A0KV7A,"During the sled dog movie the ""hero"" of the story is told by his father to beat his sled dog ,or it wouldn't respect him- and he did beat it.  Isn't this showing children that beating animals is the only way to work with them?  I think this is sending a bad message about the treatment of animals.  Both my dogs ( one being a Rottweiler X Pit Bull mix) respect me, and I've never beaten either one of them.",1357948800,10,406,4.05
