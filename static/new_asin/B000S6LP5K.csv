2881987,5,B000S6LP5K,"Season two of the British version of Cold Case with less music and more realistic detective work. The forensic specialists actually have to wear unattractive suits when investigating their cases. No cleavage shots and high heels here.

The character development is minimal, yet the characters are so rich and engaging because of the way they interact. Boyd is a unique detective, gruff and confident yet somehow likeable and not coming off as arrogant.

The only negative is the lack of extras. A documentary of the production and the actors would be very welcome. You only get the episodes and nothing else, but what enthralling episodes they are.",1203465600,14,648,5.046728971962617
2881988,5,B000S6LP5K,I love this Series that I first noticed on BBC America. I know therefore that their are more seasons. I have these two that I had not seen on TV. So what I want to know is when o when are we going to get the rest???? They are available on Amazon in the UK but of course then we need a different DVD player and ship from there. Why can't we have them here?,1201392000,4,355,3.7466666666666666
2881989,5,B000S6LP5K,Satisfied with how my purchase was handled. Ordered 17/12/2007 paid the extra freight but it did not arrieve on time so emailed Amazon my complaint was dealt with swiftly & the product did come eventually. I felt I was dealt with in a very professional way  the freight was deducted though I was happy to pay the normal freight as I realise it was a busy time of year. I did notice it came via Auckland I mail NZ a lot but the Sth Island & always feel their mail is slow but they deliver on a Saturday .,1200614400,,503,4.08080808080808
2881990,5,B000S6LP5K,"excellent UK murder drama, often in 2 parts. Clever plots with a couple of story lines overlapping. Modern times drama, Great acting. Glad to  have bought it for myself, but already have lent it!!  They really enjoyed the drama too. I bought 3 series at once.  to save postage to Austalia.. Highly recommend for a good night IN",1196812800,6,327,4.603448275862069
2881991,4,B000S6LP5K,"Resolving cold cases through improved forensic techniques and psychological examination (in a gentler form than Cracker) makes this a series worth watching and relishing. No hype, no spinning guns, no blood splattering about, but honest footwork conducted by a dedicated team looking for answers. The cast is good enough that  French and Saunders made a funny parody of it and was merciless on ""Boyd"" the Inspector of the team. Excellent cast even in some uneven scripts that are forgivable due to the total sensibility of the series.",1195603200,18,534,5.137931034482759
2881992,5,B000S6LP5K,"When I had started watching this series, I thought that I was going to end up comparing it to CSI. Wrong! This is so much better. The attention moves away from the laboratory to people and places. The team is made up of very individualistic people and this keeps a perpetual state of tension in the working. The stories and the actual plots are just incredible. Some of these episodes made my hair stand up. British mystery does not get better than this.",1194652800,3,454,4.481927710843373
2881993,5,B000S6LP5K,"This makes the Closure and CSI kids stuff.  The stories are a little heavy  and gruesome but it is the best of its kind.  I will there were more of them.  This is the last one.

They also try to bring to justice the ""Cold Cases.  Very British.",1193961600,10,243,3.9583333333333335

2882005,5,B000S6LP5K,"Still a fan of this show! S1 was very well done . . . storyline creative, interesting, captivating, focused, intense, writing and direction very well done and casting was on point. Although I will say that I think the main male character needed to tone it down just a tad as he seemed a lot more arrogant and narcissistic in this season.",1453852800,,337,4.451612903225806

2882007,5,B000S6LP5K,"I have loved this program from the first time I ever saw it. It can be raw and brutal but if this doesn't bother you, it is amazing mystery program based on cold cases. The acting is quite intense with the focus on finding what happened and ""who done it"" The search for clues, their interpretation and the forensics keep you fascinated. I enjoy them as much the second time around as I did the first. I give it 6 stars!",1448323200,,419,4.185185185185185
2882008,5,B000S6LP5K,Watched this show on BBC long time ago. Love all the seasons. The best detective show ever. Hope there'll be season 10 and more...,1447200000,,130,4.458333333333333

2882011,5,B000S6LP5K,"This is one of my favorite PBS series.  The characters are so well defined, and the performances are excellent.  I recommend the series to all mystery fans.

2882024,2,B000S6LP5K,"Do not like this show. I am a fan of British mysteries  and crime dramas, but I do not like this series. The detectives are unprofessional and inept. In the 9th season, a lone woman police officer is sent to Investigate a house in the dead of night. The house has supposedly been vacant for years but they couldn't wait till the next day to send a team to Investigate. Someone is poring gasoline all over the house but she doesn't' t have the sense to turn and leave and ask for backup. She is burnt to death.
The lead actor is filled with a hateful rage that is for me unwatchable. Badly acted, badly written. Goes on forever. Why all the great reviews.",1408924800,2,654,4.274193548387097

2882030,5,B000S6LP5K,We really enjoyed watching Waking the Dead Season 2. The story lines were very good and well acted. Again too bad they did not make more episodes for this season.,1381795200,,162,4.433333333333334
2882031,4,B000S6LP5K,"This show (seasons 1 and 2) is a good honest police detective drama. The reason I say honest is because the writers do not hide any clues from the viewers, so we have as much chance to solve it as the team does. I appreciated that, but as a result, in almost all episodes I guessed who the killer was about half way thru the program. I watched a fair a number of detective and mystery shows and this doesn't happen to me very often.

Another reason I call the show honest is because the characters are real; they are hard working and decent, a little dull and not especially good looking, sexy or charismatic, like similar team members in the more glitzy American shows. The 5 team members also argue with each other quite often, which is to be expected in this type of highly stressful job. They also have many moments of gratitude and camaraderie towards each other, which is nice.
The stories are interesting and the acting is very good, so over all definitely worth watching.

I have a different opinion starting season 3 and I posted it where it belongs.",1377993600,,1059,4.453608247422681
2882032,5,B000S6LP5K,Love this show - wish it was shown here in USA. Interesting mysteries & an excellent cast. Looking forward to the later seasons.,1368144000,,128,4.608695652173913
2882033,5,B000S6LP5K,"When I saw the pilot of this show, it seemed amateurish.  The actors were all yelling at each other for no reason.  No build-up of anger, just explosions.  The acting seemed brittle.  But then the actors calmed down in subsequent shows and had some chemistry.

In this season, they are fabulous.  They have settled into their roles and relationships and work as a team.  The writing seems better, too.  They actually are witty and seem more believable.  The plots were always good and each one different. The plots are fast-paced - it never gets dull.  It's a combination of footwork, interviewing and forensics.  They don't seem to follow a formula.  This is a very engaging series, with attractive scenery with some good shots of London.

If you like British police procedurals, this is an excellent example of one.  And the best news is, there are many more seasons to go.",1364860800,,875,4.746666666666667
2882044,5,B000S6LP5K,"The stories are good and the characters are interesting to watch and 'get to know"". I  would recomend this series very highly.",1364169600,,126,4.7272727272727275

2882046,5,B000S6LP5K,"This show is excellent and can be regarded as highly as Luther and Wire in the Blood. Boyd is fantastic. It is better than Law and Order, though similar with British flair.",1315785600,3,172,4.40625
2882047,4,B000S6LP5K,For anyone who likes crime drama this a top notch cold case mystery series. It is a BBC production therefore based in London. Their stories are often two episodes in length. Apparently there are eight seasons but so far I have only been able to find a few episodes here and there. If you like murder mysteries I highly recomend it.,1309046400,,331,4.442622950819672
2882048,5,B000S6LP5K,"Season two (2) of ""Waking the Dead"" finds the splendid ""cold case"" unit splendidly solving some horrendous cases that have remained unsolved for a long time and in some instances have ""tie-ins"" with crimes that are occurring in the ""now"".  I found Season Two (2) to be even better than Season One (1).

Season two (2) stories are so well written and acted by all.  The direction is superb.  The actors that comprise the cold case unit are so very good; they seem to have really ""settled into"" the roles that they are playing.  What I love so much about this show is that each character is very sure of his/her own expertise. Therefore, there are some battles between all with Trevor Eve as the Unit's leader, DCI Boyd having to solve these ""battles"" in a sometimes gruff manner.  Eve is so very good in this show.  I also really adore actress Sue Johnston as the psychologist--she kind of keeps DCI Boyd (Trevor Eve) ""grounded"" in  sometimes an amusing way.

If you want to experience a really good mystery/detective show that I feel is created for adults or people with mature minds, buy Season two (2) of ""Waking the Dead"".  This season contains four (4) two (2) part episodes on two (2) discs each part running about an hour.",1286668800,3,1228,4.566210045662101
2882049,5,B000S6LP5K,Waking the Dead Season Two:  Sames as season three.  We like it very much.  Keeps your interest.,1275436800,4,96,4.529411764705882
2882050,4,B000S6LP5K,"Not at all a major fan of crime series and certainly not of the past years ""virtual rape"" by hit series such as CSI (and its multiple off springs) I very reluctantly opened up for series 6 of the show recently. In Denmark each double episode is shown together with no commercial interruption so it actually takes a similar form of a movie (80 minutes in all).

The episodes I have seen so far have been more than decent with very creative plots and story lines and an amazing ability to avoid perfect Hollywood endings, troubled main characters and interesting use of technology (forensics).

For a reluctant crime series watcher like myself 4 Stars basically explode my scale ... If you are even remotely into this kind of thing 5 stars will for sure not be enough.",1227139200,8,766,4.583941605839416
2882051,5,B000S6LP5K,"my wife and I really love this show, but we can't find anymore seasons. We have the pilot and the first two seasons. I have gone to BBC america but I don't see them anywhere. This series is a great show, the cast is good at portraying CSI's in a believable way. I just wish we could get more DVD's,I know over in England they have at least 7 more seasons.

2882052,5,B000S6LP5K,This series is great fun in trying to figure out the mystery as well as enjoying the interaction of the main characters.

2882053,5,B000S6LP5K,"Waking the Dead is a fantastic series. Trevor Eve is incredible as the conflicted Peter Boyd.
