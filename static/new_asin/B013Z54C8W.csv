8729229,5,B013Z54C8W,"This is a feel good movie as the title implies.  The male lead character mistakenly thinks the female lead is terminally ill and so is extremely kind to her even though his nature would be otherwise. She, not knowing of this misunderstanding can't help but fall in love with him. Eventually the misunderstanding is cleared up and when he knows she isn't sick can then allow himself to love her. They both become their best selves through it all while running their Warm and Cozy restaurant. I watched it twice and highly recommend it.",1457308800,,534,4.680851063829787
8729230,5,B013Z54C8W,We loved this on TV. Every actor is perfect for their part. The two leads have a chemistry going that's great.... and the Mayor is just the most marvelous character. Perfect amount of heavy and laugh out loud funny and charming. The ending is special too.,1445990400,,255,4.565217391304348
