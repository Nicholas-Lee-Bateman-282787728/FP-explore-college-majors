2316199,5,B0009S2K8S,"I saw ""Merci Docteur Rey"" at the Cleveland International Film Festival, and it blew me away. My stomache ached from laughing so hard. If it's not a cult classic yet, I predict it will become one.

The movie follows Elizabeth Beaumont, an aging and overbearing American Opera diva who moves to Paris to reunite with her estranged son Thomas. Elizabeth has a flair for wearing garish caftans and floating around her house warbling out her sons name. Thomas is just coming to terms with his own burgeoning homosexuality, and develops a taste for personal ads and phone sex. In his efforts to see a psychiatrist (The Dr. Rey of the title), instead he meets the neurotic and definitely insane Penelope, who does the French language dubbing for Vanessa Redgrave films, and has now begun to think she IS Vanessa Redgrave. Of course, mistaken identities and plot twists ensue, and all of the crazy characters entangle and intertwine.

The two powerhouses of the film are Dianne Wiest and Jane Birkin, who each manage to steal the scene every time they walk on screen. When you see them both together towards the end of the film, it feels like your head might explode from too much funny. The role of attention-whoring older diva is certainly new to Dianne Wiest, who previously always seemed to play nice mom types, and she rises beautifully to the occasion. Jane Birkin is absolutely fabulous as Penelope, and her obsession with Vanessa Redgrave is such a brilliant metatheatrical gag (The beauty is that since this is a Merchant Ivory produced film, Vanessa Redgrave has a cameo that delivers the final punchline the audience craves).

If you are expecting typical Merchant ivory fare, this is pretty much the opposite end of the spectrum. But anyone who likes, well, laughing, happiness, or just general entertainment will not be disappointed. The humor is sort of in the vain of Absolutely Fabulous. Over-the-top women who create general mayhem around them, and even though they are completely reprehensible people, you can't help but love them. ""Merci Docteur Rey"" is definitely a go.",1123286400,13,2081,4.94
8065959,5,B0009S2K8S,"This is one of those delightful ditty of a film that could only succeed production in France!  Its hair brain story line really leaps all over the screen, with comical asides that can defy prediction.  Alas, only a European film such as this can be so entertaining!  NJMJr!!
PS To us in the States camp has a meaning of outrageous situations complete with associated behaviors!  The French on the other hand use a full repertoire caustic satires in its meaning.  Watch this film closely and you will be amazed at the underlying currents!!  NJMJr!!",1505433600,,547,4.76595744680851
8065960,5,B0009S2K8S,"Loved it! Witty, sophisticated, and fun! Dianne Wiest plays an opera diva/mother that is reminiscent of Bertolucci's La Luna, but with a comedic twist. A fab cast, Jane Birkin is particularly amazing and Bulle Ogier is a gem.  Very easily this movie could have given us a touristy journey through Paris, but instead it gives us the feeling for the everyday Paris through a quirky lens. This movie came out in 2005, when all the gay movies were about being ""gay"" and built around a lascivious affair. Merci Docteur Rey gave a fresh take on the ""gay"" movie genera, where the lead character was just simply gay.  So glad HERE TV has included it in its collection, it was a movie ahead of its time!",1490745600,,694,4.544

8065962,5,B0009S2K8S,"That's the question.  It wasn't Dr. Rey (or was it ?).  All the other reviewers seem to evade that question.
Or, is it really that important to the story !  It is.! !  Otherwise the film has very little purpose., I.e. lack
of mystery.  As already pointed out, terrific acting. - - -  I'd hardly call it ""hilarious""  or funny, at best ""amusing"".",1488499200,,344,4.365079365079365

8065964,4,B0009S2K8S,"Several reasons why, at this instant, I like this zany movie:
Dianne Wiest is ever-present as an aging diva at odds with her persona.
Jane Birkin makes a preposterous role seem almost plausible.
Bulle Ogier works as a less eccentric foil for two neurotics.
It takes place in non-tourist parts of Paris.
French is spoken slowly and poorly enough so that even I could follow.
Its as though the script were being written as the movie was being filmed--sometimes after a scene has been portrayed.",1469750400,,492,4.8
8065965,5,B0009S2K8S,"I had seen ""Merci Docteur Rey"" on here tv! on demand and thoroughly enjoyed it. (I am a francophone and lived in France in 1968-69 when Jane Birkin made quite a splash with Serge Gainsborough.)  I was very happy to be able to add it to my DVD collection at a very reasonable price.  I have watched it and shared it with friends several times since receiving it and we have all loved it!",1378252800,,386,4.202702702702703
8065966,2,B0009S2K8S,"I bought this DVD based on the customers' reviews and because I love Wiest and like Birkin. They do, indeed, turn in good perofrmances. Now to Merchant/Ivory. If you, like me, find Merchant/Ivory bloodless and cerebral storytellers, you'll find nothing different here. The ""funny"" situations are made in the head and there's nothing organic or visceral about them. The opera scenes are so untrue they are insulting to opera-goers. (This is, after all, a film about an opera diva - among others!)Those who were rolling in the aisles while watching this film are cut from a very different cloth than I am. So beware: If Merchant/Ivory's ""serious"" films do not move you, this comedy won't, either. PS: I speak both English and French, so my reservation of this film was not based on a language problem.",1241308800,3,799,4.882352941176471
8065967,5,B0009S2K8S,"Before reading someone else's critique of a film, book, food, etc., I think it's a good idea to see if you're taste is similar. Once you find someone you connect with, then follow them with confidence.

I thought ""Merci Docteur Rey!"" was a lot of fun. It's a mix of French and English speaking. Lots of characters and crazy situations, but holding together and easy to follow. I thought the mixture of characters was great. Even a quick cameo by Vanessa Redgrave & Jerry Hall.

Dianne Wiest hams it up and is a sheer delight. I especially liked Jane Birkin as the neurotic patient. Stanislas Merhar does well as the handsome closeted son. Everyone seems to be having fun and so should the viewers.

Try it...you might like it!",1209254400,2,726,4.612403100775194
8065968,5,B0009S2K8S,"Though promoted as a 'Merchant Ivory Film', MERCI DOCTEUR REY is related to the team in production only.  The film is written and directed by Andrew Litvack and is a well-made bit of fluff in the tried and true tradition of French Farce - mistaken identities, misconceptions that backfire then produce good things, and characters that are as off the wall as they come.

Elisabeth Beaumont (Dianne Wiest) is an aging American Opera Diva who moves to Paris to perform with an opera director of note Claude Sabri (Bulle Ogier) for an edgy performance of 'Turandot': she also wants to be near her Parisian son Thomas (Stanislas Merhar) who just happens to be struggling with his gender identity and spends his time in the sex personals and phone ads.  Thomas decides to see a psychiatrist Doctor Rey, but upon arriving at her office he mistakes one Penelope (Jane Birkin) to be the psychiatrist, not knowing that not only is Penelope wildly nutty (she thinks she is Vanessa Redgrave, having a job as the actress who provides the French dubbing for Redgrave's movies), she thinks she is responsible for Doctor Rey's dropping dead. Thomas and the newly discovered real Penelope bond and begin a 'crazy romance'.

While Elisabeth primps and prepares her Turandot she is told that Thomas is seeing a girlfriend (Linda), which in ways surprises her, as she believes Thomas to be gay.  Thomas becomes involved in a response to a phone ad, goes to a 'john's' (Simon Callow) apartment where he  observes voyeuristic murder involving a young man (Karim Salah).  The law becomes involved and through innumerable twists and turns the 'observed' murder is manipulated in a winning way.  Elisabeth debuts as an outrageous Turandot, Penelope meets Vanessa Redgrave (playing herself), Thomas discovers secrets about the identity of his father in a strange manner...etc.  The result is a crazy bit of lunacy that works extremely well.

This farce can be a bumpy road if you allow your attention to stray, but plug into the manner in which it is played and the result is a showcase for some fine actors having a swell time.  Yes, it is froth, but what a fine froth it is! An exhilarating comedy outing.  Grady Harp, August 05",1123632000,8,2204,4.848
