8122212,5,B000FGG5NA,"This one brings back grade-school memories from the 60s, from when this show and ""Kimba the White Lion"" were ""Japanese cartoons"" vs. ""anime"".

Tezuka's storylines were excellent for the time, and the shows are still watchable today, unlike a lot of vintage animation.

Well recommended.",1199664000,,286,5.333333333333333
8122213,1,B000FGG5NA,I bought this to relive childhood memories. Its fine except that two of the episodes are part one of a two part story. That was frustrating. The people who put these together should have thought that through.,1165276800,8,208,4.648648648648648
8122214,2,B000FGG5NA,"While the visual aspects of these episodes appear true to the original series, the audio tracks appear to have been redone, updated. If, like me, you were looking forward to seeing (and hearing) the original unadulterated versions you saw as a kid, then I think you would find this a disappointment.",1159056000,2,299,4.882352941176471
