833047,5,6304296320,"It is almost a rite of passage for beautiful actresses to portray a nun-Ingrid Bergman, Audrey Hepburn, Deborah Kerr, Jennifer Jones and Julie Andrews have all starred as women with religious vocations (and never have whimples been more flattering).  Heart and Soul features beautiful Kristin Scott Thomas as the innocent yet sensual Sister Gabriel/Anna Gibson, a woman torn between the two worlds of a Welsh convent and a gritty English mill in a story based on Marcelle Bernstein's novel.

Sister Gabriel/Anna is already doubting her vocation when a family tragedy takes her back out into the world that she renounced 16 years ago.  Believable character arcs, realistic sets and an excellent supporting cast make this a very satisfying five hour drama.  A must see for Thomas fans. Very gripping-I had to make myself quit watching and go to bed!! Yeah BBC.",1200009600,85,858,5.0638297872340425

This series is highlighted by a great performance from Kristin Scott Thomas.  What a beautiful face!!  Great chemistry between her and the actress who played her sister-in-law, Amanda Redman.

833052,4,6304296320,"For sixteen years Sr. Gabriel lived a cloistered life in a convent. Her family consisted of an order of elderly nuns. A pesky young novice becomes infatuated with her but Sr. Gabriel knows that God will take care of such an annoyance. Life in the order is safe, comforting and routine.
  God does have a way of breaking one out of his/her comfort zone. In this case Sr. Gabriel is forced to confront the outside world as she is summoned to help her pregnant sister-in-law. Her dutiful brother committed suicide and now left his sister with quite a mess to handle. Sr. Gabriel enters into the world of grief, squawking children, hideous dress and hairstyles, a hysterical sister-in-law and the family mill which is about to go under.
  Kristen Scott Thomas gives a superb performance of a nun coming to grips with her faith and the various emotional and spiritual turbulance that she finds in both worlds. Sr. Gabriel finds out that one's cell can be stifling. Her other self, Anna, discovers a world that is cruel, painful, and frightening but at the same time filled with joys that she never experienced before. Body and Soul deals with a woman's need to make peace within herself and become a whole woman in the midst of the chaos surrounding her.
  The great mystery is can this woman do it? Is she replacing one cell wall for another? This is an entertaining film that gives you great insight upon the temptations that plague all of us.",1014249600,34,1440,4.649606299212598

Imagined it might be a British pot boiler, historical soap opera but selected it because I like KST, instead I found Body and Soul thoughtful and quite provocative. The characters were well drawn and the story with the conflicting worlds of Sister Gabriel Anna quite fascinating.  I was taught by sisters and they are not as saintly as one might think. They can be just as mean and petty as women in the secular world. The rules, however, in a convent are clear and the life can be quite enjoyable.  I would have liked to have known more of her motivation for entering the convent.  But a young girl can have romantic notions which change with time and that includes religious ideas.  She may have wanted away from her alcoholic mother.  Kristen Scott Thomas is a dynamo of an actress and her facial expressions and wonderful eyes make you not want to look away.

It's her rapid decline into the modern world, going from doubting to debauchery in a heartbeat.  And once again, the music overshadows the story.  She walks across the room, music.  She gets on an elevator, music.  Enough w/the music drowning out the dialogue already.  Sometimes silence is better.  Oh, and some character background would be ever so helpful, such as why she entered the convent in the first place.

833562,2,6304296320,"I saw a good chunk of ""Body and Soul"" some years ago and thanks to Netflix I was able to watch most of what I had missed before.  Frankly, I was pretty disappointed.  For one thing, life in a contemplative order such as the one that the protagonist was in seems profoundly weird and anachronistic in the 21st Century (things like prohibitions on touching someone, having close friends, or even much contact with one's family).  Frankly, I find myself thinking that ""God doesn't want, expect, or need people to live that way.""

I also felt that Sister Gabriel just wasn't anywhere near as interesting and complex a character as the nun in ""the Nun's Story"" (which is both a great book and excellent movie).

Finally, ""Body and Soul"" smacked a bit too much like ""chick-lit"" when it had Sister Gabriel ""give it up"" to the hunky factory hand in the end.  I suppose a former nun might be inclined to see what she had been missing, but given the fact that she didn't lose her faith just the desire to be in a convent, I think that she wouldn't have entered into a sexual relationship so quickly (particularly, when the movie made a point of showing how disoriented she was by the outside world).",1229904000,7,1475,5.524444444444445
833563,4,6304296320,"I read all the current reviews after I saw the mini-series, because I was searching for one that might explain the ending.  I have a 2 disc set (marketed may I say in the most difficult packaging I have ever encountered for a DVD.  My nails broke and fingers ached after struggling with the release buttons to free the discs, but I digress). I was talking about the series' ending.  And that is the point, what is the ending? It leaves us unfulfilled and wondering: and then?  What happens next? Clearly, she chooses the world she wants, but what happens to the two men who are so involved in her life?  What about her sister-in-law's life?  What about the other characters who are integrated into the plot?  Not one has a finality except for the character who is the cause of all problems, and a dead nun. (Trying here not to give anything important away.) Did she have regrets later?  Did she have the children she so desperately desired? I honestly thought I must have missed an epsiode or that there was a missing disc. As a result, the series feels disappointing and anti-climatic  It is cowardly of a director not to have  gone farther with the plot.  Had I wished to invent my opwn ending, I would have written the screnplay myself!

The cast was excellent, the screenplay interesting, though the storyline about a nun leaving a convent is not unique.  Other reviewers have noted the issue of faith and the critical reception she met dressed as a nun in the outside world. For some that will be toubling.

833566,2,6304296320,"Too much body, not enough soul!

This sour little mini-series will leave you with a definite bad taste in the mouth.  Body and Soul played on Masterpiece Theatre in the early nineties and I was eagerly awaiting the chance to re-view it when it appeared on DVD.  After fourteen years, I remembered the story of a nun becoming a business woman.  What I didn't remember was the tawdry, sordid view of life in general that this mini-series portrays.  While there are several edifying scenes of life in a contemplative monastic community in the first few episodes, these come to an end when the protagonist, Sister Gabriel/Anna Gibson, leaves the convent on sabbatical after her brother commits suicide to take care of the family milling business.  Things go down hill from here.  Virtually everyone outside of the monastery mocks Anna's vocation and what is more, none of the characters on the ""outside"" express any kind of faith in a higher being - as a matter of fact, two of the characters, Hal, the mill's foreman as well as Anna's sister-in-law Lynn, say outright that they do not believe in God.

While some will extol this movie as the story of a young woman on a quest of self-discovery, others, life myself, will only see the depressing story of a woman who has lost her way.  The fatal flaw in the film is that it never explores why Anna entered the monastery in the first place.  Midway through the film I also took a definite dislike to the character of Anna when she purposely goes out to lose her virginity and has no qualms whatsoever about it!

The acting is generally superb, especially Kristen Scott Thomas as the protagonist and Dorothy Tutin as the Mother Superior.  Anthony Valentine also gives a notable turn as the villain, Stan Beattie.

The film is so anti-faith (I don't say ""religion"" because it is not anti-religious - it is plain and simply anti-faith), hedonistic if you will.  What a disappointment.  If you are looking for something uplifting, do not look here!",1207785600,37,1989,4.72463768115942
833567,4,6304296320,"This mini-series features the then relatively new face of Kristin Scott Thomas,before she stole this critic's heart in ""The English Patient"",starring opposite Ralph Fiennes. In this quite long production -it runs for several hours-,she plays the part of a nun,living a very ordered and introspective life in a Welsh monastery,who is called on to come to the aid of her brother's wife,after the brother dies mysteriously ina car accident. Kristin Scott Thomas is given permission to spend a week with her sister-in-law,played by Amanda Redman,who is very pregnant and already the mother of 3 other children. Her husband's death has left the family in very parlous state and KST is almost overwhelmed by the mess her brother has left behind. Not only is his family suffering. The family spinning and textile business is on the verge of collapse. Sister and sister-in-law have to sort out their own lives besdies attending to the failing workplace and the vultures who are circling to pick up the pieces.
Kristin Scott Thomas is possibly England's best actress,in this person's opinion. This is a good tale,well acted. It's believable and it lifts your spirits. It's a great screenplay and the settings seem authentic. This is a very good purchase. Highly recommended.",1206662400,3,1265,5.145631067961165
833568,5,6304296320,"I first saw this on Masterpiece Theatre sometime in the mid 90's.  I enjoyed it.  What really hit home with me was when Sister Gabriel/Anna realizes that true suffering is out in the common place world, not in a convent.  Life in the convent is depicted in this series as bleak, silent, cold, denial of food, hard work and lots of prayer.

When Anna first goes to see her widowed sister in law, she is shocked by the billboards (ie: an ad for condoms) and life in general outside of the convent.  Very gradually she comes to realize that the vows she made 16 years earlier is not what she wants. The pain and anger her sister in law feels for both Anna (running away to the convent to avoid life) and her dead husband (he commits suicide by driving his car off the road - after mailing his very expensive watch and a few other things to his wife) leaving her with several children and one on the way is very powerful.

When Sister Gabriel/Anna returns to the convent after helping her sister in law with the new baby and children, there is much hostility towards her.  One of the Sisters beomes deathly ill,  Sister Gabriel is accused of bringing back disease from the outside world.

Following all of the changes from total seclusion to Anna taking her dead parents business over, making it profitable, and falling in love is very subtle.  In the end Anna realizes that the decision to leave the Convent and renounce her vows is the correct thing for her to do.  Anna ends up saving jobs at her parents near bankrupt yarn factory (her brother was not a good business man) by turning it around (with the help of Mother Superiors' accounting abilites) and helps with her sister in law and children. Thus finding life to be much more rewarding outside of the convent.

I won't say much about her experience falling in love,  buy this DVD and find out for yourself.

As usual, this is a top notch British production.",1202256000,18,1913,4.475504322766571

It is not only a film depicting a woman going after her rights, ideals and fighting for the best interests of her family textile business after 16 years of chastity in a secluded convent; but also displaying how a nun tried her best to handle the conflict and struggle between the conventional Catholic world and the modern society.
