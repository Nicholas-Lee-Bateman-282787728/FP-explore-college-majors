2257236,1,B00082W990,"I have a thing for 80s movies and its youth, style, soundtrack etc, but this movie is unbelievably boring. Nothing happens, I mean, it's the worst script ever, and the acting is abysmal to boot. Starting with Daphne Zuniga, an actress I really like. I guess they're not to blame, I mean, what can you act out of such a bland empty story?
It's so silly, really really naive even if it includes one of the leads taking extasy and almost getting raped.
Don't waste your time trying to track down this one guys, you're missing nothing.
It's not like every teen movie done in the 80s is going to be great. Just like many movies today are total crap.",1299196800,2,644,4.375
2257237,4,B00082W990,I was so excited to find Modern Girls!!!  Definitely a hard movie to find anywhere!!!  But I was very sad that it wasn't published on dvd!!!  But I was happy enough to get on vhs!!!,1292198400,2,181,4.114285714285714
2257238,5,B00082W990,"This is one of those comedies that you're either gonna' love it, or hate it. I thought it was totally funny. It's one of the lesser known 80's comedies, but like another poster said along with ""Valley Girl"" I think ""Modern Girls"" fits quite nicely as a companion piece.  On one hand you've got a the ""bad date from hell"" combined with a story that all takes place in one night, and of course by morning all the right people are together and everyone has revealed and worked out their inner demons.  Sure it's cheesy, but it's all light-hearted and fun.  The other thing is you've got some great 80's music in here.  This was the movie that introduced me to the band Depeche Mode, and I've loved their music ever since.  It's also got a great Jesse Johnson song in it, and the rip on MTV videos and 80's pop stars are spot on.

It would be great if they could release this on DVD.  I guess they will one day, with hopefully some good extras. Many of the actors and actresses in this went on to do some really noteworthy work.  It's kinda' fun to go back and look how they got their start.",1264032000,11,1087,4.242718446601942
2257239,5,B00082W990,"I love this movie. Saw it first on cable years ago. Have been a big fan of Clayton Rohner ever since and have kept track of his career, always wishing he'd get the recognition he so deserves. Seriously, he is a very talented guy not to mention a cutey! All the ladies of the film have faired pretty well with Virginia Madsen having even been an Oscar hopeful. This film and Valley Girl with a young Nick Cage are the ultimate 80's movies. See it for the performances but also the dated clothing, hairstyles, attitudes and soundtrack. Highlight is Clayton in a dual role as good guy Cliffy and bad boy rocker Bruno X. The overall theme of the film is having a good time and staying loyal to your friends. So there isn't much to go wrong with.",1134518400,20,741,4.338129496402877
2257240,5,B00082W990,"My sister and I saw this in the theater, with maybe 6 other people in the theater. We glanced at each other during the movie, a ""why are we watching this?"" look. By the time the movie was over, we were the only ones left.

Believe it or not, this is one of my favorite movies, and for a long while I used it as the test of friendship and potential boyfriends. It's still the movie equivalent of comfort food for me.

Try it, and watch the whole thing even if you want to stop it. It takes place over the course of one night in the lives of a trio of 20-something female roommates and one ""nice"" guy. The interplay between the characters is wonderful. You get to know each of them and how the roommates care for each other and get to know Clifford, the semi-geeky guy pining for Virginia Madsen's character. It has some dark moments in it, but overall it's a romantic comedy with a good late-80s techno pop soundtrack. A few days after you see it, I bet you will find yourself wondering how the characters are doing.",1130889600,36,1015,4.253886010362694

Where is the sequel that was mentioned in the interview with Clayton Rohner? I'm ready to see these 4 together again! :D",1445644800,,292,4.140350877192983
2257247,5,B00082W990,"One of my favorite movies of all time. FInally available on DVD after years of VHS only availability, the movie is a cheesy, feel good romp through LA. If any of the following apply to you, then you will LOVE this movie:

1. Fan of the 80's
2. Fan of 80's new wave
3. A retro design nut
4. Love chick flicks or just watching a movie with pretty girl leads
5. Enjoy 80's period piece films

Seriously, Modern Girls is really fun to watch, and has one of the best soundtracks ever, featuring classics by Depeche Mode, Icehouse, Jesus and Mary Chain and more awesome songs you may or may not remember but will enjoy hearing.",1433721600,,621,4.299145299145299
2257248,5,B00082W990,"Great 80's movie, especially if you lived in L.A. and were young in the 80's and trying to navigate the Hollywood nightlife scene Good soundtrack (even has The Jesus and Mary Chain!)  I always thought this would have been a good ""double feature"" with Valley Girl.  Same vibe to me. Fun.",1428278400,2,286,4.588235294117647

2257251,5,B00082W990,Love this movie. One of my favs from the 80s. Totally an under rated movie. Yep... That is all I got.,1398902400,,101,3.857142857142857
2257252,4,B00082W990,"If you're a Cynthia Gibb or Virginia Madson fan, you probably already own this movie. The movie itself is just a mindless romp through a single evening downtown by a group of young people with apposing ideas of what to do next. The movie also stars Daphne Zuniga and Clayton Rohner, who you don't get to see to often. I enjoy this movie and recommend it to anyone who remembers partying downtown in the '80s.",1397692800,2,408,4.453333333333333
2257253,4,B00082W990,"Was watching one of my all time fave electronic band -  Depeche Mode music video ""But Not Tonight"", and I thought the background film clips really intrigued me.

  Now having watched the film for the first time I thought and was laughing at myself ( and some scenes ) because the film really captured that 80's feel. I can somehow relate with the film since those were my high school years.

  It's a nice good enjoyable film.",1386806400,2,426,4.454545454545454
2257254,5,B00082W990,Growing up my mom used to always watch this on tv and I was so happy to find it on here. She was very surprised when it arrived and we're both happy with it.,1380153600,,157,3.6470588235294117
2257255,5,B00082W990,"This movie catches the feel of the 80's perfectly. It's a fun, entertaining movie. One of Daphne Zuniga's earlier works. I watch this all the time. Finally broke down and bought it (after searching forever for it on dvd). This is every bit as good as The Breakfast Club. Very under rated film.",1365033600,8,293,4.547169811320755

2257257,1,B00082W990,"Moderns girls is one of the worst 80""s movies.  I remember watching it when it came out and I thought I would watch it again but I couldn't finish it again, 20 years later...",1362009600,,174,4.117647058823529

2257259,5,B00082W990,"If you're an 80's freak, then you absolutely have to watch the movie Modern Girls. Don't let the title of the movie throw you off. The movie isn't just about girls. It's basically a comedy that depicts the L.A. nightlife in the 80's. Everyone has seen The Breakfast Club and Ferris Bueller's Day Off. But not everyone has seen Modern Girls. It's the ultimate movie to watch for an 80's movie night.
Modern Girls blares 80's songs all throughout the entire movie. Even better the movie features the song ""But Not Tonight"" by Depeche Mode. The movie boasts of a talented cast of actors. You might recognize Daphne Zuniga (Margo) who was Princess Vespa from Spaceballs. I don't want to spoil this here, but Clayton Rohner (Clifford) does something incredibly amazing by the end of the movie. He's just that good of an actor.
Modern Girls is about three female roommates who plan to go clubbing in Los Angeles, and a nerdy guy gets caught in the middle of all their troubles. The more you watch the movie, the more the characters grow on you. There are funny moments and memorable lines throughout the entire movie. Modern Girls is also the perfect 80's time capsule that captures all the wacky hairdos, fashion, and make-up at the time. I can never grow tired of watching this movie. The story, acting, and humor make Modern Girls so unforgettably entertaining.",1344470400,16,1358,4.734177215189874
2257260,5,B00082W990,"Finally this comes to DVD! Saw a post on the Modern Girls Facebook wall that it is out and came straight to Amazon to get it. One of the best movies from the 80's...It has great music, classic 80's club scenes, great friendships and you end up rooting for the geek to get the girl in the end! Don't think twice, click add to cart and buy it! You won't regret it :).",1334534400,8,365,4.013698630136986
