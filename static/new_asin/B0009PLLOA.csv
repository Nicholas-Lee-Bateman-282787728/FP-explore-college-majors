8064826,4,B0009PLLOA,"Interesting stories from newspaper articles, worked on and solved by a railroad detective.  I've only watched a couple of episodes but they are interesting because the railroad is taking on the great outlaws of the late 1800s.
Anyway, I think Jim Davis is a great western actor and has the best voice around.  I really bought it to see him act and talk and the bonus is the good story line.  I don't remember the series, which started the year I was born, but love the old 50s-60s westerns TV shows.
The quality isn't that great BUT they give a disclaimer/explanation at the beginning and if you're used to looking at old films or TV shows, it is fine.  It really is about the story line anyway, isn't it?",1447200000,2,705,4.441860465116279

8064829,4,B0009PLLOA,"First of all, ""Stories of the Century"" is one of the really interesting series from the Golden Age of Television.  It was the first TV Western to win an Emmy, and it starred the great Jim Davis (later Jock Ewing of ""Dallas"" fame) as Matt Clark, railroad detective. Matt's job with the Southwest Railroad Company is to track down outlaws, some famous and some not-so-famous, who threaten and rob its trains and stagecoaches.

One important element that sets this TV Western apart from all the rest, is that Matt's partners are two beautiful, intelligent, and tough, female railroad detectives. In the 1954 season, his partner was Frankie Adams played by the wonderful Mary Castle.  There were quite a few times when Frankie saved Matt's hide, especially when it came to tracking down deadly female outlaws like Cattle Kate, ""Little Britches,"" and Belle Starr.

In one memorable episode, border bandit Joaquin Murietta kidnaps Frankie, but she manages to escape back to town when Murietta gets into a fight with his jealous girlfriend over Frankie.  After reuniting with Matt at the sheriff's office, Matt sends her to her hotel room to get some rest.  When Frankie enters her room, Murietta is waiting for her.  She manages to escape again, but not before he gives her a long, lingering kiss. Frankie rushes into the sheriff's office and with a sly smile tells an astonished Matt, ""Joaquin was waiting for me in my room. He kissed me... and it wasn't bad.""

Matt's second partner was Margaret Jones (called ""Jonsey"") played by the talented Kristine Miller in the 1955 season. In one nail-biting episode, Jonsey falls into the clutches of Kate Bender and Kate's dim-witted, overall clad brother who are a couple of real-life frontier serial killers. The Benders make their living by kidnapping hapless stagecoach passengers, robbing and murdering them, then burying them in their big vegetable garden. Kate Bender is played with smoldering menace by B-movie queen Veda Ann Borg. I won't spoil the ending, but this is one of the best episodes in this series or any other Western series.

While watching these tales, it struck me that ""Stories of the Century"" might very well be the first TV series to take women seriously as equals, and certainly one of the first to present a portrait of women as equals in the workplace (namely the frontier towns and wide open spaces of the Old West).

In the series, Matt, Frankie, and Jonsey are all railroad detectives who are on the same level of employment with the Southwest Railroad Company. Matt is not the ""superior"" of the two women railroad detectives, nor does he act as if he is, a point that is emphasized throughout the series.

For instance, when Matt and Jonsey are on the trail of the bloodthirsty killer Harry Tracy, a town marshal says to Matt, ""It must be nice working with such a beautiful assistant.""

Matt leaned forward, fixed a steely gaze into the marshal's eyes, and said, ""She's not my assistant. She's my partner. We're both railroad detectives."" End of discussion.

Most of the episodes in this exceptional series were directed by the legendary ""king of the Republic serials""  William Witney. The series was filmed at Republic studios, so there's plenty of non-stop action in ""Stories of the Century."" There's also a liberal amount of stock footage used from various Republic Westerns which gives the series a bigger budget feel in spite of the meager budgets per episode.

This St. Clair Vision collection of ""Stories of the Century"" contains 36 of the 39 episodes that were made.  The picture and sound quality of these episodes are not always great, but they are not terrible, either. If you read Annie Van Auken's excellent review, you will see that she has listed all 36 episodes in this set.

What were the three episodes that were left out of this set, and where can they be found?  They are: 1. Burt Alford; 2. Augustine Chacon; 3. Milt Sharp. All three of these episodes can be found in one affordable collection entitled ""Essential TV Westerns (150 Episodes)"" by Mill Creek Entertainment, and it's available from Amazon.

So saddle up for some extraordinary adventures that feature the West's most notorious real-life outlaws, with a certain amount of historical truth, and a whole lot of fast-paced action. And, by the way, partners, the women can ride just as hard and shoot just as straight as the men in ""Stories of the Century.""",1347753600,3,4407,4.867647058823529
8064830,5,B0009PLLOA,This is excellent for the year it was made and I've watched over half of the shows and enjoy them very much. I always liked the way Jim Davis and his assistant Frankie carried out their duties  Calvin,1241136000,,200,4.2631578947368425
8064831,4,B0009PLLOA,"This is an old western TV show I'd never heard of, but when I gave it a chance I was very impressed. Smart writing, good acting, and plenty of action make this a terrific show for anyone who likes old westerns. Jim Davis and Mary Castle were a very good choice to play their roles and they have a strong and likable screen presence. The picture quality is a little rough and weathered, but if you've purchased bargain DVD's of old TV shows you'll know what to expect. All in all, a good solid western and at a great price to boot.",1230076800,8,530,4.205882352941177

8064834,4,B0009PLLOA,"St. Clair Vision's 3-DVD set of ""Stories of the Century"" is a quick, inexpensive way to obtain almost the entire run of this 1954-55 Emmy award winning Western series.  St. Clair has included 36 of the 39 half hour episodes that were produced for this series.  The basic premise of ""Stories of the Century"" was to place Matt Clark, railroad detective, and one of his female partners in mostly fictional stories that are intertwined with actual historical figures and events.  Clark is portrayed by Jim Davis, a veteran television actor who is perhaps best known by modern audiences for his portrayal of Jock Ewing, the family patriarch on ""Dallas.""  Davis is a solid, likeable actor who's well suited to the Western genre and he's excellent throughout the series, as are his two female partners, played by Mary Castle and Kristine Miller.  Look for guest stars like Slim Pickens, Fess Parker, and Lee Van Cleef in a few of the episodes.

""Stories of the Century"" has previously been released by Platinum Disc Corporation on four DVDs under the title ""Legends of the Old West.""  If you are looking to obtain the entire series, Platinum has released all 39 episodes (along with a few bonus episodes of ""Judge Roy Bean""), and Amazon carries the Platinum releases as well.  ""Stories of the Century"" cleverly mixes fact with fiction and is sure to satisfy fans of television Westerns.",1119484800,25,1379,4.863247863247863
