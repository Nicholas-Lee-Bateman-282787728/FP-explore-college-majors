8376582,1,B002P37BO8,"This is  shockingly bad video, it has static vertical lines for several minutes several times during the film, as a damaged VHS for several Minutes, I have noticed a full scene is missing, dunno how many other scenes are missing, I urge Amazon to investigate this bad quality DVD and investigate & scrutinize  the seller, there is no image on the cover on the DVD Case nor on the DVD",1497225600,,383,4.457142857142857
8376583,1,B002P37BO8,"I ordered this film from Amazon.com, not from a Marketplace seller, and was shocked to see the totally unprofessional production quality of this disc and packaging. This is nothing but a cheap VHS transfer, not a remastered professional DVD release. Very disappointed in the physical media and lack of DVD booklets and graphics on the disc.",1362614400,6,340,5.089285714285714
8376584,1,B002P37BO8,"I bought the film because I want it for my DVD collection. I'd already seen the film before, and of course I have nothing to complaint about the movie. I spect receiving a normal DVD, including the sam cover as it is shown on the product description at Amazon, but when I received it I found out that the movie is only a simple dvd, with no cover at all,  placed in a clear dvd box, with no cover, no specification, no pictures, no nothing but a simple dvd!!!
I'm really disappointed, since I paid an amount that isn't  cheap for a dvd, and I received the cheapest case ever.
Very bad acquisition for a dvd collection, and very bad impression about the seller.",1329004800,3,660,4.314516129032258
8376585,1,B002P37BO8,"The original ""J'accuse"" stands on it own for the period in which it was filmed 1918-19.  This is exceptional in its own right - but the tragedy is the horrid copy of what appears to be one of the greaest anti-war films of all time.

There is nothing worse than captializing on an inferior product and this has to be the worst transfer that I have ever purchased.

Hopefully, Criterion or Kino will do something about this and bring forth a restoration worthy of this great film on dvd.",1285977600,5,485,4.426966292134831
8376586,1,B002P37BO8,"As of this writing the only home format available for this particular film is this mediocre offering from Video Yesteryear which is derived from a print of inferior quality made worse by the fact the company chose to hastily transfer an existing VHS copy (tracking lines and all) to DVDR.

The film itself is masterful and worth every penny; so this is why viewing it in this sad state has motivated me to call upon the original rights holders in an effort to remaster the original French negative (assuming it still exists) and release an official DVD.

In my opinion this 1938 remake is better than the original in terms of execution; with the help of sound and added atmospheric cinematography it taps into nerves the 1919 silent film cannot.

La Fin du Monde; another forgotten Abel Gance film has also yet to see an official DVD release in its original French form.

At some point the studio who owns these films should really consider putting together a box set of Gance's work.",1275350400,7,984,4.670520231213873
