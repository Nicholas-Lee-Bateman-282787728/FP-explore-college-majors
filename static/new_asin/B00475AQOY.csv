4279243,1,B00475AQOY,"First of all, why is the video on these DVD's so poor? These shows should not have to be displayed as kinescopes, as they were taped. And worse yet, the show switched to color in 1965. So the shows from 1965 on are not only not in color, but they are kinescopes of color programs.

Add to this attrocity that Synergy has elected to put a ""Synergy"" logo bug in the lower right hand corner of the screen, thus making a bad picture even a bigger mess. (The website DVD Talk has some screen captures within their review that should help give an idea of the poor quality and the screen bugs.) I contacted Synergy, and they gave me the lame excuse that they used the bug to keep people from stealing their transfers.

So sad, as I would love to have some quality copies of this great, classic show by this great orchestra leader.",1335312000,63,823,4.303225806451613

4279262,4,B00475AQOY,"Despite all of the jokes, impersonations and parodies, The Lawrence Welk Show (under its various official titles) was simply the finest musical program on television.  While a multitude of other musical/variety programs had come and gone, the thirty year run (local, network and syndication) of The Lawrence Welk Show is a testament to the quality and entertainment value of the program.  The show still lives on in reruns of the syndicated show on PBS.  When the screen filled with bubbles and the announcer said, From Hollywood, its The Lawrence Welk Show, and you heard the opening bars of Bubbles in the Wine, you were about to see a classy (but never stuffy) hour of entertainment.
Though often classified as a variety show, it was almost wall-to-wall musical numbers interrupted by commercial breaks.  The variety came in the music presented. A big band number may be followed by a ballad singer, a dance number, an Irish tenor, soloist from the orchestra, ragtime, Dixieland, ballroom dance numbers, polkas, barbershop quartet, waltzes, covers of (then) popular tunes, show tunes, novelty numbers and so on.
This set consists of four DVDs, each of which was previously released separately.  Each disc contains three programs.  All programs in the set are from the 1960s.  The gangs all here: Welk, Myron Floren, Dick Dale, Norma Zimmer, Bobby Burgess, Joe Feeney, Larry Dean, Larry Hooper, Aladdin, Jo Ann Castle, many many others and, of course, The Lennon Sisters.
And you will get so see some of the really bizarre moments.  Can you imagine the classic Harry Belafonte song The Banana Boat Song being performed by..The Lennon Sisters!!!
WARNING:  All twelve of these shows were mastered from old 16mm black and white kinescopes.  Even on the old television system, the video and audio quality are sometimes well below the original broadcast standards.  The box claims a running time of 720 minutes (12 hours), but the actual running time is closer to 600 minutes (10 hours).
This pricey collection will provide a pleasant stroll down memory lane for some.  It will even provide hours of quality entertainment for those that asked Lawrence who?",1493164800,,2153,5.067988668555241

4279321,5,B00475AQOY,"I can only rave about this collection. If my parents were still with us, I'd buy it for them because, when I was a child, we watched LW every week. Remember, I was born in 1951, so these early shows are obviously in black and white. Back then, even the Adventures of Superman was in black and white and black and white televisions were the norm in homes that had TV at all. (My parents didn't get color TV until about 1969).

If you have heard the term ""Champagne Music,"" then you can thank Lawrence. Soap bubbles pop up in introductions, bringing back my fond memories of those nights with my family.

If you are not sure if you'll enjoy this on DVD, check to see if it is still free on AMAZON PRIME. That's what I've been watching for the last 45 minutes and will keep watching most of this afternoon. (Six hours later, I finished both volume one and am almost done with volume two, but took a break for the news on TV.)

I have attached a picture of when DODGE presented Lawrence Welk with a solid gold gavel after five years on the air.

I highly recommend Lawrence Welk to everyone, even if you go for the free music on Amazon Prime.",1443571200,2,1138,4.25462962962963
