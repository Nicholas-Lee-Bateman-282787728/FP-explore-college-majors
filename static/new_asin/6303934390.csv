739231,4,6303934390,"Although not her best, this film still stands the test of time.  The film is simple, but that is what makes it a classic.  Lombard will make you fall in love with her character.  Not many actresses can do that today.  Jimmy Stewart is as dependable as ever as the husband.  If you like Lombard, check out ""Nothing Sacred"" as well.  It is a great comedy with a wonderful screenplay by Ben Hect.",1013990400,,393,4.315068493150685
739232,3,6303934390,"The trials and tribulations of a young married couple.  Carole Lombard was that rarest type of actresses - a beautiful woman who was also funny.  Seen today, it is very much a film of the Hollywood past, and without the pleasing performances of the leads, would have little to recommend it.  By 1939, she had established herself as a top-flight comedienne, and it had begun to bother her; she felt that she needed to prove her dramatic abilities.  David O. Selznick agreed with her and commissioned Jo Swerling to write an original screenplay about the problems of a young married couple.  Lombard's humour shines through, even though the part doesn't call for comedy, and Stewart is in his element as the shy but sunny, diffident yet optimistic all-American.  Both Selznick and Lombard felt that the perfect actor to play the husband would be James Stewart, which required a loan-out from MGM in order to play in  this United Artists production.  The film was a modest success but not the winner Selznick had hoped for; the scene in which the serum is brought to the baby (he has pneumonia) via a plane in snowstorm barely passed muster in 1939, today it borders on the ludicrous.",1006041600,3,1181,4.754901960784314
739233,1,6303934390,"My wife and I expected SOME comedy - after all, Carol Lombard and Jimmie Stewart have BOTH done excellent work in that field, and the reviews we'd seen CALLED it a ""comedy-drama"". But alas, the only funny part of this movie was unintentional humor, particularly the ""dramatic"" sequence at the end, with a biplane pilot flying precious ""serum"" (on New Year's Eve, apparently) over the Rockies in a blinding blizzard (some wing spars on that plane!) and eventually bailing out somewhere over the Susquehannah (some fuel tanks that biplane had!) while newspaper headlines track his progress - all in one night? As a (former USAF) pilot, I laughed myself out of my seat throughout THIS sequence - it is totally ludicrous.
This ""weepie"", made in 1939, is infinitely dated. It looks much like a prototype for ""It's A Wonderful Life"", and maybe film buffs can check it out bearing *that* in mind, but if you are expecting ANY sort of humor, forget it. Stewart lurches from one setback to another, while his wife stays home with the baby and the mother-in-law (and the maid - don't forget the maid....). Trying to think of a single ""funny"" scene, I suppose the two seconds Stewart spends poking a bottle at the baby could bring a smile, but the scene where he comes home completely drunk is like watching a train wreck.
As another reviewer wrote, the DVD transfer is awful. The sound seems to come from the bottom of a 55-gallon drum stuffed with cotton - turning the volume up only gets you an earful of hiss and crackle. And extras....well, what do you expect at this price? The ""art work"" is a single lobby card (and that's shown so small that I can't imagine why it was even included), and ""biographies"" is a single page for Stewart, nothing for Lombard or anyone else.
The film this reminded me of most was ""Cavalcade"", but without the high spots. Even if you like ""weepies"" like ""Penny Serenade"", there is precious little in this archaic creaker to interest you.  I highly recommed passing. Or better yet - go for ""It Happened One Night"".",986342400,9,2036,4.671309192200557
739234,1,6303934390,"This is a great example of the old time Hollywood soap opera.  James Stewart and Carole Lombard are wonderful (as always) as the young couple dealing with the strange and cruel twists and turns of life.  A two-hankie  weepie. However, I strongly recommend that you do not purchase this dvd.  The sound and picture quality are terrible.  It is completely unwatchable  and the hiss is so bad the dialogue is muffled. It's hard to understand how  a company can find tranfers as bad as these - the vhs copies are much  superior.

Things turn tough when their child is struck with  illness, and they come to the realization that life is hard after  all.
This movie has romance, humor, idealism, and sadness -- things that  make movies of the black and white era watchable and enjoyable.
I  heartily recommend this movie...but watch out for the second scene with the  little angel in sneakers.
Five stars for a great watchable movie --  even though some people think that it's got too much melodramatic sappiness  in it.  After all, I think that anyone can do with a dose of good, solid  sappiness once in a while.",950659200,12,815,4.590277777777778

739590,3,6303934390,"""Made For Each Other"" has a terrific beginning and end that is ultimately dragged down by a leaden midsection.  The center of the film concerns the courtship between lovelorn Pandora (Renee Taylor) and Giggy (Joe Bologna) that is totally tedious and underdeveloped.  What makes matters worse is there isn't much onscreen chemistry between Bologna and Taylor and they're married in real life!

739840,1,6303934390,"This movie is literally stupid and I had to laugh. How long did this couple know each other before they married. Johnny Pussy Pants married her only after knowing her for a few days. What an idiot. He didn't see the signs that the twit he married was only seeking her next meal ticket. She had no family. Did they disown her may be because she could have been a prostitute and disowned her. She latched onto Johnny Pussy Pants for her meal tickets. Then she was to be in journalism school when she met Pussy Pants and then abruptly quit school when she met Johnny Pussy Pants. If that isn't a gold digger. I never seen a woman married, doesn't work, has her mother-in-law living with her, lives in an apartment, and has no kids during their first year of marriage and yet she has a maid and had maids when they were financially broke. That was my first chuckle. She wanted fancy jewelry, mink coat, trips to Europe on a cruise ship, etc., but yet doesn't lift a finger financially to get what she wants. Meaning she wanted and not need what she wanted. She pays no attention to the baby she has. That baby was adorable. They go out to a New Year's Eve party and she showed no concern for her sick baby. She knew the baby had the sniffles and she should have stayed home with him like any good mother would have. What confused me is they claimed they had no bedroom for the baby as they said they only had a two bedroom apartment, yet they, her mother-in-law, and the maid (Lily) each have a bedroom. So where did the third bedroom come from and why wasn't the baby sleeping in one of those rooms? Johnny Mason must have added on to the apartment as they ended up having three bedroom instead of two, lol. Yes, this movie has many many flaws in it. I like Jimmy Stewart, but this movie he plays in is down right dumb. I noticed every movie Carole Lombard plays in she is either a gold digger or a stripper/whore. When I first seen this movie I thought it was cute, but after seeing it many times a person can see the flaws. Then this woman wants Johnnie to ask his boss for a raise so she can take her expensive trips to Europe and other things she wants. Sure Johnny had to do the dirty work asking his boss for a raise, she didn't, she just wanted the almighty buck. She said she deserves what she wants. I see this woman make no effort on her part to make things better for them financially. She only wanted and wanted and spent and spent, but didn't want to earn it. She only wanted and wanted, but put forth no effort to get what they want. Then Johnnie Mason is a wimp. He can't stick up for himself with his mother. He may as well tell his mother to bend over and pull her pants down so he can kiss it. His wife lets the mother-in-law walk all over her and she complains about her mother-in-law. I call Johnnie Mason a 'Momma Pussy Pants'. He is a true mama's boy and he is suppose to be a grown man and an attorney at that. He has no guts and I would never hire him for my attorney. If their first year of marriage was so poor they caused it themselves. The only cute part of the move was the baby. I wonder what happened to that baby. She and her maid (Lily) were in the park with the baby. She and Lily were talking at length and yet neither one of them kept an eye on the baby. He probably crawled out in the street and got hit my a car or someone kidnapped him. Yeah, this movie sets a bad example on many issues. I wouldn't buy this movie. Don't waste your money. I would love to rewrite this movie and change a lot of things. It is a great big flop.
Get TV called this movie a hidden gem. I call it Hidden Junk.",1391990400,,3624,4.127298444130127
739841,4,6303934390,"Made for Each Other is a well done film that held my attention all the way! My only minor disappointment is that at times the plot (which moves along well) became a bit *too* melodramatic but on the other hand I simply couldn't have asked for better, more convincing acting, cinematography, choreography, sets and background musical score! When others note that you really are rooting for the young newlyweds to succeed in life they couldn't be more accurate, too.

When the film starts, we meet newlyweds John Horace Mason (James Stewart) and Jane Mason (Carole Lombard) who married after meeting by chance in Boston and knowing each other scarcely more than a day! And wow, do they have the cards stacked against them--Jane has no family; John's mother Mrs. Harriet Mason (Lucile Watson) is not too happy about it and John's boss Judge Joseph M. Doolittle (Charles Coburn) is not happy either because John was supposed to marry Judge Doolittle's daughter! To make matters worse, John is stuck with a job at Judge Doolittle's law firm that doesn't make much money and at the last minute John and Jane can't even take a honeymoon because the case of Higgins versus Higgins has to be presented in court.

Time passes and there's a ray of real happiness and hope for the young couple when Jane finds out that she is expecting a baby! John is also thrilled but with their limited income and their cramped apartment (John's mother is also living with them) the baby is going to make the place even more cramped and the budget even more strained. John and Jane also have difficulty holding onto good hired help since they can't afford to pay very much money for it!

Of course there's more to the plot than this--what happens when their little boy gets life-threatening pneumonia and might very well die if they can't get a very special, hard-to-find serum? We also see what happens when the hired help come and go. Look also for solid performances by Eddie Quillan as Conway; Alma Kruger as Sister Madeline; Raymond Bailey as a Salt Lake City hospital chemist; the wonderful and underrated Louise Beavers as Lily and Harry Davenport has an uncredited role as Dr. Healy. Esther Dale plays Annie; Mickey Rentschler has a small uncredited role as an office boy; Nella Walker is Dr. Langham's nurse-receptionist; Renee Orsell plays Hilda and Ruth Gillette plays a somewhat drunk woman at a New Year's Eve party.

Made for Each Other is a fine motion picture for fans of the actors in it and people who appreciate romantic dramas with a few elements of comedy thrown in will also enjoy this film. True, there are a few moments where the melodrama is a tad overdone but overall it's really a rather good film.",1377820800,2,2699,4.7239915074309975
739842,1,6303934390,"Bad for a Stewart Film.  The movie jumps around and does not tie together well at all.  The ending comes all at once without enough time to lay out the happy ending intended.

7/8th of the movie has a no conflict, ordinary, depressing life sort of ""Our Townish"" feel. The power of the actors is evident and when the baby gets deathly ill on new years night the movie is on track for greatness. If the writers killed the baby, this movie could have been great. But no. Just like the biplane flying from the Rocky Mts at 12K feet to New York on one tank of gas with ""serum"" to cure the baby crashed, so did the movie.  A happy ending with the baby saved and the spineless main characther instantly going from a crying blathering idiot to a ""Thanks boss for the 5,000k to save my baby and thanks for making me junior partner.... now F-U.  Your company sucks and there's going to be some changes around here and if you don't like it......Here's my baby, he can say MAMA!""

However, this movie does have one of the best examples of 1930's black stereotyping. The family goes through two houskeepers that just didn't fit.  Guess which 'race' the third was?  Guess how she worked out?  Guess which food she used as a metaphore when consoling the wife? (nope... the other one.)  Guess which food she cooks for the family on new years eve? (even after she's let go due to finances) *ring... who could that be? Oh, it's our former housekeeper! She's got nothing better to do at 11:00 new years eve but come by and share some stereotypical food she cooked for us! yay!

If a serum can't be flown in bad weather from Salt Lake City to New York, their boy will surely die.

739847,5,6303934390,I love this movie.  The price was right so I'm glad I purchased now.  I saw it in the AMC catalogue for $24.95.  Glad I didn't buy it there.,1309305600,,140,3.7586206896551726
739848,3,6303934390,"This film can be classified as a showcase for the beautiful actress Carole Lombard. Always a terrific actress, Lombard was getting better parts at this point in her career and this film is a good example. The story which is essentially about a young couple dealing with the problems of marriage, a irksome mother-in-law, a child, lack of financial resources and space, might seem fairly mundane and not much more than a cinema soap. However, it is to the credit of Lombard and her co-star James Stewart that this movie stands up so well. They injected so much passion and emotion in their roles that they were absolutely real and believeable. When Lombard got a tear in her eye I was so involved in this story that I started tearing up, too. Grizzly Charles Coburn adds to the story as Stewart's difficult boss who ends up having a heart of gold.
This MGM copy isn't great and has not been remastered, but the sound quality and picture is acceptable. This film was in the public domain for many years and a lot of really dreadful copies were circulated. I'd like to see a great cleaned-up copy at some point, but honestly the performances are so strong that it holds up regardless of the less than pristine MGM copy.",1291680000,2,1216,4.58256880733945

739939,5,6303934390,"this is a rare little gem of a movie. early Stewart vehicle. James Stewart is absolutely my favorite actor of the Hollywood's Golden Era. Stewart delivers his usual great performance. Carol Lombard is just as brilliant in perhaps one of her greatest performances. the premise of this film is simple. it traces the lives of a young couple through the hardships and tragedies and joys of marriage. with any other two actors, this film may have been an abysmal failure at the box office. however, this is a true little gem, actually i would call it a 'sleeper'. the only bad thing about this film is it's great misfortune of being released in that classic year of movies: 1939. 1939 is considered by many critics to be the solid gold year for movies in hollywood. this film can't be categorized with the great legends of that year (GWTW, Casablanca, Of Mice And Men, Thw Wizard Of Oz, etc.) but is still worthy in it's own right. for the price, you can't beat it.

739941,5,6303934390,"This touching film following the trials and tribulations of a newly married couple moves from humor to drama with ease thanks to fine performances from Jimmy Stewart and Carole Lombard, a good screenplay from Jo Swerling, and deft direction from John Cromwell.

Jimmy Stewart is young attorney John Mason, returning from a recent trip a married man after a whirlwind romance with Jane. He can't wait to put his wife's picture on his desk and the two can barely contain their bliss. Carole Lombard glows in her role as Jane, capturing that feeling of newfound love in her performance. Charles Coburn is the head of the law firm James works for and whose daughter he was expected to marry. This causes regret on the part of his mother, portrayed by Lucille Watson.

Jimmy Stewart is young attorney John Mason, returning from a recent trip a married man after a whirlwind romance with Jane. He can't wait to put his wife's picture on his desk and the two can barely contain their bliss. Carole Lombard glows in her role as Jane, capturing that feeling of newfound love in her performance. Charles Coburn is the head of the law firm James works for and whose daughter he was expected to marry. This causes regret on the part of his mother, portrayed by Lucille Watson.

739945,5,6303934390,"In the whirlwind of courtship and romance, most engaged couples truly believe they are ""made for each other."" What happens in the early years of marrige often leaves them wringing their hands and thinking, ""perhaps we are NOT made for each other, after all.""  This is exactly what happens to John and Jane Mason in this beautifully noir Selznick film. John (Jimmy Stewart) and Jane (Carol Lombard)go from one disappointment to another and their skills reveal why this would be called a dramody by today's standards. There is plenty of soap opera-like drama and it is sprinkled with comedy as only Lombard and Stewart can do it. First disappointment is John's mother who cannot accept her son's marriage and insults Jane daily under the roof of their own home as they have had no choice but to ask her to live with them. Another major problem, is John's inability to advance in the law firm, due in part by the malicious malipulations behind scenes by his rival, Carter. They have a baby boy. The story takes place at the tail end of Depression years and the young couple can barely scrape by. A myriad of other complications make all of these situations worse. One New Year's Eve the couple decides they must probably end the marriage. They try valiantly to have a festive New Year's celebration on the town, but they are growing more and more depressed. Jane says in the middle of it ""I am going to call home and wish Baby a Happy New Year!"" (the baby is too young to get a REAL phone call) When their baby gets a life-threatening illness, all attention is off the state of their marriage and on their son. They find  new reasons to love each other and the one person you would not expect to help them, does.
It is a great movie about problems most young marrieds have. There are many scenes that are darkly beautiful with amazing shadows, and Lombard and Stewart look amazing, shot this way in the primes of their lives--a true classic. Charles Coburn is quite good.",1268956800,,1968,4.588068181818182

It would be hard to find a less emotionally involving film than this. The story has a complete lack of focus,and fails to give any indication that this pair is ""made for each other"".They didn't triumph over adversity-or anything. They just seemed to be completely inept at handling the basic realities of life,too caught up in their own immature ""woe-is-me"" attitude. When a real tragic circumstance finally does occur (the baby's illness),the whole thing is so absurb,it's impossible to care.

740020,5,6303934390,"What can go wrong in a movie produced by David Selznick, and starring Jimmy Stewart and Carole Lombard? The answer is nothing, nothing at all. The movie (1939) is brilliantly directed by John Cromwell, sets the stage for future classics such as ""Penny Serenade (1941)"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life (1946)."" Newsweek wrote in its review that they were ""perfectly cast in the leading roles."" This is a family drama about a young couple, named John Mason (James Stewart) and Jane Mason (Carole Lombard), who get married after just one date during John's stay in Boston. When they get back to New York, obviously everyone is surprised; an overpowering and overbearing curmudgeon, named Joseph Doolittle (Charles Coburn) as John's boss at the law firm who is unhappy that John didn't marry his daughter Eunice (Ruth Weston), and Jane's annoying mother-in-law Harriet Mason (Lucile Watson). The problems are typical especially for Jane Mason, after constant complaints and comments of her mother in law that Jane can't cook or clean, and the financial problems created by unexpected responsibility of a new baby on the way. The real star of the movie is Carole Lombard who offers spectacular performance as a newly wed woman trying to do her best, while offering a dinner party for John's boss, or trying to cope with house maids leaving the Mason family after constantly being harassed by Harriet Mason, or advising John as how to stand up for his rights as a man with his boss when asking for a fair wage. Things get worse as John's boss offers a pay cut due to shrinking business, and the new born is seriously sick, and only a serum from Salt Lake City could save the child. As the drama unfolds, everyone pitch in to help, a pilot from Salt Lake City offer to fly in a bad snow storm risking his own life, and John's boss offering to help financially, and emotionally. At the end all ends well and everyone is happy, and John is back in the driver's seat at the law firm.

The story is set during Christmas time, and singing of Auld Lang Syne during New Year's eve is reminiscent of It's a Wonderful Life; while it is heart warming to hear that song, the real tragedy unfolds as the entire set watches the medicine being flown in a private single seat plane during a severe snow storm..

It is a sad irony to watch Carole Lombard playing as a young mother. In real life, happily married to Clark Gable, she was desperate to have a child but sadly that dream remained unfulfilled after the tragic plane crash in Las Vegas in January 1942. Just before boarding the plane, Carole had addressed her fans, saying, ""Before I say goodbye to you all, come on and join me in a big cheer! V for Victory"" President Franklin D. Roosevelt admired her patriotism, and declared her the first woman killed in the line of duty during the war, and posthumously awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

740022,3,6303934390,"Watching an impossibly young James Stewart teamed with the screen's reigning screwball comedienne, the wondrous Carole Lombard, is treat enough in itself, but this 1939 dramedy directed by John Cromwell has them working overtime on a clich-bound plot about young, struggling marrieds, John and Jane Mason, who face an unexpected crisis. Penned by Jo Swerling, the script throws in every movie-invented barrier to their happiness - John's dominating mother who lives with them, his unreasonably demanding boss, a series of impossible domestics, and a surprise pregnancy which eventually leads to a melodramatic turn that involves a plane flying through an unrelenting thunderstorm. The tear-jerking film bears a certain resemblance to Leo McCarey's 1941 ""Penny Serenade"" with Cary Grant and Irene Dunne in style and pacing.

None of it should work, but somehow it does because Stewart is so callow and sincere, Lombard so earthy and knockout gorgeous, and their relationship quite convincing. Playing their standard character roles during this period, Charles Coburn plays John's hearing-impaired blowhard of a boss, Judge Doolittle, while Lucile Watson is her imperious self as the mother-in-law from hell criticizing Jane's every move. My favorite player is Louise Beavers, who briefly plays the one maid the Masons adore. The Masons' financial straits force her to leave but not before a lovely scene between her and Lombard in the park. The movie was produced by David O. Selznick, who was preoccupied with post-production work on ""Gone With the Wind"" but you can definitely see his influence in the film's technical polish. It's too bad the film has fallen into public domain as the print transfer to the 2004 DVD is woefully substandard. Regardless, the pairing of Stewart and Lombard is well worth seeing in any vehicle.",1163289600,4,1826,5.318339100346021
740023,4,6303934390,"What starts out as another typical Carole Lombard comedy turns deadly serious halfway through. Lombard and attorney Jimmy Stewart just get married, and before they can even leave on their honeymoon, troubles begin: he gets called back by his crotchety boss (Charles Coburn) to try a case. Later at a disastrous (though still humorous in spots) dinner party thrown by the couple to entertain Coburn and his family, the boss announces that his son-in-law is to become a partner in the firm, something Stewart was pining for. It's no more joking around after that: things really get tough for Stewart and Lombard until one New Years Eve their baby becomes very ill, and Coburn turns decent and finds a way to get medicine they need to be flown to them through a snowstorm.

Lombard usually didn't get a chance to play serious roles such as she does here and she's excellent. Jimmy Stewart is also good as the shy and timid (until the end) lawyer, maybe too shy and timid to be totally believable, but still good. (I thought shy lawyers were as rare as blind racecar drivers.) The melodrama gets poured on pretty thick by the time the baby gets sick, but the excellent acting by Stewart and Lombard - and some of the other minor characters, especially Lucile Watson as Lombard's mother - make up for that easily.",1150848000,2,1308,4.6869565217391305
740024,4,6303934390,"""Made For Each Other"", a 1939 melodrama from MGM, is pretty standard stuff but what rises it above the usual soapy fare are the two incredibly endearing stars.

John Mason (James Stewart)is a young associate lawyer who, on a business trip to Boston, meets Jane (Carole Lombard).  After a day they decide that they were meant to be and marry.  Both return to New York, where John will return to work and his quest for partnership, and Jane will adapt to life as a housewife.  But problems, as always, stand in the way.  First and foremost is John's mother (the always dependable Lucille Watson), who John lived with before his marriage and who will continue to live with John and Jane after their marriage.  Mrs. Mason is opinionated and quite used to being the only woman in John's life - - she and Jane butt heads, albeit politely.

Jane attempts to host a dinner party for John's boss and co-workers and problem after problem ensues.  The housekeeper quits, they run out of wine and the ice cream for dessert has melted.  Add an expected baby to this mix!

The latter part of the film falls prey to soapy melodrama, with a sick baby and waiting on a special serum.  But Stewart and Lombard keep their heads above water and keep the movie itself from sinking.

""Made For Each Other"" is nothing too heavy and yet it's not fluffy lightness either.  It can be characterized as neither a basic comedy nor a serious drama.  The film has some comedic moments, as would be expected with Stewart and Lombard in the leads, but the real story is the basic day to day existence and hardships that we all face.

The best part of this film are the two stars.  James Stewart is always brilliant playing the Every Man.  He is completely believable as the young attorney, wanting to make partner, wanting to provide for his family, but not ask for too much and not alienate his boss.  He loves his wife but has obviously been a Momma's Boy for much of his life and doesn't want to hurt his mother's feelings either.  His nervousness and fright over first telling his mother that he is now a married man, and then informing his boss that he is married is marvelous and frank.  While he doesn't have passionate, electrifying chemistry with Lombard, there is a geniune affection and gentleness there that can't be overlooked.

Carole Lombard, en route to breaking into dramatic roles, is simply luminescent.  She is remarkably beautiful in this film, and yet down to earth and earnest as the young wife who is so desperately in love with her husband and desires to be a good wife.  Watching her gave me a certain sense of sadness at the fact that she would not live too much longer after this film, and her alleged desire to have a child with her husband, Clark Gable -- a dream that was never realized, except on film.

Overall, ""Made For Each Other"" is a wonderful showcase for the talents of Stewart and Lombard and sadly, their only film appearance together.",1142294400,,2944,4.563809523809524

740026,4,6303934390,"""Made for Each Other"" is an effective and compelling melodrama that seamlessly blends the conflicting essences of drama and comedy into a genuine treat for the heart and mind. It stars resident scatterbrain, Carole Lombard and congenial James Stewart as Jane and John Mason, a couple on a whirlwind romance to nowhere. Disapproving in-laws intercede in the couple's idyllic domestic paradise and financial stresses brought on by a change at work eventually culminated in a devastating illness. Director John Cromwell spins a cinematic tapestry of lives that are the embodiment of those proverbial ups and downs we all encounter in life. Cromwell's sprite and accessible direction allows even the sensitive charm and poignancy of secondary characters like, John's boss, Joseph Doolittle (Charles Coburn) the chance to shine. Though the effervescent triumph of the human spirit is never far from Cromwell's vision for the film, it's ultimately that old fashioned sentiment that salvages the whole affair from becoming overly sweet.
MGM's DVD is impressive. The B&W picture exhibits a very nicely balanced gray scale with smooth, solid blacks and very clean whites. Age related artifacts are present throughout but do not distract. Some minor edge enhancement crops up and there is more than a hint of pixelization in infrequent spots but overall the picture will surely not disappoint.

""Made for Each Other"" is a textbook example of how a skillful cast of pros can turn an ordinary, run-of-the-mill script into something special.  The film's plot is a soap operatic pastiche of comedic and dramatic incidents revolving around the misfortunes of a young hardluck couple who have married after a brief meeting.  Their fledging relationship is tested at every turn as they are beset by a long list of cliched domestic problems, including disapproving inlaws; financial worries; tragic illness and impending loss; etc, etc.  In lesser hands the film might have turned out to be 93 minutes of bathetic nonsense, but co-stars Carole Lombard and James Stewart succeed in taking straw and spinning it into pure gold.  Both actors approach their roles with a disarming integrity and heartfelt honesty that breathe life into the often hackneyed dialogue and situations; Lombard in particular manages to make her character luminescent from the inside out, even in those scenes in which she is dimly lit and appears devoid of makeup.  Now THAT'S ""star power""!  The two leads are given able support by a wonderful cast of talented character actors giving their all (Charles Coburn, Lucile Watson, Harry Davenport, and Louise Beavers), but ultimately the picture rests on Stewart's and Lombard's more than capable shoulders.

At one point, the copyright on ""Made for Each Other"" lapsed and the film fell into the public domain.  Television broadcasters and cheapie video companies aired or sold copies of varying quality, sometimes made from third or fourth generation prints that featured wretched contrast, inept splices, and muddy sound.  Happily, the MGM DVD offers the cleanest, sharpest video and audio I have come across in years of searching.  In the past, I have stopped watching various prints five to ten minutes into the film because of quality problems, but the MGM print - though not perfect - is relatively free of video or audio distortion, and is definitely the one I would recommend to you, especially if you're purchasing a copy to add to your home library.",1104537600,52,2127,5.0922190201729105
740028,5,6303934390,"Now that MADE FOR EACH OTHER has been gloriously restored on this latest DVD, it is easy to see why it was chosen by THE NEW YORK TIMES as one of the Ten Best Films of the Year in 1939, arguably the greatest year in motion pictures.  Indeed, it is a film that could easily have influenced IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (which also stars Jimmy Stewart).

Simply put, this is a film that traces the first couple years of Carole Lombard and Jimmy Stewart, two newleyweds who face career disappointments, meddling in-laws, financial woes, etc...  Although the material may sound familiar, the actors, writer, and director find a fresh way of portraying ""scenes from a marriage.""  There is enormous warmth, humor, and pathos in the interplay between Lombard and Stewart, with great contributions from the supporting cast.  Director Cromwell builds a scene beautifully -- much like George Stevens and George Cukor did.  The dinner that Lombard throws for Stewart's boss is a perfect example, as Lombard's efforts are undermined by a disgruntled housekeeper, unwelcome guests, and a malfunctioning icebox.

Carole Lombard is known for her comedies (MY MAN GODFREY, TO BE OR NOT TO BE, NOTHING SACRED), but this performance is easily one of her best.  Lombard is so natural, beautiful, and compelling, and she and Stewart create such a believable couple that it makes you yearn for a re-teaming, especially in THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER. Unfortunately, she only made five more films after MADE FOR EACH OTHER before her life was tragically cut short in a plane crash.  Her engagement and subsequent marriage to Gable at the time she was filming MADE FOR EACH OTHER revealed a vulnerable, nurturing, and commanding presence that should have brought her an Oscar nomination.  However, in a year that boasted Vivien Leigh's Scarlett, Greta Garbo's Ninotcha, and Judy Garland's Dorothy, it is easy to see why Lombard's Jane Mason was sadly overlooked.

The last twenty minutes of the film does disolve into soap opera, but it is still expertly done.  MADE FOR EACH OTHER deserves a reappraisal, and this beautifully restored version is a wonderful reason to experience the film anew.",1101081600,3,2163,4.994428969359332

So I was very surprised to find her in this drama and love her performance. I also enjoyed her performance in Swing High/Swing Low, which starts out a bit comedic and ends up melodrama. I've become convinced that the off screen qualities that grounded her as a human being - compassion, generosity, a love of other people - inform her dramatic work and make her very convincing and full of heart. She is SO convincing when she plays a woman who marries a man who falls short, but sticks by him to the bitter end. There is nothing masochistic in her work when she does this - it's all heart and all loyalty.

Comedy with her seems to me to be a construct. So I'm sure it's just me. The woman was a famous screwball comedienne, and some of her forays into drama were supposedly disappointing. I find her second rate in comedy compared to other women of the era - Irene Dunne, Claudette Colbert, Ginger Rogers, Barbara Stanwyk, Katherine Hepburn, Jean Arthur and more. But she is so passionate and full of heart in her drama, and so genuine, that I root for her completely. This is really a terrific movie. The part at the very end - about getting the serum to the east coast in time - is terrifically dated and should have been cut in half.
