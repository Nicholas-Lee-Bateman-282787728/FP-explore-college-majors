2552639,2,B000F4RHRK,"White Coats not a memorable comedy movie, but a decent attempt. The scenario is rather hackneyed, dealing with wacky hospital interns with hackneyed personalities.

The characters follow the standard traits we've come to expect...
The rebel/quick come back guy, the smart sensitive willing to do anything to prove his innocence guy, the mysterious girl, and a few other cliche' elements to scatter into the nest.

The plot without out spoiling anything is a group of interns who are forced to take on more experienced roles in the hospitals depths. Together attraction, awkward moments, and some slightly funny moments occur as the interns endure the rigors of the medical foray.

All the scenes feel more like a television series and not so much a movie. While thats not necessarily a bad thing, series are meant to be viewed in hearty tightly packed episodes...not all at once. Like medicine taking too much at once can lead to some bad side effects.

The comedy isn't top notch, but their is much worse out their.",1212364800,2,1016,4.923976608187134

I paid for the product more and less $ 14,99, a few days ago the product goes to $ 9,99

Finally, doesnt pay to return the product due to the cost of the return.

2552641,4,B000F4RHRK,"i will admit that the jokes were a little drawn out, but it was still a fairly funny movie. i wouldn't go into this movie hoping for a ""Scrubs movie""...it has it's scrubs-isms, but it's a funny hospital movie and that's that. Most of the movie was improv anyway...

i liked it and i have loaned it out to a few friends that also liked it.",1202601600,4,338,4.121212121212121
2552642,1,B000F4RHRK,"Lame, not funny, and a total rip-off of Scrubs...without any of the cleverness. I love Dave Foley, I love Dan Ackroyd, but damn you both for making this movie.",1201478400,,159,4.517241379310345
2552643,1,B000F4RHRK,"If you can make it through the entire film, you're a real trooper and you'll only find one palatable funny part.

[...]
The cast is unfamiliar and not readily recognizable from other shows or movies in mainstream Hollywood.  Dan Aykroid (I did that on purpose--it's not a typo), slightly elevates the quality of the film, but, if you need Dan Acridhemorrhoid to elevate your film, the film is seriously pathetic.

The ONLY humorous part of the movie was when a young intern was forced to tell a family that their loved-one died on the operating table...BUT THIS GAG HAS BEEN DONE SO MANY TIMES IT'S NOT FUNNY ANYMORE!!!!

Other than that, it's one comedy clich after another until this bowel obstruction finally ends.

If you have a serious burning desire to buy this movie, then I wouldn't pay over the ""used"" price for this cinematic enema...

Good luck...",1188259200,2,858,4.763513513513513
2552644,1,B000F4RHRK,"One scene...Where the cute brunette nurse in red did her little performance... was interesting and only because she was cute and in red.  The rest of this movie was just lousy.  It wasn't funny (and I like low brow juvenile humor as much as anyone,) but there wasn't any.  Couple bad acting with a terrible script and a resolution that was so painfully obvious early in the film, well... Don't bother.  You could better spend your time going to any high school stage production and see better acting..guaranteed.  I'm sure that years from now, cast members of this project will be investing in some liquid paper to white out their resumes if this mess is included among their credits.",1176595200,3,684,4.714285714285714
2552645,1,B000F4RHRK,"I rented this movie because I love the TV show Scrubs; more humor in medicine, right! Wrong.

First of all, they must have done about 2 seconds of research for this movie because the inaccuracies are amazing. Everyone in the hospital is a surgeon yet they are apparently out of surgical masks. And Dave, interns ARE real live MDs not students. Which none of this would have bothered me as much if the movie had been funny.

The acting is atrocious. Dave Foley looks bored out of his skull the entire movie, Thomas seems to be doing a bad impersanation of Dr. Kelso from Scrubs, and the supporting actors need to return to work at the Waffle House effective immediately. The main ""cool guy"" in the film is a complete dork, the black guy is a total stereotype, and the girls all seem like they'd be happier gold-digging or tanning somewhere. Their interactions with each other are mind numbing.

Jokes? Jokes you ask? A few stale ones here and there, but for the most part the actors just sit around and complain to each other. Very, very boring.

The previous two reviewers were probably hired by whatever company distributed this direct to DVD garbage. I notice them pushing the SCTV connection, but Akroyd and Thomas are a very minor part of this movie and I don't think I laughed out loud once, except when the dorky kid was in the stripper's room. Not worth watching for one minor chuckle.",1155340800,2,1392,4.578313253012048
2552646,4,B000F4RHRK,"I have to say that this movie was better than I expected. Any time I see a compelation of fairly prominent comedians that have not been so prominent, I worry. This movie has Dave foley (kids in the hall, News radio), Dave thomas (stange brew), and Dan Akroyd (SNL, Coneheads, and many more).  But, they actually did a fair job at not overdoing the comedy.  This movie is based on a group of 3rd year interns (internship is usally a year,sometime streched to two, and interns are actual doctors) in a struggleing hospital with finacial diffuculties, as well as staffing difficulties.  They get thrown in over their heads quickly, and it funny watching them struggle.  Sure they don't wear masks in surgery, but i assume that is so we can hear the dialog better for the movie.  Dan Akroyd is the hospital administrator trying to make ends meet and literally selling the hospital away in pieces if he can.  Dave Thomas is the chief training doctor, and Dave Foley is the pompus Cardiac Surgeon.  This movie has a bit of a house of god feel to it at times, but more humor and less drama.  In the end, it all works out, or does it? you'll just have to see the movie.  Not an acadamey award winner, but not that terrible, worth a view if you like a little medical humor .",1154044800,2,1265,4.418103448275862
2552647,5,B000F4RHRK,"If you want a good laugh, rent it. You'll laugh like you haven't laughed before. There's many funny parts. There's at least one or two parts that are somewhat disgusting but not really. It's a really good movie, so I highly recommend it. :D",1106352000,,240,4.4772727272727275

If you liked the TV show ""Scrubs"", this is a raunchy take on that. If you don't like Scrubs, or if you don't like raunchy adult humor, and if you don't like to laugh, then don't watch!",1427587200,,322,4.126984126984127

There were a few funny moments in this (such as when they did the saliva swabs and looked at them under the microscope). Otherwise, this flick was not worth watching.",1314403200,,288,4.142857142857143
8117686,4,B000F4RHRK,Saw this movie on tv and only caught the end of it so i bought it to see the rest. I think it is a very funny movie. A bit like scrubs but that wasn't a problem for me.,1277510400,,168,3.3333333333333335

8117688,3,B000F4RHRK,"If this film were released in 1986, there would be those calling it a cult, 80's B-movie classic, with everyone trying to find a copy of the out of print VHS, or clamoring for it's DVD release.  It's an out and out throwback to the SCTV/Hamburger: The Motion Picture/Revenge of the Nerds days of 80's comedy, and taken on that level, it works really well.  It has your typical laugh out loud scenes, along with those that make you cringe and the ""what the heck were they thinking"" bits.  The acting is spot on, considering the absurdity of the scenarios these medical interns get themselves into.  Also, the cast spits out dialogue at a very swift pace, making it a watchable film throughout.  Sure, lots of the jokes are duds, and they unnecessarily overplay some of the gore found in the medical field, but your side splitting laughs are a plenty and enough to leave you feeling entertained in the end.

Definitely one to check out, if you miss all those crazy, sophomoric comedies of the 80's.",1217376000,3,996,4.598870056497175
8117689,1,B000F4RHRK,"...to cover up how much of a Scrubs rip-off this is.  First of all, there's the title, which is about as close as you can get without stealing.  Then there are the characters.  You have the geeky white doctor with goofy hair who somehow manages to be popular despite being a dork.  There's the charismatic black doctor who acts tough but is really a wimp.  There's the slutty doctor who sleeps with the geeky doctor. Dave Foley plays a less witty, less likeable Dr. Cox.  Dave Thomas and Dan Akroyd's characters are pretty much both different sides of Dr. Kelso.  The only thing that's missing is a creepy janitor and some of the more absurd fantasy sequences from Scrubs.  The humor never gets any more intelligent than jokes like, ""How did a sperm cell get in your mouth?"" and ""Sexually active?  No, I just lie there.""  If you think you can stand watching a really bad, 90 minute long episode of Scrubs, then by all means watch this movie.",1216080000,2,941,4.514792899408284
