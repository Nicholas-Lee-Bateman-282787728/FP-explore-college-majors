8350713,5,B0024NL906,"When reviewing a film such as Birdemic: Shock and Terror, it can be hard to know where to start. Certainly, no modern film fan is going to need an introduction to the work of highly acclaimed director JamesNguyen (Replica, Julie and Jack, Birdemic II: The Resurrection) and they'd have to have been living on the moon to have avoided the infectious hype juggernaut that always accompanies the announcement of a new Nguyen venture.

Given this, there seems little point in not beginning the review with the answer to the question that's been on every serious cinemaphile's lips for well over a year. That answer is Yes;Birdemic: Shock and Terror is another Nguyen masterpiece.

The movie tells the story of young lovers Rod (Alan Bagh) and Nathalie (Whitney Moore) and their harrowing struggle for survival in a small town beset by avian aggressors. With a screenplay so remarkably well crafted as that ofBirdemic: Shock and Terror, it takes remarkable restraint for a reviewer not to go into the minutiae of every beautifully executed twist and turn of the narrative, simply through enthusiam for its beauty. It would be an unpardonable sin for me to steal the wonder of discovery from any future viewers by venturing into such spoiler-laden territory and so, as much as it pains me, I will steer clear of such details. It is clear from the opening credits though that the movie is special. In exploring the origins of the central romance between the protagonists, Nguyen makes sure to take his time. By labouring so carefully over the development of his characters, when they encounter the inevitable peril of the titular Birdemic the viewer has no choice but to feel a very real kinship with them, experiencing vicariously the horrors to which they're subjected. By taking the time to document the banal elements of Rod's day to day routine (pulling out of his driveway, putting petrol in his car, opening doors) the contrast of the white knuckle thrill ride to come is all the more keenly experienced. Nguyen's revolutionary technique of allowing the camera to switch with every line of dialogue and focus on the speaker espouses a hyper-realist aesthetic seldom seem outside of art house cinema. Nguyen uses it in what is, in every sense, a blockbuster movie without missing a beat. This
vrit approach is mirrored in the very clay with which Nguyen sculpts his work. By disregarding modern, expensive cameras and oft-relied upon tools such as tripods and directional microphones in favour of more basic equipment, the director succeeds most admirably in breaking down the wall of cinematic sheen that so often serves to distance a narrative from its audience.

In contrast to the use of more basic recording equipment, it should be noted that the special effects inBirdemic: Shock and Terror rank up there with the greatest the big screen has ever seen. From the stunning parrot scene early on to the remarkable bird attack on the car, the CGI is impeccable. It's testament to the lifelike quality of the work that I spent the majority of the film wondering how they were able to train such large quantities of birds to perform on film. Indeed, it was only the breathtaking scale of the climactic scenes that brought me to the realisation that the birds were computer generated. I am still unable to decide if the flame effects were digital or produced through burning scale models of the sets.

I must also address a concern that was expressed by many critics in the preproduction stage of Birdemic: Shock and Terror; namely, the casting. Many felt that by putting household names such as Alan Bagh (Ghost Shark II: Urban Jaws) and Whitney Moore (Student of Virginity) in the leading roles, Nguyen would undermine the individuality of the movie. Let me assure you that any such concern is allayed instantly by the quality of both actors' performances. As people are so fond of saying about Leonard's di Caprio, I have found myself wondering aloud before how these two cinematic greats have been passed up for recognition by The Academy in the past. Given the performances of both inBirdemic: Shock and Terror, this question becomes less a bemusing oversight and more a crime of modern cinema.

As a small footnote, it would be remiss of me to discuss the casting ofBirdemic: Shock and Terror without making mention of the contribution of that darling of the contemporary music press, Damien Carter. Not only does Damien contribute several songs to the already stellar soundtrack ofBirdemic: Shock and Terror, he also has a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo in the memorably touching nightclub scene performing his global hit, 'Just Hanging Out'.

To summarise,Birdemic: Shock and Terror is not only going to be remembered as the best film of 2010, but as a true zeitgeist event in world cinema. It is perhaps all the more remarkable that, in producing a film which pays such a clear homage to Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, Nguyen has managed to usurp the former's place as the greatest commercial director to ever grace the chair.",1380412800,,5032,4.942080378250591
8350714,1,B0024NL906,"Yes, one star for the worst film I have seen in years....and years....and years. I made the mistake of purchasing this on blu-ray. BLU-RAY for heaven's sake! This is more amaturish than a film I made at six years old with a 16mm bell and howell. Looks as if the film-makers are attempting to beat Ed Wood's ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" for the worst film made. Wood's film IS terrible - but certainly it is technically hands and feet above this garbage. I would give a terrible movie (but one fun for that reason) five stars if there was a serious attempt to present a film with any technical merit. Absolutely nothing in this film shows techincal adequacy. The soundtrack is full of sound mismatching - or total dropouts. The special effects (eagles or whatever) are so laughable that it seems the film-makers are relying on people to see the film (or review it here) just for the fun of seeing something truly crappy (and that's very kind, indeed.) Watching this film is difficult due to its techincal inadequacy - specially the sound. Watch ten minutes for a laugh at how horrible a film can be. Then go on to better things (which will be so easy you won't have to even think about it.) But don't praise and give credit to film-makers who obviously intend to make a terrible movie hoping to get praise for a ""so bad it's good"" film when they really show no talent and certainly do a disservice to the film's actors and to its audience.",1315440000,5,1435,4.480916030534351

And oh, the Blu-ray looks like crap. You've been warned.",1313884800,2,237,4.266666666666667
8350716,1,B0024NL906,"This is one of the few films that deserves a ""negative"" star. After seeing this train wreck of a movie, I had to pause and really think hard as to who is the worst director in cinema history: Ed Wood or James Nguyen. It's almost a tie but at least Ed Wood is more entertaining.

I don't know what the hell Nguyen was thinking. The actors are so horrible; it's clear to me that casting for this movie took place at the local mall. And what's with the sound going out during a scene change? That was becoming really annoying very fast. Oh, the special effects are something in class of their own. I'm not lying when I say this: the eagles and vultures were copied and pasted all over the screen when they attacked. In fact, they never really attacked. They just hovered and swayed while a sound clip of an eagle played in the background. Even worse, the birds didn't even look like they were part of the movie. Each bird looked like it was put over the film much like one would place acetate over a piece of paper.

The mayor of the city should have revoked Nguyen's permits. I'm serious.

Please don't waste your time buying or renting this turd. Trust me when I say this.",1287705600,4,1171,4.3136363636363635
8350717,1,B0024NL906,"Birdemic: Shock and Terror (James Nguyen, 2008)

I have seen many, many bad movies over the years. Many. Hundreds, perhaps thousands. And of those, there are a select few that are so indomitably awful that they transcend bad and achieve a sort of awful greatness, a train wreck effect that compels you to watch the movie over and over again, trying to make sense of it. Night of the Lepus. Beware! The Blob!.  Shriek of the Mutilated. I'm sure you can come up with another dozen of your favorites. Add to that list the second half of Birdemic: Shock and Terror. I mean, when people rush into your convenience store and scream ""the eagles killed my friends!"", and you've been hearing reports about killer eagles on the radio all day, wouldn't you think your first reaction would be to go to the front door and remove the prop holding it open? But no, folks. That's the kind of genius that was involved in putting this mess together.

The first half of this abyss of stupidity is actually a romance, not a horror flick. Rod (Alan Bagh in, thankfully, his only screen role) is a software salesman who runs into a high school classmate, Nathalie (Student of Virginity's Whitney Moore), who's become a fashion model, by chance in a diner. After a painfully awkward meeting scene that encompasses everything one shouldn't do in a meeting scene, they begin dating, etc., etc. There are a couple of foreshadowing moments that something will go wrong (and as soon as you hit the first one, you'll know you're trapped in yet another horrendous ecohorror movie with a MESSAGE), but for the most part, it's played as a straight drama/romance. Fifty minutes into the movie, however, it switches direction into ecohorror. The opening piece of this half of the movie is so badly done that I defy anyone to see it without laughing in near-hysterical disbelief. It is at this point that the movie transcends is horrible beginnings and becomes worthy of sticking on your short shelf of movies so truly awful that you can't help but love them. I've seen CGI this bad in a handful of Sci-Fi Channel Original Movies, but I've never seen any worse. The acting is horrible (as it was in the first half), but more notably, the actions taken by the characters are invariably idiotic. (The not-closing-the-door thing in the opening paragraph? Tip of the iceberg, baby.) And when you get to the final scene, please resist the urge to throw things at the television. You don't want to break your screen.

Like all movies that find themselves on the list, it lacks any redeeming qualities whatsoever. If you are not appreciative of cheesy movies, do yourself a favor and stay far, far away from this one. If, however, you can appreciate the demented (sub-mental?) genius involved in the crafting of such braindead classics as Kingdom of the Spiders, then this is one you need to see. Stick it out through the first forty-five minutes, though, and you will be amply rewarded. ",1273622400,39,2946,4.734892787524366

Also, this is the best movie to drink to you've ever seen. This movie is funny, engaging, and has possibly the worst sound editing ever EVER. More than a drama or acton movie this movie's senseless everything is beyond fantastic and a combination of genres which defy categorization. Last but not least I'd like to say birdemic is a movie close to my heart not just because it is so effing awesome, but because Whitney Moore (who is very close in my heart) is the protagonist and looks great in that turquoise underwear.
