8333851,1,B001PMATGC,"YOU PROBABLY WON'T WANT TO PUBLISH THIS I returned this DVD (second time) because it only played for about 30 seconds and would stop and repeat from the beginning.  This happened both times.  I received credit for the first I returned (as yet have not received credit for the second that was returned on the 21st of March)After consulting with two stores in Cedar Rapids that sold DVDs, I was informed that DVDs displaying the code on the back of the DVD, that it wouldn't play on our players in this part of the country.  I explained this in a letter sent with the DVD and assume the credit will be forthcoming, if the same hasn't already been done.  FYI - neither store I researched had the right one either.  I definitely want one that will play so if you have one, I'd gladly accept it; however, please confirm at your earliest convenience if you'll be sending it to me.",1238371200,,874,4.4375
8333852,5,B001PMATGC,"Hearing them is spectacular.... put seeing them talking and singing, adds the extra touch. I don't think I'll  cover the mousepad with a mouse but it sits on my desk, so I can enjoy looking at these great looking guys, whenever I'm at the computer.  And don't they dress well!  Sort of gentleman chic.  I have the same picture as my desktop theme but that's always covered over with stuff like this.",1236124800,,399,4.5
