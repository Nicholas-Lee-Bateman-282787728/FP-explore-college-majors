3829450,5,B001Y7CVZU,In this season Ichigo learns how to use bankai so this is my favorite part of the beginning seasons... i would suggest buying this box set vol. if you are a bleach fan,1247529600,,167,4.090909090909091
3829451,5,B001Y7CVZU,Bleach is a fun filled action packed anime that adds suspense and emotion. The action scenes are fun and exciting which make your heart race. The english voice acting is amazing and it shows that the producers want to make this closest to the original japanese. This box set it the best yet and anyone who likes story and great character development should pic this up anime and non-anime fan alike.,1243728000,2,399,4.633802816901408
3829452,5,B001Y7CVZU,"Bleach itself is great, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who spent several sleepless nights waiting for season 3 to come out, but since the set is new, it's hideously overpriced. I suggest that you wait till the price goes down before you buy this. Seasons 1 and 2 are floating at around $30 in price, and season 3 will get there too, but it might take until season 4 comes out for the price to drop, because by then season 3 will be yesterdays news and you'll get it at a great price.",1240617600,4,486,4.072916666666667
3829453,5,B001Y7CVZU,"Now that they've gotten into the Soul Society and the Seireitei, Ichigo and Co. have ANOTHER problem: rescuing Rukia and escaping with their body parts intact.

Unfortunately, it's not going to be that easy. ""Bleach: The Rescue"" kicks everything about this brilliant anime up a notch -- lots of blood, sword-fights, a fiery climax at the execution grounds, and some amazing character development. But the best part is that the treacherous conspiracy merely hinted at in prior episodes, which sparks a minor civil war within the Seireitei.

Yoruichi starts the badly-wounded Ichigo on a special new training regimen -- to rescue Rukia, he must achieve achieve bankai (the ultimate release of a zanpakuto) in three days. In the meantime, Uryu has encountered the most horrendous of Soul Reapers, who is responsible for the death of a loved one, and Captain Hitsugaya is confronted by an old friend who tries to kill him -- accusing him of murdering Captain Aizen.

But the chaos really starts when Rukia's execution day rolls around: mass murder is revealed, captains turn against one another, and Renji fights a devastating battle against the implacable Byakuya. Ichigo appears on the execution hill with devastating new power -- intent on rescuing Rukia and defeating her brother once and for all. But when he seems to be losing, a horrific new change comes over him.

And in the meantime, the conspiracy that's ripping apart the Soul Reapers is revealed -- the identify of the Big Bad and his sidekicks, the reason he wants Rukia dead, and how many people he'll coldly destroy to get what he wants.

""Bleach: The Rescue"" is a turning point for the entire series -- everything before it has built to this point, and everything in the future will spring from it. For an action anime, it is also quite heavy on the plot as it sets up the Big Bad: faked murders, real murders, conspiracies, hypnotic tricks, betrayals, a clever triple-cross perpetrated by Gin Ichimaru, and Urahara's hidden motive in helping Rukia.

There's also lots of brilliantly explosive action using ice dragons, black fire, razor-sharp cherry blossoms, exploding Soul Reapers, a giant bone-snake, and a firebird the size of a submarine. The action only serves to underscore the tension that is building throughout the entire season, until it explodes on Sokyoku Hill. It's also got solid dialogue, some quiet moments for Ichigo's pals (hanging out in prison) and some flashbacks to Renji, Rukia, Kira and Momo's days at the Academy.

Fortunately, all this dark stuff is speckled with funny moments like Ichigo's relaxation in a healing spring (""I AM GOING TO DROWN YOU!""), and an entire episode in which the characters unwind and recover after the events of ""the rescue.""

Our Hero really shows his stuff in this season -- Ichigo puts his life on the line to reach an incredible level of spiritual power, and rescue Rukia no matter what happens. Too bad he turns out to have a freaky dark side (and Johnny Yong Bosch has a brilliant demon cackle). And Uryu inadvertently gets to the bottom of his grandfather's death, and goes to devastating lengths to get revenge for what happened to him.

But most of the characters get to shine in this, although Chad and Orihime are somewhat neglected: the Yoruichi-obsessed Soi Fon, the kindly Ukitake and his best buddy Kyoraku, the happily hyperaggressive Zaraki, boy-genius Hitsugaya, and the fusty and arrogant Head Captain Yamamoto (among many others). We also learn how far Renji will go for Rukia, as well as the true reason why Byakuya has been so cold and seemingly cruel.

As for the limited edition, the big collectible toy bonus that differs from the regular one is apparently... a Hollow mask. Given the storyline here, I presume it's one belonging to a certain orange-haired teen.

""Bleach: The Rescue"" is a brilliant arc of action-packed, tightly-wound anime, with a shocking twist at the core of the story. Definitely a must-see -- especially for everything that comes later.",1238544000,20,4001,4.965620328849028

3829497,3,B001Y7CVZU,"After the battle with Byakuya ends, Ichigo is forced to retreat when one of his companions intervene. Ichigo is warned that the elder Kuchiki is on a level of spiritual power that far surpasses him despite now being on the power level of a Captain. For Ichigo to stand a chance against him, he must engage in a training regimen to unlock the second form of his sword. This art is called Bankai.

Bankai is when a Soul Reaper summons the essence of his sword into a physical form, thus increasing his power to levels that reads off the charts. This is an art that only the Captains have mastered with 10 years of training. Ichigo has only 3 days to master the art. Time is working against him due to Rukia's execution date being moved up.-summary

This chapter is a step up when compared to the second arc, but it's still only about average due to predictability, complete lack of originality, and very annoying pacing issues. Bleach has clearly proven to be just another shonen series that doesn't stray very far at all from many of its genre. Normally, I don't knock a series for the lack of originality, since to a certain degree no idea is original. However, one fight scene grated on my nerves heavily, because it was clearly ripped from Yu Yu Hakusho with absolutely no shame at all. I actually stopped and shook my head on that one. It actually effected my overall rating a lot.

Ignoring that stolen element, Bleach still has things dragging it down in which the average Bleach fan loves to pretend doesn't exist; but I'll get to those negatives when necessary. First off, the story element concerning the swords is very interesting, and it helped deliver some very entertaining battles. I have to admit for the most part I was satisfied with them. Although it was done before in a different way; I believe it was done better here, and once again there's more background delivered to develop the characters. Plus in the process create a new rivalry between side characters.

This chapter features plenty of battles that takes place amongst the Captains. Most of the characters have some interesting abilities that did impress me some. However, I do believe some of these battles didn't reach their full potential one bit. This is mainly due to the serious pacing issues concerning speeches, meaningless flashbacks, and other conflicts taking place.

Having breaks in a plot takes a certain skill that only a select few anime series were able to pull off convincingly; but when a series takes a break from a battle that is heavily built up, to deliver meaningless interactions between side characters that do not push the plot. The plot itself is going to suffer, and Bleach uses this approach only to prolong episodes in order to make the series longer. I do not care for this formula. Dragon Ball Z has this down to a science, and I been burned out by this style for years.

The series is very predictable all the way down to its dual plot and plot twist. I blame this mishap on the formulaic and by the numbers writing. It was very difficult not to see this coming. I also have an issue with the character deaths. I really don't like when a character dies dramatically only to return or isn't killed at all. If a character isn't going to stay dead for good, then leave the drama at the door. Most of the time a series will become a joke due to this repeated plot element. The ghosts of Dragon Ball Z resurface often in this series.

The animation is by far the best this time around. The fight scenes are well animated and they deliver some cool battles at times. However, only when they don't rely on reused cels, in the form of the ""super speed that is unseen by the naked eye"" approach.

The visuals at times are something to brag about with some amazing artwork. The soundtrack is still solid with new opening and ending themes once again. I find the new opening theme ""Ichirimo Hana"" performed by High and Mighty Color to be good, but not on par with the previous songs. On the other hand, the ending theme Life performed by Yui, contains some very nice vocals, and I enjoyed it the best when compared to the previous end songs. The same as its predecessors: the voice acting is still pretty good, the violence is still high but not very brutal, and the fan service is still low.

Overall, I'll say the ending is wrapped up well and Bleach: The Rescue isn't a failure. Unfortunately, the series as a whole up to this point is very flawed. Bleach really doesn't attempt to break away from the pack at all. This series is massively over rated and incredibly over-hyped. I only recommend this to those whom love those long running shonen series such as One Piece, Dragonball Z, Inuyasha,  Naruto, or even D. Gray-Man.

I will also continue recommending it to those whom made it this far, and are already sold on the action and characters. Others whom are searching for something action packed, but want something a lot shorter could try anything else out there such as the Fullmetal Alchemist franchise or Yu Yu Hakusho. Bleach: The Rescue is 550 minutes containing episodes 42-63.

Pros: Captains vs. Captains, nice visuals, arc ends pretty strong

Cons: Issues with a majority of the writing. Is that you Yusuke?",1428105600,,5225,4.611410118406889

I really enjoyed this season and look forward to what happens next (except for season 4 is in 2 parts and well as 7 discs long).

-Some of the Capts and Lts join forces with Ichigo and his group to fight a common enemy (not going to spoil it).
-Twists and turns throughout the season versus Season One was 'learn this and this is what is going on.'
-There is a few Captain vs. Captain fights that I thought was phenomenal to watch and the detail that goes into it.

-A major plus with this season is most of the Captain's zanpakutoes are revealed in this season (minus Kenpacki Zaraki since he can't call his)",1358985600,,776,4.236486486486487

Can Ichigo and the others save her life and stop the traitor from getting the key he needs to turn both worlds upside down? We're gonna find out in Bleach season 3.",1351468800,,345,4.164179104477612
3829556,4,B001Y7CVZU,"Now that they've gotten into the Soul Society and the Seireitei, Ichigo and Co. have ANOTHER problem: rescuing Rukia and escaping with their body parts intact.

Unfortunately, it's not going to be that easy. ""Bleach: The Rescue"" kicks everything about this brilliant anime up a notch -- lots of blood, sword-fights, a fiery climax at the execution grounds, and some amazing character development. But the best part is that the treacherous conspiracy merely hinted at in prior episodes, which sparks a minor civil war within the Seireitei.

Yoruichi starts the badly-wounded Ichigo on a special new training regimen -- to rescue Rukia, he must achieve achieve bankai (the ultimate release of a zanpakuto) in three days. In the meantime, Uryu has encountered the most horrendous of Soul Reapers, who is responsible for the death of a loved one, and Captain Hitsugaya is confronted by an old friend who tries to kill him -- accusing him of murdering Captain Aizen.

But the chaos really starts when Rukia's execution day rolls around: mass murder is revealed, captains turn against one another, and Renji fights a devastating battle against the implacable Byakuya. Ichigo appears on the execution hill with devastating new power -- intent on rescuing Rukia and defeating her brother once and for all. But when he seems to be losing, a horrific new change comes over him.

And in the meantime, the conspiracy that's ripping apart the Soul Reapers is revealed -- the identify of the Big Bad and his sidekicks, the reason he wants Rukia dead, and how many people he'll coldly destroy to get what he wants.

""Bleach: The Rescue"" is a turning point for the entire series -- everything before it has built to this point, and everything in the future will spring from it. For an action anime, it is also quite heavy on the plot as it sets up the Big Bad: faked murders, real murders, conspiracies, hypnotic tricks, betrayals, a clever triple-cross perpetrated by Gin Ichimaru, and Urahara's hidden motive in helping Rukia.

There's also lots of brilliantly explosive action using ice dragons, black fire, razor-sharp cherry blossoms, exploding Soul Reapers, a giant bone-snake, and a firebird the size of a submarine. The action only serves to underscore the tension that is building throughout the entire season, until it explodes on Sokyoku Hill. It's also got solid dialogue, some quiet moments for Ichigo's pals (hanging out in prison) and some flashbacks to Renji, Rukia, Kira and Momo's days at the Academy.

Fortunately, all this dark stuff is speckled with funny moments like Ichigo's relaxation in a healing spring (""I AM GOING TO DROWN YOU!""), and an entire episode in which the characters unwind and recover after the events of ""the rescue.""

Our Hero really shows his stuff in this season -- Ichigo puts his life on the line to reach an incredible level of spiritual power, and rescue Rukia no matter what happens. Too bad he turns out to have a freaky dark side (and Johnny Yong Bosch has a brilliant demon cackle). And Uryu inadvertently gets to the bottom of his grandfather's death, and goes to devastating lengths to get revenge for what happened to him.

But most of the characters get to shine in this, although Chad and Orihime are somewhat neglected: the Yoruichi-obsessed Soi Fon, the kindly Ukitake and his best buddy Kyoraku, the happily hyperaggressive Zaraki, boy-genius Hitsugaya, and the fusty and arrogant Head Captain Yamamoto (among many others). We also learn how far Renji will go for Rukia, as well as the true reason why Byakuya has been so cold and seemingly cruel.

""Bleach: The Rescue"" is a brilliant arc of action-packed, tightly-wound anime, with a shocking twist at the core of the story. Definitely a must-see -- especially for everything that comes later.",1350950400,,3788,4.960567823343848
3829557,5,B001Y7CVZU,This is where I decided that Bleach is one of the greatest animes ever. The story in this show is very powerful. I am however very disappointed in the way it as of rite now ended. I will not spoil it for everyone but I will say that after watching the beginning of the last season for them to end the season with us having to watch that bull shit was very cruel to all who know how great bleach is. Considering all the changes everyone had went through how could they end the show without creating a new plot. But besides that I would say bleach is definitely in the top 4 animes of all time.,1347408000,,592,4.068376068376068

The fansubs that are done by fans for free probably have better quality subtitles based on my experience with Naruto.  The anime itself is 5 stars and the menus are cool, but there was obviously no proof reading done on the subs whatsoever.  Just horrible.",1296950400,,466,4.775
3829564,3,B001Y7CVZU,"I liked the third season, however not as much as the first two. Ichigo finally achieves bankai sort of by cheating, but who would expect anything less than for him to go above and beyond? Instead of taking the 10 years it normally takes, he does it in a couple of days. Ichigo is badly out matched skill wise in every battle and he goes up against captains and experienced soul reapers but wins every time. There's a pretty predictable pattern here. It was entertaining as always, but as an avid IchiRukia fan I was quite disappointed that those two never became an item. Oh well, imagine what kind of complications would lie ahead in story boarding if the story would have gone that direction. It was always meant to be about the action and fighting instead of a love story. Still a huge fan, but the first season was by far the best in my opinion.",1289088000,2,849,4.414012738853503

The conclusion to this amasing arc, can only be described with one word, perfect. Most of the dialoge was good. At some points I got annoyed how they used the same actor or actress for multiple characters, but it can't be helped. The speacial features were average, but that was to be expected. The art work was, as the review title suggests, AWSOME!!!! The action was really well done and perfect for all you action anime fans.

3829569,4,B001Y7CVZU,"Bleach: The Rescue Season Three box set is a five disc set that contains twenty-two episodes.  The first three discs contain four episodes and bonus features, while the fourth and fifth discs contain five episodes and bonus features.  When it comes to episodes on this set, my favorites were on the last disc; there were a lot of unexpected twists and turns in the plot in the last few episodes on the set.  As a viewer, I found myself looking forward to where the story would go next, and what secrets would be revealed.

On the first disc, there are four extras.  The first extra is ""Production Art,"" which is twenty pages on line art of the characters that appear on the disc.  The second feature is ""Manga Preview,"" which includes three pages of advertisements for the Bleach manga, as well as other titles released by Shonen Jump.  The next feature is ""Clean Ending,"" which is a textless version of the first closing theme that appears in this box set.  The final extra on the disc is labeled as ""Sneak Peak,"" which contains trailers for Naruto and The Prince of Tennis.

The second disc has production art, which is eighteen pages of line art of the characters that appear on the disc.  The ""Manga Preview"" and ""Clean Ending"" are the exact same features that appear on the first disc.  The ""Sneak Peeks"" on this disc are trailers for Naruto the Movie 2: The Legend of the Stone of Gelel and Bleach the Movie: Memories of Nobody.

The production art on disc three is eighteen pages of line art of the characters that appear on the disc.  The ""Manga Preview"" on this disc is four pages instead of three.  The ""Clean Ending"" is a textless version of the second closing theme that appears in this box set.  The ""Sneak Peeks"" on this disc are trailers for three Naruto video games and the Bleach: Dark Souls video game.

The fourth disc has production art, which is twenty-two pages of line art of the characters that appear on this disc.  The ""Manga Preview"" and the ""Clean Ending"" are the exact same features that appear on disc three.  The ""Sneak Peeks"" on this disc are trailers for Bleach the Movie: Memories of Nobody, the Bleach: Dark Souls video game, and five Naruto video games.

The first extra on the fifth disc is the ""Behind the Scenes of Bleach"" documentary.  This feature runs for approximately eleven minutes, and includes interviews with the English dub actors for Ganju and Aizen, Female Yoruichi (who is also the Voice Director for the series), Gin, Zangetsu, Orihime and Isane, and Ichigo.  The second extra is labeled as ""Kon's U.S. Tour.""  This feature has someone dressed in a Kon suit, and is narrated by Kon.  Over the course of this thirteen-minute feature, Kon is seen in New York before the premiere of the Bleach movie, at the premiere, at the Viz Media after party, at Niagara Falls, at Mt. Rushmore, in Washington, D.C., in New Orleans, at the Grand Canyon, at the St. Louis Arch, in Las Vegas, in San Francisco (at the Viz Media headquarters), and in San Diego (at Viz Media's booth at Comicon).  The production art is nineteen pages of line art of the characters that appear on this disc.  The ""Manga Preview"" and ""Clean Ending"" are the same as what appears on discs three and four.  The ""Sneak Peeks"" are trailers for Naruto Shippuden, Bleach the Movie: Memories of Nobody, the Bleach: Dark Souls video game, and three Naruto video games.

While I expected the repetition of the bonus features based on what I'd seen on the first two box sets, I was still rather disappointed at how predictable the features were.  I also still find myself wondering why textless versions of the opening themes weren't included; this would have at least helped minimize some of the repetition of the bonus features.  Even though I was disappointed by the bonus features, I would still recommend this box set to anyone who is a fan of the Bleach anime series.

In order to write this review, my husband purchased a copy of this DVD box set as a gift for me.",1283212800,2,3975,4.605113636363637

3829572,5,B001Y7CVZU,"I've been waiting two seasons to get to the fight between Ichigo and Byakuya. As usual, if you're expecting just a simple fight or two,  you're going to be disappointed. This series is complex, and you really can't just jump in and watch it and catch all the subtleties of what's going on. Season three continues to give us the backstories of the Captains of the Gotei Thirteen as Ichigo struggles to learn Bankai. I love the way that Tite Kubo leaves nothing to chance and crafts distinct personalities for each and every member of the supporting cast. Odds are, there's a character that you're going to love for each type of person watching the show.

Parents:
As usual, if you abhor bloodshed, then you're going to want to skip this one. However, you will be missing out. They don't show any more than your average movie at the theater these days, and older kids will appreciate this because this cartoon doesn't assume that they're to stupid to understand complex stories. In fact, I feel that this is one of the series most endearing characteristics. It is NOT simplistic. The characters aren't always right, or perfect. They make mistakes and have flaws just like we do. The violence is not excessive, but this is a show about sword wielding Death Gods(Shinigami). If you don't want to see that kind of violence, then I might suggest something like Teen Titans as a suitable alternative.

It was an emotional roller coaster right up until the end. I've been waiting three seasons for Ichigo to rescue Rukia. I have to say that I was not disappointed in the least. I don't think fans of the show will be either.",1278633600,2,1616,4.643356643356643

The scene in which Ichigo takes out four squad lieutenants bare-handle was great. The real surprise is the identity of the ""traitor"" in the Soul Society to learn that a character with whom I thought was a noble person
is an accomplice to the conspiracy.  All in all ""The Rescue"" did not bog down like spots during Season 2.

The story line is spectacular the action is amazing you will love it believe me and even though it has tons of action it has time to find the funny side of things wheather it be Ichigo got his Zanpaktou stuck in a wall or his crazy dad attaked him while he was sleeping or Karin smacks her dad for being dumb. It is also one of those shows that will catch you off guard and hae you on the edge of your seats or if your  like me you fell off your seat right onthe floor.

Please add the numbers of the episodes included in each product release. This is a fine series and very enjoyable.

3829583,5,B001Y7CVZU,"If you have not been following this on adult swim, this is your chance to catch up (or begin) on one of Japan's most popular exports. Bleach is supernatural anime at its best. Its equal parts horror, action, laughs and more action. While geared to teenage boys (shonen), it is still lots of enjoyable viewing for all. Im a huge fan of the show having started watching its current season (season 5).

Not to be missed.",1255305600,,417,4.4868421052631575
3829584,5,B001Y7CVZU,I bought seasons 1 and 2 before buying this one. I recommend you buy those first if you have not already. Season 3 is where the action truly kicks off and the series get interesting. The DVD set itself has two cards with artwork on them inside.. Im not sure if they're randomly selected but I had Ichigo and Hitsugaya in mine. Packaged well. You're reading my review which means your interested in the Limited Edition Hollow Mask. I pondered for a bit if it was worth paying the extra for and now I am glad I did get it. Excellent quality mask.. Thick material with a heavy base/stand. The stand is a Substitute soul reaper badge. The mask is hung by a metal rod with a eye shaped metal piece on it. The mask fits perfectly onto the eye slot so its not shaky and you don't have to worry about it falling or wobbling. It won't move at all. High quality.,1254268800,,852,4.233128834355829
3829585,5,B001Y7CVZU,Bleach is a great show. I am not an anime lover but I always look forward to seeing this one.,1253923200,,93,3.7
3829586,4,B001Y7CVZU,its a great show ... iv been folowing it for a verry long time now and i bought this to add to my colection just bc its my fave season but right arount when renji unleashes his banki it glitches and freezes which sucks bc the begining of kempachi's fight with captian tozen starts right in the middle of the glitch which is EXTREAMLY FRUSTRATING but all in all its a great series and i highly recomend it for all anime fans!!!,1253750400,,426,4.2073170731707314
3829587,5,B001Y7CVZU,"As Far as Anime goes, this is by far one of the best. I recommend this series to anyone who loves anime. Season 3 is just as awesome as seasons one and two. I can't wait for the rest of the series to be released.",1252972800,,212,3.7333333333333334
3829588,5,B001Y7CVZU,"The last set on soul society, the main antagonist AIZEN rises with ease! This is my favorite arc of soul society, lots of action! recommended! Hollow mask was really cool!!",1252713600,,172,4.766666666666667
3829589,5,B001Y7CVZU,"Bleach: The Resuce continues immediately after the ending the previous boxset Bleach: The Entry.  Before I continue, I will say that newcomers to the Bleach series will most likely want to either start with the previous boxset.  It is possible to enter into the Bleach universe at the first episode in this set but there are so many characters presented here and Bleach mythos that it may be quite difficult to catch up.

Where this set opens up is immediately after the end of the previous set which had Ichigo finally reach Rukia.  He meets up with Byakuya Kuchiki but the transformed Yoruichi evades Byakuya and escapes with Ichigo to train him for a future encounter with Byakuya.

This season raises the bar on the Bleach universe by finally introducing many of the other members of the court guard of the soul society.  The greater plot theme that has been running since the entry into the soul society is also encountered.  The final 5 episodes are the most CRUCIAL to this boxset and present many answers to burning questions.

This set also contains the most anticipated fight in the Bleach universe.

Boxset wise, there are 22 episodes in this set spanning five discs.  Three discs contain four episodes respectively and the final two discs both contain five episodes respectively. The previous boxset decorated the disc with red artwork, this set uses blue artwork.  Bonuses included are two Bleach postcard type items.  I think I would rather have preferred to receive a poster, since you can never have too many Ichigo posters. Overlooking each of the disc are larger sized pieces of artwork featuring a major character of the episodes at hand.

Audiowise, two opening themes are used.  The first few episodes continue to use the amazing theme ""D-technolife"" by Uverworld.  The next opening used is ""One Lone Flower"" (I prefer to call it Ichirin no Hana) by High and Mighty Color.  The ending themes are the odd ""Happy People"" by Skoop on Somebody and Yui's Life.  Background music does not seem to have been change nor anything else added to any of the scenes.

English Audio and Japanese audio are both included.  Bonuses include ""Kon's US Tour"" (feature of Kon going around the United States), and ""Behind the Scenes of Bleach"" featuring Yoruichi's English voice actor, Gin's English voice actor, Zangetsu's English voice actor, and Ichigo's English voice actor.

The reason why this is the definitive Bleach experience is that there is no other way to see all of these Bleach episodes in this quality with no waiting time.  In a package such as this it is a great alternative to other methods and the production quality and bonuses make it worths its weight in gold.",1252281600,8,2683,4.839912280701754
3829590,3,B001Y7CVZU,I watched the entire set and there are many scenes on all the disks where the characters are speaking but no subtitles.  I don't speak Japanese but it was quite obvious something was missing.  I even saw one scene where the subtitles flashed very briefly and disappeared.  I don't understand how a multi million dollar company can do a worse job than some of the people out there doing the illegal fan subs.,1252108800,2,407,4.5479452054794525
3829591,4,B001Y7CVZU,"The episodes themselves, of course, are very good.  The 3rd season is excellent, and wraps up the story of Ichigo's quest to save Rukia. However, the product itself, the box, had some issues. First, the first two seasons' box sets had English text on each ""page"" - quotes from the show. This was cool, and this volume apparently continues this tradition with a slight problem - the text is in Japanese! The target audience of this box set, English-speaking audiences, can not read this text!  My second issue is the same issue I have with many products these days, the anti-theft feature. The little magnetic strip which has been adhered to some part of the product, usually hidden so it can not be easily found and removed from the product in a store, first off, has no place in a product purchased on the internet. However, it seems that the anti-theft device is being placed not just by retailers, but by manufacturers now. The magnetic strip was stuck to the inside of one of the ""pages"" and removal of it peeled away some of the cardboard and ink which it was stuck to, thus ruining the aesthetically pleasing look of the product, and even making it look kind of ""beat up"" - which is a big problem for someone like me who takes extreme care of his books and DVDs. (to the point of keeping them in book cases with closing doors to keep dust out.)

The bonus item that came with the limited edition, the Ichigo Hollow Mask, is very well made of sturdy material. The base is solid and has a good weight to it. This is not cheaply made like so many similar products, and is definitely worth buying the Limited Edition for if you have a collection of anime figures and collectibles.

So, a 4 out of 5 for this product, but with proper packaging and the abolishment of the magnetic strip that is only an impedance to paying customers, this would have gotten a 5 out of 5.",1251936000,,1870,4.443148688046647
3829592,5,B001Y7CVZU,"The Third Season of Bleach starts with Ichigo having 3 days to train in order to reach the limits of his power. The story for him, Rukia, Uryu, Renji, and the rest of the crew heats up as a rebellion occurs within Soul Society. This Season has some of the most memorable fights and moments of the series, along with the much awaited fight between Ichigo and Byakuya Kuchiki.

This product is well worth the price, and the Limited Edition Collector's Edition is a must have for die-hard fans.

The dub is one of the best for any anime, but the original Japanese version is still available for you to enjoy.",1250035200,,605,4.441441441441442

3829594,5,B001Y7CVZU,"I am not going into detail about the actual content of Season 3, except that if you are familiar with the manga, the Bleach anime so far is a pretty good adaptation.  I don't like the voices in the English version (I think they're overdone and kind of cheesy) so I have to recommend watching the Japanese versions w/subtitles, but that's just my opinion.  I must also recommend spending the extra few bucks to get the limited edition w/the collectible Hollow mask, I did and I was very pleased.  It's not a cheap flimsy piece of plastic and I have mine displayed on a shelf with my Bleach manga set and it looks very cool!  I do wish the Bleach DVD collections came with an episode guide or some sort of booklet, but that is all I have bad to say about this set (and mine came with 2 4""x6"" character pictures of Kurosaki & Hitsugaya, which was an unexpected bonus!)",1248825600,,865,4.354037267080745

Not all Box sets come with the Limited edition post card so order fast. Don't be mistaken about the post cards, they only have Hitsugaya and Ichigo.

It feature loads of amazing fights, plot twist and it reveals the main antagonist for the series. This season leaves you on the edge of your seat when friend turns on friend and when enemies become allies. A spectacular season which I recommend for anyone!",1247875200,,359,4.714285714285714
3829598,5,B001Y7CVZU,"There are plenty of well written reviews on this page and the standard box set of season 3 Uncut Bleach page that all articulate very well just how awesome this show is.  Season 3 ranks among the best (though later seasons which have aired in Japan are EVEN better, and this sesaon sets the groundwork for the later storyline.)

I am strictly going to talk about the Limited Collector's Hollow Mask which comes with this set, so you can decide if it is worth it the extra money.  Someone smarter than me will probably post the picture, or I will if I can figure out how.  It still warrants a description though, more than just a visual.

I am not usually one for ""collectible knick knack"" items found in limited edition sets, like figurines, etc.  But this is just really, really cool.

The hollow mask is very high quality, seems like it's some type of material similar to ceramic--but very solidly molded (not delicate.)  It is boldly painted, and brilliantly, is it a fragment of the mask (a ""broken"" mask piece) and comes with a display stand, the base of which is weighted and is the familiar substitute soul reaper badge.

It is not meant for cosplay, and the ""broken"" Hollow mask (it belongs to a certain character, and figures quite prominently in later seasons) is slightly smaller than the size of the dvd box set.  (It comes packaged in its own box, which is shrink-wrapped with the dvd box set.)  Again, I am not usually one for collectible items, but as a fan of the show, this was just one of the coolest possible bonus items.  The inner anime geek in me is in love with it.",1247702400,25,1588,4.475694444444445
