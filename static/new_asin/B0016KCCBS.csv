3157459,4,B0016KCCBS,"Great training DVD!!  Each move is broken down into steps and there are tips on how to execute each move correctly and safely.
I was very happy to see warm up and conditioning exercises included on the DVD. There are great exercises to help improve your form and strength-which you will definately need if you want to stay injury free!
Like another reviewer has already said, the background music selection stinks, and it gets old quick! Other than that, it is a very ""Beginner Friendly"" Pole Dance Instructional DVD. I would recommend it to anyone who would like to try Pole Dancing.",1235260800,,584,4.7254901960784315
3157460,4,B0016KCCBS,"I just started taking pole dancing classes back in November. After a month of so, only learning a new move once a week wasn't enough for me. So I decided to pick up this DVD to pick up the concepts of getting into other poses on the pole. This is a great DVD! She provides warm ups and conditioning exercises to help improve your form and she also has step-by-step instructions on how to do each move. This is great if you want to learn on your own.

Just like another reviewer noted, I thought that the pace was a little quick, so you would have to rewind to see certain sections again just to see the form and the spins.  Also, I wish that they had a different background music selection - the song that constantly plays during the fitness instruction does not feel ""sensual"" at all.  It was more...""aerobic-fitness"" like.",1233532800,2,824,4.407894736842105

I would recommend this video to anyone who is interested in pole for business, recreation, or pleasure..",1230854400,,414,4.3896103896103895
3157462,4,B0016KCCBS,"This video is great for those beginning to pole dance.  The DVD does move a little quick at times and will have to be paused repeatedily after each move to give time to practice, but KT breaks down the moves in a way that is easy to master and is absolutely excellent!  Definitely a must have for the novice pole dancer/exerciser.",1228003200,4,330,4.39344262295082

8262874,4,B0016KCCBS,"I rented this video as a review of things I've learnt at my pole classes, pick up some tips on doing the moves better and even hoped to learn a few things. I've got about 6 months experience but still a beginner.

Overall, the pace of this video seems inverted. Proper warm up and understanding of connecting moves are very important, but these sections took sooooo long vs. the actual moves/ tricks section.

The moves/ tricks section runs fast - but no faster than in a class. In my opinion, the best way to use this section is to watch the move in its entirety first - rewind for a second look if you need - and then try the move out in front of a mirror.",1354060800,3,658,4.173228346456693
8262875,3,B0016KCCBS,"This DVD is professionally produced and technically sound. I'm happy with my $9.99 online purchase, but after viewing I probably would've been disgruntled if I purchased the $35 DVD. I also purchased another pole DVD and I'm curious to see how it matches up.

Pros:
-Safety tips abound
-3 dancers show each move at once, which helped me master it more quickly
-They don't skimp on ""transition"" moves and techniques to actually create a routine and there are a wide variety of them
-There are a TON of moves. Lots of content to get through. This will keep me busy between classes for at least a couple of months.

Cons:
-The editing is irritating. The first 25 minutes are transition moves (which are great), but it's not like you can select a move from a master menu option. This means you have to manually move through the DVD searching for spins or whatever move you want. They could've made a master menu that allows you to select each move easily.
-The pace is too fast...each move is shown once, then you're done. I guess it's a better ""value"" for runtime for them, but it irked me.
-When I downloaded the workout instead of streaming online I had to get Amazon's special player. Also, the download was messed up, it looked whited out.",1313020800,4,1240,4.581081081081081

Vol. 1 - Beginner to Intermediate</a>.  I'm really glad amazon offers a special interest product like this.  Pole fitness is a relatively new sport and finding this type instruction is a rare gem. It really compliments well what I've been learning at my dance studio and in the online pole dance community.  Specifically, moves are broken down into small steps, you see the moves repeated, and written out tips come onto the screen.  Suggestions are given for linking moves and move variations (i.e. one-handed spins).  Also the video walks you through proper warm-up, stretching, etc.  I'm sure that I will eventually be purchasing Vol. 2 of this workout.",1297123200,6,1016,6.266187050359712
8262877,3,B0016KCCBS,This video is pretty good... They play the same music the whole video somitmgets annoying.  All the tricks are done step by step and are easy to follow.
