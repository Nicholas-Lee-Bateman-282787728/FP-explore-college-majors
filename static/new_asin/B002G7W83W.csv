8369706,3,B002G7W83W,"I bought this after trying in vain to find a DVD of the St. Petersburg Male Choir and on reading the earlier rave review for this DVD.

Unfortunately, I deduce the rave review refers largely/solely to one song on the DVD - that of the ""The Kremlin Capella""  singing the ""The little bell"". It is indeed outstanding. However sadly that is the only song they sing on the DVD.

The DVD is mainly based on the Moscow Male Choir Conducted by Valery Rybin. They are good and they sing a couple of good songs but, in my opinion, they are not as good as the St. Petersburg Male Choir.

It is my impression that the producers of this DVD had insufficient material of the Moscow Male Choir and decided to cobble together a range of other ""Russian"" material to produce a DVD on the cheap. Very fortunately they included ""The little bell"". They  included footage of Russian people in the snow etc which is a nice touch.

In fact, having just done a bit of research on the internet, the producers (Storyteller productions) appear to make documentaries and one gets the impression that this compilation was made originally for TV and then put out as a DVD. The DVD starts with a male voice saying that ""tonight we are going to present"". I am guessing that the present DVD is a blend of two film/documentaries, one called ""Russian Bohemia"" (presumably containing the Moscow Male Choir material) and a second called ""Secret Treasures of the Kremlin"" (which appears to have included the exquisite Kremlin Capella song). This may help explain some of the DVD's features, or lack thereof. The producers point out that this is ""more than a performance video (?), it is a rare opportunity to feel the pulse of this country"". That is a more positive way of describing the DVD and its contents.

Further update, on YouTube StorytellerMedia state that the material is from their two documentaries Secret Treasures of the Kremlin and Russian Bohemia. I should have been a detective.

Even more recent update. StorytellerMedia have the whole of the DVD on YouTube under the title ""Our World: Russian Bohemia"" so you can judge the DVD for yourself before buying it.

The DVD looks very cheaply made, so much so that when I received it I checked my order to see if I had ordered a second hand copy - worse, it looked like a cheap rip-off copy. The box is very poor quality, as is the sleeve which looks like a simple photocopy and says very little on the DVD's contents and on the performers. No dates. Inside there is no booklet with further information. The DVD itself has no menu, so you can't pick the song you want to hear or set anything. Once started, you can't skip to the next song, so you have to listen to all of the choirs, including a few folksy groups, while waiting to get to the Kremlin Capella  singing the ""The little bell"" or the couple of very good songs by the Moscow Male Choir. A thought just came to me - the mention of ""video"" on the sleeve possibly indicates that the material, rather old, was originally released on VHS and that they have released it without even changing the sleeve, just copying it. It also probably explains the poor picture quality in places.

Conclusion: If you really want to buy the DVD you can first watch it on YouTube (why would StoryTeller try to sell it while having it free on YouTube??). Otherwise, listen to The Kremlin Capella singing the ""The little bell"" on YouTube and, if you like it, download it from Amazon if you live in the US. It is the highlight of the DVD and is outstanding. I would also suggest that you listen to and buy a St Petersburg male choir CD -  eg ""The Male Choir of St. Petersburg"". It has several outstanding songs - The Evening Bell;  The Twelve Brigands; Do not reject me in my old age; Like a Nightingale in Flight; Eternal Counsel; The Repentant Thief; Steppe, Endless Steppe.. so good in fact that my wife had previously stated that she wanted ""Evening Bell"" played at her funeral, now she wants ""The Little Bell"". Lots of bells!!.

Suggestions to StoryTeller: Why charge so much (25 USD) for a poor quality DVD when you have the material on YouTube for free? Please improve the quality and give us more of the Kremlin Capella. Although variety of content is great in a documentary, its not so wonderful when you want to dim the lights, light a few candles and listen to truely wonderful music after a stressful day only to have to jump from your seat to quickly turn off/down the volume when the DVD suddenly changes to a (relatively) very loud Russian version of a thigh-slapping barn dance. Ruins the mood big time.

Another update. If like me you cant find the ""Kremlin Capella"" and any of their (other) material its because they are in fact (now) called ""Capella of the Moscow Kremlin Museum"" or similar. Hence check out the ""Kremlin Museum"" or similar searches to find their music",1325289600,3,4850,4.553386911595867

I bought this DVD on the strength, majesty and beauty of a magnificent a capella song I'd found on Youtube. The harmony of their voices is without equal. Like many people who had commented on the sublime beauty, I know I was not alone in wondering 'where can I find more!'. It didn't matter that I didn't understand one word, it was sufficient for me to appreciate their voices.

One of the members of the choir gave a link to this DVD where I immediately ordered it, and I recommend anyone who loves beauty to buy this DVD. You don't even have to understand the words because the beauty describes itself.
