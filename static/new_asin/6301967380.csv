389087,5,6301967380,"The new DVD sharpens the film up considerably. The Theatrical Trailer is included along with a cartoon and Hollywood short that don't have much of anything to do with this great film. As before, I mentioned that I had hoped that all the film would be put back together and although this is a little better there is still some cutting, including the Oklahoma Indian Land Deal Peace Pipe smoking scene which is still missing here. This film was the biggest money maker in 1940. It won an academy award for special effects and deserved it. Why can't we have the whole production on film?  Anyway, I still recommend the film for entertainment value. They don't make films for pure fun anymore but this was one of them.",1152144000,16,714,4.578125
389088,3,6301967380,"Boom Town is the story of two oil men who begin as friends but ruin their relationship over a girl. It is a 2 hour film that should have been done in less time. It tends to drag on and throw in unnecessary plot twists.

Clark Gable is a smart, tricky oil man who strikes it rich by stealing equipment. He plays his character just as he does most of his characters with a strength and arrogant confidence. He is certainly appealing, but he offers nothing new to the part.

Spencer Tracy is likable as the underdog in the friendship. His character is a hard-working man in love with a beautiful girl. When he finds that his girl loves his best friend, he becomes subtlety defeated and pathetic throughout without becoming comical. He is the best part of the film.

Claudette Colbert plays the woman the two men are in love with. She marries Gable's character and they have a son; she is hopelessly in love. However, most of her scenes are generic and simply adequate. She becomes more intriguing when she finds that her husband is cheating on her, but she is not outstanding.

Hedy Lamarr is gorgeous as the other woman whose disguise is working for her lover. Her scenes are brief, but she exudes a sophisticated sex appeal in each of them. Her part truly is not necessary in the film. The fact that Gable's character is having an affair could have simply been alluded to.",1129075200,,1371,4.493975903614458
389089,5,6301967380,"I loved it, but I have to agree with the other reviewer who said that something gets lost when Clark Gable decides to go to New York and moves Claudette Colbert and little Jack with him.

The fun of the first part of the picture is replaced by an agonizing melodrama, which I also like, but it could have been two different pictures.  The first movie would tell all about Gable and Tracy's friendship and their rivalry over Colbert--a kind of Howard Hawks male bonding movie.  The key scene in this one would be the hotel room in the ""boom town"" in which Tracy and Gable strip to their underwear and Gable starts calling Tracy ""Shorty,"" a nickname he hates but he loves to have Gable call him.  The second film is more of a George Cukor story, for once Hedy Lamarr enters the picture as a Dutch lobbyist, this gives Claudette Colbert a whole lot more to worry about than scrubbing oil stains off Gable's overalls.  Watching this picture recently I found myself more involved with Hedy Lamarr's role than I had been previously.  She's not ""brash"" and ""American"" like the others actors (yes, I know Colbert is French but she has that American buzz thing going on) and she's languorous and moody, speaking of herself modestly as a ""high class eavesdropper.""  But she's far from a bad actress, she's a bit more subtle than the other three (not to mention such certified hams as Chill Wills and Frank Morgan).  Lamarr's scenes convince you that she was actually a very smart girl, didn't she invent the submarine or something in real life?  You can see her brain turning over every possibility in Gable's long, lanky frame, and the glint in his dark eyes.",1110844800,10,1650,4.585034013605442
389090,5,6301967380,"Boom Town is entertainment. This movie was made in 1940 and is based on a short story. It begins with a partnership/friendship between Gable & Tracey as Big John McMasters & John Sand. The underlying philosophy in the movie is meant to show that no matter how much money you have you were still happier when things were tough! Each man earns and loses about 2 to 3 fortunes apiece. I have lived long enough to have seen the complete movie before our modern day censors got to it, so I can tell you that you cannot get an uncut edition of this movie and this VHS is NO exception. They removed the Indian peace pipe smoking scene when McMasters(Gable) signs a land deal with Oklahoma indians.(pretending that people never smoked.) This subtle cutting is done to a lot of old films and is really silly. Also the ""melting"" scenes with the sad horn music when people lose all their money have been cut out also. The only one left in is when Compton United goes broke in the oil war with McMasters. Curiously we DO get to see the US Government prosecution of Oil barons and not necessarily in favorable light. This film also takes a shot at the IRS and complains about taxation! (Where are the censors for this stuff?) Anyway, Frank Morgan is great in this work as Luthur Aldridge and young Chill Wills is excellent as a deadly crack shot deputy who just wants to be a ranch cook. The Oil fire scenes received an Academy award for effects and it was top notch for 1940. Girls invade and cause a lot of trouble between McMasters and Sand and their ability to make money but everything comes clean and happy in the end. Well worth a view but please.... if the DVD ever comes out put ALL the film back together!",1071619200,18,1702,4.406349206349207
389091,3,6301967380,"When I was on my Clark Gable kick some years back, I was overjoyed to find a copy of ""Boom Town"" in the video rental place. I'd seen a clip or two from it, and the prospect of seeing Gable, Tracy, and Colbert all together in one film was delightful to me. I mean, this would be the intersection of two great chemistry sets, Tracy and Gable of ""San Francisco"" with Gable and Colbert of ""It Happened One Night"". How could it possibly miss? Well, it did.
The buddy relationship of Gable and Tracy was great. The love triangle between Gable, Tracy, and Colbert was good. But why oh why do we have to go on a bit to have now married Gable cheat on wife Colbert with Hedy Lamarr? First off, I thought that was a terrible plot development, period. Why would he do that? Why was this necessary? No. Bad idea. What really sealed the fate of this being a wrong-o is the fact that Hedy is an awful actress. Yes, she's a beauty all right, but especially in the company of real fine competent acting talent, she stuck out like a sore thumb.
So, ""Boom Town"" was quite a disappointment for me, after years of expectation. Sometimes two plus two does not equal four, if your script is not good. Catch Gable-Tracy and Gable-Colbert in their separate better films.",1028419200,8,1246,4.375
389092,4,6301967380,"First, some movie trivia.  Fans of WINGS OF DESIRE, the 1987 Wim Wenders film, should take note of the tailor that Clark Gable summons later in the film to make ""twenty"" suits for Spencer Tracy.  The actor is Curt Bois, and he later played the part of ""Homer"" in WINGS OF DESIRE, the very old man first found in the library in Berlin, who aspires to be a witness to all he has seen in his life (ironically, one of the things he remembers are the atrocities of WW II, during which time Bois was living in Hollywood).
On one level this movie is about wild catters hunting for oil, but in reality it is about love and friendship. The oil industry actually serves as a backdrop, and after the first few scenes, it serves merely as a backdrop to the ups and downs of the main two characters. To be honest, it might be hard to watch if the three leads weren't played by such superb actors, and if excellent character actors weren't filling key minor roles. Luckily, Clark Gable, Claudette Colbert, and especially Spencer Tracy make this film truly worth watching.
I have trouble with Clark Gable in most of his films. He always has a super macho attitude towards women, carries a chip the size of North Dakota on his shoulder, and is more beset by false pride than any actor in the history of film. He also comes across as frequently pretty stupid, a fact emphasized in George Clooney's imitation of him in O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? Still, he did possess an undeniable screen presence. He and Claudette Colbert do not here have the kind of chemistry that they had in IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT, but they nevertheless match up well onscreen. Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy made several movies together, with Gable always managing a slightly more important role, but in every film they acted in, Tracy managed to walk away with the best acting honors. Tracy had to have had the most penetrating eyes in the history of cinema. The cast is rounded out by Frank Morgan and the inimitably voiced Chill Wills. Hedy Lamarr plays a supporting role. She simply had to be one of the most beautiful women in the history of film. Unfortunately, her voice and acting ability fell far short of her extraordinary beauty. Publicists in the old studio system always tried to tag actors and actresses with nicknames, and Lamarr's was ""The Most Beautiful Woman in Films,"" and I can't disagree with that one.
The plot is essentially guy meets guy, guys become friends, guy accidently steals the girl of the other guy but they all remain friends, guy loses guy and nearly loses gal, guys both have their ups and downs and ups and downs and ups and downs, guy gets guy, guy loses guy, guy and guy and gal all get each other again and live happily ever after. The ups and downs are a bit extreme, and I found them somewhat silly, especially given the fact that the entire action of the film supposedly takes place in less than eight years.
So, by no means a perfect film and one that is very easy to criticize. But nevertheless, this is also a film that is very easy to enjoy, thanks to typical performances by an extremely strong cast.",1022630400,3,3101,4.506216696269982
389093,5,6301967380,"This is without question the best Hollywood movie ever made about the oil industry.  It truly captures the passion, excitement, adventure and pioneering spirit that has made wildcatting such a wonderful endeavor.  It also portrays the extraordinary period in history that the early decades of the 20th century provided for the industry.  A time when a man with a dream, desire, and some skill, combined with a bit of luck, could overnight become one of the richest and most successful people in America.  Often after having persevered through a long period of bad luck and dry holes.  The movie also appears to incorporate in fascinating pieces of the actual histories of a number of the great wildcatters of the era.",1008633600,9,717,4.941666666666666

389216,5,6301967380,"This movie is an over-glorification of the oil industry.  However, it does a charming job of it with Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy as two ""wildcatters"" who make it big, but then feud over their mutual love of the same girl. ""Wildcatters"" being the oil industry's equivalent of gold prospectors. Clark Gable is ""Big John"" in the film and Spencer Tracy is ""Square John"" and Big John meets a girl while he is in town and falls in love with her.  On a whim, they get married and not until the next day does Big John find out his wife is ""Betsy"", the girl Square John has been writing to in earnest all the time they've been wildcatting.  Square John is a gentleman about the whole thing, but then he is unhappy when Big John develops an eye for other women.  One of whom is the ultra-glamorous Hedy Lamarr.  Since this is a 1940s movie and not a 1930s movie, Betsy (Brilliantly portrayed by Claudette Colbert) stays in-love with Big John and there is a hint that he reforms in the end.  One of the big differences I've noticed between 1940s movies and 1930s movies is that in the 40s they often have the starlets falling in-love with the wrong guy, but rationalizing it.  It doesn't go over well nowadays with everything we know about unhappy relationships, however, it makes for an interesting study of the different cultural perspectives in the different decades.  Some of the other likeable cast members include the proprietor of the wildcatting equipment, who always ends up making deals with Big and Square John, despite his reservations to the contrary.  And the very rural-minded sheriff turned cook and his rabbit stews.  All in all, I did find the movie to be charming and likeable, in spite of my disagreement over the love story element.

Directed by Jack Conway

Clark Gable as ""Big John"" McMasters and Spencer Tracy is ""Square John"" Sand both seek their fortunes in the Texas oil fields. They simultaneously fall in love with Elizabeth, but it's ""Big John"" who wins out. When both Johns grow rich on oil, ""Big John"" lets money go to his head, and he begins neglecting his wife for the yummy Karen, the precocious companion of businessman Harry Compton. ""Square John"", who still carries a torch for Elizabeth but doesn't want to see her heart broken, tries to buy off Karen; when this fails, he decides to ruin ""Big John"" financially. But when ""Big John"" is charged with violating anti-trust rules by the crooked Compton, ""Square John"" rushes to the side of his old pal.

Oscar Nominated for Best Cinematography (black & white) & Best Special Effects.

Special footnote: -- Clark Gable was anxious to do the film because his father had been an oil rigger, and Gable himself had worked on oil rigs in Oklahoma before becoming an actor ~ Boom Town saw the re-teaming of Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable - back together on screen for the first time since the scintillating 'It Happened One Night' (1934) ~ This is the third (and last) pairing of those two ""mega-stars"": Clark Gable & Spencer Tracy. They were to appear together on two previous occasions - 'San Francisco' (1936) & 'Test Pilot' (1938).

389334,3,6301967380,"""Boom Town"" (1940) showcases 4 of the biggest MGM stars of the 30s and 40s - Gable, Tracy, Colbert, and Lamarr - in a typical romantic adventure yarn from MGM about two oil wild catters in the early part of the 20th Century, the woman they both love, and their rags to riches to rags to riches story.

Clark Gable (1901-60) was one of the biggest stars of the 20th century, and a pretty good actor to boot. We remember him best as Rhett Butler for ""GWTW"" (1939), for which he received one of his three Oscar nominations (the other nomination was for 1935's ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" and he won in 1934 for ""It Happened One Night""), but he gave us many memorable performances in films like ""Teachers' Pet"" (1958) and ""But Not for Me"" (1959) both of which earned him Golden Globe nominations. My favorite Gable flick is ""Run Silent Run Deep"" (1958).

Spencer Tracy (1900-67) was another giant of the film world. He received 9 Oscar nominations and won twice (""Captains Courageous"", ""Boy's Town"" 1938), although personally I think ""Inherit the Wind"" (1960) and ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" (1961) were his best performances.

FWIW - This was the last film that Tracy and Gable made together. Although they were friends, and their on-screen chemistry is great, Tracy insisted on equal billing with Gable, who was the bigger star, and that was the end of their films together.

Claudette Colbert (1903-96) won the Oscar in 1934 for ""It Happened One Night"" (with Gable) and was nominated in 1936 (""Private Worlds"") and 1945 (""Since You Went Away""). In 1987 she won the Golden Globe for a TV show ""The Two Mrs. Grenvilles"", her last film. In her 50 years of performing, she made more than 50 films, though 35 of them were in the 30s and included such memorable films as ""Cleopatra"" (1934), ""Under Two Flags"" (1936), and ""Drums Along the Mohawk"" (1939).

FWIW - This was the first film that Gable and Colbert made after the memorable Oscar winning ""It Happened One Night"" (1934). Their on screen chemistry is great.

Hedy Lemarr (1913-2000) was one of the most beautiful actresses of all time, and her American film debut in ""Algiers"" (1938) launched her on a 20 year career that included films like ""White Cargo"" (1942), ""Tortilla Flat"" (1942), and ""Samson and Delilah"" (1949).

The film also features Frank Morgan, Lionel Atwill, and Chill Wills.

Frank Morgan (1890-1949) plays a long time friend and associate. He will forever be remembered as the ""Wizard of Oz"" (1939) but this was only 1 of nearly 100 film performances between 1916 and 1950, including Oscar nominations for ""The Affairs of Cellini"" (1934) and ""Tortilla Flat"" (1942).

Lionel Atwill (1885-1946) plays a rival oil man. Atwill was the king of the B horror films and best remembered as Inspector Krogh, the man with the wooden arm, who hunts down the monster in ""Son of Frankenstein"" (1939) while managing to get in a game of darts with Basil Rathbone.  Atwill appeared in 5 of the 8 Universal Frankenstein films, and also had time for ""Mark of the Vampire"" (1935) and ""House of Dracula"" (1945) as well as several Sherlock Holmes films, the best of which was ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" (1939).

Chill Wills (1902-78) appeared in over 100 films, usually as the grizzled sidekick and occasional comic foil, as he does here. He's best remembered for his Oscar nominated role as Beekeeper in ""The Alamo"" (1960), but he also put in memorable performances as Uncle Bawley in ""Giant"" (1956) and the storekeeper in ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"" (1973).

BTW - this is probably Will's least over-acting role.

Jack Conway (1887-1952) directs.  Conway was a prolific director (over 100 films) who started out as an actor but decided directing was for him when he was asked to wrestle a lion. He directed MGM's first talkie in 1928 (""Alias Jimmy Valentine"") and worked on ""Birth of a Nation"" (1915) as a second director. Conway was particularly good working with long films (e.g., ""Viva Villa"", ""A Tale of Two Cities"", ""Northwest Passage"") and with films featuring women (e.g., ""But the Flesh is Weak"", ""Lady of the Tropics"").

FWIW - Conway and Gable were close friends of Irving Thalberg and part of the so-called ""men's club"".

""Boom Town"" was #4 at the box office in 1940. The other top grossing films were ""Fantasia"", ""Pinocchio"", ""Rebecca"", and ""Santa Fe Trail"". ""Rebecca"" won for best picture, James Stewart (""Philadelphia Story"") was best actor, and Ginger Rogers (""Kitty Foyle"") was best actress. Other notable films that year were westerns like Spencer Tracy in ""Northwest Passage"", Gary Cooper and Walter Brennan in ""The Westerner"", and Errol Flynn in ""Virginia City"", comedies like Irene Dunne and Cary Grant in ""My Favorite Wife"", Cary Grant and Roz Russell in ""His Girl Friday"", and W.C. Fields as ""The Bank Dick"" and with Mae West in ""My Little Chickadee"".

The NY Times' Bosley Crowther called it ""a big, brawling, sprawling action picture"" but noted that ""Director Jack Conway has had some difficulty controlling the flow of the film"" and concluded ""More colorful action in the oil fields and less agitation indoors might have made ""Boom Town"" a great picture.""

As charming and exciting as this film is, it isn't without its problems. The matte effects are cheap and obvious, and there are significant lacks of continuity in the film, undoubtedly due to sloppy editing - one minute Hedy Lamarr works for Lionel Atwill and the next time we see her she is working for Gable; one minute Tracy sends Colbert down to Oklahoma and they next time we see her she is still in her NY apartment, etc.

Bottom line - a good romantic adventure yarn with some of MGM's best stars of the 40s.",1313193600,2,5645,4.795056642636458
389335,5,6301967380,"This is a wonderful film!  The box office hit of 1940!  Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy are wildcatters, men that drill for oil almost anywhere and everywhere they can.  They help each other and work together until women and wealth drive them apart.  Claudette Colbert plays the love interest whom both men love but only Clark can marry.  Wealth and New York City prompt him to look at Hedy Lamarr but never fear, Spencer Tracy is able to set everyone right.  The story is thin but the fun is immense.

389341,5,6301967380,"The reason they cut these old movies is because if 3 people find something offensive, the studios do not want a frivilous law suit on their hands, so it's it's just easier to cut the film to appease the minority of people.  Older movies were not politically correct, and as a result, out come the scissors and let's snip away! Yet today's movies try to offend everyone when it comes to sex and drugs, but that's o.k. because it appeals to the 15 year old movie goers. Something wrong with this picture?",1214265600,8,502,4.456521739130435
389342,5,6301967380,"Along with ""Call of the Wild"", this is my favorite Gable film(not excluding ""Gone with the Wind"", made just a year before). They have the similarity that we are in a frontier wildcat situation, looking for some treasure: gold in one case, oil in another. There is an air of tremendous excitement and optimism, which Gable epitomizes. In one case, Gable has wisecracking Jack Oakie and later gorgeous Loretta Young as companions in the search for gold.  In the other case, Gable teams up with an enthusiatic Spencer Tracy and later with gorgeous Claudette Colbert.
This is one of the last films Gable made before the tragic death of his wife, Carol Lombard, and his entry into WW II. After that, Gable seemed a changed man on screen. It is  also his most autobiographical film, as before his film career, he joined his father as an oil man.
  This film , an epic about wildcatting in the early oil industry, invites comparison to the later film ""Tulsa"", with the same theme. Native Oklahoman Chill Wills is the only actor I am aware of who was in both films. In both cases, the excitement begins with a gusher. Later, there is a spectacular oil field fire that threatens to wipe out fortunes. But the later film lacks anyone with the sizzling chemistry between Gable and Tracy, and also lacks the befuddled humor of Frank Morgan. However, If you enjoyed ""Boomtown"", you should check out ""Tulsa"". Susan Hayward is the tough-as-nails wildcat, with Chill Wills as the occasional narrator.  But, it tends to drag in places.
  The initial meeting between Gable and Tracy, going opposite ways on a one way plank that serves as the pedestrian bridge across a muddy water-soaked road in a wildcat town, reminds us of the initial meeting between Robin Hood(Errol Flynn) and Little John(Alan Hale) in ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"", in which they try to knock each other off a log crossing a stream. In the present case, the incident ends in a draw, when they both dive into the mud as bullets begin to fly around them. Tracy's initial offense at being dubbed ""Shorty"" by Gable is soon grudgingly withdrawn when they share a room together. However, woe be to anyone else who parrots Gable in calling him Shorty!
  Comparison with the prior Gable film ""Wife vs. Secretary"" is also in order. In both films, Gable acquires a knockout single woman, who nearly costs him his marriage, as an indespensable assistant in his business. The difference is in the personalities of the women. Harlow's character respects his marriage enough not to encourage an affair, though appearances sometimes fuel rumors. In the present film, Heddy Lamarr's character is a snake who admits to Tracy that she is determined to seduce and marry Gable. Happily, Gable eventually dismisses Lamarr and wife Colbert forgives him.
  The ups and downs of Gable's and Tracy's oil businesses, together or separately, and their flip-flopping relationship constitute much of the substance of the film. Tracy makes a memorable epic speech at Gable's anti-trust trial, which serves as the basis of a reconsiliation and a hopeful final scene. This speech should have been quoted in T.J. DiLorenzo's book:""How Capitalism Saved America"", in which he argues that anti-trust legislation has done much more harm than good.
  I wonder why the color DVD poster for the main feature shows Gable smooching Lamarr rather than Colbert? and why the color poster for the special features shows Tracy and Lamarr together(which occurred for only a few minutes in the film). Is Lamarr considered such a superior beauty that she totally outranks Colbert? Not to my mind.
  The special features include a look at some Hollywood stars, including Gable, in their off hours. The quality of the main feature on this DVD is excellent.",1209772800,2,3760,4.889937106918239
