8038902,5,B00065GWMY,This is a very informative DOCUMENTARY...and you can't beat the price! I've watched all the other documentaries and I believe this one to be the best.,1144281600,6,150,4.8076923076923075

It was great to delve a little deeper into the history of Alexander and his conquests, in preparation for the upcoming film with Colin Farrell and Anjelina Jolie!  If you'd like to find out a bit more about Alexander and his conquests, this is a great place to start...",1100736000,7,424,4.794520547945205
