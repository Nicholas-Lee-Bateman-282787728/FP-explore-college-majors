3875683,5,B0029193N8,"His Holiness called together some of the greatest minds on the planet to formulate a way to communicate and I could not believe the ego mania, deluded thinking which was obvious in many of these ""great"" minds.  We have a very long way to go in the west where equanimity is concerned.  We have a lot of work to do to kill our ego and water our true nature.  I also love the way it was put in the film to please not make illegal copies because they won't be able to fund more films like it if we pirate them.  It wasn't that threatening FBI thing, but a true plea and it was my pleasure to buy this film.

I just came home from seeing in the theater ""Unmistakable Child.""  It is about a very revered Tibetan Master of Buddhism, meditation and practice.  I will buy that DVD when it is available as well.

Do not miss either of these films. They could be the key to world peace.",1249344000,3,875,4.105882352941176
3875684,5,B0029193N8,"I recently purchased the Dalai Lama Renaissance DVD as a gift for my close friend and I was amazed how powerful the movie was (not to mention the reaction of my friend who has seen and read many of the Dalai Lama films). I am not a big fan of Buddhism, spirituality and documentaries about this subject, but that film was just something unbelievably incredible and unforgettable. The story is so brilliant, unique, touching and inspiring that right after we watched it, I decided to write this review to let others know about my impression.

The movie is not what you expect; it's not another boring documentary. It is on a completely different level which makes us start thinking and analyzing our actions and decisions. It gives us a flow of energy and we start appreciating things that we didn't value before. While watching it we get the feeling that we are also traveling with the main characters in the film through India, and eventually to the Dalai Lama's home high in the Himalayas. We get a chance to experience the transformation, together with `the world's most innovative thinkers,' who teach us how to find the inner peace that we want, and consequently make our world a better and more pleasant place to be for all of us.

It's a great, colorful and one-of-a-kind movie. I only wish we had more films like this that bring happiness, joy and self-discovery. I definitely recommend it as an absolutely `must have' DVD in your collection.",1248220800,7,1450,4.7272727272727275
3875685,5,B0029193N8,"As a ""Tibetan Buddhist"", I always enjoy hearing His Holiness the Dalai Lama's laugh. The suffering of aging is very real, but no matter how low I may be feeling, he makes me happy.  He laughs and smiles often in this film. He also offers much wisdom.

As a retired Public Health Educator, Community Organizer and Administrator, I found the group dynamics to be of great interest. A group of very intelligent people from different disciplines came together to synthesize diverse approaches to world problems with the results to be offered to His Holiness the Dalai Lama for his consideration and possible use.  Well, many successful, bright people also have big egos. Watch this film to see what happens.",1245974400,16,703,4.890756302521009
3875686,5,B0029193N8,"I saw ""Dalai Lama Renaissance"" in a theater when it had its theatrical release in the U.S., and I was very moved by this film, and can understand why it won 12 awards: It was both unexpectedly funny and profoundly moving, and presents an intimate experience with the Dalai Lama.

I have watched a few other films about and featuring the Dalai Lama, and I have seen him speak in person in an auditorium, but ""Dalai Lama Renaissance"" surprised me in that, like no other documentary film about the Dalai Lama that I had seen before, it really captures the intimate presence of the Dalai Lama. You feel that you are in the room with him as you watch this film. Perhaps it is the fact that the film is shot with 4 or 5 cameras (with many different angles), and perhaps it is also because the film so skillfully shows how the Dalai Lama, through his wisdom, humor and compassion, transforms the people who encounter him in this film. The characters in the film who meet the Dalai Lama are a vehicle for the audience to also experience their own personal journey.

When I began watching the film, because of the beautiful images and music, as well as the masterful storytelling and colorful characters, I soon began to feel that I was one of the participants in the film, and that I had stepped into the film and was a part of the journey to meet the Dalai Lama.

In ""Dalai Lama Renaissance,"" you really see some of the characters go through a profound personal transformation (in the presence of the wise, personable and funny Dalai Lama), and (this has very rarely happened to me while watching a film) I myself felt myself going through an inner transformational journey of my own.

As the main characters in the film travel through India, I felt as if I were traveling through India. As the Westerners where discussing how to solve the world's problems and then their egos began to surface, I also felt something stir inside of me. And most importantly, when these Westerners began to experience an inner transformation in the powerful and inspiring presence of the Dalai Lama, I also felt something deep and powerful occur inside of me.

My dad was in the theater with me watching the film (he doesn't normally like any films other than Westerns and classic comedies), and I was struck by what he told me after ""Dalai Lama Renaissance"" was finished. He is as far away from Buddhism and spirituality as you can get, but he really liked the Dalai Lama, and was struck by how funny and common sense he was. I even think that the Dalai Lama got a little bit into my dad's skeptical heart :) But there was something that was even more striking: After watching the film, he at first was somewhat quiet. I looked over at him, and I saw emotion in his eyes. I asked him how he liked the film, and after a few moments, he told me that he saw himself in one of the cantankerous characters of the film. He said ""I am him."" At that moment, he told me that he realized that he had been living his life with a closed heart, and that he knew that he had to open his heart and love the people in his life.

I was almost speechless, but also grateful that one film could make such a powerful and positive impact on someone as skeptical as my father.

Needless to say, I am going to share the film with others in my life.

Here are some other quick thoughts about the film:

-I think that this film acts like a mirror, and will give every person the experience that they need to experience.

-It was both very funny and profoundly moving at the same time

-There were some remarkable quotes sprinkled throughout the film (at important ""chapter"" points) that really anchored the ideas of the film into your mind and heart.

-Aside from containing the documentary on the DVD, the filmmakers somehow were able to squeeze in 105 minutes of Special Features, including some very interesting behind-the-scenes interviews with the Dalai Lama, as well as the people who traveled to India to see and meet the Dalai Lama.",1245283200,51,3991,4.489655172413793
3875687,5,B0029193N8,"I did not know what to expect before seeing this film.  But, from the beginning, it took me on a journey. I saw India, its people.  And the cinematography is wonderful!  Breathtaking!  Bits of humor, bits of sadness... all wonderfully interlace this gem of a film. You journey on this film with the participants, experiencing both their outer journey of turmoils, and most importantly their inner journey of transformation.  A trip to take them not only to meet the Dalai Lama, but to meet themselves again in a different way.  Enjoy this intimate journey... this delicate flower of a film.  This film makes the Dalai Lama's message even more poignant.  And Harrison Ford's voice pierces at you with wisdom.  Enjoy!",1245196800,3,715,4.891666666666667
3875688,5,B0029193N8,"The Dalai Lama Renaissance is far more than just another factual documentary of the Dalai Lama, and has a special message not found in other movies on His Holiness (at least to my knowledge).

Basically a group of leading edge thinkers, heavy weights of science, philanthropy, politics, philosophy, economics and spirituality travel to the Himalayas for an audience with His Holiness the Dalai Lama in an attempt to fuse their separate disciplines into a unified approach in solving the world's problems. Such leaders include Dr. Michael Beckwith (The Secret), Fred Allan Wold and Amit Goswami (What the Bleep...?).

Before addressing His Holiness the Dalai Lama as the group, they have to reach a consensus of just what exactly they will be saying to Him. In their attempt to tackle the problems of the world, they inadvertently stumble upon the fundamental problem of human nature, the ego. Each participant has big ideas on how the world works according to their particular expertise. When an attempt is made to unite all these various perspectives into a coherent ""Synthesis,"" it becomes apparent that the task isn't as easy as everyone had hoped. Even when everyone is separated into small groups in order to define the word ""Synthesis"" itself, the first exercise of the symposium, the sparks begin to fly. Egos are bruised, views are dismissed and frustrations are vented. As a viewer, you can't help but get caught up in the drama, which is both highly entertaining and highly thought provoking.

What makes this film unique among so many other great documentaries on the Dalai Lama is that it reveals not just the brilliance of these heavy weights but the flaws and insecurities. It shows these people in all their humanity and complexity. Movies like ""What the Bleep do We Know?"" and ""The Secret,"" while excellent movies in their own right, tend (I feel) to portray the speakers as unassailable founts of wisdom, learning and insight. In the Dalai Lama Renaissance, some of the same people are shown getting frustrated with each, even to the point of hollering and bickering like children. The value of the whole event for many participants was not (as it turned out) in the opportunity it presented in revealing their brilliance to His Holiness, as some of them had hoped, but in their own emergence out of the darkness of their own ego. By the end of the event/film, each participant is renewed and transformed. To witness this is a remarkable experience, not often caught on camera.

Consequently it leaves the viewer more than simply informed about The Dalai Lama's life and message, His exile, China's occupation of Tibet etc. It forces the viewer to really ask some serious questions, which, as the life story of the Lord Gautama Buddha showed, is the first step to enlightenment.

There is also a lot of screen time devoted to the Dalai Lama Himself. Though not present during the heated discussions themselves, He is clearly aware of what the participants have been through and deals with it with His usual compassion, grace and understanding.",1245110400,16,3060,4.957115009746588
3875689,5,B0029193N8,"A remarkable film which follows a group of pretentious world savers to Daramsala for a meeting to come up with the Great Synthesis to save the world.

3875690,5,B0029193N8,"I was prepared to learn and grow from the experience of watching filmmaker Khashyar Darvich's work ""Dalai Lama Renaissance"". I was not prepared for the laughter I would feel and express as I watched. All of the ""characters"" in this film are recognizable reflections of myself and others I know. The stark humanism of the participants as well as their divinity is beautifully captured, and we come to realize that all is divine, especially that which is human.

The backdrop of India ~ the landscape, wildlife, people, colors and sounds are gloriously filmed and scattered throughout, creating a visual experience that is gorgeous to watch and experience. I felt moved by the imagery as much as by the story.

And then there is the experience of the Dalai Lama ~ a constant emission of love and compassion radiates from his being as well as a level of joy and humor. He seems to me, to understand some big cosmic joke and looks as if he is working at leading us to the same understanding, while at the same time expressing tremendous respect for all.

Khashyar Darvich has managed to inform, express, transform, and entertain all at the same time. I highly recommend the film.",1290902400,4,1175,4.75

I was able to attend a screening of this film that contained a discussion with the Producer/Director afterwards. There is such power in the effort to express compassion for others, to learn  among your peers and look inside and beyond our own ego to find love from within. The screening i saw was with inmates at OSCI and if the film wasn't powerful enough, what the inmates had to say about the film and the questions they had for Khashyar Darvich (director) really put the icing on the cake.

3875697,5,B0029193N8,"I waited for some time to pass before reviewing this film, so my words would carry with them the full impact of my personal experience. I saw the film in the theatre and well as on DVD - both experiences created impact. In this review I am not going to plea with you to watch or buy these films, I am going to gently support you to exert your free will to focus in on your own life. In the course of making your Self the star of your own life story, as well as the director, audience and reviewer - I hope you also become the center of your own universe. I don't mean in a new-age-kinda-way, but in a simple every-day-kinda-way like eating, sleeping, taking bathroom breaks and breathing. I hope time with your Self becomes so essentially a part of your day, that soon without any effort giving to your Self becomes the norm, the standard from which you rule and govern your Self. Okay, so now we get to the reason why I chose to watch this film, more than once. I knew if The Dalai Lama was in the film, then there would be giggling - laughing is on my Daily-Must-List. I knew there would be no lectures from The Dalai, he tends to get bored with the sound of his own voice, and so starts to giggle. True behavior of a role model is not taking one's Self seriously, and telling you to model your own life behavior around being aware of what roles you are inauthentically playing ... in other words role modeling is not something encouraged, but catching & ending the role playing is. This film is a brilliant illustration of that life-giving, and life revitalizing technique - CPR for the heart that stopped from daily living life inauthentically.

I think what Khashyar Darvich, the director of the film, achieves in the making of Dalai Lama Renaissance is capturing on film a whole room of egos teamed up to learn about the  ""acting out"", and illusionary "" role playing"", needed to work out the world's problems by being outside-of-our-Selves to accomplish any task. The Director accomplishes the task of silently moving the camera around the room picturing The Dalai going quietly inward to create ... in silence, no role playing, no acting ... no matter how many 'Great Minds' are sharing the same exterior room ... The Dalai moves inward to be alone within his interior, then with an insight, he moves quietly outward to participate with those 'Great MInds' by offering directional questions to guide them within. He was mindful enough to not offer them answers, he seemed aware that his greatest impact on the 'Great Minds' was to provide an alternative to them by his example... the alternative was how not to use a great mind to solve the world's problems. The difference between mind and ego was captured on film.

I watched The Dalai guide the 'Great Minds' to drop their mind, while giggling to the camera so the director could capture on film the giddy realization that we are all equal, equally intelligent within our own personal universe ...  leader of our personal space, leader of own personal self-realization and enlightened by the power of our daily choices. I think that Khashyar and his film making team created a space in the room for us the audience members to be silently present at the ""how to create a better world retreat"" ... and that is the treat ... that as audience members we get to be silently sitting in the room with The Dalai ... witnessing and observing what is going on in the still room inside us, within ... as we watch the room outside us full of the chaos of the  'Great Minds' in their minds trying to solve problems.

We become the World's Greatest Minds by experiencing what The Dalai experiences everyday by understanding the power of his choices ... 'how to be silent inward observers of the outside-us-illusion-of-intelligence', and that the biggest illusion is that 'other people's intelligence rules or governs us'. We are invited and treated to participate in this workshop, as the silent majority, and so we are reminded of our essential importance as the quiet many.. and very effect power of our being the quiet 'One'.

I think the film and it's creators capture the importance of being 'the one who is present', 'the one who is silent', 'the one who is peace-full', and 'the one not attached to their mind'. I felt, after witnessing these events outside me, 'the film', and then witnessing the events within me, 'my growth' - i felt that what changes the world each day is the NOT the 'effort' of trying' to make a contribution, 'trying to be seen', 'trying to be heard', 'neediness', 'compulsion' and 'competition' to be members-of-the-elite-mental-class, BUT I felt more deeply convinced that my world alters when I am, I am simply being my Self,  my-class-of-One ... governing my own humanity, my own personal ethics  ... the standard bearer writer, director, and star-creator of my own personal life story.

The world is altered by huge egos with vast intelligence, and lucky for us all, the world is also altered by any and all things that co-create any and all things. By design all of the intelligence of the entire universe is within each one of us in equal amounts. Now, how we as the artists of our own story, interact with our own unique intelligence, is our own personal focus and choice. I chose to watch this movie in silence, and observe my Self grow. What shows on screen in this film is that the filmmakers grew, The Dalai grew, and that in making the film the focus and choice of the filmmakers grew ... and continues to grow by creating space for us the silent majority to witness and grow. How nice is it that a film is made with the intention that the audience grow, and so we grow in spite of our Selves from the experience of watching this filmed event. That level of caring and commitment to deliver to the audience a gift, deserves an award ... but these filmmakers do not have huge egos even though they carry the intelligence of the entire universe within ... Lucky for us receivers of their gifts,  their wisdom and care-giving shows, and, lucky for us there are filmmakers who actually care about how their work impacts the world, betters the world and benefits the people sharing the same planet with them. Peace, Love and Happiness is a winning combination of elements from which to craft a story. Let it be your story too. I hope when you watch this story that you will also see your Self grow. Be well and may peace be within you - and NOT governed by those around you.",1264204800,6,6459,4.583549783549784

I sat spellbound throughout this film, and wept uncontrollably through most of it, while laughing and feeling waves of joy and insight sweep over me, as it peeled away ""layers and layers of human onion peel"". Not only is the beauty and saturated color of this film overwhelmingly beautiful, the incredible scenes around the legendary Dharamsala, the footage of India, and Harrison Ford's moving readings of a handful of key quotes that punctuate and divide the sections of this film, make it a rich multi-layered experience.
  This is an incredible depiction of the disturbing, inevitable and ultimately liberating and very human friction that that flowed out of the group dynamics generated by this gathering of 40 highly learned professors, priests, psychologists, physicists, and others that His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama invited, allowed and granted audience to for a week long visit to Dharamsala.
  The invited group's idea was to brainstorm and come up with a synthesis of the group's ""brilliant ideas"" (generated by their sincere but often ego-filled and top-heavy intellectual minds) and present those ideas to His Holiness The Dalai Lama, to see what he would think...
  This is not a normal or typical documentary about The Dalai Lama. To those that think that The Dalai Lama is an overrated, or over-venerated projection of people's desires to have a ""super-human"" deity to ""worship"": this film will surprise them. Tenzin Gyatso, His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, in his own completely natural way, explodes and deflates the group's (and the audience's) expectations of His divinity and brilliance--while simultaneously reinforcing it. He exceeds their expectations, and explodes their paradigms, without even trying. His Holiness humbles them all, unintentionally, and in his basic straightforward simplicity, yet with profound and simple depth, exceeds the group's (and the viewers ""expectations"". The result has to be seen, no words can adequately describe it. It is truly remarkable and this film will stand as a lasting record of the 14th Dalai Lama, long after he is reincarnated again.
  As I said, I wept with joy, and had to suppress it throughout this film (because my weeping and suppressed sobs surprised me so much).
They were tears of joy, and of relief: to see stark reinforcement of the reverence I hold his His Holiness in.
  And they were also the tears you shed when you are laughing so much that tears stream down your face! The cosmic humor of it just overwhelmed me: like a glass of water that has water poured into it continually past overflowing! The color was beautifully saturated and the
Dalai Lama is not the only person that communicates some profound wisdom in this film. This is not a typical ""journalistic documentary"" nor a product of slavish Buddhist hero-worship.  I highly recommend this motion picture to everyone.",1260316800,2,2913,5.0966386554621845
3875701,5,B0029193N8,"I have watched many films and DVDs on the Dalai Lama, and this is simply the BEST, most transformational film with the Dalai Lama that I have ever seen, for these reasons:

1) You receive an intimate personal experience with the Dalai Lama, his words, his spirit and his wisdom. You experience the Dalai Lama up-close and personal, and his lessons and words of wisdom in this film are profound and uplift your mind and heart.

2) Not only does this film present inspiring moments with the Dalai Lama, but it also has a powerful cinematic documentary film with story and developing characters: It is a cinematic film that also presents a story of the transformation of Western revolutionary thinkers in the presence of the Dalai Lama. The cinematography is stunning and beautiful. While you watch the film, you feel as if you are going on this same journey of personal discovery with the characters.

3) You not only get to see the Dalai Lama in person, and hear his profound words of wisdom, you get to witness the IMPACT that he has on others. I read one reviewer write that this film presents ""His Holiness in action."" To best know a person, you need to not only hear his or her words, but you need to observe their actions as they interact with others. This film is so much more dynamic than a recorded speech of the Dalai Lama. You get to experience many facets of this incredible human being.

4) This is a film of many levels, and like any great film, you can experience it on many different levels: A) You can watch it, follow the story through many twists and unexpected turns, and laugh at the many funny moments in the film, especially at the humanness of the Westerners. B) You can listen and take in the profound wisdom of the Dalai Lama. C) You can witness the inner journey and transformation of the Westerners in the film, who go through their own transformation from ego-centereness to open-heartedness. D) Or more powerfully, you can open your mind and heart while you are watching the film, and let the film wash over you and go on a personal inner journey yourself. I have heard many times from a variety of people that this film acts like a mirror or reflection for those who watch it, and if you have the wisdom, openness and self-awareness to go on the journey in this film with these Western renaissance thinkers, then this film will impact you and reveal how your heart can be opened more, and you will be transformed and positively impacted, as I was.

5) This is not just a film, but it is an experience and adventure. Not only is the film funny, profound and beautiful, but it is a personal experience whereby the light of awareness is shined inside of you. This is not a film to watch while you are washing the dishes and speaking on the phone. This film will engage you, and will shine a light on the areas within yourself that you need to transform.

An excellent film that confirms that our instincts as humans is to want all the answers, or to think we have all the answers. This is a good insight into the heart and mind of the Dalai Lama who helps us to recognize that answers are not always attainable. We spend too much time thoughtlessely scrambing for answers. Sometimes reaching from within ourselves, rather than extending outward, provides the best perspective.",1258934400,3,482,4.890243902439025
3875703,5,B0029193N8,"This film documents events at a weeklong meeting held in Dharamsala, where the residence of the Dalai Lama in India is located. Some 40 intellectuals (from scientists over journalists to theologians) were invited to have a cross-disciplinary exchange of ideas and through synthesis of expertise make some suggestions for solving current world problems. For this reason they are called ""the Synthesis group"".

  Coming with some experience in science and research myself, it was not hard to relate to people in the Synthesis group. For the most part of the movie, I was nodding in recognition of the individual personalities portrayed. Whether practical or romantic, eager or cautious, egotistic or altruistic, enthusiastic or sleepy... I have come across most of them many times in a similar setting of scientific meetings. Also, having been involved in many undertakings ""from the ground up"" in my life, I was also familiar with the practical difficulties that can arise when many people have a complete freedom to develop ideas in real time as a group.

  So what unfolded during the actual Synthesis meeting was more sobering than surprising... to witness a group of very educated and smart people, that are obviously motivated, stumble so much in even talking to each other during just a few days!

  What I haven't expected at all, but this movie uncovered, was a deeply hidden sadness within myself... Sadness from the realization that it is our ""raw"" behavior and lack of understanding that is preventing us from even getting started on solving problems of the world which could be tackled now with with means at hand, by application of compassion and cooperation that stems from it... Sadness that it is ourselves, ""we the people"", that can be a much bigger obstacle to our own and everyone's happiness than any external condition such as limited knowledge in scientific disciplines.

  In the movie, we could witness the moments of similar realization by these eminent experts. They could see the true extent to which their personal embodiment of core human qualities influences the kind of projects for global humanity they are able to engage in practice. To most of them it seems to comes as a shocking and unexpected result - perhaps a further testimony of just how far the modern culture may lead us astray from the true path to ending suffering.

  Yet, this did not seem to be a surprise at all for the Dalai Lama. Nor is he saddened by the way things are right now with the world. Upon learning of the failure of the attendees to reach the ambitious goals they set for themselves, he subtly reveals the actual lesson.

  I was stunned at how far greater his wisdom and compassion for all people must be, greater than I ever imagined. To be able to understand limitations of many, be they simple villagers or prominent experts, children or elderly professors... to know the direction of the path of the heart but observe the multitude stumbling around because they believe for themselves they know better.... and still act only with kindness and deliver instruction without any condemnation.

The film gives the viewer a special insight into the delightful personality and brilliant mind of the master, who listens politely and thoughtfully to each of the participants.

It is fun, and humbling, to watch his interaction with the extremely intelligent, and often super ego-centric members of the conference, and to wonder what long-lasting impression his presence in their midst will make.

3875705,5,B0029193N8,"When I saw the film, ""Dalia Lama Renaissance,"" for the first time, I was immediately changed and forever affected in a positive way.

What caught my attention was how such a humble and soft-spoken individual, the Dalai Lama, could have such a powerful effect on so many powerful thinkers from different walks of life through his wisdom and insight. I learned a great deal about myself through the characters observations of themselves in the film-- their self tribulations with ego, encounters with others and their transformation in the presence of the Dalai Lama. What I realized was that ""ego"" is non-productive, and it can be transformed through self-awareness and a compassionate understanding of others.

There is plenty of priceless wisdom from the Dalai Lama in this film.

Through my observations of the Dalai Lama in this powerful film, what I realized was that here is a man who is widely respected around the world and yet he has no ego. He showed patience, understanding and interest in what others had to say. He was also comfortable at being merely a bystander and offering insight and wisdom at the right moments. And as a result of being a compassionate listener, I believe it had a positive impact on the innovative thinkers who became more enlightened as the film progressed, and were transformed out of their egos.

What I personally was left with was the understanding that in order to be a part of positive change, I need to begin with myself first. Self-awareness is the key to positive change whether it is personal or universal, and this is what I believe the film's director brilliantly conveyed.

This is a great film because its message and themes are universal, and it speaks to everyone.",1258243200,3,1717,4.866438356164384
3875706,1,B0029193N8,"If this was truly a video about the Dalai Lama than it might live up to the billing, but unfortunately, it is mainly about people discussing what was going to happen once they met the Dalai Lama and what would happen at the boring summit meeting of the ""minds"". This had very little to do about the Dalai Lama. I have almost every video on or about the Dalai Lama on Amazon and unfortunately, this one is the worst I have gotten so far simply because he is hardly in it!",1257465600,10,470,4.175824175824176
3875707,4,B0029193N8,"I agree with ""A Reviewer"" below (""Western Spiritual Dark Ages?"") in his/her opinion of the ""great thinkers"" featured in this film, but disagree in the rating.  This is well worth watching, as a cautionary tale of pettiness and narcissism in the face of the very real challenges of our age -- and in the face of very real wisdom and compassion.

I actually saw this at a small cinema soon after it was released, and found it rather difficult to watch due to embarrassment for the participants. The setup is that these supposed foremost thinkers from many disciplines in the arts & sciences are brought together to develop solutions to the world's BIG problems -- world hunger, environmental degradation, violence, etc. -- in the Dalai Lama's residence.  Discussions almost immediately descend into: first, narcissistic contests of ego; and second, sycophantic attempts to curry favor with His Holiness.  I believe I literally squirmed in my seat as one of the participants proposed his Grand Plan (which came to him during meditation, no less. Maybe he should have released this thought and gone back to following his breath?) to the Dalai Lama: a worldwide boycott of China in order to free Tibet.  How this very unique and original idea (not!) would decrease greenhouse gas, reverse deforestation, or sustain the world's poor is only suggested by a vague reference to Tibet as some sort of starting place.  The Dalai Lama himself, as is typical, rebukes this individual, gently, compassionately, and wisely:  Tibet is a temporary political problem; a boycott would hurt many Chinese workers who depend on trade with the rest of the world; You are gathered here to solve the really big, long-term issues that few are really considering effectively.  I sincerely hope these people learned something from this exercise: I know I did.

His Holiness the Dalai Lama is, as ever, a lamp of simple wisdom in the midst of this display of dukkha and samsara. Having heard him say often that he is only a ""simple monk,"" I am inclined to believe that becoming a simple monk is one of the most difficult and worthwhile endeavors a sentient being can undertake.

I have to commend the makers of this film for having the courage to release it.  I'm sure -- I hope! -- that many of them are embarrassed at seeing themselves acting so, so... silly!  I know that I, myself, am probably too much like these intellectual peacocks and not enough like ""the simple monk.""  (This review may be the evidence!) Watching this again may help me to do better.  I will buy it, and I will share it with any committee I'm ever involved with.

3875708,1,B0029193N8,"The Dalai Lama is the star of this documentary and he shines; the 40 of the ""brightest minds"" in the world - not so much.  For all their acclaimed smarts and after approximately a week ""solving"" all the world's problems the very best they could come up with was an international boycott of China!  Even after the Dalai Lama told them the reasons that a cross the board boycott was a very bad idea the speaker asked if that meant that was a ""yes"" on his part.

I personally would have liked to have seen more of, if anything, else the group came up with; but from the film that seems about it, one bad, if not stupid and impractical idea.

The movie itself is extremely well photographed and the inter cut shots are very evocative. As a movie, it is excellent inasmuch as it shows the personality of the Dalai Lama, and unfortunately also those of the session attendees. Non-ego versus super-egos.

As for Harrison Ford, if you buy this for his participation (which I am sure he undertook for pure compassion), there isn't much; a brief opening and the reading of a couple of title cards.

It all is a learning experience, but I think for the price it screams rental.  The Dalai Lama makes all those smart folk look like a CPA convention trying to figure who owes what on the lunch tab.",1249776000,17,1285,4.419491525423729

I have to admit, 20 minutes or so into the film, I wasn't quite sure what the point was (was it just a bunch of intellectual-types arguing whose smarter, and who has the ""right"" view or solution?).
But later in the film, and especially the conclusion, really made the point, and was well worth the journey.  Through it all the ""middle way"" is the answer, with compassion, and with opening our hearts and minds.  Thank you for this beautiful glimpse.

Maybe that was the point?  That academics are self-centered and willfully stupid?  If so, the film did what it is supposed to do, but from all the liner notes it doesn't seem as if that was the goal.

Really, the whole premise that you are going to get 'smart' people together to conference, and then tell the Dalai Lama something he does not already know is preposterous.  Every agenda from boycotting China (for the sake of Tibet) to 'I wanna speak to the Dalai Lama' comes up and it's not pretty.  This is mostly a pass for sure.

That having been said, I've never come across a finer film where I can agree in equal measure with the Five Star and One Star reviews. I'm giving it Three Stars because it's a rating that represents something of a Middle Way between my respect for Tenzin Gyatso and my sense of disappointment in his guests.

The Dalai Lama invited a small army of people, presumptively the brightest minds in their fields, to come together in order to address the world's problems and arrive at workable solutions.

What we see is that without compassion and bound by the chains of ego, even the highest IQs on Earth are rendered relatively stupid in the face of the human condition. Members of the group debate their ""right"" to address His Holiness individually; the various subpanels argue over interesting but essentially irrelevant intellectual minutae; and a week after first meeting the ""brightest minds in the world"" come up with the shopworn idea of pressing for Tibetan independence by instituting a worldwide boycott of China to be led by the Dalai Lama.

His Holiness scuttles this idea outright as being uncompassionate toward the Chinese. His simple, softspoken Dharma talks which follow illuminate the minds of the assembled illuminati, leaving many of them in tears.

Ultimately, the lesson herein is that an open mind and an open heart are greater weapons than those possessed by empires.",1332115200,3,1592,4.969924812030075
