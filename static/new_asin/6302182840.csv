435716,5,6302182840,"I'm a fan of westerns but I don't believe there are very many good ones.  But this is a good one,  it's a good movie besides being a good western.  One relief I got from it was I finally got to see a modern western without it making a political statement.  All the actors in this show are good.  Made me feel like I was really there.  I missed ""Johnnie"" though, the guy who was Chris Mahler's partner and decided to stay with Conagher when Mahler rode off.  I wish he had been in the movie longer.  Conagher is a tough cow puncher who doesn't have to look for trouble, it has a way of finding him.  His life begins to change after he meets Katherine Ross (Evie) and her two kids.  Her husband is killed in an accident unbeknownst to them while he goes to buy cattle.  Months go by and they know its been too long and he's not coming back.  Elliot looks his part, a man who's had a hard life but survived it through thick and thin, mostly thin.  Filmed in Colorado, the location and the music match the story well.",1031788800,118,1013,4.133333333333334

435718,5,6302182840,"This is one of my all time favorite westerns with one of my all-time favorite western actors. Conagher features all all-star western cast. Add that to a good story line and you can't lose.
My only criticism is that it is not out on DVD!",985651200,2,236,4.266666666666667
435719,4,6302182840,"I concur with the favorable reviews already posted.  It is (almost) unfair though to pass by the work (and casting) of a great supporting cast:
Ken Curtis as the upright but fading rancher.  You can hear the inner strength and outer helplessness in his statement to Conagher: ..I've got nothing but respect for an honest man...
(or some such)
Barry Corbin as the respectful, dusty, and quietly lovestruck stage worker.  Not your typical role for Barry--and one you have to be pretty self-confident to deliver.
The 2 kids are well, 2 respectful kids in the middle of the West with their step-mother.
Even the bad guys are well played.  A couple of lines are a bit too noble, but in general the characters were well drawn.
And of course, like the others, I thought both Elliot and Ross were inspired casting.  As for the lack of chemistry...well, there wasn't any per se ... and that was part of the story: How does one cut through life in an oppressive land with few social cues beyond right and wrong, to hook up with that other person...who by the way doesn't appear to be completely interested in you?
Maybe that's because that person, too, does not know how to cut through life in an oppressive land with few social cues beyond right and wrong, to hook up with that other person.
In a day when everyone wants a spouse (now!) but noone  wants to be the person they need to be to be a good spouse, it's interesting to see the tension of real men and women who bide their time through circumstances rather than forcing the issue at the first opportunity.",981331200,5,1554,4.5321428571428575
435720,5,6302182840,"Much has been said by others about how perfect Sam Elliot is in the title role of Conagher, and I join them.  Not since the late Ben Johnson has there been an actor so real and so accurate in his all-around  ""cowboy"" portrayal.  What a glorious interpretation of one of the  very best westerns that Louis L'Amour ever wrote.  The dirt floors, the  rocky, backbreaking soil, the cramped bunkhouses, and the very real dangers  from nature and from man that frontier men and women faced in their day are  all here.  And when the kid in the bunkhouse looks at Conagher and blurts  out, ""You're a hard man, Conager"" and is answered with the  prophetic words, ""It's a hard country, kid"" I cheer every time!  That's exactly the message that L'Amour constantly conveyed throughout so  many of his books--life was doggone hard, and it took a hard people, a  ""special breed"" to get us to where we are today!  This is an  excellent depiction of a slice of the ""real"" west, and is a  must-see for anyone just starting to get interested in the old west, or for  those who may consider themselves experts and simply love an authentic  western.  Elliot, Katherine Ross, Barry Corbin, Ken Curtis and company are  simply outstanding.  Those responsible for casting and approving the actors  and actresses in this masterpiece are to be commended as well.  Watch this  one and you'll smell the dust, feel the rain, heat, aches and pains, enjoy  the few comforts that were available in those days, and learn to love the  sound of the wind through the cedars!  This is one of the very few  occurrences where reading the book first will not make the movie a  disappointment!  It will prepare you for one of the best and authentic  westerns ever put out.  Hollywood needs to take a long, hard look at this  gem and shape-up it's act!  Louis would have been so very proud of this  one!",958953600,11,1861,4.567073170731708
435721,5,6302182840,"He is a stud and NEVER disappoints or waivers from doing the right thing.  From giving advice on shingling a roof to fending off the bad guys, he paints the image all men and boys admire.  Sam Elliot and Kathryn Ross  deliver individually and as a pair of lost adventurers looking for  companionship in the wild west.  A pure joy as a western and a love story -  two thumbs up!",944697600,,377,4.23943661971831
435722,5,6302182840,"This movie is an absolute must for any devotee of Westerns.  The adaption is very close to the book and Sam Elliott is a cowboy's cowboy.  He is natural and does not over play his parts. The film jerks a little as it was  originally made for TV and you can pick up the commercial breaks in the  flow.  But the story is classic - a hard man living a hard life with a  simple, strong moral code that translates well to the present day.  The  love interest, Katherine Ross is a great cast here and the interplay  between Ross and Elliott is subdued, but powerful.  This is Western film  the way it ought to be.  I could actually see this happening 125 years ago,  just this way.  It is a rare film - combining excellent, but definitely not  gratuitous action and using actors, wardrobe and story line that transport  you back to that time.",933811200,14,836,4.296774193548387
435723,5,6302182840,"Is there some problem with making westerns now days?  Seems like most of the new ones look like biker gangs playing dress-up.  After all the great westerns that John Wayne made most of the new ones are pretty blah.  All  you need is a good Louis L'Amour story, and there are plenty of them, and  some great actors like Sam Elliott and Katherine Ross.  I guess films like  this are to good for us poor folk.  Enjoy this one because there aren't too  many of them around.  The actors seemed to know just what L'Amour had in  mind and did a great job of showing it.  They have a feel for the western  movie and fit in so easily that they don't look like they are someone  pretending they are someone else.  Go, go, westerns and Sam Elliott.",923875200,3,737,4.239130434782608

435873,4,6302182840,"Sam Elliot drifts through a landscape familiar and haunting. Filmed as a tribute to the late Lous L'Amour (who had died two years previous to this movie's release), we get to see bits and pieces of the Western landscape that L'Amour knew best. Native Americans struggling to survive the endless arrival of settlers, cowpokes ready to shoot it out over the slightest slight. Aestetically, how nice to see a real cattle drive by modern cowboy wranglers. CGI (Computer Graphics) can never compare to the real thing. The landscapes are beautiful and the terrain unforgiving whether you're on the run from cattle rustlers, or just a mom trying to raise her kids at a stagecoach checkpoint. As the Executive Producer, Elliot doesn't dominate the story, he knows just the right moments for the glare, the big entrance, and the big sendoff of bad guys. I really liked the ending  of the movie with a surprising twist that I can't give away.

I take a point off from the DVD release as this wonderful movie is simply a cheap VHS videotape transfer to DVD. For what it is, it was well done, but the analog videotape to digital transfer shifted all the colors heavily to the red. The credits say the print was done by ""De Luxe"". That means there is a beautiful film of Conagher lying in some film vault somewhere. Shame on Warner Brothers and whatever lawyer told them they could save a few dollars by issuing this blurry, red-shifted videotape on a DVD, rather than giving us the film that Sam Elliot fans deserve. You don't chase a wounded Conagher into the rocks, and I only wish the legal team at Warner Brothers had received a similar glare from his deadly eyes as they pondered whether to cut corners on this release. Disgraceful what they did to this beautiful film, Warner Bros were the real cattle rustlers here!",1493942400,3,1810,4.670846394984326
435874,4,6302182840,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

*Plot and ending analyzed*

Conagher (1991) is a wonderful Western. The only critique I have is one, when the Apaches attack the cabin, they get killed rather easily. If you overlook that bad bit of writing, then this is a great late-era Western for any fans of the genre.

This is the reason why Westerns are so good, because they put forth a flawed man or some man in an a ambivalent place. Sam Elliott is the main reason that I enjoyed this film. He exemplifies the Cowboy ethic, a tough, stern, but fair man, he'll pick the correct side, even if he is outnumbered or doomed.

Barry Corbin as a Stage Driver, Paul Koslo as Kiowa Staples, a killer, Pepe Serna (Silverado (1985)) as a Cowboy, Ken Curtis (Gunsmoke (1955)) in his last Western, and James Gammon (Silverado (1985)) are just a few of the fabulous cast.

One scene has Sam Elliott attacking his rival's Cowboy camp and he has a chance to kill them all but he doesn't. He's not a killer. He's wounded, and then falls unconscious. The rival Cowboys also have a chance to kill him, but the head Cowboy says, ""He's worth more to this land than anyone else."" That is just great. It exemplifies the Cowboy way and the land they lived on.

A very good film.",1493251200,,1255,4.434782608695652

435988,5,6302182840,"This is the delightful movie of a story told by Louis Lamour.  It is a mans movie, full of tough characters, and great fights, but it also has a fabulously dear romance in it.  Chasing tumble weeds has never been so wonderful.  A women who is recently married to a widower moves out west with him and his two children.  He gets them out to the homestead he has built and leaves to go buy cows to stock the place.  Months pass food runs out and he hasn't come home.  He married a good woman who has backbone and good sense and adventure ensues: stagecoaches, passengers, Indians fights, rustlers, and even romance. The movie is very real, no sex or immorality, a little violent, but not what I'd call crass in its portrayal of life. It is a movie that makes moral character the hero and makes dishonesty and it's traveling companions not appealing and certainly not who you are cheering for. This is not a kids movie, but a favorite for the mans man and one that his gal will enjoy too.

In the darker scenes, the picture quality was less than great, but I think that's more to do with my TV than with the actual quality of the movie.

436062,4,6302182840,"A great story and a great cast to bring it to life.  This is perhaps my favorite western for the ""real"" feel - it's not all fancy gunplay and pretty western streets with boardwalks.  It's pretty enough, but it's also muddy and dirty and there is a lot of hard work and suffering shown too. Limited to the then-standard TV aspect ratio, the scenery can still take your breath away at times - my son asked me ""can we go there?"" at one point. The only drawback would be the common one - it suffers in comparison to the book.  The movie never shows Evie's real loneliness, the beauty of the view outside her window that keeps her in the empty land when advised to leave or how she struggles to survive a winter there. Elliot gets more screen time than Ross. Also, it omits Conagher finding the remains of her lost husband near the end - a pivotal part of the story.  But through it all Sam Elliot is still the perfect hard case cowboy (NO ONE ever did that better than Sam) and Kate Ross looks stunning, even without heavy makeup to hide the wrinkles of the still stunningly beautiful 51 year old actress.  The chemistry between the real-life couple, often perfectly done with just a quiet look or glance, is palpable.
James Gammon with that famous ""whiskey-soaked"" voice is terrific as always as the bad guy, father/son duo of Buck and Dub Taylor are great - especially Buck getting a turn as a bad guy for once.  The whole cast is solid, although I would have liked a tougher stage driver than Barry Corbin, who plays a weaker western man far better (a la Lonesome Dove) than a tough one.
A must-see movie for Western fans; the epitome of the genre.",1465689600,2,1647,4.401315789473684

Sam Elliott nails the lead role as Conagher and the supporting cast all perform well.  This is a Western in every sense of the word and makes it easy to see why L'Amour's work is so revered.

The plot is simple enough.  A family moves across the country to start a cattle ranch, but on the first day there, the patriarch dies in an accident with his horse, leaving his wife and children to fend for themselves.  Then we enter Conagher who happens by with a team of other cowboys.  He meets the family but only briefly before encountering other adventures of his own.  However, he cannot get them out of his head as he realizes he might not want to live the same cowboy life forever.  Excellent story and great acting all around.

436233,5,6302182840,"One of the best western movies ever made. Beautiful actual Colorado On Location shot movie. The plot is very good and sure takes the high road in morality and thought plane. It is probably truer to actual western life than many western movies. A number of actors had great roles in this one, making it one of the MUST SEE westerns ever made. Barry Corbin's role as McCloud, the stagecoach driver was his finest hour in that support role. Daniel Quinn playing a cowpoke who had a great disposition but could have thrown in with the bad guys from the Ladder Five Ranch but didn't is very, very good.

 Labon Teale is the son of a rancher who rides off to buy cows and never returns because he dies in an accident is an impressive young man role and one of the best as such in any of the many westerns I own but it was his only movie role. That is sad and according to what I could find he now plays in a  band. His sister, Ruthie Teale is played in the movie by Andi McAfee and is absolutely adorable! Andi McAfee is now a very beautiful actress and has played many roles. The role as Ruthie Teale is perfect and she bounces around while a game of marbles is being played, does well in an Indian attack, and is simply a wonderful little actress. James Gammon as the bad guy Smoke Parnell delivers a change of heart couple of lines that really is remarkable for how most bad guys can't ever switch to being good good.

The notes tied to Tumbleweeds featured in the Louis L'Amour tale is shear poetry and romance. Both Sam Elliot and Katherine Ross have helped shape a western movie of the very highest of ideals and cinematic quality. Evie Teale's interaction with visiting ladies who stopped as passengers on stagecoach runs sets a true love and adaptation to her rugged and beautiful setting. The old rancher Tay character who Conn Conagher rides for is the model of what a western rancher should be.",1428278400,,1899,4.401709401709402

436361,5,6302182840,"A great cowboy movie and probably more like what life was really like for cowhands.  Sam Elliot is so perfect in these cowboy roles.  He is rugged, tough, has that mean look to him when he needs it, but plays such a great, honorable character and when he smiles he shows that side of him that lets people know he has heart.  The story here is about a family that moves west.  They settle in and the father takes off to go purchase cattle and dies along the way, leaving his wife and two children out in desolate, dangerous country.  The mother is great character, who ends up being as tough as the country itself.  A stage coach line asks her to be a stop along their line, and she begins to make a go of it.  In comes Sam Elliott, and you can see the sparks flying.  But, he is a cowboy, through and through, and the he wanders in and out of their lives, the bond getting more obvious between them.  One particularly cute and different twist to this, is that the mother writes notes and attaches them to tumbleweeds, much like putting a note in a bottle, and she lets the desert carry them away.  Sam Elliott keeps finding these notes and is smitten by whoever is writing them (very cute twist, especially seeing this tough and ornery old cowhand always looking out for this sweet notes that keep appearing).  There are some great action scenes, fights and gunfights, with Conagher (Elliott) being the toughest and meanest cowhand out there, and up to anything outlaws and tough cowboys can throw at him.",1417651200,2,1505,4.4363636363636365

Losing your brand new husband at the beginning of a film and being set down in a cabin in the middle of nowhere with your step children would seem to be the start of a torture movie like Saw, but instead of being a continuance of bad luck on bad luck, it overcomes the negatives with nice surprises and victories through strength.  The quiet woman who is apparently incapable of complaining, writes her feelings on tumbleweeds and sends them off into the prairie to be found by cowpokes who make the tumbleweed poet a topic of much speculation.  Being offered the position of stage stop gives her an income and regular company.  The best character in the film is not the leading lady or the leading man, but the stage hand played by Barry Corbin who delivers my two favorite lines in the movie. and the best facial expression on the PLANET when Katharine Ross asks Sam Elliott isn't it time to go home.

436665,5,6302182840,"There was a time when cable broadcaster TNT was fairly fond of westerns. Twenty-odd years ago they aired a lot of older western themed TV shows and Saturday morning western movies. But they also released dozens of original feature-length western ""movies of the week"" and did so on a pretty regular basis for about ten years. One of the best of these was ""Conagher"" produced by and starring real life husband and wife Sam Elliot and Katherine Ross.

While not an action packed, edge of your seat kind of western, ""Conagher"" is a more romantic story that unfolds at a slower pace and features great performances by Ross and a number of character actors including the late Ken Curtis (in his final role) as an embattled rancher. Elliot rides tall in the saddle as Conn Conagher and looks comfortable there and is arguably in what is his best role ever.

Based on the Louis L'Amour novel of the same name, ""Conagher"" follows the hardships of a frontier woman, Mrs. Teale, who's husband has perished and who is now faced with raising two children in the wilds of New Mexico. This plot point dominates the first half-hour or so of the film until Conagher rides into the story driving a herd of horses for a stage line. Elliot's Conagher then takes over the balance of the film and carries him through a series of misadventures in a range war against cattle thieves until he finally settles down with the widow Teale.

Well written dialog from a very close adaptation and colorful appearances by numerous western regulars including James Gammon, Buck Taylor and his father Dub (in a short but humorous cameo) liven things up and the viewer is left with a very nice made for television film.

The audience should remember that ""Conagher"" was originally produced for television and the transfer for DVD is not the best and there are frequent fade outs for the original act breaks. Nevertheless, this remains a fine little film.",1365379200,,1918,4.733532934131737

436775,5,6302182840,"My two favorite Sam Elliott westerns are ""Conagher"" and ""The Quick & the Dead"".  I especially love this one as it also features Katharine Ross (Elliott's real life wife).  Every single scene in this movie works, and the story is a gem.  Every character was perfectly cast.  There is a small roll for Louis L'Amour's daughter Angelique, and I enjoyed that as a tribute to her father.

Sam Elliott is a great actor, and seems born to play westerns (although he caught my eye way back on Mission: Impossible.)  This one is a little atypical in that Conagher is not the most dashing looking cowboy, and yet has this immediate appeal, as does the story.  Evie Teale is left to raise her two step children (beautifully played) when her husband never returns from a journey to buy cattle.  In the story, we know what happened to him:  he perished when his horse took a fall and trapped him after he too was gravely injured in the fall.  Evie seems to sense that he is gone right away, and it is very believable, as she is a sensitive woman, who yearned for some signs of affection which were never fully forthcoming.  Her loneliness is palpable, as is her desire to do right by her children.

She notices Con Conagher as soon as he enters the picture, and he notices her, but it is not time for them yet.  He's too much a drifter, and she's fighting an uphill battle with keeping her farm going and feeding the stagecoach passengers.  When that job comes to an end, you feel the growing desperation, and the determination to keep her family safe, fed, and together.

Con meanwhile has taken a job for Seaborn Tay, and when he gives his word, he means it.  He rides for the brand.  But Tay is being russled right and left by his other two cowhands.

Con sets that right.  It isn't easy, but when was the life of a cowpuncher?  He shows his morals and mettle, his sand.

The way Con and Mrs. Teale's lives keep crisscrossing is believable, as is the entire story.  At the end, when they finally stop crisscrossing and run together, and the loneliness is finally banished, the drifting finally ended, we can't help but smile with great happiness and satisfaction.  I wish I could give this movie 10 stars.",1299888000,3,2195,4.487373737373737

436910,4,6302182840,"This was a solid lower-key Louis L'Amour-written western, meaning a little bit less action than the normal film of its genre. The action scenes they did have in here were short, too.

This is mainly a movie/DVD with several stories weaved in it: 1 - Cowhands slowly being sifted out as the times change and they are no longer needed; 2 - traitors among the main group, men who go to a competing gang of rustlers; 3 - a story of a lonely widow who has to take care of two kids after he husband disappears (killed).

Katharine Ross is the mother (""Evie Teale"") who turns cook at a lonely stagecoach stop that also is being eliminated. She is a good woman, and it's nice to see the female star of ""Butch Cassidy And the Sundance Kid"" still looking good out there is the prairie over 20 years later.

 Also refreshing to see was her young boy ""Laban,"" one of the nicest, most respectful kids I've ever seen on film: the exact opposite of the many brats I've seen on film in the last quarter of the 20th century. Cody Braun was excellent as the son, and, that's the only movie role he ever played.

The man ""Evie"" eventually falls for is the hero of the film, ""Conagher,"" played by Sam Elliott. If anyone in the modern era of films ever looked like he was born to play a cowboy, it has to be Elliott. He has the weathered looks and the voice that go perfectly with westerns.

But not so long ago during the good ol' 90's the TNT network produced some of the best television features in the history of prime time from biblical epics to shows based on Louis Lamour like this one. One thing these features had in common were high production values, good direction and some of the finest ensembles of actors found in television. Conagher in particular gets my attention because the story is outstanding. You get gritty hard edged western action from Sam Elliott who is one of the most authentic western actors you'll ever see. You even have a fine romance with the frontier woman played by Katherine Ross (the tumbleweeds). I don't know why TNT quit making this kind of feature.

The young cowhand (Johnny?) in the story is confronted with the hard decision between two opposing paths. Nor is Conn Conagher any wishy-washy, ""tolerant"" compromiser when it comes to what is right for men to do.

436917,5,6302182840,"This review is for ""Conagher"" DVD (DVD Release Date: 2005)

Adapting an extremely popular book into a screenplay for a movie is almost alway a nearly impossible task--especially if one considers the fact that one script page, which is probably one fourth to one half of a book page at best, is equal to about one minute of film time.  Louis L'Amour's novel, ""Conagher,"" considered by many to be one of the best novels written, is around 192 pages (one reviewer states it is 152 pages).  The film, again made for television on a small budget, is 117 minutes. Thus the writers--Sam Elliott (also a star and producer), Jeffrey M. Meyer, and Katharine Ross (also a star of the film)--had to condense the novel from 192 pages to approximately 48 pages; or a screenplay of about 117 pages.  That means that over 100 pages of novel had to be deleted or heavily summarized.  What the screenwriters provided was a phenomenal capsulization of Louis L'Amour's brilliant novel.  (Please note that I am not a big fan of Louis L'Amour books, although I have read about a fourth of them.  ""Hondo"" and ""Sitka"" are the other two books that I truly enjoyed.)  Could ""Conagher"" have been a better movie?  Absolutely--if they had made it into a mini-series, and had the budget to go with it!  Could ""Conagher"" be any better, given the limitations under which it was produced?  Not in my mind.

Other reviews have done an excellent job of discussing the performances of most of the actors--although some fail to ""understand"" or appreciate the beauty of Katherine Ross' performance--but less has been said about the sets.  These buildings are the real things; the type of buildings I find in ""ghost towns"" and out on the plains of Montana and other western states.  In deed, I cannot believe that other productions have not utilized--to my knowledge--the sets from this film.  The photography is also excellent, capturing the vastness of the plains, and an intrinsic harmony that people of the land, like Conn Conagher and Evie Teale, feel in their souls.  (That said, I do want to point out that many ""westerners"" never garnered that harmony--one that is close to what Native American Indians had as well--but rather they have ""adapted"" an appreciation and ideal of what the land represents).

I am sure that ""Conagher"" is a film that will be hard for some to fully appreciate because it--in spite of the necessity to limit itself, as discussed above--moves at its own pace.  The film is about two people and the intersections of their lives in a ""tough"" and ""lonely"" west, that happens to incorporate some standard themes of the western genre.  The only real weakness in the film--partially because the movie sought to stay ""faithful"" to the book--is its portrayal of the ""Indians"" in the film.  In fact, I think that this is one part of the story that the writers should have left out; albeit, it helps to ""demonstrate"" Evie's ""toughness"" and ""sand"" as a character.

While this has nothing to do with the film itself, I found the DVD transfer to be rather poor.  It takes a lot for me to comment about the quality of a transfer, as I understand the inherent problems of television films; conversely, Turner network usually takes much more ""pride"" in their work.  Moreover, given the rather unique ""status"" of ""Conagher,"" I feel that a Director's cut, clean of commercial breaks, with added scenes of the cowboy's daily routine (those ""things"" that made Conagher ""happy""), Evie's turmoil and ""happiness,"" and greater focus on the connections between the two characters would greatly enhance this film.

If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews. My goal is to provide help to potential buyers, not get into any arguments. So, if you only disagree with my opinion, could you please say so in the comments and not indicate that the review was not helpful. Thanks.",1222041600,2,3908,4.807174887892376

436973,5,6302182840,"Westerns are my favorite film genre - natural I guess for someone raised in Montana. Despite loving the genre, I have only a handful in my DVD collection. There really aren't many great westerns, regardless of how prolific the Duke and Clint and Tom were.  But Conagher is one of the great ones and, I feel, one of the two best western's ever made (the other is `Shane', if you were curious). I have watched Conagher many times and can find no fault with it. The story is authentic, the characters believable, and the props and accoutrements accurate for the time.
Unlike many westerns where death is meted out like welfare checks in the projects (try to count how many men Clint does away with in Josey Wales --bet you can't keep up), in Conagher the body count is confined to something reasonable.
Growing up, I knew some old time cowboys that hadn't yet bucked out their last bronc, including my grandfather who rode for Mumford Brothers Cattle Company as a young man. Conagher reminds me of those old men. Hard working, courteous, willing to help out where they could, and who could find humor in situations that at first glance didn't seem the least bit funny. Unlike characters in some modern westerns, they swore very little--if at all--and never in mixed company. Their idea of cursing was pretty tame compared with our modern society. 'Hell' and 'damn' were the usual, but a smattering of SOB might be used if discussing politicians or a rank heifer. Like Conagher, they enjoyed pulling a cork now and again. Elliot's portrayal of a cowhand is flawless - a totally believable performance.
Katherine Ross is Evie Teale, a widow trying to keep her body and soul together (as well as those of her two children) in a barren and hostile land.
Barry Corbin is splendid as Charlie McCloud, an affable stagecoach driver concerned with the well being of Mrs. Teale and her young'uns.
A special treat is seeing Ken Curtis in his final film appearance. Curtis plays Seaborn Tay - an aging rancher trying to protect his ranch from rustlers.
 Character actors James Gammon, Paul Koslo, Buck Taylor and Gavin O'Herlihy appear as the bad guys.

437056,5,6302182840,"Sam Elliott turns in one of his finest performances as Conn Conagher in this TNT adaptation of Louis L'Amour's ""Conagher"". TNT produced some excellent Westerns, many of them starring Elliott or Tom Selleck, from 1991-2003, and I wish they had continued to champion the Western. Thankfully, most of the best of the best - like ""Conagher"" - have been released on DVD.

""Conagher"" feels like two separate movies that the filmmakers managed to effectively tie together at the end. The first half of the movie primarily deals with Evie Teale (Katherine Ross) and her stepchildren facing life alone on the harsh frontier after Evie's husband is killed in a riding accident (she knows that he is dead although she never does find out exactly what happened to him). Conn Conagher rides through her temporary stagecoach stop, and the second half of the movie focuses on his life as a cowboy and his run-ins with other cowboys who lack his character's integrity. In between rides, he returns to Evie's place, and a relationship begins to develop between the two of them.

The character of Conn Conagher and his cowboy exploits are typical Louis L'Amour fare, but the romance that develops between Conn and Evie is anything but typical. I don't want to give away how that romance is spurred on while the two are apart; let me just say that, although it is a bit far-fetched, it is also a wonderful idea and helps to convey the loneliness that I imagine many real people must have felt on the isolated frontier.

Conn is not your ordinary cowboy (he recommends not killing unless a cowboy has no other choice, and he backs up his words by letting many bad guys go), and a romantic Western is no ordinary Western. This is a movie for viewers who like character and plot development as well as action sequences, and it is a first-rate movie (not just a first-rate Western).

TRIVIA NOTE: This was not the first time that Sam Elliott played a character named Conn in a film adaptation of a Louis L'Amour novel. He also portrayed Con Valian in the 1987 HBO-produced ""The Quick and the Dead"" (and, no, it's nothing like the Westrogen with Sharon Stone). Elliott's performance in both films is strong, but Conn Conagher is a better character than Con Valian and ""Conagher"" is a far better story and movie than ""The Quick and the Dead"" (see my review of ""The Quick and the Dead"" for more info. on that movie).",1162512000,7,2390,4.669833729216152
437057,5,6302182840,"This is without a doubt, the best modern western I have ever seen.  Sam Elliot (The epitomy of what a cowboy should be) plays a virtous, rough and ready cowboy who is the kind of man that many men whish they were. Independent, off in the wilderness, and riding the open range.  That is of course until he meets a widow named Evey in distress, (Kathreine Ross), and they fall in love; although Conagher can't quite help from being ""dumb as a post"" about it all.  The elctricity between the two actors is uncanny and just plain beautiful.  I couldn't figure out how two actors could bring off such a believable and convincing job of being in love until I realized that they are married in real life.  It is a wonderful movie for the whole family, as it exemplifies doing the ""Right"" thing no matter how tough the going gets.  Barry Corbin turns in a great performance as comic relief.

437059,4,6302182840,"This is a well done, made-for-TV Western based on the Louis L'Amour novel of the same name.  There is so much to like in this movie.  This is not some grand epic like `Dances with Wolves', the scale and scope of the action are small, and the plot straightforward.  The casting and acting are great.  Sam Elliot was put on this Earth to play the role of L'Amour's quiet loners.  He has such a great voice and presence.  Katherine Ross, his love interest in this movie and his wife in real life, is also outstanding.  Conagher has some great lines in this movie, as other reviews have alluded to.  Ken Curtis (Festus!) also has an important role in this movie.  Any Western with Festus can't be bad.  The cinematography is terrific.  Beautiful shots of the wilderness, the badlands, and the open sky.  This movie is also full of atmosphere.  Without trying to describe what atmosphere is in a Western, the best Westerns (such as John Wayne's Rio Bravo, and including this film) have it.  There is also a certain gritty realism to this movie that is lacking in many Westerns made in the past twenty years.  The characters get dirty and tired.  One small point about this film that I really found compelling was that the shots and lever actions of the Winchesters sound as they really do.  Most gunshots in movies don't sound like real gunshots.  This is a small but important detail for realism, and it really adds to the experience of being part of the action, not just a distant observer.  The only reason that I don't give this movie five stars is that the editing and transition between scenes are horrible.  Perhaps this is an artifact of TV (commercial breaks) or perhaps it indicates that there were more scenes initially shot that were cut from the finished film, I don't know.

But, this is still Louis L'Amour's most realistic and emotionally powerful western story, and the movie captures that superbly.  So, it's the right price and a great story, too bad some work wasn't put into the video transfer.",1134172800,9,586,4.705882352941177

437123,4,6302182840,"Katherine Ross and Sam Elliot both did a great job in this quiet, elegiac western.  With Barry Corbin as a stagecoach driver and Ken Curtis (who played Festus on ""Gunsmoke"") this has a sort of ""let's-the-get-the-gang-together-and-make-a-western"" feel to it, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  It's full of good, wholesome values--an honest day's work for an honest day's pay, don't steal, don't kill unless you absolutely must--and middle-American common sense and courage.

There are some drawbacks, however.  First, this was a made for TV movie, and the commercial breaks are as obvious as in any TV show (although there are no commercials on the DVD).  Also, it was shot full frame, and the print this DVD was mastered from was not pristine.  But for what it is, it is very good.",1125964800,4,788,4.931818181818182

437125,5,6302182840,"While Sam Elliott has become (along with, perhaps, Tom Selleck) the personification of the Louis L'Amour screen hero, it's especially nice in CONAGHER to see him opposite one of the first ladies of western cinema, Katherine Ross.  It's especially nice when one remembers that Ms. Ross is also Mrs. Elliott in real life.

The two provide a power-packed performance in bringing Louis L'Amour's classic western tale to life.  CONAGHER is the story of an honorable cowhand who almost single-handedly takes on a gang of marauders bent on doing all the damage they can to everyone they meet. Yes, a classic battle of good against evil ensues but it's done sincerely and lacks some of the schmaltz that surfaces in similar western sagas.

Add to Elliott and Ross an all-star western cast including Dub and Buck Taylor, Barry Corbin and Ken Curtis and you have an enduring western classic.

437126,5,6302182840,"Outside of the Duke's ""Big Jake"", Conagher is my favorite western as it is done right. The country is beautiful and Sam Elliot and his beautiful wife Katherine Ross made this movie out of deep respect for Louie L'Amour. This film captures the loney life of ranchers and cowboys in the old west. This is also the last picture that Ken Curtis (Festus from Gunsmoke) ever made.

As mentioned in another review, the line ""It's a hard country kid"" is probably THE classic line of all cowboy movies.

One strange thing concerning the ending though, in the book Conagher finds the remains of Mr. Teal, along with the gold he was taking to buy cattle, and on the outside of the Conagher VHS box there is a picture of Conagher looking at the bones of Mr. Teal, but this scene never made the movie? That would have give more closure but I guess it was cut to fit in to a TNT time slot.",1114214400,11,875,4.329268292682927

Conagher was written by Louis L'Amour (Lamoore) about life in the West around the end of the 19th century, with trouble with the Indians, rustlers, and a widow woman (Katherine Ross) tryimg to raise her children on a hard scrabble farm.  Conagher comes to their aid.

L'Amour was a student of Western history.  He understood the common man, having worked as a cowboy, circus roustabout, merchant seaman, boxer and served in the U.S.Navy.  He was also a prolific writer of Western fiction, among other things.

This is not the first L'Amour story that Elliott has played in.  He also performed as Tell Sackett in The Sacketts, which was an amalgamation of several of Louis's stories in that series on that family.

This story of Conagher was one of his good stories, which you will find typical of L'Amour's writing...good entertainment.

437129,5,6302182840,"Only a few westerns have become true favorites of mine over the last 40 years. Conagher ranks with the best of them. Why? The movie was not filmed in a movie lot specially made for movies, like Universal Studios or Old Tucson. But rather, you could say it was filmed 'on location' in a rugged, true-to-life environment that honestly represents what it was really like in the Old West. The Teal cabin and the surrounding country, the ranch of Seaborn Tay, the town - all have that authentic realism that lend excellence to the movie. Often in the film the lighting in certain scenes appears lacking as compared to other films in the genre. But actually, this is what gives the film a special feel, a special ring of realism. It's because you feel as though you are really there as a bystander, watching this drama play out right in front of you in the same way it would appear in real life. The direction of the film by Rebaldo Villalobos is superb and the performances by the actors are absolutely memorable. The musical score couldn't have been better because the selections chosen for the soundtrack apply perfectly and leave an indelible impression on the viewer. I don't know what Sam Elliot would think about this, but I believe this film is his best, most memorable performance of his career, bar-none. His rendition of Conn Conagher imprints Sam Elliot on my mind for all time - he IS Conagher. I don't think he has played characters in any of his other films that have struck me the way that Conn Conagher has in this one. But this is not to detract from the other performers in the film: Catherine Ross, Gavin O'Herlihy, Daniel Quinn, Barry Corbin, Ken Curtis, Cody Braun, Anndi McAfee, and the rest - they've all portrayed believable characters that make for a very enjoyable, memorable film that you will want to watch again and again over the years because it brings something special to the heart. Don't pass up the opportunity to see Conagher if you haven't seen it yet - you'll never regret it.",1067731200,67,2009,4.614525139664805

7822334,4,6302182840,"RELEASED TO TV IN 1991 and directed by Reynaldo Villalobos, ""Conagher"" stars Sam Elliott as taciturn noble cowboy, Conn Conagher, who contends with rustlers (Gavan O'Herlihy, et al.) while concerned about a struggling widow raising her two kids on a remote homestead (Katharine Ross).

Although this was a Turner production (TNT), it doesnt seem like a TV movie and harkened the realistic Westerns that were to come, including TV Westerns like Monte Walsh (2003) and TV shows like Hell on Wheels. Of course realistic Westerns which illustrated the hard, mundane life of people in the Old West weren't anything new, as witnessed by movies like Shane (1953), Will Penny (1967), Hombre (1967) and Bad Company (1972), but theres something about Conagher that especially smacks of the way it really was, which is akin to Son of the Morning Star, released earlier the same year. The quaint, mundane score helps in achieving this tone. While the music doesnt trip my trigger, as its just too humdrum, it fits the feel of the film.

For those not in the know, Elliott and Ross have been married since 1984, which probably helped with the palpable love at first sight element. Speaking of which, whilst this is a realistic Western about the many challenges of life in the Old West (sudden death, loneliness, hard outdoor work, the elements, Indian threats, corruption, outlaws, gunfights, etc.), theres a romantic component with Evie Teale (Ross) attaching snippets of poetry to tumbleweeds that Conn inevitably finds (unbeknownst to Evie).

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 34 minutes and was shot mostly in Arizona, but also Colorado (Buckskin Joe Frontier Town & Railway). WRITERS: Louis L'Amour (novel) and Jeffrey M. Meyer (teleplay) with additional dialogue by Elliott and Ross.
