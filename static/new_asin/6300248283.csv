7807402,5,6300248283,This is a great show that highlights just how great Barbra Streisand could be.  She was arty and creative and used music to light up the drama and the soul.  Makes you miss good musical variety shows.,1220313600,,200,4.378378378378378
7807403,5,6300248283,"Filmed in black and white, with no special guest stars, chorus lines, or glittery back drops, My Name Is Barbra broke all the rules and, in doing so, became a classic that holds that title nearly 40 years later.
She was still a relative unknown commodity and starring on Broadway in Funny Girl at the time CBS aired this.  My Name Is Barbra, originally intended as a pilot for a weekly series, was America's first real glimpse at the woman who defined the word legend.
With just an orchestra, over-sized sets, imagination and some of the best songs ever written, Ms. Streisand turned her first special into a true spectacular.
Whether she was clowning around (Pearl From Istanbul), gliding through the orchestra (I'm Late) or waltzing through Bergdorf Goodman's in a million dollars worth of furs and jewelry singing a Poor Little Girl medley, she is nothing short of riveting.  The concert at the end where she pays tribute to Fanny Brice by singing My Man just caps off a show that is so perfect you wonder why it hasn't been done before or since.  The Answer?  Nobody can sing like Barbra Streisand and in this show, she sings.  Her voice, powerful and rich, comes across as she pays homage to the great song writers (especially Rogers and Hart when she tackles We Can Make Believe from Showboat).
With no special effects or flashy backgrounds, Barbra relied solely on talent and she scored perfectly.
If you love music and want to see how it all began, get this tape.  It is definitely a keeper.",1053648000,15,1499,4.659090909090909
7807404,5,6300248283,"Barbra Streisand first appears on your television screen in glorious profile.  She opens her mouth and sings ""My name is Bar-bra"".  There is no mistake: this is history in the making.  This is the first television special starring Streisand.  She won an Emmy for it.  And she's incredible.
The video is now out of print.  Streisand/CBS Fox released the video in the mid-80's as part of ""The Streisand Specials"" (along with ""Color Me Barbra"", ""Happening In Central Park"", and ""One Voice"").  There is rumor that *all* of the Streisand specials (including the unreleased ""Belle of 14th Street"" and ""Barbra Streisand and Other Musical Instruments"") will see a DVD release in 2nd quarter 2003.
""My Name Is Barbra"", videotaped in black and white, is must-see viewing for any Streisand fan.  The special aired in 1965 when Streisand was on Broadway starring in FUNNY GIRL.  She sounds incredible.
The special features three acts.  Act One tells a story of growing up through songs.  Act Two features Barbra in the Bergdorf Goodman department store singing a medley of poverty songs.  Act Three is Barbra in concert singing standards like ""When The Sun Comes Out"", ""My Man"", ""Happy Days"" and more.
There are no guest stars or cutesy small-talk.  The show is classic because it is simply about the singing.  Streisand did it her way.",1035936000,10,1324,4.932126696832579
