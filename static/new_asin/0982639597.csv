7795102,5,0982639597,"I am someone who lives with unwanted same sex attractions. I believe what the Bible says that homosexuality is wrong. I first heard Sy Rogers speak at a conference put on by an ex-gay live in program that I was part over 10 years ago. What struck me was his humor and his ability to shatter my American Christianity with the truth of Gods word. I have since then acquired all of Sys materials. He has been the number one influence in my life on my journey out of homosexuality.
I have watched and listened to the Lessons Learned series many times. They truly have changed my life. They have given me practical steps to implement into my life and my daily recovery. Sy uses science, the Bible, Psychology and stories from his own life to teach us how we work with God as he redeems our sexuality.
In Lessons Learned Vol. 2 Sy tackles such topics as 5 Categories of Sexual & Relational Problems, 5 Characteristics of Those Who Overcome, 9 Factors In Development of Sexual Problems, 9 Principles of Redeeming Sexuality, 3 Complaints Christian Workers Need To Know & Sexuality & Contemporary Culture.
Even though Sy takes examples from his own homosexual struggle, these principles can be applied to anyone dealing with any sexual struggle. Sy has been teaching these lessons for over 20 years. This DVD series is broken down into 30 minute sessions that would be perfect for any group. The DVD also contains MP3 files that can be downloaded for your listening pleasure and further study.
I would highly recommend this product to anyone with a sexual struggle. It is also useful to any church, family member or friend wanting to help them.",1432771200,,1635,4.680555555555555
