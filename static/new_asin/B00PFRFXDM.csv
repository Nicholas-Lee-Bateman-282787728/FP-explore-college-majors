B movie lovers might get some enjoyment out of it, but there is nothing in this movie that we haven't seen in dozens of better written and acted B movies. If only the movie was funny enough to make up for all of it's shortcomings. It does have some decent acting a few good gore scenes in it though.",1422748800,,375,4.1506849315068495
6798222,1,B00PFRFXDM,"Absolutely ABYSMAL!!! Not ""So bad it's good,"" it's just BAD. Everything about it is cheap and rushed, none of the characters are likable and it's just not FUN. It's just one cliche and trope after another, all executed really amateurishly. If this ""film"" had an original idea anywhere, it would die from loneliness. Clearly the filmmakers are just doing a job, and this is not something they were passionate about. Just trying to crank out another gimmicky, low budget horror movie in the hopes of making money. This is fine of course, except they failed in every regard, from script, to acting, to cinematography, even poster design! This lame, painted poster looks like a teenager did it, and firmly places this in the ""obviously a straight to video"" release, right from the first glance.",1422403200,,790,4.902985074626866
6798223,2,B00PFRFXDM,"It was pretty evident from the moment I gazed upon the packaging for Gnome Alone what Lionsgate was trying to do. They wanted to launch a low-budget indie horror franchise in the vein of Leprechaun. The only problem is the charm and black humor which awarded our little green friends movies annual viewings at St. Patricks Day is covered here in a layer of raunch that will detract many viewers from giving it the same respect.

Just when Zoe (Kerry Knuppe) thinks she's all alone in this world, an old woman (Willow Hale) passes on her bewitched Gnome (Verne Troyer), who is bound by magic to protect his master. Zoe quickly realizes that he isn't your garden variety gnome, when he begins eliminating her enemies in extravagant displays of revenge. Zoe must find a way to stop this mischievous gnome, before Zoe and her friends become victims of his trickery.

I know what the makers of Gnome Alone are shooting for. They are looking for a chance to connect to an audience seeking holiday horror movies to add to their list of yearly programming. People will pick it up mistakenly thinking its a genre Christmas tale because of the titles resemblance to Home Alone. After getting into it, theyll find ties to leprechauns, which will lead viewers to link it to St. Patricks Day.

Gnome Alone has some entertainingly gory kills, but nothing that will stick in your mind the way the ones in the Leprechaun movies do. How can you top being pogo-sticked to death or having a weird little green creature climb out of your stomach? I cant even remember one of the death scenes from this movie right off-hand.

What I do remember is a lot of sexual situations that seemed like they were trying to one-up their 1980s horror / slasher counterparts. I don't particularly like nudity or adult situations even being in genre films. Gnome Alone definitely takes it to a whole other level of smut.

Verne Troyer plays the little monster in Gnome Alone giving the title character an air of creepiness and a pinch of sleaziness. Most folks will identify him as Mini-Me from the Austin Powers movies. The only other noticeable face for me was that of Bill Oberst, Jr. Hes had roles in several grade B and Z horror films like Krampus: The Christmas Devil, Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies, and A Haunting in Salem to name a few.

Gnome Alone will no doubt find an audience who doesnt mind its descent into raunchiness. It goes too far in that direction for my tastes. I prefer holiday and creature feature slashing and bloodletting that doesnt make me feel like I need to take a shower afterwards.",1422316800,,2575,4.6607929515418505
6798224,1,B00PFRFXDM,"Please don't listen to the numerous ""planter"" reviews herein. From an honest horror fan's perspective, Gnome Alone ONLY provides a somewhat it's-so-bad-it's-watchable aesthetic. Horribly shot, lit, acted and written, the film is, essentially, a rip-off of the hilariously cheesy Leprechaun movies from the 90s (even going as far as incorporating a Leprechaun in the intro who doesn't take kindly to having his gold being stolen).

Really, as a film, Gnome Alone is a travesty, It DOES NOT emulate the 80s creature features, nor does it even begin to try. the whole film plays like an Asylum take on filmmaking. Meaning, it wasn't done from passion or a desire to create a cool monster movie, it was made to satisfy the crowd that thinks Sharknado is funny. Several scenes try to tease softcore erotica alongside pointless nudity (chicks just writhing naked in the mud before being submerged in it) while others feature male actors trying to improvise comedy via ridiculous amounts of swearing and dialogue and content that's actually rather mean-spirited toward women (one scene in particular has a cop going off in his car about a girl--and it's supposed to be played for laughs; another has a nude woman randomly suspended for sexual torture). Granted the characters which behave in such sad manners are all bested in campy, nonsensical ways by the Gnome (ol' Verne Troyer!), the problem is, that, unlike the similar movies of this nature, it's neither fun nor clever at all.

While I'm glad little Verne is getting some work, the utter laziness that went into making this film is apparent in every poorly conceived shot and ripped idea. What none of the filmmakers herein understand is that the joke's not funny if you're in on it; when you purposefully try to make something bad for laughs (again, like Asylum). I thoroughly enjoy movies of this nature, I like hot chicks, I like creature-features, I like ridiculous horror... But Gnome Alone feels like a sleazy attempt to cash-in on all of those elements and is bereft of the concepts which made Gnome Alone's obvious influences entertaining. That and this endeavor just comes off as uncomfortable most of the time.

As a campy horror film, Gnome Alone is just awful and appears to have been shot in the span of a week with little to no effort. Even in terms of let's ""get drunk and laugh at a terrible film""--it only registers as a ""meh"". When it comes down to it, I can't recommend a film I can't enjoy sober...",1422230400,,2469,4.845971563981043

6798226,1,B00PFRFXDM,"Gnome Alone is such a sloppy, half-hearted pile of crap that it makes the old Leprechaun series look like works of art in comparison.  The movie opens with a gnome origin story involving a witch and a leprechaun that not only makes no sense whatsoever but it's actually mocked by a character in the movie--when the film's heroin tells the origin story to her friend he asks if it was made up by a five year old.

The basic premise is that if you have the brand on your skin then the gnome does your bidding until you die and the mark is passed on to a new person--except the movie can't even work with this basic concept in a way that makes any sense.  At the beginning of the movie the person with the mark is a bag lady--you would think having someone to take out all your enemies would add some value to your life--making her homeless doesn't make much sense.  After the bag lady dies sweet college student and quickie mart employee named Zoe ends up with the mark but doesn't realize it because it's positioned like a tramp stamp.  You wouldn't think such a nice girl would make so many violent wishes about the people around her but that's just one of the many things in Gnome Alone that makes no sense.  The fact that the gnome never actually attempts to communicate with Zoe directly until the end of the movie is also hard to fathom.

Gnome Alone wants to be gory, silly fun but the whole thing is a sloppy mess that very little thought seems to have gone into--the story does nothing interesting with the idea of a little supernatural creature that can make your darkest wishes come true--Zoe doesn't even realize why people around her are dying until the movie is almost over.  The acting ranges from barely adequate to really terrible and the gore scenes aren't shot so that you can clearly see what's happening which removes all of the potential fun from them.

Gnome Alone ends as it began, with a scene that makes absolutely no sense.  I suppose if I was determined to find something nice to say I could applaud Gnome Alone for its consistency--it maintains a base level of awfulness from beginning to end without a single amusing scene or cool special effect.  On the bright side if you watch the first 10 minutes and don't like it you can safely turn off Gnome Alone because it never gets any better.  On the other hand if you like what you see then it's safe to say that our tastes are very different.",1421798400,3,2418,4.421171171171171

6798228,3,B00PFRFXDM,"Gnome Alone was a fast paced campy slasher flick starring Verne Troyer as the pesky little devil. The acting was on par for this type of film with Troyer giving an entertaining and memorable performance.

The story was fun and I actually liked it as much as Leprechaun. Troyer's makeup was very well done and if it wasn't played for camp value could have been quite disturbing.

The kills were not bad but there was some unnecessary CGI blood splatter. The gore was about a  6 out of 10. There were some weak points but Troyer's performance and the comedic dialogue made up for them.

I like how they cleverly incorporated a leprechaun into the story just for a little more cheese appeal. The last scene was both gruesome and hilarious at the same time. I recommend it to my people, just don't expect too much in the way of grand effects.",1421712000,,838,4.493421052631579
6798229,4,B00PFRFXDM,"** I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

I am always on the lookout for unique premises and interesting creatures when Im scouring for new horror.  As such, Im usually game for just about anything.  So when I got the press release for GNOME ALONE, I had no hesitation whatsoever before I requested a review copy.  After all, I like Verne Troyer, and I would never pass up the chance to see a gnome running around killing people, regardless of how hokey it may sound.  Im so glad I gave this one a shot, too.  The film is exactly what you think it is, and it is a blast.

The title of this film alone tells you what you are in for with GNOME ALONE.  You simply cannot go into it expecting serious horror.  If you do, then youll be disappointed.  Instead, take the movie for what it is:  good, campy, gory fun.  If you keep this mindset, you should have a ball.

GNOME ALONE is shot well for the most part, however there are a few scenes that could have been lit better.  From a production standpoint, the film looks good and does not appear cheaply made.

The acting is pretty good, although I will admit a couple of characters give their lines as if they're reading them off of a cue-card.  But I didn't mind this at all; if anything, it helped add to the campy factor.  Verne Troyer does an excellent job as the gnome, and delivers pun after pun as he spouts one-liners and kills off the cast.  He is the perfect fit for this part.

The special effects in GNOME ALONE are good as well.  The gnome makeup looks great, particularly the veiny lines in his face.  This detail alone was enough to convince me the gnome was real.  Likewise, the gore is solid, too.  Theres not very much, but what we get to see looks good.

The story does not contain much substance at all.  The film is basically about the gnome killing people and the main character, Zoe, trying to figure out whats happening.  But again, this works because the film doesnt need any substance.  Viewers are going to watch this for the gnome and his unique way of killing his victims, not for some elaborate backstory or tension-filled modern day drama.

GNOME ALONE doesnt appear to ever fully take itself seriously, which is part of what makes me like it so much.  It definitely fits in the so-bad-its-good category, which is why I recommend giving it a look.  Much like LEPRECHAUN, this film is chocked full of corny goodness.  It hits store shelves today if you want to make a note.",1421712000,6,2482,4.37719298245614
6798230,5,B00PFRFXDM,"I was pretty impressed with this one, lots of fun from start to finish. If you are a fan of the Leprechaun movies with Warwick Davis, you will enjoy this one. Great special effects and very detailed makeup job on the Gnome. Pretty dang gory at times too and doesn't hold back with the craziness. Verne Troyer did a great job playing the crazy little killer Gnome. He has some funny one liners and is an all around crazy character. Worth checking out if you like these types of horror movies. This is what Leprechaun Origins should have been, lots of fun! There is even a Leprechaun briefly in the story as well, which Im sure is a nod to the Warwick Davis Lep series!",1421712000,3,667,4.344

8687707,4,B00PFRFXDM,"GNOME ALONE

I am not sure why but I actually really liked this movie. It is not to be taken seriously at all and I think that is obvious from the title alone. Of course any horror film with Verne Troyer is probably not to be taken seriously so that works out. This movie actually turned out to be pretty funny; sometimes not on purpose I am sure.

Way back in the day a leprechaun was in love with a beautiful witch but when things go south between the two and his gold is stolen he goes after her. She needs protection so she casts a spell that pits a Gnome against the Lep. So as the years go by and this mark on her goes from witch to witch as they die they get the services of the Gnome. So now in modern times a young lady witnesses a hit and run and takes on the mark and the Gnome unknowingly. So as time goes on classmates of hers that she did not like start to die one by one.

This movie was super fun and while very different you cant help but think of the great Warwick Davis Leprechaun movies. Now those I straight up love but I did enjoy this one. There are some funny moments throughout the movie and the Gnome actually looks really cool. The acting varies of course with some being so bad it is funny but others are good.

You get a behind the scenes for the special features and like normal I would have loved a commentary. But over all this is a fun film that is bad and good and good because of the bad. If you are like me and like these low budget B movies then pick this up. If not then this is probably not for you.",1428969600,,1538,3.9676375404530746

8687712,3,B00PFRFXDM,"The first five minutes of the film give us the story of the creation of the protective gnome (Verne Troyer) and a cameo by Bill Oberst jr. We then jump yo the present where an old homeless woman (Willow Hale) is the fortunate one to possess the gnome. Upon being beat to death the gnome transfers himself to Zoe (Kerry Knuppe) a young girl with issue. She has a drunk mom (Kinley Farrow) who is on meds; a step-father (P.J. Marino) who still has sex with her; a lesbian psych professor (Lonna Drewes) who has designs on her; and a bad cop (Erik Aude) who likes donuts. As the body count goes up everyone starts to look at Zoe as the common denominator.

It is an interesting premise and with a pun  title you would expect some clever writing, a series of bad puns and jokes and perhaps a running gag to keep us entertained. Such was not the case. I thought Kerry Knuppe did great as Zoe and the script did her wrong. It is a film that goes through the motions.
