2739707,5,B000MRA592,This film is visually astounding.  It's full of rich color and unbelievable costumes and settings. The plot and characterization are alright but they are eclipsed many times over by the poetry of the cinematography.  If you are passionate about(or even just enjoy) visual art of any kind then this film is a must see.,1171584000,6,317,4.851851851851852
2739708,4,B000MRA592,"Curse of the Golden Flower had everything I hope for in Chinese cinema: terrific acting, stunning visuals, and beautiful music.  However, these are superficialities.  The film itself was intriguing, but slightly disappointing.  Admittedly, though, it goes to show how terribly superficial and boring American cinema can be.

The story, at worst, is a soap opera.  A family copes with discovering who is sleeping with who, who is related to whom, and who is betraying whom.  Sounds like it might get old? It does.  However, once you get over the fact that the plot material is ""Oedipus-esque,"" shall we say, it's easy to get involved with the story and recognize that it is very intriguing.  Add those sensory details mentioned above, and you have one fantastic movie.

Gong Li is, as always, impeccable, devastatingly good, and...amazing.  She was fantastic in ""Memoirs of a Geisha,"" but she's always better when speaking her native Chinese.  Chow Yun Fat and Jay Chou add some needed tension as well.

It's also worth mentioning that the film is a tragedy.  Since I live in America, and am used to American films, this came out of left field for me.  The plot is very Shakespearean, and quite depressing, but it doesn't make the film any less poignant.  With the thousands of sappy melodramas the fester in American theaters every year, it's refreshing to have this welcome break, soap opera-esque or not.  I'll be eagerly awaiting Mr. Zhang's next film.",1171497600,5,1455,4.950413223140496
2739709,3,B000MRA592,"I usually like Chinese movie spectaculars. The sets and costumes are magnificient and the stories are wildly melodramatic with sojurns into the supernatural. They portray an alternate and fascinating world to that of the Western movie fantasy.

That being said ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" should be a standout of the genre.  Gong Li is an icy beauty and she's dressed up here in clothes that befit the empress she plays. She has an entourage of scantily-clad beauties; the sets are gorgeous; the acting is good; the story is Shakespearean in its intensity and melodrama.

There's a lot of ""Lady MacBeth"" and Aescylus in this tale of a dysfunctional -- that's putting it mildly -- royal family in China one thousand years ago. But ""Curse"" is not a very good movie.  The political maneuvers of the characters are hard too follow -- and I'm not sure they would be comprehensible if you could follow them. The battle scenes are cheesy and computer generated; none of the characters are sympathetic, and there are too many of them to keep straight anyway.  ""Curse"" is a costume drama that doesn't have much in the way of heart or soul.  I'll give it three stars because Gong Li, her costumes, her entourage, and the sets are worth seeing.

2739710,4,B000MRA592,"""Curse of the Golden Flower"" appears to be another ""Hero"" or ""House of Flying Daggers"" but in reality it is a Chinese soap opera. Ironically director Yimou Zhang is resposnbile for those two films as well as ""Curse of the Golden Flower"". His knack for vibrant colors and stunning martial arts is evident in his latest film.

The story takes place in China during the Tang Dynasty. Chow Yun Fat plays Emperor Ping. He is married to Empress Phoenix (Gong Li). She has helped raised Ping's first song Prince Wan (Ye Liu who played Snow Wolf from ""The Promise""), as well as bore him two sons Jai (Jay Chou) and Chen (Junjie Qin). It doesn't take long to discover the drama that is going on behind closed doors like Phoenix's relationship with her stepson Wan. Then there is the empress' failing health and the cause of her failing health. There are a few twists and turns in the story line but they were pretty much predictable especially when it involved Wan's biological mother and his secret love interest Chan. Nevertheless I enjoyed the story much more so than in ""Hero"" and it was less confusing than ""House of Flying Daggers"". I loved the vibrant colors in the costumes and scenery. They were absolutely gorgeous. ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" was a lot of fun to watch. It is a bit overdramatic and predictable but thoroughly engaging and fun to watch.",1170288000,5,1355,4.645833333333333
2739711,5,B000MRA592,"As depraved and corrupt as the House of Thebes, as morally bankrupt as the Hubbard/Giddens family in Lillian Hellman's ""Little Foxes"" or George and Martha in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf,"" (all of which this film calls to mind) Zhang Yimou's ""The Curse of the Golden Flower,"" though huge in scale is at it's core an intimate family (albeit a majorly dysfunctional family) drama which  unfolds during the Later Tang Dynasty (923-936 AD), a time of corruption, dictatorship and warfare--with a mind-blowing, color-soaked brilliance and an almost insane excess that does over-ripe justice to the passions and intrigues that are raging full throttle inside the palace.
The sinister ensemble cast includes an evil emperor (Chow Yun Fat), his desperate wife (Gong Li), his three wildly contrasting sons and heirs (Liu Ye, Jay Chou and Qin Junjie), the troubled imperial doctor (Ni Dahong) and the doctor's bitter wife (Chen Jin) and naive daughter (Li Man), both of whom have secrets that could destroy an empire.
Though all of the performances are first rate, Gong Li as the pathetic consort to the Emperor and Jay Chou as Prince Jai show us the pain and heartbreak behind all the bravura acting: these are brave performances that not only come from the mind but also from heart and the soul of these performers; a particularly difficult task based on all the grandeur and pomposity surrounding them.
""The Curse of the Golden Flower"" is eye-poppingly gorgeous to look at yet Zhang Yimou nonetheless has managed to, in the midst of the thousands of extras, millions of flowers and opulent and decadent costumes, produced a very thoughtful and tragic drama about a family that can't resist its basest impulses and in the process demolishes and destroys itself from within: love exists here but its a love twisted upon itself and dessicated by the bile and vomitus of distrust and depravity.",1170201600,46,1886,5.006369426751593

And by far the most colorful Asian film i hav seen...not only do the vibrant color combinations make this movie so beautiful and embracing, so does the emphasis on every detail !...btw to whoever thinks the producers made a mistake when referring to this period as the Tang dynasty, its not uncommon to do so due to the time it takes to transfer the power from one  dynasty to the other ...sometimes 20 years or more....they did not have ways of communicating back then (no internet) so it took time to implement a new change.....just saying if you research ancient Chinese history, dates are sometimes more understood....but back to this movie, i have to say that the middle son had the best character...and the part that really moved me was when his mother drank her poisonous medicine in front of him, he decided right then that he couldn't stand for her to go through that ever again!  She gave him the freedom to make his decision, knowing that if he watched her drink the poisoned medicine, he would help to force his father to abdicate.......she knew this of course....whats not to like?

2739988,4,B000MRA592,"OK this movie is pretty freaky deaky.  It definitely answers the question of whether Gong Li is able to sweat buckets of liquid off her face and still look beautiful.

There is a royal family portrayed here in a very dim light, and I wonder if they were made to look extra unappealing because of Communist influence.  The freaky deaky part for me was the fact that everyone in the movie proceeded fairly logically toward the conclusion, given the circumstances as they already were presented (the first major presented issue being that Gong Li the emperor's wife is having an affair with her stepson).  But then, at the very end of the movie, everybody suddenly behaved like a mindless lunatic, begging the question of why they were so logical up to then, or conversely, what made them all suddenly turn into mindless lunatics?",1449187200,,827,4.7622377622377625

2740024,5,B000MRA592,"Vibrant, rich, and features Game of Thrones-esque court intrigue, this movie certainly knows how to feed the Chinese Cinema enthusiast.

It first captured my attention on IFC, and I knew I just had to have it to watch over and over again. It's so stunning, and there's so much attention to detail in terms of looks, setting, and its production value is certainly nothing to scoff at. The vanity in how beautiful everything looks plays into the characters and the plot well--it might not seem apparent at first, but its a definite factor.

As most wuxia and Chinese films go, it still falls into that... very blatant exposition kind of trope, but I think that's just part of how that kind of cinema goes--so for those looking to get into Eastern cinema, this'll be a great movie for that! That being said, if you're not a fan of that kind of stuff, much of its intricacies may be lost on you--but that shouldn't stop any movie-lover from enjoying how beautiful this film is.

Features stellar headliners Chow Yun Fat (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) and Gong Li (Memoirs of A Geisha, Farewell My Concubine). The rest of the cast play their parts perfectly, especially the much unappreciated/unnoticed youngest child (I can relate!).

This was my first movie with Jay Chou, and I am so happy to have seen this first--before any other of his films. He's absolutely fantastic here!

Overall, one of my favorite Chinese films.",1444521600,,1421,4.783673469387755

2740026,4,B000MRA592,"This is a complicated movie and may be hard to follow. The sets and the costumes are fantastic. Director  Yimou Zhang, said the sets represented  beauty and luster of the old days and the people represented the corruption on the inside.  It would be like looking at a beautiful apple only to find it rotten on the inside after taking the first bite. A lot is unexplained and leaves questions.  Why is the Emperor slowly poisoning his wife, the Empress, why does he celebrate a festival to honor his dead wife, when she is not dead?  Unfortunately these questions are never answered.  The action sequences are well paced and well done.  The actors all do well and play their parts using all their talents.  The Chinese title of the film is "" The Whole City will be Clothed in Golden Armour.  The title comes from an old poem written by Emperor Huang Chao, who ruled briefly after the fall of the Tang dynasty.  The movie represents the fall of the Tang Dynasty.

This movie is a must see!
Yes, the theme of the story is one told over and over. Actually there are several good lessons to be learned by younger people who watch this. Biggest lesson is: ""Secrets hidden from those you love will always come out one day. Be prepared.""

The actors and director are trying to show us a long ago dynasty that was full of pomp and dignity that all shown on the outside, represented by all the gold and fine clothing. Inside the palace, it was different. There were secrets, lies and betrayals from everyone on the family.
We get to watch as the Emporor ""cleans up"" his house  both physically and psycologically. You can predict the ending, but to watch this evil unfold among some of the most beautiful scenery is breathtaking.",1428796800,2,1108,4.37378640776699

2740141,5,B000MRA592,"Brilliant script; far and beyond anything written by Shakespeare or any contemporary surrealist film makers.
A depiction of Palace drama at it's very finest in all it's horrific twists and turns in hair raising detail; like a growing horror that climaxes in a calamitous ending for every character. This makes the legendary machinations of the European renaissance nobility look like a romp in the park.
it is devious, depraved and visceral, yet possessing a deceptive subtlety that cements the storyline without gratuitous gore or wasted effort.
although it is allegedly based on an ancient poem/story of the period, this film and it's characters is very closely akin on many levels to the O'Toole and Hepburn ""The Lion in Winter""
In other words we are dealing with highly intelligent people here.",1415836800,2,798,5.1461538461538465
2740142,1,B000MRA592,"I had high hopes for this film. Gong Li and Yun-Fat Chou are fine actors who have appeared in a number of compelling films over the years. Zhang Yimou is one of China's most interesting directors, and the prospect of watching a high budget, visually stunning film set within the walls of the forbidden city was too tempting to resist. Everything about this film lures the viewer in.

But then I went and did a foolish thing. I actually watched it.

Simply put, this is a tale of unfettered ambition and moral depravity.  It is about what one individual is willing to do to take power and keep it. It is a tale that has been told many times throughout history, and often with compelling results, but the writing and direction which could have propelled this film to MacBeth-like levels never materializes and the film faceplants harder than Dylan Thomas on his 18th shot of whiskey.

To start, characterization is totally absent from this film. To call the characters archtypes would be overly generous. Take Gong Li, for example. She does her best with her trembling, near delusional character, but beyond the constipated looks she exhibits, there isn't much in the script that allows her to shine. For a talent that has wowed audiences over the years in such classics as Ju-Dou and Raise the Red Lantern, audiences are suprised by a performance that is little more than a succession of beautifully staged still shots of her looking thoughtful, longing, pained, or nearly insane.

Yun-Fat Chou has real talent but, again, one would not know that from watching this film.  His character's immoral nature is shown only in his insistence that Gong Li take her medicine. Other than that, he spends most of his time staring thoughtfully at tabletops, walls, and into the distance, broken only by the occasional moment when he feels compelled to stroke his beard. At one point he strokes it so vigorously I thought it was going to fall off.

The imperial heirs' performances, like the mother figure, are disappointing and little more than auditions for laxative commercials.  When they aren't muttering allegiance to the emperor or empress, they look like they really need a toilet to sit on. Don't get me wrong, their range of discomfort is truly impressive; I had no idea there were so many expressions for needing to go to the bathroom. If Ziang Yimou had thought to shoot this film anywhere near a lavatory, it might have produced interesting results.

The ONLY performance which really stands out for me in this film is that of the scorned ex-wife. When she is captured and unmasked, you can really tell she has a score to settle with the emperor. Her few minutes on screen are so impressive that it leaves viewers wishing for a more-developed role, but sadly she's killed off a few scenes later (and with her any chance the movie has to really shine).

Now I must address the elephant in the throne-room, the strangely out of place kung-fu scenes that pepper this film like hot sauce on ice-cream. I imagine that when Zhang Yimou finally looked at his visually impressive but phenomenally dull movie in the editing room, he must have thought, ""You know what this film really needs? Some seriously out of place kung-fu sequences!!!""

These martial-arts interludes appear occasionally and awkwardly throughout Curse of the Golden Flower (Ninjas in the Tang dynasty? Really?), most of the time as an afterthought, and it's unfortunate, too; if the film had given itself over to this genre, then Curse of the Golden Flower might have been a smash success after all because, let's face it, who doesn't like a good kung-fu movie?  But again, these moments come too rarely, too ill-timed, and represent little more than distractions to viewers, although that one scene where the ninjas come down on wires to that temple in the mountain pass was extremely cool.

I could go on and on about this film's many failures, but I'll finish by saying I hope not many tourists were denied access to the forbidden city as a consequence of the movie's filming schedule. If I had missed seeing it when I was in Beijing, I would have been super pissed-off when I finally sat down to watch this spectacular failure.

But at least the extras got paid. That's something I suppose.",1415491200,,4256,4.788540245566167

Things are not always the way they seem...and each person in the family discovers secrets that have been kept from each other.

It has everything a good action movie should have.",1351987200,,577,4.401869158878505
2740334,5,B000MRA592,"This is truly a beautiful and epic movie that should appeal to many audiences.

It contains action in the form of several one on one martial art scenes, a war involving hundreds/thousands (?). The story moved at a fast clip, was filled with intrigue, secrets within secrets, strong character development, and lethal plot twists.

With all that was required to tell this story cohesively, only tight, focused editing, spectacular direction and cinematography, and flat out gorgeous costuming, color schemes, sets and lighting could have made what I consider to be a masterpiece. One misstep and it would have been a bad joke. But there were no missteps so what we got was excellence.

The visuals frame to frame are thrilling. Yes, if you do not speak the language then you can turn on dubbing or a much better choice, ""read"" the movie by subtitle. The yellow subtitles are so well done and the dialogue sparse enough that dubbing would be clumsy and distracting. This classic and complex tale relies more on character development, facial expressions, what is not said, emotions, and actions, than words.

From the start the viewer is immediately sucked into the story and the suspense doesn't let up until the credits are done rolling. The story is set in the time of the Tang Dynasty, about 928 AD. We are introduced to an Emperor, expertly and uniquely portrayed by Chow Yun-Fat and his Empress, the always exquisite Gong Li who are attempting to do away with each other for different reasons.

The Empress is all alone in trying to save herself once she learns her husband has added a new ingredient to the bitter tonic he has been having the palace pharmacist concoct to cure her ""ill temper and bile"" that will make her go mad within a few weeks. The Emperor got what he wanted. He went from an army grunt to an Emperor through marriage and got three boy children out of the deal. Now he just wants her gone.

They've been together 10 years, so why now? The Emperor is getting older, ready to look at retiring, and wants to make some changes at the annual chrysanthemum festival. He can only hope that the poison has had time to take full effect so he'll get the added bonus of an incurably insane Empress he can then dump.

Watching the Empress forced to swill a poison concoction every few hours pretending she is unaware of what is going on certainly keeps the tension up as does trying to figure out just what she has in mind for her husband during the annual chrysanthemum festival.

This is only a Thumb-Nail sketch. There is a lot more going on all of the time and the story so well told that the viewer can actually keep up.

In reading reviews, I saw there were a couple of nit pickers calling the movie over the top melodramatic and pointing out a couple of continuity issues. To this I say - The movie worked because of the level of drama. It was an incredibly difficult story to tell coherently within a couple of hours and hats off to the craftsman who managed to do it. If anyone gave anything less it would not be the masterpiece that for me it is.

This movie is alive with color, lush scenery including a small village nestled in an old riverbed surrounded by water weathered rocks, and filled with character. It is one of the few that I watch again and again.

Highly Recommend.",1350259200,6,3301,4.568527918781726

The victims of the emperor and empress are themselves and their children, and at the end - all that they have left is each other.  The plot is very complicated and somewhat difficult to follow, and it has many twists and turns and much that is surprising and unexpected.  Great script!

Chow Yun Fat is one of China's greatest actors.  The film has a cast of thousands and thousands and then some - China does huge spectacle like no one else ever has.  The film is incredibly beautiful: the Chinese landscapes, the sets, the costumes, the music, and all of the details.  I have watched this film many times - and it is best in Chinese with subtitles - and there is always more to see.  I would really enjoy seeing it on the big screen in a theater.

The first half was rather slow, focusing a bit too heavily on the medication of the empress.  As the movie progressed, I found myself wondering when it was going to get started.  I felt like I had been duped, when I found that it was little more than a twisted Chinese soap opera with a dysfunctional family.  Of course, the presentation of opulence, color, and pageantry was spectacular, but the story just not deliver enough to make the movie a satisfying watch.",1339286400,2,552,4.65979381443299
2740349,5,B000MRA592,"I remember seeing this in a good theater, probably a Landmark cinema in San Diego and I was really impressed with the whole film.  The plot about treachery in the upper echelons of the Chinese empire reminds much of Shakespeare's classic, King Lear, but with a twist.  Chow Yun Fat was never more powerful as the head and Gong Li is breathtakingly beautiful and ruthless as the plotting wife who seeks reveng--no wonder they picked her as the villainess in ""Memoirs of A Geisha"".  I'll probably order the Blu-ray soon since reading a review of it in High Def Digest which said that the transfer beats the poorly done ""House Of Flying Daggers"" to shreds.",1338940800,,653,4.660869565217391

2740354,4,B000MRA592,"I stumbled onto this movie on the IFC channel & recorded it. I became fascinated by its beauty, acting, and overall atmosphere.  I do not get the opportunity to watch many Chinese movies that are not of the usual martial arts variety, so I jumped on the chance to see this window into Confucian China.

My favorite parts involved some little touches as well as major plot movements: 1) the ritualistic nasal-toned calling of the hour by the signs of the Chinese zodiac, and the calling out of Confucian homilies that went along with this. 2) The acting of Gong Li, who I also recently was thrilled with in the movie Hannibal Rising. 3) the portrayal of Chinese architecture of the period, especially that of the Hidden Palace. 4) As a gardener & flower-lover, I was amazed by the sheer number of Chrysanthemums that must have been used to make the movie (& were probably used for the actual historical events such as the Festival of the Chrysanthemum). 5) The Byzantine plot & counter-plots of royal intrigue, that as one reviewer as already said, makes the Borgias look like Hello Kitty. It's easy to believe that Imperial China actually was home to such intrigues. 6) The martial arts skills portrayed in the attack & defense of the imperial doctor, his wife & daughter were quite amazing. 7) The portrayal of herbal remedies (even poisons), including the porous chair (allowing herbal vapors to seep up from the pots below) used by the Emperor to ease his arthritic pains.

My quibbles with this movie: 1) As another reviewer has already noted, in the attack against the palace by Prince Jai, CGI was obviously used, and it was made to look unrealistically uniform at times during the battle. I think more care (e.g. the Lord of the Rings' Battle of the Pellenor Fields cavalry charge) could have been taken to vary the individual combatants & their weapons, so that it looked like a real battle. 2) The costumes were georgeous, especially in the portrayal of the embroidery of the golden flower itself by the Empress.  However, I find it very hard to believe that the Dolly Parton-like cleavage shown on many of the actresses was actually a feature of Confucian China.  From Chinese paintings of the era, one can see that noble women sometimes wore a lower horizontal neckline in their main tunic/dress, but this band went across the chest at the TOP of the cleavage, not at the very lowest point above the nipple, as is shown in the movie.  If the movie portrayed bawdy Elizabeth England (aka the Tudors TV show), the push-up revealing bodice would be quite historically appropriate, but not for relatively conservative Confucian China.  Whatever wild goings-on were happening in this historical milieu were happening behind a very rigid facade of propriety. Witness the comment by the Emperor that an appearance of ""harmony"" (a Confucian concept that pervaded every aspect of life in historical China) must be maintained in the face of the public, no matter what skullduggery & passions were simmering underneath. 3) Some plot elements & character motivations remained cloudy. For instance, I never felt that the Emperor's reasons for slowly poisoning the Empress were made clear, nor did I understand what really happened between him and his first wife to drive her away to the arms of the Imperial Doctor.

All in all, however, I felt that this movie is a semi-classic that could reside in any collector's library.",1326844800,2,3422,4.847602739726027

It's rare to see a movie that is completely entertaining and truly a work of art, but ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" manages this feat easily with its intricate Shakespearean plot of family betrayal and political intrigue. Beyond the beautiful costume details, carefully choreographed fight scenes, and intricate dialogue, this is easily the most colorful movie I have ever seen - even on ""regular"" DVD, this movie shines with more color and splendor than most of the blu-rays in our modest collection.

Viewers will appreciate this movie for the depth of detail (even after repeated viewings, it seems we catch another new nuance in the plot every time we watch), and for the dramatic horror on display - such scenes as the queen's determined consumption of poison as her husband lords his power over her, or of the soldiers' brave stand, drive home the rot, corruption, determination, and fatalism themes that weave this story together.

~ Ana Mardoll",1278115200,,992,5.0
2740391,1,B000MRA592,"to give this movie an A+, this movie was the worst movie of the year! dreadfully to sit through, not to mention extremely predictable, half way through the movie I already know what the ending is, and I was VERY right.
This movie is an adaptation of the famous Chinese novel Lei Yu (title best translated into ""Thunder Storm"").
the story is simple enough: in the beginning we see the empress who looks like she's about to pass out from an anxiety attack, then we found out that she was SLOWLY being poisoned by the EVIL emperor, along with that we also found out that she's having a secret affair with the eldest prince (who obviously isn't her biological son but still---- EWWWW); eventually the real mother of the eldest prince came up and she works for the empress trying to bring the emperor down ('cause DUH, he cheated on her) but that didn't work out well 'cause the emperor then tried to assassinate her whole family. Anyways the empress has had enough and is planning to rebel the emperor on the eve of the Chrysanthemum Festival, she told her eldest real son about it (but not for some reason the younger son) but in the end nothing happened and everybody died, the End. and oh, there's also this really annoying girl who is really the eldest prince's half sister yada yada yada.
Is it really a surprise I could summarize everything of the whole 2-hour movie within a paragraph? So what did all the wasting, dragging-time scene show you? basically each character going like ""OMG I'm going insane!"" for 30 minutes each. Can you say ""sleep time""?
And don't tell me that I don't get it, I happens to know the story of Lei Yu pretty damn well, and I also enjoyed watching several soap opera and movies of it. This movie, with all its glamour, did not reflect well of its meaning as Lei Yu did, which is about a corruping upper-class family during the early 1900s. That story reflected the corrupting that revolved in a COMMON upper-class family and so reflected the corruption in the society during that period of time. But The Curse is about the royal family in ancient China; um just HOW MANY stories weren't written about how terrible monarchy is? I could count them in one hand, come to think of it I can't think of any.
And I can bet I see more in the movie than most of you. Yeah, I get the contrast between the riches and glamour and the coldness and terror within the palace, and the irony that the emperor appears to be a ""rules person"" but in truth he's as corrupted and twisted as they come. Also I get the heavy gold costume mirror the weight each character carries---- more money, more power, more weight more corruption, savvy?
And of course there is the chilling aftermath of the blood bath battle on the golden flowers---basically the flowers and bodies and blood were quickly and silently replaced, the festival went on as if nothing happened. OOOOOOOOOHHH
And of course in the end the emperor always wins no matter what, even though historically speaking in the royal families it was pretty much always the women who weild the most power, so it doesn't even do a good job sterotyping.
so was it pretty? sure it was, that is if you have NEVER seen a single Zhang Yi Mo movie before. After Hero and House of Flying Daggers you've pretty much seen in all, just add LOTS of gold and you've got the whole thing. people tell me only Zhang can do cinemotography like this; DUH, he's got money
And common, the ending was so incredibly typical Zhang Yi Mo--- the nothing happened and everybody died thing, you've got to be a moron not figuring it out half way through the movie. At least Zhang really tries to empathize the whole ""the Absurb ends with death"" thing, but unfortunately because of the Chinese culture of the honor system suicide is actually seen as heroic so it would totally collide with Camus *sigh*
So if you REALLY love the color gold, and aren't sick of Zhang Yi Mo movies like I do (common admit it, they're all pretty much the same thing), you might enjoy it better than I did.",1277942400,5,4013,4.506172839506172

2740393,4,B000MRA592,"This is a movie that begs for a spectacular high definition release but this Sony blu-ray falls a little bit short.
Certainly this is one of the most visually stunning films ever made.  The colors in this film rival SPEED RACER (and this ain't a Speed Racer sort of movie)!  The costumes are never short of dazzling and the set design is so ornate, detailed and opulant that it is difficult to describe.  The story is the great stuff of an over the top soap opera and the action scenes are loud and exciting.  Chow Yun Fat and Gong Li are superb and Jay Chou is a revelation as the dashing Prince Jai.  This is a great film. The blu-ray transfer looks pretty good, but not as good as you might expect it to.  The colors are vibrant and beautiful and fine detail is evident in the costumes and long shots but some scenes look a bit soft (perhaps this is a fault of the source print and not the transfer).  The soundtrack offers several variations from a Mandarin PCM 5.1, Mandarin Dolby 5.1 and English dub in 5.1. All of it sounds pretty good but nothing really special. Subtitles can be turned on or off for any version.  The extras are just ported over from the DVD release with the 3 minute premier being a bore and the short documentary being fairly interesting and informative.  Sony didn't seem to go the extra mile for this release and that is a shame because director Zhang Yimou went the extra mile to make an extraordinary and higly entertaining picture.",1264550400,,1464,4.432835820895522
2740394,3,B000MRA592,"Any film by Zhang Yimou is sure to leave the viewer with enormous expectations for a meaningful plot, sensational scenes, a sense of wonder at the creativity and artistic expression of this media and satisfaction and fulfillment at the end. This film met some of the criteria mentioned but for me it fell short in the most important aspect which is ""satisfaction and fulfillment."" I was appalled at the bloody scenes and carnage which was the aftermath of an unsuccessful revolt. Having viewed the film twice, my overall impression remains it was not worth the great cost and amount of research it took to try to create authenticity and special effects to impress the viewer. The film is an epic tragedy about an Imperial family from the Tang Dynasty whose hidden lives behind the walls of the Forbidden City were filled with secrets, deception and tragedy. The plot is complex, filled with subterfuge and subplots making this a highly suspenseful interesting film despite its drawbacks. The Emperor lived during an era when male domination was total. For reasons which were later made  clear, he was slowly poisoning his wife. His word was law, he seemed formidable and unapproachable. The Empress and his sons were expected to be obedient to his will and intentions. This naturally created tension in his marriage and jealousy among his sons. Gradually, the film reveals the multilayered subplots within the story. It seems every important member of the Imperial family has a hidden agenda: the Emperor, the Empress, and each of the Princes. There are secret love affairs, one of which is very shocking in scope, although the  parties involved engage innocently in the relationship, not knowing the eventual consequences. It leads to a tragic ending.

The Emperor had been a general in the Imperial Army before he staged a coup many years ago in order to achieve the highest position of authority and power in the realm: to become Emperor. He committed some murders to quiet any opposition. Therefore, he had great reason for paranoia and distrust. One of the most unique aspects of this film is how it depicts the gradual unraveling of secrets which destroys the family bonds beyond repair. This DVD provides a great special feature: an outstanding interview with the Zhang Yimou, the director. He provides unique insights about the film's contents and his intentions. He and his staff did painstaking research for several months to provide the lavish designs and colorful d&eacute;cor to recreate the Imperial palace as it would have been decorated during the Tang Dynasty. This is the first Chinese film which staged such a large battle scene, using so many soldiers on screen. I give 5 stars for the story and the complex interrelationships of the characters. Zhang Yimou deserves high accolades for selecting outstanding actors to play the major roles. The director's explanation of the Chinese virtue called ""xiao"" which means filial duty to one's parents, clarifies why the eldest son of the Empress chose to lead the revolt against his father regardless of the limited chance for success. The Prince chose to act only after learning the Emperor was poisoning his mother ...

For me, there is an overpowering sense of suffocation due to the large scope of this epic. Even the dazzling mega stars who play the leading roles to perfection, Chow Yun Fat (Emperor) and Gong Li (Empress) can not eliminate this feeling. The film begins with highly dramatic orchestral music accompanying the anticipation of the arrival of the Emperor. There are literally thousands of female servants, male workers and soldiers many of whom are dressed alike, presumably those in the same class, who serve the needs of the Imperial family, all of them are dressed in the finest silk costumes of the Tang Dynasty era, awaiting his arrival, ready to serve his every need or desire. It is so very overwhelmng and this sense of ""too much"" continues throughout the film which is why I give an overall rating of 3 stars. Even when the Empress, her entourage, the Princes or the Emperor walk down the corridors, everything is too bright and too colorful. The d&eacute;cor is way over the top. The displays of so much wealth and riches, detracts from the plot. For me, the final insult to the senses occurs during the revolt in the Imperial courtyard, where a wall to wall field of yellow chrysanthemums are trampled and destroyed. When it is all over, the clean up crew wash the courtyard of all the blood and replace the dead chrysanthemums with live ones, as if nothing out of the ordinairy happened. The servants wash the bloody corridors, roll up the soiled carpet and replace it with a new, all in a day's work at the palace. In the end, the film is one bloody mess and I heave sigh of relief when it is over! Amazingly, it is exactly the creative efforts which Zhang Yimou describes that he adds to this film which I find annoying: too many servants and too much opulence. He explained the film is based on a famous Chinese play, which I totally understand because on stage it would be impossible to create the special effects which are overpowering on film. This is one Shakespearean tragedy that went totally awry. In my opinion, it is NOT Yimou's best work. Erika Borsos (pepper flower)",1263945600,3,5275,4.870824053452115

The early scenes of the sumptuous royal palace with its amazing wall hangings and furnishings are stunning. We get a sense of the claustrophobia of royal life. Princes and consorts hurry down brilliantly lit corridors with servants constantly announcing their arrival. Other servants call out the hours of the day. The Forbidden City is a world unto itself, like a massive ant colony, sustained by the labor of tens of thousands of anonymous workers.
I have to say a word about the costumes and jewelry worn by the main characters. They are amazing -- so rich, so beautiful.
The Emperor is slowly poisoning the Empress, who has has been conducting an affair with his eldest son (by another, previous consort) while also planning a coup. Two other sons hover on the scene, trying to calculate their moves. In public, this treacherous group must present the illusion of a perfect family. In private, they seethe with hatred.
It all comes together during a Chrysanthemum Festival in a bloody climax that is gorgeously photographed yet ridiculous if you pause to think about it. We see the usual, whirring, flying ninjas soaring through the air, delivering ballet-like kicks and chops. Meanwhile, thousands of faceless soldiers are picturesquely slaughtered on a sea of yellow flowers.

2740413,3,B000MRA592,"Chow Yun Fat is amazing. We usually see him as the outwardly tranquil, but troubled good guy. Here he plays a scheming, ruthless, sadistic emperor to perfection. I'm not sure why people would call this a martial arts movie. The focus is on the intrigue and the drama. The plot is convoluted. Seeing the movie multiple times would probably help. Zhang use of color and spectacle is impressive.

The problem with the movie is the battle scenes. They are too fantastic. All the palace intrigue works. It is a little over the top, but it is like Shakespeare: bigger-than-life people screw up their lives in bigger than life ways. The fight scenes just didn't do it for me. Too many fights are just too gravity defying. Another problem is that everybody knows martial arts in the movie. The final battle seem too grand. On the plus side, it is cool how they removed all traces of a very bloody battle for the festival the next day. One of the main themes of the movie is how the emperor holds the country together while his family is disintegrating. I have a another minor qualm: there is a lot of cleavage. At one point there were thousands of women dressed in low cut dresses in a court room. My friend from China told me that no Chinese woman would dress in such revealing clothing. The Chinese press took the director to task for the costumes.

The movie worked on several levels; however, it never really pulled me in. In some ways it was too over the top. It was too dramatic. I would probably watch it again.

2740434,2,B000MRA592,"Curse of the Golden Flower is a step up in budget from Zhang Yimou's Hero and House of Flying Daggers, but it's a step back in terms of drama: much that glitters, little that's gold. Set in a palace where everything is a spectacular and highly regimented ritual done on an epic scale, whether it is servants dressing by the hundreds or preparing food and medicine, it focuses on the kind of royal family who make the Plantageneats in The Lion in Winter look like the Waltons. He's poisoning her, she's planning a coup against him and the Crown Prince has gone from an affair with his stepmom to one with his half-sister... Yet for all the poisoning and plotting the problem is that it's rather dull. It never descends into outright boredom, but it doesn't particularly engage for most of the first two thirds.

As usual with Yimou, the moral of the tale is ambiguous: on one level it could be don't go against the natural order, no matter how unfair it seems (father knows best, even if he is poisoning mum), on another it could be know your place no matter how inexplicably cruel you may find the ruling regime. Or it could just be a good old-fashioned tragedy with unhappy endings all round. On a more dramatically successful film maybe the ambiguity wouldn't be so niggling, but with such huge resources thrown at it to such little effect, you feel that it should all add up to SOMETHING.

True, a lot of money has been visibly lavished on the film, but it rarely feels wisely spent. That the corridors of the palace look like they've been designed by a Bombay stallholder with unlimited funds, more garish than opulent, make many of the interiors look more a monument to bad taste than a glittering faade to hide the corruption within. The wonderfully conceived use of colour and design of Hero and House of Flying Daggers here gives way to visual overkill. Forget the golden flower, this definitely suffers from the curse of too much CGi in the final battle as the addition of an increasingly unfeasible number of perfectly synchronized digital extras completely swamp the human element the scene needs to succeed. When the CGi golden army attacks the palace it doesn't really impress as much as it should - the CGi is good enough, but it's also too controlled and uniform, lacking the feeling of spontaneity you get with real extras. Maybe it's just that the look is so overexposed that digital extras seem too much of a cheat to impress the way that going to all the trouble of using the real thing did. After all, when so much is done in the computer, what physical human effort is left to admire?

Nor does the individual fight choreography impress as much as in Yimou's previous films. There is even some surprisingly clumsy editing of mismatched shots in the `smaller' scenes that make you wonder whether Yimou wants to draw attention to them or simply doesn't care enough to finesse them. Perhaps it's telling that the film's most visually effective moment is the massive co-ordinated cleanup operation after the battle as the bodies are dragged away and the palace is quickly restored to normality and that only the film's final scene has the kind of real emotional power that the rest of the film could have done with.

It seems oddly significant that despite the epic scale, only 8 of the cast are credited while the crew, designers, costumers and computer technicians are billed at great length: people really don't seem to be the film's priority. That's sadly reflected in some of the performances. Perhaps it's because the once prolific Chow Yun Fat has worked so little this century that it's genuinely surprising to see how much he's visibly aged as the Emperor. While this is used to some effect, we rarely see why he does what he does, which tends to render him more of a shallow villain when the circumstances really merit. It's certainly hard to see him as the wronged party when his revenge is so ruthless and calculated. But sadly most of the performances are decidedly one-note while the cast wait for their big scenes, with only the female cast making much impression (the film is good on the submissive role women were forced to accept). Yet as good as Jin Chen is as the Emperor's wronged first wife, it's Gong Li who really impresses, and how. As the Empress trying to hold onto her sanity long enough to depose her husband before his poisoned medicine turns her into a living ghost she's remarkably powerful without ever overstating: it's the small details rather than the grand gestures that really count with her. Unfortunately as her stepson and lover, Ye Liu overacts the sensitive angst almost enough to make Nicholas Tse look subtle, yet somehow in their scenes together Gong Li still manages to keep them from sliding away into pure melodrama. Sadly, her efforts are never quite enough to make up for the film's shortcomings.",1229299200,9,4864,4.705399061032864
2740435,4,B000MRA592,"Truly one of the most beautiful films of 2006, `Man Cheng Jin Dai Huang Jin Jia' is a truly magnificent film indeed, with an inner beauty that transcends its glorious set pieces and costume design.  With tragic performances by the entire cast, not to mention the central beating heart that is Gong Li, as well as a heartbreaking story that includes deception, betrayal and murder, this Chinese epic is definitely a film you do not want to miss.

Taking place during China's Tang dynasty, the film focuses on Empress Phoenix and her struggle with her husband, Emperor Ping.  Having bore him two sons, and raised his eldest from a previous marriage, it appears as if Emperor Ping has no further use for his wife and so he has her slowly poisoned with a black fungi that will gradually render her insane.  Once Phoenix uncovers her husbands dastardly plot she sets her own plan in motion to dethrone him and place the kingdom in the hands of her son, Prince Jai.  The Empress's relationship with the Emperor's son Crown Prince Wan may jeopardize her plans, as he turns on his stepmother in order to protect his father.

But there is a twist, for the festival in honor of the Emperor's late wife may be in vain after all.

The film also delves into the politics revolving around the Emperor's rule and the cruelty for which he safeguards his power.  His relationship with his own children is placed on edge as he forces them to cower to his every command.  The film fleshes out very well how the reign of his man was aided by his own ruthlessness and also exposes the lasting affects that it has on those acquainted with him.

So, the film received an Oscar nomination for its costume design, but failed to garner any other major awards traction, which is sad because the film is astonishing from really every angle.  The set design and cinematography is flawless and should have also been rewarded with nominations, but more importantly, the film itself really should have been short listed alongside `Pan's Labyrinth' and `The Lives of Others' as one of the best foreign language films of the year.

And then there is the brilliant performance given by Gong Li.  Now I know that this year was a really tough one for the Best Actress category, and I can't really complain because the Academy did nominate five very deserving leading ladies, but in my humble opinion Gong Li was better than them all.  As Empress Phoenix, Li truly had the toughest performance to sell for she had to make her characters every tick and quiver seem authentic and believable, especially as her poisoned condition worsened.  She also had to incorporate those ticks into her emotional response to her surroundings without allowing them to take over completely and she did so marvelously.  But her performance is so much more than just a slew of technical accomplishments, her performance is a very grounded emotional journey of a woman betrayed and scorned and determined to take what she is owed.

Chow Yun-Fat is also brilliant as the evil Emperor Ping, delivering a very commanding performance, and Jay Chou and Ye Liu also deliver nicely as the couple's two eldest children.

A story of love and loss and despair, `Man Cheng Jin Dai Huang Jin Jia' is a film that is sure to astonish you visually and touch your emotionally.  Sure, the films initial plot is not as original as I would have liked it to be (at least not when you consider most Asian cinema today) but the actors and the director (a marvelous Yimou Zhang) elevate the material and create a must see spectacle that is designed to take your breath away.",1222128000,3,3592,4.682034976152623

That aside, the movie was beautiful. The sets were colorful, the costuming was over-the-top, but I rather liked it. This is not a ""happy story."" It's a drama about internal politics, deceit, back-stabbing, betrayal, and a little bit of good martial arts thrown in for good measure.

2740441,5,B000MRA592,"I found this movie to be one of the most visually stunning epics I have ever seen. The meticulous research that went into creating a lavish set and historically accurate costuming down to the last bead and stitch, including the multiple layers of dress, most of which is never even seen on camera, but authentically recreated to give the actors a true sense of the burden (both literally and figuratively) of the opulence of the Tang Dynasty. The veneer of utter decadence and affluence allowed the absolute ruler to maintain the appearance for the masses that the royal families were to be worshiped as living gods - a belief that some Asian cultures continue to this day.

This movie effectively demonstrates that this facade veiled the fact that absolute power disintegrates rulers from within, resulting in malignance, inner corrosion and depravity.

There are endless plot twists as the members of the royal family clandestinely maneuver and conspire against one another, each one shifting loyalties in desperate attempts to protect their own fluctuating sense of honor and motivation in an attempted coup against the Emperor, with the added onus of having deeper hidden agendas that do not emerge until the climax of the film.

The antagonist is the only true survivor of the coup, having the greater tactical prowess than all the other players, but eventually having to suffer the painful losses and consequences, culminating in the destruction of his royal lineage.

The retention of absolute power at any price is what drives the film. Yes, bad guys DO win in the end sometimes, just as in life, but at what cost? Clearly the victor has won the battle, but has actually lost the war.

I believe that the only error in the reporting of this movie is that it is labeled as action/adventure, when in truth it should have been listed as a period drama.

I have read several very poor reviews on this site, stating that the movie was over-long, plotless and shallow, with no redeeming qualities. Almost all stated that they were disappointed at the lack of real action; the reviewers were expecting to see a ""martial arts"" action film, naturally became detractors because they were apparently just watching their clocks until the ""cool Asian action"" began, unable to simply watch the movie and allow the beautiful nuance and subtlety to flow over them in the historically accurate representation of the era that was designed to show how difficult survival was in the 10th century, a misogynistic period of absolute loyalty and obedience to the crown.

Since it is as much a period drama as ""Anna and the King,"" I find it sad that it was promoted as action/adventure rather than a foreign-language drama. It would have undoubtedly altered the expectations of the viewers, allowing the movie to be better appreciated as a subtle commentary on absolute power, warning away the viewers who were looking for Jet Li or Jackie Chan Asian fight movies.

To quote another reviewer who seems to share my opinion:
""There is no doubt that this detractory perspective is derived from overly-saturated people of western education, without any consideration of eastern understanding and that the history originates from an ancient tradition from which European literature itself was derived.""",1214352000,2,3281,5.018382352941177

Without question the most visually ecstatic film since Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, Spring.. Curse of the Golden Flower is more intoxicating than the empress' hourly medicine! What an actor Li Gong is, and gorgeous to look at. Yun Fat Chow is the first eminence of the whole piece, as he is in virtually every film he makes. I submit that in the end it isn't the camera's magnificence that triumphs, but a story of human destiny told with blood-burning intimacy. Far from being a ""martial arts"" film as it's often said, Curse of the Golden Flower flies from the curse of formula, bemoaning it in almost every scene, with exceeding interior beauty. It's a spiritual film perhaps BECAUSE of its operatic heart, who knows? The scenes are bewitching, riveting; the force of the actors' embodiments lifts the piece to wild heights, which is to say, toward the actual. From beginning to end, Li Gong carries the complete story in her face. Every minor part - the court doctor, his daughter - is spun with consummate finesse. Another treasure is this film's uncommonly beautiful score, subtly integrated as another and equal dimension of character. One of the finest movie scores in years. It's just one helluva movie! If we want 'historical' China and look for it everywhere, entertainment will rarely hand us the pivotal tool to crack the nut. But to congregate the shamelessly intense ethos of China, the koan, if you will, of China, and hand it jewel-like to us, is indeed what film can do, what it can be.

Some claim it is the most expensive movie ever made in China and that the set was the largest ever constructed for a movie there.  Whatever the claims, the visuals in this movie are amazing.  Frankly, I have never seen colors and opulence depicted in such luxurious tones before.  The word dazzling seems somewhat understated.

I don't know classical Chinese history or mythology, but this is supposedly based on a historical tale from about a thousand years ago.  Emperor Ping was a mere soldier who used a marriage to a royal daughter to claim his throne.  He is ruthless beyond measure in keeping it.  His wife, Empress Phoenix feels she is being poisoned by the medicine he forces her to take each day.  The Emperor's sons all struggle for position and there are secrets galore that contribute to their antagonism and ferocity.  The children are used and manipulated as needed by each parent.  I will let you work out the details as you watch the movie.

Is the acting great?  Well, the story doesn't demand terrible complexity in the characters.  Also, remember that Western style emoting may not be what the Chinese acting ethos is all about.  For me, the acting was sufficient.  It was clear to me what was happening and the emotions rang true.  The combat sequences are quite spectacular.  Ninjas are all over the place doing all kinds of strange and almost magical things for the Emperor with a lot of it going on in the air (with ropes).  The various ground armies are also amazing in scope.

So, is this a great movie?  No.  Is it worth seeing?  Yes.  Is it a classic?  I doubt it, but you will sure remember the brilliance of the colors and the army sequences.

2740465,4,B000MRA592,"The year is 928 and the evil Tang emperor is slowly but inexorably poisoning his beautiful, unfaithful wife, after learning that she has been having an affair with her stepson, his eldest son.  He can't kill her outright, because bringing her adultery into the open would discredit both himself and his son, so he takes an insidious revenge.  He's added a new ingredient to her daily potion, a black fungus from Persia that, taken in small doses over a few months, will turn her into a cretin.  But the empress isn't about to go down without a fight; she's onto his schemes and has hatched a scheme of her own: on the night of the Chrysanthemum Festival, when all Chinese celebrate the unity of the family, she'll raise a palace rebellion, force the emperor to abdicate and make her own blood son, Prince Jai, the emperor in his place.

So begins ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" a Chinese morality story directed by Zhang Yimou, and it's a visual knockout: our eyes are almost assaulted by the lush interiors and the exterior action scenes.  The emperor's palace looks like an explosion in a Day-Glo factory; a non-stop riot of color everywhere you look.  The imperial family is covered in so much gold from nose to toes that you wonder how they can stand up straight, let alone move about.  Everything about the palace is regimented down to the last detail and we understand it's all to underline the power of the emperor.  When he sneezes, the earth shakes.

The actors put in creditable performances.  Chow Yun Fat (I wish Amazon would respect the Chinese rule of putting the surname first and stop calling him Yun Fat Chow) gives a chilling portrayal of the emperor, venal and evil, cruel and insensitive; watching him calmly chowing down at the Chrysanthemum Festival after his world has fallen down around his ears is mind-blowing.  The beautiful Gong Li wins our sympathy as the empress, determined to go out with a bang rather than a whimper, even if it means taking everyone else down with her.  Of the three sons, Liu Ye gives the most impressive performance as the weak Crown Prince Wan, seduced by his stepmother, unable to extricate himself from her machinations, and terrified of his sire; he arouses in us a mixture of pity and contempt.  Qin Junjie is somewhat perplexing as the third son, Yu, who turns out to have had his own agenda all along and totally upsets the apple cart.  The minor characters are interesting and well played, notably Li Man as the imperial doctor's daughter Chan, exquisitely beautiful with a face like a cameo.  But the most intriguing character in this film is the emperor's cast-off first wife, the crown prince's birth mother, who reappears in the lives of the imperial family in a singularly incovenient fashion; Chen Jin's performance in this difficult role is excellent.

What keeps ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" from being a great movie, as opposed to a merely good movie, is there's so much of everything, it's all so overblown, that it's more melodrama than true drama.  We watch it, we're blown away by it, but we don't really feel it.  One gets the sense that Zhang Yimou was piling special effect on special effect and the result is a kind of sensory overload.  We're watching an opulent movie and the effects are so over the top that they almost overwhelm the story.

""Curse of the Golden Flower"" is meant to be a morality play, but it seems that the person most in need of enlightenment, the emperor himself, has learned exactly nothing.  He knows only one way to be emperor, and he's succeeded both because of his cruelty and in spite of it.  After all the blood is shed, the bodies are carted off, the blood is washed away, new carpets and chrysanthemums laid down, and everything will continue as usual.  It's as if everything that went before was an inconvenient glitch in the proceedings, and it leaves us feeling curiously empty after the final credits.

(And to the producers: next time you film a historical movie, check your history book first.  Although this movie is set in 928 and the emperor is identified as the ""Tang emperor"", the Tang dynasty actually ended in 907.)

I absolutley love the sets and costumes and the colours.  You can't get any better.  The story was hard for me to digest with all of it's intricacies, but after 3 times, I finally got it.  I love Li Gong.  I think she did a fantastic job on this film.  I didn't know she was in ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" until I watched that yesterday.  I would love to see her in more films.

Incredible cinematography, exceptionally ornate sets, very appropriate and well-done music, academy award-level acting, I keep trying to come up with more superlatives to use for the movie! I thoroughly enjoyed every nanosecond of it. It held my interest so well that I simply could not stop watching it, twice! The sets are exquisitely detailed and opulent, the martial arts used were excellent. It is subtitled, so if you are not accustomed to reading English while trying to pick up on the tonal inflections of the actors you may miss much in their performances...unless of course you speak Mandarin. The plot was Shakespearen in both it's quality and its intricacy. The whole movie centers, and stays focused, on the life of the Imperial family and an upcoming coup within it. One of the other reviews noted that the Imperial physician's wife was having an affair with the Crown Prince, but I think they mis-stated. It was her daughter, Chan, having the affair and the mom became insensed with anger when she found out, since she was mother to both...and they didn't know it. There is so much intrigue and a very complex plot, yet somehow so well-written that I did not find it hard to follow at all.

In a belief system that does not include a linear cause and effect progression to an eschatological justice, this is the 'just' and 'meaningful' and therefore the 'happy' 'ending'; but even those who believe in it like the king are unhappy in the culmination.  Everyone else, struggling more and more manically for a different meaning and a different happiness, are simply trapped in the inevitability of cosmic equilibrium: rebellion is futile, nothing can be changed, things will only adjust elsewhere to compensate and return to patterned balance.  This does not answer to anyone's humanity; and even the king does -unfortunately considering the compensations he must make- have some humanity.

Seeing it (for the first time) at home on this beautiful BD disc, it's hard to hate this movie. Whatever flaws the story had, I just let the movie take me where it wanted to go. Will this movie make you think? No. not really. Is the plot twist predictable? Yes, any reasonably intelligent person can see it coming from miles away. Is it a bad film? No, by no means. I found it quite enjoyable.

Some people didn't enjoy this movie. The cultural and historical context may be a little foreign to Americans and Europeans (Confucian values like filial piety, obedience to the Emperor), which may explain some of the lower reviews I've read on IMDB and here, or maybe people expected Zhang to produce the neo-realist, high-art, intellectual films that he made in the 90's. Nope. those days are gone since he started Hollywoodizing his movies. Just think of this film as a Chinese version of a Shakespearean tragedy and just sit back and enjoy the view.

EXTRAS: slim pickin's here, folks, like almost every hi-def disc made so far, so I am not taking away points from this disc.

The narration on the making of featurette is simply awful. It's the same guy who does all the over-dramatic voiceovers for trailers. You know the guy. You've heard him a million times. He's annoying enough for 30 seconds. But for a 30-ish minute segment, it's quite grating on the nerves. The other extra is a 5 minute premiere clip, and a handful of trailers for other Zhang movies.

I'm glad to have this in my collection. Maybe you'll like it too.",1196294400,5,1725,4.624183006535947

This movie reeks.  It uses the idea of China as the ""exotic,"" a stereotype that by now in the 21st century should be obsolete.  That being said the whole story revolves around a pathetic, stupid, ""palace intrigue"" which was so predictable I figured it out by 20 minutes into the film.  Gong Li always acts good as usual, but the rest of the cast seemed very out of place, especially singer Jay Chou- who just downright does not belong and cannot act.  Moreover, the sets themselves were hideous, ugly, even hard to look at in some places because of the atrocious color combinations.  Moving on further, the use of CGI and absolutely stupid in appearance wire-work distracted from the plot.  There is a long drawn out scene where some troops appear to ""fly"" down onto a house and slay a bunch of people- both unneeded and badly done.  Then the final battle scene is just UGLY.  It is so FAKE looking it makes Godzilla appear real.  The bodies don't even FALL right when they are hit, it looks like CGI pre-Jurassic Park.  And with this movie's  foolishly large budget I think that they could have done much better- or even hired actors (what are they, again??).  Moreover- the ending was terrible, stupid..even laughable.  After you watch this you will be wondering why you did in the first place.  To make matters worse I think it just reinforces bad stereotypes of Chinese people.  The men are weak, foolish, and the women are manipulative.

The film combines romance, drama, action and adventure following in the footsteps of other great Chinese films of recent years.
Moreover, the fascinating culture and traditions of China are presented very well in the film, which in turn opens a window into the mysterious Orient.
Furthermore, the choice of colors throughout the movie is simply amazing!

2740543,5,B000MRA592,"This film is a visual masterpiece.  This movie does not jump straight into battle between the Emperor and Empress (although when it does, the battle is amazing) but instead, slowly gathers momentum until it becomes an overwhelming force.  Be prepared to wait for the payoff but the waiting is well worth it.

Sure the royal family is a soap opera dream with it's incest, murder, betrayal and greed.  But what stays with you long after the movie ends is the question - do the means justify the ends?  Did the Emperor really have to be that cold and calculating to secure and maintain his power to rule during the Tang Dynasty?  For me, the film had so many symbolic layers and nuances that it took me another viewing to fully appreciate every little detail the director placed just so.  Some were obvious like the name of the Empress (Phoenix) and some were more low key, like the hour ceremony, representing each phase of the moon (hour of the rabbit, dragon, etc.) and what follows.  Visually, this movie is just amazing with its color imagery and fluidity.  Each scene spoke volumes just through the direction alone, ignoring what was actually being said (or read).  The palace was obscene with luxury, especially compared to the Royal Inn and the constant juxaposition were another effective tool used in this movie with the most prominent being between the Emperor and Empress.

The one problem I had with the movie - why did the Emperor want to destroy the Empress from the beginning of their personal bitter cold war?  Everything else was explained.  The Emperor wanted to destroy his first wife even though he loved her because she could not provide him the power he sought and stood in his way; he married Empress Phoenix to gain power (she was the neighboring king's daughter); he poisoned her slowly over a period of time because she was having an affair with his oldest son (her stepson) and public knowledge of this would ensure the death of his favorite son.  As a woman scorned the Empress wanted to hurt him in every way possible, even if it meant her own death.

But the Empress was not counting on just how cruel and heartless the Emperor could be when his authority was challenged, for he was willing to facilitate the death of his surviving son.  Checkmate in his chilling game with the Empress.  Which brings me back to my earlier question - maybe the means do justify the ends.  Maybe the Emperor did have to be cruel to maintain rule (the seamless replacement of chrysanthemums and cleaning of the vast palace grounds after the massacre is testament to this - continuity of the dynasty no matter what) and his commitment to being Emperor was resolute even in the face of great personal loss.  Maybe the Empress did have to be so cruel in order to hurt the Emperor.  She had to use innocent people in order to get to the Emperor because he, himself was invulnerable.  But the lengths to which she was willing to go left me wondering.

I believe the answer lies in the Chrysanthemum, the real main character of this movie.  In China, this golden flower symbolizes the sun (ruler) and also pleasure, social interaction and entertainment.  The Emperor and Empress enjoyed their cruel games and it had nothing to do with loftier ideals.  The Empress and Emperor smile with great satisfaction whenever they score a point.  Watch when the Empress sways one son to her side with her healthy tea medicine scene or pauses to air a dirty little secret of the Emperor's first wife that will kill two birds with one stone.  Watch the Emperor smirk as he sits back to watch his careful and oh so cutting machinations at the end.  That is unjustifiable.  My husband tells me I'm reading too much into it since all great rulers needed to exert absolute power by any means necessary to govern well.  This movie sparked a lot of discussion and everyone had an opinion.

2740547,3,B000MRA592,"Historians give many reasons for the failings of a dictatorship style of government, such as suppression of freedom, lack of open communication, centralized decision-making, bureaucratic inertia, violent succession, etc...  But there is one failing often left out of political science texts, but which is central to this movie.  That is, in a dictatorship, there is no safe, established, and sanctioned way for those near the center of power to air their grievances against others at similar or higher positions of power.  Instead, the court of power becomes a perpetual soap opera full of betrayal, backstabbing, hidden schemes and hollowed rituals.

This movie is about the imperial family of China, set sometime in the Tang dynasty.  The Empress is sleeping with her adopted son, but the Emperor risks public shame if this is revealed.  He is slowly poisoning her, but she cannot refuse the poison without disobeying his royal command.  The adopted son is unknowingly having sex with his half-sister.  The royal family's oldest natural son has too many expectations placed on his shoulder, while the youngest son is not given the respect and responsibilities he desires.  All these conflicts become public and get settled via sharp weapons in the movie's climax and conclusion.  The result is a bloodbath in the Imperial Palace and the surrounding countryside.

Unlike other recent Chinese action imports to America, this movie takes place mainly indoors, and in brightly lit rooms.  The martial-arts action is kept to a minimum as most of the violence occurs with metal weapons in grand war scenes.  Hence there is no walking on water, or running up the sides of walls a la Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  There are also no magic weapons or mythology; only family feuding that makes King Lear's family look like the Brady Bunch.

The DVD plays the movie with either Chinese or English speech, which is a nice plus.  I suggest watching the movie in Chinese, with English subtitles, as the English voice-overs are really cheesy.  The violence is graphic, hence the R rating.  However, the pushed-up busoms are as risque as the movie gets; so no sex or nudity whatsoever.

If I had to choose between 3 great movies where they don't speak English such as Pan's Labyrinth, Passion of the Christ and this, I pick this. This movie could not have been done better in terms of acting, casting, action, gore, and especially visuals. Lots and lots of gold in the palace. Gong Li and Chow-Yun Fat are perfect as the Emperor and Empress. It never bores, and it's even like something Shakespeare would write set in 928 A.D. in China in the Tang Dynasty. You can optionally watch it in English dubs, but I much rather prefer it in Chinese with English subtitles: The way it's supposed to be heard. When I listened to it in English, it was good, but didn't seem quite suitable to the mouthing of the words, like you'd see in Godzilla. {Which is Japan}. It may seem a bit slow in the middle of the story, but quickly goes on, as the story does not feel rushed at all with an awesome moral at the end. It's never confusing and comes together when it's almost over. The result is absolutely amazing...

Then, towards the end, the sheer mass of humanity involved (even if CGI) made the ""cast of thousands"" cliche seem paltry. China has had many things in its history, but first has always been the overwhelming numbers of its populace. For all that, this isn't a movie about its appearance.

It's about revenge, intrigue, honor, and the appearance of honor - sometimes the opposite of honor itself. Year after year, layer after layer of subterfuge accretes, until every loyalty and most disloyaties are torn in multiple directions. It's not just Macchiavellian - old Niccolo wouldn't have lasted until lunch.

The fights, and there are many, mostly lack the setpiece choreography that could have made them memorable. The physical combat is the least of it. Hatred to hatred, face to face, this describes a fight between the characters' inner filth, served up in a golden dish.

2740563,3,B000MRA592,"'curse of the golden flower' is a movie i anxiously waited to see.  after the great 'hero,' and excellent 'house of flying daggers,' i was very excited to at the prospect of a new zhang yimou film.

a lot of the criticism aimed of 'curse' isn't unfounded. the plot is barely there, but 'curse' is more a study of family dynamics, loyalty, betrayal, dishonesty, hidden secrets, quasi-incestuous relationships, maternal love and paternal hatred than a grand and epic film.  most of the scenes are confined to the empress' quarters and surrounding palace. only one sequence that i can remember takes place outside the palace--and it's a great sequence (and the only one which really showcases the trademark wuxia acrobatics).

chow yun-fat and gong li are both excellent in their roles of emperor and empress. chow yun-fat is almost frigtening in his cruelty (and i have to say that his salt-n-pepper goatee really works for him. he's an incredibly handsome man--which makes the emperor's cruelty all the more effective) and the ever-lovely gong li is terrific as the slowly-going-mad empress.  since it is more a character study, the burden of making the film watchable falls squarely on the the leads and they rise to the occassion, particularly gong li.  she does a nice job of evoking the viewer's empathy.

zhang yimou is peerless when it comes to visual artisty. i suspect he blows 1/2 his budget on scenery. he crams so much into each you practically need to hit pause every 10 seconds just to take a look at the feasts that are his backgrounds.  as the title suggests, yellow is the color of choice in this film, and he always uses it effectively, even though it sometimes comes close to overwhelming the film.

if there's a problem with 'curse,' it's that does drift a bit into the melodramatic, particularly as all the secrets are 'revealed' and each character's motivations become clear. since it is a tragedy, few people make it to the film's ending, and those deaths are bloody and, for the most part, graphic--particularly the emperor's flogging of his own son. which leads me to believe that the moral of 'curse of the golden flower' is this: don't, under any circumstance, mess with chow yun-fat. he'll knock you into the next decade and not lose a blink of sleep over it. i also found the ending a bit problematic and too vague. it's not that i need all the answers or a tidy bow around it, but the denoument is perplexing at best; and not to mention the score, which at a moment of supreme tragedy, sounds like the ending to an animated disney film. the music is fine on its own, but seems very inappropriate and distracts from the emotional bloodletting you've just experienced.

in short, i enjoyed 'the curse of the golden flower,' but if you're not already a fan of zhang yimou and/or chinese cinema, you could probably just skip this one and go back to 'hero' or 'house of flying daggers.'

(about the R rating -- it seems a bit on the severe side.  sure, it's bloody and violent during the last 40 minutes, but no more so than the average episode of '24,' so if you can handle that, you can handle this).",1182384000,2,3125,4.672131147540983
2740564,3,B000MRA592,"Like most reviewers, I agree that this is a visually stunning movie. The plot is heavy on the Shakespeare and as such it leaves much up to the viewer to seek answers to the questions that arise. The acting is well done throughout, especially Gong Li and Jay Chou who portrays the natural son of Gong Li's Phoenix character. According to the special features he is a newcomer to the screen, having made his mark as a pop star. I'm impressed, especially given the high rate of failure in such a career move. Chow Yun-Fat is good but was a bit over-the-top to me, flaring his nostrils and popping his eyes to convey emotion. Still, there is a scene late in the movie that was as hard to watch as I'm sure it was hard to act. You'll know it when you see it and it shows much more accurately why he (along with Gong Li) are such widely acclaimed cinematic actors.
The movie packs a lot in, from the excessively opulent sets and eye candy to the Greek tragedy levels of bloodshed that come at the climax of the film. When it's all said and done, however, I felt a bit letdown at the lack of substance that I took away from the film. The action sequences leaned heavily on huge battles scenes rife with CGI trickery instead of one-on-one duals. Yes, both are jaw-dropping, but I simply prefer the latter. This movie might be your cup of tea and there is much to enjoy from a purely sensory level, but it wasn't as emotionally gratifying as I'd hoped.",1182297600,2,1443,4.348148148148148

I rarely write reviews, but having read many of the bad reviews here concerning badly scripted dialogues/actions and confusing plot, I simply must add my 2 cents. This is typical of chinese movies. They don't lay everything out for you from beginning to end. You have to actually THINK in order to fully understand the whole thing. And traditionally, chinese people do speak that way. They don't just say it outright, they tend to use metaphors and such to word their intent. Why?!?! I don't know. They just do. So before you start criticizing the way the characters speak or the way the plot unfolds, you should do a little research beforehand (or just stick to cheesy b-movies).",1181606400,7,767,4.774436090225564

It is so good that after I watched it on regular DVD, loaned from a friend, I went on Amazon and ordered the blu-ray version.

Gong Li and CYF are the pros at story telling.  The movie is very grand and MUST be seen in Chinese audio and English subtitle to get the true feelings from the real actors voices.  Although if you opt for English dub, it is very good too.

Firstly, this is among the most visually stunning films I have ever seen and I frequently have flashbacks of different scenes, ablaze with vivid colors and striking images.  Secondly, this among the most absorbing stories I can recall.  I read a lot of Shakespeare when I was younger and I certainly recognized a lot of elements from the Bard's stories.  That being said, I think the film deals with universal themes that are undoubtedly explored in the Eastern literary tradition as well: honor, family values, allegiance and sexuality among them.

I liked all of the color and scenery, and I'm glad there wasn't too much martial arts because that turns me off.

What brought this movie down for me was the plot.  This plot was soooo intricate that it didn't even make sense.  It's like it was wound so much that they thought they'd confuse us but they didn't.  Throughout the movie you're constantly asking yourself, ""why is this happening?"", ""why is he doing that?"", ""what caused this?"" or ""how?"".  How could so much be going on under one roof and only a few people know? I don't want to spoil the plot as someone else has (lol), but the plot was kind of spoiled already. (hehe)

What you find while watching this movie is you're seeing what happens after years of lies and deciet have taken over, but you are NEVER told what led up to these few days.  Even in the end you're left wondering what happened next because it just fades to black.  The ending was kind of dumb now that I think of it.

2740594,5,B000MRA592,"`Curse of the Flower' is a gorgeous masterpiece.  Filled with the uniform pageantry of The Tang Dynasty (A.D. 928), the layers of beauty are unfolded to reveal the household of the Emperor (Yun Fat) whose dramatic crisis is intimately revealed amidst the busy hive of his kingdom.  Treason, incest, and treachery against kin are concretely provided for a drama of Shakespearean proportions.  The queen (Empress) of the hive is ailing with what the Emperor believes to be anemia.  After ten years of ancient herbal medicine, she is no means closer to a cure.  More hemorrhaging is the rivalry amongst the two sons who spar for succession like Cain and Abel.  Jai (Jay Chou), the elder, appears like the humble, reluctant successor; while his bitter young rival, Wan (Liu Ye) has a sword to grind with his past and a manipulative lover who has no little influence over him.  The poor Emperor, revealed with no clothes, is wise to the point of tempering his judgment amongst poisonous ingratitude.  Heavy wears the crown for a man who resiliently defies the Shakespearean line, ""Death hath murdered sleep.""  Suspenseful, the plot lines head for a climax during the Chrysanthemum Festival for which the Empress intricately prepares.

Stylish on every score, 'Curse of the Flower' could have been an overwrought melodrama with not enough substance, but story and dcor only bring out the best of one another.  Never did I feel like this offering was tainted by trivialities.  I neglected this cinematic offering on the suspicion I was going to get an ancient and foreign offering of 'Kill Bill, No. 1' with tiresome martial arts scenes.  Judiciously, the dramatic and combat scenes are gorgeously choreographed and timed to meticulous precision without draining the attention span of the audience.  The battle scenes are innovative in a way reminiscent of , 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' except with more stunning results.  If nothing else, it contrasts new horizons of technical achievement that make 'Matrix' borrowing seem stale.

Intense but expert acting and meticulous craftsmanship combine to make a magnificent epic adventure.  'Curse of the Golden Flower' is a singular achievement for director Yimou Zhang and all involved who assembled an excellent Eastern tragedy.",1179360000,23,2273,5.183561643835616
2740595,5,B000MRA592,"The last Asian, or in this case, Chinese movies have stunned the world with their unorthodox, but typically Asian style that has never entered a competition with Hollywood - because Hollywood cannot compete with such things. I think it is even inappropriate to compare Hollywood to ""Beijingwood"". The Chinese rely much on the visual aspects of a movie, not much like Kubrick used to do, they rather choose an epic and immensely beautiful way, then they mix it with superb martial arts (which the Asians were and still are popular for) and add incredibly touching, Asian music which completes the masterpiece.

I do not speak like this because I'm Asian or I am a huge fan of Asian stuff only - no, I simply like movies of all kinds and like to compare them, see what is better or worse, what is new and what is just cliche. After seing Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Hero and The House of Flying Daggers I was struck by the cinematic wave from China - the movies are just extraordinary, not only in visual and fighting aspects, but also in all other ones like narration of the story, camera work, usage of music and editing and so on and forth. The movies are just something special, but it also can be understood in a different way, so there are plenty of people who do not like this kind of film - agreed, a Hollywood freak will never like such non-mainstream stuff and will rather watch a run-of-the-mill movie like Rocky Balboa where you know what is happening in the next minutes and how it ends even when you watch it the first time.

So, in my opinion (and I think many people will agree), the Asian film of the last decade, maybe excepting the martial-arts-only films like Ong Bak (which are fine, too, but for another reasons), has grown on the movie industry and will not back off that easily. The Curse of the Golden Flower, the third popular movie by Zhang Yimou, combines a very complex story, halfway stolen from and based on Shakespeare's King Lear and other drama, with IMMENSELY beautiful pictures that somewhat may feel like an LSD trip, but in a good way, strong acoustic composition and very fine acting - all four aspects that an average Hollywood movie does not fulfill. As told in the 20-minute-making Of, everyone of us hides something inside, and so does the incredibly great imperial family of the Chinese emperor. Who has ever read King Lear or Hamlet, will see many parallels. The plot is very interesting, but also pretty difficult to follow, in the almost 110 minutes the story unfolds the terrible secrets that hide within every member of the family. Not to make the audience get tired by following the complex paths and threads, the movie uses visual effects that blast everything of that the film industry has ever shown - the movie without sound is a delight itself.

Of course, there are some martial art scenes, but they are not the quintessence of the film, in this case it is really more the story. Near the end, there is a really, really really FANTASTIC battle with more that 1000 real-person extras (not like in Lord of the Rings, 10 extras multiplied by computer effects!). It is just worth buying the movie to see the beautiful mass scenes that will steal your breath. Filmed on the probably biggest open set the world has seen, the crew had huge possibilities to show the dimensions of the palace and the battles, and it worked greatly, especially because you will see the difference between a real set and a computer animated set like in the aforementioned LotR. The acting itself is not the strength of the movie, as except for Gong Li and Chow Yun-Fat, who played extraordinarily well, the actors were not much of professionals, but they did their job very, very well, too.

Watching the movie in English irritates a little, because it is hard to synchronize a I-don't-open-my-mouth-much-when-I-speak language like Chinese, but the audio is still pretty good, although not always. The subtitles are useless, they are more free style than connected to the spoken lines. The specials of the DVD are little, but nice, worth watching anyway.

I highly recommend to buying this film for all, who like the Asian style movies - but also for people, who like watching theatre, or movies with complex stories that do have action, but do not build up on it. Indeed, it would be hard to watch without the beautiful visual work the Chinese have done again, and the movie business should thank them. Gigantic non-mainstream masterpiece with visual fireworks that will stay in your mind for a long time. Cursed with great taste.

Do not buy if you do not like to think much when watching a film, this is not a movie to be followed easily, it will not let you relax.",1179273600,5,4699,4.655421686746988

The movie rolls slowly, but it is interesting to watch as the Emperor and Empress plot against each other, though you see more of the inner workings of the Empress.

I definitely was expecting more martial arts in the film for some reason, but that did not happen all that much.  Though the few scenes were cool, it did not have the consistency of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" or "" House of Flying Daggers"".  Chow Yun Fat is fine in the film, but I wish he had more screen time.  He is definitely one of my favorite Asian actors.

Yet the plot is as thin as an Oriental screen.  Not intending to be a spoiler, like most modern Chinese movies, e.g. Raise the Red Lantern, also starring Li, the ending of ""Flower"" is depressing, everyone dies, and evil prevails.

He kills off his first wife (were they ever really married?) and her family but there isn't a plausible explanation as to why. Supposedly, because of his lust for power, he convinces Gong Li's father (a king no less) to give him her hand in marriage, but how?  He was a lowly captain.

2740647,4,B000MRA592,"Curse of the Golden Flower proves to be a rather complex movie that belied and perhaps fooled some of the previous reviewers. This is one film that almost requires a repeat viewing due to many twists and turns of the story. Its a movie about a corrupt imperial family doing their utmost to backstabbed each other. There is really no ""good guys"" in this movie. If the son was dutiful to his mother, he was a traitor to his father. If the wife was being poisoned by her husband, she also committed incestous acts with her own stepson. Just one totally dyfunctional family heading toward ruins. But due to the complex nature of the plot, Chinese language with English subtitles as well as some poor editing done for the American released, this movie need to be seen twice before everything fall into place.

Chow Yun-Fat and Gong Li are two of the most recongizable Chinese actors out there and they both gave a strong performance that complemented each other. They were well supported by their supporting cast and production values of this movie proves to be strong. Directed by Ghang Yimou who did Hero and House of the Flying Daggers, the usages of colors and costumes in this movie make it visual feast for the eyes.

I found the movie to be interesting and entertaining. The major weakness of this movie appears to be that its over edited. It pretty clear that the American version cut out few scenes here and there. The running time of 114 minutes appears to be too short. The only feature that come with this DVD, the making of this movie, it pretty clear that some parts of this movie have been cut for reasons unknown. But that does make the movie flow more jerky-like then smooth. It also short changed the story and the script, perhaps thinking that American audience may not have the patience to sit through a good story before the action.

The DVD of this movie proves to be in an excellent shape. The images and colors proves to be vivid and shape. The 5.1 DD is pretty aggressive and clear. The only major featuratte of this DVD is the ""Making of"" feature that proves to be mildly interesting.

Overall, a pretty spectacular film with a real meat of a story that got short changed by poor editing. Maybe someday, we will get to see the whole thing but until then, this movie come well recommendation to buy instead of rent since if you haven't seen it already in the theater, it worth watching it twice to get the whole gust of this whirlwind story.",1177804800,3,2461,4.536036036036036
2740648,4,B000MRA592,"Zhang Yimou directed this wonderful epic.  His ""Raise the Red Lantern"" was nominated for a Best Foreign Language film Oscar in 1991 as was ""Hero"" in 2002.  ""Curse of the Yellow Flower"" does not have the swashbuckling pyrotechnics of ""House of Flying Daggers,"" but it does have a domestic intimacy surrounded by the grandeur of the Chinese royal court.  Chow Yun-Fat from ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" plays the ruthless emperor who kills his youngest son to protect his throne.  We watched the racing DVD ""Initial D"" with Chinese pop singer Jay Chou recently.  It is a real shift to watch him almost back-to-back with this film where he goes from heartbroken teen race car driver to martial arts prince in a period film.  What a stretch!  As Prince Jai who sides with the Empress, he does a great job of leading hordes of golden-uniformed soldiers into battle.  The battle sequences with the various armies color coded in gold, blue, red or silver is visually stunning.  Gong Li is one of the world's most accomplished actresses.  From ""Zhou Yu's Train"" to ""The Story of Qui Ju"" for which she won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the 1992 Venice Film Festival to ""Memoirs of Geisha"" for which she won Best Supporting Actress from the National Board of Review, she plays an array of characters.  As the Empress, her performance is subtle, nuanced and varied as she experiences madness and then the bitterness of discovery that she is being poisoned.  The odd note for the character is her love affair with her stepson, which seems a bit unusual by today's Western standards.  Liu Ye played the violinist Ma in his first film ""Balzac & the Little Chinese Seamstress.""  Here, as the middle son and crown prince, he plays a character not sure of himself & not desirous of power.  It proves a lethal dose as he tries to commit suicide before being run through by his younger sibling, Prince Yu played by Qin Junjie in his first film.  The supporting players are all fabulous including Ni Dahong as the doctor & Li Man as his daughter Chan.  While I didn't get her name, the woman who plays the doctor's wife turns in a superb performance.  The costume design is exquisite as reflected in the film's lone Oscar nomination for Yee Chung-man's Best Costumes.  Zhou Xiaoding's cinematography is also exquisite as reflected by awards from both the Boston & New York Film Critics Societies.  American films today rarely have a sense of classical tragedy such as Yimon's films can reflect.  Gong Li is worth the price of admission, but there is so much more.

2740649,5,B000MRA592,"The hardest thing to do with this film is explaining exactly what it's about. You have an emperor (Chow Yun-Fat) who has been away taking care of business but is now returning home for the chrysanthemum festival. You have an Empress who has been waiting for him to return home for even longer than he's been gone. His wife grew lonely and turned to her stepson for love among other things. Then there's her maternal sons, Prince Jai will be a great emperor and will stand by her side to the end. Prince Yu gets little love from either of his parents but he knows the little secret between his stepbrother and mother. There is so much that happens in the film that I can't tell anymore but most likely you'll put it together before it ends.

With so much going on and so many characters there is truly little room for character development. So many other elements cover for the lack of character development that I stopped caring about it by the middle of the movie. One major example is the story, which was predictable but was written so well that I still enjoyed how it was pieced and how it unfolded. As seen in the previews it's obvious that this movie has beautiful settings, maybe the most beautiful and colorful I've ever seen. I'm not the type to really pay attention to costumes but the costumes in this movie were out of this world. The settings and costumes are what you notice first when the film opens.

There aren't too many action scenes and this may actually get to some people but the story makes up for that too. The acting was all around great especially the newcomers. Chow Yun-Fat was great and he showed that he is an all around great actor and can play any roll. Of course Li Gong did a great job. I think that the action scenes that were in the movie were excellent but the CGI Zhang Yimou likes to use still gets on my nerves. It makes the fights look more fake than real but it wasn't used as much as it was in ""House of Flying Daggers"".

I read some reviews for this film right before I went out to rent it and found them to basically say this film is mediocre. I was tempted to just forget about this film because of those comments but they didn't really make any good points as to why I shouldn't see it. I still had to see this film mostly because of the amazing and colorful preview. After seeing this movie I understand why it might not have reached some peoples expectations. The problem with Curse of the Golden Flower is the previews definitely advertise the film to have a pretty good amount of action or to be action packed. This film being from the same director of ""Hero"" and ""House of Flying Daggers"" I think a lot of action presented evenly throughout the film was expected. Though I understand this problem it was not one that I had with the film. You could say that it relies on its beautiful and I do mean beautiful settings but the story has some life in it as well. This is a great film and very much worth seeing but some people will love it and some will find flaws in it. It depends on how much of your imagination you let run with it.",1177286400,6,3084,4.304647160068847
2740650,1,B000MRA592,"""The Curse of the Golden Flower"" while offering striking scenes of epic proportion akin to any multi-million dollar venture offers little more than conspicuous consumption. There are dramatic scenes illuminated in gold, flowers and such...seemingly like an olympic prelude. This movie lacks sufficient character development, such as Yimou's other ventures such as ""the road home,"" ""hero"" ""house of flying daggers"" ""raise the red lantern"" and ""to live."" Those movies captivating in both cinematography, character and emotion. It strikes a chord in the soul upon watching these films. However, I was highly disappointed in this venture because the characters were not drawn out. Gong Li's character, Chow Yun's character and such were not really full people that I cared about. Jay Chou's character is probably the most believable, however none of the plot seems to amount to much even with all the shimmering glam and low cut europeanized outfits the women wear. It does not appear to even be the Tang Dynasty, the culturally rich dynasty in Chinese history. The costuming, including the armor looks alien, appearing to be more Victorian era than Tang Dynasty and detracts from the film. Though it was effective in highlighting the extent of corruption, it fell so far short of Zhang Yimou's ability. I felt as if that hour and 45 minutes lay wasted before me in the strange decadence of the film. There is no particular dialoug or scene that sticks out in my conscious and I was not moved by any aspect of this vastly empty film. Maybe I expect to much from such a brilliant filmmaker and writer, but I cannot understand why such a film was even made, why so much money was wasted and why Zhang Yimou or Gong Li, Chow Yun Fat or Jay Chou would attach their names to such a waste of time.",1177027200,11,1787,4.8431372549019605

While the fantasy aspect from the previous films occured, they did so in a far more real light, and were only used in a very minor way.  But that's to the side.  The meat of this movie is the story of the corrupt royal family, in an almost King Lear or Greek Tragedy form.  The events unfold in a slow, but ultimately very satisfying way, with twists and turns that throw what you thought you knew out the window.  The performances by all involved were amazing, and I was able to loose the fact that Chow Yun-Fat was not his usual charming self, but instead a utterly cruel and tryanical emperor.  While I would like to say this is a movies for fans of Hero and House of Flying Daggers, I can't.  This a different type of movie, but is none the less a very satisfying one.

2740672,3,B000MRA592,"Note: Chinese with English subtitles (optional feature with audio in English and Mandarin).

`Curse of the Golden Flower' released in `07  is a strange, confusing mixture of genres that leaves one to wonder what was the original intent behind making this film. Is it a period piece, an exotic romance, a tale of political intrigue, an opulent soap opera, or a violent and bloody martial arts epic? Well, it's all of the above and I guess that's ok if the formula works. Unfortunately for the majority of the film it doesn't.

The movie begins slowly with the Emperor and his royal family doing partaking in long sequences of introductions and posturing. The English subtitles are stiff and lacks substance, too bad I don't speak Chinese. The film does gain some momentum midway through but then a lot of what it gains is lost in an endless torrent of blood and death at the end. As for the overall message of the film, I would surmise it's something much like that of `Hero.' The Emperor is always right no matter how wrong he really is.

While `Curse of the Golden Flower' does supply the magnificent visuals we've come to expect from Chinese epics in recent years the film lacks the artistic style and poetic depth of such classics as `Hero' and the romantic, emotional impact of `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.'

Another area where this film falls short of expectations is the dismal soundtrack that is reminiscent of a never-ending funeral dirge. It's slow, monotonous, boring and pompous. Definitely not something you would listen to on its own.

On a positive note, the cast is excellent with such well known stars as Chow Yun-Fat and Gong Li and lesser known but fine performances by Chou Jay, Liu Ye and the very lovely Li Man as Chan.

If you watch it just for the visuals you won't be disappointed. My rating: 3  Stars.",1176422400,24,1830,4.696875

2740674,3,B000MRA592,"While it's undeniable that Curse of the Golden Flower is visually stunning throughout, the plot leaves much to be desired. The royal family has many terrible secrets. That's the basic plot. Although the semblance of a full story is attempted, it never really develops entirely, which leaves the viewer with many questions and much confusion when the credits finally roll.

Also, there's not much action although the preview consisted almost entirely of action. So, a misleading preview is another downfall of this film. The problem is that at its core Curse of the Golden Flower is an intimate family portrait of a royal family that is falling apart. But the characters aren't developed enough (or likeable enough) to keep the viewer's attention, or to pull any heartstrings.

The lavish costumes and sets are beautiful to look at, but they start to blend into each other when everything is the same goldish color. The actions scenes are amazing, but too few and they don't come in til after the first hour of the film.

Anyway, most reviewers are right in saying this is a film you want to rent because I don't there's much rewatch value here.",1176336000,5,1144,4.826530612244898
2740675,5,B000MRA592,"Firstly lets be clear about thing, this is not a martial arts movie  though it has some incredible martial arts scenes that will take your breath away and leave you looking on in stunned wonder.

Also it is a foreign language film, fortunately not dubbed but with subtitles, not everyone's cup of tea but this will not stop you from enjoying ever single second of it, from the opening credits to the blood splattered ending.

The Curse of the Golden Flower is a sumptuous tale about family secrets, revenge, lust, desire, incest, adultery, power, and corruption, all wrapped up in a beautiful but very flawed package that is the Forbidden City of 10th century China.

Never before has one come across such a dysfunctional family as the Tang dynasty, the exquisite but deadly Empress Phoenix, played by the gorgeous Li Gong, the thoroughly amoral Emperor Ping, a glorious Yun Fat Chow in his element, his three sons, the weak Crown Prince Wan (Ye Liu)who has been having an affair with his stepmother, the Empress, Prince Jai, (Jay Chou) brilliant solider, and loyal son to his mother, torn between duty and love, he will make a fateful decision that will herald the beginning of the end for his family.  And last but certainly not least the spoilt and unloved Prince Yu, (Junjie Qin) whose hatred of his family is cunningly disguised by his seemingly placid nature and acceptance of his lowly third son status.

Add to this mix, an Imperial Physician (Dahong Ni) with a wife (Jin Chen) whose connection to the royal household is a closely guarded secret, her daughter the lovely Chan (Man Li) who is is in love with the Crown Prince and you have the ingredients for a tragedy on a scale that can only be imagined.

With breathtaking scenery, the carpet of golden chrysanthemums has to be seen to be believed, fantastic costumes, atmospheric background music, coupled with stunning fight sequences between assassins and royal guards you will be left with your jaw hanging down as you witness the golden warriors go into battle against the Emperor and the twists and turns in a film that is none stop action and intrigue throughout.

The overall acting is without doubt perfection on celluloid, its a shame it didn't win an Oscar but sometimes Hollywood gets it wrong, and boy did they get it wrong this time!",1176249600,7,2307,4.764411027568922
2740676,3,B000MRA592,"'Curse of the Golden Flower' starts off intriguingly enough, but that's more or less where its allure ends since it never really delivers on its grandiose ambitions, except on a mostly visual basis.

First of all the cinematography is stunning, then again this is to be expected by Zhang Yimou given his already impressive filmography.  His films have this larger than life scope that are simply breathtaking to behold in terms of set designs and choreography, whether it's martial arts or battles and this film is no exception to the rule.  Zhang's ability to coordinate a myriad of events into one seamless scene after another is remarkable, but this time around his directorial blessing is cursed by his inferior script.

'Curse of the Golden Flower's story suffered from lack of character development and mostly unsympathetic participants, then there is the issue of significant plot holes as well.  Some of the fight scenes were incongruous as well as superfluous both in execution as well as relevance, and various characters' motivations were far from explained sufficiently, particularly towards the end.

The first half of the film dragged plot wise and then all of a sudden there was a rush during the final chapter to expose various characters' dark secrets and desires, some that literally came out of nowhere which added almost nothing worthwhile to the overall story.

Aesthetically pleasing to be sure, with amazing locations, beautiful costumes, effective makeup and captivating cinematography, but despite those strong elements as well as decent acting, it really does not work all that well without an equally powerful plot to support their weight.  Chow Yun Fat is a highly capable actor but unfortunately he does not have enough material to truly showcase his talent, as seen in the superior film 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'.  Gong Li was the strongest performer of the cast, but even her effort was not enough to save this film since the script does not fully explain her motivation and as such it made it difficult to relate to her, and the same was true for the rest of the actors.

The real story behind this piece of ancient Chinese history is interesting, but the script does not really reflect it that well, primarily because it assumes too much prior knowledge from the audience, and essentially jumps into the middle of the story with little to no introduction of all the circumstances regarding events and characters.  For a film that lasts nearly two hours there is an awful small amount of plot development and it's not enough to justify its length.

Zhang Yimou wrote the script, but clearly he is a more talented director than writer.  This film's script suffers from some of the same problems as another movie he wrote and directed, 'House of Flying Daggers', although it had a little more cohesive storyline than his latest creation.

I would recommend renting this film to any fan of Zhang's prior work as well as newcomers, but it's not the kind of film worth watching more than once, unless one mostly watches films for their aesthetic value.  For those expecting a captivating and in depth storyline, skip this tragic yet empty tale.",1176076800,7,3178,4.969811320754717

2740678,3,B000MRA592,"Allusions to _The Lion in Winter_ while discussing _Curse of the Golden Flower_ are well-earned, because in the beginning there do seem to be some similarities--the current emperor (Chow Yun Fat), relatively late in his years as ruler, has some disagreement when it comes to naming the successor among his three sons.  His wife (Gong Li) of course has her own plans.

But what is the essence of royal family drama if it is NOT the squabbles that go on in regards to succession?  This has been the stuff of Shakespeare and even before, so while some parallels to _The Lion in Winter_ may seem obvious, _Winter_ explores a bit more of the powerful connection and disparity between love and power, while _Curse of the Golden Flower_ seems to dwell mostly on the essence of family secrets themselves.  While the secrets aren't all that much of a surprise (and I tend to think shouldn't be, for the film's focus seems to be out to present the intricacies of secrets among royal family members and the anguish they cause), they do combine to create a web of deceit that this family seems to tread upon each day, knowing of each other's deceit and yet co-existing (to an extent) at the same time...

...until, of course, those secrets come full circle at the Festival of Chrysanthemums, where all will be revealed...

Of course, since this is directed by Yimou Zhang, there are spectacular and thickly casted sequences to be expected, and Zhang does not disappoint.  With this film and _Hero_, Zhang presents the awe and spectacle and the power of the emperial days in a way that _300_ could only put as a backdrop, but the sheer walls of humanity that are used in some of the stunning fight sequences of _Curse of the Golden Flower_ are amazing to behold.  Ancient warfare has finally been dealt with cinematically the way historians have known about it for decades--as an organized force of awesome power.  But Zhang also keeps the awesome visuals to moments even as small as the announcing of the hour in the hallways of the palace, or in sneak attacks on the Emperor's enemies.

The battles and visuals of _Curse of the Golden Flower_ are a wonder to behold, especially in the second hour, but the flow of this movie falls victim to the slower moments of _Hero_, when the storyline circulates too much in one spot in a way that doesn't really forward the story, but muddles itself in a fascination for the distrust the royals hold for each other.  Since this has been a theme for centuries, it might have been more productive to have let that web of secrets tell us something further about humanity, rather than look simply at who might be a little better at this secrets game than others.",1175904000,6,2686,4.6455696202531644

I have read other's reviews who have given very high ratings based simply on the splendor of the costumes, etc, but you really need to do yourself a favor and only rent this movie.  If you base great movies on costumes only or superficiality, then this movie is perfect for you.  If you enjoy great movies with great fight scenes like Crouching Tiger, Hero, or House of the Flying Daggers, then this movie is way sub-par.

Take the lowest star ratings in the series of user reviews here, and that quite well writes up what I could spend 10 minutes trying to rephrase in my own words.

Yes it was beautiful and stunning.  But it was still a sick minded purposeless tragedy.  My spirit is lowered by the waste of talent and money that went into this story.

It reminds me of the hyped shock and awe of the 2nd gulf war.  Over the top glamor, talent, money and effort being put to use in a direction that hurts humanity.

Its part of a healthy human nature to appreciate stories and characters you can cheer.  Yet even in the stories of misfortune that get passed down through the centuries via religions and mythologies, there is usually a moral lesson we treasure.  This movie had neither.

In ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" he once again shows us why. It is very beautiful. The scenery, the lighting, the fight choreography, the music, even the actors are beautiful. The direction and editing of course are solid.

Yet there seems to lack substance in the midst of all this beauty. The story is simple with no real twists or turns, the costumes, beautiful as they may be, are not very realistic, and there's a definite lingering feeling that a lot of the scenes in the movie are only there because they can be, eg massive (MASSIVE) armies, HUGE amounts of servants etc.

Basically it follows the current Chinese formula for a grand picture: stunning scenery, beautiful costumes, gorgeous women, and impressive numbers of organized people. There seems to be a competition going on between Zhang Yimou, Feng Xiaogang and the other Chinese directors who can make the most beautiful, most stunning and altogether biggest film.

""Curse of the Golden Flower"" will entertain you for a couple of hours, sure, but it's still far, far away from ""Hero"", which in my humble opinion is not only Zhang Yimous best picture, but one of the best pictures period.",1175472000,4,1300,4.846846846846847

2740705,4,B000MRA592,"Rarely have I seen a movie as bursting with luminosity and color as Yimou Zhang's ""Curse of the Golden Flower,"" an eye-popping tale of palace intrigue set in late 10th Century China. Li Gong plays the beautiful Empress Phoenix, who is slowly being poisoned by her husband, the Emperor Ping (Yun-Fat Chow), as punishment for the affair she is having with her stepson and heir-to-the-throne, the Crown Prince Xiang. When she discovers what is being done to her, she enlists the aid of one of her own sons (Ye Liu) to help her carry off a carefully orchestrated coup against his father.

""Golden Flower"" has just about everything a historic drama done in the grand operatic style needs to be successful: passion, forbidden love, incest, jealousy, betrayal, revenge, family secrets, and, of course, oodles and oodles of blood-soaked battle sequences that pay homage to the richest traditions of the martial arts (picture to yourself an oriental ""Lord of the Rings"" to get some idea of the scale and scope of these fight scenes). The melodrama does get a bit out-of-hand from time to time, hitting a peak of silliness long about the last half hour or so of the movie. But the film itself is so visually ravishing and gorgeous to look at that we go along with it even when it's not all that easy to take the story it's telling very seriously.

Prime credit for the movie's success goes to cinematographer Xiaoding Zhao, who has wrought various miracles with his lighting and camera, making the rich and shimmering colors literally pop from the screen in unmatched brilliancy and vibrancy. Equally stunning are the production and costume design by Tingxiao Huo and Chung Man Yee, respectively.

The setting, the palace, the costumes, all the elements that build the image we see on the screen are marvellous and admirable, even if the falling weapons sound like table forks and if it all looks like an illusionary illusion of beaming gold and silver. The intrigue, the plot, the action is nothing at all except some wide and hefty internal fight in the imperial family that is reduced to a pack of rats in a big pot. They eat one another alive and their mouths are dripping with blood, human blood mind you, more than the mouth of Anne Rice's vampires. So we jump from father killing to mother killing to brother killing to neighbour killing to whatever you may think of killing, and of course the boss will save his skin with a little help from some ninja turtle warriors and from some soft Kung Fu fighters. It is kind of sad to see so much money wasted on such a super production that has no meaning, not even that of a metaphor of the modern world. Luckily our world has changed slightly and you don't need to kill your mother, your father, your brothers and sisters to become president of our modern states, even if at times the competition is tainted with some doping activity trying to boost your votes.

The Zhiang Yimou direction (Hero, House of Flying Daggers) and his story script are riveting as this film builds pace from a necessarily slow start - it is dramatic instead of melodramatic, with its endng shots truly disturbing and painful; it has an emotional depth beneath its stunning surface. Gong Li, so often his partner and also hi ex-lover, surely has to be one of the greatest actresses of the past decade -- can you think of a less than compelling performance from her? Red Lantern, 2046, Memoirs of a Geisha, Concubine, Shanghai Triad, even Miami Vice? Or a less than subtle and powerful one from Chow Yun Fat (Crouching Tiger, Anna and the King of Siam)? The sheer beauty of every scene can lead the viever perhaps to discount the power of the acting and the story. It is a study of power and evil. While Gong Li owns the screen, Chow Yun Fat owns the plot. Amid all the costumes and decor, they come alive so vibrantly. There is not a false note in any scene.

What a rich wealth of films China is producing! And along with Gong Li comes Zi Yi Zhang (Hero, Daggers, Crouching Tiger, Geisha,2946) and Maggie Chung. And Zhang Zimou is the master director who brings out their beauty and brilliance.

The acting is brilliant; Chow Yun-Fat and Gong Li give the kind of nuanced performances that you seldom see in American films and if you are still raving about ""Wild Hogs"" or ""Night at the Museum"" be assured that you will miss almost everything that makes this film great.  The plot revolves around the members of a royal family, a stiff and formal bunch even by imperial dynastic standards.  You see, the emperor is an eccentric fellow, absolutely unshakeable in his belief that all things have their place and each must serve their purpose to a T.  Watching the family interact is uncomfortable to begin with, and as the film progresses we see what lies beneath the layers of this family's veil of propriety.  Believe me, it ain't pretty.  Each member of the family plays their role as they are expected too, but the end result is far from the order that their patriarch craves so much; what eventually comes out of this perfect family is utter and complete chaos. While the story slowly unfolds and builds toward the momentous climaxes, we are treated to the wonderful sights of the imperial palace, which is like a character unto itself in the movie, so beautiful that it even forced mine eyes to veer away from the always-enchanting Gong Li on several occasions.  The first few acts will no doubt bore your average movie-goer looking for the superb action scenes that we've come to expect from these high-profile Chinese period pieces, and that's where this film loses a star.  The film takes so long building up that the feast for the eyes that is the palace almost takes it over.  Besides the lavish sets and extravagant costumes, there isn't much to do but wait for something to happen.  The actors are forced to remain perfectly neutral and formal as their characters command and, while Gong Li can speak volumes with just her eyes, it's not something most folks are going to want to watch for an hour and a half before the ninja attack.  Oh yes, there are ninjas. It's no secret that Zhang Yimou has an eye for exceptional action shots and he upholds this mantle in several scenes as well as a large-scale battle that sees the beautiful palace's surrounding field of golden flowers trampled and replaced with a pile of corpses.  There are some things I'd love to give away in order to illustrate the brilliance of the character development, but I'm afraid it would spoil the ending.  If you look at film as a true art form, are in the mood for a subtle-yet-epic Shakepearian tale, or enjoy the films of Akira Kurosawa, your prayers have been answered;  buy this film.  But if you just saw the commercial on tv and thought everybody'd be kung-fu fighting then give ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" a pass and have a look at ""Hero"" instead; a slightly superior film to this one that manages to give you all the action, drama, romance, and visual poetry one can fit into one film.",1175299200,9,3145,4.641441441441441
2740710,4,B000MRA592,"Yimou Zhang once again produces a work that retains his position as one of the master builders of contemporary cinema. His ability to capture an intricate story historically based in a setting of splendor is up there with the great filmmakers.  CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER is no exception.

The time of the story is the Tang Dynasty, one of the more corrupt and cruel periods in Chinese history.  Emperor Ping (Chow Yun Fat) has married a princess from the neighboring province, becoming Empress Phoenix (Gong Li) and in addition to becoming stepmother to the Emperor's firs-born son (Ye Liu), she bears him two additional sons (Jay Chou and Junjie Qin). Attending the palace is a doctor (Dahong Nim) and his wife (Jin Chen) who figure significantly in the family's destiny.  Each of these dysfunctional family members has secrets that could destroy an empire. The Empress is clearly the titular head of the kingdom and her wily manipulations and incestuous relationships are controlled only by her doses of a medicine that is supposed to make her insane.  The boils on the body of the ruling family fester until great wars break out and the royal family is revealed to be the strangely bizarre group they are.

The story works (though admittedly it is often difficult to follow) because of a brilliant cast and a pacing from the director that almost matches the glory of the visual production that seems to keep growing on the screen, like a huge garden bearing more color and moods as the story progresses. Yimou Zhang is a visual artist and choreographer but he is also a man with the gift of finding the cores of his characters beneath all the glorious trappings of this films.

In CURSE, the story centers around the royal family, and here we find an attempt at Shakespearean drama.

The royal family is a mess. The Emperor is poisoning his Consort, the Empress, and she is sleeping with the Crown Prince, the Emperor's son from his first wife - a son who calls the Empress Mother (at least he did in the English translation; I don't know how that would work itself out in Chinese). The Crown Prince, in turn, is sleeping with the daughter of the Imperial Physician, who himself is married to a woman with a mysterious background.

It sounds like a great place to start, and perhaps it is, but with all of that suspiciously European Medieval-like court intrigue to be played out, very little happens in the first fifty-five minutes. We see gorgeous costumes, and the inside of a beautiful palace so stunningly colorful that it might give an epileptic a seizure; if the sun were to find its way in just so, it would be the mother of all kaleidoscopes and disco balls. We are inside of said palace for the majority of the film, which may be a problem in itself. Zhang does wonders with open land and panoramic scenes. He did grace us with some in this film, and they were magnificent. Scenes involving would-be assassins using grappling hooks and curved blades were poetically brilliant.

But the story, which should start out as a bud and bloom full, chooses instead to shy away from the light. There is resolution, and the threads do play themselves out, but they don't do so in a way that garners intrigue or interest.

Others have sung this film's praises, and one must wonder if they are still basking in the afterglow of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hero/dp/B00030590I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hero</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-of-Flying-Daggers/dp/B000EZ7ZYK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House of Flying Daggers</a>. If so, it's understandable. Those were extraordinary films.

This serves to prove the axiom that insists beauty is only skin deep. It is true with films as it is with people. There needs to be something below the surface.

As this is a review of the DVD, I need to comment on the subtitles and languages. Being hearing impaired, I find this to be important and often overlooked. The DVD offered English as a language, so I selected that - I can hear well enough - and I selected English subtitles - I can't hear *that* well to get by without them. I could, however, hear well enough to know that the spoken word varied greatly from the ""subtitled word"". It was worthy of a few laughs.

At least they offered English as a language. Not all foreign films, even wildly successful ones, do. CURSE get points for that.

2740742,5,B000MRA592,"I note that an earlier reviewer saw the 'making-of' featurette. and it's

a good intro into peeling away the layers of this quasi-Shakespearean melodrama. There's something dramatists like, the theme of the darkness beneath the beauty.

Slow starting, Director Zhang moves faster and faster telling the tale of unfolding faces (in an asian sense) and the complexities of relationships,

veering every so-often in to soap-operatics. Yet with extravagant graphics/ production qualities and a nice pattern of on-and-off action with teary or sneer-y  confrontations and trysts, even the maybe too-dramatic elements work well.

One measure might be that in re-seeing, the layers get more intense and understandable, adding weight to the conflicts; a plus for buyers versus renters.

Now, if only a quality version of RAISE THE RED LANTERN would be released, Zhang Yimou's stature as a world-class director would be rightly, finally, established. With his successes this millennium, it might just happen for the man...",1175126400,40,1012,5.496774193548387
2740743,5,B000MRA592,"The Tang dynasty was the Golden Age period in China, and yet for all the glory there was a lot of internal turmoil. Zhang Yimou is renowned for sumptuous dramas like Raise the Red Lantern, and epics such as Hero and House of Flying Daggers. In Curse of the Golden Flower, we are given an intimate look at the dysfunctional Imperial Family of China, headed by the Emperor [played with consummate skill by Chow Yun Fatt], the Empress Phoenix [Gong Li, as lustrous as always], and his three sons, the Crown Prince [who was borne by an earlier wife], Prince Jai [whose loyalty to his mother is without equal], and young Prince Cheng. Dark secrets and evil machinations dominate throughout the film, and we see the gradual destruction of the Imperial Family due to lies, internal strife and treachery from within the ranks. The acting is good, especially Gong Li's, as she speaks eloquently with a glance or gesture, making her meaning plain without dialogue. The costumes are amazing, simply gorgeous and well-deserving of the Oscar nomination. As for the cinematography, it is lush and beautiful, evoking a sense of a bygone era. A cinematic treat indeed!",1174953600,6,1152,4.852791878172589
2740744,4,B000MRA592,"Curse of the Golden Flower is a brutal and beautiful look at the inner court of a Chinese Dynasty. When distrust and ill-intent creep in, the stage is set for a powerful and gripping masterpiece.

Anyone familiar with past works of Zhang Yimou knows they are in for a visual masterpiece. Curse is no exception. The use of color that Yimou is so well known for is apparent throughtout with vibrant and awe inspiring locals, backdrops, and costumes. Truely one of his greatest visual works.

The story is not quite as convoluted and twisting as those of Yimou's past works (Hero, House of Flying Daggers) and lays itself out relatively early. That isn't to say it doesn't have its share of twists. It is more about the personification of what the knowledge of the situation does to the members of the royal family. Why they act as they do. And how they plan to resolve everything, each in their own way. An amazing work of characterization capped off with solid performances from the main cast of characters.

Chow Yun Fat plays the Emperor to perfection. He is cold and calculating, while remaining a sense of majesty and humanity despite some of his actions. The three princes are portrayed wonderfully by some very competent actors. Especially the roles of Prince Jai and Crown Prince Wan. As the movie progresses the roles of the princes begin to become far more than you could ever imagine and family lines are drawn as sides are taken.

But out of all the wonderful astetics and performances, nothing outshines Gong Li. Her portrayal of the Empress is absolutely breathtaking. Gong Li is known more for her dramatic roles than those she has in action movies and I was worried initially, but she really doesn't take part in any of the action and her full abilities as a dramatic actress are on display to be seen. Harnessing various emotions ranging from pain, suffering, loss, heartache, and anger, Gong Li crafts a character that is to be admired and adored by all. This truely is one of her greatest works ever.

Overall, Curse of the Golden Flower is another amazing movie by Zhang Yimou. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is I personally expected more story. While the story that is here is wonderful and really draws you in, I think maybe I may just be jaded by Yimou's other masterpieces of the last few years. Still, it should be no reason to prevent anyone from seeing this movie. I can't recommend it enough.",1174953600,5,2429,4.6395348837209305
2740745,2,B000MRA592,"Could've been a lot lot better, not enough action scenes to keep you interested. They tried to make it too dramatic and it fails in that department. Sorry...Either Hero or HOFD are way better than this.",1174867200,8,202,4.638888888888889
2740746,4,B000MRA592,"The success of foreign martial arts films has given rise to beautifully executed movies such as ""Hero"" and ""House of Flying Daggers"". Now, ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" adds it's weight to the ranks, and upholds this particular style of film perfectly.

Due to the style of the film, and the general language barrier (as a language, Chinese and Japanese can sometimes be difficult to translate into English), the plot can get a little confusing at times, but it eventually irons itself out later on. The main gist of the plot is that the Empress of China has discovered that her husband, the Emperor, has been slowly poisoning her with a type of fungi that will cause her to lose all mental capacity if it is taken in small doses over a period of a few months. Upon learning this, she decides to stage a coupe with her most trusted son in an attempt to overthrow the Emperor. There are several side plots, but they mostly serve to create character depth.

As expected, this film is breathtakingly beautiful, from it's set and costumes, to the artistic cinematography. It was nominated at the 2007 Academy Awards for costume design, and it was well deserving of the nomination. Because it is a foreign film, it is of course subtitled, but the viewer also has an option to change the subtitles to English dubbing instead. However, I always prefer to use the subtitles because I feel that there is something lost when altering the voice inflection with someone speaking English who is *not* the original actor. There isn't much dialogue to begin with. The film makes liberal use of non-verbal looks, gestures, and body language to get it's point across, which lends itself to the strength of the actors to be able to create this intricate story with limited dialogue.

The vibrant color pallete is striking, and is well worth viewing the movie, even if you end up not liking it. I would recommend this film to any who enjoy foreign films.",1174608000,5,1934,4.699115044247788
2740747,1,B000MRA592,"""Gold and jade on the outside, rot and decay on the inside"". This is the old Chinese proverb director Zhang Yimou quoted when attempting to describe the overall theme of this movie...and well, I could not agree with him more! While Curse of the Golden Flower does look beautiful and lavish on the outside with its flashy exterior, at its core it is almost devoid of just about everything else.

Curse of the Golden Flower centers around an imperial family that eventually falls apart. As of this writing, this is the most expensive movie ever made in China and it definitely shows. Everything from the re-imagination of the Forbidden City to the interior of the royal palace illustrates the amount of care and precarious work emphasized on detail. Some of it is not all great, especially those bizarre glowing pillars. The costumes themselves looked remarkably funny, especially since the actors were always struggling to keep such weight on them while appearing awkwardly serious in their performances.

The movie delves into the personalities of the characters and each of their own distinct motives. However, it still does little or nothing to add or enrich the story, which frequently borders on being predictable on more than one occasion while at times not even driving any kind of story at all. It uses virtually every single dysfunctional royal family clich in the book. There is no real sense of urgency as to what's happening because nothing is truly developed. By the time the so-called ""hidden family secrets"" are finally revealed, it all isn't as cracked up as it was supposed to be. And somehow were expected to be shocked or surprised?

As for the starring roles, Chow Yun Fat does nothing convincing as a senile emperor except to stroke his beard while dishing out proverbs. Gong Li's version of drama is to cry and tremble in front of the camera while being careful with her breasts falling out. Jay Chou and Liu Ye as the emperor's sons don't do anything noteworthy. The dialogue in this movie is particularly boring if you know Mandarin, and everything is just overacted and taken too seriously than what it should be. Curse of the Golden Flower also contains some of the most laughable scenes in Chinese cinema history, a few of which made purely for shock factor. This is about a dysfunctional family, yet why should we care?

This movie drew inspiration from Thunderstorm, written by Cao Yu. Unfortunately, Zhang Yimou decided to mutilate and transform this wonderful classic story into a bloated big-budget carnival extravaganza, complete with a bombardment of colors, showy breasts, and also found the time to include some martial arts and epic army CGI action while he was at it. He even hired an all-star cast, although their roles did not require any of them to do much with talent except to utilize their celebrity status in order to sell the film. And all this for what? For the sake of just generating box office numbers?

It seems as though Zhang Yimou felt like he couldn't win an Academy Award when he reverted back to his old style with Riding Alone For Thousands of Miles, so he comes back to doing Hollywood stuff like this. If Chen Kaige's The Promise was the worst original Chinese movie ever made, then Curse of the Golden Flower has got to be the worst Chinese adaptation ever made. As a lesson to be learned, Zhang should have paid close attention to those very words that inspired him to make this film in the first place: ""Gold and jade on the outside, rot and decay on the inside"". It ended up describing this movie all too perfectly.",1174435200,15,3578,4.773828756058158
2740748,2,B000MRA592,"Although a few of the other review allude to the weak plot, I am surprised no one has noticed that the plot of this film has more in common with an episode of ""Dynasty"" with Chow Yun Fat in the ""Blark Carrington"" role and Gong Li as ""Alexis Colby"" - and it seems that every hack-kneed soap opera plot devise is used - the upstairs/downstair romance, the wide who resents her over baring husband and has an affair with her much sexier step-son, the first wife thought to be dead who shows as the star witness of the nurder trial (oops!, that last one was from ""Dynasty"").  The film is beautiful to look at but I became very ""aware"" of how much CGI effects were used to create the thousands of soliders.

2740750,2,B000MRA592,"It seems as if Zhang Yimou has exchanged his former style and art for flashy, hollywood type battles and drama.  Raise the Red Lantern was nothing less than a marvelous film that is artistic yet appeals to the average viewer.  For this movie, it seems as if he finished watching the Siege at Helm's Deep in LOTR and decided he wanted to make one that is in Chinese.  Poorly, anyway.

The plot isn't incomprehensible but the usage of the word plot is a stretch.  It seems as if all the cast members, however poorly cast, are just plotting for plotting sake.  You don't feel for any of the characters, because they're never developed beyond the fact that everyone is unhappy and suffering.  It's a cynical movie.  All the women are running around wearing masking tape on their breasts so they get pushed up to shoulder level.  It was distracting and a bit disturbing.  What better way to promote a mediocre movie than exposed cleavage right?

Also, it seems as if everyone is living in a giant fun house or something.  Can we say Batman and Robin?  Bright colors like a flashy red and does not make for an epic.  The tone of the movie is so dark and cynical yet the colors are so bright....  The direction is eye rollingly tedious.  Throughout the entire movie, he Zhang has to do sweeping camera pans and slow motion shots of battles that's probably been done in Hollywood 6 years ago and better as well.  Hair becoming disarrayed in slow motion, characters over dramatically taking their robes off before a fight...!  Please stop trying to make a Hollywood movie, Zhang!

Jay Chow was very poorly cast.  Chow Yun Fat's mandarin is the epitome of HONG KONG style mandarin.  Gong Li's talents are just wasted portratying a one dimensional character.  Everything is just overly dramatic to the point of nausea.  Everyone is backstabbing each other for no real apparent reason, that's basically the 'plot'.  This might be all right if they weren't a bunch of wooden one dimensional characters.

If you want to watch a good Zhang Yimou movie and a great one in general, watch Raise the Red Lantern.  Now that is truly epic and leaves a very lasting impression.  Not to mention it has a great soundtrack.",1172707200,10,2198,4.641558441558441
2740751,4,B000MRA592,"This is a beautiful film.  The costumes and cinematography are clearly Oscar quality and the best I have seen in a very long time.  The sub-titles can be a little tiresome because they distract from the visual beauty of the film, but a great deal of the action is visual and implied through body language.  The plot is very complicated and includes incest, betrayal, secrets, and the drive for power. There are enough twists and turns to keep your interest and even a few surprises.  There are some martial arts scenes which I felt were a little overdone but there weren't enough to spoil the film.  The final scenes in the Forbidden City are truly spectacular and show great cinematography.

The movie is essentially a Greek Tragedy with the outcome one expects from a Greek  Tragedy.  One is reminded of Agamemnon, Clytemnestra, and Orestes as the royal family self-destructs over jealousy, power, and revenge.  In the end the King is left with nothing but his power -- a hollow victory.

The costumes are truly spectacular, the screen play well done, the cinematography outstanding, and the acting of the highest quality.  I gave the film four stars because I felt much of the martial arts could have been eliminated and didn't add a great deal to the film.
