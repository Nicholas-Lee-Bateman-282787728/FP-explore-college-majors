Then I decided to get the DVD to listen to commentaries and such, and I found out what a crappy VHS this was.

First, it's recorded in SLP mode.  If you tape shows on TV, you know that SLP is the low-quality mode that lets you fit 8 hours of stuff on a 2 hour tape.  The picture is so fuzzy and the contrast is so bad, I didn't even know some of the more gory stuff was going on in the shadows.  And to top it off, IT'S EDITED!  Yes, it says it contains the original 96 minutes, and it flat out lies.  Granted it's trimmed in very small pieces here and there, but who the !@#$ are they to decide that we don't need to see an extra 10 seconds of the girl running down the road, or that extra shot of the farm house.  Romero is a master for a reason, so don't screw with it, especially if the edits are meaningless.

I believe Romero lost the rights to this movie somehow, so the market is flooded with crappy rip-offs for which Romero doesn't receive a dime.  If you're interested, get the new collectors edition DVD.  The Man gets his due payment, and you will see how beautiful the movie looks and how well it was shot... just the way it was meant to be seen.",1123804800,,1335,4.049618320610687
