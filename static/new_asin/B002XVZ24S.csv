5669777,5,B002XVZ24S,"I'm so glad this is now available with English subtitles, because it's so difficult to follow dubbed into Portuguese.

And having such a high interest of the French Revolution, this little chapter of the Royal's planned escape and the fictional coach ride sub-plot is pretty delicious....",1289260800,18,308,4.685185185185185

8573194,3,B002XVZ24S,"The problem with this movie is not the movie itself but the difficulty of reading and keeping up with the subtitles. The white subtitles sometimes blend into the picture and because this is a very dialogue heavy script it becomes even more difficult. If you are fluent in French, no problem. That being said the cinematography, the costumes, the setting are really quite special.",1485043200,3,379,4.9375
