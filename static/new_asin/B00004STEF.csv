1348715,5,B00004STEF,"I know a lot of ""wrestling purists"" and ""hardcore fans"" like to chip away at The Rock for his ""limited wrestling ability"" or because that's what they're supposed to do when someone becomes a mainstream success. Well, as The Rock says, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THEY THINK!!! This DVD highlights why I became a WWF fan again for the first time since the champion was some hulking, balding guy.  Who cares if The Rock's signature move is a simple albeit ""simply electrifying"" elbow drop? The reason he's ""The People's Champ"" is because he's the coolest, cockiest, funniest, greatest trash-talking athlete to grace us with his presence since Cassius Clay challenged Sonny Liston.",1012435200,,673,5.008928571428571
1348716,4,B00004STEF,this is a great video on the rock.........had all his main macthes though 99-start of 2000....was very well done with all his promos which was funny as....ive got the tape version not the dvd.....im shore it is 50times better on dvd.honestly in my opion i like the rock video know your role  a bit better.probably because i liked him in that cocky atittude. but got nothing against this one...he shows you his shops and where he gets his hair cut...a must get for any rock fans!,996624000,,478,4.558139534883721
1348717,5,B00004STEF,"This facet of media is excellently fascinating!!
Each component of the disc--from the 143 minute journey into the Rock's life in and out of the ring to all the added features like: the excellently humerous promos and interviews are excellently extraordinary as well. Then, there's the slide show--a moving montage of the most electrifying man in sports-entertainment--it's captivating, exhilerating, and just excellently awesome!! And most important of all, The Rock excellently entertains the people on this DVD like only he can!
All you undecided consumers out there who are true fans of The Rock, I excellently reccommend you buy the DVD....if ya excellently smell what the Pure Excellence is cookin'!!!!",981158400,,707,5.4363636363636365

1348719,5,B00004STEF,"The DVD features a few major matches between The Rock and major names from 1999 to January 2000.  You won't find his matches with Steve Austin on here but you will see how the rivalry between him and Triple H starting to gain  some steam.
You get to see a few backstage views of The Rock and how his  fans really idolize him.  Of course, the pie references are interesting as  well.  This DVD is jam packed full of The Rock and if you are a Rock fan,  this DVD will be an awesome purchase because not only do you get 143  minutes of the electrifying wrestler, you get these special features such  as his memorable verbal assaults including the pie references.  Not sure if  they showed those on television before.
The interviews from the  announcers to the wrestlers help the audience gain some insight on the  wrestler and if you buy the VHS, you will be missing out on these awesome  special features.  The sound and video is really good and the special  features included are pretty fun to watch.  A definite DVD must-see for WWF  and The Rock fans.",961891200,23,1052,4.4188481675392675

1348723,5,B00004STEF,"The first thing that should be known about this particular DVD is that it is not about The Rock's wrestling, nor does it show any of his matches in its entirety.  Instead, the 143 minutes of footage is devoted solely to the entertainment aspect of The Rock's character.

From The Rock's interviews, to his catchphrases and feuds with characters like The Undertaker, Triple H, Al Snow, Mankind, and The Big Show, and some clips of him outside of wrestling, such as throwing the opening pitch at a Chicago Cub's game, signing copies of his book ""The Rock Says..."", or getting a haircut.

This DVD falls somewhere among the likes of Mick Foley's ""Hard Knocks and Cheap Pops"" DVD, minus the bonus matches.  It's filled with some of the most memorable Rock moments during 1999 and parts of early 2000, most having to do with his interviews, catchphrases, and trash talking his opponents.  It's not wrestling, but it's pure entertainment, and just like Mick Foley's DVD, it's genuinely hilarious.",1183766400,7,990,4.869047619047619
1348724,5,B00004STEF,"This DVD covers the original VHS movie, digitally remastered for DVD. Besides this, the DVD is packed with lots of extra's.

It contains about 9 in ring promo's and 8 backstage promo's. These promo's are very funny to see, it includes promo's of TheRock making fun of the Big Show's chokeslam, Kane's 'voice box', The Undertaker's tattoo's, how Triple H is 'the game', The Rock and Sock connection and much more.

If you like the The Rock as a face in the late 1999, then you should really be getting this dvd.",1125964800,,510,4.532608695652174

THE PEOPLES CHAMP

The Rock is and has always been one of the most entertaining people to ever come out of wrestling. So the other day I decided to go back and revisit this DVD. Dont know why I decided that I needed to do that but I did. So when I was going through the collection my finger landed on this one, so be it. This is one of those little sets that the WWF was putting out at the time. It is hosted by The Rock himself and follows his career from late 1999 to early 2000 when he won the Royal Rumble.

It covers his feuds with Big Show, Billy Gunn [my favorite feud on here], Triple H, and The Undertaker and all the things that happened with there all in. of course you get all the promos and interviews that made Rock famous. Of course those are also a part of the special features. This is a cool DVD that also focuses on the Rock outside of the ring. I would recommend this to a true collector.",1401926400,,917,4.005464480874317
7922109,3,B00004STEF,"I have been a wrestling fan since 1996 and have watched all kinds of wrestling. I have a wrestling DVD/VHS collection spanning over 50 all together. This is the most complete and accurate review of this DVD you will find. I hope you find this review helpful; remember to vote helpful or not helpful. (Note-Each DVD I review has a ""Match of the DVD"" award somewhere in it.)

The Rock- The People's Champ
Much like many superstar DVDs of this time, you get a feature that goes over a segment of The Rock's career. This DVD however is different than something like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-Hell-Yeah-Stone-Cold-s-Saga-Continues/dp/B00001MXWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE - Hell Yeah: Stone Cold's Saga Continues</a>&nbsp;in that it focuses more on The Rock outside of the ring instead of his in-ring feuds and matches. This is a nice change from the other DVDs, but if you aren't into what The Rock is doing on his days off than you're out of luck.

This DVD starts around&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-King-Of-The-Ring-1999/dp/6305255245/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE King Of The Ring 1999</a>&nbsp;and ends at The Rock's Royal Rumble win at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-Royal-Rumble-2000/dp/B00004VVNN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE Royal Rumble 2000</a>. In between that you will see The Rock hanging out in Miami: buying clothes, getting his haircut, and talking trash. This is all fairly interesting and you'll enjoying watching it. Other then The Rock hanging out, you will see clips from his feuds with: Triple H, Billy Gunn, Undertaker, and Big Show. You will also get a look at his teaming with Mankind.

The extras consist of 9 Rock segments and 8 Rock interviews. There is a slide show, but it's one of the most useless things they could've added. There are no extra matches. The segments and interviews are really funny though and worth checking out. They aren't enough to pull this DVD above three stars though.",1214438400,2,2077,5.870860927152318
7922110,4,B00004STEF,"I must have received the wrong dvd. Although, The People's Champ was a good dvd chronicling The Rock, it did not feature Vivica A. Fox or any other actors and the dvd only lasted 90 minutes and not 143 minutes. To those that are unaware, this a wrestling dvd and not a movie. Why someone would portray this as a movie of some sort, I wonder. It's a great dvd featuring,""The Rock,The People's Champ""! Period.",1210032000,,407,4.44
7922111,5,B00004STEF,"A lot of members are giving this negative reviews and claiming that The Rock is a 'sell out' simply because he doesn't wrestle anymore. He accomplished everything that he possibly could in wrestling. He made millions of dollars for that company. He jobbed to mid carders with no problem. The Rock was the best entertainer in the history of wrestling. He is 'too good' for the likes of the WWE right now. The WWE is basically,irrelevant and is nowhere near as good as it once was,guys. He got out just in time.

God forbid the man wants to do something else with his life. With that said, the DVD is a 'must' for any fans of The Rock and of wrestling; when wrestling was actually good.",1202947200,2,684,4.428571428571429
7922112,4,B00004STEF,The Rock was always great on the microphone. His interviews and promos were some of the best any WWE superstar have ever done. This dvd is a recap of what he said on the mic and a some key matches from the year. Its a good dvd but goes by way to fast. The bonus interviews and promos are awesome but they are really short only two last more then three minutes. There are no bonus matches and that kind of hurts the dvd. Still a very good buy for a Rock fan or just want to remember the good ol days of wrestling.,1196467200,,512,3.9326923076923075
