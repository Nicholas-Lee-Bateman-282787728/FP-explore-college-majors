2717277,1,B000LXHGRG,"I was very disappointed with this DVD.  Not only is it cheaply made (there are no extras, you can't turn the subtitles on or off, just one language track etc.), but the story itself makes NO sense at all!  Also, the subtitles themselves seemed horribly mis-timed;  sometimes a character would say something and no subtitle would even show up!  A very big letdown.
If you are interested in anime of a yaoi nature, try picking up FAKE.  The DVD is great and the story leaves you begging for more!  Just save your money and don't bother with this one; I wish I hadn't.",1016323200,2,565,4.436893203883495
2717278,2,B000LXHGRG,"I heard about Kizuna Parts 1 and 2 back when they were only available on VHS, but didn't buy them because they were very expensive, and each was only 30 minutes long. When the two films were released on one DVD, I purchased it, but was very disappointed, mostly in the quality of the DVD. The story is a gay love triangle, but is very choppy and hard to follow. It seems as if sections of the film were put together while other scenes that would have helped the films make sense were deleted.  While the novelty of owning a piece of gay anime might be enough of a reason to buy it, be warned, the quality was very poor, especially the audio. Even with my speakers turned up to the max, I could still barely hear the dialogue. Luckily, since the film is in the original Japanese, there are English subtitles, but I would still have preferred to hear the words. Secondly, as a DVD, there isn't much value. No extras at all, just the two halves of the story. Not even a booklet inside the case. So judging it by today's DVD's, which usually include different language choices, alternate endings, trailers, interviews, etc., with the Kizuna DVD, you don't get much for the money.",998611200,7,1175,4.439814814814815
2717279,4,B000LXHGRG,"Kizuna is the story of an estranged son of a yakuza boss and his lover who has been injured in an attempted hit on the son.  The yakuza bosses other son (Kai) falles in love with his brother's lover and in the seccond OAV runs away to Tokyo to live with his brother (Enjoji) and his lover (Ranmaru).  This sets up the nicely angsty attraction between kai and the seccond in command of the yakuza family (Masa)

there have been a lot of complaints about these OAV (original animation video) because it seems to have the boys just jumping into bed without any plot; and for the most part that's true.  The OAV's are condensed horribly from the manga.  But the condensing dosen't take away from the quaity of the art, and how pretty the boys are.

If you're a rabid yaoi fan like I am this is definitly a DVD that you will enjoy.  If you're not sure that you want to watch something that's got two pretty boys boinking like bunnies this is definitly not the OAV for you.",991180800,9,967,4.30939226519337
8165089,4,B000LXHGRG,"If you like girls who don't have tattoos, piercings, 'enhanced' body parts, or extreme shaving, then this is the DVD set for you.

What you get is two discs, each with ten ladies, with no extras (well, the slide show is pointless so it doesn't count). The ladies all take their clothes off and writhe round on a bed, couch, office chair etc for about 11 minutes per lady. There is no sound but a soundtrack of jazzy, swingy music is overlaid. Sometimes the music suits the action, sometimes it's hilariously inappropriate.

The girls all go 'all-the-way' but there isn't any penetration so it could be considered a bit tame for some. There is only one girl per set and they all act solo. A couple have dodgy wigs on, supposedly to hide their identities.

The picture quality is Super-8 scratchy and slightly dodgy focus at times with faded colour but I think it's about the best you're going to get.

For a historical record it's very nice to have and for a bunch of attractive 'girl-next-door' types from the 70s, you can't do better.",1265587200,3,1035,4.578378378378378

Nevertheless films had started routinely exhibiting much more explicit sex scenes worldwide since this doco was created ages ago, an educative value of doco shooting is timeless as Asian rituals being depicted.

8165095,3,B000LXHGRG,"Class Reunion Again is one of the hentai movie that the sex scene is always on the end. It's about the life of x-members of the tennis team at a Junior High School. In the beginning the movie is funny but in the middle is dramatic. The dubbing is good except in the beginning which you cannot hear the words they say. The animation is really cool and the sex scene is a little bit too short. If you want a movie with humor, drama, and sex scene then this is good for you.",1107561600,,471,4.0212765957446805

8165097,1,B000LXHGRG,"Thank you Amazon for being a place where everyone can shop.  Unlike the previous reviewer, I wholly support Amazon's decision not to show potentially offensive material on its site.  Should amazon ever choose to do so, I hope they will offer user options that will allow us to see or not see this material.  On the complete other hand, it was really amusing to see what kind of viewer thinks Hentai anime is the ""good stuff"" and that not showing offensive pictures is in some way prudish.  Based on grammer, perhaps the writer speaks English as a second language.  Perhaps nihon-go slang would be better, in which case I'll just add: ""Get a rifu nahdo!""",1071446400,2,653,4.643478260869565
