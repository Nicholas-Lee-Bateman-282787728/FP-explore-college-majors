3560223,4,B001F12IT4,"I was prepared to not like this workout.  Claims like ""10 days to a better body"" just annoy me because who can guarantee something like that.  Also, I'm not thrilled with circuit workouts.  However, I heard good things about this workout and was curious.

I was really engaged by the instructor, Cindy Whitemarsh, and found her very motivating.  She alternates strength segments with 1-minute cardio bursts.  She always shows a lower-impact or easier version first and then takes it up a notch.  She encourages you to work out at your own level, but to do the maximum you can.

At the end, I felt pleasantly worked out.  It's a pretty good workout.",1230768000,3,648,4.714285714285714
3560224,5,B001F12IT4,"Wow!  My muscles definitely get a workout with this DVD.  I really like the two 30-minute routines and the fact that I can alternate the two and get a full, fun, CHALLENGING workout every day of the week.  I also like Cindy Whitmarsh, the instructor.  I find her very informative and motivating, and with a workout that asks so much of you, motivation is a crucial factor!  I like the fact that it's a challenging workout--that ensures I won't get bored and gives me something to strive for--completing the entire routine without substituting any of the exercises.  I chose not to do the diet portion of the program, but I feel like I've gotten great results from just the workouts--a better body, indeed!  I highly recommend this DVD.",1230163200,2,735,4.6953125
3560225,4,B001F12IT4,"Cindy Whitmarsh leads this scorcher of a workout that makes use of the effective method of interval training. It includes two workouts: Upper Body Cardio Interval workout and Lower Body Cardio Interval Workout. The two workouts both target your abs briefly as well.  The 2 workouts consist of alternating ONE-minute intervals of each cardio and weight lifting move. For each cardio move there is a base move that is low impact and you can take it up a notch with the high impact option. Also, for every strength move there are generally 8 reps of each/ per side with pulses for the upper body and 16 reps/move for lower body(one set with pulses).  Details like this make this workout accessible for all fitness levels.  Advanced exercisers may want to add more reps or use heavier weights, because this might not be enough for you.  Cindy Whitmarsh is a motivating instructor and provides an effective workout while giving excellent pointers on form. She is the only person in the workout, so there is no one showing modifications throughout.  The background music is instrumental and not too bad for a workout video. Overall, this a very good workout with enough unique moves to make it a fresh and fun addition to your workout DVD library. While the focus is ""changing your body in 10 days"" you can certainly use this for a longer period of time and make it a regular in your rotation.

Equipment Needed: You need two sets of weights:light and heavy and a floor mat if desired for the floorwork.

Here is an approximate breakdown of the workouts:

> Upper Body
You start with a quick warm-up with step touches, elbow strikes and plie squats, torso twists, jab punches and hops and then proceed to  and the cardio moves are a minute each.):
- Two Arm Row with Pulses (to work your back)
- Heel Digs (add a hop for higher impact version)
- Balancing Rear Delt Raise (works back of your shoulders while on 1 leg)
-Jump Rope-simulated (low impact version is to just lift your heels)
- Triceps Kickback
- Alternating Lunge with a Punch
- Windshield Wiper (works rotator cuff and shoulders)
- Reverse Lung Tap Backs (high impact is Plyo Lunges)
- Balancing Bicep-Shoulder Press (bicep curl and shoulder press on 1 leg)
- Side Toe Tap (higher impact is jumping jack)
- Balancing Bicep-Shoulder Tap-(she does the reps on the other side)
- Plie with a Reach (""quick feet"" and a hop for high impact)
- Triceps Overhead Extension
- Twist Squat (like a ski hop with ski jump of high impact option)
- Bicep Curl with External Rotation (works your shoulders, too)
- Speed Skate (add a hop for high impact option)
- Shoulder Front & Side Rise
- Knee Raise
- Push-Ups
- Knee Raise (work the other side with the cardio move)
- Alternating One Arm Row (from a push-up position)
- Pulse Squat (make it a jump squat for high impact)
- Alternating Cross Punch (you need a mat for this ab-scorcher)
- Planks (you alternate moving your leg out to the side to up the ante)
- Reverse Crunch
- Mountain Climbers (move slower for low impact option)
You finish with a really quick stretch for the upper body.

> Lower Body Workout (only the heavy set of weights is needed):
After a quick workout complete with jumps, mambos and side lunges you move into:
- Basic Squat
- Side Hop (for low impact just don't add the hop)
- Dead Lifts
- March in Place (quick feet to take it up a notch)
- Alternating Reverse Lunges
- Alternating Back Toe Taps (add a hop for more power)
- Plie Squat
- Squat Thrusts (move slower with this gym class favorite for low impact)
- Turned-Out DeadLift (turn your toes to the side to target outer thigh)
- Side Tap (jump out and in for high impact)
- Balancing Single Leg Reach
- Jump Rope (jump on one leg for advanced option)
- Balancing Single Leg Reach (repeat the move on the other leg)
- Jump Rope (again :)! )
- Curtsy Squat (you can add a knee lift for an advanced option)
- Ski Hop
- Curtsy Squat (repeat this move on the other leg)
- Alternating Knee Pull (add a kick for high impact cardio)
- Low Lunge (you do this move in a sprinter's stretch position)
- Bob-and-Weave (boxer's shuffle for high impact)
- Low Lunge (repeated on the other side)
- Bob-and-Weave (repeated on the other side)
- Squat w/ Alternating Cross Punch (this move is to target your abs)
- Squat w/ Toe Tap (high impact adds a side kick)
- Full Body Cruch (grab your mat for this one)
- Mountain Climber (move slow for base move)
This finishes with quick stretch that could stand to be a bit longer.

Also included with the DVD is a 10 Days to a Better Body Meal Plan with a 10 day 1,200 calorie/day diet. Enjoy and hope you get great results.",1229904000,75,4625,4.448642266824085
3560226,5,B001F12IT4,This is a great workout in just 30 minutes. Each segment is hard but lasts only 1 minute. I have many DVD's that I work out to but this is my favorite at the moment. You can't go wrong with this one!,1229126400,3,199,3.761904761904762
3560227,5,B001F12IT4,"I think this is a great workout to get a better body. You switch between one minute intervals of strength training and one minute of intense cardio.  This gives you the benefit of both types of workout.  If Cathe Friedrich is my standard for advanced exercisers, then I would say this workout is best for intermediate exercisers.  Beginners can do it, but you would need to do modifications.  The instructor Cindy Marsh does show modifications at the beginning of cardio intervals, and you could use no or lighter weights for the strength training intervals.  Even though one is specifically for upper and one for lower body, you do exercises using your entire body throughout each workout.  I consider myself an intermediate exerciser.  I used 5-8 pound weights.  I don't feel sore the next day after either workout, but I definitely sweated the entire time!  I felt I had a great workout!  To do some of the upper body exercises it is best to have a set of dumbells with the hexegonal ends rather than round, or you will have to do them on your hands.  I also recommend a mat.  I thought Cindy Marsh did a good job of cueing and the exercises were interesting.",1228867200,27,1162,4.614634146341463
3560228,5,B001F12IT4,"You may remember Cindy Whitmarsh from the 10 Minute Solution Target Tone for beginners.  This is a great dvd for those who have progressed past the beginner stage.  I did the lower body workout on Saturday and the Upper body workout Sunday and am still sore today!  There is no wasted time in this workout and the minute intervals keep you going.  You can do anything for a minute!  I love the variety of moves, too.  It is never boring.  The instructor is great, pleasant and encouraging, not annoying at all.  She keeps you motivate and gives valuable tips on form so as not to hurt yourself.  I love this dvd and its companion ""Boost Your Metabolism.""  You can't go wrong with them!",1228176000,6,685,4.495934959349594
3560229,5,B001F12IT4,"I really really like this one.  I think Cindy is an excellent instructor and she does a great job here.  This dvd includes two workouts and each are good; one is for the upper body and the second is for the lower.  They both are interval (my favourite kind, plus I think they are the most effective) and you can do one workout on day one and the second on day two so you can work out your upper and lower body on alternate days and still be able to give your muscles their day break.  The intervals are only a minute each so they are doable and yet still challenging.  There isn't anything too diferent with this dvd as far as moves are concerned; you have your usual squats, jacks and lunges and planks, but it's refreshing for the shorter intervals and Cindy's clear and good cuing.
Like the other Results Fitness workout, this also comes with a healthy meal plan booklet.  You need your dumbbells and that's about it.  You will feel this the next day because even though the intervals are short, you are still packing a lot in.  I have only done each workout once through, but I really enjoyed it a lot and hope you will as well.",1224720000,7,1132,4.28169014084507
3560230,4,B001F12IT4,"I really like Cindy Whitmarsh, but the his video is a little too intense for my current fitness level. It includes lots of hopping/jumping, which is kinda uncomfortable with extra pounds on my waist! I plan to come back to this one later on. It is fun though otherwise.",1426291200,,269,4.510204081632653
3560231,5,B001F12IT4,Same product that a few friends bought for triple the price...very happy,1424649600,,72,5.083333333333333
3560232,5,B001F12IT4,"This DVD is wonderful. I absolutely love it, but it's more for intermediates. I lost 8-10 lbs. with the incorporation of this DVD into my workouts in 3 months, but I did not do it 10 days straight I would workout 2-3 days give myself 1-2 rest depending on my aches (I suffer a lot of back issues) and get right back to it. When people compliment your efforts, you know something is working right. This DVD will get you feeling like you put in work, I'm usually wet with sweat after & sore in places I didn't know could be sore.",1422144000,2,527,4.176470588235294
3560233,5,B001F12IT4,Cindy Whitmarsh always gets to the point with her workouts and this is no exception. This is a quick and easy calorie burner and strength builder. I alternate this with running and extended stretching. Love it.,1421884800,,210,4.861111111111111
3560234,4,B001F12IT4,"I completed my 10th workout today. Usually I look for excuses to stop doing an exercise program after the first or second day. But after a couple of days, I was enjoying myself and thinking that I could see it through for 10 days. After the second day, I was sore all over in a way that let me know I had worked my muscles well. It took a couple of days for the soreness to go away. There is a lot of jumping around during the cardio segments as well as lots of squats and lunge-type exercises. I started out doing the ramped up moves Cindy does after the low impact version, but I am 61, and it was very hard on my knees, so by the end, I was doing mostly the low impact cardio except for kicks and quick feet. I also started out with 3-lb and 8-lb weights but had to lower my higher weight to 5-lb due to problems with my neck and shoulders. The workouts are each about 35 minutes, including a very short warm-up and cool-down. I really enjoyed Cindy's instruction. She does the whole workout with you and there are no others with her to distract you or her. Her cueing was perfect, and she was great at timing a word of encouragement just about the time I felt like giving up. Each exercise or cardio segment is only 1 minute, and sometimes it didn't even seem that long! I do not have any objective evidence that this works, as I did not take measurements before starting. My measurements after 10 days are similar to measurements I took months ago before starting and stopping some other exercise program. I also did not pay any attention to changing my eating, but I did lose almost 2 pounds. I can fluctuate that much pretty easily, so I cannot necessarily say that the exercise did it, but that was in spite of visits to McDonald's and Subway, snacking during late night movie-watching with my daughter, etc. I think we even ordered Chinese one night and had friends over for the Bronco game where we ate and snacked to beyond full. So I'm not kidding when I say I did not change my diet. What I do believe is that I can feel a flatter stomach and more tone in my upper arms and thighs. Definitely I can see more defiition in my calves. I have a lot of fat on me still, so I do know that realistically I would need to lose some weight before I would actually see changes. The diet booklet has 10 days of menus for weight loss, but whenever I see someone eschewing egg yolks and pushing low fat products, I bail. I do believe that if I had given some attention to eating better I would have lost at least twice the weight and may have actually seen visible results. Another thing that is a problem for me is when a program has a timeframe to it. 10 Days to a Better Body or 28-day Boot Camp or whatever means the program ends after that time period. So I have a hard time thinking, ""Oh, I'll do it for another 10 days and another 10 days after that."" I think this would probably be a really good program for someone who really has only 10 days to get in shape for some event and is willing to eat well along with doing this exercise program AND doesn't have a whole lot to lose. For the sake of my knees, I'm going to find something a bit less jolting, but I may be back someday.",1421280000,3,3186,4.182113821138211

3560239,5,B001F12IT4,"I love this CD!
First off, Cindy does not try to sell you anything. After listening to another company hawk their products for several minutes on every single item purchased, this is a refreshing change.
Having some hip issues and not particularly liking cardio, i was skeptical of this format...but i needed a change and other reviewers convinced me to give it a try. I am so glad i did!
You have the option to choose upper body, lower body, or the whole thing. I cannot even imagine doing the whole thing!! It is recommended to alternate upper and lower  each day for 10 days. Both upper and lower body take 35 minutes to complete including warm up and cool down.
For each exercise, she shows modifications and proper form. Cindy is encouraging without being too perky. After a brief warmup, you alternate a minute of weights with a minute of cardio throughout the workout. The time flew by! And, even with my modifications, I felt i got an AWESOME workout.
Best of all, my body really did change in 10 days as promised! I have been working out for years, but there is now a firmness i did not have before. I am also noticing muscles that i didn't previously seem to have :) Not in a bulky, guyish way, but lean and firm.",1410480000,4,1223,4.435555555555555
3560240,2,B001F12IT4,"it's probably a fine workout if you know what you're getting into. it's based in dance which I did not know. I'm terrible at dance.

3560243,3,B001F12IT4,"I highly recommend that you spend the extra $3 and get the $9 version.  Unfortunately, the DVD I received was defective--no data on the disk or so corrupted it sent my DVD player into a panic.  It's going back and I hope I'm not charged a restocking fee. Very disappointing.

Regarding the workout itself, I've heard great things about it, so I've ordered the $9 version.",1401926400,,371,4.590909090909091
3560244,4,B001F12IT4,"After doing the Barry's Bootcamps that had Cindy Whitmarsh on them, I became a fan of hers and tried this DVD.

Instructor:  Cindy Whitmarsh is fun, supportive and motivating.  Her cuing is great, and she's great on focusing on form.

Workouts: The DVD has two 32-minute workouts.  Each one has one-minute segments of cardio mixed with weight work.  One work out focuses on upper body and the other focuses on lower body so that you can use the DVD every day without hurting yourself and giving your muscles time to recuperate.

Workout Level:  This is a nice intermediate workout.  If you need to tone it down on the high intensity cardio intervals, you can easily do so.

Set: I've seen this set in other DVDs.  It's not dark and depressing, but it's nothing special either. It's better than most.

Music:  This is the one negative.  It's like 70s movie music.

I'm a fan of workouts that mix cardio and weights.  If this is your style, too, or if you're curious about it, give this DVD a try.  I did this on a day when I didn't want to go to the gym and do a treadmill run combined with a weight workout.  It was a nice substitute.",1401753600,2,1134,4.396135265700483

3560246,5,B001F12IT4,"Love Love Love this dvd!  I zapped the fat right off of me in time for my trip.  I did this video everyday for 7 days and saw results.  I could fit in my jeans after only 7 days!  There is a 30 minute upper body and 30 minute lower body workout.  Alternate every other day and you will see results.  I love Cindy Whitmarsh because she is fun and motivating.  This is interval training at its best. Why? Because you remain injury free even though you do these workouts everyday.  There are high impact moves, but you can modify them.  Cindy gives modifications for all of the high impact moves.  The cardio and strength are for a minute each and there is variety so you won't get bored.  You will feel it, but if it is not hard enough up your weights to heavy and it will take the workouts to a new level.  I like this better than Jillian Michaels 30 days shred because there are two workouts focusing on different parts of the body so you are not doing to same moves everyday.  Plus Cindy is more fun.  With 30 day shred my knees started bothering me because of the same moves over and over in 30 days. I used 5,8 and 10 pound weights.  I've had this dvd for years and I use it every time I need to get in shape fast.  She works abs in both workouts so no need to work your abs separate. I do not have any negative comments about this dvd.  The diet plan is simple-stuff you have at home.  I like it.  This dvd is a most have in your collection!

You get a great workout and it's only just over 30 minutes so you can easily fit it in. Cindy is awesome and encourages you and gives you tips throughout the video. I've seen very good results with this video and if you stick with it they just keep getting better. I would recommend this video to anyone.,1397174400,2,478,4.311111111111111

I usually do the full workout and the hour just flies by. I also like that you can split up the 2 workouts if you choose. Some of the moves in this I had never seen before,which I love,as bicep curls and tricep kickbacks get old when those moves are in so many of my dvds.

Personally, I think the lower body workout is the more difficult work out of the two- I certainly felt it for a couple of days the first time I did it.  I like that these are 30 minute workouts, not 20 minute workouts.  I bought it simply because it has Cindy Whitmarsh in it.

I can't tell about results because I am still going to my gym. I got for next month when my gym membership will expire and I will be working out at home.

This DVD is perfect if you only have 1/2 an hour a day to work out, and it's well balanced in terms of working the upper body, lower body and abs (though it could probably add some more ab work, if anything). It's not ""hard"" to do but will certainly have you sweating and challenged, as long as you use heavy enough weights, and I've already noticed big changes in my body and confidence level. NOTE: the included meal plan will *not* be very helpful if you are a vegetarian, and will be essentially useless if you're a vegan..",1367193600,4,686,4.4523809523809526
3560262,3,B001F12IT4,"I am an intermediate exerciser and have a lot of Jillian Michaels in my library.

In general, I appreciate workouts that have intense cardio built into weight training. I think it is very effective. But I didn't find this video to have very intense cardio segments... especially in the upper body workout, and I would have preferred two minutes of cardio. Maybe I feel that way because the low intensity/easy version is demonstrated first, for an 8 count, and maybe after I get to know the exercises I will know which higher impact version comes next so I can start with that. I did like the lower body workout, and she has some interesting moves that I haven't seen before.

I thought Cindy was encouraging and she does do a lot of instructing as far as form and proper ways to do the exercise. Much better than Jillian in that department. I also found her cueing very good, although I did hate her warm ups because they were like an aerobics class with complicated choreography and switching between exercises.

One thing I'd like to see in exercise workouts in general (and this one is no exception) is that when they are doing their encouraging-talk routine, I'd like to seem them lay off the ""better body"" imagery as a motivational tactic. I'm much more motivated by messages about feeling better, being healthy, being fit, being strong, living longer, being able to do things I want to do (function), etc. rather than looking great in a dress or skinny jeans. These messages encourage self objectification, not health. I am not sure if this is unique to videos geared at women, or if it's common to all, and maybe I shouldn't be griping about it because that's probably just what sells more videos.

I will add the lower body workout to my routine, but it won't become part of my core workouts - which consist of Jillian Michaels No More Trouble Zones and Banish Fat Boost Metabolism, and Jackie Warner, both of which are much more intense and more interesting. This one is suitable for novice exercisers.",1366502400,7,2011,4.672316384180791
3560263,4,B001F12IT4,"I purchased this and starting this DVD in January of this year. There are two 33 minute workout segments on this DVD. You are alternate 1 minute of cardio and 1 minute of strength. The idea is to alternate the 2 workouts each day for 10 days. I first thought was ""You have got to be kidding!"" The workout left me dead. It can get tiresome as you don't have a chance to get your breath. I couldn't finish the whole segment at first. I gradually worked my way up so I can complete a whole segment without stopping and I don't have to crawl my way to the shower anymore. I alternate this DVD with the Exercise TV's Ultimate Body Slim Down Fast. I worked up to 10lb weights. I track my calories in Fitness Pal. I have lost 16 pounds! I have another 19 to go.

It has two 35min segments: one is for your upper body and the other one is for your lower body. I was a bit skeptical at first but I have to say that both segments made me sweat a lot :) It is a repetition of 1min cardio and 1min sculpting exercises. The instructor has great energy and looks friendly. She gives good instructions too and the moves are easy to follow and are quite challenging for active persons.

The only thing that I didn't like in it is her comments on body shapes and how to obtain the best body shape, you have to get rid of your pear shape figure. I love my pear shape figure, I just want to tone it :) But apart from that, good workout !",1363651200,2,922,3.983783783783784

Cindy is excellent at cueing, and I love that. The only thing I dislike about the workout is the very rushed cool down. My heart rate is still really high from the last cardio move, and then I get rushed through a quick 2 minute cool down. I just do my own cool down.

The upper body segment really didn't start getting tough until the end of the workout(it started to get very tough actually) and that's why I gave it 3 stars. The lower body workout bored me after the first 10-15mtes. Unlike the upper body, it is very easy to fatigue the legs. I thought after the first few exercises, my legs would be tired but they weren't; and its not because I am super advanced either. It was like she wanted to give a hard workout, but it lacked intensity; which was disappointing becuase cindy whitmarsh is usually very challenging.",1350172800,2,577,4.611650485436893
3560276,5,B001F12IT4,"I absolutely love interval workouts. They get so much done in such a short period of time. This cardio interval DVD, broken out into lower and upper, is one of my favorites. There is nothing complicated about the workouts. One minute cardio, one minute strength, one minute cardio, one minute strength, etc. until 30 minutes are up (probably around 35 minutes with warm up and cool down). The intervals progressively get harder but there are always modifications available. You also never get bored with one exercise because it is always changing. Cindy Whitmarsh is one of the most motivating and enthusiastic instructors on DVD today. Her cues are near perfect and I think she talks just enough to keep you motivated, but not enough to annoy. If you have ever wanted to try interval training, this is a pretty good one to start with. Try it out!",1350000000,,847,4.7687074829931975

I am in pretty good shape, I work out 6 days a week for about an hour a day-all high impact, mainly tae bo (I love the get ripped workouts by Billy Blanks-highly recommend them-excellent cardio). Anyway, I got this workout because I wanted to try something new that incorporated weights (I use 8lb weights for both the upper and lower body segments..you can use 3 to 5 lb weights instead, as is stated on the dvd). I think Cindy is a very good instructor..motivating and talkative but not annoyingly so. There is an upper body and lower body workout both about 32 minutes long-you do 1 minute of cardio then one minute of weight training. The time goes by so fast because you're not stuck doing the same exercise for very long, so it keeps you on your toes. I would recommend this workout to someone who is at a beginner to intermediate level.

3560279,5,B001F12IT4,"I recently started working out in earnest after a hiatus from my normal fitness routine.  I found that this workout was good for a few reasons: It took care of lower and upper body workout exercises by alternating these two fun, challenging regimens, it was under an hour, you could choose the amount of weight used for your workouts, it has lower impact options if you need to build stamina or have joint issues, it is all about HIIT, which I love and know has given me great results, it is not hard on any of your joints while truly challenging you (for me, the upper body segment was tougher), Cindy Whitmarsh is is clear, concise and easy to listen to--and, encouraging when things get tough! I will say that after 5 days, I did notice a defined difference in my upper body and though my lower body is a little more stubborn, I am seeing more difference after just a week.  I did not change my eating at all during this time frame.  There is a diet booklet that comes with the dvds and it is a common sense approach, nothing extreme.  I do want to respond to what a couple of reviewers said separately--the music is not terrible or great-- but it also the same music used in Jackie Warners Circuit Training and nobody seemed to be bothered in any of her reviews.  If you watch enough of these dvds, there is quite a bit of musical recycling that happens in this industry.  Some reviewer said that Cindy Whitmarsh looked like a boy in another review.  I don't know what to say, other than she is quite fit, with little lower body fat or much fat in general. I think women either tend to be too critical, or want a fitness model that is more relateable (not super skinny). I thought she was fit, attractive and personable.  One last thing.  I am a Jackie Warner fan, but I was wondering, after having done the dvd a couple of times, if my dear JW hadn't borrowed a little from this--I'll have to check release dates for this and the Extreme Time Saver WO (which could mean nothing, they do time the release of these things and I enjoyed both). My only criticism of this dvd is that the cool down could use a minute or two more. This is a pretty accessible workout for most. If on the fence, watch it on you tube or just get it.

She explains the workout and I was able to do it the first time without rewinding or missing what she was explaining. I did, however, do the less-intense workout until I get to know the workout better.
Will it give me a better body in 10 days? Who knows. I don't care. Workouts take time and depend on lots of variables.

Ordered this video and not only does she give a low or no impact version but the low impact version actually gives a great workout and the high impact moves are not so harsh that I can actually do many of them as well.  The video does 1 minute intervals so the quick transitions keep you from being bored or stressing to much in one area for a long period of time. I noticed a big difference in the first week. Much more tone and defined.

Granted - I am by no means overweight - I gained about 15 pounds since I quit competing in dance and wanted to get my old body back. I can't speak for people who are actually trying to lose a large amount of weight - but I CAN say no matter who you are that you will enjoy this video and every bit of physical activity helps!

3560287,5,B001F12IT4,"First, I want to give props to Amazon...like a few others, I also ordered this and received a different DVD packaged in this packaging.  I called Amazon, and they IMMEDIATELY issued me a refund.  I reordered this DVD and had it two days later.  Amazon's customer service is awesome!

Now, on to a review of this DVD.  I really like it.  It's not as hard-core as Jillian Michaels' workouts, or so it seems while I'm doing it.  But, my heart rate monitor says otherwise...I've been burning an average of 500-600 calories per 30-minute workout.  So, on second thought, I guess it is!  And I can really feel it after I've worked out.  I'm so sore!

I like the upper body workout...there are some moves I really love, such as the crunch-weighted punch combo (I can really feel it in my obliques!) and the balancing bicep curls.  I agree w/ a previous reviewer who commented the plank work is more intermediate/advanced, but that's okay...I modify as needed.  The lower body workout is a killer.  The first day I did it, I had to put two days (instead of one) between workouts.  I was so sore!  I was still sore that third day, but I did it anyways.  There are also some moves in this lower body workout I really, really love, such as the two different versions of dead lifts.  Also, Cindy does a lot of balancing moves w/ the weights which is what I seem to really like.

Pros:  As others have noted, the cueing is great.  I really like Cindy as an instructor.  She's perky, but not overly so.  Also, this DVD is easy to modify (since Cindy shows you the easy moves before moving to the harder ones).  I like this because some days I need a light workout, but I'm still getting high calorie burn.

Cons:  I don't feel like the warm ups and cool downs are substantive enough.  I'm really looking for more stretching after the workout, and I don't feel like I'm getting it.  Maybe someone can recommend a good stretching DVD?  Also, because these moves can be easily modified, it's easy to slack off and not push myself.  So it's a double-edged sword...if I know what the modifications are, I tend to stick w/ them instead of pushing myself.  And Cindy's perkiness doesn't necessarily push me to work harder the way Jillian Michaels does.

Overall, great DVD to add to your collection.  I haven't tried the meal plan, but it seems doable if you're not a super-picky eater, like me.  :o)  It includes lots of seafood dishes, which I don't eat, so I might take another look at it and see what I can do to modify.  I eat most of these foods daily anyways.

EDIT:  I'm editing my review to change it to five stars.  I LOVE it.  I find I'm doing this every day...I really like Cindy.  I've gotten used to pushing myself (and the workouts are getting easier).",1268179200,11,2746,4.44466800804829

I wanted a few options so I wouldn't get bored and be tempted to stop.  I almost did NOT buy this video thanks to the pathetic cover...I mean really??  Due to reviews I did buy it though and I am SO glad that I did!!

I think the BEST part of this video was how it flew by!  Normally my biggest problem (in the gym, with a video) is that even if I am not tired, I am always watching the clock..I guess it's a personal hangup...I might have glanced at the clock while doing the upper body portion of this video once or twice...which is 10 times less than usual...yes!  I think it's because everything is only ONE minute...great because you know you can do anything for one minute and it goes so fast you've got to keep an eye on the tv (not the clock) to keep up.

They would kick my ass every time.  Well that was the case until I found this DVD!  I popped it in and she starts right up.  There is only one instructor.  I loved that, I felt like I was getting one-on-one training time in.  She's not annoying and is quietly motivating.  Very stark contrast to Jillian who's annoying comments leaving me putting the DVD on mute the whole time.  (Sorry Jillian!)  Her body is a bit masculine, but that didn't put me off.

If you are a beginner you can do the low impact cardio with lighter weights and work your way up.  More advanced, increase your weight.  I like this because I can get cardio and toning together in about a half hour.  Cindy Whitmarsh is a very likeable instructor as well.  I recommend this.",1258070400,2,590,4.4392523364485985
3560291,5,B001F12IT4,"I think that workout video promises are usually a lot of hype, but in this case the promise is vague enough and the workout intense enough that the promise is probably good.  ""If you alternate these two workouts for ten days and follow my Better Body Meal Plan, you will see amazing body-transforming results,"" says Cindy Whitmarsh in the intro, and if you do exactly that, you will almost certainly see ""results"" in 10 days.

But if you have to dig through two years of junk in the closet to find your hand weights, if you try to push yourself to do the hard version of this video from day one you'll be flirting with injury.

There are two 30 minute workouts, one for the upper body and one for the lower body, and they are quite intense.  Alternating daily between the upper and the lower body gives the body a day to recover and heal the body part you worked yesterday.

Cindy is an excellent trainer.  She's encouraging without being annoying.  She shares a lot of useful information (""When my clients come to me and they say 'Cindy, I want better arms,' first thing we do is shoulders.  It's really the secret to strong, sexy arms."") and she constantly explains and demonstrates good form, which is important to protect against injury and to maximize results.  She starts every cardio interval with a low impact version, then moves to a high-impact version.  You can choose the level which is appropriate for you, keeping it low impact if you need to.  The most difficult weightlifting intervals get the same kind of treatment.

I really like the exercises she uses.  Sometimes she takes the old standards and varies them a bit (instead of simply raising and lowering weights behind her head for the triceps, for example, she'll alternate that with pulses,) and sometimes she finds ways to modify exercises to work two different sets of muscles at once.  Even though I'm not doing this workout exactly as instructed--I'm injured and it's too intense for my knees--I'm watching it regularly and incorporating many of the exercises into my regular workout.

The intervals are one minute each: a minute of cardio, a minute of weights, and back to cardio.  This isn't how I normally work, but I've found that alternating this way allows for a more intense cardio workout because the minute of weights gives a minute to lower my heart rate slightly and catch my breath.  It also improves my workout with weights because my heart rate is higher than it normally would be, my oxygen intake is better, and all my muscles are warm.  It's a great format.

For the upper body workout you'll need two sets of weights.  The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/light-weights/dp/B000I1BR6M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">light weights</a>&nbsp;should be anywhere from 3 to 5 pounds, and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/heavy-weights/dp/B000I1FB8M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">heavy weights</a>&nbsp;should be 8 or 10 pounds.  You'll also need&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/a-mat/dp/B0007IS71O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">a mat</a>&nbsp;for the ab workout at the end.  The lower body workout uses the heavy weights and the mat.

The two things I dislike aren't enough to take a star off this review.  The music is annoying.  It's not a big deal, but the more I watch this video the more I get sick of the music.  And at the end of each workout Cindy walks you through stretches, which are very important, but it's only for a couple of minutes and it's not really an optimal cool down.  If you've got the time to spare, you might want to stretch a bit more or even add a five or ten minute easy Yoga routine.

The meal plan will be tough if you don't already regulate your diet.  It's a high protein low fat meal plan that's appropriate for someone doing work with weights.  But it's no more than 1300 calories per day and very strict, even measuring the amount of ketchup and mustard you can use.

I understand why this video is marketed as a 10 day program, but I think that shortchanges it a bit.  This workout is a keeper, and once I recover I'll be doing it a few times a week, every week.",1256774400,4,4207,5.034682080924855

I absolutely love the 1 minute intervals.  It makes the workout go so much faster.  I find with some workouts I don't particularly care for, I find myself bored and I keep checking the time to see how much longer I have to work out.  With this one, it's over before I even realize it.  Sure Cindy's abs are a little distracting but she's got a great personality and I really enjoy the workout.

On days when I am short on time it feels good to be able to get a full workout done in 30 minutes.  I alternate these workouts and I am left feeling the burn and knowing that I had a great workout.

3560294,5,B001F12IT4,"My favorite aspect of this ""10 Days to a Better Body"" is the intervals.  She alternates between weight training (with a set each of light and heavy hand weights) and cardio.  I am out of shape, and the alternating really helped me be able to get through the video.  I think this video does a great job of challenging beginners and intermediates alike.  For instance, if a beginner can't get through the intermediate aspect of the workout, she encourages you to stick with the initial instructions.  She also encourages those who are not beginners to stretch themselves to attain a higher level of intensity with each move.  I have not achieved the full ten days yet, but results will be attained if these videos are followed.  This dvd also includes an eating plan that is equal to many low calorie diets you can find anywhere.",1248480000,,827,4.662068965517242
3560295,5,B001F12IT4,"I started using this DVD a few weeks ago and I've found it to be quite a bit of fun.  There are two 30 minute interval training workouts - one for the upper body and one for the lower.  You've probably seen the majority of the exercises in these workouts before (squats, lunges, push-ups, etc.), but they're still effective.  A quick abs interval is done at the end of each workout, but it's by no means a complete ab workout - I'd recommend having another DVD to use on off days.  There is a meal plan included with the DVD with some recipes.  They look good, but I haven't gotten around to trying it yet.  What can I say?  I hate cooking.

Workout-wise, I have an attention span of about a minute - I don't like doing the same thing for too long, and I get bored when moves are repeated over and over.  Because of that, the alternating one minute intervals of strength and cardio work well for me.  In addition, it provides a pretty good workout. I'm at about an intermediate level - for me this workout doesn't make me want to drop dead (see:  Jillian Michaels), but I always get my heart rate up and break a sweat.  Not too much equipment is needed - just light and heavy weights (I use 5lb and 8lb) and a mat.

The instructor is very pleasant - she's quite encouraging without ever crossing that dreaded line into annoying.  I know some people have mentioned that they don't like her straight up and down body - it's not really causing me too much distress.  She's in shape, so that's all I can ask.  She does really focus on form - there are always reminders to bend your knees to lift your weights up or to check positioning.  Low-impact modifications are only shown at the start of each cardio interval because afterwards the instructor does the high-impact version for the remaining time.  Personally, I like this because it motivates me to keep up with her, but some people may prefer to have someone else showing the low-impact versions to work along with.

The major thing that kind of threw me about the video is the fact that the girl on the cover isn't the instructor.  What a strange marketing ploy...

Anyway, I find this a great video to get a cardio and strength workout in a pretty short amount of time.  It always leaves you burning in the right places the day after working out (like that dreaded area between the butt and the back of the thighs).  Keep in mind that it's 10 days to a BETTER body, not the ideal body - go in with realistic expectations and I think this video can deliver some good results.",1247011200,,2528,4.3661670235546035

I can get VERY annoyed by instructors and then I don't want to use the DVD. Cindy is not annoying in any way. I think she gives very good cues, it's not hard to follow her, and I got a good workout, too. The best part: The price tag and it's quick. Don't know if I'll lose weight (I've just done each workout once), but that really depends on whether I control my eating (a diet plan is included). As far as how she looks, come on guys.

3560305,4,B001F12IT4,"Phew, two 30 minute workouts modeled on an interval training motif, that means alternating bursts of intense exercise and less intense pseudo rest exercise. The focus of each session is either upper body or lower body, perfect for alternating sessions to allow for muscle rest (hitting the same muscles on repeated days can lead to breakdown rather than building).

The key to a successful program is exercise (check) and diet (not so check). The DVD contains a meal plan (1200 calories per day), on the very low end of healthful and not one that I would recommend as sustainable for even 10 days unless you are a gazelle or field mouse. Coupled with a reasonably controlled diet the DVDs can help build a healthier body with a basal metabolic rate (muscle burns more calories than fat to maintain itself) that will help burn the fat at a realistic rate (perhaps more than 10 days, but then it is your body, so do it right).",1237075200,,924,4.634146341463414

This one is different.  It's like a personal training session with an excellent trainer-Cindy Whitmarsh (website: cindywhitmarshfitness) who is a highly sought after personal trainer who really knows her stuff.

The instructor displays proper form, presents compound interval movements for maximum fat burn, develops muscle definition, and really revs up the metabolism, she provides helpful workout tips, keeps you motivated to keep it up, isn't too ""rah-rah-shish-boom-bah"" or overly-perky, etc...

3560311,5,B001F12IT4,"I've been looking for another 1/2 hour workout so I can take a break from Jillian's 30 day Shred. I love 30 day Shred but my body needs something different for my exercise routine to be effective. This is it. Thanks for the great reviews online that convinced me to buy this. I have few other circuit training DVDs but they're a lot longer....

Cindy Whitmarsh cues well and she's very likeable. She put together 2 programs that made me sweat so much. The lower body routine left me sore for days. In both upper body and lower body routines, I was panting towards the end. I had to do the easier version of the cardio intervals to avoid quitting! I also did the hi-impact moves on my rebounder to take care of my joints. I'm 44 yrs. old now and may be prone to injuries. Alternating the programs makes it more effective by giving the muscles time to recover. There are some new moves and there are traditional ones. I really liked how Cindy choreographed these 1/2 hour programs (warm-up, alternating 1 min. strength/1 min. cardio, a little bit of abs then cooldown). My workout time was used here very wisely.

It says in the booklet that came with it that for faster results, I can add more cardio SO I did intervals on the treadmill right after I was done with either programs. It was the prevention magazine's 8 OR 12 min routine where you warm up for 2 min, run very fast for 20 sec, walk easy the next 40 sec, repeat the cycle until the last 2 min. for cool down. After that, I was soaked! It felt like I worked out for 90 min. but really just around 45 min.

I believe that I'll get quicker results if I strictly follow her meal plan BUT I don't. I can't handle <1600 calories a day. Healthier body, sure but better looking in 10 days, I don't think so!

Although if you didn't worked out recently or after surgery/pregnancy might be dificult to get into it, sticking to the low impact version and making some modification as another reviewer noted will help you through it.

The video has an intro and is divide into an upper body and ower body workout.  The segments use weights and aerobic-cardio activity.  Each segment is a little over 30 minutes.  You can do both segments together, or you can alternate days, alternating days is probable the best option.

You will need two sets of weights a light set 3 or 5 pounds and a heavier set 8 or 10.

I like the upper body workout, I hate working out my legs.

The calorie menus give you a good idea of what you should be eating, I did not go that low on the calories, but I followed the workout program for 10 days, I enjoyed the video, I don't know if my body is better or not, but my self confidence is good and I like the video and so I will use them again.",1233446400,3,1115,4.197183098591549

The instructor is NOT the girl pictured on the front of the cover.  The instructor has a really cute face, and the body of a sixteen year old boy.  Honestly, she wasn't feminine at all with any curves or lean muscle.  It was bizarre to watch, it looked like you put a girl's head on top of a high school boy's body, there was a complete disconnect.  I can't comment on the quality of the exercises because once she started doing the rowing exercises 5 minutes into it I was so grossed out I had to turn it off and switch to another DVD.

The workout is decently challenging but, IMO, it'll take much longer than 10 days to get a body like the woman on the cover, depending on your starting point of course.  I liked the instructor and she was very easy to follow along to which I find is very important.  It does pack a decent workout into a half an hour that's for sure.

It's a fast paced 2-section workout - upper and lower body - with alternating cardio intervals (everything is 1 minute long). In the 30-minute upper body section you need one light and one heavy set.

Admittedly to my surprise, this DVD packed two decent routines into the one DVD.  I particularly liked the interval training, as it kept the intensity and impact from being overwhelming.  That said, it was intense and if you haven't exercised before, you would be wise to take the low intensity option provided until you build your stamina and conditioning.

The instructor provided good cuing, which enabled me to get a good workout even on the first attempt.  After using Kathy Smith, The Firm, Leslie Sansone, Richard Simmons and others for years, it does seem strange to have just the instructor on the DVD, but it does prevent you from becoming distracted and helps you maintain your focus.

Overall, if you're looking for a DVD that provides a mix of cardio and weight training, particularly if you want to try the interval training that you hear is particularly good for cardio fitness and fat burning, I would recommend giving this DVD a try.

I don't think the video is super hard and if you are already doing really aerobic work outs this might not be a challenge although she does offer a easy version and a pumped up version of some of her exercises.  You need weights and a yoga mat for this video.

This video recommends that you eat a 1200-1300 calorie diet I ate around 1600 calories a day and probably more on some days.  I didn't exercise the full 10 days with the video I probably missed 3 times but those 3 times I did walk 30 minutes.

The workouts are good - I really like the pace, the ease of the workouts and the instructor actually sweats which makes me feel better about how much I'm sweating.

The only thing I wasn't prepared for was the equipment used - I have weights but there are some exercises that require using the weights to prop yourself up off the floor - easy enough to modify, but my weights are shaped funny and don't allow me to use them in the same way.

3560327,2,B001F12IT4,"As a veteran of many many exercise tapes especially around this time of year, there are certain things they must have to keep me using them.  This tape is an average exercise tape broken up into 2 exercise cycles, it has a lot of aerobic in it and exercises that have a easy and a more advanced exercise to change up too.

Things I personally didn't like:
1.  The tape only had the instructor on it.  I like to see at least a couple of people working out with the instructor usually because everyone is at a slightly different level.

2.  In fine print, on the back of the box, it says hand weights are recommended, yet in its blurb on Amazon's page it didn't mention you needed weights.  So I was completely surprised and didn't have any to work out with the video, had to pretend and do the motions.

3. The instructor gives you an exercise and than gives you a variation that you can switch too during the exercise, a more advanced one. However she continues through the exercise doing the more advanced one.  It made me feel inferior to keep doing the less advanced exercise.  This is where it would have helped if there had been someone else exercising with her that I could have kept up with.

4.  It comes with a daily meal plan book, really nice in itself if you have a time to plan to keep all those foods in your house.  However if you wanted to use the menu and start the exercising when you opened up your dvd, you couldn't do it immediately.

5.  I like mat exercises, especially when working on stomach or abs.  There was only 1 mat workout, everything else was jumping, etc. to burn off those areas.

These are the things that will keep me from picking this dvd up again, but of course my negatives may be something you prefer in your exercise video.",1231372800,13,1765,4.316109422492401

3560329,1,B001F12IT4,"This is an acceptable exercise video for people who are already in good condition.  If you are used to working out (Body Blast, aerobics w/ light weights, etc) then this is a good DVD to have.  If you miss a class, or just need an extra workout, this is good.

If you are NOT in good shape, skip this DVD.  There are a lot of high impact moves here, and many exercises in this DVD are not good for beginners or those who are not in good shape.

The weight loss plan attached is basic and well-planned.  It is in a small booklet enclosed with the DVD.",1231286400,8,550,4.093457943925234

The mood is very professional and upbeat. Two difficulty levels are presented for those of different abilties.

3560331,5,B001F12IT4,"I did this workout for 10 days as recommended.  It is a bit advanced, but I did what I could.  I feel like I got a real thorough workout.

This DVD comes with 2 intense 30-minute workouts.  It is interval training; it is 1 minute of cardio, and 1 minute strength training, using light and heavy weights, and so on for 30 minutes.  One 30-minute set is for upper-body, and one is for lower-body.  There is a 10-day diet included.

The music is ok, and actually goes with the workout, which is a plus.

I think that overall the diet is a good one; however, I have a problem with most of these diets that require expensive grocery shopping, moderate food preparation, and not a good use of leftovers.

I recommend this DVD, however, because for 30-minute workouts, they are amazing.

Also, I am particularly impressed with how little space on the floor you need to do these workouts.

The instructor/trainer is flawless, and her queuing is clear.

I recommend, that, if you are not in good shape, eat enough food for energy.  I made the mistake of starting the diet and exercise at the same time.  I was very weak.

I will come back to this one!",1231200000,15,1142,4.423076923076923
3560332,5,B001F12IT4,"The dvd workout is broken down into two parts: upper body and lower body workouts.  Both workouts apply the interval training approach => combo of the specifi move and then one minute cardio.  All you need is you, two weights (one heavy between 8-10 lbs and 3-5lb). both parts of about 35 minutes each.  The dvd also comes with a dietary plan.

The instructions were clear and the moves are new and not the typical ones you are use to seeing in the gym.  I love the pieces for the abs as I don't love working on my abs and the moves were new and refreshing that I hardly realized that I was doing abs workouts.  Although the moves are not strenguous in themselves, the reps with the cardio interval really make you feel you have had a good work out.  Just like when I use to go to the gym!

This workout is great for all levels as beginners can take it easier and the intermediate to advance can push a little harder with heavier weights and more repetitions.  The recommended weights in the dvd are more for intermediate to advanced.  I would recommend using lower weights if you are a beginner.

I love working out at home as my lifestyle does not allow me to attend gym classes on a regular basis.  This dvd is really one of the best and new workouts since cindy crawford's (for more intermediate to advance I would highly recommend her first two workout dvds).  I have reviewed quite a few workout dvds and I hope this becomes a popular one for anyone who prefers to workout at home. 10 days to a better body?  I am a fairly healthy eater so the dietary book was not that useful for me; but after using this dvd daily for the past 6 mornings, I feel better and my upper body is able to do more repetitions.  I am definately going to incoporate this dvd along with my other preferred dvd workouts.  It is a keeper.",1231200000,2,1817,4.284457478005865
3560333,5,B001F12IT4,"When I ordered this video, I was skeptical like one of the other reviewers.  I have now had 3 children and I don't expect to look like the girl on the cover of this video--but I would like to get my stomach back!  I've only been doing this video for 3 days and I can already see a difference.  I never would have believed it if someone had tried to convince me that this video could do that!  I am horrible about doing ab workouts (because they hurt!) so I really love how this video gives my abs a workout without making it too intense all at one time.

I am definitely going to stick with this video.  The intervals are only 1 minute long which makes anything easy enough for me to persevere through.  I do have knee problems sometimes, so I can't do cardio exercises that require me to twist on my knees during the exercise.  There are only 2 different one minute intervals that I have to do the low impact version that she introduces at the beginning of each interval instead of the high impact version.

As other reviewers noted, this video is an intermediate level workout--not a beginner, though it can be if you do the low impact modifications that she introduces for each interval.  It does take some coordination and balance to do the workout.  I would recommend it for someone who likes to work out regularly and is looking for something a little more intense than the Leslie Sansone Walk workouts and a little less intense than a Pilates Workout.  I definitely love it!",1231113600,25,1481,4.424354243542435
3560334,4,B001F12IT4,"Two do-able yet intense workout sessions.  I got tired just watching host Cindy Whitmarsh go through these two 30-minute or so workouts, but committed fitness mavens should have no problem, or at least not too much of one.  You'll need a couple of light weights if you want to follow Ms. Whitmarsh's moves exactly, though.

I like that the perky and exuberant Ms. Whitmarsh is healthy-looking and definitely in shape, yet doesn't have an unattainably perfect body (the woman on the DVD box apparently isn't Ms. Whitmarsh, though they look somewhat similar).  In many ways, in fact, Ms. Whitmarsh looks like a normal 40-ish woman, just one that takes care of herself.  That fact will help viewers refrain from thoughts along the lines of, ""What's the point... I'll never look like THAT.""

The DVD includes a generous, information-packed booklet containing Ms. Whitmarsh's suggested meal plan to accompany her ""10 Days to a Better Body"" workout.

All in all, this is a nice package for the modest price.  Just be prepared to do some work once you pop this DVD into your player.",1231113600,3,1075,4.868131868131868
3560335,4,B001F12IT4,"Like some other reviewers mentioned, I was prepared not to like this video.  Whenever the headline is a claim about a better body or weight loss in a set time period I get skeptical.  Lucky for me and my body, this video confronted my skepticism.

The DVD includes two 30-minute workout, one for your upper body and one for your lower body.  You also get a booklet with meals if you wanted to make a whole routine out of it and enhance your results.  Like many workout DVDs, the exercises themselves are stronger than the accompanying booklet.  The meals are pretty bland and uninspiring so you'd be better of consulting a book like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Small-Changes-Big-Results-A-12-Week-Action-Plan-to-a-Better-Life/dp/0307335879/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Small Changes, Big Results: A 12-Week Action Plan to a Better Life</a>&nbsp;if you wanted to make changes to your diet as well.  This isn't necessarily a ding on the product as I see the guide more as a bonus and would never buy this expecting a full program.

The workouts themselves are great.  They use interval training where you alternate one minute of cardio with one minute of strength training.  I liked that for the cardio, she provided both low impact and high impact options.  This makes it flexible for people of all skill levels.  Also if you live in a condominum, apartment, or dorm and are worried about the amount of noise you'll make bouncing around from a workout (Sounds silly, but I live in an old building so this is something I consider) the low impact versions don't involve any bouncing so you won't make too much noise.  For the strength training you use a set of light and heavy dumbells.  This is great because again, you can adjust to your skill level.  If you're more experienced, use higher weights or consider adding something like a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bosu-Balance-Trainer-Home-Version/dp/B00012PDMW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bosu Balance Trainer Home Version</a>&nbsp;(not shown in the video, but could easily be used during parts of it) for a greater challenge.  If you're newer to strength training you could also swap out the weights for full water bottles or soup cans if you don't want to purchase the equipment or find weights to be too heavy.  In addition to the weights (or appropriate substitute) you will need a mat for the ab exercises.

In totality I really enjoyed these workouts.  I liked that the interval approach kept my heart rate up and also kept me from feeling bored.  Even though I do weight training already, I found by using a challenging amount of weight that I could really feel the burn and was sore the next day.  Yes, the weight training exercises are not revolutionary if you've already been lifting, but sometimes it's nice to have a video to switch things up, especially if you find yourself getting bored with your routine.

Overall, this was a really enjoyable workout.  It reminded me of taking a strength training class at a gym and was a challenging and easily customizable workout.  I was really impressed and would recommend this to my sister who likes working out and really enjoys taking classes at her gym.",1231113600,5,3252,5.2335907335907335
3560336,4,B001F12IT4,"Cindy Whitmarsh's workout consists of two, 35 minute workouts that can be done on alternating days. The first workout on the disc is upper body training. The second workout on the disc is lower body training and conditioning.  Only four weights are needed for this workout, a pair of 3 to five pound hand weights and a pair of 8 to 10 pound weights.  The weight training is done in one minute intervals with cardio conditioning.  Ms. Whitmarsh is enthusiastic, and chats throughout the workouts (""You can do anything for a minute,"" ""You need to focus."") I watched this DVD before I did the workouts, and the workouts are not as easy as they appear visually.  You will sweat quite a bit, and be very sore the day after you do the workouts.  I am an advanced excersizer, so I thought I could easily do both workouts together so I could review this item quickly.  I would not advise this until you have done the two workouts for at least two weeks on alternating days.
 This workout also includes a meal plan. I did not try the meal plan, but it did look nutritionally sound and helpful to someone going on a diet or wanting to change their eating habits.
 My likes about these workouts are that you do not need a lot of equipment to do them.  Also, they can be done in a small appartment or house easily-other workouts need lots of space.  Also, each workout only takes 35 minutes, which anyone could easily work into a busy schedule.
 My only gripes about this workout are aesthetic.  The woman pictured on the cover of the DVD is not the instructor, Cindy Whitmarsh.  She would have looked just as good in a bikini as whoever it is they decided to put on the cover of this workout.  Also, the outfit Cindy wears in the Upper body workout is not flattering to her figure. In this workout, she looks like a muscular toothpick, and that is just because her outfit is not appropriate.  Her outfit in the lower body workout is much more flattering to her figure.
 This workout is well worth your money.",1231113600,2,1997,4.445054945054945

She has easy to follow choreography in these workouts and I like her method and motivation. She says you can do anything for a minute which helps push you along when you are ready to fall over. Each workout is 30 minutes, and there is a lower and upper body workout to rotate for 10 days. This has become one of my favorite workout dvds. I did the lower workout yesterday and today I can barely move. I believe this one will do wonders for my thighs. Highly recommended and worth every penny!",1231027200,6,619,4.299145299145299
3560338,4,B001F12IT4,"At home workout DVD's and home workout equipment or regimes of any kind are hard to follow. If you already have a moderate or regular workout plan in action you will enjoy this DVD. It's balanced for cardio and flexibility, and includes two workouts, one for upper, one for lower body. I'm a fan of working the total body so this wasn't really for me, and I also think it is tailored more for women in general. It IS a good workout though, you will sweat and be blowing hard by the end of it, so if you are an average couch potato looking for a quick fix, this will probably be too much, too soon.
The cover pictures and claims on these discs always make me smile, and are pretty shameless with a bikini clad beauty, and the promise to lose 8 ponds in bold print. Results are possible, but please, be a little more subtle. 4 stars overall",1230854400,3,838,4.24375

8300503,5,B001F12IT4,"So, the catch is that you still have to get motivated to actually do the DVD! I won't lie and say it's not challenging. It's hard. But, when I started using this, I was in ""not great"" shape. I basically did as many of the reps as I could, and then would huff and puff while I rested, catching up when I had the energy. And, after a couple weeks (I did the DVD every other day, alternating the two workouts), I found that I could actually do most of the stuff. I was impressed with my bad self, lol. When you're starting, give yourself room to be a little behind what they do. Cut yourself a little slack, and before you know it, you'll go farther than you thought you could.

More importantly, I actually started seeing an improvement in my shape. My waist started to curve in more. That little bit of fatty outer thigh started to flatten. My abs started to show. After going to the gym 3-4 times a week and NEVER seeing anything like these results, I have to say I was impressed. Cindy makes me feel encouraged, and the positive attitude is much nicer than someone barking negative things at me. She'll say things like, if you're starting to feel a little tired, I want you to think of your goals! Think  of your shoulders in that little black dress! Or, other, similarly nice things. It's like a friend talking to you.

There are quite a bit of exercises which may be challenging if you have bad knees or balance (lunges, squats), so you may want to find something else if that sounds like you. I've rented a lot of exercise DVDs from my library and honestly, so many of them suck. They're way too hard or boring, and I lose all interest in minutes.

I could convince myself that I can get through anything for just a minute.  There are two workout one for upper body and one for lower body  and both are a half an hour.  A half hour a day is totally doable even with a hectic lifestyle.  Your body will be feeling the exercise the next day.  The instructor recommends one set of light weights (3-5 lbs) and one set of heavy (8-10) pounds.  I only had 3 and 5 lbs and I still felt it the next day.

If you keep up with the program for all 10 days you will see the results and the DVD will begin to get a lot easier.  I like to keep this into rotation with all of my others but this is at the top of the list.

The instructor is upbeat and can be a little too happy for some people and she never stops talking.  I didn't mind it, I found her to be motivating and great at cuing.
