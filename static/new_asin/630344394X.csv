670453,5,630344394X,"I love both the book of NATIONAL VELVET and this film, which makes small changes to the book, but the theme and joy remain the same. Sickly Velvet Brown wins a fractious horse in a lottery and she and ex-jockey Mi Taylor train the horse to race in England's most famous steeplechase, the Grand National, a grueling race with frightening jumps. Velvet's family--her wise mother, excitable father, lovelorn older sister, telltale other sister, and mischievous little brother are all entertaining in their own right--some of the best scenes in the movie are between Anne Revere as Mrs. Brown and Donald Crisp as Mr. Brown. All this in glorious Technicolor recreating an English village of the 1920s. A must-have. Read the book as well--there is another sister in the story, more horse incidents, and it's not ""translated"" for American sensibilities like Harry Potter, so you get a real feel for English life and dialect at the time.",1069459200,2,929,4.961538461538462
670454,5,630344394X,"Enid Bagnold's novel, ""National Velvet"" was a delightful book and now can be enjoyed in this 1945 Full Screen Color Classic Family Film.
This film has a fantastic ensemble cast.  (Mickey Rooney as Mi Taylor a drifter (jockey) looking to restore his riding confidence. Anne Revere (Oscar winning performance)as Velvet's endearing mother.  Angela Lansbury as Velvet's older sister. And 12 year old Elizabeth Taylor as Velvet Brown in her first starring role that made her a star.)
Summary:  Obsessed young girl Velvet Brown dreams of owning this prize wild horse (Pi), racing him in the Grand National Steeplechase which has a 100 pound sterling entry fee & oh yes only male jockeys are permitted to ride.  All she ever talks about is horses.  Only supporter is her mother who encourages her to reach for the stars.  Through fate, the movies, and a great upbeat family storyline gets the horse Pi (won it in a lottery), with Mi trains the horse, enters the Grand National (gets 100 pounds entry fee from mother), & disguised as a boy wins the race!!!!  What a great story and totally enjoyable experience for the viewers to cheer about.
Add this valuable family classic to your DVD library today.  This is a keeper.  Enjoy.",1012262400,11,1221,4.831730769230769
670455,5,630344394X,"I'm ten and I got the movie "" National Velvet"" for a Christmas present. I am horse crazy- well you know I love horses. I watched the movie and I loved it! I thounght Velvet Brown (Elizabeth Brown)was a great character. The mother, Mrs. Brown was a good mother to Velvet. I thought Donald Brown, (Mrs. Brown's son)was very funny. I watched the movie twice already and I'm sure I'll watch it much more!!!!!",1009843200,,404,4.472972972972973
670456,5,630344394X,"Somehow I never got around to see this movie until I was 40 years old.  I  guess it was because I was never really an Elizabeth Taylor fan, although I  have always enjoyed ""The Taming of the Shrew"" and ""Who's  Afraid of Virginia Woolf?""  But I was at the library and I had always  heard good things about it and so I checked in out and took it home and  watched it and feel in love with it.
The plot line involving Mike (Mickey  Rooney) starts off as somewhat melodramatic, the standard story (literarly  in this case) of the guy who has to get back on the horse.  The twist is  that when he does our young heroine has decided she is the only one who can  ride the Pie to victory.  The twist is the Rooney achieves his victory  without winning (anticipating ""Rocky"" in that regard when you  stop and think about it).
The focus of the film is on Taylor and Rooney,  but the heart and soul of the film is the relationship between Velvet and  her mother.  Anne Reeve won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her  portrayal of the mother, and while her scenes with husband Donald Crip are  small gems scattered throughout the film (they call each other ""Mr.  Brown"" and ""Mrs. Brown"" and you can tell how much they love  each other every time they do it), it is the scenes with her daughter that  bring home the film.
Mrs. Brown uses the money from her swimming the  channel to fund Velvet's dream of racing the pie in the Grand National.  But for Velvet the payoff is not when she wins the race and becames a front  page story, but when she arrives home and immediately runs to her mother  and says, ""We won, Mother.  We won.""  Her mother already knows.  All of England knows.  But all that mattered was telling her mother.  It is  a neat scene and an ellegant payoff to the film, more so than her running  off to fetch make Mike.
This 1944 film was directed by Clarence Brown and  is based on the novel by Enid Bagnold.  Final Warning:  And if after you  have watched and enjoyed this classic film with your children and you  screen the sequel ""International Velvet"" which only leaves a bad  taste in your mouth, you have only yourself to blame.",968371200,15,2141,4.308080808080808
670457,5,630344394X,"On a fine sunny day we see a boy walking, jauntily with a spring in his step, along a dirt lane whistling a happy tune. The lane is bordered by  carefully planted shrubs which form a hedge on each side. In the distance  we see an expanse of water. The titles come up in bright yellow followed by  the message "" ENGLAND IN THE LATE TWENTIES - A LONG TIME AGO IN A  SPINNING WORLD"". The boy comes to a sign and a fork in the road and  ahead is visible a long stretch of beach, a blue sea with white surf  breaking on white sand and the hints of settlement in the form of a  village. He sits and rests, wiping his forehead. Cut to a school hall  resembling a church building with ivy on its exterior, an oak at its side  and children joyously spilling out of its door. Cut to interior with a  class of girls standing in their places, in order of size behind their  desks from front to back, in chorus singing a ditty about ""Happy,  happy holiday etc"". Elizabeth Taylor (as ""Velvet"")stands out  in the class, in the middle, with her jet black hair, violet eyes, red  dress and white trim, and her braces; and then at the front of the group  when the children rush to the front to hear the words of wisdom from the  teacher showing great affection for this seminal authority figure. The  light, the hope, that shines from Velvet's face is a marvel to witness. My  love for this film rests much on the contrast between the theme of the free  spirit versus the ordered life and the benefits that are evident in both  but the difficulty indeed impossibility of having both at the same time.  The horse ""Pi"" symbolises, like Mickey Rooney (as Mi Taylor),  that free spirit, and Elizabeth Taylor(as Velvet Brown) tries to  ""civilise"" or at least, train, both. With the horse, she succeeds  through love. She succeeds up to a point with Mi. Much of the film's  tension comes through the conflict between authority (of the father, the  mother, the police,etc)and the likes of Mi and the horse which at one point  runs wild destroying various items within the village including some  carefully cultivated flowers in a private garden. I feel also that Mickey  may have represented the free spirit of the American whose presence at this  time in England at the time of this film's production (1944) was manifest  and somewhat controversial especially regarding the attractiveness(economic  and spiritual)of the American Servicemen to the English women. When Velvet  wins the race posing as a boy jockey, it's her one victory and the  implication is that her life will take its expected path - she rejects  Hollywood offers following her astounding victory, for life in the village  with her wonderful family. Pi is taken out of racing to be free to roam  albeit within the confines of his enclosure by the sea. Mi returns to his  travels where the world itself is his home - when Velvet first meets him  she asks ""Where should you be?"" He replies ""Anyplace my feet  take me."" When she tells him that she has two sisters and a brother  and her father is a butcher, she asks him what he's got and he replies  "" The whole world. My Pa left it to me.""  There is tension  between the Romantic and the Practical - in the beginning it seems Mi is  filled with practical no nonsense information about horses, food, travel,  money whilst Velvet is filled with romantic notions, hope and idealism. In  the end, its Mi who continues to travel on his life's journey while Velvet  decides to opt for the sensible comforts of her stable village life. Little  does she know, but that her world, and ours, has changed for ever. It's the  real beginning of the rise of the United States of America. There is a  certain poignancy about the film, the knowledge that one kind of life is  ending and another beginning.  In terms of craft, acting, production  values, direction, it seems to me to be faultless. It doesn't deserve to be  shunted off as a ""family film"". It's superior by far to GONE WITH  THE WIND for example. It deserves to be spoken of in the same breath as  WIZARD OF OZ, THE PHILADELPHIA STORY, etc",967161600,9,4081,4.506155950752394
670458,4,630344394X,"It's not hard to see how Elizabeth Taylor became such a big star when you see her as Velvet Brown in National Velvet, her first important role. Besides already being very pretty, she is endearing as the young girl who  dreams of her horse winning the Grand National Steeplechase, discovering  that she herself may have to be the jockey.  The rest of the cast are  terrific, with special praise for the understated performance by Anne  Revere as Velvet's wise and understanding mother. The sequences at the race  are well filmed, the Technicolor beautiful, and the story hits all the  right notes.  Children, especially young girls who love horses, will enjoy  the film a lot.",960595200,7,675,4.850877192982456

Mickey Rooney as Mi Taylor does a good job of playing a boy that is  good at heart but having to deal with some hard luck in life. Mr. and Mrs.  Brown give us some of the best moments in the film, it is very touching in  the end when they address each other by their first names (rather than just  as Mrs. Brown or Mr. Brown). Velvet's little brother is a great example of  annoying little brothers everywhere. The story moves along quickly, never  really gets dull, and comes to the usual happy ending for all.",946771200,,669,4.354838709677419

670747,3,630344394X,"Review of National Velvet
Hot Toasty Rag, July 19, 2017

After Elizabeth Taylor showed her beautiful face in 1943s Lassie Come Home, MGM put her in another animal movie, but this time gave her the lead role and let her shine. Usually, when casting childrens roles, Hollywood tends to cast older actors, but in National Velvet, young Elizabeth was twelve when she played a twelve-year-old character. Its truly remarkable to see young children with great acting chops.

In the film, Elizabeth plays Velvet, an English girl attached to her horse. Mickey Rooney drifts into town and is hired by Donald Crisp to work in his stables. As the family gets to know the newcomer better, they learn he used to be a jockey. As he bonds with the endearing little girl, she convinces him to train her horse for the races.

National Velvet is so much better than The Story of Seabiscuit, just in case you saw that 1939 flop and assumed all old horse movies were that terrible. Both young leads have an enthusiastic energy that carries the story, and the iconic footage of Elizabeth Taylor on horseback is darling. This is a must-see for fans who want to see her first leading role.",1500422400,,1165,4.673170731707317

670751,5,630344394X,"I loved this movie.

Elizabeth Taylor was 12 years old, both in the movie and in real life.
She was so beautiful and sweet, before all of those marriages and other stresses changed her.

This is a movie that is timeless.

I loved the character of the mother.
I loved the way that she always had something wise and deep to say, without putting anyone down by it.
I thought that it was adorable the way that the parents called each other Mr. and Mrs. Brown, but at the end, they used each other's names.
I could feel so much love coming out of the mother's character that it really touched me.

Only one thing bothered me about the story :
Velvet said that she didn't want the Pie to do anything after the Grand National, because she didn't want him to be stared at.
But, she didn't have a problem with the Pie being stared at during the Grand National.
She said that she wanted the Pie to be great, but why shouldn't he continue to be great after the race?",1490918400,,955,4.230769230769231

Who cares) There are a couple of brief distortions and and one that lasts a few seconds.  Even my 8 year old granddaughter noticed it and commented on it.  But I have to say, it's still the best 5 star movie made to bring to life the wildest dreams a child can have.  My grandkids (ages 4 to 8) have watched this over and over (and over) again.  The story is captivating and engaging and kids are a LOT more forgiving and FAR less critical than adults.  The film itself could have been cleaner and handled with a little more care, but it hasn't touched the wonderful story or the excitement of the race.  My granddaughter walked away with a head full of dreams just the way the movie has inspired children since it was first made.  For adults to deny their children the pleasure and delights of this wonderful----on a grand scale----movie because of their own peevish aggravations, is a travesty!

I admired how one believes in something/someone having great potential while others are so quick to dismiss or write them off. This movie does a fantastic job in displaying one's belief, faith, and confidence can aspire them to do something greater. I'm not going to give away all the movie, but the lesson you'll take in this movie is that anything is possible if you believe and put your mind to it. A must watch.",1431388800,,517,4.51063829787234

National Velvet has now become one of my favorite Elizabeth Taylor films. It is a great story about faith and belief and a little determination. A great cast which includes Donald Crisp(plays Velvet's father), Ann Revere(plays Velvet's Mother and also won an academy award for her performance) Angela Lansbury(Velvet's older sister) and Mickey Rooney(the gypsy boy that helps velvet win her dream for Pi).

From the moment I put the disc in the player I knew this would be bad. There are no menus or chapter selections so the movie starts playing as soon as the disc is inserted whether you have had time to grab the popcorn or not. Awful start. For a classic movie there was obviously no effort put into the DVD production - speckled and poor resolution even for DVD standard. The aspect ratio is 1.33:1 which is fairly close to the original 1.37:1. The runtime is the same as the orginal and the disc has english subtitles but these are not much compensation. This disc set me back $5.99 although is probably worth around $4.00.  Would have paid $10-12 for a better product but Warner obviously doesn't want to present this movie in the style it deserves.

673109,5,630344394X,"So have you heard of: Marilyn Monroe's sixth toe? Or Marisa Tomei's fake Oscar win? The cryogenically frozen Walt Disney? Or Richard Gere and that unfortunate gerbil? Okay, what about this Hollywood urban legend: In 1943, when informed that she was too small and looked too young for the part of Velvet Brown in the upcoming film, NATIONAL VELVET, 12-year-old Elizabeth Taylor willed herself into growing three inches taller in the next three months. And whether thru a regimen of furious exercise and a strict diet or from reportedly hanging from a bar to stretch her spine, she really did grow those three inches in three months, and so she got the part. NATIONAL VELVET, adapted from Enid Bagnold's much-loved novel and released in 1944, would plant Liz Taylor on the road to cinematic immortality.

She is luminous and so ingratiating as the 12-year-old Velvet Brown, a child impossibly passionate about horses. So imagine her ecstatic response when she wins the unruly gelding, the Pie, in a town lottery. With the sometimes disgruntled tutoring of embittered road tramp (and former ex-jockey) Mi Taylor (Mickey Rooney), Velvet tames her wild horse and then entertains big dreams of entering the Pie in the grueling Grand National race, never mind the hundred to one odds.

For NATIONAL VELVET Elizabeth Taylor was this close to garnering a Special Oscar - one of those Academy Juvenile Awards - except that Peggy Ann Garner, who was so fantastic in A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN, trumped her. Mickey Rooney effectively veers away from his cheerful, wholesome image to play the surly, sort of fishy Mi Taylor. Mi Taylor, you see, exhibits a certain, to borrow Mr. Brown's words, ""watchful sharpness"" about him. It's a jarring moment, eyeballing a shady Mickey Rooney. The best surprise, though, is Anne Revere's captivating performance as Velvet's wise, understanding mother. Mrs. Brown once was a girl who dared to live out her dream and then had the practical sense to move on. So she understands her daughter's naive ambitions very well and she indulges them, but with a caveat. She cautions her daughter: ""Remember, Velvet, it will have to last you all the rest of your life."" The pitch-perfect Anne Revere deservedly won that year's Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.

NATIONAL VELVET is a classic; it's a timeless family film, one that I never tire of watching each year. It doesn't take place during the holidays, and yet there's a warm holiday glow to it. It's sentimental and nostalgic and hearkens back to an England set during the late 1920s. And whenever I drop in at my local barbershop and the chatter inevitably cycles back toward the best horses in cinema, the Pie is always well represented. He ranks right up there with the Black Stallion and Silver and the 'Biscuit. If you're a fan of MURDER SHE WROTE, note that Angela Lansbury has a supporting role as Velvet's oldest sister. If you're a fan of movie butlers of the 1930s, perennial manservant Arthur Treacher steps out of his usual role and has an amusing bit as a race patron.

You may be curious to know that, in 1978, a sequel to NATIONAL VELVET was released, titled INTERNATIONAL VELVET (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Four-Film-Favorites-Classic-Horse-Films-Black-Beauty-The-Story-of-Seabiscuit-National-Velvet-International-Velvet/dp/B000U1ZV58/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Four Film Favorites: Classic Horse Films (Black Beauty / The Story of Seabiscuit / National Velvet / International Velvet)</a>).

The movie is mostly set in Sewels, Sussex, England and stars a young Elizabeth Taylor as Velvet Brown who dreams of owning her own horse. On her way home from school, she meets a young drifter named Mi Taylor (played by Mickey Rooney) who looking for Velvet's mother. He had found Mrs. Brown's name and address in his late father's possessions.

The Browns hire Mi to help out around their farm and at their store. They also allow him to sleep in the barn. Velvet and Mi become friends despite the fact that Mi hates horses as he use to be a jockey.

A local farmer is raffling his horse ""Pirate"", because the horse is wild. The horse likes to get jump the fence and create chaos throughout the small village, practically putting the owner in debt. Despite the Browns rejections, Mi buys several raffles and gives them to Velvet and her siblings. To her luck, she wins the horse that she renames Pie.

Velvet has great faith in Pie and wants to enter him into the Grand National. She talks Mi into helping her train Pie for the great race and her mother gives her 100 pounds to enter into the race.

I've never really cared for watching horse racing movies, or horse moves in general, but&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/National-Velvet/dp/B00004RFHN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">National Velvet</a>&nbsp;was under five dollars and has a great cast (It even has the dog Daisy from the Blondie movies as the Browns' family dog.), so I decided to give it a try. Considering the age of the movie, the film looks great on DVD! Elizabeth Taylor gives a great performance as Velvet, the girl who loves horses, but my favorite character was Mi Taylor played by Mickey Rooney, as he is a flawed character. Several times he has a great amount of money in his hands, but he cares for the Browns and he doesn't want to disappoint them. The running time is a little over two hours, but I was so into the movie that it felt less than that. I recommend everyone to watch National Velvet.",1344988800,,2282,5.126344086021505

673216,3,630344394X,"This was Elizabeth Taylor's first starring role. She was playing a girl of 12, and may have been as much as a year or two older, at most. To tell you how old it is, Angela Lansbury plays her teen-age sister! Donald Crisp, great British character actor, played her father, and Mickey Rooney played the ex-jockey and trainer who help her prepare for the Grand National. (That's why she's called ""National Velvet."")

Velvet Brown is just plain crazy about horses. There's a very suggestive scene where she's in bed with two ropes over her big toes, using them as reins and galloping laying on the bed. So when a neighbor gets tired of paying for the damage caused by his new gelding every time he jumps the fence and runs through the town, he raffles him off. Predictably, Velvet wins him. She names him Pie because the neighbor referred to him as a wicked Pirate, but she said he was gentle. He is a very, very beautiful horse. (Warner Brothers gave him to Liz Taylor when they were done filming.) Since the Grand National is a steeplechase -- that is a race with jumps in it, lots of jumps -- the fact that Pie loves to jump fences is no problem at all.

It comes down to the night before the race, and there's no jockey. (The reasons are a little complex plot developments; I'll leave them to tell you all about it.) So Mickey Rooney says he will ride, although plainly he has a phobia about it. But Velvet is determined to ride herself, and she does, and she wins. But she was injured, and when the doctor took off her shirt to examine her, he ratted to the racing commissioner that she was a girl. So she won the race, and the respect of all those racing fans, but not the prize money.

It's a good movie in the standards of its day, and has historical significance due to its starring cast of young actors & actresses who went on to be famous. But it is pretty predictable, and more than a little corny. I'll give it three stars.",1337385600,,1932,4.346260387811634

But Elizabeth Taylor will always be Velvet Brown to me.
Based on the book NATIONAL VELVET, the movie showed me for the first time -- it was already black-and-white-old when I saw it on TV -- a girl who gave her heart to a horse and dared to have adventures.
Because horse stories are never JUST horse stories, it was about a girl taking control of something larger than herself. Velvet lived within the confines of her time -- 1920's, I think -- but she broke free to prove females bloody well could compete in the Grand National steeplechase even if they had to hack off their hair and bind their chests to do it.
I already loved horses when I saw the film, but it didn't bother me that the Piebald appeared not to be. I remember the gallops along the shore, yes, but even more I can still see Velvet's mother offering her daughter the entry fee for the race. The coins she unwrapped were cherished gold sovereigns she'd won years before swimming the English Channel.
My heart soared at the idea that somewhere -- in England, apparently! -- generations of daring women worked together. With horses. And courage.
RIP Elizabeth Taylor. I hope for you the best sort of Heaven, cantering green fields with the wind in your hair and a warm supper waiting for you at home

673375,2,630344394X,"Ok, I only gave this movie 2 stars because of the race. If it weren't for the race, I would have given it 1 star.
The movie is just pathetic.
1st off, the family is really...strange. The mother says, for example, ""What's wrong with folly?"" after Mi tells her it's folly to ride The Pie in the Grand National. All one needs to do is read a chapter or two from Proverbs to find out that folly is sin.
Another thing said in the movie by Velvet is, ""I would rather make my horse happy than go to heaven"". Now that's very pathetic, but the context she said it is possibly worse (possibly). She said it because she had gotten an invitation to be in a movie with her horse, and the ditsy little girl said of the Horse, ""He wouldn't want to be stared at"". She says this almost in tears. There's a lot more of these kind of lines in there, that I can't remember at the moment.
Then theres the part where Mi feeds the dog under the table and the Father says that they have very strict rules about not feeding the dog under the table. Then the camera shows each of them in turn, except the Father and Velvet, each feed the dog. Is this a good thing for children to be seeing?? It encourages disobedience to parents and portrays it as humorous. Then later in the movie, the Father feeds the dog?? Come on, that is NOT funny.
Then when Mi and Velvet cant find a jockey, Mi cuts Velvets beautiful hair off so that she can look like a boy and be the Jockey. I hated that scene very much. It detracted one star from the review.
Then we have the Mother putting her stamp of approval on her daughter being kissed by a boy because she was ""the right age for it"". When can people understand that the ""right age"" is marriage?
Then we have Mi challenging the fathers authority by buying raffle tickets. This is presented as ""humorous"" as well.

All in all it was a very bad movie that I would not want my Children to see that teaches disrespectful and disobedient behaviour.

But hey, what more could you expect from Godless Hollywood?
I would recommend you watch the Black Stallion if you want to watch a good movie with Mickey Rooney.
I hope this review was helpful and if I put any inaccurate statement in it please comment and I will fix it.

673379,4,630344394X,"Lots to like and love in this wonderful horse movie which has already been noted. For serious film critics, a few weaknesses follow.

The little boy in this movie is unnecessary. He doesn't add anything to it. He's loud, annoying, and has nothing to say. He's not cute; he's just annoying. And what's the purpose of his bigger sister painting his toenails with red nail polish?!

Mrs. Brown is tremendously overrated. There was so little emotional range in her role and it was not impressive acting. Winning an Oscar for it was absolutely ridiculous! If any actress in National Velvet should have got an Oscar it was Elizabeth Taylor.

Mickey Rooney had a great performance, too.

The relationship between Mr. Brown and Mrs. Brown and them always calling each other Mr. Brown and Mrs. Brown was supposed to be funny but it was grating.

The Grand National scene itself, the climax of the movie, was poorly written and disappointing. The ex-jockey continuously asking what's going on was annoying and almost ruined the scene.

The final shot of National Velvet could have been better.

I like how this family movie had good themes for both children and parents.

A lesson for parents in the story is if your child expresses her dream, be ready to run with it, and don't exploit her if she's successful.",1280534400,2,1301,4.776785714285714

Given some of the incidents of her adult life, it's refreshing to see what she was like in her innocent youth, but above all the story itself and the people in it are what make it a classic.

Velvet Brown (Taylor) is one of the four children of Herbert (Donald Crisp), a butcher, and his wife Araminta (Anne Revere), who at the age of 20 swam the English Channel when nobody thought a woman could do such a thing.  Her oldest sister Edwina (Angela Lansbury) is beginning to focus on boys; her only brother Donald (Jackie Jenkins) collects insects and tells tall tales; her second sister Malvolia (Juanita Quigley) is a passionate canary fancier; and Velvet is in love with horses.  ""Every night I pray to God to send me horses..."" she says.  When she first sees the half-wild chestnut called ""the Pie,"" she's lost forever.  And when the Pie's owner decides to raffle him off, she wins--and, spurred on by the stories of the cynical young ex-jockey Mi Taylor (Mickey Rooney), whose father was her mother's trainer, she resolves to train the horse for racing.  She's no piker, either: the Pie will be entered in the Grand National, the greatest race in the world.

Following closely the original book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/National-Velvet/dp/B000NYBN72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">National Velvet</a>, the movie doesn't gloss over the work involved in training the Pie to mind and bringing out his natural gifts as a jumper; and where it does depart from the novel (chiefly in the character of Mi, who's rather different from Enid Bagnold's vision of him), it does so plausibly and well--part of the thrust of the tale lies in how seeing Velvet's faith and resolve helps Mi get past his bitterness.  (In case anyone wonders, the horse in the book is a ""piebald""--what we call in the U.S. a pinto--and that's where his odd name comes from.)  Young girls of Velvet's age, who all seem to be in love with horses, should especially enjoy it, but all families will find it a pleasant evening's watching, with nothing in it to object to.",1265846400,,2277,4.921671018276762

It's almost as old as Keith Richards but its age barely shows. You'd have to be hopelessly hard and bitter not to get caught up in Velvet Brown's determination to enter the crazy, talented horse she wins in a raffle in the Grand National, the greatest steeplechase in the world. Yes, it's from a more innocent time, but there is plenty of humor for adults to enjoy. The acting is uniformly excellent. Mickey Rooney has one of his finest roles. Ann Revere and Donald Crisp delight as Velvet's parents. A very young Angela Lansbury plays Velvet's boy-crazy sister. Arthur Treacher of fish-and-chips shop fame plays a race fan. Elizabeth Taylor was never more vibrant, passionate and lovely. (She probably should have stuck with horses.) Unfortunately, with World War II raging in England in 1944, the filming had to be done in California, where the ever-present sunshine undermines the credibility of the English village setting, but that's a minor quibble. For its era, the film's depiction of what girls and women can accomplish with work and determination is remarkable. Highly recommended for the whole family.

Humane/animal rights activists take note: The ASPCA did not monitor animal action in films 64 years ago, and CGI did not exist. Many horses take some nasty falls during the Grand National. I have never been able to find out, but it would not surprise me if some became permanently lame or had to be euthanized after filming was complete.

673593,5,630344394X,"I have probably seen this movie a dozen times from start to finish and each time I come away with a renewed appreciation for hope, hard work, dreams and - yes - folly.  This movie, while without question dated and at times a little bit silly, stands the passage of time by virtue of its pure heart and strong moral messages.  Velvet Brown - the 12 year old daughter of a butcher in the small town of Sewels in England - wins her gelding, The Pie, in a one-shilling-per-ticket raffle. Mi Taylor, a young American lad walking the roads and lanes of England, comes to visit the Browns and ends up staying and training Velvet and The Pie for the Grand National - the Greatest Horse Race In The World, according to ex-jockey Mi Taylor.  My favorite character in the film is hands down Mrs. Brown, the mother, played by the inscrutable Anne Revere.  She is wise, gentle, strong - at 20 she swam the English channel - her trainer was Mi Taylor's fater, Dan Taylor - as she says, ""there was greatness in him"".  There is greatness in her.  Watch out for the speech she gives her daughter up in the attic when she tells Velvet that she will back her crazy dream to enter the Pie in the Grand National - she believes that ""everyone is intitled once in their life to a breathtaking piece of folly"".  She explains to her daughter that this dream must last her for her whole life- that she must know when it is over and to move on.  There is a time for everything in life, she explains - a time for riding a horse in the Grand national, a time for marriage, children, yes even for dying.  IN these crazy times when we all want everything fast, now, right away - Mrs. Brown's calm and sensible pacing make the world make sense.  Enjoy the film's many mealtimes and small moments.  One oddity though - in a family that appears to be English, living in England, the casting directors saw fit to put a very American actor in the part of the youngest Brown child, Donald.

673594,5,630344394X,"National Velvet is one of the finest family films ever made, and it contains one of the most exciting races, perhaps second only to the chariot race in Ben-Hur. Directed by Clarence Brown (The Yearling, The White Cliffs Of Dover, Edison The Man), who was nominated for Best Director, and based upon Enid Bagnold's novel, it tells the story of a girl named Velvet Brown, who is in love with horses - portrayed passionately and innocently by Elizabeth Taylor. Her father, Mr. Brown - played with good-natured stubbornness by Donald Crisp - and mother, Mrs. Brown - infused with even-tempered wisdom and efficiency by Anne Revere, who won the Oscar for her performance - provide a lot of the entertainment with their constant and playful bantering. Her brother, Donald - played comically but with stone-faced seriousness by Jackie 'Butch' Jenkins - older sister Edwina - given typical teenage aloofness by Angela Lansbury - and younger sister Mally - made likable but somewhat forgettable by Juanita Quigley - round out the family.

The real story is about the relationship between Velvet and a young itinerate named Mi - one of Mickey Rooney's most memorable performances. Mi's father knew the family, and now the son shows up on their doorstep with the idea of robbing them. But he changes his mind after realizing there is something about this family he would like to get to know. Velvet overwhelms him with her obsession over horses, especially since he dislikes them - apparently because of some bad experience. But he changes his mind when quite by chance she wins the county's finest stallion in a lottery. Mi realizes the horse's potential when he jumps a six foot wall, and helps Velvet train him for the Grand National - the most gruelling and dangerous steeplechase in terfdom, full of treacherous jumps and water hazards.

Besides the nomination for director Clarence Brown and the win for actress Anne Revere, the film was also nominated for its lush cinematography and delightful art direction, and won for its masterful editing. Much of this is due to editor Robert Kern's handling of the race, which forms the climax of the film. Except for the chariot race in Ben-Hur, I don't think there has ever been a more realistically staged or exciting race in a film. The stunt work is incredible. It would be a miracle if no men or horses were injured, because they go over those jumps pall mall, sometimes landing, apparently, on their heads, and often piling up on each other. Kudos to the stunt people, horses and trainers.

National Velvet warms and excites the heart, while leaving an impression of human nobility and spiritual values that will not soon be forgotten. And if someone isn't a horse lover at the end of this film, then there's no hope that they ever will be. Great directorial insight, intelligent writing, superb performances and top notch production values make this a small masterpiece.

673595,5,630344394X,"This is just a perfect film.  It is beautifully photographed in wonderful color, showing the charming life of an English country village in the 1920's....the sea, the flowers, the little butcher shop, the country school, the family drinking tea around the hearth....it's all here.  Who knows if life was ever this sweet?  I hope so.

The cast is superb and we are lucky to have these special people still living.  I agree that a DVD should be released with comments from the amazing Mickey Rooney, and Liz Taylor.  Angela Lansbury, too...wow, what longevity in the business.

Mickey is billed as the star and he is really wonderful here as the down on his luck drifter who battles his own demons to come out strong and good to help Velvet win the National.  But the movie belongs to the young, magical, lustrous Elizabeth Taylor, whose eyes shine with that special something that made her one of the all time great film stars ever.

She is so sweet without being cloying and ambitious without being bratty.

Perhaps the credit goes to the script or the director, but  her character comes across as pure delight to watch.

We expect to see the story of a young girl's dream enabling her to do the impossible---win the National.  We know this from the title and it does happen.  But it's about more than winning and that's what's extra special about this movie (and undoubtably the book).  The values of the family are extraordinary, the choices they make, from the beginning of taking in the sneaky suspicious kid (Mickey Roony's character), trusting him with what to them is an enormous sum of money, to their decision later not to exploit the fame of the girl and the horse..are really terrific in this day of ""winning is everything.""

673597,4,630344394X,"In ""Lassie Come Home,"" ""National Velvet,"" and ""The Courage of Lassie,"" Elizabeth Taylor was eleven years old ... Nevertheless, her charm and beauty were extraordinary, and what she lacked in talent and experience was well hidden in a fine production that was nominated for five Academy Awards...

As horse-trainer or dog-owner, as spurned wife or mistress, Liz is a female who is absorbed in the giving and receiving of love: devotion to the object of passion is the center of her life... Little Liz lavishes love on horses and dogs with remarkable intensity... Ecstatic; a dreamer with a turbulent emotional life, persistent, the young Liz dedicates herself to the prize-winning horse the way she later devotes herself to men...

Anticipating her later images of young sex goddess, Liz as Velvet is both saintly and mature... Howard Barnes, in the New York Herald Tribune, called her a child who 'lights up with the integrity of a great passion.'

Directed by Clarence Brown with loving attention to detail, the movie that made her a star is a big bestseller from another era set in Sussex, England, where Velvet Brown, a butcher's daughter, teams with a vagabond teenager named Mi Taylo (Mickey Rooney) to train for competition a horse she's won in a raffle...

From the coastal plains with its beaches, to the rolling hills, thatched cottages, and miles of country walks, ""National Velvet"" is the product of a bygone era in movie-making...

Following closely the structure of the popular Enid Bagnold novel, the movie is part horse story, part family portrait: scenes of training and riding are balanced by cozy family scenes, vignettes about young love and sermons from Mom on the virtues of courage and endurance...

The Browns are a noble version of Hollywood rustic... Dedicated to a sober work ethic, they live quiet, exemplary lives... Mrs. Brown (Anne Revere) is the very spirit of plain-folk wisdom; the spokeswoman for common sense and fair play, she knows well enough not to silence the semi-hysterical energy of her horse-crazy daughter, and she lets the girl have her dream...

On her way home she meets Mike Taylor (Mickey Rooney) and sees a horse which she names the Pi (short for the Pirate).

Mrs. Brown (Anne Revere) was a famous channel swimmer.  Mike's father was her coach.  Mr. Brown (Donald Crisp) is the town butcher and hires Mike to work for him.

When the Pi escapes and runs rampant through town, his owner decides to raffle him off.  Velvet gets the notion that she will win the horse; she's arranged it with God.  When she loses the raffle, she is heart broken.  She is so heart broken that she sees the whole town bringing her the Pi.  But it's true.  The number drawn hadn't been sold and the next number was Velvet's.

Then Velvet gets the idea to enter the Pi into the Grand National Steeplechase.  And finally, she decides to race the horse herself.

This was Liz's second starring role - fourth film.  You could see from this her true charisma was showing early on.  This was also an early role for Angela Lansbury.  This film she played a girl about her own age, a rarity for Lansbury.  Rooney was the veteran.  This was his 50th film.  But this was Mickey in transition.  He wanted to get away of being Andy Hardy, Judy Garland's boyfriend or the younger brother of the star of a film.  All proved they had the talent to go far.

The rest of the cast included many of MGM's greatest character actors.  But it was Anne Revere as the center rock of the Brown family that won the Oscar.  She gave a great performance that would be the standard and copied to this day.

The production values are the best of MGM's toughest standards.  You cannot fault any of the production values.

With a spirited young girl, a wonderful horse that was thought to be no good, and an ex-jockey that tried too hard to stay away from horses, a winning story was sure to be produced.  Velvet's family also played an important role as her mother (Academy Award winner Anne Revere), the quick tongue lady who could always convince her husband otherwise and Velvet's siblings, that put an emphasis on typical sibling relationships.  For it's time, when this film was produced, it was outstanding (Academy Award winning) and now it is even more outstanding.  People of all ages can enjoy this film because it's heartwarming with a touch of comedy that seeps into the heart of everyone.",1075680000,5,1390,4.810924369747899

Just heard Liz Taylor on Larry King state that she actually rode the horse in all the scenes, no stunt doubles.  She said, ""I had to do it, everyone was afraid of the horse, but me"". She was given the horse as a gift after the filming wrapped. Larry asked her ""which movie did you enjoy making the most?"".  She quickly replied, ""National Velvet, of course"".",1073174400,3,606,4.69811320754717
673819,4,630344394X,"It had been years since I'd watched National Velvet starring Elizabeth Taylor and Mickey Rooney, until picking up this DVD recently.  The film was as good as I remembered, if not more so now that I can view it with some measure of nostalgia for youthful innocence and the power of dreams.
As Velvet Brown, an 11-year-old Elizabeth Taylor glows on screen and brings to the role of a girl in love with horses all the wistfulness and energy that could be desired.  Mickey Rooney is also excellent as a young wandering man (Mi Taylor) whose tragic backstory eventually reveals itself in an emotional, if somewhat overwrought, scene between these two characters. The chemistry between Rooney and Taylor is unmistakable and gives weight to the trust and friendship that develops between Velvet and Mi. Although Velvet is too young to be concerned with boys in a romantic sense, the viewer gets the sense that these two are equals and truly respect each other. It's refreshing to see a friendship between a boy and girl portrayed so well.
This film succeeds in telling a heartwarming and life-affirming story of how a dream come true can change a life forever.  For Velvet's mother, it was swimming the English Channel as a young woman.  For her daughter, Velvet, it is winning a spirited horse, the Pie, and training him (with Mi's guidance) to race in the Grand National Steeplechase.  In fact, some of the film's most poignant and graceful scenes occur between Velvet and her mother, played by Anne Revere.  Mrs. Brown is a fount of wisdom for Velvet and shows great love and support for her daughter's dream by supplying the needed entry money for the horse race from her own winnings from her swim across the Channel years before.
This is a film to love for its many pleasures, such as a memorable cast (including a young Angela Lansbury as Velvet's older, boy-crazy sister), pastoral setting, and beautifully told story.  It's a true classic and not one to miss.  However, this DVD release is not quite worthy of the film.  It deserves a cleaner transfer.  One scene in particular is out of focus.  There are no extra features or commentary that would make viewing the film a richer experience.  But, for the price, it is worth picking up to watch for now, while we hope and wait for a better release someday.",1073001600,10,2308,4.728179551122195
673820,5,630344394X,"This is another of those classic horse movies that is STILL great today!  I have seen it a hundred times, and I still enjoy it just as much as the first time.  :)
The story is basically a poor, horse-crazy girl named Velvet Brown (Elizabeth Taylor) ends up with an unruly, but talented horse she calls The Pie.  He's known for jumping out of pastures and being a nuisance!  A young boy (Mickey Rooney) ends up staying with her family for awhile, to help out with the family business.  He happens to know about horses and helps Velvet train The Pie.  They end up entering the horse in the most prestigious steeplechase event in the world, the Grand National.  The rest I'll keep a secret!
The story is so heart warming and special... the characters are funny and sympathetic.  The acting is superb!  A very young Angela Landsbury has a part as Velvet's beautiful older sister!  And the race at the end is just brilliant - you really can't help but cheer The Pie on - to this day I find myself standing up and screaming along as he is leaping over those fences!
The movie followed the basic story of the book, but as with most movies they had to leave a lot out.  The book is a classic in its own right though, and well worth reading if you haven't already.  The story is so exciting and fun, its one I will never forget.  I highly recommend seeing this movie, even if you're not a horse fanatic. :)",1071100800,33,1397,4.326923076923077

It was a fun nostalgia trip but I think I have passed the age. I would rather read the book again. But if you like old movies with a family story line with good direction for kids, you can't go wrong.  There are probably households now that could watch the movie and see a family all eating together for the first time.  Maybe they might even try it once a week. That's a novel idea.",1517270400,,533,3.97196261682243
