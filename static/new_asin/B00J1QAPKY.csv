6308745,5,B00J1QAPKY,Great value with double feature of two great movies.,1482796800,,52,4.888888888888889
6308746,5,B00J1QAPKY,"I originally saw the ""Mask of Zorro"" in the theatre when it came out and had forgotten what a spectacular movie it was. Watching it again uncut on Blu-ray is the only way to enjoy this adventurous romp. The casting is perfect, the story is compelling, the action is phenomenal, and the performances from Sir Anthony Hopkins, Antonio Banderas and Catherine  Zeta Jones are among the best they have ever given. Heck, even the villains are so perfectly played to the point that you actually ""Love to hate them"" (ref: Eric Von Stroheim). This movie is simply the definition of fun, Fun, FUN

The second feature ""The Legend of Zorro"" is a decent enough movie and has some of its own great moments, I just suggest you not watch it immediately following the first one as it simply cannot compare to the wall-to-wall fun and sheer exhilaration of ""The Mask of Zorro"".",1480032000,,859,4.644736842105263
6308747,5,B00J1QAPKY,"Let's be honest. Anthony Hopkins is in the first movie, which makes it worth the watch. The movies are fun, exciting, entirely unhindered by the natural laws of physics, and quite worth a watch. I have had some problems in the past with the cheap double feature DVD collections not playing on my DVD player (it is getting old and won't read discs that have even small defects), but didn't have any problems with this one.",1479340800,2,421,4.552631578947368
6308748,5,B00J1QAPKY,Added to collection.,1476230400,,20,6.0
6308749,4,B00J1QAPKY,"Two great action movies, together in one package, and on Blu-Ray.  What more could you ask for?",1474502400,,95,4.588235294117647
6308750,5,B00J1QAPKY,These two films are awesome! Glad they put them on a double blu-ray. Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones sizzle together on the screen and do fantastic! The story of Don Diego De La Vega training his new man to become the Next Zorro is a story of love and sweet revenge. Beautifully scored by James Horner these are a winner!,1473811200,2,331,4.533333333333333
6308751,5,B00J1QAPKY,"These are some of the most delightful movies on earth. If you like swashbuckling stuff, this is for you. The second movie is my favorite in spite of some plot weaknesses because Antonio and Catherine are so hilarious when they're fighting. But the first movie has a spectacular dance scene, so maybe it evens out. Interesting villains appear in both movies--- the hillbilly gang leader in the second movie is a real creep. And if you want fencing matches, you're in for a treat.",1473724800,,478,4.7023809523809526
