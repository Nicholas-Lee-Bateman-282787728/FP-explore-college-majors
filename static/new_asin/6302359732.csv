7824666,5,6302359732,"I only have the figure skating part of this gift set, but I can tell you that just that tape alone is worth the cost of this set.  You get Paul Wylie's historic and inspiring short and long programs, and Kristi Yamaguchi's gold-medal winning performances, including her triple lutz/triple toe loop. There's also the mesmerizing free dance of Klimova and Ponomarenko, who skated to the gold in almost complete silence for the overwhelmingly French, pro-Duchenay crowd.  The price is worth it for these performances alone, but you also get Nancy Kerrigan's short, Viktor Petrenko's short and long programs, Midori Ito's long program, the Duchenay's free dance, and M&D's gold medal winning pairs free skate, and most of all, intelligent and very limited commentary from the best team in skating -- Verne Lundquist, Scott Hamilton, Tracy Wilson and Katarina Witt.
If you are a fan of any of the ""Class of 1992"" you NEED to get this video ASAP.",997228800,16,940,4.943037974683544
