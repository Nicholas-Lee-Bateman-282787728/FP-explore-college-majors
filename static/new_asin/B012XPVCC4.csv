8726718,2,B012XPVCC4,"Information wise, this is a good documentary. There's no question about that, but it's also incredibly boring. Unlike the many other high production documentaries that have come out of the BBC (Planet Earth, Human Earth, South Pacific, etc.) this one will put you to sleep like a melatonin shot. There's very little story telling or personification of the animals, the narration is flat and choppy. It sounds like a bored student reading facts from an encyclopedia. Cillian Murphy is a fantastic actor, but his soft, sleepy voice was not made to narrate something called ""the wildest"" of anything. I will say, though, that the photography is amazing. But, given level of photographic technology we have now, that's not really enough to float a documentary that isn't put together well and had a terribly boring script.",1496016000,,818,5.066666666666666
