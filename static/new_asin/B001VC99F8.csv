3820551,4,B001VC99F8,"Most murders are investigated and solved by local and state authorities, but in certain cases, the expertise and forensic knowledge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation provides invaluable support. That is the case in these four true-crime dramas, each one involving brutal murders, diabolical killers and relentless pursuit by the FBI. Special Agent and former Director in Charge of the FBI's New York Office James Kallstrom is your host, taking you behind the scenes of these brutal crimes and their ultimate solution with interviews, crime scene forensics and re-enactments of the actual crimes.

I like The FBI Files, I think it's a very interesting show. This set is a good idea, putting 4 episodes about a similar subject (Murder Cases) together on 2 discs. Each episode is 50 minutes long, and all four cases are very interesting. If you don't buy a lot of DVDs, or are not a huge fan of this show then I highly recommend this set. However if, like me, you are a real fan of the FBI Files then I suggest to keep your money and buy the full seasons, all four seasons are full of fascinating cases. In fact 3 of the 4 cases you'll find on this set are from Season 1, so I suggest you to buy the full season here on Amazon. :)

DISC 1
- The Murdering Cowboy (season 1)
Claude Davis was a loner who lived of the land, poaching wildlife and selling the hides. Confronted by two game wardens, he shot and killed them both, and was arrested and convicted. Dallas later escaped, making the FBI's Top Ten Wanted List, and leading the FBI on a year-long man-hunt.
- The Hunter's Game (season 2)
The capture of Alaska serial killer Robert Hansen. The serial killer's rampage was discovered when the bodies of several young women began turning up in shallow graves that dotted the Alaskan wilderness. The killer taunted his victims, hunting them like animals before shooting them down. His identity was elusive, until FBI agents 3000 miles away in Washington, D.C. began intensive profiling to narrow the search for him.

DISC 2
- Death in Alaska (season 1)
A young mother and her two young daughters were found brutally murdered and sexually assaulted in Anchorage, Alaska leaving little evidence for the investigators to go by. In a brilliant display of forensic methodology, the FBI used the only shred of evidence to shed light on the crime and its perpetrator. using hair and fiber technology, they were able to not only reconstruct the crime scene, but to arrest and convict the killer of the vicious crime.
- Human Prey (season 1)
Sometimes its pays to be lucky, but you're only lucky if you are good. A series of tips led the FBI to valuable clues in the case of Thomas Dillon, who killed five sportsmen over a period of three years in Southern Ohio. using these tips, ballistic testing and psychological profiling, the FBI launched a dramatic air and ground surveillance operation that netted the murderer.",1335398400,8,2912,4.728346456692913

8345972,5,B001VC99F8,"You know those people who you call aunt & uncle, but they are long time friends of you parents, well, mine lived in Washington DC & my aunt Florance told me where ever I wanted to go she would take me, (at the time I was only 10) I am now 62, so I wanted to go to their Wax Museum & it was filled only with history which made me very happy, then I wanted to go to the ""FBI Bldg"" but that was across town, not enough time.  Some years later I wrote to them asking if there were any books out on the FBI & I received a very nice letter back saying there were 2 books out which I ordered & read, ""Famous Cases"" & ""The History Of the FBI"". both very good.  Some years later, I started collecting movies & 2 of my favorite actors did moves on the FBI- James Cagney & Jimmy Stewart, both were always very good, 2 very different movies, both were good guys, then I saw that I could get it on Amazon, the actual cases, very interesting cases, In the words of the late Richard Proyer-""Thank God For Prisons"" where all the
""scumbags"" should be.
I enjoyed the DVD very much & to quote me-""Thank goodness for The FBI""
Again 100% satisfied customer
Thank you very much.
