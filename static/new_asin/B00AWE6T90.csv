5523083,4,B00AWE6T90,I enjoyed the third series ..... good to see Russell Crowe and other actors join the cast. Light-hearted and lots of fun.,1360195200,,121,4.545454545454546
5523084,1,B00AWE6T90,One of the most boring series I've ever purchased.  I didn't even bother watching the last 2 seasons.  All Doyle ever did  was answer his cell phone.,1427673600,,149,4.444444444444445

5523088,5,B00AWE6T90,"Jake Doyle and his mildly dysfunctional family are back with a bang in the third season of this Canadian detective show that reminds many of us of The Rockford Files. As Season Two ended Jake, who dances right on the edge of the law more times than not and occasionally falls into jail as a result, is offered a chance to rejoin the police force to help fight organized crime. He's unconventional enough to get the job done on the street but he's also causing headaches for his boss because, well, Jake has been known to throw a punch or two now and then and isn't always careful when it comes to respecting the civil rights of suspects. Suffice it to say that he doesn't last long on the force and before too long he and his dad are back to being private detectives.
This series features a guest appearance by Russel Crowe as well as some well-known Canadian stars and is notable for the fact that Jake's love interest - Sgt. Leslie Bennett - isn't real happy with him. At the end of Season Two she got fired from the police force and it was Jake's fault. In Season Three he does manage to get her job back - sort of. He tries to win her back but judging from the way the episodes in this year's installment play out, he might not be able to do that no matter how charming he is.
I'm not going to tell you much more because then you wouldn't have to watch the series and that would be a shame because it's really good television shot in an interesting locale.
I will throw out the these three little teasers, however: There are some really interesting twists in this season, including one that I never saw coming; some memorable characters from the first two seasons reappear to good effect and, just as Season Two did, Season Three ends on a really dramatic cliffhanger.",1415404800,4,1772,4.372727272727273

5523098,5,B00AWE6T90,"Republic of Doyle is one of the best television shows that have come out in the past few years.  It has everything I love in a story - fun characters, action and a storyline.  Allan Hawco and Sean McKinley are excellent in the roles of Jake and Malachy Doyle!  For eveyone who love detective shows (especially those from the 70s), will love this show!  Being from the US I am unable to watch this except on late night television on one of our independent tv stations.  Being able to find the complete seasons so that I can move ahead has made my day!",1406678400,,550,4.300970873786408
5523099,5,B00AWE6T90,"Another great season.  Jake Doyle is back for another hilarious and action-packed season, but this time he's a member of the Newfoundland Royal Constabulary.  Mal, Rose, And Des are back also.  While the three continue being private investigators, Jake is assigned to protect a mob informant turned federal witness.  Leslie is also back, but a relationship between Jake and Leslie is a long shot.",1406246400,,396,5.140625

5523101,4,B00AWE6T90,"I discovered Republic of Doyle by chance and I fell in love with the series right away. Funny, witty, great and loveable characters, great setting (beautiful St John's), good writing and story-telling. The third Series is definitely worth buying, although some of the episodes are a little too silly for my liking. Jake gets hit in the face or on the head so many times that it makes me wonder if he will suffer from brain-damage at the end of this season :-). The family chemistry is and will probably always be the biggest plus. And the relationship train-wrecks Jake keeps producing are very enjoyable.",1402790400,,605,4.771428571428571
5523102,5,B00AWE6T90,"this program has been showing up in reruns, in Los Angeles, late on Sat nights. Just had to see more of these, so ordered and am happy with product.

I just wish AMAZON would be as fast as they used to be on deliveries to me. Haven't upgraded on shipping, but still expect 4-5 days and not 10 !!!",1402531200,,296,4.016949152542373
5523103,5,B00AWE6T90,I love this show.  It is one of the shows I look forward to each and every year it comes out.  I found this show completely by accident (as it isn't shown on any station in my area) and am so glad I did.  I love the characters and the location.  I wish I could enjoy it weekly during its running season; but it is great to be able to see the entire season in a few days.,1383436800,3,370,3.7051282051282053
8558353,5,B00AWE6T90,Enjoyed this Canadian Series...Wanted more but was 6 seasons. Enjoyed the character and would watch the actor in other films and series. A+++,1501545600,,141,5.173913043478261
8558354,5,B00AWE6T90,I am not a TV reviewer and will never understand what TV critics likes and dislike about a show.  All I know is what I like and dislike and If I like a show I will watch it and I if I don't I'll find something else to watch.  In the case of Republic of Doyly anytime I find an episode still on the air I will watch it .  That having been said I have Season 1 through 3 of the series on DVD and will be purchasing more as time permits I think it was a good show when it aired on TV and enjoy watching the series on disc.. The three sets that I have are working very well and I have had no problems with the DVDs,1497830400,,610,3.6412213740458017
