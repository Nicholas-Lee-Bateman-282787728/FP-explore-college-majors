7156243,5,B00X3DC7KW,This series was produced by Warner Bros during the hay day of TV westerns.  This was the last season for this series and like other series produced by WB which also ran for four seasons they were all worth having in a DVD collection.  Ty Harding was a good choice for the lead role in this series.,1444953600,3,297,4.192982456140351

7156245,5,B00X3DC7KW,"BRONCO great classic t.v. series,  Another good box set from warner archive, and another missed opportunity. The first season of CHEYENNE is the only box set that has an interview with star Clint Walker. The MAVERICK, SUGARFOOT. and now BRONCO  have nothing  even though  Will Hutchins and Ty Hardin are still alive, as is Peter Brown of LAWMAN  but I don't expect an interview on that box set. As for MAVERICK  there must be some old interviews with Jim Garner and Jack Kelly.  Still, it's good to see these great stars in their heyday. Love them all",1442016000,,551,4.618556701030927

8714856,5,B00X3DC7KW,"Just to let every one know Ty passed away on 3rd august 2017 . Posting a picture of Ty with Clint walker at an event .

Don't agree with Paterson that Ty hardin had a lesser charisma than the sugar foot character . In fact he was the better actor between all three and that is why he had a better success in movies than will Hutchins. Ty could sing also pretty well and gave more flamboyance to the character than Clint who was more muscular and wooden than Ty . Ty was very very handsome and looked smart sitting on a horse . I remember when he came for the first time we were all critical of him replacing Clint but the fact was that he eventually succceeded because he had a certain likeable  charm . His horse riding was very very good and he could climb on the horse even when the horse was running ..",1491523200,2,806,4.094936708860759

8714859,4,B00X3DC7KW,"Although not quite up to the calibre of 'Cheyenne' and 'Sugarfoot', 'Bronco' was nevertheless a decent enough entry in the WB westerns of the time, and was an enjoyable outing for all those western fans, and there were many including me, of the day! Ty Hardin probably didn't quite have the charisma of Will Hutchins or Clint Walker, but was likable enough, and a good looking guy. Nice to have the shows available , and those who wish, can relive the 'Golden Days' of television, sadly, long gone!",1466899200,2,498,4.670454545454546
