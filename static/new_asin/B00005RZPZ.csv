1658599,5,B00005RZPZ,"I've been a fan of Gundam for over 15 years and this series by far is the best there is atm. With some of the best animation, designs of mobile suits and a intense story this is one that must be watched by all Gundam fans.
From the quality of the Wing DVDs, all I can expect that this DVD will be excellent.
Here's hope that ""Char's Counter-attack"" comes out soon as well!",1010966400,,372,4.109589041095891
1658600,5,B00005RZPZ,"Back in 1979, Mobile Suit Gundam first aired in Japan. Now over twenty years later, the Gundam Invasion has come to America. And it has landed with a resounding ""bang"".
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083; Stardust Memory is perhaps the strongest story arc in the Gundam U.C. universe. Set three years after the end of the One Year War (which was the setting for the original Gundam series) this thirteen episode series is finally coming to DVD.
The story centers on Ensign Kou Uraki, an Earth Federation mobile suit pilot who is forced to face his many fears and overcome seemingly impossible odds while coping with the many interpersonal relationships all against the backdrop of war. Although this is a very common theme in anime and throughout the Gundam saga, Stardust Memory keeps it fresh and invigorating. Never once do you feel that plot drags or that the characters are not believable.
Unlike many other anime titles we are allowed to see the enemys point of view. Uraki's nemesis, Zeon ace pilot Anavel Gato, is not portrayed as some inhuman monster, but as a dedicated man who just happens to fight for ""the enemy"". Gato is one of the more compelling characters in this series. He finds that he has more in common with Uraki than he first thought( at the risk of giving away a critical plot element I won't divulge what it is here, you'll have to watch to find out).
Technically the animation is superb. Although it was made over ten years ago, it really does not have a dated feel to it. The battle sequences are as intense I have seen ever in an animated feature. Some of the combat sequences rival those in many live action films. The only criticism would be that the action may be too intense for many younger viewers. But that's a parents call.
If you are going to own one Gundam saga on DVD, this definitely would be the one.
Note; This review is based upon the VHS version which I have owned for over two years. As of this writing the DVD has yet to be released. Any information on special features are not available to me at this time.",1010448000,2,2043,4.524324324324325
1658601,5,B00005RZPZ,"I own this on vhs, and I love it... it makes gundam wing look like a baby. There is alot of battles and the mobile suits are alot believeable, they don't fly around like toys, they move like they weigh what they do.  The main characters are very good, and the dub is perfect... there is a very complex story, and it just is great buy it, and you will understand why gundam is the best there is.",1009411200,2,394,4.051282051282051

7953095,5,B00005RZPZ,"My favorite Gundam story, by far. This is just not a good Gundam movie, this is a GREAT SCI FI movie as well. The characters were engaging, the story was well thought out and the voice acting is better than usual on dubbed anime. Even if you don't care for Gundam but enjoy Sci Fi, give this one a shot. Giant. Robots. Fighting. what more do you need??",1341705600,,352,4.1911764705882355
7953096,5,B00005RZPZ,"Gundam 0083 brings out the true essence of what gundam

is really made of. It is a great series and the DVD has

4 episodes so its pretty good.",1109808000,2,143,3.896551724137931
7953097,5,B00005RZPZ,"I saw all Gundam series and OAVs from the U.C., and I like them all. However, only the ""Gundam 0083"" meets all of my wishes that a science-fiction OAV must have: a lot of action since the beginning and a bit love between the main characters.
I underestimated this series before I've seen it, I didn't know too much about it, but as a Gundam fan as I am, I told myself that I had too see it too.
Before, I thought that ""Gundam 08th MS Team"" was the best OAV in the Gundam Universum, but I was wrong. Well, I like ""Gundam 08th MS Team"" a lot too, but if you ask me to choose, then Gundam 0083 is the 1st.
The music and songs are also very good. I will look to get the CDs somewhere. The Gundam Enyclopedia is also well done and a MUST READ for the real Gundam fan. All espisodes are so ""dynamic"" that you will look 3-4 episodes at time: you will tell yourself ""I MUST KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT!"".
If you are an ""Action-guy"" like me, then BUY ""GUNDAM 0083"", you can trust me. Have fun!
Oh yes, I LOVE NINA PURPLETON TOO  :-)",1065744000,,1018,4.03960396039604
7953098,5,B00005RZPZ,this one of the best gundam dvds out get 0083 not 0080 .,1047600000,,56,3.3846153846153846
7953099,5,B00005RZPZ,"After the success of the short coming Gundam 0080, Sunrise was ready to go to the next level by filling in some of the gaps in the Universal Century. Gundam 0083 became one of the hottest OAVs ever featuring new characters, mecha and battleships, making it an unbeatable successor to Gundam 0080.
The story takes off in the year 0083 (obviously) when the Federation now owns Zakus and are very easy-going on security. The legendary Anavel Gato, also known as the Nightmare of Solomon, sneaks in and captures a Gundam. But rookie ensign Kou Uraki plans to retrieve it at all costs and prevents the rebirth of Zeon.
Episode 1 (B-): Gato steals a Gundam from a Federation base.
Episode 2 (A): Kou, Kieth, Burning and Allen go after the GPO-2 to retrieve it.
Episode 3 (B-): Kou agrees to fight that will decide who pilots the Gundam.
Episode 4 (A+): The Albion crew must fight to stop the GPO-2 from launching in Africa.
The animation is extremely good for a series coming out right at the beginning of the ""anime cash crunch period"". All the mobile suits are very vivid and fluent in movement. Plus, the character designs are all extremely well drawn and suit the series very well. The dub cast does an okay job, but sometimes their voices are a tad off with the lip movements. The music does an excellent job portraying the mood of this show and almost reminds me of the music from Char's Counterattack.
The extras on this disc are pretty much what you expect from Bandai now. The textless opening\closings are pretty nice and the MS Encyclopedia is always a welcome companion in Gundam series.
Overall, Gundam 0083 is a series that will appeal to all fans of Gundam, new or old.",1032307200,,1678,4.596666666666667
7953100,5,B00005RZPZ,"I am a huge fan of the Gundam universe. StarDust Memeories caught my attention on Adult Swim. It's supposed to be (to my knowledge) a prequel of some sorts, to the fan favorite, Z Gundam. The animation is pretty good for the 1980s. The battles are spectacular. The characters aren't that cool, but they grow on you. Quit watching Gundam Wing and start watching the Universal Century series. Also, G Gundam isn't bad either.",1019606400,,423,4.72972972972973
7953101,5,B00005RZPZ,"Being more of a fan of romantic comedies or epic fantasies in anime than mech-heavy space operas, I've found it very hard to get really interested in the Gundam universe - in spite of the vastness of the franchise and the scope of the story that is told.  That said, though, I have found the first disc of Gundam 0083 to be surprisingly enjoyable - and easy to get into.
The story is a surprisingly compelling one - in bringing a pair of prototype mechanized giant armors - Gundams - to a test base in Australia, the crew of the Albion finds one of their nuclear-equipped Gundams hijacked right from under their noses by the remnant of the rogue government that Earth defeated just four years before.  Pursuing this stolen Gundam across Australia and Africa, this crew has to desperately try to stop Zeon - the rogue government - from using this Gundam as the lynchpin in rebuilding their forces.
Two things really struck me about this series.  One was that it was really more about the interpersonal relationships between the characters than about the Gundams (although there's lots of tech and battle sequences for the die-hard Gundam fans as well).  The other was that it's quite beautifully animated.  The colors are surprisingly vibrant and the animation quality is impressively good for a series that dates to the late 80s/early 90s.
The video and audio quality seem quite good - at least to my rather archaic television.  The extras were quite nice as well: the usual textless opening and ending as well as a miniatue Gundam encyclopedia full of Gundam and vehicle stats and - something especially useful for me and any others new to the series - a timeline in the DVD insert.
While this disc hasn't sold me on the entire Gundam franchise, it has sold me on the rest of this series.  It balances action, romance, angst and fear in a very well-realized world.  I recommend it as much for the anime fan not familiar with (or traditionally not interested in) Gundam as the die-hard fan.  I will be awaiting the rest of this series with interest",1011484800,18,2048,4.666666666666667
