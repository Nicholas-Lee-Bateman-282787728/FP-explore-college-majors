8187074,5,B000OX1T9Y,Great alternative to the traditional wing chun set. Simone adds many different elements to the set and explains them in detail.,1478044800,,127,5.095238095238095
8187075,5,B000OX1T9Y,I haven't gone through the whole set yet but he is very detailed and knowledgeable and I was able to use this with my attachmate (though I couldn't hit my bag as hard as he hits his wooden dummy...,1429056000,,197,4.076923076923077
8187076,5,B000OX1T9Y,"I bought this on VHS back in 2000 when it first came out.  I thought it was great then and it still is. Mr Simonet breaks everything down so that it is easily understood and shows the application of the techniques. I've been a JKD Instructor for 18 years and to my knowledge his is the only dummy set that combines JKD, Kali, Silat, Muay Thai, Kenpo, and Wing Chin. I also like his no nonsense in your face method of teaching.  Rock on!",1387497600,,436,4.178571428571429
8187077,5,B000OX1T9Y,"I bought this years ago on VHS - shortly after it was released; maybe 1999 or 2000? I practiced on trees and door frames and basketball posts until I could afford a dummy. I have subsequently purchased just about every video that he has done.  They are ALL well produced and full of information.  So, about the title of this review. Do Not Be Deceived - do not be deceived into thinking that you're going to learn a traditional or slightly modified Wing Chun mook jong set and maybe some applications! You ARE going to learn a set and some applications, but also an almost complete fighting system with applications and drills.  (You may want to purchase his ""Six Seconds.."" DVD for  information on making your OWN mini-fighting system !) Additionally, Sifu Simonet is very entertaining!",1303430400,6,787,4.764705882352941
8187078,5,B000OX1T9Y,"When I bought this DVD set I was under the impression that I was going to get a warmed-over Wing Chun routine with a few new moves.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Mr. Simonet uses a myriad of different styles, and incorporates techniques from each.  He also does a very good job of explaining his theory behind his use of the movements, and the full set is broken down into several subsets that are fully explained and relatively easy to follow.  This results in a DVD set that is FULL of information, and a striking dummy routine that flows well and provides multiple options for use in real-world encounters.  The ingraining of these options by repetition and understanding is the point of the whole thing, and I believe Mr. Simonet makes that point very well.
  I found myself rewinding and watching sections of the DVDs over and over again, as there was just so much information to be gleaned from each subset. I do not claim to be an expert but I've studied martial arts off and on for most of my adult life, and I learned a lot from these DVD's.",1292716800,6,1063,4.448453608247423
