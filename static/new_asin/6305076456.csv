966013,3,6305076456,"It was funny to a point, but began to get repetitive about half-way through the movie.  This story might have been better as a half hour episode as opposed to an hour and a half movie.  The sense of ""vacation"" was lacking in that there was minimal travel up until they get to their destination.  The movie might have been better served with scenes of the country attractions, sight-seeing, etc.

This movie has been difficult to find and this may be why.",1498867200,,454,4.5

Instead, there was a great deal of the same sort of material that had been used in Grace Brothers told in a more graphic way (""Oh boy! We're a film now & can say anything we want!"").  By the time they'd set up all the preliminary explanations, rehashing the same lines, the film was almost over & they had to rush it through with a very disappointing ending that really didn't feel much like an ending at all.

966234,3,6305076456,I don't regret renting it but unfortunately a lot of the movie was a direct rip-off of skits from the original show and the didn't have the same charm as they did the first time. They seem forced. I was a little disappointed.,1466899200,2,225,4.255813953488372
966235,1,6305076456,"First off let me say I am a huge fan of ""Are You Being Served"" the TV show. I own both the original and ""Are You Being Served, Again"" DVDs of the TV shows. I purchased this hoping to see some new capers involving the hilarious characters of Grace Brothers. Right from the start I started hearing jokes from the show. So much so that being a serious fan of the show I knew the punchlines before the line was finished. The timing seemed off as the TV show had pauses for the laugh lines in the jokes. Since you don't need pauses for laughter in a non live movie, the next line sometimes ran over where you would be laughing. If you are new to ""Are You Being Served"" you might enjoy this, but I recommend the original TV show as it seems to have more punch as a ""live"" show with an audience.",1464393600,3,788,4.090322580645161

That makes the jokes wear thin, in my opinion, and makes the movie a bit of a bore. I don't think the movie did too well when released in the theaters, partly due to the jokes, some of which were used in the series all ready. It does make for a fun watch from time to time.

967160,3,6305076456,"The idea of taking a popular/beloved TV series and making it into a movie is very tempting.  There are opportunities to flesh out characters and put them into situations they may not encounter on the small screen.  Unfortunately, that is not what happened with the characters of ""Are You Being Served?"", the hit 1970s British ensemble farce comedy.
The staff of Grace Brothers Department store are taking advantage of a company funded vacation in sunny paradise Costa Plonka run by Don Carlos (Andrew Sacs).  Fans of British comedy will get a huge kick from the fact that the man who plays poor Manuel of ""Fawlty Towers"" is the one running a hotel in the ""Are You Being Served?"" universe.  So this means Mrs. Slocombe needs a passport photo and vaccinations in one of the few funny gags in this romp, Mr. Lucas naturally is doing everything he can to get laid by a nice bit of Spanish crumpet (or Miss Brahms), and the entire ensemble are caught up in an attempted revolution that involves a doctored photo of Mrs. Slocomb's bosom, Mr. Humphries in drag, and Young Mr. Grace in a tank... business as usual to the staff of Grace Brothers!
Despite the fact that we finally see the staff outside of that prison-like store, and the undertones of impending revolution, this is only a very tame, even floppy movie.  The only thing this movie succeeds in is demonstrating all the things that can go wrong in the transition from TV to movie.  The cast who are so funny on TV don't quite hit the right marks on the big screen.  Mostly because these are actors trained to pitch their lines that make a studio audience laugh.  The most unforgivable slight is the repetition of gags and plots from the show's more memorable episodes.  Taking the measurements of an Arab sheikh was done in the episode ""Fire Practice"", and the slightly bigger gag of the ""meet me for sexy sex note landing in the wrong hands"" was done in the second ever episode ""Dear Sexy Knickers..."" only this time with a bigger circle of recipients.
It's great to see beloved TV characters on a bigger screen, outside their usual digs, but maybe, in the case of ""Are You Being Served?"", they belong on the small screen... because that is where they deliver the best of their talents.",1407542400,,2240,4.6221662468513856

967308,3,6305076456,"ARE YOU BEING SERVED? was a popular BBC television comedy series that mixed broad farce and double entendre in its on-going depiction of employees at a large London department store.  The original series ran from 1972 to 1985 and ultimately became very popular in the United States through PBS broadcasts.  Although the cast changed from time to time, the ""classic"" line-up featured Ladies Wear sales clerks Mrs. Slocombe (Mollie Sugden) and Miss Brahams (Wendy Richard); Men's Wear sales clerks Mr. Grainger (Arthur Bough), Mr. Humphries (John Inman), and Mr. Lucas (Trevor Bannister.)  Management was represented by floor supervisor Capt. Peacock (Frank Thornton), manager Mr. Rumbold (Nicholas Smith), and store owner ""young"" Mr. Grace (Harold Bennett.)  Maintenance was embodied by Mr. Harmon (Arthur English.)  Each episode found the characters in unexpectedly bizarre situations that arose from everything from cold weather to stuck elevators to a general strike, often with doing battle with difficult customers, and always doing battle with each other.

Apparently it is not unusual for a BBC series to be adapted into a feature film during the series run, and it is this particular cast the 1977 feature film uses.  The movie finds Grace Brothers closing for major renovations--and the department staff taking a group vacation for the two weeks the renovations will require.  They go to the fictional Costa Plonka, only to find that the hotel does not have rooms for them.  They are assigned to separate tents as a temporary measure--and Mr. Lucas writes a sexy note to Miss Brahams that goes astray, falling into the hands of Mrs. Slocombe, who assumes the note has been sent to her by Captain Peacock.  Confusion reigns as various characters chase each other in and out of tents through the night, and then overflows when a revolution breaks out the next morning, leaving everyone stranded and in fear for their lives.  But this is ARE YOU BEING SERVED? so we know everything will turn out all right in the end.

Someone who hasn't seen the series is unlikely to enjoy the movie, which relies heavily on prior knowledge; at the same time, quite a few people who have seen the series seem to dislike the film as unoriginal and lacking the fun of the original.  I have to say that over all I found it very small beer--but there are worse ways to spend an hour an half.  Series fans who don't expect too much will likely enjoy it.

GFT, Amazon Reviewer",1404432000,,2460,4.936893203883495
967309,5,6305076456,"I watched this movie after a marathon binge of all 10 series of AYBS and the 2 series of ""Grace and Favour."" In that context I absolutely loved it! It was wonderful seeing the original cast together on the big screen. I quite enjoyed the different yet 'larger' feel of the store set. I also felt that most of the store scenes kept the continuity of the show nicely.

I was a bit less pleased, in terms of continuity, with the actual holiday scenes. As has oft been pointed out many of the jokes and material are recycled. However, The ""Dear Sexy Knickers"" scene was, in my opinion, quite a bit BETTER than the original TV episode routine, precisely because it did last longer and take the joke further with the follow up, ""Dear Sexy Y-Fronts.""

The amorous tent-hopping scene was quite amusing, although I couldn't help but be reminded of the better and much funnier room-hopping scene in the season 5 episode of Frasier, ""The Ski Lodge."" I feel like that scene could have delivered a bit better. I was also put off by the terrible special effect caterpillar they used in the tent scenes.

I agree with the comments that Mr. Humphries seemed quite a bit ""gayer"" in the movie compared to the series, which I neither took as positive or a negative, just an interesting thing to note. On the plus side some of the humour was a bit more explicit and pushed the envelop further, often delivering, but on the downside a lot of the original humour associated with the character was in his ambiguity, and he was just a lot less ambiguous in the movie.

I also agree with the comments about the laugh track/audience being sorely missed. I also quite missed the cash register sounds between scenes, and yes the lack of these familiar, beloved sounds and effects did make the pacing and jokes feel just a bit off.

I thoroughly enjoyed the plotline involving Mrs. Slocombe using a fake photo of her head on someone else's body and all the missassumptions it caused. That was a new, fresh device for the show and in my opinion they got a great deal of positive mileage out of it. I think it should also be noted that back in that era, despite the jokes to the contrary, Mollie Sugden really did still have a nice figure.

My biggest complaint of the movie was the entire revolution plot, which just seemed over-the-top and not especially amusing, and worse the attempts at Spanish/cultural comedy. The latter is certainly no deviation from the show, however. Throughout its run AYBS attempted to poke fun at many foreign cultures: Japanese, Germans, Italians, Greeks, Mongolians (Grace and Favor), Arabs, and I'm sure many others I'm forgetting. They were all awful and almost painful to watch with the exaggerated stereotyping, tacky attempts to 'speak the language' by adding or dropping a few letters of otherwise standard English words, and generally conveying the attitude that foreigners are to be mocked. I could have done without them adding the Spanish to the list in this movie. The only exceptions, in my personal estimation, were the frequent lampooning of the Americans, Irish, Welsh, and Scottish throughout the original series - that didn't strike me as offensive at all, just lighthearted teasing. I imagine in large part because there was no need (excuse?) to do the terrible mock language jokes.

Anyway, all in all I did thoroughly enjoy this movie. It was great in the larger context of the series and a must see for any AYBS fan. Although I can't imagine a non-AYBS fan particularly enjoying it. It doesn't stand alone, but it's a nice companion piece.",1404345600,5,3561,4.715434083601286

967769,2,6305076456,"As is usually the case when one attempts to transfer successful television shows to movies, the formula fell apart and the magic that made the TV show so enjoyable did not translate to the big screen.  It might have had a chance if the writers had come up with some new material.  Unfortunately, the film is replete with jokes and other bits that were recycled from the TV show and just fell flat in the movie.  As a fan of Are You Being Served, I'm glad that I was able to see the movie, but unfortunately, it just doesn't measure up when compared to the television show.

Now about the DVD itself.  Despite the fact that the label lists the film as 16x9 widescreen format, the film is not presented in true widescreen format.  If anything, I would call it a pseudo-widescreen format.  What the manufacturer did was take a standard definition copy of the film and convert it to widescreen format by zooming in on the image effectively cutting off the top and bottom parts of the frame.  Many people don't mind that, but I guess I'm more of a videophile than most because I can't stand to watch video that is not presented in the correct aspect ratio.  I ended up giving up on the DVD after about 15-20 minutes and purchased a VHS copy of the film so that I could enjoy it in full standard definition format without losing half the picture.

There may or may not be a true 16x9 version of this film available somewhere, but this is definitely not it.",1371686400,5,1450,4.397003745318352

Some of the jokes are recycled from the series, and others are humorous new additions to the series' repertoire, though the lack of a live audience affects both the timing of the performance and the overall atmosphere of the film.  The quality of the film on the DVD is excellent, though the disc is, disappointingly, lacking in special features; the only feature included is the original theatrical trailer shown to British cinema audiences (though in obviously worn and deteriorated quality).

968232,3,6305076456,"""Are you being Served-The Movie""(released 1977),should be more like ""Are you being Served-On Holidays"",for that is what this film adaption of the very popular BBC TV show is all about. All your favourite actors/characters are here:Mollie Sugden as Mrs. Slocombe,Frank Thornton as Captain Peacock,Nicholas Smith as Mr. Rumbold,Arthur Brough as Mr. Grainger,Trevor Bannister as Mr. Lucas,Wendy Richard as Ms. Brahms,Arthur English as Mr. Harman,Harold Bennett as young Mr. Grace and everyone's fave of the show John Inman as Mr. Humphries. It is a delight to revisit this movie once more but unfortunately,or fortunately depending on your perspective,it hasn't gotten better with age,nor worse. It takes a good half hour or more for the movie to start getting the same spark in it that made the TV show such a huge success,and by the time it does the film is about over. The actors' lines are more drawn out as are their facial expressions and demeanour. The producers seemed to think the slower pace would be a nice change of pace for the fans(as the TV show only had 30 minutes in which to do its business) but it just ends up slowing the proceedings and taking away the punch of most of the humour that we are used to.
The story begins at the Grace Brothers department store as we are intro'd to the cast there. The writers decided to throw in part of a routine already used from the TV show as a rich Sheik comes in wanting to buy some trousers. Mr. Humphries and Mr. Lucas are called upon to do the ""dirty"" work but it lacks the same punch as the show. As the plot moves forward it seems the staff are going on a free trip to the Spanish town of Costa Plonka,due to much needed renovations at the store. They arrive and the manager is none other than Andrew Sachs fresh from his Fawlty Towers role as Manuel;here he plays one Don Bernardo. The reservations are of course wonky and the group have to sleep in tents until their proper rooms become available the next day. Here the writers also use another gag from the TV show with a note intended for one person getting passed to the wrong one. It starts with Mr Lucas' amorous writing to Ms. Brahms and it escalates from there. Eventually a number of the cast are playing musical tents.
Meanwhile the managers brother is a rebel and he intends to launch his ""war"" that very evening from the resort. When he does the battle is short as he is outgunned by the Government forces. The cast is diving for cover all over and who should pull up in a tank but young Mr Grace who is using the safest mode of transport at his disposal top get to HIS resort. Of course as he leaves he uses his famous last words""You've all done very well"".
There are some funny bits in this film ,the already mentioned tent mix up for one,but also a gag with the loo where one has to sing to let folks know you're using it because there are no door handles. Mr. Humphries as always comes through with his usual aplomb in the dressing department. And it is in this film that if you didn't know which side of the ""fence"" Mr Humphries was on before,you will know now. Mr. Grainger,Mr. Rumbold and Mr. Harmon are used most infrequently and then only as counterpoints. Mr. Harman's usual adolescent sarcasm on TV comes off more haughty and with a distinct bite here.
Technically the movie is in its original widescreen ratio and has been transferred pretty well. There are no extras and the sound is in Dolby 2 only.
All in all a recommended release for all AYBS fans and compleatists. The film doesn't have the same overall punch as the TV show but it is still a delight to see them all together again.",1310601600,,3623,4.499241274658574

This disc had the following episodes:  ""The Junior,"", ""Strong Stuff This Insurance,"" ""The Apartment,"", ""Mrs. Slocombe, Senior Person,"" ""The Hero"" and ""Anything You Can Do.""

As has been stated previously, there really isn't a lot of new material here: it's truly a stitching together of a new script from patches of dialogue from the series.  So if you think you've heard the joke before, you have.

However, that being said, many people can't afford the price of the series (although thankfully, I noticed that it's been on sale for half of the original asking price).  If for some reason, you love AYBS but can't fork out the money for the series, this isn't a bad way to get a taste of it.  That's what I did, and although I hardly ever watch this movie anymore (I'd much rather pop in one from the TV series), it can satisfy your AYBS cravings temporarily.",1297296000,,796,4.344594594594595

The actors and actresses are just as good and just as hilarious even while reusing some of the same gags as the series.

If you are already a fan of AYBS, this movie is well worth it.  If you are a newcomer to the show, I would suggest watching the series in its entirety first, then watch this movie, else you might miss some of the finer points and subtlty of it.

I grew up watching sitcoms like Full House, The Cosby Show, Saved By The Bell, The Wonder Years, and Three's Company. Not until just this year have I even seen a BBC sitcom. I have always totally adored British accents and loved the way the British talk and have always found England to be so much better than the U.S. as far as artistic architecture and the way they design the interior of buildings just from what I've seen and read. But I never knew how the British sitcoms were until just a few months ago.

I was at a friends' house and we were watching these British sitcoms and Are You Being Served? came on and it was so funny when I saw Mrs. Slocombe staying in this ""apartment"" in the department store and she was going to be with Mr. Humphries after the lights went out and people kept coming in her ""apartment"" and 2 of the guys had to stay in one bed and I was just totally cracking up!!  Then the very last thing Mrs. Slocombe says before the credits that I'll never forget, ""Mr. Humphries, Leave My P***y Alone!""  I was just totally rolling on the floor after that.  I HAD to buy that episode on DVD and I just got Vol 9 last week and I just totally love this show!!  Mr. Humphries and Mrs. Slocombe are just amazing and hilarious!!  Since I've seen this episode which is called The Apartment, I have watched many other episodes on PBS and I crack up everytime!!  I do plan to own every episode on DVD one day!

Another favorite that I also started watching is Keeping Up Appearances and I really wish that was still showing as well. And for years I've heard of Judi Dench and just recently started watching As Time Goes By as well. Judi Dench is also amazing. I really love these British sitcoms so much especially Keeping Up Appearances and Are You Being Served? and now all I can do is watch the DVD's or see re-runs on PBS. I really do wish that they would return Are You Being Served? because in my opinion, it beats any American sitcom any day!! I didn't realize what I've been missing all these 26 years of living, living in the U.S. but now that I've discovered the British way of sitcoms, I'll never turn back!!!",1120608000,9,2210,4.2829736211031175

Of the DVDs in the Season 6-10 boxed set of the AYBS? series, volume 9 is the best.  It contains six episodes--and all six are winners.  In The Junior,  the staff must choose an applicant to fill the space left by Mr. Tebbs' retirement (at first, a junior position as Mr. Humphries and Mr. Lucas were to be promoted).  The funniest part of this episode is when one of the applicants bears a little too strong a resemblance to Mr. Humphries who remarks ""We don't want people like that working here.""  In this episode,  Alfie Bass as Mr. Goldberg is introduced.  Of the three characters who tried to replace Mr. Grainger as the senior salesman, Goldberg was the only one that worked.  Mr. Tebbs seemed like a cheap imitation of Grainger and Mr. Klein was so unmemorable, you almost forget he was there.  Goldberg, however, provided a spark and, right away, gets ""up the nose"" of Col. (oops, Capt.) Peacock with memories of their army days.
In Strong Stuff This Insurance, the staff must undergo medical exams for a pension bonus plan.  The guys get caught with their pants (and everything else) down and the staff mistake Mr. Harmon's reading of appraisals of Young Mr. Grace's antique furniture for their medical reports.  In The Apartment, Mrs. Slocombe finds squatters in her new house and must spend the night in the store.  Due to a transport strike, she gets many visitors, including Mr. Humphries who she tries to put the moves on!  Mrs. Slocombe takes over Mr. Rumbold's position in Mrs. Slocombe, Senior Person (the temporary promotion does not go to her head as much as it did Mr. Grainger, when he once got the position).  In The Hero, the staff (and the store) find out Capt. Peacock has a boil on his ""bum.""  They try not to be ""cheeky"" about it but, when word spreads, Peacock finds himself scheduled to box Mr. Franco in sports who first revealed the ""misfortune""  (played by wrestler Jackie ""Mr. TV"" Pallo).  Finally, the staff takes over the canteen for a day in Anything You Can Do and, for once, seem to work well together.

968550,5,6305076456,"This series ran and re-ran on public television interminably, and I always loved it.  There must have been hundreds of episodes, and I think I saw each a couple of dozen times. I never tired of them.  This set includes some of the best of them, and I guarantee that they will give great pleasure and endless laughs.

Anyone who loves British humor will love this series.  If you have not seen them, I envy you because it is still in front of you.

968551,5,6305076456,"Are you being served? is the best brit-com ever! I already have all the episodes on tape at home and I would suggest this giftset to everybody! I have never found a show this hilarious, one great joke follows another, the characters are amazing each in their own little way, I just can't imagine someone who wouldn't laugh watching these episodes! My friends all thought I was old-fashioned for loving this show so much, I asked them to watch it a couple of times with me and now they like it! Of course it's very british, and that's what I like about it. Here in Canada it plays everyday on tv, but for those of you who can't watch it, buy this set and you won't regret it!!",1023235200,,675,4.28125
968552,5,6305076456,"Anyone looking for 21 of the funniest episodes of this series will be very pleased.  All of the shows you remember are here, including ""Dear Sexy Knickers"", ""German Week"" and ""The Erotic Dreams of Mrs. Slocombe"" plus many more that I'm sure true fans will cherish.  I'm a huge Brit-com fan and I had to have this show in my collection.  If you're a fan also please buy this set for your collection too.  Someone mentioned in their review that the ""Best of"" video, which is included here, isn't as funny when scenes are viewed out of context but if you're familiar with the series, you'll completely remember each scene shown!",1022803200,6,625,4.603603603603603
968553,1,6305076456,"Again, do not buy this box set if you think you will get all the ""Served""'s.  I love ""Served"" - I still watch the episodes when they come on TV!  Some I have recorded and I watch them when I can; I still love the ""ignamonious"" and cat and ""board room level"" (look up) jokes (my son loves it when Mr. W.C. Humphries answers the phone in a deep voice by saying, ""Men's ware.""  BUT, I don't have all the episodes, so I thought I would ask for this box set for my birthday, thinking I would complete my own collection.  WRONG!  Each video, 7 in the collection, only covers three episodes each.  The eighth video covers more episodes but only in snippets.  That's it!  Bogus buy!  Better for you to watch your PBS station and wait for the episodes to come on than to waste your money buying only a few episodes.  Or better still, go to the DVD section and consider buying all the episodes at a larger price (if you loved the ""Served's,"" it's worth the price).",1018310400,11,954,4.25
968554,5,6305076456,"And I must say I definitely fancy this box set of ""Are you being served"".  I have been a devotee of the show for many years after seeing it for the first time on PBS in America.  This box set puts some of the best episodes together for over 11 hours worth of side-splitting laughter.  If you're a fan of other British comedies such as ""Keeping up Appearances"" or even ""Absolutely Fabulous"" (you can even see a younger Joanna Lumley in a couple of episodes) then this is a must.  And even if you are usually not so inclined to watch such a show, I still suggest checking this series out.  From Ms. Solcombe (Mollie Sugden) and her poor pussycat and double entendres to Mr. Humphries (John Inman) and his ambiguous sexuality, you will thoroughly enjoy every moment of this great ensemble.  All the action takes place in the Grace Brothers Department Store, think of an upper scale department store staffed by middle class attitude, and you get the idea.  Insults, attitude, hair color, inside legs, and Ms. Solcombe's underwear are but few of the jokes that occupy these episodes.  Sit back, relax, have an ale or hotpot, and be prepared to be served up a hearty chuckle.  And remember to drop a sardine on the mat if you really enjoy the show!!",1011139200,3,1243,4.538116591928251
968555,5,6305076456,"This is a wonderful series that still has me in fits of hysterics whenever I watch it. How fabulous then that there is now a compilation of videos available to buy for us die-hard fans.

Who can forget Mollie Sugden as Mrs. Slocombe, a member of the blue rinse brigade always talking about her cat but in the most inappropriate way and doing her best to show everyone how well bred she is. She is also a frustrated spinster and one of the best episodes is when she pretends to loose her memory and then proceeds to chase after Captain Peacock, she being resplendent in a little girl's outfit, looking something off the top of a Scarecrow's Christmas tree.

Then there is the talented actor John Inman as Mr. Humphries, is he gay, or is he not? You're never quite sure, though surely he must be but then there is the episode where he drags Miss Brahms under the seats in the opera house, after she keeps tickling his hand and making him feel very frisky. Frank Thornton as Captain Stephen Peacock is a delight, absolutely stuffy, totally English and in reality never a Captain, he was actually a Corporal in the Food Corp during the war as one episode of the series tells us.

Wendy Richard is a delicious delight as the young Miss Shirley Brahms, uneducated, coarse, and as brassy as they come, her best scenes are when she spars with the cast of young men that appear throughout the series.

Nicholas Smith as the lower management icon Mr. Cuthbert Rumbold shows us his colors when he is talking to the wonderfully lecherous Young Mr. Grace, played to perfection by the actor Harold Bennett, owner of the department store Grace Brothers. This is an absolute gem of a comedy series, stuffed full of English irreverence to authority, management of all levels and the British class system in general.

It is a comedy that will leave you crying with laugher as the jokes and innuendo flies thick and fast through every episode. Look out for the Japanese Tourist episode, the Cafeteria episode and the camping out in the shop because it's snowing a storm outside episode, they are the creme del la creme in hilarity.

This won't be the cheapest purchase you ever make, but it will be worth every single cent, just remember this, you can break ribs laughing (I should know) so watch it in stages, it can be seriously BAD for your health!",1006387200,8,2332,4.580335731414868
968556,5,6305076456,"What do you get when you get a pink haired lady who makes her own marmalade, a fun-loving ambigious man, a cocky former ""captain"" and the high jinks of a young stud who is in love with revelry? You get ""Are You Being Served?"" the wonderful collection of PRIME English comedy. It's subtle. It's terrificly witty. It's just so darn funny. Set in the 70's and 80's we follow the life and times of the gang in menswear and ""womens apparel"" at Grace Brothers. It's tradition vs. modernism. It's the ""old school"" vs. the young brash. I love Mr. Humphries! I adore Mrs. Slocumb. Watch this vintage show. They sure don't make comedies like this any more.  Lucky we have them on tape.",1000425600,5,675,4.487804878048781
