6356686,5,B00JFVORXQ,"Not sure why he'd suggest only watching Long Way Down/Round or that this film gives AV riders a bad name.  Thats ridiculous and makes no since.  Im 49yrs old and have been an AV rider for many of those years.  I think we all enjoyed McGregor and Boorman's film.  And likely, Tiernan and Matt were partially inspired by those films.

But this film, for me, caught the true spirit of an adventure ride, as good if not better than any that I've seen.  Watching two friends set out on a hair brained adventure with little prior experience is always good fun. For those of us that have been down that road,  this film will put a smile on your face, for sure and make you want to head out on another.  Ride Report hit on so many of the reasons, I go on these trips.  The unknown, the unexpected, new friends, riding with an old friend or two, new places, cultures, fears and rarely thinking about anything other than the journey.

The LWD/R films were shot on big budgets with chase crews following Boorman and McGregor through a highly planned journey with the most expensive gear money can buy.  In my opinion, that takes most of the true adventure right out of the trip.  And I don't doubt they would tell you the same.

No high budget film crew here.  These guys did it all themselves, another huge accomplishment.  Capturing the essence of a trip like this is extremely difficult to do.  I've tried on my last 4 trips and it never works out.

Kudos to the two of you, Tiernan and Matt.  That was an experience nobody can discredit and it was a lot of fun to watch.  There's no doubt in my mind you two will head out on another.  Adventure is a virus!  Hope you'll film the next!",1405900800,5,1677,4.327974276527331
6356687,5,B00JFVORXQ,"The movie is about two guys who aren't experienced riders going on the trip of a lifetime.  Along the way there's scenic roads, remote villages, border crossings, bungee jumping, ziplines, river crossings, mechanical failures, language barriers, and all the local people along the way that reaffirm our faith in humanity.",1405900800,2,321,5.42
6356688,1,B00JFVORXQ,This video was more about meeting girls and getting drunk at bars than actually riding. Skip this and watch Long Way Around & Down for the tenth time. I usually like any documentary with adventure bikes...but the two in this show give us all bad press.,1405641600,,252,4.5
6356689,5,B00JFVORXQ,I loved this film! An inspiring story (and brilliant cinematography) that manages to capture the essence of what adventure riding is all about.,1426809600,,143,5.260869565217392
6356690,3,B00JFVORXQ,Not bad at all but it needs something.,1422144000,,38,3.875
6356691,5,B00JFVORXQ,Really intriguing documentary about 2 guys on motorcycles who ride across South America. Well shot. Great story. Highly recommend.,1419033600,,130,5.894736842105263
6356692,2,B00JFVORXQ,"Started off great, soon after came lots of footage of them encountering issues in Central America and lots of talking. Although, at this point, the film was still interesting.

HOWEVER, big turning point for me and such disappointment when they chose to skip half of South America and fly from Panama to Chile. I am from Colombia and the reason I watched the film was because I have always been interested in the road trip from Colombia to Brazil.

Even one of the guys when arriving at Brazil stated he felt somewhat disappointed in the trip so far. He felt as if he had not had such an ""adventure as he would of wished"".

Overall, the beginning of the film sparked my rider spirit, but the rest was a let down.",1418688000,,712,4.419847328244275
6356693,5,B00JFVORXQ,"I'm not sure why someone wouldn't like this movie...sure it has young men who are looking for certain things, but I believe it captures what adventur riders are looking for....adventure. To undertake such a ride with little experience takes some blind luck, perserverence (have YOU ever rode a thumper for such a long distance? It's butt numbing) and trust. Its a well put together film with good music...good on them for such an effort....",1418428800,,440,4.95945945945946
6356694,5,B00JFVORXQ,What a ride!  What a report!  Loved it!,1412726400,,39,3.75
6356695,5,B00JFVORXQ,"Well done. Very well done.
It's a trip I hope to make someday and these young men simply made the choice to do it and then to top it off they filmed their adventure and did an exceptional job.
I've watched it twice and enjoyed it both times.",1412640000,2,241,4.041666666666667
6356696,5,B00JFVORXQ,"If you need an inspirational kick start to pursue that crazy goal or dream, watch this documentary. Tiernan and Matt's motorcycle odyssey left me with an immediate desire to seek out my own epic adventure(s)!",1408320000,4,208,4.9714285714285715

8650606,5,B00JFVORXQ,Pretty badass of them both to take up a journey like this! Cheers from Brazil by way of L.A.,1491523200,,92,3.8947368421052633
8650607,4,B00JFVORXQ,"It was okay. I really thought it could have been better. Their only goal was to get to Rio for Carnival. It was less about the ride than I wanted it to be. But still, it was interesting to see what they went through and the bad choices they made... mostly with their choice of motorcycles. They couldn't find anything better?",1487116800,,325,4.344262295081967
8650608,5,B00JFVORXQ,"Was talking to my wife just the other day about a fantasy ride to Rio for Carnival (which I'll never be able to do). Amazingly I found this video searching around Amazon. The story unfolds smoothly and is told well, holding one's attention as the amazing photography unfolds. I watched it twice and bought the DVD as well. Recommend it highly, disregard the critics, they're too critical.",1463270400,,388,4.8059701492537314
8650609,3,B00JFVORXQ,"This is a well-shot, well produced motorcycle movie. Huge kudos for going to the trouble to make it. There's a moment near the end when one of the two riders is upset that, in retrospect, the trip wasn't as much of an 'adventure' as he thought. I knew that one minute in, when they set out on DRZ's with supermoto-sized front rims and street tires. In other words, most of the adventure in this movie takes place on paved roads (and chasing girls each night, lol). I did learn - or rather was reminded - of a thing or two: Basics, like make sure your cleaned air filter is re-oiled; gap your spark plug; leave your counter-sprocket guard on the bike to prevent things from getting rubbed; install a headlight shutoff switch; take your bike on at least one shakedown ride before venturing on a long trip. To end on a positive, one of the things I really appreciate about this movie is the 'it will work out' attitude - good contrast to the overly scripted, ""tour"" motorcycle movies featuring the BMW set (sorry, Helge and Noren, your movies are still ok, too, especially free with Prime :-).",1459814400,,1090,4.51010101010101
8650610,2,B00JFVORXQ,It was no doubt a cool trip they took and I would not want to take away from the achievement but it wasn't enough content to make a particularly interesting full length documentary.,1454544000,,181,4.515151515151516
8650611,3,B00JFVORXQ,"Can it still be considered a motorcycle documentary when the bikes are shipped everywhere?  Really disappointing, it looked like it was going to be great..",1451520000,,155,5.2
8650612,4,B00JFVORXQ,"Quite entertaining. I would love to have time,  to do a trip like that. Unplanned trips are the best!",1444953600,,101,4.315789473684211
8650613,4,B00JFVORXQ,Great motorcycle adventure movie,1436400000,,32,7.25
8650614,4,B00JFVORXQ,"The spirit of this adventure captures the folly, excitement, and heart-warming innocence of youth. Of course it's crazy to hop on two motorcycles to ride from Las Vegas to Brazil, but that's the whole point and beauty of this journey. If you're into motorcycling, it's a must-see adventure trip. And if not, there are still many good lessons to get off the sidelines and do something big and bold on a whim.",1430179200,,407,4.666666666666667
8650615,4,B00JFVORXQ,"This is what I dream of doing! Great movie, not quite same quality as Long Way Round, but different in its own way too!",1428796800,,119,4.0
