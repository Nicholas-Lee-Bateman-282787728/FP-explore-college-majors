2746592,3,B000MRNWJ2,"I saw this on the Sci-Fi Channel, it was actually one of their better movies.  Forty years ago, some cannibalistic Satan worshippers were chained up in a house and the waters behind a newly built dam were allowed to rise until they were drowned beneath it.  Unfortunately, minutes before the water rose, a kid was exploring the town and let the head bad guy go.

Flash forward 40 years.  Some evil force has awakened and people are starting to turn up dead.  The main characters are a TV reporter (hot babe!) who's quite likable and her daughter (hot babe #2!) who has lost her friend to the mysterious force.  There's also another reporter, this one a guy, who shows up to be the hero.  I didn't much care for him, he's basically a jerk.  This is one of those movies where every secondary character has a lot of personality, and that makes the whole thing quite a bit more fun.  They also throw in one of those scenarios where the big 40th anniversary of the dam is soon to be celebrated, biggest event in the town's history, yadda yadda yadda.  As if we needed to see that played out for the 1,000th time.

Overall, if you like low budget horror movies, with a couple of hot babes (who actually look like mother and daughter), well, this one isn't too bad.  The plot moves along at a fair pace and although this certainly isn't any sort of masterpiece, it succeeds in keeping the B-movie lover entertained for 90 minutes.",1191110400,2,1423,4.4728682170542635

2746594,1,B000MRNWJ2,Time is our most precious commodity:  it is irreplaceable and limited.  Don't waste any of yours on this movie. One star is too many.  I lost 21 minutes of my time:  20 watching and 1 writing this review.  Goodbye.,1184198400,8,214,4.384615384615385
2746625,2,B000MRNWJ2,"European horror movies have a particular brand of charm that makes them unique. Only in a European horror film will you see a hot blonde mulling over the possibility of life after death as she takes a dip in a skin-tight swimsuit.  European horror, it seems, wants to be philosophical and promiscuous at the same time.

It begins with two boys, Teo and Luis, who stumble across the flooded remains of an abandoned church.  Venturing inside, they find people tied up and in obvious distress, so poor Teo does what anyone might do - release them. Big mistake, as this frees Mordecai Sales (Patrick Gordon, doing his best Julian Beck impression), who is some sort of demonically-powered cultist.  Mordecai enjoys getting really intimate with his victims - you could say  he's fond of deep kissing, if that deep kiss happens to involve ripping your jaw open and biting your tongue.

It's pretty clear from the beginning that the normal taboos American horror films avoid, like mutilating children, won't hinder Spanish producer Brian Yuzna. And in that regard Beneath Still Waters is eager to shock, be it bizarre orgy scenes, over-the-top demonic worship by priests and nuns, or priests and nuns molesting goats in an orgy scene.  American cinema did all this in the 70s; if you see something like this nowadays it's usually played with a wink.  Yuzna plays it straight though, which gives the whole film a surreal retro vibe.

Forty years later, the town of Marienbad is celebrating the anniversary of the Desbaria Dam.  Thanks to the Dam the town is dry, but Desbaria is forgotten, submerged by the floodwaters and long forgotten. Enter journalist Dan Quarry (Michael McKell) and news reporter Teresa Borgia (Raquel Merono). As the granddaughter of the previous mayor of Marienbad, Teresa's daughter Clara (Charlotte Salt) has a special connection to the town's sordid past. It seems that with the passing of Teresa's father (Clara's grandfather), the curse has returned.  We know this because the old coot keeps showing up to warn the Borgias, which unintentionally evokes the goofiness of Evil Dead II.

There's no real rhyme or reason to how the curse works.  It involves a book, a burning flame, and the aforementioned lust and violence. There's lots of nudity and some creative gore, but Beneath Still Waters is at its best when it evokes the spookiness of a murky lake.  Water can be creepy - the Ring is the movie to beat in this regard - and when Yuzna tries to be quietly disturbing, the effect is unsettling.

But he's much more interested in random carnage.  With the exception of Quarry, none of the protagonists really have a plan.  The Borgia's run around screaming, ping-ponging from witnessing one twisted scene to another.  They are primarily vehicles to get the audience to watch weird stuff happen, which is interesting the first time but gets old fast.

The special effects range from pretty good to embarrassingly bad, but the acting never goes beyond mangled accents and people screaming. The plot doesn't make much sense and the editing is so choppy that you might wonder if you missed something.  You didn't - Yuzna wants to evoke a theme, a mood, a style, and occasionally he does.  But these disturbing vignettes do not a compelling movie make. If you're not a fan of this style of horror, the ""twist"" ending definitely won't change your mind.",1292544000,4,3368,4.884007029876977
2746626,3,B000MRNWJ2,"While nothing to rush out and buy, Brian Yuzna's 2005 film ""Beneath Still Waters"" is not nearly as bad as the negative comments would indicate.  It's a decent premise with quality production design, it puts most of its repectable budget on the screen, Charlotte Salt is very easy to look at, and it features the most effeminate looking warlock in cinema history for some needed (although probably unintentional) comedy relief.

The negative reaction mostly comes from an extremely weak ending and a final moronic twist that takes about 10 IQ points off the target audience.  But compared to the staggeringly lame low budget garbage going direct to DVD these days ""Beneath Still Waters"" is a breathe of fresh air.

Things set up nicely with an interesting flashback scene to 1965 when a damn project flooded a valley in Spain and submerged the village of Marinbad.  The reason for this is slowly revealed during the first half of the film as it is tied to a supernatural force which has caused several recent deaths in the town and appears to structurally weakening the damn on the eve of the new village's 40th anniversary celebration.

The last third of the film is like a bad remake of Jaws 3-D (1983), degenerating into a low budget disaster movie.  Just substitute a damn, a lake, an effeminate warlock, and a partying hard group of villages for the Sea World glass tunnels, the ocean, the mean shark, and a bunch of partying park guests.

Salt is the best reason to watch.  She has several scenes with her recently deceased grandfather's spirit; which are nicely done and genuinely creepy.  The special effects are not overdone and the only genuinely lame character is the village's ""Ed Wood"" type police captain.

The DVD is closed captioned which is getting to be an indicator of technical quality. And the lack of a commentary feature is good sign that the director is grounded in reality.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child",1285804800,,1944,4.767164179104477

2746628,3,B000MRNWJ2,"If this were my first time watching this, I definitely would've only given it two stars. I'll get to that soon.

This film, which involves an occult force, the leader of which is able to summon a supernatural power than slowly corrupts the town, not surprisingly has something of a Lovecraftian feel to it - well, the kind of feel that usually comes with movie adaptations of Lovecraft stories at least, which isn't so good, but moving on...

Good: Actually the earlier parts of the movie succeed in achieving an ominous feel with disappearances, signs that ""something"" is not right in this town and such. The back story flashback that appears later is creepy and... er, some of the characters had potential I guess. The cult lead is kind of intimidating.

Bad: Narrative seems to skip from the mother to the daughter abruptly and sometimes in confusing ways. Most central characters didn't get enough focus. The pacing towards the end felt rushed. The cult leader's powers aren't well-defined and he seems to gain new abilities out of nowhere, and not even for the sake of plot.

So yeah, bad overwhelms good here. Unfortunately.

But here's the thing: like most DVD's I buy here, I saw the movie on TV first - a few times actually - and... well, obviously I liked it (well, moderately enjoyed it at least)otherwise I wouldn't want the DVD (this is why I don't give many negative reviews here).

This is a Spanish film shot in English with Spanish actors - so expect a huge latitude of accents (from laughable to hilarious). The story starts from a promising (an old village submerged by a big dam) and sinks fast into clich (there was a devilish population of orgiastic devil worshipers there who suddenly come back 40 years after the fact to get some revenge).

The film could have been a nice thing if it was not for an ultimately bad script that boosts laughable characters, laughable situations, a contrived story and many many many genre clichs. The effects are not bad, but one would expect better ideas.

Mr. Yuzna, who is a talented director, keeps working with bad scripts and ruining his reputation. He should make less films and better ones.

2746633,3,B000MRNWJ2,"Beneath Still Waters (Brian Yuzna, 2005)

I'd probably have passed the one up altogether were it not based on a Matthew Costello novel. I had no idea when I sat down to watch it that it was directed by Stuart Gordon protege Brian Yuzna, who's done some very interesting stuff over the years (though, to be fair, some not-so-interesting stuff as well). Yuzna, as Gordon before him (with Dagon), heads over to Spain, presumably to make a cheaper movie, casts a few minor personages on their way up and some established Spanish stars, and injects as much Lovecraftian silliness into this manuscript as he possibly can. But for the production values and Yuzna's slightly less-steady hand, this might as well be a Gordon flick, and I mean that as praise.

In 1965, the small Spanish town of Marienbad is to be flooded when a dam is built to supply power to the new neighboring town, Desbaria. Two children are investigating the town before it gets flooded, and they discover something horrific-- four people chained in the basement of one of the houses. One of them sets the leader free and is killed for his troubles; the other flees, retreating into insanity for the rest of his days. Fast-forward to the fortieth anniversary of the dam, and Desbaria is putting on a celebration. It's drawn Dan Quarry, a journalist (Michael McKell, of the long-running daytime soap Doctors) who's doing a story on the sunken town, and Teresa Borgia (Raquel Merono, who showed up-- surprise!-- in Dagon), daughter of the last mayor of Marienbad and the first mayor of Desbaria, a plucky news reporter. (For there must always be a plucky news reporter.) Teresa's daughter, Clara (Charlotte Salt, of the upcoming Beowulf), London born and bred, is desperately bored with the small town. Until all hell breaks loose, that is. Clara's grandfather appears to her in dreams, warning her that the leader of the local coven of Satan-worshippers is going to return. You guessed it, it's the guy the kid set free in the opening sequence. And so Clara, with indirect help from her mother and Quarry, have to find a way to put an end to said cultist's evil machinations.

First off: if you're familiar with the Gordon/Yuzna axis, especially in the last decade or so, you should be well aware that what you're getting is going to be a low-budget cheesy movie. No nine-figure budgets to be found in Yuzna movies. So you can't go in expecting a glossy Hollywood production; a good part of movie appreciation is being able to look at things through the right frame. You have to expect barely credible acting (at most), a completely off-the-wall script, inconsistent direction, etc. In other words, this ain't Spielberg, and you should have lower standards when viewing it. Once you're on that level, Beneath Still Waters delivers pretty well. McKell gives the kind of performance you used to get from action-movie heroes, back in the day-- gritty, somewhat understated, resigned to the fact that if he has to save the world and die in the process, well, that's his job. The rest of the performances aren't all that great, but Yuzna takes the time-honored cheesy low-budget movie tactic of simply having everyone overact to the point of parody, and it's all okay. The effects are surprisingly decent (in spots, just as in Dagon) for a production of this level, and the script, while not exactly watertight, certainly isn't bad. The movie woke a desire in me to read the book, at least, and see what they changed to put all this into movie form, besides the names of the towns. ** ",1192060800,13,3543,4.784313725490196

8171558,3,B000MRNWJ2,"This was another strange offering. I think I liked it. I can say I did not hate it. Near the end i was hoping they would get around to it already and wrap whatever it was they were doing up, so I was ready for it to be done, which means I did not like it a lot.  It had its elements. A creepy vibe. As someone else said in a review, water can be creepy. Dark foreboding pools of murk.  The idea of a rotted village enconsed underwater, with chained corpses and even a cemetery down there forevermore. The old drowned village gag.

  This movie had some silly gore, but at the same time they were scenes that will stick in my head, so they worked in that regard. Some of the characters were good, others were wooden and silly. The police official for the town looked like Breaking Bad's Heisenberg character and I found that distracting. I was a big fan of the female leads who were easy to look at while playing their parts fine. The visiting guy who got himself into the middle of everything was annoying and I found myself rooting against him, though that would result in destroying the town. Then again, I realized destroying the town would end the movie, and by the last 20 minutes I was all for that too.

  There was a twist that seemed to be of the, ""hey, look at what we did there, we threw in a twist!""  garden variety. I think i liked it though it seemed sorta random. So yeah, overall I enjoyed the creepy vibe, the evil Mordecai Salas, the women in the middle of all this mess, and the storyline idea with the Satanic elements. On the negative, it was clunky, and at times I had no idea what the Hell was going on. A brief topless scene and a rampant orgy that sprung out of nowhere seemed sorta out of place, but hey, these things happen in a horror flick.  So at times it was grim and creepy, and there was some suspense and some horrific but not gross-out elements of gore for fans of that ilk. Actually, they were somewhat campy, and there are fans of that too.

  In the end, I cant rule out never watching this again. So that is a win. I don't regret my purchase.",1366934400,2,2081,4.198492462311558

8171560,3,B000MRNWJ2,"Director Brian Yuzna's Beneath Still Waters (2005) is a supernatural tale where the various pieces don't quite mesh, but the film does feature some thrills, gore, uneven special effects, and a little sleaze, as an ancient evil previously held in check by floodwaters, is released.

The story begins in 1965, in the Spanish village of Marienbad, where members of an evil cult have been captured and imprisoned in a basement, along with a book connected to their evil powers.  Mayor Roberto Borgia (Richard Borras) has authorized that a damn be built so that a lake will be created, submerge the town, and stop the evildoers.  Unfortunately while the waters are still rising, two boys wander into the town and mistakenly free Mordecai Salas (Patrick Gordon) the leader of the cult.  One of the boys is killed, while the second named Luis, manages to escape.  Eventually the whole town is submerged, and a lake is formed over what was once Marienbad village.

Putting aside that imminent domain on this grand a scale seems far beyond the authority of a town mayor, the story jumps forward into the present, where photojournalist Dan Quarry (Michael McKell) is shooting in the lake for a documentary.  TV reporter Teresa Borgia (Raquel Merono) is doing a story on the history of the area, as a celebration of the 40th anniversary of the flooding, is set to take place.  Teresa's daughter Clara (Charlotte Salt) is at the lake with some friends, when one of them mysteriously disappears while in the water, triggering a police investigation.  Eventually Quarry and Teresa team up, and speak to Luis (Manuel Manquina), now an adult, and living in fear of Mordecai Salas's return.  Luis tells them much about the past, but proves to be quite unstable.

Cara's grandfather was the mayor who arranged for the flooding.  He warns Cara that after he dies, she will be in danger.  After his passing, Cara has strange visions involving her grandfather and Modecai Salas.  Salas and some of his followers have already returned to the world of the living, and begun to spread their corruption.  Under the influence of the growing evil, the 40th anniversary celebration turns into a hedonistic orgy, while Salas makes Cara the focus of his attention.  Things enter a whacky new dimension, when Quarry dives down to the underwater village, to recover and then destroy the magical book.

As the supernatural elements take over, the focus gets a bit too spread out.  The special effects are spotty, particularly the underwater scenes, but the kills and gore are generally done fairly well, as are the practical effects for things like some animated corpses.  Modecai Salas makes a decent enough villain, but his potential for evil isn't exploited as well as it might have been.  The story has some rough spots, but Brian Yuzna (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bride-of-Re-Animator/dp/B00000JZJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bride of Re-Animator</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dentist/dp/630512003X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dentist</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Progeny/dp/6305300739/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Progeny</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beyond-Re-Animator/dp/B0000DC12T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beyond Re-Animator</a>) does what he can, with the budget available.

8171561,2,B000MRNWJ2,"This movie had great potential. But... its ends up being a stinker.

The concept is great. In the 1930s the WPA dams a river to create a reservoir. The catch is that a small town will is flooded.

Flooding the town buries a horrific secret, and this horror threatens to reassert itself 50 year later during the anniversary of the creation of the dam.

OK I saw the film on SciFi - There are some great scenes in this film, but overall the film is a disorganized mess. I chalked up the choppieness to the 12 hours of inane commercials for online insurance companies that SciFi manages to stuff into a 90 minute movie. So I got the DVD. Other than a little nudity the DVD version is pretty much the same thing.

Problem is that the ""horror"" scenes in Beneath Still Waters are cliche and don't fit the rest of the movie. Almost like the producers made a Lovecraftesque ""spooky"" movie and investors realized half way through that in order to sell this film, the had to put a bunch of silly blood and guts ""horror"" scenes into the movie.

The story lumbers along buried under an increasingly heavy pile of pointless cheese...finally, the story dies under the weight of this surplus junk and the movie devolves into nonsense.
