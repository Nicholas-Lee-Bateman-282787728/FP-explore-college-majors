349812,4,6301666666,"Not a bad piece of work from the King of shock. But I've seen better. buy far Brutally Live Is his best live DVD yet. Based on the Concept album of the same name the theateatics are much ........well MORE!! Squiring a two headded baby doll during dead babies(one head just happens to be a wolfs head)Picking up skelation parts and puting them in a pillow case during Pick Up The Bones. During Feed My Frankinstien he is picking up bloody body body parts and puting them in a standing glass coffin. Then buring I love the Dead well.......don't want to ruin it for you lets just say his head ends up in the same glass coffin(put there by none other than Calico Cooper the Big C's little girl)out of the coffen comes a white clad Alice (Top hat and all) And bursts into a rousing encure. Oh Did I mention the Brutally Live drum solo is plaid with flaiming drumsticks!!!!

I know this is supposed to be a review about  Alice Cooper Trashes the World and in a way it is .I own both DVD's and although just plugged Brutley Live as the better of the two (and it is if you want to see Alice at his theatrical best)Trashes the World Shows us an Alice noone ever got to see unless you got to see him live in the 80's 3/4 of the songs he doesen't sing anymore because of his conversion to Christianity,so Trashes the world is truly a collectors item. Of I Time When The original bad boy of rock was just starting to peak in his solo carereer but not yet on top. I would recomend this DVD to any Alice Cooper  fan in a heartbeat!",1190937600,3,1517,4.206185567010309
349813,5,6301666666,"When I first got into Alice this concert (on VHS) was pretty much hard to find. I had heard the live tracks from this concert on Alices CLASSICKS album. On the inside jacket it said tracks 9-14 taken from Alice Trashes the world. At first, hearing these tracks on a cd I thought that Trashes the World was a live album cd. Anyway I am glad that this DVD is available and was so impressed by this mans talent and showmanship on the stage after seeing it. So colorful, so great to listen to. All the songs were good. DESPERADO was incredibly well done with the modern (1990) guitar style. Love him breaking out of the big trash can at the beginning; always has a new entrance. Such good quality and so reasonably priced. I'm so glad they released The Nightmare Returns on DVD as well.",1145577600,2,782,4.363013698630137
349814,4,6301666666,"Alice Cooper, after having poor album sales for years, released the album Trash. This album was his comeback. Alice changed his sound to 80s hair metal and released on the biggest and best albums of his 37 year career.

This DVD has all the songs from Trash, except ""Hell Is Living Without You"" and ""Trash"". It also includes his hits like ""I'm Eighteen"", ""Schools Out"", and ""Billion Dollar Babies"".

The preformance is very good, but features band members that would be there only for that tour.

There are two reasons I gave this 4 stars:

1. There are no bonus feature or commentary, just the concert

2. He ends the show with ""Only My Heart Talkin'"". (What was he thinking).

I recommend this to any Alice fan. The concert is superb.",1136160000,4,736,4.580152671755725
349815,4,6301666666,"My favorite era of Alice was the late 80's and Early 90's, so I had to get this DVD for myself come hell or highwater.

I don't know if I have a faulty disk, or if it's actualy supposed to be in 1.0 sound. Meaning audio is only coming out of one speaker, i've played other DVD's in my machine to check, it's only this disc thats doing that.

Even tho I could not enjoy this in surround sound, it is quite a good performance, I gotta say, I expected to be let down by the songs not sounding any good live, but it quite suprised me how they actualy sounded quite like the original recordings, the backing vocals are not as strong as like on the TRASH album, but I thought they sounded pretty darn good actualy! Especialy on POISON, every live version I have heard prior to this performance on this DVD sounded horrible, but this one actualy sounds very good!

The stage show itself is not anywhere near as good as ""Welcom To My Nightmare"" there is not a lot of stage show, theatrics at all on this, there is the gillotine and nurses, staright jackets ect... but nothing spectacular, but that does not take anythign away from this great live show! I could possibly be wrong, but I'm pretty sure this is the show that the live tracks off ""Alice Coooper Classics"" are from. I'm 90% sure on that, so if you have heard that album, and liked what you hear, then this is the stuff!

There are no bonus features, no subtitles, no extras... there is just your main menu with song selection (Chapter index) and Play/Resume.

The set list is...

1.  TRASH
2.  BILLION DOLLAR BABIES
3.  I'M EIGHTEEN
4.  I'M YOUR GUN
5.  DESPERADO
6.  HOUSE OF FIRE
7.  NO MORE, MR. NICE GUY
8.  THIS MANIAC'S IN LOVE WITH YOU
9.  STEVEN
10. WELCOME TO MY NIGHTMARE
11. BALLED OF DWIGHT FRY
12. GUTTER CATS VS THE JETS
13. ONLY WOMEN BLEED
14. I LOVE THE DEAD
15. POISON
16. MUSCLE OF LOVE
17. SPARK IN THE DARK
18. BED OF NAILS
19. SCHOOLS OUT
20. UNDER MY WHEELS
21. ONLY MY HEART TALKING (not live, it's audio of the actualy song played during the credits)

VOCALS: Alice Cooper
GUITARS: Al Pitrelli & Pete Freezen
BASS: T-Bone Caradonna
KEYBOARDS: Derek Sheriniann
DRUMS: Jonathan Mover

Almost the entire TRASH album is in the set list, except ""why Trust You"", ""Hell Is Living Without You"" and ""Only My Heart Talking"" but the songs that are on here all go well in the same set list, they sound terrific, and get better as the show rolls on... A lot of people where asking on web sites if Slash, Bon Jovi, Steven Tyler and Joe Perry where on this show? No, it wouldve been nice to see them, but no, they are not on the show, there are no guests at all, there is a female who comes on later in the show to add some pretty good backing vocals tho, she really lifts the sound of the vocals.

Even tho it seems to be in 1.0, and there is no bonus features, for it's price, i'm happy with it. If you like the TRASH album, you'll love this DVD, if you didn't like that album, you might wanna check it out for the songs that are performed that haven't been brought out on any DVD yet... they do sound great, but they are played in the metal/hard rock style of the trash album!

UPDATE: It turned out my speakers where faulty, it is in 2.0 sound, might even be 3.0... i'm really not sure, but 2 channels work and it sounds awsome!! Just wish it was louder!",1102982400,31,3321,4.22626582278481
349816,5,6301666666,"Great concert, great transfur and a great performance by the king of shock rock!!  A must have im glad it's finally on DVD",1101340800,5,122,4.304347826086956
349817,5,6301666666,"Having to get to see Alice on his 'Trash The World' tour, I remember in a radio interview that he promised it would be MORE of a bigger-brighter, more exciting rock & roll show, much like the 'Billion Dollar Babies' tour was (for it's time). Low and behold his promise was more than kept. This here video makes a GREAT keepsake for any fan that caught him on that tour. 'Trashes The World' was taped / filmed in Birmingham, UK and one of the best features on this video is the cinematography; you know the way it was shot. There's one angle that I remember, that occurred several times, the one where the camera swoops over the audience and stops to the left of the stage. Now, that's superb video taping!! The twenty song setlist is truly the best Alice has played in years. Opening with ""Trash"" where the set-up gives us the 'new' Alice popping / busting out of a trash can, then giving you ""Billion Dollar Babies"", ""I'm Eighteen"", ""Steven / Welcome To My Nightmare"", ""Ballad of Dwight Fry"" (where he dons the straight-jacket), ""Gutter Cats Vs. The Jets"" (classic Coop stuff here), ""I Love The Dead"", ""Poison"", the RARELY performed ""Muscle Of Love"", the infamous ""School's Out"", ""Under My Wheels"" and many others. I haven't even checked to see if this title has yet been released on DVD. Great choice.",1099353600,6,1303,4.5965665236051505

349942,3,6301666666,"Well, this is an interesting video for sure. Alice had cemented a comeback by this point and the Trash album contains the big hit Poison. However, this is my least favorite of all the concert videos available. First of all, Alice is not even in make up for the first eight songs. During the song Steven he is dragged backstage and a doctor and nurses force make up on him and force him to change clothes into the Alice Cooper character. I suppose the concept sounded ok at the time but I don't like this concert because he isn't in makeup for the first third of the show. However, they go from Steven into WTMN which makes sense. Remember also this was at the end of the ""Metal"" era before Nirvana destroyed everything. Also, once Alice actually becomes Alice the concert improves. Really this was a transitional period for Alice and it is evident here. As far as band goes, it wasn't one of his best bands. Still, this is an important document in the career of Alice Cooper and you cant really go wrong with any AC release. Included in the concert is Gutter Cat Vs. the Jets, Only Women Bleed and Muscle of Love. And really the transformation was pretty good with the three songs Steven, WTMN and Dwight Frye.",1417132800,,1210,4.454954954954955
349943,5,6301666666,"Typical Alice Cooper live.  Very on point, energetic, and ready to rock.  He doesn't sound better on any of the DVDs I've bought so far [also have The Nightmare Returns -- the one with Kane Roberts from MTV's Halloween special -- and The Strange Case of Alice Cooper].  Definitely something to get a hold and has a nice mix of new songs and old classics. 4.5/5 rounded up to 5/5",1412208000,2,378,4.371428571428571

349946,3,6301666666,The DVD concert was great until 3/4 thru it and then it stoped and skiped thru the end of it. I think it was a copy from the original and they didn't do a great job copying it. I returned it for a refund.,1388707200,,204,3.659090909090909

350022,5,6301666666,"I bought this DVD in order to replace an old VHS tape that I own since the early 90's. The DVD provides a reasonable upgrade in terms of image and sound quality, but the audio option is only 2 channel Stereo; no DTS or 5.1 Dolby Surround Sound, which, in fact, doesn't mean a reason for ""not"" buying this DVD. Alice and his five-piece band delivers a concert full of energy, good humour and lots of theatrical gadgets on stage. Rock and Roll with very much fun!",1340150400,,461,4.310344827586207
350023,3,6301666666,"I was about 3 years old when this video was recorded, so perhaps I don't have the proper perspective on where Alice was in his career during this time. This is obviously a large arena show, which is sadly no longer the norm for him.

I saw Alice Cooper on the Theatre of Death tour in a very small venue (~2000 seats) earlier this year (2010), and he was executed at least four times during the show. The concert was full of theatrics from the very beginning. This DVD, however, seems just like any other 80's metal dvd. The Coop always stands out by virtue of his theatrics, and I guess this one just left me a little cold.",1291507200,,624,4.243697478991597

350025,4,6301666666,"...is another man's treasure.  I was very glad to find that this DVD existed.  I saw Alice on this tour and it was nice to jump in the ole rock and roll time machine and take a trip back a few years.

This disc is just great.  Sound and video are both excellent.  It is a nice performance by the band.

I love collecting DVD s of tours I 've seen and this is a very nice souvenir of the tour.",1225238400,5,392,3.7777777777777777
350026,4,6301666666,"This show is of Alice's late 80's early 90's ""Poison"" fuelled comeback. The show is unique in that Alice changes the shows theme for every tour and that the music is more focused than on some of his other tours. The tracklisting is good as well. The openning half of the show is a more straight ahead rock show with minimal props. Then at around the halfway mark Alice is dragged back stage from his regained rock glory as a mainstream rock star to emerge as the old Alice we all remember scaring parents and authority figures in our youth. The last half is well executed and anyone who doesn't appreciate the euphoria caused by ""School's Out"" in a packed auditorium shouldn't be watching this dvd.",1214006400,,698,4.5476190476190474

Cooper who influenced most 80's and 90's hard rock bands, tones down the theatrics just a little for this show (though they are still there) and his band sounds great playing in a late 80's/early 90's style. Many songs from the platinum album, Trash, are played here as well as the classic. Alice has a ton of energy and sounds great as usual.",1461888000,,496,4.4021739130434785
