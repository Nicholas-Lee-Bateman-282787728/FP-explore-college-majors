8468962,4,B0009S2KII,"This movie is about an officer in Hong Kong, but it is also about a female cop and a guy who lost his mind.  The relationship between these three characters develop in the movie, but the director took too long to get to the point.  Once you are in the middle of the movie, the characters begin to take off in a way that you truly get to know who they are and the issues each of them face.  Many of us lose enthusiasms for our jobs over time, and this officer in Hong Kong is no different.  However, the tug of war with his new female partner, who has an energized spirit, will either lift him up or be brought down by him.  Either he will see the worth of his job or she will see her job as simply another paycheck.  The third character who lost his mind comes between the two of them and seems crazy at first, but over time you start to understand why he isn't that crazy after all.",1363305600,,883,4.017142857142857

8468964,5,B0009S2KII,"I bought this film several years ago and continue to appreciate how the script and plot portrays the human elements that touch us all. This type of genre, between two opposites and their parallels, has been played out many times in films. But this one creates another entertaining parodoxical twist between human comedy and tragedy.

As the title suggests, Crazy N' the City is about the excitement and struggles that go on in the city through the lives of two police officers paired together. While the DVD cover shows the major characters smiling, the story goes much deeper beyond the mood the cover portrays. One officer, a new female rookie (Yung), is paired with an older male veteran (Chan) to patrol the streets of Hong Kong. The story immerses the viewer of city life, from a mentally-disabled transient (Ng, who plays a major part near the climax of the story) to a thief caught stealing food in a store for his child. The initial enthusiasm and excitement of our young female officer is immediately put to the test by the experienced veteran. A mentor, as well as a patriarchal figure throughout the storyline (exemplified by searching for a killer of another young girl he befriends), our older veteran guides not only his female partner, but the viewer as well.

At first, we see the major differences among the pair as they patrol the streets. But as the story progresses, the writer of the film (James Sai-Sang) creatively reflects the parallel lives of the two. Because of her perspective futile efforts to help others (with the help of course, of her mentor), our female rookie loses hope and charisma as the plot develops. In retrospect, we also see the respect and mild compassion/ understanding the older officer has for his younger partner. It is in this sense that the tables are turned when he befriends other characters that reflect this type of innocence. When a lurking killer, whose whereabouts are dispersed sparingly throughout the story (to avoid too much distraction from the character development of the pair), finally aggravates our veteran- the roles play in reverse. Now it is the veteran who is chasing the villian as if he just came out fresh from the police academy. Guess who now questions his seemingly vain attempts? :)

Scenes throughout the film were made to fit the comical and tragic consequences of the plot. The creators of this film have woven the story skillfully that can only be appreciated from watching it to the end.

Without revealing too much other details, I highly recommend this movie to those who enjoy a good story that takes suprising twists and turns. The major characters (as well as the supporting ones) all play a part in creating an entertaining story of city life and the ending finale of all the heroes involved.",1210291200,,2781,4.836134453781512
