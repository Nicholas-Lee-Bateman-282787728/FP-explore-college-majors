Imprudence is not serious, its a comedy that makes fun of movies, and its really funny. For seventy five bucks and two days worth of work, this movie is a little gem, and I am happy to have it in my collection. But, not all people will get or like it, its a cult movie, so I can't say you will love it, as some people just don't get it. I still love it though. Good way to waste a few hours!",1133827200,2,555,3.920353982300885
8284266,4,B0002US52S,"While this movie may not be a high budget film the likes of ""Scream"" it does invoke the spirit of that other, more important, horror genre the 'B' movie.

Imprudence tackles the classic zombie film with a gusto that is refreshing and at times nostalgic to the point of humor. We see great acting from a cast of virtual no-names who make the film a pleasure to watch, as they allow us to look past the over hyped Hollywood fame. I will be interested to see where these young actors' careers take them, for they show great potential.

This movie is a must-see for those of you who enjoy the cinematic underground, and are looking for a fun way to spend some time on a weekend.",1096761600,8,674,4.341269841269841

Witches and weed whackers and the undead- that's all you need to know.

Don't eat before or while you're watching it.",1093305600,6,154,4.884615384615385
8284268,5,B0002US52S,"I enjoyed a lot of the good moments to this film, although the audio track was really distorted on the DVD, maybe its my crappy TV, but the audio sounded horrible, I'm sure it wasn't the intent of the director, for it was a really cool movie for being made in 2 days on a budget of 75 bucks. I will recommend this to hardcore gore hounds and 70s film lovers, but if you cant handle your stomach, you might get grossed out.",1093132800,9,422,4.096385542168675
8284269,5,B0002US52S,"I was lucky enough to catch this gem at the premiere at the historic Tivoli Theatre. This was a very entertaining movie, the film looks like they had alot of money, when the actual budget was around 75 dollars. The blood was pretty gross, my favorite parts were when the weedwacker was cutting limbs off and the bad guys other member was ripped off. I would definately reccomend this movie to anyone. 5/5 stars.",1092355200,6,411,4.5675675675675675
8284270,5,B0002US52S,"What to say about a film that is destined for cult status? I can honestly say that I did have a good time at the premiere at the tivoli, and I have enjoyed the DVD. There were some really sick parts in this movie, some of them I had to turn away at. Blake, this was an interesting movie. 5 stars.",1092355200,,296,3.8688524590163933
