The story and all that isn't my favorite stuff but there was a lot of artistic elements all pulled together in this, from the writing,acting,cinematography and all that, and it was funny, some kind of societal reflective dark comedy just a bit, a little like ""night crawler""was, but not as good, but this was good. I just like stuff with more action and crazy stuff going down, but this was a nice piece of work for sure and the acting was great, really funny dudes kind of like dumb and dumber but way better.",1520380800,,600,4.366071428571429
8037154,5,B00062IXHO,Sure glad I lowered my requirements. This one was 4:3 and the stereo decoded with Pro Logic quite excellently. There was action; like a chase. There was shooting; well you had me with the title. Even if it wasn't 16:9/5.1 the story was good.,1517356800,,241,4.5

8037156,3,B00062IXHO,"There are two movies titled ""Men With Guns"" that came out around the same time, unfortunately -- one directed by John Sayles, and one directed by Kari Skogland.

Kari Skogland's Men With Guns has Callum Keith Rennie in a supporting role. Donal Logue is one of the two main stars. Skogland's Men With Guns is a 2.5 star flick. I watched it mostly for the beautiful young Callum Keith Rennie. The plot was somewhat predictable, and though the leads (and Rennie) turned in great performances, the movie descends into cliche-ish ultraviolence towards the end. I think the director was maybe trying for some Peckinpah-type choreographed violence with this film -- as well as a morality tale about what happens when the powerless get themselves a little power via arming themselves -- but it ended up just being gory bullet-ridden violence.

I had Skogland's version of Men With Guns on VHS but no longer have a VCR.

I want to buy it on DVD.

THIS Amazon manufactured-on-demand DVD-R says that it has Donal Logue and Callum Keith Rennie.

But when I watched the preview provided by Amazon for THIS Men With Guns, I got the John Sayles Men With Guns movie trailer.

So which is it?",1483142400,,1175,4.7073170731707314
8037157,2,B00062IXHO,"Eddie and Richard are two losers who were bullied as children. Adulthood is not much different. They opt to get guns and fight back and suddenly when things go awry they find themselves way over their heads leaving the audience with nothing to root for but a quick end to the film.

I didn't like the plot, the characters, or the dialogue.

Guide: F-bomb. Sex and nudity.",1429142400,,371,4.522388059701493
8037158,5,B00062IXHO,"The film depicts two men who were shunned in the teen lives and now, as adults, they continue to carry the hurt.  Once they have the courage to take revenge, all hell breaks loose and they are uncontrollable.  For me, it is not my type of movie.  Too much violence!!",1375315200,,266,4.28
8037159,3,B00062IXHO,"This is one of those movies that you hate to watch.  Two losers (Eddie and Richie) working for a criminal get jacked up when sent on an errand by him.  They want revenge on the bad guys, so they enlist help from their doped up friend (John Mamet) to buy guns for them from another shady character.  They plan to teach the criminals a lesson, but everything goes deadly wrong.  Eddie and Richie steal a boat load of cocaine which just happens to belong to a powerful drug lord.  It isn't long before the drug lord abducts Richie, and demands that Eddie give him back his stolen merchandise.  So what's the problem?  The trio has already sold a lot of it.  Now it's Eddie and John to the rescue, which turns into another major mess, ending with John killing himself - I did see this one coming - amonst all the mayhem.

Men with Guns is a grim story about two boys pretending to be men; it's about how you don't cross drug lords or steal from them.  It's also about knowing your limitations, and recognizing your weaknesses.  The only character left alive was the one I wanted most to  die.  Isn't that how it always happens?  The best thing about this film is the fantastic performance by Callum Keith Rennie as John Mamet.  Worth watching for that alone.",1362355200,,1254,4.414847161572053
