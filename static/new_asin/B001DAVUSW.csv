8292460,5,B001DAVUSW,Freaky Farley is one of my favorite independent horror films of all time. It is so much fun and weirdly entertaining that I recommend it to all fans of offbeat cinema. This is a good time flick.,1425945600,,194,4.27027027027027
8292461,4,B001DAVUSW,"FREAKY FARLEY is the first feature film by the New Hampshire based Motern Media. It has a weirdly unique and compelling aesthetic style, which Motern carried on in their second film, MONSTERS, MARRIAGE, AND MURDER IN MANCHVEGAS.

This aesthetic style includes adult characters behaving in a childish manner, much like Chris Elliot did in the early 1990s TV sitcom, GET A LIFE. And like that show, FREAKY FARLEY is quirky and satiric, yet also innocent.

FREAKY FARLEY is about a peeping Tom turned serial killer, who is released from prison on condition that he kill the Trogs -- monsters who inhabit the nearby woods. It sounds very bloody, but neither ""freaky Farley"" nor the Trogs are particularly scary. Their attacks resemble children playfully patting their ""victims."" These attacks are occasionally intercut with gore shots that look both faked and out of place.

All the younger characters (i.e., people in their 20s) suffer from arrested development. Freaky Farley is a peeping Tom who still lives at home and submits to his father's discipline. His nascent girlfriend, Scarlett, wishes she were Nancy Drew and enlists Farley on her fantasy missions around town -- by climbing in through his bedroom window. (What she does for a living, if anything, is never addressed.) ""Girl next door"" Katy pines for Farley's affection, but although she works at a radio station (an adult job), she rides a child's bike and wears childlike pigtails.

These twentysomethings talk and behave like children. Lots of eye rolling, heavy sighs, and ""Aw shucks!"" to express displeasure, diluting any ""horror"" with their endearing innocence.

FREAKY FARLEY's innocence is bolstered by its quirkiness. Much as in TWIN PEAKS, oddball characters pervade the film's Americana small town. There is the flaky witch, street poet, ninja, and ""bearded hobo"" -- because ""Just calling him 'hobo' sounds less interesting,"" according to Scarlett.

FREAKY FARLEY is an oddball film created by serious ""amateurs"" in New Hampshire. To show how serious, they shot it (and skillfully shot it) on super 16mm film, rather than the usual DV. It's an example of true ""independent cinema,"" not the same old, same old ""indie"" film about hipster/slacker twentysomethings living in New York. (Yes, I loved THE DAYTRIPPERS and WALKING AND TALKING, and even PARTY GIRL -- but enough with the copycats!)

Not everyone will love FREAKY FARLEY. Some may dislike its rough acting, or the story's tame innocence. But it's something truly different, and an entertaining romp in small town Americana.",1323388800,,2552,5.194647201946472
