8257514,1,B00154J722,"The Specials ""Too Much Too Young"" DVD documentary sounds like a tasty idea.  It's not.  Forget anything akin to The Beatle's ""Anthology"" or Paul Weller's ""Into Tomorrow"" where the artists involved tell their story.  There is zero input from any members. This is a dreadfully shambolic affair where the narrator not only reads in a monotone, bored voice, he fumbles on words occasionally and the DVD's editor couldn't be bothered to have the bits re-done!  The bands videos for all their singles are presented in their entirety, but the quality of most of them is borderline dodgy, as if they'd been snatched from YouTube.  I don't remember these videos looked so flushed out or grainy in the 80's?!?!  Worst of all while the lackluster narrator is spewing out the band's story the same stock footage from three different gigs is re-run again and again.  The band's dynamic 1980 ""Saturday Night Live"" appearance is mentioned numerous times but not exhibited (though in fault possibly due to copyright limitations).  Save your money and rent this travesty from Netflix and see for yourself................",1211414400,2,1103,5.088888888888889
8257515,4,B00154J722,"This new DVD documentary about The Specials is a treat...this band had enormous energy and great ideas, mixing a progressive political POV with true entertainment value...The ""Too Much, Too Young"" DVD offers real insights into what they were all about. It's clearly a low-budget offering but all the more impressive given these limits....this DVD delivers the goods and doesn't waste your time... the Super 8 segments, of The Specials performing in a small Long Island, NY club, are woven throughout and then run in full at the end. This gritty footage, shot from the audience, offers a raw glimpse of this powerful band at their peak, up close and personal. The Specials record company videos form the meat of this program, and are terrific. Highly recommended.
