8676170,5,B00N47NMW4,"Universal-International, beginning in the 1940s, produced some very classy, color Westerns. Among the solid actors in its stable were Rod Cameron, Audie Murphy (almost all of his  Westerns), Joel McCrea (a fine series early in the 1950s), Jeff Chandler, and of course, the Anthony Mann-directed Jimmy Stewart. But other actors, including Rock Hudson, Steve McNally, Jock Mahoney, and Rory Calhoun would work with the studio and create excellent oaters, as well.

In the latest installment from the Universal vault series the studio has released several Westerns starring Yvonne De Carlo.  ""River Lady"" is an entertaining one of these. Rod Cameron co-stars, and contributes his accustomed fine acting. Actually, the underrated Dan Duryea steals many of the scenes. The reproduction is fine, in excellent Technicolor. Universal (and Columbia), when filming Westerns, usually never skimped on production.

""River Lady"" is entertaining---Yvonne De Carlo was always nice to watch!  And Duryea and Cameron are really top notch (we need more releases of THEIR films, too!).

Now, let us hope now that Universal will release some additional McCrea (what about ""Saddle Tramp,"" ""Black Horse Canyon,"" and ""Frenchie""--all excellent?); perhaps some of the Jock Mahoney work from the late 1950s (""A Day of Fury,"" an excellent film, co-starring the recently deceased Dale Robertson; ""Showdown at Abilene,"" etc.). And despite recent releases of some of Audie Murphy's better films, other fine ones are still out there---""Kid from Texas,"" ""Bullet for a Badman,"" ""Gunpoint,"" and "" Gunsmoke,"" which was onc available of VHS). Then, there is ""Four Guns to the Border,"" starring Rory Calhoun, with Walter Brennan, arguably Calhoun's best Western. Many of these oaters have been released in Europe, but they badly need release in the USA in the NTSC format.

In the meantime, enjoy ""River Lady"" and ""Frontier Gal"" and other new vault releases. And, thank you, Universal.",1415664000,9,1948,5.409240924092409
