5153186,5,B008DCXZO0,"Although a big fan of British TV, was unfamiliar with this show until my brother sent me a link to a clip from this series. After watching some more clips and laughing myself silly, had to add this to my collection.

The show is hilarious and even more so with the unexpected mishaps. Very much like the old days of live TV. One show has one of the cameras knocking over some of the scenery and they just work it into the dialog. Definitely not for kids, though older teens shouldn't be warped by any of the humor presented. The actors work great together and really feed off each other. Was very happy with the quality of this Blu Ray set. Why can't we get show like this on US TV?

I am familiar with the Region coding rip-off foisted on us by the Hollywood studio elite. Thanks to the internet, I have had region free players for years. A must if you enjoy foreign programming.",1358812800,4,880,4.295180722891566

I assume since it was Universal and I bought  it here (US) from Amazon,

5153197,1,B008DCXZO0,Actually we love the productions done by Brendan O'Carroll but the Blu Ray disc set we received would only play one of the disc....the pilot episode.

Thrilled to get the set, planning on treadmill walking to be able to watch the episodes!!  The show is so good it'll make me walk twice as long to see more of it!

Yes it plays on a nonregion DVD player (a lot of American DVDS will play both regions on them but check before you assume) or buy the one Amazon sells for $40 that will play UK Dvds.  This is the most hilarious series ever, utube has a few skits to watch that will absoultely have you rushing back here to buy this full set!!

Not knowing it was not a DVD to be played in the U S. it was for Europe ,South American countries. I was disappointed to say the least. I believe that amazon should have had this nformation on the first page where you order the DVD. I have ordered many DVDs from amazon in the past which are mainly made in England & Ireland and never had this problem. The worst part is amazon will not let me return this DVD for credit.

Of course that was before I heard of Mrs Brown. Guaranteed laughs in every episode. I just ordered season 3 and can't wait for it to get here. I hope this show goes on forever.

Just to clarify in case anyone doesn't notice in the description, this show is not from the USA and will therefore not play unless you have a multi region or region free DVD player. You can purchase one for about the cost of a DVD. It is inappropriate for  people to give the show bad reviews when they haven't even watched it, just because they don't understand about region codes.",1367539200,19,712,4.189781021897811
