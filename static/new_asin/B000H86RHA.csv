8137527,5,B000H86RHA,I watched this documentary on VHS and it is an excellent story about the Blacks in America who served this Nation.  I decided to order it again in DVD. I am retired from the United States Navy and have experience all the racism  through the fifties and sixties and this is a movie every Black person should see.
