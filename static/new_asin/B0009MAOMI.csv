8062969,5,B0009MAOMI,I have watched this over and over again I love the goz and mez scene very much. It is very relaxing.,1360886400,,100,3.8095238095238093

8062971,4,B0009MAOMI,"The episodes make up the 2nd half of episode 8 through the first half of episode 10 of the original DBZ dub.  Goku has to deal with Hell's fitness instructors, Goz and Nez, while Gohan tries to find a way back home.  This volume also has one of my favorite DBZ fillers: The Princess Snake episode.  Goku winds up falling into a strange house where the beautiful Princess Snake(who Goku thinks is King Kai and winds up beating up, much to chargin of pretty much everyone there), who's determined to keep hunk Goku from leaving at any costs... and if she can't have him for herself, she'll just have him for dinner?  The episode is pretty funny and one of my personal favorites.  We also see quite a few scenes, such as cameos from pre Z DB characters, Goku learning of Russian Roulette, and Tenshinhan and Chaozu climbing up Korin Tower to make it to Kami's; it continues to shock me on just how much Saban cut from DBZ in their first run.  I'm still not giving it a full 5-star rating due to the fact that we're still incredibly behind(CN finished their UNCUT first 2 season run a month ago!), but I'm happy that vol. 6 is coming out in a month rather than two.  Now if they could just bring it up to 2 DVDs a month I'd be at the happiest.",1131235200,2,1239,4.269230769230769
8062972,2,B0009MAOMI,"Dragon Ball Z to me is the best anime. BUT...with FUNimation still doing their 3 episodes on one disc thing, we have to wait until NEXT YEAR until we get to the great Nappa and Vegeta fighting. There SHOULD be 5 episodes on one disc but NO! As for the episodes...this is the worst patr of the series. Boring, dumb, and not that exciting. FUNimation should start picking up the pace for Cartoon Network has already start showing the Frieza saga.",1125100800,4,444,4.493827160493828
