So was Daivd Warner and Ronny Cox, but Stewart was amazing. If I were the head of the Emmy committe, I would just hand him the award. Not just any actor can pull that off. A man is being tortured and abused, but he still has his spirt. And Picard being asked if their were five lights instead of four. ""There....are....four....lights!"" Was his answer. I was just in awe of Stewart. The episode itself was brilliant. Ronny Cox as the fill in captain is so different from what Picard is. Also, Jonathan Frakes turns a good performance. This show is brilliant all the way around.",1106092800,,713,4.492307692307692
7879302,5,6304925093,"This two-parter was a terrific season-ending ST-TNG episode, featuring a duel with the Cardassians, Captain Picard in jeopardy and a new commander for the Star Ship Enterprise.
And the Enterprise crew really let us down.  Rather than exhibiting military professionalism and backing to the hilt their new commander -- Capt. Jellico, magnificently portrayed by Ronny Cox -- they fought him every step of the way.  The story had a strong emotional pull on the viewers, thus the obvious course was to sympathize with the crew's irritation at their new boss, whose personality was far different from that of Capt. Picard.  However, that crew was placed on that ship to carry out orders issued by their captain, to the letter and spirit of his or her desires.  Possibly their long association with Capt. Picard had made them too buddy-buddy with him, somewhat slack in their militarism, and weak in adapting to a personnel/command change.
Here's a new (though experienced) commander placed in charge of a crew whose former commander had been drafted for a special mission.  Capt. Jellico too had a special mission, a head-to-head negotiation with hostile Cardassians.  Rather than being completely free to concentrate on that mission, Capt. Jellico had to deal with the distractions of crew sensitivity and grudging cooperation, which extended to Executive Officer Riker's outright insubordination (for which he was quite properly relieved!).  And Jellico was eminently appropriate in ordering Deanna to dress more professionally, rather than prancing around in her skin-tight slack-suit.
At first glance, combined with the history of being emotionally connected to the Enterprise crew, it could have been perceived that Capt. Jellico was being harsh and/or unfair -- but further thought, coupled with an understanding of how a military chain of command functions, illuminates only the fact that Riker, Deanna and the others truly reflected poorly upon Capt. Picard, who should have nurtured in them the ability to conform professionally to whatever martial situations they encountered.  Instead, they acted like a bunch of whiny teenagers.
Capt. Jellico, upon his departure, told the crew it had been a privilege to serve with them.  Later, however, I bet he subtly, quietly passed the word in his professional circle that the Enterprise command crew was a gaggle of spoiled brats, and working with any of them on a future assignment should probably be avoided.  I believe that is what I would have done.
But then again, this was just a fictional TV show -- and a great one at that!",1057190400,5,2577,5.187951807228916
7879303,5,6304925093,"Patrick Stewart and David Warner are superb in this cat-and-mouse expose of the horrors of breaking a prisoner. Stewart in his role of Jean-Luc Picard, captain of the Enterprise, is put to a most intense interrogation by Warner's Cardassian Gul. Both actors stretch their acting mettle in performances worthy of awards.
After being rescued by his crew, Picard's final revelation is stunning.
Comparable in scope and execution to Deep Space Nine's ""Duet,"" which was also basically a two-person story.",961804800,4,499,5.329113924050633
7879304,4,6304925093,"In this episode, the second part of 'Chain of Command', Picard has been captured by Cardassians, and is being tortured by a suitably unpleasant Gul, while the Enterprise is under the command of Captain Edward Jellico.  I think the first episode was better, only because it was more dramatic and  exciting as Picard, Worf, and Dr Crusher undertook a secret mission to  Cardassia. This is still pretty good and continues what is a nice insight  into life on Cardassia, especially when the Gul is talking to Picard about  the hardships of a childhood on the streets, and we get a bit of Cardassian  history thrown in as well. The torture scenes were very well portrayed and  not too over dramatic, with great performances from the characters  involved.
This episode is a must have for all Picard fans. It's one of  his best performances of the season, if not of the whole of Next Gen. Riker  also has a pretty good part, as he and his new captain don't exactly see  eye to eye. The actor who played Jellico did so very well and I really  didn't like the character, especially after the way he treated those poor  fish.
If you already have part 1, you gotta get this. If not, it's  probably best to get that first; the story'll make far more sense :)",959904000,4,1246,4.504464285714286
7879305,5,6304925093,"Most Star Trek TNG fans, when asked for their favorite episodes, don't usually think about this one.  No Borg or Q or guest stars from the original series.  But if you think Jean Luc is the man, this video has to  be in your library.  Patrick Stewart's performance in the torture scenes  was Emmy-caliber and probably the best TV acting I've ever seen.  Don't  wait for the rerun.",932515200,3,380,4.5
