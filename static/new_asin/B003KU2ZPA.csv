8398934,5,B003KU2ZPA,"My 5 year old son loves this show. We have this set, but we also watch it on Amazon Prime. He learns about landmarks, customs, geography, etc. It has increased his pretend/imaginative play vocabulary when it comes to building blocks, sandbox building, even chatting with others, drawing pictures, etc. His preschool has an airplane shaped teeter totter on the playground and he's always informing his friends about different parts of the world that they are pretending to visit that he's become interested in because of this show.",1467676800,,530,5.103448275862069
8398935,5,B003KU2ZPA,"These are nice travel shows, focused predominantly on younger children in some cases, but in others you still get a good idea of what types of travel adventures will work well for older kids and families, too.  We're enjoying them & getting some good ideas of where we want to go - and where we might not really care to, as well.  (And P.S. These little boys are just too cute!)",1407888000,,378,4.309859154929577

8398938,5,B003KU2ZPA,"This product is extremely well designed.  The 5 dvds come in a reusable tin box and the dvd trays are biodegradable and made from recycled paper fibres.  The actual tin box is very eye appealing and of high quality~ makes perfect birthday gifts or for any occassion!
The episodes cover Cruising with Kids, France, England, Ireland, Scotland, New York City, Florida, Alaska, Bahamas, Jamaica, Costa Rica, and Peru.  Features approx. 12 hours of video!
The episodes are enjoyable to watch.
What I love the most about these videos is that while each episode is very informative covering activities ranging from fun to cultural, the show is shot and edited in such a way that it still captures the attention of my 4 1/2 year old son.
The 2 of us can watch the video together~ he gets his 'tv' time and I don't feel guilty about letting him watch 'tv' because the shows are educatinal and informative.  My son is learning while he's being entertained!
As the mom, as I watch the shows, I get ideas for places to visit that's fun for kids.
I know that when I visit any of these cities, I will be using these videos as references!
I also love the Roberts clan.  They seem so down to earth and seriously enjoying themselves on the shows.  Can Nathan and Seamus be any cuter?!
Def. a must have for any family to have in their video library~ what are you waiting for?  Buy yours today!",1303171200,5,1375,4.497991967871486

8398940,5,B003KU2ZPA,"We have been following the ""Travel With Kids"" series for some time, and now a ""box set"" has been released of the family travel guide shows produced so far.

This tin box set is an excellent value with over 5 hours of shows and a wonderful color booklet insert with photos, information and a great rundown of parenting travel tips and stories.

The extensive list of shows included in this set are fun & fast paced, full of information, explanation and travel tips, while showing the kids experiencing, sharing, having fun (sometimes not having fun) and learning in each destination. What I like about the show is that its a real family traveling, doing regular things that a visiting family would do. They don't find ""hidden and secret"" places that no one would go to anyway. They don't eat weird bugs and food and do extreme recreation.

What it does show is the family visiting and experiencing the main and lesser known attractions and activities in a travel destination, presenting it in a fun informative way that kids, parents and grandparents love to watch together to plan an upcoming trip, reminisce about where they went, or to just armchair travel to the places they would like to go. The shows put any parents at ease if they are concerned about traveling with their kids, showing the fun, wonder and amazement through the eyes of the traveling family.

Each episode is packed with history and culture, practical travel information, pop up fun facts, and the silly antics of the two boys (ages 7 - 9) while the kids and the parents relate their travel experience to the viewer in a friendly accessible way. The show isn't really ""hosted"" in the traditional way of other travel shows, but the parents and the kids do talk directly to the camera from time to time. The scenery is stunning and the music (many times from local artists) creates the scene and makes the viewer want to pack up and go! The Travel With Kids series is designed to entertain, inform and inspire families to explore and learn together.

The series has been on TV internationally for several years, broadcasting in Canada, Latin America, Italy, Russia, Israel, Turkey, Poland, Finland and more. The full line up of DVDs is available on-line, but most of the shows have been put into this box set. The stand-alone DVDs do have extensive bonus features that do not come in this box set.

Destinations include London, Paris, Ireland, Peru, Costa Rica, Jamaica, Alaska, New York City, Scotland, The Bahamas, Florida, England, a Caribbean Cruise and more.

Viewers will love being transported to Machu Picchu in Peru, The Amazon rain forest, Stonehenge, The Eiffel Tower, Sled Dog racing in Alaska, to snorkeling in Jamaica. Feeding wild reindeer in Scotland to river rafting in Costa Rica, all while seeing how to get around, find a good hotel, good places to eat and wonderful sights to visit.

Winner of many awards and parenting/family friendly viewing awards, this series has even been recommended by people not traveling with kids as one of the best travel shows out there.",1292025600,2,3058,4.811428571428571
