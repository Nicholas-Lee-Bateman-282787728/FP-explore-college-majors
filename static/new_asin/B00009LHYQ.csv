8488313,4,B00009LHYQ,"This DVD has pretty good action, and is entertaining for those with some background or understanding of Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, submission wrestling, etc.

The quality of competitors is high, and the Royler and Machado matches were impressive.

It's too bad the DVD didn't have more matches, as some of the matches ended fairly quickly, but due to excellent technical skills, mind you.",1122854400,5,382,5.245901639344262
