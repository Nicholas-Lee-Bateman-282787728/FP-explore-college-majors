8225401,4,B000WS4S8K,"My father served in WWII (in Europe), and I served 10 years in the Army (1966-76) in the US and in Europe. I have read most of the major books, and have seen most of the movies and documentaries on the European portion of the war, as well as visiting many of the major battle grounds in France and Germany. But, it wasn't until I saw the Ken Burns documentary, The War, and I started visiting SE Asia and the Philippines that I began to appreciate the magnitude of the war in the Pacific. Now I can't get enough of the subject, as I realize that the war efforts of the US have been unfairly overshadowed by the war in Europe.

This particular documentary was informative, but I'm sure that it could have been 3 or 4 hours longer and still would not have covered in detail the whole story of the war in the Philippines from Dec 1941 to Aug 1945.",1378166400,,844,4.209876543209877
8225402,3,B000WS4S8K,I purchased these as a result of my interest in the internment camp of Santo Tomas in the Philippines - it would be better if they did a documentary on that camp. There is a significant amount of literature on Santo Tomas and should not be hard to get into a documentary - or a film!,1374192000,,283,4.071428571428571
8225403,4,B000WS4S8K,"The narration was a bit cheesy but nevertheless a great collection of footage of an often forgotten Pacific campaign. The Philippine campaign needs to be brought back to the memory of the people because the Philippines is very much a ""Japanese graveyard"" where about 300,000 Japanese soldiers were stationed upon the Philippine campaign and only a few thousands were captured since most were either killed or have committed suicide. It also reminds us of the tragedy that is Manila where 100,000 civilians were killed, mostly murdered by the Japanese.",1365206400,,551,5.202247191011236
8225404,2,B000WS4S8K,"Disappointing DVD in 4 episodes.  #1. Fortress of the Sea: decent rerun of Corregidor.  #2. Battle of Manila: too much redundant rerun clips from the first episode. How many times need we watch MacArthur wade in to the beach?  #3. Westward is Bataan:  disappointing.  Has nothing to do at all with Bataan.  The film clip is all about New Guinea.  #4. Minidoc - two years at war:  OK, nothing special.

Expected much more about the Philippines.",1273276800,2,443,4.723684210526316
