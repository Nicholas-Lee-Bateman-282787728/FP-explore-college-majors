1684905,5,B000062XKR,"I was so happy to discover Blue's Clues. My 3 year-old is in love with the series (and has been for a couple of years). He can watch each episode numerous times, and never gets bored. The programs are creative, fun, and educational. Even I can stand having the same episode playing in the background for the 30th time... I particularly appreciate that the screen is not overly ""busy"" like many other programs developed for this age group, which I find that to be very annoying. Blue's Clues has jus the right mix of music, talk, and visuals. I especially like the songs in this episode - as does my son.",1313712000,2,603,4.441441441441442
1684906,5,B000062XKR,the movie came in the mail. no problems with shipping. the condtion of the movie was exelcent. i would deffently buy from this again in the future.,1270166400,,147,4.481481481481482

1684908,5,B000062XKR,I have a special girl who is now 33. She sits and watches these and signs and laughs whit them. Great stuff for the little guys. She is about 3 to 4 mentally. She has even learned some things from them. Grand kids love them also.,1236124800,9,229,4.0

1684910,4,B000062XKR,there were lots of little wear and tear scratches but none that would even make it skip...i would do business with this person again,1229990400,,132,4.541666666666667
1684911,5,B000062XKR,"This is your typical Blues Clues DVD and it of course keeps my little one entertained.  I was leary to buy as another review said there were commericals that I couldn't fast forward and with a toddler that would never work.  However, you CAN skip the commercials and go to the scene menu-the same as all the other kid videos.  Is this my favorite collection of episodes-no but my kid likes them so I give it 5 stars.",1219449600,2,416,4.3076923076923075
1684912,5,B000062XKR,"My 15 month old son loves this movie. He points to the TV and says ""blue, blue and blue). This was his first blue DVD. It makes me want to go and buy more. And with my DVD player(and may others too!), otplays over and over again so i don't have to keep on pressing play.

BUt my son loves it. it is his favorite

Good JOb and make more music ones",1137715200,,346,3.7916666666666665
1684913,2,B000062XKR,"The DVD has 3, count them, 3 commercials before you get to the actual shows. Once there, you can't just say play all and let it roll (perhaps even on repeat for a long car trip), because the two ""bonus episodes"" must be selected separately. Why, why are there nearly 4 minutes of commercials that I can't skip (thankfully fast forward works) on a DVD I purchased. For a company that is designed around kids, they certainly miss the point. I wish each person in the company would have to come to my house and sit through this annoyance with my 2 year old screaming at them the hole time to ""Fix it daddy, fix it"" This is the first, and last, Blues Clues DVD I am buying. Tivo will have to find them for us or we will have none at all. Check out the ""instant start"" feature that other children's DVD's have.

While on the subject, childrens DVD's should NOT have copy protection. With the way these scratch to being unusable, I am convinced that a 2 month replacement cycle is built into their business plan. You must be able to copy the original and use the copy for every day use.",1136160000,13,1080,4.294117647058823
1684914,5,B000062XKR,"This is our favorite blues clues video. My daughter loves the big words and loves using them ,this video definitely promotes her vocabulary, she now says things like ""what an enormous ball"".
Its also great for teaching basic reading skills and getting familiar with words. The video follows the same basic scenario all the blues clues videos follow, where blue leaves clues for Steve to figure out.",1033344000,8,398,4.955223880597015

1684945,1,B000062XKR,"For the expert, there is an episode called ""Bluestock.""  It happens to be excellent.  This is not that episode.  It is four other, supposedly musically related, but one has nothing to do with music at all!",1397347200,5,205,4.638888888888889

1684949,5,B000062XKR,"I remember when I was 6/7 years old, my aunt bought me and my cousins this tape as a gift, and we enjoyed every second of it! We created our own big bag of words, being inspired from this tape, our favorite scenes was during the skidoo, a rock grew in size and then shrank (Honey, I Shrunk the Rock!). It was our favorite part, and we rewound and watched that scene over and over and over again! A good video for kids learning to read, and definitely a keeper.",1351900800,,460,4.122222222222222

7957852,3,B000062XKR,"I'm slightly disappointed in this, but my son loves it so I'm still going to give it 3 stars. I was really looking forward to this being all about music (like the description suggests) but its really just 4 episodes of Blue's Clues with Joe. We can watch all four of these episodes on the regular season listing, and honestly, there wasn't much singing or songs involved in these episodes... So, while I kind of feel like I paid for one thing, and got something different, my son thinks he's watching something new when he picks this one, so hes happy.",1467590400,,552,4.475247524752476
