I wanted to have the DVDs and, really, it was so good, so much fun, to watch them again!!
As they are comedies, I really think it is better to watch it if you understand french, otherwise it will not be as funny.
I am eager to see the third one when the DVD comes out!",1304812800,,298,3.901639344262295
8226255,4,B000WZZ5DA,"I saw La Verit si je mens! When it was released (in France) and I found it very enjoyable!

It is a shame though that you don't have it in Area 1 format. I supposed than in the USA there aren't many people used to read subtitles, they rather wait until Hollywood does its own version of the film. This is a shame again because the Hollywood versions aren't as good as the original (like for example, ""The man in the reed shoe"", or ""REC"", or ""The Ring"", or ""The Sex Guru"", etc, etc, etc....

Guys, if you can buy this movie, it is a good one, and it will give you more information about the French Culture. I recommend it.",1234656000,,621,4.12396694214876
8226256,3,B000WZZ5DA,"Would I Lie to You isn't exactly an unpleasant way to spend 100 minutes, but it's all sit and virtually no com. The sit has potential as Richard Anconina's down on his luck goy is mistaken for a Jew and given a job in the garment industry by Richard Bohringer, but the film never really finds anything particularly funny to do with it. Even blundering his way through a family Shabbat or trying to bluff his way through his family history when meeting a rabbi (the only two sequences where Judaism is really raised) only produces the very mildest of attempts at humor. Indeed, the only identifiably comic moment is that old favorite of French comedies, gratuitous violence inflicted on innocent bystanders, which is always guaranteed a huge laugh in the French salles.

Which makes it all the more surprising that the belated sequel, Would I Lie To You Again? is so enjoyable. You won't bust a gut watching it, but it is funnier and much better put together (despite one piece of clumsy recasting), ignoring the culture clash comedy entirely in favor of corporate comedy and a different case of mistaken identity. The con at the end doesn't really work because it's impossible to believe any businessman wouldn't study the specs before signing a contract, but the numerous backhanders and sweeteners en route certainly ring true. Disposable but pleasant enough, although they couldn't have known when they made it that having a joke involving Mel Gibson (well, a spectacularly bad lookalike at least) partying with Jewish businessman would take on a whole new resonance with age.

Arrow's UK PAL single-disc double bill offers decent subtitled transfers, although the subtitles on Would I Lie To You Again? are not formatted for widescreen TVs. No extras.",1201046400,,1755,4.945762711864407
