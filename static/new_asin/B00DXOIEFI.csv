5862814,5,B00DXOIEFI,i hope this looks as good in person as it does in picture im so excited for this even tho its a bit expensive and i already own all the blu rays I still really want this I want the book and the documentaries that comes with it. This set will look amazing in my collection!,1374451200,9,272,3.875
5862815,1,B00DXOIEFI,"This box set is a way to milk as much money as possible out of the Dexter brand before the show ends in the fall. It's basically a big middle finger to fans who have stuck with the show from the beginning and begged for special features on the regular DVDs/Blu-Rays. Newcomers who buy this set get a full disc of special features while loyal consumers have never gotten a single Dexter special feature out of any of the expensive previously released Blu-Ray sets. I will never promote such a business model in which premium networks (except HBO, which gives you tremendous value for your money with their Game of Thrones box sets) expect you to shell out hundreds or thousands of dollars for every half-baked item they release. I will pick up the regular edition Season 8 when it comes out and then never purchase another Showtime product.",1374451200,43,839,4.6375838926174495
5862816,5,B00DXOIEFI,"My vote goes to the show in general, save the usual complaint about the last season. The box set is pretty cool, though I do feel like they could have done a LOT more with it and made it way nicer overall.",1512432000,,205,3.9047619047619047
5862817,5,B00DXOIEFI,This was a Dexter fan gift.  He loves it.  Of course it is packaged so nice I do not believe he will ever open it.  Very reasonably priced and quick delivery. I saw comments where people were making their own real box to replicate the original. We may  do this also but for now it is a great gift for a fan and will look great on a shelf.,1511827200,,338,3.8550724637681157

5862825,5,B00DXOIEFI,"This collection arrived in excellent and completely new condition. The GRAFIX book contained outstanding art work related to the series. The photos of Dexter's baby son were very cute. I was very impressed with the quality of the slide box. It is very sturdy and should hold up for a long time. All dvds & separators were intact and in excellent condition. No scratches on the discs or bends/folds on the separators. It was fun to slide the dvds/blood slides into the various slots within the slide box. Everything (all 33 discs and 9 separators) fit neatly & orderly into the 42 available slots. I watched the first disc for Season 1 and it played well with no problems. I am extremely pleased with my purchase. If you are a fan of the show, then I highly recommend that you grab this collection before it disappears. I think you will be very satisfied.",1496016000,,854,4.588235294117647

5862828,3,B00DXOIEFI,"I'm a little disappointed that the DVD box isn't real wood, but instead a hard cardboard with a ""wood like"" contact paper wrap. And the lid is not glass or a see through plastic. Additionally the blood sample DVD holders are poorly done. The Grafix book is pretty nice however, it lacks of any background or behind the scene stories or facts, which makes it a little on the boring side.
Now I just hope all the DVDs work, it could be months before I know for certain.",1492646400,,467,4.318181818181818

5862831,1,B00DXOIEFI,"This box set is great, if you want to watch the series on Netflix, and want none of the special features to actually work. I put in 6 discs, every single one has stutters and skips. Perfect discs, no scratches, blemishes, nothing.
Almost all of the features are on BD-Live, which doesn't work on the 4 different players I have in my house. Look online, the Dexter Blu Ray special features have a history of being wonky.
Save yourself the money, watch on Netflix or get DVDs, so you can actually get the features you pay for.",1490659200,,524,4.412371134020619

The Box is cardboard, not wood and the latch just swivels up and down but does latch the top.  The numbers marking the slots are just printed on a piece of cheap paper and glued to the edge of the cardboard box and the numbers in the lid are just as cheap looking and not aligned very well.  Seems to me that for $100 + the quality should be better.  They could take a lesson from the Son's of Anarchy boxed set . . . now that is quality.

I am sure the content is great . . . but don't know because I returned mine for a replacement.  The latch seemed broken, the seal on the disc box was cut open, the book cover was torn and the divider tabs were split and bent (no protection from the disc box lid smashing the tabs).  This set looks used.

Hope the replacement is better as I really do want to watch the early seasons and I like the packaging concept, just not the execution.

Received my replacement and the quality was much better . . . no broken latch, bent tabs, etc.  I still am a little disappointed with the packaging (cardboard verses wood), but overall, I like it.  Almost through season 2.",1482105600,3,1297,4.823529411764706
5862841,5,B00DXOIEFI,I love this show and I also love that we could buy it in the blood slide collection. Great TV show,1481587200,,98,3.7142857142857144
5862842,2,B00DXOIEFI,Season 4 doesn't work. The rest of it seems to be working just fine. Pretty disappointed to have spent so much on something we can't watch all of.,1481068800,,146,4.25

5862847,2,B00DXOIEFI,Very cheaply made for the price and the discs were all over the place in the box. You would think for 200 bucks you'd get at least a balsa wood box...  It's cardboard with wood grain wrapping paper.  The show is good until the last season or two.,1466553600,,246,4.104166666666667
5862848,3,B00DXOIEFI,Love the concept of it but it's made out of cheap cardboard with imitation wood wallpaper or something. Probably would be best to just go with the standard edition.,1466380800,,164,4.689655172413793
5862849,5,B00DXOIEFI,"The box we very nice and very well put together. The inside of the box with the white part looks very kewl like it is old and has been used a little. It really accents the idea from the movie of it being used. Really kewl way to keep your discs. They came in a black box inside the souvenir box replica of the slides box, but you can take them out of the black box and set them up as you wish. Definitely worth the money!",1466380800,,421,3.8505747126436782

5862860,5,B00DXOIEFI,"The series is overall complemented by the overuse of death as a constant need for social entertainers as psychopaths. This builds off of human relationships in a way I haven't quite scene before in the media of the world. It's definitely one of the best shows in the last decade.
Enjoy",1457222400,3,285,4.607843137254902
5862861,4,B00DXOIEFI,"Even after reading all the reviews and knowing what to expect as far as the box set quality goes, I'm still a bit disappointed in this product for the price.  The blood slides and the discs, along with the book of photos/artwork related to the show are all fine.  But the cardboard box that contains everything is a bit disappointing.  The cardboard itself is sturdy so it's ok in that manner, but the wood grain look is just basically stickers on the cardboard.  Stickers which I may add have already started to come unstuck along a few edges, and we've only had this for a couple of months (and have hardly touched it).",1456876800,,621,4.469026548672566

I won't go on and on about the show because at this point, everyone knows what the show is about. The bluray set looks like a real wooden box and the blood slides are really slick.

5862919,4,B00DXOIEFI,"Good show, good set. I was concerned about the quality of the box, since many reviews were highly negative about it. Turns out a very sturdy box, that would fool quite a few people into thinking it's real wood. Box has a heft to it and real brass hinges, it's really should not be a concern to anyone.
Few negatives:
- the supplied poster book does not fit into box, so you have to store it separately
- box is huge. The dimensions are 14x7.5x6 inches. Collectors and devotees of the show would love it. Casual fans, like myself will struggle to find a shelf space big enough to accommodate it. There is lots of wasted space. Blu-ray set contains 25 disks, but there are 42 slots in the box to fit in paper cards and fake blood slides. So the box could be almost half the size and still fit the entire 8 seasons plus bonus disk.
- Assembly is required. This is minor, but when you get the package, there is outer cover, that you would have to discard, then the box itself and the disks are housed in the temporary small container within the box. It takes good 10 minutes to slide them all into slots within a box. I almost wished the carton box that the disks are stored in temporarily would have more finished look, so I would put that on shelf and not the box.

For casual fans, especially if you already running out of space to store all your Blu-Rays, this gift set would be a mixed blessing. I really wish they would release just a regular, no thrills compact Blu-Ray set that I can use to watch the show.",1443571200,8,1510,4.2613240418118465

The Discs come in a cardboard box for shipping. Most of the discs were not attached to their cases. Upon further inspection, the jewel cases are poor quality and do not properly hold the discs in place.

5862956,3,B00DXOIEFI,"This review is for the packaging only. I really only had two problems.
1. The ""wooden"" box that the discs sit in is actually thick cardboard. It's sturdy but not half as nice as the wood would have been.
2. The discs sit in half shells. So essentially on the side of the discs is unprotected. I really wonder why the makers slumped on that in particular. It's not like slim jewel cases are expensive.

I only paid $130 for mine and I'm satisfied as I'd be lucky to find the individual bluray seasons at $20 a piece so it just worked out to be cheaper this way.  Just thought this info might be helpful.",1434844800,2,602,4.226086956521739

5863035,4,B00DXOIEFI,"And this is very annoying. This is a limitation of the Discs, not the Player.

Of course Dexter, the show, deserves the 5 stars.

But the DISCs manufacturer decided, yet again in 2014, to use the BD Java format.
That format prevents the player from being able to play back the show from the last position when the player was switched off.
Seasons 6, 7 and 8 are affected.

What does it mean exactly?
For instance, after viewing two episodes you switch off the player (keep the disc inside) and leave for the week-end.
Sunday evening you switch the player back ON and... not only you have to watch the piracy warnings again, the trailers-ads and you are then back to the BD home... no trace of where you stopped 2 days before.
Which episode? At what time in that episode?

Most (other) BD manufacturer know the problem and take action. Not Showtime (or the company in charge).

5863038,5,B00DXOIEFI,"I think this is a near perfect box set and as a long time fan I could not be happier with it. I have bought many different box sets over the years and this one is by far the best I have personally purchased. The discs are all in good condition which for some reason is not always the case with sets, especially when many use cardboard sleeves that completely ruin the discs (i.e. The second version of the 'SIx Feet Under' set, 'Sex and the City,' and 'Charmed'). Unlike some, I did not expect the set to be made of real wood so this did not disappoint me. I actually felt that the cardboard was very sturdy and after a year It still has no scratches or peeling areas. This review is only for the box set, I did not order my set from Amazon. I've learned that it is better to buy sets like these in stores so that the discs have less of a chance to become dislodged and bounce around during the shipping process. I paid $180 at the time and I do not regret it. The book is also a nice touch. Overall, it is a 5 star product. Great show and fun box set!",1418083200,2,1052,4.014285714285714

The disc took me some time to figure out how they go in the cardboard box and if it is going to be handled a lot, I don't forsee this holding up.  It was worth it to have all the discs at once and in one place, but only if you are a dexter fan.",1411948800,,359,3.518987341772152
5863102,5,B00DXOIEFI,"20 or so years ago, I used to think of TV movies and series as poor cousins to what theaters could offer, especially world-class films by masters such as Bergman, Fellini, Kurosawa, Tarkovsky, and, lately, The Coens, Danny Boyle, Spielberg, and Paul Thomas Anderson. And what was on TV back then was often inferior. For me, the change really began with Malcolm in the Middle, and then, Six Feet Under, and I began to pay attention. Now, there is Breaking Bad and so many more, and the Brits are chipping in with such excellent fare as Trial and Retribution, Wire in the Blood, and lots more. Dexter caught me by surprise, it is one of the best in every way, acting, writing, production, cinematography, it is superb. I especially like the way subtle, understated humor is slipped in quite often. When I start a movie, I'm asking the filmmakers to tell me a story, a well-told and well-crafted movie that draws me in and carries me along, and Dexter does it for me as few others do.",1411862400,,981,4.548022598870056

5863112,3,B00DXOIEFI,"Love the idea of the ""slide box"" but the box is cheaply made and is a little overpriced for the cheap box.  Some of the Blu-Rays would not play correctly or skipped some parts.  The discs were clean with no scratches and if you took them out and put them back in or just rewound the movie a little it would sometimes fix the problem.  Another thing that is annoying is the showtime advertisement would mess with the blu-ray starting sometimes",1409616000,2,442,4.432098765432099

5863116,5,B00DXOIEFI,"This is the perfect fan service. If you haven't seen the show, and have a blu-ray player, it's just as perfect for you as it is for returning Dexter fans. The blood slide collection Idea for storing the discs was amazing, and truly works out great. The only slight annoyance at all about this set up is that you have to organize the discs into the right slide slots by yourself, but it wasn't a big deal and only took me about 15 minutes to do. I love this show, and I couldn't have asked for a better complete series edition. Thanks Showtime! (ON A SIDE NOTE, if you haven't seen the show, just make sure that you SKIP the intros to inserting the DVDs, because they sometimes flash a spoiler or 2 from that season. I'd say that this wasn't a wise idea to include, as I had some friends complain that it did spoil certain things, but that's just my heads up as someone who has watched the entire show.)",1408320000,2,902,4.25

5863129,5,B00DXOIEFI,"THE GOOD NEWS
I just received the Dexter DVD collection in a black cardboard, holder box, inside a nice wooden box, with extra scenes DVD, and a graphic picture book. Unlike other reviewers on this page, I received everything as advertised. I think that the major problem with the early shipments has been that (in their rush to deliver the product) incomplete orders were mailed out. However, the problems seem to have been fixed.

THE BAD NEWS
The cardboard is cheap, disk cases have no lids, and don't really hold the disks firmly in place. A few of the disks were loose when I received my set.

THE GOOD NEWS
Once you remove the disk from the cardboard box, and place them into the wooden box, everything looks like the picture shown in the advertisement.
.
THE BEST NEWS
The price has gone down and the shipping problems seem to have been resolved as of (08-12-14). I am happy with my purchase.

Yes, I would recommend this product to a friend.",1407801600,7,949,4.538011695906433

5863133,4,B00DXOIEFI,"I was waiting on this boxed set for quite a while.  I mean, I read a lot of negative reviews about it and was considering not buying it.  But, what's the alternative...buying each season separately in a plain blu-ray box?

My expectations were pretty low, but I decided at $160 it was actually cheaper than buying the season individually...so how bad could it actually be?

It's true that the box is faux wood, with a faux brand of the show's logo.  But, seriously what do people expect to get?  A finely crafted oak box?  People are unrealistic in what they expect.  I will say that if this set was selling for $350-$400, I would expect something more.

Anyway, for $160, this is really a nice set despite the cheap look.  I'm very pleased with it.  I am considering actually making my own box out of quality wood.  It would take me hours and probably cost $50 in material.  But, that's my solution to the faux wood.

The paper glued to the lid of the box is just plain stupid.  I don't know what that's about.  I'd tear it out if I didn't think it would look worse afterwards.  It really is ugly and pointless.

I like how they got the order correct.  (some have complained about this)  If you looked at the way Dexter kept his trophies, he organized them from the hinge of the box towards the front...filling them in from the back first.  This is how it should be.
The little strip of paper that identifies (numbers) the slots is tacky and unnecessary however.",1407283200,5,1463,4.424812030075188

5863173,3,B00DXOIEFI,"Great series, we love Dexter.  Even the last two seasons where the show seemed to jump the shark.  My issue with this collection is the horrible cheap packaging. The slide case is made of cheap thin cardboard and practically speaking it's kind of a waste of space.  The quality of the slide case inhibits my desire to display it proudly on a shelf in our tv room and the size of the DVD ""slides"" prohibits storing them in the slots of our DVD bookshelf.

5863176,3,B00DXOIEFI,"Talk about overkill in packaging design...this thing is huge and takes up a lot of space. Unless you're planning a shrine to Dexter on your mantle, you'll probably end up storing the discs in two-sided sleeves like I did. Plus, the book doesn't fit in the box with the discs, so you better find someplace else to put that. Great show, but just silly packaging.",1405814400,2,360,4.553846153846154

I have the real blood slide box from the show so I am a fan of details. It is tough cardboard with a metal latch. The inside has plastic slots for the disk.

Its very nicely packaged, and very heavy so, you may want to think carefully about where you display the box.

Box is made to resemble Dexter blood slide box, it looks pretty good, holds all the blu rays in a clear tray with a red insert - looks like a blood sample.

The actually transfers of all seasons are amazing, i have owned a few TV series before and the transfer and grain was too much to bear( Chuck , i am lookin at you!!)

Rounding out the collection is the Graphix artbook about the series itself, beautifully made, I would gladly display it on a coffee table.

The ""slide"" box is not wood but it is still good quality. The artwork booklet that came with it was also a great addition to the series, it had great photos that were full of detail.

5863253,5,B00DXOIEFI,"I saw this set on a Deal of the Day and had to jump on the deal. I love this box set because it is clever (fans of the show will know why). It also feels solid, despite the fact that it is not truly a wooden box. The box is made of a heavy cardboard, and with care should last a great deal of time. The graphic book is a nice addition. However, you will probably look through it once and then forget about it. It only contains promotional photos and no behind the scene shots. There is also a minimal amount of text in the book. There are only two downsides to this set (excluding the fact that it is not a real wooden box. They were able to manufacture wooden boxes for the coaster set, so why not for this?) One downside is that the box is very, very large. It is larger than a shoe box and it is heavy. It is very obvious looking at the product, that some of the box could have been trimmed to reduce the size a bit. I have no idea where I am going to display this. It is that large (13 3/4"" L, 7.5""W, 6"" H)! Also, the CD ""cases"" are not actual cases. They are the back portion of CD cases and they do not hold the DVD's very well. I do not know if this was done to cut corners, but for such an expensive set, it is unacceptable. It is inevitable that some of the DVD's will fall out. So be mindful of this and be very careful. The CD cases also have a large clear sticker on the back of them with red blood splatter. These stickers come off very easily when you remove the cases and place them back into their respective slots. This could have been improved upon.

I have not gone through the extras yet, so I cannot comment on that. The series is great though (despite the questionable ending). This set is worth it if you can get it at a decent price (less than $120).",1400198400,2,1774,3.9831460674157304

I loved it.  Granted the box is not actual wood, for those that believed it to be its not.
But I like the way it was designed and set up.  I organized the blu-rays from first to last season and theres enough slots in the box for everything.  I got this for $110 when it was on a deal of the day so its a no-brainer for me. Some of these sets are quite expensive, no way would I pay $250+ for any of these sets.

5863299,5,B00DXOIEFI,"This is an excellent TV series -- my whole family found something to love! My son still does Batista on Halloween (doesn't hurt that he's the spitting image!) Even my parents enjoyed Dexter. the character development is unparalleled, except perhaps for Breaking Bad.. The examination of what makes a person who he is.. is it genetics? experience? essence? will power? fate? is pretty profound for a TV show. The expertly-timed revelations regarding Dexter's 'father'  and the increasingly complicated relationship with Deb, his sister, lead us down the rabbit hole of identity and what it means. One is left to consider whether the serial killer was created in that shipping container that day as a toddler, or because of the guidance of the father. What if the father had been a better man himself? What if he had believed in his son more - tried harder - tempted fate with more faith or force of will? What if Dexter had not had so much respect for his father that he obediently allowed his patterns of behavior/personality/identity to be forged by him to such an extent? What if Deb had not also so blindly loved her father? The mirrors and foils throughout the series are also expertly crafted: dexter/deb, dexter/brian, his half-brother, rita/deb, rita/ lila (fire girl, dexter/ Saxon (the psychiatrist's son)...
Given how popular Dexter is, and how much secret or not so secret pleasure the audience derives from his kills, perhaps we each and all should give a little shudder when we look in our own mirrors..
If you like Dexter, you should watch Breaking Bad, for sure, which also travels in the constellation of identity and experience vs essence and in that constellation of course also the inescapable black hole or maw of violence..
By the way, I didn't think much of the last season of Dexter, and the finale was terribly disappointing to me. But I didn't think it fair to drop it from five to four stars just on that account.",1396051200,,1939,4.8053892215568865

Seems to me it was manufactured as cheaply as possible with the intention of making it appear sharp, sturdy, and very appealing.  On opening the package, three or four of the discs were loose, unattached to the square holders, and maybe that explains why one of the discs doesn't play---that is, maybe it got damaged  as it bounced its way to my house, rolling and jiggling about in the box.  I'll have to replace that disc somehow as Amazon's policy on ""once you open it it's yours"" obviates their taking any responsibility for it.  There may be more damaged discs, as I haven't gotten through all of them. This all makes the package worth about half or a quarter of what I paid, to my mind.  Disappointing.

A couple were warped such that they rubbed inside the player making a loud scratching sound when played, others had surface defects which caused screen flickering and image distortion, making it very hard to watch the episodes on those disks.

The DVD holder is cardboard so it's going to last about five minutes and it incredibly long (I know, I know; it's carrying 8 seasons) but it almost falls off my book shelves; maybe they wanted me to stick in the air condition unit like in the show...IDK.  For me, the art book sucked - I mean they are just pictures of the cast posing for the camera ( I threw it) i would have much rather have appreciated blood spatter patterns (since that is his profession).

5863475,1,B00DXOIEFI,"The programme is awsome the box set is diabolical.

On all the sites Ive been it looks a very deep and sinister blood red colour. Even I was firmly in the camp of I want one of those

My first impression when I saw the box set was, have I ordered the correct one to which I was certain I had. As she so excitedly unpacked everything and opened the box it slowly became very much apparent that I have just spent a small fortune on something so horrifically made on the cheap. I even had that sinking felling, the gulp and the knot in my stomach when I came to realise what I had actually purchased and let me tell you I was a hell of a lot more expensive when I purchased it, than it is now and I had to pay 95 (yes thats right) to import it. But it still came out cheaper than most places in the UK to get this from, but not by much mind.

Whoever made this should be ashamed of them selves. The colour is not as deep as many of the pictures I have seen promoting this product. This is not so much of an issue as that is to do with how the product has been photographed so Ill let that slide.
But as for the rest, OH MY DAYS. The box is toughened CARDBOARD WITH WOOD PRINT. It has brass or brass coloured clasp and hinges to which in my mind won't stand the test of time in the cardboard housing. The DVD are housed in cheap plastic sleeves, inside the box is more cheap plastic to keep the DVD in the top again is cardboard with wood print with more cheap plastic. It also looks like a blind man assembled it in a hurry. I was so embarrassed when my gorgeous girl opened it you didn't have to be a mind reader, it was written all over my face. For the small fortune it cost to buy it I am astounded by the poor build quality. If they did want to make it cheap then use cheap wood. It last and looks a hell of a lot better than cardboard. This is a COLLECTORS EDITION BOX SET and you expect for the money some sort of quality to the product you have just purchased. I feel I have a collectors edition box set knock off a dodgy market stall. I was left deeply embarrassed about the whole thing and feel very much as if I have been conned and very angry. This was a birthday gift otherwise I would have sent it back, but did not open it for obvious reason.
Dont bother wasting your money. I cant see it lasting long unless you put it in a glass sealed box out of the sunlight where know one can see your embarrassingly cheap attempt at a collectors edition box set.

I will know be attempting to make one from REAL WOOD.

Shame on you.

Oh btw saw the review about this box set not being for their Zone/region they are from. All I have to say to that is you are a fool and should not be shopping on line if you it gives you all you need to know on the page look:

By the way the bloodslide dvd's box is not wooden, it's plastic. I know that could be a disappointment for some of you, but just think about how much it would weight if it was wooden. It would be impossible to mail and the cost would be much higher than it already is.

5863533,4,B00DXOIEFI,"I read many of the reviews before I bought this set so I knew what to expect. I think the idea is awesome to have a complete Dexter set that appears like his box of blood sample files. The box itself looks nice and seems quite sturdy even though it is made out of thick compressed cardboard with an imitation wood texture. It probably would have been more thrilling if the box had been made out of real wood as was used in the cage for the Land of the Giants complete set, nevertheless it is still nice and probably lighter this way. The disc holders slide easily into plastic slots and each has a blood sample image on the backside of the disc holder which is a separate piece of thin plastic attached to the back of the disc holder. These disc holders have no top side. It might have been slicker if the blood sample was one and the same as the disc holder, or to have coloured the disc itself red. Individual dividers separate the seasons. Sturdy hinges and a latch made out of metal complete the box. Also included is a 44 page book of photos with images of Dexter and other actors from the tv show. A bonus disc has special features for each season, as well two short special features, including ""The Code"", and ""Evolution of Dexter Morgan"", and a 67 minute feature entitled ""Rubin Museum of Art Special Presentation with Michael C. Hall"" which has an interesting discussion between Hall and psychologist/author Kevin Dalton about serial killers and psychopaths and the Dexter character. The box set is quite large at about 14""x7""x 6"". The cardboard on the front, back, top and bottom are about 1/4"" and the sides are 1"" in width.
This box set looks quite impressive and elegant beside my other cardboard box sets of the Alfred Hitchcock Masterpiece Collection, the complete Battlestar Galactica, the definitive collection of the Twilight Zone,  and the complete series of Deadwood.",1387238400,5,1887,4.616071428571429

I love this set none of the product was damaged in shipping and it looks great. For the price its a great collection as opposed to buying all eight seasons at once. I didn't get into the show before it was cancelled so I did not have any of the sets.

The first and most important thing to take away from this review is: THE BLOOD SLIDE BOX IS NOT WOOD!!! It is contact ""wood looking"" paper over cardboard, some plastic and whatever else.  Isn't the idea of this box set  to have it as an awesome display piece?!?! God forbid this gets a little damp, or accidentally banged into, its going to take nothing to ruin this ""box"".  Now lets talk the ""blood slides"" that hold the blu-rays.  These discs are housed in an open faced dvd case with a clear plastic backing with a blood design glued on by 4 extremely small dabs of glue.  This came shipped with none of them broke, and no scratches on the discs, which I am extremely surprised at.  All it's going to take for the backing ""blood"" side of the case is some mild use, and the actual case will no doubt crack on a single impact drop on the floor.  Not all is lost on this set though... The book ""Grafix: The Art of Dexter"" is absolutely gorgeous, the book is covered in a nice glossy finish and the pictures include everything from the promo shots, to fan submits, to the season main shots.  The bonus disc is also a nice perk for purchasing the box set with some nice inside looks.  Bottom line, this is my favorite show, enjoyed by so many of my close friends and family members.  Am I glad that I have every episode in stunning blu ray quality to watch at anytime I desire? Absolutely.

Not only IS IT CHEAP but it looks it. I was embarrassed to let anyone see it nevermind disclose what I had paid for it. It is not even finnished nicely - you can see the white edges of the plastic covering where it isn't quite stuck down right. Can't see this box lasting long.

5863576,4,B00DXOIEFI,"""Dexter"" is a story that analyzes Humanism and inquires what constitutes morality through the depiction of a moral serial killer stopping immoral killers and numerous forces constantly seek to condemn such questionable actions.  It is based off Jeff Lindsay's novel: ""Darkly Dreaming Dexter""; a reading of this literature provides significant insight on the reasoning for the TV show's controversial social commentary.  This review rates each season of Dexter and provides an overall series rating derived from: a baseline that is established by the first season, and the entertainment trend that provides viewers with stories containing ""grey"" commentary instead of ""black and white"" commentary.  Such an analysis is meant to cater to people who: have never read the novel, do not know anything about the show, have heard about the ""immorality"" of the character Dexter Morgan, and are debating whether to watch the series.

FACTORS OF CONCEPTION

In 2006, ""Dexter"" joined the entertainment trend that expedited ""grey"" social commentary: stories encompassing characters that lied, blatantly manipulated others, questioned religious institutions, broke the law, stole, tortured, and killed.  It can be debated when this trend first began, but it is clear: various genres of TV shows from a decade before paved the way for ""Dexter.""  Series like: ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", ""Angel"", ""The Sopranos"", ""24"", ""The OC"", ""Dead Like Me"", ""House M.D."", ""Weeds"", and the revived ""Doctor Who""; contained key characters who could not easily be defined as ""good and moral"" because they became less moral as their story progressed; thus TV shows were parting from the strict ""black and white"" commentary found in many shows from the 1950s-1980s era.  ""Dexter"" broke all boundaries of this trend by telling the story of Dexter Morgan who is a serial killer that: 1. holds a moral code that dictates his choice of actions, and 2. truly loves those closest to him.
The novel ""Darkly Dreaming Dexter"" provides a comprehensive explanation to the reasoning and acts of Dexter Morgan; it is highly recommended one reads this book to obtain the explanation for it is a great aide to further understand the TV show.  ""Darkly Dreaming Dexter"" is piece of literature filled with metaphorical use of storm conditions,  and it contains a literary technique that caricatures the negative stereotypes of: adoption and murderers.  Negative stereotypes of adoption and murderers are often coupled to claim: 1. adopted children cannot be trusted, 2. adopted children are likely to murder their adoptive family therefore; leave orphaned children in the foster care system, and 3. murderers have no humanity thus they should be shunned.  Caricaturing these claims, ""Darkly Dreaming Dexter"" refutes the negative stereotypes about adoption and murderers.
What results is commentary stating: 1. adopting children is better than leaving them in the foster care system, and better than leaving them with biological parents who are malefactors; because with the proper parenting, adopted children can be raised to be good, 2. adopted children will not murder their family but will actually be loyal to loved ones, and 3. murderers can hold morals which dictate their actions thus one must question if murderers can be simply labeled as bad and evil.  Such commentary is presented through a story that informs readers that as young children, Dexter Morgan and his brother lost key parts of their humanity when they witnessed their mother's murder.  This traumatic event manifests the brothers' need to kill, and the orphaned brothers end up in two different social environments in which they are raised.  Dexter is adopted, but his brother is left in the foster care system.  Under the guidance of his adoptive father, Dexter learns a moral code that controls his need to kill; the code calls for the vetting of immoral serial killers in order to gain comprehensive justification for their murder.  Lost in the foster care system, Dexter's brother is denied the teaching of such a code and in turn becomes an immoral serial killer.  The story culminates with the two brothers reuniting in a violent confrontation with social commentary that argues: Dexter is the better person; though he is a murderer, Dexter acquired a moral code to dictate his actions that resulted from a social environment of a caring adoptive family.

A key feature in ""Darkly Dreaming Dexter"" is the manifestation of an entity that only communicates with Dexter: the Dark Passenger.  The Dark Passenger can speak to Dexter in his mind or materialize itself as a visual representation of another person, and its main goals are to justify Dexter's actions and ensure Dexter's survival.  This entity is also a key feature in the TV series: the Dark Passenger exists in Dexter's psyche, it appears as Dexter's loved ones who have died, justifies Dexter's actions, and functions to keep Dexter alive.  Understanding the novel's: caricaturing, metaphors, social commentary, and key feature of the Dark Passenger aids in the comprehension of stories in the TV series.

SEASON 1 = five stars

The first season receives five stars due to its overall accurate adaptation of ""Darkly Dreaming Dexter.""  The season strays slightly from the novel's story, it provides needed elaboration of events depicted in the novel, implements the novel's use of metaphorical storm conditions, holds the exact social commentary from the novel, and it only makes one blatant but acceptable alteration to the novel's story.
The show's storyline accounts that Dexter is a blood splatter analyst for a Miami police department and he is hiding his true nature from all he cares about.  His adoptive sister Deb is unaware of Dexter's secret need because their adoptive father excluded her from witnessing the instruction of Dexter's moral code.  Deb is a police officer who is also employed at the Miami police department and the entire department ends up having to track a serial killer who leaves victims drained of blood, sliced into pieces, and frozen.  Dexter and Deb are very close and they both support each other as they each pursue meaningful relationships with other people.
The characters are well cast, the story is well written, intensity keeps viewers highly engaged, resolution is delivered but also entices one to learn what happens next, and the season is a nice contrast to the crime shows: Law & Order, CSI, Monk, and Bones.

SEASON 2 = four and a half stars

The second season depicts events which transpire when Dexter's past murders are discovered by the Miami police.  The police do not know who actually committed the murders, therefore they engage in a large scale manhunt.  What ensues is a cat and mouse chase between Dexter and investigators which entails: an officer coming incredibly close to identifying Dexter as the killer, Deb falling for one of the investigators, the emergence of a lone woman who becomes captivated by Dexter; therefore is willing to kill to protect him, and Dexter conducting acts to elude adversaries so he may maintain meaningful relationships with his girlfriend Rita and her children.
A four and half stars rating is due to a loss of social commentary that compares adopted children to foster care children, and the slight loss of comparing degrees of morality between murderers.  The first season made these comparisons in a very philosophical manner because it incorporated the same type of philosophy that is masterfully presented in ""Darkly Dreaming Dexter.""  But the second season of ""Dexter"" no longer used the novel as source material because the first season had engulfed it all; therefore the show's writers had to develop new material, but the writers were unable to present it in the same manner as author Jeff Lindsay.
Characters remain well cast, the story well written, intensity keeps viewers highly engaged, resolution is delivered and once again gives enough enticement to learn what occurs next.

SEASON 3 = four and half stars

The third season accounts the events of Dexter confronting two separate serial killers; one is an unidentified lone wolf and the other is a government official.  The entire Miami police become determined to prevent all the murders, and Dexter's secret need clouts his choices of: individually stopping the killers, or collaborating with his police department's pursuit of the killers.  Deb continues to interact with various lovers, struggling to find a person who can understand her.  Dexter and Rita determine they are in love and the two get married.
A four and half star rating is given because the season clearly demonstrates it would be incredibly difficult to obtain the first season's same amount of intensity and its comprehensive philosophy regarding murderers' morals.  However, philosophy about trusting others successfully replaces this loss with a culmination of Dexter finding love and being able to start a family of his own.
The characters are well cast, the story is well written, intensity keeps viewers highly engaged, and an incredibly happy resolution is given but also produces concern for future events.

SEASON 4 = four stars

This season depicts Dexter performing a comprehensive vetting process of a serial killer who has successfully established a familial cover life thus preventing Dexter from easily stopping the killer.  During this vetting, Dexter's own child Harrison is born adding to Dexter's role as a father figure and his role as a husband to Rita.  Deb obtains information that could put her on path to discover Dexter's moral code.  A key distinction in this season is the occurrence of the killer learning of Dexter's identity which enables the killer to severely harm Dexter and Dexter's loved ones.  As this conflict unfolds, Miami police officials engage in romantic endeavors.
A four stars rating is given because the depiction of police romance detrimentally slows down the intensity of the conflict between Dexter and the serial killer.  It is debatable if the romance is needed: it does balance out the immense intensity of Dexter's pursuit thus gives viewers a breather, it develops the characters of police officers, but it is not written well for it feels forced which leads one to question if the romance is simply filler, and it completely destroyed the possibility of having viewers on a non-stop thrill ride; thus one can argue that the romance is not needed and should have been edited out.
The characters are well cast, when present; intensity keeps viewers highly engaged, intriguing philosophy about trust remains, the season presents the show's first cliffhanger, but part of the story's writing feels forced.

SEASON 5 = five stars

This season tells of a young woman who is captured by a cult of killers, is rescued by Dexter, and then works with Dexter to take down the cult.  Such an excursion brings the two incredibly close to one another, and it causes Deb to increase her inquiry about Dexter's actions.
A five star rating is bestowed due to the return of social commentary that compares the degrees of morality between murderers.  The casting of actress Julia Stiles vamps up this demonstration because Stiles masterfully portrays reasonable justification for becoming a murderer.  Philosophy about trust becomes even more comprehensive, high intensity is consistent throughout the season, characters are masterfully casted, quality of writing is wonderful, and resolution results with the right degree of enticing viewers to ponder how Dexter will influence people in the next season.

SEASON 6 = four and half stars

Events detail the actions of religious extremists who kill to bestow religious judgment upon victims thus causing Dexter and the Miami police to pursue counter measures.  Deb becomes seriously involved with a lover and stumbles upon an event that would clearly inform her about Dexter's moral code.
Four and half stars results from inconsistent intensity in this season, however new intriguing philosophy about religion is given.  Social commentary about degrees of morality between types of murderers becomes more controversial thus more thought provoking; it makes a daring move to comment on religious extremists.  Dexter's character is further developed by his own inquiry about faith in religion and his pondering of the possibility of obtaining divine forgiveness.  Such an endeavor is a story arch that carries into the next season.
Characters are well cast, intensity varies, intriguing new philosophy is bestowed, writing is of good quality for it masterfully toys with viewers, and the season ends with a cliffhanger.

SEASON 7 = four and half stars

This story introduces a serial killer who intrigues Dexter and leads to his understanding of the killer's motives; Dexter then emotionally struggles with how to stop the killer.  Deb and a separate police officer uncover some of Dexter's past and recent actions resulting in a climatic confrontation between Dexter, Deb, and the officer.
A rating of four and half stars is bestowed due to a lack of consistent intensity.  Though it is debatable if Dexter's comprehensive vetting of the killer can be considered to be intense, some events resulting from the vetting are less intense than others.  But new philosophy about what constitutes love is given and it is delivered in a very intriguing manner: Dexter's ability to love is further developed.  Social commentary about the degrees of morality between types of murderers remains strong, characters are well cast, writing is of good quality, and the season resolves with a surprise ending.

SEASON 8 = four stars

Accounts of this season entail Deb hating Dexter after learning about some of his questionable actions and this confrontation clouts Dexter's ability to catch a serial killer that is acquiring parts of victims' brains.  Distinct to this season is the implementation of a mother figure to Dexter who helps him see his own goodness and defines the need for Dexter's actions in an incomprehensible world.
A four stars rating is given because this season has a slow storyline, the killer is not as intriguing as past ones, however; advocating for placing children with a caring adoptive family is bestowed just as it was in the first season.  Catching the killer is not the focal point of this season, justifying the need for a person like Dexter and advocating for caring foster families; is the sole aim of this final season.  Such justification is given through the various ways conflicts are resolved between Dexter and his loved ones, and given with social commentary delivered by a new mother figure.  This season masterfully incorporates metaphor to bestow justification and represent conflict within Dexter's psyche; such use of metaphor pays tribute to its use in ""Darkly Dreaming Dexter.""  The season also masterfully toys with viewers' expectations.
Characters are well cast, intensity varies, writing is of fair quality for it is slow but masterfully toys with viewers and uses metaphors as well as surprises, and the series has an ending that is left open to interpretation.

SERIES RATING = four stars

""Dexter"" receives four stars, which is a very good rating for an eight season duration.  Such a rating results because the series puts forth much needed social commentary about the ""grey"" of humanity.  The show masterfully refutes the existence of a ""black and white"" world thus thoughtfully examines what constitutes a definition of ""right and wrong.""  Such an analysis is delivered through controversial but explanatory events that do cause Dexter to grow as a human being and become free of his Dark Passenger.  The existence of controversial events may cause individuals who consider themselves as very moral thus are very judgmental of others; to be unable to comprehend the show's social commentary, but individuals who are open minded to the need to question what actually constitutes morality and are less judgmental of other people; are more likely to comprehend the show's position on what defines ""good and bad"", ""right and wrong"", and ""black and white.""

""Dexter"" is also welcomed because it helped set the groundwork for various genres of TV shows which followed its premiere.  Shows like: ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"", ""Breaking Bad"", ""Nurse Jackie"", ""The Vampire Diaries"", ""The Secret Circle"", ""Nikita"", ""Boardwalk Empire"", ""Game of Thrones"", ""Homeland"", ""Scandal"", ""House of Cards"", ""Hostages"" and ""Bonnie and Clyde: Dead and Alive""; contain major characters that cannot easily be defined as ""good or bad"" thus leads one to question what actually constitutes ""right and wrong.""  Series such as these are in debt to the conception of ""Dexter.""",1384819200,2,16705,5.203731343283582

But now there's THIS, which is a novelty and may have video extras unavailable to those of us who buy individual seasons. Too many of us longtime ""Dexter"" fans have been buying the Blu-rays or the DVDs all along, and it would be foolish to spend $200+ just for the final season or 2. I own most seasons of ""Dexter"" on Blu-ray, and the picture is quite crisp and Daniel Licht's amazing music sounds fantastic, so I highly recommend the entire series to fans of the show. And, interestingly, I've found that one can go back to an old season and enjoy it almost as much as you did the second and third times, which can't be said about too many other shows these days. Follow-up: I have since bought my missing 3 seasons of ""Dexter,"" so now I have all 8. But wish they would collect all the extras on a single disc we can buy.

Little overpriced honestly for the collection. Although, Dexter is the best show of the best decade and one of the best of all-time in my humblest opinion. I've been addicted with the show since I found out about it.

5863596,3,B00DXOIEFI,"So I just received this in the mail and I was really excited to see how it came out. I was happy and disappointed at the same time. Overall the product looked very nice and is an awesome addition to my Dexter Collection, but I felt it could have been much better.

The Box:

Very nice, it has ""Dexter: The Complete Series"" printed on both sides. The ""wood"" finish isn't really wood, but a paper cover instead. The numbering on the inside is also paper. It Top of the box starts at ""1"" but the bottom of the box starts with ""42."" That may be hard to understand but it doesn't seem like it should be that way. The only problem I had was the top and bottom of the box didn't line up. The top was a little shorter than the bottom.

The Inside:

This is what disappointed me the most. The ""Blood Slides"" that held the disc in was only one sided. Half of my DVD's were already popped out and it was frustrating. I don't know why they could have added a second side to secure the disc inside. Another thing, though minor, was the fact that there was a clear, transparent ""thing"" I don't want to say paper but I can't think of the word right now. It was placed on the other side of the disc holder to make it look like a blood slide. It had a red circle and gave it the real feel, but instead of imprinting it on the case, it was taped on to the back. Some of the slides didn't match up with each other so that was frustrating as well.

The Grafix Art Book:

It was a nice addition, it just added some artwork and photos that were taken throughout the seasons of Dexter. It even had the season prints that I really liked. It was a nice addition but nothing super special.

Overall, I still think it is a very nice product, maybe not worth the $219 price tag, but if the price ever drops, I would definitely buy it. This is a piece of Dexter Memorabilia that you will be glad to make apart of your collection.

Something changed from Season 7 to this collection. For this price, you should at least get a collection that will last longer than a year.

5863618,1,B00DXOIEFI,"I excitedly ordered this set for one of my favorite shows ever way back in August, as soon as it became available for preorder.  I was willing to pay the asking price of around $225 at that time.

However that was before the show concluded with what is in my opinion not only the WORST ending in television history, but also a steep decline in the writing, design, direction, and steerage of this show over the entire last season; heck it was going downhill even before that; the new ""showrunner"" should have his title changed to showRUINER.  He did a great job of ruining this show.

The final season was so absolutely horrible, just terrible boring melodrama, with numerous plot twists that went nowhere and a storyline that defied any sense of, well, anything, that I just cannot in good conscience pay top dollar for this set and support the idiots who destroyed this show.

Here's a brief overview of my opinions on each season.
*Spoilers Below*
Season 1: Awesome season. Everything was done right. 10/10
Season 2: The girlfriend, Lila, was kinda annoying, but that was the point. Also, Doakes remains one of the best characters in TV history. 9.5/10
Season 3: I actually enjoyed this season. Miguel Prado was a great addition to the story, and it was pretty cool to see Dexter take on a sidekick. For some reason, people dislike this season. 8.9/10
Season 4: Obviously one of the best seasons of television. Awesome villain. If the series ended here, all would be great. But, Scott Buck had to take the reins. 10/10
Season 5: Here's where things go downhill. Lumen, the girlfriend, was fine. The villain(s), however, were not. They weren't intimidating at all, unlike previous villains. Cool ending though. 8/10
Season 6: Probably my least favorite season. It had the worst killer in the series' history. And the whole plot was ""Dexter tries to find religion"". WTF? It did have one of the best season finales though. 6/10
Season 7: I, for one, liked this season. Quinn's girlfriend disappears into thin air for no reason, but it was an overall good season. La Guerta definitely made this season stand out. 8.5/10
Season 8: I thought it had decent intentions, but terrible execution. You felt everything building up to an epic finale where everybody finds out that Dexter is a serial killer, but nope. Lumberjack. Nuff said. This season will go down as one of the WORST series finales in TV history. 5/10",1381881600,16,1777,4.791530944625407

Read reviews for the final season online. Go to forums and see what fans had to say. I don't know of any other show that took such a nosedive in quality. It wasn't just the finale that was awful, the entire final season was embarrassingly cringe-worthy.

The final season is a meandering bore. The writing is horrible. The plot lines are offensively stupid.  Plots are contrived, illogical, and completely defy common sense. It's as though they're deliberately trying to insult your intelligence.

Instead of spending $200+ on this box set, take your money and flush it down the toilet. You'll get more entertainment and feel less insulted.",1381536000,24,878,4.9523809523809526

5863624,2,B00DXOIEFI,First of all I will say this is a very cool concept the way the series is packaged.

5863626,5,B00DXOIEFI,"What a sad year 2013 turned out to be for television. Breaking Bad and Dexter both ending within the same month. Dexter is one of the greatest shows ever, and this box set looks so cool! I love the design, which they based off the blood slide box that Dexter keeps inside his air conditioner, containing all of his trophies. The special features that are new to the complete set include:

- Behind-the-Scenes Cast Interviews, Features and Promos.
- The Evolution of Dexter Morgan, an all new documentary chronicling the titular character of Dexter and his dark passenger.
- The Code, an all new documentary featuring the creation of Dexter Morgan and his world.
- Exclusive Grafix book featuring artwork and photography from 8 seasons of Dexter.
- Unique box set design based on Dexter's blood slide box from the show. A paper tab stands out to separate each season from each other.

To those who are coming new to Dexter, I cannot recommend this series enough. The show follows the path of Dexter Morgan, a serial killer who channels his dark urges onto the guilty. Dexter was different ever since he was a small child, and sensing the darkness inside of him, his police officer father, Harry Morgan, helped Dexter channel his desire to kill by teaching him a code, that dictates he only kill other murders. While many would think of Dexter as a monster, he still has a lot of humanity. In fact many times over the course of the series, you will find yourself emphasizing with Dexter, which is sort of the whole point of the show, that there's a little bit of him in all of us. Each season tells a different story, and brings Dexter into conversation with a different aspect of his dark side and how it relates to ""human"" issues.

Season One:
Season one introduces us to Dexter Morgan and the people he surrounds himself with. We are introduced to his girlfriend Rita and her two children, which he describes as more of a disguise or normalcy than anything else. He also has a foul mouthed adopted sister named Deborah, or ""Deb"" for short, who he describes as the only person that really loves him. The first season explores Dexter's hidden desire to be normal, to be accepted, and involves a game of cat and mouse between Dexter and another serial killer known as the Ice Truck Killer. As the season progresses Dexter learns more and more about his past, and about the terrible events that made him into a monster, and through doing so, he discovers a connection between himself and the Ice Truck Killer that goes far deeper than a passion for human dismemberment.

Season Two:
Season two opens with a twist, several months after killing his brother, Dexter is off his game, but he snaps to when the police have found Dexter's dumping ground for dead bodies, and have officially opened an investigation into the serial killer deemed The Bay Harbor Butcher. The season focuses mainly on Dexter trying to sabotage the police/FBI investigation from within. Given that he works as a blood spatter analyst for Miami Homicide, and that his sister is a detective, he is of course in a prime position to be on the inside track of the investigation. This is unfortunately complicated by the meddling of Sargent James Doax. Doax doesn't trust Dexter, as he believes he had a connection with the Ice Truck Killer, and has always sensed that there was something off about him. A large theme here is Dexter trying to juggle his life as a serial killer, while keeping it from Doax and the police, while simultaneously dealing with issues in his personal life. New to the cast is a dangerous woman named Lilah who becomes obsessed with Dexter's dark side. She's sort of depicted as Dexter's polar opposite. While Dexter has a thing for the cold and air conditioning, Lilah is a pyromaniac/pheliac who is obsessed with fire.

Season Three:
The third season focuses on Dexter as the family man. Learning in the first episode that Rita is pregnant with his child, Dexter tries to imagine what his life would be like as a father, and takes on an increasingly more parental role in the lives of Rita's children Aster and Cody, and even proposes to Rita. Dexter also takes on a sort of protege this season. He's able to make his first real friend, a district attorney named Miguel Prado, who believes that Dexter killed the man who murdered his brother. Dexter is initially delighted to have a real friend, and even takes Miguel out killing with him, however before long we start to see that two monsters can't really be together for too long before turning on each other, and Dexter and Miguel wind up at each others throats. The new serial killer this season is called The Skinner, and is rampaging around Miami doing exactly what you think, skinning people. He and Dexter really don't come into contact with each other until the end though, he serves more as a nemesis for Deb throughout most of the arc.

Season Four:
The fourth season is widely regarded as not only the best season of Dexter, but some of the best television ever filmed. This season focuses on Dexter trying to balance his new life as a father and husband with his other life as a murderer. The killer this year is known as Trinity, and is one of the oldest and most successful serial killers of all time. Trinity is also a family man, and Dexter believes that he can learn how to balance his two lives by studying him. This season demonstrates that you cannot be a father, husband, and killer. It either leads to the complete destruction of the family, as with Trinity, or constant lying and being stretched to the limit as with Dexter. Here we also see Deb begin to uncover the truth about who Dexter is, finding out that his brother was the Ice Truck Killer and about the way his mother was killed. The way that this season ends is one of the defining moments of the series. It's surprising, and brilliant, and tragic all at the same time. What makes the final scene so heartbreaking is that right before Dexter comes home to find what Trinity has done, he is speaking for the very first time every about someday having a life without his dark passenger. His final words too ""I'm what's wrong"" show the parallels between him and his sister Deborah.

Season Five:
Season five picks up immediately where season four left off. Beginning here we see Dexter trying to deal with Rita's death, and with the loss of his family, as Astir and Cody move away from Miami with their grandparents. Dexter bonds with a woman named Lumen Pierce, who was raped and tortured almost to death by a group of people, when Dexter kills her captor and rescues her. Dexter and Lumen eventually form a romance together. Unlike Rita, Lumen knows exactly who and what Dexter is and still loves him for it. We see more of Deborah beginning to subconsciously accept the real Dexter here, when she confides to him that she wants to kill the barrel girl murderers herself. She even allows the two killers to go free after discovering the body of one of their victims (not knowing that it was Dexter and Lumen). I have to say, this season surprised me with how good it was. I initially thought that seeing Dexter immediately hop to a new woman would be forced, but seeing them form an awkward killer bond, and watching Dexter his his own pain by helping her deal with hers is absolutely marvelous.

Season Six:
A lot of people didn't like season six, but I think it was just misunderstood. Taking place about a year after the events of season five, Dexter, whose life has finally reached a semblance of balance and order, now explores some of the greater mysteries behind the meaning of life, and if there can really be light within his darkness. The villains of this arc are two religious zealots who become known as the Doomsday killers. The Doomsday killers want to bring about the apocalypse by reenacting some of the more gruesome parts of the book of Revelations. Along the way we get to see some pretty narley murders, which is always fun. This season explores the best and worst aspects of religion, the worst in the form of the Doomsday killers, and the best in the form of a reformed murderer named Brother Sam, who teaches Dexter to look for the light in the darkness. The most memorable moment in the series comes in the final moment. I won't say it here, but it leaves us hanging on a huge cliff-hanger.

Season Seven:
Season seven picks up immediately where season six leaves off, Deborah has just witnessed Dexter killing Doomsday and he has some explaining to do. At first it seems Dexter is able to BS his way out of the situation, but by the end of the first episode Deb knows that he's a serial killer, and the Bay Harbor Butcher. This season has some of the best moments between the Morgan siblings. After all this time, we finally get to see Deborah and Dexter talk about who and what he is. The season centers a lot around Deborah trying to change Dexter, and then later coming to accept him for who he is. We also meet Hannah McKay, yet another blond that Dexter Morgan falls for. Hannah and Deborah spend a lot of time at odds, and Dexter finds himself having to choose between his sister and a woman that he might be in love with. Oh did I mention Hannah is also a serial killer?

Season Eight:
The final season disappointed a lot of the fans, and I'm sad to say that I do include myself in that. I won't spoil the ending, but the ending does a fairly decent job of ruining itself. It was just a bad way to close the series, a sour bite to and an otherwise fantastic meal. I still recommend Dexter to anybody though. We had many great years, and the show will always hold a special place in my heart.

My one beef with this box set, is that it's pretty expensive. I would wait for the price to go down, or maybe for black friday.",1379116800,24,9777,4.5494318181818185

I miss the show now that it's over. Of course, one of the great things about a TV series coming to an end is that you get a nice complete box set to commemorate the series. This ""Dexter"" complete collection is one of the nicest blu-ray set designs I've seen. One piece of advice: these box sets usually drop significantly in price as time goes on - I'd wait until Amazon has it as a Gold Box deal, or perhaps it will go on sale during Black Friday.

Here's what's included:
1. Blood Slide packaging (note: the box is not made of wood, although it looks as though it is).
2. ""Grafix"": The Art of Dexter book
3. Bonus Disc with New Special Features
- Behind-the-Scenes Cast Interviews, Featurettes and Promos
- ""The Evolution of Dexter Morgan"" Documentary
- ""The Code"" Documentary

If you like the show but don't yet own the seasons on blu-ray, then this is the perfect collection for you. If you've never seen the show, then I encourage you to give it a chance. I know some people who are put off by the premise of a blood spatter guy who moonlights as a serial killer, but I assure you the series is much more complex than that and you really enjoy the characters and the story. This blu-ray set is the perfect way for you to catch up with this great series.

Although it's not for everyone, I really enjoy the dark themes presented in the show. It's a constant struggle for Dexter to keep his work a secret -- he works for Miami-Metro Homicide department, surrounded by the very people looking for him. And while certain characters are glad that someone is ridding the world of bad people, there are many other characters who see Dexter's actions as an insult to law enforcement and the criminal justice system. Being the rational and peaceful person that I am... Dexter's actions on the show are not justified from my perspective. But it's still fun to watch someone on television who embraces the darker side of his personality and channels it to potentially rid the world of criminals. You are stunned to find that you come to like the main character - who would've thought that a killer could be this likable?

There are some seasons that are better than others (Seasons 3 and 4 are my personal favorites), but I think they are all worth a watch because each season is essential to the story. The show looks into Dexter's past traumas; sometimes the writers put him into adversarial relationships with other serial killers; and throughout the series Dexter is exposed to various ideas about family, fatherhood, and faith; and eventually his secret is discovered by those closest to him. It's all a marvel to watch unfold. This is one of the best shows and best performances on television.",1379030400,15,3098,5.140873015873016
5863648,5,B00DXOIEFI,"I've waited 8 years to get a collectors edition of Dexter the complete series in BR, and looks like it is finally out. I feel bad for all those people writing negative or 1 star reviews when it comes to this little treasure. Dexter is a great show. It is showtime's bestseller ever and if you compare this little bundle of joy vs every season in BR individually you'll end up paying practically the same.

Plus the little blood slide box that houses the disks couldn't get any better. Well worth the $$$. This is for serious Dexter fans out there and I really hope I am not disappointed when I get it in November :D",1378944000,3,615,4.301724137931035
5863649,4,B00DXOIEFI,"Some reviewers bemoan the high pre-order price for the Blu Ray set (about $320 at the time I'm writing this).  Don't pre-order at this price.  Wait until Black Friday, when Amazon offers many popular sets at significant markdowns.  Last year on Black Friday, Amazon had The Lord of the Rings complete extended editions blu ray set for $49.99 (list price $120), and similarly steep markdowns on The Dark Knight trilogy and complete Harry Potter on blu ray, and many others.  I wouldn't be surprised to see Amazon or other retailer offering the Dexter blu ray set for $199 on Black Friday or at some point during the holiday shopping season, and it would be a shame to have paid over $300 for it.

EDIT November 11, 2013:

Amazon is starting their black-friday deals early this year.  They've dropped the price of this set (Blu Ray version) from $320 in September to $270 in October to $220 now.

For $220, this set is worth considering:  it comes to $27.50 per season, plus you get a lot of cool extras and collectible packaging.

Will Amazon reduce the price even further?  They won't tell us.  So we have to guess whether $220 is the best deal we're gonna get.  Hold out a bit longer and you might save a few more dollars if they lower the price again--or they might raise it back to $270 or $320.  I'd rather not chance it.",1378944000,89,1325,4.489539748953975
5863650,5,B00DXOIEFI,"As a diehard Dexter fan, I have waited SO LONG for this limited edition collection to be offered. I avoided purchasing the individual seasons because I KNEW this would eventually be offered. I am SO PLEASED with the display case of this MUST HAVE DVD collection. The extra bonus DVD and the photo booklet are the reward for waiting for the series to end before buying. EXCELLENT price considering the number of discs and the extras that are included. Looking forward to years of enjoyment watching my favorite show over again!!!!",1377734400,3,529,4.824175824175824
5863651,1,B00DXOIEFI,"To each their own with Dexter. I was so excited when this gift set became avilable for pre-order as I could not think of a better homage to the show to display. I order eearly even when the price was way over $300, but now that the show has ended...things have changed. This WAS by far one of my favorite shows ever and yes there have been hit and miss story arcs, reocurring annoyingly flawed/unlikeable characters, and whole seasons for that matter. Then there is the whole La Guerta thing...if you read the first book..she dies...enough said. I would have loved the show even more if La Guerta had been left out and Debra was Lt from the beginning. Dexter in the first couple seasons was so meticulous, methodical, and scary. These last couple of seasons I have found myself saying...he had to leave hair, or blood, finger prints, or even saliva for that matter. This show often makes you think that the CSI Team is downright dumb in collecting DNA evidence. Yes Dexter may not be in the system, but for crying out loud there is definitely enough of his DNA that has been left pretty much everywhere since season 4.  I will not provide any spoliers and I'm sure if anyone does read this that they have now seen the series finale. The finale ruined the show for me. I will not be picking up any individual seasons because of the finale either. What were the writers thinking? Was this really the best ending they could have come up with? There is no culmination at all. The closing scene is by far the most disappointing. I get the symbolism but not the execution. Showtime failed and Dexter as a character no longer holds relevance for me.",1377648000,26,1642,4.510067114093959
5863652,4,B00DXOIEFI,"Only reason not to buy this particular set is the clearly missing AIR CONDITIONER. I would totally buy this at this price if it came with a large fake air conditioner that had a place to store this set. Then people be like ""why you have an air conditioner?""

5863653,2,B00DXOIEFI,"I haven't decided if I'm going to get this yet because I do have the first few seasons of Dexter on DVD. Even though seasons 3, 6, 7 weren't all that great in my opinion, I would still absolutely love to purchase the complete collection - especially in the bloodslide box. It's such an awesome and simple and easy complete collection idea for Showtime.

But to charge $330 for it? That's crazy talk. I can go and pickup Blu-Rays for $20-$25 on Amazon (probably less on eBay or such) and end up with the same product. Yes I do want everything else that comes with the complete collection - especially the box - and yes I'm willing to pay more for it. But that's an insanely high price it has now.

Awesome product, phenomenal show with some poor seasons, but stupid stupid price will probably deter me from purchasing.",1376438400,16,817,4.476510067114094

5863655,4,B00DXOIEFI,"i am so glad i have never bought a single season of Dexter on dvd or bluray, the only reason i am giving this 4 stars is the price but i am sure it will decrease. this set looks perfect for any Dexter Fan. I know it sucks for people who have purchased all the other seasons but this is the ultimate collection they could not release it before they finished all the seasons the only thing that people are missing that purchased it before are some new special features and a art book and a awesome case so i don't see why fans are mad, they should have known they would release something like this when they were done with there final season. if you guys want the extra stuff that comes with this than sell your old copies and get this. I am very happy with this release for i am a big fan of the show Dexter but have missed a few episodes here and there and never purchase any of the seasons so this Collection is perfect! cant wait to be able to watch every episode of Dexter in bluray nonstop and be able to store it in a awesome case and display my Dexter love!",1375142400,13,1063,4.066666666666666

Jumping ahead to June of 2018, I had a knee replacement and while recovering started watching DVDs. I started the Dexter series and was really enjoying it until I discovered that almost every third season was a repeat of a prior season. So I am able to watch seasons 1,2,4,6 and 8.

8598869,1,B00DXOIEFI,"What a complete joke of a product. This must be the worst purchase I have made online in my entire life. And I am 48 years old. How anyone who have purchased this complete fraud of a product can actually go on and say -""Sturdy Box"", ""Good Build Quality"", ""Looks Nice/Good"", well now, that is a greater mystery than the question of if we are alone in the universe or not. I consider myself a awake and critical able person, and I know what quality looks like, and this is not it. I received this awful piece of untalented hoaxery this afternoon, and yes, the ""Sturdy Box"" is now where it belongs; In the trash. Because that is what this is; A piece of trash that failed to dress up and pretend it was a piece of worth while merchendise. I do not know what goblin it was that put this terrible product together, but this is just awful. Anyone who would visit me and see this crap, which now will not happen, would without doubt ask me; ""You said WHAT?, You paid WHAT amount of money for this? Hahaha, ha ha ha..."".

The Box:
Crunched by Amazon and already broken before it left the US, and I know this because it was the inner cardboard  box that was broken after it had received a huge dent in it, while the outer box cardboard was fine. So, Amazon thrashed the product, and knew it was trashed, and then went on to send it to me. Thanks a lot. The fact that the ""Dexter Box"" was broken, did not influence my quick decision to throw it into the trash though. I do not know how to describe this joke of a ""Build"" really. It looks worse than cheap, it looks like a failed project a 8 year old would bring home from school. Awful pretend-wood kind of plastic horror, with ridiculous rubberish inside to hold the discs. I would not be caught dead having this ridiculous product in my living room, in my attic or in my outhouse, or where ever else. Its just sickening ugly and cheap looking. And anyone who say this is a fitting quality compared to the selling price, well think again. That is very wrong. I am willing to bet a lot on that this ""Box"" could have been built in real wood, glass, metal, with a really good look and feel, and still make a good profit, to the pricve this plastic horrorbox actually sells for.

Do not waste your time and money on this junk product. In my country at least, no store would put this terrible product on their shelf for sale unless it was 1/3 the price. I even doubt it would happen even then, because it just looks like what it is; Trash.

Because of this I am suspending my purchase habbits indefinately on Amazon. A shameful embarrasing product I would not have even if I got it for free.",1522454400,,2627,4.258517034068136
