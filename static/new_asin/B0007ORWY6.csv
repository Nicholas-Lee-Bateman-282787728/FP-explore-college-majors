8049983,5,B0007ORWY6,"Siempre Piel Canela is part of Banco Popular's annual video release. This is from 1997 I believe, and is about singer and composer Bobby Capo. Featured in this omage is a ton of famous musical artists like Tony Vega, Chayanne, and Andy Montanez to name a few. The artist's sing Bobby Capo's compositions dressed in 1940s and 50's clothes and the setting is NYC and Puerto Rico 1940's and 1950's club scene. Very nice, very educational and enjoyable. 90 minutes of music, and background information on the composer and occurrences in the music industry all while enjoying a present day rendition of the compositions. Oh, and after the credits roll, there are about 15 minutes of outtakes and behind the scene stuff. Great product.",1325548800,,729,4.887096774193548
