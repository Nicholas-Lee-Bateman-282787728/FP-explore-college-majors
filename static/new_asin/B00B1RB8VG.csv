5552409,5,B00B1RB8VG,"Being a fan of Last Exile this follow up series was of interest to me so I bought this Blu-ray/DVD bundle because I missed the original release of the Last Exile on Blu-ray and the prices are way too high until they re-release cheaper versions. I hadn't seen any of Fam, The Silver Wing at all so I am happy to realize i enjoy this continuation of the anime.

I like Fam and the new cast of characters and of course GONZO creates such beautiful animation. If you liked Last Exile and haven't seen this I think it would grow on true fans of the Last Exile world in time.

The limited edition art booklet is nice but it's more of a cute novelty more than anything else... better than nothing.",1379376000,,690,4.259541984732825
5552410,3,B00B1RB8VG,"Frankly, I loved the original Last Exile and mourned the possible loss of Dio as well as the death of the Captain.  Now we come to Fam, the Silver Wing and the confusion sets in.  I had hoped for an explanation of Dio's escape from death, but there was none.  Then we hear that former planet inhabitants have been coming in from the hourglass shaped world for hundreds of years, taking over territory that the inhabitants who never left earth have been working to unite and rebuild.  It's confusing because there is no apparent explanation of the time frame in which the story is being set.  When did the Anatore-Disith folks return?  Why do they all seem to be the same age as in the original story? SPOILER:  Why is one of the two leading characters in the previous story in a wheelchair asking whether he'll ever fly again?  I watched the complete series twice, just in case I had missed something; however, I don't believe I did.  So timeline confusion was a big negative for me along with lack of information about familiar characters who just seemed to pop up from nowhere.  The look of the film, the backgrounds and battles was just as good as before, but what is with the overly cutesy little girls who looked more like dolls that real people.  This version, sadly, seemed to be dumbed down but, I won't tell you not to buy it.  I did because I'm a fan of Last Exile.",1379289600,9,1375,4.434262948207171
5552411,3,B00B1RB8VG,"The world of Last Exile is one of the more interesting anime realms that I have come across and the original series remains a favorite of mine. The mix of steam punk and sound story-telling draw you in and make you love the stage and feel for the characters on it.

Fam, the Silver Wing looked to be an exciting continuation of that world, but it falls distressingly short. The primary problem comes in the narrative inconsistency and the rather pathetic characters. In what is otherwise a compelling story about empire and conflict - a story dripping in moral implications - the naivete of the protagonist and the nonsensical resolutions of poor moral choices make this almost unwatchable at times. There is nothing worse than having a show try to get you to feel bad for characters engaging in genocide. And it takes a good third of the series to fully explain how this timeline and the prior series ultimately relate, which is supremely confusing.

But for all that, the visuals are impressive, the narrative world is the same, and most of my favorite characters from the original series make great cameos. So I can't totally dislike this. But a word of caution to those who loved the original Last Exile: the experience just isn't the same.",1365033600,29,1244,4.728110599078341
5552412,3,B00B1RB8VG,"Ends in a predictable all female cast anime style way.

If you are a fan of the series, watch this for sure. In some ways its much better than the first. It also fills in some bits n pieces of what happened after the first ended. But where Fam fails is in the fact most of the cast is all female and the writers don't get creative with it. How characters react to things gets beyond predictable. They use tired out lines about stopping fighting and war...then when someone acts like you'd expect a person to do, everyone is horrified. Moments like: oh no, how could you take revenge on those who murdered so many people?!! You must be more evil than them! Oh how terrible you must be!! It really gets on your nerves later in the series because it just exposes the weaknesses in the characters even more.

Case in point, pay attention to Dian. She is the only character in the entire series who actually stays true to her character and doesn't compromise on it. Fam's head is always in the clouds and often spews idealistic nonsense. She is decent at first but as the worn out girl anime story arcs progress, it gets old. She is just too generic. If you've seen Bodacious Space Pirates or Symphogear, you've seen Fam. The rest of the characters only continue on into the generic.

Unfortunately this show aired during seasons where a lot of shows were all girl casting. This is likely where some of the disgust comes from as you get tired of watching the same generic characters over and over.

It is unfortunate with this show. The world and the setting is perfect. Huge battles take place and will keep you watching. Much more than the first show. If the weakness in the characters and story can be gotten over, it would get 5 stars in a heartbeat. It is a shame to have this series tarnished more with mediocrity such as this.

Overall, if you are a die hard fan, get it. There is a lot to like and good links to the original story. Many past characters do make appearances. But if you had issues with the original, like some do, or have never seen a Last Exile series. Go with rental. Also watch the first series before this. Some of the character crossover will mean a lot more.",1361232000,26,2182,4.391089108910891

But I didn't get it....",1520208000,,117,4.619047619047619
8561046,2,B00B1RB8VG,"Such a bore... already at episode 7 and I'm losing sooooooooooooooo much interest.  Even my favorite character Dio is boring... and Dio is NEVER boring.  If it wasn't for the fact that I wanted an explanation as to how Dio wasn't physically RIPPED APART in The Grand Stream, I wouldn't have watched this at all.  I would have let the original stand alone by itself.  I always have a theory about movies and TV.  If I like the villains more than the heroes something is wrong with the story.  And judging from the fact that The Federation has a point, considering that those who left for Pester and came back to an abandoned ravaged planet earth after the federation rebuilt the planet, and now want to reclaim it as their own smacks of the children's story of ""the hen and her bread"".  This could have been sooooooooooooooo much better, especially since Dio has his freedom, he could have chosen to be the new Maestro and reformed The Guild.  Bet they, what do I know?",1451779200,,968,4.522988505747127

8561048,5,B00B1RB8VG,"Last Exile was the series I started that got me into anime, and while it wasn't perfect it will always hold a special place in my heart.
Years later, after doing some random googling, I stumbled upon the fact that there was a sequel to Last Exile, which was Fam of the Silver Wing, and it is not a letdown whatsoever.

If you haven't seen the first, you can still watch this (though it was amazing to see all the cameos of the characters from the old series, and I do recommend it).

To be honest, I'm certain there's a lot of nostalgia mixed in with this review, but even so, it's a phenomenal story in my book, and a flawless sequel for the first series,",1412553600,,656,4.198412698412699
8561049,4,B00B1RB8VG,"A decent follow-up to Last Exile. Some of the story is a little bit thin and many of the new characters fall into rather typical anime character archetypes. On the upside the new seires dosen't simply re-invent the original characters while major reapperances by characters from the first Last Exile are quite welcome. I particularly enjoyed the antagonist characters and the effort to show that there were no real ""bad guys."" Just many well intentioned people who found themselves walking a path that led them to a violent confrontation that could have been avoided.

The animation was quite good but the soundtrack and musical score don't stand up to the first Last Exile. Still I would recommend to long time fans and newcomers alike.",1391990400,,737,4.943548387096774
8561050,5,B00B1RB8VG,Great series lack of characters from the first season but still one of the better anime out there. Good stuff,1390089600,,109,4.5
8561051,5,B00B1RB8VG,This is great show...but first one was better tho. there are a lot of missing when it come to last exile.. I really need to read light novels but unforuately its in all Japanese. So there are no English version yet... But this show is great... has subtitles.,1389139200,,258,4.395833333333333
8561052,5,B00B1RB8VG,"I enjoyed season one quite a bit,  in season two, I feel the animation is marginally improved, and the story line compelling.  Some of the previous characters make cameos, but it's pretty much all new characters.  Dio and Tatiana Wesla are the most significant holdovers.  If you liked season one, I doubt you'd be disappointed by season two.  Looking forward to season three!  This is my second favorite anime series after Cowboy Bebop.",1388707200,,437,4.917808219178082
8561053,4,B00B1RB8VG,"Almost [85%] as good as the original!  That's actually saying quite a lot, as the original is rated almost perfect in my book.

I really enjoyed watching this, and I think I finished it in 4 sittings (^_^).  If you're a LE or Range Murata fan, this should be enjoyable.  Without putting in any spoilers, I'm glad that some of my favorite characters are back in this series, whilst still providing a [slightly] different story.

Not too much in terms of extras, but the reversible covers are always sweet, since they made such beautiful covers for the Japanese releases.  The included tiny little art book is nice as well - although it just makes me want to go get the real ones.

I only listen in the original language, so I can't comment on the dubs.",1381881600,,751,4.477941176470588
