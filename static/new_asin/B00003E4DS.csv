7918592,3,B00003E4DS,"I enjoyed the video simply because it gave a different setting for AC/DC than what I am accustomed to. However, most of the interviews focused on Angus Young and Brian Johnson with no interviews from the other members of AC/DC. I really admire Bon Scott's work with the group; it would have been fantastic to include interviews with Bon plus any concert or video footage. I was expecting to see some concert footage.
In some segments the film quality was poor, probably because some of the footage was so old. Sorry to say this but I think the portrayal of the band's history on VH1's ""Behind The Music"" had a lot more teeth than this video.
If anyone were looking for genuine concert material from this group, I would recommend; ""No Bull, Live - Plaza De Toros De Las Ventas, Madrid"" for Brian Johnson fans, and ""Let There Be Rock: The Movie"" for Bon Scott fans. Both of which I own, both of which are excellent.",984096000,4,913,4.506024096385542
