8555727,5,B00APOH5OA,"A different film. Committed director with the life of poor people makes this a very passionate film. Do not expect a light film, but something that let you thinking and shows a most realistic view of the life in slams.",1384387200,2,218,4.475
8555728,5,B00APOH5OA,"This is the latest from acclaimed Argentinean director Pablo Traper (`Carancho', and `Lion's Den') and he has teamed up with Ricardo Darin again who starred in `Carancho' but has graced some classics. This is about the work the Catholic Church does in deprived areas. Set in the slums of Buenos Aires in a place known as `Villa Virgin'; where they have been trying to build a community hospital since 1937.

Father Julian (Darin) is working with his long time friend father Nicolas (Jeremie Renier -`The kid with a bike', `My Way' and `In Bruges'); they are helped by volunteers one of which is an atheist social worker in it for socialist reasons. They have to deal with the drug gangs and turf wars, a police force that is as violent as the gangs and grinding poverty. We also have questions of faith and Sainthood and the inevitability that action for change will always lead to conflict.

This is one of those films that unashamedly pulls on your heart strings, and it certainly got mine. The musical score is excellent as well as is the soundtrack. All of the acting is par excellence and it is obvious that for some of the cast they had never been in front of a camera before. Darin is a tour de force as always but Jeremie Renier has genuine on screen chemistry with Martina Gusman playing the social worker Luciana (she too was in `Carancho'and `Lion's Den').  The issues it tackles it does so in a grown up way but as I said it is very hard to remain detached when you see what is taking place. This is in Spanish with a touch of French all translated well and runs for 105 minutes and I was left very moved by the end and can only recommend thoroughly.",1383523200,4,1662,4.4605263157894735
8555729,4,B00APOH5OA,"Argentinean director Pablo Trapero brings to the screen a very dark seemingly hopeless disparity between the rich and the poor. Written by Trapero along with Alejandro Fadel, Mart&iacute;n Mauregui  and Santiago Mitre, the story will burn on the viewer's mind the hypocrisy of disparity between the rich and the poor.

The film opens in the Peruvian jungle where Father Nicol&aacute;s (J&eacute;r&eacute;mie Renier) witnesses the brutal massacre of his friends and congregation while he alone survives, leaving a profound sense of guilt for not having also died in the catastrophe. Father Nicol&aacute;s's beloved friend and confessor Father Juli&aacute;n (Ricardo Dar&iacute;n) brings Nicol&aacute;s to the ""Villa Virgin"", a `favela' like shantytown in the slums of Buenos Aires near an abandoned huge project for a hospital that was started decades ago in Buenos Aires, seen today as a typical ""white elephant"", a useless structure that now houses the poverty stricken inhabitants. Drugs provide the major business in this ghetto. Assault weapons and firearms can be found almost everywhere. Add all that to the precarious living conditions and this sort of hell on earth is not even fit for anyone to endure. The two priests work tirelessly to help the local people. Juli&aacute;n uses his political connections to oversee the construction of a hospital. Nicol&aacute;s remains deeply troubled from his experience in the jungle, but he does find comfort in Luciana (Martina Gusman), a young, attractive, atheist social worker. As Nicol&aacute;s' faith weakens, tension and violence between the slum drug dealing cartels grows. And when work on the hospital is halted by ministerial decree, the faith of the inhabitants of Villa Virgin is shattered, and Nicol&aacute;s discovers he has been called by Juli&aacute;n to assume his role of parish priest as Juli&aacute;n is coping with an undiagnosed neurological disease. It is a test of wills, a test of faith, and a sense of being crushed by the politics of Argentina.

Because of the setting in the filthy and decrepit slum the visuals become confusing with the cinematography by Guillermo Nieto attempting to take in too much visual information to the point of confusing the story line. But the musical score by Michael Nyman is brilliant and enhances the film tremendously. The three major actors - Darin, Renier, and Gusman - are outstanding in very difficult roles. If the audience is left with a sense of the futility the people of the slums face daily, then the film has accomplished its mission. In Spanish with English subtitles.

8555731,1,B00APOH5OA,"La pelicula Elefante Blanco, White Elephant  nos pareci lenta, depresiva y aburrida,  el actor Ricardo Darin nos gusta mucho,  pero no para esta pelicula. La vimos hasta el final haciendo un esfuerzo y esperando que cambiara.... mala hasta el final. Yo no la recomiendo",1365811200,2,269,5.068181818181818
8555732,5,B00APOH5OA,"In the last ten years Ricardo Darin has been one of the most prominent Argentinean actors, following the steps of legends, such as Hector Alterio. In this film, he once again shows why this is the case when he plays the role of father Julian, a priests working in one of the many ""villas"" that have become commonplace not only in Argentina, but in many Latin American countries. Many of you may have been exposed to this connected to the ""favelas"" in Brazil by the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/City-of-God-English-Subtitled/dp/B006LG7MWG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">City of God (English Subtitled)</a>. In this case Julian's goal is to finish the construction of a hospital that would be the biggest one in the continent. The project has started and stalled several times through time, going back to the early 1900s, and the building has become known as the White Elephant.

Besides the challenge of completing a project like this, Julian faces the challenge of being terminally ill and having to keep that truth bottled inside so as to not lose traction. He has to think of the future, so he procures the help of Nicolas, a friend and priest that has suffered a deep psychological shock when a group of indigenous Indians he was helping in the Amazon were wiped out. The two will try to bring this project to fruition while battling the many challenges that arise in connection with lack of funds, the drug war inside the villa, and temptations that present themselves and threaten to derail everything.

The acting is definitely high level from both Darin and Renier. I have noticed that when I see Darin acting I sometimes forget I am watching a movie and feel like I am in a room with him having a conversation. He also has an uncanny ability to convey complex emotions without uttering a single word. Renier gives a decent performance, especially when considering the challenge he faces due to language. Nicolas, his character, is French, so the accent is easily explained in that fashion. Martina Gusman plays a social worker who is one of the objects of temptation, and does a good job at it. I also have to mention that several of the support performers do a great job, especially with the way in which they talk, since it is spot on what you would expect from someone living in the ""villas"". In particular, Federico Barga, who plays Monito, shows good potential.

This is one of those films that you have to be in the mood for. You know there are going to be gut-wrenching scenes and that things are not going to be rosy. But on the same vein, it it worthwhile to make the time and put the effort on watching it, since it is a clear example of how good Argentinean movies can be.",1360454400,9,2739,4.823404255319149
