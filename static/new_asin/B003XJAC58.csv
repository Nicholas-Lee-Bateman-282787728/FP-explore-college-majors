8408140,5,B003XJAC58,"I was too young too go to an Alice Cooper Concert Billion Dollar Babies Tour so seeing this was exciting! The Original Alice Cooper Group is every bit of the legend people say they were! Yes, definitely the best band Alice ever had.  Alice was at the top of his game here, vocals and performance were just outstandingly amazing and sick! You got to see this if you want to experience the early days of The Coop!",1430265600,,411,4.337662337662338
8408141,3,B003XJAC58,"Yes, it's dark. Literally. The footage isn't very good and the band is hard to see in many instances because of the lack of good lighting. But this was 1973, and concert films weren't a normal occurrence like they are in this era we live in.

But..... any Alice is better than no Alice. It was fun to see how he has progressed in the last 40 years by looking at this old footage.

This Blu Ray will probably collect dust on my shelf. I'm with the other reviewer in regards that the last 2 Blu rays he did are the cream of the crop.",1378598400,3,531,4.0476190476190474
8408142,5,B003XJAC58,This is a must have for any rock fan!!!  Coop still rocks to this day.  ZZ Top opened for him for New Year's Eve show in Buffalo on this tour.,1372377600,2,142,3.7
8408143,4,B003XJAC58,"The movie shorts between songs are pretty bad. The version I have had as a bootleg for years had old B&W clips that would have something to do with what the next song's subject matter was. This must have been too difficult to get licensing for, but it was much better than theses silly skits. It was more ""Alice"" too. A lot more. Not throwing away that vhs tape yet!",1293667200,4,366,4.242857142857143
8408144,3,B003XJAC58,"Alice cooper is soon to be in the rock and roll hall of fame,
he has created some of rocks greatest songs like 'I'm 18""  a song that everyone of that age should hear.
he had tons of hit singles, but this was from that period when rock shows were interspaced with a 'movie'
it is of it's time in that regard but the concert footage and the movie do feature the original band. One of the poor guys has passed away too so this is a chance to see the original 'alice cooper'.  the newer live stuff is better though like 'live at montreax' etc.  and the newest edition live at hamersmith.  But this one is a worth owning for alice fans for the vintage footage , the movie parts can be seen once I would say and then it's better to just jam with the band.",1291766400,5,749,4.04054054054054
8408145,2,B003XJAC58,"This is a typical consert movie from the seventies where they try to destroy the consert with a surrealistic and completely idiotic additional movie. They all did it, Abba, Led Zeppelin,Neil Young, the Who and many more. but at least some of them have a good sound and they don`t interupt the consert all the time. When both sound and picture is way under average it dosen`t help that you can play the consert only under bonusmaterial. Pick the Montreux blue ray and skip this one.",1290729600,2,481,4.604651162790698
