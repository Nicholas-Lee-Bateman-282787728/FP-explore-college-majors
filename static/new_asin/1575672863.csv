196050,5,1575672863,this is my favorite music worship album and I hope to purchase more by this company thank you,1428883200,,93,4.222222222222222
196051,5,1575672863,"This is my favorite go-to video for inspiration, relaxation, and worship. The photography is amazing. Some of it is older footage without the high definition we are used to, but of such quality that it deserves to be included on this DVD. The hang-gliding footage is breath-taking, as is the kayaking on the river, sometimes calm, sometimes tumultuous--a lot like life. The music and scriptures are perfect. I watched this video many times during recuperation after surgery, never tire of it.",1426464000,3,492,5.08641975308642
196052,5,1575672863,This is the DVD that we put on when my 93 year old Mother gets agitated. Very calming and beautiful scenery.,1417132800,5,108,4.190476190476191
196053,5,1575672863,"It is wonderful!  I got one for myself and one for my son who loves it.  My husband and I had one already, but I wanted another one to watch at night when I have trouble sleeping.
I love the Scriptures and also love the ""hymns, songs, and spiritual"" songs, which are encouraging and always glorify the Lord.
Thank you for making it a DVD and combining two DVRs.  We are so blessed to have worship music and Scripture in the hard times.

196054,5,1575672863,Moody video. Need I say more. This video was excellent quality both visually and sound wise. The music goes well with the video.,1379721600,5,128,4.608695652173913
196055,5,1575672863,"This is a wonderful video of music, scripture and amazing nature videos. It is very inspiring and peaceful. It is the same exact video as a set of two VHS I was seeking to replace! I was so excited to find it was the same video, as I have enjoyed that VHS set for decades, and do not have the second volume anymore.",1342742400,5,315,4.015873015873016
196056,5,1575672863,"The Moody 'Perfect Peace' and 'This is the Day' videos were family favorites for years in the VHS format, and this DVD pulls the best of them (plus some very cool vintage hang-glider footage) together into DVD format. Great footage and WONDERFUL SCRIPTURE SELECTION AND READING make this an uplifting and worshipful experience every time I watch it. (Those rowing machine workouts will never be dull again.)

I do wish it were in high definition (although it still looks better than the old VHS which I still have) but considering the price for two complete 55-minute segments this DVD is a BARGAIN. My wife and I liked it so well we bought three more to give as gifts.",1268697600,13,669,4.669491525423729

7798923,5,1575672863,"I purchased several nature DVD's at the same time last year. This selection won my heart. This is one of THE most inspiring nature DVD's I've ever seen. I definitely recommend it for several reasons: the content is very broad, including excellent footage of ocean scenery, monarch butterfly forest, bald eagles, sheep tending, sure-footed great-horned sheep on stony crags, hang-gliding over desert and mighty snow-capped mountains, kayaking the CO River thru the Grand Canyon, and much more -- the diversity of beauty displayed is fascinating and exalts our Creator. Also, the only content voiced throughout is Scripture. The sacred music is both instrumental and sung by various choir and/or solo singers. If you are looking for a quiet worshipful experience, do not hesitate to add this to your library. You will not be disappointed. There are two segments 55 min long each, total 110 min presentation.",1468972800,2,905,5.205479452054795
