( drug dealers taking over certain parts of town...dirty politicians profiting on the side...etc). Good for one viewing, that's about it.",1455926400,,277,5.043478260869565

8678064,5,B00NGQQ55E,"As always with Paul Walkers films, this is another great one to collect. This film was tough and gritty. The story was very compelling also. This is as tough as one can get by living in a slum community of rival gangs and poor neighborhoods.
Paul Walker will surely be missed but it nice to know he had many movie greats in his time when he was alive. And can be seen again over and over.",1425081600,,388,4.118421052631579
