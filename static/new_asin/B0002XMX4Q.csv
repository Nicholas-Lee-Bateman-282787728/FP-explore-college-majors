8034201,4,B0002XMX4Q,"Producer Quinn Martin had scored big with the seminal 60's series, ""The Fugitive,"" and decided that a similar man-on-the-run scenario would work in the science fiction genre.  ""Beachead,"" the pilot episode of ""The Invaders,"" has architect David Vincent (Roy Thinnes) accidentally stumbling upon an alien spacecraft making a nocturnal landing in a remote section of the countryside.  No matter how he tries to convince others, no one believes him, including his business partner/friend (James Daly) and the townsfolk.  It isn't until he meets up with the proprietor of a country store (Diane Baker) that he gains a possible ally.  Unfortunately, things are not what they seem, and Vincent finds that he is a man alone on a quest to let the world know that ""we are not alone"".

Thinnes does an outstanding job as the man determined to warn the world. Though Baker's part is small, it is still significant to the story and she does well in the part.  Look carefully for Ellen Corby, later to gain acclaim as the grandmother on ""The Waltons.""

This episode features music from Domenic Frontiere, the composer that had done such outstanding composing for ""The Outer Limits"" and many of the musical cues are taken directly from those scores.  The music adds an otherworldly yet earthbound touch to the events occurring onscreen.",1161388800,5,1322,5.004566210045662
