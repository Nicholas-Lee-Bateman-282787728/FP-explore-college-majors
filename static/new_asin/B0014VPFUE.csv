We really love the bug box that came free with the DVD.  It's so cute and high quality, and it gave us an activity that lasted all afternoon!  We were out collecting bugs to study...and then we returned them to their homes after we were done!  Very cool.",1219968000,,466,4.511904761904762

8256449,5,B0014VPFUE,"All the Hermie movies are great for kids, and this one is no exception.  All the bugs go to camp and everyone gets along fine but Stanley has a problem, he stinks.  Of course, he stinks, he is a stink bug, and that is what stink bugs do!  His fellow campers like Stanley but cannot stand to be near him when he emits his odor.  What Stanley finds out is that he stinks when he is afraid.  His biggest fear is that others will not like him.  This movie contains a great lesson for kids about accepting others in spite of their differences.

If you haven't watched any of the Hermie movies, I suggest you check out a few of them.  They are very entertaining.  The voices of Don Knotts and Tim Conway are excellent as Hermie and Wormie.  I love the big bug eyes and the animation is great.",1257120000,,786,4.18
8256450,5,B0014VPFUE,I heard the author of this book and took the time to look at the book during a conference I attended.  I have three little girls (grandchildren) and they all love to hear about how God loves them.  A perfect book for them.  I would highly recommend this book for your precious little ones.,1230854400,,289,4.314814814814815
