7341103,5,B011SN6RA4,When you've been a desk jockey for so long it has to be hard to get out on the street to find a serial killer who does nothing but taunt you at every turn. This is the case for Detective Mathews and as he gets sucked deeper and deeper into the investigation he begins to unravel to the point of self destruction of his entire life. His wife has had enough of his drinking and never being home and even when he is home its like he isn't there because his head is focused only on his case and nothing more. Hans Hernke's portrayal of Detective Matthews is what holds this movie together. His performance is dark and gritty and what independent film making is all about. A cat and mouse detective story that delivers the goods.,1445904000,,724,4.291970802919708
7341104,4,B011SN6RA4,"If you're a fan of suspense films, you'll really like this detective thriller. The movie has some interesting twists (especially towards the end sorry no spoilers). Shot in Miami Florida (although no big ""name"" actors - the only reason I gave the film 4 stars instead of 5), this film offers a great story with an excellent cast with Hans Hernke, Vania Bezerra & others delivering solid performances!",1437177600,3,400,4.897058823529412

Beautiful picture, vibrant colors of Miami! This film is definitely a independent film and has its moments. Everyone gave really good performances and left the audience guessing what happens at the end. I recommend this film to anyone who likes independent cinema and cop/crime/detective flicks!

I had all the bad audio, focus, camera angles plus a really good looking girl that couldn't act either. I received a good grade because I was using an (as in singular)8 millimeter camera.

Of course we enjoy drama/thrillers to begin with and this one did not disappoint!  The story line is compelling with its plot twists, and Hans Hernke is more than effective in his role.

7341128,1,B011SN6RA4,This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! The plot is weak. The acting is actually excruciating to watch. The detectives acting is full of clichs and lacks any real character or direction. Other actors in the film are absolutely terrible actors and are non-convincing in their parts. Amazon blocked my first review so I hope this one goes through. Unless you have a lot of free time on your hands Id stay away from this one!,1465084800,2,438,4.419753086419753

7341138,2,B011SN6RA4,"Hidden Agenda hides all the qualities of a good film, including script writing, editing, acting, and sets, It resembles a film school project. It borrows nothing of quality from the immense body of great film making that exists, instead substituting the director's unseasoned vision for substance. The movie alternates between close ups and medium distance, jump cuts for narrative ties, and a disconnected sense between the camera and the film's pace. It's perfect for sleeping through.

7341152,2,B011SN6RA4,"Since I am not talented enough to direct and produce my own movie, I try to get what I believe in my own opinion a fair thought.  I did make it to the end of the movie because I really wanted to know the outcome although I was somewhat confused as to the direction I was supposed to go.  The acting was fine and yes because I am use to high budget films I noticed quite a few things that were not as I would expect such as the look of the outside of the police station and the inside (it mainly looked like an office).  But for me my problem was this was supposed to be about a serial killer and as far as the movie goes had only killed one other person and kidnapped the reporter.  Only two cases does not warrant a serial killer, then how the movie tended to jump around.  It seems in all cop movies there is something broken with the relationship and he's a drunk, but here I didn't get the problem between the cop and his wife (I guess I was to infer, their problem).  The movie made it seem as if much time had passed by but when the actors spoke the timing was off as they would say day or hours.  I understand based on what this movie reading that this was about an officer having to change his method from solving cases behind a desk to actually doing detective work in the field, but why was he so unpleasant with his new partner, his previous one had retired (that was on a good note).  If he did all of his work closing cases behind his desk then why was he interviewing the family near the end when I would think that would also be classified as something he would do behind the desk, I mean he has to build the information up in his folder in order to solve the case.  I felt like this movie was trying to hit certain points, that the focus became jumbled.  I can handle a movie without an ending as to what happen to everyone but to want to commit suicide and the case wasn't solved and for some reason running around with a gun in your hand covered in blood near the very end; didn't make any sense. I mean who was he chasing the guy was already poisoned (dead) so he wasn't chasing him, how and why did the blood get on him, and I am going to the  dreams of himself drowning as a metaphor about his life.  Therefore for me, there was just too much going on, not enough information to completely understand if I was understanding what the director wanted me to get, it was like a movie with many story lines going on at one time, all intertwined together with no conclusive ending.",1448582400,,2496,4.113168724279835
7341153,1,B011SN6RA4,"By far 1 of the worst movies I have ever seen. All the actors and actresses are D rated and that's being kind. The only actor that should keep acting was the detective that got killed half way through the movie. The rest of the cast need to find another occupation as acting is def not it. I would rate this a comedy and only again due to the acting being SO BAD!!

Cheap sets, wooden acting, and lousy continuity ( girl wearing black bra in one scene, and white in the next, which took place a few minutes later. Character putting on a dark shirt to go to work, and shows up in an electric blue one. Maybe could have found more if I didn't turn it off).
