4652363,4,B005CB6MPE,"Liz Garbus' documentary ""Bobby Fischer Against the World"" doesn't attempt to be a comprehensive portrait of the man, or even to present any particular opinion of Bobby Fischer. It doesn't aspire to anything out of the ordinary, yet it's engaging and offers many first-hand accounts of the erratic chess genius. The majority of the film focuses on Fischer's 1972 match against Boris Spassky in Iceland, which earned him a World Chess Championship and catapulted the game of chess into the consciousness of average Americans. Beginning with the difficulties in getting Fischer to Iceland, then moving through the match itself, the film covers Fischer's early life in flashback using archival footage. There is no narration. The tale in narrated by its many interviews.

There are so many interviews (26), in fact, that it gives the impression of a competition to see how many people Liz Garbus could get on camera. Author David Edmonds, American grandmaster Larry Evans, International Master Anthony Saidy, and celebrity coach Harry Sneider provide insight into Fischer's state of mind at the time of his great victory. The event organizer in Iceland, Gundmundar Thorarinsson, the match arbiter Lothar Schmid, and Fischer's bodyguard Saemi Palsson recall the tension and paranoia in Iceland. But why are Malcolm Gladwell and Dick Cavett interviewed? Henry Kissinger is too, which is a coup for any filmmaker, but he doesn't have anything to contribute. Boris Spassky did not participate, but Garry Kasparov seems happy to offer his opinions.

The film traces Fischer's mental deterioration after his Championship win, as some neurosis or other prevented him from defending his title and, worse, left him without anything constructive to focus obsessively on. Without clear goals, Fischer slid into paranoia and madness. His psychiatrist in Iceland, Dr. Kari Stefansson, has some insight to offer on Fischer's last years. But there is almost no speculation as to the nature of Fischer's neurological eccentricities or the causes of his mental deterioration. He does not seem to have been emotionally close to anyone, so it is difficult to grasp the man. Liz Garbus' film is a nice compliment to David Edmonds' book about the 1972 World Championship match,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bobby-Fischer-Goes-to-War/dp/B000ECXDL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bobby Fischer Goes to War</a>, as that is where the film excels.

The DVD (Docurama 2011): There are two featurettes, both of which give the impression of being sequences created for the film that were left on the cutting room floor, so to speak. ""The Fight for Bobby Fischer's Estate"" (6 1/2 min) covers the claims on Fischer's $2 million estate made by his Japanese wife Miyoko Watai, a Filipino woman and her young daughter, and his two nephews, which were decided by an Icelandic court in 2009. ""Chess History"" (5 min) is a brief history of the game's 1500 years. There is a text bio of filmmaker Liz Garbus and trailers for four other Docurama releases.

There probably isn't going to be a director's cut or a 2nd edition but if there were... Ought to win an Oscar, hands down (and wasn't even nominated; what a snub, along with Harry Potter, Michelle Williams, etc., etc...)! Forget Hollywood and the media celebrities and their money; Bobby's going down in history!! A worthy subject and a worthy project. A real genius sorely missed, not just among chess players but, as Ljubojevic said, Bobby united and centralized a fragmented and marginalized world, only to suffer a same fate.

I was in early grade school when Fischer played Spassky, and I got so swept up in the Fischer-inspired Chess Boom (seems such a quaint idea now) that I ended up playing matches over the phone for hours every night by the time I was 12. Captain of the high school chess team as a sophomore, I was poised to rule the world. And then, suddenly...the CIA!!

I kid (about the Agency, I really was a chess geek though), yet Fischer's ""madness"" is one area this film spends a lot of time on while refusing to really probe from both sides. WHY did Fischer get so into the Protocols Of Zion and risk his whole ""career"" to talk about Zionist conspiracies? He's shown to be brilliant, but then derided out of hand as insane, given zero credit for being able to perhaps see a few moves ahead of the rest of us. Yet the most startling thing in this whole film for me was the early interview where he mentions that he likes reading about water pollution (this was years before the media paid it much mind at all) and how the government controls us. Not many folks were saying that out loud at that point, let alone young chess prodigies. And how many chess prodigies worked out like a boxing champion?

Fischer seemed exceptionally poised and alert then, and it struck me that a mind that sharp will always see the world a few moves ahead of most other people. He was well ahead of his time in terms of ecological concern, but of course this film shows clearly that Fischer's crazy theories of Zionist bankers destroying the world economy via the constant inflation of money supplies while controlling currencies were obviously totally insane.

What a nut! Yet he seems actually very lucid until the end in Iceland. His fitness obsession makes it clear how very bright Bobby was, and how well he understood the mind/body connection. How many chess greats worked out like that? Ummmmm....only the ""really crazy one""!

He worked Spassky every which way, to be sure, mainly via his paradigm-shifting openings, but this film focuses on the personal stuff far more than the chess, to its detriment. It's Fischer's chess that made him great, and the brief analyses of his finest games here are scant. As if this film won't eventually be watched by almost all serious chess players. There's more than a few still around...

Instead, this film seems to have the chief agenda of pointing out what a crazy nut Fischer became, because why focus on his genius instead of his ""madness""? Other than making a better film, of course. We get more than enough of his disapproving colleagues clucking like old hens about his follies, but not enough of Fischer himself from the many clearly very interesting interviews. I want to hear more of what Bobby thought and said, and less from his bitter little peanut gallery, thanks.

Fischer and especially Fischer's chess deserve a better film than this. Though well-made, it glosses over the best of Fischer and oddly delights in the worst. It's as if we're being told, ""Pay no attention to the man behind the iron curtain. He was hyper-sharp but he was insane...please remember that at all times.""

More chess and less judgment, please.",1323216000,39,3161,4.662477558348295
4652366,4,B005CB6MPE,"Making a documentary film is always a challenge for the creator, especially when the topic has been barely touched. Director Liz Garbus, in making the documentary ""Bobby Fischer Against the World,"" had to overcome three critical obstacles.

First she had to portray Fischer's complex character. Since filming started after his death, Garbus had to dig up footage--scattered around the world--and weave together the various strands of Fischer's life. Not only that, she had to gather together all those who played important role in his life.

The second critical obstacle for Grabus was that she had to depict the period where the tension of the Cold War was emerging (because of the Vietnam War), and the whole world was going through major changes, with the entire planet becoming a mortal battlefield. Although chess had started to become popular, the hostility of that time was somehow deeply reflected on the chessboard, and this was soon exploited even more, when the world of politics penetrated into the world of chess.

Garbus' third critical obstacle was that Fischer's life can be divided into three parts: i) his life (and chess career) before 1972, ii) his battle for the title in 1972, and iii) his life after 1972. This means that Fischer's life is often summarized within the boundaries of a single event, stripping away all the aspects that formed his character up to that point. How was Garbus then, going to tell the story of a man who spent half his life playing chess and then disappeared? To overcome these obstacles, Garbus chooses a nonlinear storytelling. Going back--to Fischer's childhood and early years, and then later--forward to his life after the championship games, Garbus uses the 1972 events as the spine of the story.

Visiting Fischer's childhood and adolescence, Garbus shows us his love for (and dedication to) chess, his mother's strong personality, his father's abandonment and absence, and how the precipitate publicity affected his privacy. But what no one mentions in the interviews is that Fischer, at a young age, struggled to gain the respect of others. He was a boy among men, playing (and trying to understand) their game. That struggle was slowly draining away Fischer's childhood (and transforming the first 29 years of his life to a prolonged chess game), the result of which Garbus masterfully displays--at what could be the climax of the film--when she shows Fischer, soon after he won the title, in an amusement park sitting inside a little airplane--flying towards his lost childhood.

The tense climate between the U.S. and the Soviet Union--and its echo in the chess world, is brilliantly shown by Garbus through the rare and previously unseen footage she managed to dig up. Unfortunately, Spassky is the great absentee from this documentary. Although the title of the film is Bobby Fischer Against the World (meaning that Fischer fights against everyone and no one at the same time, indicating that Fischer's whole world is nothing but chess--and Fischer himself is nothing but chess--therefore Fischer's only opponent is... Fischer), Garbus mistakenly diminishes Spassky's unique and independent personality by putting him in the same basket with all the others. After all, Spassky was the final external obstacle in Fischer's road to the crown--the one guy he did not yet win. And to paraphrase Thorarinsson, ""I think we can agree on the point that Mr. Spassky exists.""

However, Garbus does a great job regarding the events of 1972. She leaves out, though, the drama of the two players not having similar chairs (with Fischer's chair being superior to Spassky's), but generally, she covers the events accurately enough: from Fischer's training program, his antics of not showing up, his lists of demands, his growing hatred towards the Soviets, the defending of his principles, the antipathy to cameras and photographers, to his so long-awaited win, Garbus quietly and unpretentiously illustrates the events of the 1972 summer in Iceland.

There is another level in this documentary, a hidden level that Garbus unconsciously created. All the interviewees in the film are trying to label Fischer to a degree that fits their world of understanding. They believe that Fischer should have a particular role in their world, and serve that role in a specific manner.

We are in a society where everyone needs something to have a form in order to understand it. That's why we put labels on everything, and don't let things just be. In that sense, for me, Fischer died in 1972 and reborn after that, as a man with no home and no childhood, trying to play chess on a higher level, the one we all play and eventually lose...

4652367,3,B005CB6MPE,"This is a comprehensive documentary on American chess star Bobby Fischer, who overcame increasing mental frailty to beat Boris Spassky for the world chess title in 1972 in Reykavik and then turned into a recluse. The makers of the documentary have tracked down everyone involved in this sad tale, even down to the Icelander who acted as his bodyguard all those years ago. This was an era when superpower rivalry was at its peak and chess served as a useful battleground -- who was best, the United States or the Soviet Union?

  Bobby Fischer Against the World puts the championship match into its proper context and shows how the very private star overcame his mental demons to win the the game, and how he unravelled afterwards when it became clear the entire world wanted a part of him. The film's fairly serious flaw is the almost complete lack of actual chess. We're told time and time again that Fischer was a genius and the best in the world and we don't see a single successful game he plays. I imagine that at least some of the people sitting down to watch this will have at a rudimentary understanding of the rules and yet at no point are we shown a game he's played with an explanation of his great moves and why they were so successful. This may sound like a minor complaint but it really detracts from the documentary.",1319414400,15,1331,4.5375

Chronicle the life of chess player Bobby Fischer from his youth and a mother who is an activist as he becomes a teen chess champ.

In 1972 he goes to Iceland to play a Russian to be world champ, but there are many issues. One he gets there, there are more issues. He eventually wins but then does not play any more so he loses his championship by not playing.

4652389,2,B005CB6MPE,"Very generic and shallow ""study"" of Fischer, the chess genius. The documentary does not focus on chess at all (and rightfully so, since the general public would have no way of appreciating the man's talent for the game) - but does not go deep at all at the details of his personal life. Things like his failed quest to cheat on the Karpov match in 1975 (the real reason the match never took place was Fischer's insistence on getting an illegal 10-8 score advantage) , his lack of romantic relationships (or interest in them!) throughout his entire life up to the moment he won the crown (and much longer after that!), the tremendous financial backing provided to him by some wealthy patrons of the Manhattan chess club in New York who paid his rent and many other things, his continued betrayal of every single friend (Jackie Beers a notable example), his absolutely retarded behavior outside the chessboard (he was closer to idiot savant than genius), the loss of several millions left with the bank after the second match with Spassky, etc., etc. Of particular interest would be his fear of losing the title to Karpov, the first soviet rival younger than Fisher and the most talented player of a new generation not interested in meeting Fischer's Najdorf defense with Bc4!. It was that fear that led Fischer to make it impossible to have the match.

What we have here is a very superficial rethread of previously published material on Fischer. Nothing new or particularly interesting for anyone fairly familiar with Fisher's life.

4652391,4,B005CB6MPE,"This excellent documentary covers what is known about Bobby Fischer well.  It traces his remarkable life in chess from the childhood he never had to his ultimate descent into madness and eventual death.  Along the way it covers his world championship match against Boris Spassky, which I thought was the best part of the movie.  The use of what original images and interviews of Bobby exist was good and it was nice to see him and hear him as he actually was.  Obviously one is left with great disappointment that Bobby couldn't hold his mind together long enough to defend his title even once given how dominating he was leading up to and during the Spassky match, but that is part of the Greek Tragedy aspect of his life.  The commentary was quite good in speculating about a relationship between brilliance (at least in chess) and mental illness and this also affected the other greatest American player -- Paul Morphy.  As with all of the ""brilliant but eccentric"" type movies I have seen, this one doesn't in my opinion try enough to actually show the viewer Bobby's brilliance at what he was brilliant at -- Chess.  I would have liked at least a token effort to play though one of his great games or at least part of one, and more perspective on how truly unbelievable his results were crushing the worlds finest on the way to the world championship, results that distinguish him from all others.  But like movies on the brilliant but flawed, including those on Nash, Feynman, and Hawking, the movie aims for a broad audience who the film makers likely expect wouldn't understand or appreciate even a light explanation of what he contributed and why it was brilliant.  Too bad.  The serious chess player will miss that in this film.  I look forward to the upcoming docu-drama about Bobby starring Toby McGuire, and this documentary would be good preparation for anyone who does not know the facts of Bobby's life before going to ""Pawn Sacrifice"" so one can distinguish the ""docu"" from the ""drama.""",1442275200,3,2003,4.727011494252873

It all leads to the epic world championship against Boris Spassky in Iceland in 1972. The documentarys last 20 min. or so cover the lost decades (72-92) and what came thereafter.

Couple of comments: first, the documentary has a true treasure trove of early childhood pictures and movie footage, just fascinating. Among others, it includes a TV interview from 1958 when he had just won the US chess title. Second, even though we all know the outcome of the 1972 world championship match, it still remains riveting to see the clips from it. Amazing is that the event almost doesnt happen due to Fischers demand for higher prize money (eventually a British person doubled the purse to $130,000just about $750,000 in todays terms). Ah yes, the drama of it all. One of the big surprises for me here was a clip containing an interview with Spassky in very good English! After Fischers win, he doesnt know what to do with himself, literally. Someone comments Hes 29 and hasn't had a childhood. Fischer pays the price dearly, first with disappearing for 20 years, then with descending into utter madness and insanity. Someone comments: his genius and his illness are joined at the hip.

If you are a chess enthusiast, you cannot go wrong with this documentary, even if you think you know/are aware of all of these facts already.

4652409,4,B005CB6MPE,"checked this film out from the library and learned quite abit. Mr. Fischer at some point got on the wrong side of the American government and complained of being harassed by said government. Some time before his death, he complained that someone broke into his home (I think it was) and stole all his chess notes and other personal papers. From the documentary I got the sense that he never recovered psychologically from this loss. His papers were never located or returned and as he cycled into madness he continually repeated to any who would listen about his missing papers and their importance to him. Portrait of a chess genius and perhaps a victim of state oppression? Perhaps future historians will delve fully into the matter and eventually be able to access documents not currently available to find out some semblance of what truly happened to him. This documentary made me feel very sad for him. Sometimes paranoid people are paranoid for a reason - continuous, unceasing oppression can push a highly strung person over the edge into psychosis, in my untrained opinion. Heck, such oppression can tip a well person into psychosis, again, in my untrained opinion. May he Rest In Peace.",1400716800,2,1195,4.891625615763547

It gives a good intro to Bobby Fischer with great film of his youth and great interviews. You certainly feel for the kid and even as a champion adult he does not come off as arrogant as I imagined., After all it aint bragging if its true and he was in a class by himself. The film loses focus on the ""lost years"" and relies too much on opinions in interviews. Does not bring up FRC nor ""rumors"" of online games etc. It simply chronicles his decent into ""madness"".

Excellent for up to '72 Spassky, good after wards. Much see for any 1970's historian or even with slight interest in chess.",1397347200,5,696,4.225563909774436

4652421,4,B005CB6MPE,I enjoyed this as I enjoy watching anything about chess players. This documentary goes into more detail on Bobby's life than any other production I've seen. It's Bobby Fischer...warts and all. It gets pretty ugly..but I appreciate the honesty. The audio of Bobby laughing and relishing the 911 attack on the twin towers is hard to watch and listen to. It shows just how far gone he was before his death. All Fischer fans will enjoy this unfortunate and truthful documentary and I recommend it. There is a priceless moment in a press conference where Jeremy Schaap (son of Dick Schaap) gets the last word when Fischer badgers him about an assessment Dick made about him years before. I enjoyed very much seeing Jeremy Schaap's response. It was excellent.,1368144000,2,753,4.844961240310077
4652422,4,B005CB6MPE,"There is one scene that is probably the most telling about Bobby Fischer:  he is talking about his childhood, talking about chess -- what else would he talk about, except for one topic that I will only briefly discuss below -- and he describes playing chess.  Against himself.

The media and the world think that Bobby Fischer was against them.  But perhaps in some ways, he really worked more against himself.  But he didn't have much choice.  His mom left when he was in his mid-teens, as ""he could take care of himself,"" and so just like chess, he had to learn the rules of life on his own.  In some ways this is good -- many rules that the world imposes on people are very artificial and flawed -- but in some ways bad -- it's difficult to navigate life without understanding the social mores of the ""commoners.""  And Mr. Fischer surely tweren't no commoner.  Hey, that's the way it is.

Awhile back, I read the book ""Endgame:  Bobby Fischer's Remarkable Rise and Fall,"" and it was a terrific read.  That book went into far more details about Mr. Fischer's life than this movie -- it's much easier with literature -- and it would have been nice in a way if this book dealt with his life a little more outside of chess.  This film, if it has a weakness, is that it concentrates so much of its time on The World Championship Match in Iceland.  Sure, that was the pinnacle of his success, but it was the point where he threw in the towel as well and decided to retire.  I really wish that he would have played against Karpov in 1976 (or so), but it was not to be.  Mr. Fischer did not like to lose, and while he probably would have won easily against a patser like Karpov (OK, Karpov was no patzer but he surely wasn't a Bobby Fischer), Mr. Fischer knew there was a chance that he could stumble.

Now, there are a few things about Mr. Fischer that everyone (unfortunately) concentrates on.  1.  He retired too early.  Check.  2.  He was obstinate and ""childish"" about playing for the world title.  Personally, I think that he was a better businessman than people give him credit for.  After all, he did make millions off chess, and he never would have if he hadn't pushed for higher earnings for ALL chess players.  3.  Anti-Semitism.  Well, there is a scene where Jeremy Schaap takes Mr. Fischer to task about this.  While Mr. Fischer surely went overboard with his rants, I believe that journalists should report news and not make news.  Take that.

I've seen this film twice, and while it's not perfect, it's still really good.  I just wish that Mr. Fischer could have fought off his own demons and fought off Karpov right after that.",1362614400,10,2638,4.444676409185804
4652423,4,B005CB6MPE,This documentary kept it as interesting as a documentary about a reclusive chess player can be. A man so brillant at chess pays for it by not being able to cope with life like a normal person. Never really knew how eccentric Fischer was till seeing this.,1360368000,,254,4.425531914893617
4652424,4,B005CB6MPE,"For those who do not play chess or know anything about it, the game is something that is commonly referenced in books, poetry, movies, etc.  It is seen as somewhat of a metaphor for happenings in real life.  For those who play chess and are in love with the game, it is something of an art or science, or something cosmic that is unexplainable.  They may often be frustrated as to why the majority of society does not share their passion.

Chess has survived for thousands of years and is arguably the hardest game in the world.  Through the eons, if there is one name or one master that has towered above anyone else, it is the American Bobby Fischer.  When Fischer defeated Boris Spassky in 1972, the match created more publicity than any other chess event in history (even more than when IBM's computer Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov in 1996).  A lone American had defeated the mighty Soviet chess machine during the cold war.  What should have been just the beginning of an already great career for Fischer, it was actually just the end.

Bobby Fischer made one of the great disappearances of any famous person of the 20th century.  He did not die, but was as elusive as Bigfoot after he won the world championship.  For those who encountered him only would end of becoming frustrated because they realized he was slowly going insane.  20 years after winning the Championship (1992), Fischer reappeared to play Spassky for another match.  When he appeared, it became even more obvious that the man had lost his mind.  When the September 11th attacks happened, Fischer shocked the world when he applauded the acts on a radio program.  He never played again and passed away in 2008.

This HBO program is fantastic in that it is presented in a manner that is suitable for those who barely know anything about chess or those who know the intricate details of Fischer's career and life.  It keeps the viewers' attention by playing nice music in the background throughout.  The program shows numerous photographs and television footage that most people have never seen.  The central focus of the program is the Fischer - Spassky match of 1972, but it juxtaposes all kind of other topics such as Fischer's family and love life, and his affiliation with a cult group.  The program even has Henry Kissinger talking about the match.  Kissinger had encouraged Fischer to follow through with the match when Fischer was about to not show up.  But, the program does not blame Fischer's religious obsession with chess for this mental breakdown.  It posits that it could have been a possibility.

I will have to strongly disagree with one part of this documentary.  It stated that when after Fischer won the world championship, he was arguably the most famous man in the world (aside from Jesus).  I find this really hard to believe.  One because Fischer was a merely just a chess champion and (2) there were many other gigantic figures at that time; Muhammad Ali, Richard Nixon, Chairman Mao, just to name a few.

In the end, the enigma will always remain the enigma.  Nobody really knows why Fischer quit playing after 1972 or what caused his mental disintergration.  Even though he forfeited his title to Karpov in 1975, why did he completely give up playing even tournaments and simuls altogether?  What we are left is speculation.  Many chess lovers will proudly proclaim that Fischer was the best player of all time.  There maybe some truth to this, but I believe Garry Kasparov finally deserves this title.  This is because Kasparov was willing to take on all comers, human beings or computers.  Kasparov did this for almost 3 decades.  Kasparov defeated an ongoing Champion Anatoly Karpov (one of the top 5 players ever) 5 times and he continued to defend this title beating brilliant and talented young players - Ivanchuck, Shirov, Topalov, Anand, Short, Leko, Kramnik, Kamsky, and so many others for another 2 decades.

*Please do not comment if you are going to get into a ""greatest ever"" debate - it will be yet another endless discussion and will lead to nowhere.*

Fishcer's story is one of the great tragedies of chess, but in the short time that he was brilliant, he shined so brightly that it continues to illuminate to this day.  Although his life ended to a sad decline, keep in mind, we remember and admire him for what he produced.",1358467200,9,4343,4.74
4652425,1,B005CB6MPE,"It is quite obvious that the movie was designed as an attack on Fischer`s personality and views and does a bad service to him as a person, a chess player and to chess in general. There is literally no analysis or commentary on his best games or what made him stand out as a very different and unique chess player which is somewhat the very thing one would expect from a movie about Bobby Fischer. I am pretty sure the people who were interviewed for this movie had said much more yet somehow one has the feeling that the editors have chosen the mantra ""YES I KNEW FISCHER AND HE HAD PROBLEMS"" as a central motif of the whole movie. Let`s face it ,Fischer did not have problems, he was simply light years ahead of anyone else in terms of his understanding of what was and is truly going on in the world and while he might have gotten some of the details wrong he did get the bigger picture right. For anyone who wants to know why Fischer was considered a genius in the world of chess I would like to recommend the great movie by GM Roman Dzindzichashvili ""A tribute to Bobby Fischer"" which can be watched on youtube.",1357430400,8,1115,4.289099526066351

I have a friend who's into chess playing and thought this might be a good Christmas gift and wanted to watch it on my Roku before I purchased it. Needless to say I purchased the DVD as a gift. The film was well made and created a suspense filled take on the history of the world chess champion. I've heard of Bobby Fischer but never really knew the history or what became of him. Pretty sad what happened to him at the end. Overall the film did a good job of showing what can happen to a great mind without proper treatment or family support.

4652428,5,B005CB6MPE,"Bobby Fischer helped win the Cold war, was a chess genius and more importantly was right all along about the zionist bankers.

From his Game of the Century win over Robert Byrne in the late 1950's to his amazing 6-0 wins over Taimonov and Bent Larsen to his tense 72 match with Boris Spassky, Fischers chess has never been surpassed and seldom equalled.

Many folks have rightly condemned Bobbys anti semitism, yet he was right all along about zionist bankers, (even though his antisemitism was wrongly mispalced)....can anyone deny that the central bankers have taken over the world with hundreds of trillions of dollars in derivitive fraud ?  Not one person has been indicted for all the banker bailouts in 2008?  Fischer was one of the first to publicly deride the debt fraud through massive inflation we face today...and of course the controlled mainstream media will call anyone who brings this up as ""insane"" just as they did to Fischer.
Incredible genius ahead of his time and well worth watching as long as you understand the last part of the movie is a hit job on Bobby's views on Central Bankers and how they have literally taken over the world.",1354320000,5,1155,4.76

4652433,4,B005CB6MPE,"I am no psychiatrist, however I believe that Mr Fischer had Asperger's syndrome. He had interests that he obsessed over (chess & anti-semitism), he was socially awkward, he was introverted, he had an unusual style of walking (bouncy gait), hypersensitivity to lights & sounds, has similar characteristics to his biological father (Paul Nemenyi), he was nocturnal for at least a part of his life & lacked empathy or didn't care about others. There seems to be a correlation between asperger's syndrome & being born late i.e. past the standard 9 months of pregnancy. I am curious to see if in the future there will be a conclusive study into this probable cause. I wonder if Mr Fischer was a little overcooked in the womb, so to speak.

Mr James Dines wrote a book called ""Mass Psychology"", in that book, he wrote about a concept called paradox & irony. His examples include, the woman you wanted you couldn't get & the woman you didn't want, you couldn't get rid off, it's the knight in chess, it's trying to be happy on new year's eve & ending up miserable, it's fulfilling your childhood fantasy & then not wanting it anymore. I think Mr Fischer is an example of paradox & irony.

Great documentary. I appreciated the variety of interviewees & comments. For all those who are actually into chess, there's a myriad of material out in this world such as books, newspaper puzzles & chess magazines that analyze his great games. I do not believe that Mr Fischer was the greatest chess player of all time, however he was the greatest student of chess of all time. Mr Emanuel Lasker will always be remembered as the greatest chess player of all time because he was the World Champion for the longest period of time. Considering how hard it is to compare players of different eras, as far as I'm concerned, this is the only factor that should be taken into consideration in making this judgement.",1336608000,2,1890,4.672672672672673

4652435,5,B005CB6MPE,"Bobby Fischer Against the World by Liz Garbus maintained an excellent balance between compassion and objectivity.  It is impossible to know for sure what happened in Bobby's mind after winning the world championship.  I think he had a great fear of losing if he played another match with the next challenger.  Also I think after winning the world championship he may have become increasingly aware of looking like a freak in all the media coverage that followed.  I wanted to know more about what Fischer was like when he gave all his money to the church in Pasadena - maybe the same intense desire to prevail - in a supportive social setting.  I'll take this moment to brag that I got to play a game with Bobby when he took on 50-60 chessplayers simultaneously in 1961 at the Los Angeles Ambassador Hotel. Still a teenager, he was already U.S. champion.  Fischer achieved an overwhelming advantage against me but tried to win too quickly and I was able to scramble to a draw by repitition of moves in a position that became too dangerous for both sides.",1333670400,3,1054,4.639784946236559

8465052,5,B005CB6MPE,"So much wrapped into one person, Bobby Fischer was a child prodigy, genius, national hero, iconoclast, and, unfortunately but no doubt relatedly, a man with deep psychological problems.  He was so many things that it is difficult to genuinely write about the man or, as in this documentary, tell about him, and get anywhere near the full picture.  Nonetheless, this film goes a long way and is a fascinating overview of a truly fascinating, if frustrating, individual.

BOBBY FISCHER AGAINST THE WORLD tells how Fischer was not merely devoted to chess, but utterly consumed by it, the board game itself being the more active agent in the relationship between the two.  From his early fame despite a difficult childhood to the sad final chapter, when Iceland welcomed him after he became a wanted man in his native United States, Bobby Fischer played by his own rules.  It does not seem like he had much of a choice.

Of course, his historic match against Boris Spassky in 1972 takes up a good chunk of the film, as well it should.  More than a chess match, it faced the Soviet chess machine, as micromanaged as the centralized economics of communism, against the lone wolf American, catapulting chess itself to new heights of popularity.
