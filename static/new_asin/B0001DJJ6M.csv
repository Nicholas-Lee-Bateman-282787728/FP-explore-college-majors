8010854,5,B0001DJJ6M,"Offbeat, silly, low budget parody of Ed Wood's cheesy brand of sci-fi.

I bought it because I'm a huge fan of Lola Lane.  Her scene with Blake Palmer is the hottest, in my not so humble opinion.  She also has a rousing lesbian interlude with Kelly Steele.

Kat Kleavage also does an admirable job.

If you grew up on schlocky scifi & goofy horror flicks, you'll enjoy the juvenile humor.  Also if you have a thing for big boobied milfs, this movie will be right up your alley!",1346371200,,476,4.3522727272727275
8010855,1,B0001DJJ6M,"This video states at the end that it was made for loosers, etc. There is no plot. If you want a DVD to use as a coaster for under your coffee cup, this is it.",1235779200,,158,3.5428571428571427
