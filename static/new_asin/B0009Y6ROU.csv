8175751,4,B0009Y6ROU,"My favorite episode from this volume is Return Engagement. I still am a big fan of DQMW and own all of the episodes made. I watch this one alot because of the romance between the lead characters, Dr. Mike (Jane Seymour) and Sully (Joe Lando). For two years fans of this show saw the romance begin and blossom until the first payoff, their engagement. But in true prime-time soap fashion, relationships don't run so smoothly. In this episode, Dr. Mike's fiance' David, who she was told died in the Civil War, comes to town disquised as someone else. When she realizes who David really is she can't decide who she truly wants to spend her life with. This of course angers Sully at first, but being true to his nature he tells Dr. Mike that as much as he wants to be her husband, he wants her happy more. This is in true DQMW fashion as we rejoice when she decides that her feelings for David have changed and her true love is Sully. Also in this episode is the marriage of Horace and Myra which is fun and not without it's interesting scenes of tradition for newlyweds back in the 1800s. The episode of The Man In The Moon is a prequel to this union of Myra and Horace because Hank the owner of the saloon and once Myra's boss, tries to break up their engagement party. Sully stops Hank from shooting Myra, but he ends up in a coma. Dr. Mike is disturbed that Myra could still have feelings towards Hank when she is engaged to Horace. She soon finds herself in almost the same situation in Return Engagement.  The entire ensemble of this show was superb and I highly recommend it for families to watch together.",1130284800,,1609,4.381270903010034
