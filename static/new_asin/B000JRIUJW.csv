8152863,4,B000JRIUJW,Picked it up for a buck at the local walmart. The Digiview release is of of course sub par in terms of quality and the movie was poorly cropped from its widescreen original. Nonetheless it serves to offer up a kung fu movie complete with halfway decent british dubbing and all the thwacking sound effects one comes to expect from such a film; can't go wrong for a buck.,1170374400,,369,4.36231884057971
