6365811,4,B00JK7QTZE,"As I said when it came to Enough Said, there is really this strange lack of middle aged, or beyond, romance films. At least when it comes to stuff which comes across my recommendations anyway. So it makes finding a film like this so beautiful for while there isn't the usual over the top romantic gestures, it does somehow make you fall in love with the idea of being with someone for years. Though it also holds that reminder that your loved one can be taken from you at any minute and truly the two sides it presents to love makes you want to smile and cry.

Characters & Story

For most of Nikkis (Annette Bening) life she has been married to Garrett (Ed Harris). They have a daughter together, Summer (Jess Weixler), would yearly go to Mexico and seemed to have a happy life. But on their last trip together tragedy strikes. Leaving Nikki seemingly with just the company of Roger (Robin Williams), a fellow widow, for 5 years. That is until Tom (Ed Harris) magically appears and with his appearances you are introduced to Nikkis 2nd chance with Garrett. Though you aren't really sure if Tom truly looks like Garrett, or if Nikkis grief is playing tricks on her.

Praise

Let me first start by saying that, for once, I enjoyed Robin Williams performance in something. If just because not only is he not the lead, despite top billing, but it seems he toned down his usual manic persona to actual play a human being. That aside, it really is the love story between Bening and Harris which keeps you attentive. For one, they have good chemistry and really present the idea of growing old with someone to be such an ideal thing. Yet, as noted in the intro, watching Bening deal with the death of her husband really just creates this feeling where, even if you're not in a relationship, nor around Benings age, you easily can feel what she is going through. Because with the movie starting you off caught up in the idea of growing old with someone, it is such a punch in the gut to imagine that special someone dying before you and you being left with these memories you can never replicate. Never mind finding someone new who could live up to your expectations, or even surpass them.

Which makes the transition of Harris from Garrett to Tom so interest for you aren't sure if he is real. After all, even after five years, you can tell Nikki isn't fully over Garretts death. With him dying she lost her love of swimming, art, and though she has Rogers company, romance with him she sort of makes seem like a sad rebound she wants to avoid. So when Harris is reintroduce as Tom, it brings on this idea, at least for me, that maybe she is imagining things. First you wonder if he is real since he barely interacts with anyone, then you question if Nikki is just picturing Garretts face on a man who may not look like him at all, but by the end of the movie you begin to question if this is even reality? For as Nikki starts to unravel, I honestly wondered if maybe we were just witnessing the delusions of a woman lost in her own head.

Criticism

Not to spoil things fully, but I really wish when it came to Harris, as Tom, that Summer wasn't the sole person who seemed to have the opportunity to really react to seeing him. I would have loved to see Roger react to him as well. Plus, I honestly felt like I wanted to see what happened between the two time jumps. The first one is 5 years after Garrett dies and I would have liked to see Nikkis struggle in adjusting to living without Garrett more. For while the film does use flashbacks to illustrate their relationship, I think a few extra minutes to show what happened during that 5 year gap could have been nice. Then the 2nd one is post meeting Tom which could have also used a nice montage, even if during the credits.

Lastly, a part of me really thought it was odd Nikki didn't look into whether Garrett had a missing twin or something. I get she was just happy to find someone who looked like her husband, but youd think she would have been curious about finding this exact replica.

Overall: Worth Seeing

Truly I haven't seen a romance film in a long time which dealt with not just a loved one dying, but also a strong focus on trying to move on. And I have to say the chemistry between Bening and Harris really makes me hope they join each other for another romance film. Hell, I may even go for Williams and Bening being love interest since, I must admit, I kind of wanted to see their relationship go somewhere. Overall though, The Face of Love really is an entertaining film which contains all the cuteness of young love, yet the unfortunate reality of when you realize love and romance isn't going to last forever, but just the next couple of years or decade.",1403654400,4,4723,4.393592677345538
6365812,3,B00JK7QTZE,"""Am I a bad person?"" Nikki (Benning) is madly in love with her husband. While they are on vacation he unexpectedly and suddenly passes away. A year later she is still trying to get over him. When she goes to a museum she spots Tom (Harris), a man who looks exactly like her dead husband. This begins a complicated romantic relationship. First thing I have to say about this is that the acting is great and the movie is very emotional. The emotion that is invokes though is a mix between sadness and anger. Nikki makes you feel sorry for her and makes you despise her at the same time. You know why she is doing what she is doing but you can't help but see and feel how selfish she is being. The movie is a little slow moving but the anticipation of her coming clean is what keeps you watching. She is a woman who is hard to root for but at the same time you can't really root against her. That is the sign a a beautifully written movie. Overall, a slow moving movie that keeps the anticipation high which keeps you watching. I give this a B-.",1402790400,2,1042,4.189054726368159

Tho Annette Bening is stil gorgeous, I was distracted by her wrinkles...and Ed Harris, always a favorite actor of mine, has a face riddled with wrinkles. There is way too much oddity in the film.

6365823,5,B00JK7QTZE,"So extremely moving, but in a more subtle way, a way that only those who have endured the deep loss of a deep love.  Yes it is a romance and it is not,  It is about the human need for the love it knows & understands.  The great depths to which we need love, but in the way we know - how love is pulled into place through our experiences with it.  It is about bereavement and the movements, denials, small lies and great lengths one will go through to get to those places of feeling relief or any comfort -  To BE ""out of"" the pain, & instead IN that feeling of ""living"" we feel with love.  It is a ""FACE"", most certainly love is a face; like a fingerprint or a snowflake, unique.  Human love wants what it knows, healthy or not, functional or not.  Love is subjective.  This movie is a work of art in telling the story of loss, need, love,and individual coping.  Beautifully acted, authentic.  The contradiction, the confusion, the withholding of parts of ourselves - well..... This Is LIFE! This is life indeed.  It does not make sense for the most part.  It is convoluted, complicated, but crafted carefully in this representation, to not come off as boggy, painful or even ridiculous.  I got it!  For me it made sense and I understood the ""why"" even though not one of the characters was like me or even came close to my exact experiences.  It does translate.  If you watch this, you must be open to the translation",1450483200,6,1417,4.326996197718631

6365829,3,B00JK7QTZE,"The Face of Love is a quiet love story with light elements of drama.  There is a message here that you should move on from a past marriage because it might come back to haunt you later.  It's about Annette Bening's character whose husband drowns and she meets another man (Ed Harris) who strongly reminds Annette of her husband, so she desires to fall in love with Ed.  This is a very slow-moving storyline because it mixes romance with drama... until the final 10 minutes.

Annette's next door neighbor played by Robin Williams also loves Annette and wishes to fall in love with her, but once Ed enters Annette's life Robin realizes he can't have her as a girlfriend so they become close friends instead.  Robin doesn't really play as big of a role as I was hoping for considering he's easily my favorite actor in the movie.  Plus it feels weird that he's portraying a normal slightly jealous person giving his outrageous reputation for portraying unusual characters.

Anyway Annette's not the only one who thinks Ed Harris resembles her ex-husband.  People around town notice a similarity as well and comment on it, much to the confusion of Ed.  There's a subtle plot going on that Ed doesn't realize what's *really* going on.  That meaning, he doesn't realize that Annette's lying (her husband didn't leave her like she claims- he drowned) and she's never willing to show him any pictures of her ex-husband either so Ed doesn't suspect the strong facial similarities.

This movie isn't without its faults.  For one thing the way Annette's ex-husband drowns is overdramatic and fake.  The way Annette imitates a lonely widow feels a bit hokey and overdramatic as well.  The movie does nothing out of the ordinary to make Annette stand apart from the other films that show widows being lonely and depressed so the storytelling has several clichd moments.  But for a short romance that's light on the drama and focuses on a woman trying to recover from her ex-husband's death and falls in love with Ed's character with the subtle story that she's only falling in love with this man because he resembles her ex-husband, this one is passable I suppose.

The story does improve when Annette's daughter unexpectedly drops by for a visit after a long drive, and she notices how much Ed resembles her dad.  She understandably freaks out (though a little *too* much I think) and this segment also reveals that Annette's a little crazy in the head and has never been thinking rationally the whole time because she's willing to throw her daughter away and run away to Mexico with this guy.  Basically Annette's hush hush attitude is somewhat interesting because for a while we think she's perfectly normal in her grieving process and in her attempt to start over with a new boyfriend, but she turns out to be a little too obsessed with her ex-husband that well, I won't reveal anymore.  Just watch the ending.  I seriously can't spoil it because that would be mean of me.  Decent movie.",1443225600,,2977,4.764132553606238

6365838,3,B00JK7QTZE,"This was a nice movie - good way to pass some time. Annette Bening is always very capable in her portrayal of believable characters - and she did well in portraying the grief-stricken widow, even if the story itself wasn't entirely believable. I can't say too much about the storyline without spoiling the movie - so I won't. The ending was nice and lifted me up - leaving me feeling good for the main character, which was definitely needed. Ed Harris is also always reliable in delivering solid performances - but he seemed stiff here, not really engaged in the part he was playing. Not the Ed Harris we are used to seeing. Again, a nice little move to pass some time but not a movie to shout about from the rooftops.",1433721600,,718,4.446969696969697

6365844,3,B00JK7QTZE,"A recent widow Nikki (Annette Bening) meets by chance a stranger who looks exactly like her deceased husband Garret (Ed Harris). Nikki is not just interested; she is attracted to the man with a stunning resemblance to Garret who has been dead for five years. Nikki follows him to the workshop where the man teaches art, and finally talks to him.

The Face of Love is not a thriller, so don't expect something like Vertigo. This is a romance with a unique (or incredible, you might say) set-up. The well-acted film starts in an interesting way, and as a middle-aged romance it has a few nice scenes, but fails to capitalize on the film's intriguing premise.

My reason is simply this: I am not convinced. I am not convinced why Nikki has to keep certain information from the perfect double. Nikki has barely recovered from the grief, that is true, but some of her actions are too drastic, and so are those of the supporting characters like Nikkis next-door neighbor Roger (Robin Williams) and her daughter Summer (Jess Weixler). Why do they have to act like that?

Some may find it hard to get past the films premise. The problem of The Face of Love is not that part, though. The film attempts to be a psychological drama while the psychology doesn't go much deeper than the idea with which the film begins.",1429660800,,1306,4.5965665236051505

6365848,4,B00JK7QTZE,"Annette Benning plays Nikki she is married to Garrett - Ed Harris -and on their thirtieth wedding anniversary he gets killed in a tragic accident. She just can't move on and despite changing her rituals to try to come to terms with her loss she still grieves for the love of her life. Five years later and neighbour Roger (Robin Williams in a subdued role) who is also a widower is making moves on her when she sees her dead husband in town.

This turns out to be Tom, an art teacher, who has had his own life and is also single. Well she goes out of her way to get him and capture the lost love she felt with her dead husband.

Now this is not a bad film but it does suffer from the constant bad choices syndrome of Nikki. She compounds one mistake with another in a way to drag out what is in effect a very simple story. Harris is as enigmatic as ever in a role that could hardly be described as challenging, but the film lives or dies by the Benning character. And to be fair she makes a good go of what she has to play with. This won't be for everyone but is a nice enough film for all its flaws; I would give seven out of ten but am rounding up to four stars as I like the actors so much.",1426291200,,1193,3.966666666666667

It seemed a little slow going but built up in suspense and then seemed to fizzle a bit toward the end. I felt Annette Bening's character Nicki's pain and her fragile sanity very well and felt myself holding my breath a couple of times thinking she was going to have a complete break with reality.
The ending, not to give much away, wasn't anticipated but I also didn't expect a fairy tale ending either. I wish there was more dialogue with Tom and Nicki at the end but that you had to imagine what was said and facial expressions did say a lot.
I love Robin Williams and other than wanting to work with the actors involved, I don't know why he took a part so underused. Even when he spots her husband's ""double"" his face is expressionless compared to Nicki's daughter's very explosive reaction. I know that must have been the director's choice but it seemed odd to me since he was such good fiends with them.

6365904,3,B00JK7QTZE,"This could have been a very good movie with different stars.  Both Ed Harris and Annette Benning are simply way too old for the roles.  I would guess the story is about two people who are perhaps 45 to 50 years old.  After all, she has a daughter who has just entered college. They both look at least  65.  Ed Harris looks about 70. Benning's make up is so garish, especially on her eyes, that it is distracting.  All you are thinking about is how terrible she looks instead of about the story. You also wonder if she did her own makeup and WHY.  It's not possible that a real makeup artist did this unless they really hated her.  It is an interesting story of how a woman descends into a type of madness when she meets a man who looks like her dead husband.  She hides that fact for so long that when the big accidental  reveal happens it destroys everything.  One wonders why she didn't simply say as soon as they met ""I can't believe how much you look like my husband.  Is there any possibility that you and he could have been related in some way."" Instead she sneaks around stalking him then tries to turn him into the dead husband.  If she didn't want him to know about the resemblance why did she drag him to a restaurant they went too all the time then drag him to the same place in Mexico.  Benning did a good job of showing this descent into madness even willing to throw her daughter out in order to keep her make believe life with this man.  Robin Williams is, for some reason, in a totally throw away role so small you wonder why he even bothered to do it.",1411603200,3,1568,4.197324414715719

6365931,4,B00JK7QTZE,"Nikki's (Annette Bening) husband, Garrett, is portrayed by a semi facially-altered Ed Harris in a dual role.  He has passed away after thirty years of marriage to a now heartbroken Nikki.  She took each and every bit of his belongings and all reminders away from their home, as the pain of seeing them was too much for Nikki to bear.  The story moves ahead five years in modern day Los Angeles with its lovely Art Museum and city shots (photography by Antonio Riestra).  All through the present days her memory goes back in time and relives the memories she had with him right to their hideaway in Mexico.  She and Garrett have a grown daughter, Summer (Jess Weixler), who is living away from home.  Nikki's neighbor across the street, Roger, portrayed by Robin Williams, doesn't share much screen time but is effective in his role and an interesting character in the movie.  Williams has a shy charm and a slightly possessive regard for the 'possibility' of Nikki as a relationship in time, or is just envious of how strong her love with Garrett had been.  Besides being a friend to Nikki for so long, they share the fact that their spouses have passed away and have this in common. I feel that the role of Roger is involved in the story to show that one friend has gone through the grief process while the other has not, or has gotten lost along the way.

Tom (Harris, again) then appears to an astounded Nikki; his exact double, a doppelganger right in front of her eyes?  Was I supposed to suspend all of my disbelief for this to play out for me?  Not usually being very critical, I decided to go with the flow here and what this story did for me was become a suspenseful challenge that actually ended up winning me over. While I felt that there was not too much in the character building for Garrett beforehand. There was a great love of his wife. Concerning Harris as Tom though, I found him so warm, engaging, and, above all, I was very interested in him as a whole.  Tom was easy to like and the chemistry between Harris and Bening was so palpable.  She pursued him relentlessly becoming obsessed, (you decide) until a relationship quickly began with Tom.  He also was absolutely infatuated with her; the feelings here were mutual for Tom and Nikki in return ... or was she really in this?  There is a question hanging over the relationship.  I can't really offer it up here though it will be obvious while viewing.  I then began seeing this as a completely psychological study of Nikki's crumbling logic.  She begins to break and Tom is clueless of the reason and cannot understand  why.  When would she tell him of their 'resemblance' to one another or has she some other plans that will come to light while keeping him in the dark?

Director Arie Posin writes the screenplay along with Matthew McDuffie and the genre of the film was not as obvious as what I first had thought.  I completely had to grasp onto those feelings of the deep and abiding love she had for Garrett in the beginning. It keeps us within her mindset and had Nikki making a semblance of sense for me. I felt an urgent compassion for her situation and a reason for going in a direction that wasn't always justifiable.  With that said, I found my anxiety level growing with the suspense in viewing Nikki's resolve; is Nikki seeing clearly with what she is doing? The ending may leave some wanting although, for me, I was quite satisfied with it and could understand her pain with seeing Garrett, I mean 'Tom', right in front of her ...
Nowhere else than in a suspense-filled romance on the verge of a breakdown.",1408492800,11,3591,4.524767801857585

She feels this loss so deeply she tries to re-create the life she had had with her deceased husband with a man who looks like him. Roger (Williams) envied what he witnessed between Nikki and her husband so much that he pursues her for years after his wife dies but no sparks. Tom, (Harris) the look-alike, having lost his wife to another can't seem to get over it though it's been 10 years.

Ed Harris plays her long lost husband and his newly found doppelgnger, Tom. Robin Williams plays,Roger, a widowed neighbor who is in love with her. All, wonderful, fine actors lost in this film.

The first ten minutes of the film are quite fruitful, until Nikki sees Tom and follows him. We can all see the ending of this film, and I wanted to shout out, ""Get some psychiatric help, Nikki!"".

Oh wait, Im mixing up my double movies.  This isn't Enemy.

Lets start over.

Have you ever walked up to someone all excited, calling out a name, only to find that that person is not who you thought they were?  Weve all done it.  I do it almost every week when my wife decides shes going to wander Target and I have to try and locate her with three kids in tow.  But, Im not really talking about that they have the same color hair and I think thats the shirt my wife was wearing this morning kind of mistake.  Im talking about those moments where you see someone from afaryou see their FACEand you know that they are someone who they eventually wind up not being.  What if you swore it was someone who has died?  What if it was your dead husband?

In The Face of Love, Nikki faces this very situation.  Five years after the tragic drowning of her husband, Garrett, Nikki is still mourning.  He was the love of her life, and she cant let go.  She had to remove every reminder of him from her life, trying to distance herself from his memory, but she just cant move on.  Then something unexplainable happens.  She sees, from a distance, a man who she swears is her husband.  She shrugs it off, but she cant let it go, and so she stalks him, finds out where he works, Googles his name and winds up standing in his classroom (hes an art teacher), asking him for private art lessons.

Of course, they fall in love.

For the whole first quarter of the film, I was waiting for this to uncover itself as some lazy ghost story, but thankfully that idea gets squashed relatively quickly once we all meet Tom, the doubles, ex-wife.  What builds from this point forward is a really interesting story about a woman who is trying to hold onto her past by building a future.  The relationship is obviously unhealthy, because it is prohibiting Nikki from really moving on.  She isn't forming a new bond, a new relationship.  She is fooling herself into thinking that she still has a piece of her husband, and she doesnt.

Sadly, what builds as a really interesting premise is kind of completely shrugged off in the last act.  We are all waiting for this reveal, for Nikki to finally come clean and the climax to occur, but once it does it is all so anticlimactic and kind of lazy that I was almost hoping they would have bypassed that whole step altogether.  The fact that the last act actually makes the two main characters, especially Tom, look like idiots doesnt help.

I mean, really?  You go where?  And THEN you start asking questions?  And then, what next?  Youre really NOT going to tell us?

But, the performances here from both Harris and Bening are actually beautiful to watch.  Bening is remarkable here (until the last act, where she comes slightly unhinged and the script betrays her talent).  Harris starts off hammy (when hes playing Garrett in flashbacks) and I was really scared, but his portrayal of Tom is so tender and so natural.  The supporting cast is fine.  Sometimes Robin Williams is just uncomfortable to look at or watch act.  I don't know what it is, but he just breathes out this nervous energy that can be hard to take.

Alas, The Face of Love, as a complete film, is kind of a bust.  It asks all these great questions and presents a really intriguing premise and then throws away its big chance to make it all stick.  But its well worth checking out.  Its a brisk film with two really lovable leads, so despite my moderately low grade, I still recommend it.",1406764800,5,3622,4.40785498489426

Ed Harris, Robin Williams, and Annette Bening did the best they could but as the scripted lacked depth so did their characters.

6365970,3,B00JK7QTZE,"I planned on watching The Face of Love on the big screen and now so glad I didn't get to (never mind the $10 ticket price) as I was really disappointed in this movie.  The only reason I watched the entire movie on Amazon?  Plain and Simple:  Ed Harris.

The first sign for me that the movie wasn't going to go well?  Benning's telling Harris (as Tom) that her husband left her (giving Tom the impression that she was divorced) vs stating that she was a widow.  Hiccups in the dialogue continue with Benning's talking to Harris-Tom as if he was Harris-Garret (her husband of 30 years) and shared this life history.

I found Robin Williams' character. the neighbor with the crush on Benning, underutilized.  I'd say the same for the daughter, Summer, except for the extremely powerful encounter she has with Harris-Tom.

Overall, a major disappointment.  My advice for Amazon Prime Members?  Wait until it's part of the Prime movie family.",1405555200,3,937,4.722222222222222

It was nice to see a movie about older characters, this was an enjoyable chick flick, my husband watched too and said he liked it, but he wouldn't have chosen it.  Robin Williams and Amy Brenneman (another favorite of mine) were both good as supporting actors.

8651694,5,B00JK7QTZE,"The slamming of this movie by some of the so-called career ""critics"" only validated my long held opinion that many of them are full of pretentious sh*t.  I saw Annette Benning interviewed on ""Popcorn"" where she named this movie along with ""Mother and Child"" as two movies she felt had not been recognized for their value.  Rating her opinion and my own consideration of the synopsis for the film over the critics, I'm so glad I didn't miss it.

As far as those who don't get this movie, maturity is sometimes long in coming; sometimes it never does.  I'm sure my 18 year old son wouldn't like this film.  I don't fault him for that; he's young.  But I would fault him for writing a review trashing the film even though he and everyone else is entitled to their opinion.  Instead, even with a lack of age and therefore maturity or personal experience with death, I would encourage him to open his mind and his heart; to try to broaden his capacity for empathy.  I'm not sure I could have really appreciated this film in my youth or before I lost deeply loved ones but I wouldn't have roasted it either.  As a intensive care adult, pediatric, and neonatal health care provider for over 20 years, I have seen a lot of death of people's loved ones as well as having experienced it personally.  From what I have observed, people cope in highly individual and varied ways.  While some modes of grieving may be healthier than others, it is not for us to judge the time it takes or the method a person needs to accomplish that journey.

In closing, I applaud everyone who made this film possible.  If you are a person of discernment and/or maturity, I think you will enjoy the eventual triumph over grief that this film portrayed so beautifully.",1490486400,3,1737,4.5111821086261985
