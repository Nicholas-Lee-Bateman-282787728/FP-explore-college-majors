It bears watching several times at least, and a periodic review of it would assuredly be helpful as well.  I was impressed, and I have raised dogs for over 20 years.  Evaluating puppies is one of the most difficult endeavors because you are making decisions at a young age based on what you see at that time which you hope indicates certain desirable traits as an adult.  This will help you narrow the field.",1448064000,,534,4.53125
