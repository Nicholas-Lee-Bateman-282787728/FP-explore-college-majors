2379586,1,B000A8AY62,"I used to love Gilligan's Island, and I have enjoyed introducing my kids to the old shows, so innocent.  I have bought the seasons shows on DVD and I would definantly recommend that, but the movie... that is a different story.  I was a little disappointed by the story line, but more than that was the ""B"" quality of the movie and the shocking acting!",1243814400,,351,4.384615384615385

8076267,4,B000A8AY62,"I have read several negative reviews about the quality of the version of ""Rescue from Gilligan's Island.""  Upon watching this version, I must say that the sound and picture are not typical DVD quality.  This was not that big of a deal to me, however, because the price of this DVD was very reasonable.  I had not seen this movie in years, and five minutes into watching the movie, I was not thinking about the picture or sound.  I was just happy to be watching the movie and happy that I finally owned my own copy of it.",1310688000,2,520,4.275510204081633
8076268,1,B000A8AY62,I have been an avid Movie collector for quite some years now.  This is the first time I was not impressed with the quality of the product.  I found the sound to be muffled and picture quality was absolutely terrible.  It was watchable but not with surround sound had to watch movie and use the tv speakers on low so we could hear what they were saying.  I would not recommend buying this movie even though it is one of the rescue episodes for Gilligans Island.  Look for a digitally restored version if you can.,1298851200,,511,4.336842105263158

8076270,3,B000A8AY62,my kids liked watching it and didn't seem to care about the bad color and sound.  Not very well made!,1277078400,2,101,4.05
