1224121,5,B00000INB3,"This is my first experience with Ms. Voight, and I was pleasantly surprised. This  video leaves you feeling very calm and euphoric, and the music is pleasant as well. There is 10 minutes of warm up followed by 30 minutes of full body stretching.

I was most impressed with her descriptions of the stretches, which allowed me to concentrate on the movement instead of trying to watch what she was doing and compromising my form.

I will purchase more of her videos based on this one.

There is no equipment to buy - just a couple of towels. Great Job Karen!",1105401600,29,556,4.475247524752476
1224122,3,B00000INB3,"The cover of this DVD looks very sophisticated and new, yet the material inside is very old.  I looked inside and the copyright date is 1991, which is exactly how it looks.  Very deceiving.

However, the stretches covered by Karen are very good, even though for more active people it may be boring (but stretching is not for entertainment or fun, it's to help your body out).  After going through the session (I have not stretched before), my body had a welcome warm feeling and it was the best feeling I've felt in a while.  It's what my body has been waiting for.  So if you are a semi- or regular exerciser, you need a DVD such as this to show you the proper techniques for lengthening and stretching your muscles so you can perform better.",1097280000,43,743,4.426470588235294
1224123,4,B00000INB3,This 35 minute stretch workout is just right to loosen up after an aerobic exercise session or to start the day.  It hits most body areas so I feel stretched all over.  Several variations of most stretches are demonstrated for different levels of flexability.  The pace is relaxed and explanations are clear.  I use this tape weekly to supplement other exercise.,1031443200,4,362,4.885245901639344
1224124,5,B00000INB3,This is one of the best videos for people who have 40 minutes or less to work out.  I have been using my tape for over 2 years and love it as much today as when I first started using it.  I heard about the Video from a fitness instructor.  Since I started using it I have recommended it to lots of my friends and family and so far no one has been disapointed.,1020643200,5,359,3.824324324324324
1224125,3,B00000INB3,"I don't use this tape any more, as I am now into yoga and pilates which give me as much stretching as i need - and more than this.  However it has a lot to recommend it.  the cueing is excellent, the moves are thorough, it leaves you pleasantly stretched out and kind of relaxed.  I stress the kind of - I stopped using this tape because it started making me nervous.  I don't know why Karen Voight made so many tapes with a bunch of participants hovering behind her.  I can only see the point of having one other participant who is performing more or less advanced versions.  This video - well, I can forgive cheesy sets and hairdos, but there is one participant who grins ALL THE TIME.  She's a bit like the intermediate participant in All the Right Moves - it gets to the point where I can't do a tape any more because of the irritating fixed grin which makes me think of Stepford Wives.  So if you are more zen then me, go for it.  Otherwise - don't!",1018483200,6,954,4.169398907103825
1224126,5,B00000INB3,I am a 55 year old female with osteoarthritis. I use this tape after I've completed my aerobic workout when my body temperature is up.  Karen starts with 5 minutes of standing dynamic stretches and then the remainder of the tape consists of 20-30 second static stretches on the floor. The neck stretches are exceptionally thorough and have relieved the stiffness in that area of my body. The music is soothing as is Karen's voice; my only complaint is that she doesn't smile during the entire video.  I use the video 3 times a week and am experiencing much more flexability.  I highly recommend it.,984096000,42,598,4.6761904761904765
1224127,5,B00000INB3,"I have eight of Karen's inspiring workouts. These have been collected over the years. Lately she is getting more into Yoga and total body workouts which I prefer. Working on a computer can wear you out physically because  you are bending forward and using your shoulder muscles so much of the  time. Using Pure and Simple Stretch is one of the ways I unwind at the end  of a day.  I hope Karen will be making more stretch videos in the future.

1224128,4,B00000INB3,"Have been looking for videos on stretching. When I found this one I gave it a chance. Found it very relaxing. Helped me realize just how stiff I had become. Have been going to doctors about pain in my back and feet.  The  pain I was experiencing was from some form of numbness.  This video has a  shown me that my problem lied in how stiff I had become from sitting in a  chair all day at work and then at home. The only draw back is that there is  not a more advanced tape once I have mastered this one, and I do want to  progress.  39 year old male.",937699200,49,551,3.900900900900901

1224161,1,B00000INB3,"This DVD came in a small cardboard sleeve, not a plastic case, so I was a bit disappointed by that. Also, as others have stated, the content of this DVD is very dated, despite the contemporary outfit Karen wears on the cover. The stretches seem very basic, and I didn't like the pacing of the DVD overall. I had to return this one, and was annoyed to discover that I got charged for return shipping as well as 50% of the item price because I had removed the shrink wrap. (Of course, how could I try the DVD without removing the shrink wrap?) So, buyer beware!",1454284800,2,559,4.283018867924528

1224166,4,B00000INB3,Perfectly good stretching video.  Karen is almost entirely deadpan with no expression at all.  There are three others in the video and they were actually a distraction.  I preferred AM and PM Stretch by quite a margin.  After more than a week of daily stretching the effect has been remarkable.  I feel much better.,1429056000,2,315,4.7592592592592595

1224182,5,B00000INB3,I like the stretches.  This tape stretches everything and gives the stretch about 30 seconds which is good.  The instructor is very monotone.  But that doesn't matter as long as the stretches work.,1420416000,,197,4.909090909090909

1224203,5,B00000INB3,"I've been using this stretch routine since it was on VHS, and I was thrilled that Amazon sells it in DVD format. You will need a yoga mat (or other surface to sit on), towel or yoga strap, and possibly a folded blanket to put under your tailbone during some seated positions, depending on how you feel. The stretches are safe, effective and no-nonsense - you won't have to sit through a bunch of New Age gobbledegook about chakras and chi, this is strictly for muscle/joint health and physical performance. Voight's instructions are great for ensuring you're doing the stretches safely and effectively, and she allows for different levels of flexibility, which is very important. Her presentation is a bit robotic, but the routine itself is so beneficial that you shouldn't be put off by that. Relaxing music is a plus. This is great if you want to relieve stress at the end of the day, work out the kinks from sitting at a desk, or thoroughly stretch your muscles after a workout. Even my husband likes it!",1406851200,10,1007,4.662921348314606

1224205,5,B00000INB3,"This is a very old video (1991), but don't be fooled - it's hands down the BEST full body stretch I know - without committing to a 2-hour yoga class.  If you know going in it's old-school, you won't be surprised.  I actually had it on VHS, and bought it here on DVD - because I NEED it!  My muscles are genetically VERY tight - and this stretch changes everything for me.  Buy it... you'll agree.",1405036800,3,396,4.171052631578948

1224209,4,B00000INB3,"This is more like normal stretching, not so much the Yoga type. Buyer beware not to push your self and over exert yourself if you have had any back problems. I had over done it, and felt the muscle tighten up an hour later, not good. So take it slowly. So stretches may be a little challenging but for the most part there are models that will be showing you an easier version. Good buy.",1402272000,3,386,4.16
1224210,5,B00000INB3,"This is as the title says pure and simple stretch. After you have done it, your body will feel wonderful.

It took a couple of days to get ""approval"" from this company to be allowed to return it and then I was told that I had to pay the postage to send it back! I reviewed as much as possible of the DVD even with the constant stops and starts and found that it was nothing special. These are very standard stretches available on virtually any stretching DVD.

1224234,3,B00000INB3,"The actual stretch workout is good enough for days when you don't want anything vigorous, but the formatting is weird....you have to select the segment you want to watch, which is very annoying. Also, this must be an early production because although the instructions are clear enough, Karen doesn't seem as comfortable in front of the camera as in later DVD's I have....no big deal as far as the actual quality of the workout, but somewhat distracting to watch and listen to.",1390262400,,476,4.817073170731708
1224235,5,B00000INB3,I have followed Karen for years. She is a pro. She doesn't rush through the stretches and it is almost meditative. She also comes up with stretches I have not seen before that are effective.,1389398400,,190,4.457142857142857
1224236,3,B00000INB3,"This is a good dvd for beginner stretching. It is not too intense, but you can get a good stretch. As others have stated, it does have some age on it, but it is still a good starting dvd.",1386547200,,187,3.8205128205128207
1224237,2,B00000INB3,"I read many reviews on this video, most of which were positive. The age of the video didn't bother me at all. Yes, the hair & clothing were dated, but that should affect the actual workout. Neither should the fact that the other people in the video were even a little creepy looking (especially the man).
The fact is, this is far from the best stretching video out there. I purchased the video in hopes of increasing my flexibility. I workout with heavy weights several times a week using Cathe videos at home. I do the stretches at the end of each of her workouts, but they are short. I wanted something to do on my off days. Several weeks before buying this video, I purchased Lastics. It was amazing; I couldn't believe how great I felt after a simple stretching video. The problem was, Lastics is an hour long. I have a hard time fitting that into my schedule on top of work and kids, plus regular workouts. So, I thought the Karen Voight video would be shorter and just as good. I was completely wrong. This workout was no different than the typical stretch offered at the end of any exercise video. It was shorter than Lastics, but much less effective. Nothing new and very boring. I wouldn't recommend to anyone.",1386374400,15,1219,4.4708520179372195

I'm in my fifties and in moderate shape, but I know that I need to improve my flexibility. This video works for me. The best part is that she holds the poses for a long time. In future, I'll likely skip the 10 minute standing stretch. The floor stretch is fine. While I wish there had been more focus on hamstrings and inner thighs, I did find the neck and upper back stretch at the end to be extremely helpful and relaxing.",1377907200,4,517,4.285714285714286

It's nice that Karen includes men in her workout. My husband and I are both over 50 and regular stretching becomes more and more important every day.

1224276,5,B00000INB3,"Yep.  Pure and simple.  Usually a rave like this is from someone that is a friend with a person related to the product.  I'm not, but I have been using this routine since it came out ten years ago, so, I owe Karen one.

This workout is full body stretch, stretching only one,  or at the most two, muscle groups at a time.  So,you are not trying a complex position that may discourage you from continuing. A simple stretch also allows you to focus purely on the stretch.  Karen works the routine with you, giving you sufficient time to stretch the muscles, not just demonstrating the pose. Pure and simple.

However, if you are suffering serious issues in certain areas, you would likely have to hold the stretches longer or do more reps for that area.  The stretches are probably not intended to be held long enough for serious condition. But the techniques themselvers are effective, they just need to be done longer. So, put the DVD on hold or go back after the routine for problem areas.

What puts this workout into the excellent ranking is the neck/shoulder routine at the end of the workout.  It's about 5 to 10 minutes of neck stretches,making it ideal for anyone suffering neck issues.

If you do have neck issues, you can skip to the end, do the neck  routine once or twice a day, and it will definitely help alleviate your issue.  I'm a massage therapist and have shown the neck sretches I learned here to some of my clients suffering neck issues.

This DVD may not be for fitness folks that feel that have to burn and sweat at every workout.  The tone is relaxing, focusing on improving flexibility, which too many people ignore in their fitness program, which can lead to injury.",1237852800,28,1691,4.531353135313531

I tend to carry a lot of stress in this area of my body and my chiropractor recommended that I find a video that concentrated on that area since I found exercise cards a bit annoying.",1203897600,20,443,4.285714285714286
1224281,5,B00000INB3,"As a personal trainer, the hardest part of my job is getting clients to stretch. Most find it boring, others feel it's a waste of time.  The rest try to do stretches but just have no idea what they are actually aiming for or where they should be feeling it.  90% of the people I see stretching (instructors included) have no idea what muscle they are stretching and don't know where they should be ""feeling it"".  This video is very simple, undecorated and relaxing. Karen does an impeccable job of cueing the stretches both physically and verbally. You always know exactly what you are stretching, where you should feel it and how hard to push. She also shows how to modify the stretches and sticks with a number of very effective, but not risky stretches. Her voice is soothing, not jarring and the music is simple and quiet.  I have viewed some other videos that demonstrate strethes 75% of my clients couldn't even begin to get into. Karen steers clear of that.  Yes, aesthetically, it is an ""older"" video, but newer is not always better.  I give this one my highest recommendation.",1199750400,7,1085,4.625
1224282,4,B00000INB3,"Everyone wrote great reviews about how this DVD looks & the movements. I just want to add that the pace is very slow & thorough, the music is very soft.
All these stretches can be done by even many people who are inflexible. Those who are flexible should look elsewhere.

1224293,5,B00000INB3,"I would do Karen Voight's Pure and Simple Stretch every day if I could. In fact, I'm trying to find time to do it after every single one of my workouts while my muscles are warm. At first, you may be a little turned off by Karen's monotone voice and too serious mood (she has definitely improved her stage presence since this video's release in 1991). And you may also need to work to look past all the high-top sneakers, full-body unitards, pixie haircuts and the strange man in the back whose black-rimmed glasses and slicked-back hair make him look more than a little creepy. But you must look past it. There's a reason this video is still being sold 15 years after it was produced. This is a classic workout that will have you feeling truly relaxed and rejuvenated. Not a single muscle in your body is ignored. It took me a few times to finally feel what Karen means when she says to ""breathe into the stretch"", but once you feel it you know you're doing your body a huge favor. I've only been doing this for two weeks and have already noticed an improvement in how far I can take the stretches. I convinced my husband to try the 10-minute standing workout in order to ease some tension he carries in his neck, and he loves it too. This is one after-workout ritual that I really look forward to.",1156636800,11,1299,4.371900826446281
1224294,4,B00000INB3,"I give this 4 stars because the menu function is faulty - you have the option of doing the full workout (40 mins) the standing stretch (10 mins) and the floor stretch (30 mins) but when I click on 'full workout' it stops after the standing section and goes back to the menu again! A minor glitch, but still annoying as I have to keep the remote handy.  None of my other Karen Voight dvds do this, so it is their fault and not my player.
I bought this as I find most workouts have only a few rushed minutes tacked onto the end for stretching and I need more.  Karen is the only one that holds the stretch for the recommended 20-30 seconds and this is what you need to get results.
As for the stretching, the standing part is ok, but the good stretches are in the floor section where she works all muscles from neck to calf - great hamstring, quad and inner thigh work.
Yes she is a little deadpan in her delivery and the costumes and make-up are very 1980's but the workout is safe (no ballistic stretches) and effective.  I don't look at the screen much when I'm stretching so it doesn't bother me - I like to concentrate on my breathing and close my eyes to help me relax into it.  Great for those of us who want an athletic stretch and aren't keen on the mind/body focus of yoga.
This is suitable for beginners to early intermediates, but if you want more of a challenge, try Stott Pilates Simple Stretches (not simple, more intermediate to advanced) as this is a more current dvd and beautifully produced - see my other reviews for details on this one.",1147132800,33,1555,4.27891156462585
1224295,5,B00000INB3,"Karen is a terrific instructor and she's great here too.  She leads you through dynamic and static stretches.  This is good for increased total-body flexibility.  She starts with faster dynamic stretches to warm you up (warm ALL of you up) and then you go into  20-30 second static moves that concentrate on the legs, butt and arms at three different intensity levels.  There is good and clear cuing, techniuqe tips and overall relaxing mood and music.  I love doing this workout.  It's good either on it's own after a tough day, or after an intense workout.",1138060800,9,558,4.75
1224296,4,B00000INB3,I really liked this video. I was looking for a BASIC stretch video and this was it. It is a good length 40min total and she explains the stretches well. great to use a few times  a week for a deeper stretch. NOT YOGA..just basic athletic type stretches,1137369600,12,252,4.25
1224297,5,B00000INB3,"Along with Madeleine Lewis's AM and PM Stretch DVD, this is wonderfully easy to follow, gentle , calm, and very relaxing yet at the same time, exhilarating.  Karen eases you into each stretch, and allows the benefits of every move to be maximized. Her breathing instructions are excellent, and contribute to the efficacy of the routine. Try it--you'll like it.",1136937600,11,360,5.0
1224298,2,B00000INB3,"I gave this DVD 2 stars and I was being generous because I'm a long-time Karen Voight fan. I've been a Personal Trainer for several years and am always looking for material to stay on the cutting edge. This DVD certainly wasn't current or very informative since it was produced so long ago. I read the other reviews prior to purchasing this one and should have been warned, but I remember Karen Voight's work to be of a higher caliber than most so I gave it a try. Don't make the same mistake I have! This DVD should be put away with your pink leg warmers and matching scrunchies.",1134864000,10,580,4.330275229357798
1224299,5,B00000INB3,I feel absolutely WONDERFUL after doing this video! The stretching is so deep and thorough. This video leaves me so relaxed and untensed. This will be my cool down stretch after my workout every day.,1125792000,5,199,4.714285714285714
1224300,4,B00000INB3,"I have to admit....  The first time I tried this DVD, I hated.  I felt like the stretches were awkward and I must not be doing them right.  The second time I tried it, it felt better to me.  And the third time I tried it, I actually liked it.  I really started to focus on letting go, sinking into the stretch and relaxing, but not straining.  It is a little boring, especially where each stretch is held for such a long time - but I guess this is what makes it so effective.  And I feel so relaxed by the end of it. I am a huge fan of Karen Voight's workouts, but not her personality.  She seems very robotic and unfriendly, which is a little annoying.  Not only that, but the set is horrible, and the other people in the video seem like Zombies.  One of my pet-peeves about workout DVDs is when the set is cluttered with pointless background people - it is just a distraction.  One of the reasons why I quit the gym is that I hated being crowded - so I don't want to look at a DVD where the set is crowded.  All that being said - I am really starting to like this DVD and feel the benefits of it.",1115251200,16,1098,3.9862385321100917
1224301,5,B00000INB3,"This is one of the best stretching videos out there, it is very calming and will stretch you from head to toe.

This is one of Karen's earlier videos from 1991, you will see a much more serious Karen than in her more recent videos. I don't think she smiles once in the video, but for me it doesn't take away from a great stretching routine. The entire routine is 40 minutes, starting out with a 10 minute standing routine, then 30 minutes of floor stretching. All the stretches are held for 20-30 seconds, and Karen offers a lot of details and helpful tips for each stretch and also giving options to for deeper stretches. A towel is used to aid stretching for those less flexible. Karen has 3 exercisers with her, one of them is a man who is good to
watch for those with limited flexibility. Those looking for yoga should look elsewhere as this is athletic type stretching. But if you are looking for a relaxing stretch video, this is a good one. The music is new agey/jazz type music which suits the atmosphere well.

The DVD also offers some of Karen's walking tips, you will see a more recent Karen in this segment. There are also clips of some of her other videos featured as well.",1113091200,108,1186,4.386363636363637
1224302,5,B00000INB3,"This is the transferred-to-DVD version of Karen's classic Pure and Simple Stretch video and it shows in the less-than-smooth transitions between the stretching chapters.  The costumes and hairstyles are dated, so if that sort of thing bothers you, stay away.  Karen's pinky-lavender and bright blue ensemble is a good reminder of why the 80s haven't come back--yet.  The cover design is the same as it always was.

There are two stretching sections, one standing (10 minutes) and one on the floor (30 minutes).  You can do them in one continuous 40 minute program or do them separately.  The stretches flow smoothly from one to the next and are held a good, long time, much longer than in most stretching videos.  Karen's very serious demeanor isn't everyone's cup of tea, but her cueing is excellent; after you've done the routine once or twice, you can do it without watching, just listening, and she gives tips for proper form right at the places where you need them.  All you need to do the stretches is a mat (if you want one), and one or two folded towels for the floor stretches.

There are two women and a man doing the stretches with her. Karen gives different levels of some of the stretches, encouraging you to do what is comfortable for you and stop when something pulls or hurts.  Unlike in many videos/DVDs, the others are not demonstrating the different levels of stretching, with one doing beginner and one intermediate and so on; all three just stretch along with her, doing what seems comfortable for them.  There is NO chit chat at all on this DVD; Karen is all business and the others never open their mouths.

The music is New Age (if you like New Age, you will recongize some of the names)and is relaxing and unobtrusive; the set is plain.  There are some extras on the DVD that are not on the video, but they aren't anything to write home about.  The walking tips are nice but nothing special and the rest are just ads for Karen's other products.

If you like yoga-style stretching, this will probably not be the DVD for you.  This is an athletic-style stretch.  But if you want a good, sound stretching video that will leave you feeling relaxed and energized at the same time, then this is a great choice.  There's a reason that the video is considered a classic and I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in a solid stretching program.",1110499200,78,2371,4.6181384248210025
7910895,4,B00000INB3,"Works great for what I need. Physical therapy was causing me pain, whereas these stretches do not cause pain. I tried Lastics but that was way too advanced so I decided to try this and it is much friendly to those of us who cannot make our bodies go in to pretzel shapes or touch our heads to our knees. So what if it's an older stretch routine. It works. I can combine this with low-key yoga or tai chi and it seems to be easier for my body. Physical therapy should not be painful, I don't care what the ""experts"" say at the rehab center. I need to be functional every day and not have down days. I think I have found ways to treat myself (other than massage therapy). The physical therapist didn't even do any massage on me before or after my last session. I let her know I was unhappy about that. Sorry, too much info, but I just needed to vent. :)",1519344000,,851,4.1017964071856285

7910903,1,B00000INB3,"I got this dvd along with a half dozen other stretching dvds, and this one couldn't hold a candle to any of the others. This one is an outdated stretch program. I am surprised something as bad as this could have so many positive reviews.  My guess is these other reviewers don't have any other stretching dvd to compare it to? I felt I had to get on here and save other people from the bad purchase I fell into. I almost popped this dvd out as soon as it started to play due to the old-fashioned styling, including the over-the-hip leotard that I hated even back in the day (the cover photo is not representative). But, I figured that was a pretty superficial reason to give this a pass, so I continued to play it. However, it's not just the attire that's sorely out of date - the stretch program is as well. This is all passive stretching, and strangely focused at that. The 10 minute standing program (which apparently also serves as the first 10 minutes of the 40 minute program) is dedicated almost exclusively to stretching the sides of your torso. (Tamilee gets your whole body addressed in 10 minutes, and has longer programs as well in her stretch dvd). The floor program then moves on, but the program continued to just not be inspiring at all. Besides Tami Lee, try the gaiam 2 dvd set, or lastics, or the resistance stretching dvd, or pretty much anything other than this one.",1472947200,2,1387,4.460629921259843
