Forget everything you know about cheese and just give this one a spin in the dvd player!  If you're not rolling on the ground laughing, there's something wrong with you!  The focus is on a group of teens who retreat to a house in the woods for spring break...little do they know that SOMETHING IS OUT THERE!!!  Big time low-budget, and big time laughs!",1056758400,12,444,4.5
4181544,5,B003R9K0GU,"Check this film out!  ""There's Nothing Out There"" makes you wonder where Wes Craven's team came up with some of their ideas for ""Scream"" (""There's Nothing Out There"" was released five years before ""Scream"")...hmmmm, I wonder.  It's good campy fun.",1012435200,2,247,5.15
4181545,5,B003R9K0GU,"Well, I wish this is how all discs were released. This one has it all. A blooper reel, Audition footage, deleted shots, and best of all, a commentary track. I've always found that the best commentary tracks are on low budget movies as they are always the most informative and fun to listen to. I hate paying inflated prices for discs that don't have any of these extras, but this one was a nice surprise. As for the film itself, I remember thinking when I first saw it that it was a great premise having a main character being able to survive because he was an expert in horror movies. Years later I was pretty shocked to see that the Scream series ""borrowed"" heavily from elements of There's Nothing Out There. Throw in some funny dialogue, a ton of gratuitous nudity and you have a classic!",1011830400,26,792,4.431506849315069
4181546,5,B003R9K0GU,"Small budgeted, but well done Comedy uses the same formula as Scream, but was first to do so. The characters in the film, for the most part, know they are in a 'horror' film, and one of them knows the rules that just might get them out alive. As they head up to a secluded cabin in the woods Mike, who has, ""seen every horror film available on tape,"" tries to warn his friends, but of couse, it's too late. And after almost every female has lost her top, and every trick in the book is used, the monster attacks. Only when the character's take the situation too seriously in the last half hour does the movie lose any of it substance. *** stars out of ****
The DVD presents the film in it's original widescreen aspect ratio of approximately 1.77:1. The transfer is anamorphic and boasts some nice colors, deep blacks, and overall pleased me. Especially for a movie of such a limited budget.
The sound is good, again, for such an old movie, with a low budget, don't expect too much. But I didn't notice an hissing or noise that would distract the viewer. The only complaint would be that sometimes dialogue isn't always that great sounding, but again, low budget.
Extras Include --- Audio Commentary by director Rolfe Kanefsky and cast members; I found the track to be rather entertaining. They touch on many aspects of the movie, ane never seem dull or bored. Deleted Footage and bloopers; The deleted scenes are merely longer cuts of existing scenes, although they add relatively nothing to the film, they are nice to have. The bloopers are a real treat, and it is funny to see the actor's really messing up their lines. Theatrical Trailer, which I found to be rather funny; Production Stills, show many different stills from behind the scenes that I enjoyed; Storyboard-to-film comparisons, they were interesting, and for a change, we could see them on the same screen; Auditions and rehearsals were funny, however I found it rather funny only the women are asked to appear naked...(to test physical aspects to see if they could handle the stunts)
Overall I think Image Entertainment did a good job, and Rolfe Kanefsky deserves much credit for caring about a film he did so long ago. If only more film-makers would be so passionate about their original work. The DVD has good picture, good sound, and a ton of extra features, this one is a no brainer.

4181577,3,B003R9K0GU,"Something sinister is loose in the woods, and if these teens hope to survive the night, they had better listen to their friend Mike, who knows all of the rules when it comes to surviving a Horror movie! Try as he may, Mike just can't seem to stop his friends from heading out into the woods alone or going skinny dipping in the lake, but he knows better than to investigate that strange noise in the bushes, himself! THERE'S NOTHING OUT THERE is a Horror movie that has been tailored specifically for Horror fans, and as redundant as that may sound, one's knowledge of the genre is sure to dictate their overall enjoyment of the film. Rolfe Kanefsky plays off of all the major Horror tropes with a sly, pointed sense of humor. The only downside is that the humor is presented in the most annoying form possible, through the obnoxious character of Mike. Mike becomes so overbearing that it's a wonder his own friend didn't kill him, first. The cheesy rubber monster and stereotypical teen characters only add to the high camp of the picture. THERE'S NOTHING OUT THERE has understandably earned itself a strong cult following over the years, and serves as an entertaining precursor to the SCREAM series.

4181578,2,B003R9K0GU,"More horrible than horror, it reeks of low budget and limited imagination.  I bought it on the strength of all the reviews posted here but couldn't find any of the attributes they raved about.  I found little to compare it to Scream (as in, it wouldn't stand up to a plagiarism lawsuit).  One small element in common isn't enough to condemn either project on the grounds of originality, or lack thereof.  Strictly amateur; it even fails on the level of a curio.

I'm still trying to decide if I'm at least glad I watched it this one time.  At any rate, it isn't a keeper!",1300752000,,571,4.390476190476191

4181580,5,B003R9K0GU,"From the geniuses behind Tromeo & Juliet comes the scariest, bloodiest, sexiest and bestest film of the 80s.

4181581,5,B003R9K0GU,"This updated, 20th Anniversary version of this over-looked camp horror classic looks and sounds great. When I saw that this was coming out I decided that it was finally time to replace the ol' VHS and boy was it worth it. The updated DVD has improved sound and colors and the special features were fun too. A camp horror classic in the vein of Scream, if you like things that are violent, campy, and funny, then you will totally dig this flick.",1294704000,5,444,4.426829268292683

Review of Prime streaming version:

Super fun early 1990s monster movie that's aged quite well.

IMDb says it had a budget of $350,000.

People say this inspired* the big budget Scream franchise, and yeah, it's pretty obvious that's what happened (minus the horn-dog alien).

But I find There's Nothing Out There! much more enjoyable than the Scream films.

The acting and soundtrack are above average for movies of this sort.

If you love low-budget horror and sci-fi from the 80s and 90s, you'll most likely love There's Nothing Out There!

This thing has cult classic written all over it.

* ""inspired"" is Hollywood-speak for ""ripped-off""",1524960000,2,696,4.982608695652174
8403428,5,B003R9K0GU,"After a boffo opening that had me longing for the mom 'n' pop video shops of yesteryear, THERE'S NOTHING OUT THERE! (1991) begins! A group of high school friends head out to a house in the deep woods, for their spring break. Along the way, they drive past a tragic scene, the cause of which was shown during the movie's intro. Upon arriving at the remote location, their partying starts. Unbeknownst to these kids, something has decided to join them! Something quite possibly... not of this world! Bizarre events take place almost immediately. The horror fanatic of the group, named Mike (Craig Peck), expects hideous, grisly disaster at every turn. Luckily for us, he's right! Otherworldly, hideous grisliness ensues! Along w/ copious nudity. This film is for both the ultra-low budget horror enthusiast AND the self-aware, parody lover. Loaded w/ purposeful cheeeze and stereotypical characters. Is there superior acting? No. Deep, philosophical dialogue? Mmmm, no. More fun than a barrel full of quivering monkey guts? Y-E-S!! The monster is sheer, rubbery perfection! The face-melting sequence is incredible-ness itself! The beheading is brilliance on toast- w/ tomato! The final conflict will have you saving light bulbs, and praying to your gods for a girlfriend like Stacy (Bonnie Bowers)! One of a handful of TROMA releases that are truly worth watching! View this right now! Now, I tells ya!...",1512259200,2,1403,5.185022026431718
8403429,4,B003R9K0GU,"This was ADORABLE! I love horror, and I have a soft spot for good campy horror that doesn't take itself seriously. With Troma it's hit and miss but mostly hit if you ask me. I'm fussy about my camp and this kept me entertained the whole time. I would definitely recommend this one to my friends. If you're looking for something that's not too heavy, thats really silly but not exactly stupid give this one a shot.",1493942400,,413,4.376623376623376
8403430,4,B003R9K0GU,"So bad its good.
3-1/2 stars would be more accurate...... and this film was made for about $50 ......... but.
Slow for the first 30 minutes or so. Then picks up.
The actors (probably paid with pizza and weed) deliver some really bad acting deliberately played for camp effect. Their reactions to grisly death scenes and the rubbery monster during the second half are a lot of fun to watch.
If you're looking for suspense and horror, look somewhere (anywhere) else. The real amusement value is watching these idiots try to save themselves from a very cheap special effects monster that isn't much smarter than they are. The only suspense here is who will get themselves killed off first, the idiot college kids or the rubbery monster. (Both sides take a lot of abuse toward the end.)
Warning.... you Realllllllly need to shut off your mind to enjoy this film.",1454716800,,858,4.726666666666667

8403434,5,B003R9K0GU,"I love this movie! It has just the right amount of campy cheezy horror 80's fun to take u on a giggle fest of witty comedy with a cheezy monster puppet that is more hilarious than visually convincing. Funny and witty dialogue. Not all the actors are the greatest, but a couple Actors do a superb job. This is a Troma release I think is a MUST have! If you enjoy Troma, this is a good one. Just as great as other Troma releases. I compair it in greatness right next to; Terror Firmer, Dead Dudes in the House, Class of Nuke 'Em High and Redneck Zombies. I give it a full 5 stars because It is a charming horror comedy, and it really deserves as much recognition as other Troma Gems.",1407024000,,681,4.166666666666667
8403435,5,B003R9K0GU,"This one's never a downer; it's a ""out of towner""! If ever there was a European/Japanese sentiment in a movie it is this one, which don't see the women as sex objects to be captured and carried, but legitimate heroines in they own right. At the end, at the end, I considered they my friends. At they beginning of they movie, I knew I'd be seeing them again. They a girl in she bikini zone, I telling you she all alone. She had they sticky friendlies on. Yes it was tricky, bon vivante. I did enjoy they panty area, though it was a bit severe of ya, to do it to me, yes it's true. I found tomatoes in the stew.

8403436,5,B003R9K0GU,"This  is a crap movie. It was made as a crap and from the outset it makes no attempt to be taken seriously. Every cliche in the ""Cabiin the woods seige"" genra is explored including, but not limited to
* Charictors in high school played be actors in their mid 30's
* Gate crashers to the secluded lake (who then pack up and leave when told it's private property)
* A skinny dipping scene (don't get your hopes up)
* And the most creative ever escape from a monster (throwing a cat as distraction and swinging on the boom mike)
 All in all a good laugh.",1360454400,,551,4.188679245283019
