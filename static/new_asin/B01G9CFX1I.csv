8762639,5,B01G9CFX1I,"A wonderful series , one of the best of the 60s, written with much subtility and with excellent performances by the regular cast and the guest stars. I really wait for the second season to be released. It would be a crime to deprive us from such a brilliant exploration of the psychological world",1490572800,2,296,4.5
8762640,2,B01G9CFX1I,"If you like overly acted, melodramatic crap from the early 1960's, this series if for you! I purchased the Season 1, Part 1 of The Eleventh Hour as a gift for my wife for Christmas. While the video quality is superb, the story lines, acting and portrayal of psychology were far below expectations. This is especially true for the episodes regarding women. Every woman was screaming maniac, totally unhinged from reality. It is no wonder that people avoided seeking psychological counseling, if this type of trash was their reference point. I would only recommend this series to someone who is studying bad television, or to people in the field of psychology and mental illness who need a good laugh.",1490486400,,699,4.882352941176471

8762643,5,B01G9CFX1I,"I missed ""The Eleventh Hour"" when it originally aired decades ago, and only discovered it due to this DVD release. But the wait was worth it, as I clearly wouldn't have appreciated these superb stories as a small boy. Now I'm struck by just how intelligent & literate they are, all without sacrificing any drama or just plain entertainment. It's especially fascinating to see how many of the best series from the early 1960s dealt with topics that would soon become taboo, not to be mentioned again until the 1970s at the earliest -- and even better, those topics are handled in a complex, three-dimensional manner.

Some reviewers refer to ""dated"" aspects in these episodes -- I disagree. They're certainly of their time, which used different approaches to storytelling than today ... but in many ways, those ""dated"" aspects are in fact superior to some of today's slicker (but sometimes superficial)  approaches. That was an era of humane & distinctly humanistic drama, unafraid of venturing into allegory, theater, magic realism, even the absurd, in order to deliver a rich emotional impact. There's a maturity to these stories that's often missing today -- they're stories by adults, for adults, about adults. They not only grip the viewer, they evoke empathy, understanding, and leave the viewer with further food for thought. You can't ask more of any story, it seems to me.

In short, this is a series fully deserving of rediscovery for any thoughtful viewer -- most highly recommended!",1469059200,15,1493,5.012096774193548
8762644,5,B01G9CFX1I,"I can't offer an opinion on the series as I bought it for one episode, ""Try to Keep Alive Until Next Tuesday,"" which I just watched.  The quality of the video is great; it reminded me of how good the ""Dr. Kildare"" series looked.  I was thinking that the episode would be tough to watch, that it would show its age.  And, perhaps there was a little of that in the way a couple of the actors were directed.  But, that said, I was surprised at how thoughtful the show was presented and was surprised that there were several lines that made me smile.  I intend t watch more shows from this set.",1468540800,4,590,4.185840707964601
8762645,4,B01G9CFX1I,I was 8 when this show debuted in 1962...and i don't even recall the show in first run or syndication. Very watchable and not too dated...great transfers from studio masters...this is a rare gem that should be seen...rivaling Dr. Kildare and Ben Casey!,1468022400,4,252,4.883720930232558
8762646,4,B01G9CFX1I,"The Eleventh Hour was a psychiatric spin-off from Dr. Kildare.  The pilot was an episode of Dr. Kildare.  I remember watching it as a kid, but had no specific memories of the show itself.  Wendell Corey starred as Psychiatrist Theodore Bassett and Jack Ging (later the angry Lt. Quinlan of Riptide) played Psychologist Paul Graham.  Corey left after season one and was replaced by Ralph Bellamy for the series second and final season.  The series lasted two years to Dr. Kildare's five.  I've watched the first three episodes so far.  The first episode with Vera Miles is basically the pilot minus Kildare and Dr. Gillespie.  The second episode is a rather dour affair guest starring Steven Hill (later ""Dan Briggs"" of the first season of Mission: Impossible.)  The third episode is just okay and guest stars Barbara Rush and utterly wastes the talents of my favorite tv actor, the late, great David Janssen. (The Fugitive was a year away.)  I'm hoping the scripts improve as I go on.
Interestingly, Kildare's main competition as tv's favorite doctor at the time, Ben Casey, also had a Psychiatric spin-off entitled ""Breaking Point.""  Unlike Eleventh Hour, it only lasted one year.  As far as I know, it, (like Ben Casey,) is not available on DVD.",1467849600,4,1247,4.85781990521327
8762647,5,B01G9CFX1I,"When I was composing my reference series collectively titled ""Television Drama Series Programming: A Comprehensive Chronicle"" (Metuchen, N.J. and London: The Scarecrow Press, 1978-1986) which in eight volumes covered the entire American dramatic television medium from 1947 through 1986, I cited this series as being a near-masterpiece, one of the few focusing on psychologists (Jack Ging as Dr. Paul Graham), psychiatrists (Wendell Corey as Dr. Theodore Bassett; subsequently Ralph Bellamy as Dr. L. Richard Starke), and their patents.  The teleplays stunningly explored such themes as post-natal depression in Alfred Brenner's ""The Blues My Baby Gave to Me,"" war desertion in Theodore Apstein's ""There Are Dragons in This Forest,"" and child pregnancy in Apstein's ""Of Roses and Nightingales and Other Lovely Things.""  In its two seasons on NBC television from October 3, 1962 through April 22, 1964 (thirty-two episodes in the first season and thirty episodes in the second), producer Sam Rolfe's and associate producer Irving Ellman's (who jointly composed the highly evocative theme score, with series musical director Harry Sukman, originally based upon ""Eleventh Hour Melody"" as adapted by Winifred Palmer and Carl Sigman) enterprise was never less than highly literate, with nuanced episode titles coming from all manner of literary sources, and with a dynamic black-and-white chiaroscuro camera following a galaxy of Hollywood's finest actors at the peak of their form.  Long sequestered--even absent syndication--for more than fifty years, its emergence in this apparent four-part set, the episodes restored from studio masters, is nothing less than a revelation.  Most highly recommended.",1465689600,16,1698,5.726190476190476
