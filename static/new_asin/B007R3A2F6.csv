8521146,5,B007R3A2F6,"I spend a bit of time in Hong Kong and saw this movie pop up in a search I was doing when looking for things to do on a recent trip. So downloaded it for viewing and liked it.  Good story, good music, and great filming. I liked how it was filmed during the handover back to China since I never got to experience Hong Kong before the handover.",1383264000,,342,3.9565217391304346
8521147,4,B007R3A2F6,"Wan Chai Baby, a drama with documentary features, focuses on the vexed issue of domestic workers from abroad, coming to Hong Kong to work as cheap labors. Craig Addison - producer, director and writer of this work - casted Chanel Latorre in the lead-role of the 24-year-old Tess from the Philippines who comes to Hong Kong in 1996 to work as a maid for Jenny starring Ines Laimins. Jenny, an American woman married to a most-of-the-time absent Chinese businessman, sees in Tess not only a help but also a friend substitute. Due to the absence of her husband, she feels lonely and neglected and drowns those feelings with drugs and sex with other men. One night, she takes Tess with her to the amusement district of Hong Kong, Wan Chai. In a nightclub, Jenny finds a man to satisfy her sexual needs and Tess meets Danny, played by Aaron Palermo, who gives her his number, urging her to call him some time.
Some days after their night trip, Jenny dies unexpectedly from an overdose. After Jenny's death, Tess finds a new job in the household of an unfriendly and over demanding woman where she feels troubled and unhappy. In her sadness, she calls Danny and they meet. Tess enjoys Danny's attention, takes pleasure in his charming behavior. The promising romantic date with him takes away her sorrows and worries and makes her more self-confident and hopeful. She even quits her job after that emotional height but her happiness does not last very long. Danny turns out to be a Wan Chai Warrior, who uses women and plays with them as it pleases him. Lost and disappointed, she has to find alternatives to earn money, especially because the job agency denies her a new job and charges her with a fine for quitting the last. The new circumstances force Tess to change directions. Disillusioned, Tess enters the red light milieu in Wan Chai working as a masseuse under the nickname Baby, which gives one explanation for the title of the film. Surely, it is also a very common form of address for persons in a romantic relationship but for the title, baby could equally symbolize Tess' condition after arriving in Hong Kong: a person freshly thrown into a new world previously strange to him/her - just like a newborn child - inexperienced and innocent.

Owing to the cleverly applied mixture between documentary and drama, Wan Chai Baby comes out as a sensible and convincing portrayal about the life of domestic workers in Hong Kong. The film reveals how society and government deal with and treat numerous women coming from the Philippines (and other countries) to earn money for sending it directly back home to their families. Being on their own, the women quite frequently suffer from shameful working and appalling living conditions, rude employers and are paid outrageously low - exploitation at its best. The film offers a varied insight of exactly those troublesome circumstances of domestic helpers and allows the spectator to establish a sound idea of the situations. Interestingly, the story was set around the handover of Hong Kong in 1997, which was a landmark event in history but was not discussed extensively in the film.

The music provided as background to the story is unexpectedly cheerful. On the one hand the spectator might find that confusing and inappropriate due to the serious content but on the other hand that could also be considered ironically indicating the contrasts between the well-off employers, living their successful and happy lives, which are silently but eminently supported by amahs (house maids).

Besides using those musical arrangements to convey messages and moods of states, Craig Addison succeeds in creating a remarkable atmosphere in his film by implementing some longer sequences without any talking but close-ups of the character. In those scenes the audience is forced to deal with the uneasy situations of the protagonist and in some way experience them itself: the feeling of being lost, of not knowing what to do and where to go - complete helplessness. Chanel Latorre convincingly portrayed those emotional ups and downs of Tess facial movements and in her gestures. Therefore, the bridge to sympathy for the young woman can be established easily.

Although the surprising rapid change of Tess in the second half of the film from the shy, insecure and little-English-speaking girl to a confident, daring and almost fluent-English-speaking woman seems to be a little too abrupt and unlikely, the film remains to be an excellent representation of the struggles and problems of domestic workers in Hong Kong and the actual political situation of the society and government.",1344038400,,4623,4.976714100905562
8521148,4,B007R3A2F6,"The story depicted in Wan Chai Baby is believable. I could relate to the sad plight of Tess and what some Philippine women go through to send money home. Chanel Latorre as Tess was sensational not only in looks but very convincing in the role of a downtrodden Filipina housemaid.  The actress playing Jenny (Tess' employer) was OK considering what her part was but not nearly as convincing as Tess. Craig Addison's men were less accomplished save for Prince Charles and his ""cameo"" appearance during the televised coverage of the 1997 handover of Hong Kong to China. Danny, Tess' boyfriend, grew on me as the movie went on. While I didn't find much chemistry between Tess and Danny initially, this seemed to change as love between them seemed to start to bloom.

The film looks beautiful and captures the color and verve of Hong Kong very nicely. The photography was flawless. Impressive in every way. The depth of field is tremendous and very effective considering all the close-ups of Tess and other actors. The editing, along with the skilled photography contributed to a great flow and look of the picture. Song selection was perfect and went with the action.  Whoever selected knew what they were doing. The music was appropriate in every instance, especially the music used in the tennis match scene between Tess and Jenny. Alexia's ""Me and You"" song was great for the scene at the bar/disco.  Wan Chai Baby is an accurage view of the plight of women in places like The Philippines and the fact they do whatever it takes to support themselves and their families.",1343260800,2,1568,4.796296296296297
8521149,4,B007R3A2F6,"Tess (Chanel Latorre) is a young girl from the Philippines, who comes to Hong Kong in search of work as a so-called amah (maid). She leaves her family and her little son back in the Philippines. Tess did not come to Hong Kong voluntarily but her poverty forces her to do so. At first, Tess works for Jenny (Ines Laimins), a western woman whose husband often leaves for business in mainland China. Jenny eventually introduces Tess to Hong Kong's glittering nightlife - they spend one night in Wan Chai. Jenny, however, dies tragically not at least due to the consumption of alcohol and drugs. Tess starts again to look for employment on Hong Kong's domestic helpers market. Finally, she is engaged by a Chinese family. Her Chinese boss mistreats Tess. Consequently, Tess terminates her contract. Terminating a contract in Hong Kong implies a monetary penalty to be paid to the Employment Agency for Maids. Tess starts cleaning public toilets and works full time in order to guarantee financial support to her family in the Philippines and to repay her debt. Soon after, Tess realizes that there are other ways to earn good and fast money: she offers massages to western expats. The shy and restrained Tess becomes a Wan Chai Baby...

The story of Wan Chai Baby is based on true events. Craig Addison not only shows the exhausting working life of the Filipinas but also the typical gatherings of Filipinas on their day off and some of the characteristics of Hong Kong's red light milieu. Thus, he touches upon many aspects of the life of female domestic helpers, albeit in a very subtle way. Many close-up views, few conversations and the background music reflecting the moods of the film make this an authentic low-budget movie.",1340668800,3,1727,4.83445945945946
