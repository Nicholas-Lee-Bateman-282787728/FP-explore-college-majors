The ANA Island Roads of B.C is an amazing, yet very though ride from Salt Spring Island to Victoria. It is a almost two hour ride that will literally take your breath away both because the scenery is amazing and because it is a hard ride. I had to change the resistance all the time but I know it is necessary to do so to get the best possible result.

I love doing this ride because I ""feel"" that I am at the scene. There is so much to see along the way and listening to Paul, telling me to give it my all the entire time makes the time go by very fast. It is nice to take along on the ferry, and I love that I am shown glimpses of the scenery along the way.

Paul is a great narrator. I learn a lot listening to him and he tells me everything I need to know to get a great workout. There is a infopanel on the screen along with a map, so I can both see where I am and how I am (or should be) doing :)
I do also enjoy listening to the music in the background, it fits perfectly.

I know that I soon will be doing this ride again, I totally love it. You should so try it out!",1507420800,,1268,3.7735849056603774
8755939,5,B01DH52TV2,"This video takes us to Salt Springs Island just off Vancouver Island, in British Columbia.  It is a very difficult 2 hour ride to Victoria.  Very difficult.  I have to admit, I couldn't make it in one sitting.  I will have to work up to it.

This would be a good introduction to the Cycling Videos Online series (if you're looking for some pain).  Paul Gallas spends the first few minutes helping us calibrate our bikes.  In the process I learned a lot about my trainer and how to tweak the resistance.

As for the ride, the audio and video are top notch.  The download comes with different audio options in case you would rather listen to your own music.  The video starts with a satellite overview of the course, which keeps going and going and going.  During the ride Paul tells us about the beautiful island and the local culture, which keeps our minds off our legs.

As always, the dashboard provides all the necessary metrics for people to duplicate the workout, whether people are riding their road bike on a trainer, or on a spin bike.

Im going to try it again in upcoming weeks and see if I can do it all at once, keeping up with Pauls level of exertion.  My heart rate was often over 90% of max.

I have several CVO videos, and this may the toughest.  That includes some long distance century rides.  I love this one, and highly recommend it.",1506816000,,1353,4.391129032258065
8755940,5,B01DH52TV2,"At one point in this video, Paul (the videos creator) says ""Okay, get ready, the hump-buster is about to begin.""  That pretty much sums up this entire video -- its a full-on workout that will have you sweating hard and hanging out for the end.

The video starts with a slightly corny opening sequence, followed by a very helpful calibration section where Paul guides you through a series of increasing efforts to get you warmed up and to get your heart rate matching the one shown on the video.  Paul also gives some good tips on how to match your heart rate if you don't have an adjustable trainer.

As soon as the calibration section is finished, the ride goes straight into a big icky hill climb  and its a toughie.  At the top I was absolutely dripping, and grimaced as Paul helpful said that was the start.  It gets harder.

After the hill climb, Paul describes the dashboard and guides you through the high cadence efforts as we pass several carrots (other cyclists).  There no particular topic discussed on this video, though there are plenty of tips and Paul gives a very interesting commentary on the areas we are riding through.  It is a scenic ride through two islands in British Columbia, with a ferry ride in the middle, though you're working so hard you barely notice the scenery rushing past.

Paul is constantly pushing you to a high heart-rate effort, and there is an awful lot of red on the heart rate chart.  One thing that worried me was the solid swathe of red at the very end: a full-on sprint for the last few minutes of the ride.  I was dreading this, though it was over quickly and was very doable.  I did have to cool down for a few minutes after the video finished, though.

At one point when I rode this video, I had a disaster: I dropped my towel, and it was lying on the ground beneath my bike, just out of reach.  I didn't want to stop the video, so all I could do was drip on it.  The workout is intense and amazing.

I have only two very minor criticisms of this video.  During the ferry ride (most of which is edited out), there is no instruction on what you should be doing -- should we stop and rest, soft pedal, or keep going hard?  It only lasted for a minute or so, so I decided to soft pedal, but I would have appreciated a word on what to do.  Instead, the narration just stops, and starts again on the other side.

My second criticism is of the elevation profile shown on the dashboard.  The elevation profile depicted what looked like a dead flat ride with suspiciously symmetrical humps.  I double-checked the course in Google Maps, and the elevation profile seems to have been flattened so that it no longer matches the course.  The ride is relatively flat (only a couple of hundred metres of climbing in total), but the elevation profile just didn't look right to me.

Of course, that didn't stop me enjoying the video.  Its an excellent workout, with quick gear changes and sustained efforts to keep you on your toes.  The aim of the workout is to maximise your power output, keeping your heart rate just below maximum.  I found it an excellent tool for teaching my legs to spin faster, as Paul regularly reminds us to get that leg speed up.

If you want to learn how to ride harder and faster, this is the perfect video for you.  While its not really for beginners, I highly recommend this video for more experienced riders.",1506729600,,3372,4.416531604538087

For roughly two hours, you travel through some beautiful islands near Vancouver Island, wending your way through the tree-lined green landscapes that so typify the Pacific Northwest.  You even make it onto a ferry, that ubiquitous means of travel among such islands.

The intro contains a nice aerial view of the ride, giving you a good sense of expectation and of being there, as you sit indoors either on your trainer or spin bike.  The dashboard contains the metrics for the workout, and Paul explains them carefully and helps you calibrate your equipment to best simulate the actual ride.  Then you ride, preferably using a heart rate monitor to mimic the effort of the actual ride.

The scenery is always lovely, very much worth taking in as you do the ride.  The focus is a little soft, but this is only 720 and it gets the job done.  Some may find the dashboard somewhat intrusive, but that could be a matter of taste, as whereas I do the rides to immerse myself in the on-road experience, others may prefer to follow the metrics closely for the best workout.

In any event, this workout removes you from your indoor cave, transporting you to a great spot in the Pacific Northwest.  The workout is the ride and its well worth repeating.  Try it!",1504569600,,1669,5.799180327868853
