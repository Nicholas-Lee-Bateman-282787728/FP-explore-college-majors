5909137,2,B00EE8AIP6,"I didn't finish watching the whole movie because I fell asleep, it was really boring. It was just different people giving their opinions on shakespeare; the fact that there is no solid proof on the writer of Shakespeare and their is very little record on who the man was, people were basiclly just assuming and giving their opinions. It just was not what I thought it would be.",1352937600,5,377,4.5588235294117645
5909138,5,B00EE8AIP6,"""Last Will and Testament"" was a well done documentary dealing with the Shakespeare authorship controversy.  This documentary proposes Edward De Vere as the man behind the myth.  The film was interesting and entertaining.  It had a great cast balancing both Shakespearean actors and ""experts"" in the field.

De Vere definitely could be the one, but others have made a pretty good case for Henry Neville.  His life fits nicely with the ""facts"" of the case as well.  Not sure who Shakespeare really was, but one thing I do feel confident about--it wasn't the guy from Stratford-upon-Avon.

If you are fond of good mysteries and enjoy Shakespeare's works, this is a must see for you.",1352592000,7,679,4.9035087719298245
5909139,5,B00EE8AIP6,"This documentary is a ""must-see"" for anyone who claims to be interested in Shakespeare. As many other reviews have said, it is both provocative and fair. Orthodox authorities are given the opportunity to make their case at some length. As so often seems to happen in such cases, their arguments are very far from being conclusive and fail to address critical questions that the ""heretics"" can answer.

As Dr. Waugaman says, ""Everyone who cares about Shakespeare has to see this film. Even if their mind is already made up, they will realize there's more reason for doubt about this issue than they had realized. Those who have an open mind on the issue will find it positively spell-binding.""

Full disclosure: I am among those interviewed in the documentary, so please don't keep posting criticisms that I have not been explicit about this ""conflict of interest.""  And no, I have no financial interest in the project.",1352160000,19,918,4.909677419354839
5909140,5,B00EE8AIP6,"The question of who actually wrote the works traditionally attributed to ""William Shakespeare"" has been hotly debated for over 150 years.

This film attempts to offer an introduction to this debate in under 90 minutes....no mean feat in-and-of itself, as the topic has inspired 4,000 books, thousands of scholarly research papers, a half-dozen or so television shows, a Hollywood feature film and even two separate Supreme Court trials !!

Last Will & Testament combines A-list Hollywood talent, A-list scholarship and Academy Award worthy production values with a compelling and fast-paced storyline. It explores both the case for the traditional candidate: The Stratford-Upon-Avon grain merchant and theater investor with a similar sounding name, Will Shakspere...and also the case for today's leading alternative candidate: Edward de Vere...17th Earl of Oxford and Lord Great Chamberlain of England...a man at the center of court politics and court intrigues throughout the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, but who also established a reputation as England's premier courtier poet.

The works of Shakespeare are often considered to be mankind's single greatest literary achievement. Was the story behind their creation the rags-to-riches tale of an uneducated but financially savvy Stratford businessman...or is it a slightly darker tale...that of a troubled, dclass aristocrat who began his public career as one of the wealthiest and most brilliant noblemen in England, but who died in obscurity, disgrace and near bankruptcy thanks to his life-long obsession with poetry, playwriting and the theater ??

My advice: Watch this film and then decide for yourself...",1351814400,19,1661,5.605577689243028
5909141,5,B00EE8AIP6,"For the many people who loved Roland Emmerich's 2011 film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anonymous/dp/B0076D21O2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anonymous</a>&nbsp;and who hunger to know more of its back-story, along comes this splendid documentary. It takes us behind the scenes of the earlier film, and introduces us to many of the scholars whose work informed the making of Anonymous. It complements Anonymous in countless ways, providing some of the evidence that Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford, wrote the works of Shakespeare. Brief scenes from the earlier film are repeated during some of the narration.

Vanessa Redgrave and Mark Rylance both appeared in the earlier film, and they make encores here. They step out of their characters' roles, to voice their own opinions on the authorship question. Derek Jacobi, our guide in Anonymous, elaborates on the reasons for his authorship belief here. Among the prominent Oxfordian scholars who appear are Charlton Ogburn, whom many credit with reviving interest in de Vere. There are many trenchant comments from Professor Roger Stritmatter, who made history by earning the first Ph. D. in literature in the United States for an Oxfordian dissertation. He puts things simply but persuasively. For example, Stritmatter points out that there is ""no real, believable connection"" between the works of Shakespeare and the life of the Stratford man.

As William Leahy says, those in academics have shown little interest in the authorship question. So we can't really expect them to be adequately informed about it. Diana Price speaks of her research that shows there is no definite documentary evidence from his lifetime that anyone thought Shaksper of Stratford was a writer. She debunks the Stratfordian claim that it's simply a matter of poor records from that era, as she finds more archival evidence for several lesser known authors from that period.

Everyone who cares about Shakespeare has to see this film. Even if their mind is already made up, they will realize there's more reason for doubt about this issue than they had realized. Those who have an open mind on the issue will find it positively spell-binding. Laura and Lisa Wilson, their staff, and the many people they interviewed deserve our deepest thanks.

[added 1/12/14]--I just shared the film with a group of friends last night. Even the die-hard Stratfordians were impressed. Others were utterly persuaded. Everyone commended the film as being of the highest quality. Once again, I am struck by how well the Wilsons have accomplished their goal with this documentary. Although good books on this topic have been available for years, there are lots of people who will watch this film before they'll read any of those books. Further, the psychological grip of the traditional authorship story is due in part to its being such a compelling narrative of a common man who made good. Who became the greatest author in English literature. The Wilsons succeed so well because they offer us an even more compelling narrative, of a genius who never received credit for most of his literary work. Lord Burghley and his son Robert Cecil may have started the cover-up, but loyal acolytes of the Stratford man, such as Stanley Wells and Jonathan Bate are working frenetically to plug the rapidly proliferating holes in its dike.",1351814400,16,3372,5.297196261682243

5909146,2,B00EE8AIP6,"Alas, this is mostly a one sided account and yet another attempt by Roland Emmerich, this time as the producer, to champion Edward De Vere, Earl of Oxford, as the legitimate author of Shakespeare's work. It reminds me of the popular musings and theories about the Mona Lisa. Displacing Shakespeare somehow still generates lots of passion in some folks. Some people believe the various theories and what evidence is presented as legitimate. That is fine with me. It is all in the realm of opinion and belief. But for me, it is getting a bit long in the tooth for a pop culture mystery. I do not find Oxfordians or for that matter, any of the other camps, remotely convincing but you are free to do so. I suppose if more people end up reading and watching more Shakespeare because of this publicity for his work, then real benefits to our culture could result.

If this is your first experience of these hyped speculations and you enjoy conspiracy theory ""documentaries"" then it can be entertaining as part of that genre. The film also has good production values and boasts some celebrities.",1521072000,2,1089,4.701570680628272

5909149,1,B00EE8AIP6,"This may possibly be the most incompetent research about Shakespeare and his plays ever created- it has all of the earmarks of a
Hollywood potboiler in which an enormous effort is made to solve a mystery that never was.  It depends almost 100% upon an audience
more or less  totally ignorant of the Elizabethan age and playwriting in that period. In other words, people who are easy prey for flat out lies and arguments that are, in fact, totally implausible. That is, when not outright fictions.  Their favorite candidate, Edward deVeres, the Earl of Oxford, may just be the most unlikely alternative Shakespeare, EVAH!!!  The fact that the good earl was in his coffin a full ten years before the ending of Shakespeare's writings might make most people tend to dismiss a corpse as a good candidate. But Noooooo....problem!  Just make up a bunch of idiotic nonsense  about the dates of the plays and there you are. Then there's the small problem that Shakespeare later in his career collaborated with people like Fletcher, a man who didn't even begin writing plays until 2 years after the Earl's death. Also we know that Hand D of Sir Thomas Moore was in Shakespeare's handwriting, on the basis of similarities to his known signatures, which have 4 very distinctive characteristics and the vocabulary in the text, which has very strong relationships to that in Shakespeare's plays and is also very distinctive in the use of such unusual words as the dialectical a for he. It has no conceivable connection to anything de Veres ever wrote or his handwriting.  I order to create a mystery about Shakespearean authorship, where, quite frankly , none exist, one must tell tale tales - like the one about the illiterate father and daughters, the first not for certain, but regardless, irrelevant, unless one believes in hereditery illiteracy, and the daughters of the Elizabethan age seldom were literate, especially when not living in a large city.  And the  Stratford Grammer school that Shakespeare attended, as the son of the town's sometime mayor, was hardly a backwater Green Acres institution. It was,in fact, headed by a respected educator and students received a healthy educational training. The supposed unlikelihhod of Shakespeare having knowledge that seemed more in tune with college graduates was in fact wrong on two counts. First, Shakespeare learned Latin at Stratford Grammer, but he was not an expert - Ben Johnson pointed that out. And the supposed mystery of how Shakespeare could know about Italy, while the Earl of Oxford spent a lot of time there, having been booted out of Elizabeth's court, would have such knowledge, avoids the inconvenient fact that Shakespeare's plays mislocated Italian cities with respect to the Mediterranium Sea. And when Oxfordians start talking about different spelling in Shakespeare's name, they count on the modern reader assuming (quite falsely) that Elizabethans were religiously carefull about how their name was spelled. Nothing could be further from the truth -legal documents in which the party's name is spelled not two, not three, but four different ways were not uncommon. And how many ways did Christopher Marlow spell his last name?  More than half a dozen different ways is the answer.
There is more evidence for Shakespeare the author being one and the same as Shakespeare the actor, than exists for almost all of the notable playwrights of his era.  The claim that a mystery exists is based on easily shredded arguments - if you really want to see what careful and exhaustive historical research into the issue of Shakespearean authorship looks like, get a book that isn't written for third graders like this film - Irvin  Matus ""Shakespeare, In Fact""  - 300 pages of densely packed information  that wil convince anyone that William Shakespeare the playwright was, guess who? William Shakespeare,  a member of the Lord Chamberlain players.  I warn you not to attempt to argue the issue  against anyone who is familiar with Matus' work - you will be very embarrassed by your ignorance",1508630400,8,4048,5.026905829596412

5909153,3,B00EE8AIP6,"I purchased this DVD but was dissappointed to learn the candidate presented was Edward De Vere. I believe it was Sir Henry Neville who wrote the works we attribute to W.

I also recommend the 3 books by Brenda James who discovered Neville and the other books on this topic by Rubinstein and Crosson ... all fascinating and very persuasive. It puzzles me why serious academics seem to be ignoring Neville's candidacy. Perhaps it is because they do not have enough evidence about their candidate to counter the rapidly increasing evidence in favor of Neville. All who are intrigued by the Shakespeare authorship question should read these books about Sir Henry Neville, then they too will finally know the answer to this fascinating historical puzzle.",1462838400,3,924,4.967741935483871

The work will keep pulling in new readers which will add more fuel to this debate. Shakespeare has achieved what no other  author, play write or poet ever will  to this date, we are still talking about him and he is still in print! The work has remained relevant hundreds of years after he died! Wow!  If you really think about the work being written for us, than it will be all us who decided who and what the real Shakespeare is and what the true depth of his work means to each of us. Not Academia! The documentary did make a very fascinating point, Shakespeare has taken on a religious aspect, we don't know who really wrote the work yet we accept the truth we find in it? We don't know who he is, not one you of can say I know beyond a shadow of doubt who the real Shakespeare is, because like me everything you know you learned from reading what someone wrote or something you watched .

5909174,1,B00EE8AIP6,"Please folks, don't support the creators of this ""documentary"", which I gave one star only because Amazon doesn't allow zero. A responsible person might choose to make a film advancing the theory that the Earl of Oxford wrote the plays of Shakespeare -- but he or she wouldn't simply ignore the obvious counterarguments. Why? Because then you are simply undertaking to fool your audience. But that is exactly what this film does. For example, its creators made the deliberate decision never to mention that the Earl of Oxford died in 1604 -- a significant challenge to their theory given that scholars have dated many of the plays, based on compelling evidence, to later years. They should have mentioned this and grappled with it. Another example: an ""expert"" informs us that the historical Shakespeare filed petty lawsuits and therefore could not have been the author of the ""magnanimous"" plays -- but the film fails to inform us that the Earl of Oxford was by many accounts not just arrogant and abusive, but a murderer. The film implies that Shakespeare had no education -- but fails to inform us that he was the son of a man who was essentially his hometown's mayor, and that the public school in that town, like other schools of that time and place, was apparently quite rigorous. It would also have been nice to know that the ""expert"" at center stage in the film (William Beauclerk) is a self-proclaimed descendant of the Earl of Oxford, who seems to have devoted his career to monomaniacally making his ancestor's case. No mention of this in the film, which presents the fellow as an impartial scholar. The thing does give a bit of airtime to a passionate advocate of the pro-Shakespeare position, Jonathan Bate of Oxford University, but they let him talk about three times, and on one of those occasions they place and clip his quote in such a way as to suggest he is an anti-Shakespearean. All in all, I am not making the ""who was Shakespeare"" case one way or the other -- but I am making the case that a documentary on the topic, whatever its angle, ought to be honest. This one is highly dishonest.
*  Recommendation:  For a good summary of the evidence in favor of the historical Shakespeare as the author, read the last chapter of Bill Bryson's Shakespeare:  The World As Stage.  And then, if you're interested, read the whole book, which walks through Shakespeare's life, citing one bit of evidence after another for his authorship of the plays, virtually all of which is ignored in this weird documentary -- and some of which is denied outright.  (E.g., one ""expert"" claims that there are no contemporaneous documents referring to Shakespeare as a writer.  Totally wrong:  there are many, including the diary of a contemporary mocking Shakespeare as an upstart playwright, and a play put on at Oxford referring to Shakespeare's lovely verse.)

It would seem we simply do not know enough to determine who the individual or individuals were.
As an atheist this is the way I think about the religious beliefs practiced throughout the world.  They can not all be right, but they can all be wrong.  This seems to be true of the beliefs regarding Shakespere or those whom it is believed did the writings currently attributed to him.

5909188,5,B00EE8AIP6,"There are at least two major camps on opposing sides of the question of 'who authored the written works attributed to William Shakespeare'? One is the Stratford of Avon viewpoint that the author is the under-educated, grain merchant of Avon, William Shakespeare, who could barely write his own name and never traveled anywhere away from his country. The other is the Oxfordian viewpoint which has seriously challenged that William Shakespeare of Avon ever authored any of the writings attributed to him since at least as early as the 17th century.

This documentary presents those opposing viewpoints ever so well. No matter what one believes, it is very interesting to watch and listen to experts making their cases for each viewpoint.

The 2011 feature film, ""Anonymous,"" presents a very tight case depiction of how and why the Oxfordian viewpoint is a whole lot more than plausible. ""Anonymous"" reveals how and why it is probable that William Shakespeare of Avon did NOT author the writings attributed to him.

Thus, ""Last Will. and Testament"" is a marvelous companion documentary to ""Anonymous."" I would urge viewers to watch them both with an opened mind.",1401494400,5,1160,5.094736842105263

5909190,4,B00EE8AIP6,"This entertaining, sometimes absorbing documentary is based largely on Charles Beauclerks book, Shakespeare's Lost Kingdom: The True History of Shakespeare and Elizabeth. The various arguments that favor the Earl of Oxfords authorship of the Shakespeare canon, continuously return to a comparison of DeVeres university education to Shakespeares lack thereof. This is followed by the assumption that a university education is required to become a great writeror at least to become William Shakespeare.

Contrariwise, Stephen Greenblats book, Will in the World, makes a convincing (and fascinating) case for the known childhood influences in Stratford that flourish in Shakespeares plays. The most compelling argument to me (because it is borne out in my experience) suggests that someone who is driven to such prolific creativity is often the product of an impoverished childhood. This kind of obsessive creative ambition is seldom found in the offspring of the landed gentry. Examples abound.

Abraham Lincoln went to school when he was 6, 7, 11, 13, and 15 years old. All the time he went to school did not add up to a year.  Abe received most of his education from the books he read. He loved to read every minute of his spare time. When he went out to plow a field, he put a book under his shirt and read at the end of rows when the horses were resting. His best friend, Dennis Hanks, said, I never saw Abe after he was 12, that he didn't have a book in his hand or in his pocket.  (Brian Burns)

Samuel Clemens took his early schooling from his mother. Later, he dropped out of school at the age of twelve to become a printers apprentice. Clemens unorthodox and ground-breaking use of language, irony and pathos were self-taught.

Like many intellectually gifted students, Lincoln and Clemens were apparently bored by schooling that failed to challenge them. So they freely challenged themselves. Lincoln became his own law professor. Clemens literally handled words all day, setting type for his brothers newspaper. And that sums up all their formal schooling. Yet between them, they are the two greatest American writers. Is there any speech more elegant in language and ethos than the Gettysburg Address, or more evocative than Huckleberry Finns decision, All right then, Ill go to Hell.

Frankly, arguments on both sides of the AQ (authorship question) are compelling. Yet the advocates on both sides tend to be as zealous as those who debate abortion. They consistently fail to mention any inconvenient facts (e.g., Edward DeVere died in 1604, which predates some of Shakespeares plays). As a fascinated observer with no particular rooting interest, I read and enjoy all these books and films.

When Derek Jacobi, Mark Rylance, and Vanessa Redgrave -- all of whom live and breathe the last vestiges of the man, his plays, with unprecedented frequency and insight -- speak, you listen.

The dramatizations are excellent, the scope of the Oxfordian theory is demonstrated with quote after quote from 19th and 20th century luminaries, and the basic premises of both sides of the debate are well outlined. Some of the more radical theories -- that De Vere was both Elizabeth's offspring and the father of her child -- are touched upon, but only enough so that we see people within the Oxfordian camp disagreeing with each other, giving us a greater confidence in the myriad pieces of the puzzle that upon which they align.

If you enjoy the film, first go back and re-read Hamlet, Lear, The Henriad (Henry IV pt. 1 and 2 and Henry V), and the Italian plays, with an active eye to the evidence portrayed in the film.

2.  Why You Shouldn't Believe that Ed De Veer wrote Shakespeare

1.  We have no plays or other writing of his that show he was capable of the brilliant, beautiful verse writings of Shakespeare.

2.  If we accept that he died in 1604, as most historians agree he did, it was eight years before the last play of Shakespeare, The Tempest, came out..  There is absolutely no proof that he wrote these plays before his death and passed them on to Shakespeare...There IS evidence that it would be extremely unlikely looking at how Shakespeare's versification changed within  his final years....

3. There is still inconsistent scenario of how de Veer passed the plays to Shakespeare, how much he paid him, how Shakespeare fooled his company for some 20 years, why no manuscripts were found at de Veer's residence, why HIS family did not know of this scheme and reveal it after his death, and why de Veer, a very egotiscal, self-important Aristocrat, would let a middle class writer put his name on the plays and get credit for writing them.  The pseudonym ""Shake-Spear"" theory is utterly ridiculous and does not stand up under strict scrutiny....De Veer could have published his plays anonymously and turned them into any acting troup.

4. The plays are not a biography of de Veer's life...There are many more inconsistencies than consistencies in the plays..if one  interprets plays using subjective means, every person can interpret tham differently.  In the Elibabethan age, few, if any, works of literature were autobiographical.

5. The life of Edward de Veer is the life of an Aristocrat, not the life of a playwright. Being 14 years older than Shakespeare, he did attend Oxford University, but we do not have his grades/transcripts from that school.  Going to a University does not make one a great writer.  Christopher Marlowe attended Cambridge, but the school did not make him a great writer.  Marlowe's father was a cobler in Canterbury, who might have been illiterate.  Like Shakespeare's father, he had a trade, but no college education.  They might have got along well.  Why did not Shakespeare attend nearby Oxford University?  I have no answer to that question.  It might have been money, but then why did not he apply for a scholarship?  I don't know.  But he married at the age of 18 and had a family, and that my have been a big factor.  Maybe he had a job.  He had to support  his family.  A schoolteacher, as one biographer suggested. In any case, we are lucky that he did not attend Oxford, and instead stayed in Stratford to raise a family.  The experience was worth 10 college educations for a writer.  ""You can take Shakespeare out of Stratford, but you can't take Stratford out of Shakespeare.""

6. The life of Edward de Veer is a life of an aristocrat, not a man of the theater.  ""The Theater"" the first commercial theater in London was opened in 1576 by James Burbage, but the birth of Renaissance in theatrical  terms was with Thomas Kyd's ""The Spanish Tragedy"" in about 1586.  de Veer was already 36 at this time.  Marlowe and Shakespeare were 22. Kyd himself was 28.  This was the birth of the theater in London, and de Veer's name is mentioned nowhere.

7. The chronology does not fit de Veer.  In 1571,  at 21, he married Ann Cecil.  In 1575, at 25, he traveled to France, Germany and Italy for about 16 months.  In 1580, at 30, he renounced Catholicism and accused a couple of Catholic friends of the Queen of treason.  In 1581, at 31, Ann V. gave birth to his bastard son, but he refused to marry her (wasn't he still married to Ann Cecil?)  de Veer was sent to the Tower for a brief vacation and lost favor at Court.

He is mentioned a first class Courtier poet, and Meres mentions him as the ""best on Comedy"", with Shakespeare the ""best in Comedy and Tragedy""  He is known to have a band of tumblers, and two theater troupes.  The Oxford's Men were used to provincial touring.  This is all true, and so why did de Veer have to put his name on the plays of Shakespeare?  He didn't.  He was known to be a playwright, and had troupes of his own actors.  In 1585, at the age of 35, he was broke so joined the army in Holland.  In 1586, Queen Elizabeth gave him an annual stipend.  All his life, de Veer seems to have been saved from Penury by women.",1388016000,16,4397,4.57051282051282

5909216,3,B00EE8AIP6,"This is a remake of the *The Shakespeare Mystery* first broadcast by Frontline in 1989, updated to include the Prince Tudor incest variations that--though they've been around since the 1930s--were too volatile for TV audiences 25 years ago. It's all here and then some--the hyphen as a pseudonym tip-off, Hamlet as autobiography, Shakespeare's lack of education, Polonius as Burghley, the Droeshout portrait as a mask, Oxford the wounded artist, blah blah blah, the usual Oxfordian shibboleths--and it even includes some footage from the original. It was pretty boring, to be honest, and I had to break it up and watch it in three segments, but a beginner might not find it so, and it's obvious that this is meant to be an introductory indoctrination for those who know little about the SAQ.

Of course the arguments are what they've always been--the historical distortions, the out-of-context quotations, the gerrymandered evidence, the claim that no evidence exists for Shakespeare as a writer, and the usual howlers that Oxfordians repeat no matter how many times they've been corrected (a few examples: Dickens, Emerson, Howard, and Wells were not Shakespeare doubters, and as far as I or anybody else knows Oxford wasn't a producer, director, or actor). So the core dishonesty which is the heart of Oxfordism is intact. It's hard to keep a straight face as the Oxfordian talking heads nod and wink to the audience and look off into the distance with a half-bemused smile. It's obvious that they truly think themselves to be the Promethean harbingers of the new breaking paradigm with the superior insight granted only to a few--though they believe that is a temporary situation soon to be corrected by more such ""educational"" efforts as this film. The most likeable speaker was also the nuttiest: Charles Beauclerk, whose most outrageous utterance (there were several) was ""Oxford himself was the instigator of the English Renaissance."" With their deep ignorance of history, it sounds exactly like something an Oxfordian would say.

BUT--the photography is scrumptious, the locales are lushly photographed, and the images of some historical icons are breathtakingly detailed. Shakespeare's monument has never been photographed better, and I finally got to see an original *Greenes Groatsworth of Wit* title page. I also felt a tiny bit of pride when I saw that the producers used a picture of J. Thomas Looney that I had sent to an Oxfordian, and they also probably used another scan I had uploaded to Wikipedia of Elizabeth opening Parliament.

Another thing: in the last third of the film the voice-over recites some verses from ""The Phoenix and the Turtle"", one of the best readings I've heard. If he had read the entire poem I would have given it another star. Even though the poem was meant to illustrate an Oxfordian belief, the reading was sensitive and moving. Yes, Oxfordians are nutty conspiracy theorists who really believe that Queen Elizabeth farmed out her secret bastard children to noble families of the realm who uncomplainingly accepted them as their heirs (think about that), but they can appreciate Shakespeare as well as anybody.

Every such film is touted as the ""ground-breaking film which will forever change the debate about Shakespeare,"" but of course it isn't and it never does, not will this one, no matter how many 5-star Amazon reviews it gets.

So bottom line, it's worthless as far as history goes (calling it a documentary does not make it one), but I think it's worth seeing just for the spectacle and the poem. I've wasted more time on worse books and movies.",1381622400,30,3599,5.042016806722689
5909217,1,B00EE8AIP6,"Early in the film, a group of scholars compares attributing the works of one man to another as a form of theft.  But the statement -- defending William Shakespeare's authorship of the works -- is sequenced with a series of attacks on Shakespeare.

This is a well-produced but flawed presentation of the Shakespeare authorship question.  I give it credit for including some discussion of the case for Shakespeare's authorship of the works -- but really, the torrent of misstatements and misconceptions combine to give a very distorted view of the question.  The most powerful evidence for Shakespeare's authorship is dismissed based on made-up technical/historiagraphic arguments about ""posthumous"" evidence.  Diana Price acknowledges that posthumous evidence has weight, but instantly dismisses the first folio's essentially incontrovertible evidence.

For instance:  The first folio was compiled and published less than a decade after William Shakespeare's death.  It was compiled by two actors (Hemminge and Condell) who were in the same playing company with Shakespeare that had the exclusive right to perform Shakespeare's plays.  The two actors received bequests from William Shakespeare of Stratford in one of the few extant documents he indisputably signed (his will) -- and they attribute the plays to Shakespeare of Stratford.

So two men who knew Shakespeare as a partner and actor in their acting company, who were so personally close to him that he provided a small bequest for them in his will, collected the definitive edition of the works and attributed them to him.  And on what basis is this evidence dismissed?  That Heminge and Condell didn't publish it until after Shakespeare had died.

Historians give great weight to records created contemporaneously with historical events.  Memories fade over time and facts get confused, while notes made at the time of the event do not.  But does that mean that all facts about an individual are suspect the moment after the person dies?

If Hemminge and Condell left a long list written from memory of who played which role in the plays, there would be reason to question its accuracy -- especially if there were evidence written at the time that clearly conflicted with it.  But here, all Hemminge and Condell's contribution to the first folio is meant to show is that William Shakespeare of Stratford was in fact the author of the plays and poems they attribute to him.  Can it be reasonably believed that these two men embarked on gathering these plays together for publication, but forgot that the actual writer was not their close friend, fellow actor, and partner?

The bottom line: The authorship controversy is like other conspiracy theories, requiring many people to have knowledge of the supposed secret, from the most powerful minister in the Queen's government to lowly players to unknown gangs that re-sculpted a dead grain merchant's monument years after his death to make him look like a writer.  Last Will. and Testement would benefit by having an entire comment track voiced by real Shakespeare biographers and Elizabethan historians giving a running refutation of the film's evidence.",1378684800,30,3163,5.225742574257426
5909218,5,B00EE8AIP6,"If you had a choice between watching the film Anonymous and this film I would choose this film, which both directed by Roland Emerich, but explain the  authorship issue in a different way. This documentary (which Anonymous is not) is a summarization of why so many scholars, intellectuals, writers and actors all believe that Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, is the man behind the pen-name or pseudonym William Shakespeare, and how ""poet"" Will Shakspere of Stratford upon Avon was a front-- a lie-- perpetuated for 400-odd years. Many of the current players in the Oxfordian camp are interviewed, such as Charles Beauclerk (who wrote his own excellent work Shakespeare's Lost Kingdom) and Hank Whittemore (whose magnum opus The Monument explains that the sonnets are all about Oxford, Elizabeth, Southampton and the Essex Rebellion). I am relatively new to the authorship issue but if you have any curiosity at all about it then I urge you to watch this film. Make your English or history teacher play it in class. Have some friends over and discuss it afterwards. I honestly do not think you could have an argument left that the ""man from Stratford"" is the author, nor would you have an argument not to believe Edward de Vere is, after watching this film. It is lucidly presented and carefully crafted so that your own thought process on the issue is played out as interviewees speak and information is presented. I cannot tell you the joy I feel when I read Shakespeare now. I used to be muddled and confused by what seemed to be vagueness or mystery but it is not a mystery now. It all makes sense, where before I loved the beauty of his poetry but did not understand the meaning. Be open to new ideas and interpretations and be surprised by the joy of discovery and knowledge and research! To our Ever-Living Poet!!!!",1377993600,14,1825,4.738993710691824

After reading Bruce Hutchison's great novel, Love Labor Lost, I realized there was something to belief that Edward Devere was the true writer of the plays and sonnets. This film confirms my belief. If the great actors who perform the plays think Shakespeare was a fraud, so do I !",1376006400,15,297,4.622641509433962
5909220,5,B00EE8AIP6,i loved this documentary. I agree the Shakespeare works deserve a creator with better education and experience than the Shakespeare we've been given through the years. I've left Stratford and become a believer of Oxford! :),1372723200,20,223,5.222222222222222
5909221,5,B00EE8AIP6,"Regarding 'Last Will. and Testament', my compliments to the directors/producers/cinematographers.

In addition to what others have said, I think it should get into print somewhere that this film has rare artistic power and integrity to go along with a compelling historical analysis on a critical cultural subject. The flow and tension of the viewing experience make it aesthetically enjoyable. The photography has an eerie quality of rich visual depth that invites the viewer back in time for a moment.

Would like to see the uncut version. There seems to be much more to tell, and I have the idea that the 'Shakespeare' mystery veils some dangerous historical events, relationships, and tragedies. Otherwise there would have been no reason for the Stratford bamboozle in the first place.",1366588800,43,789,5.253968253968254

5909223,5,B00EE8AIP6,"This is a well researched and organized documentary regarding who really wrote the Shakespeare works. The producers interview English professors, theater professionals and historians about what is known about William Shaksper of Stratford on Avon - and why his case for authorship is so weak. They also present a powerful circumstantial case for the 17th Earl of Oxford as the true author, based upon detailed parallels between his biography and the plots of the plays; other parallels in language and thought between his private letters and the metaphors and ideas displayed in the dramas and sonnets; and more. All in all, a sober-minded analysis of the authorship issue - and a compelling solution.",1363996800,55,701,5.212389380530974

5909226,3,B00EE8AIP6,"The ""Authorship Question"" is fascinating, encompassing elements of Elizabethan socio-political intrigue, overtones of the religious conflict of the times, and pure historical detective work. Unfortunately, ""Last Will. & Testament"", though earnest in its objectives, falls far short of treating the question with the depth and detail it requires. It rushes headlong to the Oxford argument, with little countervailing analysis, and assumes that the matter is settled. It isn't, and will not likely be, absent a smoking Shakespearean (or ""Shake-Spearean"") gun that is yet to be unearthed in a forgotten archive.

The multi-faceted tragic hero that was Edward deVere, whose identity as the bard is discussed almost as a fait-accompli in this film, is still painted in remarkably dimensionless style. The historical context is made to seem almost dull, when, in fact this period in English History is certainly one of the more colorful.

It's nice to have star appearances, such as that of Derek Jacobi, peppered throughout this documentary, but flash isn't necessarily a substitute for depth. This controversy, as complex as it is, deserves more profound treatment than this pop-historical effort displays. I was distracted by the insertion of scenes from the recent (inaccurate) film ""Anonymous"", which did little to inform, but much to dramatize.

I am personally fascinated by the Elizabethan and Jacobean theatre, by the development of Literature in this incredibly rich period, and particularly by the enigma presented as the Authorship Question. This film did a great deal to temper that fascination. By all means, watch it, but don't expect much in the way of new material.",1357257600,6,1676,5.413793103448276
5909227,5,B00EE8AIP6,"I wish it was longer! Still, interesting, visually entertaining, and intellectually stimulating. I plan on buying this film (just rented it, so far) and showing it to friends to explain why I find the Authorship Question so compelling.",1357171200,13,235,5.2105263157894735
5909228,4,B00EE8AIP6,"If you know little to nothing of the controversy of the authorship of the Shakespeare works, you have come to the right documentary.  Whether you accept or do not accept the Stratford fellow as the author, this is a very informative step by step approach as to WHY there is controversy in the first place.  The documentary is very sound and balanced and discusses the topic WITHOUT the usual millstone of emotion that normally revolves around the debate.  And there is a LOT of emotion around this debate.  If you have an open, scientific mind, this is a thoughtful film that deconstructs the question so that all, regardless of the level of knowledge about the history and people of the time, will come away with a good understanding of the debate.  There is much to know on this subject and this film only scratches the surface.",1356652800,33,830,4.657534246575342
5909229,4,B00EE8AIP6,"Very informative. I felt it showed issues on both sides. A little conspiracy theory with Queen Elizabeth and Shakespeare having a child. That is so far out I feel like it brought the show down. BUT overall, it was decent.",1354665600,8,221,4.55
5909230,5,B00EE8AIP6,"The quality of this video was outstanding in its filming, the flow of the story line with dramatic reconstructed scenes integrated with persons interviewed, the very convincing  visual recreation of London in Elizabethan times (how did they do Elizabeth's cortege in the snow?), tracing the historical family lines of the principals involved and thought provoking questions raised.  It is a complex subject that was well organized and therefore made easy to follow and understand.  A ""must see"" for anyone interested in theater and the question of Shakespeare's authorship. It inspires a search for more English history of that period. Well done and well worth the purchase!",1354320000,14,674,5.339622641509434
5909231,3,B00EE8AIP6,"The program starts off well enough, with the first half devoted to puncturing the orthodox position of authorship.  It admirably highlights the countless implausibilities that devastate the myth of a common tradesman from Stratford (who could barely write his own name) somehow managing to produce the transcendent literary output that is Shake-speare.  However, this section could've easily been shortened to leave more time for examining alternative arguments.

  But about 2/3s through, we realize why the producers didn't care about leaving time to analyze alternatives: they only have ONE they want us to hear.  Meaning they're just as narrow-minded as any Stratfordian canting the received belief that Mr. Shakspur was the only possible author.

  These producers advocate for Oxford.  Fine.  They're entitled to an opinion and it's a reasonable one.  But what's not fine is to provide only the pros of an argument and none of its cons - that's propaganda.  Not one word is given to any of the problems associated with Oxford as author.  Worse, zero attention is given to the other candidates or to the possibility that the poetry and the plays weren't all written by the same person.  But they do take time to give us lurid rumors about Oxford as both son and lover of Elizabeth (omg, smh - worthy of The History Channel).  This presentation is ultimately just another partisan espousal of belief, which unfortunately is the norm in Shakespeare studies.

  From my reading on the subject, I do view Oxford as a plausible author for the poetry.  But his 1604 death leaves too many improbabilities regarding the plays, their subsequent publications, and the continuation of the Shakspur-as-author pretense through & beyond the First Folio in 1623.  Of all the candidates for writing the plays, I find the least improbable is William Stanley, Earl of Derby: initials of W.S., called Will by family & friends, known as a writer among the court, and an influential supporter of public theater.  He had all the social, educational, and travel qualifications.  But because of an incredibly delicate political position throughout his long life (2nd in line to the throne before being supplanted by the Stuart accession and long suspected of Catholic sympathies) he would've had overwhelming, even head-preserving, reason to mask his authorship of these sometimes incendiary, often bawdy works.  And he was Oxford's son-in-law, so the two might have shared the Shake-speare pseudonym or the use of Shakspur as front man.  Derby lived until 1642, his home/castle was torched soon after by the Roundheads, and no will, papers, or personal effects survived - thus the absence of post-mortem evidence.  But on those flimsy grounds, I'd never bet serious money on Derby as the winner (pun originally not intended).  There are times when I think the most believable candidate would be a visiting alien. ;-)

  Last Will does serve some useful purpose in publicizing the authorship question, but it also fails badly with a biased & incomplete view.  Overall though, anything to spark debate on the Shakspur myth has to be considered a positive.",1353974400,6,3135,5.136363636363637
5909232,5,B00EE8AIP6,"I find it fascinating that we as a culture are divided into at least two camps (Probably more) -- Those who like a story the way it is, and those who want to know the story behind the story.  I think when you endeavor to understand the history and the context of a story, it adds a new dimension that makes it useful for understanding how things work, even in today's world, and also, perhaps, for how to live today so as to understand broad cultural memes that affect us.  Last Will & Testament asks the questions that revolve around those big questions of history and life, and that can be applied to other events of history, like the possible evolution and development of other icons, maybe even Jesus, or King Arthur.  I don't believe uncovering the truth about a person or about the events surrounding their lives is ever wrong, and that choosing to ignore the context and the background often can be.  I want to see and read more on this topic, and I do believe a great service has been done in this work.",1353715200,21,1011,4.390374331550802
5909233,5,B00EE8AIP6,"Last Will. & Testament artfully reflects the development of the challenge to the Shakespeare attribution in recent decades. The filmmakers have assembled an impressive series of commentaries on the central issues attendant to the mystery of Shakespeare's identity, and opened the question in a way that allows the viewer to consider the political, historical, literary, and artistic implications of the controversy. The spectacular scenes taken from Roland Emmerich's feature film, Anonymous, add historical spice to the documentary record, and the quality of the editing, music, and imagery surpasses previous all efforts to represent this most provocative question.",1353542400,10,667,5.88659793814433

This goes on to explain that noblemen of the day were not allowed to be writers and that there is evidence that some noblemen had a rube to front for their work.

8604628,1,B00EE8AIP6,"An occupational hazard of teaching Shakespeare for a living is that, from time to time, you face the question, ""What do you think about the authorship controversy?"" The person asking is always someone you've just met, someone who thinks the question is daring and smart and will shake the foundations of your world. In truth, I always feel like a paleontologist having to explain evolution to someone who thinks that God ""planted"" fossilized skeletons to test our faith. I do explain, and I try to be nice about it, but what I really want to discuss is why they care about the authorship of Shakespeare's plays at all. When I press, I discover that most of them have read little Shakespeare and less early modern history (excluding Fake-spear tracts) and THINK they're striking a blow against elitism by challenging the Mighty Bard who made them feel dumb in high school. The irony, of course, is that their anti-elitism functions by replacing the tradesman's son with members of the real elite, which is so like what happened in the last US election that it almost hurts. Oh yeah, the movie: more of the same drivel. If you're in ""the choir,"" it won't bother you that the people flapping their gums don't understand a thing about early modern culture.

The 'fake news' doubters, the ubiquitous conspiracists that so infest western culture of late, try to saw away at the most dangerous incontrovertible fact that buttresses William Shakespeare's authoriship of his poems and plays: HIS CONTEMPORARIES NAMED HIM AS AUTHOR AND ENVIED AND ATTACKED HIM AS AUTHOR of the plays. One noble assailant of his putative authorship goes so far to state that 'no one in his time named him as an author.' Hmmmmmm....can she name even one other Elizabethan who was EVER named as 'author' in his/her time? No.....because the idea of authorship is a thoroughly modern construct, having nothing to do with an Elizabethan workshop apparatus that allowed Shakespeare and his fellows to work at times collaboratively on the plays. -- To then posit that someone never named as an 'author' and someone who additionally (and how unfortunately!) died in 1604 as 'author' of the plays (which continued to pour forth until about 1611!) is just preposterous.
