All of them have different stories and not are recommended for teens....especially running scared which contains sexual scenes and a disturbing pedophilia couple of nuts.  The action is non stop and all three are what I would call adult entertainment.  These are not academy award stories or actors, just plain shoot em up violence or what I like to call brainless movie night with blood and guts.  No regrets on this purchase for three films I would call Guy Flicks!  Enjoy the ride!",1397088000,,587,4.605769230769231
8332526,4,B001P807R2,"I pick up bargain-rack movie DVDs at my local Ross Store. It's a fun thing to do and the price is right. Last week I picked up a collection of three movies: ""New Line Crime Collection."" I reviewed each of the movies under their own title and the review here is for the collection as a whole. It's a fairly good collection if you like violent crime-related stories and a lot of action. The production values on all three movies is high, and some really big-name actors appear on several of the movies. Be alerted that all three movies are R-rated and they've earned their rating mostly by a lot of violent action plus the foul F-speech language.

My favorite of the three movies was ""Knockaround Guys,"" a story of a bunch of young wannabe mobsters out to prove themselves and they botch the job and find it necessary to call in help. It's an interesting story and a lot of people pay the price. I rated it as four stars.  ""A History of Violence"" is the story of an ex-mobster in long-term hiding who gets outed in an unusual way and a lot of mobsters are set upon settling a few scores from the past. It's an interesting movie and I gave it four stars. I thought ""Running Scared"" was the weakest of the pack. A couple different mobs and some crooked cops are all out to find a missing and incriminating gun involved in some killings. I had trouble with the story on this one and the excessive use of the F-speak dialect grated on my nerves. I gave it three stars, but most reviewers rated it higher. All in all, I'd say this was a fairly good packet of crime-related, high action stories. I'd give the packet a rating of four stars, and if you really like this sort of thing you might rate it higher.
