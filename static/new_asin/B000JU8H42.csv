8153051,5,B000JU8H42,"I have to admit that I am a fan of the more 'epic' anime series: Fullmetal Alchemist, Ghost in the Shell SAC, Last Exile, Gundam, etc... They had copies of this series at my local library so I decided to check them out. Imagine my surprise in finding this a clever and fun series that appealed even to my American anime fan sensibilities. Without spending a year discussing the series, I would like to sum up some of the reasons it is truly witty.

First, the characters are all very well portrayed. They Genshiken members all speak in 'anime voices' and play video games constantly. They blatantly look at 'hentai' and other naughty 18+ manga and 'sex video games'. What really makes the series truly fun is the addition of the character Saki, girlfriend to one Genshiken member and Otaku hater. The English dubbing is horrible, but the Japanese with English subs works well, especially to portray the subtle speaking styles each member exhibits.

There are a TON of obscure anime references and jokes. Those not familiar with King of Fighters, Samurai Shodown, Capcom vs SNK, and other games might not grasp a few of the jokes. Also, they feature several jokes about anime series, manga, and games such as: Gundam, .Hack, Case Closed, Record of Lodoss War, Final Fantasy, Guilty Gear, Lupin III, and dozens more.

If you aren't really into a variety of these shows or games, you might miss some of the humor. I couldn't stop laughing when a friendly Capcom vs SNK match between two guys quickly became a full fledged fiasco complete with tournament brackets and special rules (""Can we switch characters between matches?"", ""where is paper so I can draw the tournament brackets?!?!?!"")

If you don't get this joke then don't bother watching: ""I think you two should cosplay as Parn and Deedlit!"" ""But I don't think she is skinny enough to cosplay a High Elf!"" ""Not her, I was thinking she could be Parn and HE could be Deedlit!""

Rent it first if you're not sure!",1274572800,,1963,4.711370262390671
8153052,4,B000JU8H42,"Otaku: a Japanese term referring to people with obsessive interests, particularly anime, manga, and video games.

Let's get that definition out of the way since Genshiken is all about otaku. There are Star Wars freaks, Star Trek freaks, and then there are otaku. They're all geeks and otaku can be some of the most fervent. Society looks down on these creatures, but the one thing society can't take away from them is their passion.

Genshiken is an anime about anime, a good natured look into the lives of the socially inept who find solace in cute cartoon characters with big eyes. Genshiken (short for ""Gendai Shikaku Bunka Kenkykai"", or ""The Society for the Study of Modern Visual Culture"") is a college club consisting of otaku that do little more than watch anime, read manga (Japanese comics), and play video games. As a club thay do nothing of any note and are essentially worthless. But in the clubroom they find friendship and a common enthusiasm for interests that others can't understand.

The story begins with a decision that freshman Kanji Sasahara must make: he loves anime, and he'd like to join the club, but that would mean being labeled an otaku. Does he want to be included in such a shameful social category? He tests the waters by attending several meetings, and what he finds are a group of people who feel no shame about their interests whatsover. Sasahara slowly realizes that this is where he belongs. He accepts himself for who he is.

Self-acceptance in the face of society's negative opinion is the central theme of Genshiken. We all have our guilty pleasures. Why should they be guilty? Is what the majority thinks so daunting that we should deny ourselves those things we love or be ashamed to love them? Should we be ashamed to live in the way that we want to live?

I don't mean to give the impression that Genshiken is dripping with philosophy. It's a comic examination of otaku culture, and it can be very funny. The conflict between those who love anime and those who hate it is what fuels the plot. The main character isn't Sasahara, who serves only as a gateway into the story, and the club members mostly serve as a supporting cast. The heart of the story rests in Saki Kasukabe, a young woman smitten with Makoto Kousaka, a member of Genshiken. Unlike most otaku, Kousaka is attractive and pleasantly self-confident, and it's these qualities that draw Saki to him. There's a problem, though: she loathes anime and finds his clubmates repulsive. She wants nothing more than to cure Kousaka of his otaku tendencies and remake him into her ideal boyfriend. To be near him she must endure spending time in the otaku clubroom, which elicits from her boredom, irritation, and occasional fits of rage. Not only does she consistently fail to cure her boyfriend, she becomes sucked into the club's activities.

She is the show's funniest and, in some ways, most sympathetic character. Her frustration and disbelief at the sheer nerdiness of these guys is understandable, and her boyfriend's blithe treatment of her drives her to distraction. She reacts violently to any suggestion that she shares their anime love, yet she has a righteous sense of justice that saves the club when it's threatened with closure by the school administration. She's a good person, but she's also representative of the general attitude towards geek passion.

Really, geek passion is no different than any other passion. Society has deemed some passions acceptable and others not, yet there's little rationale behind this. There's an interesting sequence in Genshiken in which the club members shopping for dojinshi (amateur manga) is contrasted with Saki shopping for clothes. Both the otaku and Saki display an equal knowledge and intensity of interest in their chosen products, and both rack up massive bills. Clothes are obviously more essential than comics, but a love of fashion isn't. To love fashion and to love anime are both personal choices, yet one is more socially acceptable than the other.

Social acceptability is a numbers game, really. The majority taste wins out, and I've never been a fan of the majority. For something to appeal to the majority, and thus be socially acceptable, it must be bland and predictable enough to attract a wide swath of people. It mustn't be challenging and it mustn't contradict people's expectations. I, personally, would be embarrassed to rave about noisome garbage like American Idol, but this is a perfectly guilt free enthusiasm for many. Why? Because it has the blessing of the majority. The problem isn't enjoying the occasional piece of trash. There's a humorous charm in a person that loves James Joyce and also has a thing for Gossip Girl. The problem is a public whose diet consists of nothing but trash. And otaku should feel bad about liking anime? Otaku have a consistent passion for their hobby, a true passion wholly lacking in the lazy, fickle consumers of mass entertainment.

There's a wonderful bit in Genshiken involving Kanako Ohno, the sole female otaku in the club. Ohno, Saki, and another club member, Tanaka, meet at Ohno's apartment, but before she lets them in she asks them to wait outside so that she can ""clean up."" Saki barges in out of impatience to see what a girl otaku's apartment looks like. She finds Ohno hiding posters depicting a particular anime fetish of hers: middle-aged bald guys. Ohno is deeply embarrassed because she knows it's strange, and she frantically tries to silence Saki's shouts to Tanaka to come in and check it out. ""Am I weird? You think that I'm weird, don't you?"" Ohno cries.

You're not weird, Ohno. You're an individual with a mind of your own.",1271376000,12,5667,4.8753894080996885
8153053,4,B000JU8H42,"I thought this show would be kinda stupid just from reading the description, but it turned out to be pretty good. Some of it is so true; I went to my school's Video Game club for one meeting last semester, and I could totally relate to some of the stuff on the show, haha. I was in the mood for something different, and this definitely hit the spot. Anyone who is a geek (which you are, since you're buying anime in the first place :P) would probably enjoy this show.",1246492800,2,467,4.2
8153054,5,B000JU8H42,"I originally bought this DVD because I found the Kijubiki Unbalance manga at my local retailer and readin inside that it stemmed from Genshiken.

Genshiken is an anime that celebrates otaku/nerd culture and shows the anime partly through the eyes of someone who isn't originally part of the culture and from those who are and does it in a fashion that doesn't seem forced. I would strongly recommend this to any anime lover especially athe the low price. I know I've ordered the second season already.",1223078400,,501,4.825581395348837
8153055,5,B000JU8H42,"First things first, this Anime is a GREAT. Its funny, got great characters and just screams OTAKU = WIN!

The dub is even worth watching, very few anime's get all the characters to sound like the audience want them to in English, but heck, they managed it with this. Especially Madarame...oh man...

The boxset is well worth the money, very cheap for a whole series. Also it has the Kujibiki Unbalance OVA's, and who can argue with that?! Nobody, thats who!

I Highly reccomend this product to anyone",1187913600,15,500,4.659090909090909
8153056,5,B000JU8H42,The 'special edition' box set of this same anime costs around twice as much. Why bother? Is a fancier cardboard box worth the extra $45? This is the exact same content for a much better price.,1181520000,14,192,4.361111111111111
