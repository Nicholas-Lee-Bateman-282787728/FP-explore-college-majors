5467666,4,B00AQ590H8,"I travel a lot, so loading these three movies with some of my favorite actors onto my Kindle gives me plenty for airport downtime and in-flight breaks.  All are things I would have watched on TV - no academy awards here but plenty of action.",1393286400,2,241,4.355555555555555
5467667,4,B00AQ590H8,"I remember these movies from around my High school days. Always fun to go ""back in time"" and re live some of the past. Some EARLY stuff from Nicolas Cage and Charlie Sheen.",1384473600,,172,4.242424242424242

5467704,5,B00AQ590H8,"Firebirds I think was the best, terminal velocity comes in a close second.  two great movies, not sure about the third one, haven't been able to get though it yet.",1403222400,,163,4.433333333333334
8555907,5,B00AQ590H8,Bought this for a coworker because he wanted firebirds & find this little find for a cheaper price then getting just the 1 movie. 3 for 1 is the best deal especially for the price .,1500681600,,181,4.055555555555555
8555908,5,B00AQ590H8,Good movie,1468108800,,10,4.5
8555909,5,B00AQ590H8,"I bought this video for Firebirds alone as I have never seen it but my brother told me I should check it out. After failing to find it anywhere local I figured let me check amazon they never let me down. And yes again they came through! Not only did it come with the movie I wanted but 2 more that I had never seen and was not disappointed in them either.

All of these movies are great and amazons pricing is again unstoppable. Grab this if you like good movies. They are mostly action/drama. I would break each movie down but you can imdb them if you would like I won't keep you here. All I can say is they were all good and have replay ability which is always a plus.",1466726400,,670,4.037593984962406
8555910,5,B00AQ590H8,Great movie saw it like 20 years ago and wanted to add it to my already huge movie collection also love Larry Fishburne love all his movies and shows he is a great actor even in his early days as in this movie great buy too only 6.00 dollars for 3 movies but bad company is the reason for the purchase and the only movie of the 3 that will see the inside of my DVD player lol.,1464393600,,376,3.8333333333333335
8555911,1,B00AQ590H8,"Very fast shipping, ordered Saturday delivered Monday. That is the good part..... The packaging appears to be high quality copy, video comes on 2 dvd (Terminal Velocity/ Firebirds on one disk, Bad Company on a second single.) Videos are made as MPEG-2 (may not work on newer windows 10 dvd as Microsoft has not included this codec) You will need more knowledge than I have (started with windows 3.0/ DOS 6) to get this to work on a computer/ W10 playback........",1444608000,,462,4.716049382716049
8555912,5,B00AQ590H8,I bought this primarily for Terminal Velocity as I saw it a long time ago and couldn't find it locally. The other two movies I had seen as well but didn't remember.,1443312000,,164,4.15625
8555913,5,B00AQ590H8,Love this collection....all great movies!,1438646400,,41,7.4
8555914,3,B00AQ590H8,got this for terminal velocity.  the first third of the movie is almost hitchcock good.  the middle third starts drifting.  the last third is more of a comedy than a suspense movie.  bad company was reasonably good.  i can actually believe it given todays political climate.,1432857600,,274,4.869565217391305
