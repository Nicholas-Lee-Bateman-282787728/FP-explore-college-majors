3478457,5,B001B187HK,"Coons: Night Bandits of the Night is a Troma movie, and is perhaps the funniest movie I've seen since Poultrygeist, which was another Troma movie. It's got killer raccoons, a hilarious cast of characters, and is paced very well. The actors are all great, some of them playing multiple characters. If you like horror-comedies or b-movies, check Coons out. You won't be disappointed.",1250294400,,381,5.063492063492063
3478458,5,B001B187HK,"It's a movie about teenagers getting killed by raccoons.  Let me say that again... teenagers getting killed by raccoons.  Sure it sounds dumb, and trust me it is, but it's just so much fun to watch that I don't care.  Get some friends together, get some beer, pop in Coons! and I guarantee you'll have one hell of a fun night.

P.S.
I'm sure it goes without saying for anyone that knows anything about Troma, but this is not one to watch for the easily offended.",1245628800,,462,4.337209302325581

Of course that's what any guy who's alone in the woods with a chick is gonna plead for.  Luckily there were also some generous coons (racoons, that is) that helped his lustful dreams come true.  The little critters deboobitated her and tossed him the bloody cleavage.  Good times.

Another b-movie horror spoof from those crazy Troma folks.  You will not find a more expertly-crafted, artfully splendid utilization of racoon poop in the film industry, I guarantee it.

The plot is super-complex, so bear with me.  Rick Danger, Head Ranger is trying to crack down on the kids drinkin' in the woods.  He duct tapes up some cameras in the trees and waits with his taser gun, ready to shock the drunk little punks.  But the campers have another big little problem--viciously cute little blood-thirsty coons!  Oh, the horror!

This is typical Troma stuff.  Super low-budget, lots of blood, hilarious social commentary, and plenty of just stupid moments too.  Imagine a gunfight in the woods with racoons throwing their dangerous poop and sporting M-60's.  Plus they have some annoying screeches with subtitles.

This is a fun, campy little addition to the Troma collection.  Not as over-the-top gory and gross as much of their stuff.  Plus, the chicks DO NOT GET NAKED?!?!  WTF?  A PG-13 style Troma flick, who would have thought.  Oh well, 3.5 stars.",1234569600,,1397,4.973913043478261
3478460,5,B001B187HK,"This is the first 'amateur' film (ie. without a massive budget) that I have seen but I thought it was absolutely brilliant, I enjoyed every minute of it.  The attention to details was good and there were loads of little extras which made it so much funnier.  Highly recommended!",1224806400,,278,4.653061224489796
3478461,5,B001B187HK,"This movie was so funny!  It is a spoof of all of the B-horror films that are out there.  I first saw Coons!  Night of the Bandits of the Night during a screening, and I couldn't stop laughing. True hilarity and insanity :)",1220313600,,223,4.1395348837209305

8281036,5,B001B187HK,John Sarvas is a gift to man-kind with his fine acting skills. Without him this would of been a 1 star film.,1463702400,,108,3.9545454545454546
8281037,5,B001B187HK,"Very funny film that is on par with ""Blood on the Highway"" and ""Scary Movie"" for horror comedy.",1441411200,,95,4.333333333333333

8281039,4,B001B187HK,Coons is a very funny micro budget film that is beyond silly. Definitely worth a watch.,1425081600,,87,4.5
8281040,5,B001B187HK,"A group of young people at a camp ground.  What can go wrong?  Murder, thats what.  The college studens start disappearing .  Someone is killing them...or some THING. In the tradition of Alfred Hitchcock and JAWS a blockbuster, big budget, horror movie that will have you screaming in terror every time something tips over your garbage cans.

I don't want to spoil the movie for you or give away any of the shockers but clearly this movie cost millions to make and every penny is visible on the screen.  The actors' portrayal of Frat guys is brilliant and sublime.  Method acting at its finest no doubt.

The movie over all? Two words,  SCARIFYING!  Watch it with the lights off.  If you dare",1351382400,,692,4.590163934426229
8281041,3,B001B187HK,"I soooooo wanted to like this movie. But it's a pg-13 failure. Not vulgar enough for the Troma seal of approval that it managed to get, not funny enough to be low-brow comedy, not violent enough to be a cult classic. And I'm sorry, I can not get past the fact that real dead raccoons are the props. If you're going to do that, you HAVE to justify it with cleverness, nudity/sex, or really poorly shot violence. I gave 3 stars because I know I'm going to see the next film from these guys. Because they seem to be awesomely talented and funny - this film kinda suggests that - and that movie will be first on my list. But coming from someone who thinks Toxic Avenger and Yeti are classics...I can't push this one,.",1298937600,,713,4.288888888888889
