1730401,5,B0000694Z3,"Based on the true story of the german scientists who launched America's space race, this film tells how a chimpanzee was launched into space in preparation for the human missions that were to come. Wilhelm von Huber is a brilliant scientist but is losing his connection  with his son Billy. Billy, likewise very intelligent, rejects his father's german culture in favour of being American, but faces racism from his peers. This, together with the loss of his mother, causes his grades to slide. When his father takes action on Billy's grades, it leads to Billy meeting Mac, one of the chimpanzee test pilots being trained by Dr. McGuinness (Annabeth Gish).",1350000000,,656,4.963636363636364
1730402,3,B0000694Z3,"Sorry, but this varies from the truth of the time greatly in regards to the community and behavior of the community, painfully so.  It is a fairly good whimsical tale, but the gross false painting of the time is actually insulting to the reality of what happened, and why-- and how things were done.  ONLY if you view it as total fiction from an alternate universe is it acceptable; and that's a shame.",1266105600,3,402,4.493150684931507
1730403,5,B0000694Z3,"This is a great, feel good movie!!!  A solid story that adds some suspense to the development of the Mercury rockets.  (Redstone.)  A good movie for family and kids.  Positive message and a good job by James Woods.  As always, his acting adds to the quality of the movie.
This is a must see for any family!!",1223424000,,307,4.315789473684211
1730404,5,B0000694Z3,"""Race To Space"" sat in my movie closet for close to 3 years before I ever even had thoughts about watching it.  It seemed to take low-Joe-on-da-totem-pole priority next to other stuff I wanted to see.  After watching the first five minutes, I realized what a terrible mistake I had made letting it sit there.  Based on the true story of the United States' part in the Space Race, it retells the story of Ham, the first chimpanzee (or living creature for that matter) that the U.S. ever put in to space.  This movie is not herky-jerky and while remaining historically accurate, tells this captivating and suspenseful story in a very entertaining way.  I definitely recommend this for anyone wanting a good and entertaining film.",1181779200,2,727,4.784
1730405,4,B0000694Z3,"I caught this movie on WGN afternoon movie a few weeks ago.  I have been to Cocoa Beach and took the NASA then and now tour featuring many of the sites in this movie.

This movie moves along pretty fast and is entertaining as well as informitive for kids about early NASA history even though it really is just a hollywood movie.

Not to be missed, a great family film.",1158364800,,368,4.228571428571429
1730406,5,B0000694Z3,"The movie Race to Space is a wonderful, heart touching movie, starring Alex D. Linz and James Woods. Now these two actors are so extremly good, that no matter what the movie was if they were in it, it would be entertaining. These movie was extremly entertaining and I will give it 5 STARS! Watch it!",1065139200,7,299,4.357142857142857
1730407,5,B0000694Z3,"See, the thing is...I am a huge Alex Linz fan. I watch all of his movies and I think he is an awsome actor. This movie is just excellent. The movies he is in are just so good (im not saying this just because i am in love with him lol) and i think this is one of his best. The plot is realistica and reasonable, yet a great kiddie movie (i would know cuz im 13). I went to see this at the movie theater and after the movie was over, i stood up and applauded, and that was the first time i felt that it was neccesary to do so. Everyone else did the same and, enough babbling, there is just one thing to say, THIS MOVIE IS AWSOME! Hope you enjoy it!!!",1028592000,9,648,3.8074074074074074
1730428,5,B0000694Z3,Best movie ever I see it over and over the best I'll give 10 stars,1429315200,,66,3.466666666666667

1730430,5,B0000694Z3,"One of those movies that flies under the radar and you wonder why you never saw it before.  We very coincidentally caught the last 2/3 of this movie in a hotel room in D.C. right before we headed out to the air and space museum with our 5-year-old grandson.  It tells the story of the first primates in space in the cold war era.  ""Mac"" (not his real name) is one of the chimps being trained in the US program.  A former German rocket scientist is working on the project, and is dealing with the loss of a wife, the stress of the job, and trying to integrate into a society that is foreign as well as somewhat hostile.  All this while raising a young son who is dealing with his own loss and confusion.  The boy makes a friend in Mac, and becomes the only one who can communicate with him during a space crisis.  A NASA villain, a lovely and understanding NASA scientist,  a charming little boy, a few school bullies, an endearing chimp, a forward-moving plot all against the backdrop of Cape Canaveral in the early 60's.  Not entirely factual, but close enough to make kids want to investigate further.",1406246400,,1103,4.394088669950739

1730434,5,B0000694Z3,"When I ordered the movie, I did not expect it to be so special.  It is a wonderful family movie, with great moral character -- and even contains some great ""historical"" data about the beginning of our space program.",1394928000,,215,4.512820512820513
1730435,5,B0000694Z3,"A heart touching movie. Alex D. Linz did an excellent job. His acting is outstanding. Learnt alot from this movie about the history. The special features are great. However the graphics quality is quite poor in nowdays, which looks like converted from VHS.",1389830400,,256,4.976744186046512
1730436,4,B0000694Z3,"I was actually in this movie and that is the only reason I bought it. The budget on this movie was around 2 million. James woods, I was told, took half that budget just for himself.  He wasn't very pleasent to the set staff, but was very cool to his fans. All the other acters were cool in the movie and on the set. (the fake German accents were hillarious! I speak German so it was especially funny to me) The movie is very poorly put together but I have a soft spot for it.",1389139200,,475,4.0

7965128,5,B0000694Z3,"Race to Space is based on a true story about the U.S.'s race for space. Growing up during the 50's and 60's, I remember seeing Sputnik I orbiting in October 1957. I remember the chimp, Ham, being launched in space on  January 31, 1961 on Mercury Redstone rocket on a sub-orbital flight very similar to Alan Shepard's. Ham's successful sub-orbital flight was followed by Alan Shepard's sub-orbital flight. He was followed by the rest of the Mercury 7's flights.

Race for Space is based on the chimps training and successful sub-orbital flight.",1444176000,,543,4.891304347826087
