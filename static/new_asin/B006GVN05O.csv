4987758,2,B006GVN05O,"THE SON OF NO ONE implodes under its own weight. It is another variation of the tired good cop/bad cop theme and the sins of childhood theme. Despite the presence of a heady cast of high profile actors this story just never takes off.  Perhaps that is partially due to the fact that the lead actor role is given to Channing Tatum who though he does show some gradual improvement in learning his acting skills remains a one dimensional character on the screen.

To keep it short, the plot can be condensed as follows: rookie cop Jonathan `Milk' White (Channing Tatum) is assigned to the 118 Precinct in the same district where he grew up. The Precinct Captain (Ray Liotta) starts receiving anonymous letters about two unsolved murders that happened many years ago in the housing projects when Jonathan was just a kid. A reporter (Juliette Binouce) sees the letters as evidence for an inside coverup of the two murders from Jonathan's childhood and a detective (Al Pacino) leads the `investigation' with the corroborated intent of coverup of police action.  There are scenes of flashback to when the murders occurred and the perpetrator is indeed Jonathan as a kid (Jake Cherry) whose only friend is young Vinnie (Brian Gilbert) - the victims were abusive junkies but Jonathan has never been able to forget the gruesome facts. We jump back and forth in time: Jonathan is happily married to Kerry (Katie Holmes) and they have a loving daughter with petit mal seizure disorder.  As the investigation proceeds Jonathan fears for his family's safety and for the safety of his old friend Vinnie (now Tracy Morgan). The ending is predictable and far too prolonged.

Despite the presence of Binoche, Pacino, Liotta and Holmes (and a group of very talented youngsters who play the leads as children) the story is just too drawn out and predictable and filled with violence to make it work. Dito Montiel wrote and directed.  Grady Harp, February 12",1330387200,,1937,4.8545454545454545
4987759,1,B006GVN05O,"Poor use of continual flashbacks. Weak, uninspired or thought-out script for some very good actors. Totally contrived. Good acting wasted. Don't waste your time.",1330214400,17,161,5.75
4987760,3,B006GVN05O,"Very weak plot and disappointing ending. I watched it because of Al Pacino.  He was very good as were the other actors. Unfortunately, the story really went no where and I kept waiting for a bombshell hidden agenda plot. Never happened.

White kid from the projects kills 2 worthless pathetic men. Al investigates and covers it up since he was the former partner of the kid's cop father who was deceased. Kid grows up to be cop. Past comes back to haunt them. A few more peeps die, the end.

It really had so much more potential. I rate if Fair if you can't find anything else to watch.",1330214400,,586,4.3577981651376145
4987761,3,B006GVN05O,"THE SON OF NO ONE is a moody, slow moving psychological thriller that gives away its focal ""secret"" early and drifts to its conclusion without generating any real suspense.
Blessed with a talented cast in supporting roles, the film is weighed down by Channing Tatum's one-note leading performance.  Tatum brings little depth to his role as Jonathan White, a rookie cop who carries the burden of guilt in two murders from 1986.  He doesn't evoke much sympathy and his lack of emotional maturity weakens the film.
Katie Holmes is surprisingl effective as Tatum's wife, a role one wouldn't expect from her.  Tracy Morgan has a small role and eschews his usual comic second banana persona.  Al Pacino is his usual sturdy self, Juliette Binoche is effective as the investigative reporter, and Ray Liotta chews up the scenery as expected.  Young Eric Cherry is very good as young Tatum who possesses more substance than his adult counterpart.
THE SON OF NO ONE isn't a ""bad"" film but doesn't tread any new territory.  A stronger lead may have strengthened this movie.",1329955200,,1061,4.899441340782123

4987763,2,B006GVN05O,"""You can hate me all you want, but your a free man."" When rookie officer Jonathan White (Tatum) is assigned to the precinct where he grew up letters start showing up that mention two unsolved murders. When the letters remind White of his past he is stuck between trying to uncover who is sending them and covering up his involvement. I am a huge Pacino fan and that is the reason I wanted to watch this. The trailer looked OK but anything with him I will watch. He was great in this. That about it. The movie was very slow and had a 5 minute idea that they kept repeating over and over until you either struggle through or end up finishing just to see the ending. I will admit that the last ten minutes makes it worth watching, but getting to that part is a real struggle. Any scene without Pacino or Liotta lacks emotion and you have a hard time caring for White at all. Tracy Morgan is actually not bad in a dramatic performance but overall this is one of the biggest disappointments of the year. I give it a C-.",1327449600,14,1014,4.231958762886598
4987764,3,B006GVN05O,"Channing Tatum plays Jonathan ""Milk"" White, a police officer who recently transferred to Queensboro, NY. It is 2002, the aftermath of 9-11 is going on, and acts as a symbol of Jonathan's life. The movie flashes back to 1986 when Jonathan lived in the Queensboro projects with his grandmother. He was harassed by a thug, who he shot and killed.  The body was dumped in the garbage, the crime was never solved.  A lot of people knew ""Milk"" did it. The people in the projects hate the cops.

Now in 2002, Jonathan lives with his wife Katie Holmes and a daughter with a medical condition. She is one of those adorable kids that make you want to run out and have a dozen or so.  There is a push to clean up the district, making it safe. There is an anonymous person who places articles about TWO unsolved murders from 1986, a reminder to Jonathan.  The projects is still an asylum and the cops have better things to do than to dig up a 16 year old case (the movie claims 14 years, but do the math.)

Al Pacino plays Officer Charlie who was investigating the case in 1986. Ray Liotta plays Captain Marion Mathers , Jonathan's boss. Jonathan was the son of a police officer, one that was the partner of Officer Charlie.

As the movie progresses we get more pieces of the puzzle and the harassment becomes more intense. We are drawn into it. We want to know, ""Who is the snitch?"" ""Why are they doing this?"" ""Who else knows?""  The snitch part is fairly easy to figure out.

This isn't Pacino's finest film. This isn't the best cop drama around. The acting was decent, the script had a certain amount of predictability. Katie Holmes was great for the short time she was on the screen. It makes for a decent rental.

4987778,2,B006GVN05O,"In 2006, Dito Montiel made a name for himself by writing/directing the story of his youth in Brooklyn, A Guide To Recognizing Your Saints. In that film and in several others that have since followed, Montiel has shown an amazing ability to take little known stories from his neighborhood, and in amazing detail, tells those stories from multiple angles, introducing the world to complex and amazing stories that to the world, were nothing but a blurbs in the newspaper decades ago. The Son of No One is one of such story, and while it is an amazing one, with an outstanding cast, it's Montiel's attention to detail that ultimately comes back to bite him. Jonathan White (Channing Tatum) has become a New York City Police Officer and he has done so at a somewhat older age than most other people do. There is a bit of a learning curve, but White seems to be catching on quickly, but his education comes to a quick halt when he and his family start receiving messages claiming to know that White killed two people in cold blood. The story here was terrific and unbelievably true, not to mention the cast was impeccable, so what's with the low rating? As I said, Motiel's films are always very detail oriented and focus on all the angles, The Son of No One is no different, however, in this case, they spend to much time on the back story in flashbacks. There isn't enough focus on the events taking place in present day, and when Channing Tatum is on screen, he's usually doing nothing that relates to the case, i.e. arguing with his wife, talking to his partner, learning to be a cop. By the time we get the end, it seems to jump out of nowhere, as if forty-five minutes of the film is just missing somehow. Not to mention the flashbacks are also out of order, further confusing the story. I understand artistic license, but this isn't Pulp Fiction and I was confused for much of this film. That being said, the cast is still terrific and Dito Montiel is one of the most underrated writer/directors in Hollywood. The Son of No One is a miss, but don't let that turn you off to the rest of amazing body of work.",1485216000,,2109,4.466321243523316

It's the first time I've seen Tracy Morgan in a dramatic role, and he made me feel for his character.  The end was heartbreaking and if not for the anticlimactic denouement I would say I don't know why so many people give this film such a low rating.

*****SPOILERS BELOW*******
You watched it unfold, could see it all happen a mile away, but it just didn't make sense because it was so unbelievable.  Some kid offs two junkies in a clear case of self-defense (which was awesome, the most unlucky kid on earth hahaha), then 20 years later the witness has an attack of conscience?  LOL, the letter to him at the end was hilarious, man this movie was just bad.

Maybe they could have sped up the story a little and filled in some of the massive plot holes like what is wrong with his daughter? why is the witness just now coming forward?  what is the motivation?  Why would anyone care about two murders of junkie a-holes from 20 years ago?

Sucks because I love Ray Liota and Pacino, but man what a stinker....should have read the reviews.",1391299200,,1040,4.397905759162303
4987810,1,B006GVN05O,"One look at the actors and I had to rent it. How can so much talent be wasted? That is the question. The plot had so many holes in it that it was a constant series of ""lets overlook this stupid part"" in the hope that the movie would become better. A young friend of Tatum's character is clearly so emotionally tormented (being in and out of mental hospitals) that no one in their right mind would care what he had to say concerning an alleged murder 16 years prior, EVEN IF he was the one writing letters. In the beginning we see the girl was in on the disaster, but it never occurs to anyone to ask her if she is writing these letters.
I mean sending letters to a newspaper making unsubstantiated claims about a murder committed 16 years previously would go in the trash, not make headlines. The cops would be the first people to recognize this, but instead this poor piece of direction has police captains, etc. arranging murders through a kind of blackmail. There were other instances of sloppy direction, in which a woman assaults a guy and Tatum and his partner throw the two of them into the back seat of the cop car unhandcuffed.",1388620800,,1136,4.388625592417061

4987843,3,B006GVN05O,"Former punk punk musician and Versace model Dito Montiel has come a long way in his life and career.  In 1989, Montiel and his band Gutterboy received notoriety when their band signed a $1 million record deal with Geffen Records and after cashing in with a big recording contract, the band was dropped by the label.

The experience would lead Montiel to writing a best-selling book titled ""A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints"" and would follow with a film adaptation which he wrote and direct.

In that film, Montiel worked with actor Channing Tatum (""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"", ""Dear John"", ""Step Up"") for the very first time and worked together in the 2009 film ""Fighting"".

In 2011, Montiel would write and direct his third film ""The Son of No One"" and would reunite with Channing and the independent film would also feature talents Al Pacino (""The Godfather"", ""Scarface""), Ray Liotta (""Goodfellas"", ""Smokin' Aces""), Katie Holmes (""Batman Begins"", ""Go"", ""Dawson's Creek"") and Juliette Binoche (""The English Patient"", ""Blue"", ""Dan in Real Life"").

The film was selected to close the 2011 Sundance Film Festival.

VIDEO:

""The Son of No One"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 2:35:1).  The picture quality is fantastic as there is great clarity, detail and good use of cool and warm colors.  Black levels are deep, skin tones are natural and possibly the best part of this Blu-ray release is its visual presentation.

Cinematographer Benoit Delhomme (""1408', ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"", ""The Proposition"") did a wonderful job and great choices on the film's lighting and Benoit's cinematography looks fantastic on Blu-ray!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Son of No One"" is presented in English Dolby Digital 5.1 and Spanish Mono.  The film is primarily a dialogue-driven film but there are moments such as Jonathan's car being rammed or a scene with multiple gun shots that does utilize the surround channels.  But it's dialogue and surround environments and its ambiance that plays the biggest role in the lossless soundtrack.

Subtitles are in Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""The Son of No One"" comes with the following special features:

  Audio Commentary - Featuring an in-depth audio commentary by writer/director Dito Montiel and executive producer/editor Jake Pushinsky.  Although this is one commentary that I wish was fluid, as there are some momentary gaps.
  Extended Scenes - (6:27) Featuring extended scenes from ""The Son of No One"".
  Trailer - (2:29) The original theatrical trailer for ""The Son of No One"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

If there is one major positive I can say about Dito Montiel films, it's the fact that he is able to bring together an impressive cast for his films.

From his working relationship with Channing Tatum for three films, while ""A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints"" featured impressive casting, ""The Son of No One"" is quite intriguing that you have Al Pacino and Juliette Binoche starring in this indie crime thriller.

With that being said, it's great to see Channing Tatum taking on a different type of role that he is cast in.  Usually, he is cast in younger roles or military roles but this time around, he's a family man with a wife and kid and one mysterious past.  It's a role that doesn't require too much emotion and if anything, the character role suits Tatum very well!

As a cop, who along with a few others are keeping a secret that the main protagonist, Jonathan, murdered two junkies when he was young and living in the projects.  While the film had potential, the pacing was interrupted by constant flashbacks and uninspired acting.  And for a solid cast, you would think these talents would be better utilized.  Especially if you have Al Pacino in your film.

I wish I could say that Al Pacino was magnificent but he was barely utilized in the film. Sure, his character plays a pivotal role but I wish his character had much more going on, than these few short scenes.

Casting Tracy Morgan for a crime thriller, may seem a bit odd.  But Tracy Morgan was much easier to take-in as there are no in-your-face jokes or outrageous behavior.  If anything, he does a fine job of playing a restrained character who is emotionally messed up!  No wisecracking at all. This is probably the most serious role I have seen him star in and while he wasn't utilized all that much, during his scenes...he did a good job playing a serious role.

Ray Liotta in a film is a giveaway.  If you seen his films, you know what kind of character he will be. And that's all I have to say about Liotta, without giving too much away.

And last, we have Katie Holmes.  She plays the sweet, caring wife but there is unexplored areas that I found a bit frustrating because as a wife who is concerned about your husband, somehow her role was shut down after a major emotional scene.  It's unfortunate because her role could have been explored much more, but she seems to have disappeared during the last leg of the film's storyline.

Once again, this is the problem I have with ""The Son of No One"".  Character utilization was poor, seemed rushed and while the plot had potential, this back-and-forth between present-time and flashbacks seem to hurt the pacing of the film.  If anything, would rather have less focus on the young actors, more focus on the major talents of this film.

With that being said, ""The Son of No One"" is not a terribly bad film.  In fact, the film featured awesome cinematography from Benoit Delhomme and an intriguing crime thriller that kept you interested.  It's an intriguing film but when it comes down to it, the screenplay does feel as if it was rushed.  For a film with a strong cast, I also wish that there was better utilization of the characters during the present-time storyline.

As for the Blu-ray release, the picture quality is fantastic and as for special features, the audio commentary was quite interesting, despite the momentary commentary gaps.

Overall, ""The Son of No One"" may appeal to Channing Tatum fans or anyone that enjoys popcorn crime thriller.",1336176000,,6036,4.82570593962999
4987844,2,B006GVN05O,"Perhaps it is given away by the fact that Channing Tatum looks like he's half asleep for the whole duration of ""the Son of No One"", Al Pacino, in a glorified cameo, also looks tired here. This makes sense though, not only does the movie move at rather slow pace, but the story and it's script are such worn out police procedural cliches that it is boring for all involved, the actor's wear it like a make-up effect. Without stars, a movie like this would never get a green light from financial backers, because it is clear that no one would much care to see a movie that's no better than a TV cop show from decades past.

Written and directed by Dito Montiel, who previously worked with Tatum on his vastly superior first two movies&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Guide-to-Recognizing-Your-Saints/dp/B000KB489I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fighting/dp/B002E01LL6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fighting</a>, the story structure here resembles the former, but without any of the interest or (real) human drama. A first rate cast is on hand mostly to do nothing, completely wasted here are Katie Holmes and Juliette Binoche playing the only women in the story, they get to be angry a lot of the time and yell dull dialogue at Tatum. Ray Liotta, playing a cop for about the millionth time, just when did his career get sidetracked into type casting as the authority type, I swear I saw him as a cop half a dozen times in the last year alone, Liotta gets his lines out and then leaves the movie as often as he can. Tracy Morgan, in a rare dramatic turn, comes off best mostly because he's not bad, he's far from good, but he's not bad. Montiel showed great potential with his earlier efforts, but here he shows signs of already burning out by repeating himself in themes and characters that seemed to have been already used up.

Finally a plea to Al Pacino. Pacino, sadly, in recent years seems to have abandoned all dignity as an actor. Now 71 years of age, the Oscar winner and legendary actor, seems to take movies that could never have sounded promising even on the page, the duds are compiling like a string of dominoes, that when they fall I fear could take all or part of his legacy with them. One could never doubt that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Godfather-Collection-The-Coppola-Restoration-Blu-ray/dp/B000NTPDSW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Godfather Collection (The Coppola Restoration) [Blu-ray</a>] or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scarface-Limited-Edition-Blu-ray-Digital-Copy/dp/B0019N94X6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scarface (Limited Edition) [Blu-ray + Digital Copy</a>] have been canonized as the contemporary masterpieces that they are, but similarly to the way cheapo horror films tarnished the good names of Ray Milland and Joan Crawford before him, films like ""88 Minutes"", ""Righteous Kill"", ""Jack & Jill"", and this one are already taking a huge dent out of his legacy, and younger generations may grow up knowing him only for this kind of drivel.

8497828,3,B006GVN05O,"It's beyond intense. Something within the story (maybe this was a book made into a movie), doesn't translate to film. You spend the entire moving trying to figure out who is framing him, when in the end, once the answers align, its the most obvious person. It could be considered poignant, riveting, and beautiful, or drawn out and too simple in it's complexity.

I guess I don't like that 2 youth growing up in projects, extreme victims of circumstance, never made it out of the projects, to have made something of their lives, despite the circumstances fro, which they were raised. I like to think that 2 people that grew up in such desolate circumstances, would be propelled to be anywhere in life other than their project ""prison"" circumstances.
A sad story with an unhappy, satisfying ending. Realistic, as every ending does not lead to a happy one, or a road towards salvation and upward movement",1511740800,,902,4.782051282051282

8497832,1,B006GVN05O,"The interesting cast is what attracted me to this movie including as it does Channing Tatum, Ray Liotta, Juliette Binoche, Tracy Morgan and, above all, Al Pacino.

In the event Pacino gets a little more screen time than Binoche and a little more to do but their talents, like most of those concerned with this enterprise, are completely wasted.

The film could have been called I Know What You Did In 1986, namely, accidentally kill not one but two people! Theres some action, including one character idiotically handing over his loaded gun to another but also lots of Channing Tatum looking into the middle distance, sometimes on his own and sometimes in company.

Mind you, if Id found myself in this mess Id find myself staring off into space, and I honestly recommend it as preferable to watching this muddled movie.

Perhaps its called The Son of No One because many claim to be the parents of success but failures are orphans.",1504656000,2,932,4.734567901234568
