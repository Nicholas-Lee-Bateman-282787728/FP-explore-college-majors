8510622,5,B0075NNWIM,"The two leading actors are superb. As an indian guy i could relate a lot to the main character. Kind of romance story both male and female audience would enjoy. A very underrated film. The songs are immense, especially 'Hosanna'. I would highly recommend it. Its million times better then the usual bull bollywood comes out with every year. If you like this, i would highly recommend to watch another great hindi film, 'Rockstar' 2011. Both amazing movies. Thanks for reading this review. Hope it helped :)",1334966400,6,506,4.827586206896552
