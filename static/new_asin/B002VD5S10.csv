8381923,3,B002VD5S10,"The Interceptor is a fascinating movie, presenting lots of surreal imagery and a strange battle between good and evil. There's ideas of alternate dimensions for forces of light and an ethereal darkness that is intent on spreading itself into our plane of existence. The scenery is fantastic, and the action, though a bit overdone at points(cars explode under whatever logic made them explode at the slightest whim in 80s films), is well done and involving.

There's one whopping downside. In the entire film, there's about four lines total exposition about the main story, and two lines exposition explaining ANYTHING about these weird other-dimension types who phase themselves and others in and out of our dimension at will. Plus, it plays out like there's pages upon pages upon pages of backstory that are simply never ever touched upon. I have no idea what really went on here. There's a good guy who goes after his ex-partner turned bad who's in league with some other worldly evil and there's also some other worldly good guys in shimmering robes helping out. Oh, and our main character Matvey also has an old fling now in league with the evil and is trying to protect a photographer. I think this is actually about five films' plots and subplots meshed together with some eye catching pictures.

The soundtrack's weird too. It consists mainly of one simple bass line with alternating tempo. So, Matvey walking down a corridor, slow and eerie. Matvey bashing skulls in a storage warehouse, fast and still eerie. There's none of the hard hitting action scene orchestration that you'd expect, no wailing guitar riffs storming in to accentuate that last punch to the jaw, nothing. Just this simple bass line churning throughout, keeping the film extremely subdued.

So, it boils down to whether or not you want to be pleasantly bewildered for 90 minutes or not. The story's so muddled it feels like forty minutes were just arbitrarily cut, but what remains on screen is an interesting, surreal portrayal of the fight between good and evil. Plus, the action scenes were definitely cool. For me, it warrants one viewing, but I certainly can't see myself going back again, let alone often enough to pick it up for keeps.",1276041600,4,2220,4.914666666666666
