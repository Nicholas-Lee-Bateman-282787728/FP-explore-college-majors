7453283,5,B015XC8JA2,"Saturdays, before infomercials, when the three big networks battled it for kiddie viewers, we all broke open our snack-pack foil-lined boxed cereal breakfast, poured in the milk and devoured while mom and dad still slept in from dealing with a work week that none of us really understood... SOOOOOO many great cartoon shows that aired between 6am and noon during the 1960s and ATOM ANT was a big favorite, atomic and somewhat of a cartoon take-off on the more serious comic book favorite of the time, Ant Man. ATOM ANT drew high interest in our household and I'm pleased to say that this set does not disappoint, bringing atomic waves of nostalgia and pleasure to one who had to adjust the TV antenna constantly for better reception. Bright, vivid color here, better than I ever thought was possible...A great cartoon show, a great memory. You really don't need me to tell you that you need this.",1447113600,8,896,4.75
7453284,5,B015XC8JA2,There is no better animation to watch to make you feel good than classic Hanna-Barbera!  This set is finally out as is THE SECERET SQUIRREL SHOW.  I have every set released from the 1960's - early 1970's H-B and love them!  What happened to BOOMERANG?  The cartoons kids are seeing now will make them sick adults.,1446249600,12,313,4.535714285714286
7453285,5,B015XC8JA2,I love this DVD .all of the shows are so funny. I hate that the magic of Hann Barbara is gone for good. They made the best cartoons. The cartoon of today are very bad. If you love atom ant this is the DVD for you..,1444435200,8,214,3.6739130434782608

7453293,5,B015XC8JA2,"No, Do not order this DVD set if you don't want to go back to your childhood in the mid 1960's. Saturday morning cartoons as it's best. What a time I had back then. Men going into space, The Munsters and Addams Family on tv, and of course, all the classic cartoons. This set brings back all those memories and those Hanna Barbera sound effects! Too much fun. Quality is great even though there are a few lines still on the cells. Now if the could release Wally Gator and Hokey Wolf next to complete the set.",1484265600,2,507,4.237113402061856

7453303,5,B015XC8JA2,"Up and at 'em, Atom Ant!  Animation is so-so - and yet that's part of the charm in re-visiting this absolutely wonderful series!  This disk has the companion pieces of the Hillbilly Bears and Granny and her dog (can't remember the exact name).  Those are ok - but I was expecting all Atom Ant...again no bigee...they do the same with the Magilla Gorilla CD  You know what would be great?  Combine all the Atom Ant, Magilla Gorilla and Secret Squirrel on a set of discs without the companion pieces (which again, are ok, but not the featured artists)....at least I will buy it...Now, for this one:  good story's that kids between the ages of 4 and 8 will enjoy.  Older kids will find it tame to the snot slinging, rauchy cartoons popping up on the Saturday morning fare of today.  So, if you're looking for something around the age group yet to be tainted by the new wave of cartoons - get this one (you can sneak and watch it when they go to bed)",1472774400,,946,4.365714285714286
7453304,5,B015XC8JA2,"You get 3 stories in each episode of Atom Ant including Precious Pupp and The Hillbilly Bears.
The voice of Howard Morris as Atom Ant is just classic. Great shows. It seemed Hanna-Barbera wasn't producing any DVDs for sometime. Or any that I was interested in purchasing. I'm glad they picked up the pace w/ releasing Atom Ant and Secret Squirrel. Now waiting for Quick Draw McGraw and Peter Potamus (I'm really waiting for Yippee, Yappee & Yahooey).",1467590400,3,450,4.782051282051282

7453308,4,B015XC8JA2,"One of my favorite cartoons when I was a kid. When I re-watch this now, you can see it's shortcomings. The cost is pricey, but I bought dvd because it was special to me in my childhood. Picture quality is very good transfer. Didn't realize Ernest T. Bass did the voice.
