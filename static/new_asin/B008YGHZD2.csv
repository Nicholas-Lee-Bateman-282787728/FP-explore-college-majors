8532512,4,B008YGHZD2,"This Mexican film was riding the last wave of westerns which by the end of the decade had become a shell of their former self. This deals with a lone Apache (played capably by Garcia, the muscular Latin lead of his generation) and his encounters with the intrusive world of the white man. Great battle scenes make us root for 'Cuchillo"" which is knife in Spanish as he fights off marauding cavalry troops. One by one he traps them and kills them. Not a bad little film if you want to see the Mexican era of Westerns.",1407110400,,516,4.329896907216495
