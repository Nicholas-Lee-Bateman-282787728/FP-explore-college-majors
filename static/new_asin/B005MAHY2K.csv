8479317,3,B005MAHY2K,"First off... the dvd is in a cardboard sleeve, which got mangled in the padded yellow envelope it was shipped in.  For the movie itself... this is just footage of the band, most or all shot by Billy, I think.  I really enjoy the bits from the studio; it it very interesting seeing how they work together and record, they are all virtuoso players and they are fun to watch.  There is no plot, it's just sort of free form.  Enjoyable if you're a fan.",1461283200,,448,4.235294117647059

8479321,5,B005MAHY2K,"This is a collection of wonderful music from the finest modern jazz band in global history, MMW will never fail!!!",1367971200,,114,4.75
8479322,5,B005MAHY2K,Bought as birthday present. He seems to like it even though he did to be me a birthday present this year so maybe he didn't like it.,1342742400,,132,3.925925925925926
8479323,2,B005MAHY2K,"I've been a huge fan of MMW for 10+ years now. I've seen them live maybe a dozen times, and have nearly every piece of music they've recorded. I was eager to get this DVD and was hoping for a real film along the lines of Wilco's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Am-Trying-to-Break-Your-Heart-A-Film-About-Wilco/dp/B00008IAMJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Am Trying to Break Your Heart - A Film About Wilco</a>."" But Fly on the Wall is nothing like that in scope, production values or insights. It shows a trio of amazing musicians rehearsing, performing and hanging out -- and that's interesting -- but there is no attempt to craft any narrative or show any particular perspective. As other reviewers have noted, production values are low and it's hard to hear the guys talk. The tunes are great, but there are some oddities, like the fact that one of the last songs plays the recorded version over the top of the film of the guys playing the rehearsal version -- you can actually see different notes being played on the piano than in the soundtrack. Very strange to see, when the point of the dvd is to hear what they mess around with, not the final recorded version (which we all own).

So I'll be in line to buy the next documentary about MMW if they get someone outside the band to do the filming and production, and to craft a narrative arc of some sort that tells a story of their tour, their innovation -- all the stuff that makes them the best musicians out there today.",1339200000,5,1517,4.857142857142857
8479324,5,B005MAHY2K,"It starts a little slow, but if you like MMW, you'll love this DVD. It captures Medeski and Wood through the eyes of Billy Martin (cause he directed it) and shows MMW in an intimate setting like you've never seen them.",1327708800,,218,4.341463414634147
8479325,4,B005MAHY2K,"I've always had a deep fascination with the dynamics between John Medeski, Billy Martin and Chris Wood. There's always been something strangely mysterious to me about the group's musical process and personal relationships. If you're curious like me in this department, ""Fly in a Bottle"" delivers. The first part of the film takes place in the band's Shackston Studio in upstate New York. The band is seen discussing new material that the world would eventually know as Radiolarians. These conversations happen in both the studio per se and in what appears to be a break room. At one point, musical arrangements are expressed with a marker on a white board. The 'Padrecito' section is smokin'. This footage is accompanied by artsy, psychedelic vignettes that show the band in the natural world. As eye candy, these scenes are highly compelling. During this time, John Scofield is glimpsed at the All Good Festival. The middle segment features the band on tour in Brazil, Argentina and California. The band is seen discussing dinner arrangements in the dressing room and passing border check points. The Cul Es? radio show chapter is one of the film's strongest. In addition to a great performance, the interview is revealing with regards to the band's social interactions and musical vision. Medeski Martin and Wood are also seen hangin' out on the tour bus. Excerpts of live performances are shown. In the last third, the band returns to the studio to finalize the musical ideas that have been brewing throughout the film. 'Broken Mirror' and 'Undone' are simply mind blowing. The brilliance of this band comes through at a point when John Medeski is shown playing the piano - using a flathead screwdriver on the strings. This footage is cleverly overlapped with the other take of the song when Medeski plays the piano's keys. While the viewer hears the final blended mix, the two takes are visually integrated thanks to savvy video editing. Hats off to director Billy Martin for this creative sequence. These final studio scenes are overlapped with mind-expanding footage of Southern California.

  When it comes to the committed fans, there's no doubt that ""Fly in a Bottle"" delivers. If you're as curious as I've always been about the inner workings of Medeski Martin and Wood (MMW), the film is a must. It's a relief that the band released this film that once could only be had through the hundred dollar ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Evolutionary-Set/dp/B002R8EASG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Evolutionary Set</a>."" Considering the many strengths of ""Fly in a Bottle,"" the film has three issues. First, it could have been done better. Much of the footage is shot on a hand held camcorder. Since nobody wears a mic, it's often difficult to hear what anybody's saying. Additionally, the music is often significantly louder than the voice levels. Similarly, the film is at times challenging to watch given the rough footage and choppy editing. Think about those times in a live MMW performance when the band just gets too far out there for too long. Likewise, ""Fly in a Bottle"" is often an avant-garde film. Second, while it is rewarding to finally see these guys interact through the creative process, there are no epiphanies. Third, only snippets of songs are played. This issue could have been rectified in the extras. When it comes to the bonus features, 'Amber Gris' is the highlight. It features a phenomenal music video to the song. In the end, ""Fly in a Bottle"" offers glory but it can be a difficult initial watch. As with MMW albums, the treasure only emerges through repetition. ""Fly in a Bottle"" is too hardcore for casual Medeski Martin and Wood listeners but it is essential for die hard fans.",1322006400,6,3749,5.072933549432739
