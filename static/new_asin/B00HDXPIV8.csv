6155208,5,B00HDXPIV8,"I have several Zumba products, including Xbox, and this one is the best. I am in my 50's and have been exercising almost every day for the past 30 years. This one is fun as it can be modified and the steps on the riser are fun yet safe. the 20 minute is also very good as is the calorie killer. Any time you can watch Beto, time flies by :)",1390176000,92,340,3.8028169014084505
6155209,4,B00HDXPIV8,"After using the original Zumba dvd's for about a year....wanted to add something to the mix.  Checked all of the exercise programs but this was the one that I like the best.  Don't  like  going to gyms or machines having to count reps.  Zumba , whether this package of the original is a great way to enjoy, yes enjoy, exercise.  Zumba is great...and...it works.",1389830400,25,361,4.5625
6155210,5,B00HDXPIV8,"I had purchased total transformation and really loved it, but when Zumba Exhilarate came out I was not sold on the ""party"" theme.  It was just by chance that I discovered there was a new program and I decided to buy it for myself as a Christmas present.  I have also participated in Zumba classes so I have been exposed to that type of environment as well.

With that background, I can say that I really enjoy this new program.  Each workout is fast pace, the instruction is just enough to understand the basics as you begin the program.  Then as you get to know the routines the non verbal cues are perfect and I felt as if I were in a Zumba class, a challenging one!

Each of the workouts is great, its easy to see the routines and steps because there are no tricky camera techniques...and the ""Rizer"" for Zumba Step is a great addition.  I found the workout entertaining and the rizer is stable.  However just as a warning there is only one workout video that requires the Rizer and it is not a very tall step either (3 inches), which for the record I liked and since the step workout is fast pace you will soon understand why you shouldn't have a higher step.

So far I have used every workout and enjoyed each one, the time duration of these videos varies, so I am motivated by the variety of routines that fit with my daily schedule and now I really look forward to the workouts and don't quite miss the live Zumba class I sometimes take....no offence Nikki.",1389139200,242,1464,4.333333333333333

6155227,5,B00HDXPIV8,"I have been off the Zumba scene for a few years. I own the other DVD sets and have always done Zumba in my home. When I saw this new set with the stepper, I was sold on sight!

When I received the set I started with the quick workout first that did not use the stepper. Music is great and I felt the burn. They combined new moves with the old favorites. After a few days getting back into the ""Zumba Dancing"" I decided to give the stepper a try.

So when it comes to the stepper I must first say I have never used a stepper before. When the DVD started there are warm up moves on the floor dancing around the stepper. The DVD gently added the use of the stepper. It was a little awkward for me to use the stepper on some of the moves, but I am sure with practice I will get it.

Overall I do see the benefit of the stepper and I think Zumba did a good job revamping their dance workout with the addition of the stepper.",1455321600,,919,3.9037433155080214

6155235,5,B00HDXPIV8,I've so far tried 2 of the DVD's and am more excited than I've been in months!  I have been doing Zumba for over 5 years. I used to go to classes but learned all the moves and songs and have been doing it daily for an hour at my house. This DVD set is a perfect blend of moves and very high cardio. Might be hard for beginners but I can follow quite easily and am breaking a sweat which also hasn't happened in my normal routine in quite a while. The instructors are fabulous. Highly recommended!!!,1452902400,7,498,4.081632653061225

6155244,5,B00HDXPIV8,"I'm pretty new to Zumba and found this workout to be loads of fun.  I have the Zumba for Wii, but I haven't used it in a couple years because it wouldn't let me progress to the next level.  I've heard so many people talk about how much fun they have at Zumba classes, I thought I'd give this workout a try after reading so many positive reviews.  Being over 55 and using Shaun T's Hip Hop Abs and Rockin' Body workout, I thought I needed to add more variety my workout routine to keep my metabolism up, so my body parts wouldn't start gravitating to earth. If you're new to Zumba I would highly recommend using the verbal cues option.  The 30-minute Burn workout doesn't have verbal cues, but they sure would be helpful because I found myself all over the place trying to keep up with the moves.  Maybe this workout is so fast paced, that they couldn't talk that fast.  I also found using a regular chair unstable for the ab workout, so I used my RED exercise machine that I was going to donate to a charity because I hadn't used it in years and found that I was more stable doing the ab workouts because the RED machine has handles on the side to hold onto.  I started wearing a simple ""under the knee"" brace using Shaun T's workout for a sprained ligament in my left knee from boot camp almost 40 years ago, but for the Zumba workouts, that knee was screaming for mercy with that simple under the knee brace, so I had to buy a more stabilizing knee brace that looks like a knee girdle, but it does the job. These workouts are alot of fun, the time flies by and you will sweat.  I highly recommend this workout.",1444608000,11,1612,4.228013029315961

They are great total body workouts that are fun to do.

I have been trying to do some exercise but for some reason I just cannot find something that I really like and works for me. When I saw Zumba I thought to myself ""this is it, I love dancing, why not lose weight doing something that I really love?"" I am Latina and I love Salsa, Merengue, ChaChacha, Cumbias, etc, and when I tried the Quick Start + 20 Express, I could feel my whole body working out and I was actually sweating! For some reason, when I do aerobics or go to the gym,  it doesn't matter how hard I work out, I don't sweat at all.

I was excited to get started. The first time I tried it, it was  a little difficult to do some of the moves but it was fun at the same time.

The only cd that I was not thrilled at was the max one. It is not because of the songs or the dance moves..it was because of one particularly annoying dancer. I really do not want to point her out...but she is so annoying that I very rarely put the cd on. Other that that, I love this Zumba kit..it is really fun. I am eager to try out the other step cd's....",1427500800,2,487,3.979591836734694

6155329,1,B00HDXPIV8,"I have the Xbox360 Kinetic Zumba ""workout games"" and they made me fall in love with Zumba.

I took a few Zumba classes and I loved them as well.

This, on the other hand... not so much. The production is crappy. It's just really boring. The dance moves aren't any fun at all. I barely got warmed-up doing it.

The ""step"" thing is absolutely pointless and you could tell that they were really trying hard to integrate it.

I sent it back.",1425254400,6,437,4.2926829268292686

Zumba integrates HITT, toning, warm up & cool down. Just when you think you cannot do one more movement, it changes. This keeps your muscles guessing.
There is adequate verbal cuing so you know when your movement is about to change. Additionally Zumba choreography has rhyme and reason. The choreography during the chorus is the same throughout the song and the choreography during the verses are the same. This allows you to easily grasp the choreography.
There are many sessions to choose from in this pack, with varying lengths (20 min-1 hr). Buy it!",1424563200,,754,4.634328358208955
6155336,2,B00HDXPIV8,"I did not buy my set from Amazom, i did come here to check out reviews so I wanted to share my thoughts here. First let me say that I loved the first Zumba set, so much so that when Exhilerate the second Zumba set came out I bought it right away.  Sadly I did not like it at all.  It was a total disappointment.  so I was very careful researching this set before I purchased. So here are a couple things that I did not find out till I purchased that has thoroughly disappointed me.
One, some of the workouts do not have any verbal queuing so the instructor will point to the leg and you are supposed to know what comes next....that does not work for me!
Two, the ones that do have verbal instructions are done by someone off stage, so the Que  comes usually after the step has started,
and three, because of the non verbal queing and the off stage instructions, I do not feel a part of the class, but rather an obsever of these super cool people doing their thing.
Think of it like watching a class through a window, you can hear the music blast, the people are moving their mouths, you can not hear what is being said so you are not part of the group.  I have reverted back to my first set of Zumba DVD's where they give me the instructuins and make me feel like I am part of the class and not watching a performance.",1424563200,5,1318,4.093023255813954
6155337,5,B00HDXPIV8,I had the original zumba and loved it.  This set is just as much fun that it does not seem like you are working out. High energy workout that is engaging and a lot of fun.,1424476800,,171,3.75
6155338,3,B00HDXPIV8,"Fun, but hard to follow at times. It seems like every new Zumba system gets faster and faster. I found this one harder to follow when it came to some of the moves. (Especially Belly dance/ bollywood hand gestures).they weren't ever explained..which is unfortunate because I really want to do it. Then again, I found the EXHILARATE system to be equally as difficult to follow at times. I wonder  why they don't feel like they should thoroughly explain the moves like they did with the original program.",1424390400,,501,4.758620689655173

My only advice is to get this at bed bath and beyond instead. It's $60 there and I got it for $45 with a 20% coupon. Is it worth $75? Yes. But why not save $30?

Don't feel overwhelmed at first.  If you have never done anything like this but love rhythm you will enjoy these sessions and can grow into them. They will take you as far as you desire to go!  I suggest watching, and learning the foot movements, gradually adding the body moves.  Do a little everyday and you will be a pro in no time.  Have fun with it!

Fun songs, fun to follow and the workouts fly by. I really feel like I'm dancing with some of the DVDs and that's terrific. Since Christmas I've done maybe 8 sessions and feel a difference.  Whether or not the scale agrees, I mentally feel lifted and look forward to the next workout.  I wouldn't want to trade that feeling for anything. Thank you Zumba!

It's a great, fun routine with great music so I wish there were more or that there were some more you could buy separately to use the rizer more. It's a great workout.

6155378,2,B00HDXPIV8,"I hate to write this because Zumba its my favourite workout. I am a lazy person, I hate doing exercises, and I get bored really fast, so when I saw there was a new Zumba, I was so excited, because I loved exhilarate. Exhilarate makes you think you are in a party, and they have intensity moments. I loved the part when you travel around the world with different styles, SO MUCH FUN!. But this one, I have not been able to get through with any of the DVD's, and that never happened to me with the other ones. I hate that it feels more like aerobics than dancing. And man! I miss Tanya, she was so cool!. I'm not really feeling the new instructors. And the music SUCKS. Really, I am latina, and that's why I love Zumba, it feels like I'm learning moves from my culture, and I am exercising at the same time. This Series I feel more pressure, aerobics style, and well it feels like exercise. And I did not feel like that with the other DVD's. I know it is supposed to be exercise, but well at least have some fun in between and I am not feeling with this series.

I write this more for the producers than for customers, I want them to realized that exhilarate was way better, just the scenario! it felt like a party, this one? I'm back at the gym, and if I liked being in a gym I would just go to one, and I hate being there, so... nah it just feels boring, not the excitement that the other one had.

Why make myself feel that I have to work out in order to be healthy. Why not do an exercise I enjoy doing? I used to love dancing and I remember having some pretty good moves back in my younger years. So I decided to get this Zumba set based on everyone's reviews and I LOVE IT!!!!!

You may laugh at yourself for dancing crazy as some people say but trust me it's so much fun! Dance alone or dance with a friend and you will have so much fun! It doesn't matter don't do correctly just try your best because Zumba is not hard  and it's not hard to dance to! :) Zumba is my opinion the ONLY way to lose weight and get the body you want because you have to know that losing weight takes time and takes patience losing weight doesn't happen over night !",1418342400,3,1150,4.079646017699115

I love this new set!  I lost about 40lbs in a year (I don't have the best eating habits) with the first set, and I can't wait to see how much I can lose, plus sculpt and tone a new booty!

6155402,2,B00HDXPIV8,"Let's start by saying that I've done Zumba classes on and off for years, and have the Total Body Transformation DVD's at home, which I do regularly. I was starting to get burnt out on the same exercises so I figured I'd upgrade my Zumba DVD's to the newest system, and was super excited to try the new workouts.

This Zumba is verydifferent. More intense for sure, but also because it incorporates more basic aerobic moves along with new (and some old) Zumba moves. It definitely feels less authentic than the original DVD's, the music has a lot more modern electronic/club elements and it overall lacks the core latin spirit I'd come to love about Zumba. But it seemed like a good workout, so I went with it.

I was a hardcore dancer for 12+ years in my youth, and again, I've been familiar with Zumba for many years. So far, the 30-Minute workout with Gina is the only one I can tolerate. These workouts are like Zumba on speed and it's very tough to keep up. Not necessarily physically though - more with the actual steps themselves. They're over complicated and change every two seconds so you end up feeling more concerned with trying to get the steps right then actually dancing and having fun. The Super Cardio Dance Party workout is the worst. I was getting into it and keeping up for the first couple routines, but once it hits a routine called ""Vum Vum"", the steps would change within every 2-4 movements and it added directional movements that would constantly throw me off no matter how many times I practiced them. I wanted to be patient and thought I just needed more practice with it, so I've tried this workout on several different occasions now and always get annoyed with it halfway through. Something about it just doesn't feel like real Zumba. The ONLY aspect I like about this version of Zumba is that they've started incorporating Bachata which of course everybody loves. But there's hardly any salsa or merengue incorporated in any of the songs (just a few here and there), and none of the original hip-hop or samba movements - several of them are ""fusion"" songs which in theory is cool, but the routines go so quickly that you don't have time to master them before moving on to something else. I tried the ""learn the moves"" portion of the workout on two separate occasions, but it doesn't even cover the most complicated/fast-paced ones in the workout. I'm not a type of person that can just freestyle with my own movements when I get tripped up. As a seasoned dancer, I can't handle not being able to keep up with basic steps. It seems ridiculous that even someone with a dance and Zumba background would have a hard time with it. I'll continue to do the 30-Minute Burn workout as I do like that one and the steps aren't crazy - plus it's let by Gina who I like. (Where is Tanya in these DVD's????? Why does it seem like all the (historically latin) females featured in previous DVD's have been replaced by (sorry to say) white girls?? Sorry, but it's a legitimate question. I just get the impression that Zumba has shifted it's marketing techniques towards middle-class suburban moms now. Not that there's anything wrong with incorporating more ethnicities within the instructors, something just seems a little off balance here.) Also, another gripe is that the Cardio Dance Party workout doesn't have any (ANY!) stretching in the cool down. It's just a basic slower-step movement to a (GOD AWFUL) super-cheesy ballad that sounds like terrible library music from the 90s and is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. Seriously, whoever picked this cool-down song needs a serious lesson in good workout music. Sometimes cheesy is fun, but this sort of cheesy feels ridiculous and humiliating. I lose 20 cool points every time I listen to it.

Moral of the story - if you're uncoordinated in any capacity, or don't have some sort of dance or movement experience, you're going to be frustrated with this workout. Very possible that even if you are (coordinated with a dance background), you may still be frustrated. If you want to try Zumba but you haven't already at all - I would HIGHLY discourage starting with these DVD's.",1414368000,183,4149,4.673050615595075

Very disappointing!  It could be a fun, excellent program.",1413072000,2,422,5.028985507246377
6155411,5,B00HDXPIV8,"I have been always doubtful of buying things online or that are sold on TV because they generally don't work are they are supposed to work.  This is not the case with this Zumba program.  In general, it is very good. You can follow most of the steps even if you do not have good coordination.  If you cannot follow all the steps, you can still keep moving and try to get back on track.  That's what I do because I don't have very good coordination.  One of the CDs has an introduction that teaches all the steps you need which is very good if you don't know how to dance Latin music.  I get a good work out with every one of the CDs.  Out of the five CDs, I like three the most Super Cardio Dance Party, 20 Minutes Express, and Zumba Step.  The CDs that I like the least are 30 minute Burn + Amazing Abs and Zumba Max .  They are good, but they are not as good as the other three.
I think all these CDs have the option of having the verbal cues on or you can turn them off.  I like to leave them on.  I have never been to a live zumba class so I cannot make the comparison to one, but I compare this with step classes and fitness classes that I took before, and I would say I get the same work out.  So this program has the advantage that you can do it at home.  It is worth the money that you pay for if you work out often.  About the Step that comes with the program, it works well.  It is steady, and I have not had any problems with it so far.  I do the work out on a plastic surface that I put on my carpet, but the step is on the carpet, so I cannot say how it works on a wooden surface or tile.",1412899200,3,1601,3.806060606060606

6155422,3,B00HDXPIV8,"I do not like either the step or ab workouts.

I found the step workout ineffective, A large part of the workout is taken up with walking round the rizer. When the intensity is higher it involves jumping on and off the rizer which I did not feel comfortable with.

The ab workout is mostly done sitting on a chair. I found it gave me lower back pain.  I much prefer standing ab workouts and will substitute this workout for the previous Zumba ab workouts in Exhilarate, Target zones and Total body transformation sets.

On a positive note I really like the other workouts. The instructors, routines and music are good, so the workouts are enjoyable.  The Super Cardio Party with its high intensity intervals is really good.

Zumba Fitness Incredible Results DVD with Zumba Max DVD

 What you get:
Quick Start (an introduction to the steps)
Step (40 minute step routine)
Zumba riser (step)
Super Cardio Dance Party (60 minutes difficult routine in terms of intensity but with easy to follow steps)
20 Minute Express (short and fairly easy)
30 Minute Burn (easy to follow steps but no directions)

Thoughts about Incredible Results:

I love pretty much all of it, except I rarely do the 20 Minute Express and have never done the Quick Start
Steve Boedt in the Super Cardio Dance Party is really funny.
The Step workout is my FAVORITE!
I wish there was another step workout.

Zumba Fitness Exhilarate Body Shaping System DVD (Multi, Small)

What you get:
Step by Step (an introduction to the steps)
Activate (40 minute easy routine)
Exhilarate (60 minutes difficult routine both in terms of dance steps and intensity)
Rush (22 minute routine that is intense but short)
Ripped and Mix (30 minutes of cardio toning with the sticks, plus a 60 minute cardio routine)
two, one pound rhythm sticks

Thoughts about Exhilarate:
Rush and Ripped are my favorite. Usually I do them together.
The sticks are too easy for me now, but were really helpful when I was rehabbing my broken wrist.
Exhilarate is really hard for me to do on the carpet. I think it would be easier on wood floors.
The costumes are wild. I could imagine conservative people having a hard time with so much skin.

Final thoughts about Zumba?

Zumba is super fun. Exhilarate is slightly easier I think, but beginners would like Incredible Results too. If you're going to go for it, I would suggest getting the shoes as well. Otherwise you cant slide properly on the carpet. The first few times I did Zumba I had my ordinary gym shoes on and I kept tripping. Zumba shoes have a smooth sole and that really helps.

6155476,5,B00HDXPIV8,"I am a former college athlete and have been committed to staying fit my whole life.  The only class I was ever involved in was when I was in my undergraduate when I instructed the baseball team in aerobics, when classes were first being recognized as an important alternative to simple cardio, drills and weight lifting.
At 50 after working out on my own for many years, I decided with the advice of a trainer to try a Zumba class. I gasped and gave an excuse that ""I NEVER TAKE CLASSES and never had desire to"".  Routine classes bored me and I hated feeling as if I was competing to keep up.
Reluctantly, I took a class....instantly, I was addicted.  I am not terribly coordinated, especially with latin moves, but, the variety in classes and the instructors making it fun shock me in terms of the outcomes I achieve.  I work out hard independently, but, after every Zumba workout I am sweating my b*tt off!!! I use different muscles and the focus switches or combines muscle and cardio training.
After taking classes and realizing that I frequently don't have time to go to classes at the 2 gyms I belong to, my daughter bought an XBOX One and we bought the latest Zumba video for that (World Party)....Love it, Love it, Love it....
Soon, however, my daughter will move and take her XBOX and I won't buy one because of the expense.

So, I researched and found the videos.  I love the videos, the variety, the stair stepper (another thing I vowed I would never do), and hope they come out with more.  What I like about the videos is that unlike with the XBOX One, I am not scored and I am just having fun with live instructors-the original Zumba people.  The cost is reasonable and it is just a lot of fun.  In combination with the gym, training tools, walking dogs and competitive tennis...I am so addicted to Zumba and feel that learning the moves has given me confidence in my ability to ""shake my hips"" and try dance moves I never thought I could do.  More importantly and from a practical standpoint, all of the variety of body movements with dance is helping me greatly in tennis in terms of shifting on the court and movement.  I recommend this product to those who love Zumba and those who have never tried it but are trying to find something to get in shape.  You have to let your pride go and just have fun.  Perfection is not the goal.  ZUUUMMMBAAA!",1402531200,3,2361,4.435185185185185
6155477,4,B00HDXPIV8,"Ok in all seriousness it is a good workout,  I work up a sweat and burn a lot of calories.  My living room is too small for 2 people to do this together but that's ok because my Boyfriend loves to watch Holly and the identical blond twins from Sweeden are pretty hot too,  well Hot only in the sexual sense because after 45 minutes of intense exercise not one woman in this video breaks a sweat, they all have painted on smiles and beautiful hair which is ridiculous for working out in the first place.
  Lots of shots of these ladies' belly buttons to entertain my Boyfriend while I try to figure out on my own what to do with my arms and legs because after all,  this is supposed to be MY workout video and when we're not doing abs, I don't need the close up of Hollie's bellybutton
  I should add that while the instructor is rather good looking,  all the OTHER men are pretty goofy-looking and I suspect that was intentional.  So A great workout for me although some days I wonder if my teenage son might be watching this when I'm not home.
  the downside is that Rizer is big, doesn't fold up and there is only one DVD that uses it.  If you take step Zumba at a gym they use the long rectangular steps that regular step aerobics uses (which I happened to have had one at home) so I feel like this was a silly way to scam us out of money by making the home set use a round rizer, as opposed to a rectangular one,  However the dance moves in this DVD wouldnt' work with a rectangular rizer so it's perfect for home use if you don't do step at a studio.  Or if you're male and feeling lonely or while waiting for your girlfriend to be a little hotter  which should happen if she does zumba on a regular basis, but why wait, you have hollie and the sweedish Twins.",1402444800,4,1765,4.131964809384164

6155480,3,B00HDXPIV8,"I was looking for more of the same, fun workouts that I was getting in the original zumba, only changed up for variety.

Yes, these will give you a great workout. But something about it is just too ""showy"". I don't like the people who are running it. The class is done with no words, so they're not talking or interacting with you, it just has a voice-over that you can turn off or on, depending on if you want the moves spoken to you as they're being done. Just leaves you with a very non-personal feeling.

And, this seems lame, but for some reason I just don't like the ""zumba twins"". I feel like they're these barbie doll models that were used to be the token ""hot girls"". Well, it just looks so plastic that it turns me off. I want the original zumba people, and all their personality!

The dances are not as fun as the first ones, reminds me more of being in aerobics classes.

But, the quality is great, I can't really complain about not getting what I purchased, so I still give it 3 stars. Arrived quickly and works perfect. I just wish they would have kept the original zumba feel and style, with just new routines.",1401753600,20,1125,4.2924528301886795

I ordered it, and started using it right away, the crossover to implementing the stepper wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  I'm not very coordinated, and I seem to run a step behind, but it is fun, energetic and it works.  I highly recommend it if you're looking to step your exercise regime up a notch or two.  At least give it a try, if I can do it with no coordination or dancing skills, I'm sure you'll have as much fun trying to do it as I do, since its all about keeping it moving anyway, ""JUST DON,T QUIT"" and you'll see the results.",1401580800,3,727,4.062937062937063

I did take the class once, but between the instructor not taking time to explain any moves at all or break it down into steps and my lack of rhythm I resembled  a huge bird falling out of a tree.

With this I can do it at home behind the privacy or my wonderful blinds and the DVDs break down the steps at a wonderful pace for beginners. This package comes with 6 DVDs as well as a workout schedule that gives you 3 different options to choose from depending on experience and user preference for intensity. It even has a meal plan and recipes which is my opinion justifies the price. The little green step is also very sturdy and made well and is bigger than it appears in the picture so you have plenty of room to step up with 1 or both feet. It has gripper pads at the bottom so if you have hard wood floors don't worry you won't accidentally do some seriously painful splits.

6155526,4,B00HDXPIV8,"I have been doing zumba for many years. I have the exhilarate set, the ps3 game and the wii games as well as the older DVD's. It really is the only fitness program I have been able to keep up with. I do not do zumba to lose weight. I mostly do it to keep my current weight and to also have nice curves. After trying this, I must say I enjoy the video games a bit more. I am not a fan of doing the same routine over and over and I find that the video games have many more songs and routines and you can mix and match the routines you feel like doing that day, where you can only do these so many times. I like the 20 minute express dvd because you can get a fast workout in but I do not feel as though it is very intense and there is no warm up or cool down so you have to warm yourself up on your own. The riser routine is pretty good. Definitely works up a good sweat and you have sore legs the next day. The ab workout was ok, I didn't feel as though it was intense enough. Sadly, one of my favorite instructors, Gina is only on one dvd in the 30 min workout but the workout is fantastic. Wish they would of put her in more routines. The zumba bursts where you have 30 seconds of very intense moves does make you sweat and they can be hard. I had to take a few breaks with that one. Overall, not bad, but not my favorite.",1395705600,6,1323,3.8145454545454545

6155531,4,B00HDXPIV8,"Zumba really is back, the energy was amazing and in my inexpert opinion the choreography is the best yet. New instructors in this one with Gina only making one appearance which I thought was a pity, but maybe next time. I haven't given it a 5 because i think the cool down and stretch could be better, the cuing still isn't that great compared to other dvds (although by zumba standards it's come a long way), and I thought the instructors were hamming it up a little too much in some work outs, but for all that I really loved the incredible results programme.  I wasn't at all a fan of the Exhilarate series and haven't touched it in over a year. This new work out series went back to basics with a new attitude and the result was that I had fun again.  I hope they bring out more in this style. I initially though the rizer would be just some new gimmick no different to a normal step board, but I was surprised at the difference it makes.  The smaller shape really allows you to keep dancing zumba style while working out. I'd love to see more work outs like it. You could try using a normal step board on the short end, but I imagine it could get a bit irritating. Overall I completely recommend this to any zumba fans.",1395187200,12,1224,4.244635193133047

6155535,5,B00HDXPIV8,"The Short Review: Should you buy this? Yes you should.

The In-Depth Review:

Let me preface this by saying that I own Zumba: Total Body Transformation and Zumba: Exhilarate, so Im not a newbie to this. I exercise in my living room, barefoot, on carpet. Zumba for me was never about losing weight, but rather maintaining my current weight and just staying healthy.

Here we go!
Zumba Incredible Results comes in a huge box- inside is the new Zumba Rizer, 4 discs in individual paper sleeves, a program guide, and a nutrition book. The program guide talks about the history of Zumba, gives suggested workout calendars, and introduces you to the All Stars (the dancers). The nutrition guide has a bunch of delicious sounding healthy recipes that I know darn well Ill never actually make.

The Workouts
Before I go into detail about each individual workout, I should say that every routine is in a well lit studio, as opposed to the darker, club-like atmosphere of Exhilarate, and the music is wonderful. With the possible exception of the rock n roll song (honestly, why cant they get that one right?), the music is never that sort of uptempo elevator music you get in a Denise Austin workout (no offense Denise- Ill always love you). The editing is great- I didn't catch any moments where suddenly the dancer on screen is doing the complete opposite of what Im doing, even though I KNOW I stayed on the beat. You need like an 8x8 space to do these workouts, but you could modify them if you're working with less space.

Quick Start: Loretta and Hermann take you through the basic moves. There were only a couple of moves I didn't recognize from previous Zumba incarnations, so if you're a pro, you could easily skip this part. If you're new to Zumba, I strongly encourage you to take the time (39 minutes) to learn the steps. They show you the moves full speed, then slow it down so you can learn it.

20 Minute Express: Nick is the host. There isn't a warm up, unless you count the first song, and no cool down. Theres also no option to turn off the vocal cues. Compared to the 20 minute routines from the earlier Zumba sets, I found this one to be not nearly as intense. Itd be perfect to use on a day when you know you should get up and move but you don't want to kill yourself.

Zumba Step: This is Zumbas new baby- the Rizer. The Rizer itself is a step about 4 tall, 16 wide, hard plastic, and weighs about 3 lbs. Unless you really try, you won't tip it over. There are nubs on top to keep you from sliding off. I ignored the instructions and used it barefoot, with no problems. The only potential problem I could see is if your feet get sweaty- it might get slippery. Beto hosts, and there is the option to turn off the voice over. There are four other All Stars with him, all ladies with MUSCLE in their legs. Its refreshing to see. 45 minutes, including a cool down. The workout is fantastic- its not just a basic step routine. Theres a bit of dancing, and plenty of leg sculpting moves. However, if you're like me and lift relatively heavy weights for your lower body, this might be too easy for you. But if you're new to sculpting, this is perfect.

30 Minute Burn: Simply excellent. Gina is the host, and a different All Star joins her for each song. Sadly missing is Tanya, my favorite dancer from the previous sets. Theres no option to turn off the vocal cues, but Gina hardly talks at all. High energy routine- you will sweat. Its fast, but relatively easy to follow along. No cool down, but the final song moves slow.

Amazing Abs: About 17 minutes, no warm up or cool down. You should definitely stretch afterward. This is adapted from Betos Sentao routine from Exhilarate, and takes place mostly in a chair. There are dance moves sprinkled throughout. You do have the option to turn off the voice over. If you don't usually work your abs, this is probably going to leave you sore the next day, primarily in your obliques.

Super Cardio Dance Party: 55 minutes, including cool down. Kass, Steve, and Ricardo take turns leading. You have the option to turn off the vocal cues. There is a Learn the Steps section that only lasts about 5 minutes and frankly, I skipped it entirely. The routine does a nice job of balancing super fast Oh my gosh, Im going to die songs with slightly slower songs to let you recover. Each song includes cardio bursts, wherein the picture turns black and white and you get to really exhaust yourself with a high intensity move for 30 seconds. This one may be tough to follow at first, but stick with it. As long as you keep moving in time with the music, you're golden.

Overall, its amazing to see how far Zumba has come. Theyre much more polished now than they were in the early days, but theyve maintained their Latin flair. If you stick with it, you WILL see results. At the very least, youll become a better dancer. Your hips will move in ways you didn't think were possible. So yes, you should buy this.

The step dvd is pretty good and I was excited to try a new feature, but the superdance party DVD is the best!!! I burn a lot of calories and its good song selections. My only complaint so far are the verbal cues. I guess some people like the option to not have the verbal cues, but I would prefer if the instructors would just talk directly into the camera like the 20 minute express dvd and most other videos. When I first did the step dvd, it just felt weird but I guess it takes time to get used you.",1394496000,3,603,4.11864406779661

I must say I am partial to Beto and the two ladies that's on other DVDs. So with that being said, I wasn't happy with the other instructors leading the dances. The 20 minute DVD instructor talked and talked and I could barely ear the music. Not only that he didn't even know the names of the moves! Ugh!  I didn't get the party vibe as I've gotten in the other Zumba systems, this felt like I was in an aerobics class.  I would return it but I think the rizer is a great addition to Zumba. I always felt like I was in latin dance class when I do Zumba, not this time.  :(",1394409600,10,697,3.921985815602837

6155542,1,B00HDXPIV8,"I got introduced to Zumba at the gym about year and a half ago. I fell in love with it. However, I recently canceled my gym membership because it was too expensive and saw the Zumba incredible results on an infomercial. I was extremely disappointed when I received it and returned it the same day. For starters I would say 90% of the songs are corny. Secondly, I wasn't expecting the 20 min express disc to include the instructor yapping his mouth the whole time. I enjoyed maybe the first 2 mins of the workout and then couldn't wait for it to be over. Oh and not to mention that the audio quality is terrible! I have a brand new tv with surround sound and absolutely did not feel like I was at a ""party."" Seriously don't waste your time!",1394150400,21,739,4.285714285714286
6155543,3,B00HDXPIV8,I started going to zumba classes at the gym a few years ago and loved it. Each instructor is different but it has been fun learning different songs. I had a baby and couldn't get to class as much so I bought this system. I am incredibly disappointed. This is nothing like any of the classes I have been to. I had a hard time getting through half of the dance party DVD. After any hour at reg class I'm always bummed it's over. It is just like any cardio DVD. Nothing out of the ordinary. In hindsight i'd save the money and pick up a Latin dance DVD at target for a few bucks. Zumba classes are so much better than this.,1394150400,11,620,4.048780487804878
6155544,4,B00HDXPIV8,"So why did I give it 4 stars instead of 5?
Let me start with the good:
1.  The Super Cardio Dance Party featuring Cardio Burst Intervals I would give 10 stars if I could. It was that awesome! Want to sweat to some awesome music and burn tons of calories? This was GREAT! It was so awesome it could not possibly be improved. The instructors were fantastic and the music was fantastic. Did I impress enough how incredible this disc was?

2. Zumba Max Beto's maximum calorie burn. I would also give it at least 5 stars, probably 6 if allowed. I really like the music and the dancer's energy really contributed to the motivation of the DVD. Fantastic.

3. 30 Minute Burn + Amazing Abs. 30 minute burn I would give 5+ stars. It was filmed in a warehouse with a crowd of Zumba enthusiasts. Very nice 30 minute workout. Amazing Abs I would give a 2, but maybe this is just my own personal feelings--I just don't like working out my abs in a chair. It seemed to hurt my back (I have lower back problems). I'd rather see Beto do a standing Ab/mat ab workout, but again, this is just my personal preference. If you like working out your abs in a chair, you'll like this DVD.

4. Zumba step I would give 3 stars. Beto seems a little subdued, and the step seems like a gimmick. While I will work out to this DVD in the future, I was a little disappointed. Plus, you need a lot of room to do this workout! I have a large basement workout room so I was OK, but I can't imagine trying to work out to this DVD in a small space!

5. This is why I have to give the set a 4 star--the 20 minute express was defective. When I emailed Zumba directly about this defective DVD, they would not replace it. Since it was part of a full set, I didn't want to send everything back and I thought they could just send me a replacement DVD and they would not. I am disappointed in ZUMBA's customer service!

If not for the defective DVD and Zumba's refusal to replace the one DVD, I would give this set 5 stars. The Super Cardio dance party and the Zumba max by themselves are worth the money. I hope Zumba can keep pumping out these great dance workouts!",1394150400,63,2123,4.1658536585365855

I have tried just about all of them, and so far my favorite is the Max Calorie Burn - super fun workout!  The quality of these exercise DVDs is unparalleled.  I love that you can do them with or without the voiceovers.  They are very easy to follow and a fantastic workout!  Great for winter when you don't want to leave to go to the gym!
