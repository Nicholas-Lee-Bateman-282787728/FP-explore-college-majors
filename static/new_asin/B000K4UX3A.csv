2682355,4,B000K4UX3A,"Jack Benny movies are usually hard to find, so I was happy about finding this one!  It is probably his first movie.  He plays a rascally medicine show man who falls for a small town girl.  To the girl, who lives a harsh life with a cranky father, Jack is glamorous.  Jack rescues her from being married off to an old crony of her father.  Just when you think Jack will be a cad, he steps up and does the right thing!",1388361600,,416,4.024390243902439

2682357,2,B000K4UX3A,Nice funny movie.  The quality of it was poor being that it is classic 1930.  The still of the frames kept on running up in some spots.  Other than that I enjoyed it very much.,1358899200,2,176,3.9714285714285715
2682358,1,B000K4UX3A,"Jack Benny is one of my favorite comedians. It's about a traveling medicine show that dealt a bad dose of medicine for the viewer.
*The acting was so bad that I had to quit viewing it. The monologue was stiff and I noticed that when an actor was about to say a line, they would look directly at the camera before they faced the actor they were about to recite the monologue to.
*If your time has no value, then by all means purchase it. It's not worth the shipping and handling charges. This movie was one of a 50 pack Family Classics DVD movie collection.",1212796800,12,556,4.254716981132075

8154286,4,B000K4UX3A,"As of this writing, Amazon Prime has two different releases of this movie for streaming.  I watched about 20 minutes of both the Synergy version and the Film Detective version.  The picture quality is not great on either but I think the Film Detective release is a little better.  The sound quality of the Synergy version is definitely scratchy.  I recommend watching the Film Detectve version of this 1930 Jack Benny movie.  This is one of Benny's early movies, his first being The Hollywood Revue of 1929.  His performance in this movie is not up to his later, more polished, standard, but the movie is still entertaining for Jack Benny fans.",1477526400,,644,4.756756756756757

8154293,2,B000K4UX3A,"The Medicine Man, 1930 film

A Victrola plays music for a girl and her brother. Dont play that music says their father. [Note their clothes.] A man enters their store to buy sugar. There is a parade outside. I don't like that fellow. People watch the parade [advertising, like on TV today]. Dr. John Harvey visits to buy candy. There you are. [Does this conversation seem too corny?] Is this Medicine Show on the level? [Note the unpaved street and horses.] Hilda visits to see Dr. Harvey but is sent away. The girl and her brother are allowed to visit the Medicine Show, but avoid show people. [Still good advice today?] Did Buddy break that record? He will be punished. Peter Schultz visits, he is interested in Mimi as a wife. Mimi slips out the back way to visit the Medicine Show.

Two men sing to entertain the audience. Dr. Harvey speaks about health. He has a tonic and blood purifier that is good for what ails you. It came from an old Pawnee medicine. Only $1 a bottle. [Watch how they make change for a twenty.] Next is a product for women to help their complexion. Mimi is used as a model. Someone tells her father! Pa uses the belt on her. Next hell go after those show people. Can they be run out or town or put in jail? Dr. Harvey gave silk stockings to Mimi. A gambler shows his game to lure players into losing [sleight of hand]. Two women see Mimi with Dr. Harvey; they go back to town. Ill always remember you. Buddy takes the blame for leaving the back door open! Dont lie to me! A woman tells Mr. Gold about Mimi being out late at night with Dr. Harvey. Mr. Gold calls Peter Schultz about a marriage. Mimi goes to ask Dr. Harvey to take her away with her brother Buddy.

The players who lost complain to the lawman. If they swear out a warrant against that card dealer theyll be arrested. A young boy warns them. [Note those wooden sidewalks.] The Medicine Show is leaving town without them. There is conflict in Golds store. Harvey marries Mimi in her fathers store. Mr. Gold gets his pistol to chase after the newlyweds. Gus tries to stop him, there is a struggle and a shot! The JP says it was suicide! The Sheriff plays with the gambler for money and wins. The other bettors get their money back. Harvey drives of with Mimi and Buddy. Will they live happily ever?

The three card monte game has long had a reputation for crookedness (like the three shell game). It works because of the greed of the players who thing they can win against a skilled gambler! This same outlook is used to sell lottery tickets to people who don't know the odds are against them. Traveling carnivals died out in the 1950s, or so. Federal laws banned many patent medicines. Were they the equivalent of todays energy drinks? You can TV (or the Internet) for their modern equivalents.",1397520000,,2785,4.423001949317738
