1706088,5,B0000646UC,"In this compilation of amateur color movies from within the Third Reich, we are presented with a unique perspective from ground level. In addition to scenes from battlefields, we see folk events of the pre-war years, and Germans at play and leisure. Even an important event such as a military demonstration in Berlin for the benefit of Mussolini is seen as you or I would have glimpsed it, from the third or fourth row, thus adding to the sense of reality....It is a time-honored cliche to say that the Germans of those years loved to march, and here is the proof: In one absolute dark gem of a scene (I think it is at a ceremony of a civilian ""rifle club""), we see a group of 50-ish men in a line trying to do a goose-step -
  The narration consists mostly of giving us the identities of the amateur filmmakers at each event and some general historical commentary. My only objection is that it too often falls into self-congratulatory exclamations of the uniqueness of the color films, how they were discovered only a couple years ago, etc. These are remarks that I would have preferred to read in booklet notes (of which there are none)...I'd rather have the narrator talk entirely about the contents of the documentary, rather than the documentary itself. But since this sole objection is not worth so much as half a star in relation to the scope of the work, I have no problem in giving it five stars.
  One last note: although no mention is made in the credits to the background music, it is fascinating, and an important element. The melodies sound like popular music of the day, Nazi martial music, and some minor-mode themes of haunting beauty. Some of these motifs are repeated in a way that unifies the work without being overdone and annoying (as I found to be the case, for example, in Ken Burns' pitiless over-repetition of ""Ashokan Farewell"" [the violin solo] in his Civil War documentary).
  THIS is an eye-opening and engrossing work.",1039996800,119,1950,4.65406976744186

7960496,5,B0000646UC,"This DVD is a must for anyone who strives for for some kind of grip on this extremely disturbing era. The color is important in helping one get a feel for the environment. Nazism is not just about afew evil men, it's also about all these all too normal people, these extraordinarily ordinary people who can be seen revelling in their colorful folk dress and their charming villages. This collection doesn't offer solutions because I don't think there are any conclusive ones at the moment. But you do get to see a great deal of compelling imagery providing food for thought and a real sense of being there. One segment in particular, ""Night of the Amazons"" is indescribable, it must be seen to be believed. Volume Two concentrates more on combat footage but for those who are are more interested in the common folk, this is a real gem.",1205366400,7,835,4.610738255033557
7960497,5,B0000646UC,"Like other reviewers, I think the sequel is better than the original.  One only hopes that a 3rd installment will be issued with even better footage than the first two, especially if more 35mm films are found.  Color adds a lot to the drama and presentation, mixing the horror of war and the death camps with pompous Nazi celebrations.  Seeing these period films, it's hard to believe the Nazis were members of the human race.

Nowadays, top college football players to be drafted by the National Football League have to take a test of basic intelligence, the Wonderlic test.  A score of 30, out of a possible 50, is considered a good score.  Hitler and the other top Nazis would have been lucky to score a 10 on this test, because they simply couldn't count.  What else could possibly explain attacking Russia and declaring war on America? At the same time, leaving Great Britain unconquered, and available later for a Western Front.  The Nazis were outnumbered and had no chance to win, in the long run.  For all their self-proclaimed superiority, these guys were simply not that smart.

Another thing that strikes me, especially in seeing atomic bombs exploding over Japan, is how incredibly lucky the Germans were.  Hitler launched his last western counteroffensive in December, 1944. This was the ""Battle of the Bulge,"" in American terms.  If he had succeeded, World War II could have been stretched out 3 months or more.  If that had happened, atomic bombs may have and probably would have been used on Nazi Germany.  Thank heaven that didn't happen but it could have.

Excellent DVD's like this one should make us all appreciate what we have today, despite current happenings in the Middle East and elsewhere.  There's a lot of kindness and decency to be seen around us, things that were in short supply 60-70 years ago.  In 1940-45, the world stood on the brink of total destruction and we found a way out.  Let's hope and believe good will triumph over evil again.",1143331200,11,1973,4.752941176470588
7960498,2,B0000646UC,"The problem is they put in a lot of footage that is NOT of the Third Reich; such as, of Japan, England, America, etc. etc....

It was sort of like they did not have enough real footage, so they threw in a lot of off-topic stuff as filler.

Its OK, but not truely what it pretends to be.  As for the on-topic footage it has, it was great.",1140825600,33,337,3.926470588235294
7960499,4,B0000646UC,"The color film from the 1930's is of surprisingly good quality and the segments showing life in Germany at this time are quite interesting. An added bonus in the Special Features is a short promotional for Berlin from 1936 - in preparation for the summer Olympics held there that year.  Beautiful.  War related footage is good and most I had not seen before in 20+ years of collecting color video from WWII.  The minus, in my opinion, is the mournful, tragic tone of the British narration and funereal-sounding background music which cycles maddeningly over and over.  Subtly insulting to anyone who is knowledgeable about this period in history.",1129161600,18,646,4.953703703703703
7960500,5,B0000646UC,The real treasure of documentary footage. Thanks digital technology for possibility to have it remastered with maximum available quality.,1127433600,7,137,6.2631578947368425
7960501,3,B0000646UC,"This film is largely a vignette, in the style of home movies, of scenes in the lives of Germans during the Nazi period. It is a remarkable glimpse into the past. You see an ordinary, generally good natured people doing ordinary things. Yet in the background you see the pervasive organizing principle of the Nazi movement: the swastika is everywhere, the uniforms, the marches, the rallies. You sense the Germans willingly put all their eggs in Hitler's basket and he was the Fuehrer, for better or worse.

I'm grateful for the unguarded candid glimpses into the past. Some are awesome. Some are awful. It's a great movie if you are interested in the period.",1111795200,13,658,4.771929824561403
7960502,1,B0000646UC,"I bought this DVD based on the Amazon on-line reviews. I'm not certain if the reviewers are put ups or not, but when they say how great the quality is on this film I really wonder if they've watched the same program I did. The quality is awful!
Come on reviewers help out a little. If this is what you consider great quality, what do you consider bad? Not worth $29.95. More like $2.95. NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!",1068595200,48,410,4.269230769230769
7960503,4,B0000646UC,"This DVD contains some interesting and new color material from the Nazi era. Initially I was skeptical in purchasing this, and assumed it would just trot out the same old Eva Braun home movies we've seen a million times. But wait... there is actually new film here, some of it recently discovered and airing here for the first time. Much of it was taken by soldiers at the front. There is some especially interesting footage taken during Barbarossa in the Russian campaign. There are also segments taken on the Western front in the 1940 campaign which have only recently been unearthed. Seeing these things in color makes everything appear more immediate and contemporary.
A small weakness is that there is not much actual color footage included of Hitler, Goebbels, Goering or the other Nazi henchman. They spend an inordinate time on a 1939 exhibition at Munich's Haus der Deutschen Kunst, where Hitler and the gang arrives and sits on a dais, watching a Wagernian-motive parade. There's also some nice scenes of a Bueckeburg farm fesitival in 1936, with Hitler walking up a hill with a limping Goebbels at his side. This has been seen before, however, most notably in the British production from 1972, ""The World at War."" Another weakness is the narration, which doesn't provide much actual information and doesn't tell the viewer what year the footage was made.
I recommend this film which will intrigue most people interested in WWII or the Third Reich.",1058054400,142,1458,4.930894308943089
