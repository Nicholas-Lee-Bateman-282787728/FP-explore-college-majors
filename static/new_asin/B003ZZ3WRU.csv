8411341,4,B003ZZ3WRU,"This movie is a little old (1980s), with the first indicator being the clothes, but it is interesting.  It is a training film for the DOD, and looks like it was shot on a base. I show it to my entry level forensics and criminal investigation college students to show them the process of investigation and autopsy.  The second part of the movie is interesting to see what different types of wounds look like on actual bodies.  Not the best movie, but very interesting for the price.",1295654400,,481,4.505747126436781
