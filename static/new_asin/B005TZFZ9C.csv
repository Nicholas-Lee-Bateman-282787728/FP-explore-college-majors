4892789,5,B005TZFZ9C,"great show with likeable characters.  It is well written with the bidding part and then the appraisal part.

Of all the reality shows I feel this is the best one for average people that would like to watch a show about average people trying to make it.

This has half of season 2.  About 14 episodes.

Dave Hester drives me crazy but I love this show.
WE watched it all in about 1 night",1341878400,2,101,3.857142857142857
4892791,4,B005TZFZ9C,"Just a warning to you that this package only has the first 14 ep. The other half will be release later on.

This show is back and it's better than last season. Everyone has returned for more and better storage units.

For the new season, the show tried to introduce a new character, Mark. He is only in there for a few shows, but he made a statement. He is this really big/strong looking guy that has millions. He loves to push out the other characters from an auction with his money. If he wants it, there's no unit he would not buy.  This makes him a very dangerous buyer to all the other buyers. The other characters think they can make him lose out on many units by bidding higher and making him really pay for them, but Mark seems like he just doesn't care if he does. To him, its like a game that he must win. He is not living on storage unit to storage unit like the others are. Mark does this as a hobby and not a real job.

Some other things to say for this season. Barry is the only one that can get along with every person on the show. There's just something about him that doesn't get on peoples nerves as the other characters hate everyone else there. I think it's because he's not there so much to make it rich as compared to the others and he keeps a lot of stuff. Also, he tends to give away his stuff he finds. Finally, he doesn't bid too hard on the people bids. Everyone just got to love this guy! You can't go wrong with a guy that makes you laugh and likes to give stuff out for free!",1338940800,7,1505,4.057239057239057
4892792,5,B005TZFZ9C,"Volume 2 of Storage Wars (aka: half of Season 2) is just as great as Season 1, filled with much of the same kinds of drama. There's the same fighting (some a bit more intense than before), rare finds, messy storage units and Barry showing up with all kinds of funny people.

Darrell seems to spend most of all these episodes on the sidelines, not bidding on much. But he's always there to partake in the bidding drama. Jarrod and his wife have obviously been having good business in their store after Season 1, since they appear to have quite a bit more spending money to buy units in Season 2. They are definitely much more of a contender in this season than they were in the last, often outbidding the king of the Storage Wars, Dave. There are lots of appearances by the familiar appraisers, each helping put a value on the odd and rare items that are found in the units.

As noted by others, this ""Volume 2"" is only part of the second season. I suspect Volume 3 (when released) will be the other half of the second season, which may very well confuse some buyers. I can see people looking to buy Season 3, buying Volume 3 and being disappointed when they discover it's the second half to Season 2. So just be sure to check and see what volume you're buying has the episodes your looking for.",1337904000,,1294,4.3429752066115705

4892795,5,B005TZFZ9C,"While I agree that it would be a good thing if more episodes were on this volume, I will review what IS here and not what isn't here.
The 14 episodes that are here are very entertaining and enjoyable. I think the key to this show's success is the interesting characters. I saw a copycat show on another network dealing with buyers bidding on storage lockers and it was really bad. This show uses the framework of the storage lockers to present Barry's offbeat and funny humor,Dave and Darrell's childish and petty arguements and Brandi and Jarrod's struggles to break into the business. They'll show some interesting antiques and novelties as well but the real winning formula is the interactions of the characters.
Even the Texas version of the show made by the same producers and network isn't as good as their characters aren't as entertaining. This is the original Storage Locker show and I suspect it'd be a good show if you had these characters exploring caves  or commenting on baseball games or travelling to exotic places. A 5 star show.",1330732800,2,1046,4.747252747252747

4892829,4,B005TZFZ9C,"This is the 2nd DVD of Storage Wars that I have purchased from Amazon.com. The show itself didn't disappoint and I enjoyed watching it as much as I did the first season DVD I got a while back. However, and this isn't Amazon's fault at all, I dislike the way that A&E is marketing their shows that come out on DVD. I get so confused as to which episodes I have seen and which of the DVDs I already have since they are selling them as ""collections"" instead of seasons. Putting basically half of a season, or 16 episodes, which seems to be the norm for them, on 2 disks and selling it as half a season is not how I like to buy the shows. I would rather buy them as whole seasons so that I know for sure what I am getting and what I already have.

As for the shipping, it took a while for me to get the DVD probably due to the fact that I chose the free Super Saver shipping. Every time I chose this shipping option it seems to take a while to get me and the package goes out of the way before it comes to my local post office. From now on I may just pay the little extra to get my items quicker. Great show though! I love all of the characters, especially Barry. Me and my fiance crack up over him, especially when they play the special elevator music every time they show him...lol.",1363132800,,1280,4.019607843137255

4892833,5,B005TZFZ9C,I like this one like the first season. Very interesting and educational. I like when they throw in the wow and if factor.
