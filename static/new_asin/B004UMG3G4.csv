8441837,5,B004UMG3G4,"What a journey!  This Grand Tetons video by Bike-O-Vision is visually amazing and does everything for me that its supposed to.  That is to say it takes the tedium out of exercising which allows me to get an excellent, long workout on my stationary bike.  I usually watch this one the day after the #9 Yellowstone video which is how I saw those places when I visited in person.
 The scenery really is POSTCARD-PERFECT.  It really puts you there!  Theres the real wildlife like a moose, big deer (and maybe those were antelopes?) and others, but I have to say those stunning mountain views are the most unforgettable aspect.  Ive given this as a gift to my friends before and they loved it.  Cheers to Bike-O-Vision!",1497830400,,714,4.611111111111111
