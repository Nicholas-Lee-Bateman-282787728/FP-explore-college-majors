7155072,5,B00WXXATWQ,"I saw this at South By Southwest in Austin, TX in March 2014 & thought it was the best film at the festival.  I recommend it.",1433289600,,125,3.8076923076923075
7155073,4,B00WXXATWQ,Fascinating look at the life and career of one of the most recognizable character actors working in film.,1433116800,,105,4.888888888888889
7155074,5,B00WXXATWQ,"It is a fascinating look at a working actor named Dick Miller who seems to pop up all over the movie landscape.
His career is strongly linked to Roger Corman the King of the B Movies. Roger started using Dick in most of his movies and later when young film fanatics grew up and secured jobs with Roger they carried on the Dick Miller tradition. Wonderful interviews with Roger Corman,
directors Joe Dante and Allan Arkush, editors Kent Beyda and Marshall Harvey and many other filmmakers are peppered throughout
scenes of Dick's numerous movies. And of course Dick and his lovely and insightful wife of over forty years provide the spine of the interviews. This is a very entertaining and informative documentary.",1471824000,,713,4.852459016393443
7155075,4,B00WXXATWQ,"Enlightening documentary about one of those actors everybody knows, but nobody knows...if you know what I mean. The guy was always a good actor, but really shined when compared to other cast members in what were typically low-budget films. Can't recall a part he did a bad job on, but I probably haven't seen many of them, as it seems he was in every other film ever made.

The movie shows a lot of his history, and what he faced due to that history. It's a shame he was discounted for casting merely due to previous films he was in, even though he was so good.",1470787200,,561,4.2924528301886795
7155076,5,B00WXXATWQ,"Was a lot of fun, and moved fast and furious.  Fun documentary on an interesting time ...",1470787200,,89,4.235294117647059
7155077,5,B00WXXATWQ,Dick Miller has appeared so many Corman and other films you almost don't know which he's not in. Apply titled.,1468540800,,110,4.55

7155080,4,B00WXXATWQ,"a very fun documentary,especially if you're at least somewhat familiar with the films of roger corman and his proteges.",1463011200,,119,5.315789473684211
7155081,4,B00WXXATWQ,"Great flick for those obsessed B-movie fans out there! Some good funny moments, lots of insightful interview clips with folks like Mary Woronov, Joe Dante, and Roger Corman.  There are awesome clips from Dick's movies but it's also a celebration of his 50 year love affair with his beautiful wife as well. He's a lovable curmudgeon, the little guy who kept pounding away to put food on the table. Enjoy some Dick!",1459296000,,413,4.736111111111111
7155082,5,B00WXXATWQ,"This is a great documentary about one of the most underrated actors of the modern screen.  More than a utility actor, Dick Miller is a treasure who possesses a range on the level of a Robert DeNiro/Jack Nicholson.  Excellent documentary suited to the man.",1456704000,,255,4.7727272727272725
7155083,4,B00WXXATWQ,"For a low budget indie doc, this entertaining story about the long and storied career of a Hollywood icon is well worth viewing. Anyone who is a movie lover will be captivated by the many familiar faces who explain their experiences in working with this veteran of the film industry. Unless you grew up in a bubble, you likely saw Dick Miller in a movie although you didn't know it as was the case with me. His friends and family also share their loving testimonials to a man who has endeared himself to anyone he has touched onscreen and off.",1456617600,,543,4.44

7155090,3,B00WXXATWQ,"Impressive assembly of industry talking heads survey the long career of solid character actor Dick Miller. It's great to see Miller get recognition but the film almost wears out its welcome by the sheer number of film clips that, after a while, don't add any new insights or revelations about this talented, hard-working actor. Still worth your time, though.",1444953600,,358,5.084745762711864

8714530,3,B00WXXATWQ,"Very much enjoyed the movie; character actors are the backbone of Hollywood who rarely get the credit they deserve, and Dick is the king of them (also just a flat-out interesting and entertaining guy).  Glad he finally got his day in the sun.
Be aware the Blu-Ray doesn't contain any of the special features listed on the standard dvd; found out the hard way when ordered the cheaper Blu-Ray (Amazon was gracious about refunding though).",1512691200,,437,4.826666666666667
8714531,5,B00WXXATWQ,"This is a terrific documentary , I'm writing this to alert possible BLU RAY purchasers that it not only is a ""burned"" Blu Ray but sadly has NONE of the extensive bonus features found on the DVD that has been out for some time. I can also say that the blu ray doesn't seem like an upgrade in terms of quality of image.  There is a new edition coming out in Germany that has blu ray and DVD and many extra goodies... I've ordered one from ebay and I'm hopeful it will be the ultimate version of a film I've watched half a dozen times and never grow tired of!",1496707200,2,556,4.054545454545455
8714532,5,B00WXXATWQ,"A lot of moviegoers don't realize how much the contribution of excellent character actors mean to a film's success. Modern films seldom have great actors like Dick Miller. A character actor who should've at least gone on to be a gumshoe detective in his own series. The man could act. Loved this homey documentary. It's relaxed. Make some popcorn on a weekend afternoon and enjoy. By the way, Dick's wife was in the Graduate. His wife has the best body I've ever seen on film. Scope out her younger day pictures. (She's also a gorgeous older woman.) But her body is amazing. She and Dick have a sweet marriage with one liners zinging between them--and a nice loving sizzle.) Love you Dick Miller wherever you are. You gave me and thousands upon thousands of moviegoers so much pleasure. Whenever you were on screen, I perked up and paid attention.",1496448000,2,847,4.691275167785235
8714533,5,B00WXXATWQ,"I don't usually watch this type of picture/film/video... but I must say well done!  Having grown up watching many of Dicks'  performances on creature features and seeing him through out my life, it was very good. I would recommend this as an opportunity to see how best to grind out a great career.",1495929600,,298,4.60377358490566
