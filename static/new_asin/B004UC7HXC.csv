8441411,1,B004UC7HXC,"Not actually great for exercise or being erotic. Rather, it extracts money from the pockets of curious fitness minded folks. So effective for its purpose, I guess.",1507593600,,163,5.074074074074074
8441412,5,B004UC7HXC,"I absolutely love this series. Much more to this than the name. I originally purchased the series after using one of the programs, sexy stretch, via on demand from cable. When they discontinued the series on cable, I found it and purchased it. Then in a recent move the DVD was lost and so was I. I repurchased this DVD because I did not want to live without it.",1490572800,,362,4.260869565217392

8441414,5,B004UC7HXC,I had a free trial of this video on Comcast a few of years ago. I am so happy I FINALLY found the actual video. LOVE IT.  The shipping was quick and the product came new in package as promised.,1431043200,,193,3.825

8441417,3,B004UC7HXC,"I always start with a positive and that is certainly, the instructor (Cat), who is likable and her cues are easy to follow.  Also, confession, I have only done the Sexy Stretch, thinking it would be a good way to increase flexibility and well stretch, after other hard works out. Cat does a great job of ensuring she focuses on areas that often times we miss in stretching and overall, this 20 minute series is relatively enjoyable (if you are looking only for stretch and a low key workout).  However, just my personal opinion, it was a little odd for the several references to L.A. and how sexy LA is, when the purpose of a workout is well, to workout. More odd, was the fact that one of the members of the cast continued to attempt to look even ""sexier,"" which unlike the other cast members, she looked incredibly unnatural. Overall, if are looking for a workout that is solely stretching and you can ignore some of the oddness or perhaps, it would not be a notice to someone else,  it could be a decent segment. However, I think there are other workouts that are much better.",1387411200,,1079,4.467005076142132
8441418,1,B004UC7HXC,"I loved this workout, it got your heart pumping and made you feel super sexy! But, there was something wrong with the video itself, it would freeze up on so many spots and in the same spots everytime. I called the support team and they acted like it would be fixed but I don't think it ever was, very disappointing.",1346889600,,315,4.266666666666667
8441419,3,B004UC7HXC,"I purchased the 1-week Amazon Instant Video rental. The video and audio quality were great. You're not able to skip to specific workouts in this format that I'm aware of. I'm not in the best of shape, so my experience may vary from yours.

I thought the instructor provided well timed, clear direction. I did get a little annoyed by the amount of times that Los Angeles was mentioned, and I only did these workouts a few times. The moves are pretty basic, so you could probably mute her if it really bothered you.

I wouldn't call this a ""cardio"" workout, I would say it's more focused on flexibility and strength. If you're looking for a challenging workout that will leave you dripping in sweat, or a workout based on erotic dance, this isn't the video for you.

This video contains three 20 minute routines.

In the first routine, you do a simple warm up, a few stretches, and complete a fairly simple burlesque style routine. My knees are pretty terrible, so I had a little difficulty keeping up with the floor moves. I will admit it was fun. I didn't exactly break a sweat, but I also wasn't able to complete all of the moves at the same pace.

The second routine, which I believe was referred to as ""sexy stretch"" was fun for me, I wanted to keep doing it. I wouldn't call it just stretching, and it's not yoga style stretching. Some of the stretches do feel really good, but there are also a few challenging moves in there. This routine seemed to focus on flexibility and strength, which I liked.

In the last segment, you warm up barefoot and then dance around and kick your legs, ""Rockettes"" style kicks in your heels. Some of the girls had sky high stilettos on, another was wearing platform wedges. The end of the routine has you doing a sort of model-walk, and then striking a pose. It seemed a little silly to me, but I laughed and had fun with it. I'm less than confident in stilettos, so I thought that this routine was interesting. I felt like I could walk a little better in my heels afterward, but maybe that was just added confidence after doing all those silly poses.",1337644800,7,2087,4.450261780104712
8441420,2,B004UC7HXC,"This is not a good exercise video.  The alleged 1 hr. ""workout"" only has about 10-15 minutes of cardio with the rest being devoted to stretching exercises.  There is nothing erotic about the exercises other than a small strip-tease style floor move at the very beginning.  The video ends with you putting on 4"" stiletto heels and exercising in them.  Unless you are a very beginner who has never done a workout video before, this is not for you.",1335139200,4,445,4.594936708860759
