8185491,4,B000OKRN1A,Don't you wish you know what others are thinking sometimes? Looks can be very deceiving. Priyanka and Arjun were great!,1389744000,,119,5.0
8185492,1,B000OKRN1A,"WOW! I hope Wolfgang Petersen sued Bollywood's ass off for stealing his movie almost verbatim? Shattered happens to be one of my all time favorite movies and, while a modern day remake would be interesting, for Hindi Films to just plagiarize this is beyond comprehension. This movie isn't a slight resemblance to Shattered or a similar tale...IT IS SHATTERED with a different title, different actors in a foreign language! Even the main characters flashbacks to going through the car windshield in the accident throughout as his own memories fight the false ones his deceptive ""wife/mistress"" have fed him conflict all there. When Tom Behrenger's ""Dan Merrick"" came home from the hospital and smashed the mirror in the master bedroom SO DID HIS COUNTERPART IN THIS ONE! Don't waste your money enabling the crooks that stole this great movie!!!!",1357948800,,844,5.1231884057971016
8185493,3,B000OKRN1A,Plot was a little stale.  It had a lot of potential but fell flat.  Priyanka Chopra was a star though.  Her acting shines in this movie.,1355270400,,136,4.153846153846154
8185494,4,B000OKRN1A,I enjoyed this so much one never knows that to expect as how many Indian/bollywood movies start out.  I keep coming back for more. I would suggest this is one to watch.,1297987200,,168,4.25
8185495,4,B000OKRN1A,"The movie begins with a road accident. A couple have survived the accident but the guy (Arjun Rampal) is badly injured and needs extensive surgery including a facial reconstruction (which miraculously is achieved without any sign of scarring!) He has retrograde amnesia and cant recall his wife (Priyanka Chopra) or anything about his former life.
Wife nurses him back and he falls in love with her again.
Then bits of information come from here and there and he finds he was going to divorce his wife before the accident. No more spoilers. It's about who is telling the truth? what was his past about? etc. There  is a plot twist that isn't entirely unexpected but adds juice to the unfolding mystery.
The movie is reasonably well scripted. As a thriller it has a bit of violence (but not with a lot of gore or over-doing it - more at the level of any murder mystery) and is serious rather than light romantic comedy.
There are a few songs in it which some reviewers seemed to like but I didn't relate to. The female playback singer's (NB if you don't know Bollywood actors mime to professional 'playback singers' voices) voice seems to be too high for Priyanka's usual vocal range and I found that a bit difficult to watch (but I don't relate generally to the traditional female Indian soprano singing style).
Arjun Rampal was good in this and Priyanka fine for her part (though my eye was drawn more to Arjun -  hey I'm female!) . Support actors Kim Sharma and Saurabh Shukla were also good.
I think its a reasonably tight thriller or mystery of the sort Cary Grant made. Arjun is no Cary Grant (e.g doesn't have the nuances Cary did) but he was quite good in this nonetheless.
Anyway as an above average thriller it wasn't a bad way to spend 2 hours.",1234828800,2,1754,4.5474683544303796
