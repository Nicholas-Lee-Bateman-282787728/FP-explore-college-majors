Don't listen to the negative reviews because I'm almost fully certain this was a FREE concert and don't recall paying any money for tickets or any entry fee.  I did a Google search and there is a NYTimes Article that does in fact state "" all Summerstage concerts are free.""  So totally ignore any negative reviews the family was milking money.",1493251200,,418,4.4605263157894735

7884782,2,6305186480,"Do not buy this DVD if you really love Bob Marley. There is no ""magic"" in it.
It is a regular video for a regular party that is so boring to watch and without much music to listen.",1059782400,3,180,3.763157894736842
7884783,1,6305186480,"Boy this stunk. I am a huge fan of reggae and Bob Marley and thought this was a joke. For the most part, I don't think the Marley family has too much musical talent and this is a big showcase of that. Particularly bad are Stephen's ""Rastaman Vibration"" and all the songs by Damien and Julian. Yet another attempt by the Marleys to cash in on Bob's name. Shameful.",1029196800,4,363,4.27536231884058

7884786,1,6305186480,"I think the Marley family needs to listen to Bob interviews and learn that Bob was not looking for quick money and fame, that come to him naturally. Reggae is to educate all people around the world and to bring consciousness  to African about our struggle. And the family is just capitalizing on his  hard work for a quick profit, and forget Bob and the other wailers hard  struggle to be recognize by the international seen hope they will learn and  get back to the roots of the people that has not voice, that Bob intended  the music to speak for.",951609600,7,549,4.396039603960396
