8580267,1,B00CCF7VXA,This is in German.  I didn't want something in German.  Online was very confusing.  All Doris Day movies are the greatest!!!!!,1423267200,,126,4.904761904761905
8580268,4,B00CCF7VXA,"German released 3-disc box set including 'Move Over, Darling' (1963). Debonair James Garner nearly steals the show. 'Move Over, Darling' was actually 2oth Century Fox' rather successful attempt to retrieve their aborted 'Something's Got to Give' (1962) - Marilyn Monroe's final Hollywood project.
Picture quality of both 'Caprice' and 'Move Over, Darling' is very good and will please fans of these films especially the colorful imagery which Looney Tunes veteran Frank Tashlin created for 'Caprice' (well, the year is 1967...)
""Informed in 2011 by a film historian that this film had found new favor among film school students admiring the picture's eclectic mix of satire, slapstick and action, Doris Day admitted she hadn't watched the movie in decades and may have to give it a second look."" (imdb.com)

Amazing as it may be that these BD releases arrive courtesy of HanseSound - Musik und Film / Carol Media (Germany), it's great to be able to check yet another 2 titles of my personal Blu-ray 'Wanted' catalog (please visit my Listmania lists).
As for the third title in this package 'Do not Disturb' (1965), my own feeling is that this neither is one of Doris Day's better movies nor a Blu-ray disc that will set future standards.

Excellent PQ, Mono Audio in German & English but NO Subtitles.  Enjoy!!!!!!",1378512000,10,160,4.129032258064516
8580270,5,B00CCF7VXA,"I have been waiting quite anxiously for these three films to be released on Blu Ray. This is a German release and it does state Region A1. Will it play in the USA? Has anyone purchased it? Would appreciate any information on format as I am quite anxious to buy this set. Move Over Darling is one of Doris Day's funniest comedies. She works very well with James Garner and her Adam and Eve scene with Chuck Connors is a must for any Doris fan. She looks fantastic in her fig leaf bikini!!!! Do Not Disturb and Caprice are very underrated films. Doris makes them both special and rises above the weak material. She is a fine comedienne and does wonderful slapstick comedy in both these films. Despite the bad reviews, she does work well with Rod Taylor and Richard Harris. Again, anyone who loves Doris Day must have these three films. Please, someone answer me as to whether the correct format info is listed and if they are playable on USA blu ray players.",1376524800,5,956,4.468571428571429
