4375829,1,B004HO6I4M,"Once again, I have wasted money on a DVD that proclaims that is going to show me the hottest Brazilian women. This was the biggest waste of them all.

What this is, essentially, is a documentary with some really bad footage of a beach and a parade that may or may not be Carnaval. For whatever reason the cameras pick out, seemingly, the least-attractive half-naked women who are at each venue. Spliced in with this footage (the same portions of which are used more than once) are subtitled interviews with some of the ugliest Brazilian women I've ever seen, a couple of whom get naked in their rooms and show us more of themselves than we wanted to see.

I guess if you like really homely, really really dark Brazilian women (nothing like the ones on the cover), you might like this. But if you're the average soft-core viewer, you're going to be mad that you wasted your time. I actually fast forwarded through the last half and I never do that.",1246838400,3,947,4.5

4375858,4,B004HO6I4M,"Truly a family movie.  I just felt a little sad watching the story.  There were two main themes that depressed me.  The extinction of a species because two animals will not revive a species from extinction.  The other was that the bird did not fly.  I am a lover of companion birds and as a previous owner, I learned that flight is extremely important to the health of a bird.  Birds that do not fly a little every day tend to be fat and depressed.  This leads to premature death or illness.  Even with the flight feathers trimmed they can still fly in a manner.  So if you are or have been a companion bird owner and lover I think you will find this movie a little sad.  I feel that the writers did not intend to make a sad movie so I can't give it a five.  Otherwise, the film was striking visually well written and directed and the voices were wonderful.  Truly something for everyone in the family.to enjoy.",1513900800,,911,4.2631578947368425

Better than Rio2",1504483200,,92,5.133333333333334
4375895,4,B004HO6I4M,"While Blue Sky studios is nowhere near as well-known or renowned for their animated films as giants like Pixar and DreamWorks, they've still proven that they're pretty good at what they do best -- making lively and entertaining animated films for kids.  Best known for the ""Ice Age"" movies, they've also tackled other subjects with varying degrees of success -- ""Robots,"" ""Epic,"" ""Horton Hears a Who,"" and ""The Peanuts Movie.""  And while their work may not be as groundbreaking as that of the previously-mentioned studios, they've at least produced entertaining fare.  And while I wasn't expecting fantastic things from ""Rio,"" I at least figured it would be fun and cute, and good for laughs.

In that respect, I wasn't disappointed -- ""Rio"" isn't the greatest animated film of all time, but it's definitely cute and entertaining.  And watching it with a relative who's actually lived in Brazil was unexpectedly enlightening, and showed just how much work the animators and writers put in to making this movie accurate.

The star of ""Rio"" is Blue, a sheltered parrot living in a Minnesota bookstore with his owner, Linda.  When Brazilian ornithologist Tulio spots Blue and recognizes him as one of the last of his kind, he arranges for both bird and owner to pay a visit to his research center in Rio de Janeiro, where he hopes Blue will hit it off with Jewel, a spirited female of his own species.  But their visit takes a wild turn when Blue and Jewel are snatched by bird smugglers, and their efforts to escape land them in the wild!  With a little help from a suave toucan, a bumbling but well-meaning cardinal, a smooth-talking escaped canary, and a slobbering bulldog, Blue sets out to find his owner and return home... but Jewel intends to show him just how wonderful freedom can be.  And there's those bird smugglers, aided by a vengeful cockatoo with a sadistic streak, still to contend with...

The movie's plot wanders a fair bit and is fairly predictable, as you might have guessed, but it takes a back seat to the visuals and comedy.  And the visuals are actually quite gorgeous -- Rio de Janeiro looks fantastic, and from the look of things the animators actually got a lot of details right in depicting the streets, beaches, jungles, and wildlife of Brazil.  And the animation of the birds is quite fluid, capturing actual mannerisms and details while still maintaining enough human-like mannerisms to get their emotions and actions across to a younger audience.  This is a vividly colorful movie, one that should appeal to kids and is quite pleasing for adults to look at as well.

The characters aren't especially memorable, but are still fun to get to know.  Blue (played by Jesse Eisenberg) is an unexpectedly neurotic bird who's clearly out of his element in Rio, but he sees steady character development as the movie progresses.  His newfound friends and sidekicks add plenty of comic relief as well, and are aided by fairly well-known and decent voice actors (George Lopez, Jamie Foxx, and rapper Will.i.am).  Jewel (Anne Hathaway) is sadly the cliche of ""every feisty and independent female lead ever,"" without much else to distinguish herself, and I personally felt that the bulldog character (Tracy Morgan) was an unnecessary addition to the cast.  As for the villain, Nigel the cockatoo... if you liked Jemaine Clement as Tamatoa the crab from ""Moana,"" you'll love his performance here.  He hams it up to a memorable degree, playing a villain who's cartoonishly evil but playing him with such relish that it's hard not to have as much fun as I'm sure Clement did in the recording studio.

While a predictable and somewhat cliche film, ""Rio"" is still a funny, cute, and colorful ride, and both kids and adults should be entertained by it.  It's not especially memorable, but at the same time it's entertaining, beautifully animated, and guaranteed to get some laughs out of most audiences.  And sometimes, that's all you're looking for in a film.",1504137600,,3971,4.876488095238095

Right after the blue bird is taken
It tells you they are no longer in rio
no real name of the new location
Just not rio? Are you serious?
He gets treated like a king by having coco and cookies.... Hes a bird, not a human
As well as other lame jokes and scenes as if kids cant understand
The ""bird expert"" is a total nut job
There is a scene involving dangerous power tools that no kid should witness even on screen  as its pretty violent and graphic if you think about it
making up violent jokes is not ok
""Bite thier heads off"" really?
A adult male
A dog dressing up silly is not funny
Its painful and disgusting
Doesnt want to mate and save hes species
and of course it has the troubled relationship cliche
what animal would refuse that? None
How did they confuse a bat for a bird and keep him?

And for a place with such a rich culture, the first scenes in Rio are filled with white people. The first ethnic characters are a pair of birds, one a foil, the other, a fool. The first ethnic people: bad-guys. Oh wait, one of them is a kid and he's good. The reward for his redemption? He get's to live with the white people!

4376832,4,B004HO6I4M,"Rio has been a huge success story for the folks at Twentieth
Century Fox Home Entertainment.  Upon its DVD and Blu-ray
release, the title quickly soared #1 where it held that position
for a total of 4 weeks.

I am a little late to the Rio party.  I had not seen this film
theatrically, and for the most part, had little interest in seeing
this film, that is, until I began to notice how well the Blu-ray
was selling.  With curiosity getting the best of me, I finally
obtained a copy on 3D Blu-ray to see what all the fuss was about.

Blu (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg) is a young macaw who is
captured in the wild and then rescued by a girl named  Linda
(voiced by Leslie Mann). For the years that follow, Blu becomes
Linda's most adoring pet, who is provided with all the comforts of
a perfect home.  Their world is turned askew when an ornithologist
named Tulio (voiced by Rodrigo Snatoro) convinces her to take Blu
to Brazil as the macaw is believed to the last male of his species.

Once in Rio, Blu is introduced to Jewel (voiced by Anne Hathaway),
his impending mate.  However, the female macaw is more concerned
about escaping than mating, and soon after they both break free, the
two suddenly find themselves kidnapped by bird thieves and at the
mercy of a villainous sulfur-crested cockatoo named Nigel (voiced
by Jermaine Clement).

Rio is directed by Carlos Sadanha, the Brazilian-born director who
worked on other titles such as the Ice Age Trilogy and Robots. Its
computer-generated character animation comes courtesy of the folks
at Blu Sky Studios, a unit of Fox Film Entertainment.

For the most part, Rio remains a very upbeat, well-animated film
that is certain to entertain children.  For adults like myself, however,
I found the film excelling in colorful animation, but yet basically bland.
There's nothing charming here.  The music is unmemorable.  There is
no humor to be found, and quite frankly, the characters come off as
being more annoying than remotely likable.  With all the box-office
and home entertainment revenue this film has taken in this year, I
wonder if anyone will actually fondly remember it in years to come.

The transfer is probably the one thing about this movie audiences
will remember.  It's terrific, thanks in all to its vibrant color palette.
This has got to be the most colorful animated movie ever released,
and even without the 3D (which I think probably diminishes some of
it), the colors pop-out on their own thanks to a tact-sharp transfer that
is free of any artifacts.  Black levels are fantastically deep.

The 3D, for the most part, is quite good, though not consistent.  There
one or two scenes where the level of depth feels more 2D than 3D.  However,
when the film does open up dimensionally, it's rather impressive.  Take
for instance the hand glider scene that swoops around the statue of
Christ in Rio de Janeiro, or a Carnival parade that looks completely
stunning with its depth, lighting and colors.  The film doesn't go overboard
with throwing effects at its viewers, but I think I lost count as to how
many times a beak came poking out of the screen towards me.  A
very brief shot of the two macaws getting caught in a volleyball net
that jettisons out towards the viewer is really neat to see.  Other cool
animated enhancements involve falling feathers, flower petals and
confetti that produce more subtle, but satisfying 3D enjoyment.

The transfer remains totally free of ghosting, that is, until 3/4 of the
way through when suddenly it was if someone turned the ""ghosting""
switch on and it became a noticeable presence for the rest of the film.
It begins at the moment Fernando brings (voiced by Jake T. Austin)
brings Linda and Tulio to the shack hideout.  It becomes even more
prevalent shortly thereafter when Jewel are freed of their chained bond.
When Jewel races to the sky and flies with her friends Nico and Pedro,
crosstalk becomes clearly evident, and moving forward with the scenes
that follow, I couldn't help but noticing it many more times.

The film's 5.1 DTS Master Audio soundtrack is very involving, with the
back channels making excellent usage of surrounds that create spatial
ambiance of being in a jungle or city.  The soundtrack is well-balanced,
very rich in dynamics and LFE response is quite authoritative, particularly
in the dancing monkeys sequence and musical numbers involving beating
kettle drums.

Rio arrives in a 4-disc combo pack that includes 3D and 2D versions
of the film, as well as DVD and Digital Copy. The 3D disc includes the
Ice-age short, Scrat's Continental Crack-up (in 3D) as well as 3D trailers
for Gulliver's Travels and The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the
Dawn Treader. The 2D Blu-ray includes a wealth of ""making-of"" featurettes,
a deleted scene, and a few music videos.

Beautifully animated and with what might be the most colorful transfer
on Blu-ray to date, Rio is stunning to watch on Blu-ray.  There is just enough
3D effect work here to make it worth the upgrade purchase. It's just really
unfortunate that Rio lacks the soul of better animated fare from the likes
of Pixar or Disney.",1453075200,,5125,4.775510204081633

We only bought it because we liked Rio 2 and wanted to also see Rio. (Yes, I know we are backwards) They can take it or leave it so I'm giving it three stars.

4376988,5,B004HO6I4M,"This review is about the film ""Rio"". It was made in 2011 by the creators of ""Ice Age"".
In the film ""Rio"", a young girl, Linda, finds a blue bird that she calls Blu and they become best friends. One day, a man wants to take Blu to Rio to save his species because he's the last male and there is only one female left, too. So they go to Rio to get to know Jewel and put Blu into her cage. Unfortunately, the two last blue birds get kidnapped and Linda tries to find them. The birds fight against people, other birds and monkeys. But they have one little handycap: the people put a chain on their legs, so they have to learn to fight side by side, but this doesn't work very well because Blu hasn't learned to fly...

I like this film very much because it is funny, sad and full of feelings. I like how the birds fight at the beginning, then learn to walk and fight together and fall in love at the end. I like the jokes and the unintelligent things the stupid people do, that really made me laugh.
When I saw the film, I had to admit that the english language isn't that ugly as I found before, actually, it's a quite cool language.

The only thing that I didn't like is that they speak so fast that I haven't understood very much, but that's not the film's fault.

I think you mustn't miss this film because it makes you feel - you laugh and you cry - and not only the kids but also older people. In addition, you can learn about life from this film.",1448236800,,1449,4.077192982456141

4378688,2,B004HO6I4M,"The movie itself is cute. However, I bought this disc at Walmart, and it would not play on my DVD player. It just keeps saying ""loading."" I have now returned and tried three different discs - the same thing. Although other DVDs play fine on my DVD player, Fox says the problem is with my DVD player and not their disc. They claim since it will play fine on some DVD players and computers that they do not have to disclose it will NOT play fine on ALL DVD players. According to other forums, it will also not play fine on some Blu-Ray players and skips on those.

If you purchase this disc AND OPEN IT - you will NOT GET YOUR MONEY BACK if you happen to have a DVD player that will not play it. If your DVD player will not play it, you can take it back to the store/ return it numerous times in exchange for more faulty copies; you can purchase a new DVD/ Blu-ray player that will hopefully play this one disc; or you can return it to Fox (at YOUR EXPENSE) for another faulty disc. Once the DVD is open Federal Law protects FOX from having to refund your money. Buyer beware!",1414972800,,1074,4.138755980861244

4378706,5,B004HO6I4M,"This is a very cute movie. I ended up buying this myself (and for my children's library) after watching it myself and seeing the reaction to my 2 year old niece. She LOVES this movie. Before she was 2, she would move her tushy up and down (dancing when she could only crawl) and instantly react/recognize the opening music. She loves the music in the film and will dance. Now at 2, she does dance and is instantly enthralled. I will admit she has attention deficit- this is one of the ONLY movies that will distract her the entire time. Now she also tries to sing along. If she's in another room and hears the music, she'll RUN in a panic towards it in fear that the movie is on and somehow she is missing it. The colors, animation, and story are excellent. It's a great addition to children's media.",1414540800,,800,4.34

There's also animal violence against each other but that's the least of the shows problems. I watched it with my 3.5 yr old and I was constantly skipping sections that were inappropriate.

That said, I opened it for the first time when my three year old was sick, put it in the dvd player and played it four times straight over the weekend never removing the actual dvd. The first two viewings were great, the third had a pause or two, and the fourth had a lot of pauses. Since we never removed it from our player between showings, we know the pauses are not due to human error but perhaps to a lower quality dvd. So not built to last, but for the price I paid (less than renting it on itunes) well worth it. Great movie, my kiddo doesn't like scary, so she loves Rio!",1411862400,,634,4.0

If your family enjoyed Rio, theyll appreciate this sequel, which brings back all of the original voice talents and offers the same sort of smorgasbord of songs, richly textured animation, and a serviceable plot that combines humor with mild peril. If Rio showed that 20th Century Fox Animation had finally moved into Disneys neighborhood, with Rio 2 theyve taken off their shoes and propped their feet up on the coffee table. This talented bunch is clearly comfortable with what they're doing, and they strut their stuff at every opportunity, showcasing things like complicated big-cast song-and-dance sequences and the hyper-realistic water and fireworks that used to be the sole province of Disney animators. And the writing, while not on a par with the best of Disney, is certainly good enough to match second-tier Disney efforts. A feast for the senses, this sequel features twice the music and twice the villains. Director Carlos Saldanha (Ice Age) was born in Rio, and his animated tributes continue to be loving. Rio 2 is rated G and it's pretty tame . . . but sensitive children might be shaken by a montage intended to humorously show the dangers of the Amazon, in which cute creature after creature is eaten or killed in shockingly quick fashion.

4379241,1,B004HO6I4M,"The movie itself is a fantastic movie, I LOVE Rio (as do my children).

This review is regarding this blu-ray disc. Before you play the movie, there's this message - ""This bluray disc is made with the latest bluray standards. If you have issues playing this disc your bluray player may require an update blah blah blah"". I didn't think anything of this message until I started playing the movie, and it keeps periodically freezing and skipping. I popped it out and tried cleaning it, and no dice - still freezes. I imagine this is why they have that ridiculous message - because they KNEW that this freezing and skipping was an issue. FYI, I'm playing the movie in my PS3. It does it in a 2 year old Sony bluray player as well. Beware - I guess they expect you to go buy a brand new ""updated"" bluray player for this not to skip and freeze. What a waste.",1403827200,5,853,4.33125

Then there was the beauty of the animation (the animals, Rio, and the rain forest looked fabulous!) The only problem I had (and it didn't last long,) was some confusion when Blu was clearly speaking In full sentences but his owner didn't understand him.  I got it that the audience can understand everything said by the animals, but the people in the story can't.  One last thing: Major props go to the creators for including characters of African descent.  This is what you experience in Rio, but this wouldn't have been the first animated story that didn't include people of color even if they existed in the environment.  This is a great family movie.",1399939200,,823,4.52027027027027

4379484,2,B004HO6I4M,"How can someone make such a lovely movie so insulting at the same time?, as a Brazilian, i know we have problems but why put all of them in a kid's movie for crying sake?

1 - They make all of the tough guys look like a travesty, even the bulldog , in fact even the tough bird had that travesty voice.
2 - Not all Brazilians women have big booties, they made even the guy's dentist with a big booty and sound like everyone in Brazil all they do in Carnaval is to party
3 - Even the monkeys steal from the tourists? are you serious?
4- They even managed to insult Samba, not that i am crazy about it but it's one of the Brazilian's popular music

I only gave 2 stars  because as a Kid's movie it was a lovely movie, hopefully they won't understand what the movie maker tried to portrait.",1396569600,3,786,4.058064516129032

So, we purchased it on the Kindle for instant whining relief. It worked! We drove down to NC from NY and it was super helpful. Overall, the movie itself is so vibrant and colorful.

4379579,2,B004HO6I4M,"Rio had me engaged for about thirty minutes before I found myself completely bored and lost in the chaos.  The simple narrative gets lathered with bright colors and loud music and essentially lost in the process.  The fact that none of the music is remotely interesting or memorable makes for this being a sorely lacking film that Im shocked has the fans it has.  I mean, we have friends who highly recommended this as a GREAT movie, and when all was said and done even my kids were uninterested.  I also found it pretty telling that you cannot decipher half the vocal cast.  Only Eisenberg and Lopez are distinguishable, with Will.i. Am, Jamie Foxx and Anne Hathaway lending their voices rather blandly.  Some people have what it takes to give a voice performance, and many others dont.  The real star here is obviously Jemaine Clement though, who voices the dastardly Nigel.  I only wish that Nigel had a better movie (his song is by far the best, but it is also underdeveloped and obvious).  At the end of the day, this was just dull.  For a film boasting some bold colors and loud music, this was colorless and empty.",1392854400,,1121,4.5879396984924625

4379606,4,B004HO6I4M,"Rio is a beautifully rendered film that is made more spectacular with its 3-D effects.  While clearly designed to delight children, it also provides plenty of pleasure for adults through its character development and clever turns of phrase.  The boy-meet-girl story is told on two levels:  the two rare birds -- one from the city and one from spectacular Rio -- and the two adults -- a shy, but knowing, woman who owns the city bird and a smart, but nerdy botanist who has re-located from the States to Rio in order to study the colorful birds found in the rainforest.  The samba rhythms keep the music from becoming cloying and, in fact, add some fine touches.

One of the movie's best features is the menagerie (literally) of second fiddles and bit players who waddle or fly --sometimes awkwardly and other times with soaring grace.  It's a cartoon, so most of the good guys are genuinely good, while the bad guys might as well be wearing black hats because their evilness is so totally transparent (even when they're pretending to be good guys).  But it does bring up a good point about the illegal poaching of rare birds from the rain forests and the willingness of wealthy clients to buy them despite threats of species extinction.  Rio shifts into darker color schemes when it enters the lair of the bad guys, so in case you missed the point of where bad vs. good is occurring, the film makes it perfectly clear.  The villain bird is a conniving liar who always looks like he needs a bath and flies awkwardly.  He's a total contrast with the good hearted birds who are both colorful and beautiful to watch

But the movie's strongest feature has to be the music, which beats with a Brazilian heart throughout the film, and provides the opportunity for some spectacular dancing numbers.  My only proviso is that the film pays some obvious tribute to Disney pictures such as Lion King in its biggest number (again, Lion King comes to mind).  But the numbers are well-done so you quickly forget that it's all been done before, and concentrate instead of the colorful birds and the heart-warming story.  Another highly successful element of the film is its portrayal of the Carnivale parade with its gorgeous animated floats and gyrating dancers moving to the rhythm of Rio.

I saw the film in 3D, and the effects were both excellent and subtle enough to keep the film from falling into overdone 3-D cliches. It's worthwhile wearing the glasses to see this one.  have a feeling that you wouldn't miss 3-D if you only purchase the 2-D Blu-Ray, but once you've seen it in 3-D there's simply no going back.  On my projector/screen combo, Rio was bright and beautiful with memorable moments throughout.  And since the samba beat was the glue that held it all together, a good sound system really pays off.

We never see anyone heading for the gym, but the heroine is in remarkably good physical condition for a gal from Minnesota who runs a barely successful pet store.  But, honestly, who cares about such details.  It's a fun movie and I can't wait to show it to my grandchildren.",1391040000,6,3079,4.6648148148148145

Cons: The movie's length is just right (neither too short nor too long) for young kids to watch.  The music and scripts are beautifully made.  The characters are cheerful, not too scary nor dark.

Cons: no HD format.  I however prefer non-HD as it can be played by older players on cars and places.

Strongly recommended.",1390780800,,512,4.315789473684211

So, when i came back from my trip, i immediately ordered the 3D version (coincidentally, it was on a deal which was a sweet surprise). Oh boy, soon i was eagerly watching it and jumping now and then easily co-relating the places i had been. It was so refreshing and the 3D effects were perfect. The sound effects were not too great but better (and hence 1 star less).

It's a very nice story, colorful, good for the kids to know about the exotic birds of Rio and Brazil. One thing that put me off was the drawing of characters. If you look closely enough, you'll see the same face for a number of characters. For example, the security guard at the aviary looks just like the tourist whose watch the monkey steals. The driver of the van of ""Exotic Pets"" in Minnesota and the police officer at the aviary in Rio look exactly the same.",1370908800,,615,4.176470588235294

4380020,2,B004HO6I4M,"Thought this was going to be a cute rated G movie to watch with my 6 year old.  The main theme of the movie is that scientists want the last two blue macaws to mate, which leads to tons of sexual innuendo.  Lots of music and sexy club dancing, verbal hints on how to woo a girl with your moves and attitude. it also takes place in rio durning carnival (think Mardi gras) where the main character dons a blue bikini and wings and is told to shake her booty on a parade float.  At this point my daughter asks ""mommy why is that lady going out in her underwear?""  The other underlying theme is the bird being unable to fly, something he needs to learn to do by using his heart and not his head.  Good point, but that concept was way over the head of the little kids.  On a positive note, the animation was cool and the kids enjoyed the variety of tropical birds, the soundtrack would have been awesome if it wasn't accompanied by all the club style dancing.",1365379200,6,954,4.185792349726776

4380032,4,B004HO6I4M,"Unlike industry moguls Pixar and DreamWorks, Blue Sky Studios hasn't been quite as versatile in their subject-matter when it comes to pumping out computer generated animated feature films.  Most people are aware of their ever-growing Ice Age franchise but do keep in mind that these are the guys behind Robots, Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who, the forthcoming Epic and Charles M Shultz's long overdue Peanuts CG film.  In short these guys have certainly been keeping busy!

Amidst all of these projects, Blue Sky released Rio back in 2011; a vibrant piece that forever silenced naysayers who claimed the studio didn't have access to the incredible color pallets of the competition.  Costing an estimated $90-mil, Rio comes in at a runtime of 96-minutes and wears an appropriate G-rating.

The story follows Blu, a wild born domesticated blue macaw thought to be the last of his breed, taken from Rio de Janeiro and then deposited in Minnesota only to head back to Brazil when an ornithologist believes that a potential mate has been secured in the wild.

On an existential level there's some ironic tragedy in the concept of removing a wild animal from nature, domesticating it so that it is completely dependent upon human care, then returning it to the wild where it's unable to perform such basic survival tactics as fly but not to worry, Rio is a lot more about having fun then it is environmentalism agendas (thankfully).

Add to this some well casted voice talent: Jesse Eisenberg as Blu; Anne Hathaway as his love interest Jewel; Jamie Foxx and will.i.am as a streetwise and musical canary and cardinal duo; George Lopez as a local toucan; Tracy Morgan as a slobbering bulldog; and Jemaine Clement of ""Flight of the Conchords"" fame stepping in as the villainous cockatoo Nigel.  The casting is flawless in their respective roles and add a great deal of energy to the visuals, which in case I haven't mentioned, are crisp, bright, and bouncy.

The opening musical number, featuring a rainbow stream of various birds of paradise in choreographed flight sets the tone of things to come.  While the film flirts with the concept of being a dedicated musical, I am pleased to report that the music here does nothing but add to the party-like vibe of the affair.  Everything from some original salsa-flavored tunes to Lionel Richie's ""Say you, Say Me"" to one of Jemaine Clement's hilarious rap numbers (straight out of his book as the character Hip-hop-opotamus).

Separating this from a strictly talking-animals affair however is the brilliantly intertwined B-story involving Blu's adopted mom Linda and said ornithologist (the nerdy but goodhearted Tulio) falling for one another as well.  Had I been charged with the job of naming this film, I believe something like ""Of Nerds and Birds"" would have been in order.

In all I found Rio to be a magnificent entry into the competitive CG market from Blue Sky, perhaps their strongest, most fleshed out to date in fact.  I'm apparently not alone in this assessment either as a sequel (Rio 2) is on Blue Sky's release schedule for 2014 (smack dab between Epic and Peanuts).  An interesting side note- it's oft rumored that Rio was actually responsible for Pixar having cancelled a film they were putting together called ""newt"" due to plot similarities.  You know you're doing something right when you can get the undisputed leader of the industry to stop in their tracks!",1364860800,,3416,4.923344947735192

This has got to be one of the WORST animated feature I've ever had the misfortune to see. What a stupid story line. especially for children.
Every time I heard the word ""carnival"" I wanted to throw something at the screen. Yes, it was colorful. But the music was sub par. And what's with the guy in drag?
Three out of the six of us who went fell asleep. They were the lucky ones.

4380101,5,B004HO6I4M,"Blu a domesticated blue Macaw, who was captured as a chick, cannot fly. And you, my fellow cinemaphobes, know that in the end, someway, somehow, Blu will be flying. After some excellent computer-animated features - ICE AGE, HORTON HEARS A WHO, etc - Blue Sky Studios hit a home run on this, their sixth feature. The visual technology here - especially in 3D - is every bit as good as the best from Pixar, DreamWorks and Disney Studios. Beyond the visuals, though, this is just a fun film for the entire family, with a humorous, heartwarming story...the actual rating is G, not PG; Blue Sky was able to get the original rating changed. There is also some top drawer voice acting in this film, by Jesse Eisenberg, as the nerdy, flightless, Blu; Ann Hathaway, as his love interest, Jewel; Leslie Mann as Linda, the owner of Blu; and Rodrigo Santoro as Tulio, who wants to get Blu and Jewel together because they are the last of their species. Also listen for Jamie Foxx as Nico, a canary who looks like Tweetie-Bird; and George Lopez, as Raphael, a Toucan who helps Blu and Jewel. There is plenty of adventure; plenty of romance between Blu and Jewel and Linda and Tulio; and plenty of song and dance numbers to a Brazilian beat...it ain't called RIO for nothing. And since this is a family movie - great for kids and adults of all ages - you know the ending will be a happy one. One of my favorite animated features and I think it will become one of yours too.",1361145600,,1458,4.464419475655431

4380111,4,B004HO6I4M,"First Blu-ray we ordered wouldn't work, so we thought there was a problem with the disc (we had ordered used).  Second disc was new and had the exact same issue.  Looked at the Amazon discussions and people were having problems playing on their PS3 players (we were playing ours on a Sony Blu-ray home theater system).  They had to disable the internet function on the PS3 to get the disc to work; we did the same and it also then worked.  It was very frustrating having to stop a movie on ""family movie night"" to research and fix a problem.....my kids were getting pretty impatient.

So I'd give the actual disc 1 star, but the movie 5 stars.  Kid-appropriate humor and they loved the music.  We even played the ""jukebox"" songs on the disc afterwards so they could dance their little hearts out.  (My kids are 6 and 3.)",1361059200,,820,4.456375838926174

As with any modern animated feature, the adult inuendos and under-tones are clear and prevalent while wholly maintaining the facade of simple kid entertainment.

4380122,2,B004HO6I4M,"There are some positive aspects to tbis movie, but they're adequately covered by others. The aspect that made this a regrettable choice for us is the sexual innuendo. I think the film is fine for little kids (5 and under) who don't perceive any of this or for 12 and older kids who are already encountering this at school, but between 5 and 12, we simply found the direct connection to the act of sex to be way, way too much. It's carnival in Rio, so clothing is really scanty on the human characters; another negative. Too much shake your booty.

I don't mind talking about how babies are made with my kids. I love that they dance and watch others dance. They simply don't need to see sexuality/sensualty at this age.",1360454400,3,718,4.4393939393939394

4380166,4,B004HO6I4M,"Rio is a cute movie, that is fun to watch. It has lots of good musical numbers that we get to watch along with a couple of budding romances. The story is about the illegal exotic bird trade with perhaps the last two birds of their kind captured by the traders. The male was brought to Brazil by his owner who was convinced by a conservationist that he was needed to mate with the conservation group's female. The conservation center is broken into and the pair of rare birds are stolen. Most of the rest of the movie are the attempts of the two birds, who end up chained together and manage to escape from the smugglers, to break the chain and get get back to the jungle (for the female) or the owner (for the male). Did I mention that the birds can talk with one another and with other animals? The male is way out of his element--he can't even fly--which leads to a lot of hilarious situations. Spoiler--you may want to skip this piece of commentary, although you can see it coming in the plot: Meanwhile, the owner and conservationist and the ""inside man"" (who has regretted what he did), are trying to track down the two birds. They have their own little adventures.
The 3D is good in this version, color is great. Worth watching although some jaded older kids may not be as excited by it.",1358553600,,1293,4.369294605809128

If you have a cheaper BluRay player, you probably won't be able to watch the BluRay disc without adding a thumb drive to the USB port. However, the 3D disc has the option of watching in 2D so we typically just use the one disc.

4380283,3,B004HO6I4M,"I saw this in theatres, and recently borrowed it from the library.

The good: Blu is realistic and so is Jewel. The creators have managed to convey real bird behavior to the big screen, for both the house pet/companion macaw (Blu) and the wild, untrusting of humans (Jewel) one. It's easy to get into the characters because their actions and reactions are so believable as real animals. Just watch a wild bird fly, sometime, and you can catch Jewel's thrill of being able to fly free. there's also real humor in it, as when Blu impersonates his owner's alram clock to wake her up.

Colors are great, scenery is vivid, as is the parade in Rio, as busy and gaudy as a real one. so are the costumes of the people in it.

Culture and music are portrayed accurately and in detail. Even down to the poverty stricken boy who steals for his boss, to get a little bit of money.

The bad. It's terrible for Conservative values, be they Jewish, Muslim, or Christian. Granted, the main characters are BIRDS, and do not naturally have morals. However, this is a humanized cartoon of birds, set in Rio with all the cultural mores of that city. So, we have to look at it as not a documentary - but as entertainment aimed at humans.

The music and dancing focus on sex and sensuality, and inspiring desire (even lust) when performed by people in real life. This would lead to ""hooking up"" and illicit sex. It makes little difference that these are cartoons. Blu's friends urge him to be a ""love hawk"" and get his moves on the girl. This repeats through the film. Not values I'd want in my kids! Nor do I want them play acting scenes from the movie. Role play leads to adult behavior later. Free sex may be okay in the Rio singles scene, but not for conservative minded people.

There is the bulldog that dances around in a gold foil costume for carnival - a pro-gay offering put into the film? An effeminate dog isn't ""cute"" in my opinion.

I also didn't like having yet another ""men-are-stupid"" themed movie. Jewel is the smart one who has her act together, Blu is smitten, clueless, and inept.

The kidnapping and hostage scenes are intense enough to build suspense, but could scare some kids. Old Disney films would never have been this realistic and include so many details of criminal intimidation and evilness.

Bottom line - no, I will not have this in my library. I returned it to the local library stacks.",1351814400,2,2398,4.506912442396313

4380314,3,B004HO6I4M,"Rio has some great music, superb animation by Blue Sky, a fantastically talented cast turning in some excellent voiceover work, and even an intriguing story. It's guranteed to entertain the hell out of little kids, and definitely some adults. But, like most Blue Sky animated films, it just doesn't hold a candle to the likes of Pixar, or even DreamWorks (although it certainly tops their weaker films). I thought animation studios were done with the immature humor after seeing Up, Wall-E, and How To Train Your Dragon garner both critical acclaim, as well as Box Office success. Unfortunately, we still have to put up with characters like Will.i.am and Jamie Foxx's. Don't get me wrong. Those guys did a great job at delivering their lines. It's the lines themselves that I have a problem with.

You can see in one of the trailers when Will.i.am's character (a red and black bird) does a little rap, and....I don't quite know why, but it sort of rubbed me the wrong way. I just thought to myself, ""You guys actually wrote that thinking it was good? And you got paid to?"" Maybe we just need better writers for kids' movies. Maybe producers need to take notes from Pixar, and stop approving them. Besides my gripes, this is still a decent movie. I was never bored while watching it, but I cannot ignore the cringe-worthy moments. If you can, more power to you. I recommend it for the sheer pageantry of it all, but with caution that it's more on the level of Ice Age (another Blue Sky film, that despite its praise, I did not like), and nowhere near Toy Story 3, How To Train Your Dragon, or even the moderately great, but most often just ""good"" Tangled and Despicable Me.",1341792000,4,1672,4.610738255033557

Just about everything submitted by other consumers was very positive, so I made the purchase and all I can say is that the reviews were dead on. RIO is one of our top 5 for many reasons: Great 3-d effects, glorious colors, a story that kept us entertained to the end, a great soundtrack, on and on. This was definitely money well spent and showed me that if I'm on the fence about a future dvd purchase with no knowledge of the content, video quality, or quality of the 3-d effects, customer feedback can indeed be a useful tool.",1341360000,9,853,4.405063291139241

4380325,3,B004HO6I4M,"The conceit of a bird who can't fly (I mean other than an ostrich or penguin or some such bird that really can't fly) and his misadventures that led him to learn how to fly was a good starting point for a kid's movie.  Talking animals: check.  A romantic interest: check.  An exotic location: check.  Bright, lavish colors and some songs: check.  A cast of quirky supporting characters: check.  So how did Rio manage to fly a bit lower than it looked like it should have done on paper?  I'd go back to the characters.  Blu is likable and a bit neurotic out of his element and works alright as the lead character but the rest of the cast falls a little flat.  Blu's partner/ owner, Linda, is gentle and caring and not much else.  Blu's love interest, Jewel, doesn't have much going on other than she's mean and yearns to be free.  The bird doctor is daffy but, along with the other human representations of Rio de Janeiro's citizenry, could come off as a little offensive (don't believe me? go back and look at all of the main human characters who are Brazilian: you have the cooky bird guy and his inept, too-tight spandex wearing security officer; you have the thieving thugs, both mean and dim-witted; you have the orphan boy who, though sympathetic, is a thief).  I'm sure that kids won't take it this way and they will find some humor in these characters and that they're all cartoonish, i.e., exagerrated but still...I'm just saying.  As for the other animals: did anyone else find the tweety bird and woodpecker annoying? George Lopez's (a gifted comedian) character is played straight and isn't very interesting other than to look at; the drooling bulldog...was hard to watch as that slobber was just too real.  Perhaps the only other character that was better developed than most was Nigel, the evil cockatoo (how can cockatoo be evil? they are some sweet birds!).  He was a good villain, but ugly.

My final thought is that you could do a lot worse than Rio, but you can also do a lot better.",1335484800,,2001,4.563025210084033

4380348,3,B004HO6I4M,"I had been to Rio de Janeiro a few years back, and was expecting a fun-type animated adventure through this most enigmatic city. The actual premise is OK, but I was also immediately in touch with a film that was a bit pandering to the infant mentality. I immediately thought ""Kids ain't that dumb"". It's admirable that the mating habits of animals were suggested, and suddenly it became a romantic comedy, with perhaps every racial stereotype along the way to add to the proceedings, except any semblance of Brazilian.

Quite simply, I wasn't very entertained. This is entirely due to a poorly structured script. The acting was fine, and there was a lot of clever animation and displays of the glories of the city, but I'm sure most kids will write it off as stuff they'd already seen.

Routine, considering where animated features have gone, like SHREK or WALL-E or UP.

The amount of time and effort that must have gone into creating this picture simply beggars the mind. The attention to detail is incredible.

The story is not revolutionary, as it's typical animated fare, but it's quite good, and it warmed my heart on more than one occasion. Furthermore, the songs in this movie are great, as many of them have a Brazilian inspired theme, and they're quite different from anything I've heard in other animated movies (Nigel's villainous number takes the cake).

4380365,3,B004HO6I4M,"A 2011 animation ""Rio"" has everything that would make a great film. Well, almost. It has great visuals. It has nice music and musical scenes. It has great voice acting. There are also some decent action sequences (though not many in number). What it doesn't have is a compelling narrative that would make us relate to the central characters, two blue macaws Blue and Jewel.

Timid and bookish Blu (voice by Jesse Eisenberg) and feisty Jewel (Anne Hathaway) are the last of their kind. And having been raised in Minnesota by a bookstore owner Linda, Blue cannot fly. The film's weak opening gets better when Blu and Jewel are stolen from an ornithological institute in Rio by smugglers.

Most of the story based on a comedic fish-out-of-water situation takes place in Rio de Janeiro. This is a wise decision as the city provides the animated film (directed by Carlos Saldanha, co-director of ""Ice Age"" with Chris Wedge; director of its two sequels) with opportunities to show the beautifully rendered visuals full of bright colors.

But the film needs better storytelling. The script (with four credited screen writers) is not really great, just acceptable. The most disappointing thing about ""Rio"" is that neither the story nor the characters is given a chance to be really involving. It seems the filmmakers are not willing to take any chance, as seen in the half-hearted character development of human characters, especially Linda. Someone like Brad Bird would have given her a chance to shine. Some ideas (Blu's dancing skills, for instance) look as if forgotten or abandoned in the middle of the story.

4380370,3,B004HO6I4M,"Overall this is a cute movie, especially for families or those into animation.
It has a variety of unique characters (some too funny for their own good) and fun songs to sing along with.
The story follows a vert rare tropical bird on a trip down to South America to meet and hopefully mate with the last female of his kind.  Of course, the female has other plans, like an escape out of her caged confinement and the adventure begins...
My issue was with the story, which was boring and slow at times, and lacked greatness. So I have to look to the writers. The story lacked a strong enough foundation, the drama, the hurdles the main character must go through in order to save the day. Those steps, create the tension, and it's that tension that hooks us to the main characters plight (take ""Gladiator""). This movie just didn't pack a punch, and it could have.
A story doesn't have to be down played or made ""simple"" just because it is an animated movie. It can be a great story, and still be a family movie with a punch.
It is a light movie, if you're not picky about story.

4380373,5,B004HO6I4M,"Fun, animated, hilarious and touching-Rio is a movie you'll never forget.

It starts with Blu.  Blu is very rare macaw living in America.  He's never been to his home land after birth, he's never really seen other birds and that's right-he doesn't even know how to fly.  When a renowned ornithologist asks that Blu be brought to Brazil to repopulate his kind with the last female, his owner is very hesitant.  Finally, she agrees and Blu finds himself in a whole new world.  But Jewel, his female counterpart is not exactly what he expected.  And the two of them don't exactly see eye to eye.  When they are suddenly snatched up in the middle of the night-they have to work together to get back.  It's one wild adventure after another as Blu finds himself doing things he never imagined he would.

4380382,3,B004HO6I4M,"I'll review only 3D feature .its Simple plot movie directed towards kids but in my experience kids love out of screen effects and we adults created whole dilemma of in depth vs out of screen effects .This movie can be easily defined as in depth 3D with may be couple of pop out effects. After one hour mark clearly there is much improvement in 3D effects .Throughout movie subtitles also keep switching trend .First hour or so they are in depth but afterwards they start to pop out .Clearly director kept his spanish heritage intact in this movie by giving great detail to color,samba(Booty shaking) and songs.

On side note as I'm fan of pop out effects by ckenisell ;

  To label 3D as a gimmick is just incorrect when it's used properly.

I still remember The Muppets in 3D at Disney and one of the characters (gonzo maybe?) points directly in your face. EVERYBODY in the theater thinks that the character is pointing at them. It's an amazing experience and I don't think anybody in the theater was thinking about anything other than the muppet pointing at them. You are drawn in more when those things happen. Not taken out of the scene.

Now, having said that, it has to be used sparingly. It's not cool to always have in-your-face shots. Your brain would tire of it. If you watch the behind the scenes of Tangled 3D BD (or maybe it was the Shrek 4 Dreamworks crew that said it), the directors talk about dialing up and down the depth of field in 3D so that your brain doesn't get used to seeing the in-your-face shots. They do this so that, when those shots do occur, your brain interprets those shots as something special. The directors can use 3D as another tool to draw your emotions into their film.",1325462400,,1709,4.496774193548387

4380390,1,B004HO6I4M,"In the spirit of Ice Age, the makers of this movie have taken what ought to be a thought-provoking subject area (the ecosystem of the Brazilian rain forest) and completely perverted it with equal amounts of adult innuendo, grossly inner-city hip hop and ""bling,"" lowest-common-denominator stereotypes of Brazilians, and a chicken-drumstick-eating cockatiel. There is little plot to speak of, no real character development, and no theme whatsoever. Unsurprisingly, the Spanish language track is translated to use the worst Mexican Spanish and Spanglish slang of the U.S. urban ghetto. And to top it all off, the 3D was almost entirely in-screen and underwhelming--very half-heartedly done.

I had to turn the movie off after 35 minutes, as there was no way I was going to let my 9 year old continue to watch this junk. While I was enraged, my Mexican wife was horrified by how bad the movie is. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.

4380414,5,B004HO6I4M,"My spouse and I bought this DVD for the grandkids to watch this weekend. So we previewed it last night to make sure it was okay for the 3 yr old. We watched this 95-minute movie and were thoroughly entertained! If you have a 3D TV, you MUST buy this movie...it will be the demo disk you want to show your guests.

First, without going into detail about the plot, let me say that the feature moves along quickly throughout. The story develops and holds your attention. The opening Rio theme music is choreographed with a wide array of colorful birds and needs to be watched closely for clever details. The song itself is catchy and really good...better than what you find in the Lion King. There are only a handful of songs, and they are all very good and engaging.

When Rafael, the toucan, takes Blu and Jewel to the top of a mountain for flying lessons, his 3D-beak magically emerges from the screen....just one of the several excellent 3D effects. The scene follows the two birds falling, then soaring, and finally landing on a crowded beach. Again, the 3D is incredible and the details are comical and beautiful at the same time. Another scene, which I think is a classic, involves the two riding atop a streetcar, trying to get to know each other. Rafael flies through the blossoming trees on the street, creating a shower of blossoms over the two love birds. This is done to the accompaniment of a serenade. Almost makes you want to go to Rio!

Throughout this movie we laughed, and when we weren't laughing, sat there with wide grins soaking up the great vibes from this wonderful movie. Adults will enjoy the smart humor, and young kids will groove to the samba music and colorful birds. Definitely one of the best we've seen!

Almost forgot, the movie is preceded by a short animation called 'Scrat's Continental Crack-Up'. You'll recognize Scrat from the Ice Age animations. This is short and VERY funny...a great prelude to a great movie.",1323993600,,1949,4.6405797101449275

It was as if each bird was created exclusively for each voice actor. I most enjoyed Will. I.Am as Pedro.

GET THIS; There are about 145 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer and another 36 ranging from 15% to 25%.

The quality of the 3D, in screen and out is exceptional and the movie had my wife and I in stitches many times. This is defiantly a homerun by 20th Century Fox. For animated films, this ranks right at the top along with Open Season and Ice Age.

MY 3D RATING = EXCELLENT (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)

Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.

4380460,4,B004HO6I4M,"Premise:
A rare blue Macaw is captured from the Brazilian rain forest and smuggled to Minnesota where he's expected to sell, but like any good cartoon, he falls off the truck and adopted by a sweet girl who raises him. Unfortunately since he's grown up in captivity, he doesn't know how to fly. Things get interesting when some ten or fifteen years later an ornithologist receives word of his location and convinces the girl who owns him to fly down to Brazil where he can mate with potentially the last female blue Macaw and repopulate the dying species.

Standouts:
I know I'm going to sound cliche, but animated musical numbers were much better in the 90's. Thankfully they kept this to a minimum, but the film still paled in comparison to just about any of Pixar's stuff. Blue Sky Studios produced this animated feature, and it's very evident when watching it. There's just something about the use of physical comedy and odd-use of sexuality that didn't feel like a Dreamworks or Pixar feature.

My Highlights:
Any scene with Tracy Morgan's character, anytime the male blue Macaw tries to put his moves on the female, the toucans, and the monkey tourist trap.

Overall Rating:
I thought everyone did a great job in this film, though at times I thought Jesse Eisenberg could have been a little more impactful in his delivery. Apparently he was voice-acting for this film whenever he wasn't live-action acting for The Social Network, so it's not surprising he might have been a little burned out or tired when doing this. The animation was another really huge upside to this film, because everything looked beautiful and could do a lot of good business for Brazil. Plot, inventiveness, and suitability-wise, I was a little disappointed in Rio. It felt like it was just missing it's potential by a little bit in so many scenes. I give this film a respectable 3 1/2 *'s out of 5, or 7 *'s out of 10.

When You Should See It:
If you / your kids really liked Ice Age or Horton Hears A Who, check it out. If you're not the type to go out and rent animated films unless they're getting amazing hype, you can skip this one with a clear conscience.",1319673600,,2142,4.6141732283464565

The colors truly pop off the screen. This makes the story. The music is not overpowering, but could have had a few more songs. The song Nigel (former ""pretty bird"") steals the show. It has enough adult humor without being over the head of the kids. The subject matter does get mature (the smuggling of birds) and Nigel is scary at times, so the more sensitive/younger child might not be the intended audience. Otherwise this is a nice movie for older children and adults who enjoy a love story and/or great animation. The extra DVD or ""party edition DVD"" is a waste of time.

It is region A only and consquently will not work with region B and C players. So I am stuck with 2 useless discs.
So don't double check, triple check!! I hear its a great 3D disc though so it looks as though I shall have to get the local version.",1316390400,,410,4.1375
4380507,3,B004HO6I4M,"Colorful and nicely animated, 'Rio' suffers from a boring plot line and mediocre music and songs. One can see how overwhelming this film must have been in theaters in 3D, but at home, in flat 2D, the film is a disappointment from the usually fine Blue Sky team.  The film starts with promise with a prologue that introduces us to the main characters of Blu the macaw who cannot fly and Linda, a typical heroine from animation land who we all know will somehow end up in a bikini for Rio's carnival. The opening musical sequence of colorful birds set to Brazilian music is promising but the viewer will be disappointed to discover that, except for the end credits, that is the last you will see of such dancing antics and music. The remaining musical numbers are uninspiring and the use of two bird companions who rap and hip hop seems strangely out of place in a film supposedly set in Brazil. Definitely on the low end of 2011's animated films but kids will not care if you park them in front of the TV to watch this colorful and fast paced film. Adults who like animation should give it a pass.",1316390400,,1096,4.425742574257426

4380510,4,B004HO6I4M,"Your children will probably love Rio if they tend to like the animated movies out these days. It's full of funny jokes and animals going on adventures, and parents will be happy to know there is hardly any violence. Even though it deals with criminal activities, no one dies and the villains are pretty silly.

As far as grown-ups go, adults might like hearing celebrities lend their voices to the characters, as there are a ton of well-known actors included in the cast. The best thing would have to be scenes showing off the city. When the main macaw, Blu, sees the city from a bird's-eye-view for the first time, he was in awe...you might feel the same way. There aren't more than a handful of parts that show off the city's greatness, but I absolutely loved them, and they make me want to go visit Rio in the future.

It is quite predictable, which shouldn't be a problem because it's mainly geared toward kids, but I don't think this movie will stick with the older viewers as much as some other recent animated movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Up-Single-Disc-Edition/dp/B001KVZ6FW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Up (Single-Disc Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Toy-Story-3/dp/B00275EHJG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Toy Story 3</a>&nbsp;had. The extras on the DVD contained sketches of one deleted scene, and some videos to go with all the music in the movie. I wish there was some commentary from the producers, a game, or even something else in the extras, but I guess that doesn't make me dislike the movie or anything. Also, the ending was a bit rushed. It seemed like the film was just beginning to explore romances between some characters, and then it fast forwarded the story to finish it off.

Overall, I liked it. I think you will enjoy it at least once, and your little ones will enjoy it time and time again.",1316304000,,1937,5.344262295081967

4380528,1,B004HO6I4M,"First this is a review on the blu-ray product, not the movie. (The movie is awesome btw, my kids love it!)
There is an issue between this blu-ray disc and the PS3. (However in my research it seems systemic to Sony and Samsung players, but I can only validate for the PS3... and YES, I have all the latest firmware updates). The issue is the movie skips periodically through out the entire movie. Interestingly the fix is to disable the internet on the PS3. Under system settings -> Network Settings, select ""Internet"" and select ""Disable"". Among all of my blu-ray discs, this is the only one I've had this problem with. Either the manufactures haven't caught up to new blu-ray software, or this is a bad batch and FOX needs to recall it. I have contacted FOX and complained about the problem, here is the number for anyone else wanting to complain: Call (877)369-7867 to report the problem. I'm going to wait a few weeks and see if a firmware update materializes, otherwise I'll return this for a refund.

UPDATE 9/23/2011:
A new system update came in for the PS3 (3.72). I applied the update, however it did not fix this problem. Very disappointed. We've decided to keep the movie anyway, but it would be nice to not have to turn off the internet connection every time the movie is played.

Also beware; Fox has spread the problem, X-Men: First Class has the same exact issue.",1315526400,4,1377,4.59349593495935

I think with a little more thought and about 5-10 more minutes of expanding what happens to the characters at the end would have done it.  But that did not happen.

4380580,3,B004HO6I4M,"Rio seemed to stay in theaters longer than any non-Pixar animated movie in recent memory. I was actually surprised each week when I'd check the weekly box office scores and see Rio still in the top 5, week after week. The movie must've done something right, right? Well, I think the main reason it stuck around so long was because it was pretty much the only family movie out at the time. I recently finished the movie, and while it took me 5 sittings to get through the whole thing, I'll be honest and say that while I definitely didn't like it, it's still better than some other recent family movies (Hop, I'm lookin' at you). Rio just doesn't have much going for it aside from a colorful cast of characters and most of the focus being on the birds. A lot of the jokes fall flat, there's not much danger from the villains, and most of the actors chosen to do the voices shouldn't have been anywhere near this movie. But hey, at least George Lopez isn't doing his usual 'ayyyyy! I'm Mexican, we all talk like-a deeeeees! Low Riders!' here.

The movie starts out with a baby blue macaw waking up in the rain forest of Rio de Janeiro as hundreds of birds dance and sing happily. Within minutes, they're caught by poachers and shipped off to who knows where, but the little macaw's crate falls off the truck in the middle of Minnesota of all places. A little girl named Linda saves him, and raises him as her own pet, naming him Blue. Blue never learns how to fly, but doesn't need to since he's efficient at walking and climbing, so he's set. Years pass and Linda's in her late teens or early 20s, when a man from Brazil shows up to her book store and wants to take Linda and Blue with him, where Blue will be paired up with the only other surviving blue macaw, where they'll save their species. Linda agrees, but once they make it back to Rio, where Carnival is starting, Blue is once again taken by poachers, but this time he's chained to the other macaw, Jewel. She doesn't think highly of him, calling him a pet and irritated by the fact that he can't fly, but they'll have to work together if they're going to escape from the poachers, and especially if they're going to be mates.

Yes it's another fish out of water story, and it's another predictable one at that. The cast of characters is as generic as you get: dweeb hero, headstrong girl he's in love with, a knowledgeable sidekick, two goofy buddies, a trio of stooges for the secondary bad guys, and the main bad guy (another bird) with an accent. I didn't care about any of these characters, apart from Jewel, and that's because she's a no-nonsense character that I could at least agree with on how she handled some things. The others were just kinda...there. It didn't help that the voice actors barely put any effort into their lines, especially Jemaine Clement as Nigel, the evil bird. Even during his song, Jemaine sounds bored. It made me wonder why more actors didn't take a lesson from Jeremy Irons when he sang Scar's 'Be Prepared' in The Lion King. The other voice actors, including Tracy Morgan and will.i.am (ugh) play such stereotypes that it was borderline offensive. It seemed like will.i.am was just brought into the movie so he could show off a few sound effects he could do vocally, act 'street' and that was it. and Leslie Mann as a young girl? I don't even need to comment on that one. Enough with the voices though, as much as it bothered me, because the other main problem is that things are just so light. The problems the heroes get into are resolved in no time, and like I said, the villains don't pose much of a threat. Jewel's never intimidated by Nigel, who towers over her, and has no problem making the first move. If anything, Nigel's just a jerk, nothing more.  At the same time, and I know I'm contradicting myself here, I'm kind of glad it took the light route and didn't take things too seriously, because they could've easily done that here. The poaching bit was just begging for some kind of forced message, and they didn't do it.

Were there things I liked about this movie? Sure. The animation and art direction was beautiful, and while it's not on Pixar or Dreamworks' finest level (How to Train Your Dragon and the Kung Fu Panda movies), the scenes with animals and flying around are a sight to behold. As flat as a lot of the jokes were, there was one that made me laugh out loud a little bit involving a crotch shot where the victim spits out two jewels. Anne Hathaway also did good with what she had to work with, though that's just a sign of a good actress, and she's done voice acting before in The Cat Returns and Hoodwinked. Kids 8 and under will probably be the best audience for Rio, but anyone older won't get much out of it.

The blu-ray looks and sounds perfect, that's all there is to it. I don't have any complaints at all with either area, and this is definitely something to show off your new tv with if you want to use an animated film as a demo. You can really see the tiniest details in the trees during the rain forest sequences, and the sound is all over the place during the more hectic bits. The special features are ok, with most of them focusing on music, dance, and the voice actors. I've actually always liked seeing footage of the actors recording their lines, so this was a treat to see. It was also nice that they included Angry Birds Rio, my personal favorite of the Angry Birds games, as it feels more polished than the others, and features characters and levels from the movie. The game was already cheap enough, but getting it for free is cool for people who haven't went for it yet.

Had there been better acting, at least to match the facial expressions of the characters, I would've been a little more into the movie. I have to stress that as much as there was that I didn't like about the movie, it's still not bad and there are worse animated movies from the last couple of years that you could pick over this. Rio is a beautiful but flawed movie. Rent it and then decide if you want to spend the money on it.",1313884800,5,6050,4.392506690454951

4380587,4,B004HO6I4M,"Minus 1 star for BluRay playback problems!

Thanks Sony. A wonderful movie that we enjoyed in the theaters and a somehow you have found a way to spoil the enjoyment at home (or at least take the luster off the shine).

The DVD playback is great if you don't need the HD version, but Sony's own BluRay format playing on a new and SW updated Sony PS3 Slim (the ideal combination right?) has playback problems! I've read other players have playback problems too, so check the Internet if you haven't checked your system first to see.

On the PS3 it hangs and stutters at random times on the video playback. Audio is always fine and uninterrupted. A query on Google shows me that many others are having the same problem. Luckily there seems to be some solutions. If you have this issue, you need to delete the Rio data (Under Video>BD Data Utility menu on PS3) *and* disable the internet for playback, very convenient (not!). I hope Sony will figure out why their own stuff is broken.

This doesn't seem limited to a certain batch of discs, the bluray .com forum seems to believe it's player specific, so some folks will enjoy the movie in HD without having to bother, most likely if you're not using a Sony player.

This review reflects the problems I've experienced on 8/14 as we watched it together as a family on BluRay. This is for the 3 pack (BluRay,DVD and Digital copy). Save your money and get this on DVD or wait for it streaming.",1313280000,8,1436,4.486590038314176

4380590,4,B004HO6I4M,"Rio is a great story full of vibrant colors, fun, great music, and personal challenges. Blu, the lead parrot, is taken to Rio to mate with the only remaining female of his species. Let's just say it wasn't love at first bite. But in the process, he is snatched by a group of bird smuggling thugs and handcuffed to his female companion. Unfortunately, Blu doesn't know how to fly and all of their escapes are hindered by his need to walk everywhere. Couple this with the lively atmosphere of the Carnival build-up and Blu's heartbroken owner trying desperately to find him. It's a story of cooperation, personal struggles, and hope for the endangered species especially in our rainforests.

The music is fun, the characters are huge on the spectrum of being likable or hated. The animal characters speak so we see things from all perspectives. I hate to say it but the movie dragged a little for me in some spots. I'm not sure why it didn't keep my attention but my kids (ages 7 and 12) enjoyed it very much.

4380591,1,B004HO6I4M,"Graphics/animation quality: First hint, of Saturday cartoon level animation is that the background has no life. It's unvaryingly the same - clouds/leaves/trees don't move/change, or do anything but look the same flat 2D. Second hint, is the overuse of repeated shape such as the same bird being used repeatedly in the same scene. Third hint, the overuse of big eyes and mostly eye/mouth movement to sell the character and not much else. Fourth hint, lots of flat plastic like featureless bodies and faces. Even the hair looks and moves like a nylon cleaning duster. Fifth hint, the overall storyboard quality resembled more a 3rd graders attempt at story drawing than a professional work. Witness the difference in animation quality between this movie and Rango. Sometimes animators get too stuck into the animation software so that the end result seems ""too computerish"".

Storyline: Same old animal (cat, dot, whatever) ends up with humans either accidentally or via the kidnapped route and faces the challenge of returning home despite bad humans and evil some other critter. Not creative - boring because the same story has been in the studio repeat mode for the past decade or so. The story was too predictable throughout the movie. Just another quick 'n easy dollar as the sole motivation for creating Rio.

Script: Simplistic and dumbed down. Nothing intelligent, no allusions, no parodies, just nothing new. Even the music seemed like pointless filler as if the script needed dancing/singing animals to make the story have some energy. To make it worse the dance movements are almost identical to what was used in other animations by this studio.

Voices: Bland, no imagination. Voices sounded more like humans, sounding like humans and not the more challenging putting yourself in the place of the critter and imagining how that animal would converse. And the use of a usually wacky African-American urban slang voiced character, which has become incresingly common in animations, borders on racist stereotyping.",1313193600,11,2021,5.193251533742331

4380595,4,B004HO6I4M,"I want to go to Rio de Janeiro!  Rio is an exuberant CGI animated 3D film with wonderfully vibrant colors that literally jump off the screen.  This is a classic fish out of water story filled with romance, life lessons and a fairly predictable ending.  Nevertheless, Rio is a truly enjoyable film and nearly impossible to watch without dancing in your seat.  Director Carlos Saldanha incorporates a tremendous amount of the Brazilian culture into the film and realistic landscape; it is very easy to forget this is an animation.  In particular, the flight scenes offer spectacular bird's eye views of the exotic Rio de Janeiro setting.  Breathtaking scenery filled with rich, warm colors is incredibly detailed and mesmerizing.

Although the themes are familiar, the characters are engaging and loveable.  Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) is a domesticated macaw from a small-town who embarks on an adventure in Rio de Janeiro with native, Jewel (Anne Hathaway) to save endangered animals.  Credit goes to the writers for providing a sharp, witty dialog and the voice actors for bringing the animated characters to life.  In addition to the incredible computer generated visuals, the music adds authentic Brazilian flavor and zest.  I love the samba and bossa nova rhythms that pulsate throughout and provide infectious energy.  Rio is not billed as a musical but it definitely has that feel and the music is what makes this fast-paced adventure so enjoyable.  The Carnival festival explodes on the screen with vigor and verve providing a dazzling display of movement and color set perfectly to music.

Rio does not have the depth of some other animated stories; however, it is pure fun from beginning to end.  This movie is a visually stunning escape from everyday life and serves as an animated brochure for a place I hope to visit one day.

HOWEVER playing the Blu-ray on my Playstation 3 fails badly. I checked several other Blu-ray discs to make sure my PS3 wasn't broken.  I also checked for PS3 software updates.  Then I returned Rio for a replacement, but the replacement has the same problem: the video keeps freezing up on the PS3 while the audio continues.  This happens every couple of minutes, ruining the film experience.  Fortunately it comes with the DVD, so I watched that instead without any problems.

I'm not the only one having this problem: [...]",1312675200,6,574,4.8061224489795915
4380601,4,B004HO6I4M,"As a person who LOVES birds and shares my life with parrots and other kinds of birds, I'm simply thrilled someone finally has made an animated movie devoted to these unique, funny, and beautiful creatures.  I'd been waiting years for Pixar to get around to it, but alas, they are more focused on anthropomorphizing cars and trying to incinerate toys, so thankfully THIS studio took up the task.  And what an amazing result.

I'm not sure, but I think that the main character of Blu is based on the Spix's Macaw - a very endangered parrot at this time.  Disturbing as the subject of bird-trafficking is, it was wise and important that the creators took on the subject to encourage more awareness, and I applaud them for doing so.

A synopsis isn't needed here, as others have given that.  I simply want to add in my 2 cents towards highly recommending this movie.  Adults will enjoy it, as will kids.  As will my own birdies, who are going to get to watch it soon.  The animation is glorious, with eye-popping colors.  BluRay need not apply, as DVD format is just perfect in its rendering and clarity.  The detailing in such things as just the cross-thatching texture on the beaks of the macaws, and the way the feathers were rendered - some of those details added to the movie subtly for the benefit of ""bird people"" to notice and appreciate - was delightful.  There are a lot of those little treats tossed in, like the pigeon-toed way the parrots walked.  Loved it, loved it. The music is great, too.  Especially the opening titles theme and segment, done in an almost gentle and ethereal way as you're guided into the jungle setting populated with what are, to many, very ethereal creatures.  So well done.

I did take away one star due to a minor annoyance.  I know some of the voice-over actors are African-American, but I don't think adding in SO many hip-hop cultural references, speech style and mannerisms fit in.  It was out of place and got old REALLY fast.  This was set in Brazil, with some characters originating from Minnesota, so more Brazilian and Minnesota jokes and puns should have been emphasized.  Even some of the music was in hip-hop style.  Give me a break already.  They did touch heavily on the Brazilian obsession with soccer in a hilarious way, so kudos for that, at least.

All in all, this was a joy to watch.  I hope there will more movies in the future about birds.  Maybe one set in Australia, so we can see budgies and cockatiels in animated form.  Even most of our familiar backyard birds would prove to be funny and adorable characters in movies of this style.  It's a treasure-trove of possibilities.  So bottom line: get this and watch it.  You'll have fun!  'Nuff said.  :)",1312675200,3,2712,4.5875

Jesse Eisenberg's shy, nerdish Blu is typical Jesse as is Anne Hathaway's coquettish Jewel formulaic cuteness.  The music is lively but not Oscar worthy.

The 3D quality is excellent and much better than most of the 3D movies that are currently available. The CG animated animals and people of Rio de Janeiro come to life with added levels of depth and pop-out effects. The vibrant colors of the city and jungle landscapes match the outstanding quality of sound. The times when characters appear to come out of the TV isn't gimmicky or done solely for audience reaction. The 3D effects definitely add to the overall enjoyment of the movie. The sound quality is amazing and the musical sequences are spectacular.

I took a risk by buying a 3D movie that I hadn't seen before and I'm not disappointed with this purchase. The package comes with the 3D Blu-Ray disc, 2D Blu-Ray disc, DVD disc, and the Digital Copy disc. It's also one of the compatible ""Pocket Blu"" movies which lets you watch the movie and some of the bonus features on your mobile device and/or computer.

The Film 3.5/5

After seeing a trailer for Rio, I wasn't expecting much when I finally sat down to watch the movie. The trailer consisted of animals shrieking or screaming and performing stupid moves such as dancing. I also dislike that every scene has to be punctuated with a blast from the subwoofer. I chose to watch your trailer and you're going to hold my attention for two minutes, so you don't have to blast noise at me to keep me watching. I'll decide whether something is interesting or dramatic by myself, thanks. That's becoming a huge annoyance.

Anyway, let's get back to the movie.

I love the way Rio opens. There are birds everywhere and they are happily dancing. The colors are very striking and I don't think I have ever seen a more colorful movie. Birds and other animals seem to cover most of the colors in the spectrum and the look of the movie is appealing throughout.

Blu (Eisenberg) is a tiny young macaw and he's captured during the opening scene. We see him rescued by a girl named Linda (Leslie Mann), and he's completely happy as her pet for the next 15 years. The two share a bond and it's a heartwarming relationship. Their world is turned upside down when an ornithologist begs her to take Blu to Brazil as he's thought to be the last male of his species. Linda is reluctant, but eventually agrees.

The two fly to Rio and Blu is introduced to Jewel (Hathaway), his prospective mate. Jewel is more concerned about escape and can't understand why Blu tolerates humans. The two are left overnight to begin their courtship, but a boy steals them and sells them to a gang which deals in rare birds.

The remainder of the story shows what happens as Linda tries to find Blu. She initially rescued him before he learned how to fly and it becomes clear that he still hasn't discovered how it's done. Blu is aided by a variety of other birds as he attempts to find Linda. The gang enlists minions to find Blu and Jewel, resulting in a number of fights and chase scenes.

Rio lacks the heart of Pixar movies, but it does have some redeeming qualities. The story is far from original and it's not difficult to guess the entire plot after a few minutes. Despite that, some of the scenes are quite charming. It's fast-paced and doesn't contain any dull moments. I imagine younger children being captivated by Blu's adventures and the color scheme and ever-present Brazilian music is more than enough to hold their attention.

I enjoyed the story. Yes, I knew what was going to happen, but I found the characters quite likable. The animation becomes more detailed as the story progresses and some of the scenes contain incredible detail. The music is catchy and will be burned into your brain if you're not careful. This movie won't change your life, but it's an enjoyable way to spend 90 minutes.

Video Quality 5/5
The most obvious thing about the picture quality is the excellent use of color. The transfer boasts a variety of appealing colors and will capture your attention. The backgrounds seem a little unfinished in the opening scenes, but that's a stylistic choice and not a fault of the presentation. Later scenes, such as those in the Carnaval, are full of detail. You can clearly make out feathers and hairs on the various animals, and some of the scenery looks spectacular. This is a feast for the eyes and shouldn't disappoint anyone.

Audio Quality 5/5
The English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix matches the excellent video quality. The opening scene hints at what is to come and features a pounding Brazilian beat with a multitude of birds singing and squawking. Dialogue is clear throughout the movie and background sounds are frequently worked into the mix.

4380609,5,B004HO6I4M,"Filmmaker/animator Carlos Saldanha has brought success for Twentieth Century Fox with the various ""Ice Age"" films and while the films have been popular for FOX, many companies are quite competitive when it comes to theatrical films and when it comes to marketing, especially for a big budgeted animated film, you need all the push you can get.

And Saldanha's ""Rio"" (budgeted at $90 million) will definitely need that heavy marketing push.

With probably one of the most ingenuous collaborations in recent memory Twentieth Century Fox's tie-in with video game company Rovio, the creator of the immensely popular mobile game ""Angry Birds"".

Prior to the film, millions of people all over the world got their chance to play ""Angry Birds Rio"", a mobile video  game which has been downloaded over 10 million times.

With a successful tie-in with the game and bringing buzz to the animated film, ""Rio"" went on to make $476 million dollars in the box office.  A successful hit and Twentieth Century Fox and Rovio are back again, teaming up for a Blu-ray and DVD release (set for Aug. 2nd) which not only comes with the film on Blu-ray, DVD and digital copy but also has 15 bonus levels for ""Angry Birds Rio"".

VIDEO:

""Rio"" is presented in 1080p High Definition and is presented in widescreen (2:40:1).  As one would expect from a film that takes place in the jungle and many colorful birds being featured throughout the film, ""Rio"" looks absolutely vibrant on Blu-ray.  Colors galore!  Wonderful detail on the feathers and beaks of the birds, backgrounds and details of rocks to the buildings and even the interiors of the homes look great.

If there is one word to describe the picture quality of the film, that word would be ""colorful"".  Expect to see many colors pop throughout the film and for the most part, be content with its awesome picture quality!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Rio"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, English descriptive audio 5.1 Dolby Digital, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and French 5.1 Dolby Digital.

The film contains a lot of ambient noises that sound fantastic coming through the surround channels.  It's one thing to have samba musical sequences that sound crystal clear and lively coming from your home theater as there is good use of instruments from surround channels.  Front and center channels showcasing the dialogue and music is also crystal clear.

But the film does showcasing excellent ambiance and overall ""Rio"" has a pretty solid lossless soundtrack!

Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Rio"" comes with the following special features:

  Angry Birds Rio Trailer - (1:25) Trailer for ""Angry Birds Rio"".

EXTRAS:

""Rio"" comes with a slipcover case but also flyers to access the Rio ""Coloring with Blu"" app and a secret clue for one to unlock 15 new Rio levels on ""Angry Birds Rio"" via iPhone, iPad or Android.  ""Rio"" on Blu-ray also comes with a DVD and Digital Copy edition of the film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

There was no doubt in my mind when news broke out that Twentieth Century Fox would be collaborating with Rovio for ""Rio"" that the film would be successful.

It hasn't really been done before but its a true testament how the games ""Angry Birds"" on iPhones, Android cell phones and iPads have captured so many people's attention.  My family is absolutely addicted to the game and even to this day, they continue to play ""Angry Birds"", ""Angry Birds Seasons"" and ""Angry Birds Rio"".

And for my son and my nephew, because of the tie-in with Angry Birds, before ""Rio"" was shown in theaters, it's all they talked about.  They had to see ""Rio"" and they had to play ""Angry Birds Rio"".

So, the collaboration between Twentieth Century Fox and Rovio was fantastic and it's one thing to say that because the film is from the creators of ""Ice Age"" that the film would be a success but lately, animated films are becoming much more competitive and even the big studios have had significant misses as of late for films that they would have expected to be a blockbuster hit.

The thing is that with today's economy and the many animated films that are available, the animated films need some major marketing push beyond fast food ""Kids Meals"" and the fact that ""Angry Birds Rio"" is still at this time a continuing game that introduces new gameplay and levels every few months, ""Angry Birds Rio"" is here to stay for now.

So, it was no surprise that ""Rio"" did succeed in the box office, it was an incredible collaboration.

And sure enough, Twentieth Fox and Rovio has done it once again for this Blu-ray release.  Not only do you get the Blu-ray, DVD and digital copy, there is also ""Angry Birds"" content and also a code to get 15 new levels for ""Angry Birds Rio"".  In fact, prior to my reviewing this Blu-ray release, once the title came up and Angry Birds was shown on the menu, my son and nephew went crazy and wanted to see all the ""Angry Birds"" content first.

So, once again, good timing on both companies parts of collaborating once again to grab that ""Angry Birds"" demographic.

With that being said, the animated film was definitely fun!  Jesse Eisenberg did a great job at providing the voice of the awkward Blu and Anne Hathaway is just a wonderful actress period and she does a great job voicing the role of Jewel.  And you also get quite a bit of talent participating in this film such as George Lopez, Jamie Foxx, Will.i.am, Wanda Sykes, Jane Lynch, Leslie Mann, Jake T. Austin, etc.

The story is fun and enjoyable, colorful and vibrant on Blu-ray.  Also, the audio is wonderful with the music and the use of the ambiance of the environment of the jungle and Rio.

And as for special features, there is a good number of them on Blu-ray but while they are not necessarily long, the addition of the ""Angry Birds Rio"" extra levels is a significant plus for the millions of hardcore fans of the game.  So, it gives people an extra incentive to purchase this Blu-ray release.

Overall, ""Rio"" is a highly enjoyable, family fun animated film!  The Blu-ray release is absolutely jam-packed and ""Angry Birds Rio"" fans are definitely going to want to pick up ""Rio"" on Blu-ray.

As a musician, I was first seduced by the marvelous soundtrack this movie has - although there are some differences in Brazilian edition, making me a little bit disappointed -, making me eager to buy the Blu-Ray + DVD + Digital Copy version. Yes, this movie is entertaining, even more with Brazilian voices, dubbing the movie making it funnier than its original dialog.
There are some things appearing in the movie that doesn't really belong to Rio de Janeiro: First it's impossible to have a clandestine airport here. There ain't no enough space for this. If Carlos Saldanha showed about other regions of Brazil, I'd agree, specially inside Amazon and Midwest region, that makes frontiers with other south American countries.
Second, a blue macaw is not natural of this region. We don't have toucans in Rio, either. Yes, you can keep the canaries, but whatthahell is a cockatoo doing in Brazil? It's NOT a bird from here.
Third, yes, we have Tijuca forest here, but it is an urban forest where anyone can visit and it's hard to find a snake, for instance.
Fourth: Yes, we do have marmosets circulating, but only in Tijuca forest or Urca. When I studied in the university I saw marmosets every time through the window, walking in the electric wires from the lampposts. But HERE IT IS NOT INDIA. They are NOT trained to rob anything from humans, as baboons do there.
Fifth: If someone thought you can enter a slum (favela) wihtout permission, you're totally wrong, except those who were pacified by police recently. The drug dealers - traffickers - still dominate some hills here (You can come to the World Cup or Olympic Games, though, because these areas are clean!).
And finally, whatthahell is that bikini model appeared in the movie? I know it was a request from the producers - the money people - but, let's be honest, American bikinis look like diapers (!) It's funny how in American culture everybody show their booties for fun - when it doesn't appear something worse - and then when a Brazilian bikini is shown it is labeled indecent? I really do not understand... What a scandal, for God's sake!...
Now, talking about positive points of the movie: I think Carlos Saldanha created a high positive image of Rio, even more here really it's high positive place to come, not only for the natural beauties but also for its people and the place itself. The movie has some funnier moments and I think the soundtrack brought the ideal energy this place brings, a mix of samba and techno beat music - or do you think we only dance samba around here? At night Rio people - cariocas - love to go to the clubs to shake to electronic beats.
To finish, if you did not see this motion pic, then take a peakaboo. In the end it's worth it.

The movie is about two birds who are amongst the last of their species and are expected to mate.  The birds then get kidnapped and struggle to escape.

My kids give it 5 Stars and can't wait to have their own copy.  They loved all of the characters--even mean, old Nigel--as their personalities are just as colorful and varied as what is viewed on-screen.

Rio opens in a South American jungle with a baby blue macaw who falls from his nest and is immediately snatched by poachers, who take him to the US--Minnesota, to be precise. When his crate falls off a truck in the snow, the frightened, shivering little guy is found by a young girl, Linda, who takes him home with her.

Fast forward fifteen years: Linda (voiced by Leslie Mann), now an adult, owns a bookstore. The macaw, Blu (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg, whose sister, Hallie, coincidentally, shared the screen with another talking bird, Paulie), is her constant companion. All is well in their lives until the arrival of Tulio, an ornithologist from Brazil. He explains that Blu is the last male of his species, and he's needed in Brazil to mate with the last female to perpetuate the species. Linda initially refuses, in spite of Tulio's insistence that the future of the blue macaw is at stake. Finally, she changes her mind and they're en route to Rio.

They arrive as the city is preparing for Carnivale. It's not love at first sight for Blu and the female macaw, Jewel (voice of Anne Hathaway, one of my favorite actresses). She's a beautiful but feisty creature bent on regaining her freedom. Left alone to get acquainted, she's focused on her jailbreak--until they're both snatched by a young boy, Fernando, working for a smuggler.

Being forced to work together to escape isn't easy for the wild Jewel and domesticated Blu, who can't fly! I love the way she refers to him as ""pet,"" as if it's a dirty word. Jewel has quite a temper.

Blu and Jewel manage to escape their captors--but chained together, they initially find themselves bickering most of the time. As you might expect, however, they soon begin to warm to each other. Assisted by several other birds and a bulldog (voice of George Lopez), they no sooner are freed from the chain that's held them together than Jewel is again captured.

Meanwhile, as they search frantically for the missing birds, bookish Linda and hopelessly nerdy Tulio bond. Helped by the guilt-ridden orphan boy who stole them to start with, they end up chasing the smugglers into the big Carnivale parade. There, Linda and Blu see each other...but Blu chooses to go after the smugglers' truck, to rescue Jewel.

Linda and Tulio race to the airstrip but are too late. The plane takes off in spite of their efforts to stop it. Blu manages to free all of the birds from their cages and open the cargo doors, but finds he's the only one who can't fly away. Jewel refuses to leave him and is injured in a fight with evil cockatoo Nigel, who works for the smugglers.

Will Blu find the courage to fly and save himself and Jewel? Will he and Linda return to Minnesota...or will Linda find happiness with Tulio and Fernando and stay in Rio? Will Blu and Jewel save their species with a new generation of blue macaws? It's worth seeing Rio to find out!",1308528000,8,3005,4.624765478424015

--------------------------------
I didn't have high hopes for this one, and was still disappointed with what I got.  Weak characters, cookie-cutter plot, borderline racism in the presentation of the Brazilian characters and, worst of all, the samba was way, way watered down.  I mean, seriously... if you're going to do a movie set in Brazil, play some real samba music, not the bland R&B mix this film wallows in.  Also, did Tracy Morgan really have to be the voice of the Brazilian everyman -- er, bird -- gettin' all funky with his natural self and acting all street and spouting all that tacky, dated slang?  Are there no Brazilians to hire for these roles?  Sure, there's hip-hop culture in Brazil, but was it really necessary to present such a North Americanized version of it in an attempt to make this film, I dunno... more accessible to some imaginary version of an American audience that couldn't handle the Brazilians seeming more Brazilian?  It's just one aspect of a general tepidness that drags this film down... Some pretty colors, but otherwise a rather leaden production, with a predictable plot that just drags itself to the finish line as we wait and wait and wait for it to be over.  I suppose if the music had been better, I might not have been so annoyed, but as it was, this flick evaporated from my mind the moment we left the theatre.  3.5 would be about the right rating.

The story is predictable however, and that is the only thing that keeps it from being 5-star.

Note that I didn't say ""take flight."" Although Jewel, the female, has all the usual skills of a jungle-born bird, Blu's urban lifestyle has left him with the flying ability of a penguin. The story proceed predictably through trials and adventures, good guys and bad guys, and plenty of visual humor, down to the end you pretty much expected all along.

A little of depth about these exotic birds that are endangered by the smugglers who capture them away to sell them in the big cities of the developed countries, here the USA, and even Minnesota. But no real police work against the smugglers, just a union of the victims and bird lovers to just prevent them from succeeding, in other words to make them fail.

The most astonishing side of the film is the luminous vision of Rio de Janeiro and its carnival. If you have never been there go next week and spend some time on the beaches and try to go to the top of the big sugarloaf mountains and meet the Christ standing at the top of the tallest of them. That's a perfect strategy for an emergent country today that has been the target of the latest but not last crisis and that has been able to get out of it even stronger than before. Conquer the world not only with money, certainly not with weapons and bombs, but with culture. That's how the Americans did it after World War II.

That's a lesson to us, in the developed countries too. We take for granted that our languages and our cultures are dominant, and they are not. In a few years a language emerges as more important than ours and an emerging culture becomes a top attraction and agent at the global level.

This is a simple animated film for children who are going to love the monkeys and the birds, but they are also going to be nicely demonstrated that you do not need to be white or black, that all shades of grey are great, and that birds are so much better off and nicer in their natural environment. So do not hesitate and take your children - and grandchildren - to see it and buy the DVD. The music is great and will teach you how to shake your arms and legs and to move your bottom in rhythm, I mean you the adults and parents and grandparents because the children of today have it in their genes.

4380630,4,B004HO6I4M,"The best single word I can use to describe the film Rio is 'vibrant' as it's the colors that really hit you.  One can see why, when you're doing a story about birds, setting it in Brazil with its dazzling variety of brilliantly multicolored avian species is a truly inspired choice.

The story begins when a baby blue macaw in the Brazilian rain forest falls (literally) into the hands of exotic animal poachers and ends up being shipped to the US where, by a fortunate accident, he ends up being adopted by a young girl named Linda in a small town in, of all places, wintry Minnesota.  A quick flash forward shows girl and bird, which she names Blu, growing up together, to fifteen years later where Linda is now an adult who owns her own bookstore. The thing is though, Blu, raised as a house-bird, never learned how to fly.

The plot really begins when a Brazilian ornithologist named Tulio comes to Linda's store, having learned from her web-site that she's the owner of Blu, who apparently is one of the last male blue macaws in the world. Despite getting off on the wrong foot with Linda, he eventually persuades her to come with him to Brazil so that they can mate Blu with a female blue macaw named Jewel that they've managed to capture. Once there, however, the mating plan hits a snag as Jewel wants only to escape back to her jungle and has nothing but disdain for Blu, who only wants to get back with his human.  Further complications set in when both birds are stolen by exotic animal black-marketeers who intend to sell them to the highest bidder. The two birds, though chained together, manage to escape, but it's rough going, particularly when Jewel discovers that Blu can't fly and she can't fly away while she's chained to him, and the bird thieves are hot on their trail, right in the middle of Brazil's biggest and most flamboyant of all festivals, Carnival.

Director/writer Carlos Saldanha goes the distance in bringing some authentic Brazilian touches to the film. I particularly liked the way in which he brought out how everyone in Brazil is soccer-crazy, with good guys and bad constantly being distracted whenever a game is on.

The themes are familiar ones - characters are thrust out of their familiar environments into ones they find strange and challenging, characters who don't get along but are stuck together learn to appreciate each other, danger threatens, help comes from unexpected quarters, fears are overcome, and so on - but the characters in Rio are engaging and the story-telling is well done so you just lean back and enjoy the show. And Rio is a true visual pleasure to watch just for the sheer vibrancy of its colors and for the exotic setting of Rio de Janeiro during Carnival.

The voice actors for the most part do a creditable job bringing their characters to life. The stand-outs are clearly Jesse Eisenberg (The Social Network) as Blu and Anne Hathaway (The Devil Wears Prada) as Jewel, who succeed in not only bringing out the individual personalities of the two macaws but also make you believe in the way the two birds gradually begin to accept and relate to each other. But Leslie Mann and Rodrigo Santoro are also exceptional as the humans Linda and Tulio, Mann for bringing out Linda's mix of independence and introvert and Santoro for Tulio's engagingly manic if clumsy extrovert.  Comedic actor Tracy Morgan has fun voicing Luiz, a Carnival-loving bulldog whose bark may be worse than his bite but whose drool trumps both. And Jermaine Clement (Flight of the Conchords) adds a deliciously nasty touch as the villainous cockatoo, Nigel.

(Note: I was wondering why a Brazilian cockatoo was talking with what sounded like an Australian accent, but I later found out that cockatoos are in fact of Australasian origin. So chalk up another point for Rio for being educational as well as entertaining.)

The songs are enjoyable if largely forgettable but nicely add to the Brazilian atmosphere. The stand-out exception is the song Nigel sings (as near as I can tell, it's simply called ""Nigel's Song"") where he explains why he is ""not a pretty bird"".  There seems to be some kind of rule, in recent years anyway, that in any animated musical film, the bad guys always get the best songs.

Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys beautifully colored  animation, engaging characters and good basic storytelling.",1304380800,83,4364,4.778220451527225
4380631,4,B004HO6I4M,"Computer animated films from the past 10 or so years have either been super hits based on a terrific storyline and creativity, or have suffered wannabeitis, wanting to be like the best but falling short bigtime. For every Finding Nemo theres at least 3 movies like A Shark's tale. For every Shrek, theres an Unhappily Ever After. Rio is a rare film that falls in the middle, with it being decidedly predominant on the better side of the animation equation.

The reason the film works is due in large part to the overall fun aspect of Carnivale in Rio and the strong bond of loyalty Blu has for his owner. Sure its storybook friendship, but here that's ok. There is also that awkwardness of environment background theme going on for blu that clearly borrows from Madagascar, but it's not a beat the joke to death kind of thing. At all the right moments, Blu is simply out of his element making for some cleverly done moments and only on occasion does it get slapsticky, which makes for great surprise laughs you didn't expect.

Visually, the movie is a dream to behold. If you have ever wanted to go to Rio, this film will make you want it even more, something that's a pretty lofty acheivement for a kids animated film.

What is unfortunate is the over-urban feel at times with characters taking on R & B personas (not surprising since they are voiced by R & B stars) but I am of the mind that a movie doen't have to include a smattering of bad R & B song or lifestyle reminders either hinting at or dead on delivered in an animated film to make it seem more cool. The film succeeds enough in that department on its own merit due to the enormously creative team who put it together. Overall, this urbanization seems misplaced in just about any animated film, yet we are seeing more and more of it sneaking into films where it clearly doesn't belong. I for one, don't go to a movie to hear what I already am surrounded by at all turns on the radio and tv. Movies are supposed to be an escape, a quality becoming more and more left behind each year in ALL films.

Still, that one shortcoming aside, Rio is a visually delightful film that does it's best to tell a simple but engaging story that never beats you over the head with 'overkill' moments, especially at the finale. Sometimes, pure fun is all you need, and Rio has plenty of that. Overall: 4.5 out of 5",1303948800,6,2359,4.4036697247706424
4380632,4,B004HO6I4M,"Having a six-year-old means having to be really careful when making movie choices. When we saw the trailers for Rango, my husband and I realized that it was not for a six-year-old, and then Hop came along. It seemed like a kid-friendly movie, but none of us enjoyed it, not even my bunny-loving child. So, when I saw the trailer for Rio, I was predictably wary. The long Easter weekend convinced us to give it a try (for want of something better to do). I am so glad we watched this delightful movie - the vibrant colors, the exotic setting, and quirky set of characters make this an enjoyable family-friendly movie.

Rio is the story of Blu (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg), a cerulean male macaw, who finds himself taken away from his native habitat and about to be sold at a pet store somewhere in Minnesota. Luckily for him, a young girl named Linda (the adult Linda is voiced by Leslie Mann) finds him and cares for him. The pair form a very close bond until an ornithologist, Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro) comes along and convinces Linda that Blu, being the last male of his species, needs to mate with his female counterpart to keep his kind alive.

Linda and Blu go off to Rio in Brazil where Carnival is in full swing, and amidst all of the celebrations, Blu finds himself falling for the lovely Jewel (Anne Hathaway), his female counterpart. Jewel is fiercely independent and resents being confined in a cage, and is determined to find freedom. Over the course of the movie, the pair find themselves being kidnapped by criminals specializing in the capture and sale of exotic birds, and facing down an evil nemesis in the form of an ugly white cockatoo named Nigel (Jemaine Clement). The rest of the story focuses on their escape attempts while Linda and Tulio try to find them.

The movie is kid-friendly with one exception - the baddie in this show, i.e. Nigel is actually quite creepy and frightened my daughter who is usually not very sensitive about such things. Nigel's appearance is quite evil-looking and scary, and coupled with his effectively creepy voice, the effects are quite frightening for young children, so parents may want to take note of this.
Otherwise, the movie is pure fun - the songs are OK, not incredibly catchy or memorable, but the colors and setting more than make up for these flaws. The chemistry between the two macaws, Blu and Jewel drive the movie and make it an interesting watch for both adults and kids. Final verdict - highly watchable and fun family entertainment!",1303603200,6,2502,4.681818181818182
4380633,3,B004HO6I4M,"The movie was entertaining enough.  It wasn't as good as the Shrek movies or even Blue Sky's other movies like Ice Age, Robots or Horton Hears a Who, but it was good enough.
The animation was nice and colorful.  It did have some moments wear you'd laugh out loud.  It had a good voice cast and some good musical numbers.  The only thing wrong with this movie is that there are way too much characters they wanted to put the spotlight on.  I mean, you have the main birds, Blu and Jewell, but they get overpowered by George Lopez' character along with Will.i.am and Jaime Foxx.  Not to mention that there are 3 different plots going on all at once which makes it hard for character development.  The moments with the poachers who kidnap Blu and Jewell and the parts with the annoying parrot Nigel could have been cut down significantly with keeping the same idea because I thought they brought down the movie.  Anne Hathaway, who is one of my favorite actresses of all time doesn't really too much to do as Jewell, even when she finally sings, Will.i.am and Jaime Foxx have to come in and rip some cool techno beats.

4380634,3,B004HO6I4M,"20th Century Fox has given us the likes of Fantastic Mr. Fox, Horton Hears a Who, and, of course, the Ice Age films as far as animated films go. While I did thoroughly enjoy both Fantastic Mr. Fox and Horton Hears a Who, both films were adapted from novels. Despite usually having stunning animation, original animated films created by 20th Century Fox like Ice Age lack something Pixar films such as Up, WALL-E, Ratatouille, and the Toy Story films utilize in the best of ways. Unfortunately, Rio, despite its best efforts, seems to continue this trend.

Rio manages to make its visuals its most cherished attribute. The 3-D animated adventure is intensely rich with spectacular color as every frame of the film is filled with nothing but the most bright and brilliant hues. Calling the film eye candy, in this case, would be nothing more than a compliment for a film like this. It is definitely the most vivid animated film in recent memory. With films these days, everything is so focused on being dark and serious while bright colors are replaced with various shades of gray and gloomy shadows. Rio's dynamic use of color practically makes it a happy film in tone right off the bat and is a welcome change of pace.

However, everything else about the film either left something to be desired or was executed improperly. The finale seems to be wrapped up so quickly. It's been building to this moment right here for an hour and a half. For everything to culminate so hastily followed by an even faster epilogue made it all feel very rushed. Rio also doesn't take the necessary steps to build foundation into your emotions either. Every time it touches on a heart wrenching moment for one of the talking animals we've grown attached to, it seems like it jumps back to silly shenanigans too quickly for it to make any sort of impact on you. Then there's the humor of the film that's really touch and go. It'll probably be fun for most kids, but adults weren't the ones filling the theater with uproarious laughter. The animated film's content is more cute or charming than hilarious or groundbreaking.

Most of the voices fit the characters really well. Blu is Jesse Eisenberg and vice versa, George Lopez's humor just drips from Rafael's feathers, and Tracy Morgan fits Luiz like a glove. However, Jemaine Clement's voice work for Nigel may have stolen the show. His song is the most enjoyable on the soundtrack and the Nigel character is just one that you love to hate. Also, pretty much any scene involving the thieving marmosets is gold. Those marmosets are to Rio what the penguins are to Madagascar.

Rio is both fun and beautifully animated, but the film seems to lack the heart that makes Pixar films so great. 20th Century Fox delivers a film that looks just as good as the best Pixar films, but is only able to scratch the surface of your emotions when it matters most. The humor included in the film seems to fall flat more often than not, as well. It'll make you smirk at times, but nothing is really laugh out loud funny. In the end, Rio is still an amusing animated adventure that's suitable for the entire family but adult viewers may walk away slightly disappointed.",1303084800,33,3183,4.668449197860962

4380637,3,B004HO6I4M,"Rio is getting tie-ins everywhere, fast food, video games and it's all over the most popular social networks. This can only mean one thing: Rio needs a big backhomer* warning! And after the recent, wonderful for adults, Rango, and the wonderful for adults and kids, Despicable Me, and the wonderful for kids, Hop, Rio has its work cut out to be THE Easter blockbuster.

Unfortunately, for everything Rio does well it gets a dozen things wrong; it doesn't even flow, let alone fly.

5 stars for Jermaine Clement (Flight of the Conchords) as nasty Nigel and for his song, it's the undoubted highlight of Rio.

4 stars for the rest of the music, there is something Jungle Book-esque about the way music permeates Rio, and 4 stars for the sumptuous, sunny visuals but that is almost to be expected from animations these days. In many cases the animation is the gloss over the cracks of the rest of the movie and just because there's lots of colour and movement, it doesn't necessarily mean that anything good is happening.

3 stars for 3-D which again is proving not to be the future of entertainment but just another cash grab. The vibrancy and vividness of Rio make for some wonderful effects but the point is you don't MISS the 3-D when viewing in 2-D.

2 stars for story, young kids will love it but most over 8s will have seen similar a dozen or so times already in their lives. Rio doesn't exactly copy and paste from other movies (Madagascar excepted) but the plot is as formulaic as it's possible to be.

And 1 star, ultimately, for just being a very lazy and clichd movie. There's little to actually recommend here, nothing is particularly defined. The bad guys aren't especially so, apart from Nigel. The stooges and support are direct from some kind of off-the-peg central casting for comedic support. The Rio backdrop is vivid and delightful but there is no sense of this actually being Brazil. The story is a mish-mash with no real threat or terror involved. And the movie as a whole is all rather thrown together: lots of scenes and lots of imagination, vital ingredients, but the resultant concotion is more collapsed souffl than magnificent meringue.

Finally, i really should dock a star for the way Nigel met his end. Completely out of character with the rest of the film and not a fitting end for such a memorable villain.

So, fantastic and vibrant visuals, formualic and flat story. 3 stars: Well average!

4380638,3,B004HO6I4M,"""TEN out of ten for style, but minus several million for good thinking,"" as Zaphod Beeblebrox might say, to the marketers of Rio, or whoever it was who conceived the strapline ""this turkey can't fly"".

Well, you're asking for it, aren't you. And for no reason: Blu, the flightless bird in question, isn't even a turkey. So I attended the screening in Leicester Square, armed with discerning co-critics in the shape of my children, and figured that, worst case, at least I had a title for my review.

The kids enjoyed it happily enough. I didn't. It wasn't a turkey, as such - Turkeys are fun to watch the same way Candid Camera is - but more of a damp, er, squab. (Sorry folks). For any parent who has owned a DVD player in the last decade, Rio will feel very, very, tiringly familiar.

I like reviewing. I take it seriously, and I try to come up with a novel angle and provide new and thoughtful remarks for each picture I see. This is sometimes hard, but on occasions like this, it makes me positively resentful: why should I expend imaginative thought on reviewing a picture when the film makers themselves didn't bother when making the damn thing? Why don't I just create a review-by-numbers?

Now it's no secret that Hollywood has a ""magic formula"" for its successful dramas, bequeathed to it fifty or more years ago by Joseph Campbell in a still-referenced book called ""The Hero With A Thousand Faces"". Indeed, it has been suggested that there are only seven basic plots in all of literature. Certainly, most popular commercial films (even serious ones) cleave more or less closely to one of these fictional archetypes.

But of late this adherence to formula seems to have gone to a whole new place, especially in this new genre, the digitally animated children's movie. It's a genre I declare officially mature, established and subject to rapidly advancing decrepitude. Rio (and Mars Needs Moms) are my evidence for that claim.

Nowadays it is not just plot but scene, casting, characterisation, colourisation and disposition that are done by rote: you fancy someone at Disney has drawn up something like a pilot's checklist for script vetting. Each new offering at most adds a new trope or contrivance to the library of available memes. As the library grows, the more memes there are to chose from, of course, and the less incentive there is to create new ones. The assembly of a film in this way becomes modular; a matter of supply-chaining.

So it is with Rio. It is a classic journey of self discovery. Blu, a Brazilian macaw hatchling, is snatched from his nest and whisked away to captivity far from his native land (cf.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Finding-Nemo/dp/B00007KGCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Finding Nemo</a>). He even has a Nemo-esque physical disability: he can't fly.

Of course, he winds up back in Rio, and there contrives to meet a truculent paramour (cf.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stuart-Little/dp/B000CEVVIO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stuart Little</a>), be captured (again) by dastardly but inept animal traffickers (cf.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Garfield/dp/B001GN1SWE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Garfield</a>), escape with the help of fellow captured animals (cf.

Stuart Little again), confront his fears, fall in love, while his owner falls in love too, and confronts her fears, and so on and so on.

This is accompanied (or interrupted) by a set piece so strikingly resemblant of the jungle boogie in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Madagascar/dp/B0009PAPL0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Madagascar</a>&nbsp;that the litigious type might sue over it. Even Avatar is scene-checked. All this in the context of a dull script, badly delivered jokes, and adventure/chase set pieces designed to show off the technical department's digital wizardry (fellas, we get the picture: you can do cool stuff with computers. How about doing some cool stuff with celluloid?) that have the wit and wisdom of your average seven year old.

Admittedly, this is aimed at your average seven-year-old but, as Pixar has shown repeatedly, that's no reason a film can't be brilliantly funny for all ages.

In a poor game there is still a man-of-the-match performance from Flight of The Conchords' Jemaine Clement as Nigel, a baddie cockatoo - one of the more convincing screen villains of recent times.

I can't deny my children were entertained (by comparison they were positively aggravated by Mars Needs Moms). Therefore it isn't, in all honesty, a turkey. But it doesn't fly.
