8059013,4,B0009CTT7E,"In ""Angelina Ballerina: Angelina's Princess Dance"", Angelina is tasked by Ms Lilly, her dance instructor [Dame Judi Dench] to direct a ballet production of Sleeping Beaty at Queen Seraphina's palace with the two princesses in the show. Young cousin Henry tries to help out too. However, Angelina faces some obstacles - she not only has to build up her confidence, but manage bad behavior [from the two princesses] and try to put on a good show. Angelina learns some valuable lessons in the process, i.e. how to be responsible and be a good leader.

My 4-year-old loves the Angelina Ballerina stories, and also the animated series. As with all other books and shows, it is advisable to watch it with younger children so that parents may discuss important themes/issues with their children. Angelina does not exhibit the best behavior at times - she has fibbed,lied and been rude - but many young children go through these phases and it's important for parents to discuss these aspects in the show with their kids. The series is fun and entertaining, and contains lessons as well.",1240790400,,1078,4.890710382513661

8059015,2,B0009CTT7E,"Our daughter loves the ""Angelina Ballerina"" books by Katherine Holbird and Helen Craig, and when we decided to start letting her watch TV, this was one of the first titles I thought would be good for her to watch... Unfortunately, the cartoons are *very* different from the books, in an entirely negative way.

Most alarming of all is how whiny, self-centered and deceitful Angelina is -- almost every episode involves her telling a fib and then having to make up for it.  This is horrible role modeling for younger children, particularly since she KEEPS LYING from episode to episode -- there's no character growth, just Angelina being dishonest over and over again, until she gets caught or her conscience catches up with her.  I'm also not fond of the ultra-competitiveness shown between Angelina and the other characters.  In the books, Angelina always gets the lead role, but she is considerate of others, and shares the spotlight generously.  By contrast, these cartoons show a never-ending series of backstabbing and manipulation... The supporting characters, including Angelina's friends, are made more flawed and unlikable than they are in the books.  Alice, for example, is transformed from a perfectly nice little girl into a clumsy, fat, self-pitying hanger-on who is embarassed and envious of Angelina's success.  The Pinkpaw twins are new characters who seem to have been invented just to be bad guys -- they try to sabotage Angelina at every turn -- and Angelina herself is far less likeable here than in the original books.  Frankly, I'm amazed that the book's author, Ms. Holabird, allowed such terrible, distorted versions of her stories to be produced.

The books are magical, but the TV shows left a bad taste in our mouths.  They are not on our ""safe to watch"" list anymore.  Parents who were charmed by the books might want to preview these cartoons first, before letting your kid soak them up... It would be a shame to let them ruin the books for your mouse-loving little ones.",1171843200,10,2000,4.958083832335329
8059016,4,B0009CTT7E,"True to the Angelina stories, this focuses on the role of a leader and how to treat others.  Angelina models effective problem solving techniques while providing children with an engaging story.  The range of age groups represented (Henry, Angelina and Miss Lily) also allows children to view the situation from a variety of perspectives.  The story is a great conversation starter for 5-6 year olds:  ""What would you try next?""  ""Why do you think she reacted that way?""  ""Why are they upset?""  My [...] daughter and [...] son can both enjoy this video.",1156550400,4,553,4.881720430107527
