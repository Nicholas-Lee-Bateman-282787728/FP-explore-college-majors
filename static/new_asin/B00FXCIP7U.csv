6035590,5,B00FXCIP7U,"This is a great cardio workout and it doesn't bore me. I didn't think I would enjoy this DVD as much as some others I have in my collection, but I find myself using it at least once a week or more with my DVD rotation. Most cardio DVDs are just about 1/2 hour - this one is longer and I like that. The weight loss cardio mix is about 45-50 mins long and sometimes feels longer during those last 10 minutes. I haven't gotten through both the total body tune up & the weight loss cardio together yet. It is just too long to do at once. I really am sweating after these workouts and feel great afterwards. I like the variety of moves offered and good mix of intervals - keeps me motivated. The only ""con"" would be that they should separate the workout options on the DVD menu like - 1. Total Body Tune Up (with warm up & cool down) 2. Weight Loss Cardio (with warm up & cool down) 3. Both workouts (including warm up & cool down).  I don't like having to go back and forth on the menu to get the workout I want (not a deal breaker at all though - still a good DVD)",1406505600,17,1061,3.9812206572769955

6035594,3,B00FXCIP7U,"I love Jessica Smith as a trainer.  She's easy to follow and incorporates a variety of work out styles into her routines. That being said, this is NOT one of my favorites from her. I much prefer her cardio abs dvd over this one.  Personal preference, but it's my opinion.",1396396800,,271,4.4
6035595,4,B00FXCIP7U,"Total body tune-up and weight loss cardio mix are both great workouts and Jessica as usual is a wonderful instructor.  However, I have been using Better Body Blast and Total Body Balance before I bought these and confess that I wasn't as impressed by this DVD as I was by her newer ones.  That's not to say that these don't kick your butt, because they do!  I've been exercising fairly regularly for almost a year (thanks to Jessica!) and was surprised by how difficult I found these workouts to be.  They are doable but after the cardio weight loss mix I was sore for days, which is rare.  My main criticism with that segment is that it isn't as easy to follow as most of Jessica's videos are.  It's very dance-like and for a klutz like me I needed more cueing.  The moves switched so rapidly that I was lost  half of the time.  I loved the toning and corset abs portions of the cardio mix, though, and I think that in time I'll be able to manage the other parts of it.  Total body tune-up is just what it says it is: weights that target every part of your body and cardio intervals.  This is a more advanced workout than Jessica's other DVDs and I guess I wasn't expecting that!  The production quality wasn't the best but it didn't distract me in the least.  If you're a fan of Jessica this DVD is a must despite some minor flaws and I'm happy that she decided to re-release it!",1395446400,4,1381,4.285714285714286

6035612,2,B00FXCIP7U,"I have another Jessica Smith workout (10 minute solution: Knockout Body), and I like her style a lot, so I had high hopes for this. I was disappointed. It seems to have been done a shoestring budget: terrible lighting, poor videoing, bad music. The exercises themselves are alright, but they're somewhat tedious and repetitive. The only good part is Jessica herself who is clear and upbeat without being annoyingly peppy. I'd recommend her Knockout Body DVD, but not this one.",1462838400,3,476,4.9625

6035637,2,B00FXCIP7U,I am a huge fan of Jessica's but after watching this DVDI was in agreement with some of the reviewer's that it was for a more advanced  student and people who have knee issues shouldn't get this tape because there's a lot of jumping around that's why I gave it a OK rating,1447113600,2,272,4.132075471698113
6035638,3,B00FXCIP7U,"I admit, I was a bit confused by this DVD.  This is a set with both 10 Pounds Down ""Total Body Tune Up"" and ""Weight Loss Cardio"" on the same DVD.  The minimal chapter menu listed both workouts, but it gave no idea of the times, breakdowns, etc., so it took me awhile to figure out which workout I was doing, especially since both contain cardio and toning work, and it's not really clear when you switch from one to the other.  My review of each workout is below.

TOTAL BODY TUNE-UP

Total Body Tune-Up features Jessica Smith working out alone in a gym room with a sort of waterfall water feature in the background; behind that, you can catch glimpses of gym members exercising, which I found distracting.  She begins here with a 5-minute warm-up that includes moves such as knees and curtseys.  For the weighted work, Smith performs two sets of most exercises, usually with some type of alternate move in between (such as push-ups), although this was not consistent (which was one of the things that I didn't really like).  Most of the moves are compound, such as curtsey with twist and overhead press and a lunge forward with wide plie.  Between the strength sets, Smith does cardio intervals.  The majority of these were high impact--e.g., split jumps, hop squats, squat thrusts (aka Burpees), mountain climbers--with no modifications offered; if anything, Smith encourages you to push harder and go higher.

There is not a separate abs segment in this workout; rather, core work is incorporated throughout.  At about the 24-minute point, Smith has you on the floor for a chest press with hip lift, leg lowers to work the abs, and then flies with hip lifts.  This is followed by some moves on the stomach, including supermans and wide push-ups.  However, then you are coming back to standing for triceps presses and other moves.  I didn't like this sudden transition, and overall, this workout felt ""fussy"" to me.  This might be a good choice for someone who enjoys strength/cardio intervals and who doesn't mind high impact work as well as a lot of complex moves.

WEIGHT LOSS CARDIO

In the Weight Loss Cardio workout, I didn't realize until the very end that there is only actually about 40 minutes of cardio; there is an additional segment called ""Total Body Toners"" that lasts about 24 minutes, and finally, there is a 4.5 minute cool-down segment.  The cardio begins with a 6-minute warm-up that consists of moves such as side taps, hamstring curls, and some light stretching (it was hard to see what Smith was doing here).  Smith continues with some alternating side taps, but then she makes things more complicated by adding both movement and directional changes.  There are a few boxing moves, which I enjoyed because this was low-impact, but then Smith made this high-impact by throwing jumping jacks on the end, which I hate.  The next segment was also high impact with scissors, skiers, and jumping rope; Smith provided NO modifications for the impact moves.  There were a few more boxing moves and what felt like starting to move into a cool-down, but then suddenly Smith brought the tempo back up again!

There is no cool-down after the cardio, as Smith goes right into the Total Body Toners segment.  She starts here with just a few standing moves such as plies, but she then moves to the floor for additional Pilates-like moves.  Part of this segment is what she calls ""Corset Abs,"" and it includes Pilates-like abs work such as frog, leg circles, leg extensions, and v-sits.  I could certainly see how some would like this workout, especially if you enjoy hi-impact cardio with a good deal of variety, but it wasn't for me.

Jessica Smith is a solid, enthusiastic instructor, but I find her DVDs to be hit or miss.  This set was a miss for me, although others who enjoy complicated moves and higher impact cardio may like it.  For now, I'll stick with the free workouts on Smith's YouTube channel.",1445126400,15,3918,4.744460856720827

6035671,3,B00FXCIP7U,"I'm a huge fan of Jessica Smith. This is obviously one of her early productions. On the whole, I would classify it as an intermediate/advanced circuit workout--and I was dripping with sweat before I was halfway through it. My only real problem is that some of the combination moves were just overly complex and they could cause someone to pull a tendon in the knee or thigh. Not my favorite workout, but I'll try to modify them when I come across it in my rotation.",1441497600,,465,4.482352941176471

6035673,5,B00FXCIP7U,"I love anything Jessica Smith. The cardio workout is intense, but the circuit training workout??? WHEW! It is no joke, believe me! It does get easier the more often you do it. The only thing that turns me off is the audio. Especially at the beginning. The music is straight up annoying and distracting as far as i'm concerned. I just keep at the workout anyway. I'm getting used to the audio.",1439856000,6,392,4.458333333333333
6035674,3,B00FXCIP7U,"it was good- but very advanced.  I am good, but not that good.  I truly believe it needs to be spelled out that this is for very advanced.  I only used it once.",1436313600,3,160,3.787878787878788
6035675,5,B00FXCIP7U,"Both of these workouts are fantastic!!  I consider myself intermediate (leaning towards advanced level), and these workouts were perfect for me. In my opinion, the Total Body Tune-Up is a lot harder than the Weight Loss Cardio Mix.  So, if you're a beginner I would suggest doing the Cardio workout a couple times before trying the Tune Up one. The cardio mix workout also has toning segments at the end, so it's not just all cardio.",1434844800,8,433,4.684210526315789
6035676,4,B00FXCIP7U,"I did the workout this morning and was pouring sweat but didn't feel overly tired - the queing is quite as good as Jessica's ""Walk On"" series but still a great workout.",1432598400,,168,4.28125
6035677,4,B00FXCIP7U,"Get ready to sweat. Choreography is simple enough and cueing is great. Sometimes a little too high impact for my taste, but no big deal. There are alternative moves. Overall, great workout!",1431907200,,189,4.9375
6035678,4,B00FXCIP7U,"Great workout sofar (I did the cardio routine, not the other one yet).  Lots of high impact moves but somehow it's still light on your feet.  The toning and abs segments were a bit advanced and more modifications would have been nice, but I sort of modified to my own level, and did less reps.  But as Jessica said, it's not a workout you may be able to complete, or do perfectly, at first.  So I'm working my way up to it.  Overall great workout though!",1429315200,,454,4.232558139534884

6035692,4,B00FXCIP7U,"I gave this 4 stars because while Total body Tune Up is 1 of my absolute favorite strength training workouts,I'm not crazy about the Cardio mix workout. I agree with another reviewer that it is a little fast&dancy for me and I feel uncoordinated! Besides Total Body Tune Up,I absolutely love the new Amy Dixon Dvd Breathless 4,which I received the same day as Jessica's dvd! I have an obsession with workout dvd's and do everything fr T25,Tonique,Tracy Anderson,UFC Fit and many more! I always say I won't buy any more but that never lasts!",1427241600,3,540,4.6947368421052635
6035693,5,B00FXCIP7U,"Fantastic, but hard!  I would recommend working your way up in this one slowly. Start with her beginner modifications and go from there.

Also some people commented on the music, I kind of like it, I think she mostly does a great job finding music to match the workout pace!",1425427200,9,348,4.476190476190476

6035696,4,B00FXCIP7U,"10 Pounds Down with Jessica Smith is very quick pace, high and low impact cardio and toning DVD.  The first work out is 30 minutes of cardio followed by approx. 15 minutes toning, approximately 10 minutes of abs and 5 minutes cool down.  I did not time the segments but that is the approximate length.  The second work out incorporates dumb bells.  I would not recommend this DVD for anyone with knee pain or problems as there are a lot of lunges and twists.  The cardio has lots of variety such as jumping jacks, jog, walk, side step, lunges, grape vine, plus so much more.  The varity keeps it interesting and fun.  I would rate this DVD for intermiate fitness level.  To give you an idea, I just jogged my first 5k and can workout to the cardio on this DVD.  However the ab section is very challenging.  I would rate abs as intermediate/advance.  I can't do all the abs but try to challenge myself to do as many as I can.  The only equipment needed for the first workout is a mat or towl for floor exercises.  I recommend this DVD and plan to purchase more from her.",1422921600,53,1069,4.311557788944723

Corset Abs: I thought since it was so quick, it would not be too difficult. I think that may have been the hardest 10 minutes of ab works I have done yet and I have done plenty of workout videos. I will say it is probably because most all of the moves were new to me! (Jessica is really good about putting unique moves in her strength videos).
DVD itself:  It is sectioned off into the two different DVD workouts but you have to scan to pick the workout you want within the two workouts, which I do not like. But I don't think it is that big of a deal.",1527120000,,760,4.033112582781457

8619152,4,B00FXCIP7U,"I agree with most other reviewers that this workout is no joke... it's very tough!  I'd call it an advanced workout -- I haven't done the cardio workout yet but I did the Total Body Tune Up two days ago and it was pretty intimidating.  At the end of the workout I honestly wasn't sure if I ever wanted to try it again.  Lots of squats, lunges and jumping.  Throughout the workout I kept wondering how much longer it could go on.  My legs were on fire and I wondered if I'd be able to walk stairs the next day.  And yes, I am still feeling it today, 2 days later.  I prefer workouts that don't have that ""dread factor"".  With my long commute I don't want something that could potentially add even more stress to my day.  I think I'm going to stick with my Jillian Michaels Ripped in 30 and 30 Day Shred.  I think they're *ALMOST* as effective and even though they are also pretty tough, the workout is over in 30 minutes and you still feel like you've exercised. I'll pull this out when I'm feeling extra ambitious... and that will probably be rarely... LOL",1498003200,,1056,4.261306532663316
