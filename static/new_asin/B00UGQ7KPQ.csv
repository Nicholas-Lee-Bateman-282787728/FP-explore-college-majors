TITLE: The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008)  PG-13  1:51:48
  Brendan Fraser, Jet Li, Maria Bello, Michelle Yeoh
  Rob Cohen (Director)

  The third time was most definitely NOT the charm. I think that this movie would have faired better at the box office if Universal had not tried to pass it off as part of the Mummy franchise  because, seen in that light, it is a pretty big disappointment. However, if one were to look at it as a stand alone movie, it's really NOT that bad (of course, unfortunately, it's really NOT that good either). This movie is a fairly decent action/adventure flick, with better-than-good special effects, better-than-average audio, and mostly O.K. acting. On its own, it is an acceptable movie  BUT, as part of the Mummy franchise, it is a BIG disappointment.

  See the other reviews for more detail and/or other opinions regarding the plot of the movie.

  The movie's image is reasonably sharp (without any obvious edge-enhancement), has very good contrast and has decent shadow detail (as seen in the dark and shadowy areas, such as in the dark scenes located in the emperor's tomb near the very the beginning of the movie, and in the big nighttime chase scene located near the middle of the movie). Also, while fine detail is frequently (though not always) evident in the brighter scenes and in many close-ups, the entire movie has an ever-so-slightly soft look about it (nothing, I'm sure, that a higher bit-rate couldn't have cured). Lastly, there are no obvious artifacts such as banding, specks, white dots, hair-lines or color fluctuations. Overall, this movie's presentation on blu-ray has good picture quality, and should satisfy most viewers.

AUDIO: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1

  The sound quality of the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack for this disc, was VERY good (not great, but still VERY good)  while, it is NOT amongst the very best examples of the art, it is still far superior to the vast majority of audio presentations out there. The film's dialog is clear and well placed, and the rear and side channels (I used the Dolby PLIIx mode on my processor while listening) are very active and fairly directional (as in the big nighttime chase scene located near the middle of the movie, that I referred to earlier, and in the fighting yetis scene located somewhat later in the movie); with clear, well recorded, sound cues and (on occasion) a goodly amount of bass. Overall, the audio for this movie is a pleasing affair, that should satisfy all but the VERY pickiest of listeners.
