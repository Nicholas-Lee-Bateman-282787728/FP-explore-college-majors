2408889,5,B000B8QG40,"The first time my four year old wanted to watch this, I was NOT looking forward to it at all....  Boy was I wrong.  The songs aren't all the instantly recognizable tunes you would think you'd hear, but they are great and they grow on you quick.  Even the songs I thought were sort of lame the first time I heard them have now become some of our favorites.  My younger daughter is not quite two and this is by far her favorite DVD.  This is basically a dvd of clean and catchy music videos and I'm so happy we own it.  I am planning on buying the first two dvd's to add to our collection.",1294963200,2,587,4.017241379310345

2408892,5,B000B8QG40,"This DVD has songs from the some of the sequels to the Disney Princess movies, two from the classic and one from Alice In Wonderland. The songs are first listened to and then, a letter from the princess of the movie the song is in is read. The letter explains what the message of the song is. Some of the messages are simple to understand while others may not be understood until the letter is read.

The songs and messages are:

""In Harmony"" from Disney's The Little Mermaid TV Series.
Song's message: Everyone is different and being different makes life fun and exciting.
""It's What's Inside That Counts"" from Cinderella II: Dreams Come True
Song's message: It's nice to look lovely on the outside and the outside counts a lot, but real beauty always comes from within and the inside is more important.
""Out of Thin Air"" from Aladdin and the King of Thieves
Song's message: Patience is something that everybody should learn, no matter how long it takes to learn it.
""A Little Thought"" from Beauty and the Beast: Belle's Magical World
Song's message: It's important to be thoughtful of others and forgive them no matter what because everyone makes mistakes and nobody is perfect. Not even princesses!
""Where Do I Go From Here"" from Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World
Song's message: Listen and consider everyone's advice, but listen to your heart as well.
""Whistle While You Work"" for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
Song's message: When you're cheerful in everything you do, you'll spread the cheer around and make others happy too.
""All in the Golden Afternoon"" from Alice in Wonderland
Song's message: Listen to what others are trying to tell you and don't be quick to criticize.
""The Work Song"" from Cinderella
Song's message: When you work together with others, the work becomes smaller and shorter.
""Belle"" from Beauty and the Beast
Song's message: Everyone likes and wants to be seen for who they truly are. That's the best way to see someone.
""Lesson Number One"" from Mulan II
Song's message: You have to be kind and gentle as well as brave and strong to be a leader.
""Here on the Land and Sea"" from The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea
Song's message: Sometimes two people may seem very different from each other, but they may actually be more alike than they think.
""It's Not Just Make Believe"" from Ella Enchanted (No letter)
Song's message: Imagination isn't make believe. It's real.",1208822400,18,2403,4.7326968973747015
2408893,5,B000B8QG40,My 2 year old daughter loves the Disney Princesses so we decided to get her this DVD.  She loves it and always asks us to play it for her when we get home from work.  Most of the songs are new to me from spin offs of the classic Disney Princess movies but the tunes are catchy and after listening to it several times the songs grow on you.,1202428800,5,339,3.898550724637681
2408894,4,B000B8QG40,"A welcome addition to your Disney DVD Sing Along Songs collection is this, the third Disney Princess Sing Along Songs DVD- Perfectly Princess.

With volume 2 we were invited to a Disney princess tea party. This time we are invited to read some letters from the various Disney princesses, and even some letters from some non-Disney princesses who are still considered part of the Disney princess family, as we sing along to the words on screen.

This time the songs included are:
In Harmony (Disney's The Little Mermaid tv series)
It's What's Inside That Counts (Cinderella II: Dreams Come True)
Out of Thin Air (Aladdin and the King of Thieves)
A Little Thought (Beauty & The Beast: Belle's Magical World)
Where Do I Go From Here (Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World)
Whistle While You Work (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs)
All in the Golden Afternoon (Alice in Wonderland)
The Work Song (Cinderella)
Belle (Beauty & The Beast)
Lesson Number One (Mulan II)
Here on the Land and Sea (The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea)
It's Not Just Make Believe (Ella Enchanted)

Therefore we are receiving letters from Ariel, Cinderella, Jasmine, Belle, Pocahontas, Snow White, Alice, Mulan and Melody.

Most of the songs in this collection are from the straight to video sequels and for the most part they are the best songs from those movies, and for those that have taken time to listen to them, some of the best and underrated Disney songs there are. Granted the songs from Cinderella II and Mulan II are pretty pointless, but there are some amazing Disney gems here. You may want to also note that the song from Ella Enchanted features no actual footage from that film, simply an animated Disney princess montage. Shame.

As to the bonus features, in addition to Karaoke the main thing here is the opportunity to write a letter to Ariel, Belle or Cinderella, and have them reply back to you. There are over 50 available possibilities- lots of fun for your little princess. A bit of a disappointment is that this time round we don't get the Dance Alongs- Dance Alongs were never part of Disney Sing Along Songs when they were originally released on VHS in the 1980s and 1990s, but have been integral to the new Disney DVD versions. They were a welcome new addition and it's a shame we may not see them anymore.

Finally we get a selection of Sneak Peeks, including to name a few- ""Lady & The Tramp"" 2-Disc Special Edition, probably the most underrated and best Winnie the Pooh movie ever ""Pooh's Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin"" and the upcoming 2-Disc Special Edition release of ""The Little Mermaid"". Definitely gives us something to look forward to.

So overall, this is a fun release for all, but in some ways it feels like a step down, and if we are to see a volume 4 of Disney Princess Sing Along Songs, I hope Disney decides to step up.",1140393600,85,2858,4.647524752475247
