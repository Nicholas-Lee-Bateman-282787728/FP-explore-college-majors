5114233,5,B007XNAQPG,"I just watched the DVD Release on Facebook and this was well worth the wait!!!  I finally got to see Duran Duran in concert last year (twice) after being a full fledged Duranie for 30+ years and these guys did not disappoint!!!  This DVD captures the excitement of their live shows and takes you right back.  It gives me such a thrill to think back to all those who said DD was a flash in the pan and would disappear.  Not only did they not disappear but they are back and sounding better than ever!!!  I was one who never really cared for Andy Taylor and after seeing this I can say without a doubt that Dom Brown is a great fit and has become a true member of the band!!

I can't wait to get my hands on this so I can watch it anytime I want!!!  Now I just need to figure out how to see them live again!!!",1341705600,5,807,3.9751552795031055
5114234,4,B007XNAQPG,"I was at the show down here in Rio de Janeiro last April/12. Great performance! They are really in a good shape!. But, where is Save a Prayer?!! This classic could not be out of it :(  ;(",1337990400,5,187,3.9210526315789473
5114235,5,B007XNAQPG,"This is an amazing DVD of Duran Duran's Live 2011 performance. This DVD is much better than their ""Live from London"" one from 2005 despite the absence of original guitarist Andy Taylor on the 2011 concert. I highly recommend getting the CD by the same name. You won't be disappointed!",1467244800,,284,4.7

5114239,5,B007XNAQPG,I guess I bought this DVD for a nostalgia trip - what a surprise I got !!! Duran Duran sound better now than they ever did n the 80'S. If you think you like Duran Duran - BUY IT. Good quality sound and picture - my surprise buy of 2015. Ordinary Day is possibly one of the most underated songs of all time and the vesion on this DVD is nothing short of brilliant. Not a bad song on the DVD - Keep it up boys - you keep me young!!,1450569600,,429,3.7252747252747254

5114251,5,B007XNAQPG,"Great performance! Sound and video quality are superb... Duran Duran are amazing live and ""A Diamond In The Mind"" showcases that fact.  I highly recommend this DVD for diehard fans and casual fans, alike.",1391385600,,204,5.0
5114252,5,B007XNAQPG,Awesome live concert of The Fab Five from Duran Duran!! Perfect Christmas present for myself.  I opened it right up and started watching,1390521600,,136,4.913043478260869
5114253,5,B007XNAQPG,Great DVD of a great band! Had just seen them in concert and was cool to sort of relive the experience!,1390435200,,103,3.9523809523809526
5114254,4,B007XNAQPG,"When I originally published this review, I overlooked the fact that tis is the concert disc & not the CD, so......

Though this is my favorite group of all time, this rating is not based on that. They have had some hits and misses over the years but, on a world-wide stage, Duran Duran have made a real comeback, musically. Unlike the ""Live from London"" concert, which was AWESOME in part because it was the original 5 and the excitement of seeing them all together again (for the fans as well as the band itself, apparently), this one was a little more ""trendy"", I guess. The camera work was sometimes a bit too flashy for my tastes, but they sounded GREAT!!

Good buy for the price.",1387324800,,684,4.420634920634921
5114255,5,B007XNAQPG,"Duran still got it: all you need is now!  After an almost complete disaster-er ""massacre"" of what lyrically and musically could have been a better album with another producer and the shelving of a 2nd ""comeback"" album with the original 5, Duran reconvened with a producer that gave them permission to sound like themselves and the results, in the studio and live, are reenergized and fantastic!",1384819200,,394,4.96969696969697
5114256,5,B007XNAQPG,"There are few bands I enjoy Live, but Duran Duran is Awesome!!!  This show is Exciting and the music is a little bit of New mixed with a Lot od their older stuff. The sound and video quality are Great.  Even if you aren't a Duran Duran Fan you might want to check them out here--give them a chance--they are all grown up now  lol",1383350400,,329,4.030769230769231
5114257,4,B007XNAQPG,"I bought this for my wife as she loves DD.  She watched it once but wasn't jumping up and down dancing while watching it.  Hence why it gets four instead of 5 stars. I have in recent months noticed that Amazon is gathering all goods, even from outside vendors, before shipping with their free super saver shipping.  This slows down delivery quite a bit and has caused me to start looking elsewhere for products.",1377993600,,411,4.527027027027027
5114258,5,B007XNAQPG,It's been a while..I was not sure about their recent LIVE album. It was mind blowing. Just knocked out. Thank you Duran!,1376611200,,120,4.5
5114259,5,B007XNAQPG,"I was highly interested in checking out ""A Diamond In The Mind Live 2011"" by Duran Duran dvd set due to my familiarity with some of their music collections and the fun I had after attending one of their exciting concerts back in 2011. The ""A Diamond In The Mind Live 2011"" is a two dvd set showcasing some of Duran Duran's classic hits in a concert format. The first disc features at least 19 of their songs that are performed live. There are many good songs in the live action portion, however ""A View To A Kill"" and ""Ordinary World"" are among my favorites in this musical edition. Tunes  from the 2011 collection of ""All You Need Is Now"" such as ""Safe"" (In The Heat Of The Moment) and ""Girl Panic"" are also included in the live concert performances.  Disc 2 features a 2011 documentary that showcases the camaraderie and closeness among the band-members. There are also the classic and satisfying hits songs of ""Come Undone"" and ""Is There Something I Should Know"" concert features within the bonus section of the second dvd. ""A Diamond In The Mind Live 2011"" dvd is fantastic for those who enjoy many of the 80's and 90's songs from Duran Duran and/or those who have enjoyed and/or  attended any of the Duran Duran concerts.",1376265600,,1226,4.538461538461538
5114260,5,B007XNAQPG,I WENT TO THE CONCERT AND HAD TO HAVE THE VIDEO OF THE BEST CONCERT I HAVE EVER BEEN TO.........A MUST OWN FOR TRUE DURAN DURAN FANS!!,1371168000,2,134,4.0
5114261,5,B007XNAQPG,"The band was totally refreshed after working with producer Mark Ronson on their ""All You Need is Now"" album (one of their best in ages) and they hit the road to celebrate.  You can tell the band was in high spirits supporting the new material which sounds just as good played side by side with all of the old hits you know and love. Great set list, sound quality, and picture quality. If there is one Duran Duran concert to own, it's this one. Superb.",1365811200,2,451,4.305882352941176
5114262,5,B007XNAQPG,"Can't explain how this band has inspired me over the years. Even the years that I didn't love the music they put out, the fact they weren't afraid to try new things and kept it together for so long amazes me. Love the latest record (they'll always be records to me), and can't wait for #14. Ronson really brought them full circle with All You Need is Now and it's the first record since Rio that I love every song on it.",1365552000,2,420,4.134146341463414
5114263,5,B007XNAQPG,"As a Duran fan for 28 years, I enjoy watching their live performances.  I'm also a musician, so I get a kick out of watching them play and checking out their gear.  I thought the Live from London DVD was better, though.  I would've liked to have seen more behind the scenes stuff, and they should have included the Girl Panic video.  But still a must-have for the Duran fan.",1364428800,2,374,4.3
5114264,5,B007XNAQPG,"Love, Love, Love this band. Terrific DVD & CD. Top Tier package for all to enjoy. I would not hesitate to order again!",1363910400,,118,4.173913043478261
5114265,5,B007XNAQPG,I bought the Blu-ray and it's amazing.  Perfect picture and exquisite audio.  This is a no brainer purchase if you want to experience the tour one more time or for the first time.  The energy and visual of the performance is fantastic.  It's a gem.,1363478400,,248,4.444444444444445
5114266,5,B007XNAQPG,A Diamond In The Mind is just like being there!  I was fortunate enough to see Duran Duran four times during this tour and this brought back those memories!  :)  Crank it up and have your own concert wherever you watch it!,1361577600,,222,4.238095238095238
5114267,5,B007XNAQPG,One of the most amazing performance of Duran Duran!! I just loved it!! It`s really worth to buy it!! A wonderful production!!,1360886400,,125,4.7272727272727275
5114268,4,B007XNAQPG,"Great concert. Sound is superb, with much clarity and all isntruments definable on ear.
Personally I don't like concert image over-processed and this one has many effects.
But overall is a nice DD product.",1360713600,,205,5.0588235294117645
5114269,5,B007XNAQPG,"I saw them in concert September 2011 and I love the video because it took me back to the show I saw. There isn't any disappointing about this video. Just know that it isn't like ""Sing Blue Silver"" video with a the backstage and off stage interaction.",1360195200,,250,4.340425531914893
5114270,3,B007XNAQPG,"However if you're not a huge fan...well...it's not too bad.

Bought this more to add to our Blu Ray concert collection really. Figured at 15 bucks why not. I have to admit that I know only about half the music on this disc. The newer stuff isn't bad but I'm just not familiar with it. The performance here is pretty good. Though these guys are a little too bland and feminine at times for my taste. Not exactly stellar musicians but they have a unique sound and put forth a good show.

I mostly want to comment on the audio / video quality. DTS HD is very good bordering on excellent. Video quality is very good too.

However...why I give this 3 stars instead of 5 is solely based on the never ending cut and pan and zoom and edit and on and on....

This entire Blu Ray is shot in 1 second or less spinets. I know this is a trend in concert videos but it's incredibly annoying. There are many parts of this show where the camera angle and scene are literally changing ever half second. There are very few shots that last more than 2 seconds. Really. We counted. It's endless.

If you are happy with this kind of editing and are a fan then this is a great show. Just hard for me to watch too long.",1358035200,2,1196,4.16017316017316
5114271,5,B007XNAQPG,"I bought this for my son and we watched it together. The band sounded fantastic, the quality of the video was great. What an amazing performance! It was almost as exciting as the 2008 concert I attended!",1357344000,,203,4.513513513513513
5114272,5,B007XNAQPG,"Another good one, ok! I hate to say it but I'm obsess with Duran Duran. It started in 1981 to the present, I love listening to Simon Lebon voice and the group still looks good! Rock on 80's!!!!",1355356800,,193,4.105263157894737
5114273,5,B007XNAQPG,I am a Duranie at heart and I couldn't be more pleased. Saw the show live in the US and was amazing to relive!!!DD Forever!!,1355097600,,124,4.0
5114274,5,B007XNAQPG,Duran Duran cancelled 2012 concert due to nicks exhaustion. Dvd next best thing.  love all their new and old hits...good quality film work.,1353888000,,139,5.043478260869565
5114275,5,B007XNAQPG,"This is not even in the same league as Duran's frst live release Arena. This is a well thought out piece of musical art. Duran has been around long enough to know where to go when it comes to live shows. Yes, there are many hits left off and there are a few songs from AYNIN to help promote it on this tour but the songs you have come to know and love are absolute perfection. There hits catalog is so deep a proper 2 CDlive recording would be a nice teat for fans. With Roger back on drums and Dom taking over and sounding better than Andy ever did, Duran is still a force to be reckoned with. My only minor complant is I don't like shows from upbeat bands that open with a ballad. Kinda takes the wind out of your sail but as with everything Duran does there is a purpose. Art + Music. The Wild Boys/Relax Medley was a total suprise but it works. Live CD's are hard to pull off but the mix is perfect and the band is tighter than ever. The DVD/Blue Ray releases feature extra tracks.",1353196800,,985,4.082474226804123
5114276,5,B007XNAQPG,I was very happy with the item and how well it was wrapped up and boxed. It arrived to me very quickly before the due date. I was very impressed.,1352505600,,145,3.8666666666666667
5114277,5,B007XNAQPG,"Duran Duran had to cancel the last leg of their 2011/2012 world tour, which included the August show at the Fraze Pavilion in Kettering, OH. My wife & I were scheduled to attend, we were heartbroken; nevertheless, this Blu-ray is fantastic. Great price, and fast delivery. No one else had this product available.",1351900800,,312,4.90566037735849
5114278,2,B007XNAQPG,"I was so looking forward to this Duran Duran DVD! But by the 2nd song I was so annoyed at the over Editing! I counted and you get at the MOST just 4 seconds before it cuts to another camera. Then they also cut to black and white, then back to color! I mean who wants to sit through that kind of crap! Your eyes are just settling down on Simon or the Band and BOOM, cuts to another camera, then goes to Black and white, and also uses cheap tricks like making the lens shake or have colors smash along with the song, aka "" A view to a Kill"". I mean come on!! Every 4 seconds or LESS! Real shame too as the Band is GREAT! The color film is stunning High Deff, the sound is superior 5.1 Dolby but this whole DVD is just RUINED by the massive over editing! I don't know who did this, but I guess they wanted to make a name for themselves by showing they can make use of all the cameras and make it so fast paced that only someone with ADD can watch it!
  Duran Duran is rock royalty now, they are an old band with most of their fans in their 30's and 40's, no 40 year old wants to see a DVD edited like this! Maybe a 20 year old might enjoy it, not me!",1350691200,3,1147,3.8354430379746836
5114279,5,B007XNAQPG,"I have to admit that I am a rabid duranie, so I love watching the boys in concert. This production brought back memories of many shows I've been to, where I have never been dissapointed. Excellent production, well worth the price.",1350604800,,230,4.634146341463414
5114280,5,B007XNAQPG,I absolutely love this video.  The Blu-ray disc produces a beautiful picture and the sound quality is excellent.  The only way to improve it would be to be at the concert in person.  I also like the way it was filmed - I enjoyed seeing the interactions between band members through different camera angles.  Highly recommend.,1350259200,,325,4.75
5114281,5,B007XNAQPG,"Den Lennie and James Tonkin did an amazing job in filming this video.  Their multiple camera angles and use of light, movement, direction, brings out the best of Duran Duran.  This is a must purchase for all Duran Duran fans.  Their performance was fabulous.  I highly recommend this blu-ray.",1349913600,,292,4.8979591836734695
5114282,5,B007XNAQPG,"I may be a little biased because I'm a huge fan, but I attended the All You Need Is Now concert 3 times. The live shows were great and I assumed without the energy from the audience it was going to be just another long music video. Boy was I wrong! I popped the dvd in and it was as if I was at another live show. Great job DD and the producers for a great product.",1349827200,,365,3.7532467532467533
5114283,5,B007XNAQPG,"Saw them in Durham NC on this tour and the DVD does not disappoint. Good mix of old and new songs sung with great energy. Really enjoyed the concert and this DVD. Able to show friends that did not go and see them live, what they missed.",1349481600,,236,4.042553191489362
5114284,5,B007XNAQPG,"I'll admit, I'm a duran fanatic with bootlegs, etc.  Getting the 2005 reunion DVD was worth it, but after Andy left and they started to sound (rap-like-music) with Timberlake/timberland.  I lost interest in them once again til I read the reviews about how they wanted to make an album that captures the Duran sound; using old school producer.  So after a year has gone by not seeing them in concert or buying their new album, I noticed the new DVD live concert coming out.  I took a chance and purchased it... I was totally blown away with their performance.  Even the new songs were truly Duran Duran sound as my favorites are: MAN WHO STOLE A LEAPORD, SAFE, ALL YOU NEED IS NOW.  I even bought the CD album and also embraced LEAVE A LIGHT ON and MEDITERRANEA.  I've collected all the release DVD's of Duran Duran live 82, 84, 87 & 89... but the DIAMOND IN THE MIND is worth the collection if you are a true fan!  Especially on Bluray!",1347926400,,936,4.401162790697675
5114285,5,B007XNAQPG,"I'm a huge fan of this band and tend to gobble up anything Duran Duran releases, so I was very excited when the release of this concert DVD was announced.

Technically, I was very pleased with this DVD. Picture and sound were both excellent -- at least on my home theater system.

My issues with the DVD are as follows -- and these have less to do with the DVD than the show the DVD was based on:

1.) Odd song to open the concert with in the song Before The Rain -- not exactly an upbeat song! Also, too many hits and not enough tracks off the new album they were alledgedly touring on.  I wish they had performed the excellent Too Bad You're So Beautiful, Leave A Light On, Being Followed, Mediterranea, or Other People's Lives. Even half of those instead of Hungry Like The Wolf, Girls On Film and Rio would have been preferred. Anyone wanting those hits I would refer to the Live In London DVD -- which had the reunited band -- complete with original guitarist Andy Taylor performing those overplayed hits. I'm a diehard fan though -- and one who has seen the band live many times. As such, I'd have loved a show filled with album tracks and B-sides but I won't hold my breath for such a show! :-)

2.) Not enough bells and whistles (extras) on this DVD. AFTER the DVD was released, a downloadable commentary track was released but it should have been on this DVD. The interview segment was interesting, but as with most band interviews -- not very in depth or of much substance.

Despite these minor quibbles, I really enjoyed the disc and recommend it to any DD fan but I wish the set list had been even more focused on the songs of their excellent album All You Need Is Now. If you are reading this and don't own that album, I highly recommend that as the finest DD album since the original lineup made it big in the 80's.",1346716800,,1829,4.3023255813953485
5114286,5,B007XNAQPG,"I reviewed the audio album, now the DVD release. This is even better then the audio version for the sound and the extra songs which never made the cut for the CD. I highly recommend this for Duran Duran fans who have been following them from the beginning & for the new generation of music listeners. My favorites performed on it are ""Planet Earth"", Careless /memories"", A View To A Kill"" & ""Rio"". A interesting number is when they do ""Wild Boys"" and mix in Frankie Goes To Hollywood's ""Relax"" in the song. The bonus material features a documentary / interviews & bonus tracks ""Come Undone"" (my wife's favorite DD song) & ""Is There Someone I Should Know"". I highly recommend this one & is very entertaining. So get this over the audio CD unless you collect, like myself & get both!.
Drop by my website sometime for a visit @ ""JudeMac Forever"".",1346544000,,843,4.516339869281046
5114287,5,B007XNAQPG,"The Duran Duran, one more time, give us an oportunity to see an amazing performance. They're still mantain the same 'punch' as started. Unforgetable!!",1345593600,,150,5.291666666666667
5114288,5,B007XNAQPG,"Excellent.  Good mix of old and new.  Not really a track I wouldn't have used.  Pretty obvious that there are some liberties taken with voice overs/pre-recorded soundtracks.  Simon just can't bust out studio quality on every song anymore.  But short of the almost too perfect sound, it was great.  Best part, my 8 and 10 year old couldn't wait for it either.  They have Rio and Hungry on their Nintendo DS's and require the new album be played in the car (select tracks...AOR is dead).  Can't say I would buy the CD in that it is just a mix of studio sound but seeing the live was great.  Saw Astronaut live but didn't make it to last tour.  Next best....",1345161600,,655,4.383333333333334
5114289,5,B007XNAQPG,"Great concert video, much like the Live From London. Not as many extras but the concert footage is good with lots of special effects. All the songs of their new album with all the old favorites! Nice shots of all the band members with highlights of the audience. DD always puts on a good show!",1345075200,,293,4.345454545454546
5114290,5,B007XNAQPG,"The blu-ray captures the concert experience with amazing detail. We drove 2.5 hours to see Duran Duran live in Tucson Arizona, and while no blu-ray can replace the live concert experience, this blu-ray with it's spectacular editing and sound brings you pretty close.",1344988800,,266,5.209302325581396
5114291,5,B007XNAQPG,"Hey Nick, my grandmother called and wants her brooch back.  Seriously, this is a great concert.  Nice to see them back in form.",1344902400,,127,4.478260869565218
5114292,5,B007XNAQPG,"In December of last year - following the incredibly successful All You Need is Now UK arena tour, Duran Duran filmed and recorded their show at the MEN Arena in Manchester, England.  The result is Duran Duran Live in Concert 2011 - A Diamond in the Mind and will definitely be an audio - as well as visual - delight to Duran Duran fans the world over.

Directed and filmed in high definition by the band's long-time collaborator, Gavin Elder, Diamond will be the band's first live release in close to ten years. The line-up includes Simon Le Bon, John Taylor, Roger Taylor and Nick Rhodes.  While Andy Taylor isn't part of the band's arsenal of musical weaponry, Dom Brown does a phenomenal job with his more than capable talents on the guitar.

Fans will definitely want to pick up both the DVD/Blu-ray as well as the CD because each offers something that the other doesn't.  Boomerocity has gone to the trouble of detailing those differences for you.  They are:

The CD has Come Undone that is not included on the DVD.

Not included on the CD but is on the DVD are: Return to Now, Safe in the Heat of the Moment, The Man Who Stole a Leopard, Careless Memories, A Diamond in the Mind.

The randomly selected Boomerocity favorites from this collection are:

Before the Rain is a tune from the band's latest album, All You Need Is Now, that came out in the spring of last year to much critical acclaim.  Different from a Duran Duran point of view, it's quite a moving song as well as quite the crowd pleaser.

The uber cool, A View to a Kill, reminds me of watching the band perform this tune (if my memory serves me correctly) during a Grammy ceremony.  Regardless of where I saw the performance, the tune is still the only theme song from a James Bond movie to ever reach number one in the charts and this performance of the song is a great example of what that is the case.

Finally, Ordinary World is performed as beautifully and effortlessly as the original studio recording which is as much a testament to the band (especially Brown's solo!) as it is to Le Bon's still-stellar vocal quality. This one tune alone is worth the price of the entire package. Trust me on this one.

Duran Duran Live 2011 - A Diamond in the Mind is a great DVD and CD package to have in anyone's CD as well as DVD library.  They're both very much worth the investment.

5114294,5,B007XNAQPG,"I've been a Duranie since way back in the early 80z and for me, that love of this band and the music has never waned...and actually has grown over all these years. I now share an appreciation for the music with my 14 year old son who also thought this dvd was really good! I was a bit disappointed in the choice of songs but then I got over it 'cos really, HOW many times do I have to hear and see Simon Lebon sing Save A Prayer, even if it is my favourite song? It was great to sit and watch with a glass (or three) of wine and it got me even more excited for the show I'm going to in a couple of weeks! YAY DURAN DURAN!!",1343865600,,622,3.792307692307692
5114295,5,B007XNAQPG,"Keep it simple! Top notch Blu-ray,from DD of course! Watched it over the weekend over and over. Like fine wine gets better with age! Of course like their hits(Planet Earth,View to Kill,and even Careless Memories).Their new songs are great too,and I like the way they added a hook or two to their older songs,instead of playing them the same way for the last 20, 25 years. Yeah I miss some favorites,but like someone else said,pull out a past DD DVD,or YouTube them,there you go. Now I know why their set is the way it is now,it was the same when I saw them in Munich in January.",1343001600,,578,4.411214953271028
5114296,5,B007XNAQPG,"The first thing I noticed was the direction and editing which was fabulous!  I liked how they scanned the crowd, mixed in video and focused on the band.  Some of these live DVDs it looks like they have one camera focused in on the band with once and awhile scanning the crowd.

They skipped Michigan USA for this tour which was upsetting-every time they were in town I would go see them.  Simons voice sounded so fresh and new like he was 20 years old again.

I liked how they focused on the new material also-their latest cd All You Need Is Now-which was there best in years.  I love the old songs but sometimes they are played to death.  My two favories the Man Who Stole the Leopard and Safe were great.  Was hoping they would have played my favorite from the new cd Mediteranea-which brought me to tears everytime I hear it.

Still worth the price to see this excellent band who shows that they are not dead yet!

5114297,5,B007XNAQPG,Have been a Duran Duran fan for 25 years! Simons voice is melodic and the best in years. The live performances have so much energy and the music definitely wants to make you dance... My 8 year old son loves them and knows all the lyrics. Great job Duran Duran.

5114298,4,B007XNAQPG,"I caught one the the rare 2011 US Duran Duran shows with a far less elaborate stage than this.  Watching this is a perfect example of the vibe that's lost in translation from live show to video.

You'll see the beautiful stage.  The beautiful lighting.  The beautiful outfits.  The crystal clear music.  It's all there.  In 2.0 PCM or 5.1 DTS-HDMA.

What's not there is the passion of the audience, and half the fun of going to a Duran Duran show is experiencing the fanatic women screaming, singing along, and dancing.  The audience is FAR too muted here.

That's not a problem limited to this release...it's true of most live releases by any band.  But in Duran Duran's case especially, it mutes a major aspect of their shows.

Let the audience be seen and heard more, even if it means the overall presentation is less...perfect.",1342137600,2,831,4.655172413793103
5114299,5,B007XNAQPG,"Classic, unfiltered, not over-produced (ARENA) Duran. It's like actually being there. Simon's voice has to warm up. This is filmed not long after he came back. But incredible the rest of the show. BUY THIS IF YOU EVER LIKED DURAN2. Phenominal!",1342051200,,243,4.951219512195122
5114300,4,B007XNAQPG,"This set includes the Blu-ray, DVD and Audio CD. The discs are the same as those that you can buy individually. If you buy them individually, you would save money. What makes this set 'Deluxe' is you get is a slip case holding a fold out sleeve that will store your three discs, along with a booklet with the credits and some nice B/W stage photography. The packaging is slick, bit is that worth the extra premium over individual discs? That is up to you.

Now that that is out of the way, let's move on to the review!

Upside, the performance is great, the band was on their game. There is just enough by way of extra video effects to keep it visually interesting. However, because of that don't expect the video to look like the direct to HD shows that are on Palladia, as you will be disappointed. Downside, the editing is a little weird at times with slo-mo shots transitioning back to actual speed. B/W and back to color. Couple those with audience shots at what seems like the 'wrong' times. If someone with more knowledge of the band, and the way the band and audience interact during shows was in the edit suite, we could have had a better visual experience. For example, a few of Simon's stage gestures are lost when the camera is off of him, a view of the crowd's faces yelling 'Switch it off' during Planet Earth was absent, etc. I'm just glad this release was not the David Lynch 'Mayan' show. That was artsy to the point of getting in the way of the performance.

The audio mix is good for the video. Just enough reverb of the arena sound was captured to give you that live feeling, however, the mix seems a little off for the CD, it sounds a little softened, not very dynamic, almost out-of-phase at times.

How did I get to 4 stars? Packaging 5/5, Blu-ray 4/5, DVD 4/5, CD 3/5.",1342051200,34,1792,4.3562874251497
5114301,3,B007XNAQPG,"What makes this a ""Deluxe Edition""?? It appears to include the Blu-ray, DVD, and CD all in one package, but it would actually be cheaper to buy the discs separately. Is there anything special about the packaging or a book included that makes this worth 60 bucks?",1341964800,10,262,4.595744680851064
5114302,5,B007XNAQPG,"I just watched through the blu-ray and I am very pleased with the quality of the production.  The sound quality is excellent.  The video also looks very good, very clear and with some nice touches of editing and effects on occasion to spice things up.  I am a little curious as to why 2 of the tracks are relegated to the special features, but that was an editorial decision.  The show focuses on a selection of the band's hits and tracks from AYNIN.  Concert staples ""White Lines"" and ""Careless Memories"" make for a very energetic back-to-back in the middle of the show.  Also, the bonus feature with the band talking about their 2011 is a nice bonus, and goes nicely with the bonus interview segments from the AYNIN bonus dvd.

Tastefully done and entertaining.  I'm definitely looking forward to seeing the band this August!",1341878400,9,827,4.694444444444445
5114303,5,B007XNAQPG,"I was fortunate enough to catch Duran Duran on the All You Need Is Now tour last fall, and I can tell you first hand that if you are a fan, then this performance is a must have.

Its incredible that thirty years after the New Wave explosion, Duran Duran has released what is probably the best album of their career, next to Rio of course. They are one of my favorite bands, but even I have to admit that as much as half their discography is unlistenable due to the changes that major labels forced upon the band's sound.

If you ever doubted the validity, creativity, and strength of Duran Duran, then A Diamond In The Mind will prove you wrong. The energy and flawless delivery of their early performances are all here, packed with a diverse selection of tunes, a lot of which come from the new record.

Do you realize that as I write this review, Duran Duran are STILL on the same tour for this release?!? They have been touring for almost two years and still have some shows lined up for the end of the year. This is an incredible feat for a young band, but for a group of posh guys in their 50's, that is just unheard of. Very proud to be a life-long Duran Duran fan, especially now that the band is back and better than ever.

I only wish they would have put Tiger Tiger on here as that was the most atmospheric track they played live on this tour and I love the lighting they used for it.

Considering how long the band has existed and the rough music times they've weathered, I'm happy they've still got it!
