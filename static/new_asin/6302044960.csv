419812,4,6302044960,Great Movie! Terrible Ending!,1419120000,,29,6.5
419813,2,6302044960,"I did not know that jet fighters could land and take off from abandoned farms [as well as get re-fueled at dilapidated barns]. Why is the Air Force
spending so much money in airbases? At any rate, the plane flying is the best of the movie [but you can get this from air shows anyway].",1418256000,,284,4.181818181818182
419814,2,6302044960,"Really poorly written, poorly acted.  Very trite.  30 minutes and I was done.  Get ""Broken Arrow.""  Better story, good script, great actors.",1416700800,,140,5.2272727272727275

419816,4,6302044960,"Great story line, kept me on edge of my seat. Peter Strauss was perfect for the part.
Didn't guess it would end in that fashion.",1416009600,,128,4.16
419817,2,6302044960,The story had potential but the acting was less satisfactory.,1413676800,,61,5.2
419818,4,6302044960,"It was pretty good. Hopefully, the incident portrayed in the movie would never happen.",1411084800,,86,5.214285714285714
419819,3,6302044960,Interesting movie but not one of the best. Strauss keeps it interesting but the plot is a little ridiculous.,1407542400,,108,4.7368421052631575
419820,1,6302044960,"This VHS was definately NOT NEW. I am aware VHS quality is somewhat less than DVD but this tape has obviously seen better days, like in a rental tape. The picture is washed out and very degraded and the sound is off in some scenes. Tried e-mailing the seller but got a reply from Amazon that their e-mail box is full or has been changed. Will go from here.",1287187200,,356,4.173913043478261

419828,1,6302044960,"No way in hell this could happen, i was in the Air Force and this was just plain dumb, the flying parts were pretty good though. Peter Strauss was the good actor in the whole film.",1463356800,,180,4.027777777777778

419848,5,6302044960,One of the best Peter Strauss movies - feasible and surprising plotline,1450483200,,71,5.0
419849,1,6302044960,"The story needs a better scenario, something like pilot or pair of pilots on religious mission take a few nukes and one of them does destroy Vegas. Leaving the other to be stopped by super hero spies.  It wasted too much time with hostages, where it didn't even make sense for him to take hostages. And the ending is way to corny.",1444262400,,330,4.32258064516129

419852,3,6302044960,Good B Movie,1438214400,,12,3.3333333333333335
419853,3,6302044960,Good acting by Peter Strauss as usual and with William O Leary. Flight scenes used not bad for a 1990s TV production.,1436400000,,117,4.363636363636363
419854,3,6302044960,"Great movie to watch.  Tons of action & drama.  Based on a pilot who's under some kind of control, which seeks attacks on society.",1433203200,,130,4.375
419855,5,6302044960,"Imagine if you will, 'Top Gun', the famous fighter plane movie with Tom Cruise, but with Maverick (Tom's character) snapping from what appears to be PTSD, and shooting down his allies, while carrying a nuke, with a mission to destroy Las Vegas, because he's a 'messenger of God'.  This is a great gem of a movie, with William O' Leary delivering a great performance as a pilot that slowly loses his mind and goes on a rampage.  Lots of action, and quite a few hard-to-watch, unpredictable scenes. Recommended!",1428883200,2,509,4.7727272727272725
7820439,5,6302044960,"Good, thoughtful ""What If"" movie. Had this on VHS, and waited years for it to come out on DVD.",1525564800,,94,4.0
7820440,5,6302044960,"I love Peter Strauss so anything he is in is okay with me. I thought this was a very good movie. I'm not sure how realistic the plot is but if it is, this movie is also terrifying.",1505952000,,180,3.763157894736842
7820441,1,6302044960,"Why do these satanic movies always try and make the crazy guy a Bible reader??? People who read the Bible are the sane ones! The Hollywood Libtards are the satanic crazys'. The Bible teaches love and compassion for our fellow man, not crazed killers! I fact one of the verses in the 10 commandments are ""Thou shall NOT kill!!!
You should be ashamed and you will answer to God for your blasphemy and heretic movies! I wish there was a minus on the star vote!!!
Sick perverted Hollywood!!!",1500163200,,487,4.545454545454546

7820446,3,6302044960,"An OK movie acting wise, but with a very dark plot, quite depressing. I think a PG-13 rating is appropriate because of the plot and overall theme.",1476748800,,146,4.444444444444445
