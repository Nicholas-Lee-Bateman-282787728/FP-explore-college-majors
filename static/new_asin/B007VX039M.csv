8522328,3,B007VX039M,"Not bad movie, but the housewife didn't do one thing. She should take her underpants off or completely nude in all sex scenes.  She got nice body too.  The second thing why the director painted any colors on both of the female actors!
No point to me.  The third reason is the male and two female actors should have sex at the end of this movie.  Those three reasons made me rated this movie only three stars.",1395100800,,408,4.259740259740259
8522329,4,B007VX039M,"I really liked this film. Good story line revolves around a newspaper editor and his staff!  This guy Okomoto has this semi- hot wife. She's all submissive and polite typical orential role for a chaste wife!
Anyway, they are having problems in the bedroom! The newspaper adds a female to the staff! She shows up and you know right away what's going to happen! She's a dime man , plain and simple.
So homeboy Okomoto is all over this new girl. Personally I don't blame him! Anyway, not to give anymore away! It all gets twisted this way and that way!
Speaking of twist, for all you bondage affectionados out there! The bondage scenes are complete with soundtrack, whimpers, and you can hear the ropes twisting and straining clear as can be! Buy it,  rent it, check it out!",1390348800,6,771,4.539568345323741

8522331,5,B007VX039M,"Beautiful women;very erotic story-line.  I highly recommend this film; one of the best in its genre.  ""From the novels of the late, legendary SM Master Oniroku Dan, prepare to be served a dark vision of twisted lust and inhuman bondage"". Well 'inhuman bondage' is classic Japanese rope bondage. You get the idea.",1353974400,13,312,4.980769230769231
8522332,3,B007VX039M,"Switchblade DVD authoring have been releasng a few interesting Japanese movies of fairly recent vintage - many of them female Ninja oriented blends featuring a little swordplay mixed with a generous helping of nudity and erotic action.  ""The Devil's Feast"" is an interesting departure from that formula - it presents a more overtly erotic story-line, spiced up with a little BDSM activity. To lovers of Japanese filmic kink this should come as no surprise as this film's 'story'  is credited to 'legendary' Japanese SM author Oniroku Dan - who also penned the infamous Japanese erotic novel: ""Flower & Snake"".  ""Flower & Snake"" , in its' 'original' incarnation, has been made into a film twice - initially in the 1970's ( with Naomi Tani) and again, more recently, in an updated millennial version (with Aya Sugimoto).  The basic premise of the 'F&S' plot is apparently so engaging in Japan that it has spawned a mini franchise of sorts and numerous 'sequels' have been made ( ""F&S"" 1-5 ) - all of which feature strong doses of BDSM activity.

The 'core' concept that re-surfaces in all of these 'twisted' little works attributed to Oniroku Dan's writings is that of 'the wife' of some male figure in the story who must 'atone' for some 'transgression' that the husband has committed.  Generally there is a powerful 'evil' male entity (business tycoon, yakuza boss, etc.) who demands that the 'husband' deliver up his spouse to the nefarious/lecherous, desires of the big honcho in order to save his own 'reputation/life/fortunes etc.'  Typically, the dutiful loving wife goes along with the deal and, typically, much of the ensuing content of the movie is made up of scenes of the heinous humiliations and bondage indignities that she must endure for the sake of her 'disgraced' mate.

""The Devil's Feast"" follows this 'winning formula' to a 'T' but is a little 'softer' in some of the BDSM action than the 'Flower & Snake' franchise typically offers.  This flik appears to have been originally released in Japan in 2007 so it is pretty 'modern' Pinku fare but still exhibits many of the conventions of standard Japanerotica (including the relatively short play time of only 67 min.!).  In this tale - an ad account exec at a newspaper gets into trouble when the newswoman he is having an extramarital affair with writes a derogatory article about one of the paper's major advertisers (a suspicious religious cult) and the only way that he can save his bacon is to allow his wife to 'serve' as a 'temple maiden' at the cult leader's compound-for a week.  As one might imagine, the cult's 'wicked' head priest has more than just lighting incense & candles in mind for wifey's penance, and 'the ropes' come out!

This movie was shot on film which gives it a nice quality look - better than the shot direct to video format I've seen on some of Switchblade's other 'ninja' products!  The 2 lead actresses are VERY attractive and there are numerous 'straight' sex acts scattered throughout the plot, in addition to the bondage scenes.  The sex action is mostly 'soft core' - as is usually the case w/ Japanese ero-flix - there's a tiny bit of full frontal female nudity, and some nice (if not exceptional) 'shibari' rope work. In the final analysis I'd say that the 2 words of summation that come to mind in the aftermath of watching this film are: 'soft' and 'short'.  A  pleasant enuf viewing experience (it could almost be a 'date movie') but it seemed to end just as things were heating up.  I'd give it about 3.5 stars.  Technically, the DVD transfer is very nice widescreen, English sub-titles are xlnt - no 'extras' on the disk other than some previews for other Switchblade flix.  Worth a look if you are an Oniroku Dan fan - or just can't see enuf naked Japanese girlz decorated w/ rope! ( Hey, I know I can't)!

For those who really enjoy this style of flik - may I suggest tracking down some of the 'Flower & Snake' franchise films (Amazon carries the first 2 versions) - some of the more 'obscure' later offerings in the series may require a 'region-free' DVD player - they are deliciously 'bent'!  AND - Switchblade has another Oniroku Dan based flix available: ""The Curse M"" & ""Slave Ship"" (see my reviews for more details) they both feature 'better' rope work than 'The Devils Feast' and intriguing plots!",1348444800,13,4316,4.758713136729223
