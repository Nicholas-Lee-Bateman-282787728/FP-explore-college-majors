IT is unhistoric with set piece B Hollywood acting, story line but it is still a fun film to watch. David Farrar is an under rated actor and Ann Blythe is very pretty in the Hollywood eastern harem costumes. the bad guy lurking and skulking around every corner! It will win no awards for anything except  for entertainment! I'll bet the cast had a good laugh making it!!",1440201600,,489,4.202127659574468
