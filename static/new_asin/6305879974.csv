7898893,3,6305879974,"Raising the Mammoth is a two-hour Discovery Channel documentary about an expedition to Siberia to remove a complete mammoth body frozen for twenty thousand years.  The project was completed in one ten-thousandth of the time the creature lay undisturbed; bad weather closed in and caused delays of a year.  Partly fascinating, partly annoying, mostly informative but not altogether so, Raising the Mammoth seeks to inspire and awe us and sometimes stretches the point in order to do so.  It tries too hard to become a drama, and doesn't focus enough on getting the scientific issues right.
A few examples will prove my point.  The first concerns the difficulty in removing the block of permafrost that encased the mammoth. It is hard to believe that the scientists involved would have left to chance the matter of whether or not the block was too large to be lifted by the helicopter at hand, as was portrayed.  Surely calculations giving them some reasonable hope of success were in hand or some other method of removal would have been pursued, but the last-minute suspense was played to the hilt like a Bruce Willis thriller.
At one point we are told that the Siberian Woolly Mammoth stood twice the height of a man and weighed as much as 10 elephants.  Almost immediately following we are told that the Columbian Mammoth, prospering in the milder climates of North America, was the largest of mammoth species and stood twice the height of a man and weighed as much as 10 elephants.  Which is true?  How could the largest of the mammoth species be the same size and weight as a lesser member?  And why were we repeatedly treated to truly substandard animations of mammoths that surely did nothing to ""bring them to life""?
Most bothersome to me were the glossing of various significant mammoth theories--mention was made that Man may have played a part in the extinction of the mammoth, but there was no discussion of how.  The documentary implied that Early man, hunting with spears in groups and picking off an occasional weakened mammoth would cause an extinction, but surely this isn't the case.  (In fact, modern research shows rabbit to be the most common meat in early man's diet.)  But the hunting of entire herds, through burning plains and driving animals over cliffs, is a known tactic that could have lead to an ultimate devastation.  This strategy is never mentioned or shown, but instead we are treated to repeated pictures of a single adult mammoth killed by one or two brave hunters with spears.
But what I regret most of all is that the documentary closed without showing us any more of the mammoth than a block of permafrost with tusks (the tusks had been removed originally but were put back in place, sticking out of the block like some Cubist elephant; we are told this was out of respect for the creature but I have to believe production values played an equal part) and a patch of reddish-brown hair the size of a throw rug.  Presumably the production deadline closed before the Mammoth was removed, but I was left feeling only slightly more satisfied than when Geraldo Rivera opened Al Capone's ""secret"" vault and found only an empty glass bottle and a few scraps of trash.",1003449600,12,3197,4.768115942028985
7898894,4,6305879974,"This is a documentary. If you do not like the pace of a documentary, you won't like ""Raising the Mammoth"". It is NOT a feature film filled with special effects. The basic outline of the film is the inner workings  of an archeologist whose dream is fulfilled in the frigid arctic as he  battles the elements to 'raise' a Mammoth. The film is very 'real' about  the human condition and our struggles to do extraordinary things, like  chipping a prehistoric elephant out from 15 feet of solid, arctic ice. This  is a GREAT documentary which reveals not only how a scientist must approach  certain obstacles, but also how important inner personal relationships can  be in dealing with indigenous cultures - such as the tribes which inhabit  the vast, icy wastelands. It is truly amazing when they find and capture a  preserved Mammoth, you will be amazed. The DVD has great features.",963100800,21,879,4.768211920529802
7898895,3,6305879974,"I found the premise intriguing and the presentation a bit exhausting in getting to the real meat of the story. My question is in regards to the millions of mammoths that died and what they ate. Those found with food in  their mouth or stomach had vegetation no longer found in the region. If it  was to be found in lakes surrounded by ice or frozen tundra, how could  there be enough to sustain the vast numbers of mammoths. A mammoth exceeds  our largest elephants in size and those elephants require enormous amounts  of vegetation to sustain life much less to flourish. If they were as other  animals that need more food to live in arctic environments, their needs  would be even greater. An elephant can eat 600 lbs of foliage each day. It  would seem that a mammoth would need much more based upon size and climate.  I don't see that being available in the arctic. More details of the plans  for cloning a mammoth would have been in order. Perhaps it was too soon to  be available and they are planning a separate program later when the  efforts have been made. An explanation of the origin of the ivory islands  vast stores of remains of mammoths and woolly rhinoceros would be in order.",962496000,3,1193,4.493023255813953
7898896,5,6305879974,"This is about as exciting as archaeology gets. The team's struggles with the elements make for great tension and drama. It really feels like an adventure. Unfortunately the computer generated scenes fall well short of  Jurassic Park, and they break from the surreal atmosphere of Siberia. But  you really cant expect Jurassic Park, can you? Still, I have to give this  DVD 5 stars. It has so much to offer, and it totally engrossed me in the  adventure. This is a classic.",962064000,4,472,4.719512195121951

I am a big fan of the Discovery Channel shows and usually enjoy most of them.  I am NOT your average short attention span viewer who expected a Hollywood action thriller (I am an avid and interested lifelong scientist with a specialty in biology).

And yet, I still do not recommend this programme, because it was too much filler and not enough meat (literally).  They stretched about a half hour of information and ""non-footage"" footage into a two hour show with no pay off in the end.

Here is a 30 second synopsis of the show...  (SPOILER ALERT)
Watch Russian workmen and scientists camping on the tundra and slowly digging a big, brown, rectangular block of ice out of the permafrost.  Then watch same big, brown, rectangular block of ice helicoptered away.  And that's it.

You should know that it is only a partial mammoth (the head was eaten by predators).  You never really get to see the partial mammoth, just some tufts of hair.  You never get any of the test results (blood, DNA, hair sampling, stomach contents, etc.).  Even the tusks that you see in the previews were already removed and just re-inserted into the block of ice for dramatic effect.  This show is unnecessarily long with no satisfying payoff at the end (like the similar Discovery Channel Ice Man programme which was far superior and gave us satisfying and fascinating images, facts, test results, and hypotheses about the Ice Man).

Also (guessing from the reviews) you may not be aware, despite the monumental ""historic event"" promos for this show, that this is NOT the first frozen mammoth found, nor the best preserved, nor the most complete, nor even the largest.  Frozen mammoths and mammoth remains have been found around the world for centuries now, and they have been studied for stomach contents, DNA, blood and parasites, etc.

For me, the most interesting thing about this Raising the Mammoth show was the showing of strange prehistoric plants under the feet of the mammoth, and the reconstruction of the bones of another mammoth elsewhere.

I would suggest just watching a repeat of it on Discovery Channel before spending money on your own DVD copy of it.  It's repeat viewability factor is a 1 out of 4 (and that's being kind).",959558400,2,2353,4.75615763546798
