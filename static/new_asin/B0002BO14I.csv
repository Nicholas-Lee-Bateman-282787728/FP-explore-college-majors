8025719,1,B0002BO14I,"AWFUL... SHE IS PROMOTING her ""CORE BAR"".  The package says in BOLD PRINT - ""NO EQUIPMENT REQUIRED"".  What a LIE.  There are 3 ladies demonstrating the moves.  Two are using the core bar and the other lady uses dumb bells.  The exercises with the dumb bells are modified, BUT the camera is only on the lady demonstrating it about 20% of the time. REDICULOUS.  SKIP this video unless you own a CORE BAR.

There is next to no warm up.  There are no directions on how to move safely.  There are constant move changes without warning.
This is very frustrating.  It is the only dvd out of 6 that I have tried thus far that I ran out of room with the constant change in direction.
The ONLY thing I liked about it was the retro music.  Simmons is constantly joking and it is corny... SKIP this one..

Here are 3 other dvds that I recommend instead...
Walk away the pounds, 20 minute Power Mile.  This is excellent for out of shape beginners.  I use it as a warm up to other videos.
Walk on to Weight Loss,  Walking Pilates.  Also excellent.  It is a 3.5 mile / 50 minute work out.  BOTH of these videos provide excellent form and safety tips.
For an ab workout,  Dance off the inches TUMMY TONE PARTY ZONE with Marie Forleo... NOT OTHER Dance off the inches videos.  This instructor repeats the same moves over and over so that you can catch on in one to two attempts at the video.  The warm up is not good in this video,  but with the WALK AWAY the POUNDS video for 15 minutes,  you can get an excellent warm up before moving on to this  39 minute video.",1450828800,,1548,4.222602739726027

8025721,3,B0002BO14I,"This workout is pretty good,  but you don't really need the Core Bar--since 90% of people doing the workout are at home, you can use a chair, or sofa, or doorway for the stretching portions where the Core Bar is used as just a support, or even a cane or walking stick, for that matter.

And yes, you can use dumbbells, or another body bar (the big difference with hers seems to be that it's padded, which is nice but not essential, and that you can adjust the weights and use the ends as very light handweights). Her bar only goes up to 12 pounds, which could be an issue for when you want to ramp up your workout a bit. If using dumbbells, you might want to get some with straps that go across the back of the hand.

I rented this, and in the chapter breakdown, it shows a picture of them exercising on the floor. There is no matwork on this DVD whatsoever. Also, and this is not mentioned in the description, it is around a 30-minute main workout, with a bonus workout (great music) of about 7 minutes.

I like the instructor, but wish she'd put all the chitchat about the gadgets on separate chapters and NOT anywhere in the workouts.",1204761600,5,1137,4.274418604651163
