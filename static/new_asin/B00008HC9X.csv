1846984,1,B00008HC9X,"The Rumble event was one of the worst ppv's of the past year. Triple H Vs Scott Steiner was the worst world title match ever, surpassing Triple H Vs Undertaker from KOR 2002. Steiner is finished and Triple H is still boring and dull. Kurt Angle vs Chris Benoit is a 5 star match, but of course Triple H gets better billing on the card. Go Figure. The Rumble match itself was predictable, with Lesner winning. Complete garbage. The WWE needs to put the axe on the Triple H show and give it to someone who is actually OVER, like Booker T. or RVD. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",1046563200,,564,4.231481481481482
1846985,4,B00008HC9X,"This has got to be one of the most predictable Royal Rumble PPVs in years. But the card was saved by a spectacular WWE Championship Match and the Rumble Match. Here's the run-down of the card, and I rate at a bust of five stars.
Winner is Entered into the Royal Rumble Match:
Brock Lesnar vs. The Big Show w/ Paul Heyman
***1/2
-Not a bad match, certainly outdid their Survivor Series bout but it's still way too short. The ending is predictable.
World Tag Team Championship Match:
Lance Storm(c) and William Regal vs. The Dudley Boyz
***1/2
-A decent tag title match with great action and technical wrestling supplied by both teams. I think RAW has a superior tag team division when compared to Smackdown. I really liked the ending. In the end, the Dudleyz picked up the victory and are the new World Tag Team Champions.
Stepdaughter vs. Stepmother:
Torrie Wilson vs. Dawn Marie
**1/2
-When compared to the women's divsion on RAW, this match is nowhere close. A horrible angle topped off by a so-so match. The WWE should just leave the women wrestling to RAW.
World Heavyweight Championship Match:
Triple H(c) w/ Ric Flair vs. Scott Steiner
***
-The build-up for this match was tremendous. The match on the otherhand, was a letdown. Scott Steiner still seems to have a case of ring-rust and Triple H has stepped away from being a technical wrestler and has focused more on being a brawler. The moves are so redundant and sloppy. Defenitley not a ""blockbuster"" match the WWE was making it out to be.
WWE Championship Match:
Kurt Angle(c) vs. Chris Benoit
*****
-A spectacular contest between these two, Angle and Benoit used match physcology and gave it all they had. This match really did save the PPV. This bout tells a story and will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. A definite M.O.T.Y (Match of the Year) canidate.
Royal Rumble Match:
****1/2
-A very entertaining match with great action supplied by all competitiors. From beginning to finish, this match had it all, including the return of the Undertaker. The ending was predicatble but a great Rumble overall.
The Bottom Line:
Not a bad PPV, certainly not as good as Armageddon and Survivor Series from last year but pretty good.",1046390400,,2209,4.695876288659794

1846987,3,B00008HC9X,"The PPV was a little predictable, but it was still a good show by WWE.  Chris Benoit vs Kurt Angle was the best match of the night as these two great performers always seem to deliver when they are in the ring together or on opposing sides.  Triple H vs Scott Steiner was somewhat of a let-down.  Steiner just did not bring all the tools necessary in this one, in fact I lost count of how many times he repeatedily used the belly-to-belly suplex and he screwed up on a few other power moves.  The tag team match between the Dudleys and Regal/storm was pretty good.  Brock vs Big Show was basically the same thing you saw at Survivor Series, Brock toss Big Show around like a little child but it amazing to see just how strong Brock really is.  Heyman tried to screw Brock out of a victory like he did at Survivor Series, but this time he did not succeed.  Brock f-5ed Show to earn a spot in the royal rumble event.  The Royal Rumble was a little predictable.  I don't think anyone had any doubts that Brock would prevail, but shockingly Brock didn't dominate the rumble like you would think that he would.  Undertaker and Jericho were top 2 guys that put on a good showing.  Jericho elimnated about 7-8 people and Undertaker took out about 6.  The rumble did have some entertaing moments as Tommy Dreamer nailed Jericho in the forehead with the kendo stick that left a big knot and Kane acted like he was going to throw RVD on top of Batista but instead throw him over the top rope.  To all HBK fans, I'm sorry to tell you but he was the first guy elimnated from the rumble but not in clean fashion.  Anyway, I don't know what kind of features will be in this dvd, but overall the PPV itself was not bad!",1045440000,,1704,4.26791277258567

1847000,3,B00008HC9X,"1.) Royal Rumble Qualifying Match: Big Show w/Paul Heyman vs Brock Lesnar

This match was quick and to the point, as it should've been. This match was mostly all about Lesnar getting his revenge from being double crossed by Heyman at the Survivor Series PPV. After some quick back and forth tussling between the 2 big men, Lesnar drops Show with an impressive F5 to pick up the win. Short but good match to kick off the show

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Terri interviews Chris Jericho backstage about his problems with Shawn Michaels going into the Royal Rumble and Jericho says he's something Shawn Michaels never was; the first ever Undisputed Champion. Jericho goes on to claim that he'll throw 29 other superstars over the top rope and go on to retrieve the World Championship at Wrestlemania

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.) WWE World Tag Team Championship Match: The Dudley Boyz vs William Regal and Lance Storm (c)

A standard match here to follow the first. Nothing too impressive happened here as it wasn't too bad and wasn't too good but in between. Regal was still using the brass knuckles as his signature weapon, so you knew that they'd come into play at some point in the match. Chief Morley comes to the ring and tries to distract the referee while Regal gets out his knuckles to use, but the plan backfires as Regal takes a 3D for his efforts. Bubba takes care of Morley while D-Von knocks Storm's lights out with the knuckles and pins him for the win. Decent, average Tag match

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) First Ever Stepmother vs Stepdaughter Match: Dawn Marie vs Torrie Wilson

The whole reason for this match happening was stupid. It was all based off the notorious Torrie Wilson/Al Wilson/Dawn Marie love storyline that was the Smackdown equivalent of Raw's Katie Vick. I won't go into detail about the storyline, but all you need to know is that it was bad in every way. The booking was bad, the acting was bad, and the storyline was bad. And what do you do when you get bad booking, bad acting, and a bad storyline? You throw in a bad match of course! After toying around with each other, Torrie beats Dawn with a swinging neckbreaker to end this horrible feud. I loved Torrie and had the biggest crush on her back then, but she had some less than memorable matches with Dawn Marie

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) WWE World Heavyweight Championship Match: Triple H (c) w/Ric Flair vs Scott Steiner

Scott Steiner had recently debuted in WWE a few months before and this was his first official WWE PPV match and goodness gracious was it horrible. Lets just say that Steiner vs HHH is to Royal Rumble as Cena vs Lesnar is to SummerSlam. In other words, this match was a suplex fest! If Steiner wasn't doing a bearhug it was a belly to belly suplex. If it wasn't a belly to belly suplex it was a belly to back suplex. If it wasn't a belly to back suplex---okay you get the point. The Boston crowd didn't hesitate to share their feelings about the match either as they boo Steiner on multiple occasions, a few boring chants are heard, and eventually they just stop caring and fall asleep. Steiner busts Triple H open with a reversed championship shot to the head. In the end this suplex fest ends on a DQ when Triple H hits Steiner in the gut with the sledgehammer. Steiner's performance in this match would probably explain why his time as a main eventer in WWE was short lived and was even left off that year's Wrestlemania card. It was rather unfortunate though as Steiner was a decent wrestler in WWE, but he seemed lazy with his dreadful 5 moves of doom in this match. Looking back on it, I'm not sure which was uglier: Steiner's in-ring performance or Triple H's cherry red tights

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) WWE Championship Match: Kurt Angle (c) w/Team Angle vs Chris Benoit

After a disappointing World Title match from the Raw side, Smackdown would give fans a much better match to be proud of. Any wrestling fan remembers the classic matches Benoit and Angle had with each other back in 2001. From their first encounter at Wrestlemania 17 to their Ultimate Submission Match, their 2 out of 3 Falls Match, and even their Steel Cage match. They'd rekindle their feud in late 2002 and it finally all came to a head here with this epic WWE Championship match. The referee ejects Team Angle from ringside at the start of the match, allowing Angle and Benoit to do their thing with no funny business. Competitive, technical, tremendous. Those are just a few words to describe how amazing this match was. After 20 extraordinary minutes, Angle secures the win to retain the title by making Benoit tap to a vicious Ankle Lock with a hook, which Angle would add to the Ankle Lock going forth. The Benoit/Angle feud is one of the best to happen to ever happen to WWE and wrestling in general. The Benoit vs Angle WWE Championship bout is not only one of the best--if not the best Royal Rumble match of all time. It's one of the best WWE matches of all time. Benoit received a well deserved standing ovation from the crowd and the commentary team. When the smoke cleared, Angle was the winner of the match, but after a match like that, Benoit was a winner too. Simply incredible

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) 2003 Royal Rumble Match

This was a historical Royal Rumble for the primary reason being that it was the first post brand extension Royal Rumble match to happen. 15 Raw superstars and 15 Smackdown superstars collided in the ring for the right to guarantee themselves a World Title shot at Wrestlemania. This was Shawn Michaels' first Royal Rumble match since 1996 and a throwback to the 1995 Royal Rumble as he entered at #1. Chris Jericho came out at 2 but it was actually Christian disguised as Jericho. Jericho came in from behind and attacked Michaels and bloodied him with a steel chair before easily throwing him over the top rope, eliminating him. He'd extract some revenge by returning later on and attacking Jericho, causing him to get eliminated by Test. John Cena made his Royal Rumble debut at #18 and did an impressive rap on the way to the ring. Brock Lesnar made his way into the match at #29 and The Undertaker made his return after a 3 month hiatus at #30. The return promos for Taker leading up to the Rumble had some under the impression he'd be returning under his Lord of Darkness gimmick, so it was a bit of a throw-off when he came out as Big Evil. It was well worth the wait for the epic return as the Deadman we'd get at Wrestlemania 20 a year later. We had a few short lived reunions with Edge and Christian and the Brothers of Destruction throughout the match. Maven who was #26 would attempt to eliminate The Undertaker the same way he did the previous year's Rumble but he failed and was tossed out of the ring by Taker. The final 4 were between 4 giants with Batista, Kane, Brock Lesnar, and Undertaker. Of those 4, the final 2 came down to Lesnar and Undertaker. After Taker takes care of Batista, he's thrown over the top rope from behind by Lesnar and the winner of the 2003 Royal Rumble match is Brock Lesnar. This win solidified Brock Lesnar's dominance as a superstar, looking back at his list of accolades he accomplished in the company since his debut. Fairly good Royal Rumble match. It showcased a lot of the young and upcoming superstars who'd shine over the course of that year in the newly Ruthless Aggression Era.

Overall: Not too bad of a Royal Rumble PPV for 2003. The opening bout between Lesnar and Show and the Tag Team Championship match were okay. Torrie vs Dawn and Scott vs HHH really lowered the PPV a bit. The Torrie/Dawn match really should've been saved for Sunday Night Heat or Smackdown and Steiner/HHH may have been better if Steiner did more than various suplexes. Chris Benoit vs Kurt Angle stole the show, hands down, bottom line, no questions asked. The Royal Rumble match was standard. It had a nice variety of talent in the ring but lacked any major surprises or shock value that the previous 2 Rumble matches brought. Overall, the 2003 Royal Rumble earns a 3/5 stars",1422057600,,8585,4.986722571628232
1847001,4,B00008HC9X,"The great thing about almost any Rumble event is that a lax undercard can be forgiven if the Rumble match can deliver the drama, action and intrigue the concept is known for. The 2003 event is a great example of a few matches saving an otherwise dire show and proves that, despite several missteps, the Rumble is really a one match card.

In this case the Rumble is very good with loads of talent stacked at the end. The final minutes are captivating as Lesnar, Undertaker and Kane duke it out in a hoss wet dream. The beginning is well done with Jericho getting some terrific heat to advance his story with Shawn Michaels. Jericho gets a lot of time to shine, and Michaels does more for the match in his brief appearance than he could have by sticking around longer. Overall, it was a great match that gets overshadowed by the 2004 Rumble.

The rest of the card featured some dead weight, mostly thanks to the RAW brand. Scott Steiner and Triple H had a legendary bad match that is often cited amongst the worst title matches ever (despite the fact H would turn in worse performances at No Way Out and Judgment Day). It's not a good match, that for sure, but it's certainly not the affront to the eyes that many will claim.

The highlight match was a knockout Title Match between Chris Benoit and Kurt Angle that proved Angle was the best choice to be champion, and that Benoit was a main event player. Although these guys had fought in numerous matches before, this one is probably their best outing; there have been few matches before or since that achieved this one's mastery of technical wrestling. The crowd showed their appreciation for the match afterward, which was well deserved.

There are a few other matches on the card, but they're mostly short, irrelevant bouts with little importance. The fact that we get a good rumble and a masterpiece of a title match secures this as a recommended DVD.",1410220800,,1905,4.56140350877193
1847002,4,B00008HC9X,The best match on the card and one of the best of all of 2000's was Kurt Angle-Chris Beniot and the worst match was HHH-Scott Steiner which was pointless as a cow kite. The Royal Rumble was a good solid match inspite of Brock Lesnar's short appearance. The rest were o.k. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10.,1276905600,,302,4.05
1847003,4,B00008HC9X,"#29 Entrant Spot in the Royal Rumble Match: Brock Lesnar vs. The Big Show (with Paul Heyman)
This match was VERY entertaining and a great way to kick off the show. Lesnar and Show work great together, and it still amazes me every time Lesnar hits a belly-to-belly suplex on Big Show. Paul Heyman is great and played his part quite well, attacking Lesnar from time to time and distracting the referee during pin attempts. Lesnar tried to hit the F5 on Heyman after flipping him into the ring, but Big Show grabbed Lesnar by the throat and hit the Chokeslam!...LESNAR KICKED OUT! An astonished Show went for the Chokeslam again as Heyman stood on the apron barking orders, but Lesnar countered the Chokeslam, pushed Show into Heyman, which knocked Heyman to the floor, and then hit the F5 on Big Show for the win! A great match that wasn't too long and played out both men's strengths. Winner: Brock Lesnar. Match Rating: 5/5

World Tag Team Championship Match: The Un-Americans (William Regal and Lance Storm) (Champions) vs. The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von Dudley)
There was a lot of nice tag team action going on here, with a lot of back-and-forth between all of the competitors. The Dudleyz hit the What's Up and Bubba also hit a Bubba Bomb on Storm, but before they could hit the 3D on Storm, Chief of Staff Morley ran out to stop them. The referee was distracted by this, and the Dudley Boyz hit the 3D on Regal, who was about to punch them with brass knuckles. D-Von took the brass knuckles and clocked Storm right in the jaw, allowing for the pinfall and the victory! A couple of things in this match were a little stupid, like the ref not counting out the Dudleyz when they were both in the ring at the same time and the fact that Vince McMahon had told them specifically to ""Get the tables"", something that didn't happen. Still, it was a great tag team match with lots of action and excitement. Winners: The Dudley Boyz. Match Rating: 4/5

First-Ever Stepdaughter vs. Stepmother Match: Dawn Marie-Wilson vs. Torrie Wilson
As you could probably guess, this match is crap. Neither women are really all that good at wrestling, though Dawn did pull off some pretty decent grapple maneuvers I suppose. The end came swift and mercifully when Torrie hit a swinging neckbreaker to pin Dawn. Winner: Torrie Wilson. Match Rating: 2/5

World Heavyweight Championship Match: Triple H (Champion) (with Ric Flair) vs. Scott Steiner
This is one of those matches that are so bad that it's actually quite entertaining. Both Triple H and Scott Steiner can put on a good match, but together they are just terrible. Steiner was admittedly worse though, botching punches and pretty much only doing belly-to-belly suplexes throughout the entire match. Triple H actually played the scared bad guy part quite well, when Steiner didn't even react to his facebuster. In fact, Steiner failed to sell at really any point of the match, which was just irritating and made him seem unstoppable. Flair did all he could to try to make the match more interesting by choking Steiner behind the referee's back, and even the referee was doing a better job than Steiner and Triple H. The fight spilled to the outside and Steiner took a sick throw into the steel steps, but when Flair and Triple H tried to leave with the World Heavyweight Championship, Steiner and the referee pursued. As the referee restrained Flair, Triple H tried to smash the title into Steiner's face, but Steiner pushed the belt back into Triple H's face, causing Triple H to bust open. Back in the ring, Triple H tried to get himself disqualified by tossing the referee out of the ring, but the referee, in perhaps the greatest part of the match, refused to disqualify Triple H! This caused Triple H to get a sledgehammer out and hit Steiner in the gut with it, causing the disqualification. A lot of people hate this match a LOT, but I actually enjoyed myself. It's just really stupid and silly and wildly entertaining as a result. Winner: Scott Steiner. Match Rating: 4/5

WWE Championship Match: Kurt Angle (Champion) vs. Chris Benoit
The last match is so entertaining because of how bad it is. This match is entertaining because of how ridiculously good it is. Angle and Benoit still work great together, despite the fact that they have been in a ton of different matches together. At the beginning of the match, there was pretty even offense, with each men hitting some suplexes and basic offense, but the tide started to change when Benoit hit a DDT on Angle on the ring apron! Following this, the match was a glorious submission fest, with both men countering each other's submission holds. Benoit kicked out of an Angle Slam and Angle dodged the Flying Headbutt, but Benoit countered another Angle Slam attempt into the Crossface. More back-and-forth reversals really got the crowd lively as Angle reversed the Crossface into the Ankle Lock and Benoit reversed the Ankle Lock into the Crossface. Angle hit a super belly-to-belly suplex and even a second Angle Slam, but BENOIT STILL KICKED OUT!!! A frustrated Angle was prepared to lock in the Ankle Lock, but Benoit countered and hit a German suplex. Angle countered a second German suplex into a German suplex of his own, but Benoit countered another German suplex attempt by Angle into a German suplex that sent Angle BACK FLIPPING in mid-air and landing right on his face! Benoit then hit the Flying Headbutt, only to get a two count!!! The end came when Angle manged to counter a Crossface attempt into an Ankle Lock, and despite the fact that Benoit powered out a couple of times, Angle was able to reapply the hold repeatedly and drag him away from the ropes. Benoit had no choice but to tap and put a close to one of the best matches in wrestling history. Winner: Kurt Angle. Match Rating: 5/5

Royal Rumble Match
This is easily the BEST Royal Rumble I have EVER seen. The beginning of the match was memorable itself, with Christian coming out when Jericho's music played, and Jericho coming out of the crowd to lowblow the number one entrant Shawn Michaels. Jericho then followed this up with a chair shot and then threw Michaels over the top rope! Rey Mysterio and Edge were major highlights of the match, and Edge nailed everyone with a Spear once he entered the ring. Christian came out and hugged Edge and tried to get him to team up on Mysterio with him, but Edge ended up hitting the Spear on Christian. Chavo Guerrero and Rey Mysterio also proved to be quite entertaining against one another. Everyone involved in this match did a great job, and things got hardcore when Tommy Dreamer ended the match with a trashcan filled with trashcan lids and kendo sticks! Dreamer beat the crap out of everyone with a kendo stick, even smacking Jericho right in the face which created a giant and painful-looking knot right above Jericho's eye! Edge and Dreamer worked together to eliminate Bill De Mott by smacking him in the head with the kendo sticks, but Dreamer was eliminated after Christian and Jericho hit a Conchairto on Dreamer using trashcan lids and then Jericho smacked the kendo stick on Dreamer's back and tossed him over the top rope. Jeff and Matt Hardy were also a spectacle, with Jeff beating up on Matt after Matt tried to get Jeff to work with him. Shannon Moore came out with Matt Hardy and saved Matt from elimination more than once, and he even took a Swanton Bomb in place of Matt by Jeff. Rikishi got in the ring and beat the crap out of everyone and had a confrontation with Rosey. Rikishi and Rosey decided to work together, and Rosey helped Rikishi set Matt Hardy and Shannon Moore up for the Stinkface, but at the last second, Rosey hit Rikishi with a POWERFUL clothesline that had Rikishi doing a flip! Kane eliminated Rosey by simply throwing him over the top rope and he hit most of his signature moves before melting into the fray. John Cena entered with a rap, but he got beat up on by Rob Van Dam, who was also quite impressive during the match. Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas were both quite good as well, though Brock Lesnar eliminated them and Matt Hardy when he hit the F5 on Matt Hardy to the outside of the ring!!! Rob Van Dam was eliminated when Kane tricked RVD into thinking that he was going to help Rob Van Dam do a tag team maneuver onto Batista and ended up tossing RVD to the outside! It was down to Brock Lesnar, Kane, The Undertaker, who was making his return having been absent due to injuries from The Big Show following No Mercy 2002, and the then-newcomer Batista. Kane and Batista beat up on Brock and Undertaker respectively, but Lesnar ended up eliminating Batista with a clothesline over the top rope. Undertaker hit the Tombstone Piledriver on Lesnar and then offered to make an alliance with his brother Kane. However, Undertaker betrayed Kane at the last second and knocked his brother over the top rope. Batista re-entered the match with a chair and tried to take out Undertaker, but Undertaker countered, smacked Batista with the chair, and tossed him back over the top. As Undertaker talked trash, Lesnar took the opportunity and dumped Undertaker over the top!!! What a phenomenal Rumble, with references to Rumbles past and great wrestling from all competitors. Props to Maven, Tommy Dreamer, Jericho, Michaels, Christian, Edge, Mysterio...there's really too much to name. Winner: Brock Lesnar. Match Rating: 5/5

BACKSTAGE SHENANIGANS
Interactions between Stephanie McMahon and Eric Bischoff, the two best General Managers in the histories of Raw and SmackDown!, are pure gold. There was a sweet promo with Chris Jericho before the Rumble, and Scott Steiner beat up Triple H and Ric Flair following the World Heavyweight Championship match. He took down both Flair and Triple H with the sledgehammer and then locked Triple H in the Steiner Recliner until a group of referees pulled him off of the champion. Chris Benoit received a standing ovatoin following his match, and Kane and Rob Van Dam do a promo together backstage before the promo. Rating: 5/5

EXTRAS
There is a segment featuring some of the best moments of Royal Rumbles past, featuring Pat Patterson. It's a slightly altered version of the same segment featured in Royal Rumble 2004, but it's still worth checking out. The Royal Rumble 2003 commercial is featured as well as a ""making of"" featurette of the commercial. You can watch all of the build-up to the main even matches via the Extras menu, plus you can watch the teasers for The Undertaker's return. Plus, there are plenty of interviews, with most of them being quite entertaining. The interviews feature Jonathan Coachman, Terri, The Dudley Boyz, Chris Jericho, Dawn Marie, Paul Heyman, Brock Lesnar, and more. Definitely a lot here to check out, and there's plenty to love.

OVERALL EVENT
Royal Rumble 2003 is an amazing pay-per-view with only one really poor match being the match with Torrie Wilson and Dawn Marie. No Royal Rumble since 2003 has topped 2003's Rumble Match, and the WWE Championship bout between Angle and Benoit is one of the best matches in history.",1248134400,,11088,4.741450777202073

WWE Royal Rumble 2003
The 2003 edition of the Royal Rumble was an average event. You get three good matches, two horrible matches, and a good Rumble. Combine this with some good extras and this is a nice DVD. The extras are bonus interviews, promos for the event, television commercial with its making of sequence, three Undertaker return videos, a history of the Rumble, and a bonus match from Raw.

Dawn Marie had married Torrie Wilson's father, Al Wilson. After a series of unfortunate events, Al Wilson died. Dawn took it upon herself to blame Torrie and attack her. This is how this match came to be. I thought Dawn showed decent intensity, but Torrie almost showed no emotion at all. These two would go on to have better, less stupid, matches.
RATING- 2/10

World Heavyweight Championship
Triple H(c) w/Ric Flair VS Scott Steiner
This match was a train wreck. Steiner came in with tons of fan support; he left with half of the crowd booing him. Steiner dominated a lot of the match; Triple H got a few flurries in here and there. The problem with this is that Steiner was not ready to wrestle. After about five minutes, Steiner was burned out. Steiner hits the same four moves repeatedly until the fans hate him. Triple H uses a sledgehammer to get himself disqualified. The match is watchable, but it is bad. The aftermath is nice, but at that point you are already sick of Steiner.
RATING- 4/10

WWE Championship (Match of the DVD)
Kurt Angle w/ Team Angle VS Chris Benoit
Team Angle is quickly ejected from the match. We get a wrestling classic from these two athletes. The match starts a little slow, but quickly accelerates after Angle takes a sick DDT on the apron. These two go counter for counter. Benoit is trapped in the ankle lock for around two or so minutes before tapping out.
RATING- 10/10

Royal Rumble Match
This was the first time that the Royal Rumble would be contested between the two brands, Smackdown and Raw. The match begins with Michaels being jumped from behind by Jericho. Jericho quickly ejects HBK from the ring. From there you will see great wrestling, hardcore wrestling, and cool stand-offs. Edge/Christian, Jeff Hardy/Matt Hardy, and Undertaker/Lesnar all have cool stand-offs. Chris Nowinski takes a sick dropkick to his face by Edge. Dreamer comes in like a house of fire and begins swinging his kendo sticks like a mad man. He lands a shot on Chris Jericho, leaving a huge, bloody knot on his head. The match itself was solid. The major problem was there was not enough top talent. You knew it was between Undertaker and Lesnar the entire time. The final four was not a good choice either. Finally, you good see the ending coming from a mile away.

1847005,2,B00008HC9X,"Royal Rumble 2003 would have to be one of the weakest Royal Rumbles ever. The Rumble match couldn't even save this and neither could the classic match up between Benoit & Angle. I'll say don't even bother with this one unless you really want to see the Angle and Benoit match, it really is a great and an epic match but that couldn't even save this ppv.

1. Brock Lesnar vs. Big Show w/ Paul Heyman
The winner of this match would gain entry into the Rumble match. The match was bad but I felt it was better than their Survivor Series match. Paul interferes but it only made the match worse. Not a good opener but it's watchable. 2.5/5

2. World Tag Team Championship
Lance Storm & William Regal vs. Dudley Boyz
Pretty decent tag match. The Dudleys, Storm, and Regal kept it interesting and this became a nice title match to watch but it wasn't near to being all that. 3/5

3. Dawn Marie vs. Torrie Wilson
Man what a stupid a55 storyline these two gals was working with. How stupid and rediculous can you get besides the whole Katie Vick saga? A squah match. At least it was a little short. 1/5

4. World Heavyweight Title
Triple H w/ Ric Flair vs. Scott Steiner
Now this match wasn't all that bad but it was a suck a55 poor title match. The real problem with this match was that it just really dragged on way too long. Triple H tryed to keep this one at a steady pace but it just went too slow. Steiner pulled off a few nice slams here and there but nothing exciting. Poor title match. 2.5/5

5. WWE Championship
Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit
I have no idea what to say about this one. Just a pure classic. This should have been at wrestlemania and not Lesnar/Angle. They pulled off some nice reversals and great suplexes. Angle takes one sickening suplex from Benoit in this one. Its a true shame that this match was put on here with such a poor ppv booking. This match was just unbelieveable. Possibably their best match throughout their long history with each other. An unforgetable classic. 5/5

6. 30 Man Royal Rumble Match
Not the best Royal Rumble to say the least.

It starts out with Michaels and Jericho but Jericho would get a cheap behind low blow on Michaels and eliminate him before Michaels can even get out of the blocks. Jericho did had an impressive showing on the other hand though. He also takes a hard shot with a kendostick from Dreamer. I really laughed my a55 when Cena entered the ring. His stupid rap was just so corny, you just cant't help but to laugh. Taker made a surprise return with being number 30 but it had a predictable ending. Nothing really memorable from this one. The best thing that came out from this was that it set up the match between Michaels and Jericho at wrestlemania. 3.5/5

Don't bother with this one. I'd hate for yall to waste your money just to see the Angle and Benoit match but it was certainly a classic bout. If yall do get this one, don't spend too much on it.",1218499200,,2917,4.349264705882353
1847006,3,B00008HC9X,"The Rumble has really lost its luster since 1999. Ever since 2000 you can basically tell who is going win the Rumble. Heres the results

Brock Lesnar VS Big Show: You can predict who would win this match.

Dudley Boyz VS William Regal and Lance Storm: Alright match but this match would be played out on Raw for the next few months.

Torrie Wilson VS Dawn Marie: Bathroom break

Triple H VS Scott Steiner: The reason why I bought this dvd. I wanted to see how bad this match really was. First I want to cite something from a book Wrestlecrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling by RD Reynolds and Randy Baer. Page 263 states Steiner was diagnosed with drop foot syndrome and made it hard for Steiner to control movement in his feet. I watched but didn't really watch the worst match ever. It was very, very repetitive and Steiner used the same moves over and over and over and over and over. I blame Triple H for not really helping Steiner thru out this long, painful match. Only once does his condition show in this match and the crowd quickly chants ""You F'$#ed up"" The match was good but Steiner was repetitive and Triple H did a bad job selling the match. The ending was very stupid and made no sense. Of course a rematch was in order.

Kurt Angle VS Chris Benoit: Amazing match. Whenever you get these two men in the ring, you'd always get a classic match. ALWAYS! I watched some matches from 2001 between Angle and Benoit. They never disappoint the fans.

2003 Rumble: Decent match but if you listen closely, you know who is going win. I thought it was funny they put over Bill Demott and B2 and they didn't really last that long. Undertaker returns but doesnt last too long. Lesnar wins in anther uneventful Rumble.

Expect for the Benoit-Angle match, the whole PPV was bad. Steiner VS Triple H was a good match but I blame Triple H for not helping Steiner out.",1196726400,,1865,4.40406976744186
1847007,2,B00008HC9X,"Surprisingly, yet unsurprisingly, this was one of the worst WWE pay per view events I've ever seen, and undoubtedly the worst Royal Rumble I've seen thus far.  Not one match other than the Rumble was worth a second viewing, and some of them not even worth one viewing.

Brock Lesnar vs The Big Show
Dull as the day is hot in Havana.  I expect better from Lesnar, but after that debacle of a Smackdown main event at Survivor Series 2002 these two pulled, I shouldn't have expected much.  (1/10)

World Tag Team Championship
The Dudley Boyz (C) vs William Regal and Lance Storm
In ECW, Lance Storm was a hell of an athlete.  In the WWE, he's like a bird without wings.  This wasn't much of a match from a wrestling perspective, and not very exciting either.  As usual with matches involving the Dudleys, the audience only seems to care about tables.  (3/10)

Torrie Wilson vs Dawn Marie
This whole ""Al Wilson"" storyline thing was a mistake from the start, but this match really had no intensity or passion in it.  It was just a dull, by the books disappointing Diva match, an excuse to show sexy women catfighting.  (0/10)

World Heavyweight Championship
Triple H (C) vs Scott Steiner
As the story goes, the WWE asked Steiner to take a steroids test, then suddenly shut up when he demanded Triple H take one as well.  That leads me to believe both men are on steroids, but at least Triple H looks naturally built.  Steiner's a disgusting bulk of rough-edged muscle with veins bulging out.  This match was a quintessential example of everything bad and fake about wrestling going off at once, matched with a bad storyline of Triple H being afraid of Scott Steiner.  Aside from Triple H's blatantly obvious blading (that's cutting yourself in wrestling terms to make it look like you're busted open from heavy fighting) from nothing more than a barely-there shot to the head with the championship belt, to Steiner doing virtually nothing but belly-to-belly suplexes and punches, to an ending so disastrously disappointing that it dragged the match into the annals of wrestling oblivion alongside the likes of Undertaker and Kane vs Kronik (Unforgiven 2001) and Brock Lesnar vs Goldberg (Wrestlemania XX).  (0/10)

WWE Championship
Kurt Angle (C) vs Chris Benoit
Another reviewer here mentions that this is a wrestling fan's dream match and, quoting, ""words would not do it justice"".  By the standards of the WWE these days, he's right.  But why should we settle for mediocrity, just because WCW isn't back there prodding WWE in the ass to put on a quality product?  This match was as dull and heavily scripted as any random brawler versus any generic hardcore guy in a regular match.  The moves consisted of, besides punches kicks and stomps, a ceaseless gauntlet of german suplexes back and forth by the two, submission holds that went nowhere and held the match down for almost a whole minute at a time.  Even the audience seemed bored with this match, mostly silent for all save when it looked like Benoit was gaining an advantage over Angle.  (1/10)

To the reviewer ""D.P."" from California, who claims this is a wrestling fan's dream match, I dare you to eat your words when you watch Eddie Guerrero vs Dean Malenko in their farewell match for ECW, a 2 out of 3 falls match.  THAT, my friend, is a wrestling fan's dream!

Royal Rumble Match
As with many, if not all of the Royal Rumbles I've seen, this one was exciting, with plenty of action going on and off around the ring by many colorful characters and genuine athletes getting their time in the ring.  John Cena's entry was an amazingly lame and disgustingly dreadful rap while the camera follows him down to the ring, but luckily he doesn't win.  Instances such as Matt and Jeff Hardy fighting one another (in very different circumstances than in the 2001 Rumble) and Shannon Moore's frequent interference for Matt Hardy are exciting bits of entertainment, along with the fluidity with which much of the match moves.  (9/10)

All in all, this was a debacle ruined by what WWE considers to be wrestling (or ""sports entertainment"") these days.  Without WCW to make them cower in their boots, there's really nothing to make them try to give us quality entertainment.  They'll give it to us whenever they feel like it.",1182556800,,4271,4.7347767253044655
1847008,3,B00008HC9X,"It is possible to have one of the best & worst World Title matches in wrestling history on the same card?  Well, WWE somehow managed to pull that off at the 2003 Royal Rumble.

Brock Lesnar vs. Big Show - The winner of this match goes into the Rumble and Brock is one of those people that can bring out the best in Show.  Since the winner was going into the Rumble later, they kept this match short but not as short as their Survivor Series match.  This match is good but they would go on to have better encounters later on (the Stretcher Match at J. Day).

World Tag Team Champions William Regal & Lance Storm vs. Dudley Boyz - Good tag team match here between the two but it would turn out to be pointless as the Dudleys got screwed out of the belts the next night.

Torrie Wilson vs. Dawn Marie - This wasn't good but at least they kept it short.

World Champion Triple H vs. Scott Steiner - Boy, this match was just awful.  They didn't mesh well together & it was mostly on Steiner than Triple H who oversold Steiner's offense while Steiner just kept repeating his suplexes and obiviously was blown up at times.  It just wasn't good.

WWE Champion Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit - This was a professional wrestling (not sports entertainment) fans dream match. Honestly, this is one of those matches that words would not do it justice. Wanna know how good this was...people were giving both Angle & Benoit standing ovations after the match.

(Also available on ""History Of WWE Championship"" & The Chris Benoit Story DVD sets)

Royal Rumble - This was an average Rumble that got boring at some times but it did had some good moments like Jeff Hardy finally getting his hands on Matt for how he left RAW, Maven trying to eliminate Undertaker AGAIN, and Tommy Dreamer bringing in weapons & getting ""hardcore"" but the big highlight here was the storyline between Jericho & HBK with help from Christian that resulted in both of their elimination's.  Brock would go on to win it at the end after drawing a late entry.

Overall, the only match that's worth going out of your way to see is the Benoit/Angle match is available on two other DVD sets (History Of WWE Title, The Chris Benoit Story).  Overall, this is one WWE DVD that I would get only at a reasonable LOW price.",1179446400,,2266,4.426506024096385

The rumble match was bloody awesome and the other matches were all fairly cool.,1146182400,,373,4.3
1847018,2,B00008HC9X,"This was probably the worst Royal Rumble in history. It featured three very bad matches, one decent one, a lousy Royal Rumble and an absolutely amazing match.

Brock Lesnar vs. Big Show, Royal Rumble Qualifier

This match was absolutely awful. The Big Show is a decent wrestler, but Brock Lesnar is absolutely terrible. A predictable ending made this match all the worse. This match is like watching a tumble weed.

The Dudley Boys (C) vs. William Regal and Lance Storm

This was a fairly decent match. Regal and Storm are very good wrestlers and in the tag team forum, the Dudleys can hold their own. Its sad though that this was the second best match on the card. Nice surprise ending though.

Torrie Wilson vs. Dawn Marie

If you take out the fact that Torrie Wilson and Dawn Marie are very nice to look at, this match is worthless. Unless you are really bored don't even bother watching this.

Triple H (C) vs. Scott Steiner

Triple H did all he could to save this one, but Steiner really cant wrestle anymore. I remember back in the early 90s where Scott Steiner was one of the best wrestlers in the game. Now he can hardly even move. This match really isn't worth seeing, yet its still better than some of the other matches on the card.

Kurt Angle (C) vs. Chris Benoit

There is no way to fairly describe this match. It was outstanding, phenomenal, amazing, incredible, brilliant. These two guys know how to wrestle and they put on a clinic. This match is easily one of the greatest wrestling matches of all time, and shows that you don't need steroids and steel chairs to put on an amazing match. Angle and Benoit are the two best wrestlers in the business and this match is proof.

2003 Royal Rumble Match

This match was decent alright. There weren't any really good spots. It was fairly boring all the way through, and highly predictable. It got a little interesting when the final five were in, Rob Van Dam, Kane, Undertaker, Batista and Lesnar. Unfortunately, Lesnar is an awful wrestler and he looked pathetic out there with other talented wrestlers. A guy like Brock should never be in the Royal Rumble. It's sad when the worst wrestler by far in the match wins.

Its sad that an event with one of the greatest matches of all time gets only a 2 out of 5 rating, but theres nothing much to watch here other than Benoit/Angle. As I said, the Rumble was poor, the undercard was weak, and several of the matches were downright awful. The Benoit DVD has the Angle/Benoit match. Buy that.

Torrie Wilson vs. Dawn Marie Wilson- Dum match. Just a normal Divas match. Winner- Torrie.

Triple H vs. Scott Steiner- ZZZZZZZZ..ZZZZ, oh yeah bad match. Funny ending. Scotty's muscles must have slowed him down.

Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit- From the worst match of the night to the BEST MATCH OF THE NIGHT. Angle and Benoit have been in many matches together, but this one was one of their best matches of all. Not as good as Kurt Angle vs. Brock Lesnar at WrestleMaina 19, but I say this is the best bout between Angle and Benoit. Winner- Kurt Angle

The Royal Rumble- I enjoyed this Royal Rumble. It would have been better if Shawn Micheals wasn't out in the first seconds of the Rumble. I thought the best part was when Undertaker made his return as number 30 (Fact: People say number 30 is the best number in the match, that number is really bad luck because whoever does draw 30 has never won a Royal Rumble.) I say the right guy won because at WM19, Kurt Angle and Brock Lesnar had the match of the year. Winner- Brock Lesnar

A good match, at lest for an opener. Wasn't very long, however. Plenty of interference from Heyman. A pretty back-and-forth match, for the most part. I have to get something off my chest here. A lot of people would say this was a bad match just because Brock was in it. People are judging him by his actions and not his wrestling ability, which I think is wrong. Hogan turned his back on the fans and left the WWF a while back, but we still cheer him on. Wrestling fans are crazy like that, I guess. Anyways, Brock wins it with the F-5.

Winner, by pinfall, Brock Lesnar!

WWE Tag-Team Championship: Dudley Boyz vs William Regal and Lance Storm (c)

A pretty solid tag-team match, but not nearly the best the two teams could have done. Chief Morley interferes at the end of the match, and accidentally gives the Dudleyz the win when he distracted the ref just long enough for Devon to clobber Storm with Regal's Knucks and get the pin fall.

Winners, by pin fall, and new tag-team champions, the Dudley Boyz!

Decent woman's match, a little more violent than usual. Torrie Wilson picks up the win with a swinging neckbreaker.

World Heavyweight Championship: HHH(c) w/ Ric Flair vs Scott Steiner

A very out of control match. Big Poppa Pump dominated practically the ENTIRE match. After about ten minutes in, HHH starts to walk from the ring and get DQ'd, but the ref see's whats going on and lets the match continue. From there on, HHH desperatly tried to get a DQ loss. Eventually, HHH hit Steiner in the ribs, and got his DQ. But, Steiner gets right back up, and nails HHH with the hammer, and then hits Flair. Then goes back to beating on HHH. Not that great of a match, though pretty entertaining.

Winner, by DQ, and NOT the new World Heavyweight Champion, Scott Steiner!

WWE Championship: Chris Benoit vs Kurt Angle (c) w/ Team Angle

Hands down the match of the night, and the match of the entire year. When Angle fights cleanly(Team Angle was Ejected from ring-side before the match even started), he puts on very good matches, and Chris Benoit, also, who can have a good match with practically any opponenet did this one perfectly. They were out there pulling off every reversal you could think of on each others signature moves, and even invented a few new ones. Angle wins after finally locking in the ankle lock perfectly, after about 10 tries. I would buy this DVD just for this match.

Winner, by submission, and still WWE Champion, Kurt Angle!

Match Score: 10/10

Royal Rumble Match:

This was a very excellent Rumble match. Jericho was obviously the most dominant force in this match. He probably would have won it if Shawn Michaels didn't illegally show up and get him eliminated. RVD, Kane, Undertaker, Lesnar and Batista were the final five. Kane lifted RVD up to throw at Batista, but eliminated his partner instead. 'Taker than eliminated Batista and it was down to 'Taker, Kane and Lesnar. Undertaker persuaded Kane to help him, but then attacked him from behind and threw him out. Batista then came back to the ring to hit 'Taker with the chair, but Taker took it and hit him instead. But, Taker was distracted just long enough for Lesnar to sneak up from behind and eliminate him. Lesnar partied in the ring, and 'Taker congratulated him and told him to win the gold from Angle.

Winner, and #1 contender for the main event at Wrestlemania, Brock Lesnar!

Match Score: 9/10

Match Two-Tag Team Titles-Dudleys Vs William Regal & Lance Storm(C)-This was a good match which surprised me a bit. This is a couple of good tag teams and they work good together. Keep this feud going except with noone else just the Dudleys Vs Storm & Regal. My rating 5/10.

Match Three-Stepmother Vs Stepdaughter Match-Dawn Marie Vs Torrie Wilson-These two have been feuding since last year sometime and its come to this. One none gimmick match to try end a boring waste of time. This is hopeless,we shouldn't have to watch it. There's plenty of divas who can wrestle instead of these two. My rating 0/10.

BROCK LESNAR defeated THE BIG SHOW to advance to the Royal Rumble Match: Luckily this did end up being better than their Survivor Series match. However, I still was a little disappointed. As much as Lesnar's strength was impressive, I already knew this from his previous meetings with TBS. This match didn't really give us anything more, except maybe an ending to their feud. Boy, that final F-5 sure was messy!!! Match Rating...6

THE DUDLEY BOYZ defeated LANCE STORM & WILLIAM REGAL to Win the World Tag-Team Titles: Despite not being anything special, this match wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. To me, it appeared as if the Dudleyz slightly adjusted their styles to fit in with their opponents. Having said that, more excitement should have been drawn from the match. It seemed like the WWE thought this would occur purely from the result. As for the result, I cannot see why Storm & Regal couldn't have retained the titles for a few more weeks. Switching the titles around constantly does nothing for their prestige. Match Rating...6

TORRIE WILSON defeated DAWN-MARIE WILSON: What can I say...??? This was a waste of time. This coming from a person that thinks the Womens Division should be retained!!! The only 2 positives I saw was that the match was very short & didn't have too many botched moves. I was just begging for Victoria or Jazz to do a run-in. It might not have made sense, but neither Torrie nor Dawn-Marie can carry a wrestling match. Match Rating...2

SCOTT STEINER defeated TRIPLE H by Disqualification in a match for the World Heavyweight Title: I have not seen any other reviews of the Rumble (before posting my column) just so I could write what I am about to write uninfluenced. I get a funny feeling that this match will be bashed from pillar to post by most reviewers. I don't totally agree. As much as it was very messy & didn't flow well, I thought the entertainment aspect of this match was good. Maybe, I am being light on this match, because I was expecting it to be worse. I don't know, I just thought the intensity was decent & the interaction of Ric Flair & Earl Hebner saved this bout. It was also very strange to see the crowd cheering Triple H & booing Steiner. Match Rating...6

KURT ANGLE defeated CHRIS BENOIT to retain the WWE Championship: Excellent match!!! Leading into this, I just thought it would be similar to what they had put together previously. I thought that there was no way Benoit could win & this match was only on the card to see the reaction that Benoit would get at main event level. While these points still held true, the match was a resounding success anyway. At times, it genuinely appeared as if Benoit would win the bout, and the standing ovation he received afterwards will surely be noticed by WWE decision makers. The match itself was a good hybrid of their previous efforts. While containing technical bursts, it didn't get bogged down. There was a few new reversals performed & the overall psychology of the match was top-notch. My initial reaction rating to this match was a 9, as it took a little while to get going. But I have changed the rating, as I have learnt in the past few months that it is practically impossible to put on a 25 minute masterpiece from beginning to end. Match Rating...10

ROYAL RUMBLE MATCH Won By Brock Lesnar: Like I said last week in my predictions column, I think the fact that there were 15 wrestlers from each roster really helped out this Royal Rumble. It just added that something fresh to the equation. The match itself was very well booked with the exception of a couple of things. For the most part, I liked when wrestlers entered the match, how long they remained & who they were eliminated by. Furthermore, the entertainment aspect of this match was high. The Matt Hardy/Shannon Moore shenanigans, Chris Jericho/Christian hijinx, and the interaction of the Hardyz, and Kane with both RVD & The Undertaker, all added to the spectacle.

Picking out the negatives; Jericho was eliminated a little early for my liking (by Test of all people), not long after a referee apparently saved him from being accidentally eliminated. The ending looked like a battle of the giants & Brock Lesnar, who was the odds-on favorite to win the match, was handed the #29 entry. The unpredictability aspect of the match was basically thrown out as soon as the 25th wrestler had entered & Brock Lesnar was still in the dressing room. But like I said, those negatives are being picky & all in all, this match once more delivered the goods. Match Rating...9

PPV RATING (39/60) = 65

Looking at the key, I have basically given the 2003 Royal Rumble a 'B' grade & said that it was a 'good event that was worth the money'. It only just got into that rating range, yet I'm still happy with that overall grade & comment. The Royal Rumble is always a hard event to grade, as there are less matches on the card & the main event will almost always deliver the goods. When I think about it, there were only 2 matches on this card that were anything special. But both of them were 'must-see' matches, and at the end of the day, that has to be considered heavily. This was especially the case this year, seeing as though these 2 matches took up almost exactly half of the ppv in time.",1114732800,,5778,4.568115942028985

William Regal and Lance Storm (champs) vs. the Dudley Boys- Solid tag team action, not much to be said about besides the finish which saw the Dudleys take home the belts.

1/10

World Heavyweight Title Match (Raw)

Triple H (champion) vs. Scott Stiener- This match really received a lot of extremely negative reviews and I can see why but I just didn't hate it all that much besides the finish. Maybe it's because Triple H is my favorite wrestler but I didn't hate this match, it certainly wasn't great, but it wasn't that bad. The only problem I had with this match was the lame DQ finish. Maybe they just didn't have anyone else to use for No Way Out but DQs on Pay Per Views is ridiculous.

6/10 (finish brings it down a half a point)

WWE Championship Match (Smackdown)

Kurt Angle (Champion) vs. Chris Benoit

This match was amazing, one of the best of the year 2003. Everything just seemed to flow between these two like it always has; these two are truly the best technical wrestlers you'll find. Finish came when Benoit tapped to the Ankle Lock. Benoit gets a standing ovation for his efforts after some celebration from Team Angle.

Also, John Cena rapped and made an ass of himself. The winner was the obvious favorite, Brock Lesnar. Exciting Rumble in my opinion, but then again they all are.

ROYAL RUMBLE QUALIFIYING MATCH:

THE BIG SHOW (w/Paul Heyman) vs. BROCK LESNAR

*** Pretty good match-up. Paul Wight (Big Show) always puts effort into his matches and is a great worker. I would've loved to see Lesnar F-5 Heyman. These three guys had a great fued going from late 2002-early 2003.

DAWN MARIE vs. TORRIE WILSON

* First-Ever Stepdaughter vs. Stepmother match. Weird title for a very boring match with two sexy women who belong in strictly gimmick matches (lingerie, evening gown, bikini contest, pudding, egg nog, etc.). Stupid storyline, too. Dawn Marie's husband is Torrie Wilson's father, Al; on their honeymoon they have sex a lot and then he dies on Dawn. C'mon, writers. What was the cause in all this? And the match was terrible.

WWE WORLD TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP:

LANCE STORM & WILLIAM REGAL (cs) vs. THE DUDLEY BOYZ

** In 2003, we had Lance Storm, William Regal, and Chief Morley (now known as his former character, Val Venis) as an anti-American stable. La Resistance came around and now they are the chief anti-American stable (if you count Kenzo Suzuki and Rene Dupree, who is a member of La Resistance). Anyway, mediocre tag match-up, the Dudleys are good workers but I just don't like them that much.

WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP:

TRIPLE H (c) w/Ric Flair vs. SCOTT STEINER

**** While some found this match dull and lifeless, I enjoyed it a great deal. But maybe that's just because I'm a big Ric Flair mark. Liked how Triple H kept on trying to get himself disqualified 'cause he knew he was gonna lose the Championship to a no-good wrestler like Steiner, who I can't stand. All Steiner did were suplexes, which were pretty good, hard elbows and punches, and chops. Triple H has tons of more wrestling knowledge and experience than ""Big Poppa Pump"". This and the rematch at No Way Out 2003, which I have yet to see, are Steiner's two big breaks in the WWE. The rest of 2003 he spends fueding with a mid-carder like Test over the very sexy Stacy Keibler.

WWE CHAMPIONSHIP:

KURT ANGLE (c) vs. CHRIS BENOIT

***** The match of the night and an incredible technical bout. Lots of chemistry these two seem to have with each other, and no doubt equal amounts of respect.

ROYAL RUMBLE MATCH:

*****

One of the best Royal Rumble matches I've seen. I immensely disliked 2002's, and 2001's was great, as was 2000 and 1999, so this was good. I didn't like seeing HBK eliminated quickly by Chris Jericho. Chris Nowinski sustained quite the concussion during a double-team kick by Rey Mysterio and Edge, who were a great tag team together. B2, formerly known as Bull Buchanan, got eliminated quick, and Bill DeMott now provides commentary for Velocity. Tommy Dreamer now holds some significant position in the actual WWE company. It was cool to see Jeff and Matt Hardy go at it, I'd never understood why they split in the first place, I guess 'cause of the RAW/Smackdown draft.

It's a shame Jeff left WWE and now seems to be showing himself the door out of TNA, no-showing some shows, and this the federation to which he jumped to for a few months. His brother's not done much better. He had a few mediocre PPV matches against Kane this year, at Vengeance and Summerslam, but he has tremendous technical ability and as I write this is undergoing ACL surgery in his knee and will be out for about 6 months. But, storyline-wise, Kane chokeslammed him off the side of the stage, and is turning face against newcomer Gene Snitsky.

Brock Lesnar ended up winning the Rumble and fought Kurt Angle in one of the most hard-fought bouts at WrestleMania XIX. It was also cool to see Undertaker cheaply eliminate Kane and sort of plant the seeds for Kane's revenge later in the year at Survivor Series.

Overall, a good PPV, and a solid DVD. Average picture quality for a WWE show, and it boasts Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, as it should. Average special features, one extra RAW match, and it makes for a pretty good buy.",1098057600,,4434,4.6445012787723785

***** = The perfect match, the dream match, it's like Ricky Steamboat vs. Ric Flair!
****1/2 = An excellent match, worthy of rememberance
**** = Great match
***1/2 = A good match, only a few flaws...
*** = An okay match, worthy only for a mid-carded and below match
**1/2 = Not even worthy of a mainevent on RAW or SD!
** and below = Horrible performance. I might as well give the result of the match away to you, it's that simple.

First up is the contendership for the 29th entry into the Royal Rumble- Brock Lesnar vs. Big Show
A month earlier Brock had cost the title for Big Show out of revenge, and a match was made at the RR so that these two could contend for a spot in the rumble. The match is short, and thankfully so, but there are a few decent spots in this match. Very predictable outcome, though.
**1/2 (half a star taken off as a result of shortness, though match would've gotten worse throughout.)

World Tag Team Championship- The Dudleyz vs. Lance Storm and Regal
Short & Simple- this is WAY after the Dudleyz started to lose their spark. Regal and Storm are a team on RAW that nobody cared for that year. Add that with slow wrestling, basic holds and nobody caring about the outcome, and you got yourself a chapter skip.
**

Dawn Marie vs. Torrie Wilson
A women's match that started because of the death of Torrie's dad, who was also Dawn's on-screen husband. As the storyline was just as stupid and pathetic as it was, the match was just as bad. I won't go into detail, but Torrie wins with a swinging neck breaker of all moves.
*

World Heavyweight Championship- Triple H vs. Scott Steiner
The match happened because HHH was bragging about how he was the champ. Scott Steiner comes out of nowhere, challenges him, and gets a match at the Rumble. Weeks earlier, Trips had challenged Steiner to posing, arm wrestling and push-up contests, with Scott winning them all.
The match itself is not TOO bad, but is quite slow and repetitive. HHH is definitely good when he has good talent to carry him through the match, but Scott isn't good enough. The crowd gets restless when Steiner repeats the same belly-to-belly suplexes about 8 times, and the ring psychology is poor, but no match could've toppled Angle's and Chris' match later on. HHH's and Steiner's No Way Out match is better though, because the Canadian crowd boos Steiner, and cheers HHH. Just thought I'd let you know that...
***

EDIT: Man, I must've been on drugs when I first reviewed this, because it was absolutely dreadful!

WWE Championship Match- Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit.
The match was announced once Benoit beat Big Show on a SmackDown! episode, and the feud started once Kurt had his lackeys, Shelton Benjamin & Charlie Haas to attack Chris while Kurt was injured. Kurt had later revealed that his knee-injury wasn't as bad as was reported, so Kurt could defend his title at the Royal Rumble after all to Benoit. Kurt looked like an underdog to Chris on SD! epidodes, so you knew that Chris had a great deal of chance winning at RR.
The match itself- what can I say? It is without a doubt the best match of 2003, and the only ***** match in recent history. This is the best Kurt-Benoit match I have seen, and is definitely better than their WrestleMania X7 match. The technicality is tremendous, the psychology is perfect, the effort shown by both men would bewilder anyone and the crowd goes crazy in the dying moments and during all of the submission moves. In fact, this is without any argument better than the mainevents at WrestleManias XV through to XX- it is just that good. While every other match has it flaws at any PPV, this one has none. I will say no more.
*****

The Royal Rumble
Some of the storylines based around the Rumble were that Shawn Michaels and Chris Jericho had been fighting over the #1 entry spot, because they both liked the thought of being known as the greatest because they won the Rumble while being in the ring for the whole time. Also, Undertaker returned at the Rumble after being 'injured' at the hands of the Big Show on SD!, and had a #30 entry.
All I will say is this- Jericho puts on one hell of a performance for the long time that he remains in the Rumble, and I enjoyed his effort just as much as that of Ric Flair's Rumble performance back at '92. This also sets the stage for Jericho vs. Michaels at WrestleMania XIX.
**** (maybe even ****1/2, considering that it must go on for longer than 45 minutes)

The DVD's best features are the 3 Undertaker returns video teasers, which I like because they blend the music well with the clips, and the extra 4-man battle royal match, which has Batista, Jericho, Kane and RVD fighting it out to determine who gets to choose their entry in the Rumble. The match itself is decent.

Overall, this PPV gets ***. It would get more, but the first 3 matches make this PPV just that much more worse.",1092614400,4,5027,4.4841530054644805

Winner Advances to the Royal Rumble

Brock Lesnar v. The Big Show- way way too predictable, but serves it's purpose.. Lesnar wins fast 3.5/10

World Tag Team Championship

Lance Storm and William Regal (c) v. The Dudley Boys

Not going to knock your socks off by any means, but is a solid undercard match. 5/10

Dawn Marie v. Torrie Wilson

Yeah....not the greatest.. Interesting storyline, but the match just stinks the joint out. 2/10

World Heavyweight Championship

Triple H (c) v. Scott Steiner

Honestly, I too think this match gets a bad rap. Steiner is VERY slow and obviously isn't in any kind of wrestling shape, but puts on an entertaining match for most to the time. The whole Triple H running scared was a tad lame though. 6.5/10

WWE Championship

Kurt Angle (c) v. Chris Benoit

Match of the year. Technical masterpiece. Not much else can be said. 10/10

ROYAL RUMBLE MATCH

I enjoyed this match because it really started to develop some good feuds leading into WM, especially between Jericho and HBK.. excellent Rumble match 8.5/10

Overall a sound ppv... I'd say a MUST rent, but you won't go wrong buying it either. The Benoit/Angle match is too good to pass up. The rest of the card lacks a little however.",1091750400,,1280,4.698198198198198

This was a pretty average tag team match. Regal get the brass knucks, but D-Von steals them and uses them. An ok tag team match. 6/10

A lot of people say this match sucked, and it's easy to see why. Steiner proves that he is definitely NOT worthy of being in the main event of anything. The match was slow and plodding, Steiner kept using the same move over and over, and to top it all off the match ends in a DQ. And why the hell did Steiner get a rematch the next month at No Way Out? He's a mid-carder now though, which is just as well. 4/10
WWE Title - Kurt Angle V Chris Benoit
This match absolutely saved the show! It was awesome! A match of the year candidate! Both competitors gave it everything they had, and the pulled off some incredible moves. Angle and Benoit are 2 of the best technical wrestlers ever, and they proved it in this match. The finish was clean as well. After the match both men receive standing ovations, and they were well deserved. I never used to like technical matches as much as hardcore style matches, but this converted me. One of the best matches I've seen! 10/10

This was a great rumble match, but not as good as 2001. The only problems were that there were too many men in the ring at once, and also the ending came quite suddenly. Also, Brock won after coming in at 29. I think he should have come in earlier.  It was pretty surprising to see HBK eliminated so soon, but Jericho did well. Overall a great rumble, one of the best I've seen. 9/10

1847064,4,B00008HC9X,"Plot Details: This opinion reveals major details about the movie''s plot.
Ah, ""Royal Rumhle 2003"", this year's Rumble from
Boston , Massachusetts. One of
the more competitive Rumble's in past history.
Looking at the first PPV for the new year, you can
predict which superstar will have a big year, this
year it was Brock Lesnar, although big names like
Kane, The Undertaker, A Train, Batista, dominated
the Rumble. However, special consideration goes
to Chris Jericho who almost won despite being the number
2 participant, Jericho last almost to the very end
before Shawn Michaels (already eliminated) comes
back to cheapshot Jericho and cause his elimination
by Test.
However, before the Rumble there were several title
matches, Chris Benoit vs. Kurt Angle for the WWE
Championship, Scott Steiner vs. Triple HHH for
the WCW Championship, The Dudley Boys vs. Lance
Storm and Steve Reagal for the WWE Championship
and Brock Lesnar vs. The Big Show for a special
match in which the winner would gain an entry
into the Rumble itself.
Brock Lesnar vs. Big Show for qualification rights to the
Rumble
Big Show beats up Lesnar at one point choke slamming
him out of the ring!! However, Lesnar regroups
and gives Show a series of slams and suplexes, Paul
Heyman , the manager of Show tries to interfere
but to no avail, no surprise who the winner is here,
Brock.
The Dudley Boys vs. Storm and Reagal.
Reagal and Storm picked up cheap victories defending
their titles, but that would come into an end
here or would it ?
During one point, the Dudley do their infamous flying
headbutt to the groin area of Reagal and we think it's
over it's over. Storm comes in to make the save, then
Regal as he is accustomed to doing goes for his brass
knuckles and attempts to use them, but it backfires as
the Dudleys use it on Storm and the rest is history.
However, the next night on Raw , Raw general manager
Eric Bishoff and Chief Morley(Val Venis) reverse
the decision of this match...
Torrie Wilson vs. Dawn Marie the first
ever Stepmother vs. Stepdaughter match. LOL
Whatever.
This came about when Dawn married Al Wilson then
Al Wilson supposedly died from the ""excitement"" of
being with Dawn. Idiotic but funny.
This is the 2nd ppv meeting with Dawn and Torrie
going back to WWE No Mercy last year. Both
are hot divas though. Torrie from WCW and Dawn
Marie from WCW have really given the WWE a boost
in the ratings with their obvious ""assets"".
Dawn tackles Torrie down in a fit of rage, then Torrie
spears Dawn back, and what ensues can be best described
as a cat fight. LOL Great for fans.
Scott Steiner ""Big Poppa Pump"" vs. Champion
Triple HHH for WCW Championship.
A bit of a rivalry here, although Steiner should
have gotten a title shot in the first place. In 2 months
in WWE he hadn't really beaten anyone except Matt
Hardy and Steven Richards, but yet Triple HHH or
more specifically Eric Bishoff wanting big ratings
signed Scott Steiner and gave him this title shot.
Triple HHH aint happy before the Rumble we see what
has gone down between the two, HHH offers several
challenges to Scott which he defeats, Triple HHH
in the finale of these challenges then says the hell
with it and attacks Steiner. Steiner fights back,
and literally strips HHH to his bare underwear
embarassing the champ.
At the start HHH tries to deliver kill quickly punching
and doing anything he can to win. It doesn't work with
Steiner being one probably the fittest wrestler
Triple HHH has faced. However give credit HHH does
hang in to make it a match. However, the end
of the match is pure crap as Triple HHH in trying
to hold on to the title tries to get himself
disqualified. Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts on a website
called www.theinteractiveinterview.com, a new site
with interviews called ""Triple HHH"" crap because
HHH in the past years has used sledgehammers, and chairs
to get disqualified and retain the title and it happens
here. Too bad for Steiner, worse for Triple HHH though
because a true champion does not get himself
disqualified out of fear to hold on to the title.
Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit for the WWE Title.
Chris Benoit was at one point WCW Champion beaten
Sid Vicious in WCW Souled Out. Then he had the dubious
honor to be the WWF Champion for about 20 seconds
after beaten the Rock for the title only to have
Mick Foley reverse the decision, so it's been
a long time for Benoit to get a title about 2 yrs
worth. He and Angle put one hell of a match, nearly
20 minutes in length. At one point both men exchange
finishes, Benoit with his crippler cross face and
Angle with his Angle lock. To make the long story short,
Angle miracoulsy pulls out the surprise ending, despite
the fact that Benoit gives Angle several flying
headbutts and at one points almost knocks out
Angle unconscious with a German release suplex
that sends Angle flying and almost breaks his neck.
Now the Royal Rumble itself what memorable moments
their were, the one that sticks in the beginning
is when Chris Jericho and Christian switch identities
to trick the idiot Shawn Michaels into thinking Jericho
is coming to the ring when Jericho is already in the ring,
and gives a chairshoto to Michaels eliminating.
Beautiful since Michaels career has been etched
on cheapshots on other wrestlers (Bret Hart).
Then in a funny turn of events, Christian tries
to team up with his brother Edge but Edge wants
none of it and beats up his former brother.
Likewise the Jeff Hardy and Matt Hardy confrontation
is funny too , although Jeff Hardy gets eliminated
early showing that perhaps his best days are over while
Matt last almost to the end.
Then the Royal Rumle match for the 4th year in a row
becomes a hardcore match when Tommy Dreamer comes
into the ring with kendo sticks and proceeds
to assaults everyone in the ring!!! Hilarious, simply
hilarious. Look at the Carnage!!! LOL
However, this also becomes a dumb move as Dreamer
is targeted himself.
Pretty soon the big names start coming in A Train,
Booker T, Rob Van Dam, Kane , Rikishi, and new
faces like Team Angle come into the ring, all
leading to the big entrances and domination
of the Undertaker, Batista and Brock Lesnar.
Looking back at this Rumble, the Undertaker should
have won hands down, during one point he and Lesnar
fight with the Undertaker once again beaten on Lesnar,
however, Batista and Kane divert the Undertaker's
attention then in a really cheap victory Lesnar
comes from behind and well you can imagine what
happens after that....
Undertaker gets screwed, Lesnar highlites the main
event at Wrestlemania XIX 19, and the rest is history,
although Lesnar like Triple HHH has been a coward
getting himself disqualified in title defenses and
in a couple of cases makes the challenger wrestle
twice (like Chris Benoit) to wear him down and
take advantage.
Still a classic Rumble in itself despite the obvious
screwings of several wrestlers.",1078876800,,6873,4.685690653432589
1847065,3,B00008HC9X,"I always order this pay-per-view for the Rumble match itself, yet Angle vs. Benoit was the real standout of this show.  They delivered such a tremendous match, and was quite possibly the best match of '03.  I love these two guys.  They always deliver and make almost everyone look better.  I probably liked it even more for washing away the bitter taste of Triple H vs. Scott Steiner.  Steiner kept doing one move to death, botched another move big time, and looked tired.  Triple H certainly wasn't that good to carry him to something watchable.  Since then, though, Triple H has moved on to opponents who can deliver really good matches, while Steiner has improved (not too hard to do after this match) and relegated to the mid-card.
I really enjoyed the Rumble match itself, despite its predictable ending.  I always get a kick out of this match every year.  The Tag Team Title match and Brock Lesnar vs. Big Show were decent yet forgettable.  Torrie Wilson vs. Dawn Marie was the blowoff match to one of the most hilariously bad angles in years.

He was slow and clumsy.  I wouldn't be surprised if HHH confronted him in the back about his sub-standard performance.
The match between Brock and Big Show was predictable.  Everyone on the planet could have picked Brock to win that match.
The match between Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit was by far the best match of the night (and a match of the year candidate).  These two always give a great effort.  Benoit and Angel received a standing ovation after the match was over.

The man was wrestling himself for crying out loud, and if you pay attention, you can see him bitching at Steiner. Steiner did the same move for about five minutes.

-Lance Storm and William Regal (c) vs Dudley Boyz

A stepdaughter vs stepmother match. Dear lord, what did we do to deserve this? At the time, Torrie wasn't good in the ring at all (she has since gotten better) and Dawn is just rolling around like she has no clue how she got in there in the first place! Terrible match.
*/*****
-HHH (c) vs Scott Steiner
For the World Heavyweight Championship. As you can see from my name, I'm a big Steiner fan, but this match was flat out horrible. Steiner had been away from wrestling for a while, and he comes back. He has a tremendous body, but he was out of shape. There was constant slow downs in the match to give Steiner some time to rest, and he did about ten belly-to-belly suplexs. He went into that match as the fan favorite, but came out with a ton of boos.
**/*****
Kurt Angle (c) vs Chris Benoit
Match of the year 2003, in my opinion. Two great wrestlers hooking it up. After years in the business, Benoit has a chance to be on top. Great technical match, which is something not seen a whole lot today, lots of reversals, submission holds. They could turn it up, but also slow it down and still have it be an amazing match. You'll be seeing this one on a classic network twenty years from now.

-The Royal Rumble
It's kind of hard to enjoy something when you flat out know what the result of the match is going to be. Which was the case for this. However, that's not to say that it wasn't worth it. Many guys that are worthy to win the Royal Rumble, Jericho, Michaels, Kane, among a host of others. There were some mistakes made in there that were nicely covered up, but still noticable.

World Tag Team Titles - Un-Americans vs. Dudleyz.  This match was ok, but I say ok because it was kinda sloppy.  I'm sure both teams could of done a better job, and for that I give it **.

World Heavyweight Title - Triple H vs. Scott Steiner.  Ya know I had heard from just about everyone that this match was horrible, and I thought to myself nah it can't be that bad.

WWE Championship - Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit.  If it wasn't for this match, I'd give this ppv about 2 stars, or 1 star, but this match saved the show.  It's close to the end of 2003, and this match was probably the greatest match of the year.  These men put on a match like you wouldn't believe.

1847078,4,B00008HC9X,"While not as good as the 2002 Royal Rumble, the 2003 Royal Rumble still held it's ground in comparison to past Royal Rumble's. The card was decent with only one or two blemishes and the Rumble itself was decent, but not as good as the previous year's. Here's the card:
Brock Lesnar vs The Big Show w/Paul Heyman:The Winner Advances to the Royal Rumble Match- Heyman had screwed Lesnar at the Survivor Series and helped the Big Show become WWE Champion. Now Lesnar was finally getting his hands on The Big Show after costing the Big Show the title to Kurt Angle at Armageddon. The novelty of someone manhandling the Big Show the way Lesnar does had yet to subside when this match took place. Overall, it was a decent match and it was kept short as to not expose any of the Big Show's weaknesses. Not as good as their Survivor Series match, but still a decent Big Show match. I give it 7 out of 10 stars.
Lance Storm and William Regal vs. The Dudley Boyz for the World Tag Team Championship-The Dudley Boyz are always involved in a tag title match at the Royal Rumble. In 2000 the fought the hardyz. At the 2001 RR they fought Edge and Christian and at the 2002 RR they fought Spike Dudley and Tazz. The Dudleyz had been trying to get their hands on the tag team championships since they reunited at the Survivor Series and this looked to be the night that they would finally get their chance. The only problem with this match is what happened the next night on RAW, which pretty much made this match pointless. Nonetheless a somewhat decent match, I give this one 7 out of 10 as well.
Torrie Wilson vs Dawn Marie in a ""Stepdaughter vs. Stepmother"" match- IF they're going to put a women's match on a ppv it should be a Women's Title match. However, this was before Torrie Wilson's Playboy spread so they were trying to get her some more exposure. Thankfully, this match was kept short as it should be, but with an obvious outcome this match is hampered. 5 out of 10 stars.
Triple H w/Ric Flair vs Scott Steiner for the World Heavyweight Championship- Whenever anyone talks about the 2003 Royal Rumble they talk about how horrible this match is and they may be right. However, when I watch a match with Scott Steiner in it I don't expect a technical match. I have never watched a Scott Steiner match and gone ""Man what an awesome match."" With that said Steiner is not what he used to be. He has lost a step he seems almost as slow as Hogan when he is in the ring. Couple that with the fact that HHH was also coming off of an injury and you have the makings of a stinker. I give it 6 out of 10 stars.
Kurt Angle vs Chris Benoit for the WWE Championship- Any match with Benoit and Angle is a classic and this is no exception. Benoit is probably one of if not the greatest technical wrestler in the world right now. The only thing that he is missing is a Heavyweight Championship around his waist. It's too bad that this is not his night. Still, the match is off the charts. I could try and do justice describing it, but it would not do it justice. 10 out of 10 stars.
Royal Rumble Match 15 Wrestlers from RAW and 15 Wrestlers from Smackdown-Am I the only one that dislikes how the WWE has been announcing who is in the Rumble? It kind of throws off the suprise of who is coming out next and any potential suprise returns. The Rumble itself is good. I actually like the openeing swerve with Jericho,HBK and Christian. An obvious ending hampers this from being a great Rumble. 8 out of 10 stars.
The dvd itself comes with some nice extras. A bonus match from RAW and a number of promos hyping the actual event.",1064620800,,3604,4.317109144542773
1847079,4,B00008HC9X,"The WWE present their annual pay-per-view, the Royal Rumble, this past January, and it's now available on DVD.  Featured matches include Triple H defending his title against Scott Steiner, Kurt Angle defending against Chris Benoit, and the Royal Rumble Match where superstars enter the ring every 90 seconds.
The show was average by WWE standards, with a pair of pretty good title matches.  The Steiner-Triple H match was far better then many give it credit for, and the Benoit-Angle match was off the charts as expected.  The Rumble Match started off great, with Jericho lasting for over 40 minutes, but it did have some slow spots to it.  At one point over twelve men were in the ring, which is too much for a Rumble.  The choices for the final four in the ring was somewhat surprising, but the winner wasn't.  It had a very anti-climactic ending.
As for the extras, the WWE loaded this DVD in my opinion.  It featured a match from Raw six days before the event, several pre and post-match interviews, two Confidential segments, and several Royal Rumble commercials.  Overall, this is an excellent DVD for WWE fans, despite being an average event.",1062374400,,1149,4.7969543147208125

Big Show vs. Brock Lesnar
This was the second of a long list of Show/Lesnar matches. They had some cool moves in here, but it's nothing spectacular. Except the German Suplex was pretty cool. **
Raw Tag Titles
William Regal & Lance Storm (c) vs. The Dudley Boyz
Your typical Raw tag match. Nothing spectacular, or that I even remember. It was quite boring as both teams were quite stale. *1/2
Dawn Marie vs. Torrie Wilson
For the poor saps who actually watched this 'match', I feel sorry for you. Wait...that would make me a sap as well. Oh well, the match was just under four minutes, and with the addition of airing the whole horrible feud they had before this match. I would say this could have been the worst feud of the year if it had actually ended in 2002, but I guess Vince thought that it was important to put this match on a PPV because everybody wanted to see it. Oh right, a -****. Yes, that's a minus four stars.
Raw World Title
Triple H (c) vs. Scott Steiner
This is what bothered me the most about the other reviews. They didn't make fun of this match at all. Nor did they even say this match was bad...it was possibly the worst title match I have ever seen. The match had no flow, as it seemed like they were just doing move after move to each other. Steiner did about twelve belly to belly suplexes, and screwed up a powerbomb. If not for Ric Flair, the match would have dipped into minus five star territory. Both men were booed out of the building. -***
Smackdown World Title
Kurt Angle (c) vs. Chris Benoit
The best match of 2003 thus far. I can't believe how amazing this match was, and was defiantely the best these two have had. This would be the only reason to even RENT Royal Rumble. At the end the crowd give a huge standing ovation to Benoit who really deserved it. *****
Royal Rumble
I usually enjoy Royal Rumbles, but this year was rather boring and sluggish. After Jericho was eliminated, you can turn the PPV off, nothing of interest happens. **
I rated this DVD a 2 because of the amazing Benoit-Angle match, and if you can find this for under 10 bucks, then I would tell you to buy it...other than that, don't bother. Keep your money for better wrestling PPVs.",1059004800,,2339,4.318181818181818

Plus the Royal Rumble Match was one of the best. All around the match was great to watch. Now slow points. The names just keep rolling in. Unlike past Rumbles when no-name jobbers filled the ring. WWE actually did a very good job with this. One of my favorite Royal Rumble Matches, if not the favorite.

Some very solid matches include Lance Storm and Steven Reagal vs. The Dudley Boys and the best Royal Rumble match since 1997. But all that away, this event had the best WWE title match of all time, and one of the worst. Let's go ahead and get the bad out of the way:
Scott Steiner vs. Triple H
Oh, gosh this is hilarious! This thing is FILLED with botched spots, character breaks, and loooooooooong rest holds. For those of you who have not had the torture of seeing this classic, lemme tell ya: It's bad. I think most WWE fans going into this match was really hyped up, cause, i have to admit, it had great build up. But after about 5 minutes of action or whatever, half the crowd turned on the baby face Steiner. While Trips is in no great kind of shape currently, he tried to keep this match up so badly. Oh did he try. It's like watching a b-movie, camp movie. And to think that they headlined another ppv the next month? Jeez...
Now the good:
Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit
Having seen most of their matches and owning them (cage on Raw, 2 single matches of 2k2 on SD!, single from WM17, Submission from Backlash 2k1, 2/3 falls from Judgement day 2k1, and single from Unforgiven 2k2) I knew that they would have a great five star match. Hardly. It was the best any kind of title match that the wwe has ever had, followed closely by Owen VS. Bret from Summerslam. The match included incredible counters, dramatic intensity, and well balanced pace changes and style changes. I would have payed hundreds to have been able to seen it live.

O.K. let's talk about the first match, with the winner going into the Royal Rumble.
1. Brock Lesner vs. The Big Show
It was an O.K. match but should've been longer,and even though you haven't seen it you know who is gonna win.
3 stars
The next match is for the World Tag Team Championship
2. World Tag Team Championship
Willam Regal & Lance Storm vs. The Dudley Boyz
This one was also O.K. but not enough WRESTLING!!...
This was the first ever Step Mother vs. Step Daughter match
3. Torrie Wilson vs. Dawn Marie
Um...was this really a match???I'm just kidding, this match wasn't a classic but niether a sleeper. ...
2 stars  P.S. Dawn and Torrie are very pretty!!!
The next match was a World Heavyweight Championship match, which is just another name for W.C.W. championship
4. World Heavyweight Championship
Triple H vs. Scott Steiner
This match was disapponting and little boring but not terrible. But in my opinon Triple H should've lost but once again that long nosed freak uses a sludge hammer.
2 1/2 stars P.S. Triple H says on the video that he's beaten everybody but that not true because he hasn't beaten The Undertaker,Hulk Hogan,Brock Lesnar,Kevin Nash,Goldberg,Chris Benoit,Edge and so on.
Next is the WWE Championship
5. World Wrestling Entertainment Championship
Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit
... This match is a classic and guess what?
They actually wrestle! I love this match and happpy about it because Kurt didn't use Team Angle

1847113,4,B00008HC9X,"1.  Brock Lesnar vs. The Big Show  It is really hard to get excited about a Big Show match, and while Lesnar may be the Next Big Thing (or is he now a Big Thing since hes won the belt already?) he is not able to pull good matches out of less talented opponents.  This match was better than it should have been, but was still a nothing match.
2. World Tag Team title match: The Dudley Boyz vs. Lance Storm and William Regal (C)  You would think that a Tag Team match for the championship that includes one of the best tag teams in WWE history would be pretty good.  If you thought this, you would be wrong.  If not for the match that followed it, this match would be the worst match on the card.  Everyone put on a lackluster performance, and while it may have been nice to see the Dudleyz back together again, it does not make up for a bad match.
3. Torrie Wilson vs. Dawn Marie  This was the culmination of the horrible Al Wilson (Torries real life father) marriage angle with Dawn Marie.  This was such a horrible storyline that it rivals the Katie Vick angle for television garbage.  The wrestling itself (yes, there is a match buried in here) was garbage, too.  Just skip on to the next match, youll thank me for it.
4. World Heavyweight title match: Triple H (C) vs. Scott Steiner  I know, I know, I said to skip on to the next match and I bring you to this one.  Had this not been for a major championship belt or been this high on the card, I might be more forgiving.  However, this was for the RAW title.  This match was a stinker.  The match was flat out boring and Steiner did nothing put hit one suplex after another.  The only parts that were interesting was when Ric Flair got involved.
5. WWE Championship Match: Kurt Angle (C) vs. Chris Benoit  Can one match redeem everything that has come before it?  Yes.  Everytime that Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit get in the ring together we are treated with a clinic of everything that is right in wrestling today.  This is surely going to be one of the best matches of the year, even at this early date.  When the loser of the match gets a standing ovation, you know you just saw something special.
6. The Royal Rumble  This has always been my favorite type of match, and is probably why the Rumble is always one of my favorite PPVs.  Knowing what the main event at Wrestlemania was going to be, I knew who was going to win the Rumble (the winner gets a title shot at Wrestlemania), but even so, this is always a lot of fun to watch.  The premise is that two men start in the ring and every 90 seconds (usually two minutes) a new wrestler will enter the match.  A superstar is eliminated from the match when he is thrown over the top rope and both feet touch the floor.  When all 30 participants have entered the Rumble, the one man who is left in the ring is the winner and gets the shot at Wrestlemania.
On the strength of the last two matches, I enjoyed watching this event.  Angle/Benoit was a classic, and I always love the Rumble itself.  This is one PPV that is worth checking out and probably worth picking up.  Im happy with my purchase.",1050883200,,3101,4.2333901192504255
