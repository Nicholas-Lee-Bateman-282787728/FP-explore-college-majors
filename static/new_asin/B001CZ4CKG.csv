8290473,5,B001CZ4CKG,"We saw this flick at the Toronto Film Festival years back, when it was in the theatre next to the one we wanted to see. Excellently filmed story of the Estonian revolution, well-acted, superb use of color. It is classic verbonkos, intended to stir patriotic sentiment in young Estonians, much like Katyn is intended to stir Polish sentiment about the Soviet massacre in the woods.

We use a cheap outboard player hooked to our MacMini for non-North America region videos, I don't think it's smart to know that it's not in North America.",1397433600,,536,4.763440860215054
