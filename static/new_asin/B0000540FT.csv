It is quite funny to see Gohan try to talk like a hero and screw up. The downside to these episodes is there isn't too much fighting action, more comedy. Again its a must see to any loyal DBZ fan.",1022889600,2,368,3.8552631578947367
8261032,4,B0000540FT,"i reall like dbz. me, being such a big dbz fan (i do almost have 40 dbz vidz), find this tape being nuttin but a time filler. They just wanted the saga for comedy (except the other world tornament, which i think should be a totally different saga), and not fighting. even though i already know whats gonna happen all the way through dbgt, i still wanna see some buttkikking action!",992563200,2,381,4.380281690140845
8261033,4,B0000540FT,In this tape we find out that poor Gohan's mind was adversly affected by his encounter with the Ginyu force on Namek. He puts on a silly costume to fight crime as the Great Saiyaman and uses ridiculous poses and phrases that would do Captain Ginyu proud. Gohan of course thinks he is being cool.,985305600,4,295,4.381818181818182
