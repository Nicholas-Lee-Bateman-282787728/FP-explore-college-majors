1085064,2,6305874948,"Here's the story.  Two has been boxers get offered $100,000 to fight each other on the undercard of Mike Tyson.  They accept.  They get a ride.  They pick up a trampy girl.  They get to Vegas.  They fight.  I'll let you  figure out the rest.
Lolita Davidovich is the only interesting character  in this entire movie.  Woody Harrelson & Antonio Banderas are just  boring.  The first 2/3 of theis movie is their drive to Vegas.  They pick  up Lucy Lui - who is just so annoying.  The best part of the movie is when  Lolita Davidovich punches her out.  The last 1/3 of this movie is decent.  It's the fight.  Although it is plagued with images of naked women...why -  we don't know - it's still semi-interesting.
The ending is just so  predictable.  I don't even need to elaborate on it.  Don't waste your money  buying or renting this one.  Wait for it to come out on cable.",961113600,,872,4.367088607594937
1085065,3,6305874948,"When Touchstone released their preview of this movie, they made is come across as a comedy.  Actually Play it to the Bone is closer to the Rocky movies than it is any comedy.  Aside from that, if I never saw the previews  I would have liked this movie a whole lot more.  Im not saying it is bad,  it is actually pretty good.  It is a little slow in a couple of places but  this is still an entertaining movie.  Woody Harrelson and Antonio Banderas  are both great.

1085067,1,6305874948,"With this movie being as bad as it was it is no surprise that it was only  in theaters for about a week. Woody was way out of the caliber of  performances that we all know that he can do. Antonio was about the same in  this movie as he has been in all of his other pahtetic films. Lucy Liu may  be attractive, but it is not worth having to watch this attrocious film  just for her.",959731200,2,381,3.8333333333333335
1085068,2,6305874948,"A ""vehicle"" movie, contrived to give one actress and two demi actors  something to do.  Keep 'em working, they always say.  In this case, it's the  writer-director Ron Shelton's wife who needs to stay up there on the silver  screen, and this fabricated piece of superficiality is what  resulted.

The funny thing is, she, Lolita Davidovich, is the only  element that lends  some base of style and credibility to the journey.  This is an actress who  should be in much greater demand than she is.  Her  poise, intelligence and  singular beauty are a wonder to behold, even in  such poor trappings.

The angle is that the two guys (Woody Harrelson  and Antonio Banderas) are boxers and great buddies.  They've fallen  on  hard times in terms of careers but suddenly are offered a substitution  slot in an upcoming big fight in Vegas.  Only, they have to fight each  other,  which they're loathe to do.

After a tedious mix of  testosterone and one-upmanship, they do, of course,  fight, and the  proceedings are as predictable as can be.  ~~ The Filmiliar Cineaste",956275200,2,1062,4.776536312849162
1085098,1,6305874948,"I thought this movie was going to be about a boxing match, but it is actually about the road trip getting there.  Nothing happens for the first hour and a half.  They meet Lucy Liu.  Then she leaves.  I don't know why her character was in the movie.  They exchange Tarantinoism's all along the way about life and what's cool.  The characters are the worst.  The dialogue is the worst.  It's not funny.  There is very little plot.  There isn't even very much boxing.  Woody Harrelson cannot act, no matter how hard he tries.  Maybe he should lay off the marijuana, because it makes him into a boring, monotonous character.  As terrible as it is, it may not be as bad as that other Woody Harrelson movie Natural Born Killers.  Plan 9 from Outer Space, Troll 2, and Robot Monster are way better than this.",1444176000,,802,4.441379310344828

1085127,4,6305874948,"I must confess at first to be a Ron Shelton fan. I like his triangle love stories. Most loved Bull Durham and Tin Cup. Antonio Banderas and Wooy Harrelson make a likeable couple who both love the same woman - Lolita Davidovich. The men are friends and colleagues both being not really successful professional boxers. The triangle's journey to Las Vegas allows to get aquainted with and fall for the three characters. Everything leads to the final fight where the both have to fight against each other. And they play it to the bone. I am not a boxing fan and I am very glad that the both actually did not have to hurt each other in reality but these scenes are very beautifully set into scene. Tin Cup already had some cameo roles and Ron Shelton brought it to the boil on this movie - Kevin Costner (leading actor on Tin Cup and Bull Durham),Whesley Snipes, Tony Curtis, Rod Stuart, Mike Tyson, George Foreman and many more throw in celibrity power to this boxing event.

1085131,3,6305874948,"These two women grace the movie and it is a pleasure to watch them, especially when Lolita gets that red dress on at the end.

I don't want to give the ending away but do not think, the ending was all that predictable, I mean for the Rocky movies, we know, he's usually going to win, but there are a number of ways to get there.

So, maybe this is the first boxing movie of the new millenium; or maybe it is another Woody Harrelsen sports movie, the previous one I know of being ""white man can't jump"" of the basketball genre.

Tom Sizemore does fine in his role; Lucy Liu and Lolita Davidovich fill in their roles well enough. Antonio and Woody really aren't the boxing types, not the biceps you might see on a real boxer, but I wouldn't let that stand in the way of the plot.

A little zany, not a classic but not as bad as what some say.",1167696000,,840,4.103658536585366
1085132,1,6305874948,"I'm a fan of schlock and b-movies, so I can't honestly say that ""Play it to the Bone"" is the worst movie I've ever seen, at least from a technical standpoint. The cinematography is alright. It features name actors and what appears to be a budget. Compared to some of the dreck I've waddled through over the years, ""Play it to the Bone"" at least meets some bare minimum threshold to qualify as a movie, and that's more than I can say for, say, ""Burial Ground"" or ""Challenge of the Lady Ninja.""

On the other hand, I can't think of any other movie that actually aspires to be good and fails so completely as this one. If a b-movie aspires to be an hour and a half of trashy entertainment, provided it doesn't bore me I'm more than willing to sit through plot gaps, eye-rolling dialogue, technical incompetence, etc. When a movie features Woody Harrelson and Antonio Bandares - not to mention a budget - I expect ... I don't know - a plot? Characters I care about? A laugh or two? Something?

I'm not going to bother to rehash what little plot you'll find in ""Play it to the Bone."" Just trust me on this on: About a half hour in, the movie turns into the most anoying and uneventful buddy flick you've ever seen. Neither of the main characters ever springs to life, which is even more incredible when you consider that Harrelson and Bandares seem to have some charisma. Absolutely nothing at all happens except for some ""wacky hijinks"" along the way that won't even make you smile. The climactic fight scene at the end is poorly shot and just ridiculous.

The only reason to see this movie is to witness maybe the most collosal waste of time, effort and money Hollywood has pinched off in years. Don't even consider renting this dreck.",1116201600,2,1732,4.474683544303797
1085133,1,6305874948,"Antonio Banderas and Woody Harrelson hook up with a current/ex girlfriend who gives them a ride to Vegas, where they will be boxing one another in a high profile bout. That is the basic premise of the film. At first glance, one would think that such a decent cast would make something of this movie.

Instead, we get a lot of useless yacking, arguing, and spilling of inner most secrets on the road that leave viewers yawning. How I made it to the last half hour of the movie still amazes me, because I did end up asking myself why I was watching this crap when there was probably a more interesting weather report on somewhere. The characters are not even remotely likable.

The fight itself is filled with confusing imagery that really makes little sense. Sex and boxing do not come together well.

This film is so bad that it isn't even entertaining in its horrendocity (new word?). There are bad films a person can watch without feeling as though they have been robbed of two hours of their life. This is not one of them, and I am confident in calling it the worst movie ever made.

1085134,3,6305874948,"This film has been knocked down more times than Dominguez and Boudreau in the climatic final fight scene. Sure the story was a bit uneven, but I still liked this quirky buddy/road trip movie for its unexpected and offbeat take that includes a seamier side of professional boxing. Antonio Banderas and Woody Harrelson are  likeable stars and I thought they played off each other very well. While Harrelson is known to shift effortlessly from dramatic to comedic roles and back again, this was the first time I saw a lighter, more humorous side of Banderas and I thought he acquitted himself very well. Talented and sexy Lolita Davidovich as their street smart and savvy love interest was as much a welcomed casting choice as Lucy Liu's was a total waste of time other than being the object of Harrelson's vivid backseat description of her femininity prior to a hilarious if impromptu and primitive tryst. A host of cameo appearances fill out the rest of the card. Don't bring high expectations to the match and you won't be unduly disappointed, and you just may be mildly entertained for 2 hours.",1091836800,5,1095,4.7936507936507935

For some strange reason the movie felt refreshing, at times exciting and overall pleasant despite broken eyes, jaws and bloody everything at the end.
I thought the characters were plausible, actions and emotions were credible for the most part, music was good. It seemed like a medium-to small- budget movie, definitely off beat, but heck, it takes all kinds, doesn't it?
The only character I did not at all dig was Lucy Liu's. She simply was too trashy for my taste. Besides, I think she is too ugly to play an arm candy... But that's just my humble opinion.",1037923200,3,714,4.458015267175573

1085178,2,6305874948,"I don't like sports movies. I rarely see them and even more rarely enjoy them. I liken them to those insipid films like Backdraft or Days of Thunder - ""revealing the gritty reality of ____ (fill in your favorite hazardous career)."" Of the few sports films I did enjoy, Ron Shelton made Bull Durham and White Men Can't Jump. Luckily though, this is not a sports film at all. It's really about a road trip. Maybe that's where he went wrong this time.
Cesar Dominguez (Antonio Banderas) and Vince Boudreau (Woody Harrelson) are washed up boxers given the opportunity to open for a Mike Tyson fight in Vegas. They have 6 hours or so to get there from LA and the winner gets a shot at the middle weight title. They snatch up Grace Pasic (Lolita Davidovich) and head off across the desert mountains to beat each other senseless. This is the entirety of the plot.
Even given this paltry reason for existence, Banderas and Harrelson are almost able to make something interesting out of this film. Banderas especially does an excellent job with what he's given, considering that his only task is to argue with Harrelson. And Shelton's confusion over where this film should be driving tends to leave the audience hemmed in along with the actors. Add to this the fact that both men are in love with Davidovich's noncommital Grace and that she may or may not be in love with one or more of them and it's no wonder the audience may feel more than a little confused as well.
Even the climactic fight scene, however well choreagraphed, doesn't have the cahones required to make this story into the film that you can sense is lying in wait just behind this one - a film in which the disregard for political correctness does more than make low-blow jokes.
What Play it to the Bone needs is someone like the Coen brothers who can see it for what it is and take advantage of it's strengths (namely the cast) and wouldn't hinder it with feel good sapiness. Shelton's made a good pitch for the film that he should have made. Too bad for us he didn't live up to it.",976492800,,2043,4.479892761394102

1085183,3,6305874948,"`Play It To The Bone' is really two movies.  One is a movie about boxing and the other is a comedic character study of the boxers.  As a boxing film, it succeeds nicely.  As a comedy it has its moments.  As a character  study, it hits the canvas hard.
The storyline was sort of `Rocky' times  two.  Two washed up middleweight boxers Vince and Cesar (Woody Harrelson  and Antonio Banderas), who are also best friends, get a last minute chance  to fight in Las Vegas on the undercard of a Mike Tyson heavyweight bout  when the two scheduled fighters are unable to fight.  They are promised  that the winner will get a chance to fight for the championship, but they  have to be in Las Vegas tonight.  The trouble is, they have to fight each  other.
So they climb into a car with Cesar's girlfriend (and Vince's  ex-girlfriend) Grace (Lolita Davidovich) and drive from L.A. to Las Vegas.  Most of the rest of the movie is about the drive followed by the  fight.
Director Ron Shelton has had quite a few sports oriented success  stories to his credit (Bull Durham, White Men Can't Jump and Tin Cup).  The  best part of the film was the boxing.  The boxing was well choreographed  and both actors were athletic and fought like real boxers.  Shelton was  also excellent at creating the feel of a boxing match.  Anyone who has ever  watched an HBO bout will recognize ring announcers Jim Lampley, Larry  Merchant and George Foreman.  Mike Tyson made a cameo as well as numerous  celebrity boxing fans (Kevin Costner, Rod Stewart, Wesley Snipes and a host  of others).  The makeup for the cuts and puffiness was also very  realistic.
Unfortunately, the rest of the film was not as good as the  fight.  Shelton spends a good deal of time developing the characters, but  it is all for naught because they have no substance.  They are two hapless  jocks, obvious mental lightweights, who spend most of the trip to Las Vegas  fighting over Grace, cutting up and strutting around like peacocks.  Shelton takes great pains to try to make us love these characters equally  by making them equally pathetic.  But that doesn't work because it leaves  the audience without anyone to pull for in the fight.  The ending is  utterly predictable and the film whimpers off into the sunset with no more  than a stagger.
Banderas and Harrelson both gave journeyman performances.  They had good chemistry and some decent comedy between them, but there was  nothing special here.  The best performance by far was by Davidovich who  transcended her normal sex kitten role and took command of the entire film  with a character that was a manipulative vixen.  She was smart, tough and  sexy, and dominated every scene.  Once again, she shows that she is  talented as well as attractive, which makes me wonder why she has never  gotten roles that are more substantial.
This is a tough one to rate  because it does some things very well and other things poorly.  I gave it a  6/10.  It had some good comedic moments, but not enough of them.  It had  some excellent boxing scenes, but a disappointing outcome.  In addition,  the character study simply failed due to vacant characters.  If you like  boxing, Harrelson, Banderas or especially Davidovich, you will enjoy this  film.  Otherwise, enter at your own risk.",963187200,9,3280,4.686725663716814
1085184,2,6305874948,"Major disappointment. I admit, for the first half hour or so, I was into it. The premise seemed like fun, Woody and Antonio were interesting. But then, the movie falls flat on its face. The first hour and more turns into  a rambling ""road movie"" as Vince (Harrelson) and Cesar (Banderas)  head to Vegas as a last minute substitution on a Tyson undercard. Vince and  Cesar are friends that are going to fight each other publically for the  first time.
The premise was workable and the actors were talented enough  to pull it off. Lolita Davidovich and Lucy Liu, are also solid - you just  wonder why they would take roles so beneath them.
The plot and the  directing needed a lot of work. If you're anything like me, the beginning  of the movie will have you saying ""Gee, this is better than I  thought,"" but then you'll be slowly turned off as it progresses into a  blithering waste of time. No resolution, no lesson's learned, nothing.  The  movie chooses to not take risks, not make any decisions. To polish it off,  the DVD is bereft of any special features worth noting. This movie is a  pointless waste of two hours. The only reason it gets two stars instead of  one is that the actors really tried to make it better than it was.",961891200,3,1234,4.446428571428571
1085185,3,6305874948,"...""What happened?"" I mean, this is the man that gave us ""White Men Can't Jump"" and ""Bull Durham."" The ending was ludicrous. Shelton isn't known for taking the easy way out in his movies. Still, it's worth 3 stars: one apiece for Lolita Davidovich and  Lucy Liu, and one for the spectacular camera work in the fight between  Harrelson and Banderas.",961372800,2,348,4.688524590163935
1085186,2,6305874948,"Ron Shelton loves stories about fringe-dwelling losers:  Bull Durham, White Men Can't Jump, and Tin Cup...wonderful movies that all present characters who are interesting, funny, and complex beyond the probability  of their lives.  Much of this ""complexity"" comes from the  characters they rub elbows with, and the situations they find themselves  in.
Play it to the Bone has similar losers--a couple of boxers who had  shots at a title, and blew it, and are given a second chance.
Unbelievably, two fighters who were to open for a Tyson bout in Vegas  are disabled, one killed in a car wreck, and one OD'd, hours before the  fight.
Tom Sizemore's character, a fat, sleazy promoter, enlists our  heroes, played by Harrelson and Banderas, to fight one another.  Together,  with Lolita Davidovich, they drive to Vegas.  Hi jinx ensue.
Harrelson's  character sees Jesus.  Jesus appears to him behind a cheap restaurant,  during fights...it could be funny, but it isn't.  They pick up a  hitchhiker, ultra-yummy Lucy Liu, just long enough to kill some movie time  that apparently they couldn't think of another, clever way to fill--time  passed by Woody having sex with her behind a gas station. It's a little  funny, but not much.
I guess what dissatisfies me about this movie is  that the sum isn't greater than its parts.  One thing happens after  another, without adding up to anything in particular.  There is not even a  sense of denouement at the end, because we know with a fair certainty how  the Big Fight will end. Nuthin' builds towards nuthin'.
Lolita  Davidovich's character digs muscle cars and convertibles with a zeal that  is inconsistent with the way she comports herself--she isn't loud, or  brassy, or cheap.  Shelton directs her as though she's playing an ad  exectutive, not a peddler of cheap, gimmicky sportswear.  Generally,  though, actors do well with weak material.
It's worth renting on video,  I suppose, but forget to bring it back on time...it isn't really worth late  fees.",961286400,3,2003,4.984802431610942

7896912,5,6305874948,All time great movie. I cant believe the bad reviews. The characters are refreshingly realistic and Woody and Banderas act it out superbly. Lolita gives a good touch to the movie as well. The fight scene is the best boxing scene ever done and the end of the fight is heartfelt. Been one of my favorites for years now. The bad reviews are unwarranted or made by people who like movies like Titantic or Underworld.,1480550400,,412,4.506666666666667

Late 90s homophobia aside, this movie is fantastic. It really highlights the famous wit of woody harrelson, and the ability of Antonio banderas to deliver a lengthy monologue.

All of this plus Lucy liu!!",1466035200,,337,4.694915254237288
7896915,5,6305874948,It's a hidden gem in my opinion Woody Harrelson movies have always delivered for me I can't think of a single bad movie he has ever been in . So it's a boxing movie has Antonio Banderas in it kind of think of it as White Men Can't Junp with Woody and Wesley Snipes except it's about boxing with Banderas it's worth the price a good watch,1462060800,,337,4.044776119402985
