6436823,2,B00KOBUO42,"I was really excited to see this film after seeing the previews, and the fact that I am a big fan of horror movies. After watching this movie half way through, I honestly wondered if anything was actually going to happen. There are a few minor jumps here and there up until the last 15 minutes, but nothing worthy of a great horror film. I was actually quite bored for most of this film, and I don't mind slower horror films. If you are curious, I would definitely rent it before considering to buy this film.",1407283200,,509,4.3125
6436824,3,B00KOBUO42,"This is a sleeper horror movie that's light on gore and CGI and heavy on atmosphere, and despite an average script features some convincing acting especially from Olivia Cooke, without whom the whole thing probably wouldn't work. The phrase ""Based on real events"" has never been stretched further since almost every character and event in the film is completely fictitious, yet as a work of total fiction does successfully set up a paranormal mystery that keeps the audience engaged and interested all the way to the dubious climax. While this isn't going to win any Oscars or make any ""Best of 2014"" movie lists, it's refreshing to see a well acted horror with minimal ambitions that executes reasonably well. Reality does occasionally come knocking on the door of disbelief but for the few scares it has, I was pleasantly surprised.",1405987200,17,834,4.964285714285714
6436825,4,B00KOBUO42,"Again, Critics be damned! This is a great thinking-persons horror film in which the story is executed so intricately that by the end, it will have even the most rational rattled and giving their own interpretation! The scares are harmless at first but then intensify to an, almost, unbearable finale! This film has great performances and is a spooky good time into the unknown! Does it bring anything new to the table? Not really but what is delivered is done so with ease, precision and intelligence. A horror film doesn't need to break new ground to be a good horror film, which is probably why some are claiming it's disappointing. We are so lucky to have Hammer back on the scene! Lets hope we get more great stuff from the brand that started it all!",1402963200,70,754,4.592592592592593
6436826,1,B00KOBUO42,"Of all the unscary, generic, half brained horror movies Ive seen over the years this one has to be one of the worst. I don't even think they were trying to be scary with this one. Some exec somewhere wanted to make a scary movie but had no idea how to do it, so instead of, you know, thinking they decided to recycle every. Single. Horror movie trope in existence. Scary monotone girl? Check. Knocking on doors? Check. Grainy home shot footage? Check. Horny college students? Check. Horny college student who falls in love with the demon possessed girl? Wait, what?

The story follows a college professor who believes what we perceive as the supernatural or demon possession is really just a manifestation of certain peoples psychic energy, kind of like Carrie or Looper, and his attempts to cure a young woman of her negative energy? I guess, but that part never made sense. Anyway he and a team of three young college students take the crazy girl, Jane, to a remote creepy house in the middle of nowhere, where the phones don't work and someone forgot to pay the electric bill, so they can cure her. And by cure her I mean put her psychic energy in a doll. :slaps face:

Now this isn't a bad idea. Carrie did something very similar to great effect, and though the science VS the supernatural theme isn't exactly new done correctly it can leave an audience to ponder the film long after its over, as well as be incredibly scary. Earlier this year Oculus did something similar. Difference is that Oculus was smart and scary, while The Silent Once is long and boring.

Heres how a scary scene goes in The Silent Ones; everyone sits around a table holding hands with a bright spinning light in front of them, scary mono tone girl screams, camera shakes, door knocks, everyone freaks out. Just picture every demon possession trope in the world and you have this movie in a nutshell. If youve never seen a horror movie you might be scared, but probably not. Throw in a dose of really bad CGI, wooden acting, and one of the lamest plot twists and theres very little to like here. It even goes on waaaaaay tooooooo loooooooooooong. Half way through I was already checking my phone waiting for it to be over. Not a good sign.

If you really, really, REALLY want to see a horror movie either see Oculus or stay home and watch something on Netflix instead. The Silent Ones is a horrible waste of both time and money that you won't even remember seeing in a day or two.",1402704000,3,2459,4.506726457399103
6436827,4,B00KOBUO42,"Very entertaining, but it's not making any ""top"" lists this year.  This film was good-but-mismanaged and found greatness out of reach due to weak story synthesis and character development. However, this movie is rich with charm, jumps and excellent production value.  So watch it with a date instead of with a horror snob.

Loosely based on a true experiment that took place in Oxford in 1974, this film delves deep into the notion that what we commonly consider ""the supernatural"" actually represents telekinetic and ""teleplasmic"" manifestations of the minds of disturbed believers.  Led by Professor Coupland (Jared Harris; Poltergeist), graduate students Krissy (Erin Richards) and Harry (Rory Fleck-Byrne; Vampire Academy) and videographer Brian (Sam Claflin; Snow White and the Huntsman, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire) band together to investigate the psychic phenomena produced by the suicidal young Jane (Olivia Cooke; Bates Motel) with hopes of ""curing"" her.

From Act One to the next weird things happen, Coupland's methods are called into question as Jane's health is placed at increasing risk, and Coupland shifts from methodical to manic in his obsession to cure her.  Both Coupland and Brian share a competitive interest (almost a sexual fixation) in saving her, but go about doing so by conflicting means.  Jared Harris' psychological descent is impressive and committed whereas Sam Claflin embraces his character's own brand of emotional fragility.
This film was filled with entertaining moments including shocking effects, gripping jump scares and some long scenes tensed up with a solid creep factor.  I'd add that the acting was very good; great, in fact, for a horror film.  Olivia Cooke managed to capture crazy, disturbed, scary, dangerous and sympathetic all at once.  The style of the film goes from something like a ""house"" movie, to a demonic possession movie, and then to something altogether different which I don't want to spoil (not that it's anything super special).  However, as the story shifted gears from skeptical science and rational explanations to ""what have we gotten ourselves into?"" I found myself generally uninvested in the characters and the outcome.  Don't get me wrong, the movie is not without its charm, I enjoyed it and was entertained, and I really ""liked"" the characters.  The thing is, their ""development"" didn't lead me anywhere interesting.  And whereas the facets of the story (and the scenes behind them) were independently interesting, they failed to find any of that effective and satisfying synthesis that makes us care if the protagonists succeed.

Director John Pogue (The Skulls, Quarantine II) may not have wowed us with this film's story synthesis.  But, given his r&eacute;sum&eacute;, this represents a good step forward in his professional development and I must admit that it was very entertaining.  However, the premise itself is more interesting than its execution.  It won't please gore hounds or story snobs who pine only for unique horror fare--and who, might I add, are almost never 100% happy with what they're served--but it will please the popcorn ""movie night"" guys who just want to see good effects, enjoy acting that doesn't hurt their soul, and laugh at well-placed jump scares.  It would probably be a good scary movie on date night as well.  Had it only balanced its writing with its quality scares, acting, ideas and filming with a better screenplay, this would have been quite good instead of good-but-mismanaged.

To the less-initiated and perhaps younger horror fan, this PG-13 film may serve as a great introduction to horror.  Those who aren't overly critical or ""so tired"" of loud-noise induced jump scares should get a real kick out of this.  What it lacks in character development and cohesiveness it more than makes up for with jumpy scares, neat effects, minimal gore, great acting, solid production value and a cool premise.",1401494400,45,3921,5.228434504792332
6436828,2,B00KOBUO42,"Oxford Professor Joseph Coupland (Jared Harris) leads a pair of student researchers plus a camera man, known as the ""quiet ones"" to discover and cure the insanity of Jane Harper (Olivia Cooke) through experimental means. Dr. Coupland believes Jane has ""negative energy"" that manifests itself into telekinetics which can be controlled to cure the patient. Belief in the supernatural is not tolerated.

During the process, Brian (Sam Claflin) the camera man develops mutual feelings for Jane who has an imaginary demon named Evie. The time frame for this film is 1974 and it makes use of Slade's ""Come On Feel the Noise."" Early in the movie, the funding for the experiment gets cut so Brian volunteers to use cheaper lower quality film, just what I wanted to hear. Part of the movie is amateur hand held genre while some of it is not.

The film scare factor doesn't pick up until about an hour into it. It then has some bad minor clue twists which didn't help the film's cause.

Might work as a cheap rental. Not overpowering.

6436834,4,B00KOBUO42,"Given all of the negative reviews this movie got, I'm surprised I enjoyed it as much as I did. I consider myself a pretty dedicated horror fan, and I thought this was pretty good. Not necessarily scary, but a decent level of creepy for sure. The acting is good, and though it could have benefited from being a bit longer, I felt the script was well-written. I thought the atmosphere and setting were great. The one major complaint I have with this film is the shaky cam/found footage stuff. I am not a fan of this type of camera work, and find it usually comes across as lazy film making which rarely gives the movie a more realistic feel. But since this ""footage"" stuff is combined with traditional camera work, it feels a bit more authentic, and so I can give that a pass. Other than that, I thought the movie was worth watching and I will probably watch it again someday. It is PG-13, so if you are a fan of gore, you will be disappointed. The characters do make some questionable and sometimes downright stupid judgment calls, but if not for those types of poor decision making skills, a big part of this genre would be absent, right? One bonus for me: Sam Claflin is a talented actor who also happens to be beautiful. He is a master of what I like to call the ""sad, lost, dumpster puppy"" look, and God bless him for it. Keep up the good work, Sam...",1474848000,,1354,4.334645669291339
6436835,5,B00KOBUO42,"The Quiet Ones is one of the better possession horror films out there, and in fact this movie might start off average and bland but it gradually gets significantly more intense when the actual experimenting on the possessed teenage girl is underway.

It's about a university professor (Jared Harris) who takes three college students (Erin Richards, Sam Claflin and Rory Fleck-Byrne) to a countryside house to study the unusual events occurring with Olivia Cooke who reminds me of Wednesday from the Addams Family based on her quiet and freaky appearance!

Olivia's locked away for a reason- she might seem like a normal girl who's being mistreated and unfairly kept away from the world, but there's a reason she's locked inside this room.  She possesses supernatural abilities such as being able to set a doll on fire by touching it, can toss people across the room preventing them from entering her room, withstanding fire is possible to an extent, she can make bath water steam to outrageously hot temperatures, and perhaps the most interesting one- the voodoo doll given to the girl early on means whenever the students stab the doll, Olivia's character is able to feel the pain which is why we sometimes see her on the floor covered in blood.  There's also more blood-soaked situations!

What makes this movie so great are the special effects and the atmosphere.  To actually see Olivia's character grab a doll and make it steam is quite the unique sight.  On another occasion Olivia leans her head back and we see something horrific and unexplainable come out of her mouth.  By the way the film is supposed to take place in 1974 which explains why the crew is using old recording equipment and why we hear Slade's version of ""Come On Feel the Noise"".  That was a popular song and band back in the day as my parents will tell you!

Anyway Erin's character is somewhat impatient and bossy, and she even tries hitting on the professor (more like they both try hitting on each other- behind the shady tree outside touchy stuff is going on!)  She's supposed to be Rory's girlfriend... I think.  After a while it's clear the professor is more obsessed finding out the disturbing events behind Olivia's character than his students are (even though the students are quite dedicated themselves) and he eventually digs too deep when it becomes apparent Olivia's being possessed by someone else (an evil doll named Evey).

For the longest time we don't see Evey so we're led to think Evey is part of Olivia's imagination... that is until we eventually see a REALLY creepy shadow of a baby lying in a bed when Olivia pulls back the blanket.  We see something lying there breathing with demonic sounds to make it scarier.  Really creepy moment!  Even scarier when Olivia goes to pick it up and it sets her on fire!  It almost looked like an imprint of a shadow.  Really awesome design.

The actual explanation behind Evey is that the professor wants Olivia to put all her negative energy into the doll so he can destroy it, but Evey is just too powerful and demonic to allow this to happen!  The professor thinks Evey is just a mental disorder inside Olivia's mind but... well, everyone soon finds out that's not the case.  Evey is a real supernatural force and you don't want to mess with it!  We also see old video flashbacks of a little boy who's possessed in the same kind of way, and this video is shown for the purpose of showing that Olivia's character is going through the same kind of unexplainable possession.

The Quiet Ones is filled with all kinds of quality moments though, and that's why it's awesome.  Eventually the professor's obsession results in conflicts with his students, because he thinks his students are standing in the way of his amazing analytical work.  You can expect more storyline behind Evey and the possessed girl as the film gets closer to the end.  Overall this is highly recommended.  While Sam's character is probably the star of the movie, all the other characters work really well too.  Then again the professor and Olivia get just as much time so who knows who the main star is.  The way the Quiet Ones gradually gets scarier and scarier is the reason I think so highly of it.  For exorcism lovers, this film should be right up your alley.  It has atmosphere, scariness, and pretty solid storytelling.

On a sidenote it's a little creepy at times the way Olivia hits on Sam's character by either taking her clothes off or pushing him against a wall.  She's presented to look WAY younger than her real age at the time of this movie's recording (20) and it just feels weird.  Then again most possessed films do the same thing- remember the original Exorcist?  Not a very nice little girl on that film huh!  This movie doesn't have the crude sexual stuff that the Exorcise had (for the most part) and instead focuses on an interesting storytelling approach which is probably preferable really, because little girls shouldn't talk that way.

6436841,4,B00KOBUO42,"**** 4 Stars ****  Loved it!  This is exactly what I always want to find in a supernatural film, but rarely do.  The resurrected Hammer Films (finally brought back to life around 2010) has made a movie truly worthy of its '60s and '70s glory days.  Based on the true-life 'Philip experiment' from the early '70s (an attempt to prove poltergeists and similar phenomena are real, but derived from the subconscious of the observers), ""The Quiet Ones"" is a great Gothic story set in 1974 and is just a joy to watch.  Yes, there is more atmosphere than gore (actually,there is no gore) and the plot may move too slowly for the younger crowd, but for the right audience (who remembers classic Hammer films from back in the day), this one is a winner.

6436842,4,B00KOBUO42,"If you roll your eyes at the glut of guts and gore gross-outs that aren't really scary, this is a movie for you. It harks back to the psychological horror genre that was so prevalent in the 60's and 70's. It isn't a masterpiece like 1963's 'The Haunting', but it gets the goosebumps (and the anger) going via some well-acted, bleak scenes of experimentation gone wrong, insanity, and abuse, (I'll leave it to the viewer as to who is insane and who is abused.)

I watched it and was very pleased, then went back to find it was made in 2014! I hope this is a new thing, that more movies like this are made. It lacks in consistency and is somewhat badly edited, but as I said, the acting is good, and it's very properly creepy. It gets intense in some places, and genuinely scary in others. I would love to see movies like this get bigger-budget treatment, or at least get into the hands of Scandi noir, as they are making some of the best movies around these days.

6436891,5,B00KOBUO42,"Jane Harper (Olivia Cooke) is a very trobled young woman.  In and out of foster homes and mental asylums for the past twenty years, she's a possible victim of possession, and has an imaginary (or not) friend named Evey.  She's now come to the attention of - and agreed to work with -  Oxford professor Dr. Joseph Coupland (Jared Harris), a doctor who believes that the various phenomenon attributed to supernatural possession, such as objects moving on their own, are real but are the result of mental illness and other factors originating in the human brain.  With a small team of student assistants, he sets out on a project to prove his hypothesis, using Jane as his subject.

A recent recruit to the team, student camera operator Brian (Sam Claflin) is a primary point-of-view character, while Harry and Krissi (Rory Flecke-Byrne and Erin Richards) have been on the team a while.  Coupland uses some unorthodox methods, on occasion being apparently deliberately confrontational with Jane in hopes of provoking a reaction or telekinetic manifestation.  It's only as such manifestations begin occuring that the question is raised - what If Jane is really possessed or otherwise in contact with the supernatural?

The Quiet Ones takes place in 1974 and often looks and feels like a movie made in the 70s (in a good way).  It's not a found footage film per se but dips into those waters at times - for example, you might see a character setting up a camera, then go on for a bit with what the camera's catching before seamlessly flowing back into a more traditional kind of narrative.  Very well made and well acted (with Cooke and Harris in particular distinguishing themselves), the movie may be seen by some as being a bit too slow-moving, especially in the early stages.  I personally thought the pacing was good from the beginning, and successfully set up the more dramatic and quicker moving later stages.

The Quiet Ones is under-appreciated in terms of scare factor and suspensefulness, and handles itself very well in adding in some unexpected elements and turns.  It's among the more under-rated movies of recent years.",1445817600,,2129,4.896935933147632

Having read several other reviews that erroneously used the term 'Based on actual events' instead of the more apt 'Inspired by actual events' (something even the creators acknowledge). The events in this story never happened but the 'experimental treatment' used in the movie was tried in the 70's. So no, this movie was not based on true events, rather it was inspired by a psychological experiment from the 70's and the creators molded into their own vision.",1437868800,2,803,4.911764705882353

So I won't tell you how it ended, in case your constitution will allow for more monotony than mine would, but it seemed fairly pointless. But not pointless enough to be silly, which would have at least been something. I guess if you need a nap and there isn't any golf available to sleep through, then this may be the movie for you.

Even better, do I just fall in and not have to prove everything/anything?  This movie is the latter.  If there are plot holes, they weren't noticed.  Besides, actually, think about your own life.  How much of that makes sense on a purely logical scale?  It just comes down to the story, and whether the actors, director, and the rest tell it well enough.

I recommend this for those who like a story that plays out in a way most stories most people hear, read, or see, don't.  I think horror is based on there being no real winners, perhaps not even any good guys, and maybe no survivors.  Hmm... a lot like life, when the numbers are crunched.  I understand why it is a subset, for most.  As a general rule, I don't like UK English movies.  This was an exception.  Why only four starts?  That, at times, generally, is as good as I give...

6436951,2,B00KOBUO42,"Reportedly The Quiet Ones is inspired by the Philip Experiment that was really conducted in 1972, Toronto. But anyone expecting something intellectual from this background will be disappointed with this British horror, which misses every opportunity to make something interesting out of the unique premise.

Jared Harris plays Professor Joseph Coupland conducting an experiment to scientifically prove that poltergeists are actually caused by the human psyche. Along with a team of students the professor conducts a series of experiment on a young girl named Jane Harper (Olivia Cooke). The subject is believed to have generated some supernatural phenomenon. The experiments are recorded by a student Brian McNeil (Sam Claflin) holding a camera. In this way part of The Quiet Ones is so-called found-footage film.

Despite the interesting set-up and narrative gimmicks, however, The Quiet Ones fails to deliver because it tries too hard. It is not that the film is totally scare-free. The film suffers from the narrative that gets confusing when the story itself actually does not have much to offer. The subplot about Jane and Brian is underdeveloped, and so is the backstory of the professor and his subjects. And what is the point of employing the overused found-footage device?

Sadly, the acting abilities of the actors DON'T SELL the story, and they altogether try to thrill and entertain you.  The beginning and ending is the same but with deaths and more video recorded footage.  The ""Quiet Ones,"" I assume, are the ones being tormented and are possessed like the brunette female character.  This film is like ""Sinister,"" all of the ""Paranormal Activity"" movies and any film that makes you think ""this may be good because the movie has recorded footage,"" or ""this film may be good because it is entirely video footage-like"".  (I think this movie is more like ""Sinister."")  Nope, not this film.  All of the screams, and ""don't you touch her,"" was annoying and had me think, ""get to the point.""  This film, in my opinion, is a time-waster unless, of course, you don't mind repetitive and partly incomplete movie plots combined with good make-believe acting.  (The movie doesn't explain how the tormented girl is the same one from the reports (don't worry I didn't spoil the movie)).  This movie has an old formula in which you have the ""brain"" played by Jared Harris, the ""slut"" played by the blonde, the ""connector"" or the one who gets along with everybody, the ""subject"" played by the brunette, and the ""newcomer"" who gradually asserts himself and then the end.  The acting wasn't good enough to make me want to see the film anymore even while watching but I didn't want to give up on the film until I saw it entirely.  Of course, I will never get that time back, which is why I warn you.

The acting is top-notch, the story compelling, and the scares are, while slow-building, quite fun. The professor plays a driven (at all costs) leader of an experiment, not unlike 1999's The Haunting - and this one actually has some scares! If you really enjoy character-driven horror, then this one might be up your alley. I recommend this one without hesitation for any horror fan not looking for a hack-and-slash or torture porn film but rather one requiring some patience and intelligence in order to slowly absorb the mental anguish and evils expeirenced by the characters.",1418169600,2,749,5.0

6437009,3,B00KOBUO42,"Nine Things about the Movie The Quiet Ones (United Kingdom, 2014)

1. For a horror movie, The Quiet Ones is well-named.

2. Its set at Oxford University in 1974. A professor has custody of an insane young woman who thinks shes possessed. The professor hires three young assistants to help him with experiments to cure her.

3. The professor believes that the girl isn't really possessed, but does have telekinetic powers that she doesnt understand or know how to control. His experiments are basically psychological and physical torture techniques that will upset the girl enough to let out her demon so they can discover whats really going on.

4. As the movie progresses, and the girl cant get her demon to come out, the young assistants begin to suspect that maybe the whole thing is a hoax, or that the professor is obsessed with the girl.

5. The movie gets points for actually talking about real science and hypotheses, and how experiments can be contaminated. Its also cool to watch the 1970s setting and scientific technology.

6. The actual story is pretty interesting. But its not very scary; its more of a drama. So the director had to put in a few stupid jump scares just to make something happen.

7. The movie does a good job of building a creepy, moody drama where you aren't sure exactly what the deal is. After awhile, the possessed girl seems less threatening than the professor in charge of her.

8. Unfortunately, the movie doesnt know how to end - the solution just comes out of nowhere to tie things up in a sudden and shocking way. It basically makes the rest of the movie pointless. I don't really even understand what happened.

9. As a psychological drama, this is a pretty interesting, stylish story. But as a horror movie, its at first kind of boring and then rather ridiculous.",1416096000,,1806,4.6719242902208205

The characters were cliched...the tortured subject, the leader of the experiment whose only concern was the experiment and nothing else--the two sex-driven ""assistants,"" and the slightly naive photographer who's the most affected of them all and therefore the final victim.

I've seen more ""horror"" and possession movies than I can count, and this is the first one to actually make me care about how it ended, much less want to watch it again to catch all the subtleties lacking in so many other films in the genre. I actually hesitate to lump it in with the horror genre at all. It far exceeded my expectations and has been grossly under-rated. If you're looking for Paranormal Activity level hoaky then this movie is not for you. If you prefer well executed, intelligent suspense/thriller, then this is a must-watch. A great film can't be a ""thriller"" without a slow build to create the right level of tension and maintain it throughout the exposition. The thrill comes from that consistent tension that never truly releases the viewer, even to the end.
I'm not a fan of spoilers, so I won't go into the specifics. Just watch for yourself. Just watch with the expectation of realism rather than ""cheese.""",1411776000,5,953,4.712574850299402

6437049,2,B00KOBUO42,"Quiet can have a couple of different meaningsit can pertain to the volume of noise or rather the lack of noise.  Quiet can also mean that things are slow and uneventful.  The Quiet Ones definitely falls into the latter meaning.  This laboriously slow film produced by the legendary Hammer Studios never managers to get out of the starting block.

Set at Oxford in the early 1970s, Jared Harris portrays a professor running an experiment to disprove claims of the supernatural.  With his assistants Krissi and Harry and cameraman Brian, Professor Couplands subject is a young woman named Jane who has been abandoned.  Coupland hopes to cure the woman by releasing her negative energy.

When funding for their experiment is cutoff the group retreats a house in the country to continue their work.  Janes negative energy takes the personification of an apparition named Evey who becomes increasingly more violent.  Couplands methods anger Brian who thinks that Jane is being mistreated.  He plots to try to get her out of the house while Coupland becomes more tyrannical.  The film soon descends into a confused morass of nonsense about devil worship which seems to have been tossed in at the last minute when Director John Pogue had nowhere else to go with the story.

Hammer Films has long been known for producing films that are heavy on atmosphere.  Even some of the Christopher Lee Dracula films that were not every good at least had a strong dose of gothic overtones.  But this isn't the early 1970s anymore.  Film audiences demand more today and the Quiet Ones fails to deliver.",1411776000,,1582,4.894736842105263

When you get to skull and bones, this is the plot: a crank University professor (Jared Harris) who is cocksure of himself gathers a bunch of impressionable students, mostly young women he is sleeping with, to do an ""abnormal psychology"" experiment with an individual who is like the Professor's psychology pet: a pale, suicidal girl who has been this way since she was about 12 and is played very well by Olivia Cooke.

Obviously based in part on the circumstances surrounding the Anneliese Michel case, we see her mistreated and mishandled in just about every way possible by these kids and by the pervert Professor.

6437088,4,B00KOBUO42,"Well done, old boy.  This movie is a slowly-developing investigation into a possession that turns ever more twisted and frightening.  The premise is interesting: save the girl from a ""demon"" constructed by her own mind and harness that psychic power . . . somehow.  It's not really explained HOW the good professor thinks he is going to get at this psychic energy.  But that's ok, because the first step in this ambitious project is separating the girl from her imaginary friend.  Who turns out to be a hell of a lot more real than psychic.

Set in the 1970's, before cell phones and the internet, and all kinds of tech that might save you from demons, the film captures the essence of life back then.  Makes the tale more terrifying too.

The five characters are unique, at odds with one another often enough, and yet devoted to helping the mentally disturbed and power-manifesting (possessed) girl.  They play off each other well and create tension.

But there are secrets within this group.  There are secrets within the possessed girl.  And sometimes little girls don't want to give up their demons.  Uh oh.  Things get revealed.  Things get naughty, terrifying, and quite interesting.  Yes, there are slow reveals.  If you stick with the movie, it is quite disturbing.

Performances are perfect.  Especially Jared Harris' role.  The camera work is great--not annoying or nauseating like Blair Witch.  It's a movie that sometimes uses hand-held perspectives.

The title is stupid.  It has nothing to do with the plot.  The plot itself is great, but it has NOTHING to do with the actual real-life events it is ""based"" on.  The actual project was about creating a ghost from psychic energy and interacting with it.  The only connection this film has with THAT is the professor's belief that the possessed girl's demon is a created phenomenon.

So, WATCH IT.  It will have easily-scared folks pooping their pants unexpectedly, and horror buffs will appreciate its different take on handling a possession.",1409788800,,2005,4.922155688622754

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

I love scary movies.  But this was not scary.  So some girl, Jane, who kinda looks like Samara from The Ring, is kept at a kinda creepy looking house with our usual premise for these movies.  We have a doctor with an unorthodox idea of how to cure her of her mental problems, but he doesn't realize that she is really possessed, is the devil, is the 13th born of the 13th born, whatever.

So right away I have to ask, why was this doctor allowed to take her from the university/hospital she was being treated at when his funding is cut?  Sure I understand he may have legal guardianship of her but no one said, ""Hey, where are you going with her?""  No one questioned this at all?

So they try some unusual ways to try and ""cure her"" of her illness but of course it doesn't work and we all know it's not going to work and that eventually the scary stuff is going to start.  Plus we all know that they're all going to die at the end when whatever is inside her breaks free and demolishes everything in it's path.

***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***

The scares in this movie are just lame and they are pretty much all just jump scares, and I hate those.  I really, REALLY hate jump scares!  Anyone can jump out of a closet and yell ""BOO!"" and get you to jump.  But you're not scared by that, you're just startled.  This movie just couldn't build the sense of horror, fear and awaken the terror that it was trying to.  When you are so scared of a movie that the very next scene has you begging in your mind to the characters, ""Please don't go in that room!"" and you're on the edge of your seat in anticipation of what may happen if they do go into that room... THAT is a horror movie!

Not to mention I was able to call out every single jump scare before it happened.  And when I can call the scares before they even happen, that's when you've failed as a film maker.

One last question and then I'll wrap this up.  Why was this movie called, ""The Quiet Ones,"" in the first place?  Jane talked through the whole movie.  Every scene she's in she's talking and interacting with the other characters.  Now I can understand if she didn't talk throughout the whole movie and had maybe one line at the very end like Silent Bob did in Clerks, THEN I could understand giving it that title.  But they might as well call it, ""The Chatty Ones.""

All in all the movie is not scary.  It's boring, its predictable and it failed to keep my interest at all.  If you like scary movies and really wanna see it, rent it, do not buy it.",1409356800,,2791,4.243346007604563
6437108,1,B00KOBUO42,"If you check out the reviews I write then you already know that I am a die hard horror fan. I love everything from the big budget horror flicks to the low budget garbage that is brought forth from major and minor studios. So when I saw the trailer for this film I was immediately interested in seeing it. Suffice to say this is one of those movies where they take the best moments and put them together to form a trailer that entices you and then delivers nothing that you expected.

Taking place at Oxford in 1974 we are presented with Professor Jared Coupland (Jared Harris) who is in the midst of the study of a young woman who may indeed be possessed. Then again perhaps it has nothing to do with possession and everything to do with mental illness. In any event he hires a young student to film the proceedings involving him and two other students. Shortly after the film begins Coupland is angered when the university refuses to acknowledge of fund his research. The team hits the road and takes up residence in a house in the country. There Jane Harper is secluded in a locked room where they attend to her needs and conduct sessions with her.

At one point while trying to help her they hold a sance which of course angers what ever being it is that has control of her. Again is it some creature, some demon, or is it simply the demon of her own mind and a fertile imagination. As the film progresses there are clues dropped by Jane that lead them to finding information that would have you believe it is the former rather than the latter. But all bets are off as we witness not only the problems that Jane has but the slow degradation of team investigating her.

This movie had great potential to become another solid movie in the possession sub-genre but it loses sight of the things that would work early on and clings to those that do not. The characters are less than believable in many parts of the story and their actions make you wonder just what criteria a professor who was actually attempting to discover a cure for this girl used in order to get them to help. From the looks of things if a student had a warm body, they were hired.

I completely understand the use of the slow burn when it comes to horror films. Some of the greatest moments have come with the gradual development of characters and scenes that held you in a trance like state only to finally pay off your patience with a grand scene at the end. This film holds you in mild suspense only to offer little in the way of payoff later on. Even the ending feels like a let down after all that has been seen earlier.

Supposedly based on a true story the movie uses the current favorite technique in horror films, the first person found footage film. I think they need to come up with a new name for this rather than ""found footage"". That carries a negative connotation to it having been overused in the past decade. Maybe they should have a specialized logo that reads ""SELFIE-VISION"" instead. For me I'm tired of movies filmed with jumping cameras, off camera action and surprise shots that no sane person would be standing there taking rather than running for dear life. Move on people. Find something different.

In the end this movie may not be the worst horror film ever made but it certainly struggles to try and get there. Some may enjoy the film and the pacing that it uses. For me I had a struggle of my own trying to stay awake while watching it. The good news is that the ending doesn't leave room for a sequel. Then again the way supernatural serial killers always seem to pop back up after having been trashed, smashed, pummeled, pounded, stabbed, slabbed, kebobed, keel hauled, run over and shot means that film producers could find a way to continue this story. The only saving grace was that it didn't do that well at the box office. I hope they realize there's a reason for that.",1409356800,3,3877,4.415384615384616

The third member of the group....a horny nurse of sorts who is not only having sex with the ""engineer"" but the professor is getting sloppy seconds from her as well. The only positive thing I can say about her is that her early 70's wardrobe is great.  Your fourth illustrious member .....a young camera man...who joined this gig as a paying job....ends up not getting paid at all but stays anyway because he starts to have feelings for the mental patient. Of course, your 5th member is the  young mental patient herself. With cheesy...already done to death...horror scenes....I continued to wait for the movie to get better. The professor is convinced that the young mental patient is manifesting all of this negative energy herself and if he can isolate it.....say into a doll.....he can heal his patient....heal all mental patients like her....and make millions of dollars. The camera man..in his spare times goes to the town library and does some detective work. It turns out....The young mental patient was the child of parents who belonged to some weird cult. Her parents believed she could bring back....some Dark deity....that was worshipped 5,000 years before Christianity was born. The cult folks all end up dying in a horrific fire (Unexplained fire of sorts) and the little girl survives. She grows up in foster care homes....where everyone is afraid that she is possessed (because she can move things with her mind)....so she ends up in an asylum where the Oxford Professor finds her. As the movie progresses....miss mental patient....isn't so mental.... she is possessed....You don't really get to see the demonic entity very much but it goes on a rampage (geez, what a surprise) and kills everyone in the group except the camera man.  Who ends up in a mental hospital himself....where nobody believes his story of miss mental patient being possessed...and they accuse him of killing the other 4. Nobody believes a demonic entity killed all the other people including miss mental patient.

""The Quiet Ones"" won't knock your socks off but it is slightly better than average due to the performances and atmospheric direction.

SPOILERS:

Set in the 1974 and inspired by a true experiment, ""The Quiet Ones"" stars Jard Harris as Professor Joseph Coupland who is performing an experiment to help ""drive out"" a demon which Coupland believes is a part of Jane Harper's (Olivia Cooke) trauma growing up. Coupeland's approach includes summoning the negative energy which Jane has called Evy and put it into a doll allowing Jane to be free of it. In every foster home Jane has lived in this ""negative energy"" has manifest itself causing destruction. Coupland's team includes Krissi (Erin Richards),  Harry (Rory Fleck-Bryne) and a new member to document the experiment Brian (Sam Calflin). Unfortunately Coupland has miscalculated and the entire situation increasingly slips out of his control after the group loses its university funding and must move off campus.

Produced by Hammer Films ""The Quiet Ones"" has sat on the shelf for two years (it finished shooting in 2012) and its pretty easy to see why; despite some atmospheric direction by John Pogue the film doesn't have much in the way of truly scary moments focusing on cheap scares i.e., things falling, people suddenly popping into frame, etc. That's a pity because there is some potential in the material as presented here and Harris (always a marvelous and compelling presence on screen) along with Olivia Cooke (a stand out in ""Bates Motel"") are riveting in their performances. Still, the film does deliver a compelling story even if it isn't always told in a compelling fashion.

The blu-ray presentation is very nice. Alternating ""found"" footage shot on film with regularly shot footage, ""The Quiet Ones"" has nice detail even during his darker sequences. Colors don't really pop but they are not meant to as the film mostly consists of drab backgrounds. Skin tones are nice throughout. The gritty look is intentional particularly during the ""found"" footage sequences and only adds to the sense of reality much more so than most found footage films that are shot in digital.

The audio is exceptionally well handled with a nice, active 5.1 lossless mix in both English and Spanish with subtitles for both.

Extras include a commentary track by director John Pogue and producer Tobin Armbrust that provides a fair amount of technical detail on the film.

""Welcome To The Experiment"" is a half hour behind-the-scenes doc that includes interviews with cast and crew on the film. We also get a featurette on the opening sequence of the film which, evidently, the director was originally against but welcomed once he saw how it set up the mood of the film.

Finally we get deleted scenes and outtakes that proved it was wise to cut the former. No theatrical trailer is included although we do get coming attractions trailers for other Lion's Gate productions.

Although ""The Quiet Ones"" doesn't deliver on its interesting premise the film is largely salvaged by some atmospheric direction and two outstanding, creepy performances by Harris and Cooke. I wouldn't recommend ""The Quiet Ones"" as a purchase but it's not bad as a rental on a plane ride or to kill and hour and a half if you have nothing better to do.",1408924800,,3598,4.940397350993377

How else would you have it end anyway....Its not a block buster, but its certainly not slow, unless you have the attention span of a bird.

It just falls short, there's a few plot tweaks that could have made it far better because it's a very interesting plot basis and conclusion.

There are good scares/suspense moments created and as the movie peogresses you are drawn in and try to come up with your own conclusions before the movie tells you what's going on, but in the end it does seem a little anti-climatic. There's nothing that a few more lines of dialog added or replaced and a slightly adjusted scene wouldn't fix to make it a truly great movie.

6437149,3,B00KOBUO42,"I was looking forward to the release of THE QUIET ONES for a couple of reasons. 1) I'm a big fan of Jared Harris (and wish he could have replaced his father Richard as Dumbledore in the HARRY POTTER series) and 2) I've been following the movies of the revived Hammer Films with keen interest (this is #5 after WAKE WOOD, THE RESIDENT, LET ME IN, and THE WOMAN IN BLACK). It also ranks fifth when compared with the others. I originally saw THE QUIET ONES in a theater and had trouble following it. Now with the DVD out, I used the subtitles to catch all the background dialogue and got much more out of it but I shouldn't have to do that. The movie bears a strong resemblance to an early 1970s Hammer horror film called DEMONS OF THE MIND only it isn't set in the 19th century. Like that film, despite some very effective moments, it's ultimately a failure.

Although inspired by true events, the story and its characters are completely fictitious. Set in 1972, an Oxford University professor (Harris) and 3 students conduct unorthodox experiments on a mentally unstable young woman in an effort to get her to materialize her ""inner demon"". They then hope to study it and then scientifically get rid of it. As is always the case in these matters, things do not go as planned and it ends badly. A significant revelation late in the film comes from the 1960 cult favorite PEEPING TOM. Most of the movie is designed to resemble amateur documentation (not found footage). It works great until the end when it should have been abandoned. On the DVD commentary the filmmakers explain why they chose to continue it but I don't agree. In the final analysis there are things I liked about THE QUIET ONES but I didn't enjoy it.",1408579200,3,1716,4.517684887459807

6437152,2,B00KOBUO42,"Meh.  The characters are weak, making it rather difficult to sympathize with them.  The entire time I found the movie annoyingly noisy for no reason.  Somewhat of a hypnotic yet tense trip into boredom.",1408492800,,202,4.882352941176471
6437153,4,B00KOBUO42,"The Quiet Ones lives up to its name, with a plot that meanders seemingly aimlessly until you realize that it was building up to not one, but two big reveals all the while. Low key incidents and seemingly trivial details that seem irrelevant become relevant in the final act. As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a very convincing period piece set in the 1970's. The soundtrack is all period-appropriate, with one Slade song used in a particularly memorable way. The fashions, hairdos and makeup all fit. Even the film stock has that distinctive grain, as it should since our hero (Sam Claflin) is the cameraman. The story, like The Apparition (2012), is inspired by the Philip experiment, in which a group of students in Toronto tried to create a poltergeist in support of their thesis that paranormal activity is caused by energy created by living humans. This retelling moves the scene to Oxford University and the motivation of the professor (Jared Harris) is to psychically manifest the entity experienced by a schizophrenic girl (Olivia Cooke) outside of her body in order to then banish it. Or so he says. There's actually more to it than that, but I won't spoil it. Professor Joseph Coupland has two loyal assistants in vixenish Christina (Erin Richards) and Chivalrous Pervert type Harry (Rory Fleck-Byrne) but his cameraman has flounced off the experiment citing an ethical conflict, so he recruits young Brian (Claflin) from a less prestigious school to take over the suddenly vacated role. Then he loses his funding and has to move the experiment off campus, to a dilapidated house in the country. Minor spoiler: this is one of those things that seems random, but isn't. Then things really start getting creepy. The movie is actually at its most effective when it's creeping along on pure mood, or when it's revealing something important to the plot. It suffers a bit when the CGI effects begin. Another problem is that while it's wonderfully acted, the characters  as written are hard to latch onto until well into the film's runtime, which is awfully late for them to fully develop. It's still well worth a look if you like this genre.",1408492800,2,2154,4.885245901639344
6437154,2,B00KOBUO42,"This film is understated and oh, so very British.  (Just prepping you for the accents.)  Also, it is set in the 60's or 70's (I was doing chores on and off while watching this.)  There is a lot of shaky cam and the plot itself seemed shaky in it's own right.  Not terribly engaging.  The sound is either at 1 or 11.  All and all, I would say that you should wait for this one to hit Prime or Netflix.",1408406400,,400,3.9375
6437155,3,B00KOBUO42,"This film has such a great premise but it never quite lives up to it.  It takes place in the 70's and that part of it is well done.  There is one anachronism with a song but you will likely miss it.  They also use EMF detectors which didn't really come into regular use until later.  Even so, it doesn't get in the way.  Costume, make up, etc are spot on.  The performances are strong and the story easy to follow.

There are very few ""scares"" in this.  The film relies on it's creepiness to keep the viewer interested.  The cruelty shown to the subject of study fits in with the era.

But it needed a little more movement.  A little more action.  For me there was too much standing around bantering and exposition.  The genre has upped it's game making this film seem lazy.

The ending will disappoint you.  The very last moment is cool, but there were better ways to bring this story to conclusion.",1408406400,2,900,4.3053892215568865
6437156,1,B00KOBUO42,"The Quiet Ones is a dud.  A dispiriting truth since it is a rare release by Hammer, the once-legendary, then-defunct, now-revived British production company who defined the genre in the nation in the 1950s, '60s, and '70s.  This new film includes halfhearted nods toward the best and brightest of Hammer, including a Gothic rural estate where much of the action unfolds, but its various elements and tensions never adhere into a satisfying whole, and it is at times downright daft and dull.  Jared Harris and his cigarettes star as an Oxford academic who is trying to prove unwell people can manifest phenomena.  He rolls his eyes at the notion of magic, but is certain people can start fires and move furniture with their minds as long as they are, I don't know, super insane.  In this film's world, however, he is positioned as the staunch defender of the rational awaiting an education by demon fire.  With two students and a local cameraman, he retires to the aforementioned estate to research and treat (read:  torture) one Jane Harper, a troubled woman with a long history of foster families and purported supernatural abilities.

There is an interesting story buried in this film:  one of a perfectly volatile pairing of a self-righteous, unyielding doctor and a desperate patient who at once justify and harm one another, caught in a dance of death disguised as unconventional treatment.  Harris is a capable actor who plays convincing notes of tenured pomposity, and relative fresh face Olivia Cooke has an engaging and otherworldly quality as the put-upon Jane, creating a character who is both menacing and melancholy.  Alas, the potent qualities they generate are adrift in an uneven bump-in-the-night film which relies far, far too much on standard-issue ""boo"" jolts and slams harshly into a wall of pitiful nonsense in its ear-punishing, I.Q.-lowering third act.",1408320000,9,1876,5.058441558441558
6437157,4,B00KOBUO42,"When I first saw the trailer for THE QUIET ONES, I didn't get very excited; it reminded me of THE CONJURING for some reason, and therefore my expectations were immediately low.  Upon watching this film, however, I discovered I was very wrong.  Although it is set in the past, it doesnt match the other film much at all.  And while THE QUIET ONES is not a perfect film, it is scary and fun, and definitely worth watching.

This is one of those films that must be experienced in surround sound to truly be appreciated.  I cant tell you how many times I jumped because of noises behind me or a whisper that comes in from the side.  I LOVE films like this, and I wish every movie could contain this sort of aspect.

THE QUIET ONES is shot well and looks great overall.  It is set in 1974, and the production team does a stellar job of recreating the look and feel of that time period.  The cinematography is tight, and there a few obscure camera angles that really help bring a feeling of menace to the film.

The acting is great as well.  The cast does a great job with their roles, particularly Olivia Cooke who portrays the troubled Jane Harper.  Cooke gives a fantastic performance that is both believable and enjoyable.  I look forward to future roles from her.

The story in THE QUIET ONES is where things drop a bit.  For as riveting as the drama is, the story itself heads in a couple of quirky directions.  There are two side-plots that didn't make much sense to me, however maybe I simply misunderstood them.  I am not going to go into detail here, as I don't want to give anything away.

But regardless, THE QUIET ONES is a heck of a film and has plenty of scares for all of you fright-fans.  And for being PG-13, it is a nice horror flick that younger viewers can enjoy.  I recommend this one and suggest you look for it tomorrow when it hits store shelves.",1408320000,4,1865,4.335260115606936

6437160,4,B00KOBUO42,"If theres one thing that can be said about The Quiet Ones, its that the movie is definitely an extension of Hammers classic films of the 1960s. Not content to just throw out some monster scares, they delve into the Satanic cult themes of classics like The Devil Rides Out, To the Devil a Daughter, and The Satanic Rites of Dracula. Although not perfect by any means and a bit confusing in plot if you're not paying close enough attention, the famous production company delivers a creepy new entry to add to their rich cinematic history.

Much like Hammers early works, The Quiet Ones is a gothic period piece. However, instead of it taking place in the eerie 1800s or early 1900s, it takes place in the 1970s in a secluded and mysterious mansion. A University professor (Jared Harris) leads a group of students in an experiment to help an emotionally disturbed young woman. Jane Harper (Olivia Cooke) believes she is followed by a sinister spirit who manifests itself through violent outbursts. Is something supernatural occurring or is Jane somehow willing herself to harm others and wreak havoc wherever she goes?

The Quiet Ones is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and terror, sexual content, thematic material, language, and smoking throughout. There are also a couple scenes of brief nudity of the male and female persuasion. The brief nudity was so quick it could have been completely cut out in editing.

It might not be the greatest example of a modern Hammer horror film, but The Quiet Ones does successfully carry the torch passed on by so many great genre classics of the past many grew up watching. It has all the ingredients youd expect from the English House of Horror, though they might not follow the recipe as closely as youd hope. Chillingly convincing performances from Olivia Cooke and Jared Harris more than make up for any narrative muddiness viewers might find themselves wading through.",1408060800,24,1923,4.874617737003058
