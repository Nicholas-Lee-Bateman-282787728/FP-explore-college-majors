A real treasure to own.",1149379200,,185,4.257142857142857
8270157,5,6301973100,"Like I said, this is the absolute best Shari Lewis video ever!  My brother and I watched it repeatedly when we were kids (almost 20 years ago) and we STILL have most of it memorized to this day!  That's the kind of lasting impact Kooky Classics has.  This is great for children as well as adults.  It's funny, entertaining, and even cultural.  Unlike Barney the Dinosaur and the like, you'll actually WANT to watch and ENJOY watching this with your kids (and even by yourself :) ).
Simply put ~ I LOVE this video, and you will too.",1047945600,3,531,4.377551020408164
