2056501,3,B00022LIGQ,"This movie is mislabeled. It is not the Roy Rogers movie ""Heart of the Rockies (1951)"" but it is the ""Heart of the Rockies (1937)"", one of the Three Mesquiteers Series.
Both good movies, but hardly interchangable.",1200268800,5,213,4.783783783783784

It begins with men singing as they walk. Roy, the highway engineer, warns of a blast. Elsewhere some men stampede cattle into a canyon. The explosion sends rock tumbling down, burying some of the cattle. Roy goes to the W-W ranch to explain. He meets June and Mr. Willard. There is a fight, Roy is outnumbered and beaten! June disapproves. The new road will save 50 miles for travelers. The foreman Devry has a plan to stop the highway work. There is a Guest Ranch with humor. Next a song for entertainment. Willard plans a meeting with the ranchers who rent from him. A stolen diamond brooch results in a complaint against one of the boys in the reform camp. But he jumps into a wagon and rides away. They put humor in this chase. Willard says the road will ruin the small ranchers. Higher taxes will force land sales to farmers.

Former warden Parker explains the benefits of a reform camp over a prison. Willards tenants have to sign the petition. There is a song around a campfire. Two men sneak into the shack where they keep explosives. Someone sees them, but he is silenced. There is an explosion! Maybe it wasn't an accident says Roy. The boys blame the death on Willard and decide to do something. Roy arrives cool things down. Willard asks who killed Parker but gets no answer. June sees a young man, he rides off, there is a chase. The rodeo attracts visitors. There is comedy and a song. There is a dance with mounted riders. The Sheriff arrives, there was a bank robbery in town and they left a sack from the State Highway Department. Roy said it was done by those who killed warden Parker. The boys from the reform camp are ordered back there.

June tells Roy where Jim Corly is hiding. Corly tells Roy about the operation with cattle. They are switching scrub cattle for Willards pure-bred stock. But Roy and Jim are seen and are pursued by the bad guys! [A chase and shooting for action.] Roy has a trick to distract the pursuers, then he goes to Willards ranch. Roy tells what Devry has been doing. But Devry has a quick explanation. Willard appears for a showdown. There is a shooting, Roy fights Devry, June rides off to call the Sheriff. Jim holds off Devrys men. [How many bullets in a six-shooter revolver?] Roy and Jim ride away pursued by Devry and his men. June and the Sheriff arrive. Devrys men take hostages to get away. Roy gets volunteers from the reform camp, he has a plan to stop Devrys gang. [They add comedy to these scenes.] Devry hides in a barn. Roys dog attacks Devry! The bad guys are caught, the reform camp will continue its good work.

This is an interesting and complicated story where the big landowner uses his power for political gain. His trusted foreman is cheating him by stealing valuable cattle. But theres always a slip-up to reveal the true criminals. This is like a lesson why democracy is better than rule by an autocrat, especially as he ages and loses his judgement by his isolation. Servants of a powerful ruler tell him what he wants to know, so he doesnt know the real situation. You can find examples in history. It is also an argument for a sentence that rehabilitates rather than punishes. The story tells something about audience expectations.",1482105600,,3241,4.544520547945205

8020650,5,B00022LIGQ,"This DVD game was awesome to me, and yes, like some of the other review I looked at prior to purchase stated, the cards are too small, and the game goes very quickly, but with a few adjustments with card size on my computer, keep original only as templates, and the use of the pause button, this game came out great. We used it as a adult interactive game during my 11y/o graduation party, giving out small token gifts for cover all bingo winners. It was the hit of the party.",1403740800,2,476,4.241758241758242

In this video I liked the presentation at the beginning with the interview.

8020656,5,B00022LIGQ,"A local restaurant plays this game on kids night.  since we can't eat out all of the time, I bought it for my daughter.  We also bought separately the sliding shutter cards instead of using the small write on wipe cards that are included.  It's a great game the whole family can enjoy.  It's a DVD, so you can pause it to let small children catch up.",1294444800,2,350,4.17910447761194
