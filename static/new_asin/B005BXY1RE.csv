4649109,5,B005BXY1RE,"Sure, it's all a big, savvy marketing ploy, having this animated series on Disney XD and releasing these DVDs, what with Joss Whedon's AVENGERS set to clobber the box office this coming summer. But cynicism must stand down when the production values are of this caliber. AVENGERS: EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES! is the boss! This show pays attention to character arcs, the development of continuity, the visual graphics (love, love, love the character designs), the voice acting. It's all here. Head writer Christopher Yost has got his finger on my pulse and yours, and geek love runneth over like a mother.

This show piggybacks off several eras, lifting from Stan Lee and Jack Kirby and also from the Ultimate Universe, as well as from the cinematic adaptations. The core members are the original ones, only I'm rather glad that, in this iteration, the Hulk is sticking around. What's amazing is that Marvel and DC seem to be striving to churn out more episodes per season. Off the top of my head, WOLVERINE AND THE X-MEN, IRON MAN: ARMORED ADVENTURES, BATMAN: THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD (at least in its first two seasons) and YOUNG JUSTICE have all tallied 26 eps per season. AVENGERS: EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES! Vol. 3: IRON MAN UNLEASHED showcases six more terrific episodes.

- Episode #14 - """"Masters of Evil""
- Episode #15 - ""459""
- Episode #16 - ""The Man Who Stole Tomorrow""
- Episode #17 - ""Come the Conqueror""
- Episode #18 - ""The Kang Dynasty""
- Episode #19 - ""Widow's Sting""

In a nod to continuity, the Avengers are still corraling them supervillains what hastily beat feet during the mass prison breakouts from the Vault, the Cube, the Big House, and the Raft. And, as we learn in this volume, Dr. Pym (a.k.a. Ant Man) has taken steps to construct the perfect penitentiary (more on that in a bit). But, first, we open with Baron Zemo and his ""Masters of Evil"" taking out the Avengers one by one, until only Ant Man and new members Hawkeye and the Black Panther are left. In ""459"" a powerful Kree sentry drone perceives the Avengers as a serious threat. This episode introduces the Kree warrior and xenobiologist Mar-Vell and also Major Carol Danvers (the future Ms. Marvel). ""The Man Who Stole Tomorrow,"" ""Come the Conqueror,"" and ""The Kang Dynasty"" comprise the three-part epic in which the Avengers try to stave off Kang's full-scale invasion. Interestingly, Kang insists that he's traveled from the 41st Century to save the world... by eliminating Captain America. This episode gives us a glimpse of Ant Man's new escape-proof maximum security prison which is safeguarded by a horde of Ultron robots. If you're aware of Pym and Ultron's troubled history, you can sense the ominous undercurrent. Finally, ""Widow's Sting"" has Hawkeye, the team's resident hothead, back on the traitorous Black Widow's trail, despite Nick Fury and Tony Stark's strict orders that he back off. This is also the first appearance of S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Bobbi Morse as Mockingbird. And she kicks much buttage.

I love all the foreshadowing. We know that the Ultron project is about to go haywire and that the immortal Enchantress has a bigger end game than just being a card-carrying member of the Masters of Evil. We get a whiff of an impending interstellar war. Surprisingly, Janet Van Dyne has become a favorite of mine as she is just so spunky and likable, a stark contrast to Hank Pym's cautious, wet blanket scientist-hero. And while Iron Man calls the shots, Captain America easily emerges as the natural leader. You can see why there's tension between the two. Marvel has always been at its best when it's juggling the grandiose elements with the petty personal soap operas.

The DVD's bonus feature: ""Avengers Unmasked: Masters of Evil"" - to quote the DVD case, this is ""an animated in-episode comic book experience loaded with fun facts on Marvel's Avengers and the Villains that challenge them."" Basically, the ""Masters of Evil"" episode plays picture-in-picture while trivia captions pop up onscreen. It's worth checking out.",1321228800,4,4020,4.914580265095729
4649110,4,B005BXY1RE,"Even though studios other than Disney, who owns Marvel, have their names on the recent hit live action movies based on the characters (Captain America, Thor, etc.), Disney owns the licenses and is now releasing some of most recent animated TV episodes featuring Iron Man, X-Men, and The Avengers.

Volumes 1 and 2, released a few months back, contained episodes that traced the origins of several characters and their assemblage into the powerful, but (in the Marvel tradition) angst-filled, dysfunctional crime fighting Avengers family.

Since the two new DVDs  -- Volume 3: Iron Man Unleased and Volume 4: Thor's Last Stand -- offer 13 additional episodes, all interconnected in some way by story arcs and character relationships, it's tricky business for the uninitiated to start with them ""cold,"" though each set includes one fact-filled ""Avengers Unmasked"" version of a key episode as a bonus feature.

This information comes in mighty handy, even as a refresher. Part of the fun of the Marvel Avengers is keeping track of who's got a beef with whom, which couples are an ""item,"" and which villains are either bent on controlling the galaxy or just tortured souls who are lashing out.

Therein lies the Marvel charm: the good guys are not perfect, they bicker and even hurt each other, yet united they are the only hope against the total destruction of the entire universe, which is threatened roughly every four episodes.

I know that's a little snide. Actually, the stories are laced with humor, characters are always given opportunities for development between battles, and the animation is staged with the epic scope of a blockbuster Hollywood action movie. This is quality stuff.

But if you don't know the Wasp from the Enchantress, you'll enjoy following the proceedings in Vols. 2 and 3 by either watching 1 and 2 first or catching up with the ""Unmasked"" features.",1320537600,,1877,5.016077170418006
4649111,4,B005BXY1RE,"We are huge superhero fans at Imaginerding HQ. With the rebirth, so to speak, of the Marvel Universe with the Iron Man film, we have seen every film and collected the DVDs.

Much like the first season, we found the stories to be engaging, exciting and educational. Yes, I said educational. We were able to use the DVDs as a starting point to talk about Norse Mythology and how we have run into these same gods, goddesses and stories in other media. I was surprised that my twelve year-old was as captivated by the stories as my eight year-old. Whenever the story talked about Yggdrasil or the nine realms, we were reminded of the amazing book series by Michael Scott, the Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel.

The second season brings Loki's plan to fruition that began in the first season. You can still enjoy Volumes Three and Four without watching the previous two, but I would urge you to watch the whole series for the stories and the arc. Both seasons are a great interim while waiting for the release of the Avengers movie in 2012. They add a lot of depth to the existing film franchise and fans of Iron Man, Captain America and Thor will revel in the back stories and character development.

The voice acting was very well done and the animation was a notch above most superhero animated series that we have seen. These two volumes represent the story arc of the second season of the Disney XD series.

15 - 459

Although the final episode ties up the Loki story nicely, there is a surprise cliff hanger that leaves us waiting for Season Three.

4649112,5,B005BXY1RE,"The Avengers Assemble for more fun and adventure as volumes 3 and 4 are now coming out.

4649155,5,B005BXY1RE,"THE AVENGERS: EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES, VOLUME 3: IRON MAN UNLEASHED collects together episodes 14-19 of the first season of The Avengers: Earths Mightiest Heroes tv series. The episodes do a good job of combining old school references to the original comic book heroes with a post-modern sensibility. In the first two volumes in the series (HEROS ASSEMBLE! and CAPTAIN AMERICA REBORN!), the episodes worked ok as stand-alone episodes. Thats not quite the case anymore, but a brief prologue showing relevant events from previous episodes really helps out. The animation isn't bad: it's not Pixar, but it is a step above animated tv action shows from the 1980s, e.g. G.I. JOE. The six episodes in THE AVENGERS: IRON MAN UNLEASHED are:

14. Masters of Evil  Zeno, the Enchantress, the Executioner, Abomination, Crimson Dynamo, and Wonder Man join together to form an anti-Avenger group: the Masters of Evil. Together they seem unstoppable. The Avengers Mansion is attacked and one-by-one the Avengers fall until only Black Panther and Hawkeye are left.

15. 459  A Kree Sentry falls to the Earth and is an ill omen of things to come. Its up to Ant-Man and the Wasp to stop it. However, they are joined by an alien who has been living on Earth and who is from the Kree empire: Captain Marvel.

16. The Man Who Stole Tomorrow  Kang the Conqueror, a dictator from the far future, comes to the present to save his loved one and his timeline from annihilation. In order to do that, he has to kill Captain America.

17. Come the Conqueror  Kang is determined to save his timeline and sends his destroyers all around the world. The Avengers try to find Kang, but discover hes not on or near Earth.

18. The Kang Dynasty  the exciting conclusion to the Kang storyline. Kang has conquered Earth and there seems to be no stopping him, but he has a weakness and its up to the Avengers to find it.

19. Widows Sting  Hawkeye and Mockingbird hunt down the Black Widow.

I'm not sure why the first season was broken down into four sets, but I really enjoyed THE AVENGERS: EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES, VOLUME 3: IRON MAN UNLEASED  and can't wait to see what happens next in Vol. 4.

A bonus feature on the DVD is a featurette entitled Avengers Unmasked: Masters of Evil is an animated in-epiode comic book loaded with fun facts about the Avengers and the Villains they fight.",1392595200,,2355,4.709756097560976

4649172,5,B005BXY1RE,"This is the best Avengers volume yet.  And I'm not just saying that because my favorite Avenger gets top billing in the title.  Here's a review of the episodes, with synopsizes from Wikipedia.

14.  Masters of Evil:  With Wonder Man, the Enchantress, the Executioner, the Crimson Dynamo, and the Abomination on his side, Baron Zemo leads them as the Masters of Evil in a systematic takedown of the Avengers.  A great episode with Marvel's Legion of Doom.  A

15.  459:  Wasp and the Avengers meet Captain Marvel and team up with him to stop a Kree Sentry from destroying the planet.  Another great episode.  A

16-18.  The Man Who Stole Tomorrow/Come the Conqueror/The Kang Dynasty:  Kang the Conqueror comes from the 41st century to destroy Captain America, who Kang believes may soon cause his timeline to cease to exist.  This isn't just the best story on the disc; these are the best 3 episodes I've seen of the whole show so far.  A+

19.  Widow's Sting:  Hawkeye, Captain America, Black Panther, and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Mockingbird take on HYDRA in order to find Black Widow - much to the dismay of Nick Fury.  An excellent episode introducing Hawkeye's future wife (in the comics at least).  A+
