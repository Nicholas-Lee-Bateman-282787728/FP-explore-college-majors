8503965,3,B006TA6ILU,"First, I am a huge Alvin Lee fan and loved TYA. There are only two other guitarists I like better, Satriani and Blackmore. OK. THE GOOD: the audio is pretty good for a live 1975 visual. There is a good selection of material, some of the expected but also some first timers. There are some nice shots of Mr. Lee doing his thing. THE BAD: the camera work is mundane. The audience gets in the way occasionally. You virtually never see Chick Churchill. It is all in black and white and FAR from any type of sharp HD quality. At times it is even slightly murky. THE UGLY: the DVD starts in the middle of a song. I mean, you hit PLAY and they ARE. There is no beginning to the concert. ""I'm Going Home"" is also started partway into the song. What the freak? THE WEIRD: No liner notes whatsoever. We are not told where the show is being performed. And perhaps strangest of all, the cover of the DVD has a photo of TYA,... NOW. Not with Alvin Lee on guitar, but the chap who replaced him, and a very gray and gaunt Leo Lyons. Completely bizarre. So my guess is this was rushed out from the vaults of some European TV show archive and dashed together in the wake of Lee's passing. So, why do I give it 3 stars? Because there is so very little of this amazing band captured on video. This is better than nothing and at least sounds better than the Marquee show. If you can get it for a really good price - as I did - then get it. But don't pay a lot. Here's hoping there is something somewhere that is much higher quality that we just don't know about yet.",1385769600,,1546,4.1395348837209305
