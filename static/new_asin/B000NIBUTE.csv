2768869,5,B000NIBUTE,I LOVED THIS DVD. I LOVE THE ACTORS AND ACTRESSES AND THE SHOW WAS EXCELLENT.,1188864000,,77,4.2
2768870,5,B000NIBUTE,"I had heard of this film but never got the chance to see it until recently on TCM. What a delightful film! I had forgotten that Gary Cooper made another film with the beautiful and talented Teresa Wright. She was not only beautiful, but made you feel like you were 'home' whenever she is on the screen. This is a sentimental film but also very funny- I will be buying the DVD so I can add this adorable film to my collection of classic films. What a pleasure to watch a film that actually has a storyline you can follow without the usual sex scenes in movies today, and best of all no profanity! When Teresa Wright's character has the baby you know Gary Cooper is the father, but we didn't have to see the conception to know how the baby got there....well...what a novel idea! Not showing an intimate moment between a man and a woman and we actually get it! Think about it...do we really need to see all that nonsense in the present day movies to get the point??? I think not! This is what makes these films timeless- Hopefully the movie studios will continue to release these wonderful classic films.",1185148800,22,1101,4.401960784313726
2768871,5,B000NIBUTE,"This film stars Gary Cooper as a small town college professor and Teresa Wright as the society woman he meets and immediately falls head over heels in love with while on a trip to New York. He's trying to get a book published about his ancestor, the notorious lover Casanova. Her mother however who consults the astrology charts for every decision she makes tells the newlyweds that their marriage is doomed to fail. Cooper disagrees and a heated argument insues between the family which eventually leads to an anullment. Nine months later back in his home town Cooper is set to marry Anita Louise whose father played by Frank Morgan (the wizard from the Wizard of Oz) is adamantly against the marriage. Not because he dislikes Cooper but because he dislikes marriage! He turns in a very funny performance as the cranky father of the bride. On the day before their wedding Cooper receives a cryptic letter from a maternity hospital in Chicago saying they need to speak with him. He recounts the tale of his week long marriage to a woman in New York to Morgan and he encourages him to go to Chicago and see what's going on.

There's a very funny bit once he gets to the hospital and they escort him to a room and tell him to undress. He's quite perplexed seeing as how it's a maternity hospital and he's a man. They run him through a battery of tests as other expectant father's watch in disbelief while they wheel him around on a hospital bed. It turns out that Wright has had a baby girl and Cooper is the father. She plans to put her up for adoption and they ran all the tests on him to get his medical information. At first he is very surprised to know that he has a child but once he sees her he's completely smitten and also very upset that she will be given away. He can't talk Wright out of it so out of desparation he dresses like a doctor and kidnaps his little girl.

After checking into a hotel he enlists a bellman and a maid to help him take care of his daughter. He knows very little about babies but with the help of some books he gets the hang of it pretty quickly. My favorite scene is where he mistakes her rapid weight gain (which is normal for newborns) as a sign of a glandular problem. He sits on the bed looking at his daughter and very sweetly whispers to her 'daddy will love you no matter how big you get'. I don't want to give away the ending but it is a happy one.

The movie was released in 1944 and I can imagine it was quite shocking to see a single man taking care of a baby. Cooper even says in one scene how unfair it is that a man can run the country but they won't let him take care of his own child unless he's married. This is a very sweet and funny movie and I would encourage you to give it a look.",1173916800,56,2738,4.211428571428572

Plot: Cooper is about to be married when a former relationship (Teresa Wright..great as usual) comes back into his life.

Frank Morgan is very funny and steals the show.  This movie is a lot of fun and safe for the entire family.",1464825600,,453,4.125
2768886,5,B000NIBUTE,"I love old movies and I have always liked Gary Cooper and he did not disappoint in this movie. The best part of the movie was after he kidnapped his own baby. I thought my deceased husband was nuts after our first child was born (over 50 years ago) but Cooper even topped him. I thought that Cooper was a little over the top when it came to taking care of the baby, but hey, that is one of the things that made this movie so funny.

I also thought that the future father in-law was especially played a good part--the man who played the wizard in ""The Wizard of Oz."" The character that played the hotel maid was not someone I had ever seen in movies when she was very young--I was amazed. I was use to seeing her playing in parts after she became much older. Sorry, don't know her name, she always mostly played character parts.

This was a light hearted comedy and a good family movie that you would not mind sharing with the whole family. I am glad that I watched this one. Actors back then were so much better than a lot of actors are today. And even best of all, you don't have to put up with profanity and steamy sex scenes in this classic movie.",1457222400,2,1150,4.1524663677130045

2768903,3,B000NIBUTE,"In the modern cinema no social subject matter from transgender issues to various drug additions and family problems is off limits. And whether the issue is done as a serious dramatic effort or as a comedy sketch no one is shocked by whatever is on the screen (and if one is then the solution is to avert your eyes, walk out of the theater, or sent the DVD back). Sometimes looking at the old classic black and white romantic comedies movies which were usually done as feel good epics and skirted the tough social issue as much as possible you forget that every once in a while they actually dealt with serious subject matter that you would not have thought would have made it pass the producers or studios chopping block. Take the film under review, the romantic comedy Casanova Brown which is a slapstick way deals with gender issues, adoption, bigamy, marriage as an institution, science vs. the occult, and, well, the correct most up to date way to bring up baby (circa 1944).
See this professor, well, writer anyway, Casanova Brown (played by lanky, laconic Gary Cooper usually seen in serious stuff like facing down gunslingers and the mob in High Noon, setting things right in Washington, D.C., or taking up the fight in the International Brigades in Spain, and a little romance on the side, in the film adaptation of Hemingways Farewell To Arms), all Midwest naivet&eacute; in tack goes off the rails when he, as will happen to anybody, goes to New York City and gets married to some Mayfair swell co-ed, Isabel (played by classic 1940s girl next door Teresa Wright),  in a whirlwind romance. The marriage does not take hold once Casanova pulls the hammer down on Isabels mothers reliance on astrology and other occult methods for running their lives. They split up, that marriage is annulled, and Casanova heads back to the Midwest to try to marry a willowy blonde who also comes from wealth (and a dingbat neer-do-well gold-digger father)

Then things start getting interesting since on the very eve of his marriage to willowy blonde, Madge by name, he gets information that a baby is to be born in Chicago and he needs to get there. As it turned out Isabel and Casanova might have split up by they were doing some fooling around before then since Isabel got pregnant and by the time Casanova gets to Chicago he is the father to a bouncing baby girl. A girl whom Isabel, now not married but a mother, not a good thing in staid 1940s land, has put up for adoption. Once Casanova gets a look at the baby though all his paternal, hell, maybe maternal instincts come out and he is daffy for the little one.

Not just daffy though but also determined to not have his baby adopted by some strangers. So like any good father he kidnaps the baby and hides out in a hotel where everybody except the police is looking for him. In the process he is also, as a good professor, man of science, and rational thinker a good mother to the child looking up all the then current literature on bringing up baby. But the heat was on so he decided to marry a hotel housekeeper (the called maids) to be able to keep the child. Naturally, in the end after all this is a romantic comedy, Casanova and Isabel get back together and all is right with the world and baby will grow up to be part of the generation of 68 who tried to turn the world upside down, and lost.

Now lets see if you were paying attention. The baby was not illegitimate, Casanova did not commit bigamy, twice (to Madge or the hotel maid), and the stars were all aligned for them, occult mother or not. Now about that kidnapping charge. You know this is a 1940s film so you know very well no charges were brought. If you like screwball comedies this one will make you laugh, and scratch your head.",1430697600,3,3751,4.50367107195301

They had cut at least 15 minutes or more of the movie and it was the best part of the movie, because in it, Gary Cooper had to learn to take care of his baby, something that men did not know how to do in the 50's. He learned to put the diappers on his child, and at last understood the baby cry's and what kind of formula give to him, etc. He depicted the good father, that learns how to take care of his child.

Thinking is is but an advertisement for business, he calls the place but the number is disconnected.  He remembers marrying briefly about 9 months ago and only spending the wedding night with his wife before the marriage is annulled.

2768929,4,B000NIBUTE,"Gary Cooper gets maternal in CASANOVA BROWN, Sam Wood's 1944 comedy about the lengths a divorced father will go in order to remain close to his child.  Co-starring Teresa Wright and Anita Louise, this is sadly one of the least-remembered titles from Cooper's long and varied screen career.

Casanova Brown (Gary Cooper), a mild-mannered scholar--and apparent distant relative of the renowned lover--is looking forward to settling down with lovely Madge Ferris (Anita Louise) until he receives the most curious letter from a Chicago maternity hospital.  Casa's mind casts back to when he married college girl Isabel Drury (Teresa Wright), a marriage that was quickly annulled after Casa's disastrous first meeting with the in-laws, which resulted in their mansion being burnt to the ground!  Evidently, Casa and Isabel's relationship produced a baby girl--and now unmarried Isabel needs to put her up for adoption.  Horrified Casa smuggles his daughter out of the hospital, determined to raise her; and all hell breaks loose when, after Casa's secret cover is finally blown, both Madge and Isabel descend on the bewildered new father!

CASANOVA BROWN was quite possibly a very risqu film when it was first released.  I can't imagine the movie enjoying a smooth passage through the censors office.  Dealing candidly with the subject of unwed mothers, bachelor fathers and possibly even bigamy, CASANOVA BROWN walks a very fine line.  The script by Nunnally Johnson (based on the play ""Accidental Father"" by Floyd Dell) zips along at a good pace and showcases Frank Morgan, playing Madge's gold-digging father, in one of his greatest performances.  Sadly Teresa Wright fades into the background playing a very weak young woman who'd rather break up her marriage than leave her parents' bosom (her mother is played by talented Patricia Collinge, who also co-starred with Wright in the Hitchcock classic ""Shadow of a Doubt"" the previous year).

No extras but a solid transfer.",1247443200,3,1971,5.245222929936306

2768931,3,B000NIBUTE,"Cas Brown: ""I find myself in an extremely awkward position.""

Let's plot it out: On the eve of his wedding, college professor Casanova ""Cas"" Brown (Cooper) receives an enigmatic letter from a Chicago maternity hospital. Before jetting to Chicago to see what the blazes is going on, Cas reveals to his prospective father-in-law that he had been briefly married less than a year ago, that marriage since then annulled. Arriving at the maternity hospital, Cas sees his adorable baby girl for the first time and falls in love with her. When he finds out that she's slated for adoption (with his ex-wife about to be re-married herself), he decides to make off with the baby.

Some trivia now. CASANOVA BROWN, released in 1944, is based on the play by Floyd Dell and Thomas Mitchell, which had already been adapted twice to cinema, in 1930 (starring Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.) and in 1939 (starring Hugh Herbert), with both of those films titled LITTLE ACCIDENT. CASANOVA BROWN provides the second teaming of Gary Cooper and Teresa Wright, the first pairing being in the all-time 1942 classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Pride-of-the-Yankees-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B000MTFDD8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Pride of the Yankees (Anniversary Edition)</a>.

But it does have a few things going for it, not the least of which are the two leads Cooper and Wright.

Cooper comes with his patented low key acting style, and his natural ""aw, shucks"" charisma somehow carries him thru the wacky situations his character gets put into. Teresa Wright is typically sweet-natured and very lovely and simply looks radiant on camera. By the by, the Wizard of Oz himself, Frank Morgan, in his part of J.J. Ferris, an old, callous, and opinionated scoundrel and Cas's confidant, scores some smiles from me but also a bit of ill will. He handed his daughter Madge some pretty underserved shabby treatment there. Meanwhile, Anita Louise makes the most of her thankless role of Madge, and she does provide additional babe candy. But I felt bad for her. The movie's hook is also pretty cute. Actors may notoriousy not like working with babies, afraid that they might be upstaged by the young 'uns. But there's no doubt it's more a winning plot formula than not.

Um, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. CASANOVA BROWN isn't a bad flick, but there's a reason this isn't hailed as Cooper's showcase comedy film. Overall, the film offers mild-mannered humor and is merely a notch above your average picture, with the romantic angle more or less taking a back seat. It's not as funny as I'd hoped, although it does have its funny moments, most of these dealing with Cooper's antics as unsuspecting new pops. The funniest scene, though, may have been a funny flashback in which Cas meets Isabel's disapproving and horoscope-obsessed parents and then proceeds to burn down their $750,000 home. Inadvertently, of course.

Cas, by the way, is named after his ancestor, the original Casanova. That the movie doesn't take more advantage of this plot device seems a dang shame. But I guess it's hard to picture Cooper in the role of the seducer. He's a good looking dude, I guess, but his placid, straight-forward personality doesn't lend itself to such outrageous hijinks.

Star power and cute baby shenanigans drive CASANOVA BROWN, and I was glad enough that I saw this picture. One wonders, though, what Cary Grant or William Powell - actors with a decidedly lighter touch than Cooper - would've done in the role of Casanova Brown. That might be the difference between the comedy classic this could've been and a picture that is pleasant, occasionally amusing, and mildly risque for its time. Which is what this is.",1194134400,6,4482,5.803951367781155

The humor is not light hearted because the subject is actually rather heartbreaking.

8177797,4,B000NIBUTE,"Casanova Q. Brown's  first marriage to Isabelle ended in catastrophe due to his mother in law's unbending belief in astrology and a lack of ashtrays. His marriage was annulled by the bride's family.

On the eve of his marriage to Madge in Rossmore (presumably in Illinois), he receives a mysterious letter from a maternity hospital in Chicago. Upon the advice of Madge's father (played delightfully by Frank Morgan whose most famous role was the wizard in the Wizard of Oz), he goes to Chicago to find out what the letter was about. He sees his baby daughter and Isabelle. Isabelle tells him she is giving the baby up for adoption. Casanova is distraught! He disguises himself as a doctor and steals his infant daughter. Staying in the Hotel Windsor, he learns everything he can about caring for his daughter. Then Madge and her father and Isabelle and her father turn up looking for him. Frank Morgan shines in this short movie. Gary Cooper is different than he is in most of his other movies, sometimes inept and sometimes intelligent. This is a goofy plot but has many very good actors in all the roles, even the minor ones,  and they all bring it off.",1493078400,2,1155,4.651960784313726

Gary Cooper is about to be married for the second time when he finds out his first wife, (marriage annulled) has just given birth to their child and has put the baby up for adoption.  It's a romantic comedy with a predictable ending but nevertheless fun to watch.  Hollywood could never make such a charming movie today, they wouldn't know how to handle it with discretion.
