8641301,2,B00IDRQ3JO,The DVD in it self works well but so far I watched the cabaret play and it was kind of boring. I love watching plays but that one couldn't catch my interest. I haven't watched the bachelor party yet so my amount of stars might change once I see it but the quality of the DVD is good.,1472860800,,283,3.896551724137931
