I never write reviews but feel the obligation to write one this time: it is a compilation of 1-2 minute tips and looks more like a commercial than anything else. All videos in this series fall into the same format",1360108800,,236,4.2444444444444445
8089973,2,B000BNZMJ0,This should be a 1.99 download...  do not waste your money here - the video sections are only about 60 seconds long (each) and there are only about 10-12 of them..  not in depth at all...  just some guy who has to introduce himself every time...  it's tedious..,1358294400,,261,4.375
8089974,1,B000BNZMJ0,This is nothing but a advertsiment for North American SkiTraining Center - sold as an instructional video. The actual information contained in the DVD is laughable - 5 minutes maybe.  Unbelievable.,1137196800,6,197,5.354838709677419
8089975,4,B000BNZMJ0,"As the title suggested, this DVD focuses on ""tactics"", which is different from techniques but equally important. For advanced skiers who have mastered the technical part of a good turn, tactics are the next set of skills they need to work on in order to conquer the whole mountain.

The DVD contains drills, tips, and demos to help you made better tactical choices when you ski moguls and steeps. The feature that I like the best is the ""step by step trainer notes"". It breakdown the movements into different stages and provides a summary & picture for each. I wish I can print those out and bring them to the slope!

Overall, the DVD is more valuable for advanced skiers than intermediate skiers. Intermediate skiers who haven't quite able to make a solid turn will find it difficult to perform some of the drills accurately.",1135987200,,826,4.689655172413793
8089976,5,B000BNZMJ0,"Chris Fellows is the real deal, you don't get to the PSIA demo team unless you are an elite skier and, more importantly, an elite teacher. I have a personal bias because I have trained with Chris through his North American Ski Training Center programs and have first hand experience as to his exceptional skills in both these areas. A total learning experience involves real world coaching, video analysis and feedback, post training follow up and a reference library of tips, tactics and advice that the eager student can use to extend their learning away from their coach. With this set of DVD's Fellows has completed his NASTC curriculum while at the same time offering a stand alone product that is extremely valuable to the passionate skier who is unable to spend the whole winter in the mountains training. The DVD's are full of nuggets of wisdom, simply explained and precisely demonstrated so that they can easily be implemented the next time you are facing real ski terrain. For some these are a refresher tips or a better way to do something they are already doing, for most they will be the ""light bulb moment"" that solves on the mountain challenges they have been struggling with for years. Either way they are fun to watch and will enhance your relationship with the mountain the next time you click in and point `em down!",1133481600,,1335,4.733905579399142
8089977,4,B000BNZMJ0,"If you are an expert skier you may not need the tips that the video provides.  However, if you are planning on taking any lessons this season, or you are a skier that is trying to become more advanced, this video will definitely save you money and help you improve.  For a lot less than a 1 hour private lesson, you get a bunch of drills and specific focuses for you to try out and work on the next time you ski.  In fact, if you take the time to try out all the things presented and worked towards actually mastering them, not only will your skiing improve, but you will have gotten many hours of lessons out of it.

You really can't take a video up on the mountain with you to teach you to ski.  That's another reason I like this style of instruction - focused drills with clear objectives, clearly presented and demonstrated.  The simple concepts and ideas presented in the video are easy to remember and I am actually able to recall them when I am skiing without having to take a bunch of notes with me.

Overall, I think it's a great value ...",1133222400,,1048,4.236180904522613
8089978,1,B000BNZMJ0,"Don't waste your money.  I am checking Amazon's return policy.  This DVD is exceedingly bad.  The description says that the viewer has the ability to navigate through the DVD.  The problem is that there are about 4 subtopics on moguls and 6 subtopics on steeps.  Each is about one minute.  The creator has compiled about 10 ski tips into a DVD and is palming it off as a full instructional video.  Where is the substance, guys?

Maybe I am spoiled, having purchased ""Breakthrough on Skis II, Bumps and Powder"".  Admittedly ""Breakthrough"" is a tough act to follow, but ""All Mountain Skiing Tactics"" is not worth watching, let alone paying $20 bucks for it.
