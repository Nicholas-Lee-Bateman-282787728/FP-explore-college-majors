8570756,1,B00BMCXYNK,"I don't think that this video has enough content to use for teaching.  There is no mention of the stages of death, and what you can do to assist the person you are caring for.  Each stage needs to be identified and assistance in coping.  Why was the CNA wiping the patients face?  I was disappointed.  I cannot recommend this video for trading purposes, but maybe limited information.",1458518400,,384,4.588235294117647
