Its great to instill knowledge of the sacraments when children ask questions.  But lets be honest, they don't always ask.  And they don't always know what to ask  nor do I.  And I don't always know what specifics to share.

So it can be difficult sometimes to know where to start when we want to share our Faith with kids.

Ive experienced this both as a faith formation instructor and as a Mother.

Our family recently was blessed to receive a copy of the Kids and the Sacraments DVD.  It is a fantastic way to share our Catholic Faith with the next generation of little ones.

This DVD would be helpful for children in preschool or elementary school, although it could be used creatively for older children as a quick intro video to the sacraments as well.

Ever wondered how hosts are prepared for Communion?  This DVD gives you a close up look at the entire process from start to finish by taking you to a convent in Kentucky!  It reminded me so much of when Mr. Rogers took viewers behind the scenes to see how things are made.

So I love that this video is kind of like a Catholic PBS show!

Children share their knowledge of the sacraments throughout the video, with little clips of them talking at playgrounds or in their environment, just like when kids shared their thoughts on the old-school version of Sesame Street or Reading Rainbow.

This is a great way to get your own kids talking!

This video has plenty of opportunities to pause the action and discuss the sacraments with your kids.  Its perfect for the think-pair-share style of discussion.  This is where you first ask a question or give a prompt (which the video does for you).  Then you let students pair up with a partner, share their thoughts with each other, and then they can share their thoughts with the class or group.

This DVD resource would make a great addition to any homeschool group, any parish that provides faith formation classes, or to any family wanting to help their children learn to love the sacraments.

I thought it was awesome because when it comes to helping my kids love their Faith, Ill take all the help I can get!

*This review was for the entire set of four sacraments, but this DVD just of the Baptism section is great, too if that's all you're needing!",1466899200,,2374,4.505854800936768
