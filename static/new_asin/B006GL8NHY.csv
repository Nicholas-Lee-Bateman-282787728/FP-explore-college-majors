8497658,4,B006GL8NHY,"The two documentaries about ""Everest"" and ""Titanica,"" are about life and death struggles in two very different places. The first documentary, ""Everest,"" was narrated by Liam Neesom about the men and women seeking to climb Mount Everest, the tallest spot on the planet. Climbing Mount Everest is still one of the most dangerous sights in the world. You can barely breathe without an oxygen mask. During the time of the filming in 1996, the climbers endure a massive, deadly storm.

The second documentary, ""Titanica,"" is perhaps better of the two in my opinion. The documentary takes you to the Titanic's watery grave with rare glimpses of the ship's remains. Titanic survivor, Eva Hart MBE, was interviewed here as well. She lost her beloved father, Benjamin, and survived with her mother. They were planning to immigrate to Canada. Eva's mother had a terrible premonition about boarding the ship. There are historians and engineers to help viewers understand the disaster.
