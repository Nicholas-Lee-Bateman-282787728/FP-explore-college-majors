8156880,5,6303312152,I had taken lessons here (Pa) from a skiing instructor. Both my daughter and I really wanted to learn as we have the mountains close by. The skiing instructor was terrible and full of himself. He did not explain a thing. This video did explain alot to me and I have decided to forget the lessons for now rent myself a pair of skis and try this stuff on school hill. This video advises you to take lessons and I believe you should just don't take  them from an instructor in Pa. I got much more info from this video and from reading skiing books.,1268352000,,545,4.190476190476191
