3849691,1,B0025X4PPG,"Amazon, you're doing it again.
 No listing of movies or letting customers know if this is the complete series of all Hopalong Cassidy movies made. Platinum made the very best re-makes of all hoppy movies, complete, with no editing.  The box says DVD's and you say only one DVD for $75.00. Amazon, get organized, you're sales might improve! This rating should have 6 stars.
Sincerely,

3849692,5,B0025X4PPG,I am giving this product 5 stars because of the Hopalong Cassidy movies and TV show. I don't know exactly what is contained in this item because there is no product description. Are all 52 episodes of the TV series and all 66 movies included? I checked with Platinum Disc which is now owned by Echo Bridge Entertainment and they do not have this listed .  Would someone from Amazon please update this product so people would know what they are buying?,1245110400,4,451,4.5

3849717,4,B0025X4PPG,"Be sure to read Max Petterson's review carefully. I think he is talking about both products, ie the 14 dvd set and the 10 dvd set. I, mistakenly, thought he was only talking about the new dvd's and thought he meant the extras were with that set. The 66 movies only included 10 dvd's sent in an envelope. Nothing else.",1509580800,2,317,4.3

3849724,4,B0025X4PPG,"I love these movies, and the packaging is just fine considering there are so many films involved. My only complaint is that the movies on the disks are not in chronological order. My preference in viewing is to start with the oldest and move forward in time. This meant that I had to identify which disk each movie was on and then check it off as I have watched it. The system works for me, but it is clumsy. How amazing it was to see ""George Hayes"" given credit when all I ever knew was that he was ""Gabby."" And how neat to know that he sometimes played the ""bad guy"" in these early films (though so far he is always there). William Boyd is a perfect Hoppy, and every film is just different enough that my enjoyment is complete. Highly recommended, with the single caveat.",1495238400,6,773,4.301369863013699

3849779,4,B0025X4PPG,"I like Hopalong Cassidy and this completes my collection of movies.  I already have some of them due to earlier purchases.  My only negative is that the disks are not labeled for volume numbers or what is on the disks.  I had to look at each disk to see what was on it and what volume it was and make notation marks on the insert for each case to indicate which movies were on which disks.  The arrangement of the movies on the disks was not in any particular order.  The individual movies appear to be random .  It would have been nice if they were arranged by release date (chronological order).  However, I still am watching them and only have 1.5 disks to finish watching.",1456012800,3,676,4.317460317460317

3849782,4,B0025X4PPG,"Someone ought to take Echo Bridge out behind the barn and wup'em! First they took the already released DVD sets and put them in a box. Okay, I'll let that slide. But watching this set can be maddening. The discs are not numbered nor are the titles in any particular order. The second disc simple lists the titles in what appears to be no particular order. To help you in finding the movie you want, I've organized the titles by box and disc and indicated the year for each movie so those like myself who like to watch shows in chronological order (I've numbered the discs consecutively by box 1-14) Hope this helps your enjoyment of this Hoppy set.

3849783,5,B0025X4PPG,"We enjoy the Hopalong Cassidy Ultimate Collector's Edition.  The dvd's are good, but the films should have been in chronlogical order.",1447286400,2,134,5.380952380952381
3849784,5,B0025X4PPG,"Just what I expected, very good!",1447113600,,32,4.5
3849785,1,B0025X4PPG,"Well, this boxed set of all 66 Hopalong Cassidy films had a nicely produced package.  That part the manufacturer got right.  It was when I began to play the discs that the trouble began.  Each disc started and stopped, started and stopped.  I changed to another DVD player.  Same thing.  Each film started and stopped, started and stopped.  I tried every trick I could think of to get it to play properly.  Nothing worked.  After a while, I just threw the set in the trash.

From what I could tell, though, as I vainly made my way through each disc, was that some of the material had excellent picture quality--and some just plain stunk.  Some had really poor picture quality.  (Dubbed off TV maybe?)  A really mixed bag.  The films were taken from several sources.  I couldn't help but wonder if the manufacturer was someone who lived in a dilapidated trailer park and put this set together to try to pay the rent.  No money was spent on this set at all.  And it shows.",1447113600,7,970,4.451428571428571
3849796,5,B0025X4PPG,The only complant is the movies were not in order according to the year. The reproductions were really good.,1447027200,,108,4.7368421052631575
3849797,5,B0025X4PPG,I've always had Hopalong Cassidy as my all time favorite cowboy/actor. I'm saving the movies for special occassions.,1443571200,,116,5.5
3849798,4,B0025X4PPG,"For some reason, the retailer that starts with a ""W"" had this out on their shelves on June 29th even though Ammy and other retailers have a pre-order date of September 1, 2015. I also paid only half of what the suggested retail price is. With that being said, I did pick this up as I had purchased one of the individual volumes that Platinum had put out quite a while ago and I really enjoyed all the stories on that disc.

You already know if you want this set, the questions are how well did Echo Bridge put this together? It comes in a box with two individual cases. In those cases are 7 discs in each one set on top of one another. On the back cover of each disc it lists the movies that are in the case, BUT it doesn't tell you on which disc is which movie. That my friends, is up to you to find out. And in no way does it come in any set order of release, just all random. In fact, on the back of the box it lists the movies and the year they were released, but if you go to IMDB, you will find that they even messed that up. I went to IMDB and printed out a list of the movies in order of release and I'm going through the discs to make some kind of order.

Since there are 14 discs, there are 5 movies on each disc, with the exception of one that has one movie, 3 radio shows, a digital biography, image and poster galleries and 19 Sunday comics if you put the disc in your DVD-ROM. . The compression isn't too bad and the black and white photography is at times great!  If you purchased any of the discs from Platinum before, expect the same thing. Some discs have the Echo Bridge logo, while others have the Platinum logo and in fact are the same discs with the same Volume numbers!

Skimming through the set, the movies seem complete and most have their original Paramount logos and United Artist release titles. At least one came from England with the censors approval title, and the picture and sound have been cleaned up. Not perfect, but definitely not public domain material. I'm very happy with how they look and sound.

I debated between 3 and 4 stars, mostly because of the lack of care in packaging and the randomness of it all. But the movies are what I expected so I'm giving it a higher rating. If you want the list of the movies in the proper order and the number of the discs that they are on, let me know.",1435968000,6,2331,4.114285714285714

Hoppy had a lot of side kicks from George ""Superman"" Reeves as lucky to Andy Clyde ""California Carson""  .

I am very unhappy with this product, and even more so with the Amazon return policy. I will think twice before ordering any more movies through them.

Yeah the western genre is simple -- good guy vs bad guy, fights and chase scenes but at age 10-14, I loved them. Great nostalgia for old guys remembering a simpler time in our lives.

If you like the old westerns, you'll be thrilled.",1315785600,,502,4.164948453608248
3849835,5,B0025X4PPG,"From Paramount's original idea of a one shot feature version of Hopalong Cassidy back in the mid-1930's to have starred James Gleason, Clarence E. Mulford's two-gun hero dressed in black was saved from a quick death when Silent and early sound movie star William Boyd won the role. From 1935 until 1948, Boyd starred in a series of 66 theatrical features, bought rights to the films to market to TV, produced half hour Hoppy adventures for radio and TV, and solidified his image as the character by marketing Hoppy products. The Cassidy films were always a notch or two above all the series westerns mass produced by Republic, Columbia, Universal and Monogram, both story and acting wise - and the series co-starring George ""Gabby"" Hayes and Andy Clyde as comic relief were some of the best. I had searched for years trying to find DVD copies of all the features and finally found the entire collection at Amazon. Although the collection was not pressed in order the films were produced and released, I went to the Internet Movie Data Base, punched in William Boyd and got the titles of all in ascending order, printed them on five pages and then added the proper discs and volume numbers - and that is the way I have been watching them. Although Hoppy hit the silver screen two years before I made my debut, I did catch the last releases from 1944 on in my local theater, and then caught the first releases when they played in our foot-square TV late Saturday afternoons. Now, over 60 years later, I again enjoy Hopalong's adventures - and they are still a notch or two above the other surviving western series. Oh yes, I watch them Saturday afternoons. All of the films have been digitally restored with audio-visual enhancement making the daylight scenes bright and shiny and the night scenes rich black and white. I recommend the collection for all my contemporaries and youngsters who just love good western movies.",1307491200,42,1920,4.751497005988024
3849856,5,B0025X4PPG,"I only vaguely recall watching Hopalong Cassidy as a young child, but in the photographs I had seen of William Boyd since then, dressed in black with gray hair, caused me to have no desire to ever view his movies or TV show on DVD as an adult.  Recently, however, I discovered a couple of his movies packaged with those of three other Western stars in a DVD set at a store and decided to make the five-dollar purchase.  I enjoyed the two Hopalong Cassidy movies very much and wanted to see more.  The lunch box containg DVDs of all of his movies appeared to be the best deal.  As far as Hoppy himself is concerned, he always appears to be willing to come to the aid of those asking for his help, and if one of his pals goofs in some kind of way, the stern look on Hoppy's face turns into a big smile as he's always very forgiving.  He's respected by those on both sides of the law, and he's a man with a slow drawl, but quick draw.  As a bonus, a couple of my heroes from other series (Superman's George Reeves and Charlie Chan's Sidney Toler) appear in some of the movies.  After having been mistaken for so many years, I can now say that Hopalong Cassidy has become one of my favorite Western characters.",1282780800,23,1206,4.217391304347826

3849859,3,B0025X4PPG,"Great idea packaging all 66 feature films of William Boyd as Hopalong Cassidy together in one set! Nice extra of housing them in a small reprduction metal lunchbox for that 1950's feel.
As for the films themselves, DVD reproduction is excellent as they are the same masters the Platinum Disc label (now owned by Echo Bridge Entertainment) released over a period of years in separate packages consisting of one disc containing 5 features in each, randomly chosen from the Cassidy catalog. And there's the rub!
If this set were a budget priced DVD package, I could understand, but it's not at an $80.00 list price, so why has Echo Bridge merely reproduced the Platinum Disc releases with new labels but the same format. Randomly picked films in no particular original release order?
This in my opinion would be a 5 star review if only Echo Bridge had taken the time to organize the films in their original order of theatrical release, starting from the earliest to the last productions. As it is, one has to jump around to different discs to view them that way. And I wish to! This was a big letdown for me when I received the package. So the 3 stars is strictly for the quality of the masters used on the DVD's, but it should and could have been a 5
star set!",1255219200,48,1258,4.521929824561403
3849860,3,B0025X4PPG,"Yes, all 66 Hoppy features are collected together for the first time.  Why the whacky title order on the discs?  Sadly, because the first 8 discs are identical to the previous Platinum releases.  In fact, they ARE the old Platinum discs, right down to the disc labelling (Platinum became Echo Bridge Entertainment).  As such, they suffer from the same over-compression, cramming 5 titles per single sided/single-layered disc.  Wish I could say that the ""new"" discs were any different, as they are not.  If you watch these on a standard-def TV and the screen is not too large, then they might look OK.  Otherwise, look forward to blurring and other motion artifacts.  They are quite watchable, but certainly not up to the standards seen on the Image DVD transfers.

Sadly, this will probably be the only ""complete collection"" available of the feature films.  Recommended only for big-time Hoppy fans.

As an interesting footnote....these same guys at Echo Bridge DID try to do right by some of these films by releasing a 4-disc set with only 3 films per disc about a year ago.  They looked great...no compression artifacts!  Why this step back???",1254268800,79,1145,4.9319371727748695

What would have raised my own rating from four to five stars would have been to present the movies IN THEIR CORRECT CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER instead of the pretty much random order they appear in here.  Would it really have been that much more troublesome or expensive to do that?",1254182400,11,599,4.486238532110092

3849863,5,B0025X4PPG,"This really is the first time that all 66 Hopalong Cassidy movies have been assembled into one DVD collection.  I have been trying to collect them all on DVD for a long time. 16 of the early movies were released as double features on DVD. Those are out of print and are very hard to find.  The re-mastering of the movies is great. They are a huge improvement over the VCR tapes. The sound is surprisingly good.

Please note that this collection does not include any of the 52 TV programs. You can get them at Amazon.com under ""Hopalong Cassidy: Complete Collection"".  That set has all 52 programs and 10 movies.  Amazon.com also has the 52 TV programs on two separate sets of 26 TV episodes."" Hopalong Cassidy TV Collection #1"" and ""Collection 2"".

I highly recommend this item to all fans of Hopalong Cassidy, westerns and classic film and television.",1249430400,96,852,4.6092715231788075
3849864,5,B0025X4PPG,"For some time Echo Bridge have been releasing the Hopalong Cassidy movies, 5 per disc, and at 8 volumes, 40 of the 66 movies have been released so far. As well there have been various compilations, however never before have the entire 66 movies been available in one collection. Finally it has arrived. The handy tin box actually contains two box sets, Hopalong Cassidy Vol 1, containing discs 1 to 7 of the Echo Bridge releases, and Hopalong Cassidy Vol 2, containing disc 8 plus 6 more discs, each containing 5 movies, apart from the 7th disc which contains 1 movie [therefore totalling 66 in all], plus extras, namely 3 radio shows, posters, photos, comic strips and biography. For those who already own much of the previously released material, hopefully these two 7-disc box sets may be released separately later. For those who also want the TV shows, a separate collection, misleadingly called the Complete Collection, is available. For those whose main interest is the 66 movies made between 1935 and 1948, the Ultimate Collector's Edition is a high quality, well presented and reasonably priced [at around $1 per movie]choice. As a western movie fan, this is a prized addition to my collection.",1248912000,4,1202,4.926108374384237
3849865,5,B0025X4PPG,"If all you need are the first 12 movies then I give this 1 star, as I only need the first 12. I hope some viewer out there can attest to the fact these first 12 movies are from U S Television Office. For you that don't know, U S Television Office has the master negatives from Hoppys estate. They are first rate. You have rarely seen a western this old as sharp as these prints. There are a few splices from re-releases and theater releases to complete a few of the prints but this is to be expected for films this old. If you're not a Hoppy fan, but like westerns, you'll like these shows.

8351275,5,B0025X4PPG,"The only negative about this set is the lack of having the films in the order they were released. But considering how old these films are, the sound and picture quality, in my opinion, are absolutely top-notch! I received the set in January (I think), have now watched about 1/3 of them, and just love this set. There was one movie that kept stopping at a specific point and wouldn't proceed. Finally, I remembered my old CD collection and how I solved ""skipping"" problems---a small dab of toothpaste and gentle rubbing on the (movie side of) DVD (from center to edge, not in circular), and that was the end of that problem. This is a terrific deal, I have no regrets and am totally pleased with this purchase. The character of Hoppy was ""trademarked"" by William Boyd, and I am getting a kick out of his sense of humor and deep laugh in character. An epitome of what we expect of our ""wild west"" heroes.

Echo Bridge were quite lazy in their compilation.  Having taken over the Hoppy issues they had released the above discs as 2 x 3-DVD and 2 x 4-DVD sets.  They were then reissued as 2 x 7-DVD sets.  Now for third (... and final?) time they present exactly the same discs as one 14-DVD set!  Of course, they had previously reissued all 8 of the already-5-movies Platinum DVDs (see below) with the name Echo Bridge replacing Platinum on the covers but Platinum still the name on the actual disc artwork!

But, theres more to it than that.  Originally, three companies had issued between them all 66 of the Hoppy movies.  It would seem that Echo Bridge have just recycled those.  Discs 1 and 2 contain the 10 movies originally issued by Critics Choice as a 4-DVD set.  These were not blessed with chapter/scene selection option and were Region-Free.  Discs 3, 4 and 5 plus the single movie on disc 7 make up the 16 issued as double features on 8 separate DVDs by Image Entertainment.  These all had chapter/scene selection and were copy protected with the first 4 DVDs being Region 1 only and the last 4 being Region-Free!  Finally, disc 6 and discs 8  14 inclusive were issued by Platinum Disc Corporation as 8 separate DVDs with 5 movies on each disc  40 in all.  These were all Region-Free and had chapter/scene selection.  The titles and artwork on each Platinum disc are the same as those on the Echo Bridge issue (see above)!

To recap, the Image Entertainment and Critics' Choice DVDs have been condensed into 5-movies-a-disc presentation with the Platinum discs being kept exactly as they were ... even down to their catalogue (sorry, I mean ""catalog"" - I'm English!) number and the logo appearing in the introduction.  Echo Bridge have now also made everything playable on Region One only.

The films (movies) were released in the following years:
1  3:  1935
4  8:  1936
9  14:  1937
15  21:  1938
22  26:  1939
27  31:  1940
32  41:  1941
42  44:  1942
45  51:  1943
52  54:  1944
55:  1946
56  60:  1947
61  66:  1948
No movies were made in 1945 with The Devils Playground (# 55) being released in late 1946.  This was the first produced under William Boyds personal umbrella once the main studios had decided to make no more Hoppy movies (Boo, hiss, shame!  I hear the fans shouting).

Incidentally, Lost Canyon recycles the same story line as Rustlers Valley; Wide Open Town uses the plot from Hopalong Cassidy Returns while Stick to Your Guns is a retread of Bar 20 Rides Again.

The first radio episode was broadcast 1st January 1950 with 104 altogether.  The first twelve TV episodes screened were merely the last twelve movies cut down for 30-minute slots with linking narration recorded by William Boyd.  The first of 40 made for TV selections was broadcast on September 1952 (making a total of 52 TV episodes).

Cobb and Robert Mitchum are interesting and the sidekicks, such as Gabby Hayes are very entertaining and interesting.  As a western gun slinging hero, Hoppy stand by himself because he regularly laughs and smiles as well as all the  other western stuff we have learned to expect.

The single substantive drawback to this item is the you are forced to watch the commercial ID material again and again.  I could live well without ever seeing this inter-feature material ever again.
