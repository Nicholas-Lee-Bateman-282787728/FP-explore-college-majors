3764750,3,B001QFFBCU,"A human tragedy set in the old west. This movie is interesting, moves quickly in most places, and reminds us all of the futility of harboring hate and revenge for a lifetime. There are at least 3 of the 7 deadly sins at work in this film. Kick back and enjoy it some rainy afternoon for what it is....entertaining and thought provoking.",1240963200,14,336,4.435483870967742
3764751,1,B001QFFBCU,"I gave this movie about 20 minutes and I'm sorry I did.
The Blu-Ray disc didn't have anything on it except ""play movie,"" not even a menu for extras or set-up.
When I saw the makeup on the guy who was supposed to have been beaten within an inch of his life, I laughed. His face was covered in rough and he looked like a drag queen.
This movie is a complete waste of anyone's time.",1240185600,4,379,4.0
3764752,1,B001QFFBCU,"I have to have my occasional fix of the western genre. I love a good one, the last being 3:10 to Yuma. This movie however is just bad. The acting is terrible, the daughter is like a valley girl, the sheriff is awful, the indian girl? The costumes are weird and the music dosent make any sense. There are so many technical things, cameras in the background, wristwatch lines it is laughable. I am sorry-do not buy this movie.",1239926400,5,424,4.379746835443038
3764753,1,B001QFFBCU,"I tried valiantly in hoping this Blu Ray would be up to some standard since customers are looking for those elusive great (or even good) westerns. This failed in every category.

The video quality had a used VHS feel to it. There was artifact, grain and pixels throughout. The sound had crackling at times, and registered no more than 2.0. There are no chapter stops, no menus, nothing.

The story of retribution, unhealed Civil War wounds and the need for gunfights were not lost here, but I think everything else was. Technically, this was a disaster. Within the first 20 minutes, there were so many guffaws, flubs and horrible writing that I wanted to quit, but I didn't. In one kitchen scene, I looked at the reflection of the entire boom mic guy for a good three minutes (kudos to the guy in the red shirt & white hair holding the microphone- you had the best acting). The gunfights were so bad, they did not even try to show the slightest recoil with any of the guns, then once I saw the fifth wristwatch tan line (very obvious because they made a point of doing closeups) I just gave up.

This movie company is advertising for us to buy more of these unreturnable 3DVD/1 BluRay packages (as this one was) for their next three movies in April, but I have learned my lesson and will not be ordering.",1238457600,,1304,4.470588235294118
3764754,1,B001QFFBCU,"I couldn't believe how awful this was.  I got it at Wal-Mart for $3.74.  What a rip off!  I invested about 10 minutes in it, including some fast forwarding.  It is absolutely unbearable.  And at times the picture was so blurry you wondered what could possible have caused that other than a $25 video tape camera from 1975 that the producer bought on eBay.  Just bad, bad, bad.  No one can act.  No one is familiar.  Nothing makes any sense.  Ugh!",1482451200,,446,4.395061728395062

3764761,1,B001QFFBCU,"First of all, the dvd was damaged to the extend that it was almost unwatchable.  I did manage to see a few short scenes, but found the combined flaws of bad acting and unrealistic depictions of action, and exceptional bad writing to be more than I could endure.  I originally bought this dvd because it got a ""rave"" of sorts on CBS Sunday Morning, a program that I respect, and I am still confused by their endorsement of this film.  I never really understood the conflicts in this film since the damaged dvd rarely gave me enough information to form an opinion.",1472688000,,562,4.490196078431373

3764763,5,B001QFFBCU,"Thank you. No excessive narcissistic pro surfer adverts here. A true bodysurfing film which I expect we will see more of in the future. This is what a any Surf film could or should be. If one knows the bodysurfing community as these folks  seem to , and have the resources then they need to be generous in giving attention to the geography, which they were. In this case there was respect in listing regions while respecting local sites. If one is really interested they can go beyond the beauty of the photography and learn from the the skills these folks display. The insight into the various regions shows the coast and kinds of waves that are exceptional for bodysurfing. Motivational indeed.",1450051200,,696,4.704918032786885

3764770,5,B001QFFBCU,"A lot of  it is very nicely shot and the music's great. Excellent father-son sidestory at Makapu'u with beautiful images. One story about a river ""wave"" rider was really stretching it. It  was interesting, but that's not bodysurfing. That time could have been used to show another bodysurfing story or location. The movie showed a few of the good locations, but really, no Waimea, no Pipeline, no Sandy Beach?!!? And no outer islands? No descriptions  of the different  styles of bodysurfing or what the sensation of bodysurfing is like? The Wedge needs to be shown when it's REALLY BIG. A little too low key for me. There's a more complete film waiting to be made, but this is a very good first out.",1421020800,,700,4.666666666666667

3764772,5,B001QFFBCU,"This film brings to life my first passion, body surfing, with incredibly good shots of some top notch body surfing by the best. The Wedge is my favorite, don't miss the Bonus features where a lot more scenes of it live. The film captures my feelings and passion; to those of us who love it, body surfing is the purest and most natural of all sports. Shorts and fins, with maybe a good retainer strap for the fins (I invented my own, far superior, I might add, to those on the market)are all you need.

And on the right day, you don't even need the fins to catch some decent waves.

It also made me aware of many great techniques I was not previously aware of, having taught myself.  Seeing such incredibly good action in slow motion, by so many different surfers, has given me new insights that I cannot wait to work on.

The only request I would have is, yes, make it longer!",1409443200,,876,4.290909090909091
3764773,5,B001QFFBCU,"I bought this DVD based off of my love for the Malloys after seeing 180 Degrees South. Although this documentary does not have the substance or the storyline of 180 Degrees South, it matches it if not exceeds it as far as visualization and music. I watched it immediately after buying it and was instantly put in a trance. When it was over (too soon, not the longest documentary) I took it over to one of my friends house and we watched it with the same results. Since then, I've been to parties where people put it on as background music, and almost everyone got sucked in to watch all of the different imagery of the ocean, the body surfers, and the beach. It's extremely captivating. I'd recommend it to anyone that liked 180 Degrees South, likes surfing, or just likes beautiful imagery and a kickass soundtrack.",1397088000,,816,4.557823129251701

This film shows that same attitude, and shows the abilities of some REALLY good body surfers.  I was a Wedge local during the 60s, and have seen great body surfing, and can say that Mark Cunningham is in a different universe from the rest of us when it comes to his ability and experience.

3764783,5,B001QFFBCU,Fantastic. Very well made. The feel of the film captures the nature of bodysurfing. Could have watched 2hrs---I wish they had made this full length. Only other criticism is I would have liked to have seen more shots of rides that were long rather than so much cutting between shorter segments.

All terrific guys and at the leading edge of their sport/art.  This movie was beautifully shot in 16 mm in a way that shows the dedication and skill of these guys/gals, and the incredible beauty of these places.  The segment with Don King and his son was touching in a way that you never really see in this genre of film.  Great edition to our library - enjoy!",1365120000,,506,4.651685393258427

To my disappointment, the movie included alot of rehashing of the same bodysurfing scenes/stories as those previous movies, only not as well done. I just couldn't get into/hyped about it.

My recommendation, watch ""Brokedown Melody"" and read the classic Robert Gardner's The Art of Body Surfing. Skip this one.",1364169600,2,436,5.228571428571429

Since it's theater release in September of 2011, it's been kicking its fins around, begging to be watched.

Almost a year later, all I can say is...

I wish I'd listened to its pleas sooner!

""Come Hell or High Water"" is artfully produced, shaping stories of bodysurfing pioneers with captivating imagery and a soulful soundtrack.

Keith Mallory, masterfully strips bodysurfing down to its core. Communicating an inspiring ""Ode to the Ocean,"" thru the action sport.

Only 1 other surf film has ever left such a powerful impression upon me, ""Step into Liquid"" directed by Dana Brown in 2003.

Now it's 9 years later and here I was sitting on my couch literally twisting and turning as Mike Stewart ""breakdances"" thru barrels at Point Panic.  And feeling the amp run thru my veins as legend, Mark Cunningham, glides thru the big waves of Tahiti, like a superhero.

As the movie came to a close and the film credits began to roll (a time when typically you question whether you just wasted 2 hours of your life) I felt Stoked and Inspired.

""Come Hell or High Water"" AKA In Spite Of All Obstacles, Bodysurfing will Persist!
