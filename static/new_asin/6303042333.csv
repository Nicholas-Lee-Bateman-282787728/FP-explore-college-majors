8218032,3,6303042333,"THE CORRECT TITLE OF THIS FILM IS ""A PISTOL FOR RINGO"". I'M SURE BECAUSE I HAVE THE ORIGINAL ITALIAN SOUNDTRACK WHICH HAS ALL OF THE FILM'S MUSIC + PHOTOS FROM THE FILM & A STORY SYNOPSIS TOO! NOT SURE WHY IT WAS RE-TITLED ""BALLAD OF DEATH VALLEY"", AS THE FILM'S SETTING IS IN A LUSH VALLEY WITH MOUNTAINS & THAT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE TO WHAT THE REAL DEATH VALLEY LOOKS LIKE! FILM IS ABOUT SOME REAL DUMB MEXICAN BANDIDOS WHO CROSS OVER THE RIO GRANDE RIVER TO ROB A BANK. AFTER THE ROBBERY, THE LEADER IS WOUNDED, SO HE DECIDES TO HOLD-OUT AT A LAVISH RANCH WITH HIS GANG. THE SHERRIF FOLLOWS HIM & SURROUNDS THE RANCH, SO THE BANDIT'S LEADER STARTS SHOOTING TWO WORKERS PER DAY UNTIL HE'S ALLOWED TO LEAVE. LOTS OF SUB-PLOTS & ROMANCES INCLUDING THE BANDIT'S 'WOMAN' & 'RUBY', THE SHERRIF'S GIRLFRIEND. RINGO IS LET OUT OF THE SHERRIF'S JAIL & SENT TO OUT SMART THE BANDITS, WHICH HE DOES & IS ALLOWED TO ESCAPE WITH PART OF THE BANK'S MONEY AS HIS REWARD! IN THE SEQUEL; ""THE RETURN OF RINGO"", HE RETURNS TO WOO RUBY AGAIN. THIS FILM CONTAINS LOTS OF ACTION WITH A FEW LAUGHS TOO!",1175472000,,1079,4.346534653465347
8218033,5,6303042333,"I came from Hong Kong and now live in Maryland, USA. I have watched all Montgomery Wood or Giuliano Gemma 's movies. The way he fight is very similar to today's Jackie Chan. However, the most impressive movie I have watched is Sons of Thunder during the mid 60s. I found this movie's poster in ebay's auction. The one who offer this poster is from England. Is there anybody inform me where to buy this movie? I try to search it in Giuliano Gemma's offical web site. There is no such movie in the data base. May be this movie is under different name in different countries! My email address is chunlukk@aol.com",985478400,3,609,4.446428571428571
