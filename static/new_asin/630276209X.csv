508027,5,630276209X,"A lot of ink has already flown over the apparently enigmatic movie `Teorema' shot by Pier Paolo Pasolini. Hereafter my own interpretation in the light of his whole work.

Pier Paolo Pasolini's curse
As he explained in his book `Amado Mio - Atti Impuri', P.P. Pasolini's lifelong curse was the sexual attraction of ephebes.
This curse was a Christian one.
Homosexual relations between an older man and an adolescent were considered to be totally natural in ancient times (Sparta, Marcus Aurelius, Theocritus) before Christianity became the dominant, totalitarian religion, with its morality holding on that procreation was the only goal of sexual intercourse. The Christian Churches considered also that the family nucleus was the best means to propagate its own religious faith from the parents to the children.

This curse was also a bourgeois one.
Promiscuity was rampant among the majority of the population (the lower classes which possessed nothing) and the nobility (except for the legal spouses, because within the ruling classes the fatherhood had to be assured). The bourgeois class crept out of the mud of the lower classes and adopted the family policy of the Christian Churches. The wealth gathered by lifelong hard toiling had to be preserved within the family. For those whose sexual (promiscuous) drive was too strong, there were the brothels exploited by the Churches (E.J. Burford).

Pasolini's gospel: free sexuality
`Teorema' is a plea for free sexuality, personified in the main character of the movie played by Terence Stamp. He has sexual intercourse with everybody: young and old, male and female, the lower and the middle classes. This free sexuality shatters the family nucleus and shakes fundamentally the behavior of its members. It fully undermines the Christian bourgeois morality, which stands in the way of people wanting to live fully their own sexuality. But, before it can be implemented, a community has to go through the desert.
P. P. Pasolini didn't foresee that between the 1960s and now, the Christian and the bourgeois mentality and morality would nearly totally disappear. People now can change partners as easy as they can change their shirts. Only children are legally protected.
In `Comizi d'amore' (1964) Pier Paolo Pasolini was openly insulted to be a disgusting individual (by people who didn't know his sexual preference).

And what about Pasolini's communism?
In the beginning of the movie, an entrepreneur gives his plant freely away to his workforce. But, one of the workers says that this is not enough: one should also get rid of bourgeois morals. One should not forget that after the Bolshevik revolution in the USSR `free love associations' became a norm (not for long) under the advocacy of Alexandra Kollontai.

Although sexual morals have substantially changed since the shooting of this movie, its bold treatment of human sexuality is still unsettling.
Not to be missed.",1376179200,,2929,5.223404255319149
508028,3,630276209X,"Having just watched this for the first time since it first appeared in movie theaters, I remain as confused by it as I was way back when ! We never really know what Pasolini's theorem is.
The basic plot is simple. A stranger becomes the guest of a wealthy Milanese family. Is he really a stranger ? At one point he says to the son, ""This used to be my room when I was young."" He sleeps with the various household members, father, mother, son, daughter and maid ! At first the experience seems to be liberating for them, but the household ultimately goes crazy in various ways when the stranger leaves. The son becomes an experimental artist, never satisfied with his work eventually losing it completely, the daughter lapses into a comatose state, the mother takes to picking up late teen/twenty-something boys, the maid takes to performing miracles, the father strips naked in the Milan Railway Station and runs screaming through a desert type area as the sands of time flow by. There are some very unclear political and religious messages here.
""Enigma"" would have been a better title than THEOREM.
The most telling moment in the film occurs after the maid has moved on to her sainthood, and a new maid has been hired. The daughter comes in to the kitchen asking for something, she calls the new maid by the old maid's name. It clearly doesn't register on her that a different person is standing there.
The actors are well chosen. Terrance Stamp as the stranger, Silvana Mangano as the mother, join Pasolini regulars Massimo Girotti (Father), Laura Betti (Maid) and Ninetto Davoli as a kind of postman/messenger.
It is intriguing, clumsy and amateurish, a little boring and also fascinating !",1372032000,3,1694,4.76530612244898

Into the home of a bourgeois family walks in Terence Stamp (the embodiment of a modern Don Givanni), a stranger. each one of the family - mother, father, daughter, son and maid finds in the stranger an exit door for the fullfilment of their hidden passions and repressed vices within the boundaries of the family structure; and this stranger works out as the perfect catalyst for this purpose.

508065,5,630276209X,"It is like the sequel of Pasolini's ""Gospel According to Saint Matthew"". It is a direct transposition of that young man who is bringing love to the world in the class-struggle-ridden city of Milano. If love came to a bourgeois family what would happen?

The mother would discover what she has never experienced and she would become an insatiable love seeking, we mean of course sex chasing, woman picking young students in the streets, male of course, to have a quick experience no matter where, no matter how, provided it is quick and complete.

The daughter would just get catatonic after the discovery of that physical love she did not know before and she can't imagine with anyone else after having had that relation with the angel of love, the archangel Gabriel of course. She will end up being taken away to some institution.

The son will have discovered the love he was looking for but that makes him different and he does not want to be different, so he will just promote his difference to the status of art and he will start painting beautiful abstract things with no resemblance to anything at all, in one word his own desire for the forbidden in society but a dream that is allowed by that angel of love, the archangel Gabriel of course.

The maid will start eating stinging nettles and making miracles, floating in mid air over the roof and being worshipped as a saint able to deliver te cure to all evils. And that will have to stop one day and on that day she will have herself buried in some kind of building site to disappear in her own tears under tower blocks.

Finally the father will be the one who shows the way to salvation. He will get rid of his factory and will give it to the workers. The class struggle will win and the workers will be able to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat, a hammer and a sickle, or vice versa in Italy. And then he will be able to answer the call of some young male well endowed angel and to undress in Milano's main train station, get rid of all superficial appearances and finally follow his angel of love into the desert, yes the desert, because that's all there is for the bourgeoisie and then he will realize his mistake, he will realize one must never yield to class struggle because it is an impasse, but all the same the command of Jesus to the rich to get rid of their riches and distribute them to the poor and then follow him is a blind alley, an alley for the blind, an alley that leads nowhere at all except perdition.

Just like Jesus brought love to Jerusalem and ended up on the cross, betrayed by his own disciple, capitalism is an impasse but negating capitalism is another impasse. There is no way out of that vision of society cut in too without any love.

And that's why the film has aged tremendously. Class struggle or even social war, liberation wars that end up in pure terrorism, the belief that the world can be cut in two antagonistic halves lead to nowhere. It is a myth, it is a dream, not even a utopia because it does not bring liberation but it brings totalitarianism, dictatorship, terrorism, including the civilized terrorism of that new age theory that society is a set of interconnected networks and it is enough to drop a stone, or a bomb, in one nodal point to paralyze the whole system, like blocking the flow of gas and diesel, to bring society dons on its knees in about four weeks.

The four weeks that are supposed to shake the world and end up in failure and blood or frustration like with the Tamil Tigers, the FARCs, Ben Laden, the ETA in Basque country, and all other pirates in the world. The world is not divided in two antagonistic halves. To believe that is to lead everyone to the desert, the absolute waterless, cool-less, food-less desert and not for forty days but forever and ever. By the way that vision of Jesus and Christendom is absolutely old fashioned, pass, dead.

Pasolini's message in 1968 was absolutely dramatic and realistically pessimistic. How could anyone believe the extreme communistic, Trotskyite, anarchistic movements were going to try to take over and some will support that, not seeing it is pure feudalism and these new heroes are nothing but war lords. And when they try to behave like professional trade-union leaders they become amateurish generals of social war, class against class.

508067,5,630276209X,"n the film TEOREMA, in a final scene, we see the maid, Emilia, suspended in the sky above the casina-- a row of farmhouses. The image smacks of Fellini's imagine of the Virgin Mary at the beginning of the film LA DOLCE VIDA (1968): the Virgin statue hangs in the sky above Roman rooftops as a helicopter transports it over the crowded suburbs. Peasant vs. bourgeoise. Country vs. city. The sound of church bells vs. the noise of a helicopter engine. In both cases elevation of a woman, in both cases funny, in both cases not an intellectual question but rather a visual joke asking for the audience's gut reaction. Like, ""what's going on?"" The image breaks the narrative. In Fellini's case setting up what is to follow; in Pasolini's case, closing off what has already occurred.

I don't know why I missed seeing  Pasolini's Teorama (Italian word that translates `spectacle') earlier in my film viewing life. It's a moody film requiring the viewer to fill in the blanks, and there are plenty of masterful blanks, both visual and spiritual, in the sexual-coming-apart of a wealthy Milanese family.

The wife (Silvana Mangano) is exquisite; she wears a Sassoon haircut, designer dresses, and never removes her make-up. Her eyes are dark almonds painted on a furrow-free porcelain face.

The soundtrack: silence, morning doves, birds, church bells, sirens.

Hip Brit actor, Terrence Stamp, plays god--some critics say he is the devil. His arrival is in Milan is simply introduced by a letter which arrives while the family is dining: Guest arrives tomorrow.

The next thing you know. The guest has been there. He's seduced the maid and is now in the bedroom with the son. Stamp is not a predatory character, but a force each family member is absorbed by, as if they are thirsty plants and he is water.

If you love 60s films, Pasolini, or Italy don't miss this one. Beautiful, fog laden scenes of the family modern country house let you se how the Italian nobility live. The family's palazzo in the city is surrounded by what starts out as a greedy expanse of grounds that slowly shrinks as the film progresses, moving the palazzo closer to the street-- a pedestrian street. The shrinking coincides with the father's giving away his factory and refers back to the film's first statement: ""The existence of a middle class prevents a worker revolution."" (Things are too cushy and everyone aspires to middle class.)

Each of the Milanese family member's encounter with the guest, transforms them. After the guest leaves, the once-uptight wife drives around in her high-fashion outfits looking for young men that resemble the guest: she looks for false gods?  The daughter becomes catatonic, but assumes the rapture of orgasm on her face: blown away by god's intensity; no one will be as good?  The son becomes an artist: having been touched by the divine, he reached the depths of his sensitive soul?  The husband gives away his factory and has sex with everyone and anyone: life is meaningless without god? Emilia, the maid, floats above the countryside and inspires her fellow peasants: god is not dead?

The reason Terrence Stamp character is god and not the devil?  He is the male version of the maid: blue eyes, brown hair, same facial expressions, same color clothing. He inspires, transforms, and inspires awe.",1227484800,4,3311,4.880570409982175
508068,5,630276209X,"Through gorgeous cinematography and a bold symbolic language that makes it very difficult to take the film literally, Pasolini investigates the hollowness of bourgeois life. The film may be difficult for those expecting either a straightforward narrative or a 'deep' avant-garde experience: by resisting those boundaries Pasolini created a film that is both hilarious and haunting, dealing frankly with sex in a way that is impossible to ignore but difficult to take seriously. My advice to anyone watching this film would be to just let it do its work. This is a remarkable piece of filmmaking, and as such will be denounced by those who desire easy categorization. It is joyful, sad, ridiculous, political, and almost religious despite Pasolini's atheism. By letting the unexplainable remain unexplained, Pasolini created a powerful film that really gets under the viewer's skin(as evidenced by the extreme polarization it causes). An absolute masterpiece!",1218326400,2,958,5.47972972972973
508119,5,630276209X,"..Proving theorems is a central activity of mathematicians. Note that ""theorem"" is distinct from ""theory"". (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

Pier Paolo Pasolini's ""Teorema"" (1968) is a fable that tells how a handsome young man (extremely attractive Terrence Stamp ""with the eyes of an angel and the grin of the devil"") stays as a guest in the house of a wealthy factory owner and seduces one after another all members of the household - the maid, the teenagers son and daughter, the wife, and the father (in this order). When released in 1968, the film had divided believers and atheists as much as critics. Some of Pasolini's comrades-Marxists were also infuriated by this attack on their ideology. Many viewers were disturbed by its removing sexual taboos even though sex is handled very tastefully. It is more a symbol of connection and closeness to God (or it could be to Devil, we may only guess). Made almost forty years ago, ""Teorema"" seems to be simple and puzzling at the same time. It reminded me Ingmar Bergman's movies from his ""Trilogy of Faith"" which sums up Bergman's own philosophy regarding religion and God - ""God has never spoken because He does not exist"". In Bergman's world where God does not exist, communication and understanding are not possible and everyone is locked in their loneliness like in a cage. In Pasolini's film, God sends his angel to a chosen family. He has spoken to them and known them but then he left them. Did they become happier? Is that possible for a human to keep on living like nothing happen after the encounter with God?

I watched ""Teorema"" for the first time few weeks ago but I still think about it trying to understand what ""theorem"" Pasolini tried to prove? I also was thinking about the films that were inspired by or reminded me a lot about ""Teorema"". I've mentioned Bergman already. Luis Bunuel with ""Nazarin"", ""Viridiana"","" Belle de jour"" (1967) - the mother's transformation in ""Teorema"" reminds about the film immediately, and ""Le Charme discret de la bourgeoisie""(1972) come to mind. I was also reminded of Andrei Tarkovsky. The visual style, camera work and the use of music in ""Teorema"" seem similar with Russian Master's. His last film, ""Sacrifice"" may be the one closest to Pasolini's film.

I would never say that everyone must watch ""Teorema"". It is a very unusual film that could be easily dismissed as ridiculous and dated or it would be thought of as absolutely brilliant and mysterious. I have not decided yet but I can't forget it.

P.S. April 7, 2007 - It's been several months since I saw ""Teorema"" and now I believe that it is brilliant and belongs to the the best films ever made. One can meditate forever on its depths and mystery, and that's the sign of a great work of Art for me.",1175904000,28,2768,4.748440748440748

That DVD is excellent in its quality but clearly I was interested in English subtitles.  I am not really requesting a refund I sat through the film and now know what the story is but I was surprised that Amazon could allow such a defective product to be sent in the first place.

I saw the movie about 25 years ago in a theater (with subtitles), so I certainly got the gist. I wish someone would put out a subtitled edition.",1485043200,,258,4.285714285714286

7830658,5,630276209X,Despite it's slightly lurid approach this is the finest illustration in film of the false turns on the road to an awakened life I know. Only one makes it through and even then it's to a not very comfortable place,1478908800,,212,4.325

7830661,2,630276209X,"What you get out of Teorema will largely be based on your appreciation of it as art and how it challenged in its time. Teorema is more film-based art than an art house film (which I often rate up). As a film, I found Teorema to be tedious and unnatural / contrived and rate it down. Could easily see a contemporary art lover going the opposite way and rating it up.",1444262400,,365,4.154929577464789

I don't even know where to start. It's such a good film. You have to see it to believe it. It's good, good, better than good. Hail, Pasolini! Why are films so boring nowadays",1444176000,,179,4.142857142857143
