8712809,3,B00WBJSNNE,"Faith of My Fathers is good but not the best type of film I've seen.  Good use of flash-backs/scenes.  I wish it would have updated us on who McCain became . . . but that's not necessary and the film was made several years ago.

The Fog of War came off as childish and unprofessional to me in the narrator's voice, namely the male questioner.  His voice tone came off as mad, rude, frustrated, and I found that to be almost anarchistic-sounding?  Perhaps that's just me.

I've already seen the last movie, and I recommend Hamburger Hill and Apocalypse Now as Vietnam-era movies before this one.  It's okay.",1506124800,,606,4.555555555555555
8712810,5,B00WBJSNNE,Fog of War: one of the best documentaries I have seen.  I had missed the beginning when it was on PBS years ago and since I could not find it in the public library was waiting for years for a decent price to buy it - highly recommended.  (I have not seen the other two movies.),1498003200,,277,3.9285714285714284

8712812,5,B00WBJSNNE,"I bought this specifically for The Fog of War which is a fantastic documentary unto itself. I'm sure the other movies are okay, but I'm not in any rush to watch them. I would have paid this price just to get The Fog of War by itself!",1484092800,7,233,3.978723404255319
