2596147,5,B000G0O5J6,"Although, season 2 of The Flying Nun was not as warm and a bit more slapstick-ish than season 1, it is still a treat to watch. The picture quality is excellent as well as the sound.

I didn't become acquainted with this show until it went into syndication in 1970 because I was only in early grade school when it ended, then didn't hang around long after that.  But I became reaquainted when USA aired the reruns in the mid 80's, then another cable channel did the same in the mid-90's.  TVLand also aired it briefly and irregularly a couple years ago.

But thankfully Sony had the inspiration to release The Flying Nun on DVD so a new generation can fall in love with the cute (albeit far-fetched)adventures of Sister Bertrille and the rest of the Convent San Tanco.",1159142400,5,767,4.496402877697841
2596148,5,B000G0O5J6,"I haven't seen The Flying Nun since it as aired in the late sixties.  Once I started watching both Seasons 1 and 2, I couldn't stop.  Good, clean, quality humour.",1158624000,6,162,4.366666666666666
2596149,5,B000G0O5J6,"How refreshing its been to escape back to the late 1960's childhood days with Sr. Bertrille and friends, at the Convent San Tanco. They will welcome you in with laughs and touching stories! This season 2, the colors seem more vivid, they had more scenes in the Convent garden with vibrant colored flowers. The characters and guest appearances are very slap stick, so corny they are funny. One scene has Sr Bertrille and Sr Jaquline on a vacation, in bathing suits by the hotel pool.  The cases of the DVD's have some nice old BW pictures from the show on the inside case and the outside have very colorful pictures, one has a group picture of the Sisters when they tried the new modified habit in blue with dresses to their knees from season 3. They looked like flight attendants! I hope Sony will complete the series with season 3, they have done a nice job.",1155772800,7,859,4.506410256410256
2596150,5,B000G0O5J6,"I am very excited they are putting out season two.... so many older tv shows only have ""The Best Of"" or only the first season, ignoring the the second third and so on years. It usually takes a first season to fully establish and develop  the charactors and situations so  the general public can really get the feeling of the whole ""lives' of  what these people are about and really get into  the show.
The Flying Nun is a very enjoyable fantasy 60s tv show to watch. I haven't seen season two since I was a teenager, but if it is anything like season one, spunky  free spirited Sister Bertrille always  the humanitarian who was  trying to do the good for the poor people of SanTanco, but somehow always getting herself into trouble. Sister Jaqueline and Sixto were her supporters and tried to protect her when  the Reverand Mother got so exasperated and beside herself with Bertilles latest antics. The handsome playboy Carlos Rameriz who admired her from afar was always bailing her out when she was over her head in the next tangled mess she got herself into. ( they seemed to bump into each other accidently or not with alarming frequency!!! )
I hope they bring out season 3 soon. It would also be fun if they made a  movie  of it to for the big screen. They could get away now with a lot more then they did back then
As a side note; It is wonderful to see the acting and comedic talent of  the late Alejandro Rey  Who's life was tragically cut way too short.

Post script;8-17-06

I finally got the second season set... and it is such a joy to watch!  Better than the first year... though I like season one very much too!
 The characters are far more developed, writing is clever, sometimes a bit slap stick with new cast member Captain Formento being a complete bufoon and clutz, but it is  very funny.
 I especially like the episode when Reverend Mother and Sister Bertrille are hypnotised and switch personalities, and the always amusing complex feelings  Carlos had for Bertrille with their love hate friendship and chemistry is very fun to watch.
Everything  about this light hearted fun show gells so nicely. It is a pure delight. I give it an A+.

Buy it, You won't be sorry",1151020800,16,2185,4.481012658227848
2596151,4,B000G0O5J6,"Season Two of THE FLYING NUN continues the adventures of Convent San Tanco's airborne novice Sister Bertrille (played by Sally Field).  Following the enormous acclaim and popularity of Season One, the basic formula for the show remained unchanged, with Bertrille leading the charge on harebrained adventures that would almost certainly culminate in playboy Carlos Ramirez coming to the rescue.

Sally Field buoys the series nicely and the supporting cast of Madeleine Sherwood (as Reverend Mother Plaseato), Marge Redmond (Sister Jacqueline), Shelley Morrison (Sister Sixto) and Alejandro Rey (Carlos) all deliver handsomely too.

THE FLYING NUN would stay airborne for another season before coming to a natural end.  Let's hope the third and final season is released soon.

2596177,5,B000G0O5J6,"If anyone likes Sally Field in her work in TV series throughout her life,will also like how she sings and does a tremendously serious part of actually playing a Flying Nun. I'd say Sally Field should be greatly honored now in her life for playing this role. She's played many important roles all the rest of her life. I think she was a very brave actress to be harnessed in the formal Mary Martin Peter Pan flying harness. To be flying with wires and a Peter Pan harness I think is a challenging skill and she should have been respected for her performances in this TV show The Flying Nun. I say she should be commended for this formal work that she did when she was young. I recommend this TV series for customers who like family friendly TV.Sincerely: Tim Kemp",1341792000,,762,4.411347517730497

The magic of the flying is not done very profesional if we compare it with the miracles in Bewitched, you can clearly see it's fake, but this is not bother, the stories are funny. If i watch a Bewitched or The Lucy Show i hardly can stop watching, so not with the Flying Nun.

The show encourages humor, creativity, and the idea that any problem can be solved with the Flying Nun and the help of a few friends.

2596201,4,B000G0O5J6,"For some of the lightest, most innocuous entertainment, check out The Flying Nun.  The convent San Tanco in Puerto Rico, is an almost idyllic place, virtually devoid of violence, anger, and crime, where a mean spirited word is almost never heard.  Sister Bertrille (Sally Field), and the other nuns encounter bumps in life, but they are almost always gentle ones, overcome without too much fuss.  The inspired and goofy premise that powerful wind gusts acting on Bertrille's cornet, would cause the lightweight nun to defy gravity and take flight, is the element that helps make the series memorable.  Special effects are a small, but critical element, mostly involving people suspended on wires, but there are a few breathtaking `flight' sequences as well.  Executive producer Harry Ackerman had a long history in family TV, including Bewitched, which featured a good deal of special effects.  Ackerman and Field had previously worked together on the TV version of Gidget.

The same cast returns for the second season.  Sister Jacqueline (Marge Redmond) is the leader of the sisters, and often runs interference for Sister Bertrille.  The Reverend Mother (Madeline Sherwood) balances morality and practicality, and shows great wisdom and patience in dealing with a most unusual nun.  Perky Sister Sixto (Shelly Morrison) continues to amuse, in butchering the English language.  Carlos (Alejandro Rey) is the most harmless of `playboys', and the most beneficent of casino operators, and can always be counted on for assistance.  Versatile Vitto Scotti joins the cast as a semi-regular, playing the local policeman.

The Flying Nun is a sweet and innocent slice from the past.  Too good to be true even then, it may still give cause to reflect on how much times have changed.",1201910400,2,1774,5.178947368421053

Some of the storylines and gags began to repeat and it's not hard to see why the series lasted only another season after.  Guess there's only so much to be done with the plot line of a nun that flies.  Nevertheless, it's another wonderful jaunt down the Screen Gems lane.  Incidently, it's amazing to see how much 60s television, especially for ABC, was made by Screen Gems.  How many times can the same prop or set be used for a different show?

As there were ONLY 3 Seasons of this show made, I'm sure that all 3 Seasons of 'The Flying Nun' can be made available in a boxed set at a very affordable price, even with subtitles and the extras that came with earlier release/s.
