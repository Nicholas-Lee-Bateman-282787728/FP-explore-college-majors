8641185,2,B006N5OZUM,"Ok, so let's start with this statement on my behalf...I currently own somewhere in the order of 500 M.A. movies, ranging different genres, styles, eras, and stars, and that being said, this movie is in no way the worst of them, but it's still pretty weak...
CAST:
Wang Bao Qiang: Lead
Michelle Yip Suen: Romantic Interest
Tse Miu: Rival/Antagonist
Ng Man Tat: Father
Wong Yat Fei: Comedic Fat guy...
Kara Hui: Romantic Lead's Mother
Norman Chu Siu Keung: Coach
Directed By: John Ching Tung...

SYNAPSIS:
The main character (Wang Bao Qiang) enters into the movie by promptly getting his ass kicked (By Tse Miu) before we even know who either character is, or what either of them have to do with the girl in the frame (Michelle Yip Suen). With that schizophrantic entrance that posses for an opening you quickly if unknowingly have just tasted the flavor of filmmaking this movie has to offer... To be fair though, they do explain a moment later, it seems that our hero just arrived in hong kong after an extended stay in the U.S. where he was studing boxing, almost immediately after leaving the airport however he is swindled by a woman who steals his phone and luggage. Our hero then, for some reason despite the fact that both women are wearing completly different clothing, and that he approached our female lead from behind so as to be unable to identify her...grabs her, which prompts Tse Miu to kung fu his way into action and kick the shit out of our hero.
Ok...so that's the opening, alright I suppose... let's keep going...Our hero wanders for a while with no phone and no money, meanwhile. in another section of the movie... Our Fat comedic influence for the film (Wong Yat Fei) is searching for our hero as he's supposed to pick him up, it turns out that Wong is associates with our hero's father (Ng Man Tat) and he's supposed to pick him up from the airport, the only problem? all Uncle Wong Knows is that the main character's name is Danny, and that he's coming from america, this leads to a delightful missunderstanding where Uncle Wong instead picks up a 6' tall african american fellow, who just so happens to be named Danny, and is coming from the U.S., I know right!!! wacky!!!... This encounter leads to a whole bunch of stupid (and possibly mildly racist, I'm not sure if the fact that the characters keep refering to ""Danny"" as dark chacolate is offensive or not...) jokes and stunts that leave our African american friend scolded all over his body not once, but twice...again wacky!!!
But back to our hero, as it happens, he ends up in a tea shop run by Michelle and her mother (played by veteran Shaw Brother Actress Kara Hui!), who after some convincing on his part not only wins them both over, but even lands a sleepover at thier apartment for the night. BUT WAIT! what about Tse Miu? how will he take this?! GUESS! He's pissed and confused, because of course he's in love with Michelle and blah blah blah... you've seen this halfassed love sub plot a bunch of times. Boy who's been friends with girl for years but never told her is pissed when she spends time with puppy dog new Boy, this pisses off  Boy A, he wants revenge on puppy boy, this makes girl angry, she falls in love with puppy boy, thank you 16 canadles...
But on to the kung fu right? kind of I guess... So guess what? it turns out the main character comes from a long line of Choy Lee Fut practitioners, and his father owns a C.L.F. school that's been in thier family for generations, and has decided to make out hero the head of the school, despite being a boxer with no kung fu skills...After that it's just a bad mix of training, high school puppy love, angry challenges, convaluted sub plots that mean nothing, and lackluster fighting.... oh, and crappy humor.  So let's get down to it.

THE GOOD:
Casting: The casting is really the only saving grace of this movie, and even then, only if you're into and know a good deal about Hong Kong M.A. cinema. I'll admit, the lead character was unknown to me, but he does a decent job of playing the clueless main character. Tse Miu was actually the reason I bought this movie, even mindful kung fu fans probably don't know his name, but if you've ever seen the Jet LI movie ""The Enforcer"" (aka My Father is a Hero) you might remember the adorable lad who played Jet's son, well he's all grown up now, and making a bid at becoming a kung fu star himself, with movies like Champions and Iron Lion, oh, and this movie too I guess.
Ng Man Tat who plays the father who might be farmillar to fans of a little movie called Shaolin Soccer where he played the coach, even Uncle Wong Yat Fei hails from the same movie, there're not as funny in this movie but...
The real joy for me came from the casting of Kara Hui (My Young Auntie, the Brave Archer etc.) and Norman Chu Siu Keung (The Bastard Swordsman, Return of the Bastard Swordsman, etc.) both Shaw Brothers elites. You get some decent jokes at Kara Hui's expense when people refer to her as ""auntie"" which she viamately refutes (in real life Kara's nickname is Auntie because of her film ""My Young Auntie""). You even get to see Norman school our hero in fight, it made me all tingley inside.
But to be honest, that's about it for the good so...
THE BAD:
The Flow of the Film: It's just bad, it's like the director tried to Tarantino it, but forgot half way through. If you're going to try and manuvre the story around a bit in a non linear way, you have to make sure that you take the audience with you!!! This movie jumps around at times, and does nothing to ease the viewer's transistion, it just feel's jumbled and incomplete.
The Story: it's just dumb really, but to be more specific...it's like they were trying to sqeeze a comedy, a romance, and one of the rocky movies, shaolin soccer, all into Sammo Hung's Choy Lee Fut Movie (aka, fight the fight...), and that movie wasn't even that good. I mean, you don't feel invested in the characters, beacause you never get to know them because the film jumps around so much, and even when it doesn't, there are so many bad jokes, and sub plots that go nowhere that there's just not enough time in and hour and half movie for it all. Just a quick example: there is a brief romance that begins to brew between the hero's father and Kara Hui...this leads to NOTHING!!! Kara just slips out the back of this movie and never returns to indulge this pointless sub plot, here's to hoping she started working on another film and thats why she disappears.
The Humor: ..............................................................................................Shaolin Soccer but not funny at all............................................................
The Fighting: Any kung fu movie devotee knows that even the worst movie can be saved by great kung fu action, and to be fair, the action isn't terrible, but it's sub-par. It's not even on the part of the actors, when given a chance to shine they do, aside from Michelle (who gives lackluster fighting a new meaning...) everyone else really knows thier stuff and gives it a solid effort but... The Fights are stunted, they never really show a full fight, they just kind of throw a few punches and kicks that are edited poorly together, and then something happens to downplay the fight, my favorites being the fight between the Senior of the school and Tse, who when they fight can only be viewed by the other students through a small hole in one of the windows, which means the fight has already stared by the time they can even start watching it! and even then they keep jumping between the fight and the idiot students reaction, all and all you get maybe a minute of actual fight time. The second example is the non-fight betweem the hero and Tse at the end of the fight, the whole movie has been trying and failing to build this fight up, and finally it's here right? RIGHT?! ....Kind of...it lasts probably less than two minutes before Tse admits surender without even a decisive loss on his part and wishes the main character luck in his boxing match. Oh yeah, thats right, the final fight, and probably most engaging in the movie, ya know, THE KUNG FU MOVIE...is a boxing match against a japanese fighter the main character has never met...hello emotional tension right? and even then it manages to disapoint, with even more stupid jokes, and the movie suddenly remembering that there's an emotional bond between the male and female leads... I'm not kidding when I say that this does nothing to hamper the main character's fighting in the first round, it's not even mentioned, but suddenly becomes a huge factor in the rest of the fight, leading him to almost loose...

ALL AND ALL:
Bad humor, disjointed plot, terrible editing, sub-par fights, whats not to love? This was the directors first film, and I'm guessing also his last, he oviously had no idea what he was trying to do here, is it a Kung Fu movie? is it a boxing movie? is it the long awaited sequel to shaolin soccer? THE HELL IF I KNOW!!! As the top stated, if you really love MA cinema, or maybe want to see some pretty good cameos from shaw brothers veterans...it's not the worst movie I've ever seen...",1358380800,,9157,4.584502745576571
