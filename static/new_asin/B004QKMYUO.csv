8438235,5,B004QKMYUO,"This is the follow up workout to Do more Pilates-Standing. As usual, these two ladies are class-acts and give stellar instructions on form and how to execute each move. This DVD is broken into Four 15 min sections. You can do the whole thing or use each section as an add-on routine to your cardio. This is a professional home instruction of Pilates and the set is modern and their outfits are modest, yet cute and modern as well. I liked it a lot and it is a nice addition to my fitness and Pilates library! I hope these two come out with more soon.",1336435200,3,550,4.247619047619048
8438236,5,B004QKMYUO,"I bought this DVD after having had it recommended to me by a friend, and I'm really glad I did! The different chapters offer a great variety and the possibility to exercise as much or as little as I want at any given time. Professional throughout, great pace and instructions - this exercise-DVD is bound to become a favorite!",1310688000,,326,4.5423728813559325
8438237,5,B004QKMYUO,"This is an excellent DVD.  There are 4 main sections, 2 led by each instructor.  They are each about 15 minutes long.  You can pick and choose by chapter.  There is also a fundamentals section.  I have not done the fundamentals section although I have done the other chapters.

The setting is simple.  There are 2 people doing the workout, the two instructors.  All of the exercises are on the mat as the name implies.  The instructions are given live and via voicover so while doing the exercises they say things and they also add things via voiceover.  The music is quiet.  There are some modifications given during each of the chapters.

This is definitely an intermediate workout.  No special equipment is needed.

My favorite section is the leg section.  It is VERY similar to Niece Pacenka's Pilates During Pregnancy workout although maybe not quite as hard.  (Although I was pregnant doing that one.)  I also really liked the slow abs section with Bea.

I have many exercise DVD's and this one left me sore the next day in a good way (not all of them do.)  Highly recommend!",1306368000,6,1081,4.624338624338624
