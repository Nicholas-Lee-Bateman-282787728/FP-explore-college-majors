8582843,5,B00CKYG706,"This set of terrific recordings reminds me of how much I love Gilbert and Sullivan, and how few of us are left that so do.  Anyway, these fine productions by the Stratford Festival many years ago are simply terrific.  Taped in front of a live, appreciative audience the clarity of speech and lyric is excellent -- all that you could want. Recorded many years ago in ""glorious monophonic sound"" the shows are done with very little in the way of sets, but what sets there are are used very ingeniously by the directors.  The voices and acting are excellent, just as they should be and the addition of a live, appreciative, theater audience adds wonderfully to the illusion that it's all happening right now in front of you.  How sad that Gilbert and Sullivan, once towering icons of popular entertainment, have become a mostly unknown, tiny note in the history of musical theater.  Well, I love the operettas and they're not even a guilty pleasure. I just flat out love 'em! and this set of recordings does justice to the form.  Long out of print (what is the term for videos? Out of print doesn't sound right) I noticed that after I bought my set there were only 14 more available for purchase.  After that the deluge!",1430697600,7,1217,4.580645161290323
8582844,2,B00CKYG706,"In all fairness, these Canadian productions are for the most part very good.  But I give it a low rating because it is NOT the complete collection.  Not included is ""The Gondoliers"", which is the best of the series, right up there with ""The Mikado"".  So I am disappointed with this packaging.  No matter, over the past few years I've been able to purchase them all individually from Amazon.  Better to pay a little extra and have the whole set than to buy an incomplete package.",1380672000,12,478,4.511627906976744
