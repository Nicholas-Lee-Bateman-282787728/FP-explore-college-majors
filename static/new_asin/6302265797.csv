448964,4,6302265797,"That should have been a subtitle title for Dance With Me Henry.  While it's not their best work, a complicated plot which gets more complicated as it goes along, Henry is enjoyable if you like mob films. This represents a change in the direction of A&C films, with Lou playing Lou Henry, a play-it-straight, intelligent proprietor of Kiddyland amusement park.  All he wants is to keep the Welfare Board from declaring him an unfit parent and take away his two adopted children.  Bud plays Bud Flick, the semi-shady friend of Henry, who runs up a $20,000 gambling debt and gets in hot water with the mob.  Flick uses Henry's generosity and friendship to bail himself out, with disastrous results, even leading to Lou being wrongly arrested for the murder of the D.A.

As this was to be their last film together, the change in character was used to try something new.  While Henry will often remind the viewer of a 1950s mafia film, such as The Untouchables, there are plenty of laughs along the way.  For instance, the very last chaotic scene in the amusement park contains plenty of slapstick humor.  Also, the slick talking Flick manages to confuse Costello into disagreeable situations, as in many of their earlier films. Granted this is an atypical A&C movie, but any A&C fan will appreciate the boys' work here. As with other atypical A&C films, such as Time of Their Lives and Little Giant, Dance With Me Henry includes some of their most creative work.",1172102400,12,1458,4.735177865612648

448966,3,6302265797,"Here was another chance for Lou Costello to show his acting talents - a prior effort, The Time Of Their Lives - was also an impressive performance. Too bad he never got to play Mayor LaGuardia on film, as I've read. He's capable of generating much pathos, where an actor noted for frantic slapstick might exaggerate, or be overly sentimental. His role as the proprietor of ""Kiddyland"", a nearby amusement park convenient to the kids he's taken in, to the concern of a local social worker, gives him room to show what he can do. His buddy Bud is also effective, in a more, shall we say ""humbling role"", compared to the affable con-man he usually plays.
What's really wrong in this oddball but fun affair is the ill-conceived, overdrawn plot involving Bud's gambling habits and his less than honorable cohorts who occasionally supply his funding. The mix of kids and crooks is at times very awkward - in fact there's a very bizarre scene in which a young girl witnesses a murder at the park, later to be questioned. The victim is the actor who played the Inspector on ""The Adventures Of Superman"" TV series, interestingly enough, also directed by Charles Barton. It was very poor scripting not to provide for this character to appear at the end, recovered from the gunshot.
I enjoyed the use of the 1950s classic, ""Dance With Me, Henry"" (of course based upon the slightly risque ""Work With Me Annie"" by Hank Ballard And The Midnighters); theres a nice scene where the children dance to the General Audience version at Kiddyland when the bad guys are vanquished.",1166745600,4,1559,4.714285714285714
448967,4,6302265797,"Dance With Me, Henry was the last film the great comedy team of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello made together, and far from their worst.  Costello is the proprietor of Kiddyland, an amusement park, an appropriate character for his child like comedy style.  Abbott is his gambling partner.

The main part of the plot concerns crooks Abbott is indebted to, but there's a subplot about orphans and Costello losing custody of his kids due to a nosy, prim social worker played to perfection by the great character actress Mary Wickes (Who Done It?, On Moonlight Bay, Father Dowling Mysteries).

The supporting cast also includes former child star Gigi Perreau, Robert Shayne (who played Inspector Henderson on Superman) as the district attorney, and, as the Priest at the orphanage, Frank Wilcox, recognizable from numerous TV guest shots like Brewster on The Beverly Hillbillies, Wally's principal on Leave It To Beaver, and a judge on Perry Mason.

Much of the comedy in this one may seem hackneyed or aimed at children - such as the extensive chase through the amusement park at the end - but there is some good original comedy as well, such as when Lou, suspected of murdering the DA, is questioned by cops, and gradually through the long,  intense interrogation, he breaks down each cop, one after another. Plus, it's the only A & C film with rock music, or at least Rythm & Blues.

Dance With Me Henry is an appropirate final film for the great team, with higher production values than many of their other later films, certainly far better than Africa Screams, for instance, but more memorable for the characters they play than for laughs.",1118966400,9,1636,4.821428571428571
448968,2,6302265797,"The last Abbott and Costello picture together is a sad, unfunny vehicle that is difficult to watch.

  Plot Summary:

  ""DANCE WITH ME, HENRY"" was the screen swang song for the comedy team of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello. Most of the action takes place in Kiddieland, an amusement park owned by soft-hearted Lou Henry (Costello). An inverterate collector of strays, Lou has adopted orphaned kids Shelley (Gigi Perreau) and Duffer (Rusty Hamer), and has also provided a safe harbor for chronic gambler Bud Flick (Abbott). Bud's enormous gamnbling debts bring Lou under the scrutiny of gangster Big Frank (Ted De Corsia), who in turn is being monitored by District Attorney Proctor (Robert Shayne). When Proctor is murdered, Lou finds himself the number one suspect. The film concludes with a riotous chase through the carnival grounds, with Bud and Lou just a few steps ahead of the bad guys.

  Both Abbott and Costello seem tired and worn out in ""DANCE WITH ME, HENRY"", but a few bright moments manage to seep through the malaise of moldy old jokes and half-hearted sight gags.

The story begins with Lou running along the sidewalk to an orphanage. Lou keeps house for a widow and provides a home for orphans. The widow was put in a sanitarium. Bud enter the room to recall Lou. They run the ""Kiddyland"" amusement park. [Note their doubles who crawl under the moving vehicles.] There is comic banter about needing brains. Welfare wants to take the kids away from Lou. Miss Mayberry looks for Lou. A young man plays a record. The comic exchanges aren't funny (today). Mayberry has a court order to investigate Lou's house. Clothes are dried on a line. [Note the lack of a television.] Bottle hidden away? Bud owes a lot of gambling debts to the mob, who threaten him. Two big men show up looking for Bud, then leave. Ernie plays a record. There are comic skits. [Not as funny as in the past?]

Kids ride for free on Orphan's Day. ""Big Frank"" asks for his money, or Lou has to transport money to Chicago. Bud uses a telephone booth to speak to the D.A. [Remember those booths?] A girl plays with a toy pistol. [Remember them?] At night Lou visits Kiddyland; so does Bud (for different reasons). Later a villain meets the D.A. A shot is fired! Lou investigates. Will he be framed? That little girl hears it all! Bud stops the Ferris wheel, the police arrive to find a dead body! ""Don't say anything until you get a lawyer."" [Still good advice.] Lou is arrested for the shooting. A policeman finds a new empty satchel nearby. Lou is offered a cigarette before talking. ""Sing!"" He does a song. Lou has an unusual flask for coffee, and adds sugar and cream. Next a sandwich. Bootsie shows up with Father Mullahy to tell what happened. Lou improvises a tanning light. Bud is asked to retrieve the money. ""The worst aim I've ever seen."" The gang returns for Bud, they need him to find the loot. The movie continues with various skits.

Young boys go to Kiddyland at night. They are able to overcome the villains in the dark. Bud and Lou toss the money out, the villains are caught with it by the police. The record plays the wrong tune, the kids dance. [This dates the movie.] Shelley is grateful. They enjoy an outdoor picnic. The reward money was donated to the orphanage. Lou toots a flute and is followed by the kids to the picnic.

This is good in spots but worse overall than their previous movie ""Meet the Mummy"". The growth of television accompanied the decline in movie theaters and amusement parks. Skits alone do not make a comic movie without a story to carry them along. Repeating skits devalues them. No mention of the effects of exposure from their early television series.

449028,4,6302265797,"I love that song, but, sadly it wasn't used in the show, except for a short musical stretch. It seems unreal that this movie was made in 1956ad & this was their last movie together.  A & C were good, but the movie didn't seem to have the fun or zip that was in most of their shows, but it was still enjoyable & cute with the children & animals plus something that is disappearing from America: the small hometown amusement parks (we had Whalom Park & now it is the place of ugly condos). If you want something that the family can watch, then this will help especially considering the junk that they are calling entertainment nowadays. The VHS was in very good shape, but, if you get this movie, try to get it on DVD whenever they put it back out again, except, don't pay too much, unless, of course, you are a real die-hard fan of them & you want it at any cost. +JMJ+",1325548800,,868,4.166666666666667
