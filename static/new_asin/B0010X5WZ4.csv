8238952,3,B0010X5WZ4,"I always hate to review movies. I like any movie where animals, sea creatures, monsters or insects are crunching on people! So my views are slanted from the beginning!  Over half of my video library consist of these types. So I was okay with both of these! Both were a bit old, but the quality of both were fine. The color was good. The plot line was good, if predictable. For the price I was happy! Not bad for a B movie. Only 3 stars (would have given 3.5 if I could have) because both  were kind of slow and dry!",1404432000,,515,4.089108910891089
