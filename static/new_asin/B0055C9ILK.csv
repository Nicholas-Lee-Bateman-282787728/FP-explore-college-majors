8457785,5,B0055C9ILK,"At a time when you couldn't get away from Whoopie Goldberg's movie wrath, this film is one of a few that could keep them from subliminally shoving Whoopie down our throats! Liliana Komorowska tears up the screen as she gives the best ""scanner face"" yet. We are deprived until she comes out of her shell with her scientist father's experimental scanner calm drug, doing the opposite and gives her the itch for exploding heads and world takeover! We have to forgive her because she's such a babe and she's helping us forget about whoopie! Her brother, a canadian monk living in thailand? Does not forgive her as he fights his way from Bangkok to North America against Liliana's army of NRA, kung fu scanner baddies. The camera is forced to love him as he gets a quarter of an inch away from it with the most devastating scanner face since his sister. You are counting facial veins every five minutes as they scream for their own screen credits. The sweat is pouring off their faces as each scanner competes to see which one can crack the camera lense. The brother can't even find enough time to go to the toilet because there's so many assassins looking for him and during the motorycle chase you see him desperately watching as he zooms past all the portapodies. I missed this in theaters because I thought they would sneak in a Whoopie trailer. Liliana's french accent had me from hello as I was a mesmerized puppet in her control. Unfortunately her brother's head does not explode at the end and the camera had to divorce itself from Liliana's unblemished, 90's made up, female magnetism. I don't regret getting sidetracked in this review and hope they post it. Brilliant action dominates the entire film with great stunts, special effects, chases, and cool story line. 16x9 dvd from England picture and sound is great",1360108800,5,1819,4.705329153605016
