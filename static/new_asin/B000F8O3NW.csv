8119108,3,B000F8O3NW,"This may be a great title if you really like shows like ""FLCL"" or ""Slayers."" I was expecting something different. While on the funny side, I kept expecting this to get better as each episode went by. It didn't. I couldn't even bring myself to watch the whole thing. I felt like I was watching old-style Saturday morning cartoons. Yeah. That.
This may appeal to kids, though. Which is why I gave it 3 stars instead of 2. And for the younger ones, this could be a five star show!",1404691200,2,477,4.311111111111111

8119110,5,B000F8O3NW,5 STARS because this is simple and funny. This is worth watching and buying as well. This was a great bargain anime costs a lot when it first comes out. The story is easy to understand.,1356048000,,185,4.166666666666667
8119111,4,B000F8O3NW,"I bought this anime on a whim, and I was not suspecting much, but the show was pretty good.

 The story revolves around a band of
washed up pop idol band ""Mix Juice"" that needs that one gig to put them on the top. So what better way then to have a concert
on the moon! that leads them to boy genius Dr. Susumu Tsukumo and his cutie robot/human satellite assistant Kiku No. 8 to get
them there, but Dr. Tsukumo way of getting to the moon is not so simple. He wants a ""geen"" way to travel to the moon not one that uses burning fossil fuels. So he basically uses the girls as test subjects for hes wacky contraptions. He lunches the girls out in space with everything form catapults to giant balloons, and with each failure takes them one step closer to the moon.

 The dialog between characters is quite funny most of the time. Also I must say that the dub voice acting was vary done by ADV. The dub feathers voice taint from Luci Christian, Monica Rial, Hilary Haag, and more. The anime is a fun, and charming 12 part series that I would recommend a watch.",1337644800,6,1055,4.207920792079208
