8650369,2,B0058OR3WG,"This is my very first review. I love ProgRock. I am in a band. I own over 4,ooo CDs and over 200 DVDs. Collage was a good band, Satellite was a great band but with a new name and a new chick singer they miss the mark compleatly. This is a good band drounded in Honey and covered up with sugar. It just doesn't work.  Go with the last Satellite DVD with the Armenian singer/ bass player. And/or the last 2 Satellite CDs. This is a lemon and I want my money back. Long live ProgRock with power and glory. The new 'Believe' CD is what I'm talking about!  PEACE !",1330300800,,559,4.027027027027027
