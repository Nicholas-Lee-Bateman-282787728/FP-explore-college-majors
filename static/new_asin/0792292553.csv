138422,5,0792292553,"Most science or history based dvd's have a companion book that goes along with them. In the case of Guns, germs and steel, it's the other way around. This dvd series touches on some of the major points of the book very well. It is a good companion to the book. It is also a plus that Jarad Diamond is the host of this documentary, because you get to see and hear the man speak about this most facinating idea that has driven him for so long. If this idea of geography playing a major role in the fundemental developement of sociaty intrests you buy this dvd. But also buy the book and once you've seen the documentary, read the book. You will get a much better understanding of the concepts being put forth by Mr. Diamond if you do both these things as apposed to doing one or the other. In the end I know I was left with a better understanding of this facinating subject.",1121817600,19,872,4.227544910179641
138423,3,0792292553,"First, if you taped this documentary off of PBS, keep your tape as the ""extras"" here are little more than a few facts spiffed up graphically over a world map.

Diamond's thesis in ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" is that geography, which governs climate which, in turn, governs indigenous species, is the reason for the unequal distribution of wealth in the world today.  In short, Diamond is focused on why the Europeans conquered so much of the world.

There are 3 one-hour episodes in this series.  The first is concerned with why agriculture took hold in parts of the world and hints at the benefits it bestowed in developing large, complex societies.  The second episode is concerned with how these large complex (European) societies were able to develop weapons (guns and steel) to conquer much of the rest of the world.  Germs were an unintended weapon against indigenous people that may have been the most beneficial.  The last installment is concerned with another way to test the ""guns, germs, and steel"" hypothesis using the European march into Africa as test material.  Here, climate (created by geography) creates indigenous germs that the Europeans can't handle.  Nevertheless, guns and steel (apparently) still win the day.

This documentary is a reasonable, though somewhat superficial, overview of Diamond's thesis.  The problem is, however, that it is somewhat glib and fails to get to the ""Ken Burns"" gold standard.  There is much repetition of the ""guns, germs, and steel"" theme from episode to episode so that, even within the 3 hours, there should have been room to hint at some speculation on simple questions that the thesis itself invites.  For example, there is essentially no mention of China (except the standard reference to gunpowder being developed there).  If China had a complex civilization, why did they end up in isolation?  It is never mentioned, for example, *why* the Chinese, having developed gunpowder never used it in conquest.  (The neglect of China is particularly interesting as Diamond does deal with some of these issues in his book.)  Another example is the tropic climate theme:  the Americas had a tropical climate as well, complete with tropical germs and yet that did not slow the spread of European conquests there.  Finally, geography is presented on a primarily 2-dimensional world map scale, not accounting for crucial issues like climate changes at altitude or rapid transportation as a result of internal rivers within a continent.

Lastly, while this is really Diamond's show, it would have been valuable to have a few scholarly, dissenting opinions on why Diamond's theories haven't been universally embraced.  As it is, the documentary presents the ""guns, germs, and steel"" theory so forcefully, one is left to wonder why it took 30 years for someone as smart as Diamond to come up with a set of seemingly simple ideas.  The elegance of Diamond's theory is precisely because it shows how simple issues relate to the complexities of human history, but the documentary completely neglects competing ideas in this arena (and there are many).

It's nice that National Geographic is introducing these provocative ideas to the public at large, it's just a shame that such weighty material didn't produce a deeper program.",1121472000,244,3268,5.090056285178236
138424,5,0792292553,Guns germs and steel is one of my favorite book ever. I did not see the dvd yet (it's coming out the 12 of july) but with Nat. Geo on the case I bet that the theories of Jared Diamond will be well represented.,1118620800,6,209,3.772727272727273
138425,4,0792292553,"Diamond obliterates the easy racist assumption that certain societies thrived and conquered others because of their inherent genetic or racial superiority.  If anything, he shows that on an individual level, the member of a ""backward"" culture is far more impressive than that of an ""advanced"" society.  To survive, that individual has to be, in many ways, smarter and more imaginative than his more ""advanced"" counterpart.  The point is that societies conquer on a societal level and that the specialization that gives advanced societies a comparative advantage doesn't necessarily produce the most impressive well-rounded individuals.

Diamond's rebuttal of the kind of racist thinking that dominated the first half of the Twentieth Century is thorough, witty, and completely convincing.  Less successful is Diamond's second argument that geography has determined the fate of cultures -- i.e., the ability of Eurasian culture to conquer others.  Is it any accident that the person making this argument just happens to be a political geographer?  Still, Diamond's argument is subtle and impressive, if ultimately not quite as convincing as his anti-racist thesis.  He contends that geography determined what crops flourished, how easily they could be spread, and what domesticated animals could be used by the culture.  The Americas suffered from the wrong crops, lack of the set of large domesticated animals that flourished in Eurasia, and a north/south dominant axis (as opposed to east/west) that impeded the spread of crops, animals, technology, and advances.  Eurasian cultures had the animal power that permitted greater accumulation of wealth and population concentration and concomitant technological advantages.  And with the animals and rapid spread of disease came the ""germs"" and immunity that so advantaged Europe during the Columbian Exchange.

It's an impressive argument, though once suspects that God does play dice with the fate of human cultures.  As even Diamond concedes, a different set of leaders in China in the 15th century might have led to the Chinese rather than the Spanish conquering the Americas.

In fairness to Diamond, he is careful not to overargue his thesis and to invite further research and argument.",1478736000,,2240,5.49271137026239

The concepts were intriguing and thought provoking.  It is certainly a new spin on Darwin's ""Survival of the Fittest.""  This implies that survival has much more to do with how much available food there is and how many work animals are at your disposal than how tough you are. In other words ""location, location, location."" (ie, no work animals in South America, therefore, not as 'specialized' in the development of tools as for instance Spain).

There are still families in this world w/out ""domesticated"" animals.  The film showed you how important they are.  There's an organization ""Heifer Intl"" who gives gifts of animals to families.  They then have milk/eggs to eat & are able to support themselves by selling the products.  These animals open up a whole world of economical security for them.

[...] or 1-800-422-0474...gift a desperate family a basket of baby chicks or goat or bunnies or even a  ""heifer"".  So many animals to choose from.  Get together w/others & send a bunch of animals in a special someone's name.  With all of these animals - there's a gift card for whoever you're honoring.  These animals are the gifts - cards are the notifications.

One more very important aspect of gifting animals...the new owners are taught how to care for them - give offspring to neighbors & teach them how to care for the offspring.

138461,5,0792292553,"""Jared Diamonds journey of discovery began on the island of Papua New Guinea. There, in 1974, a local named Yali asked Diamond a deceptively simple question:

Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo, but we black people had little cargo of our own?

Diamond realized that Yalis question penetrated the heart of a great mystery of human history -- the roots of global inequality."" (from a PBS website review)

It turns out that accidents of biology, not even faintly understood to Europeans of the 1400s, provided an advantage.  That is, natural or partial immunity to diseases such as smallpox allowed European explorers and settlers to survive in a land that had experienced a plague of diseases.  Having arrived in America and able to survive the first few years because of ""Germs,"" it was the ""Guns and Steel"" that allowed the continued settlement of Europeans (since some Native Americans survived and became immune to some Germs at that point).

I think it is also notable that Yali's question is the same sort of incredulous statement that prompted the philosophy of science Professor Thomas Kuhn to investigate historical change in science, or scientific revolution.  For Kuhn, the question was:  How could the 1400s scholastics and Aristotelians -- among the smartest people of their society -- have believed such obviously wrong ideas such as the world being composed of four elements, or that human health is determined mainly by the balance of four elements.  So, just as Yali questioned how could Papua New Guinea natives and similar peoples not have developed modern tools and modern material wealth and Europeans did, Kuhn analogously questioned why could today's people have validated scientific knowledge about the periodic table of elements, gravity and the like while earlier people utterly lacked these concepts and appeared ignorant.  However, Diamond's explanation through biology (germs - infectious disease science) and technology (guns and steel) is stronger than Kuhn's approach, because Kuhn looks to voluntary changing of one's mind through a paradigm shift, when in fact explanations and events that span decades and centuries are needed for a more thorough explanation.  If Kuhn's idea about voluntary change of mind could be applied to the context Diamond explores (can a traditional people simply will themselves into creation of modern tools and material wealth?), it is clear that Diamond is on the right track:  it takes a series of geographic, biological, and technological accidents, along with scientific achievements, to provide a decisive edge to one society or another.

Yet even the advantages of modern society can be questioned, as Diamond does in ""The World until Yesterday"".  Now Yali's question can be turned around:  ""How is it that you industrial people have material wealth but often lack bodily and psychological health?""  Prof. Diamond proceeds to show how modern society can learn health lessons from traditional peoples, just as they can learn about modern technology from us.",1389225600,,3045,5.247422680412371

138467,3,0792292553,"""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" provides a very interesting perspective on history and helps explain why the West has come to dominate the world.  However, in the process he strains to avoid including the impact of anything possibly ""racist"" - eg. differences in culture or physiology. Also, moving from one segment of the DVD to another brings wasted time repeating the introductory materials.

Diamond's main point is that ability to cultivate crops and tend herds (determined by geography and available native species) allows setting aside resources for innovation and war.  Germs acquired from domestic animals then played decisive roles in the European conquests of Native Americans, Australians, South Africans, and Pacific Islanders.  Animal-based means of transporting food surpluses were also a pre-requisite for development of technologically innovative societies.

Factors Encouraging Farming:  Declining availability of wild foods, development of methods to harvest (eg. flint blades attached to handles, for harvesting; baskets; mortars and pestles to remove husks).  Cereals were a first crop.  The best area for this at the time was the Fertile Crescent.

Factors in Domesticating Animals:  Carnivores are too inefficient, want a fast growth rate (rules out monkeys, apes, elephants), easy breeding (rules out vicunas), good disposition (rules out African buffalo, hippos, zebras), limited panic tendency (rules out gazelles), herdable (rules out antelope - males fight when confined).

Another key Diamond point is that domesticated plants spread faster across Europe-Asia because of the long distances at similar latitudes.  Conversely, Africa and the America's longest distances are primarily north-south, posing greater difficulty because of the great climate differences.  In addition, the dry Texas area acted as a barrier between the SE and SW U.S. for transmitting crop-growing lessons.

Diamond then concludes that the long East-West axis across Europe-Asia helped spread the development of the wheel for transporting crops, and writing (helped in trade).  Meanwhile, the prehistoric Mexico's wheel and early writing systems never made it to the Andes.

Some areas (eg. Australia, and the Western U.S.) did not have readily domesticatable crops.

Major killers of humanity throughout recent history - smallpox, flu, TB, malaria, plague, measles, and cholera - are infectious diseases evolved from diseases of animals, according to Diamond.  Until WWII, more victims of war died of war-borne microbes than battle wounds.  Diamond goes on to assert that agriculture led to greater disease because of higher population densities, use of feces as fertilizer, disease transmitting rodents attracted by stored food, and transmission along resulting trade routes.

Smallpox gave the Spaniards in America a decisive advantage - from 1520 to 1618 Mexico's population fell from about 20 million to about 1.6 million.  For the New World as a whole, the Indian population decline in the two centuries post-Columbus was about 95%.  Indians did not have diseases to transmit back to Europe because they had much fewer animals, did not drink their milk, and did not keep them indoors.  (Eurasia had 13 species of big domestic mammals - some also useful for cultivation, and the Americas just one very local species - the llama, confined to a small area in South America.)  However, tropical Asia, Africa, Indonesia, and New Guinea had cholera and yellow fever - making those areas much more difficult to colonize.

Acceptance of change is another important factor - Islam, until about 1350 led Europe, until its religion began holding it back.  (Diamond also mentions later that inhabitants of the Fertile Crescent undid their agricultural advantage by cutting down trees, allowing the sandy soil to become a major enemy.)  Similarly, China formerly led the world in technology and ship-building, but then regressed under subsequent inward-focused leadership.

Food production increases population size and also acts to make societies more complex.  For example, Diamond believes that a large society that leaves conflict resolution to members is guaranteed to blow up.  A second reason involves economic and welfare considerations - goods in excess of an individual's needs must be transferred to a centralized authority, which then redistributes these to individuals with deficits.

Overall, Guns, Germs, and Steel"" provides interesting insights into early world history; however, I strongly suspect Diamond's efforts to be politically correct limited his insights.",1371427200,,4569,5.6262773722627735
138468,1,0792292553,"It is absolutely amazing how we see a scientist struggle with history to try and explain the reason there is a huge wealth disparity in the world. Jared Diamond in his attempt to solve the problem of why some nations have more 'cargo'(a term used for material goods) than others suggests that they are because of guns, germs and steel.

Let me just give you the crux before you waste several hours of your life like I did. According to Jared Diamond a long long time ago some people in the middle east just happened to be lucky in that they had the right crops for agriculture so they started making villages. Along with that they also had the right animals like pigs, horses, cows and goats so they started making civilizations. Then they over exploited the environment and moved to greener pastures in the west (europe) and east (towards india, china etc. These people then developed steel with which they made awesome swords and they later made guns for speedy conquest of the rest of the world. Along with that they also had very bad diseases but they had developed immunity and their diseases killed off other populations. Therefore europe was just very lucky to be geographically in the place that it was and everyone else was just really unlucky. Taaadaa there you have it, I've saved you money and time.

Why non of this makes sense would be a no brainer. Firstly its overly simplistic in that he's basically put it all down to sheer luck. I understand that his motivation to do so was to prohibit any feelings of racism which might suggest that certain people were smarter or more creative. But it completely eliminates any other factor. Factors such as religion, cultural outlook towards knowledge, economy, development of rights, politics and most importantly shortage.

This documentary would completely fail to explain why africa was conquered in a matter of days. North Africa afterall was the place of tremendous knowledge, trade and culture in places like Egypt and Morrocco. Could the people living in central or southern africa never make a single trip to go north and bring back guns and steel? Diamond himself says that the central africans were trading as far as india? Why weren't they bringing back anything useful?

How is that places like denmark and sweden which are prepetually covered in snow develop means of agriculture and livestock and then went on to become great economies. What about Russia?

His entire thesis is utter euro centric and completely eliminates other tremendous civilizations that had guns, germs and steel too like the islamic countries, china, japan, south east asia etc.

Diamond also mis-states countless facts. For instance he keeps telling the viewer that horses were instrumental in the rise of Europe because they help in cultivation, wars and general locomotion. He states several times that they came from the middle east and as always the middle east just got lucky. Sorry to burst the bubble but horses actually came from central asia. And if the argument is that middle east started using them in the deserts of arabia why didn't the africans catch on?

Last but not the least watching this DVD was like watching a hypnosis tape where after every 5 mins the narrator in the back ground or diamond himself would say that this or that is all because of GUNS GERMS AND STEEL. Over and over again in a constant repetition.

The aim of the DVD is perhaps to fight racism or suggestions that some people people are smarter than others. It fails miserably and ends up doing exactly the opposite at times.

138473,1,0792292553,"Personally, I found this documentary to be unrealistic and one-sided regarding history and the interactions of people groups. Descriptions of Europeans are positive, intimate and celebratory (blessed, lucky, gifts, advantageous, strategic), while depictions of those they colonized with their weapons are more removed, violent and simple (hostile, undernourished, illiterate, not evolved genetically to combat disease).

The choice to engage in conquest and the brutal and racist foundations for colonization practiced by Europeans are glossed over or ignored. Conquest itself is presented as an inevitable and acceptable occurrence, while those ""conquered"" are presented as being unreasonably resistant toward Europeans. Europeans, not ""Native"" peoples, are repeatedly referred to as ""victims,"" while those conquered are called ""hostile.""

I watched this documentary series in hopes to better understand a history of people groups rooted in a mysteriously, uniquely European-enacted will to dominate others internationally. In contrast, I found the message communicated by this documentary to be one of luck, ""blessing,"" and positive ambition. Overall, this was likely a well-meaning work but struck me as a grossly misrepresented and Eurocentric portrayal of both history and relationships between people groups.

138477,4,0792292553,"In 1997, Jared Diamond set the academic world on fire with his seminal tract on the fates of human societies, Guns, Germs and Steel.  In it, he tried to answer posed to him by a native New Guinean, namely why did Europeans build ships and come to New Guinea and not vice-versa? His geography-based response won him the Pulitzer Prize, but also created many detractors who viewed his thesis as reductionist. Eight years later, Diamond and National Geographic joined forces to create a three-episode documentary based on his ideas. In episode one, Diamond comes out swinging at his critics. He takes us to the highlands of New Guinea where the original question was posed. As we see quite clearly in the video, it's a different world than on the mainland of large continents. There are fewer species plants and animals available for cultivation and domestication. As a result, the food supply was never as abundant as it was elsewhere. With no food surplus, the population in New Guinea never reached the same levels in did in Europe and Asia. There were no complex governments, armies, technology, or writing. Food surpluses, or ""farmer power,"" are the basis of large-scale civilizations according to Diamond. Without the same types of grains and animals, the people in New Guinea could only grow so much. Geography was destiny, Diamond claims, not backing off one inch since the original publication of his book.

Whereas episode one parallels the book by explaining the importance of food production, episode two expands on an important section in book, the Collision at Cajamarca. Diamond used the massacre of the Incas by the Spaniards in 1532 to lay out questions the book would cover, why the Spaniards came to Peru and not vice versa, why Pizzaro captured Atahualpa and not the other way around, etc. Episode two goes into the massacre in far greater detail than the book. The Spaniards were riding horses, animals found in the Old World and not the new. The horse gave the Spaniards a huge advantage, creating a stable platform to strike down on the Incas. The Spaniards had steel weapons, while the Incas had only obsidian-tipped clubs. The cannons the Europeans fired terrified the locals, who had never seen them before. All these advantages, Diamond claims, were due to geography. These were available to the larger populations of the old world, but not in the Americas. And it's chillingly illuminated in the video, hitting the viewer with visceral images not available in book form.

Episode three takes us to a region that was essentially overlooked in the book, sub-Saharan Africa. We follow the arrival of Europeans in South Africa and their subsequent takeover of that region, as their superior weapons, technology, and livestock drove the natives to the margins of the land. But as they moved north, the Europeans advantages diminished. Whereas the climate of southern Africa is similar to that in Europe, the areas to the north are hotter and wetter. European livestock and crops did not thrive in this region. Moreover, the diseases found in this region slowed down European penetration. This was mentioned in passing in the book, as Diamond noted the north-south orientation of Africa prevented the transmission of guns, germs, and steel from place to place in contrast to the east-west orientation of Eurasia, which permitted this movement. Overall, this DVD set serves as a fine companion piece to the book, and in some ways expands on the original ideas. Of course, it cannot quite capture the same amount of detail, but it is certainly worthwhile, whether or not you have read the book.",1338422400,,3611,4.975165562913907

His incredulous claim of, ""the white man didn't know about germs""  -is totally false. The English did in know about small pox by giving infected blankets to the North American Indians. Instead - he focuses on on Spanish in South America. In Africa  - he skips over the Tutsi and Hutu which are not tribes but a Belgianan created division, while displaying English in a very rosy light in South Africa. Totally ignores Asia altogether and does not take in the culture of the different peoples.

This book/video is attempting to depict the white man's richness on germs, luck and geography and nothing more and not the culture of hubris in Europe.

The germ theory doesn't make sense because he talks about living with the animals to get an immunity without mentioning how European beastility is the main reason how sickness transmitted from animals to Europeans  - the vector coming from Spain Grenada when the Moors fell and after 700 years of Muslim rule - syphilis  ran rampant in Europe and then transfered world-wide.

He ignored China  completely is because it doesn't fit into his half-baked idea. The English did China in with Opium - tons and tons and tons of it - that's why he ignored Asia.",1302566400,4,1297,4.657894736842105

It is barley possible to refute such nonsense. Diamond is not a Geologist, Paleontologist, Historian, Botanist, Metallurgist or have any understanding of the science of the ""facts"" he babbles on about. The series mentions Eurasia and then Asia is
ignored other than the fertile crescent for the next 9,000 years. Reality check, Europe and Asia were populated by many different peoples, keep in mind for all you left wing racists that the near east would have been populated by Caucasians not Orientals. Unlike most I have actually been to Egypt and the Near East, the ancient Egyptian statues with people of light skin and gray and green eyes in the Cairo museum. Where do you think white people came from the middle east and central Asia moving into Europe. It is so bizarre that Diamond wants to disparage white Europeans forgetting that they where the same people to come out of Asia from the Fertile Crescent and Black Sea area. Smallpox originate in rodents not cattle. Most virulent strain originated in Asia. There is no great outcry how this Asian disease killed so many Europeans. The delusional author claims on the one hand there are no tropical civilizations comparable to Europe but misses the Thai, Khmer, Indus, Viet and ignores the Mayan he mentioned earlier. The fertile crescent went north south as well as east west, since this would mess up his theory (ideology)  he just rearranged  the location to suit him. Singapore was a successful  British colony because the British made it so even the people of Singapore recognize this, they have a statue honoring the Brit that made it successful. Bantu language group as an entire civilization would be the  same as calling  most of Europe, US, Australia and all of South America a Aryan civilization since English and all Latin languages are in the Aryan language group. Diamond is clearly a clueless individual. Not a historian and he bets on  the ignorance and racism of the multitudes who praise this crap to support some self righteous or self hating delusions. Why not call the continent the AfroAsiaEuro continent since Africa was (still is by tunnel)  connected to Asia. The Mayan civilization was in a tropical location. His latitude theory keeps failing if anybody makes a effort and looks at a map and more importantly the climate has changed over thousands of year as well as the angle of the Earth in it's orbit. His entire delusion is contradicted by the South African ""Civilization""
that had cattle, metal and trade thousands of years before whites showed up. Essentially if you have already decided that whites are inferior creatures and all western civilization is bad then you will laud this pc rant of a series. Basically  we have to accept  what he says without any real proof skipping almost all of Asia  and all of it's peoples, civilizations and 11,500 years of history because he says it's so.

If you travel the world a bit you'll probably be left scratching your head at the inequality, and left wondering why the world is really that way.  I think this film shows a very valid reason for why but of course not the whole picture.  There's no doubt that geography played a central role in why, during the last 13,000 years since the last ice age, some peoples prospered and some didn't.  I happen to think that there's some corruption involved but this film deals only with the geographical aspects.  Still a very valid part of the whole story.

Of course all this was God's will.  (I went to Catholic school.)  This eerily familiar story line is augmented by Dr. Jared Diamond in this compelling documentary in which he explains these phenomena in understandable and sometimes surprising ways.  The importance of domesticated animals may be more obvious at first glance, but their involvement in disease and later decimation of the Native American population is an example of the unintended consequences that plague human history (no pun intended).

 I use this film in Technology and Society classes where most students are introduced to these principles without the assumption that the ""greatness"" of European domination was inspired by Divinity.  This is definitely worth the class time.  Inspired discussions in any Humanities-oriented class from Nationalist arrogance  to Global Warming make this a valuable addition to any teacher's collection. The fact that the ""mosquito line"" is rising in Africa (see Inconvenient Truth) and West Nile Virus is in Southern Californian have been subjects of discussion after viewing this film.

A big contributing factor to these agrarian cultures was close proximity to animals and the diseases they carried.  This provided the immunity to germs which other cultures lacked.  The germs were by far more lethal than the guns and steel.  Jared Diamond shows how these events all came about and the twist that happened in Africa.

The first time viewer should find the video interesting and stimulating. It provides a brief overview of the overall concept, and helps visualise the importance of the three main points, guns, germs and steel. The video also goes on to explore how these same forces affect more recent world events. However, in the shortness of time, there is not enough substance in the video to fully explain all the points that are covered.

It's well done, interesting with the usual excellent filmography by NatGeo, as well as enlightening dialogue with J.Diamond. It is a personal story, the answer to a New Guinean's question posed 30 years ago:""how come you white men have so much cargo and us New Guineans have so little?""

So exactly why did Europeans conquer the world in the 16th-19th centuries? His short answer is the title: Guns, Germs and Steel. His long answer is biogeography, Europeans had a leg up on the rest of the world because of wheat and cows, which allowed a higher, more materially prosperous, greater population centered in larger cities society which overwhelmed the aborginal peoples of N and S America, Oceania and the Southern tip of Africa. It's almost common wisdom that this is at least part of the answer, but Diamond does an excellent job of arguing the point and showing the consequences of this division into Northern and Southern societies.

I enjoyed the show, it is not a deeply thinking type of documentary, but rather aimed more at the emotions, the feelings of comradeship that ought to exist like the bonds between Diamond and the people he knows in New Guinea, or the sympathy for young malaria victims in Africa. The idea that the west, that Europeans, are blessed not for what they are, nor for what they did, but simply because of where their ancestors settled, is meant to temper the common ideal that my arm has gotten me this wealth and it is justificably mine to do whatever i think best, that those in need have only to reach out and do the same thing to succeed, rather than expecting a handout from the strong. Not a bad lesson at all, gratitude, modesty, sharing, not done in a particularly heavy handed preaching way as is often the case, but rather low keyed, here are the facts, you are not better than the New Guineans but rather more lucky, not smarter or more hard working or whatever, just fortunate.

I look forward to Diamond meet a Chinese man who asks him:""why does the West have so much when us Chinese had all the pieces you mention long before the Europeans. But we used gunpowder to make firecrackers not firearms. Why doesn't material wealth follow good culture and wisdom?"" And that is where the show leaves me, what he says is all good and probably substantially true, but why didn't China develop long before the West?",1174348800,6,2408,4.621495327102804

It covers most of the material in the book and presents Diamond's hypothesis for cultural evolution in a succinct manner. Unlike many DVD conversions from books, the DVD portrayal of GGS seems to work. Diamond's basic hypothesis is that the technical revolution that occurred amongst some cultures but not others over the last 13,000 years was due primarily to a geographical advantage. Cultures who developed cereal crops and farmed animals had the time and energy to develop guns, and steel. So Europeans have ocean liners and jet fighters but people living in the highlands of New Guinea do not, because the New Guinea highlanders were too busy surviving and they did not have the geographical advantage of broad acre farming. The principle of Occam's razor suggests that a simple hypothesis should take preference over a complex account. Diamond's portrayal of human social and technical evolution does seem too simple. It might be a good idea to keep an open mind on this however because Diamond may have stumbled on to an idea that may take some time to unpack.

Diamond does a wonderful job of showing the uniqueness of Africa in terms of the affect of imperialism on it, as well as why unlike Australia and the Americas, the population of subSaharan Africa is not primarly Caucasian.

One sad note.  The scene of children dying of malaria had my children saddened, especially when Jared Diamond himself is shown bursting into tears.

The special feautures of this DVD are great to for an introduction to world history course.

Note for non-teachers:  If you have read the book already, this DVD is not a necessity, as it is a lightened version of the book.",1144454400,12,789,4.757352941176471

This piece of environmental and liberal hyperventilation steals liberally from true scholarship, such as ""Rats, Lice, and History"" by Hans Zinsser. It makes obvious observations in such a self congratulatory style as to be nauseating. Diamond's on camera mugging and fake shows of emotion are hideous.

138511,4,0792292553,"Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel is a Pullitzer Prize-winning book that traces the progression of human history from hunting and gathering societies to agricultural, industrial societies. The book itself is phenomenal, and has catapulted Diamond to the status of America's best-known popular scientist.

The documentary Guns, Germs, and Steel is definitely worth watching. However, some commentary is needed. The first episode (""Out of Eden"") is by far the best episode of the three. This episode examines the development of agriculture and the rise of permanent settlements. The least interesting/most boring of the three is Episode 2: Conquest. Episode 3: Into the Tropics provides a quick history of African colonization and resistance, with a focus on current disease patterns on the continent.

Episode 1 is fantastic, and this episode alone would have made a fine documentary. Unfortunately, the second and third episodes become repititive and seem to lack a coherent focus. Having said that, though, these two episodes still have educational and insightful value - but they simply do not live up to the first.

This three-episode set follows Diamond's book closely, and since I have already discussed the book in a separate review, I will not comment on Diamond's thesis here. I recommend watching this film in conjunction with reading the book. Whether or not you agree with Diamond's over-arching theory of human history (I personally do happen to agree with it), you will at the very least find the argument Diamond makes to be quite compelling.",1142467200,11,1561,5.286290322580645
138512,2,0792292553,"The primary purpose of the documentary appears to be repeating the phrase ""guns, germs and steel"" -- much like William Shatner repeats ""Danny Crane"" in Boston Legal.

By the time you've reached Africa, you hear ""guns, germs, and steel"" so often that you realize you're supposed to ignore the historical shortcuts the production takes in demonstrating the supposed lack of permeation of ""guns, germs, and steel"" in Africa: Whereas it took televisable hours to follow the spread of ""guns, germs, and steel"" thru Asia, Europe, America, European contacts with Africa are reduced to a few minutes of Dutch/English settlement and expansion of/from South Africa in the 19th century. (Apparently, there were never any Roman, Phoenician, Spanish, Portuguese, French contacts prior to the Boer trek.)

Accordingly, a hapless Boer family contracting athlete's foot in the heart of the continent has to double as the proof that somehow, those wily native cultures were not susceptible to ""guns, germs, and steel"". That's about a minute before Diamond starts sobbing hysterically about what ""guns, germs and steel"" have done to Africa.

Mercifully, by that time you have turned off, tuned out and dropped out.

138514,3,0792292553,"This is a review on the program and not the book, as I have not read the book.

Diamond's view on geographical influence on cultures is innovative and worth knowing if you are interesting in anthropology. However, it should not be take as a definitive explanation for the uneven distribution of wealth.

Diamond is a biologist by training and from the program; I believe he lack history and anthropology background, areas that is critical for the development of his theory. For starter, Diamond seems to have forgotten the existence of the Chinese, Indian and Arabian civilizations (listed from East to West). He did mentioned some inventions from other area of Eurasia however it all ended with the European being the most inventive and best at assimilating ideas. Others, such as steel and printing press being developed solely in Europe are quite ethnocentric and showed his lack of history background.

Like all anthropological theorist, Diamond cannot escape the limitation of being just one person. He is without question an accomplished biologist, however, he might be over his head when he takes on the task of explaining inequality along, a task that require extensive knowledge in history, anthropology and natural science.

Worth knowing as another theory

If you weeded out the repeats of ideas and unnecessary dramatic details, it oculd be a 1/2 hour documentary.  But, I might have liked this much better if I had not read the book first.

I would like to recommend another book, along the same lines:  Conquests and Cultures, by Thomas Sowell.  I'd love to see that one as a documentary.",1127606400,20,463,4.4523809523809526
138518,4,0792292553,"I read the book and I think the videos are good.  I think Diamond is a left-winger.  Guns, Germs and Steel is pretty much non-stop European bashing.  Somewhat over simplified, what about all the the barbarians that beat up on the Europeans?

138519,3,0792292553,"Based on Jared M. Diamond's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1997 book, Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies (W.W. Norton & Co., New York, 480 pp., [32] pp. pls.), this July 2005 telecast (also available on DVD) received full and somewhat critical reviews by M. Balter in Science 309: 248-249 (8 July 2005) and by N. Martel in The New York times (11 July 2005).

Suffice it to say here, the first episode is the best, and by far the most botanical, dealing with Diamond's controversial ideas on the origins of agriculture and domesticated plants and animals in the Near East and their global latitudinal (rather than longitudinal) spread. Episode 2 is a tad overkill, focusing almost entirely on that fateful November-1532 day when 168 Spaniards killed some 7000 unarmed Incas; smallpox was the cour de grce for countless Incan survivors of the massacre, who lacked the resistance to the disease many Europeans had. Episode 3 deals with the European and Boer colonization of Africa and ends in hopeful platitudes but regretfully offers no solutions for the continent's troubles. [Because the first episode deals much with grains, and because guns and germs do not enter until the second episode, I suggest a better title for the book would have been Grains, Guns, Germs, and Steel.] Despite the obvious padding and repetition characteristic of video endeavors of this sort, the program is definitely worth watching for its historical and biological insights.",1125878400,50,1464,5.1

138523,4,0792292553,"In response to ""book lover's"" comment, I would just like to say that having read Dr. Diamond's book, I do not find obvious holes in his theory. Furthermore, I believe that his book has done a great deal to forward the thinking of those who question the reasons for Anglo-European domination of western civilization, and ends the myth that it has anything to do with genetic prowess or inherent superiority. The academic world needs more people like Jared Diamond.

I am a professor of medical anthropology and use ""Guns, Germs, & Steel"" as a part of my curriculum. I use the DVD's as an introduction and suppliment to the book; I think that National Geographic intended the presentation to be used as such.

It belabors the obvious (guns were more deadly than spears) while leaving huge questions unaddressed (why didn't the Bantus, with their sophistocated, advanced society  based upon advantageous geography, domesticated animals, crops, etc. create similarly deadly weapons and colonize Europe?)

Instead, it repeats the same statements (I gave up counting the number of times Dr. Diamond said ""As I wrote in my book Guns, Germs and Steel"" or ""It's a journey I began while in Papua New Guinea."") The recaps of narrative and visuals (I also gave up counting the pan shots of smallpox victims, or men carefully loading guns) starts to make one feel like we're in an endless loop.

At best, there's an hour of material here. Does it do justice to Dr. Diamond's work? Sadly, I think it does, because if you've read the book, you'll know his theory is full of holes.",1122595200,24,920,4.8471337579617835

All I can glean from this series is that the difference between the haves and have-nots is the luck of location and the luck of location is not always lucky for the haves when they step out of their bounds.

Many of the facts are just down right wrong it is like the tail waging the dog. One good example is that as you can see in the series ""The Ascent of Man"" (Available in Britten) or the book by Jacob Bronowski it was the natural change in wheat that brought on agriculture not agriculture that brought on the change in wheat; he also misses the boat by ignoring the economic reasons for culture, commerce and war. A good book to read on the subject of plants migration and commerce is ""Green Cargoes"" by Anne Dorrance. There are too many examples of missed or purposely ignored more logical reasons for differences in cultures for example it is never mentioned, for example, ""why"" the Chinese, having developed gunpowder used it in a more benign manner.
