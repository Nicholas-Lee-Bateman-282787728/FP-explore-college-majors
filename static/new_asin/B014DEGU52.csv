Always timely and relevant, professional, and uplift the name of Jesus Christ as the only way of salvation.  This is a great movie, as it has great truths in it for everyone - whether you are a believer, or a non-believer.  Highly recommend this movie!",1448755200,2,379,4.7846153846153845

7388283,1,B014DEGU52,Unfortunately the premise of a biology professor teaching that evolution is the basis for the origins of life is so wrong it is laughable. Any actual biology teacher would know better than to claim evolution has any connection with abiogenesis. Clearly the writers of this movie have never had even a basic biology education.,1448064000,10,325,5.037037037037037
7388284,4,B014DEGU52,"God's not Dead part 2! Well, it could have been called that. ;)  Whether you believe in Evolution or call it Science, or whatever you think you know about Evolution, there is a very heated debate going on in this world.  Just go on youtube and you can spend a lifetime listening to debates on this subject.  Extremely heated on both sides wherever you look. This debate is going anywhere. While I won't turn this into an evolution discussion on the accuracy, it's very very important to all who study evolution to know exactly what people mean by evolution. Some text books are more accurate than others, some take it to a level of a ""theology"" more than a scientific inquiry. In either case, Evolution to many Christians is a major threat to the creation story of Genesis and that's what this is about.

IF anyone saw God's not Dead, you can put this in the same department as that movie. A student goes to a public secular college and goes to a Biology class that teaches Evolution theory. This student, starts losing her faith and then her dad steps in to debate the professor. That's basically the main gist of the film. I find the acting well done, not as B grade as I was expecting. Truth be told, I just came across this trailer on Facebook, so I didn't evne know it existed. Far as I know, it went straight to DVD, not in theaters. The main character, played by Jordan Trovillion who was in Jack Reacher, plays her role nicely and is a very beautiful actress which seems to enjoy the role she is in. After her dad learns she is taking a class from an evolutionist, he goes to the professor and the professor eventually challenges this father to a public debate at the college. This of course brings tension between the father and the daughter and things get pretty interesting. The Biology professor is played by actor Harry Anderson. Some might recognize him as he is best known for the role of Judge Harry Stone on the popular television series Night Court. He plays his role well and just like in God's not Dead, the professor is made out to be the bad by some of the actors. Although I'd say, his kinder nature kind of deters from God's not dead's approach. He's likable and interesting to listen to.  I won't give away what happens at the end, but those who have faith, never threat, if you know God is real and Genesis is real, then the debate is over. If you're an atheist, then more power to you, I won't question your beliefs if you question mine, on either side of the table, I think both sides would get something out of watching this. God bless to all.",1447372800,31,2572,4.417721518987341

7388342,3,B014DEGU52,"I watched this movie and it felt like what happened near the end was a sermon instead of a debate. The creationist guy who finished the debate for the other guy was basically saying that we should believe in creationism not because it's true but because we need a god to have rules and to be accountable to.

If you believe in an all powerful god who can create the world in six days, then let him fight his battles. When you try to defend him, you imply that he is too weak to do it himself.

To be clear, I am not all that well versed in evolution. I was raised in Christianity with creationism as the only thing I knew. However, something tells me that this movie is not at all an accurate representation of evolution. I have read some books and watched videos about evolution. If I understand correctly, evolution is not an explanation of the origin of life but how life has evolved over time.

But more importantly. One could theoretically still accept evolution and believe in a god. Similarly, one could be a creationist and believe in a god that is NOT the same one as the Christian god. The world is full of Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, atheists, and agnostics. There is no such dichotomy of Evolution vs Creationism for the simple reason that there are infinite different types of creationism and/or theories for how life began. Indeed, one need not believe life had an origin at all.

I'm giving this three stars because while I don't particularly like it all that much, I do think it valuable because movies like this represent what Christians believe. It is for this reason that atheists like me still sometimes like to watch Christian movies. I may disagree with everything about Christianity but I would hate to misrepresent them. My main complaint though is that Christians nearly always misrepresent non-Christians. This can't be helped however because they simply often don't know what the rest of the world believes.",1467158400,,1959,4.702623906705539

7388359,3,B014DEGU52,"I must say that I was disappointed in this film.  I read the reviews, and feeling fairly certain it would be a good addition to our church library, I bought it.  The top review said it was on the level of God's Not Dead 2.  Nope. From the beginning, it was lame and completely unbelievable.  To begin with, no Christian father that interested in his daughter's education would be shocked to learn the biology professor at a secular university was teaching evolution.  Her major is biology and it has never occurred to dad this would happen?
The acting is okay, but at times, it is cringeworthy.  The arguments on both sides seem rather general and over-simplistic.  One argument used by the Christian college guy went like this: Your grandma and great-grandma didn't look like apes, therefore humans didn't evolve from monkeys.  Yeah, THAT would cut it on a college level.  I was disappointed that the daughter didn't seem to know what she believed.  I completely agree with DonnaA--a reviewer who said, ""It would have been interesting to have shown a main character who really struggled with the conflicts between her beliefs and what she was being taught; with her upbringing and the social pressures at a secular university.""  That would have been more believable/realistic.  Instead, a dad (who has never debated before) prepares to debate his daughter's professor in what ends up as a widely publicized event.

As for the debate, it wasn't much of a debate. How could it be? Both belief systems accept certain things by faith.  The film does make that clear.

The closing scene wrapped up the entire package with a too-cute bow.  Christian guy takes girl to the spot where her father led her to Christ after comforting her because a boy took a coin she'd found.  She has to be prodded to remember.  ""Oh, yeah, I do remember that,"" she finally says.  As if her salvation experience is not up there on her list of VIP memories.  Then the guy reveals he was the boy who took her coin all those years ago and he too accepted Christ that day.  Groan.  How perfect is that?  At least she ends up with the godly guy who isn't about seducing her and making another conquest.

I thought most of the film was cheesy, but my junior high age son seemed to enjoy it.  Because of that, I gave it three stars.",1463788800,4,2299,4.617283950617284

7388364,1,B014DEGU52,"There wasn't even enough straw there for a decent straw man. Individuals getting faster times in the Olympics and technological advances have absolutely nothing to do with evolution, and the ""chicken and the egg"" question was a complete red herring. I imagine that was meant to be a stand-in metaphor for complexity and simplicity--was complexity imposed from on high, or did it ""bubble up"" from simplicity below. Maybe if this (strangely) central metaphor had been explained a little bit, it could have made sense, but everyone talked about it as if creationists literally believe a chicken came first and evolutionists believe that the EGG came first? Not AN egg--that actually would certainly be true since the modern chicken is a human creation, breeding jungle fowl that had descended from theropod dinosaurs--and they all laid eggs. But THE egg, as in something laid an egg and chicken hatched from it? That was the conception of evolution that a college biology professor appears to have been teaching.

I despise fundamentalist Christianity, but I liked many of the people in this film and understood something of their anxieties. People like this deserve better propaganda. This was a lazy, ham-fisted, and irritatingly stupid movie, and it made me sad for Harry Anderson. Usually magicians are better skeptics than this. But mostly it was just bad storytelling, as most stories that are contrived merely for the sake of making a point tend to be. Even the gawdawful ""God is Not Dead"" movies are a little better at stories than this poor beast is. To me the saddest thing of all is that I, as a former evangelical who is now an atheist, could have done a much better job on BOTH SIDES of this issue than the writer/director did. That should not be the case, not for a professional production.",1462838400,6,1801,4.9049180327868855

7388382,1,B014DEGU52,"Wow, so bad. In the debate about creationism v evolution in the end, they hardly even debate about the actual subject. The creationist debater does every strawman argument such as that scientists teach evolution because they don't want this supposed god looking down at them. No, it is about following the evidence. Arguing evolution isn't true because it would be so dandy if a god existed for whatever reason is not an argument for or against evolution. It is pointless and has nothing to do whatsoever with the subject. Evolution should be examined on its' merits and based on its' scientific merits, the evidence for it is overwhelming.

7388395,2,B014DEGU52,"Although I am not a Christian, I had high hopes for this movie.  I liked Harry Anderson from back in his Night Court days, and I think I have an open mind when it comes to respecting Christian viewpoints.
As the film climaxed though, I felt it sunk back into the quagmire of the victimized Christian threatened by godless academia.
I thought the film would have worked better with a unifying conclusion, promoting the satisfying aspects of how both science and religion enrich our lives.  But the movie opted to raise the erroneous belief that science is at war with religion.

The film performs at about the level of a made-for-TV movie.  It was not bad.  Technical direction, lighting, all the basics were there.  Good direction and camera work overall.
And I was really excited about the plot.  Harry Anderson came off very well.  He can still act, and I was engaged by his characterization.

The prank performed near the beginning of the film was great; a clean, college-level game of semantics.  But the outcome of the film failed to acknowledge such a semantic difference with its posturing of evolution and religion upon opposing pedestals.

!!!Spoiler alert!!!!
It was after the father met with the student who told him about the previous professor and offered him help, that I realized the plot was headed down the road of the stereotyped Christian underdog.  It was perfectly reasonable to cast the father as an unskilled debater who felt passionately about his faith so much so that he was called to speak out against something he thought was potentally damaging to his daughter.
And I liked it that the daughter later pointed out that it was the professor that challenged the father to the debate, not the other way around.
It was also perfectly reasonable that Harry Anderson's character was not perfect, and did not win the debate at the end.
But there was nothing proven about the jock's intent that he was determined to deflower the daughter.  He said he was going to ""make his move"", which could have been nothing more than getting to first, or even second, base (there are still bases, right?).
Rather than becoming a consoling argument for the benefit of faith, then film devolved into an attack on science with no mediating resolution between the two.  Faith is always a choice, but in the debate within the film faith must win by allowing the characters to choose to deny science.

The fact that religion is not scientific is not a reason to discount its truthfulness or influence in the lives of human beings.  I thought we were beyond the Science v. Religion debate, at least in the United States, but apparently we are not.  The majority of scientists in the U.S. and other countries are religious people.  They have no conflict separating what they can test, prove, and categorize for the benefit of humankind with respect to the physical world and that which they ~choose~ to believe without proof thereby requiring faith.
Evolution is no more an opponent of religion than biology is an opponent of love.  We say both biology and love are real, and there are a few things which might overlap in our understanding of them, but they are separate things which are both immensely valuable to humankind.  Unfortunately, this movie is not, but could have been.",1459728000,,3280,4.792184724689165

Evolution does not say anything about the creation of the universe or the beginning of life. It does not say that the apes as we know them now gave birth to humans as we know them now. It does not say that one species becomes another within a generation or that one species gives birth to another in a generation. It does not say that an entire species becomes another so the previous species dies out (monkeys continue to evolve just as humans do). It does not say an ape gave birth to a human, it does not say that a horse gave birth to a dog or that there was a creature who was half duck half crocodile. If you are going to talk about evolution please find out what it was--and not on a creationist website. If you're going to argue against something take the time to find out what it actually is.

Every argument in this movie is against a strawman version of evolution that isn't what it actually says.

Who is to say what else God created when making this Earth full of wonders? And who are we to try and put limits upon what he could or could not have done? Who are we to ask whether he cares or not?

7388430,3,B014DEGU52,"Over all it is decent quality movie & fair entertainment though it got mixed reactions from our Christian family members who come from  Baptist & Evangelical Free Covenant denominational backgrounds.
The diverseness of Christian denominational/doctrinal views was not taken into account & so clumped all Christians together. Likewise all scientific findings & hypothesis were grouped together.
The movie does a good job of showing that the average Christian doesn't really know how to debate their faith, which should encouarge Christians to really
scrutinize their beliefs & ask themselves why DO I believe this  because every Christian should be able to give reason for why they believe. In the same vein,every Christian should not expect their opinions on evolution, the big bang, old earth or young earth creationism to be taken as valid if they haven't even studied them, themselves.
 In the movie, too many Christians immediately put up thier righteous outraged crusader sheilds at the first wiff of possible scientific blasphemy as if they forgot that
science must be compatible with faith as God made creation & invites us to study it. Sadly, it's not super clear in the movie that they aren't grouping science along with the villain.
The biggest hindrance to alot of evangelism is that Christians come across ignorant of why they believe & what valid scientific theories actually exist. This movie presents Christians that seem to have forgotten that the Bible tells us that people won't be won over by a well given argument, but by love & that we are to correct those in error with gentleness & love.",1456099200,8,1610,5.090909090909091

7388436,5,B014DEGU52,"Loved this rebuttal of evolution. Really can the finely tuned conditions that support life have happened by accident? I don't think so by factors of millions. ( I can't remember the math but it is so unlikely.) And could the complex information in DNA be an accident too. Information that complex requires a designer just like a watch. Also there are  missing links in the fossil record, that show evolution occurs within a species. This doesn't reveal about the bones of supposed human precursors which someone put together to look more like an ape. I was a biology major that started to question evolution after I got saved. I did a 180 in my private life and began to learn about how science like the universe reveals God. In Romans chapter 1 it says man will have no excuse in the day of judgement because God can be known simply by what He has created.",1453939200,5,857,4.529032258064516

This is not just an evolution versus creationist movie....it is built on the premise that we can argue and debate all day about evolution...but ultimately everyone is going to believe what they want....it takes faith to believe that God created the earth and it also takes faith to believe that the earth and all its elements and species just evolved to its present form. Ultimately, the individual who really wants to know the truth has to ask himself.....what are the consequences of my faith and what I believe? Clarence Gilyard's character does a nice job of giving us that choice....""By faith, I choose to side with what God says"". That is the ultimate foundation upon which we build our lives....upon whom or what do we choose to put our faith?  Great movie with a great message!",1451692800,3,946,4.664670658682635

7388443,5,B014DEGU52,"Saw this in the movie theater and I wasn't sure exactly what to expect. I came away amazed because it was truly a very entertaining movie that makes you think. It's not really preachy but it has a solid Christian message. I think anyone would enjoy this movie since it's not so evangelical that it turns you off, or you lose the story or the plot. The writers use a milder tone and that makes their message come through and lets you decide for yourself. That's why I highly recommend this as a great film anyone can enjoy..... PLUS.....

The acting was terrific and the writing was superb. The cinematography is excellent too. The writers present both sides of the evolution vs creation argument very well and in a most interesting way. This story is told through the eyes of Christian daughter Rachel who goes off to college and takes a Biology class with a popular professor who teaches evolution and her Dad gets upset. It's got some good drama and interesting college moments as Rachel tries to adapt to college life and her Dad fears she's losing her way.

I have told my friends to go see this film, and get this DVD. It's great for your family and friends to watch and sit around and talk about afterwards. I know you'll like it. All my friends have raved about it. So I enthusiastically recommend you get the DVD and watch it.",1449273600,5,1334,4.48559670781893

8730343,2,B014DEGU52,"As a Christian who believes God is the cause of the universe existing, I still cringe at everything this perhaps well intentioned film depicts:
The dad is irrationally put off finding out his daughter is being exposed to theoretical ideas about evolution in a college biology class. Its completely ridiculous to assume that by taking biology in college she wouldn't be learning about that or similar theories sooner or later, regardless of how it might be received. For anyone who is not a fundamentalist Christian watching, this sends such a bad message of what Christianity is, making all Christians appear to be close-minded and frankly, immature.
Evan as a character greater bothered me alsp-he was intolerant of the very idea of anyone having different beliefs from himself, and Rachel's apology concerning her ""opposition"" to him? What? As if actually thinking differently necessities an apology. Perhaps for someone who isn't willing to have any thoughts outside of his own, but otherwise that's kinda messed up.
I strongly disagree with how Christianity in general was portrayed in this film-intolerant, self-pitying and rather ignorant. Unlike the conclusion made at the end, there are scientific proofs that can be made surrounding the existence of God, and faith in Him can also mesh with things like the Big Bang Theory. God created the world, and it can suffice to say there are scientific as well as spiritual proofs He did. This film just perptuates stereotypes about Christians and atheists alike that will satisfy fundamentalists at the expense of using a film outlet that could have promoted truth to a bigger audience.",1531872000,,1637,5.157894736842105

8730349,2,B014DEGU52,"This movie presents both evolution and the bible from a profound lack of understanding of either.  For example, evolution, as Darwin presented it, says absolutely nothing about how inanimate chemistry becomes biology, yet this movie dwells on this and asserts that evolution does address this when in fact it does not.  Furthermore, there really is no basis for taking the early chapters of Genesis as literally true in every respect - rather, we see the creation story through the eyes of an older culture that richly uses allegory, symbolism and metaphor to communicate great truths which were never meant to be put under a scientific microscope - at least, not without very great care.  For example, why six days of creation and not nine?  Is there something God wishes to communicate using the number six?  Also used symbolically in other bible verses, six is used in a manner similar to how we use the number ten in judging precision or perfection - when something is complete and lacking nothing, we assign the number ten.  So Genesis is doing something similar, which is reinforced when God pronounces his work to be ""very good"".  Faith is never intended to be blind, which this movie implies all too often.  Faith should always be based on something substantial - as stated in Hebrews 11:1 - ""faith is [confidence] in what we hope for and [assurance] about what we do not see"".  Examples of ""needing proof"", or assurance, are found throughout the bible and show that God never intended for us to believe without good reason.  For example, check out the witness by Thomas in John's gospel...",1514246400,,1598,4.841911764705882

8730351,1,B014DEGU52,"I'm a Christian, unapologetic about it and passionate for my faith. Of the many things I am called to as a Christian, one is truthfulness. Even if I disagree with what someone else believes, I cannot knowingly lie consistently with my faith. That is the principal reason why this movie is so troubling for me as a person of faith. From beginning to end it distorts, misrepresents and flat out lies about what contemporary evolutionary biology proposes as the best explanation for the diversity of organisms on earth. I have no problem with someone making a film about what they believe, even if unpopular. But you lose all credibility if you do so by slandering and lying about those you disagree with. This film, whatever its feel good nature, does that.

Not once in this film is evolutionary biology even presented. I've no objections to people making movies about their own beliefs, but at least have the decency to represent your opponents accurately and fairly. The ""evolutionist"" is a set piece, someone who sets up ridiculously easy targets that ""common sense"" can knock down (the film makes no demands on its viewers to do any actual science). The climactic debate at the end opens with the creationist giving the opening statement, so that the ""evolutionist"" is immediately on the defensive and we still don't even know what evolutionary biology is. Through the whole movie the basic ideas debate are discussed at a high level of generality, even when it comes to faith.

Worse, the creationist dad clearly has the wrong impression about what evolutionary biology asserts. We hear throughout the film about how evolution is a theory about the origin of life (it's not), about which person in your family tree is a monkey (humans don't descend from monkeys), and about how evolution teaches that the egg came before the chicken, and that chickens evolved from eggs (what?!). Oh, and apparently we're still evolving and who knows what we'll be like in a 100 years. All of these asserts are elementary errors about evolutionary biology, but it serves to make the ""defeat"" of the science at the end more impressive. Rather than treating evolutionary biology as the dominant theory in our best science, it's routinely portrayed as some kind of strange speculation that some biology professors indoctrinate their students with as part of an agenda, teaching as fact something that is utter fiction, and the Christian characters are regularly mystified that ""the Bible's view"" is not being taught in the public university as an alternative. It's embarrassing, to be honest. The final straw for me was the utterly unrealistic portrait of university life. I've been in college for nearly 15 years, and I recognized very little of the exciting, stimulating culture of new ideas and different perspectives. This whole thing felt fabricated by people who had no idea about what real university life is like, and who are fearful of anyone who does not believe what they believe. Be passionate about Christ and scripture, by all means, but appreciate that others are passionate about what they believe too. If you want people to listen to you, first learn how to listen to others.",1507766400,3,3176,4.956848030018762
