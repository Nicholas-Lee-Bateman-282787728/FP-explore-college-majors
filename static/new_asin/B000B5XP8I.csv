2401776,5,B000B5XP8I,"I live in Guatemala, and this low budget film was filmed here, for us it is a little jewel",1412294400,,90,3.789473684210526
2401777,5,B000B5XP8I,"My interest in getting this movie was spawned from reading in the credits of ""Tarzan and the green Goddess"". In the credits it called ""Tarzan and the green Goddess"" the sequel to  ""The New Adventures of Tarzan"" this is not accurate. This movie if released today would be called "" Tarzan & the green Godess the Extended version"" a technique made popular by peter Jackson to make as much off a movie as possible. That being said what do you get if you buy this Tarzan adventure, well for starters E.R.B's was dissatisfied with the way his character was being portrayed by Hollywood so he formed his own production company & went to work trying to give the public the Tarzan he created! This is the longest Tarzan adventure ever made its 3.8 hours long. It was originaly released as short chapter clift hangers so don't think for a minute that those 3.8 hours are boreing or full of filler it is as action packed as it could possibley be. Herman Brix is better remembered as Bruce Bennett later starring in films such as The Treasure of the Sierra Madre & many others. It is easy to see why E.R.B's like Herman Brix playing the lord of the jungle when you see his build, he is not hugely muscled like a body builder but he is by no means small either. His body is ripped, in the many action shots you can see his muscles ripple like steal cables under his skin I don't think the man carried a single ounce of body fat. I think any Tarzan fan owes it to their selfs to get this D.V.D & see the articulate intelligent Tarzan E.R.B's wrote him to be, So what do you get when you buy this D.V.D. you get the longest most action packed Tarzan adventure that has the seal of approval of the author that created Tarzan!!!  Can a true Tarzan fan ask for more than that?",1367020800,11,1758,4.324242424242424
2401778,5,B000B5XP8I,Herman Brix has played a Tarzan that is pretty close from the one described in the books. It is very pleasant to watch. The disc was in perfect condition and delivered on time. Thanks,1361145600,,183,4.411764705882353
2401779,4,B000B5XP8I,"Herman Brix (Bruce Bennett) (who is said to have been MGM's original choice for the ape man until he injured himself before production began on ""Tarzan the Apeman"") will always be my favorite live action Tarzan (closely followed by Gordon Scott in his final 2 Tarzan films) because out of all the sound film Tarzans he is most like the hero who appeared ERB's novels.  And it is for his performance alone that I rate this serial so highly.  That being said ""The New Adventures of Tarzan"" is far from being the best Tarzan film ever made.  That honor would go to MGM's second epic ""Tarzan and his Mate"".  Still as crudely made as New Adventures is it is still worth viewing if you are a fan of Tarzan and the films made based on him.

For too many years this serial could only be viewed as the two condensed feature films ""New Adventures of Tarzan"" and ""Tarzan and the Green Goddess"" where Brix was now billed as Bruce Bennett versions derived from it so it is very good to now be able to view the film as it was originally presented.  The plot involves Tarzan's trip to Guatemala to search for his lost friend D'Arnot (an ERB creation who has rarely been portrayed on film) and to help some explores located an idol that contains a fortune in jewels and a secret formula for a powerful explosive before the bad guys do.

Independently financed ""New Adventures"" is made with none of the polish that MGM's less faithful takes on the ape man presented and moves at a snail's pace. The sound quality of the film has always been poor (this is apologized for in the opening credits) even before its transfer to home media because the serial was filmed on location in the jungles of Guatemala.  The fight scenes are large scale but out of control with people running about too often like chickens with their heads cut off lacking any of the style found in a Republic serial of the same period. Very bad comedy relief (why did so many 30's and 40's adventure film require the need of comedy relief?) is provided by a little known actor named Lewis Sargent as George who is referred to as a flunky in the credits

On the plus side ""New Adventures"" does have Brix  playing an educated Tarzan as he was in the books performing his own action stunts like swinging on on actual vines without special  effects to aid him  as in the MGM films and actually busting ropes by expanding his chest.  This rope bursting scene seems to take forever in an already static film because Brix is actually using his great body strength to do it.

Other things to look for in the film are Brix's version of the ape man's yell which is nothing like the MGM version and much more weird.  Also Tarzan is accompanied by his sometimes companion from the novels Nkima who is here portrayed as a chimp and not as ERB's monkey.  Strangely enough on viewing the complete serial one gets the impression that Nkima doesn't survive the adventure because after a ship board explosion he doesn't seem to appear again.

There are many legends surrounding this film  such as ERB's actual involvement in the production.  It is said that he actually selected Brix for the role as Tarzan which I believe and had a hand in writing the script which I don't.  Also it is said that MGM put a lot of pressure on distributors and theaters owners not to run this serial so that would not compete with their version of Tarzan but I wonder if all powerful MGM would have actually worried about this low budget serial and did MGM still have the rights to Tarzan at the time this film was made. Another story that I have heard is that because the producers ran out of money before the film was complete Brix was never paid for his work on it.

At the price being asked ""The New Adventures of Tarzan"" is well worth the money being asked to complete your Tarzan collection.  If you have never seen it before just do go into expecting anything like the popular image of Tarzan.",1341273600,4,3915,4.453781512605042
2401780,4,B000B5XP8I,"First let me address Herman Brix's performance. Johnny Weismuller is and in my mind always will be THE Tarzan. First runner up in my opinion is Gordon Scott. Brix is the third best Tarzan on my personal list and is probably the best representation of ERB's original character.

The story is good. It takes place mostly in South America where it was filmed. The storyline is very much like a story Burroughs would have written. Every chapter is filled with action, ends and cliffhangers, and features plenty of the Tarzan vs. jungle animals scenes that made Tarzan books and films entertaining to begin with.

Finally the quality. Is the film digitally restored? No. Is it as good as you can hope for in a 30s serial? Yes. It is not always clear but is easily watchable. The lack of restoration and the fact that the DVD glitches between chapters 11 and 12, forcing me to jump straight to chapter 12 from the main menu, gives this a 4 star rating.

For Tarzan fans this is a good buy. For people who only show a passing interest in Tarzan I suggest checking out the first two Weismuller films (Tarzan the Ape Man and Tarzan and His Mate) or the last two Gordon Scott films ( Tarzan's Greatest Adventure and Tarzan the Magnificent).

2401781,5,B000B5XP8I,I had seen this movie when I was around 12 years old and I really wanted to see it again. I wanted to feel the excitement I felt then and believe me it was almost the same. Thank you for still bringing us something to remember.,1272931200,3,227,3.9565217391304346

8082015,3,B000B5XP8I,"This production might best be described as quaint.  Herman Brix, aka Bruce Bennett,  later of Mildred Pierce and Treasure of the Sierra Madre, stands out from an otherwise no name cast, does a good job as Tarzan.  It's a shame he missed the opportunity to star in MGM'S Tarzan the Apeman,  I think he might have lasted as long in the role as Johnny  Weismuller.  The Guatemala locations are passable but due to lack of budget are never fully realized.  This is interesting because it's the only ERB interpretation of the character of Tarzan between the end of the Silent era and the early sixties. Could have been better, but still a noble effort.",1518048000,,647,4.62280701754386
