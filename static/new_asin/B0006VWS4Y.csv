8043619,2,B0006VWS4Y,"I was expecting this DVD to be more on the lines of ""7 Radiohead Television Commercials"" but the videos were badly transferred and pixelated.  But worst of all, most of the music on this DVD are clips--not even the full songs, so you start to get into it and then its over.  After each clip, they put a commercial in there for Radiohead TV...they are just awful...The only reason I didn't give this 1 star is because there are a few complete songs on there, but not enough (like 3 though I can't remember the exact #). It's not worth $30+ for 3 songs...",1154649600,,553,4.3076923076923075
8043620,4,B0006VWS4Y,"The thought of Radiohead being given the opportunity to make a t.v. show is pretty open ended. None the less, this dvd did take me by surprise. I thought it was great, but i didn't like how videos only used parts of songs. The bonus stuff is great, and the recording process footage is very interesting. But its hard to watch a movie to a song that you know, but have the movie only use part of the song. But it was definately worth the money, and the wait to get here. Any radiohead fan could not complain.",1138320000,,507,4.183673469387755
8043621,4,B0006VWS4Y,"typical radiohead craziness with really cool animation and film shorts that make the viewer feel like they are on drugs, this is not a radiohead live show nor a documentary but rather a collection of segments that were originally on radiohead tv.  there is very few band shots except weird interviews and disorted images of radiohead playing.  my favorite is the homeland hoedown part, it's genius. if you enjoy things that make you think and like radiohead then you will enjoy the most gigantic lying mouth of all time, if not watch out for pop idol and get your request into trl.",1114646400,7,581,4.686274509803922
8043622,1,B0006VWS4Y,"I JUST WANT A LIVE DVD !!!!

Radiohead is fantastic, extraordinary, different, dark, intense, addictive, magic, confusing, avant garde, experimental, etc. Nothing of that is reflected with these stupid DVD's they have released. This king of DVD just contain lame boring stuff for filling the running Time and to be put on sale.

I do not understand why they do not make an awesome live DVD instead of this kind of s**t. Radiohead is brilliant, but sometimes they are too obstinate and they do not understand - or they do not want to understand - that fans we are not interested in these useless DVD's for TV filled with pointless video commercials and all that bulls**t.

Live Gigs always have been the best thing of Radiohead. There're dozens of complete live performances shared as Pro-Shot DVD bootlegs out there !!!!, but I want an official release !!!.

PLEASE RADIOHEAD",1111104000,18,875,4.852348993288591
8043623,5,B0006VWS4Y,"Two words... Freak Juice! Oh, and ""free petrol"" as well!  This DVD is a collection of brilliant work - the videos are extraordinary expressions of the music of Radiohead.  It's not a documentary along the lines of ""Meeting People is Easy"", it's more like ""7 Television Commercials"" in that it is videos put to Radiohead's work, or video of them performing, and a few funny interviews with band members.  There are four ""episodes"" with introductions by ""Chieftan Mews"".  Episodes 1 - 3 were originally available on the radiohead.tv web site (no longer there), while Episode 4 is an addition for this DVD release.

I love everything on this disc, but some of the highlights and my very favorites include: the two pieces directed by Juan Pablo Etcheverry  -""De Tripas Y Corazon"" (Where I End And You Begin) [Ep. 2] & ""Dog Interface"" (Fast Track) [Ep. 4];  ""The Cat Girl"" (2 + 2 = 5) [Ep. 1];  ""The Scream"" (No Surprises) [Ep. 2]; ""Chickenbomb"" [Ep. 4]; and you gotta love the satire of ""The Homeland Hoedown"" [Ep. 4]!

The crowning achievement, however, has got to be Johnny Hardstaff's Push Pulk / Spinning Plates video [Ep. 3].  In my opinion, it captures the essence of these songs - and it has to be the most disturbing thing you'll see in quite a while.

As a Radiohead fan, it's great to see & hear some of the unreleased & non-album (b-sides etc.) material too.  If only they had included that catchy music that used to play online between radiohead.tv episodes (even catchier than ""The most Gigantic Theme"")... ah well.

Yes, this material might be considered ""avant garde"" or ""weird"".... However, it should really get you thinking, and how often do videos and music get you doing that nowadays?",1107648000,20,1700,4.722033898305085
8043624,5,B0006VWS4Y,"okay, i just watched this wierd freakin' ""movie"".  i liked it, though it didn't have as much of radiohead members as i would've liked.  oh well, it's about videos, i guess. and they are pretty...special, or unique.  some are pretty good, some are decent.  none are bad.  i liked the behind the scenes type stuff about the band, but there wasn't enough, but i guess i can't have everything.  overall, i enjoyed The Most Gigantic Lying Mouth of All Time, though i think that i still like Radiohead's other dvd, Meeting People is Easy, more than Lying Mouth.  it just felt a lot more...whole, well rounded.  but Lying Mouth isn't supposed to be well-rounded or wholesome, i think it's supposed to make you uneasy,at least that's the impression i got from it. i mean, there is nothing disgusting or grotesque in this collection of wierd videos, it's just unsettling.  there are some pretty funny parts in it, too. like the interview with a mutated voice Thom Yorke and Ed O'Brien.  and the ""host"" Chieftan Mews, is just plain...amusing.  so, i guess, buy this somewhat hard to come by dvd if you're a big radiohead fan, if you're not however, then why the hell are you reading reviews for a Radiohead product.  buy it, it's good, but not as good as Meeting People is Easy.  it's different, let that be your warning.",1106006400,8,1311,4.623376623376624
