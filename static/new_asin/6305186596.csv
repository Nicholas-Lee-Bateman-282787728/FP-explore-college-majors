977774,5,6305186596,"THE MIKADO and THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE are the only Gilbert and Sullivan operas filmed for theatrical release.  The latter is based on the Joseph Papp Broadway production that starred Linda Ronstadt and Kevin Kline.  MIKADO is populated by many principals and a chorus which performed with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company for years before the 1939 release was filmed at Pinewood Studios in England.  Martyn Green and Sydney Granville could not be better choices for Ko-Ko and Poo-Bah respectively.  Kenny Baker, the lone American in the cast, was selected to play Nanki-Poo.  This was undoubtedly done to help boost the U.S. movie box office.  Baker is somewhat lost amongst all the English actors, but he  is thoroughly likeable and has a wonderful tenor voice.  The sets and costumes are lavish, the supporting cast is excellent,  and the overall result is a well directed first class production.  Many songs are left out of the film to keep it in the usual 1:40 minute range, but this helps to move the action along without any slow spots.",1465776000,,1041,4.863636363636363

977780,5,6305186596,"Frustratingly cut, this classic movie records Martyn Green's finest performance as Koko. The Blu ray disk is beautifully restored, full of detail and saturated color. The sets and costumes are lavish. In some ways this is as beautiful as ""The Wizard of Oz."" It contains the ""lost"" performance of ""I've got a little list,"" though not incorporated into the movie proper. The liberties with the original have been discussed elsewhere and must be accepted to enjoy this performance, but if you are prepared to enjoy it, this disk is the best rendering I've seen of the movie.

977907,3,6305186596,"I love Gilbert and Sullivan as the social critics they are; and The Mikado is chock full of criticism (and sarcasm), as well as fun songs. It tells us a great deal about Victorian England and very little about Japanese people. Some of G&S's great ""silly people"" are in this show, including: Pooh-Bah, Pish-Tush and the lovely Yum Yum.. This particular version, though, seems to leave out many scenes I know by heart. It becomes hard to follow the story; even when you have been watching and listing to it for 55 years. The actors are good; the band is good. The whole story, which probably could have made it twice as long, would have been nice.",1440720000,2,645,4.521367521367521

I'm sure most of this is because the film was made in the late 30s, but I just didn't enjoy it at all.  Admittedly, I only watched the first half hour.  Couldn't watch anymore.

Destroyed the whole tone of what was a comedic social comment on English societal culture with a Japanese overlay.

Songs being cut or mangled isn't the issue on this one.

978264,4,6305186596,An odd production of the Gilbert & Sullivan play made in 1939 amid the Hollywood glamour years and this reflects it.  While from the title and story line it has an Asian theme the film is clearly Hollywood Asian.  The story and the performances are entertaining however.  The plot has twists not unlike a Shakespearean play and the underlying sarcasm adds to the charm.  A little slow to start but worth watching.,1413158400,,413,4.694444444444445

978268,5,6305186596,"This is one of my favorite operetta's from my childhood. In these days of DVDs and video streaming, we have a benefit that I did not have when I was a kid hearing my mother, along with other musicians from Springfield, Ohio, put on operas and operettas when I was growing up (Springfield Civic Opera). When Mom sang the role of the Wicked Witch in Hansel and Gretel, it was my favorite, but The Mikado was one of my second-favorites. I wish I could remember what part she sang. (Some of them are easier to remember, Mom was the Student Prince in ""The Student Prince.""

HINT: Turn the captions on. There will be times that it will be easier to understand the arias and other music and dialogue when you can look at the bottom of the screen.

ALSO: don't be afraid to watch an opera TWICE because I guarantee you, the movie is better the second time around. I'm in the middle of my second watch-through (two days later) as I revise my review.

FINALLY: Do not base your decision about whether to watch this on the first ten minutes. It gets much funnier as you get further into the movie.

INTRO: The young prince is being forced to marry an old ugly member of his father's, the emperor's, court. Instead he runs away, pretending to be a minstrel. The rest of the operetta takes place in a funny small town with one character (note I don't say actor) with many titles, which comes in handy when a document needs to be signed by multiple people. That rogue is many of those titles.

This is an old film from 1939, but it is still delightful. If you can't get into it in the first few minutes, let it play in the background while you do other things. It will get much better as you get into it and see how all of the characters develop, then start it over again and the beginning will make even more sense. Operas are the type of production that seeing it two or three times really does make it better.

I wish we still had the audio (old reel-to-reel) tapes from those productions. I'd love to be able to play them now.

But I can play old movies and other copies, and imagine my mother singing one of the parts.",1409875200,,2109,4.297229219143577

978406,4,6305186596,"If you're a Mikado fan, you won't want to miss this early production.  Martyn Green's performance as Ko-Ko is especially delicious, but the whole cast is wonderful.  So too, the camera work, which manages to make this classic theatrical production a film treat.

The only drawback, is that the chorus songs are generally too rushed, and some of the songs are cut out.  Could be the age of the recording rendered the music a tad too fast most of the time. Even so, this is a delightful production perfect for the way it's shot and filmed.  Quite amazing, really: they wouldn't have a chance to do more than one take, for most of the shots.

PS: Mikado, like most of Gilbert & Sullivan's works, is meant to poke fun at then-current English society via thinly-disguised formats.  Here, using the typical prejudices folks then had against Japanese culture.  To the modern politically-correct mind, a production like this appears to be insulting.  Yes, it is: of one's OWN culture, not the ostensible one depicted.",1403395200,,1009,4.819767441860465

The costuming and staging is quite funny.  Some of the acting might be stilted from the young lead actor, but some of the other actors are natural and brilliant.  Music and staging are great.

This part doesn't show him off to as much advantage as that of the Lord High Chancellor in Iolanthe (I saw a live performance - unfortunately this has never been released on any recorded media that I'm aware of.)

978749,5,6305186596,"The 1939 British-made version of Gilbert & Sullivan's THE MIKADO features Irish tenor Kenny Baker as Nanki-Poo (the wand'ring minstrel). Baker was the original singer on Jack Benny's radio program.

What makes this particular Mikado superb is not only its luscious Technicolor photography but Martyn Green, who here is Koko. Green was widely considered the best Gilbert & Sullivan interpreter outside of the original 19th Century D'Oyly Carte cast. His marvelous Koko alone is worth the price of admission! HIGHEST recommendation.

Some of my favorite numbers from this DVD include:

A Wand'ring Minstrel I
Were you not to Ko-Ko plighted
Finale Act I
Here's a how-de-do
On a tree by a river

Criterion has done their usual outstanding job of bringing rare and major cinematic works to home entertainment with their trademark high-definition digital transfer system which makes historic classics look and feel brand new and alive. Criterion is not just simply a top of the line distributer, but a institution to be revered and admired for their service to humanity and it's culture.
  whatever the merits this film has (or hasn't) as a adaptation, it more than compensates with beautiful production values and photography. the shotened adaptation also suceeds in quickening the pacing of the film as cinema.

978925,3,6305186596,"I went into this with high hopes, as the Criterion Collection usually does more than justice to restorations of great older films.

But I was terribly shocked by (1) the abbreviated version of the G & S score, cutting some of the best songs; and (2) the terrible miscasting of Kenny Baker as Nanki-Poo, who appears to have wandered in from another planet as an avatar of Perry Como.  His voice is cloying, to the say least, and is a ""pop crooner"" voice totally unsuited to The Mikado.  Compare, for isntance, Bonaventura Bottome in the English National Opera version (with Eric Idle).  The fact that he speaks with an American accent and has a very American ""gee whiz"" manner throw off-key the whole movie.

The main merits of the blu-ray are the beautiful high definition restoration of the original pastel costumes and sets, as well as the fine comic supporting turns by members of the D'Oyly Carte Company.",1339545600,2,909,4.727848101265823

978927,4,6305186596,"I will make it clear up front that I have no patience with 'purists' or 'definitive versions' - ""purists"" kill art and ""definitive versions"" embalm it.

Having said that, I rated this vintage film a very solid four stars rather than five in deference to those who are experts on G&S and The Mikado and in respect of their feelings.  But, I liked it!  I really, really liked it.

I'm easily influenced by interesting art direction, sets and costumes, and I loved the varied color palette of this production (not locked into Technicolor primaries, much as I love 'em) and the never-never land it portrays.

The musical component, understandably of major importance with G&S, was very pleasing and entertaining. Since I'm NOT an expert, this is of paramount importance to me.

The performances, including those of reknown in G&S circles, were very fine, humorous and attractive.  Even Kenny Baker, who I had been lead to believe would be horribly distracting, wasn't.  I thought he was fine and to a non-purist, very enjoyable. (His coifure and make-up was a bit distracting, attributable to the age of the film I suppose, but I chose to rise above small irritations.)

All in all, I thought it was a very interesting and entertaining film.  I love multiple versions and re-interpretations of classic works (although I'm unaccountably harsh regarding your average 'remake'.  Go figure!) and I wouldn't say this is the only Mikado you need ever hear or see, but I would say, if you enjoy this kind of thing, it is a worthwhile version to include in your film viewing history.

I enjoyed it quite a bit and it is a fine introduction to a classic work and an interesting take for the more experienced viewer.  A very solid FOUR STARS!",1314144000,2,1728,4.777777777777778
978928,5,6305186596,"If you can have only one DVD of ""The Mikado"" in your collection, this is the one to have.  Even if you have a dozen of this Gilbert & Sullivan operetta, you need this one.  It is an adaptation (approved by Richard D'Oyly Carte) that changes the beginning by dramatizing earlier events that the original handles neatly in a musical number, it gives some of Yum-Yum's music to Kenny Baker, reduces Katisha to a plot device, and cuts one of the best-known patter songs because after it was filmed an editor turned it into bizarre propaganda.  Counterbalancing those points, the film preserves the timeless, classic performances of Martyn Green as Ko-Ko and Sidney Granville as Pooh-Bah, and the final result is satisfying G & S.  The Criterion release is technically superior to a previous release from Image Entertainment, and its extras include the deleted patter song, ""I've got a little list.""  This is ""innocent merriment"" at its best.",1306454400,5,937,4.905063291139241

One article I once read said that ""I've got a little list"" was omitted because people knew it so well. If that's true, then the producer was a major idiot. If anything, the film is worth seeing for even a bit of Green plus Kenny Baker. Baker's recordings are only of light popular music so having his bright tenor in something approaching classical is a treat. Too bad he didn't get to at least try his hand at Nemorino or Almaviva - on records.",1305936000,2,601,4.280701754385965
978930,5,6305186596,"Before purchasing, I read a few reviews of this new Blu-ray restoration of the 1939 film of Gilbert & Sullivan's ""The Mikado."" I had seen the movie (in black & white) when I was in grade school, and then in bad color prints many years later, including the VHS and first DVD versions. The Blu-ray reviews were very positive, and I can't disagree with them at all. The film has been beautifully restored and the print looks fabulous. The operetta is severely trimmed, unfortunately, and an unnecessary and somewhat confusing preface has been added to the story, but what's here is exceedingly well done. It's essentially a filmed version of what the D'Oyly Carte company was doing at the time, but with costumes and decor re-designed especially for the film. Ko-Ko's list song, cut in the U.S. and missing from prints for many years, is included as a bonus, along with an interview with Mike Leigh, director of ""Topsy Turvy.""",1305504000,8,923,4.775

My one disapointment is the deletion of the song ""I've got him on my list"", which is however shown as a deleted scene.  The song was apparently left out as one of the people on the list was Hitler & being as the film was made in 1939 & the USA was still trying to avoid being embroiled in WW2, I imagine it was thought politic at the time to omit the reference.

Something I was surprised to see was an introductory act actually showing the reason why the Mikado's son ran away from court, (complete with daughter-in-law elect).

This is the first Criterion edition I have viewed & the extras including a rather scholarly talk by G&S  experts, I found very interesting & informative. So for those of you who enjoy Gilbert & Sullivan this is recommended.",1304812800,,967,4.410112359550562
979101,5,6305186596,"The Mikado recently on released on Blu-ray was fun romp that the family enjoyed. The color was bright and crisp.  The songs are timeless (though sadly the kids remembered the ""Three Little Maids"" song from an episode of The Simpsons).  As a small bonus for those wanting to really to see the lyrical genius at work behind the Mikado, you can turn on the English subtitles and catch the little phrases that you may miss in some of the songs.  As usual Criteron has a number of other bonus features for viewers:

*Newly remastered digital transfer (with uncompressed monaural soundtrack on the Blu-ray edition)

*New video interviews with Topsy-Turvy director Mike Leigh and Mikado scholars Josephine Lee and Ralph MacPhail Jr.

*Short silent film promoting the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's 1926 stage performance of The Mikado

*Deleted scene with Ko-Ko's ""I've Got a Little List"" song

*Excerpts from 1939 radio broadcasts of the stage productions The Swing Mikado and The Hot Mikado

*A booklet featuring an essay by critic Geoffrey O'Brien

The film captures a moment in Hollywood that we can never return to.  Large, beautiful, happy musical numbers and wonderfully costumed actors.  The costumes and the sets of the movie all suggest the Mikado's stage origins.

However there is a certain sense of innocense (or naivete) in the picture.  The Japanese are highly stylized and are not portrayed in particularly pleasant light.  The plot kicks off when the ruler decides the town hasn't had enough beheadings lately, so finding a suitable candidate kicks off the love triangle action (Remember the Mikado's origins are in the Victorian period).

I would never suggest censoring or changing this masterpiece for the sake of political correctness. And I think everyone will benefit from being exposed to the beauty and pagentry of the Mikado as it is preserved forever through old Hollywood. However, situating the film and its stage origins for younger viewers may be helpful.

Overall, the Mikado will grace any home's film collection.  It is educational for viewers unfamiliar with Gilbert & Sullivan.  And it is a feast for the eyes and ears of veteran musical buffs.  Highly recommended.",1303344000,2,2192,5.086834733893557
979102,3,6305186596,"...what can we say about this production.  As compared with Sullivan's original, it's awful.  It manages to mutilate the libretto by W.S.Gilbert in ways almost unimaginable.  The reproduction of the Technicolor film borders on the pathetic.  The sound could be worse -- it seems partly restored.

On the other hand, what we have is a partial record of how Sullivan operas were traditionally performed.  The reader may know (but who can say in these days of cultural ignorance?) that Gilbert ruled the D'Oyly Carte productions with an iron hand.  This particularly applied to the comic business.  Changes improving the result were occasionally approved, but not many.  After the death of composer and librettist, D'Oyly Carte continued the same productions, making operas like ""The Mikado"" entertaining museum pieces.

This production embodies much of the old way.  But of course not all of it, since changes and savage cuts deprive us of a complete picture.

Most alarming of the changes is an extended prologue designed to tell the plot's back story.  In fact, this conceit simply muddies the waters.  Once the main performance begins, there is more clarity, since Gilbert is a master at using dialogue to explain all.  However, the cuts are sufficiently savage to allow some confusion to remain.

The trick here, it seems to me, is to enjoy the thing for what it is, and rejoice in seeing how Sullivan's masterpiece was performed for many decades.

The fly in this ointment is that this particular DVD is horrendously expensive, and not worth the mere satisfaction of our curiosity.  There is simply no sense in allowing ourselves to be ripped off in this manner.

Luckily, there is an alternative.  A slimcase DVD pairing the complete version of this film with a complete version of Danny Kaye's brilliant ""The Inspector General"".  This latter is, alas presented in an inferior reproduction.  However, the price makes it worth buying for ""The Mikado"" alone, and you can always get a better presentation of the Kaye film.",1283990400,,2023,5.030120481927711
979103,3,6305186596,"Worth the trip if only for Martyn Green's portrayal of Koko which, although vastly overdone, demonstrates why he has gone down in history as the greatest G&S player ever. Granville's Poohbah is equally fine within the limits of the character's opportunity. The ""prologue"" is useless, and elimination of significant numbers is inexcusable. If Schertzinger thought he could do it better in 90 minutes than G&S did in 120, then he should have written his own opera.",1236211200,,462,5.092105263157895
979104,4,6305186596,"Other reviewers indicate the viewpoint of those familiar with Gilbert and Sullivan. I am not. I do, however, remember with pleasure the light tenor voice of Kenny Baker on the Jack Benny and (later) Fred Allen radio programs. Occasionally, any of us can see him in the Marx Brothers at the Circus, as the singing circus owner or in one of the other numerous films he made in the thirties and early forties. To my regret, I did not get to see him on Broadway with Mary Martin but being given that role indicates professional respect for his abilities. He never reached stardom but always performed well in the light roles to which he was consigned.
I can commend this film to the general viewer who seeks only a pleasant hour and a half of good 1938 technicolor and a lively score well sung. All the performers handle themselves well and the Marxian (Brothers) type of plot makes for appealing nonsense.
All in all, a welcome diversion from the normal mass media fare these days.",1232841600,,978,4.594285714285714
979105,5,6305186596,"The 1939 British-made version of Gilbert & Sullivan's THE MIKADO features Irish tenor Kenny Baker as Nanki-Poo (the wand'ring minstrel). Baker was the original singer on Jack Benny's radio program.

What makes this particular Mikado superb is not only its luscious Technicolor photography but Martyn Green, who here is Koko. Green was widely considered the best Gilbert & Sullivan interpreter outside of the original 19th Century D'Oyly Carte cast. His marvelous Koko alone is worth the price of admission! HIGHEST recommendation.

979106,3,6305186596,"On the plus side: lovely colorful production (saw this on TV in the 1950s, but didn't know it had been photographed in color) and superb performance by Martyn Green (his movements are astounding!).

However, this is a severely truncated version.  Not only are ""I've Got A Little List"" and the hilarious ""There's Beauty In the Bellow of the Blast"" duet between Ko-Ko and Katisha cut, but many other numbers have been shortened.  It's definitely `Mikado - lite.'  Further, there is a long introduction that is simply pointless (which gives one verse of Yum-Yum's lovely second act ""The Sun Whose Rays Are All Ablaze"" to Nanki-Po for no apparent reason).
This is a great tribute to Martyn Green, but some of his best moments were either not filmed or left on the cutting room floor.  It that doesn't turn you on, then choose another Mikado (although all the other choices are sub-par for one reason or another).",1208131200,,908,4.794871794871795

979109,3,6305186596,"This 1938 film of the incomparable operetta has two features which make it worth watching. First of all, the performances of Martyn Green and Sydney Granville from the D'Oyly Carte, though truncated, do G&S proud. Also memorable is the astonishing color photography, an example of the possibilities the relatively new format held for cinematographers. Here the colors resemble the work of a manic artist set free after having been given a new, widely expanded box of paints. And the fairly lurid sets and costumes are a match for this photography. By comparison, those of ""The Wizard of Oz,"" I believe of the same year, look pale and tame.

Otherwise, the production is mediocre at best. Extensive, often non-sensical cuts and other alterations of music and text render the effort a sort of maimed Cliffs' Notes version of the original work.",1197158400,,841,5.007142857142857
979110,3,6305186596,"As a major fan of G&S I was delighted to purchase a Mikado with Martyn Green.  The music acting and singing are all good but, this prodution is missing 2 of the best (in my opinion) songs.  The 2 songs----
""I have a little list"" --who ever heard of G&S production without the patter song  and
""There is beauty in the bellow of the blast""--always a fun number.
So---buyer beware.  I was quite upset, as part of the fun of G&S is knowing what songs are coming and anticipating them.",1195776000,9,480,4.3
979233,5,6305186596,"The Martyn Green 1939 Mikado film is a valuable historical document, and in the end enjoyable, but still not without certain defects.  The foremost of these is the huge number of cuts, listed here in chronological order:

* Much of the Overture (understandable, as it wasn't even written by Sullivan)
* Some of the opening chorus I think, but half of it is run over the opening credits anyway
* Both of Nanki-Poo's recitatives (some of the words of the first one are place in his dialogue with Pish-Tush)
* 2nd verse of Pish-Tush's song, ""Our great Mikado""
* Pooh-Bah's song, ""Young man despair""
* The list song, ""As some day it may happen""
* All but the coda of ""Comes a train of little ladies""
* ""So please you sir, we much regret"" and much of the dialogue preceding it
* ""With aspect stern and gloomy stride"" (the orchestral part is altered in order to skip from the introduction to Pooh-Bah singing ""To ask you what you mean to do we punctually appear"")
* 2nd verse of ""The threatn'd cloud has passed away""
* ""Oh fool that flee-est my Hallow'd joys""
* ""The hour of gladness is dead and gone""
* Katisha's first solo lines in the conclusion of the Act I Finale (""Ye torrents roar""), allowing for the chorus to continue on after they interrupt Katisha.
* Pitti-Sing's solo and the reprise of the main verse in ""Braid the raven hair""
* 2nd verse of ""The sun whose rays are all ablaze.""  Sadly, Yum-Yum's small speech preceding it, which I never fail to enjoy, is also omitted
* 2nd verse of the madrigal, ""Brightly dawns our wedding day"" (this cut is also made in the 1966 film)
* 2nd verse of ""From ev'ry kind of man obedience I expect"" (the daughter-in-law elect thing)
* 1st verse of ""A more humane Mikado""
* ""See how the fates their gifts allot"" and the dialogue concerning Katisha's complexion
* ""Alone and yet alive"" (including ""Hearts do not break"")
* ""There is beauty in the bellow of the blast"" and all of the preceding dialogue
* ""For he's gone and married Yum-Yum"" (They skip straight to ""The threatn'd cloud has passed away"" after Ko-Ko explains himself, and very well too)
* The orchestral reprise of ""There is beauty in the bellow of the blast""

No doubt I have missed something as I have only watched the movie once (I have made no effort to include all of the dialogue cuts)

Regardless, these are the consequences of the various deletions: Katisha's role is cut down to nothing, singing-wise, though she still retains enough dialogue to get her personality across.  And Pitti-Sing's part is chopped down to ""For he's going to marry Yum-Yum"" and her part in ""The criminal cried.""  Peep-Bo almost doesn't exist.  Nanki-Poo and Ko-Ko are the main characters, though they have a few cuts to their roles as well.  The part of the Mikado is trimmed down too, but has the privilege to appear before Act 2 in the ""Prologue"" added to the beginning.  This prologue is okay, but I really don't see how it shortens the length of the opera much.  Precious time is wasted  showing Nanki-Poo walking around Ko-Ko's house, singing nothing but (at one point) ""The sun whose rays are all ablaze"" as a love song to Yum-Yum, who watches from her window.  This seems counterproductive, but there really isn't much one can do about it except skip it.  The movie has a distinct Hollywood flavor during the first bit, but once Ko-Ko enters, things begin to seem more  Gilbert & Sullivan.

Some complain about the ""encores,"" saying they should not have been allowed in the program so as the grant space for fewer deletions.  One must keep in mind, however, that only three minutes are added due to encores (one for ""Here's a how-de-do"" and one for ""The flowers that bloom in the spring"") and they add greatly to this fascinating historical document.  As another reviewer noted, this is one of the few recordings (the only one?) in which the special orchestration of ""The flowers that bloom in the spring"" and Nanki-Poo's cadenza are heard.

As for the performance, it is very good to have Martyn Green's Ko-Ko preserved on video.  He does wonderfully, with many comic touches that are endearing rather than annoying (I like his last fan).  Granville as Pooh-Bah does similarly well, and makes his character's personality come across well.  The way he uses his costume almost as a turtle shell is delightful.  Kenny Baker is a decent Nanki-Poo. His voice isn't as operatic as it should be, though he certainly can hold his breath for a long time (take a gander at the encore to ""The flowers that bloom in the spring"").  Jean Colin as Yum-Yum is good but not memorable as far as singing goes.  John Barclay's Mikado is pretty good, and gives so much more character to the part than, say, his Brent Walker counterpart.

The sound limits all of the singers a bit, but isn't too bad for 1939.

Overall, this is something to watch once or twice, but not own unless you really take a liking to it.  Trying it via interlibrary loan is probably a good idea. Martyn Green is a wonderful Ko-Ko, but with the defects in this recording (primarily the cuts) it probably can't compete with modern versions as a recording of The Mikado.  Rather, it is a recording of what the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company was like in 1939 (to a certain extent).  If you want to see Green in action, this is the only place for it, otherwise, I recommend the more complete 1966 version or even The Brent Walker version (which has issues all its own).

July 2010 EDIT: Since 2007, I have managed to pick up a DVD copy of this wonderful film.  I don't remember laughing so much the first time around!  Also: the DVD has restored part of the prologue that the VHS copy cuts.  The color and film quality in general are also cleaned up a fair bit on the DVD.

Anyway, the 1938 Mikado ended up being so much more enjoyable than I remember it that I'm upping my rating from four stars to five.  Amazing stuff this.",1194998400,38,5862,4.5495238095238095

979241,5,6305186596,"This film is a great adaptation of what's been called the most popular musical of all time...if you are able to accept the edits. In bringing the production to an end at least 30 minutes quicker than a typical stage version, they opted to cut Katisha's role down to a mere plot mechanism, which works fine if it must. In the 1960 TV production, overseen by Martyn Green himself, she didn't even show up until the second act, and it worked just fine (though it did help that she got her two big numbers at the end, which sweetly helped to layer Groucho Marx's under-rehearsed but hilarious Ko-Ko). The other cuts are of lesser-known numbers (the packaging says only one song was omitted!), except for the ""List"" song, and the abrupt and jarring fade to black after Ko-Ko's wonderful entrance sequence indicates that it may have been filmed (as I have seen written) and dropped, either because this was a few years before the official ""banjo"" lyric substitution, or because of some business involving a Hitler image. As great as it is, that song always seems stuck-in (as it was) and counter to Ko-Ko's personality.
  The mouthing of pre-recorded lyrics is exceptionally well-done, and until I read Green's account of lip-synching experiences I wondered if the songs were actually recorded live...he is particularly sharp, especially in the ""Criminal Cried"" sequence. Some of his business seems over-done, especially in the ""encores,"" and inside-jokes like the stubbed-toe bit seem weird and out-of-place (I think the film would have benefited from editing out both encores). But he is the classic Ko-Ko, and his changing motivations and emotions expertly show why this complex character is one of the great characters of the theatre.
  Sydney Granville's Pooh-Bah perfectly calibrates a character that can be very tiresome if presented too one-dimensionally. John Barclay's Mikado is not like the buffoon we're used to, but his ghoulish countenance seems to work here. There is something jarring about the sound of his voice when speaking, however, almost as if it were dubbed by another person. Kenny Baker's Nanki-Poo is fine but, well, his hair is distractingly effeminate.
  As for the prologue, I found it a bit long and frustrating, seeming almost like a pantomime, or even a silent movie. If they had worked the ""Wandering Minstrel"" song in where it should have been, I don't see why they couldn't have avoided it altogether.  In all, however, this is a beautifully shot, very effective adaptation. (And the numbers are much more spirited than the beautiful but flatly-performed ones in ""Topsy Turvy."") There are filmed stage productions out there if you are sensitive to the editing process...enjoy this if nothing else as a historical record, and be grateful it's on DVD!",1058745600,13,2779,5.028260869565218
979242,3,6305186596,"True love never runs smooth in the classic operas of W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan.  When the son of the Mikado of Japan falls in love with the fair Yum-Yum, he must not only out-wit the man she is to wed (Ko-Ko), but the lovesick Katisha and his own father as well. What follows is a tuneful comedy of errors that has become one of the classics of the musical stage.  If nothing else, THE MIKADO has long been regarded as one of the best of the Gilbert & Sullivan creations, with it's sharp satire wedded to the lovely music and Japanese trappings. However, many fans of the Savoy operas have tended to view this 1939 film adapation as somewhat of a mixed bag.  While they appreciated the use of stars from the D'Oyle Carte Opera Company, they didn't enjoy seeing the opera trimmed to fit into a 90 minute time frame.  Having said that, I will state that this version is a solid enough introduction to the classic show, while preserving the great performances of  D'Oyle Carte veterans Sydney Granville and Martyn Green.
Green truly makes the most of his role as the nervous Lord High Executioner, Ko-Ko.  His dances of glee in the ""Here's A How De Do"" number are a great highlight.  In contrast, Granville is the epitome of pompous officialdom as Pooh-Bah, the Lord High Everything Else.  Kenny Baker's Nanki-Poo doesn't quite have the flair of the others, but he's pleasant enough in the role.
In the title role, John Barclay makes an absolutely gleefully ghoulish Mikado.  Some of the costumes are a little strange and the ""prologue"" which basically sets up the story is charming, if a little strange to those familiar with the opera.  If you're a solid G & S fan, you might not appreciate the abridgement, but the performances of Green and Granville are truly classic.....and that alone makes this film worth recommending.",1056672000,51,1831,4.658385093167702
979454,3,6305186596,"This is not a review as such, but a response to the earlier question regarding Martyn Green as a ham.  I was privileged to see him perform as Ko-Ko either at the Schubert Theater in Manhattan or the Philadelphia Academy of Music (I'm too old to remember which!).  It was in the late '40s or early '50s, when I was an early teen or pre-teen, and before he lost his leg in an elevator accident.  He was so hammy that at one point during one of his many ""Here's a How-De-Do"" encores he actually shinnied about 30 feet up on a piece of scenery just inside the proscenium!  I've seen many Ko-Kos since.  He was the best, and I'll always treasure that luminous performance.  How did the world ever let itself lose the D'Oyly Carte???",1010534400,13,727,4.348148148148148

There are several missing songs (As someday it may happen, So sir we much regret, etc.) which is unforgivable because they are important and famous (imagine writing a biography of Shakespeare and never mentioning Hamlet, As you like it, Romeo & Juliet - you get the picture) and the performance feels hushed. Ko-ko is tremendous and the Behold the Lord High Executioner entrance is the best I've ever seen. You must compare this with the 1983 Canadian production which is better in sound and lacking in sets. Miscasting is quite obvious, most faces are forgettable, though the Mikado seems appropriately stern. There is absolutely no chemistry between the lead actors and Yum-yum is as much part of the background as everything else. Until the TOPSY-TURVY cast is recalled to shoot the remainder songs not included in the movie, we are not likely to get a decent Mikado on video. Pity",997833600,14,983,4.892215568862276
979456,4,6305186596,"After careful consideration I finally ordered this DVD- all the reviews I read either loathed it or adored it, & there wasn't much room for the middle ground. Well, after watching I must say that is is in all probability the best 'Mikado' on DVD or video. Sure, songs are cut & the plot has been altered a bit, but you must keep in mind that this film was made for the general public. In my view, if you want to enjoy this film you should not approach it as a straight-out presentation of the opera, but as an adaptation. Nine times out of ten any play, book, or what have you that is transferred into a film is altered. We should just be more thankful that they didn't mangle it so badly as to be unregonizable. A prologue in which it shows Nanki-Poo running off has been added to help the plot run more smoothly, (which I can see the logic of, Gilbert couldn't quite get away with that in the theatre). Baker is fairly decent as Nanki-Poo, though his accent clashes a bit too much for my taste with the english cast. Green makes a wonderful Ko-ko, and even if he hams it up, it doesn't hurt anything as to hinder the film. (and I do not think it is a discredit to G&S, the original Ko-ko was a bit of a ham too) As the Mikado, Barclay is gleefully sadistic & and a bit ghoulish, but still has the pomp to be the ruler of Japan. Katisha, played by Constance Willis, by far suffers the most from the cuts made to the score, she comes off as one-dimensional; a sort of Japanese Valkyrie (with a moustache no less!) with wide staring eyes, chewing up the scenery wherever she goes, and I don't think her voice is quite suited to the role. The rest of the cast is excellent, (read the other reviews for more info on them, this is just a review to clarify some things, and not the rantings of a rabid purist). The color as well as the sound are really amazing since this was made in the late 30's, though there are some pops & clicks in the sound which probably could have been fixed. The bass also has a bit of distortion, as well as when the chorus sings full out. From what I remember, the editing is far better than on the video version, though I still would not rate it as great. As towards the sets, they a rather odd mixture, but we are dealing with a fairytale Japan. As a last comment here are the cut songs: (off the top of my head) A stanza out of 'Our great Mikado'.  'Young Man despair', 'As someday it may happen' (this was due to the fact that it included the dreaded 'N' word, so it was cut out shortly after the film was made) 'So please you sir, we much regret', The Finale of act I is cut up quite a bit, with Katisha's Solos completly gone. 'Braid the Raven hair' also has cuts to it, As well as ""the Sun whos rays' Though Nanki-Poo sings it also in the prologue. The Mikado's song is missing the first stanza (I don't know if that is due to the 'N' word sneaking into the score again or not), The orchetral score of 'The flowers that bloom in the Spring' has been altered. 'Alone & yet alive' & 'There is beauty in the bellow of the blast' are gone as well, & the finale to act II only includes the choral parts. As a final word, this DVD is great fun & if not for the cuts probably never could be matched. If you can stomach the cuts, then you will enjoy this immensly; if you can't, I sorry for you, for you are missing out on a throughly enjoyable film.",996537600,4,3373,4.133942161339422

Perhaps  the worst thing about G&S as staged for most of the past century is the  ossified approach to the material. The lines are delivered by rote, without  any sense of character or meaning. Martyn Greene's KoKo is a busy  creature--lots of stage business and slapstick, but Greene's portrayal is  so loaded with schtick that it amounts of an insult to Gilbert's very funny  book and lyrics ...as if the film is saying, ""Your lines are not funny  enough, Gilbert, so we're piling on the slapstick.""  Kenny Baker is  just not up to the role of Naki-Poo, the runaway prince disguised as a  musician. His voice is thin, his manner effeminate and his chemestry with  the cast is zero. And yet, in the hideous and contrived prologue, he  actually is given Yum-Yum's ""The Sun and I"" song to sing!  This is a truly miserable mish-mosh, a highly mannered period piece from  the 1930's which is being brought out, one suspects, in anticipation of  Topsy-Turvy (the ONLY really good movie about Gilbert and Sullivan).

Still  it gets more respectful treatment than poor Lehar's Merry Widow did both  from Maurice Chevalier and Lana Turner (!).

7884454,3,6305186596,"Bottom Line First: Overall this is a fair production. It represent a sincere effort to bring an old and tradition limited production into the world of film. Important songs are missing, or cut short. The finished product seems more earnest than entertaining. I recommend this more as a piece of theater and movie history. The Mikado is in amateur productions all over this country and all have the immediate advantages of live theater by dedicated Savoyards. This is not the place to start if you are beginning your life as a Savoyard.

Over 100 years before the first Harry Potter fans lined up to pass judgement of the legitimacy of the first Harry Potter movie, there were the traditions that grew up around the productions of anything Gilbert and Sullivan. In part this may have been a reaction to the wide spread problem of the lack of any copy right protections between national borders but more likely because of the personality of the original writer and lyricist, Sir William Gilbert and Sir Author Sullivan. AKA Gilbert and Sullivan.

A Gilbert and Sullivan production, when enacted by the Original Company, the Doyly Carte Opera Company was expect to do things certain ways. Diction was always exacting, historically this would be Gilberts doing. There would be encores. There are specific requirements in the limited choreography and many of the major directions. Only limited amount of improvisation, and that limited to one song. One character, the older failed male romantic lead would be allowed some impish clowning. An audience to a Doyly Carte production expects, as part of the fun the see each production as exactly reproduces as if by mechanical means. Rather like we expect a movie to always re-run as we saw it the first time.

I have had the pleasure to see several Gilbert and Sullivan operetta performed by the original Doyly Carte Company 3 in as many weeks during their American Tour in 1976 and I think once when I was very young. The original company disbanded in 1982 have been formed in 1871. A new company was re-formed in 1988. This new company tends to go dark every now and then but they still maintain a website and have been known to co-produce with local companies. Amateur companies exist all over the world and annually compete for the chance to go on stage in London. Side note: the G and S operetta built the Savoy Theater in London and since then fans and performers are referred to as Savoyards.

There is a long history of complaint that the entire plot of Mikado is yellow face. That is it consists of broad and ignorant stereotyping of the Japanese people. The criticism is unfair and at the detail level ignorant of the original intent.  The basics of the plot is that the Mikado of Japan has decreed that flirting, except by married couples is a crime and to be punished by execution. The Operetta was written in England in 1885. Japan was an exotic, unknown land, thought of only in terms of images painted on Jars and Doors on Screen and Fans and image that is expressly disavowed in the opening number, If you want to know who we are. In England in 1881 Queen Victoria was on the throne and she was famously narrow minded by things related to public shows of affection., Tradition has it tht she understood that the Mikado was a lampoon aimed at her and because of it she denied Author Gilbert his knighthood for many years after Sullivan got his.

End of background. This Mikado DVD is from a Hollywood Technicolor movie filmed in 1939. It was made with both the participation of and close guidance from The Company. Most of the performers were in the Company and while set designs and costumes are original to this version the intention was to make a Doyly Carte movie. Any change in a Doyly Carte production is by definition a major change. This said changes were made as part of a conscious decision to make the production fit the time constraints of a movie and to use the ability of a camera to move every viewer direct onto the stage.

Keeping in mind that the original Mikado typically ran over 2 hours, this DVD times at 91 minutes, including some commentary. The movie includes an introduction that replaces at last one song and many other songs are either cut out or cut short. The famous List song (all G and S Operettas have list songs), one of my favorites was cut allegedly because it had a direct visual reference to Adolph Hitler and a line that used the N-word. I do not believe this explanation.  By 1939 Nazi German was getting a lot of appropriately negative coverage in Hollywood and there was zero notion that the occasional racist expression was not part of polite theater.

On the positive side the use of Technicolor and taking advantage of the cameras view many of the sets and costumes are wonderfully detailed and dreamy in their effect. Unlike traditional crowds in the stage direction by The Company, Here the crows tend to act more naturally, scattered about and engaged in movie versions of what village crowds do.

The basic plot. The action all takes place in the Town of Titipoo. A wondering minstrel, specifically a 2nd trombonist Nankipoo arrives in town seeking to marry his beloved, Yum-Yum ward of town tailor turned Lord High Executioner, Ko-Ko. We know from the introduction that Nankipoo, despite bravado, is the only son of the Mikado and as such he is sought in matrimony by Katisha, an elderly lady of the court. Meantime, the Mikado notices a sudden lack of executions performed in Titipoo and brings his entourage, including Katisha, his daughter in law elect, to determine if the town of Titipoo should be demoted to the rank of a village.  Believe it or not things get sillier from here.

Specific to the movie. The lead roles of Nanki Poo and Yum-Yum are not original Company Cast members. They are Kenny Barker and Jean Colin a lovely young American couple, each well known to the audiences of the day. They have the voices and look good together. Not much else is required of them. The main comedic performances are by veteran Doyly Carte performed Martyn Green as the traditional spritely , failed romantic lead, Ko-Ko ,the Lord High Executioner and Sydney Granville the basso clown-profundo, Pooh-Bag, the Lord High Everything Else. Of the two much of Ko-Kos clowning about works but there are a few too many drum reinforced falls on his backside and the toe bit is an outright fail. Granville is exactly the desired overly stayed, palm out officious, official, I cant help it I was born sneering. Often the role of the Mikado is secondary to the point of being incidental John Barkly enlivens the roll with one of the best, evil villain laughs this side of Vincent Price and Barkly combines an oily creepy sense of threat with just enough of a wink at the audience.
