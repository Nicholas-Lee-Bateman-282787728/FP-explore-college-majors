7897925,5,6305843481,"A very suspenseful film considering the naivete of a young child who doesn't know nor understand the dangers that exist on both sides of the Berlin wall especially when such dangers are usually terminated by gunfire. All the boy wanted was his ball after it was kicked over the wall.and as shown in the film were the great lengths the boy went through to achieve his objective, thanks in part  to a girl he met  on the other side of the wall.

Within this film was another story not really connected to the child and this concerns a young woman who fell in love with an East German guard but for the moment all they can do was to stare at each other through binoculars. For me I believed these scenes were included to give the viewers somewhat of a chance to ease themselves from the suspense that was generated by the child.

Overall a great movie even though it was in Spanish without dubbing nor subtitles but as they say a picture is worth a thousand words and this picture did just that.",1392595200,,992,4.375
7897926,5,6305843481,"El Nino y El Muro(1965, The Boy and the Wall)is a solid film. It's a product of its time. The Berlin Wall was torn down in the late 1980's. It's a German/Spanish co-production with Mexican director Ismael Rodriguez at the helm. Nino Del Arco plays Dieter, a boy growing up in 1960's West Berlin. His dad buys him a toy ball that he covets from a local store. While playing with a construction worker, the ball is accidentally kicked over the Berlin Wall into East Germany! Dieter puts himself in danger by making friends with Martha, an East German girl, and by trying to recover his toy ball. This was a time when people could get shot for illegally crossing the Berlin Wall! There's a sub plot where the sensual, nubile daughter of the store owner is having a meaningless, lust-filled relationship with a male friend. An East German guard(played by Carlos Pinar) is in love with the teenage girl, but he can't reach her from the other side of the Berlin Wall.
 The whole film is presented in Spanish even though parts of it were filmed in Germany. I guess the filmmakers were making it palatable for a broad audience. I liked Adolfo Waitzman's music score; it sounded very Elmer Bernstein-ish. 1960's B-movie starlet Linda Christian made a special guest appearance in the movie. Carlos Pinar was also in the fluffy, campy comedy Vestidas y Alborotadas(1968, known as Dos Gemelas Estupendas in Spain). The friendship between Dieter and Martha was very cute and it reminds me that I was a child once. A clip from this movie can be seen in a 12 minute Ismael Rodriguez featurette that is an extra feature on some Pedro Infante DVD's. This film is a good drama and it's more inspiring than depressing.",1254787200,2,1699,4.663333333333333
7897927,4,6305843481,"This is very odd and obscure film (my favorite kind!), and I mainly watched it because I am a fan of the director, Ismael Rodriguez, based on his work on that classic Mexican craziness ""Autopsy of a Ghost"" as well as ""The Beast of Hollow Mountain"" (talk about range!). Also, Linda Christian is in this one and she is mighty hot, though it's not that kind of movie.

Apparently, this Spanish-Mexican co-production was filmed in Berlin (?!) and the script was based on a story by Gwen Verdon's son, Jim Henaghan. I'm not in the best position to judge, since my Spanish is pretty weak and the video has no English subtitles, but as far as I can make out the movie's a kind of political allegory of some sort...

It's one of those strange, semi-experimental films that only could have been made in the '60s. Love that freeze-frame ending - classic! Check it out, if you can track down a copy of this rarity.",1252800000,,903,4.466666666666667
