2769931,5,B000NJMMOK,"Wonderful experience if you are a FAN. The Seinfeldt shows are ageless, each one is a trip through memory lane, a welcome diversion to the junk so-called sit com genre available now. My wish is for a Newhart series. Spend the money, enjoy!!!",1182816000,,241,4.627906976744186
2769932,5,B000NJMMOK,Best thing I have ever bought on Amazon......have always loved Seinfeld and now you can head str8 to your favorite episode for a quick laugh.,1179100800,,141,4.68
2769933,5,B000NJMMOK,"Great gift, my girlfriend is enjoying it each night after work and very happy with my choice, thanks, Jim",1176163200,,105,4.578947368421052
2769934,5,B000NJMMOK,What's to say?  Seven seasons of one of the funniest tv shows.  You won't be disappointed; lots of extras and commentaries and all that good stuff.  Features such classics as The Soup Nazi and The Contest. The only bad part about this box set is that it is not all the seasons of Seinfeld.  Enjoy!,1176076800,3,297,4.345454545454546
2769935,5,B000NJMMOK,"Even though I'm in Australia, I bought this item because of the fantastic price for my partner.  The whole series cost about the same as the first two volumes cost in Australia.

Seinfeld is a fantastic, hilarious show.  We've been watching it every weekend since it arrived.

Definitely worth the money :D",1175904000,,306,4.826923076923077
2769936,5,B000NJMMOK,I got all 7 seasons for a GREAT price.  Great show.. great quality!  Love Amazon,1175817600,,80,4.266666666666667
2769937,5,B000NJMMOK,"Even though I discovered Seinfeld long after the show had ended it's run I am an avid fan. I can relate to Jerry, George and Cosmo just as easily as I can to Joey, Ross and Chandler as there is a little of the everyday man in all of these characters and I beleive that apart from being a well crafted comedy show that is where much of the appeal is for so many people. This collection of seasons 1-7 is priceless and I recommend it highly to not only fans of the show but any fan of comedy. The quality is superb as are the bountiful extras included on each disc. Five big stars all the way.",1175817600,,591,4.016949152542373
2769938,3,B000NJMMOK,"If my rating was based on the product, I would give this 5 stars. However, I wouldn't recommend buying this set at the current price of $199.99. If you buy each of these seasons separately through Amazon, you get them for less than $135. Seems like a better deal to me!",1173225600,11,269,4.294117647058823
2769939,5,B000NJMMOK,Can't resist that price ($99). The other reviewer is correct that there are two more seasons not included here (because they aren't on DVD yet). However Larry David wasn't a main writer for those and I think they were much weaker than the previous seasons.,1173139200,2,256,4.711111111111111
2769940,5,B000NJMMOK,"Season 7 is the final season in which series co-creator Larry David is associated with the show. The few people who think that Seinfeld ever jumped the shark usually cite Larry David's exit as the shark-jumping moment, in part because much of the memorable material of the first seven seasons came from David's own life, including the Emmy-winning ""The Contest"". If you don't plan on collecting seasons eight and nine, which in my opinion were not quite as brilliant as the first 7 seasons but still great, then you might want to get this set. However, for what the individual seasons currently cost at this site, it would be much more economical to get them that way.",1173139200,7,668,4.717948717948718
8178497,5,B000NJMMOK,I bought these for a friend and he absolutely LOVES them!,1481241600,,57,4.2727272727272725
8178498,1,B000NJMMOK,"My mom didn't realize when she first got it, it was only season 4 and not all 7 as described.",1468972800,,93,3.7
8178499,2,B000NJMMOK,Some of the cases were cracked and only one set was actually a box set. Otherwise they're a reproduction by another company. Something Wal-Mart would sell!!!,1463011200,,157,5.076923076923077

Excelente formato. sin problemas con los subtitulos. Buena calidad de imagen.

8178501,2,B000NJMMOK,"My package was received in damaged condition. It had shrink wrap on it, but was beat up on the edges. This did not look NEW at all! I bought this as a gift and it looks like I bought it at a garage sale not the price I paid. Spivey was the shipper. :(",1375315200,,251,3.6666666666666665
8178502,4,B000NJMMOK,"Great comedy series that i thought i would give as a gift. What I would have wanted to know about this product before i purchased it is that this box-set is NOT the complete season of 1-7 but rather 1-9. Knowing there were two more season to the show i went on to purchase season 8 and season 9 seperately. When i recieved the order, which was many months later due to the fact i live over seas, i discovered the box set was all i needed to order. Now i'm stuck with an extra season of 8 and 9, oh yah, and the bill due to the products discription error, not so comical.",1334880000,,570,4.008771929824562
8178503,5,B000NJMMOK,Got these for my 22 year old grandson!  He loves them and was very excited to recieve the series! He is going to share them with his friends at school!!,1325116800,,152,4.066666666666666
8178504,5,B000NJMMOK,"My husband and I have watched all 9 of the seasons of Seinfeld from start to finish twice now. And the episodes still don't bore us! Love this show! I would highly recommend getting all of the seasons. You never know which season the best episodes will come from, so get them all! They're all hilarious and it's worth every penny.

You'll like this show if...

You enjoy watching a sitcom that has pretty much no point to it.
You find entertainment in the awkward situations people are in.
It makes you laugh looking at the weird things people will do or say, particularly in relationships.
You find humor in the different strong personalities and how they react to situations.
You like to analyze every day situations to find humor and peculiarity in them.",1320883200,,757,4.641791044776119
8178505,5,B000NJMMOK,"It' s been ten years since the show about a stand-up New-York City comedian , ""neat freak"" named Jerry Seinfeld and his three colorful friends, a loser, a doofus, and a neurotic ex-girlfriend, aired its final episode on May 14, 1998 but still no sitcom on TV has came close to its incomparable brilliancy which lies in the ability to somehow make a viewer addicted to the narcissist and selfish characters that constantly put themselves into the pointless and absurd situations. I still remember how I became a fan. One evening, my husband and two sons were watching the episode called ""The Rye"", and I stopped, watched for a few minutes, told them to move over - and the rest is history. I fell in love instantly and forever. Since that night, I watched the new episodes and re-runs whenever it was possible and I've become one of the millions of fans of the greatest show about nothing ever written, directed, and produced. In its best episodes, ""Seinfeld"" is perfection that no other show would ever achieve, and there are many great episodes. Even now after all these years I keep asking myself why the show about four rather selfish, ego-centric, immature, often back-stabbing and outrageous characters who are afraid of commitments has been so universally loved and admired? Maybe we can see ourselves in them? Or, the secret to Seinfeld's success was the misanthropic Larry David, the failed comedian but talented writer who uses humor derived from awkward social situations, and his collaboration with Jerry Seinfeld? Or maybe as a really great work of art, the show defies any explanation? The sitcom has given us so many unforgettable minutes of joy, that it will never be replaced. Even Curb Your Enthusiasm, Larry David's baby in all its greatness is not as enjoyable as ""Seinfeld."" CUE is about George Costanza whose dreams came true - he is rich and has a beautiful loving wife but he does not have Jerry, Cramer, and Elaine in his life, and their absence shows.

Some of my favorite episodes - ""The Soup Nazi"", ""The Chinese Restaurant"", ""The Pez Dispenser"", ""The Limo"", ""The Bubble Boy"", ""The Contest"" -""that's the best, Jerry, that's the best from the masters of their domains"", The Puffy Shirt, The Hamptons, oh my God, there are so many! And how many quotes from the show have become the part of every day conversations, ""yada yada yada"","" they are real and spectacular"", ""Jerry, just remember, it's not a lie if you believe it."" ""Hello, Jerry. Hello, Newman"".

Thanks for the wonderful memories.  5+/5 or 10/10 - what else?",1212796800,2,2542,4.825688073394495
8178506,2,B000NJMMOK,"Let me be the innocent child in ""The Emperor's New Clothes,"" and proclaim:

Jerry Seinfeld is not funny!

Oh, I know what you're thinking: Here's  a guy who thinks Seinfeld was unfunny, but his cast was hilarious.

No. At best the rest of the cast was mildly amusing (although Jason Alexander is a talented actor, he is not necessarily hilarious, hence the two stars).

Because, when it comes down to brass tacks, ""Seinfeld"" *was* a ""show about nothing"" -- in every sense of the word:

The contrived semi-plots, with choppy one-liner segments.

The cloying, annoying, ejaculatory bass riffs between shots.

Jerry Seinfeld posing as this hipster: Yeah, right, a hipster with a ridiculous bushy mullet.  At best, Seinfeld was an Upper West Side Jewish version of Jeff Foxworthy.  You want to know why people think Jewish men are smug, metrosexual wimpish know-it-alls?  I submit Jerry Seinfeld as ""Exhibit A.""  If a WASP played a Jew such as Seinfeld, he'd be accused of bigoted racial slurs against the Jewish people. Grating, like fingernails down a chalkboard.

Oh, and speaking of freakish hair-do's:  Is there anyone alive who thinks that Michael Richards as Kramer would even inspire a single chuckle if shorn of that ridiculous Brillo-pad hair?  Within three episodes, he'd have been out of the door, after having been reduced to haranguing black hecklers in the studio audience:  He's a [n-word]! He's a [n-word]!

Pathetic.

And, ""Elaine""?

Puleeze! She makes Gwyneth Paltrow look like Kate Winslet, she is so flat.

Yawn.",1189641600,3,1529,5.04
