5022035,1,B006VY8D1C,At first I thought that I was a bit off colour and that my eyes were playing tricks on me. This movie is bad with five stars. Maybe the director wanted this type of silly acting with dead pan lines. After twenty minutes I decided enough was enough and I pressed the stop button.,1342656000,7,278,4.166666666666667
5022036,4,B006VY8D1C,"Great for all ages, no doubt a family movie!
This movie took me back to my childhood years, where cowboys movies were the only ones i would watch with my dad! Grew up in Romania in the years following the fall of communism and this kind of movies were a delight for anyone that time! I loved this movie for its simplicity,no superheroes, no artificial powers, no silly dramas, no studio shooting!  The love story was a fairy tale kind of, a love story that even girls now a days dream of....the guy that would give up everything to come to your ""rescue"".  In other words i think this is a cowboys movie made not just for guys! I would  definitively watch it again !",1336521600,3,665,4.304
5022037,5,B006VY8D1C,A fantastic western from the Burk Brothers! They were up against incredible odds when they made their movie and they triumphed. What they accomplished was amazing. Alvin made a great action star and Guilmette is hilarious as his sidekick. The supporting cast shines as well. The Burks are two very talented filmmakers and I am looking forward to their next project.,1335657600,4,365,5.0
5022038,2,B006VY8D1C,"""Leading my men up there would be sheer suicide."" A type of ""peace"" has
existed between the white man and the Indians mainly because they have
avoided each other. After a little skirmish breaks out a woman named
Patricia (Maloney) has been taken by the Indians. When no one is up to
the task of rescuing her it is up to a former officer Captain Bugle
(Cowan) to go in and get her back. There are some movies that are
better then you expect them to be based on your expectations. The same
goes for some that you hope to be good but when they aren't as good you
say it's disappointing. Then there are movies like this one. The kind
that is exactly what you expect. I expected absolute low-budget
lameness and that's what I got. The acting and the action (seems like
they are using walmart bows) are laughable but I will admit that I kept
watching just to see what they will come up with. I again am left
wondering though why the western genre has fallen off lately. I wish
they would make more then one good one a year. Overall, a laughable
western that kept me watching just to see what awful thing they will
come up with next. I give it a C-.",1335052800,,1142,4.219178082191781
5022039,3,B006VY8D1C,"A BURK BROS Film.

This western is so true to the traditions of the Wild West,The real west not the REEL west .

There is a desert,Real deserted not a effect and real horses and a real ghost town setting,See it can be done even with the little budget allowed for this film.

The star is nicknamed `Bugle' and he can get in  a duel or two or three...The fights are really the best scenes,A Gun duel with 3 mean cowboys and a sword duel with a mexican captain and a tomahawk duel with a real indian.

That's another great point their are authentic( got tired of overuse of real) indians Playing the indians,Imagine that in a Hollyweird Western,Won't happen ever .

Great effort,Hope it gets picked up for distribution somewhere,Deserves to be seen as a reference for bigger budget films.

Oh,And in the grand tradition..'Bugle' is played by a former pro footballer like John Wayne and Alan Autry were former footballers...Something in the game reminds us of The Real Wild West !",1330473600,3,976,4.606936416184971
5022040,4,B006VY8D1C,"Fun movie. Non violent, good performances, makes you cheer for the good guy. Saw this movie at a theater in downtown LA, it was well received with a good vibe amongst the audience once the credits rolled.",1327190400,3,204,4.54054054054054
8505222,2,B006VY8D1C,Very poor excuse for a low budget western with a story that takes far too long to tell and a cast list of talentless non actors. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.,1458172800,,171,4.212121212121212
8505223,1,B006VY8D1C,"First it was an accidental purchase, I was curious because of the cover. I will most likely never view
it again. It just didn't make sense on any level, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME NOR YOUR MONEY.",1445472000,,191,4.1891891891891895
8505224,1,B006VY8D1C,Poor actors.  Reminds me of a Class-B movie.  No well known actors!  It is a horrible movie.,1432944000,,92,4.294117647058823

8505226,5,B006VY8D1C,I loved it because my horse was in it.  :-)  She was the main woman character's horse and was captured by the Indians.,1382400000,,118,4.086956521739131
8505227,2,B006VY8D1C,was not at all what i had thought it would be like.  this movie is more like badly made speghetti western american made. couldn't sit thourgh 15 minutes before unloading it.,1372636800,,173,4.580645161290323
8505228,1,B006VY8D1C,This is possibly the most dreadful western ever made. I've seen better B movies than this. The acting was so amateurish and the characters were so awful. I switched it off after 18 minutes because it was shameful to watch. I gave it 1 star only because it wouldn't register if I gave it nought.,1370649600,8,294,4.363636363636363
8505229,3,B006VY8D1C,"It is a plain vanilla western, the native people are shown in negative way, story is a happy ending ""sing around the campfire"" kind of thing. DVD makes a nice coaster.",1347321600,,167,4.419354838709677
8505230,2,B006VY8D1C,"The film opens with Bugle (Alvin Cowan) working as a boxing hustler. There is also a subplot about gold on Black Claw land. Prospectors are killed. The deed holder has an idea that if they get a girl kidnapped (Katy Maloney) the cavalry will wipe out the Indians and they will be free to dig.

The film had some minor humor in it. There were anachronisms in the speech, especially the Indian woman (Kristen Alaniz) whose speech greatly contrasted the cliche Indian talk used by the rest of her tribe. The acting and script were Asylum grade bad. The beautiful scenery that normally accompanies westerns was not present as it appears most of the filming was done on a set. The Indian bows had all the spring and appearance of a dime store bow and arrow set.

Unless you want camp and cheese, avoid the film.

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1344816000,5,835,4.516556291390729
8505231,3,B006VY8D1C,"NOT the ""SEARCHERS"" by any means, but it beats watching another drug movie.  I did notice a TON of bloopers just about halfway thru the movie.  I need to watch more closely and view it again to catch more mistakes (that make the movie a tad more enjoyable).  For instance..look for the ""plastic"" pour spout on the canteen, the Sgt. Major with no rank at all on his uniform, the modern western saddles, the stainless steel looking ribs on the gunrunner's wagon, NO wagon tracks in the sand despite Bugle's spotting the tracks with his spy glass from the top of the rocks, Bugle hollering for a anyone with the wagon when you can clearly see a Mexican holding three horses standing to the left of the wagon in plain view as he approaches, the flame shaped soft rubber light bulb on the candle, etc....
If you enjoy looking for those mistakes then it's a fun movie.",1343088000,2,862,4.477707006369426
