7947211,5,B00005NFYM,"this dvd was so sad. i was used to the usual [bad] antics of carrot, the beatings of the misu sisters, and the usual commentary by marron and gateau. this was completely different. i started to hyperventilate at the end of episode 24 (i'm a big marron fan), i was sobbing hysterically at the end of 25 (dota's screaming was what did me in along with big mamu), and i needed to watch the 3rd oav again after i finished watching it just so i would calm down. i was glad to see tira and chocolat in their manga outfits and i was praying for an actual battle scene between tira, chocolat, marron, and gateau against zaha torte when they returned, but hey. it was a sweet ending. i was crying my eyes out. this dvd is NOT for the faint at heart, nor those who're effected by some dramatic imagery. but if you're a big fan of bakuretsu hunter, this is for you. once again, lemme warn you about the really angsty themes. especially for marron fans (and the other hunters for that matter, but definetly marron). buy it anyway. it's great! and can anybody confirm what those buildings were in the background at the VERY VERY end of episode 26? it looked like the twin towers and the chrysler building. were the hunters reborn in new york? enough jabbering. buy it!",1019088000,3,1255,4.390557939914163
