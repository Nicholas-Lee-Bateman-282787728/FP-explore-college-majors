Although I could figure out where the film was going--not initially, but long before the ending--that didn't spoil it for me. I loved it. I had previously purchased ""The Wind Rises"" in Blu-ray made by this same company, and it had the same high quality. There are not a lot of extras, but you can hear it in Japanese with English subtitles, and the subtitles are white, outlined in black, so it makes them easy to read. It's a lovely film, and it even made me tear up at the end. (I'm always surprised when animated films make me do that.) I highly recommend this film if you like Studio Ghibli; it's wonderful.",1435276800,,760,4.5144927536231885
