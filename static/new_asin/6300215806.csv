246015,1,6300215806,"What was Paramount thinking? As a true Harlow fan this trash is complete fiction!  Baker looks nothing like Harlow. In fact she was in her mid 30's when she made this film. The real Harlow died at 26. It is chock full of fictional characters. The only redemption it holds is Angela Lansbury, a great actress who can give class to even the worst drivel and this film takes the grand prize! I saw the other version of Harlow starring Carol Lynley and even though it was cheaply made and highly fictionalized it is better than Baker's version.",976665600,7,540,4.510204081632653
246016,3,6300215806,"Although the movie's setting is the 30's, the film is more a reflection of 60's moviemaking complete with Mannix himself Mike Conners, Fox contract player Red Buttons, and Peter Lawford of ""Rat Pack"" fame.  Angela Lansbury who had previously played mothers to Laurence Harvey and Elvis Presley, respectively, finds herself in a similar position as mother to Carroll Baker's Harlow.  Baker does a fair job as the doomed star, but does not exude the same sexual attraction that made Harlow the object of many men's desires.  Overall, the movie holds the interest, but is, by no means, a classic.
It does feature a most interesting ""pad"" that belongs to Leslie Neilson, cast as a producer with a lecherous eye.  This is the kind of place the Austin Powers would find a perfect place in which to ""shag.""",972691200,,799,4.810218978102189

After all, she did have those thin penciled eyebrows and Carroll Baker would have looked more like Jean with the proper make-up. Carroll did not quite catch Jean's brash, world weary attitude but she did a nice job. Did everyone know there was a competetive version out around the same time with

246222,3,6300215806,"Anyone who has seen Jean Harlow movies (Dinner at Eight) or read a biography will immediately sense that this movie is absolutely nothing like the actual person.  From the opening song (sounds like the Love Boat theme), to the saccharine Bobby Vinton song at the end - it's just a parody of Harlow's life.  Some of the costumes are stunning - some look cheap and thrown together.  Ms. Baker sports a bad wig that looks more like Marilyn Monroe's hair on a bad hair day.  The Blu-ray edition is very vivid and the color saturation is intense, although certain scenes look a little blurry.  It's entertaining in a lurid way, but I wonder why they changed the facts regarding the true story, when the changes add nothing to the plot and do not help the audience understand the characters any better?  This movie is only for hard core Harlow fans who are curious as to how it portrays their idol.",1456099200,4,892,4.54375

Hollywood's idea of a movie star biography. Carroll Baker trys hard, and entertains in an impossible role. I remember at the time Carroll got quite the Hollywood buildup as a sex symbol. Many magazines like Saturday Evening Post, and Lokk did big spreads on her with great full page photographs also. After a couple of years Carroll was off to Italy starring in B-Films like many of her out of fashion peers.

I haven't seen many movies that starred Carroll Baker, so I have little to compare her other performances with her acting skills in this film. She seemed to be an actress who would have been better suited for television and not the big screen.  The script was well written and did tell the compelling story of the tragically short life of a Hollywood sex symbol superstar. I just wish that the film studio had made more of an effort to capture the 1930's era.

246659,2,6300215806,"I remember Jean Harlow (1911-1937) as a vibrant,  vivacious, spirited comedienne who could easily hold her own on screen opposite such actors as Wallace Berry, Clark Gable, and Spencer Tracy. She is nowhere to be found in this movie. ""Harlow"" (1965) unfortunately lives up to its notorious reputation as one of the worst biopics of all time. The movie functions as a prime example of both the best and worst of 1960's cinema schlock.
  Carroll Baker earns points for giving the title role all she has to give. Still, that's not saying much. The screenplay by John Michael Hayes (who also wrote the screenplays for such other  bad movies we love as ""Torch Song"" and ""Where Love Has Gone"") is such a tacky-trashy mess, it doesn't matter if Baker is playing Jean Harlow, Baby Doll, herself, or any fictional platinum-blonde, sexy, self-destructive starlet. Angela Lansbury miraculously manages to bring some dignity and class to the thankless role of Harlow's freeloading,  sexually addicted, suffocating mother. But  nothing else about this gaudy, garish production (sets, costumes, and definitely not Neal Hefti's obnoxiously loud and inappropriate musical score) rings true. The movie has no sense of characters, time, or place, and ends up existing in an odd time-warp version of the 1920's-1930's meets the 1960's.
  Are we honestly supposed to believe that Arthur Landau (Red Buttons) was such a saintly agent that he initially agreed to represent a desperate and starving Harlow for $1.00? Later, Landau tells her to get out of a movie contract by, basically, acting like a sexual tease. When Baker's Harlow enters Leslie Nielsen's (as a fictional, unscrupulous movie mogul based on Howard Hughes) outlandishly decorated house, she declares, ""I wonder if I'm in heaven or hell."" Oh, you're in celluloid hell, honey! An enraged Nielsen rips her Edith Head gown, throws her on his bed, and finally dismisses her as a ""sexual curiousity."" A hard-working Harlow eventually lands a better contract at Majestic Studios (headed by Martin Balsam in a fictional role based on MGM'S Louis B. Mayer) and a star dressing room. A fictional actor portrayed by Michael Connors instantly enters and declares, ""Welcome to the velvet prison.""
  After the mysterious suicide of her second husband Paul Bern (portrayed here as her impotent first husband by Peter Lawford), the real-life Jean Harlow consented to a studio arranged marriage to her friend Harold Rossen, a cinematographer at MGM. After their divorce, she settled into a loving relationship with actor William Powell. Her career was going well and she was well-liked by her co-stars and the public at the time of her untimely death from kidney failure at age 26 in 1937. The movie completely ignores all of this. After Bern's suicide, Baker's Harlow looks for love in all the wrong places and in all the wrong ways; including throwing herself at her stepfather (Raf Vallone) whom she always hated! Baker's thoroughly fictional Harlow ends up an alcoholic has-been. She is eventually discovered, looking like pure hell, on a beach. Shortly thereafter, she dies of pneumonia, with Lansbury and Buttons, weeping at her  hospital bedside! Buttons says the ridiculous end lines, ""She didn't die of pneumonia. She died of life!"" This should be sad, but ""Harlow"" is laughable Hollywood hokum from beginning to end.",1294185600,5,3354,5.135779816513762
246660,1,6300215806,"I love Carroll Baker, even though she could never match the real Harlow, but her best films are the ones which didn't receive as much press as those produced by Joseph E. Levine prior to their famous falling out and her getting blackballed in Hollywood and forced into making giallo and zilch films in Italy such as ""Paranoia"" and ""Orgasmo"" (oh wait, I think those were the same move).  Much better than ""Harlow"" and ""The Carpetbaggers"" are ""Sylvia,"" ""Baby Doll,"" ""Station Six - Sahara,"" and even ""Something Wild,"" which is an odd, downbeat film directed by her then husband.

Though this film is fun to watch thanks to the cast, sets and Edith Head gowns, it does a real disservice to the real Harlow by perpetuating false myths about how the great star lived and died.  This goes from the minor facts to major issues in Harlow's life.  In one scene, Baker as Harlow even says her platinum blonde hair was real!  In other major omissions, it basically says that Harlow was a virgin who saved herself for her marriage to Paul Bern (which was in reality her second marriage) and then never married again (which omits her later, third marriage to MGM's lead cameraman Harold Rosson as well as her later affair with William Powell).

But the worst offense is that it perpetuates all the false facts which were memorialized by Irving Shulman in his bestselling biography which was fueled by Harlow's former agent, Arthur Landau, including amongst the major lies:  (1) that Harlow's uremic poisoning was caused by a beating she received from her impotent second husband, Paul Bern; (2) that Harlow's mother refused to get her medical treatment due to her Christian Science beliefs, after Harlow collapsed on the set of ""Saratoga,""; and (3) that Harlow's career was in a downward spiral due to her drinking and promiscuity and that she ultimately died of pneumonia after passing out on a beach following a drunken revel.

That these lies have been memorialized by the book and film has led to them being repeated as fact in other books about 30s Hollywood, and even in some of the reviews of this film by fellow amateur critics who otherwise seem pretty astute to some of the film's failings.  During the time the Shulman bio came out, there was a famous sequence on an afternoon talk show, perhaps Mike Douglas', in which Anita Loos and other of Harlow's contemporaries blasted Landau for his role in peddling the lies the way he did.

There are a couple legit biographies around now about Harlow, one notable one being ""Platinum Girl.""  It debunks all those myths, and while it may make less interesting Hollywoodization for a film bio, it makes great reading as it is obviously written by someone more interested in the truth about this beautiful and talented actress who made such major contributions to so many great films.  Seek it out and read it, and hopefully someone will do a good job filming it.

Now, the real mystery is whatever happened to the ""competing"" version of ""Harlow,"" the film produced on videotape and rush released to beat Baker's ""Harlow"" to the theatres?  It also had an interesting cast with Carole Lynley in the lead role and Ginger Rogers (!) as Mama Jean.  I would love to see that one.  This ""Harlow"" is crass Hollywood 60s at its worst (or best) depending on your point of view, but is similar in tone and about as accurate as the film ""The Oscar"" is at depicting a race for the Best Actor statuette.",1291766400,4,3428,4.707357859531773
246661,3,6300215806,"There are three major problems with this film, as I see it. 1.) The clumsy movie was written and filmed in a rush, as a rival Jean Harlow biopic was in production at the same time and Paramount Pictures wanted their product to hit theater first, 2.) The movie is made in that synthetically ""lush"" 1960's style that's devoid of human emotion, and results in the feeling you're watching plastic mannequins in a puppet play enacted in an expensive store window, and 3.) For all her talent and beauty, the cooly delicate Carroll Baker is the wrong type to play the earthy and erotic Jean Harlow.

As to the story, the script uses practically nothing from the real Jean Harlow's life...which is certainly an odd direction to go in. Harlow was a sexy, down to earth young woman who enjoyed her body, men, and the many perks stardom afforded her. The real center of her life's drama had to do with a religious nut stage mother who leeched off her for money, then refused to call a doctor after her overworked daughter was struck ill with kidney failure, thereby killing her. What the script presents instead is a generic rags to riches climb to fame, where the heroine ultimately finds Hollywood to be a nest of shallow vipers. (Zzzzzzzzz.) If you asked Jean Harlow about her life, I don't imagine that's how she'd have described it.

Carroll Baker is an Oscar nominated actress from the world famous Actors Studio, who I greatly admire. She is thoughtful, sensitive and spontaneous in movies like ""BabyDoll,"" ""Giant"" and ""Ironweed,"" (and harshly funny in ""Andy Warhol's BAD"") yet somewhat detached and adrift in the trashy potboilers Paramount put her in (""Sylvia,"" ""The Carpetbaggers"" et al) that seriously lack substance. Also, physically and emotionally, Baker isn't the bombshell type. She's a slender blonde with lovely legs, a modest bustline and a pretty face, but not the brash, good time, voluptuous kewpie doll Harlow was. There's also an inherent intelligence to her manner that makes you wonder just why she endures the piranha characters surrounding her.

The movie is interesting to watch as an example of homogenized ""commercial"" filmmaking from the 1960's, which is why I give it 3 stars. Emotionally though, it has next to nothing to offer, and is much more of the 2 star variety. And it is only the cast's collective professionalism that keeps it hanging on at that level.",1287273600,3,2384,4.838235294117647
246662,1,6300215806,"Whoever wrote this junkyard of a film should have been permanently barred from writing a film script ever again.  Every aspect of Jean Harlow's life has been fictionalized and/or invented. The only Harlow in this film is the title, otherwise it has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with Jean Harlow, her life, and her eventual tragedy and death.  The platinum wig is a rip-off of Marilyn's hair style in the unfinished Something's Got to Give and does not resemble at all Harlow's signature do.  As a matter of fact, this film seems to have a Monroe fixation.  The costumes, fabulous as they may be, are not authentic thirties.  Edith Head most definitely does not give good Head here!  Anachronisms abound and nothing is period, least of all the music, jazzy sixties stuff, which has nothing to do with the twenties or thirties, but sounds totally like it was written for another film and ill inserted into this hallucination.  There is a technical problem with the music track, which is deafeningly loud and hiked up several decibels higher than the dialog track (see my review of Where Love Has Gone for more details).  My main reason for viewing this film was the magnificent Angela Lansbury whose work I always try to get my hands on.  I was sadly disappointed, as she is merely a decoration here and is given absolutely nothing to do throughout the entire film.  Still, she manages to outdo the material and shine brightly in the death scene, her sole moment of glory in this convoluted crap.  Red Buttons, who has much more screen time than Lansbury also manages to turn in a fine performance, but surprisingly, the most memorable turn comes from Raf Vallone as Marino Bello, a role so badly written that the viewer never knows whether Marino is a devil or a saint, a doting stepfather or a gigolo, an illiterate, opera singing Italian or a shrewd businessman.  Credit must be given to Vallone for managing to make a human being out of a cartoon character.  This multiple personalities syndrome also applies to the Harlow role as written, and we are presented with a woman who is  supposedly a virgin but who has a sexual sewer for a mind and is constantly craving to be ravaged by every man she meets, who is both a victim and a tormentor, who both adores and despises her mother, who abhors her stepfather but wants to have sex with him,  who is barely literate or verbal yet comes up with deliciously witty venom worthy of the most vicious drag queen when being interviewed by the press ... the list goes on and on.  With writing like this can anyone actually blame poor Carroll Baker for looking and sounding absolutely miscast?  No actress in the world could have made a human being out of the platinum Barbie doll this script makes of Jean Harlow. This is a sorry mess and you would do well to stay away from it.

246663,3,6300215806,"This glossy 1965 film has Carroll Baker playing Jean Harlow, although the story is more fiction than fact. Parts of the story are taken from Jean Harlow's life but most of the time it seems to be about some entirely fictional version of Harlow. And Carroll Baker, although she does a decent job, doesn't quite have the ""star quality"" to convince us she (as Harlow) is a big movie star and ""love goddess"". And the film feels very anachronistic; except for the cars everything looks more 1960s than 1930s.

As a Harlow biopic, this is worthless, and the story is full of clichs, but as entertainment, it works pretty well in a campy way if you don't take it seriously at all. It's trash, but entertaining trash. Recommended for fans of 1960s kitsch and fans of movies about Hollywood. 3+",1286668800,,785,4.607142857142857
246694,3,6300215806,"Carroll Baker COULD have been stunning as Harlow! Numerous stills exist of her in more authentic make-up and costuming and she really did evoke the image of the legendary Harlow. But, sometime between those stills (possibly make-up and costume tests - see the Nov. 2, '63 issue of Sat. Eve. Post), and actual filming, her onscreen look became highly modernized. Gone were Harlow's trademark ""pencil-line"" eyebrows, for instance. And, I think it was a crime not to include a scene of Harlow's most iconic photo being taken - the Time Magazine cover shot of her sitting in her boudoir chair, stunning feather-sleeved negligee', mirror in hand, and her shoe dangling from her foot. My other main complaint is the skimmed-over death of Harlow - one scene she's passing out drunk on the beach, the next she's dying - of pneumonia! Harlow did NOT die of pneumonia; she died from uremic poisoning. This is like having Cleopatra die from heartbreak instead of the bite of an asp! Miss Baker wears Harlow's beauty mark on the upper right side of the chin - Harlow's was on the upper LEFT! So, yes, there are many easily fixable errors to the Harlow look, and several mystifying errors/ommissions to Harlow story. Harlow's death was caused by a beating she received from her husband, Paul Bern. The beating apparently injured her kidney, which resulted in kidney failure/uremic poisoning. And, the whole Paul Bern situation, one of great scandal, tragic humiliation, and the VERY mysterious death of Bern, was as glossed-over as Harlow's death. Unlike today's audiences who DEMAND the ""nitty-gritty"", perhaps the early/mid-60's was not the time to tell the real story of Harlow. With all this said, the film as it was shot, IS entertaining, glamorous, and beautiful in that oh-so-60's kind of way. I'd really like to see the Harlow story done again, with today's standards, and with Drew Barrymore as Harlow! Drew is the right age, has the ""chops"", and BOY does she have the look!",1284940800,16,1970,4.918918918918919
246695,5,6300215806,"This film takes many liberties with the truth about the life & death of Jean Harlow, but it is still a fun watch from beginning to end.  Carol Bakker is fabulously sexy as the over-worked, under-appreciated Jean who comes across as more of a victim of the Hollywood machine than she actually was.  She plays Harlow's sexuality to the hilt (well at least as much as 1960's Hollywood would allow) and gives a meaningful performance that outshines the fluff of the material.  Red Buttons is excellant as always portraying the agent who knew he could make Harlow a star. Angela Landsbury is flawless as Harlow's needy, lazy mother.  Lots of fun with big bowl of buttered popcorn and a cold Pepsi!",1280361600,18,692,4.694214876033058

246697,2,6300215806,"Jean Harlow was an A picture star for MGM who filmed with Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy, and William Powell. No mention of them in the film. Here, she's just a bitchy B picture star for Majestic Studios, holding her professional virginity from a B cowboy star played by Mike Connors and making her queer husband Paul Berns (Peter Lawford) impotent. The real Jean Harlow had more dignity in her pinky finger than the character Carroll Baker portrays with her usual display of hysterics granted  by a trashy script.",1217462400,,510,4.795454545454546
246698,4,6300215806,"It was said that this film was rushed out to compete with the Made-For-TV (shot on videotape!) ""Harlow"" with Carol Lynley, from the same year.
Perhaps more thought would have gone into the Baker version: the 1965 music permeating the movie depicting 1935 may have been scrapped in favor of ""period"" music, the storyline adjusted to fit the ""real"" story, some of the bludgeoning soliliques removed - though the script is excellent, and I daresay strong enugh to be played on a Broadway stage at the time.
What the big-budget version has, most notably is consistently great performances. Carroll Baker is, to me, one of the best actresses on the silver screen, her acting is absolutely astonishing in this film: I strong believe she did an Oscar-worthy job. Red Buttons, as the Agent, also does well; Mike Connors, Leslie Nielson, Angela Lansbury, et. al., are exceptionally expressive for a movie considered now to be on the level of ""The Oscar"", or other huge productions of the '60s, which went awry artistically.
The screenplay, though as I mentioned above, is a bit over the top, especially as it injects 1965 historical observations into a very early period in movies, when movies with spoken dialogue were called ""talkies"", and there simply were not that many fallen idols to draw upon. There was no development of the theme of a 17 year old beauty, playing bit parts in frantic slapstick two-reelers, suddenly finding herself a (controversial) lead actress in features with sound.
Additionally, there is actually very little physical resemblance of Baker to Harlow: Baker is a ""Classic"" beauty while Harlow is attractive and possessing that ""animal magnetism"". Also, Baker is not ""17"" by any stretch - though she's more believable (visually) by the end of the movie, when Jean Harlow was in her mid 20s.
Cinematography, sets, are impressive; though chromatics are '60s, not '30s.",1214956800,,1885,5.02555910543131
246699,2,6300215806,"Jean Harlow was one of the most beloved stars of the 1930s, and her early death at 26 shocked Hollywood. This film is an attempt to cash in on her fame, and is therefore a curiosity to fans, but it is certainly no loving tribute.

The film starts out decently enough. Jean Harlow (Carroll Baker) haunts the studios looking for work, and getting very little of it. She wanders onto the set of a western one day at lunchtime, hoping to fall into a meal, and she meets agent Arthur Landau (Red Buttons). Landau is looking for a client to represent, and Harlow seems perfect, so despite having to take quite a few risks, he asks to represent her. Mogul Richard Manley (Leslie Nielson) takes an interest in her and gets her work in slapstick comedies, but drops her when she refuses to become another conquest on his wall.

But at least now she has her foot in the door. With her publicity as a wisecracking sex symbol, she becomes a big star, but there is something she is aching for despite her success. After a talk with Mama Jean (Angela Lansbury) about her love life with Latin lover Marino Bello (Raf Vallone), she decides that what she needs is to be seduced. She hopes to find passion with Paul Bern (Peter Lawford), but discovers on their wedding night that he is unable to perform. His suicide leads her to seek solace in any man's bed, and after a night of drinking and sex, Harlow sleeps on the beach. This gives her pnuemonia which causes her untimely death at 26.

How wrong can a movie get? Harlow began as a rich girl, with no need for fame, but her mother pushed her to become a star. Once famous, she became everyone's kid sister, the girl who everyone looked out for. She was married before she achieved fame, so she was by no means a virgin when she met Paul Bern. In fact, some people who believe that Bern was impotent claim that she knew about his shortcomings and married him for them to escape being pawed constantly. However, there are serious doubts about the impotence claims; Bern had a common law marriage for years before coming to Hollywood. And the idea that Harlow became sex-starved and that this affliction led to her death is preposterous! She died because of kidney failure due to uremic poisoning, a condition that was hard to detect in the middle 1930s. What is even more shocking is that this film suggests that Harlow's career was waning toward the end of her life, which couldn't be further from the truth. She was still the bright star that she was at the height of her fame, which is why her death rattled the world.

It is funny that it was not Harlow's own studio of MGM, but rival Paramount that made this film. Was there some underlying animosity there? Perhaps. What is clear is that someone somewhere involved had little regard for Harlow's memory and wasn't very disturbed by tarnishing her reputation. They also ignored the time period. Baker's hair is of a 1960s style, the music is anachronistic, and the money used is modern. This film is only worthy of seasoned Harlow fans who are just curious.",1187827200,4,3047,4.524500907441016
246700,5,6300215806,"I don't know why the critics were so hard on Caroll Baker in this life story of Jean Harlow. All the movies that i've ever seen that Jean Harlow made then watching the ultra talented Caroll Baker playing the part of Harlow to me was breathtaking. Caroll Baker in this movie is the most BEAUTIFUL women in the world and also my all time favorite movie actress. She has a unique acting style and this very beautiful speaking voice with a touch of an accent,,,,not sure if it's English, Scotish or what, but her speaking voice is just wonderful to the ears. As far as the story,,,yes it's a little Hollywood towards the end but it is a great tear-jerker one along with the beautiful music score thoughtout the entire film. I really believe that if you buy this you will be pleasently surprised and wonder why you never saw this before. Also if you enjoy Caroll Baker in ""Harlow"" check out Caroll Baker in the 1959 movie ""The Miracle."" You'll see a different hair color and you will also see my favorite movie of all times. If i could pass a law it would be that everyone would have to see ""The Miracle"" at least once and give it a good review.  Sorry,,,just getting carried away.",1028246400,28,1176,4.419354838709677
