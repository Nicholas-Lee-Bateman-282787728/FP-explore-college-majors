5567739,5,B00BAXTYI0,I like Richard Boone. He is a relative of Daniel Boone. Have Gun  Will Travel is an American Western television series that aired on CBS from 1957 through 1963. It was rated number three or number four in the Nielsen ratings every year of its first four seasons.,1386460800,17,262,4.458333333333333
5567740,5,B00BAXTYI0,"This was a wonderful show. I remembered it from my childhood as being a no-nonsense Western with a great lead character. In watching it as an adult I am struck by how imaginative all the stories are. You will find none of the standard Western cliches here, not a one. Every story is fresh and new.

As usual, the CBS vaults have yielded absolutely perfect quality episodes, just like they did for Perry Mason.

This is a really great example of why Westerns were so popular back then. I highly recommend it to everyone.",1378857600,118,519,4.51063829787234
5567741,4,B00BAXTYI0,"Plus:  All the episodes.  Minus: There are no extras, just all the episodes.  I'm enough of a fan that when Amazon offered for a good price that I got it now rather than wait any longer to see if it comes out on blue ray with extras.  If it ever comes out on blue ray there better be tons of extras to make it worthwhile buying again.",1376265600,18,334,3.9402985074626864
5567742,5,B00BAXTYI0,Outstanding series for new or old cowboys.  Very enjoyable for cowboys of any age.  One of the truly good old westerns.,1373068800,9,119,4.619047619047619
5567743,5,B00BAXTYI0,Except for Dead Mans Gun this is the only western that was actually good. Paladin taught people moral lessons and unlike the dead mans gun they survived them. At least most of them did. You should get this show.,1371340800,21,211,4.435897435897436
5567744,5,B00BAXTYI0,"My boyhood entailed nightly television watching. I grew up with Bonanza and Gunsmoke and Wild Wild West and countless other westerns. Have Gun Will Travel ended when I was only six and a half, but it never ceased to linger in my earliest memories. The series was written by some of the greatest of the era, like Gene Roddenberry (Star Trek) and Bruce Geller (Mission: Impossible). Theirs, all my favourites, become classics of the small screen... with justification. Have Gun Will Travel was nominated for three Emmy Awards. When I learned that this full series was to be released at long last, I was ecstatic. I had hoped that the set would be specially packaged in a single box or binder, with a booklet containing photographs and information about the series, etc., but they have chosen to simply bundle all of the previously issued seasons. In the end, it is the DVDs that count. All 225 episodes are included. This is the classic of all classic westerns, so what more could one want? There must be about 100 hours of entertainment. The current price is $200 in Canada and $290 in the States. Go figure... and you'll certainly decide to get it right away!",1369699200,33,1159,4.686274509803922

5567776,2,B00BAXTYI0,So far the first two seasons closed captioning is in Spanish if you can believe that!....The sound quality is terrible. I have old VHS tapes of the entire series and they are much better.,1523145600,,187,4.529411764705882
5567777,5,B00BAXTYI0,If you are into Westerns you will like this series probably second best after Gun Smoke not the same video quality tough since some of the episodes were not digitally enhanced don't know the reason.,1523145600,,198,4.685714285714286

5567779,5,B00BAXTYI0,This is a great series about a gunfighter with good story lines. I love these old westerns! I wasn't even born yet but these are awesome! Delivered in very good time. And price was pretty good too. Highly recommend it.,1522713600,,218,4.475
5567780,1,B00BAXTYI0,"Watched the show with my parents from the time it premiered.  Fortunately, I must have been out of the room frequently enough that I didn't see just how amoral, condescending, superficial, and profiteering the character of Palladin, as written in these scripts, truly is.  And I don't say this in retrospect.  Had I seen these episodes in full, I would have absented myself each time they were televised.  Palladin is a pig.  Give me Josh Randall (Wanted Dead or Alive), or Yancy Derringer any time.  Palladin was a pig.",1522540800,,520,4.786516853932584
5567781,5,B00BAXTYI0,"Love this series as an adult.  As a child under ten, I could not understand the plots, but now I look forward to viewing a couple each evening.  Each episode has a twist in the plot line.  Some are very amusing.  Some are thought provoking.  All are entertaining.",1522368000,,263,4.395833333333333
5567782,5,B00BAXTYI0,It is a great show and seeing some of the actors young again was fun.,1520985600,,69,3.6666666666666665

5567802,5,B00BAXTYI0,"Have Gun Will Travel is a most extraordinary theatrical and literary treasure.  A philosopher soldier with character and courage fights all sorts of injustice primarily with his wits and lastly with his gun.  A lost golden age of television classic, it is a must for the building of integrity and morality in an age of emptiness.",1516060800,,329,4.857142857142857
5567803,5,B00BAXTYI0,Stories with actual morals. To bad the entertainment industry has degraded to such low levels since this show was televised.,1514505600,,124,5.25
5567804,5,B00BAXTYI0,"Show itself is top-notch, which is why Ive given it a five star rating. I refuse to dock the show stars because of packaging, or faulty manufacturing.  Bearing that in mind, I need to warn those of you who are thinking of purchasing this of my experience.  I got my first set in the mail, and found that the episode Winchester quarantine on disc One wouldnt play. It would completely freeze, forcing me to actually unplug my player and plug it back in to eject the disc.  I say my first set because I returned this set and got a new one to replace it, and found the exact same thing happened on the same disk. Same episode. It played a little further before freezing, but freeze it did.  And Ive gone through most of the set, and so far, this is the only episode has any problems. However, since I already returned it once, Ive decided to just bite my  tongue, and just enjoy the rest of the show. Its a pity, though, that one has to think about these things now when buying DVDs. I figured there probably wasn't any point in returning the package again, since its probably a manufacturing issue, not an Amazon issue. What are the odds of that happening in the same spot on the same desk twice?",1513728000,5,1194,4.3125

5567807,5,B00BAXTYI0,I am a long-time fan of this series.  Richard Boone elevates all of his work.  And the stories are all very well written.,1512604800,2,121,4.217391304347826
5567808,5,B00BAXTYI0,"Richard Boone was a thoughtful and serious actor, and so must have felt a great satisfaction in playing a 'thoughtful gunman' in the Old West. Although Paladin often professed the desire to settle every situation without gun play if possible, his rivals in most shows didn't afford him that opportunity. Its a rare show that Paladin didn't have to shoot someone ... sometimes a few someones.

Despite many story corners having to be cut to fit these stories into a 30 minute format, each story is interesting and compelling, virtually always with a twist that keep them from being some of the many Western clich&eacute;s. Now that the series has been resurrected, generations who had no opportunity to appreciate this fine series in years past can now discover it for themselves.

This is yet another example of how many television shows from the 50s and early 60s were far superior to most of what is filmed now. The 4th season has some delightful episodes ... very different and intriguing story lines for a Western. Paladin even helps Phileas Fogg along on his travels! Ken Curtis appears in what may have been an inspiration for his later role of Festus on Gun Smoke. If you have cable or satellite, you can also currently view this series on Encore Westerns.",1511568000,,1263,4.7889908256880735

Also the layout of the box set is awkward and flimsy and mine arrived cracked in pieces.  I'm trying to determine if i should return this in exchange for a different version maybe that might have English subtitles and/or Closed Captioning available.  I cannot find a way to communicate with Amazon about this.

Some of the story lines are over done, but you have to remember this was the first time they were done, then the later shows stole them. I loved this series. I watched reruns as a child and hadn't seen them in 40 years.

5567850,5,B00BAXTYI0,"""...is the man called Paladin.""

Many times one has fond memories of the older TV programs. When they are finally distributed and bought, it is a shocker to find that they are sophomoric or just long cigarette commercials. Well this time you will not be disappointed.

Each episode must find a conflict and solve it in an extraordinarily short time. Each with a moral and still maintain the entertainment value. One of the ways this is accomplished is the use of a wide spectrum of writers; many of the stories are adoptions of classics or became classics of other programs and/or movies.

Is it possible for a series to get better instead of fading to the mundane? Yes the second season has dropped the extras, with the exception of a quick synopsis of plot and actors, in place of packing in the stories at six or seven a disk. I press the play all button. I will not go through the list of actors as it is fun to be surprised.

One of the finer points of this series is that there usually is no clear cut hero or villain as the characters and themes of the stories are as complete as many ancient myths. We can see virtues and faults in everyone and many times there is no such thing as a clear-cut winner or loser.

Paladin (Richard Boone), a well chosen name as on a chess board there are many moves available, lives in San Francisco and most people assumes he has investments all over the west as he is taking frequent trips to protect them. We know different as ""Have Gun Will Travel"" he makes his fortune on his many skills. Every once in a while we get a gimps of his past as we know he went to West Point and can quote many ancient writings and wars. He has an uncanny way of knowing what the meanings of names are. Yet who ever he really is many people are better off for knowing him. And so are we.

A side benefit is recognizing the list of star (actors) and stars in the making.",1497571200,2,1892,4.270949720670391

MacLaglan. They've all been solid, the guest casts are impressive (Charles Bronson, Strother Martin twice, John Dehner, Mike Connors to name a handful) and some of the dialogue smart and funny, but I'm looking forward to the later episodes when Richard Boone was more settled into the part.

I did not buy my set on Amazon but no matter. I would urge those fans of this show to buy the complete set. My only complaint (so far) is the packaging, a minor one. I think this is Boone's finest work. The pilot for ""Hec ramsy"" is on YouTube and it is watchable and I hope someday to see a complete set, restored on Amazon to buy.

5567987,5,B00BAXTYI0,"Unappreciated and unknown by most viewers today. A gunslinger with a moral code, intent on solving problems without using his gun. Richard Boone plays an unlikely gentleman living in the Carlton Hotel in San Francisco who is a consummate lover of the arts, classic literature, travel, fine wines, and of course fine women. When in San Francisco his character is a bit humorous and campy. When he straps on his gun and takes a job, he shines. I really enjoy this series from the late 50's- early 60's.

The DVD set is really a compilation of different productions in one box. The original films do not lend to the very best audio (especially in the early seasons) but it is adequate. You will strain at times to hear what is said Some of the problem is the sound engineering techniques of the time of filming. It gets better as you go. I love this series and anxious to watch it again. I would highly recommend this series and set to anyone who enjoys old black and white westerns that have intelligent characters.",1471910400,28,1013,4.565934065934066

The authors weave the classics of world literature into the stories around their protagonist a man called Paladin played by Richard Boone. The integration of world literature in an easy and natural way involving cinema stars of the era makes this collection a unique one and well worth watching. In one story a man buys a set of dishes each day and throws them out at the end of the day. He also plants his fields with sweet peas that have a beautiful flowers but bear no usable crop. Is he crazy? Watch that episode and find out for yourself. This is not quite Twilight Zone but it is that good in a different way.

Excellent writers, amazing guest stars, and Richard Boone as the conscience of the old west. I mean how many other westerns had episodes that were ""Based on a story by Guy de Maupassant""?

Seasons 1-4 are in a oversized (largest I have ever seen) clear DVD case with undersized spine artwork.  Season 5-6 are in a normal size case that functions perfectly.  When opening the oversized Season 1-4 case you will probably discover that your case and hinge assembly are broken from the weight of all those DVD in a small area.  The discs are staggered in a two disc combination per page side, so if want the disc underneath you have to leave the top one out.  Most of the discs seem to have been hand collated with numerous scratches and fingerprints to prove it.  I love this show and will buy it in the individual sets.",1465430400,36,766,4.428571428571429

5568078,5,B00BAXTYI0,"Have Gun  Will Travel is an American Western television series that aired on CBS from 1957 through 1963
There were 225 episodes, it follows the adventures of a man called ""Paladin, a gentleman gunfighter played by Richard Boone. He was the only western hero that I can recall, that had a mustache and popularized the look of the man in black, similar to Johnny Cash and yet in a way , quite reminded me of Guy Williams as Don Diego and Zorro, with an almost identical mustache and switching clothes from his business suit to his working black attire. This look of black was so popular over the years, that many rock stars, including Roy Orbison,  and people in general like to use it. Paladin was also the first person I know who popularized the business card. And one of the greatest theme songs by Johnny Western  Have Gun Will Travel Reads The Card Of A Man.

5568096,5,B00BAXTYI0,"This is a series I hold in the highest regard. In my opinion it was not only the best western of this period but one of the best series,period. However this review is about only the picture quality of these discs. Seasons one through three are shameful. They are murky, muddy, full of garbage. On a scale of one to five ,a two. There is no way they went to the original masters to create these dvds. Seasons four through six are much better, why, I don't know. This is a series that should have been treated with respect but it wasn't, probably because the market for it is not that big. To Paramount it's just another '50's western tv show. No extras either. A lot could've been done in that area.",1451174400,3,698,4.295454545454546

5568100,5,B00BAXTYI0,"Although my review here is not about the format, my review is that the series is excellent. I saw the series when it was originally shown, being 70 years old myself. And I bought the entire series on VHS format from Columbia House back when it was sold there - in the 80s. At about $9 per 4-episode cassette tape, that total was approximately $500 back in the eighties. So, this deal at Amazon is a bargain since the price is less and the format is up to date.
  But I digress; the series is the meat of this. In addition to the morality it projects, and the cleanliness of the vocabulary and subject matter, to which other reviews lay good claim, I add that there is some early footage of actors that later became famous - like George Kennedy and Charles Bronson. Plus, some great lines, ""A man that can't work a gun shouldn't be west of the Mississippi."" These are but examples, of course.
  Some episodes are stronger than others. But, as a series, this is likely the highest point of TV's value to our civilization, at least until CNN pioneered 24 hour news and FOX perfected it. Did I digress again? Enjoy the series, one episode at a time.",1444780800,3,1145,4.386792452830188

Get this show. A great blast from the past. When TV was worth watching.",1440633600,,155,4.2
5568105,5,B00BAXTYI0,"I was a tv western fan back in the '50's and early '60's. I watched many series, always in anticipation of the shootout showdown, and hoping that it would be a good one. I wasn't a faithful follower of ""Have Gun"", because if I recall.., it aired on a Friday evening, when I was out or watching something else. In 2014, while visiting family, I watched some daily episodes on a cable station that I don't have. I watched for nostalgia's sake, and this time around I enjoyed the writing of the episodes, as well as the philosophy, knowledge, and poetry lines that he would spout now and then throughout each episode. The Amazon price initially was too steep for me, but I occasionally checked the product availability until I discovered the complete series on sale at more than 50% off the original price. I immediately made the purchase, and have been enjoying episodes daily. Thank you, Amazon.com.",1439510400,2,898,4.689873417721519

5568107,5,B00BAXTYI0,"... but that wouldn't fit well on a business card, probably would not conjure up business, and most of all, would not have attracted viewers circa 1960 who were quite keen on Westerns at the time. Richard Boone seemed tailor made for the role of Paladin - a man seemingly with no first name, no family, and whose only anchor is the Hotel Carlton in San Francisco in which he lives when he is not out on a job. He is obviously well-educated, extremely good with a gun, and has a taste for the ladies but no lady in particular, even before Sean Connery as James Bond made that kind of thing acceptable. Paladin was such a good shot that he could have easily just been a mechanical assassin for hire had he so desired, but instead, you would be quite frustrated if you requested his services, told him to kill X, and then expected him to just go out and kill X in exchange for bags of money. Instead Paladin is a problem solver and a lover of justice, using his talent with a gun to defend himself and others only when necessary. As with some other Westerns of the late 50's and early 60's, the Western theme was used to tackle some of the thorny social issues of that turbulent time without coming out and saying so.

Give this show a chance if you have the time. I think it has aged very well. Highly recommended.",1428796800,26,1312,4.290322580645161

5568111,5,B00BAXTYI0,"Not your average Western. Especially not when one of the main writers was Gene Roddenbury. The topics, twists and morality that we love in Star Trek can easily be seen in an episode written by Roddenbury, just set 100 years in the past instead of 100 years in the future.",1422921600,,271,4.44
5568112,5,B00BAXTYI0,"The character of Paladin is a different type of western hired gunfighter he weighs the ethics of each and every situation he is hired for Paladin is well acquainted with the people, customs, dress, language, and gun fighting of the wild west he is also a cultured man he likes tailor made suits, speaks several foreign languages, well read, lives in a San Francisco luxury hotel, attends the opera, and enjoys the company of attractive women. My two favorite episodes are THE KID AND PRINCESS & THE GUNFIGHTER in both of these episodes he uses his intelligence and good old common sense rather than his gun to deal with these two separate issues, in THE KID episode Paladin kicks some butt, oh yes Paladin is a very good fist fighter. Sit back and watch Paladin go about his business both as a gentleman and gunfighter.",1422403200,2,819,4.655172413793103
5568113,5,B00BAXTYI0,I have been enjoying this wonderful collection since Christmas!  Each episode is full of excitement and tells ad story of the importance of honesty and character.

5568125,5,B00BAXTYI0,"Have Gun Will Travel was an intelligent, literate Film Noir/Western series. There has never been anything quite like it. Paladin is a complicated character: dark and mysterious, but idealistic and honorable. Most of the antagonists are equally complex. Richard Boone was obviously the key reason for the show's success, but the very high quality of the writing, directing, cinematography and editing were equally important.

Note that this collection does not come all in one tidy box; the DVDs are in separate boxes and cases by Season. By the way, I noticed that some of the incidental background music was used on The Twilight Zone, which was on the same network at the same time.",1419292800,5,683,4.991228070175438

5568127,5,B00BAXTYI0,"I bought this for my dad for Xmas because I remember being a little girl and watching the reruns with him.  He'd sit and not only tell me about the series, but also about his life when he watched them when they first aired.  So, back in the day, with VHS, he attempted to get all the seasons in a box set, but they were crazy expensive and they never released everything.  No more! Now there's a complete series set and so far I've heard no complaints from dad about the quality or special features.  If you're a Have Gun, Will Travel fan, then this is the only set you'll ever need.  The price was perfect because it was cheaper than buying the individual seasons.",1412467200,23,665,4.288

5568129,5,B00BAXTYI0,"I'm a huge Richard Boone fan . This and Gunsmoke , and the rifleman were a cut above all the other tv westerns . This was the best in my opinion . Richard Boone Is palladin a man with a rich history we only get glimpses of  in episodes where his travels bring him in contact with his past . He is well educated and worldly , and likes to live the good life in San Francisco . To support himself he reads the paper and when a situation arises requiring his skills he sends his card "" have gun will travel "" . Next we see him arriving  and meeting his client . From there the stories vary but palladin is a Moral man , not just a gun for hire . A gunfight is the last resort but if necessary he is the equal to all and better than most . Sometimes he will change sides , sometimes he quits . He follows his moral code without exception . If you like the western genre this show is kind of unique . Many episodes were written by Gene Roddenberry ( yes that Gene Roddenberry ) and you will not be disappointed .",1405555200,29,1007,3.9313725490196076

5568147,5,B00BAXTYI0,"Have Gun, Will Travel is one of the best western series of all times. For those who are unfamiliar with the series, Richard Boone played the main character, Paladin, a ""Knight in shining armor"" who lives a lavish lifestyle in at the Carlton Hotel in San Francisco, until his services are needed. A Chinese bellhop, HeyBoy (and later Heyboy's neice) bring to Paladin's attention, newspaper stories of those needing his assistance. He usually charges a fee of $1,000 but on occasion works for free.
Although he was is with his gun, he prefers not to use it unless absolutely necessary. Many of the popular actors of the  '70s and early '80's, appeared in the series, some in several episodes. Stuntman Hal Needham, Denver Pyle, and Charles Bronson are just a few who appeared regularly.

If you are a fan of '60's Westerns or like to see the bad guys "" get whta's comin' to 'em,"" then you'll love this series. I highly recommend it.",1394409600,,930,4.664634146341464

5568169,5,B00BAXTYI0,"all episodes of this series are available. As of the time I write this review, I have only watched 3 discs but the reproduced tv images are excellent! Stories from HAVE GUN, WILL TRAVEL are the best I have seen from the old TV Westerns. The discs contain some extra material on some of the guest stars' appearances in TV and Motion Pictures. I am 37 y/o male who could have never watched these episodes originally, but I was introduced to this show when it played on Encore Western. An excellent product and value!",1389657600,15,514,4.4787234042553195
5568170,5,B00BAXTYI0,All real good Pallidin shows. I just love all of them. Brings back childhood memories of Saturday night with buttered popcorn and that glass of soda- watching  Have Gun Will Travel !!!!!!!!!!,1389398400,,191,4.96875
5568171,5,B00BAXTYI0,"Have gun will travel was one of the first tv Westerns. It was also the first tv western to create thought driven plot lines in each episode. Good writing, strong character acting. Still quite entertaining today.",1388707200,,211,4.888888888888889
5568172,5,B00BAXTYI0,We have been watching the series since we got it in the mail.  The picture quality and sound are very good.  I had forgotten how much I enjoyed this series.  So fat we are up to Season 3 and I can't wait until we have a chance to view the last three seasons of discs.,1388707200,4,267,3.8181818181818183

5568174,5,B00BAXTYI0,"A classic and one of the first TV shows, especially in the Western genre, to have characters that aren't completely good or bad.  There are some interesting ethical dilemmas raised in the show and Paladin is a classic action hero/philosopher.  I say ""classic"" because that's been done a lot since, but not much on the small screen prior to him.",1387152000,2,344,4.716666666666667
8565053,3,B00BAXTYI0,"I love this series which is why I ordered it.  I had also ordered two other sets of westerns.  Upon arrival, still wrapped in the plastic, the set box sounded like something was loose.
No damage to the outer box, still wrapped but the actual dvd container for season 5-6 is severely damaged.  It looks like it was damaged sometime after (or perhaps before) being rewrapped.  I have yet to verify whether any damage to disks as it seems not obvious and I do not like to return as I WANT TO WATCH THEM.  Make note, tsk tsk.  Why would a seller send out a severely damaged dvd case?  Will have to buy individual replacements for 10 disks!",1530489600,,635,4.330508474576271

8565061,5,B00BAXTYI0,"Biased indeed! Oh yes, 5 stars! I love westerns and I am a huge Richard Boone fan, so I cannot be anything but biased. I fell in love with Have Gun Will Travel when I was a small kid. The series aired a little before my time, but I watch all the episodes later in syndication.  Paladin, the man in black, a Night in a savage land, a dealer of justice to the unjust.  Yes, Yes this and a whole lot more!

Yes, Paladin rides again in all his glory! Every episode at your beck and call. To enjoy again or relive days gone by. Either way, the box set is worth every penny! Some of the episodes were showing their age but others look brand new. Nevertheless, all of them were watchable. Considering Have Gun Will Travel ran from 1950 to 1963 and makes the series over fifty-five years old, I think all of the episodes just surviving all the years is a wonder in itself.

Some of the first few volumes have a sort of prologue and toward the end, its just the bare basics and nothing added. I really did not care either way. I loved them all!

The biggest thing besides popcorn you need to enjoy the series is a lot of time. There are 225 episodes. I think most episodes were a little under an hour. (I could be wrong about the time, I was too busy enjoying the show to be counting time.)

Lastly, I had been wanting all the seasons in one box set for a long time and this set was just what I had been looking for. However, I must confess that I also purchased this set to watch after having surgery for a health issue and I knew that I would be confined to bed for about a week.

So, if you are looking for a good time and some clean fun, put on your cowboy hat, wrap a bandana around your neck, put up your cowboy boots and set back and re-live the silver screen days of your youth. Or perhaps introduce the original man in black to a generation of fresh faces for everyones enjoyment. Either way, you cant go wrong with Have Gun Will Travel!

Just the two episodes with June Lockhart is worth the price alone!

Dont wait for years like I did, get your set ASAP!

Happy trails,
Your Ol Uncle Sawberry",1525564800,,2095,4.125307125307125
