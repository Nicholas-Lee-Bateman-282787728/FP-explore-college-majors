Small review.... In a nut shell : Single Princess comes to Earth on a extermination project from her Dad, to wipe out the humans. Falls in love with human(they call us monkeys) and elopes against Dear old Dad's wishes.",1211241600,3,248,4.533333333333333
2352964,1,B000A2WQUA,"Just not the same. WARNING, WARNING! The original dubbing was much better and more comical! The least U.S. Manga could've and should've done was given you the option to view both versions in a one or two disc set. The fun and thrills were gone for me. They blew it on this one. If you liked the original don't waste your time. Throw this one to the boneyard.",1159574400,18,358,4.279411764705882
2352965,5,B000A2WQUA,That alien Kaham can marry me anytime. That nerdy guy is so lucky cause earthly girls probably who give him their time of the day. Other reviewers are complaining about the script being written differently and the funny jokes are gone I mean blah blah just love the nudity and sex scenes in this video.,1148256000,5,302,4.509090909090909
2352966,1,B000A2WQUA,"This version of Outlanders has most of the lines written differently, various plot points changed, and even the main plot is not entirely the same.  Most of the humor is gone with the new script.  I would suggest watching the original instead.",1141344000,5,243,4.761904761904762
2352967,1,B000A2WQUA,"The orginal outlander was fun, This one is technial excellant and was as funny as a gw bushes budget. All of the funny jokes are missing. The Voice actors try but you can not do funny if there nothing to work with. They would have done better to have cleaned up the video and left the voices alone. Rent a copy of the vhs tape if you can find one",1139961600,4,346,3.9571428571428573
2353018,5,B000A2WQUA,"First of all, this is an excellent anime (based on the manga series by Johji Manabe; see also Capricorn); a solid 'must have' for any collector of 'Japanese Animation', though not one for the kiddies, as it contains graphic violence, nudity & (non explicit) sexual situations.
Despite these offensive-to-some elements, the story--which I won't spoil--is at times sweetly romantic, with a good deal of humor, and plenty of action, plus, our heroine, the lovely, be-horned and battle-bikini'd Princess Kahm, is one of the cutest anime-babes EVER, second in my view only to Urusei Yatsura's lovely, be-horned and tiger-stripe bikini'd Lum-chan (voiced by the same seiyuu, Fumi Hirano).
In short:
I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS TOO HIGHLY!
To close, a few details of possible interest to fellow otaku:
Produced in 1986 by Tatsunoko (probably best known Stateside for 'Speed Racer' & 'Robotech'), this OVA was first released here in 1993, by Books Nippon (the now long defunct U.S. subsidiary of Japanese publishing giant Nippon Shuppen Hanbai) under their 'adults only' Dark Image Entertainment label, unfortunately dubbed only.
This beautifully re-mastered version, produced & released by U.S. Manga Corps (the general anime 'arm' of Central Park Media, also defunct), features not only a fine subbed version, but a better dub as well; audio & video quality is SUPERB, and something I really appreciate, the original title card & end titles were left alone, plus, it has the original Victor video 'cover' illo--ahem!
Sorry, being a hopeless otaku, I do tend to ramble on a bit.
Janai!
I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS TOO HIGHLY!",1371513600,,1610,5.22007722007722
2353019,5,B000A2WQUA,"Some of the other reviews complained that the English dub is bad on this one (with a new script), I thoroughly loved it. Of course, I wouldn't bother watching it dubbed, so I don't know.

This timeless classic is one of the funnest, most entertaining anime I've ever watched. You simply can't help falling in love with the characters and the story is entertaining.",1359849600,,364,4.6875
2353020,1,B000A2WQUA,"My God.....what have they done.
The original dub was perfect. What would possibly make them think it needed to be redone???? It was original. Each character with their memorable quirks and unique manor of speech. The timing was perfect, delivery of jokes perfect. Why would they do this? I am extremely disappointed. How insulting to the original English language director. And to the fans of his amazing work.
Is this really what the kids of today want? They prefer this to the original version? Sad. Get the VHS folks. And burn it to DVD,VHS film is soon reaching its halflife. My copy has started dropping audio at some parts:(",1333065600,2,630,4.7889908256880735
2353021,1,B000A2WQUA,"I own both VHS. DUB. and DVD. HYB. The DUB. format on VHS. is worth 4-5 stars. DVD is worth only 0 stars. Wen they put it on DVD they butchered the script!!! They took a wonderful story destroyed it!!! If you want DUB. forget buying the DVD, Buy the VHS. format!!! I find my self watching it on VHS. instead of DVD, because the story is that much better.",1305331200,3,354,4.071428571428571
2353022,4,B000A2WQUA,"This was a one-shot OVA(original video animation)that was released in 1986, based on the manga series by Johji Manabe. He also created other manga titles such as Caravan Kidd and Drakuun, plus the anime/manga Capricorn. The entire manga was previously released in America through Dark Horse Comics. The anime was first put on dubbed VHS in the mid-90s through the now defunct Dark Image Entertainment, and is now available on DVD with a totally different dub by U.S. Manga Corps. The roles of the 4 main characters were actually decided over an online poll by anime fans.

The Outlanders OVA is about a bikini-clad alien princess with green hair(who isn't Lum!)named Kahm who comes to Earth in a single alien battleship to try invade it on her own. But while she's there, she encounters a hapless young photographer called Tetsuya. She immeadiately falls for him, and kidnaps him in the hopes of marrying him and uniting her people and humanity. It turns out Kahm's father, the Emperor, is planning on taking over Earth, so Kahm tries to stop him by announcing her ""engagement"" to Tetsuya. Unfortunately, her daddy don't like it, and sentences her wouldbe-hubby to death. But, Kahm's friends, the sexy catgirl Batia and drunk dogman Geobaldi, help free both of them and escape into space. They mostly save the Earth, although they leave room for a possible sequal.

Outlanders was one of America's first exposure to ""sexy sci-fi"" anime, even before there was much hentai available out here. There is some pretty gratuitous violence in it as well, especially with Kahm's killing spree at the beginning where she starts beheading several soldiers. But the ecchi-ness it what really makes this great grindhouse material.",1297641600,2,1717,5.021052631578947
2353023,1,B000A2WQUA,"How in the world could they have redone the English dubbing of this film.  If it's being celebrated more than 20 years later one would think that it was because of the screenplay and acting voice acting talent of the ORIGINAL voice actors.  BOUT NOOOO!!!!  Manga had to mess everything up by not only using different voice actors but CHANGING THE ENTIRE SCRIPT?!?!  It's a classic for a reason people, don't mess with the classics because you jus mess it up for everyone else.  DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!!",1279497600,11,501,4.584269662921348
2353024,1,B000A2WQUA,"This Video was the worst anime I have ever seen.
I wonder if it could have been improved if it had been done as a series That way they would not have had to skip the missing story line charcters and the fact that everyone dies.
Stupid Stupid Stupid!!!!!!!
YUK",1269993600,,259,4.2
2353025,5,B000A2WQUA,"You're not going to find many other anime that are as fun to watch and pretty as this one. Not only does Outlanders feature good-looking character designs and fluid animation, it's entertaining enough that you can watch it with friends who aren't anime fans without feeling too silly.

This DVD is underrated for two reasons. One, it's an old-school anime. While I prefer anime from the 80's (before all the real talent moved on to video games), some people just won't give it a chance. Also, this DVD has an all-new dub, and many fans prefer the old dub from the original VHS release. If you watch anime subtitled, or never heard the first dub, this won't matter to you.

This is definitely a five-star anime! Check it out.",1267401600,5,724,4.604651162790698
2353026,5,B000A2WQUA,"Its an old one, should be a classic really as its from about the earliest times anime was around that I know of. I reguard this as a classic rarity. Plot perhaps is a bit weak really as this type of plot in general has certainly been done over the years, but the characters are strong in my opinion. And also be wary of the english dub, use the sub instead.",1251417600,7,357,4.042253521126761
2353027,4,B000A2WQUA,"This product even though is out of print can still be purchased here. It was a better dub when I saw it before that license ran out. The new dub isn't as great. The sub is good. This anime has a small amount of nudity and adult content so if you are planning to buy this anime for a kid please be aware there is some of that content it should not be too much of a problem for a minor 16 and older. This anime is about a Princess named Kahm (Calm) who goes to earth to let them know that the humans are to be removed from the holy planet. She runs into a 19 year old man who is a journalist, Tetsuya. Now Kahm never have felt the touch of a man. So she goes to Earth in the search for a lover. Tetsuya tries to be a hero and stopping the princess from decimating the army. She runs at him going to swing her sword and he blocks with his camera when it flashes and blinds/stuns Kahm and he takes advantage and uses all his strength to get close and prevent her from swinging her sword then he noticed how beautiful she is and has a small nose bleed and she feels something stir between them as Tetsuya's body responds to what every young man does in a situation such as that. A beautiful alien, hot body, nice curves and she feels the change down below and she makes this known to him and he gets all flustered and pushes away and she walks up to him and kisses him on the lips then knocks him out and kidnaps him into her ship and.. she professes her love for him and takes him to her home planet.

There is a lot of action as a coming of age romance boils between them he falls in love with her.

Plenty of lasers, swords and giant cats, cute alien cat girl, a dog and a ram makes this for a odd anime. It is a good watch

Enjoy",1238716800,5,1728,3.9314285714285715
8073037,5,B000A2WQUA,"when Outlanders came to I have been knowing other anime such as Urusei Yatsura for Outlanders however they borrow heavily from Urusei Yatsura this anime has English dub actors such as Sean Schemmel from my favorite Shounen anime from Toonami Dragon Ball Z and it is released by Central Park Media instead of Funimation however the original Japanese dub version of Outlanders did feature Fumi Hirano from Rumiko Takahashi's first work of all time is the anime series Urusei Yatsura for the character however Princess Kham is another Scantily Clad anime character very similar to Lum from Urusei Yatsura indeed however this anime is like a cross between Heavy Metal and Star Wars combined because at the end we see Tetsuya and Kham are making love in bed and I thought to myself ""Oh I get it I seen it in Live action Horror Movies I seen it in Live action romance movies I seen it in Adult Cartoon movies I seen it in plenty of Anime"" and if you love this anime I recommend you other anime such as Urusei Yatsura, Project A-Ko, Fist of the North Star and other anime out there this anime is recommended for Mature audiences because Outlanders has Nudity and Sexual Situations I guess it's good for Mature audiences it's not really for kids I guess this anime can be great for adults to watch along with Urotsukidoji except for kid's anime such as Digimon and Pok&eacute;mon or anything like that check this anime for your anime collection for your anime library.",1493424000,,1460,4.662790697674419

8073041,5,B000A2WQUA,"Never seeing the original Dubbed version and thankfully having the remake, I would say I enjoyed this short action packed romance sci-fi OVA. The story is around two young lovers that meet during a battle and fall in love. The princess Calm takes our hero to her ship and plans to marry her man against her father's wishes. Typical teenage and young adult movie style. Not everyone will agree to this review for one reason or another.

This is Hentai Anime so this is not for children as mild nudity and profanity are around this film. If you are a collector of Hentai Anime, this is a must for your collection. As it is Rare... Get it while you can because it will increase in value over the years. So what if the original was better.. Be thankful that this issue was made and enjoy.",1424476800,,784,4.406896551724138
8073042,2,B000A2WQUA,"One of those titles you've seen a thousand times and loved it,,,, in it's ORIGINAL format. The re-mastered script is far less entertaining then the original dub in my opinion.",1407542400,,175,4.866666666666666
8073043,2,B000A2WQUA,"Would be one star, but it gets a second since it's BASED on a movie which ORIGINALLY was awesome... lost the rest due to HORRIBLE re-dubbing which includes CHANGING THE WORDS FROM WHAT THE CHARACTERS ORIGINALLY SAID! I would have paid DOUBLE to get the ACTUAL ORIGINAL MOVIE, UNALTERED! This was a HUGE disappointment; if you have ever seen the original THIS IS NOT IT, this should be banned for misleading advertising!",1405814400,,419,4.833333333333333

8073045,4,B000A2WQUA,"in fall of '93 the comic shop i was frequenting closed down, and several bits and pieces were offered to the manager in addition to his final wages. some of these he sold to me (which included an art book by Yoshitaka Amano, a Gundam Artbook highlighting the various series', and a set of art prints from Macross, so these were relatively 'big ticket' items for about half price) as part of my growing interest in manga, he threw in several back issues, a few of which were Dark Horse Comics' issues of Outlanders. taking my haul to my friend Miwa's place, she ooo'ed and ahh'ed over the stuff (as she was the one who was beginning to get me more and more interested in both artforms so id have a better understanding of the relationship between the two) and when she saw Outlanders, she got wistful for a moment, ran her hands over the covers and smiled, she explained that she'd started out with the usual girl's faire, for comics, but had definitely taken a shine to boy's manga, and the first one she read was Outlanders. she smirked and teased me saying that ' you'll love the series, lots of naked girls, space battles, and sword fights, LOTS AND LOTS of sword fights...' she didn't spoil much of the story for me, as she saw that the back issues i had bounced around a lot, and took me by the hand and said 'lets go to Hastings (an enterainment store a few blocks down from where she lived) and go rent the OAV, i know they got it...' so the two of us did so, regrettably it was the english dub, which had some horrible lines in it, but we laughed it off, and by the time the story was over, we were both sore from laughing so much.
while this updated has the same video, it definately was worth the wait. while the changes to the script left me wondering what was going on with them, it was still enough from the original that i was able to keep up with both the english and japanese versions. the main thing to keep in mind, is that this ova, actually only spans about the first 18 issues, and very quickly at that. we meet Kham and Tetuya in issue 1, but it's not till issue 4 that they have their fight, and Kham doesnt so much klong tetsuya on the head, as inadertantly takes him with her when she's forced to evacuate or be destroyed. in fact, while Tetsuya IS smitten by her, it really isn't 'love at first sight' and its not till after the two have come to know each other, that the two begin their relationship. likewise, while Bhatia shows up early, she doesnt have quite the same role in the ova. the story then jumps several issues to meet Quevas (The Emperor) and several important sub-plots are removed entirely (such as Japan and the US are both destroyed, scoured from the face of the planet) Japan is destroyed by Bhatia (by accident), and Geobaldi destroys the US (on purpose) the swordfight between Tetsuya and Geobaldi is actually from a LATER issue than the ova covers, and is played out mostly to show the scene, as well as Geo's change of heart towards Tetsuya.
as for the new voices. im not going to lie, outside of some of the changes to the script, i prefer these new voices over the old ones. Trish Ledoux's voice has long annoyed me, and i tended to avoid anything with her after a while. The new VA for Kham plays both the Tough and ready to rumble Princess the way ive always seen her, brash, headstrong, yet surprisingly demure and coquettish in private, with a much more husky, and come-hither voice. as for the Japanese VA, im all for Fumi Hirano (Lum) to be playing another green-haired, horned, space princess.
there are a few lines from the english dub i wish could have stayed like ""Come on Chim-Chim."" (Bhatia to Tetsuya), ""Do you think they'll be able to keep up with him, Swinging through the branches"" (Kham to Bhatia), and ""Excuse us Captain, your men want to LIVE"" ""You're Excused."" (The XO Gari to Geobaldi) and of course the best line: ""In the Name of Santovasku, Target the usurper's ship....AND FIRE..."" (Geobaldi, firing on Proress' ship)
considering that ive had the VHS for nigh on 20+ years, and missed out on the DVD originally, im very glad to have this as part of my collection. some may grumble and complain over the new voices, to me, they're an improvement, my only gripe is the complete re-write of the script. (oh, and that they didn't do like 5 or 6 ova's covering more of the story rather than the one-shot)",1393372800,,4375,4.402469135802469
8073046,5,B000A2WQUA,A romantic comedy that is rather endearing and makes the viewer truely feel for the main characters.  :] excellent story,1373846400,,120,5.0
