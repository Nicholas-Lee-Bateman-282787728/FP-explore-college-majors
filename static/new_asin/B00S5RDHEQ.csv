8697406,3,B00S5RDHEQ,"Fans of Killer Klowns From Outer Space may like this,features old school animatronics and puppetry. More silly than scary seems to be a Hungarian production and ok if you're in the right mood. Interestingly it takes place in 1983.",1453075200,,230,4.923076923076923
8697407,1,B00S5RDHEQ,Steer clear from this ugly disaster. This film seemed like a middle school student wrote the dialogue. Completely juvenille. The only thing I can give credit to was whoever was behind the set designs did a commendable job. As for the creature effects what a piece of trash they were. Take it from a horror lover this is a complete waste of time.,1434758400,,345,4.492063492063492
