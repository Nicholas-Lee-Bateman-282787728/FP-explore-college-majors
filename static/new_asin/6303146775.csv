8063384,5,6303146775,"This is the collection of video tapes which we purchasers of tractor parts (in this case, the Agri-Fab flat pulley) have been hoping someone would mistakenly send us for years!  Oddly, it seems that too often the moment an esoteric machine part is ordered WHAMMO! no more mystery regarding the item you might expect in the mail.  With this ""PART 48883 Pulley, 3-5/8"" Flat"", the manufacturer has introduced the element of surprise into online ordering.  And it doesn't stop with the PART 48883, either.  I ordered a pair of ""PART 233/a Two-Way Rear Supported Junction Flanges"", and what did those nuts at Agri-Fab send me?  Yep!  The cutest pair of Capuchin monkeys you have ever seen!  And a case of French Vanilla creamer.  I am so happy with my purchases.",1338076800,,757,4.769230769230769
