For starters the video transfer wasn't really much better than VHS, it would seem they just recorded a VHS on DVD without bothering to find a master print. Then I notice that the movie was dramatically cut. Scenes where either missing, or trimmed down. It's like they used a made for TV cut of both the films. If it weren't for the fact that it came from a store I'd say this was just a cheap bootleg. I'd save my money and by something more useful instead, like a pack of gum.

On a bonus side This could be a way to allow you children to watch a Bruce Lee movie without any nudity and toned down violence at least compared to the originals.

P.S.
This version of Chinese Connection\ the real ""Fist of Fury"" Has a terrible dub that could really use an update.",1231027200,,922,4.232954545454546
7880350,5,6305013624,"Once the fitful laughter due to the poorly soundtracked dialogue died down, I settled down to a very entertaining Bruce Lee classic. Easily Lee's best film in my opinion. The music, fight scenes and plot are all spot on  and add to its charms. Here in the U.k the nunchuku scenes are cut but I  have the original X-cert that was released in the early 70's in U.K. Ha Ha!",927504000,2,370,4.271428571428571
