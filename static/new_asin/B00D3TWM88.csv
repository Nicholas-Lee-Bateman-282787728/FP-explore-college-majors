8589194,1,B00D3TWM88,"For the price I paid for this DVD I expected it to arrive brand new in unopened packaging and that is not what I received. I tried multiple times to contact the seller from Pro Nutrition in NJ and they NEVER pick up their phone and no voice mail. I would NOT buy from Pro Nutrition ever again. Thankfully, the DVD is in good shape but this is NOT like a regular Zumba class, it's multiple VERY VERY SHORT ""routines"" that hardly get your heart rate up. It's not to be recommended.",1397001600,,479,4.217391304347826
8589195,5,B00D3TWM88,Wow I definitely like it! It's the best way for doing exercise and dancing at the same time it's awesome i do recomend it!!,1395878400,,123,4.166666666666667
8589196,1,B00D3TWM88,Hard to follow. Didn't feel like it was produced with quality considering the price.  It's probably worth one's time to attend a class to pick up on the moves.,1394064000,,159,4.482758620689655
8589197,3,B00D3TWM88,"I have mixed feelings about this one.  I've done some of the other zumba dvds and they are pretty easy to follow, this one seemed a bit harder somehow.  I think the aerobic level could be beginning or intermediate, but the impact and dancey-ness vary.  Beginners may find themselves confused and the impact too much, while advanced people will probably not get a very good workout out of it.

In each session there is an instructor and two others with her, all doing the same steps, no modifiers in either direction.
There are 5 tracks on this:
Hava Nagila - Israeli:  Has a simple set of steps but starts to go impossibly fast and involves hopping around on one foot in a circle, and twisting feet.  There was just barely enough room in my basement, I'm glad I wasn't trying to do this in a living room.  The tune seems an odd choice for a workout dvd.
Sahara Oasis - Bellydance:  I liked this one alright, but I've been exposed to lots of bellydance, and taken a few community ed sessions of it. I wonder if the moves will be hard to figure out without any previous bellydance knowledge. I think it would be hard to follow exactly without some.
La Fiesta - Flamenco - mostly okay, one of the better ones. I like some of the flamenco moves.
El Marciano - Merengue - more like the standard zumba moves you'd expect. Probably my favorite.
Aromuzak - cooldown.  - Meh.

I will likely do it again, but it won't be my favorite.",1389052800,2,1423,4.396946564885496
8589198,5,B00D3TWM88,"LOVE this workout! It's a perfect add-on or great for 'light' day workouts. Who cares if Tanya's got too much makeup on? I bought it for the workout, NOT to critique the instructors looks...lol",1386720000,3,193,4.705882352941177
8589199,5,B00D3TWM88,It is a great workout video. Love it!  Have ordered all the fitness videos. I would advise everybody to order them!,1385424000,3,115,4.476190476190476
8589200,4,B00D3TWM88,"5 different and fun sessions back to back. Three beautiful ladies that inspire you to be fit and not flabby! It's over before you know it, and will make you sweat for sure. 20ish minutes total.",1380326400,4,193,4.388888888888889
