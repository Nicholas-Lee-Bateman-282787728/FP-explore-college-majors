3907199,5,B002CVQ7WU,"I had the privilege of watching ""Calle 13 Sin Mapa"" at HBO's New York International Latino Film Festival. It was a premiere event screening and Rene and Eduardo (Residente y Visitante) were present to speak on behalf of this film. This documentary was less about the group as musicians and more about them as human beings. Their approach to filmmaking gives the viewer an inside look at various communities in Latin America. From a gold mining community, to self-sufficient potato farmers we learn of the Latino diaspora. The group takes us on their personal exploration of Venezuela, Peru and Colombia to show us the beautiful culture that exists in these towns that are not on the map, thus the name of this documentary. We hear from the indigenous communities what it means to truly be an environmentalist and we learn the true foundation of music from a free town in Colombia. On a side note, watch out for a performance by an Afro-Latino as he puts the solar system to song!

All in all, this is a great film that I've already ordered to add to my personal collection. Not only did I learn more about Latin America, but I learned more about myself. This story is about Latin America today, and its a valuable lesson in the environmental sciences, sociology and political science.

Finally, I'd like to add that I had the chance to speak with Eduardo after the screening and he shared with me that this is only the first of a series of documentaries that they are looking to produce about Latin America. He mentioned to me that the footage of Mexico alone is something to look forward to, and I will.",1248912000,9,1604,4.624561403508772

8364433,5,B002CVQ7WU,"Very good documentary even though it is really self serving for Calle 13.  It is interesting to see the globalization and at the same time isolation for these communities in Latin America.  Hopefully, through the efforts of Calle 13 and others the culture of Latin America can be saved from the wages of Globalization.",1384732800,,318,4.87037037037037
