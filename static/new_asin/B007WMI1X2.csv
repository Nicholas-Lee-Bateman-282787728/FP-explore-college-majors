5113705,5,B007WMI1X2,"Buy from amazon.co.uk. Better yet buy the series 1-5 box set for ~$33 including shipping!

This is an excellent addition to my kids' homeschool curriculum. In fact I use Horrible Histories first to get them the basics and get them interested before digging deeper into anything. A big bonus is that I love it too!",1407024000,,313,4.6909090909090905
5113706,5,B007WMI1X2,Our 12 year old loves these!,1406764800,,28,3.8333333333333335
5113707,5,B007WMI1X2,Awesome however I wish they stated ahead of time that is was region specific. I can only watch them on the laptop. This is a GREAT alternative to boring textbooks!,1395878400,,163,4.466666666666667
5113708,5,B007WMI1X2,"The total cost of buying this exact box set from Amazon UK is ~$26, including postage to send it to you in America!  Buy it from the amazon.co.uk web site.

BTW, most computers/laptops etc. will allow you to watch DVDs from a different region (such as these ""Region 2"" European format DVDs).  Many times the computer will allow you to switch formats a total of 5 times before the format is locked in.  B/c we love to watch British DVDs, I keep my laptop set to British format, and we watch American DVDs on our DVD player or else someone else's computer.  :-)",1376956800,27,559,4.388349514563107
5113709,5,B007WMI1X2,"This excellent BBC series is fun, entertaining and amazing clever in that its humor works at both the adult and child's level. I've studied English History yet I'm continually amazed of new things I learn & cultural nuances that they bring up. I wish PBS or BBC America would import it for US markets.",1372118400,5,301,4.592592592592593
5113710,5,B007WMI1X2,"This is a very witty, stylish, cheeky and educational series of documentaries all rolled into one.  I bought it for my kids (ages 8 and 13) and they thoroughly enjoyed watching it.  In fact, even the adults were seriously entertained!",1359849600,3,234,4.825
5113711,5,B007WMI1X2,I only wish this had been on the air when I was in school; all history classes should be taught in this sort of format.  Looking forward to Season 4 on DVD!,1358553600,2,156,3.875
5113712,5,B007WMI1X2,Awesome series that give a lift to history lessons in secondary education.  Brand new box set received.  I am looking forward to sharing some interesting facts with my students...Merry Christmas & a Happy New Year to all!!,1356652800,2,222,4.972972972972973
5113713,5,B007WMI1X2,I teach middle school and my students absolutely love these! I show clips from the DVDs that pertain to our lessons. On Fridays they get a fun one! Make sure you have a region free DVD player to play the shows.,1456185600,,210,4.146341463414634
5113714,5,B007WMI1X2,"Love this series! I'm in America, so the show wasn't publicly available here. But I started catching clips from it on Youtube a couple of years ago, and would watch them all over and over again. Eventually most were taken off the site, so I finally decided to get the DVD's myself (I have a region-free DVD, which you MUST have in order to view these DVD's), and it's incredible! The cast it talented, and presents all of these historical facts in funny skits and musical numbers which help you learn, without even realizing it. I mean, I now can know all the kings and queens of England, from William the Conquerer to Elizabeth II, thanks to a clever song they sing in one episode. It's like any other song you love, where after you hear it a bunch of times you just memorize the lyrics, without even trying to! I highly recommend this.",1449360000,2,837,4.441558441558442
5113715,5,B007WMI1X2,Absolutely one of the best shows ever! Monty Python for kids...and adults too!!,1445212800,,79,5.153846153846154
5113716,5,B007WMI1X2,"You'll need a region free dvd player if you live in the US to watch these, but this series is so witty and fun it is well worth buying one! Highly recommended! :-)",1442102400,,163,3.9696969696969697
5113717,5,B007WMI1X2,Great series. Hard to format for computer since DVDs are not compatible with US DVD player,1440633600,,90,4.6875

5113720,5,B007WMI1X2,Love these shows.  We use them as part of our history home school class.  Region 2 DVDs work in our computer even without changing the firmware to region 2.  Awesome,1429833600,,165,4.433333333333334
5113721,5,B007WMI1X2,"My kids LOVE this! My husband was able to reconfigure it to play on an American TV. Also, as a note to teachers-- these DVD's play in my school computer just fine and the content is really fun to help teach about history!",1429228800,,221,4.162790697674419
5113722,3,B007WMI1X2,"Purchased this in the US. Unfortunately I neglected to note the format, and the discs don't play in any of our players. Went ahead and bought a program so that we could convert the discs, but ended up spending a lot more money than we wanted to. We love Horrible Histories, but they are difficult to obtain in the US. Please make them available and accessible in NTSC format!",1427241600,12,375,4.449275362318841

8522675,5,B007WMI1X2,The most entertaining historical progam ever. If you like British telivision you will love this. But you need to be able to play European format DVDs.,1497139200,,150,4.8076923076923075
8522676,5,B007WMI1X2,"I love Horrible Histories, and cannot seem to find links to streams that actually work. Well, I just found that Hulu has all episodes Seasons 1-6 of the UK version available, as well as the animated one from the US!!! So thrilled!!

Would still like to buy the UK version, if it ever becomes available for Region 1.",1490227200,,315,4.431034482758621
8522677,5,B007WMI1X2,"WE LOVE HORRIBLE HISTORIES!!! If you haven't seen it, you MUST!!!!! The ""Horrible/Yonder Six/Bill"" actors are some of the brightest and most talented professionals ever!",1484697600,,169,5.8
8522678,5,B007WMI1X2,"I had to convert an old laptop to watch these.  We love watching all the episodes.  Entertaining, fun, while learning!",1483401600,2,118,4.85
8522679,4,B007WMI1X2,"I watched this on Hulu a while back, and was thoroughly entertained! Now that my kids are old enough to enjoy it, decided to buy it on DVD. These are fun, keep my kid's attention and teach them little known history facts. The only thing that bothers me is how they trivialize death... It's all upbeat and jokey, it seems a bit desensitizing to me. (Thus only 4 stars) I always have discussions with my kids afterwards about the death parts... I ordered this from a UK site on here, and it was delivered here in the US under 2 weeks! I knew I might have trouble watching this on my video player, but I was up for the challenge. I was going to designate one of my DVD players on my computer to region 2, but my computer wouldn't even recognize these in order to change the region. I ended up experimenting with an old, simple DVD player: figured out how to change the region on it, and now we have a designated Horrible Histories DVD player!",1477612800,,939,4.280898876404494
8522680,5,B007WMI1X2,My kids love it! I just add to the true story and it's a complete history lesson!,1474416000,,81,3.823529411764706
8522681,5,B007WMI1X2,I know this show was made for kids but it's great for adults as well. I am learning so much about history and it's done in a fun way. The actors are hilarious and you'll grow to love them as you watch. Highly recommended.,1464912000,,221,4.045454545454546
8522682,5,B007WMI1X2,I bought a region free DVD just to watch these.  What a great show (although the potty humor is a bit much).,1457913600,,108,3.909090909090909
