8093429,5,B000BW3WH0,"I purchased this for my 3 year old who loves trains.  The price was great and ship was quick. It comes with 4 discs and a carry case (even better). My son especially loves the I Love Toy Train dvds.  This set includes I love Big Trains, parts 1,2 and 3 and I Love Toy Trains, The Best of Parts 1,2 and 3 along with 2 other discs.  For the price you can't go wrong, considering one I Love Toy Trains DVD is usually 10.99.",1316995200,,420,3.9176470588235293
