Once you get the hang of it, you will feel like a new person. For maximum benefit, you should practice Yoga at least 3 days a week. Don't be discouraged if you can do all the positions in the beginning. Yoga is a process; a lifestyle. You'll get there if you stick with it. The beauty of this video is that I took this same class with Murti many times and now I feel like I'm back in class again. Murti, has a wonderful way of explaining the moves with such clarity and enthusiasm! His tone makes you feel comfortable, peaceful.

If you EVER happen to be in Oahu or Austin when Murti is teaching a class, please treat yourself and learn from one of the best. Murti's energy and sincerity made me fall in love with Yoga.  Aloha & Namaste!",1314835200,,902,4.3
