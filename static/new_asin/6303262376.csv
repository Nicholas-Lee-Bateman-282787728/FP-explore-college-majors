7842955,5,6303262376,"This is a true, autobiographical story, about a boy who from his early childhood came to realize that he had the wrong physical gender. He identified with the female gender, and his mother had no problem letting him explore this venue. This fact in itself should give some food for thought to Americans, who even in the 21st century still believe homosexuality is perverse, sinful and wrong. Well, it is simply a matter of genes, no morality involved at all.
Born in 1928, he lived all his life dressed in female clothing, letting his hair flow gently around his face, and he hardly ever had to contend with discrimination in Germany, until Nazi Germany happened. At the end of WWII, he/she ends up on the wrong side of the German divide, and the socialist-communist East German regime harasses her, trying to use her as a spy.
It is a story of single-minded courage, though, and he certainly helped bring awareness to all who knew him. He was a public curator in historic buildings around Berlin, and he never hid his identification for one minute. It should be mandatory viewing for all young folks who share the same path, and also for those who want to find out more about what it means to be born with the wrong-gendered body.
Watch it, even if it is in German with subtitles. You will come away enlightened!",1367539200,,1313,4.615384615384615
