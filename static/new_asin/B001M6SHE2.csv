3693952,5,B001M6SHE2,"Being a major fan of Kannazuki No Miko and having learned of the slight character reference I just had to buy this. I'm glad I did! Although I'm not one for so much romance and men that turn out to be super jerks (I won't say who, can't spoil it for any of you :D) Anyway, ranting aside, though there were a few moments that did just out and out piss me off, this is one of those animes that you just can't help but get so into it to the point that you're screaming things at your t.v. I would recommend this to really ANY anime fan ^^",1280448000,9,535,3.9174311926605503
3693953,3,B001M6SHE2,"Be Warned: this is a follow-up (sequel) to Steel Angels (?), which I have not seen. While it claims to stand alone, it does so on one leg. Hence the ""OK"" rating. If it had been clearer about being a sequel, I'd have bought the first series and it may have seemed much better. So if you have seen the first series, ignore this review, if not, get the first series before watching this.",1275782400,10,384,4.202702702702703
3693954,4,B001M6SHE2,"Focused more on the romance side than the action side, but still delivers a good helping of both. If steel angel kurumi was your cup of tea then this is definately worth looking at",1240531200,5,180,4.323529411764706
3693955,5,B001M6SHE2,This anime is a tear jerker. I loved it but the ending was very sad like Kannazuki No Miko. If you enjoy romance animes that don't turn out like their suppose to then get this if you want the anime to be heartfelt but everything is as it should happen all happy then don't get this.,1240185600,41,282,4.053571428571429

3693957,3,B001M6SHE2,"Talk, talk, talk. This anime is filled with inner dialogs, monologs, narrative - and dialogs. As the words are prince this and flowery protestations that, complete with over saturated light, this was rough to start. Then the new guy bared the heroine's bra, giant mecha started battling, and action started to replace the sap. Much better. Still, this anime is so focused on cool boys, flamboyant clothing and soapy opera that I couldn't really get into it. The Japanese voice acting is good, but breathy and too much in the cool range. Animation is best during the action, but otherwise washed out with soft light and pastels.",1486425600,,627,4.869158878504673

I have to say that I was not dissapointed. The main character was kind of a cry baby. But also sweet, and careing. The guy was cool, and his devotion to her was amazing. The ending was a tear-jerker. I didn't cry, but my eyes were a misty. All in all it was a great show, and the price was a plus.",1456185600,,464,3.8947368421052633
3693965,1,B001M6SHE2,"This is bar far one of the most STUPIDEST animes I have ever seen. The main heroine (who doesn't even deserve such title), Kuu, is a girl that frickin dreams of a prince that she wishes to be real. Then comes your typical-classroom-heartthrob-new student that (LO AND BEHOLD) looks eeringly similar to Kuu's prince. Kuu, being such a weak character, is enthralled and fascinated by him. What I found annoying is that as she was watching him play the violin, he stops for a minute and then goes and opens her frickin shirt open in front of everyone! So she runs away crying, covering herself, BUT she doesn't stay mad at him. SHE LOVES HIM AND CONTINUES TO LOVE HIM (BARELY KNOWING WHO HE IS) EVEN THOUGH SHE KNEW THAT ANOTHER GIRL LOVED HIM LONGER, and honestly it's just a waste of your time. It's painfully annoying and I've come to find that apparently the whole series is just a basic copycat of another. So don't waste any money on this crap. From one otaku to another, you deserve to watch a much better anime.",1453161600,,1016,4.4972972972972975

3693996,2,B001M6SHE2,"Maybe this anime was aimed at women, maybe that means this review will be biased but equally Ive seen woman based shows that have done romance way better. Nonetheless Shattered Angels isn't one of them. Take a young teenage girl have her describe life from diary perspective and you'll understand our main heroine. Throw in a handsome looking possible male lead who is mysterious and you have cliche after cliche after cliche. This show never breaks from cliched romance tropes. The visuals are nice and the story has potential to be something interesting but the end result is a young girls creation of what romance seems like, something that doesn't transition well to anime in this day in age when romance stories like golden time or kanon exist.

Probably not but it is one to watch at least once.",1426636800,,312,4.131147540983607
3694001,2,B001M6SHE2,"So this one just frustrated the heck out of me.  The first annoyance was the over use of the ""My Dear Prince"".  Kuu uses this letter writing method to add to the conversations, but it is distracting as heck.  Sometimes it was used 3 times during the same short conversation.  Fortunately the usage went down and was mostly gone by episode 7 or so, but I just got so tired of it.  Second annoyance was that Kuu spent most of the series whining about how useless she was.  And the male lead, Kyoshiro, well I couldn't tell if he was good or bad or what, perhaps that was intended, but pretty hard to like a show when you hate the main characters.  Lastly there was very little action or humor.  I gave up on this one, skipping most of the last few episodes, and then of course I didn't fully understand why the ending was what it was.  I would pass on this one.",1426377600,6,859,4.189024390243903

3694025,4,B001M6SHE2,"The animation in this is beautiful, as is the music, the character design is very pretty, but then... Kuu, the mainbcharacyer, and even her romance interest, are rather obnoxious, Kuu can't go five minutes without recapping what she's just seen, which would be fine if it weren't for the constant ""dear prince, I hope this finds you well"" that stars each monologue, and each episode, and for kuu, probably each day, meal, breath and bowel movement(lowbrow I know, but picture her saying that before taking a dump). Whats really interesting in this are all the non main characters, cute, loud cat girl and quiet dude, warrior girl and servant girl and their love triangle with a warlord. Kyashiro is a jerk and Kuu, is an airhead(very pretty name though, despite the meaning.).",1388793600,,776,4.886363636363637
3694049,2,B001M6SHE2,"There are 12 episodes in this series. At least seven of them are filled with either Kuu's whining self-pity or Kyoshiro's pompous teenage angst. The story only really gets going when Kyoshiro's long lost brother turns up and turns out to be a complete monster. The last third of the series moves along well enough and the ending could be a tear jerker if you cared about the main characters at all at that point. I found I didn't.
This Is an SAVE version which features basic packaging and no extras. You get what you pay for and these versions are good value for money and generally well executed. Personally I'd avoid this and buy something else instead.",1381449600,,656,4.567796610169491
3694050,5,B001M6SHE2,i adored that it was a love story but it was not typical though on the flip side it did have a bit of a sad ending so ifc you are ko with that it was an all around awesome anime,1377993600,,177,3.341463414634146

3694052,2,B001M6SHE2,This title would make an excellent movie but it was a bit long and slow for a collection.  Take the $10 dollars and put in a fund that once you have enough for Amazon Prime then watch it.,1374796800,,187,3.9210526315789473
3694053,5,B001M6SHE2,This was a good series to get. I do feel like there should have been either more episode to this set or maybe even another season could've been stretched out of this.,1374278400,,166,4.21875

3694058,3,B001M6SHE2,"I would have given this anime two stars; however, the ending was nicely done - I have to amid it made me cry. The lead female character was underdeveloped and immature. The male lead was more likable as well as some other characters. The anime fell short in plot development and presentation of material. There was some beautiful scenes; however, most of the series was slow and uninteresting. It was confusing at times but did clear up a lot of things at the end. The end was beautiful and heart wrenching!

The story starts with a girl who meets a boy who reminds her of her ""prince"". The boys is on a mission to destroy dangerous weapons known as ""angels"" accompanied by his own ""angel"". The girls gets caught up in his mission and learns more about her past. Secrets and lies are revealed and characters must decided what they will sacrifice to get what they want.

15$ is a good price for an complete series and while this is not one of the better anime it is entertaining and the end makes it worth watching.",1364256000,11,1014,4.446236559139785

3694082,1,B001M6SHE2,Ok first off the cover makes it look like its a mech anime but its not its more like armor. I watched the first episode and my god its like nails on a chalkboard. The main girl is soooo stupid and of course she needs to be saved by another girl from a cat girl and she seems to have fallen in love with a guy who does almost nothing. He shows up as the battle is about halfway through on a horse no less and surfs on the armor of the chick who came to save the first chick durring the finishing move and after that I tossed it in to the trash becouse I couldn't toss it in a fire to send it back to hell.,1359849600,4,604,3.7265625

A young man named Kyoshiro transfers in and bears a strong resemblance to a man that she sees in her dreams. After saving her from a battle they begin to have a strong relationship.

This anime reminded me a lot of My-Hime. It has a very similar story line. The animation in this series is way better though. It's done very beautifully. All the way from the character designs, to the coloration and backgrounds. Like My-Hime it is a very touching and emotional story. The ending is especially tearful. My only complaint about this series is the length. It's amazing that they were able to fit so much emotion into a short series, but if it had been longer it may have bordered on epic. I don't like the word ""epic"" because it's used way too much, but this story would have been if it had been a bit more in depth. That being said Shattered Angels is a really good anime at a great price!",1350604800,2,1058,4.3979591836734695

But then the main character started talking again. Her flowery romantic dialogue is horrible! A large portion of the show is listening to her internal monologue where she talks to her imaginary prince or goes into way way way way too much detail describing something. Show, don't tell! Needless to say, I regret buying this. The only reason I didn't give it only one star is that I was only able to force myself through the first episode (and even then, I had to split it up into 3 sittings) and there is a slight possibility that it might get better.",1345507200,,704,4.3816793893129775

3694102,1,B001M6SHE2,"I bought this anime upon hearing the general premise, and seeing the trailer, which shows off how beautiful the animation and coloring is. I must say, however, that's about all this series has going for it.
The plot is dodgy, at best. The main character is beyond irritating, constantly going on about her 'prince' and she seemingly knows nothing, one of those mary-sues that has nothing going for her but everyone loves her for it. Also there is no character development anywhere in sight. Of course the main character that's naive and clumsy ends up being the ""super secret power"" that can save them all!
Putting all this aside, it's downright cheesy. There's shoujo sparkles everywhere, it's disturbingly over dramatic at least a little in every episode, and the way the dialogue is written does nothing but make it ten times worse.
I grew up being obsessed with shoujo - so I've seen a fair amount of lol-worthy sparkle and field-full-of-flowers scenes, but this series takes it to a new level that had me between boughts of vomiting and crying from laughing.",1325980800,15,1063,4.846153846153846
3694103,3,B001M6SHE2,The anime was ok but the main character repeated herself way too much and kinda got annoying. Overall it was ok just not quite what I was expecting.,1318464000,,148,4.321428571428571
3694104,3,B001M6SHE2,"I like the anime, but I wish that there was a happier ending.  It was sad that after everything that the 2 heros had went through that the heroine ended up dying or disappearing after she had found her true love.  From what I remember it was not a long anime, which sometimes is pretty good, but it was good to watch.  I was addicted to it from the beginning, but was kinda disappointed at the end. I am a romantic person, so I love to see anime's where the couples are happily together especially with everything that they have gone through to get to that point in time of happiness.",1299715200,,584,4.243243243243243
3694105,4,B001M6SHE2,"I really thought this was similar to Air but somehow it was only similar along the plot lines although a lot of you would disagree. I just found it a bit hard to imagine how an ""angel"" let alone and Absolute Angel could be a human's ""sword"". Anyways, I loved this anime and the drama. I'm glad there was close to no comedy in this one (except for that Absolute Angel who was a cat girl, I forgot her name) because that would defeat the purpose of the mood set. The lead characters are Kyoshiro and Kuu and there is a third wheel who happens to be Setsuna, Kyoshiro's Absolute Angel sword.
Absolute Angels can serve a human as a weapon of defense or offense hence they are referred to as swords. They suddenly transform into these robots to defend their masters. There is little ""science"" and ""mechanics"" involved because I believe this is purely in the realm of magic so don't expect any fancy mechanical terms mentioned like other mecha animes.
I rarely watch animes subbed. I love the voices of the English cast. They were appropriately chosen for the characters especially for Kuu and Kyoshiro. I also thought the voice of Kyoshiro's siblings were appropriately casted.
This series though is not for younger kids. They gave it a rating of TV 14 but I think it should be for those 16 above because of scenes of nudity and same sex undertones (hmmm, probably not undertones but I will leave it up to viewer to decide). But for shouju anime lovers I think you'll enjoy the joy of new love blooming between the lead and the heartbreak between the male lead and the female third wheel. I said this was a happy tragedy because it is (you have to watch it to figure it out). The series also leaves you guessing about Kuu and what she really is and why Kyoshiro goes to all this length to keep her by his side. It also throws several surprises at the viewer including this reviewer.",1295395200,4,1877,4.459302325581396
3694106,5,B001M6SHE2,"I bought this on a whim of mine, but usually those are the ones I end of loving. Though as I was watching the ending I kept thinking ""Hey I feel like I've watched this before."" So maybe it wasn't a whim at all...

The story is original enough, guy creates weapons (angels) to do the dirty work of fighting. Realizes that some people won't stop at just peace and would want more, guy tries to eliminate them all, guy dies in process and leaves his little brother in charge of it.

What I loved about it what that nothing was really that simple, there are secret and lies. It was the first anime that made me cry at the end, not because it was ""oh, so sad"" but because I'm a sucker for guys crying and it felt genuine.

The main character Kuu, didn't ask enough questions if you ask me. But maybe everyone is different. But you could see that by the end she grew as a character.

All in all, it was good and art is very beautiful.",1289779200,21,928,4.110497237569061

It doesn't leave you hanging with questions at the end, either (just be sure to watch through the credits for the full ending). Great story, definitely recommend watching it.",1287964800,,314,4.833333333333333

8320679,1,B001M6SHE2,"Well it's a pretty awful anime and it at least lasts 12 or so episodes before it peters out and dies. Cuckoo high school girl Ku Shiratori has demented fantasies about her dream ""prince"" boyfriend that she runs in her mind all the time apparently take from romance manga she has read. She falls for new student and unlikable, aloof weirdo Kyoshiro who she thinks is the perfect image of her dream boyfriend even though he pretty much acts like a giant perv towards her the first time they meet.

Kyoshiro is obsessed more with being like his seemingly dead brother Kazuya and his hatred for ""Absolute Angels"" to care for crazy Ku and her stupid dreams of love. He keeps an ""absolute angel"" by the name of Setsuna as a virtual slave girl to do his stupid bidding and treats her with contempt due to his utter hatred of what she is.

Oh brother our two leads are some of the most crazy and annoyingly unlikable ones I've ever seen. It's really telling when most of the side minor characters in the show are more likable leading material than the two leads we get. For instance we get one of Yu's friends who isn't a crazy lost in her own fantasies nutcase and you wonder why isn't she the lead girl? And Kyoshiro has at least 2 other siblings, one a brother who is a better main character than him and a sadistic lesbian sister who is an even bigger monster than Kyoshiro is.  And Ku for the most part puts up with Kyoshiro's garbage and not til the end does he realize how big of a jerk he really is.

The only joy you'll get out of this show is the utter ham that is  older brother Kazuya's return, oh spoilers that happen sorry folks but if you last to that point, you're very brave.  That's not to mention the over the top high school these kids go to which exists in some magical over the top realm where the  high school kids even have armed  squads that act like security forces for the school!?",1519689600,,1900,4.302521008403361

8320681,1,B001M6SHE2,"Out of the 100 or so anime that I've seen... this was the worst of them. (And I've seen some pretty bad anime. Diabolik Lovers was bad, but at least the hot, sadistic guys earned it enough points for me to watch it a second time. Uta no Prince-sama would have been awful if not for the amazing music that kept my interest.)

The story sounded like it could have been good, but the main girl is annoying and pretty cliche and everything I dislike about a female lead. (Nothing against female leads, but they are often done badly.) Not to mention that I saw nothing remotely interesting about any of the main guys. They were so uninteresting that I can't even remember any of their names. And don't even ask about the plot... it was so all over the place and didn't explain anything properly that I could barely understand anything that was going on.

I could have written a much better storyline than this and I've only been writing for fun for a few years....",1509580800,,959,4.4124293785310735
