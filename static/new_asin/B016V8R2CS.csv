7480294,5,B016V8R2CS,"I have spent a good deal of time watching youtube interviews and live performances of Ed from the early streams, the 100s and 100s of radio interviews to his well deserved break late 2015, so this blu-ray was a special treat. I'm in USA and it works on a regular sony blu-ray. It is a super-clean and well organized production. A mixture of pre-show anticipation, backstage interviews throughout from EVERYONE involved about the long road to that point and amazing footage of the full songs from the concert itself just saying when the crowd does thepump during Bloodstream, awesome.

Guy has his head on straight. He's focused, driven and super nice to damn near everyone. Highly recommended!",1453248000,2,693,4.923076923076923
7480295,5,B016V8R2CS,"My wife loved this, it was a same it was not more of the concert and the interviews added at the end or as an optional viewing.",1453161600,3,127,3.740740740740741

7480299,5,B016V8R2CS,"Gosh, what's there not to like about Ed Sheeran?  This is so wonderful to watch! We saw him in San Diego and it was the best concert ever!!! So glad to see so many adoring fans. He works so very hard at what he does. Ed gets up there all by himself. You are entranced throughout his performance. No need for backup singers, a band, or anything else. So glad Elton John is cheering him on.",1470096000,,388,4.105263157894737

7480301,5,B016V8R2CS,"Awesome concert. Incredible indeed, this young singer being able to perform such talented show, by himself, at Wembley stadium. No band, no choir, no dancers, just him and his guitar. The audience really enjoyed those 3 nights concert in July 2015. This Bluray will place you in first row of an amazing ""LIVE"" show that will last for decades. Ed Sheeran has a ""gifted"" voice, no doubt.",1459036800,2,385,4.7611940298507465

7480303,5,B016V8R2CS,"Ed Sheeran is an incredible performer!! The fact that he can keep the attention of an enormous stadium with just himself, a guitar, and loop pedal is amazing and definitely worth seeing for any of his fans or any fan of music! The movie is done well - nice mixture of interviews and behind the scenes while still showing huge portions of his performance - which is what I'm really watching for! Definitely worth the money!",1457136000,2,422,4.565789473684211

8737372,3,B016V8R2CS,"Good but difficult to understand the lyrics.  It is recorded live and the sound overpowers Ed's voice.  Buy ""DIVIDED"". It is still the best Ed has released.",1520899200,,156,4.7407407407407405
8737373,5,B016V8R2CS,"Ed Sheeran is so full of energy and life. You would never expect him to be a one man show and be able to do what he does, but he finds a way! The only thing is there is a little bit of profanity in it, so don't make the mistake of watching it in front of a little person like I did!

The seller's description says to be careful of watching in the US but I had no trouble watching the DVD on my Blueray or Xbox",1505088000,,409,3.647727272727273

8737375,5,B016V8R2CS,"Buy it. You won't be disappointed.  If you like Ed's music, you'll love this concert.  Ed Sheeran's 'X' Deluxe CD came with a standard definition DVD of this exact same concert, but I had to have the higher definition Blu-Ray.  There's no difference in features between the DVD and this Blu-Ray version except for the quality of the video.  Well worth the money.  I gave my standard DVD disc to a family member.",1496448000,2,411,4.575342465753424

8737378,5,B016V8R2CS,"The one thing that makes this an absolute must have is the duet with Sir Elton John. Presume that Ed continues his career on this course, you have a duet that features two generations greatest singer/songwriters on the stage together. If this Blu Ray goes out of print, that one performance makes this an investment for the ages. Like the Lego Death Star of musical concerts on Blu Ray. Overall, it's a great concert/biography... The inclusion of the duet was a surprise and was the ""turn it up to 11"" moment of his musical career thus far. Not everyone can do that so early in their career. I can't wait for the next iteration of Ed...what will it be though? Radical, Exponent, Function...I'm ready for higher math here. :~)",1495152000,,725,4.627906976744186
8737379,5,B016V8R2CS,"Great video which shows why this man is so popular, with everyone.  No singer works harder and gives more in his concerts than Ed.",1492473600,,130,4.416666666666667
