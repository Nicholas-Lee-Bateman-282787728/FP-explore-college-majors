7944821,3,B00005M1ZL,"I'm little bit dissapointed. At times Gato's sax sounded a tad out of tune & his vocals on one of the songs was a tad indistinct( we do know Gato to be a laid back person). I played this on both my full HD (Plasma & LCD) TV's and found the lighting pretty dark, even after adjusting the colour. The total number of songs on the DVD is also a tad low.
Overall i'd give the DVD 3 stars,",1247011200,,384,3.8734177215189876
