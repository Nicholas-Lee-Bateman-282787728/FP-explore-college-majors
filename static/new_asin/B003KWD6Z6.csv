8399005,1,B003KWD6Z6,"The one model who fits the description is Erica Campbell, and her entire short scene is spent in extreme closeup ' is that a thigh or an elbow... oh, look, it's a freakin' FOOT! That's real sexy. Not. If you like this, then you're probably already dead. If you don't, then there's hope. Just a bunch of women slowly, softly stripping windy layers off until you're deeply disappointed. This is the kind of ripoff that gives capitalism a bad name. Save your lousy $10 and throw it in the trash instead.",1199145600,13,500,4.5054945054945055
8399006,1,B003KWD6Z6,"I've seen a couple of Mystique titles and concluded that I've seen enough. They are generally very mild and feature babes that, while cute, are too ""everyday"" for me.

This dual title DVD features cute girls getting ""nude"". The problem is that's all they do - nude up and stand there (photo shoot style). Instead of other DVDs where the babes get sexy with bump and grind stripper action, this one features the girls just posing for photos - snooze. This gets real old real quick and you'll break your thumb of the FF button. To make it worse, there's NO PINK AT ALL.

Yes, they're are some exotic locations and its well-shot, but goes nowhere. It's made even worse by boring behind-the-scenes, meet-the-girls type fluff - i.e. TALKING. I don't care, just show me some *ss!

Get a (probably cheaper) Peach title instead. The babes are sexier, there's much less chat and the action is more explicit.",1191801600,17,898,4.670886075949367
