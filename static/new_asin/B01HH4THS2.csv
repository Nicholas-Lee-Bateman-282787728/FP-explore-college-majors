8765422,5,B01HH4THS2,"There are probably as many ways to legitimately criticize a film as there are films to criticize. I've always felt as if the most damning criticism was simply to be dismissive. A dismissive review is an attempt to negate the film entirely. When Blood Feast was initially released the Los Angeles Times review took all of one line- ""Blood Feast is a blot on the film industry, it should be erased.""

Mai-Chan's Daily Life is given about the same level of respect by the two reviews it has managed to elicit. I strongly feel that Mai-Chan deserves a much better evaluation than it has thus far been given.

Mai-Chan's Daily Life is essentially a political film and in making the statement I clearly think it intends to make, the film simply never wavers from its central, powerful argument. I understand why some viewers may find parts of it distasteful. Consider this however- any film in which a sadistic butcher pulls the heart out of the still living victim, itself an impossibility, and then takes the heart and moves it up to the victims mouth where the perpetrator eats part of it while trying to entice the victim to join her in this fresh snack, is a film that clearly intends to have you identify with and pity the victim, while simultaneously making it as clear as it is possibly can that Mai-Chan is in no sense a victim in the usual way. I found it very powerful and stunningly true that Mai-Chan works as an extraordinary good metaphor for the billions of people who because of their precarious positions are forced into  very real and very degrading lives.

Virtually every minute of the film demonstrates the maid Mai-Chan has, after many similar situations come to internalize the contempt and barely hidden hatred of her masters. In an evolutionary sense Mai-Chan is unquestionably superior to all of the characters that surround and torment her. She has it within to end all of it with horrendous consequences for all those who have hurt her, but a part of the films brilliance is that she never even considers such an action. Their incessant cruelty has taken from her even the ability to respond in an assertive self respecting, self protecting way. In one exquisitely sad moment Mai-Chan reminds the new maid (and a budding sociopathic torturer) to be very careful while they clean a particular room in which the very wealthy master displays small decorative items, which we never see, and that mean nothing to Mai-Chan. The master's feelings have largely displaced Mai-Chan's own.

Essentially Mai-Chan's Daily Life is a very sad tale, very powerfully told, about a young woman who thinks like a child and permits herself to be eternally exploited. She is an inexhaustible resource. Mai-Chan wants love where it cannot exist. She exists in the man made hell, an environment only she has the extraordinary power to alter, but the tragedy is we know she will never do it. She will never even know she can do it. In the final line of this excellent film she speaks optimistically about the possibility of affection, perhaps even love. A sad wish to sustain her until the next slaughter.",1505865600,3,3104,4.772811918063315

8765424,1,B01HH4THS2,"Mai-Chans Daily Life  The Movie (Bloody Carnal Residence) is based on a supposedly popular manga of the same name, and has been brought to the screen by director Sato Sade. It has been released on Blu-ray by Kino, as part of their usually dependable Redemption series.

Mai-Chans Daily Life begins as a young woman named Miyako applies for a position as a maid. She shows up for an interview, is immediately stripped naked as her measurements are taken, and subsequently gets the job. She meets a fellow maid named Mai-Chan, who teaches her the ropes around the mini-mansion, owned by a sadistic couple who share a strange and disgusting fetish.

One night, Miyako learns that Mai-Chan has an otherworldly power in which her body can heal and resurrect itself. The strange couple use this gift to their advantage, cutting the poor girl to ribbons, and at times, feasting on her flesh. No matter how much harm and pain they inflict on Mai-Chan, within a few days, her body completely restores itself and the cycle starts all over again.

Before long, Miyako develops a sexual attraction to Mai-Chan and decides that she wants to devour her. In an excruciatingly long and nauseating sequence, she does just that, with the help of the horny couple.

Mai-Chans Daily Life is a terrible film. It looks and sounds as if it was shot and recorded for a dollar and some change. Im almost positive that someone used iMovie to cut this thing together, because the editing is horrendous. The acting leaves much to be desired  the actress who plays Mai-Chan speaks in a nasally high-pitch squeal that grates on the nerves  and the gore effects are too dime-store cheap to be appropriately shocking. Thats a shame, since shock value is all that this piece of s*** has going for it. The only real shock here is the fact that this film found a distribution deal. Someone actually took the time to give this film a proper release. It baffles the mind that this production even saw the light of day to begin with, and its absolutely depressing that it was given a Blu-ray release of this caliber under a label like Kino.

If you're interested, the Kino release is the way to go. If you even care, there is a two-part documentary on how this thing was created.",1473206400,12,2241,4.67005076142132
