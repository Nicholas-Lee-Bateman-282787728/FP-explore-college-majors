4495080,5,B004XCUEXY,"This documentary is amazing. I watched it when it first aired on VH1 Classic commercial free. I couldn't walk away from the TV. I was captivated; I didn't even want to go outside for a smoke. There are all kinds of information in this documentary. Lots of concert footage and personal information for the band members. It starts from the very beginning of Dave's career. I'm talking all the way back before Nirvana. All of the band members get very personal as they talk about the journey with Foo Fighters. I just loved this documentary. If you are a Foo Fighters fan I would highly recommend getting this. I have pre-ordered it and can't wait to watch it again.

Here is the synopsis from foofighters.com

FOO FIGHTERS BACK AND FORTH chronicles the 16 year history of the Foo Fighters: from the band's very first songs created as cassette demos Dave Grohl recorded during his tenure as Nirvana's drummer, through its ascent to their Grammy-winning, multi-platinum, arena and stadium headlining status as one of the biggest rock bands on the planet.",1303430400,52,1050,4.8277777777777775

4495165,5,B004XCUEXY,"Awesome documentary... just recently fell in love with Foo Fighters and it was great to hear the story behind the band.  But why does Amazon tell you that you have a couple weeks to watch it, but then only gives you 48-72 hours before it expires?

4495196,5,B004XCUEXY,My 12-year old son and I watched this together three times in two days.  Not really appropriate for a 12-year old (lot's of f-bombs) but very inspiring for him as a beginning guitarist and music lover.  Dave Grohl is truly awesome -- no other way to put it.,1408492800,,257,4.333333333333333

4495199,5,B004XCUEXY,"Very interesting and entertaining. I don't think I like Dave Grohl very much, but it's impressive what he's done and that he let this movie show the real story, whether it was flattering to him or not. Very entertaining all the way through.",1405987200,,240,4.604651162790698

4495203,5,B004XCUEXY,"Great history of the band without crazy ""rock star"" non-sense"".  It is really cool to see a band act as if they take their music as an art and that it is truly their ""job"" and not in a bad way.  They are dedicated and despite Dave's connection to Nirvana he makes sure that the band is all about being new.  Great documentary.  I cannot recommend this enough.",1403481600,,359,4.235294117647059

4495208,5,B004XCUEXY,"This documentary, like all other things involving Dave Grohl, was a massive insight into the mind of a musical genius. The way he describes a lot of things in this allows for many basic truths about life and music to come through. Plus its a pretty cool history.

4495210,5,B004XCUEXY,"Just a great story for fans of the band. You get to see the real emotions of a group of musicians trying to find an identity as a unit. An interesting look at how dysfunctional the music industry can be, and definitely a must see for rock lovers.",1398470400,,246,4.145833333333333
4495211,5,B004XCUEXY,"I am a big Nirvana fan so when Foo Fighters came into my life I feel in love with them as well. This Rock Doc came out and showed a full 15 minutes about Nirvana I felt that was Dave's way to say ""yes I was in Nirvana, but it doesn't define me as a rocker. It was great time but I am me."" I love Dave and you can feel that he truly loves his family, Friends, and his band. Dave is the so down to earth you can not not love him.",1398384000,,427,3.5531914893617023
4495212,5,B004XCUEXY,"and then once I started, I couldn't stop watching.  Not only is the music as good today as the first time I heard it, but they are so cool too!",1398038400,,143,3.7666666666666666
4495213,5,B004XCUEXY,"Very good glimpse into the Foo world. I enjoyed it so much, I watched it twice or more. ;) Rent it!",1397865600,,99,3.761904761904762
4495214,5,B004XCUEXY,this is by far the greatest documentary that has ever been filmed. No wonder it won awards. definitely a must have.,1397606400,,115,4.523809523809524
4495215,5,B004XCUEXY,"I didn't know much about the story behind the Foo Fighters since I am a very seldom listener of their music, although I do like a lot of stuff they have written. The motivation to watch this documentary was inspired by reading the book ""This is a Call,"" a biography about the trials and tribulations of Dave Grohl's ascent in musical stardom. The first 100 pages of the book were really hard to follow and the writer seemed to lose my attention by throwing too many big words around and was too much of a name dropper that I prefered this documentary (""Back and Forth"") over the book I just mentioned (""This is a Call""). The book does go into great detail about certain situations and time periods but I feel that the documentary does a better job of keeping you entertained but these two mirrored one another very closely.",1397088000,,823,4.493333333333333
4495216,5,B004XCUEXY,Was a great story if you love the foo fighters this is for you was funny and makes you like them even more,1394064000,,106,3.652173913043478
4495217,5,B004XCUEXY,"'nuff said but I need 18 more words.  While this is a great DVD and I love the Foos, Dave has a real potty mouth ;)  If you are a FF fan you will love this.",1393804800,,156,3.3055555555555554
4495218,5,B004XCUEXY,"I love a good rockumentary, and this one was great. It is refreshing to see someone as successful and legendary as Dave Grohl still be so giddy about what he does - he is still excited and star struck by his surroundings. These guys work hard, and really shine as artists/musicians, rather than rock stars. I am going to go play a Foo Fighters album right now.",1393804800,,360,4.388059701492537
4495219,5,B004XCUEXY,Loved it! Great backstory to lead into the development and present day. Would love more even more of the behind the scenes of the recording of this latest album at his house.,1393200000,,174,4.46875
4495220,5,B004XCUEXY,"This is by far the best rock documentary i have ever seen.  With great insight Grohl tells the story and you get to hear lots of good stuff from Nirvana to FooFighters.  I bought this after seeing it on TV and bought a copy.  Then I bought one for my cousin.  Buy it, watch it, live it, enjoy!",1390262400,,293,4.0
4495221,5,B004XCUEXY,"Very well done documentary on the growth of the Foo that is more than just shots of them on the road, but digs into their own thoughts, emotions, relationships, struggles, and looks into those subtle connections and energy that must exist for a band to really gel and do good work.

You don't have to be a big Foo fan to totally enjoy this.",1389571200,,340,4.3125
4495222,5,B004XCUEXY,Documentary of the trying times and current history of what is now one of the worlds famous and legendary bands. Has it's surprises,1388707200,,131,4.739130434782608

4495224,5,B004XCUEXY,"I have always liked the Foo Fighters. Remember watching Pat Smear leave the band on TV and feeling absolutely crushed. I loved this movie because it reminded me of sitting in a garage smoking my cigarette and playing some good old fashioned imperfect music. But it was human. And this band is human. All that human comes out in the movie. It was interesting to me to see the ownership of feelings and fights and break ups and get back togethers.

It reminded me of all the discussions back in the day of ""isn't that the band that is just basically Nirvana with out Kurt?"" And all the discussions of how this is just a great stand alone band now.

I enjoyed the creative process too that was documented in the movie with how the various albums came to be.",1388016000,,754,4.378571428571429
4495225,5,B004XCUEXY,This is a fun and fascinating documentary about the Foo Fighters. Great for any fan. Lots of great footage I had not seen before.,1385510400,,129,4.416666666666667
4495226,5,B004XCUEXY,"If you're a music fan, and the kind of person who can appreciate something even more once you've learned about its history, this film is for you.  For those who don't know, Foo Fighters is the band assembled by Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl as he began the next musical chapter of his life, this time as a frontman.  It might be a stretch to say that if you weren't already a fan of Foo Fighters music that this film would make you one, but if you are intrigued by shows like ""Behind The Music"" and can appreciate the journey of a bonafide rockstar basically starting over, this film might just do it.

I've always liked them but after seeing this it made me like them even more, learning about their journey from a group of musicians assembled to play the music from Dave's self-made demo tape to millions of albums sold to the recording of their last album ""Wasting Light"" in Dave's garage.  It doesn't only cover the history of Foo Fighters but of each member's personal stories and how they all came to the point in their career when they joined Foo Fighters and how the experience has been for each of them.  I think it was a very smart move to include the footage of them making the Wasting Light album, as this film was released just before the album.  Watching them make that album made me instantly attached to it and when I listen to it I love thinking back to the film and remembering the stories behind the songs and what was going on while they recorded it.

The most interesting part of this film for me was how Dave fought to get past being known as just ""the drummer from Nirvana"" and wanted this to be a real band with its own identity.  Considering the level of success he has already reached before Foo Fighters, starting over and touring clubs in a van is not something everyone would do!  Enjoy the film and get Wasting Light!",1384819200,,1844,4.3841642228739
4495227,5,B004XCUEXY,"I have read the story of the Foo Fighters but seeing it on DVD, listening to the interviews was what I wanted.
I really enjoyed it!",1383436800,,131,4.076923076923077
4495228,5,B004XCUEXY,I love everything about this documentary. What else can I say.  I gave this to my niece for her 17th birthday who is a huge Foo Fighters fan and she absolutely love it.,1381881600,,168,4.090909090909091
4495229,5,B004XCUEXY,"What a great documentary about the Foos.  If you're a Foo fan, you'll love this.  If you're not a Foo fan, you'll become one.  And Dave Grohl comes through as a genius on so many levels.  Covers decades of music and Foos, I learned a lot that I didn't know.  Really great band, really great film!",1380844800,,296,4.214285714285714

4495233,5,B004XCUEXY,"One of the greatest music DVDs of all time. I love the Foos, but I don't think that you need to to really appreciate this.

4495234,5,B004XCUEXY,"I can't say enough about this flick (but I'm a lazy writer so this will be brief). Foo Fighters are one of the great rock bands of modern times. This doc is fun, informative, and engaging. Packed with rad interviews, fun and engaging footage, and *great* music, this doc WINS. The best part is you hear from all of the members in the band, past and present.

Watch it. You'll love it.

4495237,4,B004XCUEXY,"Really interesting DVD. Shows a lot of studio footage and work being done laying down tracks which is interesting to me. Profanity is to be expected amongst a rock band, but the F-word got old really fast with it's prevalent use.",1376265600,,229,4.609756097560975
4495238,5,B004XCUEXY,"This has a little of everything, like a FOO Fighters buffet.  Some history, good music, and surprisingly some very personal stuff about these musicians.

4495240,5,B004XCUEXY,"I loved this documentary.  Very interesting about the music business in general.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in Nirvana, Foo Fighters, or just good music.",1374364800,,171,5.296296296296297
4495241,4,B004XCUEXY,"In recent years, I've watched several of these documentaries that provide a chronological history of how some of the great bands were created.  Certainly with rock bands, the formula is pretty much the same.  Long before you've ever heard of a band, their members struggled or were successful on a local or regional level.  While musicianship is critical, chemistry between band mates is primary.  You learn that if you can't work with others, you will likely be gone.

I could have laid this doc on top of the new one about The Eagles and you wouldn't have much of a difference.  After the death of Curt Cobain came the death of Nirvana.  After several months, drummer Dave Grohl decides to move on by writing his own songs and playing a guitar.  After releasing an early FF album in which he plays all the instruments, he decides to tour, but needs a band.  First a trio then a quartet, the band goes through the requisite changes.

It is Grohl's band.  He will write the music and he will make all the decisions.  Some are fine with this, others are not.  This isn't a democracy.  Grohl, as you might expect is front and center and is very smart and very articulate.  He makes for a good story teller.  Every member is featured including those who were fired.  Some were surprised and remain bitter.  Like most documentaries of this ilk, we hear nothing of what being on the road is like.  Other than it is tiring.  No mention of the women, the sex.  The only drug reference is Taylor Hawkins well chronicled overdose in England.  We also hear nothing from the wives or family members that may have had an impact along the way.  I guess the juicy stuff only comes in the written biographies.",1373587200,,1694,4.5364238410596025

JIMMY PAGE and JOHN PAUL JONES!!!!! Dave and Taylor seemed so humbled by them being there and Dave almost lost it! WHO COULD BLAME HIM!!!!!They were playing with JIMMY PAGE!!!! And SEEING THE SHEER JOY in their faces in playing with PAGE AND JONES IS worth buying this DVD. The respect that they showed these LEGENDS was very touching. I got goose bumps.

Hearing Dave Grohl explain his thoughts and opinions of every aspect of the Foos is interesting, from the band members, to getting rid of ones who didn't fit, to writing songs, to how the songs have to match what he hears in his head, etc., lets you inside what makes the Foos awesome.",1361750400,,370,4.621212121212121

No matter how you take it, he is the Boss of the new milllenium - tough on his band, works people to max their own talents. The heart strings are pulled as we journey thru Nirvana and some of the line up changes and ups and downs of the Foos. I really enjoyed learning more about Pat Smear as well. The music is incredible ~ only wish there were more music videos at the end of the video. A little surprise visitor near the end of the video as well, put a little tear in my eye.

The Foo Fighters have been a band that I would hear on the radio, and not change the station. That's about the extent of my relationship with the band. They're a great American rock 'n roll group made up of some surprisingly interesting and down-to-earth members.

The story was so well crafted and edited, and the genuineness of Dave Grohl shone through to really make me want nothing but happiness for the guy.
The scenes of him with his daughters and wife are touching and grounding in human way, not a celebrity ""look, we're just like you regular people"" kind of way.

The music, montages, the older footage, all came together in such a way that made me really respect this film as a work of documentary excellence.
I normally don't even write many reviews, but I have been thinking about this film since I woke up this morning.

Do yourself a favor and watch it.",1359590400,,1044,4.507936507936508

4495265,5,B004XCUEXY,"I gave this DVD 5 stars based on what it was... A documentary.

Let's get this out first... If you're looking to rock out, it isn't going to happen with this DVD!

This basically is the tale of Dave Grohl from youth to present day and I must say I was surprisingly drawn in!

VERY tastefully done and showcases the talent of Grohl which I wasn't fully aware of before watching this.

Very little time spent on discussing Nirvana... I guess there's not much interest in discussing something you never made a dime for doing?

I've watched this DVD twice, will I watch it again? No... It's a documentary not a performance. I got the message second time around!

I'm certain the diehards already have this DVD... If you know little or nothing about the FF, I still think this is a great video worthy of watching just for the entertainment value if nothing else.

Personally, I'm not a fan of PBS but every now and then, they will have a program that catches my interest and I'll spend the next two hours watching... I think this is that type of video.

Enjoy...",1359158400,,1057,4.4404145077720205
4495266,5,B004XCUEXY,"I wasn't a Foo Fighters fan until I watched this documentary.  I was in High School when Nirvana was big and like many teenagers I thought I had it all figured out.  That wasn't music, it was rubbish and I remained a hardened Zeppelin fan.  But
as I got older and started teaching music in high school (including the school's Rock Band class) my students started introducing
me to some of the music I had missed out on during the 90s.  One night on Hulu this documentary popped up and so I watched it
out of curiosity.  I was hooked.  Sadly the language in here isn't exactly appropriate for a high school class, I would love to show it to my students.  Instead I can only recommend that they see it on their own.  A very eye opening look into working bands in today's music industry and a view into the genius that is Dave Grohl.",1358035200,,830,4.2756410256410255

4495272,5,B004XCUEXY,"""Back and Forth"" looks back at the career of the Foo Fighters from the last days of Nirvana to the release of the ""Wasting Light"" album.  All members of the Foo Fighters (past and present) provide commentary on the ups and downs of the band.  Dave Grohl discusses the death of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain to recording the first Foo Fighters album by himself in about 5 days and then turning down an offer to become the new drummer for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.  Grohl and the rest of the band then discuss how the rest of the band came together with various comings and goings until the band settled into a permanent line-up, which came close to disolving during the recording of the ""One by One"" album.  From that point, they take you through their rise in popularity all the way to their two sold out shows at Wembley Stadium in 2008.  The final half hour looks at the making of their ""Wasting Light"" album, which was recorded at Dave Grohl's home.  ""Wasting Light"" also marked Grohl's reunions with producer Butch Vig, who produced Nirvana's classic ""Nevermind"" album, as well as Nirvana bass player Krist Novoselic, who appears in the song ""I Should Have Known"".  The documentary ends off with an album release party at the Roxy in LA.

A must for any Foo Fighters fan.",1348963200,2,1281,4.587719298245614

4495278,4,B004XCUEXY,Foo Fighters are a great band to a great amount of people.  I liked learning a few new things in this doc that I didn't know about Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters before.  The first half of it I really enjoyed.  I started to get a bit bored when the whole Wasting Light pr0mo parts started.  I like Wasting Light.  But wouldn't consider it the landmark of their career.  Only my opinion.  Keep rockin Foo.,1338336000,3,405,4.25

4495280,5,B004XCUEXY,"You do not need to be a Foo Fighter fan to appreciate what a terrific documentary this is. It gives the complete history of the Foos from Nirvana through the recording of their amazing album Wasting Light. The way each of the band members (and ex-member) was interviewed gave the movie a real personal feel to it. Dave Grohl speaking about current and past band members and lamenting on how he regretted some of the decisions he made (replacing all of William's drum tracks on The Colour and the Shape, for example) while other decisions, though very painful (firing Franz), were what was needed to move the band forward, was extremely captivating. Make sure you watch all the way through the credits as well to get Dave's true feeling on the bands name. It's hystercial.

I only wish they had included more of the Roxy concert (Bridge Burning at the end) even as an extra would have been great.

This is a MUST own for any Foo Fighter fan",1332201600,2,939,4.550295857988166

I watched it and ordered my own copy while the credits were still rolling. Given, I am a Foo Fighters fan, so the topic and my familiarity with the songs certainly add to its appeal. But just as a documentary this was really satisfying. The interviews come across as very honest, and in the end I felt like I knew the band more intimately, and understood a bit more about what's behind their sound.",1328918400,4,537,4.173076923076923
4495285,5,B004XCUEXY,"This is a great history of the band, it really doesn't leave much out. It starts with Dave in Nirvana and his heart felt explanations about Kurt and how Foo came into being. If you love Behind the music or Band history's this is for you. The great thing about this is it doesn't follow cliches about plunging into the depths of hell then amazing self awareness not only saves the members but the band. The story does go through some hardships but mostly follows a line on how the music and the band has came together to create this wonderful thing called Foo Fighters. They are the last great rock band according to me and I am glad the exists if only to please me. This video has great insight to who Dave is and how he thinks I highly recommend this and their albums.",1328572800,6,769,4.273972602739726
4495286,5,B004XCUEXY,"To anyone who has ever been in a band, especially if you have considered it as a career option or have been on the road or in the studio, this is a must-see.  It's very easy to relate to if you've been in that boat.  Obviously, not all of us will ever sell out (let alone play) Wembley, but all of the ""growing pains"" and ups and downs that the band members describe, all of the emotions that go along with making music with friends, losing those friends over petty drama, replacing band members with guys you've never met, etc...it's easy for many of us to watch this and say ""that happened to us, too!"" throughout this whole doc.

For anyone who hasn't done the band thing, or who isn't even really a Foo Fighters fan, still give this doc a chance.  It's VERY well done, start to finish, and shows the personalities of these musicians you don't see when hearing them on the radio (providing you can find a rock radio station these days...).  Highly recommended.",1328140800,,963,4.418079096045198
4495287,5,B004XCUEXY,I never knew the story behind the Foo Fighters.  I love the way this documentary was produced.  It included interviews and history on all current and previous band members.  Loved it :),1327795200,,185,4.71875
4495288,5,B004XCUEXY,"...but I couldn't (buy local! BUY LOCAL!!) Anywho... Thanx to Amazon, I received this film 4 business days after ordering at an ok price...thanx Amazon. The film starts with background information about the band's beginnings, including the formation of Nirvana and the tragedy of the loss of Kurt Cobain. If you're a Gen X-er like myself, you'll be teary within the first 20 minutes of the film (we had a week long vigil in our building for his death while in college back in the day).. but hey this is about the Foo Fighters' right? Well the film moves along seamlessly to present day, filling in the blanks of any questions we may have had about members' past and present, personality conflicts, and difficult decisions made on behalf of the bands survival. The idea that most of the band's best albums have been recorded in Garages, Basements, within 5 days etc...just feeds fodder to their ""Rock God"" status... and here's the thing..these guys don't even identify as Rock Stars, but as musicians who are grateful to be working and doing what they love...it really makes me love them all the more. Also, if like me, and you get a woody from reminiscing on your H.S. Punk days, the narrative will take you back to DC's scene as well as others.
What I found most intriguing about the film itself (editing, lighting, direction, narrative) is its ability to attract an audience outside of their fans. There is a human component to the narrative that will allow anyone watching to see reflections of themselves within the context of some of the challenges documented. I turned this film on last night with the expectation of no one else watching it with me. My partner listens to Jazz and Blues and the family mostly hip hop. By the end of the film there were 9 people in the living room who had not heard their music(unless they heard it in my car at some point or another etc) who expressed how much they loved the film. I also think both Dave and Pat are transparent and warm enough to 'draw people in'. Nate reminds me of your heady/conspiracy theorist friend that can get too uptight if left to his own devices. Chris seems like the type of guy you'd wanna take a punch from at least one, just to see if you could handle it! LOL

Lastly, as a social worker/researcher, I have to add that the Taylor Hawkins interview was inspiring...and I hope other young guys who are searching for ways to cope and survive listen to his take on how he's evolved as a person. My nephews are going thru my collections of Foo now and making mixed disc (like as we speak). I've heard ""Oh I know THIS song. This is Foo Fighters?"" about 4 times this hour.

A coworker told me about this documentary; he said he saw it on VH1.  So immediately I looked it up on Amazon and bought it.  When it arrived in less than a week, I was super pumped and couldn't wait for my boyfriend to open it so we could watch it.  He loved it and said it was one of his favorite Christmas gifts.

Great footage and candid interviews with past and present members. I would recommend this to old and new fans and to people that have never listened to Foo Fighters. These guys are such talented musicians....and the show in Charlotte, NC on
November 8, 2011 blew everyone away!!!!",1323302400,,410,4.871428571428571
4495303,5,B004XCUEXY,"Funny, dealing with the general public (which yes, I know I am part of), loved this documentary. Must recommend. I am a late Foo Fighters fan, but can fully appreciate the effort/history. One of my favorites (ok, plus now Pat Smear).",1321660800,,233,4.7073170731707314

4495305,5,B004XCUEXY,"Back and Forth is an incredible documentary that gives an honest and rare peak backstage at the history of Foo Fighters.  A must for any fan as well as a wealth of information on how to make fantastic records.  I watched it with my sisters (who were born after the death of Kurt Cobain) and they were fascinated to discover that MTV actually used to play music instead of reality TV.  Highly, highly, highly recommend this film!",1319500800,,428,4.532467532467533
4495306,5,B004XCUEXY,"I may be partial because the Foo Fighters is easily my favorite band, but this documentary is a must-see for all fans of Rock and anyone who aspires to be a musician. And with all of the concert footage featured throughout the movie, you will not want to hit pause.",1319414400,,265,4.32
4495307,5,B004XCUEXY,"Wow -- what a compelling and fun documentary! Back and Forth starts with the early career of Foo Fighters' founder Dave Grohl, including personal revelations and commentary about the death of Kurt Cobain by Grohl and others (like Nevermind producer Butch Vig). After the end of Nirvana Grohl took eight months off then recorded songs he'd written over the past few years; liking what he heard, he asked the rhythm section of recently-demised Sunny Day Real Estate to join him, and FF was off the ground. The retrospective continues chronologically through lineup changes and albums and lineup changes and tours and drama and lineup changes, with candid commentary from each of the band members (current and former) and lots of great concert footage, home videos, funny music videos and fascinating behind-the-scenes extras. The film finishes with the delightful process of recording the group's latest release, 2011's Wasting Light, which took place at Grohl's home with the band members' families around, produced by Butch Vig and with input from Husker Du's Bob Mould and ex-Nirvana bandmate Krist Novoselic playing on ""I Should Have Known"", a haunting tearjerker that addresses Grohl's feelings about Cobain these many years later. The final scene shows a live performance of ""Burning Bridges"" while each band member acknowledges how lucky they are. Which is a nice change from the angsty, drug-addled hedonism we so often get from entertainment folk. Like Metallica's Some Kind of Monster, you want to watch this again right away, and find yourself loving the band even more.

I especially liked the footage of Grohl giving in to his daughter's pleas to go swimming; we see them in the pool while Mould and Vig work on a track in Dave's garage. It emphasizes the difference between Cobain and Grohl -- one who shone bright and flamed out, and one who has persevered and grown -- maturing into a fine musician with a great group around him. I've always liked FF but come away from this film with an even deeper admiration for them.

While the concert footage was great fun, what I truly adored was seeing the process -- the writing, the practicing, the backstage jokes. Extra features are also a blast: pre-production of ""These Days""; MMM-MMM (with possible KFC revenue to follow!); ""On the Mend"" with its revelation that Grohl is a typical guy; Dave Struggles with Recording; the wonderful glimpse of duo drumming in ""Bridge Burning"" Rhythm Plan; Krist Novoselic on Accordion(!); the hysterical Taylor's Cymbals; Mixing (including the car test); and an Alternate Ending.

You know in a lot of ways getting older stinks, but the good part is that I have a great catalogue of music experiences. It was pretty awesome to be a little kid when Beatles albums were coming out, and at university when Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon and Led Zepellin's Physical Graffiti arrived. I get the same feeling here -- that this is an amazing group, and with ""Wasting Light"" we are seeing the arrival of a classic, fittingly bringing some closure to Grohl's history with Nirvana.

I rented this on Netflix and am going to buy it because I liked it so much. Awesome! Highest recommendation.",1317686400,24,3180,4.960600375234522

4495309,5,B004XCUEXY,"If you are a fan of Foo, rock, grunge, alternative, music, you must buy this. Very very cool. Totally worth my money. Bluray is superb.",1317340800,,135,4.44
4495310,5,B004XCUEXY,"If you're a Foo Figthers fan then this DVD is well worth the money.  It's not some drama filled, drug fueled documentary, but more an intimate picture of how the band started and more importantly the things needed to keep the band together for all these years.  What was intriguing about the whole movie was how humble the band is about it's success and knowing that it could all end tomorrow.  I believe it runs about 1 hour and 37 minutes of which there is no fluff, it's about the band the whole time.",1317254400,,504,4.340425531914893
4495311,5,B004XCUEXY,"Dave Grohl really puts his heart and soul into everything he does. If you didn't know that prior to going into Foo Fighters Back and Forth documentary you will be sure of it after viewing it. And this video is really The History of Dave Grohl as much as it is about the Foo Fighters.

The DVD starts with a young Grohl joining Nirvana and reveals a lot of inside story about the dynamic of that band and its tragic end. Then the real fun starts as Dave lays it all out there from getting the Foo Fighters together through getting the first album out through the many intricacies and trials and tribulations of the band to the current day and the release of Wasting Light.

Let me tell you, friends and neighbors...this video affected me. I don't know if it affected me so much because&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wasting-Light/dp/B004LUHQ1G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wasting Light</a>&nbsp;also so affected me, or if it's that I'll be seeing the Foo's for my first time next month, or perhaps I just related to a lot of the experiences as a musician myself (failed musician but musician nonetheless!). But this video affected me. I rocked. I laughed. I rocked. I got disappointed. I rocked. I even got friggin emotional at one point! And I'm no Foo Fighters fan boy; I've been critical of the group for putting out records that have a few great songs and a lot of forgettable songs. However the band really turned that corner for me with Wasting Light, which has track after track of great songs.

Foo Fighters Back and Forth is a must for Foo Fighters fans, but maybe even more so for anyone who's ever wanted to know how to make a good band and then make that good band persevere through it all to greatness.

Side note: The DVD does NOT include the live studio performance of the entire Wasting Light album that was shown in theaters along side the Back and Forth documentary. That's kind of a bummer, because it is an excellent little show and an intimate look at the band playing the album together. Fortunately the Foo Fighters have the Wasting Light live performance posted on YouTube...in HD! For convenience I've provided the link as the first comment to this review.",1316995200,3,2224,4.81413612565445
4495312,5,B004XCUEXY,"Great documentary for any Foo Fighters fan.  Definately worth purchasing.  It gives great detail about the history of the band and it's formation, along with a great look inside the recording of Wasting Light.",1316995200,,209,5.117647058823529
4495313,5,B004XCUEXY,If you like David Grohl and the Foo Fighters you will enjoy this similar to VH1 Behind the Scenes documentary. It takes you from Post Nirvana up to the recording of present Day Wasting Light. I really enjoyed the whole thing. Very well done.,1314748800,,241,4.5

4495315,5,B004XCUEXY,This Doc is awesome. I love how it delves into Nirvana among other things. It's so well done. I already watched it one and a half times and for a documentary thats impressive. You can actually watch this over and over again with time. It's really interesting to see the band evolve over the years. I mean whoever thought this band would have all these albums and sell out arenas let alone stadiums. I mean Dave was the drummer for Nirvana and look how far he took his band the Foo Fighters to. You really have to give him credit and it really shows Kurt wasn't the only true talent for Nirvana.,1314316800,2,594,4.3125
4495316,4,B004XCUEXY,"They say every autobiography that is written is at least slightly self serving to the author.  Now it seems that in film it is no different.  As a Foo Fighters fan I was happy to get an in depth look at the band from the beginning, and it was great to see interviews with all the current members along with many of their previous band mates.  The guys are all pretty funny not just Grohl and they are very candid as well which is nice.

To me the problem is that I don't think there was much of a story to tell.  As a band they never had to overcome huge obstacles, they were popular from the beginning, and at one point all they can complain about is just their lack of motivation.  Not that there weren't a few rough patches especially with the drummers but much of the drama seems inconsequential.  This movie is basically just hype for the release of Wasting Light their latest album.(which is great by the way)

Where this movie excels in its music selection.  There's understandably many Foo Fighter classics but also music from a surprising amount of other bands.  I like any movie with some Fugazi in the soundtrack.  Honestly this is an enjoyable and informative movie that's easily worth watching at least once.",1313798400,,1221,4.479638009049774
4495317,5,B004XCUEXY,"I am a bit biased in writing this review as I am a Foo fanatic, but if you are looking to purchase it, you must be too. I saw this movie when it was premiered in Austin at South by Southwest and was blown away. It is a very honest documentary that details the ups and downs of this terrific band, bringing back old members for interviews, discussing the changes Dave Grohl went through going from Nirvana to starting up the Foo, and (my favorite) talking about the heart and effort that they put into their newest album, Wasting Light. The blu-ray is fantastic with crisp sound and a terrific picture. If you are a fan of the Foo Fighters, you will absolutely enjoy this great movie!",1312675200,,683,4.3858267716535435

The DVD goes through all the band member changes the Foos had over the years. Great insight into the history of the FF. It also talks about Dave's time in Nirvana and the death of Curt Kobain, and the other bands he and the band members were in and much more. Nicely done, interesting, funny and light hearted at times, and heavy at times...Really great DVD that I would recommend to anyone who likes rock music, and of course, if you're a big Foos fan like me, it's a MUST have.",1310774400,,602,4.067226890756302

Very entertaining, and learned so much about how talented and smart Dave Grohl is, but also what a great person he is, too.  I loved when he was playing the guitar for the recordings they did at his home, and his little daughter is tapping on his shoulder to get his attention, and he just laughs about it, and keeps on playing.  Then when he's done he goes out to the pool and swims with his daughter, he really seems to be down to earth.",1310083200,,645,4.227642276422764

I found it to be very insightful into Dave Grohls background with Nirvana and with the Foo Fighters. I also watched it commercial free on VH-1 when it first aired and have it saved to my dvr and watch it when ever there is nothing else on or I need a foo infusion. I am looking forward to their tour and seeing them live in the near future.  Thank you for this I love it",1309132800,2,496,3.843137254901961
4495323,3,B004XCUEXY,"First, let me say that the Foo Fighters ARE the greatest band in the world.  I've followed them from the beginning, I own every CD they've ever releasd and I saw this documentary on VH1 the night it premiered.  It only left me wanting more and couldn't wait until it was released on DVD.  The day I saw it listed, I purchased it.  The DVD was in my player within 5 minutes of its delivery.  I scanned the back of the DVD and the listed running time was 140 minutes, which meant I could expect at least another 30 or 40 minutes of material not shown in the VH1 version.  The further I got into the movie, the more I had a sneaking suspicion that I was watching exactly the same thing as I watched on VH1, minus commercials and explanatives.  It ran exactly 100 minutes.  I immediately looked at the product description page and it also stated a running time of 140 mins.  I made a complaint and without any hassle what so ever, received a replacement.  Like deja vu, I ran to my DVD player, stuck it in and...once again...100 mins.  I'm extremely disappointed.  The ""Bonus Material is OK but there really isn't anything to see that you haven't seen in the VH1 version.  I gave this movie three stars because it is a great documentary about a great rock band, but the decieving running time and lack of additional material kept me from giving it 4 or 5 stars.  I'm glad I can add it to my Foo Fighter collection but if, like me, you recorded the VH1 version on your DVR, there really isn't anything else to see. This obvious error should be corrected immediately because it is deceiving.  Bottom line:  1:40 does not equal 140 minutes, it only equals 100.",1308787200,19,1653,4.370491803278688
4495324,5,B004XCUEXY,"I caught the end of the VH-1 special and then found it online and proceeded to watch it over & over & over. When the DVD came out, I knew I had to have it and what a great buy it was. It's nice to see amazing musicians in their ""element"" but yet are normal guys. So many musicians turn in to jerks with huge inflated egos but not these guys. Also, Dave was smart by keeping footage from the beginning because before this documentary, I only knew bits and pieces of the Foo Fighters and how they got where they are today. I also LOVED the extra footage, particularly ""Taylor's Cymbals"" and I'll say no more other than I thought I would pi** myself from laughing so hard. This documentary is truly a gem and I will never get bored watching it over and over.",1308787200,2,755,4.178082191780822

I'm comfortable saying that even people who aren't fans of their music will still love this video... it's humorous, emotional, captivating, and uplifting... and best of all it's a true story! It really allows you to have an intimate connection with Foo... I feel like I grew up with them now! I suggest checking it out.. now!",1308182400,2,617,4.327586206896552

I loved watching interviews from all past and present band members, it really shows that it's not just the""Dave Grohl Band""(which was actually the case on the first album). I love that the last part of this was the making of Wasting Light, I believe that is some of their best work. I'm just wondering if the disc includes the concert that was shown in movie theaters along with the documentary. Either way, everyone should see this.

The band is so tight and ""Wasted Light"" is amazing. What's even more amazing is ""Back And Forth"". A seemingly quiet history...no tales told...well here it is! I was amazed what Dave has been through in 16 years! That just since his release of the debut album done by Dave on his own! A genius of the 21st Century. Hell a genius period! The story behind Dave branching his demos into a full fledged band did not come without some major speed bumps. Firing band members for the greater good. Member(s) leaving, then coming back to the fold. Bring all up to date to the incredible band that Foo Fighter's are today: Taylor, Chris, Nate, Pat & Dave.

At first I thought it might be a put-on because the drummer that lasted, I think, one album before being replaced talked about getting ""the phone call"". Its a testament to Grohl that he was able to get everyone into a studio to talk honestly about their experiences. A lot of great information in this!

 After the documentary, the Foo Fighters played the entire album, Wasting Light, in a studio somewhere and it was great. It should be included with this to recreate the entire experience. Hopefully it will someday...",1304121600,5,581,4.686274509803922
