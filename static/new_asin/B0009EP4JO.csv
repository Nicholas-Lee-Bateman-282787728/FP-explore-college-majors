8059467,5,B0009EP4JO,"I love the Muppet Show.  Even nearly fifty years after the first episodes appeared on television, the humor and sense of fun that went into the creation of this show shines through.

My only frustration has been in finding all the episodes.  Seasons 1 through 3 are on DVD, but not the final 2 seasons.  Some of these episodes show up on a series of DVD's produced by TimeLine, each DVD has 3 episodes, introduced by Brian Henson.  This DVD is one of those, and the selection was excellent.

The first episode is actually the last one shown.  The Muppet go on a ride with then James Bond actor Roger Moore.  He fights off the advances of Miss Piggy.  Steps in a pie, and finally entertains with a hilarous intrpretation of ""If I Could Talk to the Animals"" from the old musical Doctor Dolittle.  Add in some viking pigs singing ""In the Navy"", and you have one of my favorite episodes.  Great fun.

Edgar Bergen's episode is the second one.  Brian Henson notes that this was a special moment for the puppeteers as Edgar and his dummies were legendary in entertainment circles by this time.  Edgar clearly has fun interacting with the Muppets and the jokes fly fast and furious.

Danny Kaye gets the last spot on the DVD.  Unfortunately they don't get to play up his ability to sing complex lyrics at a high speed.  He does end up being one of the few actors to do a scene with the Swedish Chef as he pairs with him to cook a turkey.

In my mind you can never go wrong with episodes of The Muppet Show.  It's good fun for both kids and adults.  If you can find this, or any other episodes, you should definitely try to add them to your collection.",1329350400,2,1644,4.345394736842105

A born Entertainer, long may his Films be loved & appreciated by everyone who loves this very talented & gifted man.",1267660800,,266,4.5625
