8494539,1,B00682LSPA,"I am so bummed we chose this as our fun movie night movie. The graphics, the singing the EVERYTHING was terrible. Good thing I had a free rental but still was a waste of time :( I wish I would have come here before renting!",1339113600,,223,3.977777777777778
8494540,1,B00682LSPA,Horrible! Absolute waste of time and money! Even my 6 year old thought it was a horrible movie.  I really wish I could get my money back,1337299200,,136,4.037037037037037

8494542,1,B00682LSPA,"I wish I had seen the reviews on this movie before I was sucked in to renting it. Not only are the graphics awful, but the sound is terrible and I am still unsure what the point of the movie was. I would like a refund of my time and money. Worst movie ever.",1333584000,,257,3.7777777777777777
8494543,1,B00682LSPA,"This movie is horrible, in every aspect. Like the others, I got roped into renting it from a Redbox machine by my 4-year-old son. I wanted to rent the new Muppets, he wanted some movie that looked like a low budget version of Shark Tale. Both movies were out of stock so I ended up with this straight-to-dvd gem. It's a bad enough sign that I've never even heard of this movie, but to come on here and find out Tom Arnold voiced it? That's your cue to hide it, tell the kids it got lost and return it to the Redbox after you drop them off at school in the morning.",1332633600,,564,4.044642857142857
8494544,1,B00682LSPA,"The kids (5 & 8) sat through this animated film, but gave it two thumbs down!  Not creative nor enjoyable!",1330732800,,106,4.3
8494545,1,B00682LSPA,"I let my 4 year old daughter select this from red box without knowing anything about it or ever having heard of it. BIG MISTAKE. This has to be the worst kids movie I have ever seen by a mile. I wish I had read the previous review beforehand. Every aspect of this film from start to finish, including characters, story, animation, to name a few, is so mind blowingly bad it is really unbelievable. I hope no one has to suffer through this piece of trash like my kids and I did. Whoa!",1330473600,,483,4.148936170212766
8494546,1,B00682LSPA,Unfortunately this pick was not even worth the $1.20 we paid at redbox to rent it. Run don't walk the other direction before renting this one. Graphics & voices are horrible.,1330473600,,174,4.645161290322581
