2120951,5,B0002V7OJM,"Do not watch this show if you have a weak stomach!  There are numerous instances where the Wildboyz engage in antics featuring animal feces!  They both get hurt quite often, but never very badly.  The worst injury actually happens to their cameraman who is scratched by a Cheetah (and he needed 7 stitches).  That being said, this show is hilarious!  It is easily funnier than most programming out there on TV, and it does in fact have a respect for nature.  If nothing else, you'll realize that there's a reason these species have survived for so long.

One thing that is also great about this set is that the episodes are consistantly good.  i can't say that there is one ""best"" in the set, simply because they are all so strong.  There is virtually no stunt repetition (unless you count the ""black mamba"" which is just goofy).  Also worth checking out is the interaction the Wildboyz have with native peoples.  Be they Zulu or Eskimo, Steve-O and Chris put on a show for the people.

The DVD has a good load of extras, with easter eggs that are actually worth finding.  The extras inlcude some funny deleted bits, some funny outtakes and a surprisingly strong making-of video (along with other obligatory extras).  A great plus to such a unique show.

It is such a strange show in that on the one hand they can do very disgusting and stupid things, but at the same time have a respect for nature.  Animals are stupid, but so are humans.  These guys push the limits and risk their lives.  As Chris says in the first episode, ""Its a jungle out there, and we're Tarzan.""",1099267200,16,1570,4.526690391459074
2120952,5,B0002V7OJM,"Wildboyz is the cure for the common nature show!  This is them most clever show I have seen in a long time.  you can see stupidity at its best and learn about nature at the same time, oh yea!",1099180800,3,191,3.871794871794872
2120953,5,B0002V7OJM,"Plotwise ""Wildboyz"" has nothing to do the William Burroughs classic of the same name.  But if I told you about a TV show where two brainless boys smoke peyote with natives, run naked in the wild with zebras and wildebeests and help baboons pleasure themselves, well it's as if Mr. Burroughs was busily typing up the action himself.  A+",1099094400,3,335,4.661016949152542
2120954,4,B0002V7OJM,"Strange, dangerous, painful, a little scary and flat-out fall-down hilarious.  When I saw that Steve-o and Pontius had wandered from the wreckage of ""Jackass"" into a interactive nature show, I didn't have very high expectations.

But then again, here's the basic plotline: Two very funny dudes travel the globe tracking down exotic animals to get bitten by.

One of the things I always loved about ""Jackass"" was that the guys were basically nice and goodnatured, they were having a lot of fun and not really hurting anybody except themselves. That dare-I-call-it sweetness (which is sorely lacking in smug nihilism of ""Viva La Bam"") carries over to the Wildboyz.  They may occasionally play a little rough with Mother Nature's other creatures, but they honestly seem interested in the animals and concerned (even when they're injecting homoerotic undertones into natural processes).

The other thing I always loved about ""Jackass"" was that it seemed to be about saying ""Ferk you"" to fears.  The guys knew they were probably going to get hurt, but they also knew that they weren't going to get SERIOUSLY hurt.  So they just said to hell with it and usually took the plunge.  Again, Steve-O and Chris channel that into this new show -- they encounter creatures that most of us would be loathe to touch... and then they drop them down their pants. You have to respect true bravery when you encounter it in that form and, anyway, the scene in which Steve-O can't get the giant crab off his butt is one of the funniest things I've ever seen.

How long can they keep this up?  I dunno.  Let's find out.",1098835200,5,1596,4.788321167883212
2120955,5,B0002V7OJM,"Imagine The Crocodile Hunter mixed with the antics of Jackass and you have a pretty good idea of what Wildboyz is all about. After the demise of Jackass, Steve-O and Chris Pontius did some soul-searching and decided to become ""research scientists."" To this end, they now travel the globe ""studying"" wild animals in their natural habitats and experience the local customs and practices indigenous to that area. What does this all mean? Plenty of Jackass-style gross-outs, captured in eight episodes on this solid 2-DVD set.

Wildboyz is a sly spoof of those old Mutual of Omaha Wild Kingdom shows with Marlon Perkins. As if to further reinforce the ridiculousness of these kinds of shows, there is even a faux British narrator who establishes every segment. Each episode is set in a specific area of the world (Alaska, Belize, Australia) and features Chris and Steve-O ""studying"" an animal or insect (or snake) and then getting bitten, clawed or otherwise maimed. They never hurt the animals. Nine times out of ten it is they who are hurt by said creature. Along for the ride on most shows is animal expert, Manny Puig, a wild-haired, scruffy looking dude who doesn't look like he'd be an expert of anything but seems to keep the boys out of trouble and offers the occasional bit of sage advice. Johnny Knoxville even makes an appearance in an episode set in Florida and fakes a fatal snake bite as a practical joke on Steve-O.

What makes the show work so well is the personalities of Chris and Steve-O and the dynamic between them. Chris is the braver of the two (in one episode, he sneaks up on a jaguar) while Steve-O is the scaredy-cat (and is often the first to run at the sign of any kind of danger). They make a great team and seem to be genuinely having fun and impart a love for animals.

Each episode features an audio commentary by Chris, Steve-O, series' director Jeff Tremaine and executive producer, Dimitry Elyashkevich. These are funny tracks as everyone jokes and makes fun of Steve-O for being such a coward. These are wonderfully chaotic and entertaining tracks-a must-listen for any fan of the show.

""The Making of Wildboyz"" is a playful and irreverent look at the show with interviews with Steve-O, Chris, Manny and Jeff Tremaine. Chris and Steve-O talk about their experiences with clips of some of their most memorable moments on the show.

Also included is ""Bonus Footage"" from all the episodes, including lots of blown lines to introductions for various segments.

There is a snazzy ""Photo Gallery"" that features pics from all the episodes with captions. Nice touch!

There are two music videos for Turbonegro, who do the show's theme song (sadly, none of them are for that song).

There are biographies and interviews with Steve-O and Chris (anyone who quotes Led Zeppelin is okay in my books).

""Bite List"" is a comprehensive list of bites that Chris and Steve-O have taken from various animals in the first season. Chris edges out Steve-O 18 to 17.

""Wildboyz Encyclopedia"" supports my lame theory that Wildboyz is also an educational show. This extra gives you the low-down on an animal from each one of the episodes and a clip from said show. For example, one can learn about the giant squid from New Zealand.

Finally, there are outtakes from all the episodes, including Chris mixing it up with a ""mean"" camel. There is a very impressive amount of extra footage not seen on the show.

Tired of the wholesome family fun of Steve Irwin? Sick of Jeff Corwin's earnest shtick? Then, look no further. The Wildboyz is the gonzo nature show for you. There's plenty of macho action with men throwing up, running way from wild animals and bitten by nasty insects. The show is all in good fun and really should be viewed that way. This is 2-DVD set is crammed with extras (more than I expected) that fans of the show will spend hours enjoying.",1098748800,17,3865,4.7351190476190474

2121044,4,B0002V7OJM,By far the best season in the series.  At this point the show was still fresh and Steve-O and Chris Pontius were really trying to make it work rather than just phoning it in like they did in seasons 3+4.  The show is actually somewhat educational believe it or not.  You won't be able to go on Jeopardy after viewing this but you will be able to at least know what someone is talking about when they bring up some obscure animal because you'll remember Chris gettin bittin on the butt by it.  It really is funny stuff check it out.,1255996800,,531,4.227722772277228
2121045,5,B0002V7OJM,"I love this show. It is truly a nature program, of course its a nature program with Steve-O and Party Boy (Chris Pontius)!

Wildboyz isn't stupid stunts, its stupids in the wild. I've learned alot by watching this show and I've seen places and things on Wildboyz, that I have never seen anywhere else! The show also features Manny Puig and he is a legend!

2121072,5,B0002V7OJM,"This show is fun to watch and can even teach a few things about nature.  This show is not over the top like Jackass and Viva la Bam, but it is crazy, because you don't really know what's going to happen when you jump in the water with a Great White Shark.  The animals don't act or play to the camera which is what makes it somewhat educating.  You learn that even some of the nicest animals can still hurt you, and that some of the most vicious animals are not always so dangerous.  I'm not saying to watch this because you will learn something, I just say watch it because it's funny and you don't know how the animals will react to what's happening; therefore teaching you at the same time what you shouldn't do around certain animals, even though you probably will never come into contact with most of the animals on the show.  So watch and learn.",1122422400,5,851,4.29375

ALL FOR $20 FREAKIN DOLLARS!  Finally a show jumps into the Nature TV world and teaches us something while making us laugh our asses off!

2121075,5,B0002V7OJM,"If you like the show, you will love the DVD.  The language is uncensored, but there isn't so much swearing that it is distracting.  Two of the oddest guys, but both very funny in their own ways.  They compliment each other well.  It is quite educational despite some of their questionable antics.  Some great footage.

Only complaint is that you can't go directly to the Disc Menu on CD 1, you have to fast forward through some advertisements which can be a little annoying.

Filmed on location all over the wilds of the world, you have these two hilarious ""Dudes""--Chris Pontius and Steve-O--guiding us through the mysteries of Mother Nature. These episodes are so off-the-wall that you never know what to expect. This duo come off as surprisingly likeable because they don't try to preen or strut their stuff like professional actors or nature lovers. They're just plain ole Chris and Steve-O, formerly of ""Jackass"" and they come across as party guys you'd love to have swigging some beer at your own happening. What surprises the viewer is how close to real danger our guys put themselves in to prove a point. I had to close my eyes when Chris let himself be chomped on by a boa constrictor--and then he laughs about it! Then there's Steve O demonstrating how a porcupine's quills can be pretty painful indeed--especially when he deliberately sits down, naked butt and all, on a real live creature and you watch the quills being tugged from his skin. Anyway, if you like the Marx Brothers, you should hvae no trouble sitting through this zany, nutsy and entertaining foray into the wilds of the world.",1100217600,7,1227,4.875598086124402
