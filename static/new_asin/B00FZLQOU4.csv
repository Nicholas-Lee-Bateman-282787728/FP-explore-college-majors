8619752,5,B00FZLQOU4,"A review of every race in the 2013 season, and includes a in-car hot lap at every track as a bonus!
They even dug a little deeper with the Multi 2-1 debacle at Malaysia that year!

8619757,5,B00FZLQOU4,"If you are a fan of F1, there is no other option.  This is a great recap of a mostly Vettle dominant 2013 season.  Well worth the watch.",1408233600,,136,3.8214285714285716

8619759,4,B00FZLQOU4,"I have not been interested in F1 until recently but have kind of gone ""all in."" This DVD compresses the 2013 season into 3.5 hours and is very interesting. The after race ""podium"" antics and interviews are a bit redundant -- they all do and say about the same things -- but the racing is very good. It also highlights the fact that F1 rules changed at the end of 2013 and turned the racing sport a little sideways: those that were on the top are now struggling; those that were not showing well are now almost unbeatable. And it does spotlight Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel's amazing winning streak and World Championship.",1401148800,,622,4.513274336283186
8619760,5,B00FZLQOU4,"Great behind the wheel footage (laps around each track are selectable from the menu), crisp Blu-Ray video and an engaging look at the season from the competitive perspectives of the teams and drivers. The shots from above the cockpit include graphic bars for the position of the throttle, braking indicator, track speed and engine RPMs - which offers insight into the demanding driving techniques required by this hi-tech sport.  Fortunately this Blu-Ray is shot in widescreen (not 4:3 as indicated by Amazon, that would have been a let down).",1400544000,2,543,5.101123595505618
