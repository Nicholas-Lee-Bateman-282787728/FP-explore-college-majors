8661218,1,B00KT1R2PG,"Get your science from scientists... Jeffrey Smith was trained at a yogi school (literally... You can find pics of him online supposedly levitating)
Jeffrey Smith; not a scientist (and zero scientific background) compiled this based on ""science?"" Nope. Turns out the vast majority of his career has been as a conspiracy theorist... just wiki/google the guys background.. he's a hoax!
This vid is full of poorly done studies (most of them rejected by highly regarded journals) and the few legit studies have since been found to be complete frauds.. and that makes this video useless.
If you want actual science, look at the metadata.. turns out the vast majority (of both studies and scientists) show exactly the opposite of what this info does.
Bottom line: if you want real science, don't buy or watch or read media written by non-scientists. (especially  those who went to yogi school)
Jeffrey is a hoax/conspiracy theorist.. if you want to actually read science compiled by scientists, go quick look up Neil Degrasses' youtube videos, or Bill Nyes, or any other actual trained scientist... they will tell you to trust scientists to evaluate science, not yogis!! Thanks, science!",1504915200,,1180,5.1139896373057
