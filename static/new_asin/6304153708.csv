792628,4,6304153708,"I remember that when I first saw this episode, I had mixed feelings. Looking back on it and having not been such a big horror fan then, I realize now that this is a great episode of GOOSEBUMPS. I agree with another viewer in saying that this is quite creepy and might send chills up even adults spines, and if that can happen, the children will be ferociously scared with this one. There are only about 3 episodes of GOOSEBUMPS that can generate chills and thrills like movies such as HALLOWEEN and THE EXORCIST, and this is one of them. The dad is quite the odd-ball and I felt sorry for the kids for ever having him as a father. Interesting, suspenseful and creepy.",1074124800,,667,4.387096774193548

7862861,4,6304153708,"When I saw this movie I was shocked of how creepy it was. I'd have to say the creepest part was when the girls sneaks into the bathroom and sees her Dad cut open his skin and green blood came out, plant blood, then he makes his kids eat it! So this movie taught me a lesson... not to touch, look at, or go near a plant. YOU HAVE YO SEE THIS FILM!!!",1172275200,,348,3.780821917808219
