2568132,2,B000FII2Z2,"Good to watch on a lazy summer afternoon, a bit on the dull side, the police women seem to be the only ones with a pulse.  If folks living in the British suburbs are as self-cenetered as portrayed, I say let them kill each other and clean out the gene pool.",1171843200,5,257,4.03921568627451
2568133,5,B000FII2Z2,"became a fan of this series on tv watching english detectives these two woman take it to another level with wit and charm along with there beauty

2568134,4,B000FII2Z2,"Detective Inspector Kate ""Ash"" Ashurst and Detective Sergeant Emma ""Scribs"" Scribbins are a homicide team operating in Middleford, a suburb of London.  The murders they usually investigate involve sex and lots of money, with the occasional dive into revenge and jealousy.  The six-episode first season is an absolute delight to watch, providing a murder, suspects, and a trail of tricky clues to keep armchair detectives guessing throughout.

Caroline Catz (NEW STREET LAW) plays Ash and Lisa Faulkner (SPOOKS, MI-5) plays Scribs.  Both women are veterans of BBC detective and drama series, and their experience shows in their sleek handling of their roles.  When you first see them on screen, you immediately buy into their characters.

Created by Nick Collins, the series is as much about the two women as it is the murders they solve.  Ash and Scribs lament over the lack of good men left in the world, and the fact that cops don't usually fare well in relationships.  Scribs is the more laidback, rule-ignoring one of the pair, while Ash is more image conscious and seems to have rules for everything.

The two characters and actresses are delightful to watch.  During the first three episodes they grow and become more comfortable.  By the time the fourth episode rolls around, I felt like they were old friends settling in to tell me of their further exploits.

The plots are intriguing and plotted well enough, though without the usual forensic evidence that most series seem to require these days.  But it's the characters, the twists and turns of their private lives, thoughts, and interactions, that truly draw an audience in.

My wife and I love the BBC detective series.  We've bought several sets (and really recommend FOYLE'S WAR in addition to these) and enjoy a good game of armchair detecting throughout the episodes.  If you like fun characters and a mystery plot meaty enough to sink your teeth into, MURDER IN SUBURBIA is a great series to buy or rent.",1168128000,39,1972,4.930303030303031
2568135,1,B000FII2Z2,"I did not enjoy this. If you like 'Hercule Poirot', 'Miss Marple', 'Morse', 'Frost' or even 'Jonathan Creek', ...  - then you won't like this shallow series. Maybe I am too old for this - but two goodlooking women are not quite enough to make a good mystery ...",1167782400,13,261,4.326530612244898

2568137,5,B000FII2Z2,"In this day and age of dark mysteries full of serial killers and lead characters brooding over their sad lives, this series is a delight!  The plots are basic murder mysteries with clever but not unexpected outcomes.  But the two leading ladies with their witty dialogue and very human personalities are just too much fun to watch.  This is for those mystery lovers who need a light hearted break from the norm!",1158883200,21,411,4.680555555555555
2568138,5,B000FII2Z2,"I watch a lot of mysteries and this series doesn't necessarily stand out based on it's plotlines...they're good, but the great lead characters and dialogue are what make this series worth watching. Ash and Scribbs have some truly hilarious (and memorable) moments. I recommend the first season, and I'm definitely looking foward to future seasons.",1157760000,31,347,5.327272727272727

2568160,4,B000FII2Z2,"I loved Season 1 of this show.  I like the sly punchlines and the camaraderie between the two female stars (and their boss is good eye candy!).  I was looking forward to Season 2, but the closed captioning (which I need) is out of kilter, making it very difficult to watch. :-(",1496707200,,277,4.3076923076923075
2568161,3,B000FII2Z2,"Some how it seems that the proportions are wrong or off some how. Like those people who have the picture on their mind boggling widescreen TV all stretched wide and everyone looks fat.

2568162,3,B000FII2Z2,"Really great idea of two snazzy women detectives ruined by 1950's stuff about women. Only could last two seasons as a result not many
like Lewis and MidSommer Murders. A real tragedy. Now that feminism is back in style, this series could be restarted with these two great actors, a better boss,  with women writers and directors who would know how to really make a go of it. The writing doesn't need to focus on their issues as women, per se but just have them as super detectives getting the collars with great intelligence.",1489449600,,525,4.585106382978723

2568288,3,B000FII2Z2,"Cute British detective series. Hubs and I enjoyed it, not as much as Midsomer Murders or Foyle's War, but definitely more than most American detective shows. But if you depend on closed captioning as we do to understand the British accents, be aware than Series 2's CC is out of sync with the video. Very distracting. Would have been a 4 star review if not for the CC snafu.",1475366400,,374,4.434782608695652

2568322,4,B000FII2Z2,"The mysteries are light fare, with likeable detectives. In fact, they are quite competent detectives with personal quirks that both help and hinder them. I can watch this without fear of grossly excessive violence, or resolution by bullet. That makes it safe for family viewing, for the most part. I compare it to Midsommer in tone, though not as fanciful in the plotting. Still, Suburbia comes off like its title, a little too nice, and not quite gritty enough.",1473638400,2,462,4.860759493670886

I love UK mysteries, I could name a million here but there is no point. I was excited when I saw this particular mystery as it has Caroline Catz from Doc Martin as a detective and I wanted to see how she would do in a mystery. Caroline and her co-star Lisa Faulkner are brilliant! I think they work wonderful together, they are funny and serious and just get the job done!

Even though I have about a million (just kidding) Brit coms and Mysteries on dvd, I love nothing more than to find more. Keep making shows like this and let them run forever like ""Last of the Summer Wine"" and ""Midsomer Murders"" :-)",1468281600,3,738,4.23404255319149
2568365,3,B000FII2Z2,"I agree with the reviewers who said in essence that the show was not bad, but it was not that good. I recognize that I am in the minority, but I found myself not in the mood for this kind of show. The basic plots of the murders and how the detectives solved the crimes was similar in many respects to other crime shows: the procedures were the same and how the detective(s) fell into the solutions the same, or at least close enough to say they are the same. I was certainly not bothered by the fact that the detectives were women. But I was put off by the ""clever repartees,"" the remarks the ladies made to each other. I thought they were overdone, too many of them, and not at all clever, just the usual remarks one woman may make to another in fun. There was no spark. Accordingly, while the shows were good, I felt that there were other shows that I could watch which I would enjoy better.",1467244800,,893,4.1976744186046515

Liked the two detectives and their banter back and forth. They are good. Back when we first watched the series we were disappointed that this was all there was no more. Please, can't this series be continued?

2568390,4,B000FII2Z2,Solid performances and good mysteries.  The characters are witty and real.,1465257600,,74,5.7272727272727275

2568392,5,B000FII2Z2,"A light-hearted British murder mystery set in the northwest London suburbs follows two women detectives played by, Caroline Catz (Doc Martin) and Lisa Faulkner.  Each episode (6 50min episodes per season for 2 seasons) follows them as they solve a murder all the while operating in a traditionally male profession.  The senior detective (Catz) is from an upper class background and her partner is definitely not leading to tension and humor, especially when their love lives are discussed.
Also I really like the British penchant for crafting innovative ways of dispatching each victim.  Well worth watching.",1464739200,,608,5.3125
2568393,5,B000FII2Z2,Caroline Catz is superb again. DCI Bank and Doc Martin have nothing's nothing on her performances here. Reminiscent of Rosemary & Thyme.,1464566400,,136,5.2272727272727275

2568417,4,B000FII2Z2,Enjoyable Brit series who's two main characters are female police detectives who cleverly adapt working murder cases and keeping their personal life as focused as possible. Both women lead roles are nicely acted and believable.  I found this show to be great to sit back and watch on the couch after the day has ended. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a decent plot and storyline.,1461024000,,390,4.909090909090909
2568418,5,B000FII2Z2,Great Series.  I really enjoyed it.,1459296000,,35,4.833333333333333

2568426,5,B000FII2Z2,"A bit too hormonal at times, but at least done with good humor.  Enjoyable cast.  Sorry the series was short-lived.",1456444800,,115,4.7
2568427,3,B000FII2Z2,"The show is fine but the viewing aspect ratio distorts the viewing. Why is the playback distorted (squashed) ? I've tried all aspect rations my TV has but none render it correctly - all other shows I watch on Amazon stream fine, but not this one.",1454371200,,246,4.369565217391305

2568429,1,B000FII2Z2,"I love cop shows but this isn't really a cop show, certainly not in the sense of Wallender or Prime Suspect or The Wire. The plots are insipid and totally dated and what's up with Lisa Faulkner's work clothes? She dresses like she works in a pre-school. There are so many better cop shows to watch, including Scott & Bailey, Luther, Beck, Midsomer Murders, The Fall, Prime Suspect, and Wallander, to name just a few.",1452902400,,416,4.56
2568430,4,B000FII2Z2,"Interesting show,  A little slow at times but good acting.",1452643200,,58,4.8
2568431,1,B000FII2Z2,"The picture was stretched out and too painful to watch.

The scripts seemed to be amusing, but so painful to watch a distorted picture.",1449705600,3,135,4.625
2568432,3,B000FII2Z2,"Nothing special.
Another tv cop show.
Need cc to understand some of the words.
Plots are not to heavy so you can miss some of the show and still figure out who done it",1446249600,,167,3.9411764705882355
2568433,3,B000FII2Z2,A little too cute.  No sub-titles.  But entertainment without thinking too hard.,1446249600,,80,5.583333333333333
2568434,1,B000FII2Z2,"Wasteful as I could not use the cc, picture was squeezed and blurring.

Adjusted all setting and ended not watching.",1443139200,2,116,4.8

2568436,2,B000FII2Z2,"Caroline Catz seems always to play the same character, even in different shows. the 2 female cop thing has been done before, and better than this. While the Catz character is bearable, her cohort is not. The whole thing is predictable, particularly the relationship between the 2 characters, and their ""witty"" exchanges. Unlike most of the BBC cop shows of which I am a fan, I will not watch this again.",1438646400,,403,4.690140845070423
2568437,3,B000FII2Z2,Brit mystery...quite good. (you'll be happy to see Louisa from Doc Martin) in a new role.,1437436800,,89,4.625
2568438,2,B000FII2Z2,I was disappointed..... I expected more......I have seen Caroline Catz in better series.,1436745600,2,88,5.846153846153846

2568442,1,B000FII2Z2,"I was really disappointed in this. The level of man-hating is so embarrassing. They complain about men and ""what's out there"", yet all they seem to really want is a man. It was so distracting that I don't even remember if the mysteries were any good. There are much better mystery series than this one. Barf!",1433894400,,308,4.517857142857143
2568443,4,B000FII2Z2,"How can you miss with the wonderful Caroline Catz in the lead? Already in this mid-2000 series, she shows the mannerisms and style -- purse lips, wobbly walk, stern but churning heart -- that she would perfect in ""Doc Martin"" and ""DCI Banks."" I like the humor, the convoluted plots, and Detective Sergeant Scribbs, a terrific countervailing force.",1432944000,,347,5.0
2568444,5,B000FII2Z2,"For some reason, I ended up with Series 2, but no Series 1.  Netflix isn't offering it right now, so I ordered from Amazon for a very reasonable price.  I definitely like this show!",1432771200,,181,4.294117647058823

2568459,5,B000FII2Z2,Excellent!,1418083200,,10,10.0
2568460,2,B000FII2Z2,"This is basically Mary Higgins Clark material, which is fine but easily solvable.  The scenarios attempt to play the actresses off of one another, their desires for their hunk of a boss (who actually seems a bit inept) and one being a bit more mature than the other.  But they enter homes and filter through the items (no gloves), trying to find clues, leaving their marks and unprofessional comments all over the place.  Still, it was good to see Caroline Catz play a different role than that of the wife of Doc Martin (she looks the same and pretty much acts the same).  If there was one word to describe this series, it might be ""mindless.""  All in all, a nice diversion if you have time to kill, but nowhere near the complicated mysteries of Luther or Wire In the Blood, psychological dramas that give you few clues and keep you guessing, trying to stay one step ahead of the detectives...here, you're almost telling the detectives to catch up with you as you've already solved the case.",1416009600,,991,4.576271186440678
2568461,4,B000FII2Z2,Fun little series to entertain you on a cold wintry day.,1415923200,,56,4.181818181818182

2568463,5,B000FII2Z2,Wonderful British who done it series with a strong cast and the always superb Caroline Catz. These are stories meant to surprise you at the very last moment as to who done it.,1411689600,,175,4.333333333333333
2568464,4,B000FII2Z2,I like the two main characters.  Enjoy the interaction between them and the way the solve cases.,1409961600,,96,4.647058823529412
2568465,1,B000FII2Z2,"Totally predictable - from the ""mysteries"" themselves to the tired depiction of female detectives to the overacting all around.  ""Scribs"" dresses like a fifth-grader infatuated with Hello Kitty, and she and her partner spend a huge amount of time obsessing about their single status and their infatuation with their boss.  (The first episode has them dressing up as tarty schoolgirls to ""infiltrate"" a singles club to whose owners they have already identified themselves . . .uh, yes.)  Dialogue is not particularly witty, and the actors' delivery (and the direction of the show in general) is uninspired.  Kind of like ""Midsomer Mysteries"" but somehow not as appealing, since this series is set in a kind of homogenized British suburban ""city"" that doesn't even have the fake-medieval charm of Somerset.

Try Vera or Scott & Bailey or Prime Suspect instead.",1408233600,3,858,5.188405797101449
2568466,3,B000FII2Z2,"I'm watching on the past strength of Caroline Catz (Doc Martin), but it's not as good as I'd hoped -- yet! I think that they are going for a ""Midsomer Murders"" vibe, but the chemistry & 'quirkiness' aren't there yet. Still, I've just started Season 1, so there's still hope.",1405728000,,274,4.5
2568467,2,B000FII2Z2,"Glad we bought 2 episodes only, not season.  Tawdry stories, inarticulate dialogue, writing that wants to be comic but isn't.",1405123200,2,125,5.25
2568468,5,B000FII2Z2,I loved the movie I only regret that they only made 12 episodes. I enjoyed the series very much and I will buy series 2 next.,1398297600,,125,3.8461538461538463
2568469,5,B000FII2Z2,I have no idea whatsoever as to why this show didn't make it as a much longer lasting series. Great stories and marvelous performances! We loved it! Highly recommended!,1394928000,,168,4.827586206896552
2568470,2,B000FII2Z2,I really liked Caroline Catz in Doc Martin so looked forward to this series. Unfortunately I found episode one trite and predictable so won't be watching any more of the series.,1391990400,,177,4.741935483870968
2568471,4,B000FII2Z2,"I ordered this because I love Caroline Katz from the Doc Martin series.  It is a good detective mystery series, much better than any of the American fare.",1391385600,,154,4.5
2568472,5,B000FII2Z2,"I enjoy this series for its intelligent and silly humor.  The two female detectives and their boss make for good chemistry and are easy on the eyes and ears. The police cases are creative and show a side of British life not usually seen in other programs. The writers have been able to keep a light but snappy conversation between the two main characters as well as with others in the particular case. I recommend this series to those like myself, prefer a light and cute entertainment for the family or as a relaxing view before retiring.",1390953600,,539,4.556701030927835
2568473,3,B000FII2Z2,"I liked the first season enough to wish Amazon had not removed it from free viewing for Prime members. I wanted to see if there is more character development and better story twists in Season 2 as well. Since this is a British series, be prepared to have to pause and replay every now and then since they speak quickly and some of what they say is lost to American ears!",1379808000,,370,4.225352112676056
2568474,4,B000FII2Z2,Really good solid writing and acting have seen the dark haired one in DCI Banks (also a great show).  This reminds me a bit of Cagney & Lacey.,1378598400,,142,4.071428571428571
2568475,4,B000FII2Z2,"I enjoy watching both the female detectives.  Great banter!  I love the relationship between them and their boss.
Also I think Caroline Catz is stunning, as always.  Perhaps this show should have gone on longer than just a few seasons.",1377734400,,235,4.825
2568476,4,B000FII2Z2,"I enjoyed the series.  Not as much as some other English series, but I would recommend watching it.  The story lines were good and the characters were interesting.",1377216000,,163,4.785714285714286
2568477,4,B000FII2Z2,"These are fun stories without the gore, violence and can be fun. They go a bit far with the boss infatuation but it's much better than the heavy violence and gore.",1376352000,,163,4.290322580645161
2568478,5,B000FII2Z2,I love the british mentality and attitude. I also enjoy british female detectives. Great for laying in bed at night and viewing. The length of the episodes were just right. I would recommend this series for those who like good clean female detective movies.,1376006400,,257,4.863636363636363
2568479,5,B000FII2Z2,"I was sucked into this series immediately. It had just the right element of humor to balance the drama. It had a gripping story and the juxtaposition of the two stars...one quirky and one serious, was perfect.",1375315200,,209,4.675675675675675
2568480,3,B000FII2Z2,I used to watch these shows when they came on television and I've always wanted to see them again. I think they are very well written and should be shown all of the time. I would recommend these shows to anyone who loves mystery  shows.,1374364800,,236,4.2444444444444445
2568481,4,B000FII2Z2,"I enjoyed the banter between Ash and Scribbs. The cases are a interesting and not a rehash of every other cop show. Solid acting from everyone. If you enjoy the Brits, this is one for you.",1374364800,,188,4.25
2568482,4,B000FII2Z2,"If you like ""Murder She Wrote"", ""Diagnosis Murder"", ""Psych"", ""Monk"", etc., you might like this. I suspect it did not win any awards, but for a murder mystery show, it is not too gory and there is some humor. As a displaced (to California) Brit, I enjoy the setting in the British suburbs.",1373241600,,288,4.452830188679245
2568483,4,B000FII2Z2,would have been better if it didn't have to keep reloading  but worth watching . I saw this series years ago on bbc america and enjoyed it enough to watch again and my husband liked it too and he is a channel surfer.,1372982400,,216,4.023255813953488
2568484,3,B000FII2Z2,"Cute but not meaty.  The characters could have been defined more or given more depth even it it's a light comedy.  It reminded me of Murder, She Wrote.",1372982400,,151,4.357142857142857

2568486,4,B000FII2Z2,"Good plots and interplay among the main characters, Ash and Scribbs.  I tried this one because I'd enjoyed Caroline Catz in Doc Martin...very different character for her in this show, but well done.",1372636800,,198,5.0

2568489,5,B000FII2Z2,"Dialogue is sharp, witty,sophisticated (though sometimes hard to hear).  With streaming you can rewind, and it's worth it to hear it all. Set-ups cleverly pillory suburban tropes and put a fresh face on worn mystery formulas. Working relationship between Ash & Scribbs ...and Boss... depicted with a wonderful light touch. The victim never has our sympathy (because everyone in town hates him or her); rather, we pity the poor sap who succumbed to murdering the despicable brute.

2568495,4,B000FII2Z2,Mildly entertaining cop show with endearing characters but not great stories. Well played but a bit unforgettable. Worth a watch.,1370390400,,129,5.5
2568496,5,B000FII2Z2,"I very entertaining British cop show featuring a duo of female detectives.  Their banter and the interaction with the boss is part of the fun.

The series is truly banal. The plots are tired imitations of great detective series that we have all watched if we subscribe to Prime.

Many of the cast are fine actors who are far too talented for the lame dialog and trite story lines. The series is full of cliches, such as ""When X died part of me died too!"" Or something else along those lines.

There is nothing special about the cinematography or direction. I am left wondering how anyone could give the series a rating of ""4"" or ""5"" in the face of amazingly well crafted series, like ""Taggart"" or ""Whitechapel.""

Who in UK watched this? What demographic? What time of day? My fantasy is that exhausted housewives kept the series floating for 2 seasons, watching in the late afternoon after housework was done whilst waiting for children to return home for tea; or after children were packed away to do homework and getting everyone ready for bed was the next chapter in mum's book. Either way the show is an easy break for the lady of the house who just wants to be entertained.

2568527,3,B000FII2Z2,"This show seems a pale imitation of the American Series, Cagney and Lacey. Starring two single girls who have finding the right man in common, the show is set in a British surburbia (think a posher Brookside) with no so gory murders.

The two women seem to have an interest in their boss, a man of whom they know little but who is an endless cause of speculation.

The plots are formulaic with an ah-hah moment upon which the solution of the case depends.

One good thing about this season is the guest stars of whom, for me, the best is when Phyllis Logan and Edward Woodward appear. In that particular show there is homage to the latter's days as the anti-hero Callan when one of the suspects appears, playing with model soldiers, participants in war games.

All in all a light show with some OK storylines and pleasant photogenia. My major complaint is the music which is intrusive and out of sync with the purpose of the shows.",1361750400,,931,4.491124260355029

The actors might have been alright, but they were trapped under a horrid vehicle that would not offer them much of a chance to do anything, but look bad.

And yet the most profound questions these alleged professionals ask seem to be along the lines of ""When will I next get laid?""  This is definitely a series in which the women try too hard to be like men. The mysteries themselves are competently written, and the acting is perfect. It's the structure of the team and main characters I find impossible to believe. I just cannot believe that two such capable women could be so vacuous, shallow, oversexed, and short sighted about their own lives and what is really important in life. The understory to each mystery, in which we get glimpses of the lives of Ash and Scribbs, never fail to undermine the watchability of the show, because their lives are so pointless and trivial. No serious reflection on anything, no aspirations about anything, no value on anything, except, as I said, getting laid.  As that rarely happens, the show is neither sexually nor violently intense. Almost a cozy, except instead of the warm wisdom of a Poirot or the unfailing optimism of Davison's LAST DETECTIVE, you get female, blond versions of Heckle and Jekyll bumping into the walls of life without ever catching on to what it is about.",1243814400,9,1375,4.973913043478261
2568542,5,B000FII2Z2,"This series is very reminiscent of Midsomer Murders, only with two female detectives and a more suburban (less village-like) setting.  So not really at all like it, but similar in many respects...

Now that I have you confused, I'll say that if you like Midsomer Murders you'll probably like this series.  It spotlights the more old-fashioned police work, unlike the flashy forensics shows that are all the rage at the moment.  Ash and Scribs work mostly with interviewing suspects and gathering information, and while forensic work does poke its head in occasionally, it's never the focus.  There are the dead ends and red herrings, and a few fun twists and turns.  It does have the predictable 'the suspect breaks down and confesses' problem, which I can't imagine is very realistic, but in terms of a TV show is fairly accepted.  The bad guy pouring out everything and explaining how it was done give the viewer so much more of a sense of closure than the suspect just being arrested and taken off to court, without anything being explained.  So that unrealistic bit I can certainly overlook.

Plus, the characters are wonderful.  Neither is perfect, which is refreshing, and they have such a believable relationship.  They're not the best of friends, but they have an easy banter.  They're not terribly alike, but nor are they polar opposites.  They're witty and a bit acerbic, but not morose or mopey.  And as characters, they're both likeable.  And there's the attraction to and mystery of their boss.  Just enough of a hint of something there to get you hooked.

Last but not least, the mysteries are good, solid whodunits.  A keen mind can solve the case along with Ash and Scribs, or you can be lazy and let the story unfold.  There's nothing too bizarre about them, and yet they are original enough to be entertaining.",1217203200,,1828,4.801282051282051
2568543,4,B000FII2Z2,"3 years after Detectives Ash and Scribbs graced our television screens, Murder in Surburbia still remains one of my favorite shows. Even thought the show was packed full of more humor then drama, it was still very original and very entertaining. The chemistry between Lisa and Caroline can not be beat. And the one liners will surely have you falling over laughing. But what really got me hooked on the show, was the concept behind it. The ""burbs"" have always been thought of as uneventful and downright boring. Nevertheless, strange things can occurr there and when they do, it makes for wonderful story ideas.

I admit that having models for police detectives somewhat takes the focus off the stories and more on looks, but I don't feel they capitalized on appearances as much as they did the witty banter. In fact, most of the conversations that took place between the girls were normal, every day things women obsess over and I found it hilarious.

Overall, I'm proud to be the owner of the only two season that aired of this show. I would love to see BBC bring it back to audiences. And even though both girls have moved on to other roles, but they will always be my two favorite detectives.",1196121600,8,1196,4.636792452830188

I like all the afore-mentioned, and ""Cracker"" and ""Prime Suspect"" and ""Midsomer Murders"" and ""Inspector Lynley"" and ""Inspector Alleyn"" and ""The Bill"" - and I love this series as well. Definitely not the grit of ""Prime Suspect"" nor the complexity of ""Morse""; closer perhaps to ""Midsomer Murders"", though with more humour and a lower body count.  I love it for what makes it different, and especially the humour in the relationship between the two leads.
