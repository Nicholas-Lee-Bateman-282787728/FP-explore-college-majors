But my kids (4 and 2) loved it enough to actually sit down and be quiet for about 80 minutes.  Underlying messages of teamwork and ""never leave a man behind.""

3648981,4,B001ILFUC8,"Over the last year or so, we've seen chimps, houseflies and robots in space, so why not the Buddies? Another in a series of modestly produced family comedies starring cute adorable puppies, Space Buddies pretty much delivers on its title.

First we meet all the cute puppies and their owners (the puppies' voices are furnished by skilled young actors, including Liliana Mumy, daughter of Lost in Space legend Bill Mumy. How do they find themselves near rockets? They stowaway on a school field trip. How do they get those precious little doggie space suits? A special spacesuit-making device that just happens to require no dexterity for its operation. And how do they manage to blast off? That would be telling.

The human story angles rest upon the shoulders of Bill Fagerbakke, playing with as much conviction as he can muster a aeronautic scientist -- a switch from his roles on Coach or Spongebob Squarepants. For plot reasons, he keeps a pet ferret in his shirt pocket (I don't want to spoil the ending, but it has something to do with Amy Sedaris).

Diedrich Bader, who specializes in spaced-out eccentrics and, like Fagerbakke, has a fine career in voice acting (he even narrates Disney CD read-alongs) plays a deluded Russian cosmonaut who just happens to be accompanied by a cute Russian puppy voiced by Jason Earles, whose fearless physical comedy is a highlight of Hannah Montana.

According to a recent Bonnie Hunt Show, there's a pet shelter in Los Angeles that makes prospective owners agree never to dress their dogs if they adopt them. Maybe they can manage to resist the urge by watching the little Space Buddies' tails wag in the space costumes in this film. And stay tuned, Santa Buddies is coming soon! Arf!",1233705600,3,1728,4.8474576271186445

3648983,5,B001ILFUC8,"Space Buddies is an adorable movie. Of course it is aim towards younger kids but I am an adult and I enjoyed it. It's a great family movie. If you like the air bud/air buddies movies then I think you'll like this one as well.

Short Summary: The buddies follow their owners on a school field trip to the space station where they are going to launch a space shuttle on the moon. The buddies are curious to see the space shuttle up close so they decide to go on the shuttle. All of a sudden the shuttle launches and they are launched into space. Now the buddies have to try to get back home while they still can and they get help from their new friend Sputnik. Buy/rent this movie to see if the buddies and their new friend Sputnik can make it home to their owners.

Will the buddies be the first puppies to walk on the moon??

Don't forget to check out Space Buddies. I don't think you will be dissapointed. Space Buddies is well worth the $13 I paid for it.",1233705600,3,957,4.162162162162162
3648984,4,B001ILFUC8,"An unlikely story of 5 dogs who stow aboard a space shuttle, take a trip to a space station to pick up a Russian dog, land on the moon, then pilot the ship safely back to earth and their loving masters. It's what you would expect in a movie like this: action enough for older kids, comedy and cheese enough for younger ones. Clean fun.

The highest praise I can give it is that my children loved it and I wasn't bored (the first time.) Recommended for children of all ages.",1233187200,31,473,4.197802197802198
3648985,4,B001ILFUC8,"These ""Buddie"" films are just so cute and enjoyable, family fun films with cute puppies that you can't get enough of.

Since the 1997 debut of the film ""Air Bud"", from that film of a talking canine has launched several ""Buddie"" films featuring the golden retriever puppies in ""Air Buddies"" and ""Snow Buddies"" and this time with ""Space Buddies"".

What happens when the puppies become stowaways in an experimental spacecraft?  Expect a lot of fun and giggles for the family.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

The film is presented in 1080p high definition (1:78:1).  The film looks great on Blu-ray and the majority of the film is done using green screen and CGI and wirework.  The CG work was done quite well for this family film..  From the space station to the aircraft and its digital screens, the film looks pretty good.  Also, there is quite a bit of wirework done to emulate the puppies floating due to gravity and you don't see the wires, again, it looks pretty good.

Audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and I did notice the rear channels being used quite a bit for several action-based sequences and sound effects rather effectively.  I was very impressed to hear the all channels being utilized during the film because for a children's film, I really wasn't expecting it.  So, needless to say I was pleased by it.  Although ""SPACE BUDDIES"" is primarily a dialogue-based film, the film does take advantage of your system's surround sound, so that was definitely cool!

SPECIAL FEATURES:

There are a few special features on this Blu-ray edition of ""Space Buddies"".  The video quality ranges from 1080p, 1080i and 480i and are featured in Dolby Digital 2.0.  The special features are:

  * Buddy Facts:  You can watch the film with pop up tidbits about the making of ""Space Buddies"" and about space.
  * Buddy Bloopers: Outtakes and blunders (granted these were purposely done)
  * ""Dancing in the Moonlight"" Music Video with Disney Channel's Alyson Stoner
  * Disneypedia: The Buddies Guide to Space Travel: This was a 10+ minute featurette about the behind-the-scenes making of the film.  Also, a insight on comparisons of how real astronauts train for space and what the pippies had to do to look like they were in space.  A fun featurette that the kids will definitely enjoy!
  * Buddy Finder: Exclusive to Blu-ray is a scavenger hunt game using your remote control and while watching the film, you need to find 100 items.
  * Disney BD-Live Network: A US only feature which people with BD-Live equipped players can access special features from Disney's BD-Live Network.

I watched this film with the family and each of us enjoyed the film.  I suppose it's really hard not to dislike a film about puppies and fortunately the technology of how they make the puppies talk on film definitely works well when they mouth the words and overall, the talking portion doesn't look cheesy at all.

This is a safe family film.  For my 6-year-old, there was only one sequence in which he was a little scared but that was the Cosmonaut Yuri (because he has lived in the space station and is a bit unkept, so his hair is a bit wacky) but all in all, from his perspective, he had a lot of fun and of course, when you have a puppy who likes to eat a lot and when his paw is pulled, he lets out gas.  So, I guess you can say that the ""fart jokes"" really goes well with the kids.

As for the puppies safety, I know that there are a few dog lovers who cringe when they see animals in a film because they worry about their well-being and if they are going to be put into any dangerous situations .  The puppies were more or less kept indoors most of the time and in small and what looks like safe areas in the films, so I believe that the puppies were quite safe during filming.

As for adults who are watching this film, may you be a dog lover or a parent, the film of course is a bit farfetched especially how the puppies were always so successful into sneaking into a building or vehicle with human's nearby but with these type of films, you can't get too serious, after all it's a film made for children.  But these are the types of film that are wonderful to watch with the whole family especially if your child enjoys reading about the planets, the moon and outer space, the film and the special features will definitely be entertaining.  Heck, even if you are captivated by the charm of these puppies, you'll definitely find this film fun and entertaining.

The Blu-ray version of ""Space Buddies"" looks very good in high-definition and the audio is pretty good as well!  This is the best looking ""Buddies"" release yet!

Overall a solid, family film for the children and worthy of purchasing on Blu-ray!",1232755200,12,4701,4.58273381294964

3649077,4,B001ILFUC8,"What to say about a film that stars puppies?  It is what it is, a space fantasy for kids who like animals, and specifically cute little gold Labradors who mimic their owners in the personality department.  Junior canines find themselves launched into orbit and beyond to help save a Spuds McKensky knockoff from being stranded in the great beyond with a Crazy Ivan astronaut from the legendary (""and thankfully defunct"") Soviet space station which plummeted to Earth and crashed into the south Pacific some fifteen to twenty years ago ... (Taco Bell had a contest for anyone who could bring them a piece of the thing, or if it hit a sign on Fiji ... a little bit of trivia).

It's a harmless film with obligatory body function jokes for the kids to laugh at, and of course, the puppies.  See it once with your kids, smirk, maybe even laugh and have a good time.

Or, as the pups would say; ""Frashizin' ... Dawg!""",1392940800,,912,4.536585365853658

Directed by Robert Vince, this new adventure places the Buddies in a expiremental space craft and traveling on their way to a Russian space station. There, they meet a friendly Russian pitbull cosmonaut named Spudnick, who needs the Buddies' help to travel back to Russia and his family. Just like the other Buddies movies, the cast are very impressive(Bill Faberbakke, Diedrch Bader, Jason Earles, Amy Sedaris), and the special effects are very cool as well. The special features includes a behind the scenes featurette, bloopers and sneak peeks of upcoming Disney favourites.

When it comes to a Buddies movie, my top priority is to see those dogs.  I want the human element minimized as much as possible. If I wanted to see a movie about humans I would see a movie about humans, but I want to see a movie about dogs. And believe you me, this movie is about DOGS.

Of course the film has some plot points that are a little difficult to understand such as the suit manufacturing device on board that is compatible with dogs, and the security around a space launch being so lax.  Still, the story is as old as time: a quest home.

Also, if you were wondering if the filmmakers are able to squeeze a dog fart into the narrative, rest easy my friends.  It's there.

However, I feel the kids (the dogs owners) were not sufficiently chastised for allowing their dogs to escape the home and go to space.  I would have liked to have seen some narrative closure on that.",1357776000,,1025,4.188775510204081

3649227,2,B001ILFUC8,"I purchased Space Buddies for my two boys - 3 1/2 and 5 years - because they kept seeing the commercials for the video.  Since we're always looking for good videos, I thought I would give it a try.  In a nutshell, the movie is fair to poor.  To give some detail, the first time my 3 1/2 year old watched Space Buddies was on an airplane ride.  The movie was on for only about five minutes until he was bored.  We were at home the first time my 5 year old saw the movie, and he watched it for probably about a half hour.  We have had the movie for about a month now, and they have not asked to watch it once since the first time.

Below are some video suggestions instead of Space Buddies (most for boys):
1) Iron Giant - I cannot express in words how much my boys have loved this movie.  They are absolutely enamored by with this one.
2) 101 Dalmations
3) Spectacular Spiderman (Not Amazing or other Spiderman videos)
4) Transformers
5) Curious George Movie - They loved this when they were a little younger.  A good age group would be 2 to 4 years.
6) Enchanted - Even though this is supposed to be a girls movie, my guys really like it.  And I think it is pretty funny at times.
7) Barnyard (with Kevin James)
8) Sandlot

I have collected all the air bud series and contue to watch them when I need an ""ah"" evening.

Negatives:

2) As an adult, this movie was basically unwatchable.

3649249,4,B001ILFUC8,"This was way better than I thought it would be from the tentative reviews. It's just as good as most recent live action Disney movies, and better than some. It's also got just as good casting, just as good sets, voice acting, props, and, taking into account that it's for kids, story line.

The humans have names like Pi, Slats, and Astro; the dogs have names like Buddha, Rosebud, and MudBuddy. The Russian pitbull is named Spudnik (clever, clever!). Pi, the head spacecraft designer, stutters. Besides the five golden retriever puppies and the pit bull, the other hero is Pi's ferret pal, Gravity. Not your basic space show.
Watching the antics of these cute puppies will have your kids (or you) hitting pause on the remote (or is that paws?). The spaceship design is a cross between the shuttle and the SR 71, the most future forward looking plane ever designed. I can't wait for the ride at Disneyland. Will the kennels now have an astronaut theme?

The extras include a video of Alyson Stoner singing a classic rock, tune, ""Dancing in the Moonlight"", insterspersed with puppy clips from the film; The Buddies' Guide to Space Travel, with footage of astronauts from John Glenn to Buz Aldrin, narrated by the Buddies; coming attraction trailers; and the best, the Buddy Bloopers. These are funny outtakes with the dogs commenting on their faux pas (fore paws?) and the director yelling ""cut"".

8311102,5,B001ILFUC8,"This  was  a  big  hit  movie.
&  its  the  one  that  I've  seen  on  TV  quite  frequently  more  then  the  rest  of  the  Buddies  movies.
Buddha  is  determined  to  round  up  the  team  &  check  out  the  launch  to  the  moon.
What  they  don't  know  is  they're  getting  a  lot  more  then  bargained  for.
They're  going  to  experience  first  hand  space  travel,  make  new  friends  Spudnick  &  Gravity  the  ferret  who  ends  up  becoming  their  guide  after  their  trip  to  the  moon.
I  enjoyed  the  movie.  At  least  the  beginning,  watching  B Dawg  dance  to  the  music  just  before  meeting  Buddha  Rosebud  &  Budderball.",1505174400,,657,4.394230769230769
