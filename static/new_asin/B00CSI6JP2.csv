5737781,5,B00CSI6JP2,"Overall, this is a superb recording of wonderful music. I'll even go out on a limb and say that Maria Agresta's Gemma is better than any of the Montserrat Caballe recordings that I've heard of the role. Although Agresta's entrance is a bit hard-toned, that's more because of the music itself than her voice.  Her voice can soar, trumpet, whisper, and spin out a beautiful legato at will, and it seems to get stronger and at the same time sweeter as the opera progresses. Gregory Kunde (the Arab slave Tamas), although he tends to overact and sometimes strains at a high note or two, is still in excellent voice through most of the opera, and the tone of his opening lines in the Act I finale, ""Un suo sguardo,"" is absolutely gorgeous -- so hauntingly beautiful as to be almost eerie. In fact, the whole finale must be heard to be believed. (I keep playing those tracks over and over.) This is one of those places where Agresta's voice soars. It doesn't seem as though she even breathes; the sound just keeps pouring out in a golden stream. And the same thing happens during her final aria in the Act II finale. As for the other roles, Leonardo Galeazzi does a wonderful Guido (the faithful servant), and in fact he gets a howl of approval during the curtain calls equal to the reception given to the better-known Kunde. The only weak spot in this production is Mario Cassi's Count Vergy. His voice is adequate, but not much more than that, and he visibly braces and lunges for many of his notes. Also, if Kunde overacts, Cassi underacts. I must add, however, that when he's singing with others, especially with Agresta or in ensemble, his voice seems to get stronger and more expressive. (And of course he's quite good-looking, which makes Gemma's and Ida's attraction to him VERY understandable.)  In any case, the production is a wonderful one; the singing of Agresta and Galeazzi, as well as the ensemble singing, are alone worth the price of the DVD. Even the costumes and the stage direction are worth seeing -- and I seldom praise stage directors these days. I've played this DVD three times since I received it less than a week ago, and, as I've said, I keep playing that Act I finale over and over.",1407024000,4,2206,4.582278481012659
5737782,5,B00CSI6JP2,"If you love Belcanto opera, This is really a very pleasant surprise. 5 stars in all areas.
Production, Scenery, Costumes, Lighting, Conducting, Orchestra. I would give Donizetti's Opera and the Singing 6 stars if possible. Maria Agresta is the real deal!. Like a Caballe with high notes.
Kundry a little past his prime and perhaps some dryness of tone. No filler music here, totally enjoyable from first note to last.",1402012800,6,417,4.9714285714285715
5737783,5,B00CSI6JP2,"I am still amazed by th hidden jewels that Italian regional opera houses are producing, and the fascinating singers that make the performances worth viewing.  In this case, we have a relatively unknown Donizetti opera, and a soprano who will be inevitably compared to Monserrat Caball, the only one to have recorded it.  Maria Agresta is a natural Bel Canto soprano.
She is ably partnered by Gregory Kunde and Mario Casel.  The conductor, Roberto Rizzi Brignoli, is a Donizetti expert. The staging, thank God, is what I call ""contemporary traditional,"" not Eurotrash offensive, quite pleasing to the eye.  A veritable treasure for those who crave Donizetti.",1400371200,12,657,5.169811320754717
5737784,5,B00CSI6JP2,"This cogently dramatic opera is ripe for revival; it is a vehicle for a major spinto soprano (Caballe sang it in the seventies) and it has one in Agresti who, although unknown to me, is on the verge of a major career.  She is magnificent and deserves the ovation she receives at the curtain call.  The supporting cast is satisfactory and the production fine.  Highly recommended.",1389052800,3,379,4.712121212121212
5737785,5,B00CSI6JP2,"I had to go to Amazon's UK store to get this beauty and am so glad that I did. The other reviewers have described what a hugely melodious and well performed opera this is and I concur. It is one of many ""forgotten operas"" that amply justifies the ongoing renaissance in the bel canto period.

The story seems to fit the ""silly plot"" reason many past and some present music scholars use to denegrate anything that is not Wagner, verismo or very late Verdi (which is itself ludicrous, but that discussion is for another time and place). But the story of a woman divorced by her husband for failure to produce an heir is replete with dramatic moments, which Donizetti presents perfectly with music and which stage director Roberto Rizzi Brignoli makes the most of in his thankfully traditional staging. The confrontation betwenn ex-wife Gemma and wife-to-be Ida is very tense and well done.

Maria Agresta (Gemma) is a wonder! Hers is a huge, supple voice, capable of runs and trills and pianissimi galore. There is no extended top, so I am sure that some will criticize her much in the same way as they do Netrebko. Nonetheless, she does a superlative job in a role that has her doing a lot of extended singing. I hope that we see and hear more of her. Brava!!

As her husband, Il Conte di Vergy, Mario Cassi is excellent. His is a really rich baritone and he executes his part to near perfection. And he can act.

As his lieutenant Guido, baritone Leonardo Galeazzi is similarly gifted. His is a lovely mellifluous voice, nicely produced through the range.

Tenor Gregory Kunde (Tamas) has been singing for a long time and it shows. The voice is a bit dry and there is a bit of a wobble from time to time. While he hits all the notes, I hear some strain on the high notes, many of which end quickly, suggesting some breath issues. He has excellent stage presence and the audience clearly likes his work.

Disc quality is quite good as far as the picture goes, but in the age of HD and DTS surround, whatever were the folks at Bongiovanni thinking when this disc was issued in stereo only sound format? Hopefully this issue will be resolved by them in future releases. It would have occasioned a one star subtraction, except for the fact that this splendid work will probably not see another DVD release any time soon and the performance is simply superb.

Edit: Having seen an ""unauthorized"" DVD of Agresta doing I Puritani, my earlier comment on her lack of an extended top is dead wrong. She's the real deal!!",1388534400,14,2510,4.55210643015521
5737786,5,B00CSI6JP2,"A wonderful production of a Donizetti rarity. I have been listening to the Monseratt Cabelle/Renato Bruson cd for many years now. It was a joy to learn that a new production was available on DVD, and I have not been at all disappointed. Maria Agresta as Gemma is superb--as is the Count sung by Mario Kassi. Gregory Kunde's infidel, Tamas, is sung with passion, outrage and ferocity. It is worth the price of the DVD just to hear and see this great American tenor at work.",1387756800,14,472,4.5
5737787,5,B00CSI6JP2,"Gemma d'Vergy (1834) is from the middle of Donizetti's career. He had already achieved fame and respect with Anna Bolena (1830), L'elisir d'amore (1832) and Lucrezia Borgia (1833) and was about to write Lucia di Lammermore (1835). Gemma became very very popular at the time of its writing; the number of it's performances far outdistanced any other of his operas until about 1900. This is about the time that Bel Canto style operas lost favor with the public and went out of fashion. The last record of a performance of the opera Gemma being in Empoli in 1901. Gemma is probably the most difficult role Donizetti wrote for soprano. It requires a specially gifted and trained 'soprano d' agilita' to master it. Gemma was not heard again until it was revived in 1975 by Montserret Caballe at the San Carlo, Naples and subsequently in Barcelona and New York. It is a daunting role and Ms. Caballe said that singing one Gemma is equivalent to singing three Normas. It is still rarely done because so few sopranos have the technical equipment to perform it.
The Fondazione Donizetti at the opera house in Bergamo is reviving most all of Donizetti's 65 or so operas. This one was recorded on September 16 & 18 in 2011 and the disc was released in 2013.
The story by librettest Bidera is based on a play by Alexander Dumas and concerns the arrival back at his castle in the French county of Berry of the Count of Vergy. The Hundred Years War with England is drawing to a close as one victory after another by Joan of Arc  is forcing the English to retreat. The victorious Count has received an annulment of his marriage to his barren wife Gemma and intends to marry the younger Ida de Grevile. Gemma is outraged at this betrayal and vows not to be dismissed for the new bride and the tragedy ensues. Maria Agesta does a remarkably good job with this harrowing role. She is onstage most of the time with one emotional roller coaster after another. Her aria-finale has a complete range of conflicting emotions with ringing declamations and soft pianissimos. Not quite the equivalent of the Caballe CD of the work but a really truely moving experience. She is a star.
The tenor primo is unusual as it is the muslim slave Tamas who secretly loves Gemma and will cause the bloody ending of this tragedy. It is a big role and very well carried out by Gregory Kunde. The Count is the handsome, dapper Mario Cassi. He is a young singer of good quality baritone voice but is still in need of polishing of his vocal line and definately his acting. The others in the cast do very well with their roles especially the Guido of Leonard Galeazzi. The sets are handsome and work quite well. The costumes are delightful and bring a Medieval spirit to the work.
I drew particular pleasure from this disc from begining to end by the succession of one beautiful Donizetti melody after another. It is amazing that with some sixty years of experience with operas of all kinds that I'm still simply awed by the ever flowing beauty of the Donizetti pen. And I never tire of experiencing it. This Gemma is a gem showing the master craftsman at his pulsing dramatic best to a ""big bow-wow"" ending. Yes there are some uneven passages in this as in most all of his operas but I always want to hear them again and again. I haven't heard all of  the sixty some operas yet but....... I'm still here.",1386201600,43,3362,4.5462046204620465
5737788,5,B00CSI6JP2,"This was a wonderful opera. The costumes and sets were more traditional, perhaps more simple than you would find at the MET. Yet, it was a very affective opera. Donizetti has many beautiful melodious music and it is a pleasure to see that it is not reduced by taking it out of period as you find sometimes. The singers were very good and the soprano singing Gemma was outstanding. The music was wonderful. Donizetti is a master of melody. For the number of operas he wrote, it always surprises me what variety you find in his melodies. You do not find often several melodies pulled from other operas as sometimes the case with Rossini. You can't go wrong purchasing this opera if you like Donizetti. Could the opera be improved? Yes, but it is a very good performance.",1385424000,24,768,4.572463768115942

8585792,2,B00CSI6JP2,"The production is good, as are most of the male singers.  The major problem is the soprano.  I was expecting something along the lines of Caballe or Sutherland - a beautiful timbre to the voice.  If you expect someone who sails through the coloratura and hits the high notes with ease, look elsewhere.  This role calls for someone with a opulent voice that sings the music effortlessly.  This woman has a harsh edge to her voice and she struggles - it is not attractive.  I had to stop the disc halfway through.",1451952000,2,511,4.5

8585794,5,B00CSI6JP2,"This production of Gemma di Vergy is the best of all operas I have seen in many, many years. Beautiful traditional costumes and sets, outstanding music and, to me, the best Overture written by Donizetti.  Glory to God...no modernisms, no German coats. no eurothrash, etc. This is opera as conceived by the composer and not the whims of modern directors. Agresta in the role of Gemma is spectacular. She is a beautiful woman with a big beautiful voice. All the other singers are also very good. We must thank Bergamo's Donizetti Festival. I hope we get a Caterina Cornaro from them",1430092800,4,580,4.742574257425742

8585796,5,B00CSI6JP2,"I enjoyed watching operas that I am not familiar with, when I saw this production with so many good reviews I bought it at and I found very good, first the cast is outstanding. I only was familiar, from other performances the one who sang the main character: Maria Agresta and Gregory Kunde who played Tamas and both were very good. The chorus supported very well the soloists.
The scenery was very beautiful, glass windows could be seen using specials effects and lights, these techniques were very successful for all the performance. The costumes played an important role complementary the scenery.
The music was sublime, with all the areas, duets and ensembles that evocate the drama that has taken until the tragic ending: Count of Verges murder and the killers suicide.
I highly recommended this production.",1419120000,4,812,4.977941176470588
8585797,5,B00CSI6JP2,"Just about all the raves and superlatives about this performance and video production have been written, and I dare say that I cannot add much to what has been said. In particular I appreciate Dr. John Rippon's review (and the follow-up comments, as well). I can only add my total concurrence. Yes, I have two performances of GEMMA with Caballe, and while this present performance does not efface the memory of those presentations, it does indeed come close. Just a few months ago FANFARE Magazine (July/August 2014) reviewed this offering, and the reviewer, Bill White, writes that Agresta's voice ""spreads rather unpleasantly in the higher register.""  Although I think one could perhaps hear a minor lack of control when she first comes on stage, I most definitely do NOT hear a spread in the final scene (about the final 15 minutes), which is, for my ears, quite incredible (I have played it numerous times since acquiring this DVD, and for friends, who agree with me). I don't know what recording Bill White was listening to.... He does, however, recommend the recording ""until something better comes along.""  Well, given the parlous state of much of opera today, the Eurotrash and over-parted singers, I give sincere thanks for this fine DVD issue. Certainly, this is not a MET or La Scala production, but in many ways it measure up to their standards, even surpassing them at times. It is an excellent representation of this neglected Donizetti work....and I join the others Amazon reviewers in highly recommending it.",1416268800,8,1524,4.972549019607843
