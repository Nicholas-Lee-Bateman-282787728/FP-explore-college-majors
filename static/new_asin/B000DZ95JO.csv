2475751,3,B000DZ95JO,not as in depth in instruction and application as I would have liked.,1168473600,,69,4.384615384615385
2475752,5,B000DZ95JO,"I ordered this from another source, because I love Rodney Yee's approach to yogo, The first time I used it, I was disappointed and considered returnng it. I got a bit of a headache and did not feel that the routine did much.  but I gave it another try and boy am I glad!  I could not believe how fluid, alive and awake I felt,  and how energized, glowing I looked.  This is very subtle method of re-awakening the body, bringing consciousness and relaxation back into  our back, our feet, our hands, our abdomen,  and to those dense, hidden places of tension we all have.  wonderful gift to give ourselves or someone else, and does not take a lot of time to work wonders. It is subtle, more like reconnecting with the body awareness, freedom that babies have, that we all had at one time, and still have the memory of in our cells. Thank you, Rodney Yee for another amazing yoga tool.  this one is worth exploring, playing with. like a child. re-familiarizing ourselves with our beautiful body and reclaiming the parts we lost.",1141948800,10,1026,4.508108108108108
8102923,5,B000DZ95JO,"such a simple system, and yet it's the best I've found for self-massage.  Funny that three rubber balls beat out all the expensive gadgets out there. I use these when I feel tight in my shoulders, neck and back, and they really get into the muscles.  They are a bit awkward, and they take more effort to use than electric massagers, but they do the job better.

And, they are reasonably priced.  After all, the system is really just three rubber balls and a how-to DVD. The product could easily be priced higher like so many others today by going on some over-hyped notion of pain relief, but the company resisted doing that, which is laudable. I also love the concept that the DVD emphasizes, that the more awareness you have of your body, the healthier you will be, and this product is great tool for that.

Definitely recommended as an addition to a yoga regimen, and to anyone who just wants to take better care of their body.",1262822400,,930,4.479289940828402
8102924,5,B000DZ95JO,"This product is simply fanstatic. Great at getting right into and gently but deeply massaging and relaxing the muscles of the back,shoulders,neck and abdomin. A truly great product. Rodney Yee is a great yoga teacher. I recommend this product for anyone who has muscular tension and wants to learn to relax.",1236297600,,307,5.03921568627451
8102925,4,B000DZ95JO,"These balls are wonderful.  I've had problems with my back and neck for years and these balls really help.  I use them to release the tension in my muscles before I start my yoga routine.  The DVD is not the type of DVD that you watch over and over.  It is merely an instructional video that shows how to use the balls.  Once learned, there are endless possibilities!",1218585600,,367,4.338235294117647
8102926,3,B000DZ95JO,"My review is mixed. I like the balls that come with this kit--you get three and there are other kits that cost the same and deliver only one or two balls, however, the DVD is not what I was expecting since the  exercises demonstrated on the balls are too few.

I am looking for another DVD from some other instructor to unlock the potential for this tool kit.

I have a number of Rodney Yee DVDs and I really like his approach to yoga, but having said that---I can't rate this DVD very highly as an instructional tool for using the balls. Yee only demonstrates a few massage/exercise options with the balls and spends most of the DVD doing yoga with a student--without incorporating the balls.

So the balls are great, the single neck, lower back, arm and stomach instructions he gives--really minimal--are good, but limited, and for an instructor of this calibre I would have expected a much more nuanced treatment of the potential of the balls to ease muscle tension.

Granted Yee is yoga oriented and he's not likely to to omit yoga altogether, but realistically people buying this particular kit would benefit from a more extensive focus on exercises that can be done directly on the balls, not after a yoga session.

So should you buy it? If you are really looking for an all over tension releaser--something to show you what all these balls can do --then no.

If you have neck issues, lower back issues --then you might want to get the system and just stick the balls under your neck and lower back as instructed. But you can use two tennis balls to the same effect and roll your lower back on them--also feet and hands on one, and then put two under your cervical spine at the base of the skull for your neck.

I had a nueromuscular therapist teach me how to do that. You can probably google for the same. I was hoping for a little more instruction from Yee.

Just FYI, the other main product of this type at Amazon has the same issue in its customer reviews. The DVD does not really offer much in the way of instruction.

hope that helps
best,

8102927,5,B000DZ95JO,"I rarely go a day without using these yoga balls! I try to use them every morning first thing when I get up. Relieves all the tension, aches and pains to help the rest of my day go much smoother. Also goes great with the book ""Ultimate Body Rolling Workout"". Gives you more things to do with the larger ball. I liked these balls so much I bought these as a Christmas gift for some one else...who loves them as much as I do.",1200096000,,423,4.0476190476190474
8102928,3,B000DZ95JO,"I have been using rodney yee's videos over the last 2 years and was excited to try this new yoga system. I have to admit I was pretty disappointed the first time I used the system. It was basically just laying on your back with  the balls underneath. I had my husband try it out to see if it was worth keeping. He seemed to enjoy it more than I. I kept at it and I am seeing progress. It seems to work best in conjunction with Mr. Yee's other videos. It is a good ""cool down"" option for getting at those hard to reach areas that hold tension.",1195948800,2,542,3.9724770642201834
8102929,4,B000DZ95JO,"I had done some trigger point therapy before but I used harder balls. I know these are the original gaiam balls for this kind of work but it took me a while to feel like they were helping - maybe because I was used to more pressure (which others might not like).  Now I like them though - they definitely help, i just find you have to stay on the balls for some time before you start feeling the effects.",1188000000,3,404,4.05
8102930,5,B000DZ95JO,I teach and this is a great tool for the women I teach.,1180224000,,55,3.3076923076923075
8102931,3,B000DZ95JO,"the 2 small yoga balls never stayed inflated, but the medium one is good.  rodney yee is a great leader",1173744000,,103,4.15
8102932,4,B000DZ95JO,"I have serious muscle tension in my back, shoulders, and stomach -- these really seem to help.  This system is a great way to work out tension in hard to reach or hard to relax areas, and it gives you some nice stretching, too.  This is a good buy, too, I think.",1170633600,5,262,4.019230769230769
