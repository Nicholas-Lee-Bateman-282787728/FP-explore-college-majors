2485033,5,B000E31ODK,"As a Spanish teacher with over 10 years of experience, I LOVE this product.  My students also love this product.  I own both Muzzy I and II and used them with kindergarten and first grade.  As students get into middle school they begin to BEG for me to show the videos again.  So, we repeat them in 7th grade.  They are amazed when they re-view the videos how much they've learned over the years, and that they can understand it, almost as easily as if they were watching it in English.  All of the basic vocabulary/verb conjugations/constructions are presented in the videos in a comprehensible way that grabs kids' attention.  I've seen that others have complaints about the graphics, but my kids LIKE that it is low-budget, old school retro!  Viva Muzzy!

For older students, I use La Catrina (10 stars!!) as my 'fun' supplement.",1269388800,8,832,4.682758620689655
2485034,1,B000E31ODK,"We purchased this DVD set to assist in teaching myself and my toddler a second language since my husband speaks french.  The audio in this DVD is very poor quality!  You can't understand anything Muzzy is saying.  The cartoon is very outdated.  I had to make three phone calls to the company before I finally was able to speak with someone in order to return the product.  The representative said okay, just return it.  I had to ask her if she was interested in why I wanted to return the product.  She said several people have complained it is outdated, obviously they are not interested in changing it.

DO NOT waste your money on this product!!!",1251331200,7,648,4.525862068965517
2485035,4,B000E31ODK,"I got the one with all the languages.  Extremely overpriced but worth it.  I have a 3 and 7 year old and they speak primarily English and understand spanish but do not speak fluently yet.  I am Spanish but my husband is Italian. I bought it for that reason.  I made them watch it first in English, then Spanish.  They watched all the cds (1-12) and they speak spanish so much better.  We are now working on Italian.  Worth every penny.",1247616000,3,435,4.296296296296297
2485036,1,B000E31ODK,"I am a father of a 3 year old boy and want him to learn Spanish.  I saw the ad for this and it sounded perfect.  I ordered it (thankfully for a 30 day trial) and I have to say I am apalled.  I feel completely taken advantage of.  This product is a complete scam.  The founder of Early Advantage obviously got a great deal on the copyrights to this tacky cheaply produced early 70's program and decided to swindle us all through good marketing.  I am astounded.  Amazon should stop selling this IMMEDIATELY.  Do not purchase it.  Run don't walk.  They put more into the decorative tin and the stuffed Muzzy doll than into the program.  The price of it is UNBELIEVABLE for the amount of material that you get and the quality thereof.  I wouldn't pick this up at a garage sale for 25 cents.  I mean that.  This is a shameless scam and I don't know how the people at Early Advantage can sleep at night.  There are free programs like Sesame Street in Spanish (Plaza Sesamo) etc. that we can get on our television at home.  Look further.  Don't waste your time with this.  You will be sorry if you order it.  If you see a good review it is probably a plant from a representative of the company.  I only gave this one star because it is not possible to give something ""no stars.""",1240444800,9,1272,4.2426778242677825

Finally I got a live person who said ""Oh, it says this product is on back order, I didn't know it was on back order. Let me find out and call you back."" Well it is Oct 10th and I have not had a call back and do not have the product.  No one ever mentioned it is on back order and so I am out $250.75.

2485038,5,B000E31ODK,We bought the Muzzy Spanish DVD program for our son when he was an infant. He is now two and a half and understands a lot of Spanish and he really loves the cartoons. I would recommend it. We are planning to get it in other languages as well.,1211414400,4,242,3.9591836734693877
2485039,4,B000E31ODK,"Our kids (6, 4 and 2) have definitely picked up some spanish after several viewings of this set, and they enjoy it for the entertainment.
It is very low budget in video and sound quality, but they don't seem to notice it like I do.  I find the story line to be mostly interesting with a king, queen and princess, and it creatively includes loads of vocabulary in life situations, but I don't think there should be a love triangle for a kids' educational video curriculum.
So, it works but it could use updating in quality and storyline.  Then it would be worth the asking price.",1205712000,11,578,4.443396226415095
2485040,3,B000E31ODK,"the graphics are very poorly done and the dialogue on the dvd's is unclear for the amount that you will have to pay for the product brand new.  My kids who are 4 and 8 did seem interested in the dvd's because they wanted to learn spanish, the product isn't worth the money. I think no one should pay over $20 for the program.",1196985600,24,325,4.078125
2485041,1,B000E31ODK,"I bought this product hoping to find a spanish-language video for my young child.  We already speak spanish at home and wanted to reinforce it.

This product is horrible.  The graphics are poorly done and ancient so they don't grab a child's attention in this day and age and the dialogue and story are boring.  It is also difficult to understand what they're saying as the audio isn't clear either.  It's way too expensive for what you're getting and my son never got interested in the product.  What a waste of my money.

I got stuck with mine as I didn't return it within 30 days so I'm giving it to the Salvation Army as I find it worthless.",1196380800,20,645,4.369747899159663
2485042,2,B000E31ODK,"Overpriced and poorly made.  As others said the story line is poor, the graphics are poor, the sound is poor and it really doesn't do a good job in teaching Spanish.

I'm bilingual and have done a better job by speaking to my son on our drives to and from preschool.  Save your money and instead buy the ""Atencion Atencion"" DVDs and music, they at least focus on what kids are interested in it.  My son got more out of watching an hour of Atencion Atencion (I overheard him counting from 1 - 5 in Spanish) than weeks of Muzzy.  Wish I would have returned it. I was a sucker and bought the two packages.

DON'T.

My son did get a tiny bit out of it, but not enough to make it worth the cost.",1344211200,3,690,4.066666666666666
2485043,3,B000E31ODK,"The Spanish is hard to understand at times, but when I noticed it was't clear I repeated  the word and sometimes definition while watching it with my children. I know some Spanish and that helped. The animation is decent, not at all as terrible as some say. My children liked it because they are used to only watching limited television and only select shows. I can see how the story would be boring for a child who is used to watching a lot of television for entertainment. It is defiantly not worth the price of $200 new. I found a copy at the public library and was thrilled. Check out your local library or look into buying it used. I am also not too fond of the story line, but i watched it with my girls and answered any questions and gave guidance. It is a good way to introduce your child to a language in a fun and effective way.",1327881600,,838,4.204968944099379
2485044,1,B000E31ODK,My kids (age 4 and 5) immediately hated the DVD's. I do speak Spanish and thought a video would be fun to help me teach my daughters. This was one of my most disappointing purchases. They won't even watch it because it is so poorly done it doesn't hold their interest. It is difficult to understand. Just awful. Look elsewhere for Spanish videos.,1326844800,2,346,4.507936507936508
2485045,4,B000E31ODK,"I used this to learn Spanish with  my kids.  It's very silly but it works.  At first it was hard to make out the Spanish words (since we were new to the language), but we followed along closely with the script book and that made a huge difference.  I gave it 4 stars and not 5 because we are Christians, and the story has Silvia telling a lie, and there is one part where there is a swear word.  The CD was pretty useless and we did not use the cassettes at all.  The vocabulary builder tapes are pretty boring.  But the story itself (on 2 VHS tapes) is funny and really helps kids (and adults) learn the basics of Spanish.",1309737600,,623,4.099173553719008
2485046,1,B000E31ODK,"I had great hopes with this product, but am sadly disappointed. The quality is poor.  In order to be an excellent language tape, I would expect the spoken word should be clear with good enunciation.  Not the case with this Muzzy DVD. The words are garbled and difficult to pronounce after listening.  Initially I was quite excited with the multiple languages DVD, as this could be a good opportunity for my kids to have exposure to more than the Spanish that I ordered. The excitement was short lived.  At this point I have an expensive stuffed Muzzy doll and dust collector DVD set.  I don't admit to anyone that I purchased this product nor would I ever disclose what I paid for it. I suggest looking at a garage sale if you really still desire the set.",1304035200,,755,4.481751824817518
2485047,5,B000E31ODK,"My mom was a french professor and as a child I was introduced to french early in life. My mom had bought Muzzy for me to watch and learn from. I LOVED it as a child and still do to this day. For those that say it's horrible, I can tell you from my own experience that it is not. I learned quite a bit of french from it and retained that french until later on when I took french classes in school. I grew up without a television so maybe that's why I don't care so much about the ""awful"" graphics back then, but it doesn't bother me now and I do have cable. My niece and nephews were watching it earlier today on youtube and loved it! They are bilingual with english and spanish so I was showing them the french and they've been saying the french words all night.

I'm looking into getting the dvd set since I no longer have a vhs player.

Get this program if you want something fun for your young one.",1295049600,3,901,4.027932960893855
2485048,1,B000E31ODK,"so I thought it has to be good! I ordered it...tried to listen to with my son and we were both very disappointed. One it teaches very little French only a handfull of words, phrases but the quality is so poor. The images are horrible and cartoons were better done 70 years ago. The sound was the worse. If you were able to make out the sound to hear what they were saying you were lucky. We sent it back and our using our library on line with a program that they have and are now learning it for free and joined a French Club. My son is now excited about learning French and enjoying it. I would not recommened this muzzy program for anyone. There are simply NO advantages to the program.",1292284800,,688,4.180451127819549
2485049,1,B000E31ODK,"I ordered this product for the 30-day trial; was also told I would receive my $10.95 shipping fee, if I returned it. It is poorly made. I'm reminiscent of 1970's cartoons. The audio is horrible, you cannot hear much of it; how are you going to learn it? The story line did not keep my child interested. The case it was sent in and the stuffed animal has had more time put into them!

Then to top that off, I sent it back within the 30 day limit. It took almost a month for them to agree it was received; I had confirmation that it was received 4 days after I sent it. Then I was told the fee would be refunded in 7-14 business days. After this time frame with no refund, I called back and was told it was non-refundable. When I asked the rep where it stated this online; she said under terms and conditions. When I could not find this, I spoke with a manager. He told me it does not state this, but they're not refunding anyway. When I asked to either have my refund or something in writing sent to me; or direction to anything on the website telling me the fee is non-refundable...I was hung up on. By the manager. Very unprofessional!

So I have now paid about $20 to have this dvd for a whole day!

It's a scam, and is not even worth $20!",1291075200,5,1241,4.098765432098766
2485050,5,B000E31ODK,"I read a lot of reviews about Muzzy: graphics are horrible, sound is a bit garbled, doesn't hold my child's interest. I decided to try it out anyway. And you know what? It works!

It holds my son's interest, and I and his tutors truly believe that this is because we do not allow him to sit in front of the tele for hours upon hours watching mindless cartoons. I find that his little friends who have tried watching Muzzy and gave up, or their parents did I should say, is because the child would rather watch the slapstick, disgusting comedies that they show on our cartoon and children's networks, and the parents give in.

The storyline is exciting- and the songs are catchy. Sound might sound garbled to us, but it isn't because this is how the Spaniards speak: I know because my family is from Andalusia. They understand it fine: and say that when they watch the English version it sounds garbled to them while I disagree: so the sound quality is all based upon the listeners ear.

The graphics are from the 1980's -- parents nowadays should appreciate this trip to the cartoons of our era. Not everything was done with computers and fancy graphics.

Muzzy has been around for nearly 30 years, and its not because it didn't work. They have a 30 day money back guarentee when you order directly from them. Overall, Muzzy does exactly what its intended purpose is to do: to introduce language to the developing minds of our children.",1276214400,16,1436,4.554263565891473
2485051,4,B000E31ODK,"Back in the 1980's we were homeschooling our 3 children, and wanted them to have a second language.  We chose the Muzzy German program to start because they were so young and we didn't want to overwhelm them.  They loved it and memorized the whole thing - actually taking what they had learned and communicating with each other with German phrases that were taken from the program and rearranged in original, creative and correct ways.  When they were older, we advanced them to a traditional curriculum that was aired on a cable ""educational"" tv channel.  They did well, and seemed to take to it better because they already had an elementary understanding of the language from Muzzy.

Now they are all adults, and our eldest is fluent in German, our middle is passable in German, and our youngest doesn't have a second language because she chose not to pursue it seriously (she kept changing her mind about which language to learn and gained a basic understanding of several languages without ever mastering one).  However they all have a better grasp of the English language and grammer as a result of their early exposure to other languages.  Now, our grandchildren are getting started on Spanish with Muzzy, and just like their parents before them, are beginning to speak to each other in little bits of Spanish.  They are even inventing little games in which they are experiencing the same incidents in the Muzzy story - especially the part where Corvax creates hundreds of Sylvia clones.  It is so funny to hear my 5 year old granddaughter exclaim that she sees herself everywhere!  LOL!  The story is cheesy, but it seems very real to my granddaughters, and they are deeply invested in this immaginary world!

Muzzy will not teach another languge all by itself, but it is a good place to start with preschoolers.  And it never hurts to add other Spanish language childrens videos that you can get on PBS or the public library.  As some of the negative reviews stated, the graphics are poor and the storyline is silly, but our kids seemed to get past that pretty easily. In the 1980's, it did not seem as outdated as it does today, but the video quality and cheesy storyline do not get in the way with kids who are allowed very little TV exposure - even in 2010.  Anything of this sort is novel to them and they hang on every word.

I gave it only 4 stars because it is too expensive for what it is.  However, you can easily find used sets on Amazon, Ebay, garage sales and thrift stores for much better prices than new... in the 80's we didn't have all those resources for purchasing used programs and were forced to pay top dollar for a spanking new set; it stung our very thin pocketbook, but we were still glad we did it.  These days, this program can be had for almost nothing.  We are borrowing the Spanish sets for our grandkids FOR FREE from the public library in our town. I highly recommend it for people who realize that truly learning another language requires a degree of dedication that makes a person willing to advance past these beginning steps. Our eldest became fluent because she actually lived in Germany as an exchange student for a year.  It was a long road to genuine fluency, and she started with Muzzy.

NOBODY WILL COMPLETELY LEARN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE FROM MUZZY, BUT THIS IS A GREAT AND FUN START FOR TODDLERS AND PRESCHOOLERS WHO ARE AT A PRIME AGE FOR ABSORBING LANGUAGE SKILLS.",1273708800,48,3413,4.608264462809918

8104649,1,B000E31ODK,"""Muzzy"" is a well recognized name in children's language courses & I thought this would be ideal for laying a foundation in a second language for my children whom we home-educate. I was terribly mistaken! I am so dissatisfied & disappointed with this product. I'm not so much bothered by the quality of the cartoons (reminiscent of vintage Sesame Street cartoon shorts) as I am with the sound quality. This is a language program. How is one supposed to learn a knew language if the words are indecipherable? The only segment that is (mostly) clear is the alphabet. The sound is so poor, I really cannot fathom this system being of any use to anyone who does not already know the foreign language this was intended to ""teach"".",1389571200,4,725,4.671875
8104650,1,B000E31ODK,"Just like other people have stated over and over, the graphics are beyond TERRIBLE, the sound and talking are MARBLED, so good luck even trying to understand English let alone another language. Sure, my daughter watched the video when she was a toddler, but she did not learn anything, just watched mindless mumbling. Your children will NOT learn a 2nd language with this product, so save your time and money! I also did not receive my product like another reviewer stated, and many, many emails and phone calls, along with aggregation, when I did speak to someone they always said they were closed because they were in England. They charged my card and I had to fight to be credited. I watch a friends videos, thank goodness I got my money back. Hopefully this will safe another person the terrible experience.

8104651,1,B000E31ODK,"I brought the overly priced Muzzy program for my children. It seems as if the program lacked a lot of updates. The graphics were really old. The audio was often mumbled and unclear. The Muzzy American English rubric taught an older dialect of ""How do you do?"" rather than just saying ""Hello"". I would not suggest buying the Muzzy program at the retail price. The ENTIRE program is worth about $10-$20(max). You may find better segments posted on YouTube.",1380585600,2,454,4.7594936708860756

The video quality is not very high tech, but what they lack in technology is made up by the creativity of the story line and the drawings are cute.
