If the VHS had subtitles, I would have given it a 5-Star. The Florentine Opera of Milwaukee is doing this Opera next season.",1525046400,,279,4.833333333333333
7844730,5,6303368832,"This is a finely tuned opera with music by the Italian composer, Claudio Monteverdi, libretto by G. E. Busenello, and the fine voices of contralto Maria Ewing, baritone Dennis Bailey, and several other sub-leads is not to be missed and will be fully enjoyed.  No lead tenor here and none needed.  No soprano here as a lead and none needed.  One of the joys of my watching and listening outside the opera hall.  The story line is strong and the tale well carried out.  With English subtitles and in VHS format.  Robert M. Nied, Jacksonville, Florida.",1429574400,,549,4.666666666666667

7844732,5,6303368832,"Maria Ewing is a friend of mine.  I have always been thrilled by her performances.  This performance is no different.  She is stunning as is the entire cast and production.  This should be in every opera fans library.  But, more importantly, this DVD would be a great tool to turn new fans on to opera and how exciting and informative it can be when done correctly! Brava and Bravo!!!",1171843200,3,384,4.507246376811594
