7926229,1,B00004XQPD,"This video was nothing more than an advertisement to sell Magill's accessories and those cold steel, benchmade, syderco, knives.
Aside from the fact that he is a camera junkie, I would like to see how he really would handle in the streets because he seems that his street smarts came from a book.
Let me mention a few things, he does cutting demonstrations that cut through leather this that and the other because ""you will encounter this kind of knife in the street."" Those knives he uses cost about $60-$150 with keen edges. A punk on the street will most likely have an imported cheapie with a crappy edge. Another thing is that it is not all that impressive to cut fruits (they are  soft and it is a waste of food). I do not understand why he calls it advanced techniques because he only babbles common sense. He looks constipated when he does the cuts because he holds his breath (which is a big NO NO in anytype of fighting). He tells you to hold the unarmed hand in front parallel to shoulder (mince meat for an above average knife fighter. Finally, he says to hold the knife with a strong grip so you won't cut your fingers when stabbing but he let his grip up when doing the attacks to his partner (whatever happened to living by what you teach?).  This video was a waste of my money and I wouldn't even have the gull to sell it to my worst enemy.

7926230,2,B00004XQPD,"I like Lenny Magill - he is certainly very knowledgeable about self-defense and guns, knives, etc. Unfortunately, I really didn't learn anything from this video. In the beginning of the video, he says if you are in a knife fight, the best way to survive is to get away, because if you hang around, you will get cut.
Now, that's good advise, and very true. But I didn't need a video to tell me that. Also, he spends a lot of time showing you how a knife will damage your body, how it will cut through various thicknesses of clothing, etc. There was a brief portion of the video where he showed various techniques for opening a knife one-handed, but again, I think most people who carry a densive-type knife already know how to open it one-handed.
Most of the video shows Lenny cutting up pieces of meat wearing various pieces of clothing. Very, very little on actually fighting with a knife though.
If you are a Lenny Magill fan as I am, you could add it to your collection, but I think you'll be dissappointed. Also, if you are hoping to catch a glimspe of his wife or any of the other ladies he uses in some of his videos, sorry, but they're not in this one!",1056240000,,1159,4.321100917431193
