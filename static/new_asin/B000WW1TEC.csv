8629270,3,B000WW1TEC,"I have watched the first disc, and it does give a lot of information.  There is a story about a new band getting what they think is a great record deal, but is not.  The story is in a ""rolling credit"" format, and it is hard to read.  In between each person's interview you have the same ""411 commercial"" which gets to be annoying.  Does give a lot of good advice and contacts, but is really a promotional for the web site as well.",1221523200,,430,4.083333333333333
