2457424,5,B000CCW2SO,"This was when Benny and his gang had truly hit their stride and decided to go into overdrive with the cheeky humor. Thank goodness they brought in Hill's Angels to give his gang of elder comics something worthy of being dirty old men over.  I've been trying to watch these episodes on BBCAmerica, but they butcher them up. There's no need to feel the mercy of a bunch of TV programmers - get your Benny Hill uncut and not ready to be passed off as family friendly.

So sing along with Benny's wicked tales and follow his lusty leer. This is a series worth putting on your shelf.",1135123200,21,578,4.342592592592593
2457425,5,B000CCW2SO,It was so much fun sitting down with my husband and watching Benny Hill old shows.  We refuse to have cable at our vacation home instead we have chosen to purchase dvd's to watch and we love all the old shows,1380153600,,208,4.073170731707317

2457429,5,B000CCW2SO,"Benny Hill is great for a laugh at any time, unlike the so called comedians of today which I mostly consider vulgar instead of being funny, Benny Hill is a true comedian. And the added bonus, of the Hills Angels, adds some extra eye-candy for the men to watch.",1319328000,,260,4.326530612244898
2457430,5,B000CCW2SO,"If you are a Benny Hill fan, these are a must. The first season wasn't so great but that is only because Benny Hill was trying to figure out his show. After that he found his groove and was hilarious. I have ordered the first four seasons so far and will be ordering others. Great seller.",1317686400,,288,4.160714285714286

2457432,4,B000CCW2SO,"I love watching Benny Hill, but this set has an unusual amount of skits and gags (especially in the 3rd disc of this set) that were done before in the first 2 sets.  It almost seems like he was running out of ideas and decided that enough time had elapsed that he could get away with redoing old stuff.  Still, there's some great original stuff.  There's also a lot of Hill's Angels dancing.  While I enjoyed this as an adolescent, now it seems more like filler fluff.  I still watch it though.",1232841600,2,494,4.326086956521739

2457435,5,B000CCW2SO,"Kudos' to British television and Benny Hill for pushing the naughty button. Set four offers more cheeky British humor and the beautiful hill's angels. The video transfers are well done and the audio is clean & crisp. Once again A&E Home video has done a fantastic job with this set. British audiences have always known what a comedic talent they had in Benny Hill, but I really never appreciated his brand of humor until now. With the way everything has to be politically correct, many of the Benny Hill sketches wouldn't make it to air on regular television today. I've really enjoyed every minute of this hilarious three disc set. Thanks Benny !!

DVD Features Include:
*I Was a Hill's Angel Featurette
*The Benny Hill Cheeky Challenge Trivia Quiz #4
*Interactive Menus",1166227200,5,771,4.840909090909091
2457436,5,B000CCW2SO,"Few comics can compare with the genius of Benny Hill. Not only does he star in his productions, he writes, directs and song writes the show contents....He's truly a one of a kind.",1156204800,3,179,4.454545454545454
2457437,5,B000CCW2SO,"There wil only be one Benny Hill. His sort of comedy will always be very popular and a good laugh however many times you watch it. Nice to see old favourites and some sketches you may have forgotten. A great colection of his shows and not forgetting the beautiful ""Hills Angels."" Highly recommended.",1151625600,2,299,4.660377358490566
2457438,5,B000CCW2SO,"As a Brit who followed Benny's great TV shows in the 1970s and 1980s, it pains me to see how the Great Man is so poorly treated by the country that he brought so much laughter to.

No reruns on TV's UK Gold... no anniversary tributes... no specials celebrating his fantastic humour... nothing. Not even this DVD set, which is only available in the USA! It's as if the whole establishment is ashamed of him.

And why? Because he had a few scantily-clad girls in his shows.

Quite why this is sneered at with such venom by today's politically correct critics is beyond me - to me it's no worse than any of the vile so-called humour peddled by the likes of Julian Clary, Graham Norton, Ben Elton, Eddie Izzard and a whole host of current 'right on' so-called comedians, who aren't fit to lick Benny's boots.

There's nothing wrong with a bit of wholesome heterosexual titillation - in fact, in this day and age it's positively refreshing.

So a huge thank you to A&E from one very grateful Brit for releasing every one of the Great Man's shows, in full, unedited, and with no adverts either! Absolutely fantastic top drawer laugh-out-loud comedy, delivered with that famous cheeky twinkle in Benny's eye. A gold-topped DVD set!",1151280000,28,1224,4.648148148148148
2457439,5,B000CCW2SO,"HEY - THE MAIN MADCAP MAN IS BACK!!!!  So wonderful to see you and the gang again, old friends - even the mention of your name brings a warm smile to one's lips and a chuckle for all the wonderful moments of clean comedic creativity and mature moments of monumental madness that graced us all with good times over the years.  God Bless you Benny, and hope you are making the heavens roar with laughter, those lucky angels get to hear your ballads and songs, which I miss most!  Mature Stable Adults will keep your legacy grounded for what it truly is - a blessing- something truly unique and warmly affectionate in the greater tradition of humor from the heart!

2457440,4,B000CCW2SO,"This fourth installment of Benny Hill The Early Years focuses on the Hill Angels skits and musical numbers. The best skits are the Wondengran Vs Dracula and Dr. Jackal and Mr Hyde(a spoof of Wonder Woman,Saturday Night Fever,A Tribute to the Low Tidmarsh Fire Brigade,Big Poppa,The 3 Musketters Man Wanted and many more specially the fast skits. Also included is a featurette with some of the Hills Angels talking about their experience on the show best moments and sketches and also about Benny how he was,rehersals and much more. I'm waiting to see next installment.",1143244800,10,568,4.989473684210527
2457441,5,B000CCW2SO,"I grew up watching these shows having always been a fan of British humor.  Monty Python shows and films are still some of my favorite.  Benny's humor is a bit racey but now that we've gotten to the ""Hill's Angels"" years, it's interesting to see the documentary from many former ""Angels"" and hear there take on the show and it's critics.  They felt the men came out looking stupid; or someway or another, were the loosers.

Critics were always harsh on this style of ""sexist"" humor but I feel it's far more innocent than some of the trash out there today, and I'm not talking about porn or cable shows but regular TV.  Tell me Desperate Housewives or I'll bet many soap-operas aren't far worse than any cheeky humor from this kind, baby-faced British treasure.

Benny still makes me laugh...

2457442,5,B000CCW2SO,"Yes it is Benny the Great, and ""not a lot of people know that."" Benny Hill was one of the greatest comedians of the 20th century and this DVD set showcases some of his best work. It includes classics such as ""Wonder Gran v. Dracula"" and ""Friday Night Fever."" I remember watching these episodes on cable and laughing my head off. When I saw these DVDs coming out, I made sure to pre-order as soon as I could. Don't listen to the detractors and help yourself to a dose of Benny today.",1139184000,15,482,4.25

Benny Hill is truly a genius and you can see it through his sketches, songs, silent mini-movies, bloopers and more. This set is really good indeed, one of my favourites. I can't wait to have the next set.",1138665600,7,373,4.054054054054054

It starts out with Wonder Woman spinning into an old lady who kicks the bald guy up on the roof of a ceiling. It is so hilarious!!!!",1136419200,3,299,4.321428571428571

I didn't watch it however my dad loved it and still talks about this dvd today.

8097638,5,B000CCW2SO,"Yeah, I'm homesick now for the past. I miss this guy's corny jokes and the amazing women he acted so inappropriately with. These discs are a little difficult at times to get playing in my LG Blu-Ray/DVD writer/player, for some reason, but once they're playing, they're fine. The image resolution is very good, but the sound at times seems sort of washed out, making it hard to understand some of the dialogue.
