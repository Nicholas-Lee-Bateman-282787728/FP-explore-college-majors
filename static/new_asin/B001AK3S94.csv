8277904,3,B001AK3S94,"The 3 star rating for this double feature is mostly on the strength of Salvage.  It is a micro-buget film that works.  It starts off like a film that completely blurrs fantasy and reality.  Then with a plot twist worthy of M Night Shyamalan, everything falls into place.  It is almost a 4 star movie and it easily is worth 3 stars.

I will be generous and give Mortuary 2 stars but it comes close to getting only a single star.  It tries (I think) to be a mixture of comedy and horror.  But it does porly on both counts.  Tobe Hooper makes a great film every decade or so but this is not one of those.  It never explains what is happening.  No loss though, I wasn't interested anyway.",1262304000,2,684,4.1923076923076925
8277905,4,B001AK3S94,"I honestly don't recall how I stumbled across ""Salvage"" a few years ago, but perhaps I did so having low expectations for this low-budget horror flick and that helped me love it. This isn't a Hollywood effects bonanza stuffed full of impossibly pretty stars saying the same stupid lines from every previous gore-fest. It's a small budget flick with an unknown cast shot in just a few locations on dreary, overcast days. No machine guns, no car chases, no too-cool ""Yippie-kai-ay, motherf***ker"" lines. This isn't ""SAW 14"". It's about a pretty girl-next-door and a murderous maniac, and her attempts to stop reliving a personal Hell. But you must go in granting the makers a bit of leeway for the few amateurisms that pop up here and there. It's about the girl's predicament and the various attempts to make the horror stop, not about seller posters and T-shirts. If you give it just a little bit of wiggle room, and you invest yourself in her situation, you'll be rewarded with a killer of a surprise ending to make you cheer for small films with big ideas. Worst case, you'll always have ""Transformers 2"" to clear your mental palette afterwards.",1261785600,4,1146,4.792929292929293
8277906,4,B001AK3S94,"I actually kind of liked Salvage as it had quite clever twist to it in the end.

Mortuary was the scarier of the two (though not very memorable) - it got a little silly in the end - but nothing that would ruin the experience.

The quality wasn't probably the best of blu-ray (feels like DVD copied to BD disc) - but nothing really to complain about either.

The only complaint I have about those double-feature deals is that there is no option for subtitles/other languages",1252022400,7,473,4.476744186046512
8277907,1,B001AK3S94,"The image is of very poor quality, even though these are blu ray discs , a problem that it's not so uncommon as you can imagine/think.",1249776000,3,134,4.1923076923076925
