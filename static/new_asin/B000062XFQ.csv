When this is revealed to them and the audience, the story progresses into a tense search for a vulnerable captive, surprisingly discarded by her lover. Why hasn't this film been promoted?",1077494400,4,364,5.7592592592592595
7957984,2,B000062XFQ,"Midnight Fly was promoted as Anita Mui's first effort with  English; too bad she didn't speak up. What is audible is how uncomfortable Mui is speaking the language, so why use it at all? I was excited about the pairing of Mui and Simon Yam but this film was a waste of two wonderful talents. I'll give five stars photography, but as a thriller in the traidition of Hitchcock -- the master would have been offended.",1023580800,,414,4.447368421052632
