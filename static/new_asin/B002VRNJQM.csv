4001575,2,B002VRNJQM,"I don't like the references in the movie that relate to drugs, sex, and black magic.  I wish I would have known before buying, opening, and watching it.  I don't think that Charles Lutwidge Dodgson [a.k.a. - Lewis Carroll], being a Christian, would approve.",1274140800,,257,4.818181818181818
4001576,1,B002VRNJQM,"I have seen several good documentaries about the life of Lewis Carroll; this is not one of them, because it is filled with misinformation. For one example, every time the narrator discusses the family of Alice Liddell, a picture is shown of Carroll with the wife and children of George MacDonald, another Victorian author. Clearly very little research on Carroll himself went into this project, because it spends a lot of time focusing on assumptions that were made about the author long after he died. Also, a lot of time is spent trying to prove that Carroll had a tenuous grasp on reality, and this is treated as though it is a good thing. If you want a documentary with poor computer graphics and a lot of time spent off topic, this would be a great DVD. But if you actually want to learn something about Lewis Carroll, I recommend that you keep looking.",1271721600,9,858,4.577922077922078
4001577,4,B002VRNJQM,"This documentary provided an in-depth and fascinating look into the world of one of the most imaginative writers in literary history. I, like most people, have been a fan of ""Alice in Wonderland"" since I was a child and I found this biographical film to be quite interesting. Learning about Lewis Carroll provides fascinating insight into the experiences and inspirations behind his masterpiece. I was already aware of some of the facts about his life including rumors of his drug use. His relationship with the real Alice was also explored in the book ""Lives of the Muses"" by Francine prose. The speculation surrounding his belonging to secret societies was not something I had previously heard about so that was interesting. The photos shown throughout also provided a rare glimpse into the Victorian era, as well as his personal life. I do agree the little girl featured in the film was unnecessary and a bit distracting but all in all I believe anyone interested in learning more about ""Alice in Wonderland"" or the author, who brought it to life, will benefit from watching this documentary.",1271203200,,1095,4.956521739130435
4001578,4,B002VRNJQM,"There are few of us who haven't read or at least seen Alice in Wonderland, whether the Disney animated version or the more recent Tim Burton film.  This DVD is a documentary that covers Lewis Carroll's life and times.  The filmmaker speculates on Mr. Carroll's drug habits, his fascination with young girls and his hobby of photographing nude children.  It also seems that he had a close relationship--maybe too close--with his muse, Alice Little, who was only 11 years old.

The narrator also discusses Lewis Carrol's epilepsy and how the strange things the author incorporated into his book may have come from hallucinations during seizures. I also wonder if some may have been drug induced!  Some of the graphics aren't that great, but there are many wonderful historical photos, and original illustrations by John Tenniel.

Whenever I watch a movie or documentary I hope to walk away having gained something.  After viewing this DVD my mind is still whirling with all I learned about Lewis Carroll, his life, and times.",1270080000,2,1023,4.982352941176471
4001579,3,B002VRNJQM,"Like many geniuses of his time, Lewis Caroll is for us today just as fascinating as he is mysterious. This documentary provides a great introduction to the man and the myths, as well as painting a wide canvas as to the influence behind his most famous work and possible explanations, from religion to spiritualism and psychology. Since very little ""videos"" of the era can be found (obviously), the filmmakers make creative and ingenious use of graphics, photographs and created footage to turn this presentation into an interesting watch.

For all its glitter though, the film lacks in research as no source is presented, like historical societies, academic expert studies or such; the expose feels like it was written out of information found on Wikipedia. Still, it provides a great introduction to a very interesting man while offering a view very few uninitiated would suspect; an interesting portrait of what could've happened to cultivate such an enduring and cherished work of fiction as Alice in Wonderland.",1269820800,2,1015,5.151515151515151
4001580,3,B002VRNJQM,"With the reemergence of Alice in Wonderland with Tim Burton's new film, this is the exact right time for this kind of documentary. It really is a well thought out and well written film. If you have ever read either Alice in Wonderland or Through The Looking Glass, this will definitely intrigue you. You will learn about the many theories of inspiration for everything from Alice, to the intriguing characters placed throughout the book. Though a lot of what is placed in this book is theoretical, it is excellently researched and hypothesized. The only thing I don't like is the use of the actress whom is playing the part of Alice in this film. Everything else seems purposeful but she seems slightly out of place. Other than that, this is a great piece that will make you seriously think about, Alice, Lewis and even the state of your own mind.",1269475200,2,847,4.653333333333333
4001581,1,B002VRNJQM,"Worse than just a boring, repetitive ripoff off old biographies, this film ""stars"" the director's daughter mugging for the camera over and over. The director's own bias towards the mystical warps Lewis Carroll into some chemical character. The most awful part here is the terribly Photoshopped picture of Lewis Carroll embracing and kissing Alice Liddell !? This is shown maybe 10 times throughout the film. If there is a Liddell or Dodgson estate extant, they should sue.

Please, I threw away 20 bucks for this trash. I hope I can prevent someone else from doing the same. Use the cash to buy one of the fine Lewis Carroll biographies available.",1269129600,26,647,4.881818181818182
4001582,4,B002VRNJQM,"A little patience with slow pacing and repetitive music soundtrack will reward the viewer with a wealth of little-known biographical background about Lewis Carroll and the genesis of his inspiration for Alice In Wonderland. The filmmaker takes on some of the recent ""scandalous"" revelations about Carroll's relationship with eleven-year-old muse Alice Little, and places them in the context of the Victorian era, thereby defusing much of the sensationalism. A portrait is painted of a shy, serious and brilliant loner who struggled for expression of his unusual ideas and was perhaps after all trying to exorcize his demons.",1268956800,2,624,5.443298969072165
4001583,4,B002VRNJQM,"If you're not a Lewis Carroll/Alice fan, this documentary may be too much, but for real lovers of Carroll's incredible imagination, or if you're new to Alice in Wonderland, this is great stuff.  There's a ten-minute silent version of Alice circa 1920 to contrast with the current Johnny Depp/Tim Burton offering, and enough historical context and conspiracy innuendo to spark imagination, discussion and investigation.  I have no idea if Lewis Carroll had an inappropriate interest in young girls, or a drug habit, or laced his books with mystical, religious propaganda (I think probably none of the above) but it's still interesting to speculate.  John Tenniel's original illustrations from the book are a highlight too.",1268784000,5,721,5.307017543859649
8382487,3,B002VRNJQM,"I can understand that most of these ""biographies"" are the opinions of the director. You could tell this fella is very passionate about his work but listening to the monotinous drone of the dialog left a lot to be desired. At the end, we see the director giving a candid, off camera interview about Lewis Carroll. This is much less stilted and rehersed. More natural. If he could have given the information in this fashion, and interspliced these sequences into the main feature, the dialog would have flowed much smoother and kept our interest better.

I didn't mind the low end video effects. Not sure I could have done better by myself. Which this looks like he did everything himself. ""A"" for effort.

I didn't mind the director's daughter ""mugging for the camera"". She was cute and seemed to follow direction well. But get her some better period clothing.

Less repeating of stock photos would've been good. More footage from different productions or art work (if you could afford the permissions).

I don't know if the information is accurate. He DID say things like ""It is belived"" and ""It is possible"" which insinuates an opinion. Not fact.

If you're expecting a high dollar Sony, MGM, Miramax, etc production, don't. It's a one man effort, doing something he enjoys. Taken as such, it's not bad.",1402272000,,1304,4.803571428571429
8382488,5,B002VRNJQM,Alice is loved by millions but knowing the reason Lewis wrote the stories disturbs me . It is always nice to see others play out the story so one can compare the actors in the rolls.,1400284800,,182,4.083333333333333
8382489,1,B002VRNJQM,"I have real trouble when every other phrase in a ""documentary"" sounds like ""uncertain,"" ""not known,"", or ""lost to history."" And when half the phrases between those start with ""could have."" Given a bit more hard historical support, I could have gone along for the ride, keeping a straight face most of the time. But, as with IDers and climate deniers, this director leaps on every gap in the historical record to fill it with conjecture, and pounds against every edifice of evidence, asserting that their remaining trace of uncertaintly carries equal weight with his bizarre and loosely-founded certainties, no matter how far-fetched. You know, the ""if they're 5% unsure then it proves my hypothesis"" kind of thinking.

Perhaps Dodgson had some neurological disorder - a logician's approach to illogic hardly proves that. And perhaps he was exposed to some philosophical arcana, as were all the other educated people of the time. That doesn't prove that ""Alice"" was an encrypted guide to enlightenment, sharable only through certain herbs and fungi. And yes, his photo penchant can be interpreted in a modernist and degrading way, or in the Victorian ideal of childhood purity and innocence. I find that a false dichotomy. I enjoy modern (and adult) figure photography both as artistic statements, and also as the target sought by my male role in furthering our species. I can do both at once. This doesn't prove Dodgson did hold such diverse thoughts in mind at the same time. But it seems strange to insist he could not.

A smattering of facts (which other reviewers rightly call into question), a tablespoon of historical uncertainty, and a bucket of conjecture carefully concocted to support the unprovable, wrapped in video imagery that serves little to no purpose. As documentary, I give this negative points. A lot of people, having seen this, would come away less well-informed than when they started. I mostly found it droll.

8382492,5,B002VRNJQM,I've read Alice in Wonderland and seen several movie adaptations so I naturally was curious to know more about how these strange and wonderful characters were dreamt up. This video provides a great deal of insight into Carroll's personal life and inspiration. Some would say he was a strange ranger. I would call him a true genius,1368835200,,330,4.807017543859649
8382493,5,B002VRNJQM,Wow. Lewis Carroll was a strange ranger. I had no idea until watching this video. There is a great deal of background information and in depth info here. I recommend it for Alice fans.,1367539200,,184,4.4411764705882355
8382494,4,B002VRNJQM,Lewis Carroll is an icon and this does his life and story justice. It was great to learn more about this genius of an author.,1358121600,,125,4.04
8382495,4,B002VRNJQM,"This DVD was a very in-depth look at the very real ""wonderland"" that was Carroll's mind.  The Alice work is obviously so laden with deeper meanings, and this DVD does much to explain various interpretations of what those meanings may have been to Carroll.  Worth it.",1357084800,,266,4.760869565217392
8382496,4,B002VRNJQM,"""The Initiation of Alice in Wonderland: The Looking Glass of Lewis Carroll"" offers a brief--but detailed--examination of an author who has been both celebrated and reviled (scandal follows Lewis Carroll even today, unproven but no less damaging). Through the course of the film, viewers are treated to the wild and the sensible; both of which were features of Carroll's work.

Inspecting the pages of ""Alice In Wonderland"", the film finds new meanings to old favorites. Words are linked to secret societies, religious fanaticism and more. Carroll is presented as a complicated individual, torn between faith and questions. He is a social oddity, too brilliant for the masses and too shy for even acquaintances. His comfort, the film assures, comes only from his work... and the relationship he forms with the Liddell family; specifically the youngest daughter Alice.

It is this point that the film emphasis most--if only because it is the point that has followed Carroll throughout the years. Accusations of less than honorable intentions have been given often, but have never been verified. The film explains this, offering a more sympathetic portrayal; and for that it is to be recommended. Too many products prefer to sensationalize this element. The mood here is straightforward. Viewers won't be bombarded with scandal. And that's to be appreciated.

The film threatens to succumb to its own cleverness, however. Seeking to connect every detail of Wonderland to a deeper meaning, it becomes less an innovation and more an indulgence. Viewers may tire of far-reaching conspiracies (especially with no real evidence to support them). Proof will be wished for but will not be offered.

Still, ""The Initiation of Alice in Wonderland: The Looking Glass of Lewis Carroll"" is a worthwhile experience.",1277164800,,1799,5.27972027972028
