Were there ever a level 2 or 3 that went with this series?",1518480000,,183,3.717948717948718
8201120,5,B000RK1RPK,"I love the fact that both of the other reviewers indicated that this is something they always go back to, which is exactly how I feel about this series of flows. I can't remember when I bought it--years and years ago after the birth of my first child (he is 30!), and it has never gotten old. I have an extensive library of many yoga teachers and styles, but this is one I would grab in case of fire. It was the one that taught me about linking pose and breath and is beautiful in its simplicity. Thank you Kali Ray.",1430092800,,516,4.118811881188119
