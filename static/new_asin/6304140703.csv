Basically something comes from space and holds a small town at bay. You must ask why and how this could happen. Maybe you will still not get a clear answer. However it is mostly ""stay in the car scenes.""",1502668800,2,352,4.176470588235294
7870064,3,6304140703,"A ""meteor"" crashes into the California desert, near a very small town (about 20-25 people). Its blue crash debris can change its form, hardening into a crystal, or softening into a glowing goo, or even sucking people into its light.

The blue goo is a vortex to an alien dimension. People and animals get sucked in, and duplicates emerge to replace the person. If you cut the duplicate/alien, he bleeds glowing blue goo and dies. (Or at least, its duplicate body dies.)

Although this film is technically a sequel, its story is also very similar to INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS or even the low-budget TV movie, THE ALIENS ARE COMING.

The acting ranges from poor to serviceable. There's a Hothead Guy who's always snapping at everyone. Naturally, he wants to go out and dynamite that strange white mound in the desert, even though he has no idea what it is. There's also a balding tall guy who LOOKS quite the character. That's good, because there is NO character in his flat performance. I think he's supposed to look like a tough biker dude, but he sounds soft and wimpy.

The main players are Elizabeth Pena (six years after her breakthrough performance in JACOB'S LADDER) and Brian Kerwin. Pena plays a single mother, working a blue collar job to feed her son. Naturally, she and Kerwin become an item.

The set is very low budget. Mostly desert, with a few buildings. The alien vortex/other dimension is just a purplish void with tentacle like substances hanging.

This is not a great film. You know what's gonna happen. People are replaced by alien duplicates. They act stiff, because they don't understand human emotions. The good guys wander about the desert, trying to figure out ""what the hell is happening to everyone."" A handful of hotheads mount a fire and pitchfork parade at film's end, while the hero tries to communicate with the aliens.

Things just meander along, slowly, in a low-budget sort of way.

I enjoyed this film. But I suspect you really gotta love alien invasion films (and I do) to enjoy this one.",1336003200,,2030,4.730878186968838
7870065,1,6304140703,This is basically an unnecessary remake of a 1953 classic by Ray Bradbury.  This lackluster version offers nothing new or exciting; there are no real scenes of suspense and most of the performances appear phoned-in.  The special effects are cheap looking and unimpressive.  Truly a waste of time.,1088035200,,296,5.125
