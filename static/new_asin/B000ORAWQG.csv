8186439,2,B000ORAWQG,"Shari's a prized commodity 20 years after the Third World War - she's the only babe around who doesn't have radiation poisoning. So naturally all the guys want her. When the #1 bad guy gets her, he has one of his guards pull down her top to see if she's contaminated. We briefly see both boobs but the left one is mostly shadowed.

Word of warning: avoid the Digiview Ent. DVD, it's an edited version, minus her brief nudity. Yet the included trailer shows it! Weird.",1283990400,,467,4.430232558139535
8186440,4,B000ORAWQG,"Amazon's product description lists this film as ""science fiction classic,"" and one cannot argue with that assessment. Breathtaking in its scope, relentless in its action, and daring in its vision of a future gone wrong, ""Desert Warrior"" makes you wonder how it is that Hollywood can continue to ignore Lou Ferrigno's awesome presence.

The story begins with people who eat rats. But these aren't just any people, and these aren't just any rats. Well, the rats are pretty much normal I guess; but the people are infected with radiation! They have sores, and are hungry enough to eat rats (!), and have that classic 80's ""the world has gone to hell in the year 2525"" wardrobe. Clearly, the director has been influenced by the classic ""DefCon 4."" Whether or not he has taken cues from the equally great ""Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn"" or the lessor ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is debatable, but a close viewing makes you wonder.

Lou Ferrigno makes a magnificent entrance on his 3-wheeled motorcycle, accompanied by his rugged minions. Lou makes a surprising turn here as a villain, though his character evolves throughout the movie. Lou's first action is to metaphorically club the women of this post-apocalyptic hell over the head and drag them back to his beer-bellied leader for breeding. Did I mention Lou's eye patch? And his leather harness? No need to, I suppose; you've seen the movie posters *like* everywhere.

There is more to life in the Phillipines circa 2525 than clubbing women over the head, however. The women are no good for mating unless they have not been irradiated, and finding such a woman proves to be more difficult than suppressing an erection while watching ""Barbarella"" by yourself. Or watching ""One Million Years BC"" with Raquel Welch. Or watching...but I digress.
Indeed, Lou's leader, the chief of the...uhh...whatever they are's...can be heard to proclaim ""If we don't get some good food, water, and clean women soon, we're all going to die!""  What he really means is that the human race will die out if breeding is impossible, but you get the idea. In the meantime, they appear to have an abundance of canned peaches (hooray) which they open and eat with large knives, in the manliest way possible.

So ""Sweet"" Lou Ferrigno goes on walkabout, touring the Phillipines on his trike with his posse and his big muscles, looking for ""clean women."" This part of the movie reminded me of Easy Rider, if Peter Fonda had an eyepatch and couldn't talk very well, and if Jack Nicholson and Dennis Hopper had no speaking parts and carried swords and laser pistols, and were Phillipino extras. In fairness to Lou, his congenital hearing deficiency results in his Corky-esque speech; either that or his enormous traps, which stand so tall from his shoulders that sound cannot actually reach his ears. At least, that is the theory posited by a bodybuilding friend of mine.

There is more to this movie, so much more including a ""safe"" society with white jumpsuits and scientists that can't remember their lines, countless gun battles with gasoline explosions and extras flinging themselves in the air, and the most surprising ending (honestly) in cinematic history, but I really don't want to spoil it all for you. I will leave you now with a hint: look in the dollar bin at your local wal mart or dollar store, because digiview sells this movie for one cool dollar and you can't beat the trailers that come with it for such classics as ""Omega Cop.""",1195862400,7,3472,4.866328257191201
