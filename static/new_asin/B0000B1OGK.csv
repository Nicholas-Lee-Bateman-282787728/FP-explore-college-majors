Minuses: predictable situation comedy, artificial plot with little symbolic saving grace, incompetently staged revenge scene, unsuccessful attempts at imitating David Lynch's style, persistent doubts that the film's losers could survive a Finnish winter.

1909740,5,B0000B1OGK,"THE MAN WITHOUT A PAST is a wonderful, lonely, and quiet film about M, a man who has suffered amnesia after being beaten and robbed while sleeping on a public park bench in the Finnish capital of Helsinki. He does not remember his name, or know anything about his past. But instead of going on a crusade to discover his true identity, he simply goes with the flow of life. After being pronounced dead at the hospital he wakes up in a deserted industrial area near the sea and is befriended by its local inhabitants. But M soon finds that his attempts to re-enter society is strongly hindered by the fact that he doesn't remember his name. Instead of being defeated M continues to go about living his life. He eventually rents an abandoned container car and plants a small vegetable garden outside his front door. M develops a new life while leaving the old one behind.
During this film there is a lack of any type of facial expressions or emotions of the characters, even when they are speaking to each other. The dialogue is slow and serious and there is not much action involved. This is what makes THE MAN WITHOUT A PAST a truly unique film. Not many people would appreciate this film with the underlying humor and silences. There is little doubt that this is the best foreign film I've seen for some time. My only complaint about this DVD is the lack of special features. I would really enjoy listening to a director or actor commentary of this film. Regardless, this is an excellent film.",1068508800,31,1493,4.533333333333333
1909741,4,B0000B1OGK,"A man (Markku Peltola) develops nearly complete amnesia when he is beaten and left for dead shortly after arriving in Helsinki. After being nursed back to health by a poor but generous family, he must make a new life for himself without the benefit of anything to start with. His lack of identity proves to be an obstacle in this increasingly bureaucratized world. But his spirits are lifted when he meets as falls in love with a Salvation Army worker (Kati Outinen) who has helped him.

""The Man Without a Past"" is the second film in director Aki Kaurismaki's ""Finland Trilogy"". (The first was 1996's ""Drifting Clouds"".) I am not sure of the precise time in which the film is supposed to take place, but it looks like the 1950's in costumes and cars, and also in the characteristics of the film stock. The colors in ""The Man Without a Past"" look a lot like Technicolor. The recent Hollywood trend to revive old cinematographic techniques and approximate old film stocks seems to have traveled beyond the borders of the United States -or maybe it started there. And why not, as still photographers have never hesitated to use archaic methods or materials if it would give them the desired result . I'm all for it in motion pictures if it adds something to the story, and here it does. ""The Man Without a Past"" is a quiet film about mostly quiet characters, both literally and figuratively. The characters speak very little, and when they speak it is frequently in vague terms. Funny lines are always delivered completely deadpan. But I wouldn't call the film pretentious. It's as low-key as its subjects. It's just about a man rediscovering his identity and a joy for life, and finding a place for himself for a second time, at a much later point in life than we usually do these things. Many movie goers will find ""The Man Without a Past"" too uneventful, but if you'd like a quiet, almost delicate, film with a good-humored outlook, this is a good one. Finnish with English subtitles. The DVD allows you to turn the subtitles on or off, but there are no bonus features.",1066176000,8,2070,4.640326975476839
1909742,5,B0000B1OGK,"Someone called this movie ""deadpan,"" and immediately many critics latched on to that word, adding other descriptive phrases such as ""frozen Finnish treat"" and ""subversive comedy."" This is very humourous to me - as if shifting the focus of comedy from gross-out jokes and one-liners to characters and mannerisms were some kind of astounding novelty. In fact, the style of Man Without A Past, where the humour is derived from emotional depth and human behaviour, recalls any number of those old Soviet comedies, like The Irony Of Fate, or Moscow Does Not Believe In Tears, despite the numerous obvious differences. So, don't believe the critics - the movie isn't subversive, it's not frozen (quite on the contrary, it's extremely warm), it's not highly stylized, and the word ""deadpan"" doesn't fit it at all. It is, however, hilarious, poignant, and extremely appealing.
The film is carried first and foremost by the performance of its main actor, Markku Peltola, who has the kind of face that immediately engages the audience's attention and sympathy. His eyes themselves are very emotive; in the beginning of the film, it's their look of faraway sorrow, surely, that puts viewers so firmly on the character's side, and later on, the effectiveness of many scenes is derived just from the man's way of comporting himself, from the hilarious way he sits on the couch and regards the Salvation Army band, or from the serious way in which he listens to the ruined businessman without showing a trace of surprise at seeing him again, or from his very posture during the parting scene with Irma, and so on. Sometimes, his mannerisms inspire hysterical laughter, not because they are somehow inherently comical, but because his character is so appealing. In this film, laughter is the audience's way of supporting the character.
But there's no cloying sugariness here. If it wasn't for the great main characters, Kaurismaki's world would be very bleak indeed. The setting is a very severely economically depressed Finland, in which people plug up drafts with cloth, live in abandoned containers, have trouble finding food, and run the risk of being beaten to death by vicious thugs if they venture outside at night. The very first scene shows Peltola's character being the unlucky victim of such a beating; as a result, he completely loses his memory (hence the title of the movie), and ends up stumbling down to the containers and collapsing in the dirt, and the rest of the film has him rebuilding his life in this broken-down world. But despite the dangers and the poverty, there isn't a doomy or despairing air to it - the people who live in it smoke their cigarettes, nod, get by somehow, expect the worst, and don't make much of it. When Peltola's character assumes his sorrowful look, it's not the crushing sort of sorrow that might paralyze a human being, but a sober, dignified sort, where one simply wishes to reflect on things without letting them get the upper hand. Another character wears an old suit whenever he goes to ""eat out,"" which means going to a soup kitchen, and regards his attire with unmistakable satisfaction. These people might not be happy, in the way we might think of that notion, but they don't really need to be. They don't directly fight life at every turn, but, like Erich Maria Remarque's characters, they will never surrender to it.
Then there's the soundtrack, which is really rather good. There's a smattering of classical music; a few Finnish songs that sound, in style, a lot like Russian romances from the early twentieth century; and lastly, that good time rock and roll, from a few songs by a completely unknown 60s band called The Renegades, to the terrific Finnish theme song, which, in the movie, is played by the Salvation Army band after they discover the charms of three electric guitar chords and some drums. That scene, complete with Finnish lyrics, turns out to be the high of the whole movie - since we've been cheering for the character for a long time by now, his triumph (and his it is, properly) is ours, and somehow, it is contained in the very way the band's singer sings, more than in the lyrics. Closing the soundtrack is the song played over the ending credits, also performed by that band, sung in English and just as good as the other one (and the guitar line sounds a lot like something from the album Laid by the band James, but that's another matter). The line ""we'll be all right,"" in context, isn't just a line, it's the theme of the movie. People make their own happiness, ultimately, and ""M,"" having lost literally everything, right down to his own name, created far more than he ever had to lose, out of the very detritus around him. And isn't that, after all, what it really means to take life on one's own terms? And if so, could there possibly be a better way to live?
My simple conclusion: If you want to see a movie that has affection for its characters, you need to see this one, since there hasn't been and won't be another one like it for a long while.",1063152000,16,5026,4.7451428571428576

1909754,3,B0000B1OGK,"Aki Kaurismki has made a number of films celebrating the underdogs of society, but his 2002 film MIES VAILLA MENEISYTTA (""The Man Without a Past"") is his most heartwarming, and it's easy to understand why it has become one of his most successful films internationally. Like all of Kaurismki's films shot in colour it has a muted palette, and it features his trademark aesthetic of a present-day setting but where the appliances, clothes, and rock'n'roll music incongruously come right out of the 1950s.

As the film opens, the nameless protagonist (played by Markku Peltola) is hit over the head by muggers and left for dead. Escaping from a Helsinki hospital with no memory of who he is or where he comes from, he settles down among a homeless community living in shipping containers near the docks. Depicted not as winos or madmen, but as ordinary people who just got unlucky and maintain an undying hope for the future, these homeless offer the protagonist the sympathy and support that he doesn't get from state bureaucrats. While eating dinner at a soup kitchen he meets Irma (Kati Outinen), a Salvation Army worker, who becomes the film's romantic interest. Another Kaurismki regular, Sakari Kuosmanen, plays the security guard at the docks whose brusque and brutal talk is but a charming front for his real sympathy for the homeless squatters.

There is a great deal of humour here, just as in most of Kaurismki's work, but it mainly comes out of the utterly deadpan interactions between the characters. Love, hate, joy, or anger are awkward expressed in a minimum of words and facial expressions. This is an exaggeration of how the Finnish people really are, but not by much. If you've seen any prior Kaurismki film, you know what to expect, as the auteur's aesthetic is pretty unvarying from film to film, but there's enough new detail in the script to make this worthwhile.

I am, however, troubled by the politics here, namely Kaurismki's blatant attack on the Finnish welfare state. In my years of living in Finland, I never encountered cold, uncaring civil servants like Kaurismki depicts. Police and city bureaucrats are, though slighly stoic in the Finnish manner, friendly and approchable enough. As Kaurismki depicts a man reduced utterly by the uncaring State, I thought that he was hurting his own cause: Kaurismki is very much a man of the left and concerned about the working classes, plus, he holds large banks accountable for the plight of some of his characters. However, by knocking Finland's welfare state for its admitted imperfections to an international audience, he may just be playing into the hands of neo-liberal forces who would be happy to do away with that safety net entirely.",1239667200,3,2713,4.9451754385964914
1909755,5,B0000B1OGK,"I've watched this three times now, and throughly enjoyed all three viewings, finding this film to really be a unique one. It's a Finnish film, which is unusual to start with, at least here in the U.S. because we don't see too many films from Finland. It's a black comedy, meaning deadpan looks with subtle comedic lines.

The main actor, Markuu Peltola, is perfect for this movie with one of the most deadpan faces you'll ever see. He is amazing to watch and Kati Outinen, as his love interest, is similarly strange and fascinating. Part of their charm are their unusual looks. This is not a romance between people who look like your normal handsome film stars.

Simply, this is just something very different from anything you've seen. It's a combination of drama, comedy and romance with some of the strangest dialog I've ever heard on film.

If you appreciate dry humor and a bizarre but touching story, you should see this.",1237420800,,926,4.703703703703703
1909756,4,B0000B1OGK,"I have never knowingly been aquainted with a Finn but I have known a Basque.  Those two cultures are known for various attributes but stoicism is a trait they share and one that stands out because it is so unique.  I had to keep reminding myself of that while watching ""The Man Without a Past"".  I realize that there is an element (intentional or otherwise) of ""black humor"" in this film but I fought the tendency to jusge it as black humor because it said so much more just taking it straight.  Emotions aside (is that the National Motto of Finland?) what takes place in ""The Man Without a Past"" says a lot about many things.  I was reminded of the first half of B. Traven's ""The Death Ship"" when following the trials and tribulations of a man with no name (and, naturally, no ID).  However, what touched me most was the story of a man who could rebuild his life completely from scrath with no prior memories that could influence your choices.  What would any of us be if we could restart our life at middle age.  There are many other compelling issues that are brought out by the events that take place in this film but I enjoyed not knowing what would happen next so I don't want to give anything away.  Not that there's a great big surprize at the end but the director (and writer?) Aki Kaurismaki gives us a lot to consider with the various directions his film takes.  What I took from ""The Man Without a Past"" was the concept that we are all good people who have been molded by events and surroundings.  We become so reconstructed that it seems nearly impossible to just be ourselves anymore.  ""The Man Without a Past"" hints that nonetheless it would still be nice to try.",1230336000,,1678,4.394822006472492
1909757,4,B0000B1OGK,"One of Finnish director Aki Kaurismaki's minimalist humanist-mannerist comedy dramas.

He wakes up at the hospital, with bandages round his head (a homage to James Whale's version of The Invisible Man, as some critics suggested?) and with a case of complete amnesia. He is soon called M (another homage to a 30s movie?). He goes on to live in a ramshackle house on the outskirts of Helsinki (I didn't know there was such poverty in rich Finland), working at odd jobs, meeting quirky people and trying to slowly remember his past. Among the friends he makes is a woman working for the Salvation Army (Kaurismaki's regular Kati Outinen, showing here a bit of age). The movie has a lot of the mannerisms of Kaurismaki's movies, but also its humanism. It is quirky, but compelling.

1909758,4,B0000B1OGK,"This film illustrates what I love best about being half finnish myself.  Life in Finland is slow, people are taciturn and barely able to communicate. This shows the difference of Finland from the rest of Western Society - AND Eastern society. I think the music shows the minor key tone of living in the Northern climate, where the brain slows down to a crawl and survival means staying warm and dry against the odds. Knowing Finns as I have, I can understand why this movie is funny to them. Life plays out slowly and on a wave of timing that is unique.

1909764,3,B0000B1OGK,"This is a very quirky film, and I think it would have helped if I had understood Finland better than I do.  I think there's a kind of political point to the movie that escaped me because I'm not aware of the situation in Finland that it appears to critique.

The characters are people on the margins, living a hand to mouth existence, where people are forced to live in shacks and abandoned shipping containers because there's no housing and they have little money.  TO the extent that the authorities are there, they are indifferent or hostile to people who are basically good but victims of economic and social forces beyond their control.

The main character is assaulted by a group of thugs and loses his memory.  He walks out of the hospital (?) and ends up in a desolate port area where the kindness of strangers helps him survive and start to build a marginal life for himself.

I found Finnish pop music not to my taste, and there's a lot of it in the movie -- be warned.  Of course, you may like it.  This is a very spare movie, very non-Hollywood.  I thought it was kind of slow and perhaps too spare for my taste.  But it's definitely the kind of movie you won 't immediately forget.",1140307200,4,1194,4.386363636363637
1909765,5,B0000B1OGK,"This movie reminded me quite a bit of ""Ariel,"" one of Kaurismaki's older films, and I would say that ""Ariel"" and ""The Man Without a Past"" are the best of his films that I have seen.

Here, a man is mugged and severely beaten shortly after arriving in Helsinki.  He suffers from amnesia and, without any identification, tries to survive as best he can without knowing his own name, let alone his social insurance number.  He lives in a cargo container on the Helsinki waterfront, and ends up getting a low paying job with the Salvation Army.

He falls in love with one of the Salvation Army ladies (Kati Outinen, who starred in Kaurismaki's ""The Match Factory Girl""), but things get complicated when he eventually learns his real identity.  His newfound love seems in jeopardy as he leaves Helsinki for his hometown in order to see a wife who is a stranger to him, and who may or may not be happy to see him again.

I won't spoil the films ending by telling you how things turn out - but I will highly recommend this movie!

I've noticed that some reviewers seem to think that Kaurismaki is making a negative statement about Finland's economy, and I can see why they think so: Most of the Finns you see are living in dingy apartments, cargo containers and dumpsters. But Kaurismaki's films have almost always been about the lower class/lumpen proletariat, in the same way that Eric Rohmer and Whit Stilman make films about the bourgeoisie.  In Kaurismaki's ""The Leningrad Cowboys Go to America,"" he portrayed the U.S. in the same fashion, showing mainly rundown neighborhoods and the lower strata of American society.

Finns are known for their melancholy spirit (which some blame for their high suicide rate).  It is something that one discerns from the books of Mika Waltari to the songs of Hector, as well as the films of Aki Kaurismaki.  We see it in ""The Man Without a Past,"" but I think that the real message of this film is one of hope: Even under the most adverse of living conditions, where one is without material wealth or even memories of the past, one can still find happiness in simple things like a glass of beer and a song on the jukebox, or from bigger things like the love of another.",1120608000,16,2201,4.575063613231552

Since he gets a job, he will have a love affair with a mature woman. The fight for survive in the oppressive and hostile world, loaded of so may people who lives at the edge of the society where the loneliness adopts so many behaviors and attitudes.

The Man Without a Past is a Finnish film by director Aki Kaurismaki.  Though Finland is the home of Nokia cell phones and the region about Helsinki is prosperous, this film deals mostly with folks that have fallen through the cracks of an indifferent socialist government. They live in abandoned trailers and shacks in the industrial port area with daily treks to the Salvation Army soup line.

Markku Peltola plays the welder away from home, mugged upon arriving in Helsinki.  He recovers, but his memory of whom he is is gone.  Since he has no name to give the authorities or possible employers, they want nothing to do with him.  Consequently, he falls back on the kindness of fellow hobos and the Salvation Army woman, Kati Outinen.  Their awkward romance blooms to a full-scale love affair.  The Salvation Army band, under Markku's management, they become a clunky, but successful rock venue.

Instead it is an exaggurated picture of a country that for 50 years has been balancing between East and West and landed on the West. It could easily been the other way around.

Everyone I have spoken to about this film disagree with me, but I think this film is playing with time or epochs from 1945 until now. Back and forth, back and forth, like a bottle of Kosken being passed among friends.

He plants a few potatoes, manages a small pick-up band, sticks to his job, and carefully moves forward with his odd life, still not knowing who he is. Then he happens upon a construction site and gravitates like a magnet to the welders. His obvious facility with the welding art leads to his eventual identity, but by then, who cares? You've become caught up in his successful attempts to get on with the business of living.
Great little sleeper of a movie.",1082160000,4,1034,4.50531914893617
1909771,5,B0000B1OGK,"Finally America acknowledged the undeniable talent of this prolific Finnish director, Aki Kaurismaki, by giving this film Oscar nomination (for foreign language films).  His acquired taste for droll, dead-pan humor is fmous among the fans; unfortunately some find it hard to savor the taste at first, but it will be infectious after several repeated watching.
Plus ""The Man without a Past"" is a love story, too, and a good one.  It starts with a middle-aged man at Helsinki station, where he is attacked by muggers.  He loses his memories, and wanders in the city, looking for a help.  The bureaucrats are not kind, but the people living in a deserted contanier by the port offers one, and he starts a new life.  He just has to look forward.
And he meets a lady Irma working at the Salvation Amry (Kati Outinen, Kaurismaki's muse).  She looks rigid in uptight uniform, but actually a kind of a woman who listens to rock'n'roll music at her apartment.  The man and Irma fall in love with each other -- it's Irma's first love -- and the film follows the life of them (and those of other oddball characters) very tenderly.
To explain the plot itself is almost pointless.  The charm of ""The Man without a Past"" comes to you when you realize that the apparently small things in life depicted here can be the source of happiness for the characters.  Irma and the man are both ordinary people, to whom slight things mean a lot.  And the subtle expressions of Kati Outinen perfectly conveys the sense of the blissful life even if you don't have much money.
The humor is eveywhere. with Kaurismaki's original touch.  The hospitalized man (after mugged at the station) looks exactly like an ""Invisible Man"" with bandages all over his face (a sly mataphor); ""The fierce dog"" named ""Hannibal"" is actually a lazy pup who seems to refuse to bite; the bank robber is actually a kind-hearted guy whose motive for the crime is nothing selfish.  And see the unique defence tactics of the lawyer at court.  Thus, behind the story, you notice Kauismaki insert his commentary about the Finnish society.
But the film is a life-affirming love story, and best enjoyed as such.  The ending is one of the best I have seen in love stories, and you will leave the theater quietly smiling.
Trivia: The Salvation Army manager/vocal of the band is played by Annikki Tahti, famous singer in Finland.  The song you hear at the end of the film ""Do You Remember Monrepos?"" is her hit song in 1955.",1079827200,11,2462,4.666666666666667
1909772,5,B0000B1OGK,"A man arrives to Helsinki by train and he stops by a park in order to get some rest, but he is attacked by three thugs that leave him for dead.  He is brought to a hospital where he is pronounced dead, but he struggles and returns to life.  He  leaves the hospital, but passes out again and when he wakes up he suffers from amnesia.  He finds himself powerless in his search for housing and a job, since he cannot remember his name or past.  As an outcast he moves into a large metal container by the sea outside Helsinki in order to get back on his feet.  Man Without a Past is Kaurismki's second installment in a Finnish trilogy and it displays the strong will and struggle of the Finnish people, which is also known as ""Sisu"".  It can also symbolize the hundreds of years when Finland was occupied by foreign powers such as Russia, Sweden, and Germany.  These three foreign powers can be represented as the three thugs in the film.  In the end, Man Without a Past is a warm film that offers a wonderful cinematic experience.",1074988800,5,1027,4.335078534031414
1909773,5,B0000B1OGK,"""The Man Without a Past"" is the fine sequel to ""Kauas pilvet Karkaavat""(""Drifting Clouds"").  This film deserved the Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Film for 2002(Finland).  The plot is brilliant!  It combines tragegy, hope, love, and anger beautifully.  From the moment the lead character is severely assaulted and left with amnesia, the chain of events continue to build until the end, giving the audience the added excitement the whole time.  Multiple ironic details are discovered as ""the man""(he doesn't remember his name) slowly regains his memory.  Many unexpected events occur, keeping everything interesting.  Every actor pours their heart and soul through their characters, giving the movie theme the added emotion.  Shamefully, none of them received any Oscar nominations.  ""The Man Without a Past"" is a great movie for those looking for something unique.  Many will be entertained.",1071100800,3,894,5.45985401459854

7998008,5,B0000B1OGK,"Aki Kaurismaki is considered to be one of the best filmmakers from Finland. The Man Without a Past is I wonderful film about a man who is beaten up shortly after arriving in Helsinki. He has complete amnesia. It's about him inventing a new life, as he figures out who he was.

At turns it's: deep, brooding, funny (Finns have a great sense of humor), romantic and sad. It was nominated for an Oscar for best foreign language film the year it was released. And you'll know why when you watch it. It's a gem.

One caveat: Aki Kaurismaki has a very keen social conscience. He's very concerned about Finland being a land of the haves and have nots. This film is all about the lives of the have nots, which exist in any metropolitan area. It's won't inspire you to visit Helsinki. Watch travel films for that. Helsinki is a very lovely city.",1494115200,,836,4.422077922077922

7998013,4,B0000B1OGK,"Enjoyed this movie about Finnish people. I liked listening to the language which is so unfamiliar. I think it is a story about community and discovering oneself, maybe becoming a person more open to those around them. The description sounds like there is some horrible violence but it was not graphically pictured. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously and that is part of its charm. The soundtrack is great and the actors project a lot of character.",1453507200,,456,4.858974358974359
