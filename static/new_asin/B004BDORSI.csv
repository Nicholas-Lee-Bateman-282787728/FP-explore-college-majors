8421930,2,B004BDORSI,Sound is not that great. Like a bootleg copy,1498262400,,44,4.0
8421931,1,B004BDORSI,I really tried to like this stand up but Gina Yahere is just not funny. This is the second act that I've watched of her and I'm never going to be a fan. Her accent is cool but she is a hot mess. Keep it movin people because there is absolutely nothing to see here.,1458604800,,264,3.8181818181818183
