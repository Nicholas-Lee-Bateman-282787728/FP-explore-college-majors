1884432,2,B00009M9B9,"I bought this show based on the great reviews I read on Amazon and my fondness for BBC/CBC crime shows. And I gave rave reviews for another Canadian TV cop show I recently bought called ""The Border"". But I didn't like this show much at all. The pacing was slow, the acting no better than a weak cop show you'd see late at night on cable, and the characters and cases just had no 'sizzle' in my view. The premise of this show is identical to the series that ran for 8 years on CBS, also called ""Cold Case"", starring Kethryn Morris. That is a great show but unfortunately not available on DVD and probably never will be. So I would not recommend this show to anyone who loves cop shows. Its not 'terrible', its just that their are SO many good cop series out there (The Wire, The Shield, Law & Order, to name a few)that I wouldn't waste my time watching it. I stopped after 3 episodes.",1328054400,3,883,4.230769230769231
1884433,5,B00009M9B9,"I first became award of this show when Peter Wingfield (""Highlander"") was in a season.  A listsib from Canada offered to video the show for me.  I was hooked.  Even though Wingfield left after a season + one episode I had my friend continue to record it for me for the next season.  I then found Season One on DVD and another listsib in Canada taped second season for me from a Canadian cable station in syndication.  Finally got to see most of the remaining episodes when it showed up on one of the cable stations - Sleuth, I think.  I really miss the show and don't know why Sleuth stopped showing it.",1310083200,2,603,4.292035398230088
1884434,5,B00009M9B9,"I love this show. We decided not to get cable or satellite at our 2nd home in Idaho and I found that PBS had pretty much the only intelligent viewing available.

1884445,4,B00009M9B9,"This is a rather well made police procedural that pre-dates the better known US made police procedurals in this vein.  It aired on Canadian television from 1998 to 2005.  It does not emphasise forensics, it focuses on traditional investigative methods - like many real cold cases the stories rely on the passage of time which may make people more willing to talk about what they know.  Like the original Law & Order, the personal lives of the central cast are peripheral in the early seasons.  Each episode is a case, with a few threads of an issue in continuing character's personal life playing out over a few episodes.  The first three seasons are solid television police dramas, the last two are less so.  This doesn't have the chewing of scenery seen in Cold Case (US series) or into which SVU has devolved in recent years.  Nor is it a continuing drama that sets its stories in a cop shop rather than a hospital.  This program is nearly twenty years old, but it holds up fairly well.  Rather than compare this to what has come after, consider Cold Squad in contrast to other police dramas that were being produced at about the same time.  Top of line in the mid to late 90s is Homicide:  Life on the Street.  Following close behind are the ""Lennie Brisco"" years of Law & Order.  Then we move onto such gens as Nash Bridges, Martial Law & Silk Stalkings.  My point is, there are programs that are touchstones that will be watchable 20 years after they left the air.  There are others that are best forgotten & raise the question how did that get multiple seasons.  Cold Squad is neither of these, but it is a competently made police drama that is not extremely dated.  Some episodes are quite good, others banal.  But there is no rule that you must watch every single episode.  Rather, give it the first scene, then if it doesn't capture you, move on to the next episode or program on you list.",1491091200,,1899,4.5

1884449,2,B00009M9B9,"I watched the 1st episode and couldn't get over how detached and cold I felt of what was a gruesome crime. I don't know if it is the writing or the acting that is so unemotional (or maybe it's a combination of the two), but there's something wrong with this series no matter how dated it is.",1486771200,2,291,4.12280701754386

1884454,2,B00009M9B9,So s this from 1997 or 2015????  Amazon has a history of misleading viewers into thinking what they're watching is a recent film of show!  Cold Squad is so 90's I didn't finish the first episode. The picture quality is sub-standard and the dialogue is hokey.,1469232000,2,258,4.586956521739131

1884466,3,B00009M9B9,The series is quite good but it bothers me that the female actors are perfectly made up with full makeup (model Like) . The camera does a lot of closeup shots on Ally who is very beautiful but not realistic as a working cop..

1884468,4,B00009M9B9,"The male actors are direly bad. The women carry this. The setting, Vancouver, is lovely. It was crated in 1998 so it looks a bit dated.  Came out long before CSI and Cold Case so pretty good for its time. Each story kept me interested, especially Elston, and Taggert family. The female lead is believable without being a byotch and the profiler is also interesting. Don't see buckets of gore, though they do talk about the deaths in detail. If you fancy tightly-written bare-bones TV with no frills at all, this Canadian show will help you pass the time.",1465257600,7,554,4.595959595959596

1884520,3,B00009M9B9,"This is an earlier version of the show 'cold case' with a vancouver location. Fairly bleak, bland, with disinterested actors and disingenuous acting. Very seldom do I give a copycat show more credit than the original it is based on, but in this case you are better off watching the newer show. It gets three stars because vancouver is beautiful - otherwise 1.5-2.",1446854400,4,363,4.777777777777778
1884521,3,B00009M9B9,"Since reviews were mixed, I watched the first episode to make my review.

Cold Squad (1998) is set in Vancouver and has a very bleak look. The main detective is cooperative Sgt. Ali McCormick. There is the attractive male cohort, the ambitious cop, the psychologist friend, the Asian coroner, the old-style tough cop and the dull boss (who says stuff like ""Come on, guys!""). The actors all avoid looking at the camera and seem very dull or detached. The camera movements at times are somewhat distracting, with rapid switches and odd angles.

This detective story is all business. In the first case, a recent crime is tied to a cold case. The perpetrator seems a bit obvious. The detectives, however, avoid the obvious. Once in custody,  the psychologist explains the perpetrator as the ""typical"" profile. Isn't that always the way!

The show ran for seven seasons and had a complete cast overhaul (except for the lead) for the third season.",1446768000,11,941,4.8625

1884524,4,B00009M9B9,"I quite enjoyed this series and found it more realistic than the current crop of CSI-type shows--for example the expectation of 3-4 weeks for DNA results, peeling paint in an office, and face guards in the autopsy suite.
There is a humanity in the writing about victims and their families that gives a more nuanced view of unsolved crime and its aftereffects. Best of all, it is filmed in my old home town of Vancouver, so if you don't like the show one can marvel at the scenery.
Definitely worth the time for a Prime series. Amazon--please add more seasons of this show.",1445817600,20,572,4.563106796116505
1884525,5,B00009M9B9,"Not a bad find for a prime video watch. Nice production, writing,  and real feel on the characters at work solving cold cases. The lead investigators competition is a little thick, but the show balances the dark nature of the cold cases with some positives.",1445731200,7,257,4.711111111111111
1884536,2,B00009M9B9,"I don't know if it is just me personally, but I found this show to be monotone.  From the actors who seemingly always speak in the same tone or the fact that it just seems like they say too much.  Almost like the writers want you to know everything, but failing to realize that they don't match reality.  Yes, it's just ""hollywood"", but when trying to do a show there needs to be better ""reality"" if you are trying to represent what is possible in real life.  Even the camera moves quickly from one actor to another in attempt to ""show and say"" it all.",1445644800,3,552,4.228571428571429

1884542,5,B00009M9B9,"I recently read an article about this series which contradicted my belief that this idea began with Waking the Dead.  I was fascinated by the obvious connections with Waking the Dead and, of course, Cold Case, each following parts of this original in their own way - Waking the Dead with a profiler and Cold Case with a female lead.  Cold Squad does not spend much time on flashbacks during the story, and there is a lot more discussion of and work with paper.  I have found it absorbing, not always easy to follow, it requires some concentration to follow the plot.

I love Michael Hogan. The red haired female Sargent is amazing. I was a huge fan of COLD CASE. Still am. I see some comparisons but, to me, this is another great look at crime solving. So many personalities, emotion and yes, pride. I detest that part. That is why people commit acts against others..Pride. I have paid for and viewed about 4 shows now. I am hooked! I look forward to all of them. I am not surprised there is only one season. The best shows often go under. But I am learning a lot here. Good study for a Criminology student. Hope you give it a shot too. Interesting fact!
