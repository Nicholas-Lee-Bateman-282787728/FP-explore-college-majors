7842686,4,6303273076,"This is one of the few videos made by Candice, she is a good instructor and should have made more as this is a great step routine.  The workout is a little dated but it doesn't bother me in the least.

Candice is joined by 3 other exercisers, each of them working on a different step height.  She will go over some safety pointers and then lead you through a 12 minute warm up followed by a 45 minute step routine. There are 4 segments, each one containing simple combinations and basic steps while keeping it innovative and interesting. Basic steps, turn steps, knee lifts, repeaters, over the tops, straddles are just some of the moves you will see as well with some combinations travelling around the step.  You will take a couple of perceived exertion checks and a heartrate check throughout the workout, then you do a nice cooldown and stretch.

Candice is better known for choreographing videos for other fitness personalities, it shows in this video.  It is a long routine, but enjoyable and you will know that you worked when you are finished. Too bad it is hard to find. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great routine with simple steps.",1113091200,3,1159,4.57487922705314
