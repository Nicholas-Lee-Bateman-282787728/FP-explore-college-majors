2518745,5,B000EHQ7JC,"The best thing about The Syrian Bride is that while it tells the story of one family, it also tells an even bigger story about how an entire population of people are caught in a political no-man's land in northern Israel.

At the center of both of these stories is Mona, a woman, living in the Golan Heights of Israel, who is planning to marry a Syrian, living in Syria. At issue is that 'once she crosses the border into Syria, there is no coming back' to her Druze village nor her family. The bigger issue is the fact that this all exists, and the Druze people are caught in this no-man's land.

That being said, this film is emotionally powerful, and even a non-foreign film fan will get caught in the storyline about a wedding, and about family. The acting is fantastic, the photography is superb, and I highly suggest that while this has nothing to do with My Big Fat Greek Wedding in any way at all, I kept thinking about that classic as I watched The Syrian Bride. I believe this is destined to be a classic itself....all it needs is time.",1143590400,18,1046,4.358974358974359

2518753,5,B000EHQ7JC,"The democratic State of Israel should be congratulated for allowing the filming of this award-winning movie about the difficulties faced by the Druzes, a people who live in the north of Israel, in the Golan, in an area taken by Israel during the 1967 war. Part of the Druzes live in Israel territory and part of them are in neighboring Syria. Families are separated. They are generally forbidden to cross the border to see one another and can only scream across the border, or use loud speakers, to find out about the health, births, marriages, deaths, and difficulties of family members on the other side. Many families have not been with one another in years.

 The movie depicts many conflicts created by this situation by examining an impending marriage in a single family. There are the conflicts between Syria and Israel, Druzes and Israel, and different elements among the Druzes. The conflicts created the need for ""red tape"" that protects the different interests of the Syrians and Israelis, but which affect the Druzes and complicate their lives.

 In the film, a twenty-five year old Druze woman in Israel is scheduled to marry a famous TV Syrian Druze who she never met. She is frightened because her first marriage didn't work out and she never met and doesn't know her fianc. The marriage can only take part if the woman is able to overcome the red tape and cross the border into Syria. Her family in Israel is not allowed across to participate in the marriage ceremony. Once the woman steps over the boundary line, she will be unable to return to her family.

Her father was an activist against Israel and spent some time in prison. Although he wants to at least go to the state line to see his daughter for the last time, the Israelis refuse him permission. He has a son who lives on the other side. He and the village elders are furious at another son who married a Russian woman, not of their faith. This son, who lives in the middle of Israel, drives with his wife and son, after some eight years of separation, to see his sister for the last time. His father doesn't want to talk to him. The elders say that if this son goes to the crossing, they will ostracize the entire family. Another daughter, with a teen-age child, is married to a Druze and lives in the village. This was an arranged marriage. She dislikes her husband who mistreats her because he feels he needs to show the village that he is a man who can control his wife. The daughter of this man is in love with a Druze boy in the village whose father gave information to the Israelis and he insists that she stop seeing this boy.

The Israeli border control people have been ordered to place a stamp in a person's passport who leaves Israel, including the Golan, indicating that the person is leaving Israel. While this is the general practice of all countries, the Syrian border control guard refuses to accept a passport that indicates that the Golan is part of Israel. Thus, the ""Syrian Bride"" is refused permission to enter Syria to get married. A UN official tries to resolve the matter.",1308009600,,3075,4.591985428051002
2518754,5,B000EHQ7JC,"One of the best films I've seen in many years. Not the usual western attempt for romance or tear jerking. Also shocking: I never realized the Israelis installed an iron curtain similar to that between North and South Korea separating families for decades. And that land grabbing is organized by law by the occupier.
Photography too is well done. The film proves that excellent actors exist in many countries and that some are much better than the 'over acting' (a style I don't like) stars from Hollywood. Hope to see more from this director.",1301443200,,542,4.776595744680851
2518755,1,B000EHQ7JC,"As a film it's professionally made. However, Israeli films like this one, Lemon Tree and others like James Journey to Jerusalem, Beaufort, and Waltzing With Bashir cause great damage to Israel with their negative depiction of Israelis. There are extremes on both sides, rich, poor, strong or weak, but the general tendancy of the leftist liberal Israeli filmmakers is to complain, point out what's bad about Israel, criticize rather than show us what's beautiful and positive, i.e., Israeli doctors saving the lives of hundreds of Palestinians in Israeli hospitals, Arab-Israeli students enjoying one of the highest standards of education, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, national medical insurance, benefits Jews in Arab countries never enjoyed. Rather they were persecuted, and 800,000 of them were expelled from their homes from 1948-1950. Mostly Israelis in Israeli films are seen as unsympathetic, brutal bullies abusing the ""poor victimized"" Palestinians, while the Palestinians are glorified as heroic, resisting Israeli racism, far from the truth. Whenever Israeli leftist filmmakers deal with the Palestinians they are apologetic, forgetting the thousands of Israeli civilians and soldiers (young sons & daughters of Israel) murdered and maimed by Arab wars and Palestinian terror spanning 60 years since the birth of the nation, and going back to the 1800's culminating with the slaughter of the entire unarmed Jewish population of Hebron in 1929. One must also remember that Palestinians murdered and maimed 100,000 Christians in Lebanon which provoked the Christian revenge at Sabra and Shatila that got extensive media coverage while atrocities committed by the Palestinians & Muslims were and still are covered up out of fear of offending them even following the 9/11, and Ft. Hood murders. Israelis should learn PR from the Arabs who will never, ever criticize their suicide bombers and terrorist gunmen, rather they celebrate them as great heroes and martyers, boasting about their crimes rather than expressing guilt or shame over their murder and maiming of civilians. Syrian Bride shows the Syrian-Druze as hating Israel. Why not make a film about the thousands of heroic Israeli-Druze who serve in elite Israeli combat units and love Israel and serve in the Isreali army with honor? Anyone seeing these negative Israeli films gets a distorted view of Israel and its valiant people, and I deplore not only these stupid films, but the Israel Film Center that support these ""Israel bashing"" movies. One yearns to see Israeli films return to days when Israel was represented by the lumnious and humane films i.e., I Love You Rosa, and The Policeman, or see Israeli filmmakers make films about Israelis like My Fat Greek Wedding which presented Greeks (in America) lovingly, and since Israeli-Arab Jews and Greeks have such similar cultures, one wonders why Jews cannot make such films about themselves that would endear them to the world. Israel has such a rich culture, whereas a majority of Jews in America immigrated from Eastern Europe and predominantly ""Yiddish"" culture, the majority of Jews in Israel have either been there for centuries following their return from Spain in the 14th century, or were among the Jewish refugees expelled from Arab countries and they have very colorful Sephardi/Hebrew/Arab influenced cultures that can be translated delightfully into film. It's time for Israel to start making positive films about themselves, their heroes, i.e., the great warriors who have fought to protect Israel and preserve the Jewish nation, i.e., Avi Kahalani, and other heroes like him who fought for their country with honor. The time has come to stop appeasing and kissing the asses of Arabs and uphold Israel as a heroic nation which it is for others to see, i.e, while no Arab help came to Haiti earthquake victims, a team of 222 Israeli doctors and other emergency personnel went to help rescue the Haitian people, providing them with medical and other humanitarian assistance. The UN calls Israeli war criminals for protecting themselves, but are silent when Israeli civilians are massacred. That's what we want to see Jews of Israel as heroes, not Israelis complaining, bitching and moaning about Israel. We want to see stories about the heroic saga of the Jewish Etheopians in Israel adusting to living in the 20th century, stories of heroic survivors of Palestinian terrorism rising triumphnat over losing their limbs, or losing loved ones, or the heroic rescue of Israeli students held hostage by Palestinians terrorists at Ma'alot High School. Stories to inspire rather than discourage. Heart warming American style romantic-comedies, i.e., Knocked Up, I Love You Man, passionate love stories like the aforementioned I Love You Rosa, etc.",1264118400,10,4787,5.308300395256917
2518776,5,B000EHQ7JC,"The Syrian bride is a Druze woman from the Golan Heights, (Syrian land that fell under Israeli occupation in 1967) who is getting married to a Druze man, who lives in Syria.

While getting to know the members of the bride's family, one can observe the struggle of people who are still loyal to the government of Syria but living under the authority of Israeli government. Once the movie gets to the point where she has to cross the border where the Israeli officials insist on stamping the passport as coming from Israel, and the Syrian officials insist on rejecting the stamp because the Golan Heights are Syrian land. Watching the detail that vacillate between bitter and comic, and wondering who's more stubborn, the Israelis or the Syrian, I was thrilled that the director chose to give an open ending, just like the struggle of these people.

This work witnesses the work of Israeli, Syrian, and Palestinian actors which is a great step in the process of peace (if anybody still remember it).",1251072000,,997,4.757225433526012
2518777,5,B000EHQ7JC,"I really liked this film.  Having traveled internationally, I know the difficulties associated with obtaining the correct document with the correct stamp from the correct office.  This film had the added emotional dimension of marriage and the accompanying social and family pressures.  I laughed at times; at others I cried.  I felt the anguish and frustration.  This is not a documentary, but I can imagine it happening to someone.  The film is not an action-packed thriller, but neither is it a chick flick.  It's a film for the thoughtful.",1250640000,,543,5.033707865168539
2518778,4,B000EHQ7JC,"A very balanced, sensitive, well-acted film that clearly portrays the problems faced by the Druze community on the Golan with its own culture and secretive religion being overly strident. The Druze on the Golan lived within Syria until 67 and within Israel after 67, but with family now on both sides of the border, they can't show complete loyalty to either side without creating serious problems with the other side, especially as the border isn't necessarily permanently fixed. So they remain split by the current border and can only shout at relatives on the other side. While it's possible to leave one country one country for the other, it will never be possible to return. In the movie, the Syrian Bride is to marry a man on the Syrian side whom she's never met and what should be a time of celebration becomes one of great sorrow as well as she will have to say goodbye forever to her family on the Golan.

But the film doesn't particularly condemn either the Syrians or the Israelis, just their effect on the Druze who are separate from both. The Druze are equally bedeviled by both bureaucracies.  While the father of the bride has spent time in Israeli prison for unspecified political offenses, the family has no problem hiring an Israeli to photograph the wedding celebration. Life for the family in the Golan remains heavily complicated due to the political situation, but it goes on. Not all of the problems presented in the film are political either. The film presents the family's personal problems in the community with the forbidden inter-religious marriage and the older daughter's efforts to step outside traditional women's boundaries in her relationship with her own husband. One could hardly ask for more in one film.",1224201600,5,1741,4.878378378378378
2518779,4,B000EHQ7JC,"This is a pretty interesting film about an area you don't hear a lot about in the news. It covers issues of family relationships in a society that is torn between a lot of different loyalties, and some geopolical issues between Syria and the Golan. The movie is incredibly anti-climatic. Everything seems to be building towards a problem and then the movie basically ends with the scene that's on the cover. My students enjoyed the movie but felt cheated by the ending. I suppose in an artistic sense the ending makes sense, but for entertainment purposes you might be unsatisfied. Overall though I can say this movie is worth checking out if you are interested in this part of the world.",1222992000,,688,4.694214876033058

2518781,5,B000EHQ7JC,"This movie is an amazing window into a particular Arab culture that is not shown much in the Western world. I highly recommend this movie to anyone remotely interested in the Middle East, and especially the Levantine region.",1188086400,2,224,4.921052631578948
2518782,4,B000EHQ7JC,"I agree with the Amazon.com review that says this is a film about borders and the ""absurdities of bureaucracy."" Not only that, but it is a good depiction of life for the Druze of the Golan Heights. Officially part of Israel, this peculiar people mostly claims loyalty to neighboring Syria, who lost the territory in the 1967 War but still refuses to recognize Israel's dominion over it. Obviously this makes for a tense situation between the two countries and the Druze are stuck in the middle.

The story is about a bride on the Israeli side of the border who is engaged to man (whom she has never met) on the Syrian side. The first part of the film is all about the bride's family and community and the delicate inner-workings thereof. This apparently gives the viewer a good insight into the typical life of the Druze. As an American, I of course found this society to be a bit peculiar, but I'm sure they would say the same about me. The second part of the film follows the bridal party as they try to make their way through checkpoints and border stations to meet the groom in Syria. This seemingly simple process turns out to be a bureaucratic nightmare and it drives home the reality of living in such a polarized region of the world. Again as an American I found it ridiculous that such a minor thing as a stamp could cause so much difficulty, but such is life in the Golan Heights!

Overall, this was a solid film. First-rate production quality, solid acting, and intricate yet moving storyline. There wasn't any action or anything really exciting, but it was an insightful, and seemingly true-to-life film. 'The Syrian Bride' gets PK's stamp of approval.",1187136000,7,1664,4.618243243243243
2518783,5,B000EHQ7JC,"Note: Arabic with English subtitles.

'The Syrian Bride' released in '04 is a magnificent and profound examination of the many boundaries that divide individuals, families, religious communities, political persuasions and national identities. The setting is the Golan Heights played out against the backdrop of the northern border between Israel and Syria. A community of Druze have a wedding to celebrate, the bride on the Israeli side, the groom on the Syrian side.

When the moment arrives for the bride to give up her Israeli citizenship and cross the border never to return to her homeland the myriad of difficulties that arise during her attempted crossing can be viewed on numerous of levels;

1- A fascinating political statement on the absurd and uncompromising tatics used on both sides of the border to make the crossing difficult that only worsens the attitudes of both Arab and Jew.
2- An allegorical statement on the loss of humanity and personal identity caught in the wheels of bureaucracy and national interests.
3- A symbolic image of the various types and forms of borders that divide us that can only be overcome if someone is willing to take a chance and be bold enough to take the first step towards reconcillation.

Amazing film and another superb perfomance by the lovely Hiam Abbass. My highest rating: 5 Stars!",1186790400,11,1336,5.031674208144796
2518784,5,B000EHQ7JC,"Great story. This drama is lightened with touches of humor; it's not too heavy or too light. It is very real and humane, and the characters are likable and engaging.",1176076800,2,165,4.533333333333333
2518785,5,B000EHQ7JC,"Loved this film because it really [...] me into their world on that day. It was a very intimate film.  There was no real excitement but lots of suspense in the many relationships portrayed within one fascinating family torn apart by various things yet still coming together.  There was also suspense in the family's relationships to the political states it had to live with, i.e. Israel and Syria.  Even though this story would seem about an existence Americans just can't identify with, I found it very easy to identify with.  It was like anyone's life but in higher stress.  The pressures on the family members were more, the pressures on the family unit itself was more, the pressures placed on them by their local and national governments were more.  The long climax of the film played out on the border was an experience of Orwellian red tape again MORE than an American has to deal with.  I also learned about the Druze people and the situation they live in in Israel and Syria.  There are just so many ""situations"" in that part of the world that I often feel overwhelmed when I try to research it to figure it out.  I know one shouldn't rely on fictional movies to explain reality, but this movie did a good job of taking one day and using it to open a window on life for many Druze trapped in the Golan Heights apart from their relatives in Syria. There was never a dull moment .  The acting was very good to excellent.  This is the second film I've seen with Haim Abbass who played the older sister of the bride.  I find her mesmerizing for some reason.  She's just got ""it"".  One can't explain it but one knows it when one sees it.  Your eyes immediately go to her and don't leave because you just really want to see what she does next and to try to fathom her feelings and thoughts from her very expressive face. She's just the icing on the cake in this lovely piece of gifted film making.  If you like this film, try Paradise Now which I actually preferred.",1171324800,8,1969,4.412742382271468
2518796,5,B000EHQ7JC,"Wow, is there great cinema coming out of Israel these days!  Director/co-writer Eran Riklis has come up with this masterpiece, 'Syrian Bride', which ranks right up there with the very strong list of brilliant Israeli-produced movies from the past couple of years, including 'Broken Wings', 'Time of Favor', 'Walk on Water', 'Late Marriage', 'Bonjour Monsieur Shlomi'...the list goes on.  Each of those is compelling, five-star viewing in my book.

The brilliance of 'Syrian Bride' is in its simple, straightforward depiction of a situation of almost unimaginable political, religious and societal complexity - a Druze family in the Golan Heights, neither Syrian nor Israeli (indeed, it's duly noted that on this family's passports, 'Nationality' is marked 'None'), with a soon-to-be young bride engaged to a Syrian she has never met.  The heart of the matter is this: once the young bride-to-be, Mona, crosses the border, there's no going back.  She's saying good-bye to her family forever.  But, the trick is...crossing that border.

Two small, special things to point out about Riklis' masterpiece (among many):

- The score, original music by French composer Cyril Morin.  I'm listening to it right now as I write this review (you can listen to a short loop of it at the syrianbride dot com web site).  It perfectly captures the mood of the film.

- The relationship between patriarch Makram Khoury and real-life daughter, the stunning beauty, Clara Khoury as The Bride.  There's palpable, real emotion between the two.  [In the DVD extras, Ms. Khoury relates that it wasn't hard to tear up in the emotional final scene, given that it was quite easy to envision the emotions that would well up were she to leave her 'real' father - there he was right there.]

Eagle-eyed viewers will spot Makram Khoury and 'Bride' star Hiam Abbass from their all-too-brief appearances in Steven Spielberg's 'Munich.'",1168041600,5,1903,5.136363636363637
2518797,5,B000EHQ7JC,"This 2004 Israeli film was co-written by a Palestinian with crews from various populations in Israel.  The theme is one we've seen before but that is timely, political and frustrating.  Wisely, it keeps the story simple, focusing on one particular family and the unbelievable red tape that occurs at a border crossing.

This is a story of an arranged marriage between a Druze woman and a Syrian man.

In the remote area of the Golan Heights, where the bride's family live, the Druze community is considered part of Israel by the Israelis and Syrian by the Syrians. The Druze are a distinct religious community based mostly in the Middle East who are an offshoot of Islam and influenced by other religions and philosophies, including Greek philosophy, Gnosticism and Christianity, among others. The Druze consider themselves politically an Islamic reformatory sect although they are not considered Muslims by most Muslims in the region.

It is a sad time for the bride because she knows that once she crosses the border into Syria, she will never be able to return to Israel again.  However, since her future husband is a television personality with a sizable income, it is not inconceivable to realize that the families would be able to meet for a vacation in a neutral vacation place somewhere.

The internal relationships within the bride's family seem to represent all the complex aspects of the political spectrum in Israel today.  Her father has recently been in an Israeli prison and is forbidden to attend a celebration in honor of the new Syrian president.  Her older sister has just been accepted to further her education in an Israeli university much to her husband's displeasure as he feels he is losing control of his family, especially when he discovers that his teenage daughter is sneaking around with a young man who tends to favor Israel.  One of the bride's brothers lives in Russia with his Russian wife and son and brings his family back home for the wedding.  The Russian wife, who is a doctor in Russia, has to deal with her female Druze relatives who complain about her kitchen skills.  Another brother seems a bit shady as he travels all over the world importing and exporting items which are never named.  He romances a French U.N. worker and any other woman who he meets.  The bride herself has conflicts about her future husband.  She and the filmgoers only see him as his TV personality and he seems a bit of a buffoon.

Most of the high drama happens at the border where the bride, all dressed up in her wedding dress,  is literally stopped from entering Syria because she has an Israeli stamp on her papers and the Syrian government doesn't recognize Israel.  How it all plays out is a little silly but I guess that's expected because this film is supposed to be a comedy even though I never laughed once.  The question was also never answered as to why the bride and groom want to marry each other in the first place.

I rather enjoyed this film because it was set in a part of the world which I know very little about.  I felt frustrated throughout though because of the constant red tape but that was what the intent of the film which was only 97 minutes long but still seemed to drag.  I had gotten the point long before that.

However, I do recommend this film.  It opens up an understanding about the political complexities in the Middle East in a very human way.",1166313600,5,3399,4.673949579831933
2518798,5,B000EHQ7JC,"This is a wonderful tale of a Druze woman living in the occupied Golan Heights who plans to marry a Syrian man that she has never met.  She must pass through the demilitarized zone and it is quite likely that she will never be allowed to return home again.  In fact, the wedding is only one of several threads that weave their way through this story.  This is partly a tale about the uncertainties of marriage, partly a tale of male-female relationships, partly a tale of the effect of the Israeli occupation on the indigenous Arabs, partly a tale of the political silliness between the Israelis and Syrians and how it disrupts everyone's lives, partly a tale about the conflict between the old ideas (and ways of doing things) and the new, but mostly it is a movie about family and about life.  With so many themes and threads, this movie easily could have become a muddled mess.  Everything is woven together perfectly, this is a great film in my opinion.

  The bride Mona (played by the beautiful and talented Clara Khoury) is going to marry a Syrian television celebrity that she has never met.  She was married once previously and is fearly that this marriage will be as bad and that once inside Syria, the Israelis will never allow her to return.  This is overshadowed by the unhappy married life of Mona's sister.  Mona's brother Hammed returns to the Golan Heights to attend the wedding after an eight year absense.  He has married a Russian doctor, and is considered to be an outcast by the local religious authorities.  There is also considerable tension between Hammed and his father Marwan.  Marwan loves his son, but is also under pressure by the religious authorities not to condone his son's act.  Finally, hanging over everthing is a pro-Syrian rally, supported by Marwan, to show unity with the new president of Syria, Bashar al-Assad.  Marwan spent considerable time in an Israeli prison and by the terms of his parole can't participate in such rallies.  There will be a wedding celebration on the Israeli occupied side, after which Mona will be sent across to meet her groom for the first time.  There are some complications at the border between the Israeli and Syrian authorities, and it is unclear if there will be any wedding at all.  If you want to know how it ends, watch the movie.

Overall, I found this to be an outstanding film.  The acting is superb, and the story well crafted.  This is a film about life and about family, and that life goes on even under the Israeli occupation and in spite of all the political silliness between the Syrian and Israeli government.  Highly recommended.",1163203200,7,2618,4.692982456140351
2518799,4,B000EHQ7JC,"Taking a tiny slice of family life -- the marriage of a young Druze woman to her Syrian beau -- director Eran Riklis gives us a look at life in a distant part of the world, as well as an allegory to the problems that beset it.

The complications of the wedding are seemingly insurmountable. The Golan Heights village sits in a slice of Syria that is occupied by Israel but claimed by Syria. Father was a prisoner of the Israelis. One brother, who left the village against his family's wishes to marry a foreigner, returns to an uncertain reception. Another brother is a ""businessman"" whose shady deals have made him rich. A sister has put aside her own ambitions of university for family, while her daughter dreams of college in enemy Israel. The bride, knowing that she will never see her family again, both anticipates and dreads her own wedding day. The village elders, the occupation police force, the Red Cross and the UN all add their own pressures to this almost unbearable mix of loyalties.

The film lags only once, but significantly, when the wedding party attempts to negotiate between the two military camps for the bride's passage to her future husband. This part of the tale struck me as allegorical of the mad world in which bureaucratic maneuvering and conflicting personal loyalties get in the way of human needs.

A terrific movie -- well written, impeccably acted, with a wonderful soundtrack of Arab music.  Well worth seeing, expect for the subtitles, which were often difficult to read.",1160611200,6,1508,4.788461538461538
2518800,5,B000EHQ7JC,"While open hostilities currently prevail between Israel and its neighbors, this film tells of a relatively more peaceful time in the recent past when the Golan Heights have been separated from the rest of Syria by Israeli occupation. Like the wall dividing East and West Berlin, the border fences, check points, and no man's land keep apart members of families, whose lives must now accommodate political differences and national interests originating in cities far away and played out in bureaucracies that are mindless, petty, and impersonal. Against this background, the characters in this film attempt to have a wedding in which the bride and groom come from opposite sides of the border.

While this particular boundary crossing is fraught with difficulties, the bride's family has many inner divisions of its own, between father and son, husband and wife, and father and daughter. Meanwhile, the father of the bride is repeatedly confronted by an uncompromising Israeli army officer and the village's pro-Syrian sheikhs are delivering ultimatums of their own. There is enough dramatic conflict for an Altman movie. The Syrian bride of the title eventually is revealed as the unhappily married wife of a traditionally conservative husband who wants to keep her from pursuing a professional career.

One of the best dramatically honest films I've seen in a long time. The DVD includes an informative making-of featurette, which explains something of the complexity of a multi-national film project shot in the Middle East - and at the wrong time of year. Israeli-born Palestinian actress Hiam Abbass, who plays the sister of the bride, is wonderful.",1154649600,19,1653,5.257575757575758

2518802,3,B000EHQ7JC,"THE SYRIAN BRIDE would probably best be appreciated by those who understand the intricacies of border rules and intercountry regulations that dominate the plot of this well made but a bit obtuse film.

The story takes place on the wedding day of a beautiful bride, a Druze woman in Majd Alshams, a pro-Syrian village located in the conflicted Golan heights (factions pro-Syrian and pro-Israeli live uncomfortably in Druze villages). Our bride is to marry (by  arrangement - she has never met him) a Syrian TV soap opera celebrity.  The problem arises in that this will be the last time that she sees her family as once she crosses the border into Syria accepting Syrian citizenship, she can never return to the Golan Heights to see her family. The wedding is further complicated by the return visit of her brother who has been away for 8 years having married a Russian by whom he has a son: the brother and the son are in conflict.  And to make things worse, the paperwork at the border to allow the bride to join her husband to be in the wedding is held up by political paperwork.  How all of these factors impact the bride's future is played out by the families on both sides.

The script tries to make the story seem credible but to those of us who still don't understand the intricacies of the territorial parceling of that area of the world or the traditions of Arab marriage etc, this plot seems ponderous and heavy. The actors are all excellent and there is something in each character with which we can identify.  A little background on customs before the film begins would have helped immensely as the movie itself is very well done.  Grady Harp, July 06",1152921600,8,1663,4.594594594594595
2518803,5,B000EHQ7JC,"We saw this movie at an Israeli film festival and had to own it. A lovely film about people trying to live their lives in the face of overwhelming bureaucracy--all bureaucrats the same, regardless of country or politics. Filled with both humor and pathos.",1152316800,2,255,4.818181818181818
2518804,4,B000EHQ7JC,"This deceptively modest 2004 film lingers in the memory because of the bigger sociopolitical context that Israeli director Eran Riklis provides in setting his story in the Golan Heights, an area occupied by Israel since the Six-Day War in 1967. Over the course of one day, the story revolves around an extended Druze family in the northern village of Majdal Shams where they are preparing for the wedding of youngest daughter Mona. The catch is that she has never met the groom, a distant relative who happens to be a big Syrian TV personality in Damascus. It sounds like the source of comedy hijinks, but there is a sad undertone because once married, Mona officially becomes Syrian and cannot return home to her family.

The intended couple, however, is not the focus as much as the family dynamics that become ignited by the wedding. The patriarch is Hammed, a political activist on probation, and he has two sons - Hattem, who has been cast out by the conservative religious cabal for leaving the country and marrying a Russian woman, and Marwan, who provides the comedy relief as a womanizing salesman. The glue of the family, however, is provided by eldest sister Amal, who defiantly stands up to the men in her family and wants to get her bachelor's degree in Haifa. The first hour deals mainly with the standard pre-wedding confusion, though it happens to take place on the same day that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad succeeded his father. The best part of the film is the last half-hour, which takes place entirely at a remote Israel-Syria border crossing where the bureaucratic officials from both countries refuse to cooperate with a negotiating Red Cross worker in order to allow Mona to enter Syria.

With its primarily somber tone, this is no Middle Eastern derivative of ""My Big, Fat Greek Wedding"". Rather, Riklis and co-screenwriter Suha Arraf supply genuine warmth toward the characters and bring immediacy and credibility to the personal situation at hand. The acting is solid with Hiam Abbass the cast standout as Amal. There are nice turns by Makram Khoury as Hammed, his real-life daughter Clara as Mona, Eyad Sheety as Hattem and Ashraf Barhom who steals scenes as the gap-toothed Marwan. Special mention should be made for Michael Wiesweg's expert cinematography which perfectly captures the mostly sun-baked terrain. This is a case where the 2006 DVD package from Koch Lorber is invaluable for the context it provides to the movie's story. The making-of featurette, an extensive interview with Riklis and his accompanying commentary all help considerably in understanding the political situation that both drives and reflects the wedding preparation complications. Also included is the original trailer as well as the U.S. version.",1150502400,,2759,5.061538461538461
2518805,5,B000EHQ7JC,"The Syrian Bride is one of a string of well done European-Israeli movie productions. The producers and the cast are mostly Arab Israelis. While the movie might seem to carry political connotations it is in fact a sociological masterpiece.

The setting is Majdal Shams - the biggest town of the Golan Heights - a Syrian territory which Israel occupied in 1967 and annexed in 1981. The characters are Druze, a Middle Eastern sect that endorses a peculiar religious belief borrowed mainly from Greek mythology, Hinduism and Islam.

The movie highlights the national loyalty of the Golan Druze, which has remained presumably pro-Syria. It also depicts the difficulty this community endures as it lives on different sides of a land controlled by two enemy countries: Syria and Israel.

But the movie is not only about national affiliations and living hardships. It is an emotionally powerful film that penetrates into the deep sociological makeup of the Druze community in specific and the Middle Eastern community in general.

First, the wedding of the bride, Mona, to a fianc? she never met, exposes the fragility of arranged marriages. Mona not only had to surrender to an unknown fate as she marries Talal who lives on the Syrian side, she also had to give up on all of her family and neighborhood since once she left the  Israel-occupied territory to Syria, she would never be allowed back. The scene highlights the high risks Arab brides take when they settle for arranged matches that they would never be able to give up on in the future.

But the film does not leave the question of the arranged marriages unanswered as it introduces Mona's elder sister, Amal, who had earlier settled for such an arrangement and now lives under the misery of a conventional husband with whom she does not share anything except for their two daughters.

The rigid Druze marriage system does not affect only women, however. Another sibling of Mona and Amal, Hattem, had been married to a Russian for eight years. Since he had taken up a wife from outside the community, Hatem was being cast out not only by his father, but also by the whole community. The movie cleverly depicts how Hatem's father, Hameed, was under pressure from the community's elders to boycott his son.

The film is certainly one of the best works in this regard about one of the Arab world's most undiscovered sociological aspects. The acting is great and the production is very much up to standard. I recommend you own it and add it to your library of best foreign films.",1145145600,45,2529,4.824480369515012

""The Syrian Bride"" (2004 release from Israel; 97 min.) brings the story of a family in Majdal Shams, in the Golan Heights. It is important to understand that Israel basically annexed this area from Syrian during the Six Day War in 1967, along the way physically dividing up families (similar to, say, when Korea was split up). As the movie opens, we get to know Mona from that family. She is going to marry that day to someone from Damascus. The plan is for the two to meet up at the Israeli-Syrian border, at which point Mona will not be able to return to Israel since she is assuming Syrian citizenship upon marriage. We also get to know other family members, including her older sister who is in an unhappy marriage and hopes to break out by attending university. Then there are her two brothers: one is a free spirit who is a salesman of some sort, and the other brother is returning after an 8 year stay in Russia, where he married a Russian woman (causing him to be outcast by the elders ruling Majdal Shams). Last but certainly not least is the patriarch of the family, an ideal-driven man just released from an Israeli prison and explicitly not allowed to go anywhere near the border area. Of course many complications arise but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: this movie is directed by famed Israeli director Eran Riklis, who late would also bring us other jems like ""Lemon Tree"". Second, don't feel overwhelmed in the initial 10-15 minutes by the numerous characters in the movie. This is indeed an ensemble piece, and you will get to know them all, it just takes a little time. Third, there are plenty of choice performances, none more so than Hiam Abbass, the talented Israeli-born actress (from Palestine parents). Fourth, seeing this movie at this particular time is a bit eerie, as the movie's plot, among other things, takes places around the time Syriad's current (and heavily beleaguered) president Bashar al-Assad takes over from his deceased father (in 2000). Last but certainly not least, there are some nice DVD bonus materials, the best being the 25 min. ""making of"" documentary, showcasing the many complications that arose during the filming of the movie. The 10 min. interview with Hiam Abbass is also interesting, although almost ruined by the obnoxious/ignorant interviewer from the Hamptons Film Festival.

Bottom line: ""The Syrian Bride"" is another great movie out of Israel, bringing us a poignant family drama that along the way also makes some broader points about the absurdities that come up when dealing with cross-border issues between Israel and its neighbors, in this case Syria. This movie is a MUST-SEE for anyone interested in the ongoing Israeli-Arab conflict. ""The Syrian Bride"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1392249600,,3044,4.7942857142857145

Good photography, with great landscape shots, as well as adorable close-ups of the Syrian bride...

Overall recommend this movie for those people looking for a nice Middle East romantic movie.",1388361600,,389,4.8059701492537314
