8578366,5,B00C7QD8QS,"An outstanding series that is very enjoyable and beautifully filmed. The narration was clear, informative and articulate. Australia has fantastic wildlife and this documentary series selects a particular animal and explores a unique aspect as opposed to a general overview of the species. The format is adept and keeps the viewer interested.

The ""Kangaroo Mob"" episode explores issues faced by the Eastern Grey Kangaroo population in urban Canberra. They are quite prolific and now have a population problem. There are thousands of them, and not enough food, water (persistent drought) and land to roam with encroaching housing developments. The scientists tag and track the roos and follow their day and night time patterns and behaviors. It's really fun to see their activity on the computer screens, they certainly do get around! The narration is filled with interesting facts about the various kangaroo personalities, social structure, eating, breeding, etc.

The ""Outback Pelicans"" follows a similar format and tracts a specific group of Australian pelicans, water birds, that for an unknown reason leave the seashore and fly hundreds of miles inland to the dry and super hot S Australian outback. What's fascinating is they only migrate every decade or so and only when the normally arid outback gets a massive rainfall that forms this enormous temporary lake. This unique combination serves as a prime -and pristine- breeding area for the pelicans and other birds too. I was amazed to find that this freshwater lake soon becomes a saltwater lake due to the salt in the soil. This salt water then grows brine shrimp which becomes food for pelicans and other birds. Fascinating stuff!

It's a great educational series for children and adults alike.

*Note for small children: it does show animals that died through misfortune.",1427155200,,1832,5.242320819112628

They were also very enjoyable to watch.  I love the PBS Nature series.  I have several of my favorite shows in this series on DVD.",1401926400,,275,4.551020408163265
