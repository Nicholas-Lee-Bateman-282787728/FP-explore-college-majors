7913533,5,B00000JUUF,"First this is NOT a professionally shot video. It is a friend of Moes ( Dr. Suttie)on a VHS handy cam, but the footage is AMAZING!!.It has plenty of slow motion and Moe explaining everything about his swing. This is a absolute must for any Moe fan. I wish I could have met him when he was alive but I kinda feel like i have met him now. I would wanna thank him for making me a better golfer.
I live in Australia where nobody knows anything about Moe  and when people see me on the range they think there is something wrong with me when I get in my set up but after watching my 3 wood hitting 240 yards dead straight they kind of figure I know what I am what I'm doing.
You really get to see what a jolly and fun guy Moe was. He's laughing and joking all the way through this video. Hes no where near a weird as the stories going round make him out to be. Whats amazing is this is him at 65 i can't imagine he would have been like in his prime. Thanks Moe and DR.Suttie for releasing this video.",1235952000,2,994,3.945273631840796

7913535,2,B00000JUUF,"I gave this 2 stars only because Moe is actually on the video tape. The video is the quality of a home video - which is how it was done. Mostly on a fixed tripod and some handheld shots. At times the ball was out of frame  at address. The audio was extremenly difficult to understand. The tracking  kept giving me noise at the bottom of the frame. Like I said, I had hoped  for so much more.
Initially, I thought I would return it, but at least I  have Moe on video. One day this awesome guy will pass on and at least I'll  have *some* footage.
So much more COULD have been done. I'm very  disappointed. Yet another example of someone making a quick buck off of  Moe.
I did buy the book ""The Feeling of Greatness : The Moe Norman  Story"" by Tim & Jim O'Connor. I am not all the way through that,  but it is a pretty good read. Again, I had hoped for more & better  photos in the center section.
If anyone reading this runs into a source  of good quality Moe Norman video, please email me.
My Dad & I would  consider driving to see him in person if we knew where that might be  possible.",938563200,26,1086,4.018691588785047
