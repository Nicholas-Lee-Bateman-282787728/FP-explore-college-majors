7840589,1,6303182011,"This video tape does not add any value to my putting game at all. All he says is ""Everyone puts differently, therefore there is no one single defined way and you have to feel it."" Additionally, the tape is probably only last for 30 ~ 40 minutes and most of the time are the B/W pictures of all the great playerslike Bobby Jones, Sam Snead, Jack Nicklaus and Lee Travino, but does not provide any detail explaination on why they putted so good. Since open-stance, close stance, using arms or using wrists won't make any difference as long as you are used to it. Therefore, according to the video tape, the best way to lower your putting strokes is to keep on putting on the practice green without thinking about your swing or forms.",989625600,9,731,4.462686567164179

I changed my putting grip, putter, putting stance, after 15 years of mediocer putting, after seeing this video.  Now I am a golfer who  can't wait to get to the green to putt. If your serious about improving  your putting and getting out of the ""duffer"" zone -get this  video.",960076800,12,353,4.612903225806452
