8181130,5,B000NSF3LK,"first off,it is a true pleasure to watch a real old time boatbuilder at his craft. i get the impression this man didn't take much foolishness from students,,the few ive read he may have had. your either as serious as he is,, or get out. thats the feeling i get while listening to arno speaking.

his explanations are clear and when not perfectly clear,he goes over it from a different direction.

anyways,, without going into detail,if you are the type that has to have a smallish boatbuilding library as i am,,and even if you arent,,this is one of the few items that in my opinion is mandatory.

there is also a 10dvd set out there ""the boat building"" video series. that was nearly 100$ and also a must have.

even if your a pro or semi-pro builder,,id bet anything youll learn more than a few things from the dvds.

get them,you won't be sorry.
