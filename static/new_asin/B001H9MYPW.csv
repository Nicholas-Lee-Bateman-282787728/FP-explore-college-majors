3624476,4,B001H9MYPW,"There's a deep and wide hunger for intelligent entertainment among the TV audience worldwide. It is this need that this show satisfies like no other. Still, don't forget that it is , finally, highly dramatized, in its adaptation from its foreign origin.

The acting here is superb. I am especially impressed with editing and some of this credit must flowback to HBO and the cable platform - Each scene is allowed to play out until the emotional tone has registered and setled , whereas in network TV, there would be a rush to cut to a commercial.

I give 4 stars because:
A> At times, the writing felt a bit trite, stretched and artificial;
B> Some thematic probabilities were too unrealistic -  ""Paul's ex landing up at the dooer of paul's therapist just when Paul reaches there and also the same moment when his childhood girlfriend is leaving"" ; One character's cell phone running out of battery without her awareness so that she could not say that one senetenece that she wanted; Wouldn't Paul's outbound land line have caller id blocked?; How come Paul opens the door to his aprtment -  which does not have a peephole - without checking /asking who is outside?
C> 5 star reviews would set the expectation too high and may disappoint some critical viewers.

It is a very fine collection andam recommending it heartily - still, i think that the entertainment/theater content is way more than any scientific therapy process content.",1257984000,11,1434,4.7894736842105265
3624477,5,B001H9MYPW,"The second season of ""InTreatment"" is more polished than the first season, which wanted to take on too many characters' problems. This season, Gabriel Byrne's character is living alone, separated from his wife and family and the target of a malpractice lawsuit that has him questioning his capability as a psychotherapist. He hires a lawyer, a former patient played by Hope Davis who tries to seduce him throughout this season and works on her issues of feeling inadequate without a husband and children. He also consults a college-age woman dying of cancer, a family going through a divorce and a deposed CEO whose company made defective baby formula that killed children. In his own therapy with Diane Wiest's character, he examines his own insecurities and depression rooted in his mother's suicide when he was a teenager. A lot of heavy-duty stuff that makes you think, which is an important message for today's youth.",1253750400,16,922,5.032679738562091
3624478,5,B001H9MYPW,"Wow, Season 2 is even better than the first...viewers will not be disappointed.",1250899200,2,79,5.153846153846154
3624479,5,B001H9MYPW,"I've had unipolar depression my whole adult life.  Thus, I had to get into medication and outpatient therapy for many years in my 20s.  Decades later I still must take the medication but I haven't needed therapy in a long time.  However, those early intense years of therapy were extremely helpful for the rest of my life.  This series absolutely faithfully duplicates the entire experience. Gabriel Byrne could be a real psychiatrist.  I've never seen a movie or tv shrink this faithful to the real deal. Even better, when he himself is in therapy, it is absolutely real to life that he himself is a mess when he is the patient in therapy.  The patients are diverse in age, sex, race and problems.  In short, there is something for everyone with this patient base.  I especially enjoyed the college girl with cancer who would not get treatment, Josh Mahoney (the father in FRASIER) as a CEO under fire, and the young boy with the constantly battling, divorcing parents. This season, Paul is also under siege with a malpractice suit, which was filed against him by the family of a patient who killed himself. The ends of treatment for each patient are realistic as well.  Rather than seeing the patient off to a ""happily ever after life"", which would be impossible, Paul instead sees them off to an uncertain future but one in which they probably have a better idea of who they are as individuals and what they have as strengths and weaknesses. Season 1 was excellent as well. HBO does it again.

3624480,5,B001H9MYPW,this is the first series to really show therapy in a thoughtful and reflective way. It is just a brilliant and engrossing series that anyone who has the slightest interest in this whole therapy enterprise will be gripped by. hugely sucessfull and grippping,1247788800,4,256,4.976744186046512
3624481,5,B001H9MYPW,"I'm not gonna rehash the basic premise and stars of this series; you probably know that already. I'll just say that TV shows as intelligent, literate, and adult (not to mention well-acted) as this one are few and far between, and I intend to enjoy it for however long it lasts. I didn't think Gabriel Byrne was ever gonna find a better part than ""The Usual Suspects,"" but he fits into this role like Kingsley into Gandhi or George C. Scott into Patton. And Alison Pill was robbed by not receiving an Emmy nomination for her portrayal of the grad student with cancer. I bought season 1 on DVD, and I'll be all over season 2. HIGHLY recommended.",1245888000,56,643,4.4576271186440675
3624482,5,B001H9MYPW,"In Treatment's second season continues in the ""does programming get better than this?"" fashion we became accustomed to in Season One.  The first episode has us meet up again with Dr. Paul Weston who is newly divorced in his Brooklyn apartment/office but this time around he is faced with a malpractice lawsuit from a former patient's father. We are also introduced to new patients, a female laywer whom Paul had treated 20 years prior, a college student with cancer, a preteen boy whose parent's recently divorced and a very highly ranked executive. Paul continues as a patient himself with his former therapist and mentor, Gina.  The acting is intense and Gabriel Bryne can do more with an eyebrow or a flare of one nostril than most people can do with their entire bodies and vocal chords.

If you like intelligent shows with a great deal of realism, you must watch this. I hope we see at least one more season of this remarkable show.",1243987200,53,937,4.701219512195122
3624483,5,B001H9MYPW,"As a therapist with a doctorate in psychology, I can honestly say this show rings true.  This is the hard work that goes on in therapy.  However, as much as I like it I don't understand Byrne's laisez-fare treatment attitudes toward Michael and Sophie in the lst season...they are both clearly suicidal and the ""see you next week"" approach seemed very loose to me.  Treating suicidal patients as out-patients should at least require twice a week connection.  Other than that...is he really helping anyone?",1243296000,8,505,4.976190476190476
3624484,5,B001H9MYPW,"'In Treatment: Season Two', is as riveting as season one. Gabriel Byrne, as Paul, continues as the impassioned psychologist, dealing with a new set of patients.  He sees a female college student with lymphoma, a boy whose parents are divorcing, a female attorney who he was his patient twenty years prior, and an aging company CEO .  Meanwhile, he continues to have both clinical supervision and personal counseling with Gina, Diane Wiest.

Paul struggles with many of the same issues that were difficult for him in season one - - boundaries with patients, his marriage, his relationships with his children and anger and dissatisfaction with his personal and professional life.  On top of that, he is being sued by the father of a patient from Season 1.

TV series do not get any better than this.  As a clinical social worker and marriage and family therapist, I can vouch for the authenticity of the sessions.  Therapists are human beings and 'In Treatment: Season Two' reminds the viewer of this with every episode.",1242950400,99,1018,4.883720930232558

3624510,5,B001H9MYPW,"Outstanding acting, writing and directing. Gabriel Byrne and Dianne Wiest make the tension between their characters palpable in this season, giving ineffable dimension to the relatable task of understanding one another. Young actor Aaron Grady Shaw shines particularly bright, playing a child character of incredible depth and sadness. In Treatment is one of the most enticing and moving series ever made, an accurate portrait of what the journey of self-actualization looks like for all of those who dare to ""gaze long into the abyss"".",1481328000,,536,5.392857142857143

3624516,5,B001H9MYPW,"In the middle of season 2, one of the best series I've ever watched.

It's not often that television puts so much time and effort into the very complex nature of humans. My hats off to the creators and the writers and to Mr. Byrne who is so good at playing his part (also a multifaceted person with defects and strengths) that it would be hard to imagine him as not a therapist if I saw him on the street.

3624598,5,B001H9MYPW,Byrne's performance is flawless. You never catch him acting for one second. He IS the character. Some of the other actors have false moments but he never does.

3624601,3,B001H9MYPW,"Though the stories are compelling and it is difficult not to get wrapped up in the character's drama (or in many cases, melodrama) there are many problems with this series. For starters, it is too negative. Watching people argue, yell, treat other people poorly, cry, etc. are low on the list of pleasurable activities. And there are quite a few acting performances that are incredibly awful. Though the writing is strong, I'm questioning just how valuable it is to have a series about disfunction and little else. And this type of therapy, just letting a person talk then throwing out a few judgments and criticisms, seems to be far from effective.",1462492800,,649,4.8558558558558556

3624618,3,B001H9MYPW,"I'm a big fan of the quirkiness of Hope Davis, loved her as a patient in Mumford. This is somewhat or a reprise, but without the humor. While I realize that therapists are only human, the baggage that Gabriel Byrne/Dr. Weston has in getting emotionally involved with a patient to the point of going into her bedroom really crosses the line. So it's hard to be sympathetic to the therapist. If you don't like the protagonist, hard to like the series. I'm struggling thru the Hope Davis/Mia episodes to see how it ends up, but I don't think I will watch the rest. At least it's included with Amazon Prime, instead of buying it on the iTunes Store. Haven't watched Season 1 or 3. If you want to watch a really entertaining movie about a therapist and his patients, rent/buy Mumford, written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan.",1459209600,3,820,4.585034013605442

Each client was clearly given their own voice.  Whether it was easier to identify with the therapist or with a particular client, I always wanted to know ""what happens next.""  There's plenty of drama for those who recognize the battleground of the soul can be just as treacherous as physical warfare.  We saw just enough of the family to remember this man has other relationships besides his clients, but the clients were the focus as was true of his life.

with the incomparable Gabriel Byrne as the therapist, and Dianne Wiest as his mentor and therapist - and wonderful performances from all
of the 'patients' in this season of the show.  Each of the story lines followed are moving and compelling, at times heart breaking, at times
showing the resiliency of the human spirit to move beyond old narratives and family trauma from the past. I look forward to seeing the 3rd season

the first time.  Since I am well aware of the process of psychotherapy, being a clinical psychologist myself I found myself once again doubting
the wisdom of showing the ins and outs of psychoanalytic therapy to the general public.  The language in the series is heavy and the lack
of understanding that the general public would have of the process,  without clear explanation of the key tenants of psychoanalytic concepts such
as transference and countertransference make this hard to watch.  I certainly appreciate the predicament of the therapist and all that he faces
as a person and once again I am led to believe that the professional practice of psychotherapy is very poorly portrayed in  all TV series as well
as movies.  The valuable work of systematic and careful assessment of problems, planning treatment and executing a good treatment plan are
often no where to be found and a well adjusted therapist ? No where in sight. Its really tiring.!",1448064000,,1097,4.742105263157895

There are no car chases, no fist fights, no gun battles--just gripping stories of individual clients of one psychiatrist.  This psychiatrist has his own struggles with himself as well.  He is devoted to his profession to the neglect of his wife and children.  This is a hero with clay feet and is brilliantly portrayed by Byrne.

3624867,5,B001H9MYPW,"Just when I thought it couldn't get better, it keeps getting better. Perhaps not the wisest approach, but if you watch and listen carefully this series might save you a bundle in psych fees. The patients are compelling, the writing, the acting, the direction are on a level rarely seen. Fortunately each episode is only 25 minutes, 42 minutes plus would be more than an attentive viewer might be able to take. The professionalism of the production is sensitive to the difficulty and nuances of the subjects, their problems, and the psych dialogue.
Gabriel Byrne is an actor with enormous range in the many roles he has played. In Treatment makes him dig deeper and deeper into one of the most difficult roles an actor can face. There are moments of torture and even more moments of revealed emotional truth.",1444867200,2,807,4.771428571428571

This show illustrates many of the ""boundary issues"" that therapists contend with (patients in love with their therapist; therapists in love with their patients; supervisors serving as therapists; patients needing care that parents are not providing, etc) and viewers should understand that many therapists will not cross the lines that are crossed in this show.

The interplay between the man (as he struggles with the realities of his own life) and the role of therapist he plays so well. It reminds us that life is to be managed not cured. It's all about keeping it together, no matter what happens. He does his best to be a good husband, but the wife still abandons him. He let her go, since this is what she wants. He does this in a very classy way with his dignity intact while feeling a normal sense of loss.

Sure there is some artistic license but it reminds me of very fondly of my days of seeing individuals and families in practice.  I've still got a few sessions left. I'm trying to stretch them out so I can have them to look forward to over a longer period of time. It's very difficult because they will just start up one after the other with no input from me. It's so tempting to binge watch all at once. I like them so much I watch them when I'm actually watching tv so I can be drawn in to the therapy sessions. By that I mean I usually have the tv on while I'm on the computer on doing housework, bills, art etc. but I actually watch this show. Highly recommended.",1440288000,,822,4.169811320754717

Acting and writing always convincing and involving--occasionally cutting through verisimilitude to what may pass for the human quick.

3625145,5,B001H9MYPW,"If you've ever been in therapy, you'll find In Treatment to be authentic.  Gabriel Byrne is great in the role of therapist,  and the writers definitely know the subject matter.  I was  more interested in certain patients/clients  than others.  I suspect this will be true for many viewers.  One thing I like about streaming this program is that you can choose to follow one patient at a time through the entire season.  I was fortunate enough to have a superb shrink who did therapy for many years. (Most nowadays only do meds management.).  My shrink's style was much like that of Byrne's character.  We should all be so lucky!",1437696000,,628,4.678899082568807

It is probably the best series that I've ever seen ,so beautifully directed,produced,lighted,acted & all in all  simply put i would say it's so real. Thanks AMAZON for bringing it to PRIME, THE 3  seasons. I'm a t.v producer and director .Do you happened to know why HBO only made 3 seasons? Me and a lot of friends are very interested in talking to HBO to see how likely and possible it is to produce more. We would love to co-produce at least 3 more seasons,
Do  you know  who can we talk to ,please let me know ,
Thanks again.

3625190,5,B001H9MYPW,"I believe this show is well grounded in reality. With a degree in psychology in hand I once contemplated a life as a psychotherapist. For a number of reasons I thought I would not be right for the job. This show demonstrates the intensity of thought and knowledge that scrutiny of another's life, motivations, feelings, etc requires. It takes a special kind of person to subject themselves to the temptations to tinker with human feelings then fight against that temptation. Gabriel Byrne does a fantastic job in his role as an analyst who does not deny himself his humanity while trying to help others sort out their feelings.  I'm on season three now.",1436832000,,653,4.778761061946903

3625233,4,B001H9MYPW,"A 4.25 maybe. Better than good, but nothing is perfect. I suspect that much of Byrne's dialog is ad lib. It gets predictable, but's that's the way therapists are too. Diane Weist is wonderful as is John Mahoney. Although some of the patients are less interesting than others, the plotlines are generally strong. Paul's personal story isn't compelling (a bit whiney, in fact) and his ambivalence with his supervisor doesn't make sense to me (yet). This all means I have spent time thinking about this series and that must be a good thing.",1436745600,,537,4.78494623655914
3625234,3,B001H9MYPW,"While this series provides insight into the inner worlds of diverse characters struggling with contemporary life issues, it moves a bit too slowly for me but i have willingly given of my time to experience the shifting  story-lines.

The low key lighting reinforces the strange calmness of the subjects' work",1436745600,,420,5.348484848484849

It is totally cerebral and delves into the mindsets of patients in therapy as well as the therapist treating them. It slowly unfolds the stories of everyone through the interaction of patient and therapist in one on one sessions. It has been intriguing to pay attention to my own mindset as I transition from finding patients obnoxious and irritating to sincerely rooting for them to find the peace and serenity they are seeking.  Ahhhhh the glories of binge watching - to be honest I don't know if I would have liked this show as much had I watched it from week to week.  Gabriel Byrne has mastered his role as the therapist and is brilliant, as are all the actors playing the patients.

He slips the teether of being Gabriel Byrne and seamlessly becomes Paul Weston. Dianne Wiest's performance as Gina is beautiful as well.

3625415,5,B001H9MYPW,"No action but totally absorbing.  Entertaining and enlightening.  Thoughtful and educational. Its a very realistic representation of the work of psychotherapy.  The incremental successes, the dangers to all involved, and the knowledge and skill that need to be accumulated to provide any benefit are excruciatingly acted out.  This is no soap opera or Dr. Feelgood show.  The characters are only human and we are shown their struggles to live and in turn discover paths which we may wish or need to explore.",1435276800,,507,5.134146341463414
3625416,4,B001H9MYPW,Not my favorite season,1435276800,,22,4.75
3625417,4,B001H9MYPW,"As a therapist, I appreciate how well this show was scripted. The acting is also consistently superb. Gabriel Byrne does a great job as the often beleaguered psychologist Paul Weston, and the caliber of actors cast as patients is also topnotch. Dianne Wiest, as Weston's long-standing colleague, consultant, and therapist, is outstanding. Their relationship is complex and realistic, with baggage that neither has fully relinquished. My primary criticism is how Weston, a seasoned pro, is portrayed as having such wobbly professional boundaries. This is apparent early on, when he seeks out Gina (Wiest) to address professional issues, and this arrangement morphs into a sort of couples therapy with his estranged wife. When their marriage collapses, Weston's sessions with Gina evolve into individual therapy. In the first season, he falls in love with a very borderline-y client, Laura, after she declares her love for him. In the second season he imagines that Mia, a returning client, might be the right kind of woman for him. With another client, April, who is diagnosed with cancer and refuses to tell her family or seek treatment, Weston decides it is his responsibility to get her into chemotherapy and take her to treatment when she faints in his office. There's no arguing the humanity of this character, but when it comes to ethics, he goes out on a limb repeatedly. What do you do when an adult client with a life-threatening illness passes out in your office? Simple: you dial 911. Responsibility is then shifted to emergency professionals and also back to the client, where it belongs. Having only recently discovered this show on Amazon Prime, I haven't finished watching Season 2 yet, and I haven't read any reviews. I remember vaguely when the show came out, but didn't (and still don't) have HBO. Even though it is a bit dated now, it strikes me as one of the best TV dramas of its kind, and certainly one of the most nuanced and intelligent television portrayals of the process of psychotherapy, and its impact on both client and therapist alike.",1435276800,5,2065,4.988405797101449

Starts slow but as the weeks pass, the patients lives grow ever more complicated, as does the therapist's. Seems the therapy sessions are quite realistic. If you're interested in finding what makes people tick, others and yourself, you'll probably like it. Resist writing it off if it seems slow at the beginning. Don't quit until you get to, at least, the second or third visit for each patient. These are half hour episodes so it won't take long.",1433721600,,571,4.72

Every actor excells in the nuance of what is human -- pain, anger, retribution, sorrow, disgust, disillusionment, regret, self-doubt, etc.  It is, in itself, a life lesson, especially for those viewers inclined to look inward.

Interesting plots, great acting, and the drama of a therapist who neither knows how to stay impartial without becoming a robot, nor is able to be conscious of how his therapy sessions with patients are a brilliant way to divert himself from his own personal issues, all combine to make this a riveting season.  The other brilliant dynamic is the tendency for all characters to walk right to the precipice of deep insight and then walk away (most of the time subconsciously, but deliberately).",1426032000,,574,4.846938775510204

I liked it so much that I had to buy the second and third season.  The stories are interesting, although I don't think they are too realistic.  They portray nearly every therapy session as incredibly antagonistic and the patients are often just WAY too mean.  I couldn't imagine talking to a therapist the way they disrespect his character in this program.  But it makes for entertaining TV.  Gabriel Byrne does a brilliant job with his part as the therapist.  My two complaints are this:  first, they drop the F bomb WAY too much and in places where it just isn't needed at all.

Human beings are very dynamic and complex and we carry a lot of inner turmoil and most people don't even realize what's happening in their life, or understand it, but they can recognize feeling unhappy, disconnected, and disillusioned--this is where therapy helps.

However in  part, I wonder if that is happening because Paul offers up ""interpretations"" too early, and too often, without letting the client come up with their own insights first. I feel a therapist should listen more than he talks. I realize it is fiction, but I'm really wrapped up  in the series. Gabriel Byrne does a great job of acting.",1382140800,,459,4.654320987654321

3625991,5,B001H9MYPW,"After I was blown away by season one, I waited over a year, and finally got around to watching season 2. It has seven discs, and by the end of disc 2, I thought to myself, this is very good again, but its not really as good as season 1. But then it started to build up. I just finished the last two discs, and I am blown away all over again! I blame the acting, the directing, and of course, the writing. Absolutely first-rate!

If a show about 5 different people going to see a therapist sounds intriguing, give In Treatment a serious attempt. Each character or patient takes a while to get to the meat of their story. None of them really know what to expect in therapy, and they aren't able to trust the therapist. So as he slowly wins them over, and as they share their incredible stories- This show REALLY starts to materialize.

Did I mention it is intense? If I weren't such a big macho-type-of-guy, I might have almost choked back a tear or two here! Alright- They actually got me once. Don't tell anyone! What can I say? By the end of the season, I found myself deeply identifying with every single character. Even the ones I didn't like for a while! But, the one that really got me was the 23 year-old girl who was coping with her diagnosis of cancer. Her acting and the plight of her character just really had me wanting to help her. This show is Masterpiece Theater, evolved.

Unfortunately, I doubt In Treatment will ever be as popular as it deserves to be. I can't really recommend this to my friends. I don't think they would ""get"" it. I can picture them just looking at me like I was a nerd, but I've studied psychology in college and I've used therapy to get through some of my own tough times. I've been fascinated by the profession for a long time. I've seen how well it can help untie the knots in your thoughts, like a massage can handle the knots in your muscles.

I don't understand why there aren't more excellent tv series like this - they are captivating & you feel as if you are in the doc's room with each patient.

It's difficult not to watch each dvd at one sitting, so rivetting are the performers, but one has to do other things. I've started watching Season III, and was a little sad to see (so far) that Diane Wiest is no longer Gabriel's shrink, although she is mentioned in sessions I've watched to date.

I can turn off the sound and focus on the visual patterns of non-verbal language between client and therapist, or watch one client's sessions back-to-back through the entire series, watching for client changes as the therapy progresses. At times the therapist makes mistakes, a clear statement by the creators that therapists are human, too. It's fascinating to see the therapist work with his own therapist and face his own personal demons, even as he's called on to step into his therapeutic self on behalf of clients. I have used segments of this series for training interns. I've shown some at staff meetings. Currently I am meeting with others one evening every other week to digest a week's worth of sessions. I do understand that these sessions were written for dramatic effect, but they are not too far from my experiences. I forgive the high drama because I get so much from deep analysis of the sessions. We don't often get an opportunity to look inside the sanctuary of the therapy room.

3626036,5,B001H9MYPW,"I'll still give Season Two five stars due to its unstinting excellence, but in truth this season falls slightly short of the powerful wallop delivered in Season One. Season Two is darker all around - Gabriel Byrne's Paul Weston has moved to New York City and his new environs are dark.  He's got a bleak, poorly lit apartment - the darkness seems unrelenting, a feeling made stronger by Paul's bleak mood (putting together a new single life after an ugly end-of-season breakup with wife Kate) and a roster of appallingly depressing cases: Mia (Hope Davis) and her abject, frightening loneliness; April (Allison Pill) and her untreated cancer diagnosis; Oliver (Aaron Shaw) and his warring parents; and Walter (John Mahoney), a high-powered executive whose stress and fall lead to a suicide attempt.  Not what one would describe as a barrel-full of laughs.

Season Two lacks the breakout star turn of Mia Wasikowska, whose 'Sophie' character dominated Season One.  Still, for my wife and I, young Aaron Shaw was the emotional center of the series. This middle arc (it's the third episode of each five-week rotation) was the strongest story.  It was heartbreaking to watch how the antipathy between two young parents had completely undermined this kid's confidence and place in life.  Byrne does a wonderful job in that one in nurturing a relationship with Oliver and expressing exasperation - if not outright disgust - in the actions of his parents.  As in Season One, it's the strength of Byrne's quiet - a sign of his active, aggressive listening - that is the hallmark of the show.

Like Season One, Season Two re-casts the storylines from the original Israeli production&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Treatment-Betipul-Season-2-Israeli-Tv-Series-9-DVD-English-Subtitles/dp/B004INXCY6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Treatment -Betipul Season 2- Israeli Tv Series 9 DVD English Subtitles</a>.  With Season Three, the show's producers have outlasted its inspiration and are forced to come up with original narratives.

The show is about a Therapist and follows 4 of his patients, as well as sessions that the therapist has with his own therapist/friend on a weekly basis.  The problems that are discussed in therapy are not outrageous or shocking...but rather, problems that you may have faced or know someone else who has faced them.

I thought that season one was outstanding, but season two took it to a whole other level.  Gabriel Byrne's ""Paul"" is such a complex character.  Likable when he is with his patients and someone I wanted to throttle when he was with his therapist.  It was a brilliant portrayal of the ""human-ness"" in all of us that is able to put our own problems in a box and do the right thing by others when we have to.  Each patient brought something extraordinary to the table this season.  The ""Oliver"" segment absolutely broke my heart.  Of all of the segments though, the ones between Paul and Gina were the most compelling.  Dianne Wiest was an absolute marvel.  The facial expressions were absolutely spot on and in Week 6 she really showed why she earned the Emmy that year.  O.M.G!  I sat there watching that whole episode unfold with my jaw dropped.  It was probably the most authentic thing I'd seen on television in a very long time.  I actually watched it twice! I was pleasantly surprised to see that that episode was directed by Richard Schiff of ""The West Wing"" fame.  The man, obviously, has talent behind as well as in front of the screen.

3626062,5,B001H9MYPW,"In Treatment in a show that could only exist on HBO.  The show is, for all intents and purposes, an episodic play.  Rarely do the characters leave the confines of Paul's (Gabriel Byrne) therapy room.  The show is all about characters, creating dimension to each person, be it a seemingly selfish father, a stoic corporate worker, or an unlikeable attorney.  The show strives for artistic integrity, and barely has any viewers when it airs (hence it could only be on HBO).

With regards to Season 2, the show felt more real and organic, relying less on surprising twists and connections between the multiple patients, and was more about treating the patients, as well as dealing with Paul's own demons.  If you enjoyed the first season, I can easily recommend season 2.  It makes both references to the first, and provides a better crafted season.  The show is mesmerizing, and very well acted.

3626065,5,B001H9MYPW,"I do not get HBO overseas here on the military base, and I was told you could purchase SEASON two at the local VIDEO store. I bought it and began viewing it. At first I wondered why I needed to watch someone else's pain, and normally I prefer comedies. Well, I was told it was very humorous,and upon witnessing a very burdened college student, a little boy caught in a divorce, a harried executive fired for not controlling the quality of his products, and a frustrated lawyer who was once attracted ( still is) to the therapist Paul, I found myself intently watching every thing they say and do. Perhaps, because I just finished two months of therapy from a very gifted therapist I could relate to what is taking place in those T V Sessions...it takes time.
Now, I could NOT see why our friend,the Dutch lady told us it was humorous...so I asked her. She said, ""It is because of the language they use with one another..e.g. How do you feel about that? She found that to be humourous, she insisted. Oh well, I was not laughing. When Paul absolutely could not stand April's refusal any longer to get Chemo for her cancer and ""Broke the Therapist - Client Barrier"" and took her to the hospital...I had to cry...of that fact-- that therapists are human, and have feelings, and the very nature of what they do requires, itimacy, patience understanding, kindness, and YET..the Barriers...I had such a struggle with this in my recent therapy. I have never been subjected to such inhuman rules, as these barriers are- yet my bro-in-law is working on a PHD in clinical psychology and spent considerable time in trying to make me understand WHY these barriers are in place. The acting is superb, to think how gifted actors are for their portrayals of these troubled souls, and Gabriel Berne literally transposes his very thoughts as Paul to us, the viewers..it is quite incredible piece of work. My therapy was interrupted because the therapist was reassigned to another base, and I am allowed no further contact, no picture, no emails, and I still find those rules a hazard in human relationships. But the beauty of the therapy and turning a life around outweighs any fall out from the hazard of the barriers.",1294358400,4,2201,4.675257731958763
3626066,5,B001H9MYPW,"If you're interested in the complexities of the nature of the human, you'll find this fascinating.
If you're interested in becoming a therapist, you make rethink your position.

Sometimes watching a patient dump his pain on Dr. Weston is startling; when the doctor is able to look past the obvious and see the person's problem or propensities, there's something secure-feeling about experiencing it with that person as if he's just been tended by a kind, clear-intentioned father.

After experiencing all of that with doctor and patient, we are exposed to the doctor's own problems and insecurities when he himself is undergoing therapy, making his ability to separate his own issues from his treatment of others even more remarkable.

If you've experienced therapy yourself, you will see more clearly the art involved.

Sometimes it may make you wonder whether anyone should have children.",1292198400,,890,5.246478873239437
3626067,5,B001H9MYPW,"In Treatment Season Two is a riveting series examining the lives of a psychologist and his patients as they are revealed during treatment sessions. As well as presenting intense drama, there are many areas of ambiguity over which the viewer can ponder. The acting is supurb. Gabriel Bryne in the role of the psychologist, spends much of his time listening. Yet, even without words, he can express multiple emotions with a slight change in posture or facial expression.

This is a multiple disc set. Initially, one of the discs was defective. It would not load onto our DVD player. Amazon makes it very easy  to exchange a defective product for a new one. Even for people like me without computer saavy, I was able to navigate the website, and quickly complete the transaction. The new set arrived within 2 days.",1291075200,2,811,4.785714285714286

3626071,5,B001H9MYPW,"What is it about sitting in on other people's therapy sessions that is so entirely compelling? Vouyerism, I suppose. There are five clients - six if you count the therapist - each with awful problems of the most satisfyingly grusome type. I couldn't stop watching and I couldn't stop crying for a lot of it. Sad though most of it was, and recognising most of us don't need to gratuitously add sadness to our lives, the show offers something that feels remarkably like human wisdom, making it extremely worth the emotional investment.",1289779200,6,533,4.804347826086956
3626102,5,B001H9MYPW,"I was initially concerned that In Treatment was going to be one of those shows that could not maintain the writing, acting and integrity of its first season.  Not so in this case.  Season Two is so much more intense, and Paul's character develops to such a degree that you feel as though you really know him.  I have great faith that the series will be able to continue and develop for many seasons to come.  Be prepared though: this time around, each episode is exceptionally powerful.  This is the kind of show that helps you understand not only others, but yourself....watch out!",1289606400,3,582,4.611650485436893

3626104,5,B001H9MYPW,"In Treatment Series 2 (like Series 1) is just superb!  There is only one problem which couldn't possibly bring me to give it any less than the highest possible rating.  The problem for me is that the episodes are so short, being something like 22 minutes and I register a kind of not-quite-enoughness at the end of every watching ... something like being served a highly nutritious and delicious but skimpy meal.  I understand that each episode has to fit into a 30-minute TV time slot that would also include several commercials.  And I'll watch whatever they put out in the next series, but it would be even better, in my view, if they could add several more minutes to enhance the sessions and character development a bit more. Enough is a banquet, but not quite enough is still not enough.",1289520000,8,793,4.602836879432624
3626105,5,B001H9MYPW,"I likely don't have the words to do inTreatment justice. One would think in 2010 ""therapy"", a therapeutic alliance, would be recognized as a good thing, a place to go and talk of anything...with one who knows you perhaps better than anyone (over time). There are friends, relatives, troubled, issues, disorders...who would no more seek mental-health treatment, than walk naked into a high-school reunion. inTreatment allows you to be the proverbial ""fly-on-the-wall"", having almost embarrassingly candid/intense/intimate access to people in trouble. The show allows you to see how both therapist and patient struggle to find answers, understandings, and how growth comes in 'peal-experience moments...or over a number of sessions. Gabriel Byrne is the very invested, ultimately 'spot-on' therapist/analyst, finding fascinating correlations, articulated beautifully to his patient, that raises an eyebrow, or finds them in tears. Byrnes in very human, as the series allows you to see the therapist uncertain and seeking...though he rarely falters.

In season One, and season Two, the patients are three-dimensional, and stunningly portrayed by the actors selected for the roles. Monday you see patient #1 & patient #2 in session, Tuesday patients #3 & #4. The following week, you watch all four patients continuing his/her treatment. Very clever arrangement. I've likely overdone this review, but I so enjoy each moment of the show.

inTreatment in not ""light"" viewing, and parental discretion is called for. Rather an opportunity to tune-in to a stunning look at people in emotional pain, and see them working hard to get better...and they are better for the effort. The series will either bind you to every episode, or leave you cold (if you just don't get it...smile). Highly recommended for the intuitive, empathic, introspective and feeling viewer. I own season one, now season two on DVD, and hope those who can truly appreciate the honesty this HBO production delivers, will out-number those who find the series ""boring"". :sigh: smile, HIGHLY recommended!",1289088000,11,2061,5.4576802507836994
3626106,5,B001H9MYPW,"IN TREATMENT is back for a second season, and the now divorced and living in New York psychiatrist, Dr. Paul Weston (Gabriel Byrne), is not only the defendant in a malpractice suit stemming from the death of one of his first season patients (Blair Underwood), but he also has four new people occupying his couch.  They include Mia (Hope Davis), an top attorney who Paul had treated twenty years earlier, April (Alison Pill), a college student denying the fact that she has cancer, Oliver (Aaron Shaw), caught in the middle of his parents' divorce, and Walter (John Mahoney), a successful CEO who is suffering from insomnia.  In addition, Paul continues his own therapy with Dr. Gina Toll (Dianne Weist).

This half-hour, 5 times each week series from HBO may not be for everybody, but it is certainly one of the best written, acted and directed series on television (cable or otherwise) today.

With a minimum of exceptions, the entire show is set in the offices of either Paul or Gina, as they hold their therapy sessions, thus each episode unfolds like a one-act play as the characters reveal more of their inner selves and turmoil.

There are no action sequences, no CGI, just two (sometimes three or four) people talking about themselves, their relationships and their problems, some of which are probably not too far removed from our own.  That makes for riveting drama.

I can't recommend this show too highly.

3626108,4,B001H9MYPW,"In Treatment Season 1 was a brilliant show, which offered four very intriguing, multi-faceted patients that therapist Paul Weston (Gabriel Byrne) treated. Each one was multi-layered, surprising and interesting. It helped that all the actors were superb.

Season Two still offers good acting, but some of the patients' stories aren't terribly original, and one was very annoying. The strongest, most interesting and eventually surprising patient is Walter, played to perfection by John Mahoney. But Mia - who has a history with Weston - to me was a somewhat weak and uninteresting character whose story lacked depth. Oliver, a boy whose parents are getting a divorce, was a very authentic character - but his issues and the issues of divorce were pretty standard and expected. Not unusual. They could have appeared in many other TV shows.

April, a character who has cancer but stubbornly refuses treatment, to me was a VERY annoying character who I just couldn't seem to identify with. Perhaps the actress played her too whiny. I found myself getting frustrated with her constant self-denials and refusal for treatment, and the story seemed to get bogged down. It just didn't feel right to me.

Paul's sessions with Gina remained great, and Paul's legal troubles this season also were very interesting. All in all, still a good season, but I must confess that If I were watching it again, I would just confine myself to watching Walter and avoid the others.",1287619200,4,1457,5.037344398340249

The stories are so connected and so real. I then went back and purchased the first season and learned so quickly how much the second season built off the first season. Just brilliant. October can't come soon enough for me to get my hands on the second season so I can experience them again. Now just bring on the third season.",1278720000,7,462,4.511904761904762

Will there ever be a third season, an if so, will it ever be available? Just release season 2 so we can buy it!",1276646400,4,449,4.160919540229885
3626111,5,B001H9MYPW,"I consider this to be one of the very finest examples of it's kind that I have ever been privileged to participate in, if only as a viewer.  The writing and acting is almost faultless and it's hard not to watch the whole thing in one sitting.

It is never predictable or tedious and the actors were clearly motivated to dig to profound levels within themselves to rise to the personalities of their characters.

Although familiar with much of the subject matter, I found myself constantly in awe of the truly astounding depths that the creators of the series managed to penetrate.

Although I ordered the second series more than one year ago, I remain anxiously on the waiting list.
