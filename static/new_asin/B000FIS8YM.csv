2569460,5,B000FIS8YM,Jesse Duplantis' vision of the heaven visitation is so real and true that it comforts the most painful thoughts and experiences of losing loved ones.  To know that God has saved them through Jesus Christ and to hear the descriptions of heaven makes heaven not only real but also removes the smallest of doubts.  Praise God for Jesse Duplantis' vision and the passion of his testimony!  Watching this DVD has strengthened my faith.,1268611200,9,430,4.863013698630137
2569461,5,B000FIS8YM,"I was first introduced to this account at a church service.  I experienced so much hope and joy that I wept through the 2nd half.  I fled the church after service (I usually hang around), I wept all the way home and for several hours.  I felt the presence of God so powerfully, I just longed to be with him.
I have since bought 4 copies, I never seem to get the copies I loan back!
If you ever feel tired, weary, lonely or depressed, you need to keep this handy.  It is more soothing than any sleeping pill or drink.
What a blessing this has been to many.  If you aren't touched by what you hear, then you are already D-E-A-D; and you don't need it!  It is that simple.",1204934400,,669,4.068702290076335
2569462,5,B000FIS8YM,"This is an excellent DVD to watch, and now I am wanting the book. Makes a person wish they had this experience that Jessee Duplantis had.
MUST WATCH or READ.",1184803200,8,157,4.266666666666667
2569463,5,B000FIS8YM,"I just watched the DVD... God spoke to me, and softened my heart, and I ended up crying like a baby.

My grandma experienced seeing angels before. She was dying of an untreatable disease, but an angel came in a form of little babies who were worshiping God and she saw them and was instantly healed. My grandma never read the Bible because she didn't know how to read, but she knew how to receive Jesus with a childlike heart!

Jesse shares his experience in rather childlike manner as well. I believe that what he saw was real because it made a lot of sense to me and it went alone with the Bible very well! I realized that fellowship is what's important! Through what Jessee shared, I only saw that people and angels living in Heaven constantly communicated with each other in a most lovable manner! They are filled with joy just for the fact that they're there in Heaven, and it's real, it's no joke!

People loose faith, and try to make things up to match things with science and such! So some start thinking that Heaven is symbolic, that it's not really real, etc, etc... But Heaven is real! And Jesus is real!

Some people forget that God created us in His image, and that He is real, that He's not some energy or simply light! God can be seen if allowed! He did appear to Moses, and He did take Elijah up to heaven on a chariot! Why don't we realize that it all actually happened, and God is the same always!

He also mentions that there are many children there and as a kid I always believed that if a baby does, it goes to heaven. As years went by, and my heart hardened, I stopped believing in that, and this DVD reminded me of it, that it is in fact true! So the point is, unless we keep our hearts childlike, we won't comprehend the whole glory of God, and we won't enter the heaven!

As I watched the DVDs, I felt presence of the Lord, and I felt closer to Jesus! I remembered how when I was a kid, my mom would always say, ""nick, every time you do something bad and you don't repent, it hurts Jesus"". As I grew up I stopped believing in that, but Jesse reminded me of it! Jesus actually does gets hurt every time his people go astray! Jesse reminds us that Jesus has feelings, and He loves people so much that every time there is a murder happening, or hateful words fall out of someone's mouth, Jesus cries!!

Also, we tend to think that everyone in heaven is so uptight, and serious and such, but it made a lot more sense when Jesse explained that David and Abraham were very nice and friendly! Even Jesus acted humble with him! Which is amazing! That only confirms that Jesus is truly a lamb! We can hurt Jesus, or we can love Jesus, and even though he is glorious and powerful, he is in fact a lamb, a Son of God who longs for a friendship with his people, and that's us!

We often pray, ""Jesus make me happy"", when in reality all we have to do is simply have a relationship with Him! That's the message I got from Jesse!

Another message I got from his DVDs, is that JESUS IS COMING SOON! THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER!",1177545600,31,3052,4.230240549828179

2569484,3,B000FIS8YM,"This is not the VHS I thought it would be, but it was nice to listen to all the same.  The company sent me the wrong one, and they refunded it.",1407888000,,143,3.6129032258064515
2569485,2,B000FIS8YM,"I am not a cynic of the I-visited-Heaven books, nor of their authors, but the Bible requires us to look at these things with healthy, spiritually minded critical thinking. I don't believe Jesse's story for two reasons: First, his book doesn't offer any new information or details that aren't already brought to light in other popular books. His account of his visit is like a retelling of the stories of the experiences of others. It is as if he read Seneca Sodi's book then put a lot of it into his own words. That's whose story it bears the most resemblance to. At first I was wowed by the similarities, but after sleeping on it, I thought, ""Wait a minute. This is TOO similar."" But I kept reading thinking, ""If Jesse's visit is real, God will have some material here that was individually for him."" There wasn't any. All the way from the new arrivals waiting under the trees, to the arrivals of some whose garments were not so glorious, past the people inhaling the fragrance of the leaves for healing, and all the way into the Throne Room, it is all repeated information. In Jesse's throne room chapter, he says he sees the seats of the 24 elders and they're all empty. He asks why and is informed that the elders are all elsewhere in Paradise, busy serving. This is identical to the conversation that takes place on page 151 in Sodi's Throne Room chapter written 100 years prior. When Jesse says he was transported back to the new arrivals area by way of the scenery of the mountainous regions, this exact occurrence is also on page 171 in Sodi's record. I couldn't find a single, unique detail about Heaven in the Duplantis story. He repeated Richard Sigmund's words a lot, too, ""No, we must keep going...you have an appointment.""

After finishing his book, I went to the internet to listen to him tell the story from the pulpit on a 1.5 hour video by the book's title which says it the ""FULL"" testimony. I hoped that hearing him live would change my opinion. So my second reason for personally dismissing his book as not trustworthy is that when people share from the heart about their experiences, they can tell the same story in endless different ways. Even though the facts don't change, details arise, and one's personal perspective evolves with his personal growth. To my disappointment, Jesse's verbalization of this testimony had nothing to add. Hearing it ""straight from the horse's mouth"" failed to make the story more convincing like it should have. His sermon starts out with an exact retelling of the first five chapters of the book, which are not about Heaven, in order by chapter. The rest of the sermon is a strict, almost word-for-word reiteration of his entire story as if memorized. He went to great effort to make sure he told it exactly the same, right down to the letter, with the same adjectives and the same adverbs. A Christian audience is easily duped, just like the American voter. While some may have swallowed it whole, to me it looked like he lost his audience to a large degree by about half way through the ""testimony."" Rather than being gripped with fascination, they looked like they were sighing a lot and struggling with trying to accept it as truth. If Jesse did go to Heaven, he is not excited when he preaches about it like he is when he preaches about money.

It looked obvious that Duplantis had grave concerns about contradicting himself on camera, because he never veered from the written account in the slightest, not even in the order in which it was told. Also, I noted that he had probably watched Justin Peters' criticism of his story because he kept adding ""Yahweh"" to the end of ""the Lord God Jehovah."" So which is it, the angel said Yahweh, or the angel didn't say Yahweh?

In the live testimony, He said God hurled an angel up against the wall in the throne room, but he didn't get hurt. That detail is not in the book, but is similar to a story in a well-known account that came out between the book and the live taping.

Rebecca Springer mentions an amphitheater, Sodi does, and Sigmund mentions 3 of them. So then Jesse comes up with, ""Oh yeah, and there was amphitheaters everywhere,"" with that grin that makes you like him. He mentions no amphitheaters in the book. That statement sounded stupid to me. It would be like someone from another continent seeing magazine pictures of the Statue of Liberty in New York, the replica in Las Vegas, and the replica at Alki Beach in Seattle, and then saying, ""Oh yeah...I've been to America...there's statues of liberty everywhere.""

He says Jesus' hair was white as wool, but when Jesus turned his head, it looked light brown. These are almost the exact words of Sigmund, who had his experience in 1974.

In the book, he mentions a building the angel said humans were not allowed to go inside of--again, Sigmund was on TV and radio, and making the circuit in the American South telling about that one long before Louisiana's Jesse wrote his book.

Jesse's story lacks unique detail. Many of the descriptions Duplantis gives are word for word out of the Bible and nothing more. He describes God's throne ""high and lifted up."" (Isaiah). When he gets to the wall of jasper, he describes it only with what Revelation already tells us. He says Jesus' feet looked like burnished brass (Rev 1). He described David as having reddish hair (I Sam. 16).

He goes into a house where men of God were and says, ""I can't tell you about the house because my eyes were on Paul."" Oh, come on! I've never read of a structure in Heaven that didn't wow the observer with its dazzling architecture and strange, rare beauty. He also says his own mansion was ""beautiful"" and the furniture was ""just the kind I liked,"" and it was ""the prettiest place I've ever seen."" These are not descriptions. He also says ""so beautiful,"" ""so glorious,"" ""so humble,"" ""so refreshed,"" and ""so awesome""--all meaningless without any comparatives.

He says Jesus shouted, ""I'm going to get your family! I'm bringing them back to this place to live with Me forever and ever!"" These cannot be the words of Jesus because they are not biblically true. Here Jesse is saying he went to the third heaven and was told by Jesus that it was the place where we were all going to stay for eternity. While Jesse may have forgotten that New Jerusalem is coming down to Earth, Jesus doesn't get all emotional and forget what He said. Jesse also forgot that the current third heaven, according to Isaiah 65:17, will be completely replaced (and forgotten). After the rapture we shall forever be with the Lord, but not in the place where Jesse claims he was--not forever. Jesus said Heaven is going to pass away just as surely as Earth is going to pass away, but His Word would not pass away. Here Jesse has Jesus' biblical words passing away and Heaven not passing away. II Pet. 3 says repeatedly that the current heavens are going to be burnt up and dissolved, making Jesse's claim of what he was told just plain wrong. And let us not forget that during part of our forever, Rev. 5:10 says we will be reigning not in Heaven but on the earth. Jesus is not capable of being partially correct and partly mistaken. When Jesus speaks, He doesn't forget the whole of Scripture and make little screw-ups. Since Jesse is claiming Jesus made a statement that contradicts many scriptures, we know his witness is faulty and unreliable.

Three times he says he heard babies in gowns that were already created ask if they could ""become a spirit"" (to go to Earth). If they were already created beings that could talk with the Father, wouldn't they have already been spirits, the spirit being the most basic essence of life? This didn't sound right.

He contradicts himself about Heaven's flora. In ch. 6 he says, ""The flowers were not crushed as we stepped on them. Instead, each blossom popped back up."" In ch. 9 he says of the flowers, ""You can't smash them; they go through your legs.""

When he saw children, he was told that ""all these children"" were ones that ""the earth did not want,"" upon which he specifically asked if the angel meant they were abortions. 10 to 15 billion children have probably died in the last 5000 years, and yet he was told that ALL the children he saw there were aborted babies. I know abortion is horrible, but I thought this to be typical, American minded shortsightedness. It looked like a statement made by someone heavily influenced by our axe-grinding right wing. Not a one of them had left grieving parents behind? Not a one of them had died in horrors like Sudan or Kosovo? Not a one had died of starvation on the African continent? Heaven does not have the narrowly limited, tunneled view of the world that Americans commonly display. If what Jesse says he saw is true, then there is segregated schooling in Heaven for abortive children; for the children Jesse saw were all ""being taught"" at the moment.

He says Jesus spoke the words, ""On that great Judgment Day, I will have to tell some of the creation I love to depart from Me. I dread that day. I dread it! I dread it!"" While obviously there is no delight for Jesus in delivering human beings to the judgment that sadly they have set for themselves, God's Word is not a book that says ALMOST what God means. We don't make allowances for what God says because, well, we knew what He meant. No! And the word ""dread"" encapsulates the emotions of fear, anxiety, worry, and trepidation. I personally don't believe that Jesus said that. Jesus put the ages in their order ere a man was ever created. That day was DONE in the mind of Father, Son, and Spirit before they said ""Let us make man in our image."" I don't believe the Trinity is capable of dreading any of the events they have placed in the divine timeline as the eternal purpose unfolds. You judge for yourself.

Only a disappointing 44 out of 117 pages of the book are about his ""trip"" to Heaven. Before it are stories that have nothing to do with Heaven, about the supernatural operating in his life. It seems like he works to convince the reader of a special connection with God's power before getting to the story itself. It's as if he's trying to prime the reader in hopes that they will believe. After the Heaven part of the book is sermonizing based on biblical opinions he could have without or without a vision.

The experience Jesse claims seems more like a very carefully constructed story. He appears to have painstakingly concocted an account of his own to tell, based wholly on an impression that books, sermons, and interviews have left upon him, just like they have upon me. I believe most of the information ABOUT HEAVEN in this book is true because it is borrowed from accounts that I believe to be reliable. But sadly, I believe the story Jesse is telling in first person about HIS trip to Paradise is a pretense.

Considering that all I've ever seen him get excited about or preach about at all is money, it wouldn't surprise me if he has fallen after same error as Don Lapre and Kevin Trudeau. Maybe he believed that such a writing would catapult him to fame and fortune. That is exactly what it did. ""Close Encounters"" put him on the map. This book earned him a place on the Christian radar screen and propelled him on his way as a televangelist who would become extremely wealthy.",1407110400,5,11279,4.581764122893954

Years before I had a dream of being in a crowd of people, my cousin beside me. Suddenly we were in the vehicle. Crowds but there was no agitation but harmony. As I stood in the back I could see there was a window in front, some kind of window I've never seen on earth. I wanted to see out the window and suddenly I was placed there.

The second disc in the package seems to be portions of the same thing delivered at different times and places.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone.  The quality is good and watching it the first time was a life changing experience.  I've shown it in several small group settings all with positive results.  The book by the same title is also good.",1332547200,5,534,4.5
2569512,5,B000FIS8YM,Loved the DVD of the Close Encounters of the God Kind. I have purchased a number of DVDs for friends. jesse Duplantis is very humorus. Loved hearing him share his experience of Heaven and all things that he saw in Heaven.,1318204800,,221,4.414634146341464
2569513,5,B000FIS8YM,"I was disappointed at first to see that it was just another preacher getting up and talking to me about GOD.  I can catch that on TV any day; however, once you hear what Jesse has to say and the manner in which he delivers it - with humor, love and reverence of Almighty GOD, you'll want to watch it with all your friends and family so that they too can see the wonderful things GOD has done in Jesse Duplantis' life. It is DEFINITELY NOT just another preacher talking to us about GOD!! How Awesome is our GOD??!!",1304640000,5,513,4.181818181818182

8123481,4,B000FIS8YM,"This is a good telling of what Heaven is like.  He breaks it up into smaller piece telling, rather than all at once.
Jesse Duplantis spent over 5 hours in heaven and went to the throne room.
If any one doubts heaven, let them read  I WENT TO HELL-.
