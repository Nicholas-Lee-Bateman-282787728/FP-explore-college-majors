Be careful for false review such as ""A fan"" He's obviously and evolutionist who keeps posting the same lies and two star rating on all of Dr. Hovinds products. It just shows what kind of people the evolution theory makes people to be. I guess it's ok to lie though since there's no God huh...? What a joke.. I loved Dr. Hovinds products and I know you will too.",1459728000,,409,4.324675324675325

Of course, it was not the fault of the book store.",1356048000,2,182,3.945945945945946
