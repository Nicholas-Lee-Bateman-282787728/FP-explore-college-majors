8292920,4,B001DE29Q0,"The subject matter is fascinating and never gets old.  I could watch ten more seasons.  As for Tom Cavanagh, I can't help but like the guy.  He brought levity without disrespect, and a fun, spontaneous humor.  I especially enjoyed seeing him interact with the occasionally awkward and serious-to-a-fault curators (all of whom I deeply respect, I might add).  More than once his jokes fall on deaf ears and he gets blank looks instead of laughs, which makes them even funnier.  Some of the curators are surprisingly lively.  He talks fast, but I appreciate that because he's getting as much information in as possible in a short time.  You'll love him or hate him.",1358640000,,663,4.8053097345132745
8292921,5,B001DE29Q0,"I have to say, this dvd is a really good way of understanding our history. Go beyond the artifacts and it takes you through doors and windows with a slight sense of humor. Should appeal to all age groups!",1280534400,,204,4.256410256410256
8292922,2,B001DE29Q0,"I usually don't review what I consider one- & two-star items; this DVD is an exception. For some it may be worth more stars. It is at least four-star in quality and content. But Vaults is presented with a continuous flow of sophomoric attempts at humor. The host, Tom Cavanagh, does a lot of things right. He is appropriately hands-on and asks relevant questions. The Smithsonian staff are great. If the intended audience is pre-10-year-olds, raise the number of stars to three.",1264032000,4,478,4.841463414634147
