3803812,1,B001US3XRI,"This sucked!
The WORST English dub EVER!
Crayon Shinchan is long TV series that lasted close to 12 years in Japan. Funimation did NOT purchase the entire series just a handful of episodes, so you don't see how the stories and characters developed and changed over the many seasons.

The English dub they made changed the entire dialogue and Americanized practically ALL the characters and situations to an extreme low brow humor. Granted the original show did have a lot of puns, and low brow humor as well, but Shinchan did retain an innocence for his mischief, being the focus that he was always this incredible force of fun shaped as a 5 year old boy. True fans of the manga and series should NOT buy this lame production by Funimaiton.",1307145600,3,739,4.641221374045801
3803813,4,B001US3XRI,"Shin Chan is a strange little boy. This second season is even weirder than the first. It's fun though, and the theme song gets stuck in your head.",1298246400,3,146,4.25
3803814,5,B001US3XRI,If you loved Drawn Together (American animation) and other such fare you need to have this. If you are PC sensitive this is not the anime for you.,1293753600,2,146,4.25
3803815,2,B001US3XRI,"While season 2 part 2 of ""Shin Chan"" has some funny moments, they are few and far between and most of the show consists of filler and stupid/unfunny jokes. Don't get me wrong ""Shin Chan"" is a good, funny anime but season 2 of it sucks ass. IF you wish to watch ""Shin Chan,"" watch season 1 of it instead. Skip this crap. 2.5/10",1290297600,,326,4.109375
3803816,5,B001US3XRI,"The Shin Chan show isn't for everyone, just those of us animation lovers with a twisted sense of humor. I now own both seasons, parts 1 and 2 of each, and I want more! I don't think the ratings were that high on Adult Swim, but I hope they make more. It's been a while since the 2nd season ended, so I'm not sure if there will be more, but I for one enjoyed both seasons from start to finish. Only ""The Venture Brothers"" tops this show. I am also a fan of ""Robot Chicken,"" but I bought Shin Chan first as once these DVDs go out of print, they cost a fortune to obtain. I bought ""Invader Zim"" when the series was new, and now the prices for new copies of the entire series are through the roof! So buy all the Shin Chan you can, while you can-can, then you can enjoy his ""ass dance"" whenever you want!",1285113600,,800,4.00625
3803817,5,B001US3XRI,Just bought this and it was worth it. Very very funny stuff. Now I have the complete set and I'm glad I bought this.,1281571200,,116,3.875
3803818,5,B001US3XRI,A must for Shin Chan fans! Shin Chan at his finest with his friends and family.  A great addition to any Shin Chan collection.,1253059200,,126,4.25
3803819,5,B001US3XRI,". . .although admittedly, *not* for everyone.  But if you don't mind raw humor, sex -obsessed dim fathers, long suffering mothers, nosy eccentric neighbors or dirty-minded 5 year olds (and really, what's NOT to like??) then the quick-witted, barb-flinging cast of Shin-chan will thoroughly entertain you.  The genesis of the ""reversioning"" of Shin-chan is explained in many places so I won't go into it here.  When Shin-chan first appeared on the Cartoon Network, I didn't think it would be anything Id' watch, but one night I happened to catch it and found myself laughing out loud (much to the annoyance of my roommate) throughout the entire episode.  Yes, it's that funny.
the extras are OK, I'd like to see more of the actors working (it's always fun to watch VOs being recorded and seeing the actors trying different takes), and more of the original episodes (one is included on the Season 1 disc; sadly, there are none on Season 2).
Be fore-warned though, this stuff is pretty caustic and not for those of gentle humor.  But for the rest of us, it's comedy gold.",1247961600,4,1068,4.782608695652174
3803820,5,B001US3XRI,"Just like the other sets there are an episode or two that I didn't care for, but overall very funny and worth the watch.",1247443200,2,120,4.041666666666667
3803821,5,B001US3XRI,Shin Chan has to be one of the funniest and most entertaining shows I've seen in years!,1243123200,4,87,4.176470588235294

3803855,5,B001US3XRI,"Very good, thought-provoking show.",1441152000,,34,7.75
3803856,5,B001US3XRI,Shin chan is funny as hell and only gets better as the series progressed. This is mainly due to the voice overs and the translations that develop over time to have its own sensibility. Or else the writers just got better at holding their brown brown.,1436400000,,250,4.456521739130435
3803857,5,B001US3XRI,"Fast delivery, good price.",1433808000,,26,5.75
3803858,5,B001US3XRI,Bought all 3 seasons at once. About halfway through season three and so far I gotta say that I like this one the best. It is funny with less tedious filler  episodes. Also the underlying story arc is humorous with a nice payoff I wasn't really expecting on the last episode. It's nice to see all their usual nonsense come together somewhat in the end.,1425686400,,351,4.4
3803859,5,B001US3XRI,good suff!,1424822400,,10,4.5

3803875,5,B001US3XRI,I watch this series on. Cartoon network on adult swim and is by far the funniest show I've seen is crude  but the ass dancing never gets old shin is adorable and his entire families with episodes of shenanigans,1390262400,,210,4.384615384615385
3803876,5,B001US3XRI,I've always loved the shin chan series and I needed to have the second one to accompany my first set. I had already seen these (along with season one) but it's too good not to watch again!,1389312000,,188,4.108108108108108
3803877,5,B001US3XRI,"Funimation's version of Shin Chan stands out as one of the most memorable comedy anime series I've watched. The show has multiple layers of comedy ranging from obvious poop jokes to more subtle, adult-oriented innuendos. Therefore, the more you pay attention to this show, the more you will enjoy it. Also, it helps if you have perverted sense of humor to begin with.",1389312000,,367,4.841269841269841
3803878,5,B001US3XRI,The DVD was as described. It is a funny tv series. If you are ok with adult humor and like cartoons / animation then this is it.,1380672000,,128,3.7777777777777777
3803879,5,B001US3XRI,"Absolutely love this show!  I about died when they took it off Netflix, but now I can watch it anytime",1361232000,,102,4.1
3803880,4,B001US3XRI,At first I had no idea what to expect from the show. On a whim I decided to give it a chance. I was very pleasantly surprised At the clever humor. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a good laugh and is interested in discovering something different.,1360281600,,256,4.244897959183674
3803881,5,B001US3XRI,love it hilarious was so happy to complete my collection of the shin chan series best anime in my opinion,1358985600,,105,4.3
3803882,5,B001US3XRI,"I love this show.  It's gotta be one of the most enjoyable feel-good shows ever.  And one of the funniest.  Shin is hilarious; a witty little 5 year old kid obsessed with poo.  To be honest I find all of this friends annoying though.  The parts focusing on Shin and his family are the best.  Anything Shin says or does is hilarious.  This English version is the only version of Shin Chan I've ever seen, so honestly I couldn't imagine watching it with a Japanese or any other audio track.  The voices of Shin and most of the other characters are perfect to me.  I cant imagine it any other way, but I suppose if you became accustomed to the japanese version, for example, you might not like this.  I myself am disappointed there is only 3 seasons dubbed in English.  I would buy every single season if they would make more.  Can't recommend it enough",1352246400,,850,4.378205128205129
3803883,5,B001US3XRI,"Of course if he was your own kid, you would probably end up in jail because if you actually had to deal with his behavior, you'd probably kill him.
4 kinds of wrong, 8 kinds of funny. Do people say that your sense of humor is warped? You'll probably enjoy it.",1324166400,,259,4.098039215686274
