990722,5,6305210144,"""54"" starts off in a famous 60's dico years ago, where the drugs, rock n roll and the women all flowed like water and there a money  to be made
but how legal  or  safe it was back then, was a differant story,
back then in this story, you has to lie ,cheat and sleep your way to the top,
Studio 554 was the happening club and the place to go to let your hair down at night,
there was lots of famous people there and that was the place to go , to get noticed
if were going to make it in hollywood.
but like a lot of the things, all good things, must come to an end
the IRS,  did a sweep of studio 54 and and arrested the owner  and he was convicted of money laundering
and put in prison and  the big companies took it over the club ,
the new owners let stevie, the past owner after prison have one night to go back to the club
and let him invite his old friends, that night ,  some old friends that had seen each other
met and started a whole new life, and  an old friend passed away later on after that night
and you hear of the club now and it mans nothing to a lot of people
but, back then as you will see, IT WAS THE HOT  AND HAPPENING PLACE TO GO!
there is drugs and drinking and brief nudity in this show,
but its part of the show , there will other things to keep you watching too!",1506124800,,1286,3.7865168539325844

990846,4,6305210144,"Not a bad film based on a true nightclub in New York in the 70's where pretty much anything goes, other than ugly people, as unless your good looking, or perhaps rich and influential, you aren't getting through the door. It's a more tolerant of differences of race and sexuality than the older generation characters at the time, so they of course look down their noses at the place. The central character Shane is played by Ryan Phillippe, whose father is no exception to that, Shane is allowed inside, when his friend isn't.  But on one condition, he is allowed entry but his shirt is not, so Shane basically got inside because he has a ripped physic.  You soon realise that was a bit of an odd request for Mike Myers' character the owner to make, as male busboy and bartender staff's uniforms are basically the fact they don't wear one, except for 80's short shorts if they are busboy's and jeans if they are bartenders.  The cloak room and other female staff are also young and pretty types. So you'd think the owner wouldn't want a client being confused with a bartender. Not that this is an issue for long as employment at the club is what Shane so desperately is after. But anyway, 54 Director's Cut goes along the same path of most of these, lots of temptations, if you want to get ahead you've got to lower your morals type films.  It's a decent flick and there's plenty of cameos by other big name actors from the 90's to keep you interested.",1487721600,,1451,4.464150943396226

Sometimes we just need to get the whole thing and not the cut down for time version in order to get the really great movie. Ryan Phillippe's character is finally sussed out so much more. We see more of the things he would do to become one of the center pieces of the Club 54 scene. This is based on a real person who was known as Shane 54. Salma hayek, Mike Meyers and Brecken Meyer fill out the rest of this amazing cast. If you never got to go to 54, watch this movie and you will have gone. My hat is off to all concerned for restoring this movie to what it should be and thank you Ryan Phillippe for one of your finest performances ever.",1484006400,2,761,4.046357615894039

990897,4,6305210144,"Okay, most people wouldn't admit it, but I will. I only watched this movie for the graphic sex and nudity. Based on the trailer, I was expecting a giant orgy, filled with drugs and dance music, but to my surprise, 54 actually turned out to be a docudrama about Club 54, as seen through the eyes of a young waiter/bar tender/dancer. The film features the shady practices of the owner, the drug trade inside, the celebrity guests, and of course the eccentric regulars, in what turns out to be one hell of an entertaining film (...and the sex and nudity don't hurt either). Ryan Phillippe stars in a role that today I could never see him taking, but back in his younger days, he really excelled in. The way he was able to demonstrate how the exposure to a place like that can change a person, was truly remarkable. He literally went from nothing to a face that was known all over the city, simply because he was a waiter at 54. It went to his head and changed the whole dynamic of his life and relationship with his family. For as good as he was though, Mike Myers was the real star of the film, portraying famed owner Steve Rubell. Rubell's life was just one big party and he never slowed down or cared about what he was doing or saying publicly, and we all know how that turned out in the long run. Myers is one of those actors who is out of this world when he's cast in the right role, and terrible when he's not, but much as the case with Austin Powers, this role fit him like a glove. On the surface, 54 is a wild, raunchy film that is going to offend a lot of people, I don't suggest watching it with your grandparents. It does however, tell a very relevant and historically accurate story of the drug and youth culture of the mid-late 1970s in the big cities. 54 is sexy, entertaining, and informative, a mix that you don't often see on the big screen.",1479081600,,1856,4.275568181818182

990904,5,6305210144,"*Spoiler Warning*

The director's cut is a revelation, the need for which shows how paranoid Hollywood can be about any display of homosexual activity in the movies, however minor. Of course things have changed a lot since the theater version of the movie was released, but not all that much. Ryan Phillipe's character is quite frankly presented as bi-sexual, and not in any kind of ""ashamed and struggling with it"" way, remarkable for 1999.  It's simply presented in the context of the hedonism of the era.

The way this was edited out is especially clear in the ""raising my profile"" scene , the theater version outtakes of which are on YouTube.  To name only one example, the character is shown waking up next to three different partners in quick succession in both versions, but in the director's cut one of these is a handsome young man, replaced by a voluptuous young woman in the theater version.

It's a great evocation of an era when for a brief time everything seems possible, in this case the sexual revolution - thrilling illusions, while they last. And while there is usually a price to pay the morning after, it doesn't necessarily mean you regret having been at the party.",1476057600,5,1186,4.737864077669903

990957,1,6305210144,"The tale of the noted celebrity hotspot comes to the screen and probably lacks the excitement of the real thing. That should come as no surprise as Miramax's odyssey of a Garden State youth no-namer to hobnobber with the rich and famous comes off as being a less engaging repackaging (minus the porn industry) of last year's Boogie Nights.
  Ryan Phillippe stars in 54, which marks the debut of filmmaker Mark Christopher. Like Mark Wahlberg in Paul Thomas Anderson's film, Phillippe is an aimless youth living at home and is plucked from virtual anonymity. Though not by a porn filmmaker but by Steve Rubell (Mike Myers), one of the founders of the club. For reasons unknown, no reference is made to Rubell's 54 partner Ian Schrager.
  Shane (Phillippe) manages to get past the velvet rope by stripping off his shirt, much to the annoyance of friends who aren't admitted to the establishment. He gains entry to a world of stars and star makers who frequent the place and delight themselves in decadence delivered by drink and drugs. Shane makes fast friends with Greg (Bricklin Meyer), one of his co-workers whose girlfriend Anita (the sinfully sensual Salma Hayek) aspires to become a recording artist. Anita might get her chance thanks to Billie Auster (the sadly underused Sela Ward). She's an insider with her nose in coke and her eyes on Shane. She hangs out with the elite both domestic (Lauren Hutton) and foreign (Michael York).
  Christopher's vision plays like a period soap opera and the acting more undynamic as any daily serial. The cast is OK but the likes of Hayek, Ward, and Neve Campbell turn in surprisingly dull performances though not as dull as Phillippe who seems to act like he's imitating John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever (1977). As for Myers, he seems to spend a bit too much time camping it up and sounding like Fran Drescher. 54 might have started out with good intentions but would-be viewers would probably be better off renting Boogie Nights or Saturday Night Fever.",1472774400,,2002,4.8391812865497075

This is like a completely different film.  The acting and flow of the action is riveting.  It's a shame that the studio butchered the origional all because they thought America could not handle the sexual content and perhaps they were a little homophobic themselves.  In any case, a great effort was made to find the original film dailies and put the film back together with an additional 40 minutes.

990990,5,6305210144,"I am a huge fan of the film, 54. I saw it in the theater when it first premiered in 1998 and I thought it captured the hedonistic-lifestyle of late-seventies New York with accuracy and decorum. When disco-fever swept the nation, I read vehemently any (and all) articles about the famed NY nightclub, Studio 54, and was obsessed with it for many years. The portrayal of Steve Rubell by actor, Mike Meyers is uncannily accurate and is, perhaps, the best performance of his career. The other actors do a fine job and you, as the film goer, get a chance to go back in time and take a peek behind the closed doors of a world cut off from the rest of humanity.

Most directors cuts are films that are already established and the alterations are minimal, creating more of an extended cut made up of parts that were trimmed by the censors (MPAA). With 54, it is truly a different film made up of unique shots, lost footage and occasionally, VHS dailies. The film takes a much darker turn as we discover how drugs affect much more of the characters lives than the original. We also see how the Ryan Phillippes character, Shane OShea is not only used as a gigolo by women, but many men, as well.

There is an informative making of featurette with the films director, Mark Christopher and producer, Jonathan King where they talk about how the original film was wrestled out of their hands by the studio after a test screening, The audience who was responsive to the movie was not the audience who we made the film for. And, the laborious and daunting task of tracking down the original film elements by Nancy Valle.

If you are a fan of 54, you will be in for a real treat. If you didn't like the original version of 54, you may want to take a peek at what the director originally intended. If you are a film student, you will be fascinated by how editing can completely alter a films narrative.  There is something for everyone in this new directors cut.

A small warning: Though most of the original elements were discovered, the editor had to resort to using the original VHS dailies to make up some missing scenes. This is a bit of a distraction as the film suddenly changes from crystal- clear Blu-ray quality to grainy VHS on multiple occasions. I was surprised this was not noted anywhere on the Blu-rays cover. For the casual film watcher, this may be a deterrent. For the fanatic, seeing these missing scenes, in any quality, will only add to the experience. I just wanted to mention it so you will know exactly what to expect.",1465084800,40,2525,4.480434782608696

991067,3,6305210144,"54 which is a film based on the infamous Studio 54 Nightclub in New york city during the 70's
the original Theatrical release blu-ray version went for only 90 min which included the end credits
plus there was no extras except for the usual Theatrical trailer
well over 15 years later writer/Director Mark Christopher who wrote the films screenplay & Directored the film
has now released his own version of the film, the version he wanted to originally release in Cinemas back in the late 90's
but Bob & Harvey weinstein of Miramax decided to release their version instead
which Mark christopher definitely did not want well now his version is officially released on blu-ray & dvd now after all these years
Mark's version has about 10mins of extra scenes inserted back in the film that were originally cut out from the Theatrical version
the 10 extra mins inserted have only been Digitally remastered from the workprint if that, definietly not 1080P HD
why Lionsgate didn't give new HD transfers to the extra scenes is anybody's guess which would have made sense to do
the Theatrical version is about 88mins and then the end credits start, the last scene in the Directors cut is at 98mins
and there's also no end Narration during the end credits of what happened to steve rubell & studio 54
this new Directors version is actually very similiar to the Theatrical version with the exception of the extra 10mins inserted
so don't believe the marketing bulls*** that the new D version is completely different
the 1:85:1 HD transfer is from the previous blu-ray release with new 5.1 master audio mix

there is also some new extras to, the original blu-ray version only had the Theatrical trailer
IF YOU COULD ONLY READ MY MIND which is new retrospective featurette on the film only goes for 10-12mins
the featurette is interviews with writer/director Mark christopher & producers Richard Gladstein & others
they specifically just talk about this Directors cut version & how/why the extra scenes were cut from the Theatrical version
that's all nothing that exciting
there's also a new AUDIO COMMENTARY with Mark christopher & the D.O.P of the film
this new commentary is bit boring, alot of pauses thru the whole film
there's also a TREATMENT PODCAST with Host Elvis mitchell & Director Mark christopher, it's AUDIO INTERVIEW only
and also new stills Photo Gallery & the usual trailer
it's a matter of personal preference either keep the Theatrical version blu-ray or buy this new Director cut blu-ray
3 stars for this new blu-ray reissue",1464048000,4,2531,4.886046511627907

It`s theatrical version was bad so I was looking forward to this director`s cut that I kept reading good things about and I had exactly the same reaction. There is absolutely no story or character development. The movie is just a mess. Here`s hoping a true 54 movie will be made one day.",1462233600,,499,4.617977528089888

991122,2,6305210144,"For all the talk of the director's cut being a lost classic and so much closer to what the director intended, I watched this new cut somewhat baffled.  The extra footage (easily discernible because it's from a work print and you can tell the difference in quality) adds absolutely nothing to the film, story or characters.  it's literally all gay themed material (which I'm certain Miramax wanted cut out so people would go see the movie; boy, did they misjudge their audience).  Some of the lost footage is interesting, but it doesn't suddenly turn the film into a new viewing experience (or make it a better film).

On the flip side, in order to accommodate this new footage, two key pieces of the film were cut out.  Neve Campbell's role has basically been reduced to a five line cameo, and subsequently, Phillippe's character's reaction to her supposed betrayal now makes no sense, as their relationship has all but disappeared.  And in terms of Steve Rubell, he's now cut down to a drooling, pathetic husk, seemingly incapable of pissing standing up, let alone running a nightclub.

And that's the whole issue with 54 in a nutshell.  People were expecting it to be this dark exploration of the club and the people within, and it's not.  it's a fun nostalgia trip and a story about some characters set against the backdrop of the club, but 54, Rubell, and any actual real life people are not the focus.  if you go in to the film knowing that, you'll enjoy it more.",1446681600,4,1468,4.655038759689923

991189,4,6305210144,"After having seen the commercially released version years ago, and being a Disco Music fanatic, I was pretty excited to hear this version was finally available. The legend about this director's cut is that this was how the movie had been intended to be released until preview audiences rejected it for being too edgy. That was 1998, and now I guess Sony Pictures decided people are more ready to see it this way. I was a bit surprised at how much different this movie is from the official 1998 release. With this director's cut almost half of the minutes have been replaced, and you should not see it with anyone who is upset with nudity or out-there displays of sexual activity or drug abuse.
The music is splendid and the visual spectacle of the goings-on is easily worth the price of admission. It is easy to see why Studio 54 became an instant legend, if the reality really was as awesome as the film shows it to have been.
The plot is more engaging in this ""new"" version.  It develops the relationships better between the three coworkers who live together and also makes that relationship more complicated and far less wholesome. The story line examines the question of how far will you go to be a success in a world built on questionable and shifting ethics, and how do you define what matters in a world where all the rules you ever knew seem to vanish once you pass the velvet rope.
I think the 1998 release ""tied things up"" at the end better than the director's cut.  But otherwise I prefer the director's cut for the way the story reaches so much farther into the moral and ethical problems of the characters and relationships.",1442275200,12,1637,4.545762711864406

991195,3,6305210144,"Ryan Phillippe played Jersey City young man, Shane, who seeks a better life in New York City at Club 54. Mike Myers plays gay owner Steve Rubell with substance and sympathy. You feel sorry for him. Despite his wealth and fame, he was a very lonely man. Myers does a brilliant subtle job in playing Steve Rubell with complexity. You forgot he also played Austin Powers. In fact, his Austin Powers co-star Michael York has a role in the film as ambassador. There was plenty of well-known familiar faces like Sela Ward, Lauren Hutton, Mary McCormack, and Ellen Albertini Dow as Disco Dottie.

Through Shane, we see how he gets in and stays in the club until it gets shut down. Club 54 was synonymous with fame and fortune. Anybody who was anybody was at 54 in those days. Selma Hayek and Breckin Meyer plays a married couple who befriend Shane. Neve Campbell plays a soap opera actress trying to achieve fame and fortune as an actress. There are actors playing 54 regulars like Andy Warhol and Truman Capote. I wished they utilized ER's Sherry Stringfield's ""Viv"" more in the film. She is barely recognizable in the role and is wasted in it.

The film does an adequate job in recreating history of New York City in the late seventies. To see the twin towers is haunting enough. They filmed this movie in 1998. The film recreates the grittiness and character of New York City in those days. In fact, New York City was a place where it was possible to live and work in the city. Today, the city has become expensive and unaffordable for the working class unless you move to the outer boroughs.

I felt the DVD could have had more features. They only show a music video. I also felt the writing could have been stronger too. Still the movie recreates a life and times of New York City's notorious club 54 and the era.",1439510400,,1811,4.498480243161095

The film titillated, but it failed to commit. The story seemed to drift off, earning razzies for all involved, despite some good, even some excellent performances.

991544,2,6305210144,"Mark Christophers 1998 film 54 felt like a watered-down version of Boogie Nights that met a future watered-down version of Party Monster.  Thats not to say that it wasn't still a fun ride.  And who doesnt enjoy a hippie Mark Ruffalo, even if his part in the film was rather small.

First, lets get the female hormones out of the way and discuss how hot Breckin Meyer was in this film.  I don't know what I enjoyed more: his boyish face, his jet-black hair, or him constantly being semi-naked.  It was easy to see why Salma Hayeks character was so into him.  I have never found him attractive before or since, so this was a refreshing change.  He was easily the hottest guy in the film, and thats taking into consideration how often Ryan Phillippe was shirtless.

Anywho, Mike Meyers did a remarkable job as Steve Rubell.  You half expect him to break into a Scottish accent or pull out the ol reliable Wayne Campbell or Austin Powers to grab a quick laugh if he felt his performance was suffering, but he managed to not only stay in character for the longevity of the film but also successfully pulled off a creepy sleazebag who typically only hires hot young men if they're willing to perform sexually for him.  It made your skin crawl to see Meyers in this kind of role, which is probably the best compliment to its effectiveness.

One thing I found to be particularly sad upon reflection was that Meyers character, Greg, never does attain his dream of becoming a bartender at 54, since the night that its finally supposed to happen for him, the club gets raided and Rubell gets locked up for tax fraud.

And who can forget Ellen Albertini Dow, a character actress whom you almost certainly don't recognize by name but couldn't miss in a film.  She plays Disco Dottie here (and won a Razzie for it), though she may be better known as the rapping grandmother from the Adam Sandler film The Wedding Singer.  Shes been in everything from Sister Act to Scrubs, to Will & Grace and Seinfeld.  The old-ladies-being-crude shtick never does quite make me chuckle, but Dow manages to put such a sweet spin on her vulgarity that its hard not to, at the very least, like her.

Its actually surprising how much credit Neve Campbell gets in this film.  Her part as a star that Phillippes Shane is crushing on is rather forgettable.  She doesnt do much in this film, aside from lending her peak 90s popularity to it.  Come to think of it, the same goes for the rest of the cast, though we see a lot less of Campbell than the films poster would lead you to believe.

All in, the film was not that great, so its understandable why it received so much negativity from the critics.  A film titled 54 should be more about the club than the folks who work there and the drama that exists between them (save, of course, for Rubell), and I can agree that the audience probably would have benefited more from exploring the heart of 54 and what made it so exclusive, culminating in its eventual demise.

This film seemed, as I said, more like a vehicle for 90s stars than a true depiction of the club 54, which came off as nothing more special than any other hard-to-get-into club.",1409184000,2,3159,4.486013986013986

The producers stock the dance floor scenes with mostly women wearing fashions from the 1990s, not the late 1970s.  There's no gay presence at all.  Furthermore, the DJ's at Studio did amazing things with the music to make it upbeat and trippy.  The way the music appears in the movie, you expect the Solid Gold dancers to appear.

991848,4,6305210144,"This film is a morality tale of a young man dazzled by the bright lights of the big city. Ryan Phillippe does a credible job playing young Shane O'Shea, a gas station attendant from New Jersey who becomes a boy-toy bartender in Studio 54 in the 1970s. Young Shane is allowed into the club and then hired as an employee by Steve Rubell, played by Mike Myers. Myers offers the best acting in the film as he plays the outrageous Rubell. Drugs and alcohol are rampant in this exclusive nightclub for the stars , millionaires, models, and other folks in the New York and International jet set. Salma Hayek plays Anita the coat check girl who becomes a disco diva while her husband Greg, played by Breckin Meyer, struggles as a busboy in the club. This married couple takes young Shane into their apartment as a house-mate but this was not a match made in heaven. Tensions develop since Shane and Greg are competing to move up from busboy to bartender. Sexual tensions also develop between Shane and Anita. Shane moves up quick in the chaos of the club becoming the lover of a record producer, played very well by Sela Ward. Sela Ward's acting is excellent as she plays the older woman who is using a younger man for his sexual energy and physical beauty. This is a nice twist on the theme of the older successful man seducing and supporting a younger woman. The character played by Ward, Billie Auster, is sophisticated and worldly and has very low expectations. She just settles for money and sex in her life. There is a scene in the film where Shane is making love to Billie Auster and Billie passes out from drugs while they are having intercourse. Shane continues to move inside her and he catches a look at himself in a mirror, full length nude on top of her, being confronted with what he has become. Shane's fantasy however is soap-opera star Julie Black, played by Neve Campbell, a New Jersey actress who has made it big in Shane's eyes. Enough said about the plot since it is in the end an old fashioned story of young man loses and then finds himself. One fun aspect of the film is to spot all the famous folks who appear in the film either as extras or as offering one or two lines. This includes Thelma Houston, Mark Ruffalo, Lauren Hutton, Michael York, Cheryl Crow, Cindy Crawford, Heidi Klum, Donald Trump, Art Garfunkel, Valerie Perrine, Michael Pitt, and Lorna Luft.",1342051200,,2378,4.545454545454546

991898,5,6305210144,"Some may see 54 as a cautionary tale, others as a how-to manual--I see it as a mixture of both. The late 70's early 80's were an extraordinary time. On the one hand there was recession, gas shortages, the Iran hostage situation, the Lennon assassination, horrible fashion, and disco; on the other hand there was sex, drugs, and disco. It was the best of times; it was the tackiest of times. Before AIDS, before people knew that coke just made you even more of a jerk than you were already, before people realized that leisure suits looked ridiculous, and mullets and perms were the devil's haircut; it looked like the party would never end. When we woke up it was either the big chill, or the big hangover. What were we thinking? Still, this film is really an important historical document that sums up the zeitgeist of those turbulent days of disco inferno.

Studio 54 proprietor Steve Rubell (Mike Meyers) is both crass and sensitive. He wants the party to last forever, but you'll only get in if you are beautiful, powerful, rich, a celebrity, or some combination of the above. Mike Meyers acts his pants off in a rare dramatic role. Though at times his version of Rubell shows flashes of Austin Powers, and even Dr. Evil, he mostly plays him straight. Or as straight as you can play someone who uses the bartenders and bus boys of Studio 54 as his own personal male harem.

54 is similar to 24 Hour Party People, centering on the scene around a night club, but in 24 Hour PP the club is in Manchester, not Manhattan. 54 is also different in that rather than focusing on the impresario the story is told through the eyes of an outsider who starts as a busboy then becomes a star bartender, Shane O'Shea (Ryan Phillippe). His character is based on Tieg Thomas who worked at Studio 54 from 1977 to 1982. Shane is a New Jersey boy who dreams of the night life just over the bridge when he sees a picture of Julie Black (Neve Campbell), a New Jersey girl who acts in a soap opera, in the gossip column. He has the looks that get him in, even though his Jersey friends can't get in, even when he becomes a star bartender and begs Steve to put them on the list.

The most poignant scene in my opinion is when the newly hired Shane moves to New York. He walks down the dreary stairs of his New Jersey home while his father just sits there glumly and says good-bye.

Shane moves in with a couple who both work at 54, Greg & Anita Randazzo (Breckin Meyer and Salma Hayek). Greg is a busboy like Shane, but he is unwilling to do what it takes to get ahead and be promoted to bartender. Anita is a coat check girl, but she has disco dreams of her own. Salma Hayek is smokin' hot, and she even does get to finally sing, quite well, I might add. Though 54 is not so much a film with Hollywood endings as an elegy for a bygone era, those halcyon days that did not end so well...

I think that Ryan Phillippe did a great job here, the best I've seen him since he played Sebastian Valmont in Cruel Intentions. Neve Campbell does well as Shane's love interest. A couple of kids from New Jersey, they go bowling, and could almost end up living happily ever after if they hadn't both sold their souls to the demons who preside over Studio 54.

There are tons of celebrity cameos: Michael York plays an ambassador, Ron Jeremy plays Ron, Elio Fiorucci plays himself, and we have Cindy Crawford, Sheryl Crow, Heidi Klum, Donald Trump, and a host of others who probably walked through the famous doors of Studio 54 in its heyday. Ellen Albertini Dow plays Disco Dottie, and she was of course the rappin' Grandma Rosie in The Wedding Singer. The disco music, heard in retrospect, is actually kind of thrilling, especially with the excitement of the dancing, and the wall to wall decadence. There is a great disco version of Gordon Lightfoot's ""If You Could Read My Mind"" I kid you not!!!

The Bottom Line is that 54 is a really fun film about a certain bygone era. If you remember it that proves you weren't there. If you can find it, if they ever release it on DVD, it would behoove you to see the director's cut. They watered it down, cut out 45 minutes, and inserted 25 minutes of exposition to smooth over the plot gaps. In spite of their tinkering, it was still a flop, so it would have been better to go down in flames with the original cut by director Mark Christopher. A film like 54 is just too fabulous for the masses, and that is why they had to stand behind the velvet rope wishing they could get into Studio 54 and dance the night away.

Steve Rubell: Is he gorgeous?
Viv: He's gorgeous. Look for yourself.
Shane O'Shea: [voiceover] I was warned that Steven didn't hire any dummies and I should be on my toes because he could ask some really tricky questions.
Steve Rubell: What's two plus two?
Shane O'Shea: Huh?
Steve Rubell: You'll be fine.

I find the story of Studio 54 a fascinating one.  It was the right club in the right city at the right time, and co-run by just the kind of guy (Rubell) who would never have been permitted in had he not owned the place.

I wasn't expecting ""54"" to be a documentary, but it somehow disappoints on many levels.  Phillippe and Campbell are pretty enough, but not particularly solid actors.  They look and sound the same in every movie I've seen them in. The time spent on his pursuit of her and their brief relationship could have come out of any of a hundred movies, so it kind of bogs this one down.

This movie seems to have been painted by the numbers.  Perhaps it was a better film on paper (or before Miramax reportedly meddled with it), but the end result was more bland than glam.",1251158400,,980,4.34065934065934
991901,5,6305210144,"Studio 54 was the hottest nightclub in the country back in the late '70's. Celebrities like Liza Minnilli, Diana Ross, Suzanne Summers, and more were often sighted there and you either had to have a certain look or have good contacts to get in. Studio 54 was actually an old TV studio where daytime soaps like ""Love of Life"" were filmed, and by the mid 1970's Steve Rubell decided to make this old studio the hottest and treandiest nightclub in New York City.
 ""54"" is about Steve Rubell's Studio 54, its inhabitants and characters, and Rubell's ultimate downfall because he refused to claim a lot of Studio 54's cash from the IRS. The plot follows how a young naive man, played beautifully by Ryan Phillpe, comes to Studio 54, meets Rubell, and becomes an employee at the nightclub. Through the Phillpe character we see the rise and fall of Rubell's astonishing empire.
 Mike Myers (who plays Rubell), Thelma Hayek, and Neve Campbell all star.

Now if you're talking about another famed New York nightspot, CBGB, you're talking my language.  Regardless, I found ""54"" eminently intriguing and watchable.  The film is not so much a celebration of the nightlife but rues the decay that ended the party.  Makes you wonder if the makers of the film were partisans or foes of the disco lifestyle.  Ryan Phillippe is quite good as Shane, a working-class Jersey kid, who is seduced by the artifice of easy sex and drugs that 54 offered.  The performance that is a real eye opener is Mike Myers as owner Steve Rubell.  This is probably the best work Myers has ever done onscreen.  His Rubell can best be described as a decadent ringmaster who uses hedonism to orchestrate his debauched circus.  Studio 54 is a mere footnote in the culture but this is a good film.",1240704000,,894,4.5375
991963,1,6305210144,"How can an eleven year old movie feel more dated than its decades older subject matter? When it chooses to concentrate the zeitgeist of a decade into a simple-minded ""don't do drugs"" morality tale. In addition, the film is cynical, naive, historically incomplete, borderline homophobic, and regionally offensive to both New Jersey and New York City! No plot point is fully explored, and some are just abandoned mid way through (the father?!). And despite the critical accolades, I thought Mike Myers portrayal of Steve Rubell was just another vampy facet of his Austin Powers or Cat in the Hat character. He played it as more of a klutzy impression than a living person with real flaws. Had any single uncomfortable scene with Rubell, and there were many, been given more than five minutes of screen time, it might have been a very different and effective film.

In the end, ""54"" doesn't have a leg to stand on. It can't successfully moralize against the supposed slick emptiness of disco because it is far emptier at its core, and the story it's trying to tell us is older than the hills. All this movie did was make me long for a time when everything wasn't so corporate and sanitized. My favorite character is probably the recreation of the giant half moon face, with the automated light up coke spoon, hung above the stage in the club.

I could only watch as they blew their time away on nothing of real importance, and blew their brains and cash away on white powder to put up their noses... all the time thinking that they were on the fast track to something, but really going nowhere. It was only losers who were outside the scene.

It's the death of elderly Dottie out on the dance floor that lets you know the party is really over. The lights are turned on to show her dead on the dance floor, blood streaming out of her nose, lying amid the piles of litter on the floor that moments before had passed for glittering streamers. The club's owner has the lights turned back off as Dottie's body is carried out, and the music begins anew. Moments later, the IRS arrives. When Steve Rubell is asked if he is ""going to get out,"" he replies: ""Where would I go?""

If there is anything really brilliant here, it's the riveting performance by the actor who seems to have captured the essence of Steve Rubell, Mike Myers.

992057,4,6305210144,"In the mid to late 1970s, disco music was king and everyone enjoyed going to the clubs and dancing the night away.  In this story of New York's world-famous Studio 54, the story is told through the eyes of Shane O'Shea (Ryan Phillippe), a young man from New Jersey who manages to get onto the guest list and into the very exclusive club.  A gas station attendant by day, Shane soon finds himself as one of the regulars and manages to secure himself a job at the club as a bus boy/bartender.

Shane befriends two of the club's workers, Greg Randazzo (Brechin Meyer) and his wife Anita (Salma Hayek).  They invite Shane to move in to their apartment, but Greg soon suspects that Shane and Anita are having an affair.  Shane actually has fallen for Julie Black (Neve Campbell), another regular.  A soap opera star, Shane is intrigued by her beauty and is immediately drawn to her.  After a while, the two begin a relationship.

Meanwhile, Steve Rubell, played magnificently by Mike Myers, has been laundering money from the club.  Each night, he sends bags full of money out with the trash to be picked up and taken away, out of sight of the I.R.S.  This scam goes on for quite some time until finally the I.R.S. finds out about Rubell's operation and raids the club.

Shane, spurned in the end by Julie, eventually leaves 54 to become a college student and restaurant manager.  Steve Rubell is sentenced to 18 months in prison and is forced to sell 54 in a plea agreement. He is allowed to remain as a ""consultant"" to the new ownership, and he also throws a big party at the club's re-opening, attended by Shane, Greg, and Anita.

Studio 54 was indeed the king of the discos.  Celebrities from all over the world, including Andy Warhol and Truman Capote, were regular visitors to the club.  The music was loud, and sex and drugs were freely available. Unfortunately, 54 never really regained its prominence after its re-opening, and it closed down for good in 1986.  Steve Rubell died in 1989 at age 45.

  This movie does an excellent job of showcasing the very famous club, right down to the throngs of people who begged to get in each night.  The acting in the film is very good, but Mike Myers stands out above the rest.  His superb portrayal of the eccentric but troubled Steve Rubell is the highlight of the film.

Having grown up in the 70s, I remember reading about Studio 54 and what a fantastic place it was.  This movie shows both the bright and dark sides of the famous disco.  I recommend this movie highly.  If you're a child of the 70s like me, then you'll remember the disco music and the almost surreal essence that 54 had.

Studio 54, and the Disco Era in general were about Freedom, Great Music, Great People Watching, and in general having a hell of a goodtime. For the brief period that it ruled the music charts, Disco broke down barriers, and the stars of certain musical genres were able to crossover. I often call 1979 ""the year that music got close to the light"".

My BIG issue with this movie is that It FAILED to show that for many of us we took advantage of the liberation of Disco's (like 54), and ENJOYED ourselves. It was glamorous, it was over the top, and IT WAS FUN. Amazing as it seems, many of us did not inhail cocaine like air, and for some of us who did indulge, we did not become adicts, or for that matter guilt ladden.

Clubs like Studio 54 were great palaces that broke down many barriers, and helped us escape the many issues facing the nation in the late 70's.

And you'd walk through the hall of mirrors like Ryan Phillippe, pass the coat check, and come upon that row of black doors, a gateway to the most fantastic party in your wildest dreams.  I finally figured out one reason for the club's success -- with the undeclared cash income, the owners threw the most extravagant parties of all time, night after night.  This film gives an inkling, an idea of the place, for history, though the real Studio 54 was neither as freakish or out of control as the film depicts.

This was a dance club like no other in the late 1970s.  The patrons were either celebrities or those chosen at the front door because they had the ""look"" of the beautiful people.  Inside was a fantasy of dancing and drugs, all lit by strobe lighting.  And, as it had formerly been a theater, there was a even balcony for those almost private moments of brief romantic encounters.  The waiters and bartenders were all gorgeous young men and wore nothing but shorts and a bow tie.  This is a story of one of these guys.

Ryan Phillips is cast in the role of Shane O'Shea, a 19 year old from New Jersey who yearns for a star-studded life.  He's chosen at the door and is big eyed with wonder and desire.  Eventually, he becomes a waiter and later is promoted to bartender.  There are a lot of women.  And there is a lot of money.  He even gets his picture in a magazine.  Everything comes easy for him but he really is interested in a New Jersey girl who's a rising soap opera star.

The best role in the film goes to Mike Myers, who plays the legendary Steve Rubell who made it all happen.  He's a strange bird with an eccentric personality and he does a lot of drugs.  The money rolls in and he is in trouble with the IRS.  But he's so puffed up with his own importance that he even brags about it on TV.  Eventually, he's arrested and the party ends.  But before it does, the filmgoers are treated to a small view of what it was back then.

I found the story silly, but I loved the nostalgia.  Here was the music and the lights and the feeling of decadence that characterized a time that no longer exists.  I lived through that time period.

All the other players are very well cast in their rolls too, but the plot is a little lacking at times, the whole Ryan Phillippe and Salma Hayek love triangle seems to be swept under the carpet in favour of a some IRS tax dodge story which I think would have been better as a pub plot.

Mike Myers was brilliant in his potrayal of the eccentric genius of the club owner, Ryan Phillippe did a great job in his narration (though as an actor I think he is lousy), and my FAVORITE sexy lady in the world, Sela Ward, is mesmerizing to me in ANY film, and she is beautiful and brilliant as always.
This film even delves into the lives of the ""social climbers""; Phillippe's character, a Jersey kid literally pumping gas, lands a job as a bartender at 54 which paid more than most MD's made at the time and had more prestige to his peers; also, the mixing of all sorts in the club- old money, new money, beautiful young people, made for a very alluring mix.
This film was great; the biggest letdown was the acting job done by Salma Hayek, who I hold in very high regard as both an actress and a sexy lady- she reduced her character to a whining,
pathetic shell of what I felt was meant to be a strong-willed, determined starlet.
Overall, this was one of the best films of 1998; Mike Myers showed that he has an incredible acting range, from the extreme bafoonery in Wayne's World, to the more sophisticated comedy of the Austin Powers series, then going into the genre of the tortured soul of the 54's rise and fall.",1029196800,6,1373,4.430830039525691

992121,3,6305210144,"Following up 'Boogie Nights' and edited for theatre release perhaps '54' was doomed from the beginning.  It was always going to be hard enough garnering teenage interest in a movie about the 70's disco scene even if it did have some of the hottest young talent out there.  However, despite bad reviews this is actually a good movie.
The plot follows Jersey kid Shane (Phillipe) desperate to make it big and ending up as a topless waiter in Studio 54, the hottest nightclub in New York.  There he hooks up with Meyer and Hayek and begins his road to corruption along drugs and meaningless sex in an effort to make something of his life.  Basically that seems to be the main message of the film, collecting together a group of seemingly perfect beautiful people that aren't happy with their lives and seek direction.  Phillipe's wants fame, Hayek wants a singing career, Meyer wants a promotion and more money whilst club owner Steve Rubell (Myers) is the most self-deprecating figure in the movie.
Myers gives the performance of his career as the ultimately pathetic Steve Rubell, and the cast of hot young hopefuls surrounding him almost echo their characters in a way, each on the brink of the big time.  Looking at this it's a shame Phillip can't pick better material than 'Antitrust' because he does manage to uphold his role whilst real life friend Meyer and sultry Hayek are both equally good.  Also watch out for a performance from Sherry Stringfield (aka Susan from 'ER').  The only problem is that one of the big-listed stars, Neve Campbell, has all of three scenes in the movie but still manages to sparkle.
This is be no ways a bad film, but it's also no classic.  Still it's rare that a cast of teenage hopefuls can uphold such an ultimately bleak movie.  And Myers should have received some kind of accolade for his work here.",1024444800,6,1838,4.680124223602484

Personally, I hate the places; the drinks are insanely overpriced, the door policy is brutally elitist (the movie recognises that, but tries to make out that it's a Good Thing, cause it's cool to be one of Steve's Friends), the music is bloody awful and they're too often meat markets for the ruthlessly single.
Why in the world anyone is meant to care about a place like this is frankly beyond me.  I watched it dutifully, trying to summon a smidgeon of sympathy for the people involved, but in the end I wished they'd all just go home and stop fooling themselves.  Oh, the performances are fine, although I thought Mike Myers was a bit wooden, but then he's a great comedy actor, he doesn't need to prove that he can do other stuff too.
Why this movie ever got made is a mystery to me.  Its main purpose seems to me to be to make me nostalgic for a club that a.) no longer exists and b.)

992123,3,6305210144,"In the 1970s, a young man named Steve Rubell opened a dance club in New York City called Studio 54. It became the hottest, most fashionable and most notorious nightclub in the world. It was frequented by famous people who were legends in their day, such as Truman Capote, Gore Vidal, Andy Warhol, Princess Grace of Monaco, Liza Minnelli and The Rolling Stones. As for the rest of the customers, admission was granted by Rubell and his doormen not based on how long you had wait in line, but on how beautiful you were. Super models, wall street executives, hookers and hustlers all mingled with the rich and famous. Studio 54 stood as the cathedral of the Me Generation, and many people waited eagerly to see it crumble and fall.
54 tries hard to replicate life in and around the ultimate disco. The tale is told by narrator Shane [Ryan Phillippe], a blonde young Adonis from across the river in Jersey. Shane, who's a sheltered dreamer, manages to get a job as a busboy at the club. The allure, the glamour and the attitude there are his vision of Heaven, although from our vantage point, it often look like Hell.
There is not much a story. The film paints portraits of some of the customers and employees instead. Mike Myers, playing Steve Rubell, gives a powerful, Oscar caliber performance. His interpretation of this mad Emperor of Dance manages to make Rubell as much of a victim of his generation's excess as a perpetrator.
While the film is full of drugs, sex [of all kinds] and rock and roll, it is strangely timid. By pulling their punches, the film's makers never grab the audience. It's as though they were still embarrassed by the excesses of the times. Compared to 1997's boisterous Boogie Nights, it's tame stuff.
54 encounters a problem that has plagued many movies. Shane and his new friends who work at the club may be beautiful, but they are so relentlessly self-centered that, in the end, we don't much care where they wind up. It takes a master of the medium to make us feel for characters who take and never give. Only Rubell elicits any sympathy, but the picture does not center on him, as perhaps it should have.
The movie does manages to show the high energy of Studio 54. The music, dancing and lighting are fairly faithfully reproduced. The crowds are fun to look at. Rubell's descent into drug-induced madness is similar to the articles I have read about him.
54 is in the pop culture class and entertains us a sleek yet trashy way. If you want to see the late 70s Manhattan scene portrayed with style and substance, check out 1997's The Last Days of Disco.",1017187200,,2584,4.595238095238095

Ryan Phillipe is a young kid from New Jersey who dreams of the big time across the river.  He and two of his pals try to get into 54, but only he is admitted.  Once inside, he is taken back by the scene. The loose sex, lights, drugs and the pounding disco beats are exactly what he is looking for in life.  He eventually gets a job as a bar back and befriends fellow bar back Breckin Meyer and his wife, Selma Hayek, who works in the coat room.  Ms. Hayek has dreams of a singing career.  54 isn't just a job for these people, it's a way of life.  Neve Campbell shows up as a soap star who Mr. Phillipe gets somewhat involved with.  The young stars are all fairly likable, but Mike Myers, who appears as 54's co-founder, the late Steve Ruebell, shines above them all.  Mr. Myers chews up scenery as the eccentric Ruebell and the film is worth watching for his performance alone.

992168,2,6305210144,"What a sad depiction of the verve that existed at the ever notorious and  hedonistic nightclub  residing in the middle of New York's party scene with  crowds of day-trippers, opportunists and native New Yorkers dying to get  past the infamous velvet ropes to make it on the list of ingredients for  Steve Rubell's social ""salad bowl"". Instead of taking a detailed  look at the club's corrupt commerce from a legal perspective, it focuses on  a simplistic schmoe who lives across the tracks in New Jersey, just another  speculator with a febrile desire to enter the illustrious doors of the  scandalous hotspot. Ryan Phillippe as the meek-minded Shane O'Shea is  mediocre at best, consistently flaunting his virile physique and golden  skin, his Greek visage a perfect comparison to a depiction a one-night  stand named Billie Auster (Sela Ward in a breathlessly short role)  bequeaths him.
Salma Hayek and Breckin Meyer as the utterly piteous and  star-struck couple Anita and Greg are terribly tacky characters and  hopelessly naive. Hayek's only worthy showcase is the skimpy spandex she  dawns when she finally gets her fantasy spot in one of the club's various  stage shows. The only redeeming performance in this whole movie is Mike  Meyers as the seedy Steve Rubell, the man behind the magic and the  instigator of Studio 54. He exhibits the drunken queerness convincingly,  and I was almost repelled by how well he infused himself with the character  to beget Steve's bizarre and almost creepy aura.
Where this film really  falls short is cheapening the audience on the history of the kitsch club,  excluding the names of its renowned employees and promoters. A good example  of a missing link is the more notable omission of Ian Schrager, Rubell's  right-hand man and business partner. It was widely whispered that Schrager  demanded he be omitted from the film's script to protect his privacy. Who  also was never mentioned is Carmen D'Alessio, Studio 54's promoter and  party coordinator. This woman did a lot of work for Schrager and Rubell,  telephoning numerous agents and mailing out invites for some of their more  stylish celebrations they held during the years that the establishment's  doors were wide open to the lucky few. It is far more fascinating and  edifying to watch VH1's Behind the Music documentary on the lurid and  legendary discotheque that was populated by countless celebrities in the  past, including superstars like Michael Jackson, Liza Minelli, Muriel  Hemingway, Brooke Shields, Grace Jones, Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall. What I  think would've added a good deal of pizzazz and nostalgia to the movie is a  wide variety of cameos from celebrities who frequented the club most in its  glory days and even the disreputably offensive doormen. If you're going to  make a movie about one of America's most riotous eras, why not throw some  of its more eminent faces into it?
What this movie did manage to portray  very well is the self-indulgence of all its patrons and the showmanship of  the extravagant parties. The balloons, the confetti, the disco lights and  the shrine-like display of the moon and its cocaine spoon were recreated  with the panache of its decade. 1978 screamed from the screen unto the  viewer's eyes each time Shane took a romp around the dance floor. Couples  kissed, tongued, sniffed, popped and even openly had sex among other  partygoers. As far as capturing the time period, there's no dispute  regarding accuracy.
Overall, I grant this film a two-and-a-half star  rating for its honest effort and Meyer's enthralling portrayal of the  wizard behind New York's version of Oz. However, I would like to point out  the deficient segment where Shane traverses into the basement. There's  nothing remotely close going on in there to what people have described or  refused to describe. This was THE basement, people. Just watch the  documentary and you'll see many a celebrity raise an eyebrow when asked  about what went on down there. I kept wishing that the director would give  a more informative lead into the sordid activity that was rumored to have  occurred. I guess that, like other things, should remain reasonably  confidential...",968198400,4,4197,5.034985422740525

But, alas, someone got  nervous and added these horrible scenes, and cut the heart out of the film.  They beefed up Neve's role, which was bad, beefed up Mike Myers role, which  he played well but it just didn't work, and just plain messed up the movie.

 The only redeeming  feature is Mike Myers portrayal as Steve Rubell, the twisted, manipulative  and machiavellian club owner who has no redeeming features whatever. He is  the worst of his genre and makes no apologies for it. His boast that  ""54"" is the only place where royalty and commoner can dance  without social barriers rings untrue when he pointedly makes it so hard for  the common people to get in.

When you try to mix  fiction (the above characters) in with fact (Steve Rubell and the Studio 54  legend), it mucks up what could've been a great movie. The movie should  have concentrated its script on what Studio 54 was. Rather than showing  Philippe getting it on with Sela Ward (Poor Sela must've been hard up to  get this role) and trying to score with Campbell. Don't get me wrong, it  was an okay film. It's just that a whole lot of potential was wasted on a  fictional story (a la Titanic), rather than dealing with the facts.

992271,4,6305210144,"During the seventies, the 54 studio was the most famous, celebrated and disputed disco around in New York. It was the house of the polemic Steve Rubell, a man willing to satisfy his rich customers' desiree, influential  people such as Gore Vidal and Princess Grace. 54 , an original and  interesting drama, is almost a documentary of the hot and sensual nights  placed inside the club,but it also narrates Shane's saga, a youth who sees  in the disco the chance of a life time in stablishing himself as a  respectable and powerful person, and the plot narrates the ascension and  the decadence of Shane, Rubell, the 54 and of the seventies fever. Very  similar to Boogie Nights (although inferior), this drama delivers great  surprises,  like Mike Meyers's dramatic and talented performance,  unrecognizable as the homosexual and crazed Rubell. With strong moments  and, per times, explicit and shocking scenes, the filmmaker Mark  Christopher demonstrates courage and daring in his craft. Christopher knows  that the basic elements of the story are dangerous and may mean the film's  failure(drugs, sex) but, instead of attenuating the explosive issues, he  explores them in a realistic and direct way, and this is evident in  memorable minutes (Ryan Phillippe and Sela Ward have the most difficult  part) . For those who want to see a vigorous drama about the violence, the  madness, the pleasures and the drugs that marked the seventies, 54 is a  great option.

992325,2,6305210144,"It's always disappointing to realize, halfway through a movie, that you have no idea what it's about.  On the surface, ""54"" seems to be straightforward enough: it tells the story of a legendary '70s Manhattan  nightclub, a place so trendy that the doorman refused admission to nine out  of every ten people who tried to get inside.  Simply being seen at the club  could get you invited into an elite social circle, which included not only  royalty, but the biggest celebrities of the day... and for those lucky  enough to gain entrance, drugs and sex were free for the asking.
  Unfortunately, unsure of where to take this concept, ""54""  degenerates into a muddled mass, remaining cool and aloof from the viewer  for the majority of its running time.
  Shane (Ryan Phillippe) is a  teenager with a crush on soap-opera star Julie Black (Neve Campbell).  When  a newspaper article reports that Julie has been spotted at the nightclub  several times, the handsome but dim-witted Shane pays a visit.  Gaining  admission via his rugged good looks, he manages to land a job as a busboy,  eventually working his way up to bartender.
  The club's owner, Steve  Rubell (""Wayne's World"" creator Mike Myers, in a highly-touted  dramatic role), is a drug addict who runs the nightclub his way, with  little regard for the consequences of his actions.  (In a  nationally-televised interview, for example, Rubell cheerfully admits that  he lies to the IRS about how much money the club makes.)  His is a world of  pills, music, and regrets, none of which are easily remembered the next  day.
  This had the potential to be an interesting story, but the  execution is, alas, very clumsy.  The script is unfocused; it doesn't  really succeed at conveying either the excitement of the era, or any  indication why the club was so highly regarded.  It's ""The Last Days  of Disco"" meets ""Boogie Nights,"" with all the high-points  somehow lost along the way.
  But whatever flaws the film may have, they  are not the fault of Myers; indeed, so convincing is his performance that  all thoughts of Wayne Campbell and Austin Powers were forever purged from  my mind.  Myers knows that Rubell is not a hero; he's just a junkie trying  to get by the best way he knows how, and he plays the role accordingly.  I  have new respect for his abilities as an actor.
  In fact, Myers is so  good that the film suffers when he's not on the screen.  Although the  character of Rubell is intriguing, he's reduced to a relatively small part.  Considering that nearly all the events which happen in the movie  (including an IRS audit of the club and the death of a patron) would  significantly affect his character, it's surprising that he's given so  little screen time in comparison to the exceedingly bland Shane.  Ryan  Phillippe seems to be sleep-walking through his role, mumbling his lines  and showing little interest in any of the remarkable things that happen to  him.  Neve Campbell turns in her usual competent performance, but the  script never allows her to become a ""real"" person.  She remains  just another face passing briefly through Shane's life.  This is one of the  most disappointing facets of the story: getting to know the  ""real"" person behind the Famous Actress persona that Julie wears  should be fascinating; instead, it comes off as trite.
  The movie  succeeds, however, at capturing the claustrophobic feel of a crowded  nightclub.  Nearly every scene is ""lit"" only by neon signs or  disco strobe lights.  The grainy, underexposed look which results from this  method of shooting is just right.  The music is also well-chosen, capturing  the feel of the late '70s.  Rubell's spoken introductions to many of the  songs are also quite amusing.  An ""A+"" for atmosphere, but alas,  that alone doesn't make a great film.
  ""54"" isn't horrible,  but it steps all over itself while attempting to convey a story.  Rather  than needing MORE plot, the film should've dropped its superfluous elements  and focused on its most interesting storyline: Steve Rubell's struggle to  keep the club open in the face of adversity.  The film rolls along nicely  during Mike Myers' scenes, but overall it plays out like the disco music  featured on its soundtrack: occasionally pleasant, but ultimately going  nowhere.",930268800,28,4289,4.8835904628331
