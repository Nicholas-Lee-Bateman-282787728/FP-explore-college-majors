8202932,5,B000RXZIKC,"Found this DVD to be entertaining, informative, and objective. It also features an optional commentary track recorded by some of those responsible for it.  Although apparently shot on a budget, this is not obvious when viewing, it was maybe somewhat a ""labor of love"".

Would you sacrifice comfort and volunteer to temporarily relocate your job halfway around the world in a war zone, to bring soldiers some momentary happiness? Support the Comics on Duty folks by checking out this film.",1222300800,,488,5.0875
