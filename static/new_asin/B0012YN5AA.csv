3100081,4,B0012YN5AA,"This was an excellent HBO film for TV with two great actors. I think it  demestraigted how poeple (no matter how rich or poor) have certain basic needs; moreover how far we'll go for fulfullment of those needs. Thesetwo indiviuals came fom different back grounds, but I think they loved each other deeply. They went through many trials in their relationship.

3100082,5,B0012YN5AA,"This beautifully shot and extremely well acted film captures an unlikely friendship at it's heart and eventual co-dependency.  Susan Sarandon is her at her finest and creates a dreaming yet real, vulnerable yet strong and well rounded complex 'Doris' while Ralph Fiennes plays a convincingly complexly dysfunctional butler with nothing but love and adoration for Mrs. Duke.  It's a charming and delightful tale of misfits who find each other and feed each other's insatiable need for love.  Well done.",1220659200,7,501,5.3164556962025316

However, this is a lifeless film, which might have been titled, ""Zombies In Love.""  It went on and on and
on, drab and exhausting to the final, gray, ending.  Or, I should say, it ""expired,"" as did its leading lady.  Two more empty-headed,  befuddled, besotted (with each other and alcohol) bores could not be
found on the planet.  I think it was supposed to be a tragedy, but the true ""tragedy"" was watching it,
because of one's fascination with these two brilliant actors (not the sad sacks they portrayed). Skip this

3100084,5,B0012YN5AA,"HBO must once again be commended for a movie as unexpected and as pleasurable as any seen in recent months, on the big screen or on TV. There is enough in the inspired Sarandon-Fiennes performances to recommend it, in the apt and character-driven dialogue which make this more than your conventional TV bio. There is also Bob Balaban's knowledgeable direction, as well as the choice soundtrack which - both in the jazz instrumentals as in the (unfamiliar-to-me) Peggy Lee: 'I Love the Way You're Breaking My Heart' - becomes as revealing of the characters as does the narrative itself.

Given the expediencies of movie industry, 'Bernard and Doris' regrettably went directly to television. It is unfortunate that many like myself can expect to experience these treasures only by chancing upon them while surfing through cable.",1214006400,,826,5.118518518518519
3100085,5,B0012YN5AA,"Anyone who occasionally listens to NPR or watches PBS has heard those words:""...and from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation...""

Doris Duke was the quintessential poor little rich girl, when at a young age,her millionaire father died,bypassing his wife, and leaving his entire fortune to his only heir,his daughter Doris. The opening credits of BERNARD AND DORIS flit by with newspaper headlines with the highlights of Doris growing up,marrying and divorcing numerous times,bailing Imelda Marcos out of jail for $5M,and news of her fortune growing and growing and growing.

Opening scene has Ms. Duke (a very sassy and played to perfection by Susan Sarandon!)casually dismissing her butler because ""the cantaloupe is TOO cold""...and there it is!...get ready for a rough and interesting ride ahead that will cover the last years of this world class diva when she hires her new butler,Bernard Lafferty (a role chiseled for Ralph Fiennes) and the ""unique"" relationship that they forge against all sound advice. As only Bob Balaban could put such a humorous and touchingly ironic film together (I suppose after working so closely with the Christopher Guest gang lo these past years!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christopher-Guest-Collection-A-Mighty-Wind-Best-in-Show-Waiting-for-Guffman/dp/B0000ALFVF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christopher Guest Collection (A Mighty Wind / Best in Show / Waiting for Guffman)</a>), BERNARD AND DORIS takes two people ,totally from different walks in life,but believe in a common destiny and purpose  and plan to this thing called life.

Sarandon and Fiennes are CONSUMMATE pros in this duet of oddness, and both show phenomenal expression and depth to their characters. Once you meet ""their"" Doris and Bernard you will be hooked into performances that have been IMO absent from both of them of late;but THIS material is just too good for the likes of Sarandon and Fiennes to not rise to the absolute top of their game. They are magic,and the chemistry flows like the wine they guzzle,the pills they pop,the people that they step on and the orchids they repot (while smoking pot!).There is a comfortability with the roles and it shows. That this relationship became speculation in later years after Ms. Duke's ""uncertain"" demise is part of the fun of the guessing about what their understanding was in this dramady from HBO.In fact,any movie that opens with the words'""Some of these events are true...and some are probably not"" makes you chuckle and acknowledge that what you will see is going to be fun....and it is! This is Emmy and Globe material. Don't miss this one. Sarandon and Fiennes play the parts created for them,and you will always remember Bernard and Doris...trust me!",1204416000,41,2755,5.490566037735849
3100086,5,B0012YN5AA,"Having just now watched this movie I find it is still with me. Ralph Fiennes does an amazing and subtle acting job with miniscule changes in factial expression and body language....he is barely there and yet his presence is powerful.  Susan Sarandon is totally believable in the part of Doris Duke and is drawn in, seemingly, into the vortex that is her butler. This movie is ""based on truth"" so one cannot assume a totally factual account of this relationship. It is but an interpretation. As such, I choose to believe that at a certain point in the ""poor little rich girl's"" life she has someone taking care of her in all the ways that matter and maybe for the first time in her life.  Someone who honestly wants to be there for her and not her money. I've kept it on my dvr because I have a feeling I'll want to watch it again and purchase the DVD eventually.

3100087,5,B0012YN5AA,"A story about a cranky, wealthy lady who likes to boss her butler around seemed kind of shaky to me at first.  I mean, it's not the greatest idea for a storyline in the world, and seeing how I can be a little bit picky with how I like my storylines presented in films, I wasn't expecting much.  In the end, it was a movie that deserves credit for at least being a little different from other stories.

I'm not quite sure which kind of person this movie is supposed to be intended for.  In some instances it comes close to being a romantic movie with the woman and the butler eventually falling for each other after they get to know each other a little better.  But then again, the swear words are really extreme in other cases, and the movie's not suitable for everyone as a result.  Some comedy bits were thrown in and work also.

There was a nice twist at the end which I liked, and I can't say I've ever seen anything quite like this before, so the movie is worth watching.",1202515200,7,976,4.21505376344086

3100116,4,B0012YN5AA,"Quite amazing how good Sarandon and Fiennes are in their roles. Sarandon great; Fiennes superb. But the movie is constrained in some ways. All the action takes place on Duke's NJ estate; nothing seen of her other houses in Hawaii and in Rhode Island and in Los Angeles. She moved around a lot and this disguises that. Then no mention of her disastrous adoption late in life of the young woman she later disinherited. At the end when Fiennes injects her with a drug that does her in, no explanation at all. For a full picture one needs to see the story told from a wider perspective, the one done by Lauren Bacall as Duke and Richard Chamberlain as Bernard. There one gets the idea that her MD in LA where she died sent instructions re her care to the bevy of nurses attending her and that he probably ordered a lethal dose of some painkiller to end her agony. Both movies are good. I think the Bacall/Chamberlain has a slight edge.",1366156800,3,931,4.4186046511627906

Dois Duke was a very private woman in her personal life, this leads to a lot of speculation. Most movie's or books on Miss Duke would have us believe that Bernard was at the very least a con man, at worst a murderer. Nothing was ever proven against him, the people who accused him all had an axe to grind. I found this movie a very refreshing change and extremely well done.",1278115200,,620,4.2100840336134455

3100149,4,B0012YN5AA,"If movies with lots of action, movement, and activity are your thing, then BERNARD AND DORIS is not for you.  However, if character-driven dialogue stirs your blood, you need to see this HBO production.  Susan Sarandon and Ralph Fiennes let their considerable talents take over in this very poignant story about companionship and devotion.

Based (loosely) on the life and times of heiress and philanthropist Doris Duke, Sarandon portrays her character as the ultimate cougar--and world's worst employer (the turnover with her personal staff was extraordinary).  Fresh out of rehab, the very fragile Bernard Lafferty (Fiennes) is given a tryout as Duke's personal butler; a special bond is established.  As the years go by Doris and Bernard develop a special affinity and chemistry together--based not on intimacy (Lafferty was gay), but on loyalty and devotion.  Duke is gruff, demanding, often petulant; Lafferty has a tendency to fall off the wagon, over and over; yet both of them continue to fulfill one another's needs for friendship and companionship.  The evolution of their relationship is fascinating to watch.

Sarandon and Fiennes are both riveting; because they are in the bulk of all scenes together they play off one another so naturally the viewer forgets this is make-believe.  While I thoroughly enjoyed BERNARD AND DORIS the story does bog down here and there, then makes up for it by having Bernard go over the top when falling off the wagon, but all things considered these annoyances are trifling.  Relationships matter, and BERNARD AND DORIS proves it.

3100150,5,B0012YN5AA,"I like relationship movies, which is the kind of movie this is.  At the beginning of the film it says that some of the story is true and some not, so I think it's unfair to criticize it, or the characters, for not being true to fact.  At first Doris Duke appears to be really an annoying bitch and drunk, but as time goes on she becomes more and more human and sympathetic.  The good actors really help to make this movie, which I found very interesting.  The scene where Ralph Fiennes is wearing long dangling earrings was brave on his part. Some very deep relationships can develop between women and gay men.  I think this movie shows this.

3100153,3,B0012YN5AA,"An extremely light treatment of the twisted personal life of one of the richest women in American history. This made for TV style bio has some serious star power playing the two leads but beyond that, it portrays miss Duke's life as if she were the shallowest type of gay man....with a 24/7 preoccupation with wildly luxurious living in staffed, overdecorated homes all over the globe, wearing expensive clothes and happily paying for sex with macho men waaaaaay below her ""status""...and angrily throwing them out in the middle of the night for humping HER female help (who also gets the boot)...in the juiciest, funniest, liveliest scene in the melodrama.
Mr. Fienes turns in a most amusing performance as the naturally subservient butler who grows extremely close to the lonely heiress who in turns encourages his inner dandy to come out and in the end, the butler, who is practically wearing Doris Duke drag, gets to manage her estate...with a few millions to spare as a personal gift.
Miss Sarandon, looking very conventionally pretty is totally miscast for being unable to convey the striking physical oddity that set the original woman apart....but she looked like she was having a ball playing Miss Duke.
The sunlit cinematography strikes the right tone of a life as one long vacation in search of self indulgence...lived by two sad souls who found a special bond.",1237420800,,1371,4.965217391304348
3100154,4,B0012YN5AA,"Watching two powerful and exceptionally talented actors play across from each other is something of a marvel, and that is certainly part of what makes BERNARD AND DORIS a great film.

Based around the late history of tobacco heiress Doris Duke (here played beautifully by Susan Sarandon,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-the-Valley-of-Elah/dp/B0011VIODW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In the Valley of Elah</a>) and her close relationship with butler Bernard Lafferty (the phenomenal Ralph Fiennes,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Bruges/dp/B0018BD9DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Bruges</a>), the film is a fictional take on the pair's relationship. Although no one knows what really happened between them, it is obvious that a friendship of unique qualities emerged. And Ralph Fiennes and Susan Sarandon are to be complimented on their astounding performances. Particularly Mr. Fiennes, who seems to turn every role he touches into gold (he did this, too, with his portrayal of The Duke of Devonshire in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Duchess/dp/B001L57ZZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Duchess</a>). That Ms. Duke left millions of dollars under the stewardship of Mr. Lafferty after her death is a documented fact, proving that she trusted him implicitly (Ms. Duke was a very savvy businesswoman).

Some might think that sex had a part to play in it, but that would be a fools mistake because Mr. Lafferty was gay. And Ralph Fiennes plays the part of an early homosexual with perfect subtlety. His blossoming occurs under the keen eye of Doris, and the two give each other what they both need: companionship. It is a touching moment when Doris -- in a flustered state -- yells as Bernard and asks him, ""What do you want from me?!"" To which he simply replies, ""To take care of you."" And that is exactly what Doris needed in her waning years.

As Doris grows older and more ill (a debilitating stroke hits her), Bernard is given the opportunity to truly care for her, and he does so with Doris' final wishes at the forefront (""No one sees Ms. Duke without my permission."") Much of this leads to confrontations with her legal council and those worried about Doris' accumulated wealth. Was Bernard doing as Ms. Duke wished? Or was he just biding his time until Doris died and then pounce on her funds?

Regardless what you believe, Bernard was only given $5 million dollars and the rest he oversaw as a steward of many of Doris Duke's foundations. And upon his death (only a few years after Doris'), he donated all of his remaining money back to the Duke Foundation ...which should put to rest any worries about his motives.

Strangely enough, after this film was shown at a film festival, it was switched from a theatrical release and went straight to cable television. But the bigwigs at the film companies were dead wrong to do that. The performances are stellar and the movie engaging. It has now garnered 10 Emmy nominations (that's a ton!), three Golden Globe nominations, and two Screen Actors Guild nods. Had this movie been released to the general public via theaters, I feel certain it would've garnered even more notice.

At first, I was just disturbed by the movie and talked to my friends about it a lot. I would just call them and text them and they were like, ""OK, will you stop now."" And then I couldn't stop thinking about Ralph Fiennes, my favorite actor ever, in full make up smiling into the camera and I was writing in my journal about it even. Finally, my man said, ""You know, you should talk to someone about this.""
And I said, ""I am. I'm talking to you.""
He said, ""No, I mean you need to see a professional therapist. You need the kind of help I just can't give.""
So I did, I went into therapy for 6 months! I talked and talked about it. The therapist, Kim, she even saw the film on HBO one morning and was somewhat disturbed by it, as well. But she said what bothered her was the music, which she found to be overly dismal.

Doris Duke was the quintessential poor little rich girl, when at a young age,her millionaire father died,bypassing his wife, and leaving his entire fortune to his only heir,his daughter Doris. The opening credits of BERNARD AND DORIS flit by with newspaper headlines with the highlights of Doris growing up,marrying and divorcing numerous times,bailing Imelda Marcos out of jail for $5M,and news of her fortune growing and growing and growing.

Opening scene has Ms. Duke (a very sassy and played to perfection by Susan Sarandon!)casually dismissing her butler because ""the cantaloupe is TOO cold""...and there it is!...get ready for a rough and interesting ride ahead that will cover the last years of this world class diva when she hires her new butler,Bernard Lafferty (a role chiseled for Ralph Fiennes) and the ""unique"" relationship that they forge against all sound advice. As only Bob Balaban could put such a humorous and touchingly ironic film together (I suppose after working so closely with the Christopher Guest gang lo these past years!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christopher-Guest-Collection-A-Mighty-Wind-Best-in-Show-Waiting-for-Guffman/dp/B0000ALFVF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christopher Guest Collection (A Mighty Wind / Best in Show / Waiting for Guffman)</a>), BERNARD AND DORIS takes two people ,totally from different walks in life,but believe in a common destiny and purpose  and plan to this thing called life.

Sarandon and Fiennes are CONSUMMATE pros in this duet of oddness, and both show phenomenal expression and depth to their characters. Once you meet ""their"" Doris and Bernard you will be hooked into performances that have been IMO absent from both of them of late;but THIS material is just too good for the likes of Sarandon and Fiennes to not rise to the absolute top of their game. They are magic,and the chemistry flows like the wine they guzzle,the pills they pop,the people that they step on and the orchids they repot (while smoking pot!).There is a comfortability with the roles and it shows. That this relationship became speculation in later years after Ms. Duke's ""uncertain"" demise is part of the fun of the guessing about what their understanding was in this dramady from HBO.In fact,any movie that opens with the words'""Some of these events are true...and some are probably not"" makes you chuckle and acknowledge that what you will see is going to be fun....and it is! This is Emmy and Globe material. Don't miss this one. Sarandon and Fiennes play the parts created for them,and you will always remember Bernard and Doris...trust me!",1204416000,41,2755,5.490566037735849

Ralph Fiennes does an amazing and subtle acting job with miniscule changes in factial expression and body language....he is barely there and yet his presence is powerful.  Susan Sarandon is totally believable in the part of Doris Duke and is drawn in, seemingly, into the vortex that is her butler. This movie is ""based on truth"" so one cannot assume a totally factual account of this relationship. It is but an interpretation. As such, I choose to believe that at a certain point in the ""poor little rich girl's"" life she has someone taking care of her in all the ways that matter and maybe for the first time in her life.  Someone who honestly wants to be there for her and not her money. I've kept it on my dvr because I have a feeling I'll want to watch it again and purchase the DVD eventually.

I mean, it's not the greatest idea for a storyline in the world, and seeing how I can be a little bit picky with how I like my storylines presented in films, I wasn't expecting much.  In the end, it was a movie that deserves credit for at least being a little different from other stories.

I'm not quite sure which kind of person this movie is supposed to be intended for.  In some instances it comes close to being a romantic movie with the woman and the butler eventually falling for each other after they get to know each other a little better.  But then again, the swear words are really extreme in other cases, and the movie's not suitable for everyone as a result.  Some comedy bits were thrown in and work also.

There was a nice twist at the end which I liked, and I can't say I've ever seen anything quite like this before, so the movie is worth watching.",1202515200,7,976,4.21505376344086

3334613,4,B0012YN5AA,"Quite amazing how good Sarandon and Fiennes are in their roles. Sarandon great; Fiennes superb. But the movie is constrained in some ways. All the action takes place on Duke's NJ estate; nothing seen of her other houses in Hawaii and in Rhode Island and in Los Angeles. She moved around a lot and this disguises that. Then no mention of her disastrous adoption late in life of the young woman she later disinherited. At the end when Fiennes injects her with a drug that does her in, no explanation at all. For a full picture one needs to see the story told from a wider perspective, the one done by Lauren Bacall as Duke and Richard Chamberlain as Bernard. There one gets the idea that her MD in LA where she died sent instructions re her care to the bevy of nurses attending her and that he probably ordered a lethal dose of some painkiller to end her agony.

Dois Duke was a very private woman in her personal life, this leads to a lot of speculation.

However, if character-driven dialogue stirs your blood, you need to see this HBO production.  Susan Sarandon and Ralph Fiennes let their considerable talents take over in this very poignant story about companionship and devotion.

Based (loosely) on the life and times of heiress and philanthropist Doris Duke, Sarandon portrays her character as the ultimate cougar--and world's worst employer (the turnover with her personal staff was extraordinary).  Fresh out of rehab, the very fragile Bernard Lafferty (Fiennes) is given a tryout as Duke's personal butler; a special bond is established.  As the years go by Doris and Bernard develop a special affinity and chemistry together--based not on intimacy (Lafferty was gay), but on loyalty and devotion.  Duke is gruff, demanding, often petulant; Lafferty has a tendency to fall off the wagon, over and over; yet both of them continue to fulfill one another's needs for friendship and companionship.  The evolution of their relationship is fascinating to watch.

Sarandon and Fiennes are both riveting; because they are in the bulk of all scenes together they play off one another so naturally the viewer forgets this is make-believe.  While I thoroughly enjoyed BERNARD AND DORIS the story does bog down here and there, then makes up for it by having Bernard go over the top when falling off the wagon, but all things considered these annoyances are trifling.  Relationships matter, and BERNARD AND DORIS proves it.

3334647,5,B0012YN5AA,"I like relationship movies, which is the kind of movie this is.  At the beginning of the film it says that some of the story is true and some not, so I think it's unfair to criticize it, or the characters, for not being true to fact.  At first Doris Duke appears to be really an annoying bitch and drunk, but as time goes on she becomes more and more human and sympathetic.  The good actors really help to make this movie, which I found very interesting.  The scene where Ralph Fiennes is wearing long dangling earrings was brave on his part. Some very deep relationships can develop between women and gay men.  I think this movie shows this.

3334650,3,B0012YN5AA,"An extremely light treatment of the twisted personal life of one of the richest women in American history. This made for TV style bio has some serious star power playing the two leads but beyond that, it portrays miss Duke's life as if she were the shallowest type of gay man....with a 24/7 preoccupation with wildly luxurious living in staffed, overdecorated homes all over the globe, wearing expensive clothes and happily paying for sex with macho men waaaaaay below her ""status""...and angrily throwing them out in the middle of the night for humping HER female help (who also gets the boot)...in the juiciest, funniest, liveliest scene in the melodrama.
Mr. Fienes turns in a most amusing performance as the naturally subservient butler who grows extremely close to the lonely heiress who in turns encourages his inner dandy to come out and in the end, the butler, who is practically wearing Doris Duke drag, gets to manage her estate...with a few millions to spare as a personal gift.
Miss Sarandon, looking very conventionally pretty is totally miscast for being unable to convey the striking physical oddity that set the original woman apart....but she looked like she was having a ball playing Miss Duke.
The sunlit cinematography strikes the right tone of a life as one long vacation in search of self indulgence...lived by two sad souls who found a special bond.",1237420800,,1371,4.965217391304348
3334651,4,B0012YN5AA,"Watching two powerful and exceptionally talented actors play across from each other is something of a marvel, and that is certainly part of what makes BERNARD AND DORIS a great film.

Based around the late history of tobacco heiress Doris Duke (here played beautifully by Susan Sarandon,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-the-Valley-of-Elah/dp/B0011VIODW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In the Valley of Elah</a>) and her close relationship with butler Bernard Lafferty (the phenomenal Ralph Fiennes,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Bruges/dp/B0018BD9DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Bruges</a>), the film is a fictional take on the pair's relationship. Although no one knows what really happened between them, it is obvious that a friendship of unique qualities emerged. And Ralph Fiennes and Susan Sarandon are to be complimented on their astounding performances. Particularly Mr. Fiennes, who seems to turn every role he touches into gold (he did this, too, with his portrayal of The Duke of Devonshire in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Duchess/dp/B001L57ZZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Duchess</a>). That Ms. Duke left millions of dollars under the stewardship of Mr. Lafferty after her death is a documented fact, proving that she trusted him implicitly (Ms. Duke was a very savvy businesswoman).

Some might think that sex had a part to play in it, but that would be a fools mistake because Mr. Lafferty was gay. And Ralph Fiennes plays the part of an early homosexual with perfect subtlety. His blossoming occurs under the keen eye of Doris, and the two give each other what they both need: companionship. It is a touching moment when Doris -- in a flustered state -- yells as Bernard and asks him, ""What do you want from me?!"" To which he simply replies, ""To take care of you."" And that is exactly what Doris needed in her waning years.

As Doris grows older and more ill (a debilitating stroke hits her), Bernard is given the opportunity to truly care for her, and he does so with Doris' final wishes at the forefront (""No one sees Ms. Duke without my permission."") Much of this leads to confrontations with her legal council and those worried about Doris' accumulated wealth. Was Bernard doing as Ms. Duke wished? Or was he just biding his time until Doris died and then pounce on her funds?

Regardless what you believe, Bernard was only given $5 million dollars and the rest he oversaw as a steward of many of Doris Duke's foundations. And upon his death (only a few years after Doris'), he donated all of his remaining money back to the Duke Foundation ...which should put to rest any worries about his motives.

Strangely enough, after this film was shown at a film festival, it was switched from a theatrical release and went straight to cable television. But the bigwigs at the film companies were dead wrong to do that. The performances are stellar and the movie engaging. It has now garnered 10 Emmy nominations (that's a ton!), three Golden Globe nominations, and two Screen Actors Guild nods. Had this movie been released to the general public via theaters, I feel certain it would've garnered even more notice.

She didn't have a wonderful childhood and could be cruel but underneath it all she was a caring person who seemed to care about the underdogs. Many homes in Newport still stand today due to Doris and her good work. She set up many different foundations that continue to help those in need all these years later. The movie does not touch upon her philanthropy as much as it shows what a special person she truly was. Her relationship with her butler Bernard was a very special one. Doris was a character and I believe the people who knew her must have had some wonderful times together with her. This is a great movie, with two wonderful actors and its worth seeing.
