8610382,5,B00EYO7GVY,"Shooting for Home tells the story of a brilliant high school basketball player from a dysfunctional family.  For Kevin Bradshaw, opportunity was fleeting and timing was wrong. We follow the arc of Kevin's difficult early adulthood and his return to basketball as a top Navy player. Civilian life takes him to the basketball courts of Israel, where, lonely and depressed, he finds strength in true love and family. This is definitely a life worth watching. I highly recommend it.",1386460800,,478,5.050632911392405
