8725107,3,B011TQQUUM,"Despite being half the price of Arthaus'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Britten-Gloriana/dp/B000I2IUM0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Britten - Gloriana</a>, this one is visually inferior, with images that are frequently blurry ... or intermittently blurry but sufficiently so as to cause considerable annoyance. The performance itself is miles ahead of its Covent Garden competitor (with Susan Bullock as Good Queen Bess). Unless you count bootleg recordings with Christine Brewer, Sarah Walker (Arthaus) has not been surpassed in the title role and this English National Opera production goes from strength to strength, even in the tertiary roles. Elizabeth Vaughan's strident Lady Penelope Rich is as close as it comes to having a drawback, but Vaughan's sound and delivery befit the arrogant courtier's character. Anthony Rolfe Johnson was never finer than as the smoldering Earl of Essex (given a worthy consort in Jean Rigby's Lady Essex) and he has superb chemistry with Walker, whose voice has both the dramatic-mezzo heft for the role and the intelligence to gives us quicksilver insights into Queen Elizabeth's complex personality. Alan Opie (Cecil), Richard Van Allan (Raleigh), Norman Bailey (Ballad Singer) ... the pillars of strengths extend all the way down to Lynda Russell's Lady-in-Waiting, given a lovely Act III solo by Britten, and Adrian Martin's Spirit of the Masque. In truth, Bailey's voice hasn't quite the depth for a bass role, but his diction and astute phrasing are second to none. Mark Elder conducts a taut and, at times, crushingly powerful reading. So by all means get this performance ... just skip the Blu-Ray edition, whose bargain price is no compensation for an inferior video transfer.",1460937600,,1765,5.714828897338403
8725108,5,B011TQQUUM,"This wonderful production of the vastly underrated Britten opera, Gloriana, is yet one more reason to avoid the Royal Opera House video of their recent production.  I wrote a review.  Feel free to read my specifics, but two words will suffice to any wanting a production of the work: avoid it! This 1984 English National Operas production of Brittens grand opera is now available in an impressive blu-ray edition that should satisfy all Britten fans looking to own a video.  It has many many pluses, and very few minuses, which makes it an essential addition to the collection of 20th Century opera fans in general.

Quickly: the opera itself has been the victim of misunderstanding and fiction sold as truth.  The first production was sold out.  The critics were more favorable than not.  Only after the fact, did a few carping voices complain.  Most of them were anti- anything Britten; they used this as an excuse to try to derail his success.  Some were overtly homophobic.  The young Queen Elizabeth II enjoyed the opera very much.  She saw it live and listened to it on the radio.  She never felt insulted, as some would later claim.  Peter Pears had no problems with the role of Essex, nor did he get terrible reviews.  It was revived more than once over the years, including a very successful production roughly a decade later, with Peter Pears singing the role he originated, and Sylvia Fisher as Elizabeth I (which Britten enthusiasts will recognize from Brittens own recording of Albert Herring.) With every revival, the appreciation for the work seemed to grow. A radio broadcast exits. You might try online to see if it is available somewhere.  Any lingering doubts dissipate about Pears.  I haven't heard the recording of the original production, which is available in Europe. I wish I had! The reason this masterpiece went unrecorded had nothing to do with quality, but with cost.  (I don't have room to prove it is a masterpiece, so I hope youll just take my word for it and get it!)  The forces needed are massive.  This is the largest orchestra Britten used for an opera.  A huge chorus is required.  He seems to have patterned the work as a personal response to the 19th Century French grand opera forms, including a ballet. To place it in perspective, the (uncut) five act version of Verdis Don Carlo was not recorded until 1962.  This has become the standard version.  A decade would pass before Verdis complete original French version was heard, at that on a small label. And this is a major work by Verdi!  Don Carlos has 11 singing roles, some just a few notes.  Gloriana has 15, none of which have just a few notes.  A video of a complete version in performance was the most cost effective way to present it.  (It would finally get an outstanding studio audio recording in the 1990's: a highlight of the Britten opera discography.)

The action of the performance takes place on a modified Elizabethan theater design.  The libretto is respected.  What is in the text is on the stage. The action flows quickly, with a few set pieces that can be moved on and off in seconds, and stairs and side exits that help the huge crowd scenes dissipate unencumbered.  To avoid monotony, drapes, flagsplus a giant rose meant to represent Elizabeth Ifly in and out. Ornaments such as giant garlands are held by people on stage, adding some brightness to a gray set.  Because of the paucity of design, lighting becomes a more primary concern.  It more than serves the action, yet is (mostly) unobtrusive.  When it calls attention to itself, such as the end of the opera, it surprises rather than irritates.  Likewise, the costumes are of vital importance, and their rich color, design, and variety are well-contrasted with their simple surroundings.

The staging is traditional in the best sense: sensible movements, clear intentions, unobtrusive shifts in  action, and great use of the entire space.  The stage is a large one, which allows the huge chorus to be present but never overwhelm the important focus.  It occasionally means a few notes here and there land off-microphone, but so few, they are instantly forgotten.  One drawback is that virtually none of the text sung by the chorus is intelligible, though that is true of many operas and their productions.  The chorus is one of the good-bad issues with this performance.  The forces are ample.  The shear sound of them is just what one would hope to hear.  Unfortunately, they are obviously under rehearsed.  They have a couple of false starts, approximate entrances, muddy stops.  Plus, they have an occasional pitch problem.  But those issues are indeed occasional, not continual.  (Luckily, the studio recording of the piece has marvelous choral work.  One of the benefits of retakes.)

Which leads to the most important hindrance to widespread acceptance that, happily, this blu--ray rectifies: knowing the text.  Short of multiple hearings, subtitles or librettos are necessary for complete surrender to most operas, and this recording in particular, since many words cannot be understood.  Truthfully, it is Brittens ""fault"" more than the singers.  Befitting a grand opera, he has composed numerous duets, trios, quartets, and massive crowd scenes, rife with competing musical lines and poetic texts.  He didn't expect everything to be understood, any more than Verdi did in his masterpiece.  Luckily, the DVD subtitles are in English, German, French, and Italian.  I only used the English, which did truncate some lines to allow them to fit speedy music.  Only a pedant would complain.

Everything else is a positive.  First, and foremost, is Sarah Walker as Elizabeth I.  She sings with beauty, variety, emotion, musicality, character, and mostly excellent diction.  To top it off, she is a brilliant actress.  Here is Gloriana in all her myriad facets.  Of course, she was acting for a large house, not the cameras.  This was not like today, when the singers are aware that a camera is just a few feet away. Though subtleties abound, it is a grand style of performing.  Yet I find her captivating and moving.  If you buy this for no other reason, Walker is worth the purchase. With the cleaned-up stereo sound, her voice glows in all its myriad colors.

Anthony Rolfe Johnson is better as Essex than I remember.  (I had a video many years ago.)  He can sing with beauty, emotion, and volatility, though I must admit, he does seem to force out a note or two which should ring naturally.  This is true of much operatic singing throughout recorded historyeven if some do not want to admit that golden age singers showed strainso Im just bringing it up because it is a part of the performance and should be mentioned.  I wasn't bothered in the slightest.  Thankfully, his acting is not the opera clich of just stand and wave your arms.  The gifted stage director here, Colin Graham, may have played a big part in avoiding such tired conventions.  Rolfe Johnson is not quite in Walkers class, but his role doesnt offer those possibilities.  His complex relationship with his queen is there in note and line and gesture, so Sarah Walker has a worthy partner in their personal drama.  Without a convincing central conflict, the opera fails.  Though the tenor recorded several Britten roles, I find him the most convincing in this. The Second Lute Song (Happy Were He) is sung beautifully.  When it comes back in his final scenewith the change of words to Happy were weit breaks your heart.  If it doesnt, the entire opera has failed, because the heart of the opera is the doomed love of Elizabeth for Essex.

Another huge plus is the quality of singers in all the parts, even some with only one short scene.  The other men in the cast are of an excitingly high quality, taken from the best of what England had to offer at the time. Even the old blind singer is taken by the great Norman Bailey. Women have fewer opportunities, but they all shine.  Both Jean Rigby, as wife to Essex, and Elizabeth Vaughan, as mistress to Neil Howlett's Mountjoy, are contrasted enough that this important quartet has specificity that too much opera misses. But truly, all the parts are covered well. Special mention to me is Lynda Russell as the Lady-in-Waiting.  She has one scene and one glorious solo with chorus, yet her beautiful voice and expert musicality stays with you.

Of course, all of this would be undermined by poor conducting and playing. This production scores high on both accounts.  The orchestra at ENO during this period was not always as polished as one might want, but no issues arise here.  The players are exemplary: from important solos to trumpet calls to full orchestral blasts.  They play as one, under the mastery of Mark Elder.  He helped raise the level of ENO, assuring it of a future when some minds were convinced it had lost its purpose.  Alas, issues have always arisen with this company, including the chorus problems taking place now.  Lets hope it stays afloat, unlike the bemoaned New York City Opera, which had a similar function in American culture.

The recording itself is remarkably good for the time and place it was filmed.  The picture is clear, the stereo sound clean, if without a wide separation.  The voices come across with no serious problems. The full company at full voice is mostly a wall of sound with less depth than a modern recording could accomplish, but thats being particularly nitpicky.

Overall, a magnificent, if traditional, treatment of an under-appreciated work. But any enthusiast must have the Mackerras-conducted recording with Josephine Barstow and Philip Langridge.  Barstow may not have as controlled or as beautiful a voice as Walker, but she acts with, and through, the music in an inimitable way. And Langridge is the great Britten tenor interpreter, second only to Pears (in my humble opinion.)  Have I made it clear you need to buy that one, too? :)",1455926400,12,9887,4.832042882668255
