811281,5,6304235615,"NOTE: The 5 STAR rating goes not to the film, but to whoever it was who got it financed. You are the TRUE star of the movie!
Final Justice is the touching and at times tearjerking story of a big fat Texas deputy sherriff who orders MYLANTA at every restauraunt and bar he goes in to. There won't be a dry eye in the house. At least there wasn't when the films producers saw the final edit! This low budget film looks like it was shot on bad 16mm, and is proof that no matter how bad your screenplay is, there is someone, somewhere willing to put up the money and make it into a picture. A true inspiration to us all!",993600000,,616,4.057377049180328
811282,3,6304235615,"*That was one of the best last lines ever said in a movie!
I saw this on MST3K(hence my nickname)and it was one of the worst ones I have ever seen(made for a funny ... episode). A stupid plot(portly sheriff who says ""Son of a..."" a lot goes to Malta for no reason), bad acting, and  shoddy scenery. Seems strange that a movie this bad is on DVD. If you like  to see a movie where a main character gets out of bed in the same way over  and over, and where a man gets shot TWICE in the same scene, get this  movie. Or else you can watch it when it reruns again on MST3K.
PS: One  star for how bad it is, another one for Best Brains for having the guts for  air this, and another one for them making fun of how bad it is.

811283,4,6304235615,"Where to start?Well, big fat Texan cop goes to Malta for no adaquetly explored reason. He then gets involved in some kind of 'mystery', spends  about three weeks chasing around the back streets of Malta five feet from  the bad guys. I agree with the guy above, bad movie. The extra stars go to  Best Brains for the MST3K version of this movie that I saw.",940896000,,354,4.333333333333333

7865173,1,6304235615,"Joe Don Baker (cowboy hat and all) outdoes himself in this ridiculous action romp that takes our gun-toting hero from Texas to Malta! A genuine hoot, ""Final Justice"" reeks of bad dialogue, clumsy self-parody and B-movie clichs. Ideal six-pack cinema from the 1980s.

OVERALL RATING: *",1483228800,,284,5.173913043478261
7865174,3,6304235615,Ok it's a bad but entertaining movie mostly laughable there's a lot of nudity which I don't really mind and it's about time you hear the curses but it's still pretty bad I was a curious guy and I don't regret buying this as much if I bought ted but if you want to check it out I could careless but if not good move,1410480000,,314,3.8461538461538463
7865175,4,6304235615,"Good movie for the poor 1980's decade, but a bit far fetched. Some good topless.  Could have done without the F word.",1369526400,,117,4.318181818181818
7865176,1,6304235615,I saw parts of this movie way back when on TV. I just now saw it on Amazon and ordered it. The movie cannot make up its mind if it is a low budget T/A film or a action film. I guess Joe Don Baker was hard up for money to agree to make this. Pass this one by.,1358726400,,258,3.389830508474576
7865177,4,6304235615,"Man, oh man, where to start....Like most of the reviewers, I first saw this movie on Mystery Science Theater, the season SciFi made them switch to all SciFi movies. Did this movie cause them to be cancelled? Who knows. I DO know that this is an amazing movie: Car chases! Boat chases! Church chases! Float chases!

Before I get into who is who, it needs to be stated at the outset that the real star of this movie is the gorgeous island of Malta.  And, the movie does everything in its power to show off the island: Ancient churches, harbors, forts and of course the blue waters of the Mediterranean all are on display at various points.  You know, if I could get a certified letter from the Maltese government promising that Joe Don would not be on the island, I might actually go.

The plot sort of focuses on a flatulent, murder-obsessed Texas deputy played by Joe Don Baker and his oh-so hot side-kick: a black-eyed, raven haired Maltese beauty whose name escapes me (Helena Abella?). HOT, I SAY! Anyway, they are in Malta tracking a bad, bad Italian that killed Joe-Don's partner, and in return Joe-Don killed the Italian's brother and then the Italian's flunkies arranged for the plane he and Joe-Don were on to land in Malta and that's the back-story. The dvd is great, because all the dancers that you see on stage on MST3K are here and they are all NAKED! Yes! But, Joe-Don's partner is not naked. NO! Well, it's true and this thing was made in 1980-something, so it's too late now. Anyway, if you want ACTION, if you want ADVENTURE, if you want THRILLS, CHILLS and lots of high-fat sauce SPILLS...you just ""go ahead on"" and buy FINAL JUSTICE!!!!!!

By the way, if you are interested in Malta, see my review of another Maltese-filmed epic, ""BLACK EAGLE"" which actually features some of the actors that were in this movie!",1124841600,3,1830,4.584097859327217
7865178,5,6304235615,"This is one great action movie!!! The great quirky casting of Joe Don Baker(Walking Tall,Goldeneye,Joysticks,Cool Hand Luke,In The Heat Of The Night TV Series),Bill McKinney(Deliverance,Lots of Eastwood films!),Rossano Brazzi(The Christmas That Amost Wasn't)and director of the film Greydon Clark appears as a sheriff makes this one cool movie,despite not having much of a plot!!! Critics didn't like this film but I did!!! And the DVD version from Digital Versatile Disc Ltd. looks so much better than those old VHS tapes out there!!! Sure it's a bit grainy, but thats the way it was shot!!! A great drive-in movie finally getting reissued on DVD!!!",1072569600,2,650,5.320388349514563
7865179,5,6304235615,"I loved this MST3K episode.  It's great fun, poking fun of a great B-actor, Joe Don Baker.  As Tom Servo puts it, ""Awww, can't I have just one more justice?""",1018310400,3,157,4.2

7865181,5,6304235615,"I know, I know watching Joe Don Baker movies are worse for your health than smoking two packs of unfiltered cigarettes. So let's see if I can summerize what is going on in the movie. After about twelve times I admit I'm still lost but I'll try anyways.  Deputy Sheriff Geronimo (Pronounced Her-an-Emo because the blue eyed 6'1 white guy is of course really Indian presumably Cherokee) is a rouge edged Deputy somewhere in Texas along the border between Mexico who shoots some Malatan Man after the shoot up some undescribed place. Our Deputy chases both men into mexico after one of them shoots the real sheriff. Alright,
Ok a small piece of unreality number one: Our AMERICAN DEPUTY SHERIFF crosses the border illegally, after they show them their DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY (Glad they just hand those out to any Maltans that come across the border!)and HE SHOOTS ONE, never mind that he's on foreign soil and he shoots a guy with diplomatic immunity, which happens to be the brother of a drug lord who is ALSO THERE. He throws a gun towards one of them and tells them to DRAW... what the hell? Ok maybe I'm not a cop and have never been in law enforcment but I would think that common sense would dictate that after you shoot the brother of a powerful drug lord who has diplomatic immunity none the less while on foreign soil I wouldn't throw a gun in his direction and egg him on with an almost drunken cult chant of ""Draw, Draw you son of a B*tch"". This guy would be working at the mall getting the extra $1.00 an hour after taking that Orange Julius attack meant for the Sears manager. So after the guy who's brother just died  doesn't pick up the gun but allows himself to be beaten up by our 300 lbs Indian friend.
After destroying about 20 different treaties and obvious police brutality the FBI yes you heard me right one of our top agencies here in the states decides to let our deputy escort that same powerful drug lord back to Malta because I guess they wouldn't like to go to the the socialist paradise of Malta during the summer.  Oh never mind this movie just has Joe Don Baker trying to pull a ""Linda Evans"" with some reporter and the key stone cops of the Mediterranean trying to stop him while he rants about ""Drawing on Sum ""B*tches"" and some unknown incident concerning him, I guess something bad happened.
But However as much as I loathe Joe Don Baker, I love his movies and have to give this 5 stars!!!",995068800,7,2418,4.45372460496614
