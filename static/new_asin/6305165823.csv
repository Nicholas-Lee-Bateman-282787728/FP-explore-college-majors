974152,5,6305165823,"My wife and I enjoyed this film. It's a good show to watch to fan the flames of passion. The movie is about a farm girl from the mid west. She graduates law school and gets picked up by a law firm in New York and is immediately send to Rio De Janerio on assignment with her new boss. While in Rio, surrounded by a sexually charged culture, she begins to discover her own sexuality. There are a number of steamy hot love/sex scenes. For the most part it's well acted, well written, well directed. Carr Otis isn't particularly believable as a young attorney.  But what she lacks in that department, she makes up for in the beautiful and sexy girl from the mid west department!",1498521600,4,674,4.349206349206349

974467,3,6305165823,"For whatever reason, there's something I like enough about this movie. I've owned a copy since it was on LaserDisc, but my player is deceased and I gave my LaserDisc away. Since then I've hoped that a Blu ray was in the works, but it wasn't until about May 2015 that I found that my hope had become a reality.

I won't bother with a review of the movie itself, others here have reviewed it, and I expect it's the kind of movie you either like or don't like. I've read all of the reviews of the Blu ray version of Wild Orchid here, and there's one thing no one has made any mention of, at least that I've seen, and that's the horrible lip-sync in the first approx. 50 minutes of the movie. It's like watching an english-dubbed version of a Japanese Godzilla movie, and I'm shocked that no one else has pointed this out. I began to think that maybe I got a defective run of the Blu rays, so I went online and searched for reviews from other sources and immediately found this issue mentioned. From bluray dot highdefdigest dot com:

""There's one audio track, English DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0, and there's a potential deal breaker: The audio is around two frames early/out of sync until 50:37. Your tolerance for this discrepancy may be better or worse than mine. At 50:37, a complete one-frame dropout occurs at a cut, and the sync restores itself to normal until the end of the film. Aside from these issues, the audio is below average at best. The dialogue is mixed way too low, and the SFX as well as the music are too high in proportion.""

Also mentioned:

""The video on this release is a 1:85 AVC encode. The presentation throughout is poor. The image is extremely noisy, look at any blue skyline and it's swimming in large patterns of pixels. One scene of beachwash was almost indecipherable, with textures breaking up. Film scratches, stains, spots, and other source-based anomalies exist throughout, mostly on exterior sequences, and are ugly to look at. Interior sequences fair better. The detail is good in most close-ups, and one particular scene showing a cigarette showed fine texture. Contrast throughout is average at best; most blacks look to be a dark gray.""

I have to agree with everything the reviewer Eric Bennett said. This is a bad, amateurish transfer. Little or no cleaning was done and it appears that no restoration was done to the film. Eric Bennett is wrong about the lip-sync, it's off further than 2 frames- other than that, his review is quite accurate, and I recommend you read it. The only thing you can say about the quality is that it's better than nothing.

Whether you like Wild Orchid or not (and I do like it) this movie deserves a lot better than it got- it's story is told largely in pictures, in an exotic and beautiful part of the world (which I have seen first-hand) and the effort that was made to capture that on film has been largely negated by the lack of attention to the technical quality of the transfer. For me it was a must-have, but it makes me sad when I see what Olive Films has done to it.",1468627200,6,3044,4.495479204339964

974629,2,6305165823,"Carr Otis/Emily Reed is a gorgeous young lawyer, who is hired at an international firm, and one of her first assignments is a purchase of a hotel.  She flies with to South American with senior attorney, Claudia Dennis/Jacqueline Dennis.

Unfortunately, though the film tries to make it seem like Emily/Otis is intrigued, she has no chemistry with Mickey Rourke/James, who come off sleazy and trying too hard to be cool.  Emily's need for him never seems genuine - though the two marry in real life - it seems as if Otis only appeared naked in this film for either a lot of money or for the advancement of her career or for both.  But not once did I feel her affections for James/Rourke genuine.  Her seduction - her need for him -totally warped her character.

I knew this film's aim was not supposed to be great, but I wanted it at least plausible.  At the bare minimum, at least appeal to the prurient interest.

But the film was never sexy, and Carr Otis had more heat with Bruce Greenwood than Mickey Rourke.

I didn't understand this film.  Obviously, it was purely of James/ Rourke's fantasy.  He never came off at well.  His creepy voiceover of a couple fighting in a cab was creepy at best.  I blame the flaws of the character on the writing and direction, and not on the actor.

Poor Carr Otis deserved better.  She just looked like she was taken advantage of.",1445040000,,1369,4.508130081300813

974632,5,6305165823,"If you want a traditional flick with many plot twists keeping you wondering - this is not for you. If you want art, something that touches you in an erogenous way, then this movie rocks - It's a reflection of the time. Still, time capsules that affect you intuitively are always relevant. It's like a hip sexy pulsating epic. A surreal ride - maybe similar to Apacolypto - with eroticism rather than blood. If you live only in your head - you won't get it... Best pass. But if you can feel a movie - this one is for you.",1442707200,,520,4.21

975012,5,6305165823,"One of my favorite Mickey Rourke films.  It's highly stylized in both visual and musical & sexual content, but I like the director's style.  Shows Mickey at his most handsome & jaded and Carre Otis at her most beautiful.  The two were having an affair during the film, which ends with a frank love scene which got a lot of attention at the time. This was Otis' first film, and she doesn't really have to act here -- just look drop dead beautiful.  There are some ""FOB""'s in the film -- I call them flashes of brilliance from Mickey Rourke's acting style, things I can't imagine any other actor doing.  Jacqueline Bissett also puts in a good acting performance and the production features some nice on-location scenes in Rio.  Plenty of sexual situations, and the heated relationship between Rourke & Otis make it worthwhile seeing.  Not for the kiddies though.",1421280000,5,860,4.693333333333333

975131,5,6305165823,"Mickey Rourke is a very talented actor and he also used to be very good looking and sexy. His looks crashed due to boxing, plastic surgery and age. But his talent remained intact. This is one of the very last of his movies where he was super sexy and good looking. He pulls off the seemingly impossible here by playing an impotent rich guy in the tropics who can only watch others who is ultimately awakened anew by love. In real life, he was in love with the leading lady, Carrie Otis. Their attraction to one another in this film is absolutely electric. In a tropical land, amidst all sorts of shenanigans with the law, these two come together. I believe it was NC17 rated when I saw it. It absolutely sizzles plus is totally romantic. He and Otis were married briefly in real life and then his life headed into a downward spiral. But while it lasted, they were something.

975540,1,6305165823,"Wild Orchid can lay a fair claim to being among the worst movies ever made.  It's hard to recall a film that is so utterly dreadful in its acting, direction and ""script"" (that's being generous - I don't think there was one).  In fact, it's SO bad that it's almost watchable just to see how ludicrous it can (and does) get.  The whole thing is so preposterously wooden that you sometimes can't help guffawing.

To be fair, Carr Otis as the succulent object of desire is extremely nice to look at, and a guy could do worse than spend a week and a half - oh wait, it was actually only one hour and 57 minutes - lusting over her.  But that is the ONLY redeeming feature of this movie, and if you are unfortunate enough to be trapped in front of a TV when it's playing I strongly suggest you turn off the sound, because Otis' delivery of her lines makes you seriously wonder whether they gave the part to an android - and not a late-generation model at that.

It is something of a tribute to Mickey Rourke that he sometimes manages to deliver his lines in a way that makes the laughably clunky script sound better than it is.  But he's the only one in the movie who comes even close to success, and his character is so absurdly clichd and one-dimensional that the poor guy really doesn't have much to work with.  Jacqueline Bisset is painfully bad as a stereotyped hellion of a female lawyer; she tries her best to infuse her character with, well, character, but her attempt just comes off as horrible amateur dramatics.

This cinematic travesty comes to you from Zalman King, who both wrote and directed it.  Interestingly, King also wrote the screenplay for Nine And A Half Weeks.  That movie, by contrast, is fantastically stylish and well-paced, and its abundant erotica is sexy as hell.  But if you analyze it more than superficially the script there - while way better than this dead duck - has similar elements of clunkiness to it which are camouflaged by the sweet slickness of the direction.

The final agony of Wild Orchid is the controversial sex scene between Otis and Rourke (who were married for six years, by the way).  The big question was whether the sex was or was not simulated... but trust me, by the time you've survived everything that comes before - which amounts to almost two hours of painfully inept foreplay - you really won't care.

And don't miss the credits, which feature the two of them riding horses together and rolling around in the waves!

975687,3,6305165823,"There's something that irks me about the film. First of all, I will say that I do admire the look of the film. The city of Rio de Janiero and other parts of Brazil are beautifully shot. The music is also pleasurable to listen to. Rourke and Bisset give very good performances, though there are a couple of moments where the former doesn't look like he wants to be on camera. Some of the dialogue is decent: nothing terrible, really. Wild Orchid excels with style, and it does its job well. But I couldn't really enjoy the rest of the movie. The plot is just an excuse for the love scenes to kick in. I know that a story like this doesn't really matter since the film's main purpose is to stimulate eroticism. But it would have been done nicely if the story involving Carr Otis was given an improvement. It's a bit hard to believe that a Midwestern ""nobody"" became a lawyer at a young age. And it's not just the implausibility that bothers me. In other movies, lawyers are seen as intelligent and tough-minded. In THIS movie, Carr Otis's character is a lawyer who literally doesn't look like she knows what she's doing. Much of it has to do with her questionable acting. It's barely believable: she looks so timid for most of the time. She certainly looks beautiful, but her acting is just plain awful.

Did I like the film? Like I said, I do admire the look of the film. But unfortunately, anything that involved Otis is very bothersome. I'm sure she's a great person off-screen, but I do wish director Zalman King gave approval for a better casting choice. I consider this to be a decent film overall.

976148,4,6305165823,"One star off because the Rourke character is rich, millionaire rich. Had he been middle-class or upper-middle class, the seduction would have been more impressive. Another reason one star comes off is because there is only one good scene that he is not in, but since the seduction was realistic and the acting of Rourke is once again stellar, I can't give less than four stars. The Carre Otis character (Emily) is the hardest type of woman to seduce and Zalman King knows this: she is ambitious, hard-headed, conservative, and stunningly beautiful. Surely a woman like this is going to be a task to seduce and the Rourke character knows this. This is the kind of woman that will require a lot of patience and suave. The Rourke character (Wheeler) doesn't need to say all the right things: what he says to the ambitious international lawyer is genuine and heartfelt. On the exterior he is a motorcycle-riding bad-boy. But under the surface belies a man with a vulnerable side and knows that the woman can do some emotional damage to him if he isn't careful. The Jacqueline Bisset performance as a negotiator is a treat. A pivotal scene in the movie is when she and Emily talk about Wheeler for the first time. The negotiator is busy putting on a tie and looking in the mirror (I actually appreciate this. Some movies show characters putting ties on without mirrors and it's not realistic to me because without looking at a mirror, the tie probably will end up looking sloppy and crooked.), telling her of her experience with Wheeler and how he charmed her without even touching her. She wants to know if Wheeler swept her the way he did her, Emily is a beautiful woman after all, so she wants to find out if her attraction in the past was typical or just a spell Wheeler put on her. I guess she wanted to find out if Emily IS as weak as she WAS. The scene is pretty powerful for softcore cheese, I was pleasantly surprised. The movie contains some unforgettable scenes and some not-so-unforgettable scenes. Pretty much every scene not involving Wheeler is forgettable (except for that scene I mentioned between the negotiator and Emily) but Rourke's stellar performance is enough to carry the movie. Rourke displays the proper way of seduction: patience, sincerity, and mystery (not to mention intelligence, Wheeler is no dummy). It's a very subtle yet riveting performance.

976216,4,6305165823,"So, it's a little dated but this movie is still HOT! It's twisted tale of lust as a kinky rich guy (Rourke) gets a shy, sexually inhibited young lawyer (Carrie Otis) to drop her inhibitions and do things 'good' girls don't do. Otis's character is HOT and one wonders how Wheeler (Rourke) can resist her charms as he plays an emotionally unavailable guy with some serious intamacy issues. He watches in the background as he persuades her to do nasty things with another guy and lives 'through' her as she enjoys herself. Emily seems frightened of her own desires at first as she sees the sexy people of Rio being free and letting loose and having a good time and she ultimately is unable to resist her urges. Meanwhile, Jaquiline Bisset's character is and older lady obsessed with Wheeler, who is trying to throw the young and gorgeous Carrie Otis at him to see if he can resist. I didn't find this movie insulting to women or perverted, it's just a sexy film about people who enjoy sex and there is nothing wrong with this. Anyone who is seriously offended by this is probably not very comfortable with sexuality on screen in general. It's really a pretty tame movie by today's standards, though I DO beleive the Rourke/Otis love scene was not faked. Overall, I found this a sexy movie I would watch it again. The plot is not great but the visuals are awesome, the bodies are HOT and all natural (before this dreadful 'breast implant' craze took over and made all women in nude scenes look like they have grapefruits in them!) and the chemestry between the characters is awesome!

Hell, every movie Rourke was in he was playing the same character who got a different hot chick...They were big-screen soft core porn films. Problem is, Mickey Rourke is so good at playing these characters that the movies he's done aren't that bad. Here, Rourke plays Wheeler...Who won't really enter into the synopsis for a moment. Rourke's ex-wife Carre Otis plays Emily, a young International lawyer who recieves a job with a big firm in New York and is hastily sent to Rio De Janeiro. In Rio, with her boss Claudia (Jaqueline Bisset) away; Emily begins to come into contact with sex almost everywhere she goes. Then, she meets Wheeler. Wheeler is that odd, soft-spoken, rich, womanizer guy every guy wishes they could be. Wheeler is the guy who says stuff to women in movies that we would never be able to get away with, but onscreen it just looks so damned easy. Anyway, unlike ""9 1/2 Weeks"", Wheeler and Emily don't just begin having sex. In fact, the big sex payoff isn't until the final minutes of the movie. And let's face it, if you rent this movie...You're not renting it for the story. Truth is, the story's not even that intriguing or event good for that matter. The whole movie has a plot like a soft-core porn movie. Thing is, Otis and Rourke have enough charisma on screen to pull of a movie like this. So, even if you ignore the sex, the movie isn't that bad. I, personally, think it's better than 9 1/2 Weeks. Fact is, even if you don't give a damn about the story. Carre Otis is f**king hot, so check it out.

976220,3,6305165823,"In my heart of hearts, I'm fully aware that this is not a good film; despite the lovely photography, the exotic locale, and the cast full of actors who should have known better, too much of it feels arbitrary, rather than organically motivated.  And yet, there are days when nothing else will do -- hence the three stars.

I honestly think it's the place itself -- Carnevale, the crowd scenes, that gorgeous establishing shot of Christ of the Andes in the beginning, all those long curving roads against the sea and the lone Harley with the long low handlebars in silhouette -- that elevate the piece from Red-Shoe-Diaries territory into something that makes me wish I was there.  Carre Otis as Emily Reed is none too convincing as an international-business lawyer, even a new one, but she's as dewy and wholesome-looking as a peach pie.  She's Dorothy, and Rio is Oz, and her two costars are right there in the same kind of fable:  Jacqueline Bisset as a brassy but ultimately benevolent Glinda, and the magnificently screwed-up Rourke as the Wizard who's seen too much through his own eyes and wants another go at the world, using someone else's.  The outline of the film holds an interesting premise; it's just good enough to make me wish it was better.",1142640000,7,1256,4.712328767123288
976221,3,6305165823,"This movie is very sad. I loved ""9 1/2 weeks"" and Wild Orchid is the opposite of that. I can't tell the worst thing in this movie, cause it's a hard question...I hated Mickey Rourke in this role; the movie is boring, and I also didn't recognize my own country in it. The only thing that make's this movie really good was seeing the black woman and black man fully nude having sex.",1132099200,3,380,4.219178082191781
976222,5,6305165823,"Just kidding, I don't know what I'm talking about. You should see this movie if you like:

1) Sex

2) Nudity

3) Hot babes

4) Mickey Rourke

5) Carre Otis

6) Mickey Rourke and Carre Otis going at it for real

7) Perfume commercials

8) Directors trying to make their softcore porn look like art by filming everything sensually and in slow motion, so the film appears to be arthouse and ""visually stimulating""

9) Really, really, really bad dialogue

10) Lots of good banging and screwing without a plot

11) Mickey Rourke playing a total pimp (which is different than just Mickey Rourke - I mean, there's Mickey Rourke, and then there's Mickey Rourke the Pimp, which is even cooler)

And finally...

12) Hot female characters who wear glasses and carry around clipboards so the audience believes they are smart and successful businesswomen, when in fact they'd have a hard time calculating 1 + 1. (Also see: Alone in the Dark, Tara Reid's character; or Fantastic Four, Jessica Alba's.)

Highly recommended to the appropriate demographic.

I could kill myself for buying it. :(",1120694400,54,1078,4.814207650273224
976223,4,6305165823,"I have owned Wild Orchid for quite a few years and from the beginning thought it was a bit out there. Some of it doesn't fit, some of it doesn't make sense and some of it is just plain dumb. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I like Mickey Rourke. Even though he does look at bit beat up in this movie and kind of scary looking at first with the slicked down hair he is practically oozing sex. Carre Otis's character, Emily, seems a bit aloof and childlike. She is bombarded by scenes of people having sex in an abandoned building, watching 2 people have sex in a limo. Wheeler (Mickey Rourke) almost seems to enjoy watching Emily squirm a bit. Wheeler is sort of detached, but wanting someone he can trust. Its tough to make sense of this movie because honestly the best part is the end. Now I have the unrated version so it shows more than the R-rating (for a movie like this one - unrated or NC-17 is the way to go)-the part where Wheeler and Emily make love finally. It is very arousing to say the least. I must give it to Zalman King. He knows how far to go to where the movie gets into your mind, but yet he doesn't go for the gratuitous sex. I suggest Delta of Venus, which is another Zalman King experience.",1097280000,26,1220,4.151898734177215
976224,5,6305165823,"this is the definitive zalman king classic which follows on the heels of o'rourke's last erotc drama 9 1/2 weeks. no, this is not a sequel & the two films have little in common. while orchid may be flawed, it is certainly an entertaining & beautiful film which i'm sure you could watch over & over. carre otis plays the newcomer here & she has the expressions down pat even though some of her lines are delivered quite like we'd hope. jacqueline bisset is beautiful & fun to watch even though most of the screen time is focused on o'rourke & otis, whom eventually married & divorced in real life. carre otis plays emily reed, who has just accepted a position as a legal assistant under bisset & the two are off to rio de janiero. yes, that's right! brazil!! it's everything you'd ever hoped it would be so mr. king did a wonderful job with the sights & sounds.  brazil was truly a daydream come true. as i'm getting off the subject a bit here, bisset throws emily off of o'rourke by making her wear the dress he initially had given to her many years back. as you can guess, o'rourke does find ms. reed completely charming & attractive but somehow cannot bring himself to show his true emotions. in the beginning of the film, he is also unable to touch her as he is emotionally withdrawn from the world. will she ever be able to break through this exterior to find real wheeler inside(o'rourke) or will she not? like 9 1/2 or red shoe diaries which are both projects zalman has worked on, wild orchid is very erotic & almost what you might consider borderline softcore pornography although far more complex & even a bit artsy. if you love passionate love stories with a twist, then wild orchid is a must see. i have no favorite scenes to mention here as i love the film in it's entirety. at such an affordable price, you too should own wild orchid if you don't already. much love.",1077148800,6,1879,4.414985590778098
976225,5,6305165823,"Wild Orchid gave me a headache when I first saw it over a decade ago - what was all of this psychological drama?  It quickly occured to me that I was watching an art film.  There are scenes of sexuality that are mistaken by many as ""soft core porn"".  I disagree -- every scene advances the story for the characters, and it is tastefully done in every instance.  There is also a misconception that Mickey Rourke plays a ""macho multimillionaire"" -- no, he plays a sexually impotent multimillionaire that finds the will to love.  This is a beautiful story, with strong characters set in an amazing city... a work of art, if you ask me.",1074297600,8,632,4.460869565217391
976346,4,6305165823,"This one isn't quite mainstream, to say the least. Soft-porn probably would describe it well, but still, I enjoyed it lots, esp the scene in the weird half-abandoned building with the couple making love under a trickling stream of water.
Mickey Rourke, fresh from 9  Weeks, again plays a brooding screwed-up millionaire. Lots of kinky sex and titillating background action and dialogue make it fun to watch with someone special. Good sound track, too.",1072656000,55,451,5.094594594594595
976347,4,6305165823,"Ok, I'll just state first that the film isn't the best your ever going to see, and there might be some scenes in the movie that are ok, but once you get past that and be a bit forgiving- you are going to LOVE this steamy, excitable film. First off the scenery and the music are just beautiful and captavating. From the moment I saw Mickey Rourke and Carre Otis I was hooked. Both are uniquely interesting. Mickey Rourke is HOT, and Carre Otis is sensational and beautiful as attorney emily reed. When these two come together, for the duration of the story I desperatly wanted these two to get together and boy I was not disappointed. The atmosphere and scenery are steamy and sensual, and the main love theme is excellent I LOVE IT. And if you want to see these two in action your head is going to blow off. I have not seen a sex scene shot so superbly, sexy and beautiful in my life, with a soundtrack to complement it beautifully. And for the die hard fans who buy this YOU GET BOTH VERSIONS OF THE UN-RATED AND THE R-RATED VERSIONS OF THE FILM. The R-rated is just as mesmerising as the un-rated one, it is maybe more passionate, more kissing and holding each other which I LOVE and can't get over. I'm SO in Love with this movie and scenes from this film are mesmerising. Mickey and Carre are excellent. I'v read reviews where Carre Otis is put down, but in my opinion I don't believe a word of it. Carre Otis is the BEST. A very talented actress, a beautiful women and model. I loved Carre as Emily Reed, no one else could of played Emily as well as Carre. She has a  special quality to her that leaves you wanting more, to watch more of her. Good work from Zalman King.- And who could forget the end scene when Wheeler finally gives in and surrenders to Emily. That moment from when she goes to leave and he embraces her which leads to the love scene, anyone that see's that scene will instantly love this film.",1045612800,20,1917,4.295580110497237
976348,3,6305165823,"WILD ORCHID was released in 1990 surrounded by controversy that the sex scenes between Carre Otis and Mickey Rourke were not faked.  They were a couple at the time, and it is possible that there is some truth to the rumor, but in the end does it matter?
It's a typical Zalman King affair -- rather thin plot revolving around some business intrigue and mostly a sexual awakening of a girl from the country traveling to Rio.  The setting provides incredible material for the brilliant cinematography, and the music is sexy and moody.  A very fun role for Jacqueline Bisset, but unfortunately too little for anyone else to do other than pose and preen ... and ... well... do love scenes.  Zalman King movies are soft and sensuous, and revolve around mood and sex scenes.  Don't expect anything more than well-photgraphed love scenes, and you will be fine.
To all you DVD geeks out there (like me) -- edge enhancemnet is at an all-time high here.  Colors are good, and its nice to see this movie in widescreen format.  You get both the R-rated version and the unrated versions, but this is done on sides of the disc and not by branching.  You get a 2 channel stereo mix that is not very good, but probably the original soundtrack without any remastering (pity because this one needs the extra ooomph in the sound department).  Grain and print flaws are obvious, the film shows its age in the transfer.  But at the low retail price fans of the movie will like it, but certainly not a demo disc by any means.",1019520000,137,1502,4.529629629629629

The people are beautiful, the sound track is one of my all time favoriates, and model actress Carrie Otis is easy to look at. Zalman King used influences from Two Moon Junction and 9 1/2 Weeks to provide this fans with a wonderful love story in a wonderful setting. Rumor has it, the film's opening scene had to be re-edited because the motion picture rating board (the pepole that rate motion pictures) gave this film a X-Rating. Rumor also has it that Carrie Otis and Mickey Rourke were actually making love on film. The two later married and then devorced. We can only hope that this hard to find video, and now for the first time on DVD, is the un-cut and un-edited version which has a ""Non-Rating"".",1010275200,16,804,4.4391891891891895
976350,5,6305165823,"I love the ""Wild Orchid"". It is my favorite movie. I have to say, for a movie that deals with erotic sexual situations, this movie handles the subject with sensitivity. It is not a movie based on dirty sex, but instead it is based on passion, fantasy, and sensuality. The location in which it was filmed is in reality the sexual capital of the world, Brazil and I applaud the creator for the decision to base the movie there. The music is a whole other case, of brillance. The music is superb. The soundtrack is unforgettable. Only one error, the song, ""It only has to happen once"" by Ambitious Lovers sould have been incorporated in the CD soundtrack. This is the best movie, and Mickey Rourke is the perfect wild and in control lead actor.
