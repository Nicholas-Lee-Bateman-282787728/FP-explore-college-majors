8296324,5,B001E50SR0,"This amazing show by Lady Carolyn was insightful, witty, and a joy to watch. As Lady Carolyn undresses, the viewer learns about all the many, many layers that go into an Edwardian Lady's ensemble, including the 9 pieces of underwear! She explains why a Lady would where each item and layer of clothing and gives insight into that period in History. Boy, am I glad I do not have to go through all that each day, just to get dressed!",1224460800,4,431,4.4
