8699439,3,B00SVDIYM4,"Low budget movie from 1961 that takes place in the Southwest on the border with Mexico.  Three delinquent youths meet up with a killer on the run.  In fact, they're all on the run.  At one hour and 10 minutes, the movie progresses at a steady pace.  It's certainly entertaining with a decent musical score.  It's just sort of unintentionally campy.  I could see this being a cult hit.",1511049600,,384,4.492753623188406
