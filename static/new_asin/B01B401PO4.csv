7621564,5,B01B401PO4,If you like gundam and you want it in HD get it. I own zeta gundam on dvd and the blu ray looks a lot better.,1459900800,2,109,3.230769230769231
7621565,5,B01B401PO4,"First I want to start by saying that I have no idea what these other reviews are talking about. NOTHING is omitted! My openings and endings play on every episode just fine. I think they might be using crappy bluray players that have some software on them, that will fast forward past the openings. I'm using Microsoft XBOX One. NO issues. Not sure what they are talking about... But anyways its the english version openings using the changed music. Which is much, much better if you look at the english openings that use the japanese song. Anyways this is an excellent anime. Always worth watching. Much darker than first Gundam. Is it worth the money? YES! I will always be rewatching my gundams, so owning the latest on blu ray is the way to go!",1488153600,,747,4.54074074074074
