There is nudity, but not too excessive and is a part of the story and plotline, and violence and some modern day visuals to the country of origin, not to mention some[special effects, thought not good!]  FX. I recommend seeing this if you have liking to these types of foreign mysteries and like to see the other side. It is subtitled and easy to read and i think is nice way to enjoy a film like this. Cheap enough to invest in MY opinion, and so you can watch it over again and see what you think about the plot and storyline, and more if you have to. So i will give it 3 stars and rewatch it again a few more times just to soak it all in.",1290556800,,823,3.9518072289156625

A very slick, well conceived tale of love, lust, betrayal and occult payback. Just when you think you've got it all figured out everything changes and you're back to square one. It will keep you guessing to the very end and still surprise you.

If that's not enough to peak your interest how about the presence of a beautiful actress like Manuela Acuri (the Moorish girl in 'Mad Love')? She's absolutely gorgeous. So, if you like beautiful women (there are 3 in this movie), imaginative plots and surprise endings this movie is for you!",1112227200,35,576,4.797979797979798
