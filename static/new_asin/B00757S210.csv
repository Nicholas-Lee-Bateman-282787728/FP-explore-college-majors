8510478,5,B00757S210,"Wow!  I was so impressed and inspired to try belly dancing.  Sabeya makes it look so easy and effortless.  The individual movements are isolated and put together, so it all makes sense.  It's great seeing the isolated movements because it makes it easier to follow. I can stop the dvd and practice the moves until I get them right.  It will take me a while to learn them because she is so thorough, but looking at the actual dance makes me keep working on it.  I want to dance half that well.  Sabeya is beautiful and so is the scenery.  I am buying one for myself and one as a gift for my sister.",1332374400,3,597,4.175438596491228
8510479,5,B00757S210,"Fantastic! This DVD set is ideal, not only for beginners who want to learn technique, but I think it will serve as a great refresher for intermediate belly dancers as well.  Sabeya is thorough and descriptive in her explanation of each belly dance move, and she doesn't go too fast.  The DVD set comes with two videos, each one packed with information on fundamentals, practice moves, as well as tips and tricks to help you achieve the right look and feel.  Best of all, it is fun and entertaining, with a beautiful dance performance by Sabeya at the end.  She shows you the potential outcome of where all this practicing can take you!",1331856000,3,635,4.592920353982301
8510480,5,B00757S210,"After watching the beautiful trailer, I immediately ordered this two DVD set. Wow - there is a lot of information packed into these two DVDs! Sabeya does a beautiful job carefully and clearly explaining each move - and she covers a lot of them making these DVDs a valuable tool for any dance student. As an intermediate dancer I found it helpful to go over the foundation moves to perfect my positioning - plus learn new moves as well! There are several combinations and practice segments included to get us started in acquiring the skills needed. Sabeya is stunning, the backgrounds are gorgeous and these are nicely produced DVDs. Every bellydancer must add this to their library. Sabeya's performance video is flawless and inspiring.",1329782400,3,736,4.943548387096774
