5011641,5,B006OV7RZA,"A new favorite of my 2 year old daughter.  It came with a small, thin puzzle shrink-wrapped to the cover of the dvd, which was a nice surprise.

5011657,5,B006OV7RZA,"For those of you who, like me, are interested in which episodes of ""Strawberry Shortcake's Berry Bitty Adventures"" are contained on this DVD, here is the list:
01. ""Pop Goes The Garden"" (October 18, 2010) - Blueberry accidentally plants popcorn instead of daises due to a mix up at the seed company.
02. ""Vanishing Violets"" (October 13, 2010) - When Lemon's prize violets start disappearing, she jumps to some wrong conclusions.
03. ""Trading Sizes"" (November 2, 2010) - Raspberry finds a way to enlarge Berrykins to the same size as Strawberry and her friends.",1381881600,19,560,4.968085106382978
5011658,5,B006OV7RZA,"Definitely worth getting for you Strawberry fan, but don't get it on Amazon. Walmart has it for $4.95.
It is just a few of the episodes from Hub, strung together. But, if you are like me and want to save space on the dvr or have for the road, it is worth it.",1367107200,,258,3.8867924528301887
5011659,5,B006OV7RZA,"Again, these were ordered for my granddaughter who absolutely loves these tapes.  The arrived very quickly and were a big hit with her.  Thanks for the great service and product.  Loretta Dinges",1363737600,,194,5.0
5011660,5,B006OV7RZA,"So far my toddler daughter has all but one of the newer Strawberry Shortcake movies and I have to say I personally prefer them myself. They have the ""girls"" and berrykins overcoming obstacles and learning from their mistakes and I really like that. Makes them more educational in my opinion, in the areas of manners & learning common sense and such. The ones prior to these new ones with the pie man and his wife are ok too, but I like that the new ones don't have a ""bad guy"" in them. My only complaint about this particular item has nothing to do with the actual item, and in the long run everything turned out great. I paid $8.99 for this one new and found it 2 days later in Walmart for only $5. I checked 2 different stores to make sure the first one hadn't marked it wrong. However, their online price does list it as over $10, so I can't blame amazon for not knowing the in-store price, as I think they only base theirs on what others are selling it for online. I was going to return it, but amazon surprised me by crediting my account and letting me keep it. I didn't know they did that. I was getting it for my daughter's birthday so it's kind of like she got a birthday present from amazon too!",1363046400,,1204,4.216450216450217

5011668,5,B006OV7RZA,"I am a mother of a 2 year old girl and she absolutely adores this DVD! I have to say I am surprised by the number of negative comments about the new version of Strawberry Shortcake. I am by no means a Strawberry purist even though I was grew up with the original dolls (and still have them) and cartoon. My husband and I just recently tried to watch one of the more recent incarnations and found it to be much less fun and a bit strange. We love this new version and so does our daughter! It has a very upbeat, positive spin on real life and definitely provides positive life lessons (e.g. how to improvise and make the best of what you have, why it's important not to jumpt to conclusions or accuse friends, and how to appreciate everyone's differences). We'll definitely be buying more of this series!",1342569600,8,803,4.36
