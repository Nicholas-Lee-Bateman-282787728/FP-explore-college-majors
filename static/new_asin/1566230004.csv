7796712,3,1566230004,I found this a good start for adults afraid that learning Spanish would be too dificult for them. A good confidence builder and mildly entertaining as well.  Production a bit amateurish though.,955065600,3,193,5.03125
7796713,3,1566230004,"Average presentation of words & phrases used around the house. Not exciting, but simple enough for children to repeat. Latin American home setting adds a cultural touch. K-3rd grade teachers might find this tape  useful in the classroom.",950918400,2,237,5.2368421052631575
7796714,1,1566230004,This a poor quality video shot by one camera in what looks like a basement. Actors look away during thier lines as if they don't want anyone to see what they are doing. This is not for small children and older kids  and adults will find it boring. Don't waste your money.,942278400,41,271,4.211538461538462
