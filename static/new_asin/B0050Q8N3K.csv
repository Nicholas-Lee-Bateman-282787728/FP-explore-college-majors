4517710,4,B0050Q8N3K,I really like this DVD. It doesn't have very much of the belly dancing elements except for at the beginning which is a good warm up. The instruction is good and it is good steady workout that will make you sweat. The music is energetic and relaxing.,1319932800,9,249,4.319148936170213

8451651,1,B0050Q8N3K,"I wished I had read  Who Am I? ""Me!""'s review before renting this video. It is right on the mark!
However, I need to stick to 1 star.
I was really looking for an African dance video but I thought that I would not mind the belly dancing part since I had just gone through a belly dancing video and I had really enjoyed it. The quality of the instruction in the other video highlighted the complete lack of it in this one.
For the belly dancing part, the instructor is wearing what she calls a belly dancing outfit. You cannot see her legs or her hips and she does not talk about the moves ... so you just guess. You cannot really disappoint yourself because just about anything you do will look like what she does. It feels like she really has no clue.
The African Dance part is a small fraction of the video, so the title is really misleading. It was definitely better than the belly dancing part, but these people are not instructors. It felt like kids saying ""look what I can do! Now you do it!
And yes, the teenagers look really bored!",1398729600,,1038,4.242424242424242
8451652,2,B0050Q8N3K,"I haven't laughed this hard in a while so, I cannot say this purchase wasn't worth it for me, because it was.  But not for the workout.  My friend and I tried to do this workout together, but every time we tried we just ended up on the floor laughing.

First off the quality of the video is poor and it looks like a home video that was shot on an old VHS set-up.

Secondly the female instructor does these weird dance moves that aren't really belly dance or African... They seem more salsa-ish with some belly dancing-ish things going on in there.  Her movements are small and uninspiring so there's not much of a workout.

Thirdly, the back-up dancers they have look like they are her teenage kids and the looks on their faces while dancing are as if they are being forced to do this video.  They really look like they do not want to be there at all.

The only part of the video that was kinda good was when the male instructor came in as his moves really seemed like African dance moves- but he's only in the video for a few minutes.

I gave it an extra star for making me and my friend laugh so hard.  If this video were more well-known I'm certain SNL would do a parody of it.",1395014400,5,1180,4.158590308370044
8451653,5,B0050Q8N3K,"This video is just what I needed to continue my workout and weight loss program.
I've lost body fat, not I want to lose the belly fat.

Thank you",1364083200,,145,4.0
8451654,1,B0050Q8N3K,"How this video got a three and a half star I don't know.  I was very disappointed. If I hadn't spent my money, I would want to laugh myself silly. I watched it all the way through. The young girls she has working with her are so sad and unhappy, I don't think they wanted to be in the video. And who did the decorations? Look like someone threw some material up to hide something. I was hoping it wouldn't fall down. I should have listen to that one review to save my money. I'm telling you they were right,don't buy save your money!",1362268800,,533,4.125
8451655,4,B0050Q8N3K,"The pace was nice , the movement were simple nothing strenuous. But she don't give any instruction or prepare you with the new moves . She just do them and hope you catch on. The video was funny because she has these miscellaneous characters working with her who look like they would rather be somewhere else. two young girls dressed in regular clothes but again the pace is nice and easy to follow. so you could committ  to this everyday. Then this guy with the drum comes on and add some flavor. His moves are nice but you have to just try to learn them again no instruction but he does them over enough so that you can learn them with practice. Overall I liked the video it felt more like learning some traditional african dance steps more than anything and that was cool.",1362182400,,775,4.381944444444445
8451656,2,B0050Q8N3K,I love african music and dance but was not what i thought it was going to be....  it's actually boring!,1358553600,,103,4.15
8451657,1,B0050Q8N3K,I don't recommend this video .if you want a intense workout.the dance moves need some work.you get what you pay for!,1344211200,2,116,4.571428571428571
8451658,4,B0050Q8N3K,"I liked this dvd because it was easy to follow. I could do all the moves with ease, and I worked up a sweat in the process. I wish I could find more dance dvds like this one.",1324944000,9,174,3.6052631578947367
8451659,5,B0050Q8N3K,"The video is something that I basically observed to learn about the various aspects that may be going on in the dance areas of movement.
It's beneficial even to someone who want to see more of what to expect and not to expect. I personally appreciate having this video. I have studied dance since 1968. I will say, ""to each his own""!
I am glad I bought it. I hope this person makes more videos. I actually would buy anybody video good or bad. There is something
for everyone in the world of dance and creative expression.
I really should make one and just look at myself just to see what I've learned from all video that I have purchased over the years. In college, I had a dance instructor who always copied other dance instructors works, and claim them as her own. It's amazing the level some teachers would go because they as such lousy teachers. I have met them all. I've also seen people on stage who dance worst than myself over the years.",1320192000,,945,4.375
