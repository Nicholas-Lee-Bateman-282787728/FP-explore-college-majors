560130,4,6303104371,"Normally the only choice I have for anime is dubs.  But with this movie I made an excepttion, the dub stinks!!  What's with the English accent on some characters and a country accent on some others, and then to top it off  the little kid has a Mexican accent, he sounds like Speedy Gonzalez.  The  sub on the other hand sounds very realistic and is much easier to get into  than the dub.  The movie has a pretty good storyline and is always a  pleasure to watch.  The disk itself is a boring purple color,but hey who's  complaining?  There are little extras on the disk which include a few  trailors of other anime on DVD from U.S. Manga Corps.  There is also  character introductions including main characters and some of the monsters.  The only problem I had with this is that the character introductions are  taken directly off of a scene from the movie and kinda spoils what happens  if you were to look at them first and then watch the movie.  Overall this  is an above average disk which is in no way a waste of money.",926640000,5,1024,4.351063829787234

560206,5,6303104371,"I enjoyed this lots more than Ninja Scroll/Akira/Ghost In The Shell. Unlike other anime ... ""Demon City Shinjuku"" doesnt have tons of annoying minor characters or weird subplots. Plenty of violence and humor along with romance.

560208,5,6303104371,"The version I watched on the Sci-Fi channel decades ago was censored for language (but not violence of course, yay for North American priorities).  Watching this version made a lot of my memories make sense.  ""Man, I thought that dialogue sounded chopped-off back then!"" was a thought that passed through my mind time and time again as I watched this DVD.

So basically, Japan's Shinjuku area gets all but obliterated by demonic forces at the hands of the antagonist who pledges that in ten years the gate to hell will be fully opened and the world will be plunged into darkness.  The reluctant protagonist is a practitioner of Nenpo(sp?), a form of martial arts based on channeling the energies of the universe.  He teams up with a brave woman to battle the demons of Shinjuku over the fate of the world.

There's not a large amount of nudity or freaky anime-fetish stuff going on in this movie.  Over-all, it's pretty clean aside from language and one partial nudity scene.",1368403200,3,975,4.733727810650888

560212,5,6303104371,"I would like to tell your Australian customers that this dvd has a different title here, which is ""Monster City"".

It is about a city called Tokyo and a suburb of Shinjuku which has been taken over by a nut called Rebi Rah. Rah has turned Shinjuku into a city of demons, and in three days he intends to turn the whole world into a wasteland with the help of an army of demons from the pits of Hell.

It is the job of Sayaka Rama (who is trying to find her father) and Kyoyo (who is trying to revenge the death of his father) to fight their way through the demons to get to Rah.

On the way two other companions help in their way, but most of the story is centered on Sayaka and Kyoyo and his wooden sword. Kyoyo's father was a master swordsman and could not defeat Rah, so how is Kyoyo expected to do the impossible.

He has a secret weapon that he does not even know he has, and it serves him well in the end. Sayaka is captured by Rah and is waiting to be used as a sacrifice to the devils of Hell, but Kyoyo finds his father's sword and the secret weapon moments before Rah could open the gates of Hell. I thought the fight between Rah and Kyoyo was a bit short, although there is no other out-come when the sword and the secret weapon are used as one.

There is action a plenty, demons that manga fans are used to by now, and the over-the-top torture that the human body could possiblly endure, but we all LOVE it for what it is.

This dvd gets five stars and I would recommend this dvd to anyone who is interested in the manga genre, because it has all the elements in it. If you come from another country be careful what you buy, as the American manga has different titles.",1357344000,2,1679,4.088145896656535

560215,5,6303104371,"Re-released by Discotek and wow is it worth the upgrade. The video quality is a big improvement, the colors are more vibrant, the print is much cleaner. Also the audio has been remastered too with a Japanese DTS 5.1 track, apparently encoded at 755kpbs, a Japanese 2.0 stero track and of course the fan favourite English dub in 2.0 stero as well.

I defintly like the cover art of this release much since it matches the original Japanese movie posterand cover art. It also shows of the amazing character designs so much more. Dicotek always offer plenty of extras in all their releases, even if they are rare and hard to find. With this we get a 25 minute storyboard, the original Japanese trailer which I've never seen before and  the original Japanese credits are at the end of the movie this time as well.

Demon City Shinjuku is a classic, 1988 motion picture. It came out, when horror and extremely violent action flicks like Wicked City, Fist of North Star, Mad Bull 34, Crying Freeman, were staple. Infact if you keep track of Discotek release, they are release almost all the titles I've just mentioned on DVD.

They really don't make them like this anymore, infact in contemporary anime, you rarely see blood ever and the animation is usually made on the cheap. Well, not in the 80's, this boasts the highest production values, Akira esque, high detailed, high budget animation. You see huge shots of detailed skyscrapers, changing color skies, all kinds of crazy, animated special effects. Amongst this you also have a great love story and well fleshed out characters, there's also some fan service as well.

I don't know why any one cares about the f**k being used it's not like it was used in a degrading way is far as I remember.

SUPRISINGLY the english dubbed was good, besides different english accents, so what! It is english dubbed, I don't care if their are southern, english and american accents. It is english dubbed and takes place in Japan, so if you don't like the dubbed version you might is well find it subtitled if you can.",1271289600,,519,4.18

Animation is exactly what I expected.  From the Mid 80's, on par with Galaxy 999 and if your expecting quality animation, this is not it.

The dubbing is by part the worst dubbing I have ever heard (next to the Magic Knight Rayearth theme songs).  These characters say the ""F"" word like 16 times, most of the time gratuitously.  I was expecting so much more out of the plot, but it let me down.

This is truly the movie the never could - Put this on your rental list above ""Crying Freeman"" or any of those horrid MD Geist movies.",1172707200,,737,4.343065693430657

560264,5,6303104371,"In exchange for the power to slay his fellow student and rival, Rebi Rah agreed to open a doorway into the demon world.

Years later, the time has come for him to honor his end of the deal. Knowing that his old teacher, Rai, could possibly stop him, he places a spell on the peaceful Federation President; without Master Rai's constant aid, the president will die.

Since he cannot leave the president, Rai asks for Kyoya, the son of Rebi Rah's dead rival, to do so. And with the urging of Sayaka, the president's cute and pure-hearted daughter, Kyoya agrees.

But Kyoya only has rudimentary knowledge of his father's fighting skills. To get to Rah, he must fight his way through the monster-infested streets of Shinjuku, protecting Sayaka along the way. The odds say he doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell...

About the only way I could see this movie getting any better is if it was longer.",1151884800,,897,4.622641509433962
560265,4,6303104371,"As I look at my collection of anime, I now realize, with the purchase of Demon City Shinjuku, I've complete my own personal set of anime, and that is the first ones I ever saw. But Demon City Shinjuku was different because it was the first truly uncut anime I had ever seen and I think the second of any anime, cut or no, after Akira. So therefore it still has a special place for me, and watching it now, almost a decade later, I still remember all those amazing moments that happen in this horror anime. And I still wonder why in the world would the main character use a wooden sword to battle demons and sorcerers... (It's symbolic, I now realize, sort of Tolkien-esque.)

The story of Demon City follows the exploits of a young man named Kyoya as he helps the president's (of Japan) daughter in destroying the threat to all mankind that festers in what has become known as ""Monster City Shinjuku"" by its few human inhabitants. But Kyoya is an unwilling hero in this tale, forced to follow in his warrior father's footsteps and battle an evil sorcerer bent on world destruction named Rebi Rah. First, though, he must learn all the required skills of his sword technique, and during this quick training he battles demon after demon and begins to learn that he might have what it takes to save mankind, as well as winning over the girl he's falling for.

What I like most about this movie was the fact that it followed all those classic storytelling elements. It uses foreshadowing, it throws complications at the characters, and there is enough character development for a viewer to learn to like them. What I didn't like about this, however, was the horrible voice-acting. Well, maybe not horrible; it wasn't melodramatic and there was emotion, but I don't really remember ever hearing anyone in Japan of having a Mexican, Romanian, or Southern accent. It was just a little over the top, and in many cases it ruined the horror of the moment as they were just too comical to believe. Luckily, there is a subbed track, though I still wish that the dubbed track was remade for the newer DVD release.

However, even with the bad voice-acting, I can't help but recommend this anime to any true anime fan. The action is superb, the animation is excellent even to today's standards, and it is one of the classics in anime, directed by one of the best and most well known anime directors around, Yoshiaki Kawajiri (Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, Ninja Scroll, X).",1144540800,13,2456,4.615560640732266
560266,5,6303104371,A very good example of what top notch anime can convey & accomplish. And for that it's a great movie.,1138665600,5,101,4.1
560267,3,6303104371,"I found that this was a very good film for its age.  It still had some very good artwork in it.  Some of the backgrounds were just beautiful!  This anime also had a good plot and some good healthy sword action in a modern setting. For thoes who like a little violance but not nudity than this is a film for you.  while there is alot of sword work (alwase cool) and a bit of blood it is not done to excess and is kept at a tasteful level.  For thoes of you who like alot of Blood, Rape, Sex and Bodily Maiming than look else where.

Now for the bad news... while the artwork was well done the dubbing and soundtrack just plain SUCKED!  There is a waitress in the beginning who sounds like she's from Alabama or something and the heroine sounds like she's from England.  Now this wouldnt be all that bad but there both supposed to be from Japan!  As for the music in it there mostly is none exept for here and there and it can be a little repitave and very sparce.  I found that these were the two most memorable things about this anime.  It would appear to me that they just wanted a quick easy Mod over to DVD and the US and didn't want to take the time for at least better voice overs.",1137369600,3,1186,4.047210300429184

This movie is very violent, with plenty of blood & guts, but there is no--repeat, *NO*--sex! There is brief partial nudity by a female demon, and the human heroine is almost raped by demons, but the rape attempt is broken up before much skin is shown. Also, the heroine's clothes seem to magically repair themselves afterwards.

The (relucant) hero lusts after his gorgeous companion, but somehow restrains himself. He doesn't even make a pass at her until...well, see for yourself. I give it 5 out of 5 stars.",1098489600,12,632,4.693693693693693
560280,3,6303104371,"I had originally seen this in Japenese, then some bootleg dubbed version, thoroughly enjoyed it, so I decided to pick up the DVD.  The movie is good, but the English dubbing  in this DVD definitly left a bit to be desired.  The waitress at the beginning had a very heavy southern accent (wich is fine in Georgia or Alabama, but not when you are supposed to be Japenese)and it also had alot of unnecessary prophanity dubbed into it. And a character who was neutral to an extreem, Mephisto, sounded like he borrowed his accent from other Anime, specifically Vampire flicks. Alot of F**K for no reason at all, it seemed that it was used to fill in gaps in the translation.
Now bad dubbing aside, it was a well done and very entertaining movie.  The classic good vs evil/ avenging a dead relative adventure movie.  IT was a fun movie with alot of action, and it definitly belonged in with other classics like Bio Hunter and Wicked City, albeit this is tame in comparison to either of those.  It made the action very enjoyable without  having to have carnage/nudity in every other sceen, not that it offends me when it does, but its nice to see action make its point without it sometimes. Good developed, SHORT, story.  Fast paced, lots of action, with an ending that left the movie done and resolved.

560281,3,6303104371,"This video was lent to me by a friend of mine, and on a first viewing, a really enjoyed the animation. I wouldn't say that it was... Akira quality, but it was pretty good.
However, good animation cannot mask a total lack of everything else. The story was okay, it lost me after the first half hour, but I got back into it again later on. There was not a whole lot of fluid animation, however, it was very detailed.
What's the problem with it?
To be perfectly honest, I can't remember anything else. The characters are boring and quite frankly, I didn't give a crap about their well-being. They didn't stand out, and now, a month after viewing, I STILL can't remember their names. I can't remember the point of the story, let alone why the big demon poobah wanted to take over- wait. What WAS his motive, anyway?
Overall, you'll probably forget most if not all of the movie a while after watching it. The animation sticks with you, but nothing else.
If you want demon action, try a real classic, like Princess Mononoke.",1082332800,2,1018,4.478494623655914
560282,2,6303104371,"Being an anime fan (check my top 25 list) i wasent suprised at the quality of this movie. What did suprise me was how many people consider this a good anime.
The poor animation, lackluster story and typical characters make this movie nothing more then a bad copy of already bad horror/anime.
The storyline is so crammed and condensed that theres not much point in paying attnetion to it.
Ive watched the movie time and time again, each time finding something new out. But this isent always a good thing, atleast not in this movie. Infact each time i watched it i had less and less respect for it.
So i gave it 2 stars
1 for all the unnessasary violence (seeing as how this is a major attraction to younger anime fans).
1 for the story attempt",1056240000,,742,4.384057971014493
560283,5,6303104371,"Hmmm, there's a reaction.  When I saw this movie on the Sci-Fi Channel, that scene made me laugh when the female demon exploded after having beer poured down her throat.  I knew she intended to kill the man who tried to prevent his own death by using the beer left on the pool table.
I've seen many other anime movies like ""Vampire Hunter D"", ""Galaxy Express 999"" (all three of these) and some others I cannot remember the names of.  Of all these, ""Demon City of Shinjuku"" is my favorite because of the above scene.  If this scene didn't exist, the movie would be a typical Japanese cartoon.  Others have tried to copy the anime format but they have failed miserably, recent example, ""Titan A.E.""
Unlike ""Titan A.E."", ""Demon City of Shinjuku"" has a real story line that isn't hard to find or follow.  Somebody must go to the Demon City and destroy the demon before his power reaches full strength or the Earth will be destroyed.  Simple, right? Well, the boy chosen for this quest doesn't realize his inner strength. He surpasses his father's skill with a sword.  Along the way to the city, he meets a girl searching for her father, also in the Demon City, and falls in love with her.
There was one thing that bothered me.  The hispanic boy was able to skateboard through the streets without being harmed physically.  I guess it pays to learn how to defend yourself.  It made me laugh when the boy ended up wetting his bed after havng a nightmare hosted by the demon.
I would not recommend this movie to anyone under the age of 17 because even dubbed in English, this movie has a lot of raw language that was not cleaned up during dubbing.",1015718400,3,1639,4.466442953020135

You can simply turn off the sound to follow the movie, when it comes to the dubbed version! There were more curse words in the first 10 minutes of the dubbed version then in the ENTIRE subtitled version. Can we say pathetic?
 The subtitled however, it was a great movie and I would like to see another like it. Enough said!",1015632000,,484,4.377777777777778
560285,2,6303104371,"For some odd reason, there are mature-rated anime films out there that are considered either huge milestones in anime or cult classics yet aren't accepted by the majority of the anime-loving community. Examples include ""Biohunter"", ""Twilight of the Dark Master"", and, yes, ""Demon City Shunjuku"". Putting aside all prejudices that might hinder my enjoyment of the film, I watched this movie. What did I think of it? Not very much.
It isn't the cliched plot that's the biggest problem, because some of the best anime out there is practically riddled with cliches. The biggest problem is the characterization, or, more correctly, lack thereof. None of the characters felt real to me; all of them were cardboard cutouts with little or no substance. This could be largely contributed to the lackluster English voice acting, which seems to have zero emotion or motivation whatsoever. Even in battles or emotional scenes, whenever someone opened his or her mouth, the dramatic tension just falls apart. That's how weak the voice acting sounds. And the love story between the two main characters? Very underdeveloped, unsatisfying, and just plain flat.
Speaking of dramatic tension, there practically is none in this movie. When the hero fought a demon in the subway, I was expecting something dramatic to happen, such as (but not limited to) the hero awaking his powers to slay the monster. Instead a combination of the hero's flimsy power, electrified rails, and a hand granade thrown in the demon's mouth killed it. It was just so anti-climactic. When the hero finds his father's powerful weapon, we're supposed to feel glad for him. But the way the scene was presented, I couldn't have cared less. Nothing managed to build up in that ""powerful"" moment. And I won't even mention the ending, except that it's one of the worst endings I've ever seen in anime.
Finally, the plot. It tried to fit so much into such a limited time, and this was a bad move. The characterization might've been saved if the film had been just a little bit longer, but that isn't the case. There was so much potential in this movie, and it was lost because of the shortness of the film.
To put it simply, ""Demon City Shinjuku"" was disappointing. It's interesting to watch once, but then you'll quickly realize how underdeveloped this film really is. I haven't seen the Japanese version of this film, but even a better Japanese voice track will only make me give this film three stars at best, because the flaws go beyond the voice acting. Even the fact that it's possibly a landmark in it's genre doesn't help it, because a film has to be rated upon its own merit.",1007251200,2,2634,4.829646017699115
560286,2,6303104371,"Less than average, predictable, by the numbers `gates of hell opening' anime seen numerous times before.  Reluctant, angst ridden, lazy son of previous guardian of the world must enter the demon city to do battle with demonically supercharged bad guy.  The bad guy of course killed the father in an earlier flashback, both practitioners of `nembo' which apparently is a energy flow type of traditional kendo.  Memorable more for the inordinate amount of profanity for its own sake compared to some other animes, and the odd English dub accents [English, Hispanic, Russian], than the plot.  Requisite demon bosses are easily dispatched and have no originality, mysterious neutral `Mephisto' never explained or fleshed out.  Heroine is particularly annoying, dispensing a Pollyanna air of cheer and hope while generally either getting in the way or carrying the spent hero after battles.  Compared to the seminal favorites reviewed before, this really pales in comparison. At least it was a freebie on the Action Channel.",1005782400,,1019,5.298136645962733

It wasn't only the dubbing that threw me from this film, the story was also pretty uninteresting comapred to a lot of the other anime films out there.

560319,5,6303104371,"The dvd is great - the story, characters and plot are great making this an anime worthy or one's collection.  There is one problem though - do not watch the english dubbed version: the characters' dialogue seem sappy at  times, the southern drawl and hispanic accent don't work as well as one  would hope, plus dialogue is added and or changed from the original  japanese version.  If you do decide to purchase this dvd, make a commitment  of watching it with english subtitles. You get an accurate translation and  more darker/indepth feel for characterization and what they truly say.  Don't get me wrong, the dubbed version is fine but the english subtitles  are much better!",964310400,2,678,4.826086956521739

This is the type of movie that you have to see 2 or 3 times to fully understand it.  It does have  action in it so that's good.

I cant remember all that much of the plot (I missed the first 20 minutes), but the  fight scenes stuck in my mind.  Plenty of sweet moves and they really took  advantage of not having to film with a camera.  Not much blood though.  I  would recommend this movie someone easing themselves into the anime world;  no unessisary gore, no dirty little rape scenes, and the chick in the movie  wears a pink DRESS.

560322,3,6303104371,Demon city is a mixed bag of anime. The story centres on the life of a young kempo swordsman who must travel to the forbidden city to avenge his fathers death. Aside from this typical storyline the anime features some  exellent voice casting and memorable people such as the angel Mephisto. It  has it's downside though. The main critisism is that the story might not  appeal because it lacks the depth and scope of more established  mangas. Anyone interested in this type of anime should see the  superior  Wicked city.

The only attraction that I see the the backrounds in the  animation, which put you in a magical mysterious world, but that can also  be found in other anime with a storyline and beautiful animation.  Did you  see the anime episode off road rules?

The story isn't very unique but it balances that with some good animation (great at certain parts), creative monster designs, memorable characters and great action! Colorful palette, good art style, sub par soundtrack, and a pretty bad dub (not as bad as MD Geist but still pretty bad) sum it up in basic terms.

7837512,5,6303104371,"Demon City Shinjuku is a 1988 horror-fantasy anime film based on the novel by Hideyuki Kikuchi. It is directed by the great Yoshiaki Kawajiri.

The story is about a young man named Kyoya who goes to a demonic city in order to stop a dark lord from destroying the world. Joining him on his journey is a young woman named Sayaka, a short guy named Chibi, and Mephisto.

I love this movie. It has beautiful animation, a great English dub, and an amazing atmosphere. I love the characters, the monsters, the fighting, and the story. I also love the fact that it has a wonderful happy ending. This is a terrific anime film, and I highly recommend it.",1472774400,,645,4.4576271186440675

7837514,4,6303104371,"Anime can fall flat without meaningful characters that we come to love.  When we first met protagonists like Makie (Wicked City) and D (Vampire Hunter D), they had instant appeal and offered backgrounds of intrigue or mystery.  Our hero of Shinjuku is Kyoya, a swordsman charged with protecting the president's daughter and preventing Hell on Earth.  I generally like him as ""a good guy,"" but I'm not nearly as invested or interested in him as I was the aforementioned heroes.  I'm not hating here--just identifying my single negative criticism of this movie.  Everything else was great.

Director Yoshiaki Kawajiri (Wicked City, Ninja Scroll, Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust) sure knows how to make an awesome contemporary dark fantasy.  First, an evil swordsman opens a gate to Hell after some sort of Highlander (1986) duel with Kyoya's father--who fights down to his last limbs like the Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975).  10 years later, evil demon tentacles thrash from a bouquet of flowers and kidnap the president!  That's what the world has come toevil thrashing tentacles abound.

The demons in this movie are pretty cool.  Following in his father's footsteps practicing the way of the sword, Kyoya must defend the president's daughter from their attempts at her life.

Much as Wicked City (1987) had its Black World dimension, many of the monsters of Shinjuku possess gifts of interdimensional travel through shadows, teleportation or dreams.

A bit of a throwback to the lady spider demon from Wicked City (1987), one of them is a sort of spider-centaur with a giant hermit crab claw and a toothed maw on his stomach! As if this fiend wasn't powerful enough, it teleports through the shadows.  Kyoya is also pulled into an underwater dimension to battle what I can only describe as a three-eyed demonic sloth hag.  And perhaps influenced by Vampire Hunter D (1985), the mysterious Mephisto battles a constricting succubus composed of tentacles.

Throw in all manner of lashing tentacles (at one point randomly and most amusingly dismembering a stray cat) and a villain reminiscent of Vampire Hunter D's (1985) Count Dracula complete with white hair and telekinesis, and we have a damn good time. It may not be terribly original, but it's highly entertaining.",1463788800,3,2289,5.064

If you are a fan of Yoshiaki Kawajiri's art style, you will enjoy this movie. It has his trademark ""look."" Familiar to Ninja Scroll and Wicked City.

The story is easy to follow and the movie isn't too long. There is enough cool monsters and adventure to merit the watch.
