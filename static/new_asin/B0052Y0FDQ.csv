8454737,1,B0052Y0FDQ,"The film opens ""25 years ago"" as our flashbacks have a lot of flashes. We see a man with a woman tied up as he selects the right tool for the right job. A news report informs us that he was been dubbed the ""666"" killer as he killed 6 women, in 6 days, by 6 methods. Now there's a legacy to pass on to your son.

We then jump to the present where a man is doing the same thing as a subplot. Our story centers around Jamie (Susana Gibb) who hallucinates and has bad dreams..normally after drinking one swallow from bottled water. She uses it as an excuse for being late for work as she is getting the short end of the stick in office politics.

When Jamie does come together with the subplot, it does so in an awful way. The dialogue was drab. There isn't much gore. And you only get to see a couple of the 12 killings and they were nothing to write about.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. Nudity.",1406851200,,887,4.086206896551724
8454738,5,B0052Y0FDQ,"A suspenseful, effective thriller....don't drink a bunch of coffee and then watch this movie, I nearly chewed all my fingernails off.  I of course expected a good movie when I purchased this but the plot & acting actually exceeded my expectations.",1374969600,,247,5.024390243902439
8454739,5,B0052Y0FDQ,This is a quality independent movie. Completely sucked me in and left me wanting more. Great find. This is a must see.,1374710400,,118,4.409090909090909
8454740,4,B0052Y0FDQ,"I had heard about this movie through a review online and I figured I'd pay it forward. I wouldn't call this a horror flick, more like a thriller. If you dig Saw and stuff like that you'll like this.",1362355200,,198,4.102564102564102
8454741,2,B0052Y0FDQ,"There were some things to like with ""By The Devil's Hand: The 666 Killer"" but it just didn't do it for me. The actors were pretty good but the film had a homemade, shot in 3 days look to it. I was also expecting some gore. Nope, nothing. Pass on this one unless you are a friend of one of the actors. When will these no budget, want-to-be directors realize that not every shot needs to be a close-up.",1353974400,2,400,4.075949367088608
8454742,5,B0052Y0FDQ,"Movie was recommended by a great customer. Extremely suspenseful, kept my attention, and left me wanting more like a great movie should. Reminded me of one of the great USA Up All Night movies that my brother and I would sneak out to watch after my parents went to sleep.",1347408000,,271,4.44
8454743,4,B0052Y0FDQ,"Suspenseful with the violence being more implied than shown.  Great camera work, hats off to the director and videographers.  Exellent who-done-it with suspense and a little craziness thrown in.  The interviews are a MUST see!  They had us laughing out loud.  Great value, will be watching again soon.  Definitely an independent worth keeping an eye on.",1318118400,5,353,5.214285714285714
8454744,5,B0052Y0FDQ,"By The Devil's Hands is a departure of sorts for writer/director/actor Christopher Abram whose previous films (The Fanglys, After Sundown) were straight-up horror films.  BTDH is first and foremost a thriller in the guess-who-done-it tradition of Basic Instinct and similar films.

I was surprised and entertained by Abram's latest effort, which shows the filmmaker growing in nearly every creative direction.  It isn't easy being an independent filmmaker, especially one who resides far from the Hollywood landscape in Texas.  I am very impressed by what Abram is able to create on a small budget, without sacrifices in story quality.  It reminds me of the kind of roll-up-your-sleeves, innovative style that marked the start of now-famous directors like Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino.

I don't want to ruin any surprises for those who have yet to see the movie, but suffice it to say, BTDH is worth a look for thriller-seekers.  I can't wait to see what Christopher Abram does next.",1316131200,5,993,5.2075471698113205
