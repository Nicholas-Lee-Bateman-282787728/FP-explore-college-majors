462403,3,6302374367,"Aside from the laughable 80s look, the quality of the tape itself is bad. Picture and sound are like from [an inexpensive] Malaysian copy and on my (European PAL) tape the sound is out of sync.
Eddie Van Halen is my guitar hero, I think he is the greatest rock 'n' roll guitarist of all time and he shows it in this video.
I don't like Sammy Hagar's voice and stage show.",1013472000,,371,4.166666666666667
462404,5,6302374367,"This video captures a place in time when Van Halen was having a good time on stage, Sammy was new to the band, they had a number one hit on the radio...they were rejuvinated. The opening tune, one way to rock showcases Eddie and Sammy swapping leads....gives me goose bumps....The sound is very thin, but the performances are great, I lost this video in a house fire last year, I'm glad I found it listed here, I love watching this video, if you are a Van Halen fan, regardless of the David Lee/Sammy issue...pick this up, you will not be dissapointed !",998006400,,553,4.431372549019608
462405,2,6302374367,"Now I'm a BIG van halen fan and all but this is a little weak, worst off Sammy's-I wanna be Dave-antics are a little hard on the eyes, the songs sound good but when sung by a bette milder lookalike dancing around in one of the worst outfits I've ever seen (even for the 80's) the whole thing loses its appeal.  The stage show's lacking the flavor of anything entertaining and the drum and bass solo's are 4 minutes to long.  Good though is the fact that sammy doesn't butcher roth songs but unfortunetly does a number on his own, lets also hope he works on the audience participation skills.

462406,5,6302374367,"I remember seeing this when it was first shown on MTV back in 1986 (I think). So impressed was I that I bought the video as soon as it came out.
The newly minted version of VH were in happy times and this video  clearly shows it. Listening to EVH is one thing-- to see him in action is  another.
One facet left out of pure listening to a musician is the body  gestures and the facial movements made by the musician. Eddie has a huge  grin on his face the entire time he's playing. You realize that perhaps if  you could be that happy about playing your instrument you'd be that good,  too.
But the entire band counts, too. The performance is quite good and  the music is really good too. This video helps you realize why VH is one of  the most important rock and roll bands ever.",959385600,2,779,4.1466666666666665

462408,4,6302374367,"I think if you look aside and don't take this whole 80's fashion thing to seriously you'll actually enjoy this one. Why?  The music is really good. It features the 5150 album which, lets all face it, was Van Halens last  good album and Van ""Hagars"" only good album. Besides, if you are  a fashion phobe relax. We are removed far enough from the 80's now that you  don't have to be embarrassed for it. Seriously, I think this one actually  captures the band in it's prime. No it doesn't have Dave but so what, the  live show is good. Check it out. Weather you're a die hard or casual fan  this is a good one to have.",949708800,4,615,4.161016949152542
462445,5,6302374367,"Excellent concert DVD!  Yes, it's in stereo, but that's OK.  The obvious highlight for me is Eddies 13+ minute solo, one of the best ever recorded.  Even 30+ years later, it still sounds refreshing and the standard by which others are judged.  I was fortunate enough to have seen VH, early in their careers on their first tour in 1978 with DLR. I wish there would've been a live DVD of that show, even though it was pretty much their first album and they were backing up Ronnie Montrose and Journey. This is a ""Van Hagar"" concert, full of energy and good solos.  Buy it, if you haven't already.",1489363200,2,594,4.412844036697248

Sammy Hagar's solo cds were an inspiration and influence when I first started really getting into practicing my drums, along with Rush.  Come on Van Halen is one of the most talented and influential rock bands around to this day.  The production is execellent but I think Michael Anthony demolished his own bass solo over having a Jack Daniel's Bass guitar.  Hey we are all off drugs and alcohol now so come on quit using the excuse that influenced so many peoples behavior.. Overall the memory of going to see Van Halen live in concert in Houston at the Summit, which is now Lakewood church, I think Van Halen needs to revisit the same location like I do and see the change of where influence effects the behavior and reputation of what really matters, Sobriety, so come on clean it up.

462530,4,6302374367,"Van Halen's Without a Net concert video is very good.  It is like a window in time to when the band was still at their peak even with then new singer Sammy Hagar.  The band seemed to be full of energy and really enjoy playing with each other for the crowd.  The concert looked like a lot of fun and fans were enjoying every minute of it.  I really enjoyed watching Alex's drum solo.  I think he is often overlooked because of Eddie's skill with guitar, but he is an incredibly talented musician in his own right.  There seemed to be so much positive enthusiasm with the band's music during this time period.  Eddie's guitar solo is amazing as always Eruption, Cathedral, played together.  Michael Anthony's solo starts out kind of bizarre but gets better the longer he plays.  5150 might not be full of the best Van Halen material but the concert looked like a blast.  The songs all sound very tight and technically very well done.

I would say this is a very good concert to watch but not great.  Sammy slows the pace of the show down  quite a bit by talking and goofing around.  That and the song set list is the only thing keeping this out of the 5 star range.  I enjoyed all the songs that they played I was just looking for even more.  ""Dreams"" was not played and I was surprised about that.  At first I thought it was surprising that the band would leave off so many of their old hits but then again they seemed like they wanted to start a new chapter with Sammy Van Halen Act 2.  They only do 2 of the DLR era songs ""Ain't talking bout love"", and ""Panama. ""  If you are a fan of 80's pop music or like any of Sammy's solo albums you will probably really enjoy this DVD.

Shows you what a good show was like without all the crowd surfing and mosh pits of todays hard rock concerts where people are not even paying attention to the songs or the bands performance.  Something special about that time period, whether you liked the 80's pop music or hated it you have to admit it was a great era to see concerts especially Van Halen.",1429488000,,2035,4.247395833333333

I was in high school listening to these guys and absolutely enjoyed watching this, though the sound quality issue was mostly evident during Ain't Talkin Bout Love, which was a favorite anthem.

Should be required viewing for every learning guitarist.  Shows great melody, phrasing, articulation, creativity, and most important... shows how it's essential to know how to have a great time doing it.

462669,4,6302374367,"As someone who wasn't even born when ""The Great Lead Singer Switch"" occurred, I have great appreciation for both halves of Van Halen's career. That said, this DVD makes a great intro to the Sammy era and shows that the fans would still flock to see them without Diamond Dave. Sound and picture quality are both great, far superior to ""Live: Right Here, Right Now"" where the sound was pretty good but the video was actually pieced together from a few shows (even within songs!) Sure, Sammy helped make the band somehow more grown up and more dorky simultaneously, but VH did, does, and (hopefully) will always rock. Personal favorites from this set are getting to hear Sammy's ""One Way to Rock"" with an Eddie solo, and ""Best of Both Worlds"" and ""Why Can't This Be Love"". My single complaint is that it is rather short, barely over an hour of actual songs plus the guitar, drum, and bass solos. I was shocked to find that the setlist does not include one of the biggest Van Hagar hits, ""Dreams"". Maybe I'm just spoiled by all of my 3-hour-plus Rush live albums, obviously this complaint wasn't enough to keep me from buying it. I'm sure I'll get haters from both camps for this, but here's hoping all past and present members of VH (except maybe Gary Cherone) can learn to get along and give us a 4-hour show that cover their entire amazing career.",1306022400,2,1346,4.54320987654321
462670,5,6302374367,"If Van Halen isn't the best American rock band ever, they certainly deserve to be in the pantheon of rock ""gods"", in the top 10.

The band changed massively from David Lee Roth to Sammy Hagar, changing from top 40 stuff to more metal related tones.  Ironic that they dumped an egotistical expletive deleted for someone, in the end, even worse.  But musically, Sammy Hagar was great; his scratchy voice and surprisingly sound guitar playing filled the last gap in the band, bringing it to top level.

The lighting and sound could have been better for this recording; the stage was obviously more set for the concert, where dark and shrill is good, than for the recording, where light and acoustic subtleties are important.

Don't overlook the bass solo at the end of the disk.  The bass guitarist turns his instrument into a classical bass fiddle; it is a brief but thrilling moment, over all too soon.

462672,5,6302374367,"I have been watching this video since it came out in 1986. I wore out and broke the VHS, taped the tape back together and played it several times a year until the DVD came out. I like the Roth era stuff most but I was only 10 when 1984 came out. I had to become a Van Hagar fan. My favorite track is 5150 (watch the stage lighting cues, great concert production). Shot on film, not a great transfer though, I wish they used the original film elements for the DVD but it looks like they used the old video transfer. I know somewhere there is an archive that has the original footage and hope someday they release the entire show. Rumor has it they shot 2 nights and somewhere there must be 2 full shows on film of the New Haven shows. Anyway LWAN captures the band raw and live showing the best live band of the 80's at their peak. for a Van Hagar era fan this is as good as it gets.",1258329600,2,882,4.017045454545454

462674,5,6302374367,"I recently read ""Everybody Wants Some:  The Van Halen Saga"" and was inspired to dust off this DVD and watch it for the first time in years.  Several things make this a unique show.  First off, the inclusion of 2 Hagar solo tunes (I don't even like Hagar's solo work much at all, but these 2 songs--especially ""There's Only One Way to Rock"" are sssssmokin') is at the very least interesting.  Second, although he's nowhere near as good as Eddie, it's fun to hear Sammy play some lead guitar on 2 of the songs where Eddie plays keys.  And third, this is early in the Van Hagar era, so they actually look like they're enjoying themselves.

Sammy's voice is as good live as it is on the record (I'm a Dave fan, but Sammy is a great singer).  Michael Anthony's solo is ridiculous and embarrassing, but he redeems himself with some crazy high harmony vocals.  Alex uses mostly electronic drums which leaves a bit to be desired, but he's perhaps one of the most underrated players in rock, totally overshadowed by the brilliance of his brother.  And this is from '86, back when Eddie could really play.

462698,5,6302374367,"Like another review said, not much different from the VHS version. But I think most Van Halen fans are used to this, for some reason the band (past and present) always seem to have missed opportunities with the fans. Some band involvement for DVD extras would have been nice.

I think the reason I rate this so high is because its nice to look back at a concert from that time, and thankfully they did release a live show from the 5150 tour! Being the first tour with Sammy Hagar, the band didn't really have a lot of song options to choose from so there are a lot from 5150 that we would never get to see performed live now (or in 2004 when Sammy last toured with the band).

Its also cool to look back and see THIS band when they were probably the happiest! They're actually friends at this point. Too bad the set list ISN'T longer, and if its not the full show then shame on the powers that be. We've been deprived of seeing something special.

I rate DVDs/movies according to whether I can picture myself watching it multiple times or not, and for how many years. Van Hagar will always be something I'm gonna watch and for a looooong time! LIVE WITHOUT A NET is no exception.",1211760000,,1179,4.301801801801802

Also wasn't too big on adding a pair of Hagar solo songs on it, but whatever.  At any rate, this is a pretty good showing by the boys.  It has everythings one expects from a Van Halen concert, Eddie shredding it during the songs and just totally dominating during his solo.  His solo it just mesmerizing, even if it hasn't changed all that much (who cares tho...if it ain't broke, don't fix it).

Eddie has never been better and the 5150 song riffs are awesome and tight. Camera work is good too as they jump around in tune with the songs quite well. Overall just a great time and really brings back some memories for me of the great rock concerts of the 80's.,1159833600,19,440,4.068965517241379
462705,4,6302374367,"This is for the VHS release to pretty much review what's on it. It's Van Halen's 1st tour (this being in ""New Halen"" CT.) with Sammy Hagar as front man. While I'm a much bigger fan of the David Lee Roth era of VH, this show was a lot of fun to watch. Since this concert was from 1986 all the ""Van Hagar"" songs are from the 5150 album; Summer Nights, Get Up, 5150, Best of Both Worlds, Love Walks In, and Why Can't This Be Love. Classic VH songs include Panama and Aint Talkin' Bout Love. Two of Sammy's songs; There's Only One Way to Rock and I Can't Drive 55 are also on here. And with a better band to back him up! Alex does a drum solo which was pretty much a piss break as I absolutly hate those 80's electric drum set ups. Michael Anthony's bass solo was pretty much the class clown act of the show with his Jack Daniels shaped bass guitar (and several shots of the real booze). Eddie's guitar solo was a compilation of all his instrumentals (Eruption, Spanish Fly, Cathedral, etc) from the previous albums and a sneak preview of ""316"" found on the For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge album (released 5 years later). The show closes with a ""Rock n Roll"" tribute to Led Zeppelin.

Again, this is a review of the VHS release as I've not heard good things about the DVD. If you're a Fan of the Van Hagar era then you definitly should have this in your collection. But even if you're a Diamond Dave era fan like I am, it's still a fun show",1148342400,7,1434,4.176895306859206

So we can see great guitars and great vocals. There are almost all songs from 5150"" album, and there is one Led Zeppelin cover!

What is more, no Jump (thanks God!).

The best thing is Eddie's solo, which is his finest i have ever heard, espesially those improvisations on ""mean streets"" intro.

Also very nice is part just before ""Best of both worlds"" when Sammy is singing and shouting and Eddie is trying to immitate it on guitar:)

Highlights: Get up, Best of both worlds(band is dancing all way long), 5150(Eddie improvisation during solo), Guitar solo. And of course ""Summer Nights"" - only one thing - Sam could try to scream longer during repeat of intro riff, just after solo - I love this part from album - riff, wild drumming and this long scream:)

And one more thing I don't understand - GOOD ENOUGH is not included, even though it was planned to be on it, one of the best VH songs

Even old Mitch Hagar can't spoil the festivities as the boys rope-in song after song from their oeuvre and play it to perfection.  Hagar's melodic rant against speed-limits somewhat mars the proceedings as its simplistic style is several steps below VH's standards.  But all-in-all this is a solid sonic outing from our boys and Eddie's ***damn solo is worth the price of admission.

Seeing Sam on guitar so often is something really missed from today's VH concert, even when doing the 5150 tunes with Ed on keyboard (and NOT prerecorded).

Video focus and sound quality aside, this concert is Van Halen at their peak -- a reinvented group that was to the 80's what Zeppelin and the Beatles were to previous generations.

You can tell the guys are having a great time and that's what rock and roll is all about!  High Energy and Good Times!  This DVD brings back a lot of memories and it's hard for me to believe that it's been almost twenty years since this video was made...where did the time go..

Van Halen was the premiere band in the eighties and their high energy style was an anthem of the times!  Just like Zeppelin ruled the seventies and the Beatles the sixties..for any fan of classic rock this DVD is a must have!

This DVD really highlights the band in their hey day, enjoying themselves and showing the energy playing in front of a crowd can bring induce. Despite the absence of Roth, they were still able to find success with 5150 and ride that wave of success and churn out plenty of 5150 tunes. Sammy still manages to sing a couple of pre-5150 tunes and shows he is not unfamiliar with a fret board.

The footage is good enough for me. The sound though is not the best, but considering this was recorded almost 20 years ago, you cant expect the same recording quality as today due to technological advances.

Anyone who likes Van Halen will appreciate them not just for their ability to compose good music, but also becuase Eddie is a legend amongst guitar circles for his innovative playing.

I think this shows Van Halen at best, having a good time, working the crowd and playing good music. Throw in some 80's fashion and glam and you've got an entertaining DVD.",1105401600,10,1140,4.492753623188406
462776,5,6302374367,"I have been a fan of Van Halen since I was in the fourth grade, and when it comes to Van Halen, the worst decision the band ever made was to hire Gary Cherone to be the lead singer for the band after Sammy Hagar left (it was a dissapointment to see David Lee Roth go, but Sammy Hagar was a good choice as a replacement).  So now, along with Van Halen's reunion tour that brought Sammy Hagar back and their new greatest hits album, another thing that was needed for that finally came to DVD is the ""Live Without A Net"" concert, which, while it was originally released on video, thanks to the great world of technology, it is now also available on DVD.  This concert was filmed in 1986 at Connecticut's New Haven Coliseum, and this was when David Lee Roth had been fired from the group and Sammy Hagar had been hired as the new lead singer. As already mentioned, some die hard David Lee Roth fans might not like this. But if you like Sammy Hagar and you are a loyal Van Halen fan with either David Lee Roth or Sammy Hagar (the only Van Halen material not worth having is the Gary Cherone stuff) then you will probably like this DVD. The songs on here are songs that were originally recorded in a studio with both David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar, and if you are fan of Sammy Hagar's solo material, then you are in for a treat: One song performed live on this DVD is ""I Can't Drive 55"", one of Hagar's most popular and best known solo songs.  Here you will also get to see Michael Anthony's bass solo, Alex Van Halen's drum solo, and Eddie Van Halen's guitar solo (when it is time for Van Halen to do his guitar solo, after he smokes a cigarette, he does his solo with a cigarette at the top of his guitar).  The best part on the whole DVD-by far. We have been waiting for this legendary concert to be released on DVD for years now-if you get the chance to buy this DVD, don't turn it down.",1105056000,8,1885,4.170329670329671

However, it has been unavailable on DVD until now and fans of the band are rushing to add it to their collections. This was Eddie, Alex, Michael and Sammy at a time when they were all getting along and having a great time on stage. It's fun, full of great songs and is just a great concert.

462778,3,6302374367,"The never ending debate regarding Van Halen's singers (David Lee Roth, Sammy Hagar, Gary Cheone, and most recently, Sammy Hagar again), doesn't seem even close to ending and fans are just as rude towards each other when battle lines are drawn as they were back in 1985-86. None of this affects the DVD you see on this page, however. DLR may have been the original, but Van Halen never played better than on the 5150 tour with Sammy. Edward, Alex, and Michael seem tighter than they have in years, especially compared to the 1984 tour where things with Dave were deteriorating, the band was playing especially ragged then.
The X-factor here is Sammy Hagar, a fantastic rock vocalist whose voice seems to perfectly fit the Van Halen mold. Outwardly, the band seems happier and more relaxed with Sam on the mic, and they play like maniacs, though the playfullness seems a bit forced at times. Although the Hagar era seemed to favor releasing keyboard heavy power ballads, Van Hagar released some fantastic mega-metal cuts as ""Get Up"", ""Summer Nights"", and ""Best Of Both Worlds"", and when combined with Sam's more than passable take on classic Roth era tunes as ""Panama"" and ""Ain't Talking Bout Love"", make this a riff-rock maniacs must have DVD.
But all is not well.
The sound on this DVD is not great. Ed's guitar sounds thin (for him, most guitarists would still kill for something this good), Alex's drums are all electronic with the exception of his snare, and Mike is relatively buried in the mix, though his backup singing is classic VH goodness. There are also a few weak cuts, such as the aforementioned keyboard tunes, ""Why Can't This Be Love"" and ""Love Walks In"". It's really too bad that the Hagar-ized version of VH relied so heavily on releasing keyboard tunes, because their guitar oriented tunes were so much better.
There's also next to nothing in the way of extras, something Van Halen is, sadly, well known for.
Nonetheless, the disc is worth having if you're in any way a fan of Eddie Van Halen, Alex Van Halen, Mike Anthony, and Sammy Hagar. If you're a DFF (Dave Fan First), then you probably won't enjoy it very much.",1099872000,4,2136,4.713903743315508

Edward was the master guitarist of the up and comers and this DVD proves what he could do when he's not tanked!!. The band is having a great time and the tunes rock. If you liked the DLR years (and I do) but have a hate on for the post DLR years, you're missing a very good live DVD. Sammy was fronting the band at this point and time and he was a very good choice. Sure the band dynamic changed with him in and Dave out, but life goes on. VH in 1986 was a great live band with or without Dave and this DVD proves it.

462783,4,6302374367,"First off I have to admit being partial towards this period of the group since this was the first tour of theirs I got to see. Having grown up, prior to this tour, on the DLR era of the band and then having him leave the group or get fired or whatever, I didn't think I would ever get the chance to see Eddie play live. Needless to say VH could have fallen flat on their face with a new singer but of course we know that wasn't the case. I won't get into the singer debate since it's not relevant at this point. I purchased this when it first came out on VHS so many years ago and played it till it wore out. So I was pretty happy to see it finally make it to dvd. First off, some of the comments already made are true, the disc itself is pretty bare bones. The menus are nothing special. There are no extras at all. Basically this is a meat and potatoes disc. Just the show and that's all folks. As for the video transfer, I have to agree its nothing to write home about. To my recollection, as has been noted before, this seems to be a prety straight transfer from whatever video source still exists from the original production. I agree maybe some cleaning up could have been done as I noted a few seconds of some sort of digital distortion in the final song, Rock N' Roll, but nothing too distracting. But all in all I recall the original video picture not being spectacular anyway so there is only so much you can do to bad video until you start messing with the original intent. On the other hand the sound quality I found a vast improvement over the hissy limitations of the orignial tape. The standard PCM audio is an improvement on just removing the hiss of tape! The real score is in the Dolby Digital audio which is great, but for me the surprise was finding the far superior DTS audio track as well! With improved separation and finally actually hearing bass, this was worth the price alone. Although the boys may have skimped on other dvd features we tend to take for granted nowadays its nice to see they still care about the sound! On the basis of the disc's features or lack therof, I would give it a 2 but the preformance well I have to give it the extra 2 stars for that. One might have to say Eddie and the band were in their prime in the Eighties and this show is a great snapshot of it. Having something to prove , or not, with new singer Sammy the band is in high gear throughout. Yes, you ony get 2 DLR songs but 5150 stands as a great rock album and you hear prcatically all of it here. Sure bass solos and drum solos are included which may get weary after viewing once or twice but if you love guitar at all you will be pressing repeat on Eddie's tour de force many many MANY times. Its a textbook guitar soloing 101 clinic for anything you heard in the 80s right from the master. I know I am biased from my favorable memories of that tour but having seen them on their reunion tour this month, and still kicking butt mind you, its not the same as before. This dvd is a great document of the band at a high point in their career still exhuberant and exploring the limits of their new collaboration.  This dvd is really for the fans and if new people want to check them out I would really pay no more then $10-13 for it since it is a straight ahead simple no frills disc, but you would get your money's worth for sure.",1095552000,4,3342,4.149460708782743

A time when the music was the most important thing for all of them. Indeed, this is a different band than what we see five years later on the Van Halen Live: Right Here, Right Now DVD from 1991. Here we see Sammy Hagar even picking up lead guitar duty on the keyboard ballads Love Walks In and Why Can't This Be Love. In addition to that two Hagar solo tracks: There's Only One Way To Rock and I Can't Drive 55 are incorporated into the bands set as if they were Van Halen songs. In the not too distant future egos would inflate and each band member would exist as a island on stage, but for the time being it's 1986 and this is Van Halen in their prime.

Only three stars because there's nothing special here. No special features and the new DTS and DD 5.1 audio mixes could have been better.",1095465600,57,1086,4.171428571428572
462785,3,6302374367,"I bought this DVD because I've worn out the original VHS copy I bought back in '86.  The sound quality is good, not great, GOOD.  The video quality is not the best.  I expected better from some a high quality band.  It literally looks like they copied it straight from someone's VHS copy.  If you are a casual listener of Van Halen, borrow it from someone.  This one is for the Van Halen Fanatic.",1095292800,2,396,4.283783783783784
462819,4,6302374367,"It's about time this came out on DVD.

The sound quality was wonderful and the band was at their peak for this recording.

I only wish the video quality was better.  It looks like a direct VHS to DVD transfer.

Overall, a good buy for Van Halen fans.",1095292800,4,250,4.145833333333333
462820,4,6302374367,"At the time I bought this video I was playing guitar for about 2 years....coming along fairly well....this video changed my playing in a big way.  I studied all of Eddies licks on this video and my playing advanced loads.
  The songs and tightness of the band cannot be stifled.  These guys are a well oiled machine and it shows big time.  From Theres only One Way To Rock,  to Love Walks In,  to Panama,  they rock out loud and strong.
  So if you like terrific rock n roll....check this one out.  It roars!!",1089590400,,509,4.308510638297872
462821,5,6302374367,"First off, let's not be too analytical about this video. Some of the reviewers need to chill out. I grew up listening to Van Halen. They were definitely a step up with Sammy. I thought they were great with Roth but limited. Roth doesn't evolve, this is obvious, look at him now. Sammy was successful long before Van Halen, he still is. And as I write this they are touring with Sammy again. 'Live Without A Net' was awesome. I used to own it but it got away.  Yeah, it's 80ish but some people seem to think that quality runs out when style does. That's in the eye of the beholder. As a 'true' Van Halen' fan I think this concert is the best ever because it has just the right balance between yesterday and today. That was a time when things were mostly for fun and you could wear anything. It's more fun to watch a band that is truly having fun and these guys are!! Definitely a rockin' sound.
Eddie's tech at the time was Zeke Clark. Eddie used a plexi marshall head w/ a variac transformer. The speaker out was directed into a 'load' box I believe, basically compressing it, the hard way. I did this one time and that is -part- of the secret to getting the harmonics he got. He most likely fried some heads because that is very hard on the circuitry. Variac is adjustable so you can really tune the dynamics in ways that no effects unit can do to this day. The sound is much more responsive than just running through a signal compressor. Now Eddie doesn't even come close to the sound he had in 1986. He has perfected his technique so much that it doesnt even matter what he plays through.
Michael Anthony basically had a vibe going. Thats the way Eddie wanted it. No wonder he killed a bottle of JACK. I gotta get this video again.",1086739200,,1734,4.286585365853658
462822,5,6302374367,"The boys in their prime, classic Sammy, Eddie, Alex and Micheal. Only true Van Halen need apply, Wannabees stay away,we don't want you, this is for true Van Halen fans only!! You can almost smell the JD as they are passing around the bottle.

462823,4,6302374367,"No, it's not DLR singing, GET OVER IT! This tape has its ups and downs. One thing many reviews mention is the admitidly insipid 80's fashion sense the boys in the band display. Sammy is without a doubt the worst offender, but last I looked, fashion didn't make the music, and the music is great.
The DLR/Sam wars continue to this day, and I love both eras, but here it's really evident how great Van Hagar was back in 86 and how well they played together.
Gone are the DLR raps and jokes and ""I forgot the F**kin words!"" I'm the first to admit that was funny for a while, but I'd rather see it replaced by Sam and Ed trading solos in Sam's solo hit ""One Way to Rock"". But in an effort to keep the review balanced, Sam does look like he's trying way too hard to be ""Dave-Like"" in his onstage antics.
The playing by all four members of the band is phenomenal, and with 5150 being one of their greatest albums, they had a great time playing it (and adding to the material in some cases, like the extended ""Summer Nights"" and ""5150"" solos).
The sound, however, is a little on the weak side. Ed's guitar sounds amazing because it's him, but when you compare it to the later ""Right Here Right Now"", it's thin. Alex's drums are all electric as well, and that sound was horrible from day one. Mike's bass is pretty well buried throughout the concert.
Be that as it may, the band's playing is phenomenal, and I think Sam did as good a job as DLR did on ""Panama"", but he lacks something when he sings ""Ain't Talking Bout Love"".
The VH concert set itself is boring to look at and unattractive, and the light show sucks, but who cares, it's Ed playing an extended Eruption solo like on one else. This is a bittersweet reminder of VH back in their Van Hagar glory days (for a glimpse of the DLR glory days, download the 1983 US festival show off the net).
If you're any kind of VH fan or a fan of 80's riff rock, this is a must have for your video library.",1080864000,,1943,4.2117962466487935
462824,3,6302374367,"New Halen indeed. It was obvious Sammy had a big pair of shoes to fill. I think it's evident here that he was trying too hard to upstage Dave instead of being himself. Of course when he is himself he's nothing short of obnoxious. If there's one thing you can say about Sammy it's this.... Why oh God why didn't he have someone do something with his hair? His clown 'fro just looked ridiculous the more you saw it.
Michael Anthony's bass solo was sub-par. I've seen Gene Simmons do better bass solos and that's really saying something. Alex, perhaps the ugliest man in rock keeps it tight I'll admit that, and Eddie proves he is a guitar hero to be reckoned with. But the Van Halen 'feel' just isn't there. I'm sorry and many will disagree, Sammy never fit in with Van Halen, and when he was the singer it just wasn't Van Halen. Much like Ozzy leaving Black Sabbath.",1080345600,2,865,4.37888198757764
462825,5,6302374367,"David Lee Who?  Forget the former diamond one, this is Van Halen at the pinnacle of their musical prowess in my opinion.  No explosions, no massive light show, no Vegas showroom clown behind the mic, just Van Halen doing what they do best.  A must for any Van Halen, a must for any rock fan, if you don't have it-get it!  Now , how about that DVD version?",1078704000,,355,4.176470588235294
462826,5,6302374367,"Awesome concert from start to finish. However nothing is better than Van Halen with David lee Roth. I love Van Halen with Sammy Hagar but he never even came close to David lee Roth. The Roth days is where there best music was ever written in my opinion.
However this is one of the best full length concert's I have
ever seen. No interview's it's just the entire 5150 show with an amazing drum solo from Alex,the bass solo is awesome as well.
Eddie's solo top's them all even though I'm a drummer myself,
I loved his solo on this video. For every Van Hagar fan is what
some fan's called them when he joined the band. This is a must
own for every die hard Van Halen fan.",1044748800,9,668,4.186046511627907
462827,1,6302374367,"From the opening screech ""Hello New Halen,"" Hagar quickly stakes his claim as the most annoying singer in the history of hard rock music: His voice grinds into your ear, his stage patter is low brow hedonism, his outfits are laughable, and he spends an enormous amount of time running-in-place.
On this first tour with Hagar, Van Halen were desperate to prove they could soldier on without David Lee Roth, but Roth's absence is painfully noticeable in spite of the forced camaraderie on display here.  Eddie and Sammy put on a good show of liking to work with each other, but you have to wonder whether Eddie was really amused having Sammy's armpit shoved in his face and getting kicked in the rear to the beat of his songs, on camera.  It's a quick trip down sometimes, huh Ed?
The set list of this show is pretty bland as Van Hagar had only one recording under their belt at this time, so viewers are treated to a heaping helping of 5150, with a few botched Roth tunes thrown in for the fans.  And if this wasn't bad enough, Michael Anthony is indulged with a bass solo that has you wondering why they didn't fire him on the spot and finish the show without him.
But the real shame of this concert video is that Eddie, Alex and Michael were playing pretty well as a group during this tour.  Their timing is tight, and Eddie is given solo breaks where he really stretches it out to great effect.  Summer Nights in particular features a spectacular solo.",1033084800,7,1454,4.471698113207547
462828,5,6302374367,"I was there in the audience with my best friend for this fabulous concert in ""New Halen"" Connecticut. Sammy singing DLR songs was a little awkward, but other than that it was a great show. As great as the video is, it was much better being there. They were so happy and it shows. The music flowed. Great stuff. I don't remember if they included it on the video, but the version of Led Zep's Rock and Roll they did that night was top notch. NOT included in the video was the cover of Wild Thing they did. They didn't include this because Sammy broke like three strings on his guitar and ended up chucking it offstage and just leaving all the string work to Eddie. The audio is available on MP3 for that unreleased song, well worth the effort to download it. I miss Van Halen in either of thier first two incarnations. I wish Eddie wasn't such an ego-maniac and would make up with either Sammy or David Lee. No one could Rock like Van Halen..... with or without a Net.",1016755200,,966,4.284153005464481

NOT THE BEST, BUT MUCH BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. EDDIE'S 12 MINUTE SOLO IS WORTH THE PRICE ALONE. I FORGOT HOW GOOD SAMMY WAS ON GUITAR (HE PLAYED LEAD IN MONTROSE). EVERY SONG IS GOOD, AND THEY END WITH A GREAT COVER OF ZEPPLIN'S ROCK AND ROLL. SO, IF YOUR ON THE FENCE LIKE I WAS, BUY IT, YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DID. DON'T LISTEN TO THE LOWER REVIEWS.

7825682,4,6302374367,"This is a fantastic DVD & concert, the concert is from the Van Halen 1986 5150 Tour & it really is Van Halen at the absolute top of their game.  Even a fan of the Roth era will enjoy this DVD.  The energy and the enthusiasm coming from the band on this will make anyone who is a fan of the band or even just good time rock n roll will enjoy this.  You can really tell at this point in time the band was in some of their best spirits.  Just wish they would remaster this & put it on a blu ray.  But I guess at this point in time the band is almost trying to pretend like the Hagar era didn't exist, so I guess we just have to be thankful for what we have.  Its too bad, there is no doubt Sammy was the man vocally, & this concert is documented proof.  Sound is great, just wish the picture was a little better but still a great concert for any fan to have.

Quality: Now with all that being said buyers of this need to understand the picture on this in my view is slightly better than VHS, so it could be better.  The sound is good but could be great.  We all want Van Halen to come back to this stuff & come out with a blu ray, but at this point its doubtful that's going to happen.  So buyer beware, this is a fantastic concert but don't go into it without reasonable expectations.",1503014400,,1282,3.911196911196911
