5370777,5,B009X66ED4,"This film is a beautiful, cinematic representation of the biblical injunction [I'll paraphrase]:  ""If you could but believe as a little child.""  Marcelino is precisely such a little child and it never occurs to him not to believe.  His belief is potent because of its simplicity.  There is a miracle and Marcelino is transfigured.  Yes, I would have done the last part of the film a little differently but that's a matter of personal taste.",1372377600,,440,4.8133333333333335
5370778,3,B009X66ED4,"The original is much better, it is a slow moving film.  The boy looks angelic and mischievous, but not as good as the original.",1370908800,,127,4.291666666666667
5370779,5,B009X66ED4,Very spiritual. Reveals some of life struggles other people and especially childred have gone through. It makes you think what else could you do to help.,1370822400,,153,4.923076923076923
