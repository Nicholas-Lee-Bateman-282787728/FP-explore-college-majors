5733106,3,B00CPSGI8S,"Season 5 marked the season when Becker started to lose its touch.

Some shows have a magical chemistry between the actors that make a show work.
This is not a commentary on any individuals talent or skills,  it's just a ""magical chemistry"" thing that sometimes works and sometimes does not.

When Regie left the show and was replaced by Nancy Travis, the show BECKER was never the same.
The feel and vibe of the show changed and somehow was not even 50% as enjoyable.

The disc set is OK.",1373155200,3,488,4.449438202247191
5733107,5,B00CPSGI8S,"One of the most delightful tv serie. I enjoy it very much. Pity there's no closed captions on this season, but still great. Thanks Amazon and hope the next season be avaible very soon. Best regards. Jose Luiz",1373155200,,208,4.5
5733108,5,B00CPSGI8S,These shows are great comedies. Relatively 'clean'. The characters' day to day relating can make you laugh. I can relate to the outspoken pessimistic Becker!,1373068800,,157,5.32
5733109,5,B00CPSGI8S,"Not being able to ""play all"" on the DVD should not make you give the show a lower rating. I just watched the full season and had many laughs. All the characters are funny in their own way. Chris is different than Reggie but she should be. Reggie was great but I thought this season was just as good as the previous 4. I have all the seasons and I am looking forward to season 6 coming out on DVD.",1372723200,,396,3.9625
5733110,2,B00CPSGI8S,"A big  disappointment because you have to play each episode manually.  There is no ""play all"".  There was nothing in the description to indicate that this was the case.  I never would have made the purchase had I known this.",1372204800,3,224,4.525
5733111,4,B00CPSGI8S,"As usual Becker Season 5 does not disappoint except for the disappearance of diner proprietor Reggie.  She provided an underlying glue to the series.  I have viewed the first two discs and still miss her charm and wit.  However, Danson sparkles as always with his mean spirited personality portraying Becker.  Nancy Travis as cute as she is does not provide the chemistry as much as Reggie.  But being a big fan of the show, I will suffer through it!!",1371859200,8,451,4.658227848101266
5733112,5,B00CPSGI8S,"My husband and I are big Becker fans and we absolutely can't wait until we can get our hands on a newly released season.  All I can say is if you are a fan of Ted Danson this is a must.  Once we receive the new season we watch every episode until we are done and then we go back and watch Season 1, 2, 3, 4.  We are hardcore fans.  We laugh a lot.",1371600000,,347,3.5866666666666664

5733115,3,B00CPSGI8S,"You know, I put off buying this season for over 3 years.  I own the first four and really liked watching those episodes.  I found them to be very humorous. Well season 5 is a far cry from what I am used to from ""Becker"".  First things first, as pretty much all other reviewers have mentioned, not having Reggie really takes away from this season.  I have nothing against Nancy Travis, but her and Ted Danson have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever.  And after a few episodes I felt disappointed that the producers continued with this pairing.  It is so blatantly obvious that there is no spark between Becker and Chris.  At least not one that I can see.  And the rest of the cast somewhat give a sense that things are not working.  I also noticed they had new writers who fell short with boring story lines and bland jokes. I've read that they let Terry Farrell go because they ran out of story lines for her character.  Really?  They could've went a lot of ways with her.  It's a shame that they didn't.",1485820800,2,1004,4.396739130434782

When I insert the first d.v.d. my d.v.d.player makes some kind of noise like in the opening credits of ""You've got mail"" only not so pronounced then a short message appears on my d.v.d. something to the tune of ""nosup"" or something, so I take the d.v.d out and re insert it and things are good to go.
All other d.v.d's are good. How do I know this? I sat and watched every delicious episode of ""Becker"" seasons 4 and 5 and thank God they are NOT wide screen.

Becker is still as irrationally angry as ever, but lightens up every now and then.  Chris has shown a side of him not seen before in large lumps at least.  This is a show which many people cannot enjoy because of the constant tantrums by the lead character which, realistically, would not see a person with that attitude survive for very long in NYC.

The discs are very selective as to what device they'll play in, (they're DVD-R) there are no choices as to the disc set up.  You have to click each individual episode to play because there is no ""play all"", no language selection, no closed caption, NOTHING.  In fact, there are no title and synopsis sheets included.

5733194,4,B00CPSGI8S,"Dave Hackel, who earned his stripes as a staff writer and producer on ""Wings"" under the now historic GrubStreet Productions, has created a very different kind of sit-com in ""Becker."" To begin with, Hackel managed to write a part for Ted Danson that allowed Danson to avoid what I call the ""Spock Syndrome:"" those actors who are so entrenched in people's mind as a character that they never again find satisfying work in another role. (Beware Jim Parfsons) Jason Alexander went so far as to star in (and produce) a TV sit com about an actor in this very situation because neither he, nor Michael Richards have really found a new niche after Seinfeld. The same has been true for Shelley Long. Ted Danson could just as easily fallen into this were it not for Becker. This says a great deal about how good the writing is and how good an actor Ted Danson is.

The premise is almost formulatic. We have our hero at work and our hero at home, or at the diner, in this case. Hackel manages to bring some more depth to the character of John Becker by having enough scenes that do occur in his home. By the end of the pilot we see that Becker isn't a jerk: he is a man who has little patience for idiocy and fails to suffer fools gladly. We have all, at one time or another, found ourselves in a position where we end up telling someone what a fool they are and why. It's just that Becker does it all the time. As the second season rolls in, this is a character ""flaw"" that is turned on him time and time again. (A delightful moment is when a man in a wheelchair pushes ahead of Becker in grocery line, a fight ensues and the man ends up rolling through a parking lot and down a hill.) Because our culture is so P.C. - and it's not p.c. to be P.C. anymore- the comedy on this is at Becker's expense. And it's funny. Because the truth is this: just because a man is in a wheelchair doesn't mean that he might not be a jerk. It comes acorss as back story until the end of a delightful story about a phone bill that includes a call to California that Becker swears he did not make.

John Becker is a brilliant doctor; a diagnostician, in fact, educated and well connected at Harvard Medical School, twice divorced and has set up a practive in his hometown neighborhood of the Bronx. Why is never really spelled out but if we have to guess the reason it's because Becker goes where he is needed and it seems likely that his last divorce was a doozey. Most of his phone calls begin like this: ""Hi there. It's John Becker. Don;t hang up."" He doesn't want glory even though some of his random acts of kindness could work to his benefit, he just wants to do his work and be left alone. His office staff, the onl,y thing keeping him going, is a nurse manager, Margaret (Hattie wilson) and a seemingly simple minded assistant named Linda (Shawnee Smith.) As the seasons move along we see that linda is, in fact, very intelligent and just happens to march to a different drummer. Her wisdom begins to trickle in just as soon as Hacjel has finished with the exposition of the top billed characters. Like Barney Miller and Night Court, Becker's office scenes are charged with guest appearnaces of random patients who come in for many different reasons. Some of them are knock you over hysterical and some of them break your heart. When Hackel is REALLY at his finest, one of these characters can do both. Ted Danson quickly mmakes you forget about Sam Malone and you very quickly become very find of him- there is, after all, nothing hbarderr to write than a central character who is unlikeable.

Becker's home away from is a Diner about two blocks from his office where he has been eating many of his meals for years. Because he is a doctor and is always on the verge of giving up cigarettes, he keeps his butts in the cash register at this diner- an arrangement made with the elderly man who owned it prior to the pilot. The diner is now run by that man's daughter, an ex-model from Flordai who came home for Dad's finmeral and spomehow ended up replacing him at the grill- except she can';t cook and makes the worst cup of coffee in the neighborhood. Her name is Reggie and there is a chemical tension between her and Becker right from the start. To make matters worse, she is almost as pessimistic and frustrated with the world as he and the more exposure she gets of him, the more she sees he is right and thus, the funnier the shows become because we know, that even though a relationship betyween them isn;t going to work, the checmical desire is there.

One of the best actors in this show is Alex Desert, a sighted actor who plays a blind, single man who works at the Newstand in this Diner. His disposition is generally cheerful and bright, even whgen the world dumps on him, and at times, the world dumps on him. He is, when push come to shove, Becker's best friend (Indeed one of the funnier moments in the series is when Jake, blind for nine years now, wins a 56 inch plasma TV while Becker is still twisting tin foil around the rabbit ears of the Dumont he took to college wityh him forty years ago. Becker has no qualms playing jokes on Jake and since he is a man who does not discriminate (remember the jerk in the wheelchair who ciut in front of him) he doesn;t offer special care or treatment just because Jake is blind. (though when Jake calls John in the middle of the night because he fell asleep on the train and has no clue where he is, Becker gets in his car to go and rescue him.) Add tpo this a nerd named Bob (Saverio Guerra ) who was the dork in high school against Reggie's Prom Queen and we';ve covered just about every possible character need. Bob speaks of himself in third person but not with the class that Queen Victoria did. When we meet him, he considers himself a siccess and has arrived only to rub into Reggie's face that he is succesful while she is making eggs and has lilting hair from cleaning off the griddle. Sadly, within three episodes, Bob wifes throws him out, he loses his job and these situations arise to allow him to be yet another permanent fixture at the Diner.

At home, Becker's apartment is more than modest- it is quintessential rent controlled Bronx. His windows overlook the windows of loud nbeighbors, for whom Becker has no tolerance, and in order to balance how Becker reats thohse who deserve it with respect, he is friendly, accomodating and honest with the hooker who lives in 4C, a brilliant young woman who says at one point, ""Business is great. Hey, there are some things people just will not go without, EVEN during a recession.

Becker managed to remain true to syndication by not adeding pop references (as did Will and Grace) and they even managed to skip over Nine-Eleven which occured at the start of their third season. The world of John Becker, thoughy based on a real place, is fictitious and for a sit-com that's what we want: 23 minutes of escape from the real world.

Season Five shows a cast change where Reggie sells the Diner to a woman named Chris (Nancy Travis) and it is not heavily discussed (much like the death of Coach on Cheers) which indicates contractual issues or the fact that Terry Ferell simply had had enough of four seasons; there is so much paperwork, so many people; and so many spoons in the soup with a TV show that to nail down why someone would leave is very difficult. Some are impossible to miss: When Phil Hartman's ""Bill McNeil"" left ""News Radio"" we all knew why. The murder of that actyor had been the news of the summer and the opening of season 5 for News Radio had a lot of tears for ""Bill"". My guess is that most of them were real and were for Nartman. However, khandi Alexanders exit from the show isn;t widely spoken of, but not to see the reason is to be a fool. Warren Littlefield- a genuis indeed and historically one of the most important people in television- was famous for issuing blanket directives to ALL of NBC's sit coms. There were 8 characters in News Radio and Alexander didn;t get enough camera time as it was. When NBC told 343 Pproductions they MUST hire an attractive young woman (Later famous for the Gilmour Girls-Lauren someone or other) it not only made them lose Khandi, but it began what I consider to be the downfall of one of TV's most bnrilliant shows. So speculation on WHY this cast change poccured is a waste of time. in order to enjoy seasons five and six you must simply accept it and begin to search for quality character drives in Chris as well as her relationship with the rest of the cast.

Becker is good. It's not the best television on television and it never found a solid ""home"" on any TV schedule so it's ratings and audience didn;t get a chance to build, but if you missed it at the turn of the centiury or haven;t seen it since then, It's definately worth another watch.

And THIS, by the way, is a well written critical review. I read virtually every single review already written and every single one of them should be erased so as not to embarrass the writer or Amazon. The only reasonably good reviews were from someone who calls himself robton 1212, who mamaned to eak out a single paragraph that at least TALKED about the show. The rest of you shluld be ashamed of yourselves and Amazon, it's time for you to start deleting reviews that do not even discuss the book, DVD or CD on sale. you have that right: you own the website and you have an obligation to your customer base.

One final VERY important detail: Season five does NOT have a ""Play all episodes"" function and for some of us that's a deal breaker. One of the reviewers (googoofan) felt that to lower stars because of this was unfair and that she didn't mind having to hit play at the main menu for each episode. I sent her a comment pointing out that those of us in wheelchairs with severe nerve damage (every typo in this review is a testament to peripheral nerve dysfunction) the ""Play All"" function IS a big deal, and there is no statement anywhere that suggests that anyone lowered their ratings because of this issue.

I am a consumer who doesn't look at the star rating; I read the reviews. As I said, in the case of this product, reading all 17 reviews was a waste of four minutes.

If you can tolerate the lack of PLAY ALL; if you liked Becker in the past, then go ahead and buy this.",1376611200,,10300,4.384092098377812

5733196,2,B00CPSGI8S,"SOMEHOW Reggie's disappearance pulled the show down
The episodes seem to try too hard and appear disjointed to me
Not talking about from one ep to the next
But even within each episode, it's weaker
Bob is still Bob - so it's worrying that he's gone in Season 6
Did they change writers or something?

PS
The 2nd DVD (there are 3) gets better
Not every episode but some of them have the magic that wsas in Seasons I - IV
For me, the ones without Chris (Reggie's replacement) tend to be stronger with a better story

Bob's gone in Season 6
So think that's going to dilute the show even more",1375747200,3,587,4.232142857142857
