Love the behind the scenes footage of the shop and his home and property and at the track! Love the time all the guys got together after his Michegan win and raced on his dirt track - oh man, it was a riot!
RECOMMEND, RECOMMEND, RECOMMEND!!!",1226102400,3,409,4.311688311688312
8293588,1,B001DJ69BQ,"Hi Folks,

I know  I'm running  a terrible risk with JR Nation ...but I'm giving an honest review so please respect that. I did not view this on TV..but purchased the series on DVD.  This is like Seinfeld without the laughs..a show about NOTHING! I respected Sr and have pulled for Jr because living in the  shadow of greatness is its  own burden. This series which Jr produced is nothing but a valentine from Jr to himself and his  sister and with a big sloppy kiss for their new three-way partner Rick Hendrick.
It would take 5 minutes to cover everything that happens in the first 2 hours alone....Jr needed to make a change....he moved to HMSports and now is driving for the best team in NASCAR.  Unfortunately ..we get hours of telling this simple story OVER and OVER..Jr seemingly says the same thing in front of every property he owns and every piece of recreational equipment from a pool table to golf course to bow and arrow ...zzzzzzzzzzzzzz
I actually thought I  might not  fall asleep when they talked to the guy from  Three doors Down about writing a song  for  Jr and the Guard and showed them begin to film a Video...but no song , no video..heck  that would have been SOMETHING and remember this  is a show about nothing.

I  think it typical in  todays world that celebrity is so much more  rewarded than  talent and  achievement. Jr brags about being on MTV's Cribs show..not once but twice...twice..Hmmm  isn't that how many championships Jimmie  Johnson has won..with a third coming?  I think its time for Jr to stop the back slapping and  start winning races...the last time I  looked he was clinging to the top 10.

Don't get me wrong....my low rating  isn't my rating of his driving...it  is this big waste of time show. If you want to watch Jr and his sister talk over and over about how great Jr is and how  much he loves Rick Hendrick and how hard his decision was and how right he feels about it and how  good it feels and how obvious it was and how good he feels and  how right it was and  how ....well you just got a teeny taste of ""Shifting  Gears""...",1225584000,3,2080,4.415343915343915
