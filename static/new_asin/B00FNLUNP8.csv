8617154,3,B00FNLUNP8,"Far too much over-narration and details, doesn't feel fluid and gripping like some series (i.e. BBC's Planet Earth). Expect segments of various shark data to break up your deep water viewing enjoyment. Also, the narrator's voice gets a little grating at times, you just want to turn the sound off and watch it in 3D with your favorite music playing in the room.",1485129600,,361,4.746031746031746
