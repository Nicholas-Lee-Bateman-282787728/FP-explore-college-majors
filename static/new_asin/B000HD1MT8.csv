8138556,5,B000HD1MT8,"A great expose` on how many of our thoughts are actually programmed into us, without us having a clue.

Another amazing and more up to date is The Marketing of Evil, as must read for anyone who wants to know what in the world is happening to the Wests morals.",1412208000,,259,4.18
8138557,4,B000HD1MT8,The production quality and stylistic elements of this DVD are unusual to say the least. But it tells a great story and presents factual information about a subject most people know very little about. See it and pass it on.,1184716800,,222,4.575
8138558,5,B000HD1MT8,"I purchased this from Amazon.  Watching this documentary followed by Curtis' other work, ""The Power of Nightmares,"" was for me a bit like leaving the Matrix.  It will will be difficult to view television or current events in the same way again.  Now the bad news.  The BBC has not yet released this program on DVD.  Therefore any DVD you buy will be homemade (including this one).  Also, this particular recording is missing the first minute or so of the first episode.  Still, the documentary is profoundly informative and worth the price wherever it can be found.",1182470400,4,565,4.762886597938144
8138559,5,B000HD1MT8,"This series details the untold history of the origins of public relations and advertising in the 20th Century.  It details how governments and companies have used the teachings of Sigmund Freud and his nephew Edward Bernays on how to control and manipulate the masses through use of public relations, advertising and propaganda.  The majority of the population are assumed to be irrational beings whose thoughts and desires needed to be controlled by the ""rational"" educated minority to benefit the social good, or in many cases certain groups within society.  One gets the feeling from watching this film that there is a profound disdain on the part of the powers that be in both government and industry for the common man and a desire to utilize him primarily for their own ends.  Unfortunately, the Western democracies are included in this group in addition to totalitarian states like Nazi Germany.  The film states that Josef Goebbels was a great fan of Edward Bernays and owned several of his books.  The series also describes how cigarettes were first marketed to women by appealing to challenging mail power.  It also attempted to get people to want to buy things they didn't need.  I was amazed by the content of this film and would recommend it to anyone interested in history and how organizations manipulate the masses to do what they want them to do.  You won't be disappointed.  This film is very hard to find.  So I'd recommend you buy it here.",1178668800,6,1459,4.842741935483871
