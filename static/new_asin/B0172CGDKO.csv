8737963,4,B0172CGDKO,Great show but was originally worried that it was produce or made in Canada. All the packaging was in English/French.,1464739200,,117,4.9
8737964,5,B0172CGDKO,"One of the most riveting and under-appreciated series I've watched.  Jeff Daniels is fantastic as the Newsroom anchor and the cast is perfectly balanced.  I originally watched this series through Netflix and loved it so much I bought it as a gift.  I can't say enough praise for the writers, cast and support staff- this is the best series I've seen in years!",1458950400,,359,4.666666666666667
