REX AND RINTY trivia:

Rin Tin Tin Jr. carried on the family tradition begun by his sire and namesake thirteen years earlier. The original Rinty died at age 16 the year this serial was released.

Rex was also a ""Jr."" of sorts. The original Rex the Wonder Horse took part in 15 projects between 1924 and '33. This Rex had a shorter career: four movies in as many years.

Ralph Byrd (in a minor role here) soon went on to fame as DICK TRACY. He played the comic strip character in serials and on early television.

Smiley Burnette was singing cowboy Gene Autry's sidekick in over 80 westerns. He also wrote 300-plus western-flavored songs, and sang in some films.

Mischa Auer was typecase in the 1930s and 40s as a ""Mad Russian.""

Counting serials, Kane Richmond played a supporting role in exactly 100 films.

7817534,5,630196375X,"I don 't think there'll be any argument about who the co-stars of this serial are.  Kane Richmond has to settle for 3rd billing, and the leading lady, the comic sidekick, the villian, all are strictly supporting actors to Rex, the wonder horse and his pal, Rin Tin Tin.
This serial really strikes at the heart of the 12 year old within each of us, regardless of our true age.  The only downer is the obligatory cliff hanger end of the chapter which generally shows one of the two starring animals in frightful peril.
Oh yes, the humans are important too.  Unfortunately, Kane Richmond's usual hero status is greatly diminished by the canine and equine actors.  However, Harry Woods shines as a nasty villian, and Smiley Burnette comes off as a likeable, good natured, if not overly bright, comic sidekick.
And keep your eyes open for a very minor character, a forest ranger portrayed by Ralph Byrd two years before his first Dick Tracy role.",1028678400,6,941,4.684848484848485
