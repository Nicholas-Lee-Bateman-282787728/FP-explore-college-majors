7930397,4,B0000540FG,"This DVD contains three enjoyable episodes of the fairly boring Imperfect Cell saga. I say boring because despite the fact that this is when the entire Androids\Cell saga really starts moving, it still drives at a fairly slow pace. Cell roams around various cities, sucking the bio-extract from literally every human being, while the Z fighters gather their wits and decide how they plan to destroy this new menace. In this particular DVD, we witness Goku wake up from his sick bed, the hyperbolic time chamber and the reason for its usage, and finally an astounding fight between Android 17 and Piccolo. If you don't want to miss the Androids\Cell saga in its entirety, then buy it, but if not, then just wait for the Cell Games.",1087430400,,730,4.755905511811024
7930398,3,B0000540FG,"First off, I need to say that these are some of the best episodes of the Imperfect Cell saga.  Goku awakens, Vegeta and Trunks submerge themselves into the hyperbolic time chamber, and Piccolo begins an epic, and one of the most even fights in the series, his battle with Android 17.  The DVD is loaded with previews for other FUNimation products, and contains the English and Japanese subtitled versions of the episodes.  The one problem with this DVD is the menus.  They look much nicer than they ever have before and are completely animated, but they exclude anything to identify what menu you are entering.  Getting where you want without labels or a highlight of your location on a menu is excruciatingly difficult, and becomes a major inconvenience.  I recommend this DVD all Dragon Ball fans, but it should be reminded that patience is a virtue, and you will need a lot of it with this DVD.",1018051200,,897,4.681528662420382

7930400,5,B0000540FG,This is a great video.  If you are any kind of Dragonball fan this is a very must for you.  The animation is great.  This is the best twenty dollars I have ever spent and it will be yours if you get your very own copy.,978307200,3,218,3.6956521739130435
