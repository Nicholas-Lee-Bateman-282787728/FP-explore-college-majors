8456552,5,B0054DPLY8,"Forget your unrealistic reality shows, this is real life set to the kind of music that lights every emotion on fire and yet soothes the soul at the same time. Pleasure and pain never felt so good... as much fun as you can have with your clothes on!

Christine Ohlman and Rebel Montez are a single minded soul machine, tight and focused yet playful. As great as they are on every recording they've made, nothing can compare to the energy they project live. Christine's deeply soulful vocals along with skillful arrangements by her and Rebel Montez make this an infectious collection. There are a few wisely chosen tributes to those who laid the groundwork for the Beehive Queen and a collection of originals with more hooks than a tackle box. Special guests Andy York and the Sin Sisters were a wonderful addition to this show. I was there when it was recorded and I can assure you this DVD is as good as being there but with an up-close and personal front row view.

Tracks include:
1 - That's How Strong My Love Is (Roosevelt Jamison) - one of Otis Redding's most soulful ballads
2 - The Deep End - the title cut from Christine's latest album (another must have!)
3 - Love Make You Do Stupid Things
4 - Turn
5. -Piece of My Heart (Jerry Ragovoy/Bert Russell) - made famous by Janis Joplin but originally recorded by Erma  Franklin...  yes, Aretha's sister!
6 - The Storm
7 - The Cradle Did Rock - also available on the compilation ""Get You A Healin'"", a special release to benefit the New  Orleans Musicians' Clinic: [...]
8 - Love You Right
9 - Girl Growing Up
10 - The Seventh Sons
11 - The Grown-Up Thing
12 - The Gone of You
13 - Sugar Melts
14 - The Hard Way
15 - Bring It With You When You Come
16 - The Wish
17 - Wicked Time

There's a little lagniappe too, including the newly released video of ""Love Make You Do Stupid Things"" and plenty of light-hearted anecdotes to shed some light on the stories and emotions behind the songs.

Rebel Montez is: Cliff Goodwin/guitar, Michael Colbath/bass and Larry Donahue/drums",1312243200,5,2024,4.439353099730458
