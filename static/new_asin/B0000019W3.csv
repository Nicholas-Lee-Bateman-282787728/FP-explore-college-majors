7901983,2,B0000019W3,"This production of Richard Strauss' Salome was taped in 1977 with a decent cast, but no indication on the package or the tape where it was done.  The packaging from Legato looks professional, but the tape is a badly done pirated performance, blurry at times, washed out color, and frequently jumpy.  The sound quality is just about acceptable.  Those wanting to see Caballe do the Dance of the Seven Veils as a striptease will be disappointed.  She accepts each veil from a slave, fondles them and tosses them away.  The most she lost was an earring, and this fan, who thinks she should have stuck to her Bel Canto specialty, where no-one could float a beautiful note like Caballe in her prime.",1269907200,,694,4.655737704918033
