5368463,2,B009TSA7MA,"There is nothing more annoying than watching a performance edited by people who obviously don't know their product, for whatever reason was chosen, the quick 80' style ""music video"" editing techniques where employed which often took the eyes away from the action...Micheal's playing. These techniques or so passe as to make watching this a frustrating exercises ...who cares what the drummer or keyboardist is doing during a climatic solo, we want to see Schenker's playing!. The sound quality is great and for sure this is must for Schenker fans, but some day I hope to watch a performance that justifies the genius of a performer.",1358985600,3,632,5.0285714285714285
5368464,4,B009TSA7MA,"Seriously....I'm so taken by this DVD that I can't even describe it other than.. ""Whoa!""

This is probably one of the most (if not THE MOST) incredible concert dvd's I've ever heard/seen. I'll slightly digress by making a sports analogy so please accept my advanced apology if you are not a sports fan.....

Another Michael, ""Jordan"" that is, was probably the greatest basketball player that ever lived. On a typical night for him he'd score between 25-30 points in a game. On those rare nights when he was really ""ON,"" you'd see him drop 50 points or more!

Musicians,like sports heroes, can be much the same. Michael Schenker, one of the planet's greatest guitar players, sounds better than most people on any given night. He has a multitude of live recordings to enjoy and you'll hear him on any number of his live recordings ""wow"" you with his talent. On those very rare nights, he will go ""otherworldly"" on you, much like Michael Jordan could do when he was in the zone! There haven't been many of those live recorded moments of Michael Schenker's when he was captured on a truly ""ON"" night. ""Strangers in the Night"" by UFO may be one of them (though it was actually recorded over a couple of different nights in 1978) and maybe his performance on ""One Night at Budokan."" I truly think that on this DVD, all cylinders are firing and it may very well be the greatest ""on"" moment of Michael's ever recorded!

The sound quality is phenomenal and the producer/director does a decent job of actually showing Michael Schenker when he's soloing ( I hate it when they pan to other band members during a musician's solo on most concert dvd's). The only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 stars is because Doogie White trashes many of the lyrics. He sounds great and it really doesn't affect the songs, but really, ""dude,"" learn the words! Most of these tunes are some of the greatest guitar tunes in rock music history; can't you get the words right?

It's nice to see Hermann Rarebell and Francis Buccholz on stage together again. I always thought they were an under-rated rhythm section when they played with Scorpions during the heyday of metal.

Another great thing about this recording is that Michael takes a fair amount of liberties with some of his traditional songs. He adds some more fills and/or rearranges a few of his classics and the changes really add to the songs. Wayne Findley is also fantastic on this DVD and tears up the solos in ""Rock You Like A Hurrican.""

If you like Michael Schenker or simply enjoy hard rock played with a great deal of emotion and technique, get this DVD. It's ""Michael"" scoring over 50 points!",1358899200,13,2633,4.625267665952891

5368527,5,B009TSA7MA,I am bit new to this band but was aware of some of Michael's past material so thought I would give it a shot. I am glad I did. I own over fifty DVD/Blu-ray concerts and this may become my favorite. I have played some portion of it almost everyday for the last two-three weeks. I really can't find any flaws or anything else I could ask for. The band is tight with an incredible set list. There are classics from early Scorpions and early UFO as well as MSG songs. The sound is excellent. Michael's playing is excellent as is the rest of the band. Kicking it and having a good time. The video quality (blu-ray) is excellent. If you like this genre of music  you can do no wrong with this concert. And the best thing is that they will be playing in town in a few days - I will be there.

5368528,5,B009TSA7MA,Rocks. This DVD Rocks!! Great UFO Stuff!!,1428537600,,41,5.0
5368529,3,B009TSA7MA,"Only two tracks from the Temple of Rock album were played in this show, the balance being MSG, UFO and Scorpions tracks.  Doogie White sounds good on the Scorpions stuff as he has a voice somewhat similar to Klaus Meine, but he just didn't cut it for me on the MSG and UFO tunes.  Make no mistake, he has a better range than either Gary Barden or Phil Mogg, but those songs needs someone with some grit  in their voice like Gary or Phil, and Doogie just doesn't have that.  Which brings me back to my original point:  only two tracks from Temple were played...why?  There is an enormous banner behind the band with the Temple of Rock graphics, and he doesn't play hardly any of it!!  Michael was great as always, but I think the show was weak as a whole.",1425168000,,754,4.267605633802817
5368530,5,B009TSA7MA,"Very cool. Videographer moves away from Michael too much, but that's life. The band is really tight, Michael is totally on top of his game, and clearly enjoying giving the performance. The sound is great and the picture is at least very good. Considering the performers on this effort, and the set list; this is a good DVD to own. Its well rounded.

I saw other reviews rip the singer. Why? He's not Phil Mogg, okay. Doogie White may have changed a word or two somewhere, but the guy has a really good strong voice, He did a great job in my opinion. Lets not be hypercritical.",1423180800,,576,4.383177570093458

5368548,4,B009TSA7MA,"Michael is at the top of his game here! Schenker seems to have dealt with his personal demons! I've seen Schenker may times live , and  I don't feel the singer is all that good! I feel Gary Barden was the best singer Schenker had! Great guitar work. Singer so so! That being said , it is worth getting for the guitar work",1393545600,,321,4.095238095238095
5368549,5,B009TSA7MA,"The next best thing to being there - and I've wanted to ""be there"" for nearly forty years! Missed this tour (sold out before I even found out about the date, and actually had tickets for the aborted Schenker-Roth-West tour!) Michael's concert dvd output has been as sketchy as his up and down career, so I approached this new one with a little trepidation. But WOW! WOW! WOW! In fact, I tried to form the word WOW several times watching this incredible show but couldn't due to my jaw continually dropping to the floor. At sixty years of age, Michael's playing now is not only unbelievable, but at some points on this show even better than the old days. It's all there (again): the dexterity, the tone, the phrasing, the melodic structure of the solos, the fills. The playing here rivals even ""Strangers in the Night"", generally considered one of UFO's finest performances as well as one of the great 70's live albums - and in light of the rumors that that album is a bit of a cut-and-paste affair, this performance is particularly amazing). 'Rock Bottom', though, is the album highlight, Michael's solo slowly building to a crescendo of speed and precision that literally left me wanting to get up off the couch and bow to the TV. Another highlight of the dvd is the fact that the drumming and bass duties are handled by two of the original Scorpions members (original if you don't count ""Lonesome Crow"", that is), so it's nice to hear Michael rip into all the songs he recorded with them for the ""Lovedrive"" album. Other than that, it's pretty evenly divided between Michael's solo material, UFO songs and a couple of tunes from the new album. But, it's Michael's playing throughout this show that is simply stunning, and his return to form is revelatory. Additionally, the sound quality (5.1 DTS!!!) is just fantastic!! Don't miss this!",1390780800,,1839,4.714285714285714
5368550,4,B009TSA7MA,"Film, color and sound is pretty cool; I would buy this disc for that reason, plus the fact that it contains Michael Schenker who is certainly an amazing musician.  Mostly older material is included in the performance.  Not sure about the beginning, almost like a prayer for ending wars; however no real elaboration anywhere else in the footage concerning the opening as a focal point or message?",1378425600,,395,4.880597014925373
5368551,5,B009TSA7MA,"What a concert! I almost gave it 4 stars because of Doogie.  Either the songs are out of his range or he is lazy.  I suspect it is a little of both, as sometimes he is spot on, with higher notes, then botches the words.  How do you screw up the lyrics to On and On? Or course he messed up the words to a few others, and on all of the songs, he just slurred the words to the point of not being able to clearly understand them.  Gah! It was painful to watch him reach for high notes, and even more painful that he came up singing flat a lot.  A few spots were wince worthy.  Now that I have Doogie out of the way, let me just say that everything else MORE than makes up for him.  The older Michael gets, the better he plays. He has such a clear and pure tone. It is wonderful to see him back in top form, clean, healthy, and enjoying being on stage.  And although, a lot of Scorpions fans hate Francis Buchholz, I loved seeing him back on stage, and having fun.  He was always my favorite Scorpion, and since it has been over 20 years, and nothing has been proven in court, perhaps there is no there, there. At any rate, this was a top notch concert and a top notch DVD.  The camera work was great.  Now everyone can see Michael's solos, up close and personal.  He is phenomenal.  And he plays 99.99% using only 3 fingers. He can do more with 3 fingers than other guitarists will ever do with 4.  The solo for Rock Bottom, as always, was jaw dropping.  The camera work made me feel like I had a front row seat.  And of course, they even took a shot of the obligatory upside down Marshall amp. :-) Gotta love Michael's sense of humor.  If you are a Michael Schenker fan, or just a fan of hard rock, I highly recommend this DVD.  It is AMAZING!",1373587200,,1740,4.038011695906433
5368552,5,B009TSA7MA,"Gotta admit, major Schenker fan and saw this tour and this Blu-Ray represented everything I saw. This isn't the biggest deal on earth, but the Blu-Ray DOES represent what I saw and I was thrilled!

5368554,5,B009TSA7MA,"I have been collecting Michael Schenker concerts for many years now and each of them is excellent in its own way, taking into account that different musicians and singers are featured. The constant among all of the concerts is Michael Schenker's tremendous guitar prowess and dedication to his craft. Temple of Rock is fantastic and I highly recommend the Blu-Ray version for that clear, crisp, audio and video that the DVD just can't quite provide. The band is excellent and this show is a perfect addition to any Michael Schenker fan's collection.",1369872000,,549,4.978260869565218

5368577,3,B009TSA7MA,"I'm just trying to keep it real here. I love Michael's playing all the way back to UFO and I really like Doogie Whites work with Rainbow and Cornerstone, but I'm not sure what happened here. Did he have a stroke or something? His annunciation of the words in the lyrics was bad, like he was slurring the lines. It really detracted from the great performance of the rest of band. Schenker was on fire, playing flawlessly! I really think Schenker should have just used Michael Voss for all the vocals as i think he was a much better fit and I like the fact that there would have been 3 great lead guitarists on stage! The other thing wrong with this DVD is that I wished there would have been more songs from the MSG catalog. I could have done without some of the Scorpions songs, like Coast to Coast, which is really boring.",1365206400,,823,4.316129032258065
5368578,5,B009TSA7MA,"There are a bunch of Michael Schenker DVD's out there, but I especially love watching this one cause in a way it reunites 3 of the players from the Scorpions Lovedrive album. Not to take away the fact that Michael is playing better today than he has in the past, and the great MSG songs, but the addition of several Scorpions songs he does here, even ones that were not on Lovedrive. Great to see Herman rarebell reunited with Frances Bucholz here. And I hate to say it, on a couple of songs the band does a better job than the Scorpions do today, and this coming from a huge Scorpions fan. My only 'down' moment is that while Doogie White is an excellent singer, he just does not feel like the right singer for MSG.",1362960000,,716,4.272058823529412

5368582,3,B009TSA7MA,"I Grew up with UFO and the Scorpions so I was eagerly awaiting the arrival of this set. The  music is great and it's good seeing the members of the Scorpions jam with Michael onstage again. BUT; the vocals are nothing short of horrendous. I have seen some bad vocalist's before, but this guy takes the cake. Makes Neil Young a Opera singer. Was Barden,Moog,Bonnet,Mcalley not available? It's hard to watch at times although the musicianship is great. Hope the word gets back to Michael, I really do. Him AND his legions of fans deserve better.",1361491200,3,543,4.65625
5368583,5,B009TSA7MA,"Outstanding! What else can I say? Actually, quite a bit. Like anyone else posting a review, I am a long-time fan, yadda yadda yadda... but Temple of Rock was a revelation in Michael Schenker's playing. Too many fans, myself included, have been caught in the 1980s trap that we use to measure Schenker's performance and song writing. I rather liked his association with Robin McAuley, and find his neoclassical style to have evolved over the years. Sure, his battles with substances and family drama have been noted all too well in his disappearances and bad performances in the early-mid 2000s. I have a lot of his videos, and the one from Tokyo in the late 1990s stands out for his energy. Then, in 2004, a video shot in Poland shows a hairy, bloated Michael who can barely rock in time for the first five or six songs. It is dismaying to see him in a slump like that, but this new video shows his triumphant return, and then some....

Schenker's return to form was gradual, however. I saw him in the summer of 2009 at the now demolished Angel's Road House in Yucaipa, CA, and while he put on a good show with Gary Barden at the vocal helm, he still lacked some extra energy. i don't know if it was the venue, but he hid behind his sunglasses. At times he revealed his friendliness toward the audience, encouraging people to strum the delay-engaged guitar for the lead in to ""Lost Horizons."" Move forward to the fall of 2010, and Michael is firing on all cylinders again, and I noted that appreciatively at the Key Club in LA. Gary Barden even commented he thought it was their best show yet while on the 30th anniversary tour. The set list was heavy toward the Barden-era albums, with the usual selection of UFO tracks. Amazing energy, and I got to not only strum his guitar, but high five him. He was so energetic and moving about the stage non-stop, only stopping to drink water when Carmen Appice did his drum solo. I left wowed, and felt he was better than ever, kind of like Rush these days.

2012 comes, and the long-awaited North American leg of the Temple of Rock tour finally came in the fall once again. I saw Schenker perform at the Key Club, definitely one of the better venues in my opinion, and man did he kick royal butt! My girlfriend had never been to a rock or metal show before, and halfway through the 1.5 hour set, she was using her phone to record him playing. Her favorite is ""Rockbottom,"" and truthfully, the version he played that night is much the same as documented on this fantastically recorded DVD. I have the Blu-Ray version. Schenker is throwing in the kitchen sink these days in terms of guitar techniques. he trills, shrills, thrills, and bends all at once it seems. Another tendency I noticed is that his ubiquitous wah wah pedal was barely touched, unlike the past. Perhaps it is because Marshall has modeled his heads to have a slightly half-cocked wah tone? That is the current speculation. He used the trusty black and white Dean V, as well as the new Ying/Yang model, the multi-colored V (equiped with DiMarzio Super Distortions)and the Strangers in the Night motif V for the UFO tunes. The set list opend with ""Lovedrive"" followed by ""Another Piece of Meat,"" ""Save Yourself,"" ""Assault Attack,"" ""Before the Devil Knows You're Dead,"" ""Into the Arena,"" ""Rock My Nights Away,"", then a heavy UFO set ending with the aforementioned ""Rockbottom"" and ""Doctor Doctor."" It is on that last track that my jaw hit the floor and I vocalized an astonished ""wow""! Why? Schenker is using more tritone and octave fills, and it flows so naturally that old songs are refreshingly new again.

Now to the main attraction. I was eager to see the old Scorpions members, Herman the German and Francis in action. Wayne Findlay, is, as many know, Schenker's longest-standing continuous band member. The vocal duties are largely handled by the thick-accented Doogie White, except for one track (sung by Michael Voss) called ""Hanging On"" from the new Temple of Rock album (yes, album, it is available on LP and it sounds incredible in that format). ""Into the Arena"" opens the show after the William Shatner voice over sketch. In the dark we see the band tensely awaiting their moment to hit the stage. The playlist then takes off into the Lovedrive reunion. Not sequentially, mind you, but they played ""Lovedrive,"" ""Another piece of Meat,"" ""Coast to Coast,"" a lovely instrumental, then, late in the encore section, surprise renditions of ""Rock You Like A Hurricane"" and ""Blackout,"" plus, the wonderful ""Holiday."" Those are worth the cost of the video alone.

The classic Schenker tunes are spread out, and the vocals of Doogie White, as noted by another reviewer, seem to mash poorly with the harmony. The lyrics get slurred occasionally, whether from accent or uncertainty, it is hard to guess. His high range is not really there, but he does put in an energetic performance, and engaged the crowd well. He is a funny guy though, and I think adds an element of youth, along with the fantastic Wayne Findley. The latter really seared the leads of ""Rock You Like A Hurricane."" I was previously aware of his lead-playing talents from the aforementioned 2004 video where he convincingly shreds the lead for ""Arachnophobia."" As the rhythm guitarist and keyboard player, he is a fine replacement for UFO's Paul Raymond.

Highlights? Well, I watched the DVD twice, losing much sleep. The extra bonus section shows an outdoor show excerpts from London, and the video concludes with backstage pre-concert prep. You see the band moments before they hit the stage, thereby completing an end-first editing format. The soundcheck was also a nice glimpse of how Schenker prepares, and what irritates him with sound issues. Those in the know may spot at least two Dunlop Volume Pedals onstage. In Schenker's words, those are for him to manipulate to increase the volume in the monitors, and are not a part of his rig.

I think the mix of old and new was well balanced here, and as Schenker notes in the booklet, the past was marked by Discovery with the Scorpions and UFO, experimentation with MSG, and now, the walls of the proverbial Temple of Rock are erected. His role is duly noted. Even Marshall gave him the ""11"" award a year or so ago, symbolizing the hard-living lifestyle of rock and roll. He earned it, that's for sure. What really struke me, not only in this video, but seeing him twice in LA and again in Corona, CA, is Michael's delight in playing. He is especially gracious to the crowds in intimate settings, such as clubs, and still acknowledges the crowd in larger venues, as depicted in this Tilburg, Netherlands show. Speaking of Marshall, three of his four cabinets are upside down, part of his sense of humor. While a wall of Marshall stacks looks impressive, he only uses one miked stack for any performance these days. Schenker is a BIG believer in backup, and the second head and cabinets are just that. He also doubles up on his Boss Chorus and Digital Delay pedals. Only minor setting differences there in the duplicates, and the much-needed TU3 Tuner. His wah of choice is the awesome Dimebag Wah from Hell model by Dunlop (get it, it is the best one they make). His pick preference is the Dunlop .60 nylon, and he swears by 9s (a reference to string gauge for non-guitarists). It is said, but unverified, that he prefers Celestion ""Greenbacks"" in his 4x12 cabinets. I, for one, would love to know what tubes his tech puts in those heads because his tone is damn-near perfect, and the apparent differences in his various Vs also can be heard in the extremely well recorded video.

I think fans will enjoy Schenker's liberties with the old songs, after all, you cannot live in the past and play the same exact solos you did in 1982. I think his musical journey is continuing, not the unfortunately titled review here that used the phrase ""swan song."" Schenker is going to keep putting out music, he has expressed interest in recording a blues rock album, and perhaps we shall be treated to another UFO reunion? Speaking of UFO, Pete Way makes an appearance on ""Doctor Doctor"" in London, and man does he look rough. That pasty, bloated Ozzish, English thing. Kind of like the guys in Iron Maiden, they rocked hard, and evidently played harder. Nonetheless, is was good to see him.

Is this video perfect? Of course not, but it does advance forward in Michael Schenker's extensive discography his pure talent, and the redemption that follows recovery. Enjoy!",1360368000,10,8483,4.707744107744108
5368584,5,B009TSA7MA,"Great Dvd from this guitar legend which show cases Doogie White on vocalist singing his heart out. It actually sounds great with Schenkers old music. Doogie is a great fit in his band but I'm sure hes only temporary being that hes involved in other projects. This is one great Dvd,professionally made,sounds great,has two former Scorpions players on it which is always great. Cant beat this Dvd for the performance they do,one of the best out there.",1359331200,,449,4.8441558441558445
5368585,5,B009TSA7MA,"This is a tour de force for Michael Schenker.  I have many past Schenker dvds and this one is by far the best.  His solos are spot on, note for note, and the band is tight.  I won't get into the vocals, they're good, but I prefer Gary Barden, although his voice is not what it used to be.  Michael Schenker, together with ex-scorpions, and Wayne Findlay lay it down and deliver big time!  I love the set list which includes plenty of MSG and almost half of the Lovedrive album, (Coast To Coast is great to hear live) and a nice slice of UFO.  Michael's signature song ""Rock Bottom"" is perhaps the best version I've ever heard. His solos are flawless and the energy level is high.  One unexpected gem on this dvd is to see Wayne Findlay solo on ""Rock You Like A Hurricane."" He really holds the band together.  Other highlights include Holiday, Shoot Shoot, and Blackout.  I would recommend this to any Schenker fan.  We will never know if we get to see another one like this!",1359072000,6,974,4.331491712707182
5368586,5,B009TSA7MA,"I have been a huge fan of Mr. Michael Schenker since the 70's.  I have no hesitation in saying this video and audio recording is beyond what he did in his younger years.  Through all that this man has been through, to record this is beyond inspirational.  He has always been and will continue to be one of my al time favorite guitarists!  Bless, you, MIchael--you are an amazing talent and distinguished studied musician--please keep up the wonderful music you have given us all.",1358985600,5,479,4.666666666666667

8544347,5,B009TSA7MA,"Most performers always bow to their band mates but with Michael it is about him and his guitar. I was hooked watching him play with UFO on late night tv decades ago. Great selection of songs from his whole career. Nice to see three of the first Scorpions together as well.
Of all the great guitarists Schenker and Buck Dharma stand at the top for their rock and roll chops, no guitarists pining for ""blues roots"" here just flat out rock and roll.",1517961600,,446,4.385542168674699

Michael Schenker has assembled a top notch, world class group of musicians and they all shine in Temple of Rock, Live in Europe. The video and sound quality is superb and the camera angles, lighting and color is extraordinary. Long live rock and thank you God for giving us Michael Schenker.

8544354,5,B009TSA7MA,"This is one of my all time favorite concert DVDs. The performance is great - good energy and interaction between members of the group. The audio is very good. Most importantly, the video editing is outstanding. You actually get to see Michael play during the solos - the camera is on him and doesn't change scenes every 1/2 second like many other DVDs out there. So many concert DVDs change scenes before your eyes even have a chance to focus - not this one - this is one of the finest examples of video editing I have seen (right up there with Heaven & Hell at Radio City Music Hall - which is also stellar).
Doogie does a great job on vocals - I actually prefer this to the 30th Anniversary MSG concert DVD. All band members deliver spot-on performances.
I am perfectly happy with the track selection - have watched this about 20 times and it never gets old. In fact, the performance is so good, I am considering purchase on CD as well.",1463616000,,938,4.365714285714286
