2197530,5,B0006Z8FWE,"I've become a huge Samurai film fan.  Some of my favorites are Yojimbo, Sanjuro, Ran, Seven Samurai...well, you get the picture.  Since this recently came out on Criterion blu ray, I thought I'd buy it and give it a go.  Well, I wasn't prepared for how well this film was made.  Certainly right up there with the best, if not THE best Samurai film I've seen thus far.  The storyline is great, the acting is great, the setup is great from the very beginning.  Being a film buff, this truly has become one of my favorite films of all time. Hideo Gosha is certainly a master filmmaker.  He doesn't skimp on storyline or action.  This film is definitely worth your time, whether you're a samurai film fan or not.  It's just plain great filmmaking.",1331856000,3,743,4.485074626865671

2197532,5,B0006Z8FWE,"I like spaghetti westerns, but this is two classes above them: first, in terms of psychological nuance, second, in terms of acting. This is not cardboard anti-hero movie. It's a movie for our times, with real issues, and real, flawed heroes and antiheroes. Beautifully shot, not merely competent, but brilliant. What is the role of the elites, financial as well as intellectual or military? Watch this movie, and you'll find out.",1330646400,,429,5.056338028169014
2197533,2,B0006Z8FWE,"competent Japanese spaghetti western that goes nowhere, like The Seven Samurai Lite, that is even complementing it, It is nowhere as good as the Seven Samurai and many, many others of this genre.  Lots of good sword play, mugging, shrieking, ultimately flat and nothing is accomplished.
I felt abused since I bought this on the basis of positive reviews.",1330214400,11,354,5.0
2197534,4,B0006Z8FWE,"Shiba (Tetsuro Tanba) is a wandering samurai who's seen it all. He stumbles onto some peasants who have taken the magistrate's daughter hostage in hopes of ending the corruptive leadership that plagues their land. What begins as a spectator sport and a roof over his head for Shiba turns into him fully supporting the peasants and their cause. Two other samurai; Sakura (Isamu Nagato) another wanderer with a guilty conscience and Kikyo (Mikijiro Hira) a samurai who milks the magistrate for all he's worth eventually join up with Shiba. An epic duel to the death lies ahead for the three samurai as the magistrate will stop at nothing to get revenge.

Three Outlaw Samurai begins in simple yet extravagant fashion. We see Shiba take a few steps in the mud followed by an extremely loud music cue and the title card written in Japanese Kanji. Six seconds into this chanbara film and I already know I'm going to love it. The film buys its time though as the first half of the film is mostly very talkative and swords are drawn only briefly before lengthy discussions begin once again. The storytelling is a high point as loyalty and the overall cause for all of this mayhem are always both relevant to the events taking place on screen. The cinematography is also brilliant, especially since this is the debut of Hideo Gosha. The well-choreographed and intense swordplay sequences are always captured with the most precise camera placement.

Lighting and shadows also play a big part in how the film is presented visually. The one-shot sword fight in the two-story whore house is the best example of this. Right down to the drastic lighting on Kikyo's eyes before everything goes to hell, Three Outlaw Samurai is the type of film fans of samurai, foreign, and great cinema in general dream of. There's something completely gratifying about blood presented in black and white, as well. Maybe it's because it reminds me of the Crazy 88 fight The Bride has at the tea house in Kill Bill, but the crimson liquid almost seems more gratifying in grayscale at least when it comes to older and more legendary motion pictures.

The best exchange of dialogue comes when Sakura is running across a field to support Kikyo and Shiba in the final battle. Sakura yells, ""Hey Shiba! I've done you wrong! I deserve to die! Kill Me!"" In the heat of battle, Shiba merely replies, ""I'm busy at the moment.""

While Three Outlaw Samurai may seem a bit slow at first, your patience will be rewarded. You'll become attached to the characters of Sakon Shiba, Kyojuro Sakura, and Einosuke Kikyo, get absorbed in their cause, and understand their decisions. As the swordplay and action becomes more frequent, you'll realize how truly amazing this film really is. Three Outlaw Samurai is a beautiful, well-written, and just a fantastic experience overall that is for fans of Seven Samurai, Shogun Assassin, and The Last Samurai.

Despite how fantastic Three Outlaw Samurai looks and sounds, it literally has no special features. This is a bit unusual since nearly every Criterion Collection release I've come across is usually loaded with goodies. All that's included is the theatrical trailer and a booklet with an essay by film critic Bilge Ebiri. So hopefully you weren't looking forward to this release for the special features alone.

Three Outlaw Samurai is a black and white film that's unrated and presented in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio with an uncompressed monaural soundtrack. It's approximately 93 minutes long, has a new English subtitle translation, and features high definition digital restoration. The film is now available on both Criterion Collection DVD and Blu-ray at most retail outlets and online stores.",1329177600,78,3692,4.93719806763285

Can't go wrong with this one.",1328572800,41,323,4.4
2197536,5,B0006Z8FWE,"Caught this movie on either IFC or the Sundance channels ""Samurai Saturdays"" where they would show subtitled Japanese samurai movies at 5am in the morning. As a fan of Samurai movies like Yojimbo and The Lone Wolf & Cub movies I was shocked I had never heard of the film before it aired on the channel. After seeing it I payed way too much for a Japan region version of the film online and enjoyed it ever since.

So glad this film is getting a Criterion release and will hopefully finally get its deserved recognition by samurai movie fans in the west.",1327622400,38,553,4.421568627450981
2197537,4,B0006Z8FWE,"""Three Outlaw Samurai,"" is a very decent film. What I liked about the film most was Gosha Hideo's use of the camera play in his capturing the facial expressions of the characters. In the film, three lowly peasants kidnap the daughter of the local governor until he addresses their greivances. The peasants are very inept at negotiations, and do not know how to handle the situation very well. Enter the ronin Sakon Shiba. Sakon Shiba holds honor very high, more so than any wealth. He takes sides with the peasants in their plight against the governor [a common theme: good samurai helping oppressed peasants versus the evil landlord].

Sakon Shiba is later joined by Kyojuro Sakura, a very poor samurai. While a third samurai, Einosuke Kikyo, takes neither sides at first; but he eventually becomes impressed with Sakon Shiba's code of honor and ethics. As the reviewer Zack, below has mentioned in his review, this is not a Kurosawa film [how many are?] and director Gosha Hideo definitely veers away from the typical samurai film. The three samurai eventually team up, hence the title, ""Three Outlaw Samurai."" These three outlaw samurai eventually find themselves in a battle to the death. The choreographed fighting is very good, and the films sword fighting is very violent. The acting is a bit overdone, however, it is still an interesting film that would make a nice addition to your samurai collection. Highly recommended.",1167436800,5,1430,4.98326359832636
2197538,4,B0006Z8FWE,"""Three Outlaw Samurai"" (""Sanbiki no samurai"") is a fascinating film, a blend of genres familiar to any fan of Japanese film.  I can only think of it as ""What if Mizoguchi Kenji directed a Kurosawa Akira film?""  All of the grand Samurai drama of Kurosawa blended artfully with the beautiful melancholy of Mizoguchi.

The story is a classic.  Three peasants, oppressed by their local governor, kidnap the governor's daughter and hold her ransom until their needs are listened too.  They are brave but foolish, entirely unschooled in the art of negotiation or battle, knowing only desperation and hope.  Into this mix comes Sakon Shiba, a wandering samurai who holds honor to be greater than wealth.  He instantly allies himself with the peasants against the landlord, helping them to secure their ransom.  Soon, he is joined by Kyojuro Sakura, a poor samurai who knows what it means to be hungry.  On the opposing team is Einosuke Kikyo, a fence-sitting samurai who takes neither side, but slowly finds himself being won over by Sakon's shinning display of warrior spirit and honor.

Now, if this were a Kurosawa film, the three warriors would band together in a show of cynical strength, and teach the peasants how to defend themselves and gain self-reliance and respect.  But it is not a Kurosawa film, and director Gosha Hideo taps deep into the Japanese psyche to unveil the ultimate misery of he who fights for the underdog, and how unique people must ever stand alone, excluded from the protective comfort of society.  Things do not turn out well.  Happiness is not in the cards for a single human being in ""Three Outlaw Samurai.""

Not to give it too much praise!  While highly entertaining, the film is still at its heart a chambara flick, and Hideo is no Kurosawa nor Mizogushi.  The acting and plot are overly dramatic, and every tear wrenched from a woman's face is an ocean of sadness.  But fans of samurai movie will find ""Three Outlaw Samurai"" an entertaining entry in the genre, and a great DVD to have in their collection.",1112054400,12,2035,4.801724137931035

I was so impressed by the acting, costumes and set design of the film, as well as the cinematography. The director uses zooms and a moving camera to make the audience feel like they are right there with the characters, and it also helps with the pacing of the film.

The story is about a samurai wandering through the countryside when he comes across an old mill, where a woman is being held hostage. As he learns more about the situation, he begins to sympathize with the kidnappers, who are starving peasants trying to negotiate better treatment from their local magistrate.

The movie packs a lot of action and story into a short running time, and I really enjoyed the film. I just wish there were some extras!",1467936000,,841,4.7534246575342465

2197556,3,B0006Z8FWE,"Film = 3 (three) stars; restoration = 5 (five) stars.  Director Hideo Gosha has conjured up yet another version of a samurai sub-cultural way of life in this 1964 photoplay.  The interactions between different food-chain classes of sword swingers and different/aberrant samurai honor codes within the same samurai class make for welcomed breaks between typical (more or less) slashing scenes.  The plot revolves around three samurai who are torn between the plight of the down trodden (as usual) peasants (here the lowest of the low class from which these samurai seemed to have emerged (and would probably like to--but can not--forget) and the local rulers who pay slasher salaries.  (What might make for a far more interesting script would be to explore how peasants managed to become skilled and educated samurai equal to those who have inherited samurai class standing).  Acting is for the most part dynamic (and not role-based stereotypical--facial expressions are hard to forget), and directing/editing is first rate.  Cinematography (wide-screen, black and white) and scene lighting are excellent.  Music is a bit jarring, but otherwise OK.  Subtitles seem reasonably close to the actual dialog which is a challenge to always comprehend due to the use of regional slang.  Worth watching once.

2197559,5,B0006Z8FWE,"I love a good Jidai Geki (period piece or samurai film)!  This definitely qualifies as a good samurai film.  The three samurai each have their own battles to fight in the war against a corrupt clan official who is turning an unsympathetic ear to the plight of the local farmers who have been ravaged by several bad seasons.  In an attempt to get the official to listen to reason three farmers kidnap his daughter as a hostage.  At first everyone is against the farmers but slowly the attitudes shift towards them as the story unfolds.  Tetsuro Tamba shines as the disheveled ronin Sakon Shiba who is the first to come around to the plight of the farmers.

2197579,5,B0006Z8FWE,"I bought Three Outlaw Samurai ""cold"" -- that is, without ever having seen it before, or even hearing anything about it. I was half-expecting to be disappointed, but I wasn't. This movie is just plain great.

The story concerns a group of peasants who kidnap the daughter of a corrupt local official, in the hopes of attracting his attention to the plight of the poor townsfolk. Several samurai tough guys happen to be in the area, and the plot hinges on whether these samurai will decide to help the peasants. While this scenario seems quite simple on the surface -- and I suppose it is -- director Hideo Gosha handles it expertly, generating lots of suspense and sympathy for the characters.

Surprisingly, some commentators consider this film an inferior ""rip-off"" of Kurosawa fare like Seven Samurai. I have a couple of responses to that. First, I don't think Kurosawa really invented the samurai genre, or even the type of world-weary samurai character so often played by Toshiro Mifune (e.g., the samurai character of Tange Sazen predates Kurosawa's stuff). Also, because Three Outlaw Samurai is very short, violent, and ""punchy,"" it has a different feel/tone from Seven Samurai and similar Kurosawa epics, so I don't think the two films really conflict or negate each other at all. I enjoy both styles quite a bit.

Meanwhile, Criterion's DVD of Three Outlaw Samurai has a very nice print that highlights the beauty of the film's black-and-white photography. (I'm kicking myself for not buying the Blu-Ray instead, but hey, I had no idea I'd like this so much!) There aren't any great special features to speak of, though the DVD comes with an essay that provides interesting details on Gosha's career and the TV show that inspired this film. So on the whole, this DVD gets my enthusiastic seal of approval.",1363737600,14,1813,4.899022801302932

2197585,4,B0006Z8FWE,"The reviewer of 05/05/12 gave an excellent assessment of this film, with background, and I suggest you read that essay. My own reaction is very positive, though I have some minor quibbles. The story revolves the discontents of peasants, who kidnap the daughter of the local headman in order to have some leverage for their protest -- they hope shortly to present a petition of grievances to the overall lord of the region, who will shortly be passing through. An itinerant samurai offhandedly takes up their cause, only to become more deeply committed to it and in the end drawing two other fellow warriors to pledge their support as well. Romantic subplots affect the thoughts and actions of each of the three. This film is the first by director Hideo Gosha, whose most famous effort (at least on this side of the Pacific) is Sword of the Beast, and the storytelling is sharp and compact: We walk in right in the middle of the action, and scene transitions are sometimes abrupt with the plot advanced offstage but conveyed intelligently, in the manner of a short story rather than a novel. The cinematography is excellent, as is the attention to detail, and the film packs a good number of twists and shifts for its hour and a half length. Some have dismissed it as derivative of the films of Akira Kurosawa -- in particular, that it's a poor man's Seven Samurai. And certainly in places this movie has a Kurosawa look, but so what? And as for it being a lesser imitation of Seven Sam, it's simply not. The story is similar but not identical, and the fact that a given film might not be as good as Citizen Kane or Godfather II is hardly a reason for dismissing it. I do wish that the attitudes of the entire peasant community were depicted more fully, and at times the principal women are difficult to distinguish. Those nits aside, this is an excellent if ultimately dark film",1356220800,4,1878,4.608955223880597

2197587,4,B0006Z8FWE,"I'm sure there are others--many others, in fact--who could provide you with a more detailed and historically appreciative accounting of Japanese sword-fighting movies. But if you will, place a grain of salt beneath your tongue and listen to the review of the casual viewer of Japanese sword-fighting and martial arts movies: Over the years I've enjoyed a number of Japanese movies, from the high-culture and brilliant classics such as ""Seven Samurai"", ""Roshomon"", ""Ran"", to the no-culture-but-thoroughly-entertaining ""Godzilla"" movies. Searching Amazon for the Blu-Ray release of ""Seven Samurai"" I came across the film ""Three Outlaw Samurai"" and found the story and the reviews intriguing enough to order the movie without ever having seen one frame of it. I've since played the film several times and with each viewing I find it to be an excellently told film story, surprisingly thoughtful and well photographed. Yes, at times, the acting veers from naturalistic into an almost stylized kabuki-theater brand of acting, but it never goes there for long or to the point of complete distraction. Some reviews of this film will go on glowingly about the sword-fighting. After several viewings, yes, the sword-fighting is quick and dazzling but the attraction--at least for me--is the storytelling. ""Three Outlaw Samurai"" was, for me, a leap of faith that has paid off with repeated enjoyable viewings.",1353456000,8,1399,5.363636363636363

2197589,3,B0006Z8FWE,"i found this moderately enjoyable - while the plot was slightly unusual - i kept ticking off similarities to Kurosawa films - 1 - unemployed samurai protecting the peasants - 2 - a highly skilled samurai who's a bit of a slouch and reluctant to commit - 3 4 5 etc - certain filmmaking techniques - such as wind blown dusty streets and roads

however - director Gosha Hideo lacked the finesse of Kurosawa - both visually and dramatically - still it's a damn sight better than other copycats - the story unfolds interestingly - altho the script moralized in an obvious way - the action scenes were skillfully done - but those familiar with samurai films have seen better - and while women played pivotal roles - they were no more than plot devices - but at least they were attractive

I decided to bite the bullet and pay the price before it disappeared off of Hulu, and I could never find it again.  I love this movie.  What a soulful piece of work.

For one, it has a very simple plot with extremely likeable characters to follow. Second, it's only around 90 minutes, which anyone can handle. Third, there is some very intelligent and powerful emotional themes going on with this film. And fourth, the action scenes are to die for. Seriously, the final 30 minutes features some of the best action choreography I have ever seen. Everyone must watch this, it has humor, drama, action, suspense, and wonderful camerawork. It isn't as powerful as say Samurai Rebellion, Seven Samurai, or Harakiri, but it is a lot more like a well made summer blockbuster with heart and wit.",1338076800,2,738,4.818897637795276

2197597,4,B0006Z8FWE,"When it comes to Japanese cinema during the '50s and '60s, there were many samurai films produced but with ""Sambiki no Samurai"" (Three Outlaw Samurai), it was a national sensation on television.

Airing on Japan's Fuji TV from 1963 through 1969, the drama series achieved a high rating  of 42%.  In Japan, anything over 25% is fantastic and not only did the studio Shochiku have a hot series, the three actors Tetsuro Tanba, Isamu Nagato and Mikijiro Hira became the most popular actors because of the TV series.

And with the success of the first season, Shochiku decided to create a jidaigeki film based on the characters of the TV series and ""Sambiki no Samurai"" (Three Outlaw Samurai) and give Hideo Gosha the opportunity to direct his first film.

And in 1964, ""Three Outlaw Samurai"" was released in theaters and would become a classic samurai film in Japan which would later inspire a manga series and TV sequels that would air on TV Asahi last from 1987 through 1995 (featuring newer characters) and a final ""goodbye"" drama series which aired from Oct.-Dec. 1999 which would feature the return of original actor, Tetsuro Tanba.

And now, ""Three Outlaw Samurai"" makes its first Blu-ray and DVD appearance in North America courtesy of the Criterion Collection.

The film is the second Gosha film to be released by the Criterion Collection, the first release on DVD was Gosha's second film (and his most popular film in the west), ""Sword of the Beast"" (1965).

VIDEO:

""Three Outlaw Samurai"" is presented in black and white (2:35:1 aspect ratio).  This 1964 film looks absolutely fantastic on Blu-ray.  Not only is there a good amount of grain, there is also a good amount of detail.  May it be the dirty floors of the mill or its wooden surroundings.

Closeups of the character show the sweat, grime and dirt on their faces, contrast is excellent, black levels are deep and white and gray levels are also very good.  I don't think I've seen any sort of video problems or damage while watching this film, maybe a few instances of softness but other than that, this film looks fantastic.  No banding, no artifacts, no problems that stuck out.

According to the Criterion Collection, the new high-definition transfer was created on a Spirit Datacine from a 35 mm  print struck from the original negative.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter and flicker were manually removed using MTI's DRS and Pixel Farm's PFClean, while Omage Systems DVNR was used for a small dirt, grain and noise reduction.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Three Outlaw Samurai"" is presented in Japanese monaural LPCM 1.0.  The dialogue is clear and I heard no hissing, crackles or any audio problems during my viewing.

According to the Criterion Collection, the monaural soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from a 35 mm optical soundtrack print.  Clicks, thumps, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD.  Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated workstation.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Three Outlaw Samurai - The Criterion Collection #596' on Blu-ray comes with a trailer.

EXTRAS:

""Three Outlaw Samurai - The Criterion Collection #596' comes with an 18-page booklet with the essay ""The Disloyal Bunch"" by New York Magazine writer Bilge Ebiri.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Having watched many jidageki/chambara films and dramas from Japan, this was my first time watching Hideo Gosha's ""Three Outlaw Samurai"".  And I absolutely loved it!

Sure, there is a banality when it comes to ronin who come into help the poor from evil bandits or warlords, but what I enjoyed about this film was its enjoyable story, its characters and also its swordfighting action!

For one, you have your calm, cool and collected samurai Sakon Shiba (starring legendary actor Tetsuro Tanba) and then you have someone different with Isamu Nagato's Kyojuro Sakura, a man who can fight but also a man with a conscience.  A man who helps bring humor to the film because of his demeanor.  And then you have the playboy swordsman Einosuke Kikyo (played by Mikijiro Hira), doesn't want to sully his sword with the blood with peasants but yet has no qualms about having sexual encounters with a local prostitute.

While the film is quite simple when compared to Akira Kurosawa's jidaigeki films, bare in mind that ""Three Outlaw Samurai"" is Hideo Gosha's filmmaking debut.  He obviously had magnificent company with three amazing actors who were extremely popular from the TV show, the benefit of having good writers, cinematographer and a crew.  May it be the swordfight choreography, the actors performances to its sociopolitical storyline, it's a fantastic debut for Hideo Gosha and an important film that would help ignite a career with many fantastic films in his oeuvre.

As for the Blu-ray release, ""Three Outlaw Samurai"" looks fantastic on Blu!  Wonderful contrast, picture quality looked amazing with no blemishes or problematic scenes.  If anything, I wish there were more special features outside of the included trailer.  I suppose that I have been spoiled by Criterion Collection releases that I tend to expect a lot in terms of special feature content but it does explain why the price is cheaper compared to other Criterion Blu-ray and DVD's.

Overall, if you are in the mood for a wonderful samurai film that isn't too deep, easily accessible and has a lot of swordfighting action, definitely give ""Three Outlaw Samurai"" a a chance.  Definitely recommended!",1336176000,8,5452,5.023385300668151

8044003,5,B0006Z8FWE,"I love a good samurai movie, and this doesn't disappoint.  The fencing or swordsmanship is a little rougher than other films in the genre, but the story is solid stuff.  Abused peasants take a hostage to get a better deal from their abusive lord, and three ronin are drawn away from law and convention of the time into the right and honorable path.

This film actually takes some cues from Kurosawa's films, from Seven Samurai to Yojimbo, and a couple others as well.  Even so the shooting style is a bit different, and more in style with the cinematography of more popular films of the time.  The acting is typical high energy angsty Japanese thesping, and serves the film well.  There's a kind of near comedic lighting style mixed with a kind of niore like lighting style.  You'll note the change as the film progresses.

Again, this is a really good story put together by a top quality Japanese production team.  One gets the sense that there may have been a sequel or two planned, but so far as I know there never were any.

Once again, they don't make them like this anymore, and I simply couldn't tell you why.  As much as I love online gaming, I do love a good solid film.  And that's what you have here.

Check it out and enjoy.",1505606400,2,1236,4.415929203539823
