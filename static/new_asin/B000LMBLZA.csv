2710221,5,B000LMBLZA,This is a great DVD. My son LOVES it.  He learned different animals and he also learned how to play head shoulder knees and toes.  This is the best DVD I have bought my son.  He watches this all day long over and over ago.  It never bores him.  Great thing to purchase.  I strongly recommend for toddlers.,1137715200,3,305,4.172413793103448
2710222,5,B000LMBLZA,"My son is totally enraptured with this DVD. The music is great, both for him and me. I find myself humming the songs when I'm least expecting it. Great for teaching concepts, as well, like Big, Small, Fast and Slow. Points out body parts in the ""Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes"" song. All around a great buy. Would recommend to other parents highly.",1137196800,8,349,4.555555555555555
2710223,5,B000LMBLZA,This movie is great fun for any toddler.  It is actually teaching my disabled son to move more!!,1127433600,,96,4.333333333333333
2710224,5,B000LMBLZA,"My 15 month old LOVES this whole series.  The music is great and the puppets are cute!  I like that it uses real people with a lot of babies.  My son won't sit still for anything on TV, but he begs to put these on and then won't leave the room until it's over.  Let me recommend you get the whole set so you don't get tired of hearing the same one over & over.",1124755200,2,360,3.76
2710225,5,B000LMBLZA,"My three year old really loves the Buddies! She wants to sing and dance right along with the kids and Buddies in the DVD video, and doesn't ever seem to get bored with them!

Great choice to get 'em up and moving!",1122422400,,213,4.071428571428571
2710226,5,B000LMBLZA,"My 16-month-old loves this video and has been mesmerized by it since she was a year old.  Now she loves to dance and wiggle along with the children in the video.  The puppet and yoga portions lost her attention at first, but she has learned to march and do yoga poses from watching it.  I highly recommend it.",1122249600,,309,4.293103448275862
2710227,5,B000LMBLZA,"We have two other 'Curious Buddies' DVD's ('Exploring at the Beach' & 'Look and Listen at the Park'), and my 18 month old just loves them. She's had the others since she was around 12 months, and they've always been her favorites. But 'Let's Move' will probably replace them - it's the best so far!! The songs are great, the interaction with the ""Buddies"" is fun, and it really does get her to ""move""! She'll even stretch and rest when they do. I highly recommend any of the 'Curious Buddies' DVD's, they're all adorable - especially this one!",1121040000,6,543,4.551020408163265
2710228,5,B000LMBLZA,My 9 month old seems to like this video a little more than some of the other Curious Buddies DVDs and I think it's because of the nonstop action! The DVD contains lots of footage of children dancing and moving all around to music and with the puppets. He really enjoys watching the other kids move. The music is really catchy too! Even my 4-1/2 year old daughter likes this video. I highly recommend it!,1118361600,2,403,4.386666666666667
2710229,5,B000LMBLZA,This is really cute and easy for my grandson to follow and to relate.,1411430400,,69,4.0
2710230,5,B000LMBLZA,"Girls loved some songs. Which in a next version should be queue-able (like ""head shoulder knees & toes"" song start!!!",1407110400,,117,4.9

2710233,5,B000LMBLZA,It is cheesy but my 2 year old loves it.  Even my 7 year old will dance when it is on.,1401753600,,86,3.0952380952380953
2710234,5,B000LMBLZA,My 2 year old can't get enough Curious Buddies! I had a large collection of the dvds years ago but got rid of them when my daughter out grew them. But then came another baby so I bought them all again. They are very interactive and keep them engaged. My 2 year old loves to sing and dance along,1393977600,,294,4.0
2710235,4,B000LMBLZA,My 2 year old son LOVES it. Watches it over and over again. He likes to dance with the characters.,1383264000,,98,3.95
2710236,5,B000LMBLZA,"Well, after raising 6 kids and now working on grandkids this is the first REALLY REALLY good exercise dvd I've seen since the 1980's!  The music is great, the ""Buddies"" are adorable, and it was impossible to watch without wanting to play with all of them!  This dvd was chosen to use for ""exercise time"" in our toddler's nursery at church.  It's difficult to find something that's based specifically for that age group but Curious Buddies is perfect!  The ""Buddies"" have delightfully childish voices and attitudes, and have the same non-fluid motions of a toddler so our little ones will definitely feel like they're working out with friends.  My adult daughters previewed the dvd with me and none of us wanted to walk away...we just laughed and smiled through the whole thing!  Great purchase :-)",1380499200,,797,4.866666666666666
2710237,5,B000LMBLZA,I have a 2 yr old and a 3 1/2 yr old and they both love this video. The little animals are super cute without being annoying. The songs are fun and keep them moving. It could probably be a little longer (my boys will watch it twice in a row before growing bored with it) but other then that it's perfect.,1379289600,,304,3.9193548387096775
2710238,5,B000LMBLZA,"My daughter wakes up after a nap and says, ""Buddies!""  haha. Clearly she LOVES them. This from a little girl that has absolutely NO interest in the television. So yes, I will always recommend Curious Buddies.",1374105600,,208,4.777777777777778
2710239,1,B000LMBLZA,"ok--
my daughter loves music and likes almost all music videos. especially dancing and especially with kids involved!
this is downright stupid and she was uninterested after 2 minutes.
the video was made in 1990 which got me nervous since i thought it was a recent movie. the songs were so dumb and there was not much movement.",1371254400,,327,4.655172413793103
2710240,4,B000LMBLZA,My son loves theses curious buddies videos. I just wish they were longer but the songs are very cute and catchy.,1370217600,,112,4.380952380952381
2710241,5,B000LMBLZA,love this Dvd my grandkids are 2 and 3/1/2 they both love to watch ..great product and price too ..thanks so much ..,1366675200,,116,4.086956521739131
2710242,5,B000LMBLZA,I wish there was a better way to title this review but it's pretty accurate. The first time we turned on Curious Buddies he say motionless for 24 minutes and only looked up to ask me to play it again. He loves it still.,1364428800,,219,4.0
2710243,5,B000LMBLZA,"very cute dvd , wish they made more so i could buy more! love it for my neice and nephew",1363737600,,88,3.45
2710244,2,B000LMBLZA,"DVD is very short, could not keep my sons interest. Might be better for 18 months and under.  The only good part was the yoga.",1358553600,,126,4.04
2710245,4,B000LMBLZA,"The cute toddlers, animals, colorful puppets, and catchy songs kept my 3 yr old entertained. This DVD is worth it.",1354492800,,114,4.75
2710246,5,B000LMBLZA,I had gotten one of these movies as a gift for my son Hte Curious Buddies Let's Make Music and he loved it. I got to the point of him standing by the Dvd player asking for it to be played. So after we had to watch it 20xs a day I decided to oreder a few more for some varitey. Just like the first one he loves the new ones too. Most of the time he isn't sitting watching he is dancing around the living room. And he actually does lean a lot form them. He says some more words and repeats many things they say. I would try these movies out!!,1345420800,,540,3.7876106194690267
2710247,5,B000LMBLZA,"I rarely give any product a full 5 stars but I wish I could give this 10. What a fantastic video. Not only is the music catchy and clever, but the production both video and audio is top notch. They also cleverly sampled toddlers laughing and speaking and use the audio samples as the puppets speech so my son thinks he's really connecting to these puppets. The sets and puppets themselves are so simple, yet brilliantly designed and every skit (minus the tortis and the hare which he always gets up and leaves... and it is in fact very drawn out and boring) are enthralling. Did I just review a baby's DVD ? Yes, I did . And I've probably seen this video a hundred times with him hahaha!! He always runs in to our room and begs for Curios buddies!!",1341446400,,748,4.3120567375886525
2710248,5,B000LMBLZA,"Delightful DVD with simple characters, I have bought 2 now, 2-years old or so can't seem to tear themselves away from it and will watch it over and over.",1323907200,,153,4.310344827586207
2710249,5,B000LMBLZA,"We started watching this video with our 2.5 month son and he immediately loved it.  It was his first video. The third time he watched it he started cooing along with the puppets singing ""I've been working on the railroad"".  My husband and I say it was his first sing-a-long.

I'd recommend this dvd as a first video for any infant.  We'll be getting more of the Nick Jr. series dvds.",1323043200,,383,4.352112676056338
2710250,5,B000LMBLZA,"We have all of the Curious Buddies videos and this is one of the best.  My nine month old loves it and I'm sure he will still like it for quite some time.  ""On the Farm"" is our other favorite of the Buddies videos.  I really like that these repeat play so we can just let it loop in the background all day long.  My little one gets bored REALLY easily and this helps to stimulate him more so he's not so fussy.  Curious Buddies are his favorites.  He's not too into the Einsteins but my older son LOVED those, too.  This is a great video.",1316563200,,538,4.018867924528302
2710251,5,B000LMBLZA,"My seventeen month old grandson stops everything to watch this video.
Very sweet and entertaining for baby. Easy to change diaper with this going.",1314057600,,146,5.125
2710252,5,B000LMBLZA,"I have a very very busy son. He is nine months old and still will not sit with me to watch a childrens program or sit with me and let him read a book. These Curious Buddies videos are the only ones that seem to entertain him. I have one at my home and one at my parents home for when we go for dinner. I think what peaks his interest is the bright colors and the constant sound of music. He claps, dances, and talks to the dvd, great pic for a very busy child!",1311552000,,460,3.8020833333333335
2710253,5,B000LMBLZA,We own every one of the Curious Buddies DVD's.  Our Toddler loves them and dances and moves with the kids and Curious Buddies...I recommend you purchase these!,1310515200,,159,4.888888888888889
2710254,5,B000LMBLZA,And the music is not just a bunch of synthsized nonsense like most children's shows. Not annoying to have running in your house.,1308096000,,128,4.608695652173913
2710255,2,B000LMBLZA,"I bought it for my stay-at-home toddler, 2 years old, so that we could have a fun DVD that he could move around to while he was stuck inside during the long cold and rainy/snowy winter. Despite raving reviews stating otherwise, he'd look at the screen maybe once or twice then run off and go do something else.  It's not difficult to hold my son's attention (Dora, Thomas, and Team Umizoomi command his participation wonderfully), but for whatever reason he finds this DVD very boring and not worth his time.  I don't know what makes other kids love it so much, but I had to put it out there that my son has no interest in it in the slightest.  We'll try it again with my second child that's due in a few months, but for now it was a wasted purchase.",1299110400,,750,4.267605633802817
2710256,5,B000LMBLZA,Lost this video and took me almost a year to replace it. By this time my daughter was 2 yrs old and she remembered it...She was so excited to watch it again. She's only allowed to watch 1 video a day and picks it over and over.,1295568000,,227,3.851063829787234
2710257,5,B000LMBLZA,If your little one likes Jack's Big Music Show they will love this video.  My daughter was given a few of these videos for her 1st birthday and she will sit and laugh at them.  She is almost 2 and she is now getting more involved with them and still loves to watch them.,1292198400,,270,3.9814814814814814
2710258,4,B000LMBLZA,We bought this for our son when we first adopted him and it was a great way to interact with him and get him moving until he understood us a little better,1291334400,,154,3.84375
2710259,5,B000LMBLZA,"I was given this DVD as a gift for my daughter who is now 5 and her younger sister 2 years old also loves it. it's actually fun for the whole family to do. it is very well done, the voices, songs, children and puppets are all adoreable. it's so nice to get kids moving in front of videos instead of sitting like vegetables; I wish there were more videos like this out there to get kids and families moving together. we just love this and highly recommend it!",1291334400,2,458,4.157303370786517
2710260,5,B000LMBLZA,My kids LOVED this movie so much I have bought it for a gift twice now. All my friends love the music and are not irritated by hearing them over and over and over again. Very cute!,1283472000,,180,3.891891891891892
2710261,5,B000LMBLZA,"My daycare of kids from 2 - 7 LOVE the curious buddies. Its got a section for warm up activities with some yoga poses. Songs like Ring around the Rosie and Head shoulders knees & toes gets them giggling each time. The noodle buddies have HIGH ENERGY dancing. Every aspect is PERFECT for mommy who needs the kids to get their energy ""out"" and get them to nap well.
If you ask them they would vote to ""watch"" curious buddies everyday. I try to save it for rainy days (or days when its too hot outside) It gets them moving and singing. I enjoy the upbeat music as well. Five stars FOR SURE!",1275868800,,587,4.20353982300885
2710262,5,B000LMBLZA,Both my kids (now 4 & 2)loved all the Buddies DVDs from 1yr to 2yr. old. They were absolutly the best!  They both learned a lot from them which was just a bonus.  If you need some time to make dinner or just have a break from chasing a wild one year old this will do it.  I have recommended to friends and received unsolicited rave reviews.,1260316800,,340,4.044776119402985
2710263,5,B000LMBLZA,"My kids love the Curious Buddies and this DVD was a tough one to find. They originally saw it on demand on Cable TV. When I went to look for the disc, it seemed to be out of stock everywhere. Someone on Amazon was offering it for $70. While it is a great DVD and my kids love it, that's a little steep. Luckily a few months later another Amazon seller offered it and my kids have been enjoying it for weeks now.",1253577600,,411,3.963855421686747
2710264,3,B000LMBLZA,"I rented this from Netflix to see if my toddler and I would like it. It's cute and my toddler watched it, but for the price, I think it's too short. 30 minutes of kids dancing in a park, and puppets stretching/playing tag... it's just not worth it to me. I would not purchase this DVD for $10 or more.",1248912000,3,301,4.033333333333333
2710265,5,B000LMBLZA,My 2 year old LOVES this DVD!! It is great to get the kids up and moving on a rainy day.  It's also cute and fun.,1246233600,,113,3.3461538461538463
2710266,5,B000LMBLZA,"My toddler daycare children love this video.  They are always asking to watch their exercise video.  It gets them moving on days when it's too wet or cold to go outside.  They stretch, march, jump, do yoga, wiggle and bounce and overall have a great time.  I would say good for children ages 1 to 5.  I highly recommend this video.",1241308800,,331,4.360655737704918
2710267,5,B000LMBLZA,My kids love to watch this at least once a day. They move and grove to the music. Good for ages 1-5 years.,1239840000,,106,3.652173913043478
2710268,5,B000LMBLZA,"Its a hit in our house!  The songs are great and modernized, the visuals are easy going and fun, and the yoga...jeez...could you get any cooler?  My 16 month old girl has a good time whenever its on and the songs have a tendency to stick in mom's head.  Good stuff!!",1226966400,,266,4.176470588235294
2710269,5,B000LMBLZA,"This is a great kids' exercise video.  My daughter STILL loves it and she's almost 5.  A bunch of people (and puppets) in this thing are affiliated with ""Jack's Big Music Show"", so it's got a similar vibe, but is made for littler kids.  It's fast-paced and fun and one of the few videos we have that I've also bought for friend's kids.",1226707200,2,335,4.285714285714286
2710270,5,B000LMBLZA,"My son loves this movie, first saw it when he was about 15 months old and he caught on to the yoga in it. Does the downward dog often. Also has nice bright colors and catchy music. Fun for parents too.",1226016000,,201,3.926829268292683
2710271,5,B000LMBLZA,"My 3 year old daughter loves this video. She asks me to put it on daily and then does all of the moves with the video. She stretches and dances and moves and laughs. She is very good at doing the simple yoga poses, too. It makes me feel good to let her view a dvd with so much interaction. It is so much better than the ones that she just sits and watches.",1223251200,,356,3.824324324324324
2710272,5,B000LMBLZA,My one and two year old daughters watch this movie over and over.  They have learned new yoga moves and like to dance along with the children in the movie.  I would like to purchase other Curious Buddies movies!! Excellent movie!!,1212796800,,230,4.585365853658536
2710273,1,B000LMBLZA,"This was the first kiddie DVD that I've noticed my son showing disinterest for. He loved the Baby Einstein series. Loved the Mommy and Me DVD. This one had boring puppets ""stretching"" and kids at a park setting dancing. The yoga moves were too quick to copy. What a disappointment.",1209772800,,281,4.64

2710275,5,B000LMBLZA,"I bought this for my 19mo old to supplement my order for free shipping. Turns out this video was more worth while than the product I was originally purchasing. My baby girl absolutely LOVES this video and so do my 5 and 7 year old nieces...even I do the excersises along with the Curious buddies and the kiddies on the DVD. I like the fact that it is a very outdoorsy video, displays various yoga poses and the music and singing are fantastic. There is even a sort of country style spin on the traditional ""Ring ARound the Rosy"". Awesome DVD...your child will love it and so will you as it isn't annoying at all...very well put together.
Go for it!!!",1188518400,2,650,4.380165289256198
2710276,4,B000LMBLZA,I bought this for my son when he was 11 months old.  He did not really want to watch it then but now loves the dvd at 2 yrs of age.  It keeps him entertained for the whole duration of the video which is great for us.,1188345600,,216,3.574468085106383
2710277,5,B000LMBLZA,"My son 1.5 years loves it more than baby einstein. He likes to follow other kids to move. His favorite part is the head, shoulder, knees and toes although he only touches his knees and toes. He also likes the 'falling down'. i really recommend it if you like your little heart doing some small exercise.",1184371200,,303,4.428571428571429
2710278,4,B000LMBLZA,"This (and the whole Curious Buddies series) features puppets that bear a striking resemblance to those on Jack's Big Music Show - it is a Spiffy Production - so if your kids are already stoked about getting up and dancing to the music on Jack's, they'll regard this as another Super Swell Dance Party.  I gave it four stars because my toddler boys do get up and spaz around to it as I had hoped; but, parents, if you appreciate the gentle humor of Jack's, you may want to turn this on and leave the room, because there ain't no funny gonna make anyone older than five guffaw here.  It makes Elmo look like Noel Coward.  It is adult-annoying to defcon level Barney.",1184371200,,664,4.382113821138211
2710279,3,B000LMBLZA,"My daughter loves the ""Look and Listen at the Park"" and the ""Farm"" ones. This one has alot of yoga moves in it...and unbelieveably...not much dancing or moving. That's what I purchased it for b/c my daughter loves to dance...but the other 2 mentioned above are better for dancing in my opinion. This one is probably better for kids over the age of two.",1171756800,,352,4.515625
2710280,5,B000LMBLZA,Cute movie for the kids.  Encourages them to move and dance.  I think all of the Curious Buddies movies are great!!!,1171238400,,116,4.476190476190476
2710281,5,B000LMBLZA,"My 20 month old daughter LOVES this DVD.  It's a great DVD on cold and rainy days for us to ""work out"" together. My daughter knows the four main characters by name and does their animal sounds when introduced. I also like that it introduces her to concepts of fast/slow, small/big and counting to 10.  I brought this to my sister's home over the holidays and at one point had 5 kids all up and moving.  Ages ranged from my daughter's age up to 5 years old.  It was a lot of fun.",1168300800,2,478,4.10752688172043

2710283,5,B000LMBLZA,"I bought this for my daughter (18 months) b/c she loves to dance but I never knew she AND my 6 year old son would have so much fun with it.  She now asks for it calling it ""eyes"" b/c of the head, shoulder, knees and toes portion and has learned concepts like big, small, fast, and slow.  Even my 5 month old is facinated by it.  I put it on while I'm cooking and I get to finish cooking dinner in peace.  EVERYONE should have this video for their kids.",1158192000,3,452,3.934065934065934
2710284,5,B000LMBLZA,"We bought this video to give our daughter something to watch & listen to.  She doesn't watch a lot of tv, BUT, absolutely loves this video.  She loves seeing the kids playing and dancing and likes the colorful puppets.  He favorite part of the video is the Head, shoulders, knees & toes 'video'.  She's 13 months and has almost got the whole 'dance' down.  The songs on this video aren't annoying to me or my husband - in fact our favorite is ring around the rosy (it is quite nice!).

One quick note in reference to another review...  The yoga sequence is in the video purely for fun, exercise and streching (the names are cute and the poses are fun to do), not as a means of enlightenment; in fact there is no reference to any type of religion in the video.  It's a singing, dancing and moving video JUST as the title states.",1154908800,16,827,4.324675324675325
2710285,5,B000LMBLZA,"Within minutes of starting this DVD, both of my kids (2 and 5) were up on thier feet jumping, stretching, and havin fun! It is a nice mixture of puppetry and real kids doing the exercises. The puppets are adorable. The transitions between songs/activties is attention-getting.

After watching ""Let's Move"" he does the yoga poses through out the day.  When he's watching it he dances around with a big smile... not even ""Baby Einstein"" has that effect on him  :)",1145836800,8,287,4.4423076923076925
2710288,5,B000LMBLZA,"the thing i love about this dvd is that your child does not just sit there mesmerized by the screen like when they watch television shows.  instead, ""let's move"" has your child jumping around, shaking her hands and feet, and singing along.  she actually gets exercise!  also, it's only 30 minutes long, and when it's over, she says ""bye-bye"" and that's the end of TV time.  it's my favorite of her collection so far.",1142294400,4,416,4.581081081081081
