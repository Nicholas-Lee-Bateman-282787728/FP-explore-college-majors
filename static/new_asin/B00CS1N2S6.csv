5736638,2,B00CS1N2S6,"This film does not have poor production values, the acting isn't bad, and it's not made in someone's back yard with a shakey-cam, but it's just not a good film.  The concept is murky, the film is confusing and it just doesn't reach out & grab you or fill you full of dread...it's just rather dull and flat.  A man has gone to get vaccinations prior to going to Africa on his honeymoon, has a serious reaction & ends up in the hospital.  He is visited by some guy holding a rosary that claims he is some kind of entity, a fallen angel, if you like, and the man is asked to prove himself by killing 5 people.  It turns out the man happens to be an architect & he & his fiancee were involved in some shady dealings that caused a building to collapse.  There is an ex-cop on the trail of the contractor these people worked for because his young daughter died in the building collapse.  How does this all fit together, you may ask?  I was asking myself the same thing.  The answer is, not very well.  Do youself a favor and pass on this one.  The other two very short reviews were, well, by someone who knows someone in the film & the other was lusting after a young policewoman in the film...neither are good reasons to see the film.",1376784000,3,1229,4.213675213675214

5736672,3,B00CS1N2S6,"This could have been a great movie but they must of run out of time or money in the production part of things. The story comes to an abrupt halt.

5736674,4,B00CS1N2S6,This movie is well acted and has a decent story line. It also has a twist at the end that gave me chills. It's only my opinion but this is a very good movie and I would actually watch it again.,1402876800,,193,3.731707317073171

5736679,4,B00CS1N2S6,"I watched this late at night to wind down and it fit the bill. The story is off the beaten path. Its not an oft seen plot that was recycled. So, that gives it an edge, as compared to a lot of the other lo budget, indie horror flicks that abound in these parts. The camerawork was fine. Nothing fancy but nothing bad or cheap or poorly or amateurly executed. The acting ranged from good to ok, and the lead protags gave it an 80s feel (for me, anyway). Nothing realistic here... so if you need that, or don't care for suspension of disbelief, then look elsewhere. My favorite character was the main antagonist, Dr. Death or whoever he was supposed to be.  It was fun. Kinda like a graphic novel.",1401667200,2,694,4.297709923664122
5736680,2,B00CS1N2S6,"An interesting movie rendered mediocre by the writers need to do too much. This film has two intersecting story lines that by their own right, had they been fully fleshed out, could have made two separate and interesting movies. Instead what you are left with is a movie that tries really hard to be deep and instead comes off as slightly pretentious.

The police ""thriller"" portion is rife with one dimensional characters, cliched character backgrounds, barely likable characters, and unbelievable scenarios. Police procedurals are hardly ever accurate when it comes to actual police work and investigations but this movies stretches so far beyond what is believable that Law and Order looks like a documentary in comparison. For example, the main couple discover evidence that important case breaking files had been tampered and erased and while the moderately sane one comments that there are software that makes retrieving deleted files possible, the blindly idiotic one actual says something to the effect of, ""I have a better idea, let's just go talk to the person who deleted the files, I bet she knows something."" Really? It's an idea sure but I wouldn't call it better when you can get actual hard evidence AND talk to the witness. Not that it matters anyway because their whole fiasco of an investigation is one giant middle finger to the viewer. The whole story line, first of all, felt secondary to the horror story line and felt like it was written simply to fill the time. The romance between the two main characters is rushed, the resolution is ham-fisted and again rushed, and....actually everything in this movie is rushed. Perhaps that should have been the title.

The horror portion of the movie was descent, featured better actors and, while hardly original, still managed to be entertaining though you pretty much guess the ending after the first few minutes. Nothing is going to surprise you in this film and nothing is going to scare you unless you find jump cuts scary. I actually can't go too much into what was wrong with this story line without ruining whatever brief enjoyment you might get out of it.

So would I recommend this movie? Well, while two stars on here is essentially 'I didn't like it' in my world two out of five is more of ""meh."" If you were considering renting or buying this then don't. If, however, you have prime membership and the time to waste then go ahead. It's definitely not the worst movie I've see this week.",1401580800,,2464,4.834123222748815
5736681,1,B00CS1N2S6,"Movie night with my friends turned into randomly picking this movie. I wish we would've just watched a blank screen. The acting was terrible, the plot? Or was there a plot?

5736682,1,B00CS1N2S6,This is not what I call a horror movie.  This is a B flick ROMANCE movie attempting to disguise itself as a horror flick.  Best to wait for this made for kids channel type flick to come out free.  Save your M-O-N-E-Y.  I can see why so few have seen this movie and or reviewed it.  It's not very good at all in fact it's actually boring.  For real horror fans.  You should know that five deaths occur and not one spot of blood-gore or seat jumping scenes occur.  I fell asleep during the flick and finished watching it while eating toast on a Sunday morning.  That just about sums it up.,1400976000,,587,4.169642857142857

5736686,4,B00CS1N2S6,interesting perspective of good and evil and choices. Some a little far fetched and story line was weak but a good movie,1399161600,3,120,4.5
5736687,4,B00CS1N2S6,"First off..this is one of those movies where the ending is up to your own interpretation. Seriously, you'll wonder if what you just saw was real of if it was something else. So if you don't like open ended movies this isn't for you.

The movie isn't perfect. There are two separate stories that run parallel throughout the movie. One I couldn't get enough of and the other I just wanted to skip.

The storyline that follows the detective that lost his family due to the collapsing building was relatively boring and poorly acted, however the other storyline more than made up for it.

The second storyline follows the architect that built the building after he falls into a coma. Presented with a deal, he has the choice of either dying or killing 5 people to get his life back. The whole thing unravels as you slowly see him lose is soul but the ending will leave you wondering if it was real, if he's still in a coma, or if he's really just hallucinating. Both the writing and acting for this storyline were well done and it genuinely leaves you with a very creepy feeling.

I'd definitely watch this again...probably skip the detective parts though.",1387584000,,1152,4.577669902912621
5736688,2,B00CS1N2S6,"5 SOULS tries to be a slick and original horror film, but it simply has too many flaws that it can't overcome.  The result is a convoluted tale that leaves the viewer wanting more.

I really wanted to enjoy this film.  The premise sounds solid and director Brett Donowho has another film out there that looks really good (A HAUNTING AT SILVER FALLS) as well.  But it can't overcome its problems.  As the credits rolled, I actually felt kinda sad.  This movie could have been so good.

5 SOULS is shot pretty well, although there are several grainy shots and a few of the low-light scenes look too dark.  The acting is ok, although Steven Schub stands out among the rest of the cast as the evil `demon' who is forcing him to collect souls.  Schub relishes his evil role and portrays it with the dramatic flair of a Shakespearean actor.

There's no special effects or gore to speak of, but there are plenty of opportunities where it could have been used.  I'm not sure if this lack of showing was due to budget constraints or resource issues, but I feel like the production team dropped the ball here.

The biggest problem 5 SOULS has is the story itself.  I think I know where Donowho was trying to go with it...but unfortunately, it never gets there.  Instead, the film is a jumbled mish-mash of scenes that don't tie together much at all.

I do have to give credit to the DVD cover, however.  It is creepy and effective, a certain draw to watching the movie.  It's just a shame that the movie doesn't live up to the cover's promise.

I can't recommend 5 SOULS with a clear conscience, unless you have nothing else better to watch.  I think the premise of this one is solid, and I would like to see a reboot of it...but only after some major script rewriting and a budget boost.  Hopefully Donowho's other films will not be this bad.",1378252800,,1833,4.431137724550898
5736689,1,B00CS1N2S6,"First sign of cheap is no subtitles for a movie that has poor and inconsistent audio levels and at times poor enunciation. Difficult for normal hearing and inconsiderate towards hard of hearing. Second sign, and very unusual, is no chapter/scene option in opening menu.
As for the movie, unbelievable characters ranging from evil angel doing the same old stupid parlor tricks such as twisting his hands to make his victim contort; floating in the air for no apparent reason while talking to his client; acting like a drugged out bizarro, etc. Then there is the female cop who ends up quickly looking like a hooker and just as quickly acting like one with a stranger in a bar, of course (just more unbelievable stereotyping). Then there are the typical bad people developers placing money above human safety despite a couple of building collapses (cheap and brief, thank goodness, CGI). A not clear script as to where it's ultimately going with the story other than people die in several boring scenes and we have a new angel of death. The end.",1378166400,,1043,4.8
5736690,3,B00CS1N2S6,"This is an odd film that is an existential mystery. Noah (Ian Bohen) finds himself in a coma talking to the angel of death (Steven Schub). He cuts a deal. He lives if he kills 5 people. This aspect reminded me a little of the film ""Subliminal.""

In a subplot Sam (Steve Bacic) and Sara (Allison McAtee) are investigating a collapsed building. The two subplots tie together about an hour into the film.

This is one of those films that is well made for the genre. It kept me interested, yet frustrated at the lack of clues. The ending was interesting but was a bit preachy. It is more of an experimental indie style film that is not for everyone. Don't expect a major league horror film as depicted on the cover.

8585502,1,B00CS1N2S6,"I'm a little teensy tiny bit torn about this film. The film overall was just one nasty out of season oyster. The little pearl I found hidden in it was the actor Steve Schub. He plays his part as a netherworld soul collector quite well. He manages to make the most of what he had at hand. Then again this could have been because I was hunting for something, anything to save this film. It's a two camera production so be ready to have the scenes bounce from one side to the other through out.
