8405074,4,B003THMIWY,"The story is simple. Jilted lover, Ian Hunter, meets Bette Davis on her lunch break while watching his ex-lover's wedding. Bette takes him under her wing and they get married. The ex-lover decides she wants him back again, but Bette fights for him.

Bette Davis shines in this thin-plotted movie and makes it worth watching. I also enjoyed the dialogue and the frank discussions between the cast. Alison Skipworth, who plays a landlady with a colorful past, rounds out the story.",1496534400,,479,4.91358024691358
8405075,5,B003THMIWY,"The Girl From 10th Avenue was released in 1935. It starred Bette Davis, and Alison Skipworth  provides great support. A classic soap opera, made fine by the young Bette Davis, early in her film career. Fans of Bette Davis will like this the most.",1494806400,,246,4.590909090909091

8405080,5,B003THMIWY,Saw this on TCM and loved the story and the acting. Retro to be sure but still relevant to today. A young Bette Davis should not be missed.,1398038400,5,139,4.0
8405081,5,B003THMIWY,Bette Davis didn't love making these early films much but I enjoy seeing her make the most of these movies.,1377216000,,107,4.4
8405082,4,B003THMIWY,"this is a delightful and fast-paced story that showcases Bette's amazing range and scintillating personality.  With Ian Hunter (with whom she acts again in ""That Certain Woman""), she has such a natural and easy rapport (as she does with all her leading men!).  A sheer pleasure.  A unique story, witty dialogue.  A good addition to a Bette Davis collection.  Must see a second time to really appreciate.",1356825600,8,403,4.955223880597015
8405083,4,B003THMIWY,"Bette is always great, but I particularly enjoyed Mr Hunter. Only recently discovered this actor and the wealth of 1930's movies he was featured in.  Also a good performance by Colin Clive who is nothing like Dr. Frankenstein here.",1284163200,10,231,4.923076923076923
