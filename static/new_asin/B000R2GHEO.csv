2856935,3,B000R2GHEO,"The writer of this screenplay has obviously studied the ""coincidence genre"" of screenwriting, where many lives conveniently intersect in ways that affect the characters and the outcome. And that's fine--many movies have done wonderful things with the idea of chance.

The problem here first and foremost is that the weight of the conclusion just isn't validated by the sum of the parts (and that's all I can say about that without spoilers). Instead, the result is almost pathetic. There is nothing profound or insightful here unless perhaps you are a young person who has a fatalistic view of first loves.

On the positive side, the movie is well made and atmospheric, and the actors are endearing, if lacking depth. There seems to be a promise of something special building from the opening scene but sadly it's never fulfilled.",1356480000,5,830,5.007246376811594
2856936,4,B000R2GHEO,girlfriend picked this out for us. we almost thought it would be depressing - stick with it and it turns out to be just charming. very real the way the characters relate to each other. we are the kind of couple that definitely prefers non-american romances on screen - this romantic comedy touches you all over in a tingly good way.,1340496000,3,332,4.459016393442623
2856937,4,B000R2GHEO,"For a movie with a comic premise not to make light of a serious subject matter such as death, the director must negotiate a delicate balance. To this end, the movie turns out be very refreshing. The two main characters are very affecting and the script is well written with some very witty lines. If I were to wish for something more from this movie, I'd like to see a slightly beefed up plot and character development. But these deficiencies are nicely compensated by the accompanying sound tracks and the Barcelaona backdrop. Overall, a very enjoyable and somewhat thought provoking movie. A small warning - the subtitles go really fast at the beginning, but you should be able to catch up after a while.",1205280000,6,706,4.701612903225806
2856938,5,B000R2GHEO,I love this movie. This is the best movie spannish in 2006. It's a comedy about suicide and death.,1188604800,4,98,4.2105263157894735
8198452,5,B000R2GHEO,"[Minor Spoilers] I saw another reviewer comment that it seemed that the director of ""Your Life in 65,"" Maria Ripoll, comprehensively studied screenwriting and that this was too obvious in the film, then only gave it 3 stars.  Well, I find that fascinating since, for example, ""Forrest Gump,"" was indubitably a by-the-numbers film, way too obvious in trying to please the viewer, to the point of being condescending, yet people still bent over backwards praising it (even inexplicably giving it the Best Picture Oscar over ""Pulp Fiction"").  Another perspective of ""Your Life in 65"" (the title of which refers to the teacher of one of the lead characters always limiting students' papers to 65 words or less) would be that it's a film with majestic, imaginative storytelling that's all its own and whose exquisite beauty lies in its meticulously crafted landscape.  Three young Spanish men (Franciso, Ignacio, and Dani), with an unconditional friendship, go to the funeral of someone they think they knew from school, but it just turns out to be a young man with the same name, though Dani had a girlfriend in common with him.  By the time this becomes clear, however, Dani is smitten with the deceased young man's sister, and they know that they must collectively and respectively back out of the situation, with this day-in-the-life being the viewer's extremely memorable and touching reward, surely to get etched in your heart and soul.  Don't let the language barrier stop you from seeing this wonderful film! Highly recommended!  [Spanish (from Spain) with English subtitles]",1483920000,,1578,5.096899224806202
8198453,1,B000R2GHEO,"I fell asleep during this flick--so much chatter. Boring. Guess it is black and white, like cilantro, you either like it or not.",1393632000,,128,4.608695652173913
8198454,5,B000R2GHEO,A must see. The pains of finding your one true love and losing it in an instant. It was funny yet heart felt all in one!!!,1392422400,,122,3.730769230769231
8198455,3,B000R2GHEO,"But I never rooted for any of the characters.  The script could have dug deeper into their stories, esp the protagonist.  The theme of 'coincidence' starts tiring after awhile.  The ending also felt stunted and anticlimactic.  BUT this movie was beautifully shot and produced and leaves you feeling like you're in the heart of vibrant Barcelona.  For that reason, I would recommend it!",1383523200,,385,5.0476190476190474
8198456,3,B000R2GHEO,Some of the movie was ok but the boys were mostly annoying and disrespectful. The end was kind of strange for me. Wouldn't watch it again.,1380153600,,138,4.346153846153846

8198458,4,B000R2GHEO,"if you cannot summarize your life in 65 words or less, then your life is much too complicated...this film, though minimally flawed, is a perfect example. worth a couple hours of your life.",1370476800,,188,4.7272727272727275
8198459,4,B000R2GHEO,The view of young men and love and dreams was wonderful. The end was more of an idea than psychologically compelling. I still enjoyed the film.,1364083200,,143,4.538461538461538
8198460,5,B000R2GHEO,"It involves a lot of other things but that is what jumps out to me as being the overriding and pervasive theme of it. Other than that thing I just mentioned, my review would be in agreement with what pinPong already said in his.",1363824000,,228,4.204545454545454
8198461,4,B000R2GHEO,Committing suicide due to happiness. Is very simple and neat and easy to follow. The music soundtrack is nice as well.,1360886400,,118,4.666666666666667
