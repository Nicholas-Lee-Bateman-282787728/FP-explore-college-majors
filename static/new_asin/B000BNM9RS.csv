8089344,3,B000BNM9RS,This movie is showing it's age. HBC doesn't disappoint. Lynn Redgrave was wicked. Touching movie for the day (late 80's) about relationships and friends and those mindless parties everyone wanted to attend to meet people.,1426896000,,221,5.3428571428571425
8089345,5,B000BNM9RS,"One of my favorite movies, finally on dvd. With famous names, and some fine acting, the most memorable thing about this movie is the emphasis on being a nice guy. This is the movie where the shy introverted nice guy grows and gets it right. Not unlike many other efforts to do the same, but this is done in an adult way, without pandering to, or dismissing, the messier parts of real life. (""40 Year Old Virgin"" comes to mind as an example - that that one is more outlandish.) Gently British, it is accessible to most people - no outlandish accents or cultural references interfere with an average persons understanding. A gentle movie all in all, it makes me smile.",1415232000,,666,4.512396694214876
8089346,5,B000BNM9RS,"Excellent!. What a lot of fun we had viewing this comdey,  clearly describing the British Society at this time. Jesse Birdsal plays  wonderfully convincing a  male Virgin, Getting it  right aint easy these days. The more as he appears to be torn apart  between 3 Options of loosing his "" virginity""  to three diferent types of women. Top voting for Helena Bonham Carter , playing a quirky - so called higher daughter with her very own ideas of solving her life.",1389484800,,461,4.62962962962963

8089349,3,B000BNM9RS,"This movie I have had in my collection for over 20yrs. When it came available on DVD at Amazons I purchased it. Its worth watching just for its values. The actors in this movie where not known to me except for Helen Bonham Carter and Lynn Redgraves who comes from that fine acting family. Jesse Birdsall plays Gavin a 31yr. old hairdresser living at home with his parents and still a virgin HA HA. and still looking for the right partner. Gavin has a strange friend who has strange friends and they have even stranger friends. Gavin friend is invited to a party at one of these friends home he invites Gavin to come along here he meets Lynn Redgraves who has these party when her husband goes away. This is where Gavin losers his virginaty. In this house in the basement lives the character played by Helen Bonham Carter a very strange person indeed she thinks Gavin wants to marry her so she arranges for him to meet her father Gavin escapes just in the nick of time. Gavin finally looks at Jenny who's played by Jane Honocks and works with Gavin as an assistant to the hairdresser she's very plain not  well educated  but with some work she would be ok. Jenny too has a secret and not wanting to be hurt again is not sure, she's been hurt before when she was younger she ended up having a child to her first and only boy friend. Well this is the movies and all works out well for all concerned. May be a movie to watch with the children only if they are over 16yrs old just for its values not jumping in to bed with the first person thats comes along the sex might not be great as you think, being talked into marriage when its not right for you. Alright  you may have to wait a longer time for the right partner but GETTING IT RIGHT  may same you a lot of heartache in the years to come. PS I have a 37yr. old still at home and still looking.",1348444800,,1845,4.203389830508475
8089350,5,B000BNM9RS,"I really liked this movie.  It's been years since I've seen it... and quite frankly I'm surprised it hasn't been released on DVD yet.  Especially when you consider the major actors that are in the movie (Jane Horrocks, Helena Bonham Carter, Lynn Redgrave, John Gielgud).  Actually the two main characters in the movie were not major actors when the movie was made (Jane Horrocks and Jesse Birdsall).  Jane Horrocks went on to do so many other rolls (she is most famous for her performance as Bubbles in Ab Fab).

The movie revolves around the main character Gavin Lamb (played by Jesse Birdsall).  He plays a man in his late 20's or early 30's.  He's a hairstylist, and he is not gay (although most of his friends are).  Gavin lives a boring life with his suburban parents.  He takes the bus into West London to work in a beauty salon with a poncy older boss, Mr Adrian (played by Peter Cook).  Gavin's best friend Harry (played by Richard Huw), is gay... and he also works in the salon.  Jane Horrocks plays Jenny... a nice shy quiet girl who does the odd jobs in the salon.  Gavin at first doesn't notice Jenny all that much... but that changes in the end.

Gavin goes about his boring life, while his friends and family attempt to get him out more.  This is where the story gets interesting.  One night Harry takes Gavin out on the town to a house party in a fancy loft flat on the South bank owned by a colourful woman called Joan (played by Lynn Redgrave).  Gavin loses his virginity to Joan later on in the movie.  But while at the party Harry brought along some of his other gay friends one of which is the handsome, vain and dim Winthrop (played by Kevin Drinkwater).  While Winthrop is playing in the bathtub with his current boyfriend Lady Minerva Munday (played by Helena Bonham Carter) is waiting nude in the bed, waiting for Winthrop to get out of the bathroom.  Gavin makes the mistake of entering the bedroom and bathroom, to use the toilet, and that's when he sees Winthrop in the tub.  As he backs out, out pops Lady Minerva nude out of the bed.  At this point Lady Minerva decides that Gavin is worth following... and boy does she.  She ends up following Gavin home to his parents place, and she ends up sleeping on the sofa.  It gets worse, as the more Gavin tries to dump Lady Minerva the more she follows him.

Lady Minerva is quiet literally nuts, and she convinces herself that Gavin is perfect husband material.  She actually manages to trick Gavin into coming to her parents house to meet her parents (played by John Gielgud and Judy Parfitt).  John Gielgud did a splendid job at doing a working class accent, while Judy Parfitt plays the perfect drunken mother.  At first Gavin want to get out of that house as fast as he can... but Sir Gordon Munday (Gielgud) who at first thinks Gavin is after his daughters fortune, changes his mind and encourages the match in order to get rid of his daughter.  Gavin makes a runner when he realizes that the entire Munday family are crazy.

To sum it all up, Gavin's life has changed since the night of that party.  Whether it be running from Lady Minerva Munday or the one night stand (where he loses his virginity) to Joan (Lynn Redgrave), Gavin develops courage.  The finally speaks back to his boss, and he finally realizes that he likes Jenny (Jane Horrocks).  Eventually he falls in love with Jenny and her infant son... (a son he had no idea she had, since he never made any attempts to know Jenny in the beginning of the movie).  The movie ends, when Gavin finally develops enough courage to get married to Jenny.

It's a lovely story.  I was actually quite hooked on this movie for a few years.  It's a feel good type of story... in an English sort of way.  But I love English movies.

I don't have this flick on VHS, and it's been years since it was shown on tv, so I haven't seen it for a while.  I'd love it if it came out on DVD.  I would certainly recommend it.  If you like ""Shirley Valentine"" or ""Educating Rita"" then you would probably like this movie too.

As a small note, there was a pop song played at Joan's party that I never forgot.  It was a song done by the West African musician Mory Kant called ""Y K Y K"".  This song was very popular in Europe... but it was never big in North America.  It was a catchy tune.  It's unusual to hear African music in a British movie... but I never forgot it.",1177372800,3,4381,4.379652605459057
8089351,3,B000BNM9RS,"In fact, anything Colin Firth is in is quite good.  I haven't seen this movie in a while, but I do remember that it was quite charming and Colin Firth really makes the character very likeable.",1170374400,,192,4.333333333333333
