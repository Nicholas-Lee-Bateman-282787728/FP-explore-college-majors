1661650,5,B00005TNFN,"Great DVD. This is an absolute ""must"" for the Gordon Lightfoot fan! Gordon looks great en sings even better. I think Gordon is a very friendly person. I`m very pleased with this video, because I didn't have the chance to see Gordon live. It's a shame that Gordon doesn't come to Europe for a concert. I live in the Netherlands (that small country in Europe with the capital Amsterdam). For the fans in Europe: buy the US-version of this DVD it contains 22 songs in stead of the 14 songs on the European version. But if you do so, don't forget to buy a region-free DVD-player!",1014681600,7,575,4.433962264150943
1661651,5,B00005TNFN,"My wife and I have seen Gord several times and have loved the experience.  This DVD gives us the opportunity to experience the concert whenever we'd like.
Audio and video are supurb, the DTS 5.1 mix is especially smooth and lifelike.
Typical Gord Gold!
Buy this DVD!",1014595200,4,266,4.659574468085107
1661652,5,B00005TNFN,"Excellent concert video that plays just like Lightfoot--straight ahead, great playing.  His voice may have changed a bit over the years but he still plays and sings great--and still writes great songs.  And, of course, the band is awesome.  Highly recommended.",1012694400,5,260,5.2926829268292686
1661653,3,B00005TNFN,"The audio and video quality of the DVD is excellent.  I liked everything about it EXCEPT Gordon Lightfoot's voice.  I will admit that I have never seem him before and have been a long time fan through his older albums only.  It was news to me that his voice has changed so much.  It is higher and much more nasal.
I realized I was expecting to hear the voice that had sent chills up my spine and had touched my heart so many times.  No disrespect intended to Mr. Lightfoot but I was disappointed.",1012435200,7,496,4.23404255319149
1661654,5,B00005TNFN,"This is Lightfoot's first concert video, and is in fact his first officially released live recording since 1969. Recorded at the Pioneer Theater in Reno, Nevada on April 19, 2000, the video captures the warmth and intimacy of a Lightfoot concert, brought into your home for the first time.
The DVD contains 22 songs, almost the entire concert. Lightfoot performs all of his hits - songs that charted in the top 40 for him - as well as songs he wrote that were hits for others. And he includes some of his other great songs which, though never chart hits, are among the best songs ever written.
None of the hits are omitted, so you will hear If You Could Read My Mind, Sundown, Carefree Highway and Wreck Of The Edmund Fitzgerald, among others. The other songs come from throughout his career, dating back to the early/mid 60s with Early Mornin' Rain and For Lovin' Me, to the title song from his latest original album, A Painter Passing Through.
Lightfoot is backed up by his band all of whom has been with him for at least 20 years, and the first two for 30 or more. They are: Terry Clements (lead guitar), Rick Haynes (bass), Barry Keane (drums and percussion) and Mike Heffernan (keyboards), and they are among the finest musicians around. The fact that they have recorded and toured with Lightfoot for so many years says volumes about them and about Lightfoot.
The full set list is: Don Quixote, I'll Prove My Love, House You Live In, Sundown, Carefree Highway, Restless, Blackberry Wine, For Lovin' Me/Did She Mention My Name (Medley), Wreck Of The Edmund Fitzgerald, Waiting For You, Fading Away, Rainy Day People, Shadows, If You Could Read My Mind, A Painter Passing Through, Make Way For The Lady, Early Mornin' Rain, Baby Step Back, Song For A Winter's Night, Canadian Railroad Trilogy, Old Dan's Records, Cold On The Shoulder.
Amazing list of songs, isn't it?
(Note: I have not seen this North American release of the concert, but I have seen the UK DVD as well as the original videotape from the production company).

1661668,5,B00005TNFN,"I bought this DVD first about a year and one half ago. I liked it a lot because I am a Gordon Lightfoot fan, and because it spans several years of live performances.
So when it came time to help celebrate my father - inlaws birthday - I did not hesitate to get a copy for him as well.
We ( with the rest of my wives family)saw him live years ago at the Historic State Theatre in downtown Mpls Mn. Wow what
show. He watches frequently with great enjoyment . Everyone ages Gordon ages, so .... because it spans many years ... the sound of his voice also changes. So for anyone who is in the same boat ? Do not hesitate to treat yourself to a copy as well.",1427414400,,653,3.9923664122137406

Simple but strong back up band adds the 'presence' and support necessary to enjoy the motif created by Gordon Lightfoot - still one of North America's true treasures, this troubador will be sorely missed when his performing days are done.

1661696,5,B00005TNFN,"This is an excellent addition for Gordon Lightfoot fans everywhere.  It's one of the concerts you want to be at, listening and seeing him on stage during the time when he was still at his best - great singing voice, great stage presence and wonderful band.  As a Lightfoot fan for over 40 years, I have gifted this to others and some have noted he didn't look healthy.  Yes, his look changed from those early years in the 1960's and 1970's when many people started to enjoy his music...it is now 2014 and he is still as talented as ever on stage with a wonderful band. But, take me back to a time also when his voice was a wee bit stronger .... yes, an excellent and worthwhile addition to your collections.",1398038400,5,707,4.340909090909091
1661697,5,B00005TNFN,"I almost passed on purchasing this dvd.  My wife and I went to a Gordon Lightfoot concert around the time this show was recorded and we were disappointed.  We'd seen him about ten times over the years and loved his work.  The last time we saw him he pretty much recited the words as if reading poetry to the accompaniment of his small band.  I bought this dvd based on the reviews and I'm glad I did. Mr. Lightfoot's voice is as we remember it from the 80s.  Great range and smooth as silk on all his songs.  This is the work of a master craftsman in his prime, not of a man trying to hang on to the past.",1397606400,,605,4.0

1661701,5,B00005TNFN,I had forgotten all about Gordon in my old age. I saw PBS was going to show this concert because he's coming to our state. I thought he looked good. C'mon people- he's 75. I'm 56. We aren't spring chickens anymore. Society worships youth. He still sings beautifully. And seeing him is like seeing an old friend. Wonderful priceless memories of my younger years come flooding forth. Beautiful music by a beautiful man! You won't be sorry if you buy this!,1378512000,2,453,4.604938271604938
1661702,5,B00005TNFN,"I have been a fan of Gord since 1968...I have never bought a concert DVD in my life.  But I thought before we both were dead I'd give it a try.  What an amazing experience!  Crystal clear picture, great sound, ...you feel like you are there!  This is just fabulous.  I've already watched it 3 times, I took my wife away from her hallmark channel to watch it, and she loved it too. I'm about to watch it again!  Gord may not have the voice he had 30 years ago, but no one else does either!...and he's still the best song writer short of Bob Dylan who ever lived.  Do yourself a favor and buy this NOW1!!!",1378166400,5,603,4.102564102564102
1661703,5,B00005TNFN,Been trying to see gordon lightfoot live in concert for years but always just miss out on tickets. This is a great dvd. Some reviewers talk about him being frail but I didn't notice that. Just enjoy the music and don't be critical. we all get old.,1369958400,,247,4.276595744680851

1661705,4,B00005TNFN,"I saw Gordon in concert more than 40 years ago, so this DVD is a great way to see Gordon perform his songs before an intimate audience.  Would have liked, perhaps, bonus material of interview with Gordon describing how each song came about, but otherwise the concert was well recorded.  Gordon's music will always be very special to listen to.",1364428800,,343,4.7

1661707,5,B00005TNFN,"I have been a Gordon lightfoot fan since the early 70's, This DVD shows how good he is and he plays all the songs old and new. I saw him a couple of years ago. He really put on a great show. If you are a Gordon Lightfoot fan, this is the DVD to have!",1363651200,,250,3.5636363636363635

1661709,3,B00005TNFN,"If you want to see and hear Gordon in his prime, Amazon UK is selling a DVD titled ""Talking In Your Sleep"" which was recorded by the BBC in 1972. I love Gordon Lightfoot but he was past his peak when the Live in Reno DVD was recorded, hence I can only give it 3 stars. The BBC 1972 concert is 100% better and is described as ""All regions"" so it should play on US equipment.",1341446400,,373,3.9210526315789473
1661710,5,B00005TNFN,"This concert was so enjoyable, what a talent. One reviewer commented that they thought his voice was weak, well Gordon Lightfoot never was a screamer. His talent is writing and telling stories. Now, on one song on this DVD I couldn't make out many of the words, but this is because the music was too loud. This is the fault of the audio people, not the singer. Just like on some movies today, the background music or affects, are so loud one can't make out the dialog. On albums, they're usually done in a studio and the audio people mix it so it is perfect. Not only that, an artist doesn't have to sing a lifetime of hits at one time on a studio recording. If you are a fan of Gordon Lightfoot, you will love this one as the quality is quite good.",1339977600,2,749,4.208333333333333
1661711,5,B00005TNFN,I've been a fan of Gords for 40 years so perhaps my 5 stars is a little biased. Gords voice is not as strong as it used to be( by my reckoning he was nearing 70 years old on this video)but he still sounds great. Many of the songs performed are folk classics & all are written by himself. He is a master songwriter & a folk legend. Very pleased to see live versions of songs like Wreck Of The E. Fitzgerald & Canadian Railroad Trilogy as well as many other classics. All in all a very pleasant way to spend 1.5 hours.,1333152000,2,516,4.019417475728155
1661712,5,B00005TNFN,Very nice performance from Canadian Gordon Lightfoot from Reno i bought this one and also the Greatest Hits Live one but this one is far better quality than the other one...i recommend this one for your collection.,1330300800,2,214,4.8108108108108105
1661713,5,B00005TNFN,"I have been a Gordon Lightfoot fan for the last 20 years,those days i used to hear Lightfoot on cassettes,then came the CD's and now the DVD experience of this album was brilliant. Right from the time Gordon enters the stage,gives a smile at the audience and then listening to his performance was something you would love to cherish. All the songs sung are well chosen and specially the ballad ""I will prove my love to you"" was superb. Whenever I have time,I keep on playing this DVD and enjoy the scintillating experience. Truly rewarding.",1283212800,,540,4.6947368421052635
1661714,5,B00005TNFN,"I have always been fond of Gordon Lightfoot's early recordings. I purchased this DVD after viewing it on the local public broadcasting station that had aired it as a fundraiser support program. After viewing the local broadcast, I also subsequently purchased tickets to attend his local live performace in October. I enjoy his folk and ballad style and his voice still does come across well for audience entertainment! This is a GREAT purchase and I look forward to his upcoming concert.",1281657600,,487,5.0246913580246915

1661717,1,B00005TNFN,"Gorden Lightfoot is fantastic -- my whole family enjoys his songs and we have seen him in concert. This DVD, however, does a poor job. The picture quality is VHS quality and sound is so-so.",1256083200,4,189,4.428571428571429
1661718,5,B00005TNFN,"I watched it on a PBS station, twice, but not in its entirety, so it stands to reason to purchase this DVD of one of my favorite performers.
 I may be able to see Gordon live, later this month!",1254441600,,193,3.948717948717949
1661719,5,B00005TNFN,"This is a mature Gordon Lightfoot & his band performing at their very, very best. This is one ""super"", outstanding concert. THIS IS A CLASSIC!!!!! This is one of those ""greatest concerts of all time"", and a ""must-have"" for any rock fan period. Gordon Lightfoot is the ""KING"" of ""Great Lakes Folk Rock"", and he is a North American Music Legend. I've been a fan for years. This concert consists of 22 songs, all written by Gordon, himself. It has an approximate running time of 87 minutes. This concert was filmed ""live"" at the Pioneer Center for the Performing Arts in Reno, Nevada. I'm not sure of the date, but it is copyrighted 2000.

NOTE: ALL THE SONGS SOUND JUST LIKE THE ORIGINAL STUDIO VERSIONS, EVEN THOUGH, THIS IS A LIVE CONCERT. (I don't like concerts where the live versions, don't sound anything like the original, studio version, except for jam bands who improvise their music.) Anyway, the songs you get here, are going to sound just like the ones you heard on the radio, through the years, and I like that for a concert like this.

The line-up consists of the following:

Rick Haynes - Bass
Barry Keane - Drums & Percussion
Terry Clements - Lead Guitar (Electric)
Mike Heffernan - Keyboards
Gordon Lightfoot - Guitar & Vocals

The song set is as follows:
1. Don Quixote
2. I'll Prove My Love
3. The House You Live In
4. Sundown
5. Carefree Highway
6. Restless
7. Blackbery Wine
8. Medley - For Lovin' Me/Did She Mention My Name
9. The Wreak of the Edmund Fitzgerald (Simply ""Awesome""!)
10. Waiting for You
11. Fading Away
12. Rainy Day People
13. Shadows
14. If You Could Read My Mine
15. A Painter Passing Through
16. Make Way For the Lady
17. Early Morning Rain
18. Baby Step Back
19. Song for a Winter's Night
20. Canadian Railroad Trilogy
21. Old Dan's Records
22. Cold On the Shoulder

Overall, this is one of the best concerts of all time. This is one that will go down in history as a classic. Just read the other reviews. Yes, I definitely recommend this one. Thanks!!!!",1253404800,6,1994,4.512465373961219

1661721,5,B00005TNFN,This live concert is pure pleasure.  Both audio and visual are excellent quality.  I recommend buying this DVD and the Gordon Lightfoot Songbook 4-CD set.  You will be in for hours of delight.  Thank you Gordon Lightfoot.,1249171200,,221,4.891891891891892

1661724,5,B00005TNFN,"Since the early 7ties Gordon has been on my 'Most Wanted Ones To Watch Live"" list. Living in Belgium didn't make that one easy :-) I'm quite sure he never came over here. In the Sundow days most artist didn't. Now the ""Rock Werchter"" 3 day rockfest is voted as ""World's Best"". Things change, that's for sure. So did Gordon. ""Ooh doesn't he look old"" was my first reaction watching this Reno concert. A look in the mirror kept the shock away, so I watched G. and the band play. This DVD is more than I thought it would be. I've seen a great writer and performer, handling his great songs with the love and respect they deserve! Always Good, sometimes Fantastic!

1661727,5,B00005TNFN,"Gordon Lightfoot Live in reno is simply delightful. It captures the essence of this great singing poet and is a true joy to watch. A blend of many of his songs from his long career, this DVD is quite typical of his live performance. A great view and listen for the Lightfoot fan to savor.",1215907200,,288,4.254545454545455
1661728,5,B00005TNFN,"I just received my DVD in the mail today, unwrapped it, and stopped everything I was doing and watched it all the way through.  A great showcase for such a wonderful catalog of music chronicling his journey all the way back to the early days.  While overall quality of sound and lighting lacks a bit compared to comparable music DVD's, you can't beat Gordon Lightfoot's musically tight delivery of the songs we've come to know and love.  At the age of 61 he's past his vocal prime and his voice sounds better on some songs than others.  There are instances where in some passages he really nails it and the song sounds like it did when first recorded.  You can't help but smile.  Yet, his guitar playing remains pristine.  In all, there's no mistaking he's still the legendary Gordon Lightfoot.  What's more, Gordon's music doesn't need a lot of fancy concert wizardry to come alive.  A singer/songwriter/guitarist, a lead guitarist, a keyboardist, a bassist, and a drummer.  Pure.  Simple.  Magical.  Still.

He doesn't talk with the crowd much, but when he does you almost get the feeling he might just be ready to head down the path and tell you a story.  Like when he tells the audience about writing the song about ""the snow in the winter and all the romance thereof, and that it was actually written during a thunderstorm in Cleveland.""  You get the sense there's more to it...and he might go on...but then he launches right into the song which in and of itself tells the story.  He almost seems a little shy.  He does flash a huge smile throughout the show, and his eyes still sparkle, just like they did so many years ago.  He seems genuinely appreciative of the audience's applause.  And humble.

It's really too bad we don't have more ""live"" DVD's of Gordon's earlier performances.  He's a true legend, a class act.  It's nice to see him still performing after decades in the business.",1214438400,4,1895,4.641566265060241

The first time I ever heard him sing I was driving down the interstate at 70 mph when I heard the most beautiful voice I had ever heard coming over the radio, singing ""If You Could Read My Mind."" I literally had to pull off the highway so I could hear the rest of the song without distractions and could savor the moment. I went right down to the record store the next day and bought the album. This was about forty years ago, and Gordon Lightfoot has been my favorite singer ever since.",1207440000,2,643,4.235772357723577
1661730,5,B00005TNFN,The Gordon Lightfoot Live in Reno DVD is sensational and worth every cent we paid for it. He is such a great artist and he sang so many of his biggest hits. I just wish he would come to Australia,1207008000,,195,3.9
1661741,4,B00005TNFN,"It's important to remember that this live Reno show from 2000 was taped before  Gordon Lightfoot's near-fatal health scare.  So although he has recovered and is touring again in 2008, his voice today is not what it once was.  If you're a dyed-in-the-wool Gordy fan (that is, you likely hail from Canada or The Upper Great Lakes) perhaps that alone is a good reason to own this DVD.  It is a snapshot of him at his performing best.  Sober, happy and healthy.  It contains a very good selection of his mainstream greatest hits, as well as songs that received less notoriety, yet are still loved by his devoted fans.  Production values are excellent.  This concert was well produced.  If you love the songwriting of Gordy, I suggest this as an addition to the Lightfoot CDs in your long term library.  To truly appreciate him, I recommend lighting a fire in the fireplace, pouring a glass of warm brandy and pressing play on your DVD player on a cold winter night.",1206403200,,961,4.6
1661742,5,B00005TNFN,"I am fortunate to have seen this same concert in Greenville, SC during Gord's tour that same year.  The really impressive thing to me as a musician and folk music lover is that the songs are so close to ""off the record"" performances, even though most of the material was years after the fact.  His band membership has been stable forever and there is real attention to detail in the arrangements.

I recently saw him again, after his serious physical problems of a couple of years back.  While he is still phenomenal, he has lost some ability to project his vocals from this era, and whether this is temporary or not, I don't know.  At any rate, this DVD is Gord in his prime, and what a catalog of songs he has accumulated over his 40 plus year career!  There are so many classic compositions that will stand the test of time.  An artist and musician in the truest sense of the word....if you are a serious student of songwriting and folk music, this is a centerpiece of your collection.",1205798400,3,988,4.455555555555556
1661743,5,B00005TNFN,"I saw Gordon Lightfoot live in 1987 and enjoyed the show, very much.  I was hoping that this video would allow me to re-live some of that enjoyment and was not disappointed.  As noted in other reviews, Mr. Lightfoot could use a few more healthy meals, but he sings well and his guitar playing is impecable.  This is not a flashy Las Vegas stage show, just he and his band on stage, and it seems like he has to remind himself to look into the camera, once in a while, rather than just at the audience.  Overall, the picture is clear and the sound is good.  I like it.",1203206400,,566,4.155963302752293

His more recent albums have been less than successful, but he does perform all the songs that made him famous and a standard on AM radio in its heyday.  His voice no longer is the baritone it once was, but he still gives every once of energy he can.  This is a good compilation of his hits and he and his band do them all justice.

I've seen him in concert and in this performance he does not engage the audience with talk that he once did.  Perhaps this is by design, but it would have been nice to show others what this man can be like in concert.  After 40 years performing, Gordon Lightfoot is not burned out.",1191283200,,680,4.152671755725191
1661746,3,B00005TNFN,"I have some serious complaints about this DVD, and they definitely aren't related to the songs.  Gordon Lightfoot has so many great music releases that I'd recommend getting his complete catalog on CD before moving on to try this DVD.  Many of my objections to the video are based on the crowd and the venue.  There's sort of a tourist-like, supper-club, over-the-hill vibe to the Reno crowd, as if a bunch of vacationing gamblers were trying their best to follow along, but they just couldn't keep the beat if their lives had depended on it.  It's obvious that Gordon Lightfoot doesn't look great here, but the blame for that goes back to the venue, and the producers and the overall decision to use this particular site as the show for the DVD.  The whole place is lit so brightly that nobody looks good.  The setting seems way too commercialized for Gordon's taste.  I've seen Lightfoot look much more at home in more intimate concert surroundings. I was so shocked by the glaring appearance of this DVD that I turned off the TV and turned up the music, and on that level I still enjoyed the performance, but that approach makes the video essentially pointless.  Even with all of my criticism, I still think that this has some value, and it has to do for now, but considering how many great shows he's done in so many better settings, I don't understand why this show was chosen for the DVD release.  In my opinion Gordon Lightfoot is one of the best songwriters of the era, who will be appreciated for as long as people are listening to music, so there should be some great visual document of his concerts.  I hope that someone rescues something from the vaults, and I hope that someone still gets a better video from his current shows.",1169510400,20,1740,4.565916398713826
1661747,5,B00005TNFN,Having purchased this DVD recently it has become a favorite of mine and is outstanding. Like a fine wine that only gets better with time Gordon Lightfoot shines on stage. The audio and picture quality are excellent. Gordon's vocals are in perfect pitch and filled with emotion only he can deliver.

It was even better with my mother sitting next to me, who had raised me on his music. We enjoyed seeing and hearing him.

I attended several GL concerts during the '70's.  Also, I learned and refined my guitar fingerpicking style ala GL from his earlier days.

It's one thing to watch an aging ""Legend"" perform who occasionally can't hit or hold certain notes when singing. It's quite another thing to watch an artist and Legend we love and admired perform at a much reduced state due to illness. Frankly, it was difficult for me to watch this concert.

1661762,3,B00005TNFN,For Gordon Lightfoot fans it is a chance to see him perform live. For those who are familar with his music the show is a presentation of his greatest hits with popular old favourites. The performer and his voice are starting to show their age (as well we all are). The show is a sit back and listen; with the artist providing a presentation which I know I would have enjoyed if I had seen it live.,1122940800,6,397,4.1688311688311686
1661763,5,B00005TNFN,"I'm in complete agreement with Sam Graham's editorial review above. It was Gordon's ""gaunt looks"" and ""frail voice"" that has become so visible in recent years that almost prevented me from watching this DVD. I wanted to remember Lightfoot as he was the first time I saw him in person at the Univ. of Irvine cafeteria in '68. Virtually unknown in California at the time, there was a small but enthusiastic crowd that evening for what was to be his first ever appearance in Orange County and to this day ranks as one of my all-time favorite concert experiences. I was sixteen at the time and since that Irvine concert I have become one of Gordon's staunchest fans with a total of 19 Lightfoot concerts attended and hoping for at least one more before I'm through. You might say Gordon and I have grown old together.

Overcoming my initial fears of watching a fading shadow of what once was, I purchased the DVD and hesitantly watched it one night after my wife and daughter went to bed. I wanted to judge the concert on my own without any input from the family, this was between Gordon and I. Now I can say that I'm happy with my decision. Whatever may have changed through the years, it's still Gordon Lightfoot! Surrounded by some of the same musicians who performed with him long ago in that first concert in '68, I soon forgot about how old and frail he looked and once again became absorbed in the music that has meant so much to me through the years.

Gordon Lightfoot's songs certainly haven't grown old. They still convey all the passion, introspection, regret and wonder of life that they always have. They always will.",1113436800,139,1626,4.565068493150685
1661764,4,B00005TNFN,"I recently came across a CD version of this concert, and being a huge Lightfoot fan, I grabbed it.  While I have not seen the DVD yet, the setup looks much like Lightfoot's shows of recent years, and like one I saw of him in 1987.

The theatre setup allows for a close-up view of Lightfoot and his band, all longtime members (who else but Terry Clements could get that tone on ""The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald?""), and they're tight as ever on this set.

The usual favorites are here, such as ""The Wreck,"" ""Sundown,"" ""For Lovin' Me/Did She Mention My Name"" and ""Carefree Highway,"" the latter of which we learn the origin of (it's a highway in the Phoenix area), and that some of the lyrics were nearly lost!

What I was glad to hear were a number of more recent songs, many of which have been pooh-poohed by critics as not being as strong as his work in the 60's and 70's.  I disagree!

""I'll Prove My Love,"" ""Restless,"" ""Fading Away"" and ""Waiting For You"" all come from the recording of the latter title in '93, and is a fine work on its own.  I also liked hearing ""A Painter Passing Through,"" the title cut of his 1998 CD.

Lightfoot's voice may be a little thinner than in the past, and his recent health problems may not have helped, but this recording shows him and the band in fine form.  It also puts his later work in a proper light, showing it belongs right up there with his older songs.",1109721600,10,1399,4.2889733840304185
1661765,5,B00005TNFN,"I have to say that I was expecting a bit of flash and glam with the DVD, simply because that's what we seem to be used to these days with entertainers. This is a great DVD, because it is simply a gifted singer/songwriter sharing his music, supported by an obviously skilled and talented band. I found, as did others, that Lightfoot ""up close and personal"" was something to get a bit used to, but the music is magical. As I continued to watch the DVD, I was really entranced--the combination and synergy of the voice, the songs, the back-up music, and the enthuasism of the audience.

 Particularly given that in late 2002 he suffered major health problems (to say the least), I'm really grateful that we have this opportunity to have this gifted entertainer recorded on DVD for posterity. I hope he continues to have many more years of success, in writing, singing, and performing.",1090627200,12,881,4.67741935483871
1661766,4,B00005TNFN,"Having never seen any video footage of GL, I jumped at the chance to purchase this DVD, it had been marked down severely and was rattling around in the bargain bin of a small music store in an equally small country town!
Gord at 61 certainly looked all of his years, and from the opening songs I began to think that my bargain purchase was something less.
The voice was kind of breathless and reedy, he didn't seem to be able to hold the notes.
But... he warms to his task after two or three songs, and as Sonny Mayo correctly said in his review, he gets a spring in his step, you can watch the years drop away and that wonderful voice return in all it's glory as he recreates each masterpiece and newcomer alike.
You don't have to be a visual showman when you're Gordon Lightfoot, the magic of his words and music are reward enough.
Thoroughly recommended.",1087689600,10,857,4.3625

concert for the first time today, and was extremely
pleased with it.  Based on some of the previous reviews
I had read here on Amazon, I thought I might be
disappointed in this DVD.  On the contrary, I thought
it was wonderful, and am grateful to have it in my
Lightfoot collection.  Granted, Mr. Lightfoot looks
older and thinner in this film, but I think the lack of
beard and mustache may cause him to
appear that way.  I found both the choice of material,
and the quality of this performance, to be excellent.
When I close my eyes and listen to this DVD, I still
hear the voice I remember from the dozen or more
times I have seen Mr. Lightfoot in person.  Since
this is the only filmed concert of his that I have
ever had access to, I treasure it all the more.
I believe other Gordon Lightfoot fans will have
a similar response.  I highly recommend it.",1051920000,9,901,4.3017751479289945

1661769,5,B00005TNFN,"I've been a fan since 1965 when I first saw Lightfoot in person. I was delighted to see this concert come out on DVD--the quality is excellent, and the music is first-rate.  True, Gord's voice is not everything that it was 20 years ago, but the heart is there, the songs are there, and the band is tight!
Lightfoot's musical presentation has matured over the years and the raw power of his early years has been replaced by subtlety and finesse.  The arrangements are very good--they make excellent use of the particular talents of the band members (all of whom have been with Lightfoot for over 20 years) and the instruments they play.
If you like GL's music, you'll want to own this DVD.",1045526400,11,688,4.540322580645161

1661771,4,B00005TNFN,"I've seen Gordon Lightfoot in concert, on average, once a year since 1972.  I've also met him several times and even received a bit of advice from Lightfoot regarding my own career.  I bought this DVD for posterity--out of ""respect for a legend.""  The set is a stellar collection and example of the artist's best songwriting. True, Lightfoot doesn't have the voice he had 30 years ago, but he's still far more expressive than many of his peers. Lightfoot and his band still play with precision and clarity such that few bands would only hope to aspire to during a live concert.  Meanwhile, their performance of ""Old Dan's Records"" is rousing, ""Make Way for the Lady"" bluesy and inspired, ""Early Morning Rain"" and ""The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald"" completely authentic. Some of Lightfoot's newer songs, like ""I'll Prove My Love,"" ""Waiting for You,"" and ""A Painter Passing Through,"" sound almost exactly like the studio recordings.  Some reviewers have commented on how Lightfoot looks ""frail"" and ""gaunt."" Well, when he enters this Reno stage to start the show and, later, returns for his encore, Lightfoot has a noticeable spring in his step and appears totally youthful! With complete confidence, he and the band ""nail"" ""Cold On the Shoulder"" to end this DVD collection--something all fans should have for ""posterity.""",1040947200,42,1322,5.018264840182648
1661772,5,B00005TNFN,"Having been transplanted to the U. of Minn. in the mid-'70's, Lightfoot was a god. I still remember the Duluth crowd going crazy upon hearing that The Fitz' was lost, and the first time I air-played ""If You Could Read My Mind"" a few years earlier.
Although I'd actually like more chat between songs, the video is typical of what Gordon does in concert: ""....this is who I am, this is what I do, here it comes.""
In the early '80's, PBS hosted a show called ""Live On Soundstage"" featuring a TV and FM simulcast. One installment featured Lightfoot in the ""Dreamstreet Rose"" period. I still have a copy of the audio. Would make a great video.  We need more from Lightfoot.  This would be a good one to resurrect.",1035504000,4,708,4.438461538461539

I have been a fan of Lightfoot since the '70s, and was thrilled to find this item.  I was a bit saddened to see how frail Gordon looked at the beginning of the concert.. however THAT disappeared once he and his crack band of ace musicians began rolling!  His vocals were a tad weak at the start, but soon he found his groove, and he, the band, and the audience were GROOVIN'! The sound quality is superb, and his backup band play as if they are reading the man's mind (after being with him for 20+ years, it's possible!) I was delighted with the song selection, and found a few great tunes I wasn't familiar with - ""Blackberry Wine"" and ""Baby Step Back"" are particularly catchy, and are now among my favorites.
  I just want to say this is an excellent concert DVD, and for anyone who loves music, and seeing a musical genius IN HIS ELEMENT I heartily recommend this item - It's a gem!",1031097600,7,1000,4.26984126984127

1661775,5,B00005TNFN,"What distinguishes Gordon Lightfoot from every other singer songwriter who came to fame from the sixties is that he has stayed the course. His music reflects the observatuions of a Don Quixote who has charged at windmills and suffered pain and loss, found solace at the helm of his sailboat along the Canadian lakes or in the call of a ring neck loon. His are the shadows of a lover at the door of his beloved, the remembrances of a man whose lover leaves in the early morning hours. He has chronicled the wreck of ships and loss of lives, the loneliness of the hitchhiker who has fallen through the cracks of society, or the families of those in prison. The human factor has ever and always been the domain of Gordon Lightfoot, and in that regard he is very much a Graham Greene as Troubador, in as classical a sense of the word as possible. He has written the real Canadian National anthem and has pleaded with the cultural forces within Canada to stay together. His voice carries the mist of the maritimes, the grandeur of the Rockies, the solitude of the great Ontario wilderness. If you want to know what Canada is, you need only listen to Gordon Lightfoot. He is the crucible of all post war Canadian music. It is as inconceivable to imagine where Canadian writers might have gone without him as it is to imagine where American writers might have gone without Woody Guthrie or Charlie Patton.
So, on this DVD, Gordon presents his music as he always has: it is ever and always about the songs, and the songs are ever and always about real people. No special effects, no Spinal Tap set pieces, just a band of men who know what they are talking about, presenting their take and their observations on the road thus far, and what the journey of life has revealed to them. His and his colleagues musicianship is as first rate as it has always been. They present a textbook case of what can happen when musicians listen to each other. This tightly locked groove would find itself the calling card of every great Canadian band from The Band through Bare Naked Ladies, and this is the guy who started it all. Gordon's voice is not as strong as it once was, but there is no lack of conviction in his delivery. What you get from this DVD is a vision of the genuine article. The history of modern Canada is on Gordon's face, his voice calls out with the passion and conviction of someone who knows his heritage and dares to dream of its future. In the small theatre of the heart and the soul, Gordon details the travails, the slings and arrows, the sanctuaries and solace of a life in touch with the world in which he lives. This is Farley Mowat and Robertson Davies in verse and music, and in performance it is all about the subtleties. He is often self-deprecating, has battled his share of demons and has wished for all he's worth to have had things turn out better. He has composed lullabies for children and homages to old family musicians. He is at one with the natural world and in battle with those forces that would rob us of our human dignity. He is that ghost in the wishing well, Alberta bound, standing in a knightly pose along the shore, shouting. It is a blessing to hear and see him.
We tend to seek out our national treasures after they've passed or once their powers have diminished. This DVD presents one of the great treasures of Canada delivering his music as he always has, with everything he's got. Through the woodlands, through the valleys, comes a horseman, wild and free.... indeed.",1025568000,25,3503,4.492163009404389

But when I saw this, I knew I had to get it.  I grew up on Gordon Lightfoot's music (and my Dad playing many of GL's tunes on his guitar), and knew this would be a gift Dad would remember for a long time.  Speaking of a long time...he's been playing this DVD for a very long time or so it seems.  Okay, Dad, we've heard the DVD about once a day since March 25th of this year already!

For those of us who have seen him in concert throughout his career, this is an excellent example of Lightfoot now, and it feels like a Lightfoot concert (yes, there are rude people in the audience who insist on yelling ""Rock and Roll"", even in Massey Hall.)  Lightfoot's voice is different than it once was, not better or worse but different.  Perhaps one of the very best things about this is the musicans who are a part of Lightfoot's show.  They back him up without being obtrusive, functioning like a well oiled machine.
Probably hard core Lightfoot fans will appreciate this more than people who remember him only for ""Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald"", but it is a pleasure to see Lightfoot perform.",1016668800,13,729,4.671875

The Live in Reno DVD/VHS is a long overdue video representation of what you would expect to hear and see at one of his shows.  It would have been nice to have had one of these every 5 years over the course of his incredible career; but this is most likely our one and only chance.  As any true Lightfoot fan will attest - there are no smoke and mirrors here, no lights in motion to augment a mediocre talent - just Lightfoot and his awesome band doing what they do best and consistantly year after year.  This DVD is not for everybody; especially for the guy in the sixth row that insists on yelling ""rock and roll"" at the top of his lungs at the quietest moment of the evening - just to share his rude ignorance with the rest of the crowd. While viewing this concert keep this in mind:  you will be seeing a true member of international music history who has outlasted thousands of bands and acts over a course of 35 years!",1015977600,19,1102,4.304347826086956
1661779,1,B00005TNFN,Let Me Start By Saying I Love Gordon Lightfoot but this Dvd is awful. I can hardly hear his voice over the instruments. I am not watching it on DTS but I would expect to be able to hear his voice. It sounds as though they didn't turn his microphone on. I recommend you save your money or purchase Cd's of his music.,1015718400,9,315,4.015873015873016
1661780,5,B00005TNFN,"I've been listening to Gordon Lightfoot's music for over 30 years now.  I have all of his music and found that every one had something special to offer.  Each one of his songs is an experience in another place or time.  When you're listening to ""Canadian Railroad Trilogy"", you can picture the images in your mind of the men hitting the spikes: ""The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald"", you can almost feel the wind: Or the classic, ""If You Could Read My Mind"", the hurt in the man's heart when Lightfoot metaphorically sings, ...""you know that ghost is me...and I will never be set free as long as I'm a ghost and you can't see"". What Steven Spielberg does for movies, Gordon Lightfoot does to music.  It's true that after 30 years, his voice has changed.  But that doesn't matter.  That's like saying as one grows older and their looks fade, that our love for a person fades as well. Everyone knows grandparents have the most to offer and so does Lightfoot's music. So many artists have just done a record or two and then fade into oblivion. To see Gordon Lightfoot perform on this DVD to a full house brought tears to my eyes.  Because he hasn't been in the mainstream for so long, you wonder how many people love his music and this concert proves that a great performer can still pack them in. The song ""Restless"" sent a chill through me as his group performed that one.  It was better than the CD version.  Also the audience was professional.  Not a yell, cough or premature clap before his songs were finished, proving that they knew his music well to sit and hear every note. I am a station manager of a country radio station and I play his music on the air every day.  I put Gordon Lightfoot on the play list daily right between artists like Garth Brooks, Ray Price or Shania Twain.  It's too bad many other radio stations have left out some great artists...I don't! We still get requests for Gordon Lightfoot almost every day.  All I can say is.. ""Thank you Mr. Lightfoot for over 30 years of great music including this concert""...",1015632000,35,2036,4.47027027027027
7953686,3,B00005TNFN,"I was disappointed in this.  I was one of those people who thought he looked terrible in this.  He is still around so maybe that was just his look.  The songs are great  The Wreck Of The Edmund Fitzgerald which is my all time favorite song.  If You Could Read My Mind, and of course Sundown.  Which is my all time favorite album.  He does some of his early songs like Early Morning Rain.  And Canadian Railroad Trilogy which has gotten over shadowed some by Edmund Fitzgerald  And other great songs. Like Don Quixote, Old Dan's Records and Blackberry Wine.  His band is good.  Although it seems a little boring.  All they do is play their instruments.  They don't do any harmony or back up singing.  None of them even have microphones.  Lightfoot did a Sound stage that is better then this.  And is available on dvd.  If you can find it.",1503619200,,837,4.401315789473684
7953687,4,B00005TNFN,"What's all this reference to Gordon's ""gaunt, frail"" appearance? A better description might be ""lean and fit."" So many of our musicians from the 70's have porked-on an extra 80 pounds, I think we've come to expect a certain ""well-fed"" look. Gordon has managed to keep his youthful weight, while adding well-earned ""character"" to his face. This is not the sweet face that gazed from your 1970's album cover. Good for him!
Regarding sound quality, the channel that was recording Gordon's voice was apparently being over-driven (audiophiles will understand), so on a premium sound system you might ocassionally detect a bit of a buzzy quality to Gordon's voice. It wasn't distracting to me, but my hyper-discriminating husband mentioned it.
Don't let any of that deter you from enjoying this great concert.",1478390400,3,803,5.137404580152672

I do wished he would've played some of his up-tempo songs tho. All in all,I enjoyed this concert.",1466208000,,256,4.354166666666667

I will stick with his old CDs.  I saw him in concert decades ago, and even his stage presence has diminished since then.",1461369600,,279,4.612244897959184
