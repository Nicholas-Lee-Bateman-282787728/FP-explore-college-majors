7811776,5,630136550X,This is one of the greatest fights of all times.  It is exciting from beginning to end.  They both were definitely two champions!!!!,1254182400,,132,4.695652173913044
7811777,3,630136550X,"This tape features both fights between Sugar Ray Leonard and Thomas Hearns, two of the greatest welterweights of all time. The fights are complete and, the first fight is arguably one of the 10 greatest fights in boxing history. Unfortunately, I was somewhat disappointed with this tape. I was hoping to hear a lot of post fight and pre fight commentary from experts. I also was expecting to hear comments from the fighters themselves. This tape has none of that. Even the standard post fight interviews with the fighters were not shown, and the blow by blow commentary is not done by the original analysts. The fights themselves are great enough that the tape is worth having if you are a boxing fan, but don't expect to get much in terms of interviews, analysis and background.",1212969600,,779,4.735294117647059
7811778,5,630136550X,"Everyone who reads this review should purchase this
amazing video. Never again will you see such a boxing
bout in history again. On a scale of 1-100 i would give
this a 100. Reason is quite simple actually.
In this epic and historical even you will see the sweet
science of boxing and the might of two great boxers
collide in an action packed 14 rounds of boxing in the
first bout which was truly amazing. Also live the controversy
of the second bout between the two. The picture quality of
bouts are crystal clear and they show both bouts of
Leonard Vs Hearns. Both fights are complete but the first
is missing interviews, never the less beautiful.
Purchase this item without thinking about it because i, as
a fight fan didn't have to think and enjoyed it.
I hope they release the bouts Hagler Vs Hearns and also
Hearns Vs Duran in the Near Future and then the leonard-Duran
complete fights ( all three) i think that this would not only
make alot of money for the producers and manufacturers, but
it would also make alot of fight fans out there real happy.
cheers amazon.com, without service like this, i would have to purchase
and trade crappy footage with others.",1075075200,3,1166,4.530805687203792
7811779,5,630136550X,"Sugar Ray Leonard and Thomas Hearns were two of the most exciting fighters of the 1980s. And they gave us two great fights. Watch their first epic battle in 1981, as Leonard overcomes a swollen eye and a deficit on the judges cards to TKO Hearns in the 14th round. Watch Thomas Hearns get robbed of a victory in their exciting toe to toe slugfest eight years later, ruled as a draw.",1034380800,2,382,4.319444444444445

7811781,4,630136550X,"Two good fights, but there had been many fights that are better than those two. Leonard didn't show any exciting boxing except few series of attacks that were enough two hurt Hearns so badly in first fight that he couldn't  continue and in second he somehow escaped with the end of the fight. Hearns  didn't know how to finish Leonard in second fight when he nocked him down  twice.",953683200,,382,4.507246376811594
