3174870,3,B0017PEOWM,"I have owned the Rowing Machine Companion in VHS for many years.  When DVD came in. I did my best to find it in DVD, but to no avail!  A friend  copied the tape for me, when my VHS machine pooped out. I know I shouldn't admit this but I was frustrated that the author did not make it available in DVD at that time.  About the first of February 2010, I was just playing around on Amazon and by golly I found it in DVD. I ordered it immediately, but I am partically disappointed with quality. This DVD has the added benefit of a table of contents. I can just ""click"" to the row I want!  My ""Micky-mouse"" copy was unable to click from one row to another, and the copy is distracting for its flaws.
  I would like to comment on another review I saw here: The reviewer did not like this DVD very much. I understand his feelings but I have come to ""love"" this production. As with any repetitive exercise it can get boring. But it is very important to keep the correct posture and cadence in rowing.  I found that if I sloff off like many of us would do momentarily,  watching the back of the rower on screen, helps remind me to stay with the motion of rowing and watch my posture.  If I try very hard to keep up with the rowers back movement, I find I am benefiting much more. I also like the on screen count-down timer. Without the timer I am prone to stop before my 24 minutes are up. At 68, I find it helps me walk 40 minutes at least once a day. And walking motivates me to do my rowing. And visa-versa! I know rowing is not the ""in"" thing these days, but I found it very 'healthful"". And easier than an ellipitical.

Additional note: I revised my opinion of this product and dropped it two stars, as this seems to be a copy of the VHS version and is very light (appearing overexposed). But never the less if it helps you keep your mind on rowing, with the correct posture, then I think it does it's job. We must remember ""rowing"" as out of favor for the masses to exercise with. Mine is an excellant machine for the home. but alas the company is out of business now due to lack of interest on the public's part.",1266451200,14,2110,4.109489051094891
3174871,2,B0017PEOWM,This is a good wookout DVD but I received a defective DVD. It goes through about half of the workout and then keeps on freezing the screen. Very exasperating!,1253059200,3,158,4.482758620689655
3174872,5,B0017PEOWM,"We've been using The Rower's Companion for 20 years (on VHS); so glad to find it on DVD so we can continue using it.  When we're not on the water, we're using the indoor rower (ERG), which is extremely boring -- without this ""companion.""  Focusing solely on following the rower in front of us and the commands of the cox'n, it's the next best thing to being on the water.  HIGHLY recommended for anyone with a rowing machine, especially an ERG!",1394755200,,444,4.45679012345679
3174873,5,B0017PEOWM,this was a present for my husband...he seems to enjoy using this dvd to break up his rowing routines .  hopefully more will come available.,1393459200,,139,4.56
3174874,2,B0017PEOWM,"If your a regular rower and like to sit on a boat looking at someone's back rowing it is fine.

I was hoping for more of a scenic video of a camera looking over the water on a boat moved by someone rowing.  This is not what you get.  It's 2014 almost.  There should be a better video out there.  Even someone attaching a GoPro3 camera to the front of the boat would have been more interesting",1388102400,4,392,4.038961038961039
3174875,5,B0017PEOWM,"I recommend this DVD and will be the first to buy when they update it! It has an 'aged' look about it, but it still accomplishes my goal. In fact, it was so much fun that I can't wait to go back in and go through it again today.

There is an Introduction, a 6-minute Warm-Up, a Beginning Row, Intermediate Row, and Advanced Row. It all ends up being about an hour of rowing. The fact that I did that as a brand new rower is amazing. I was enjoying the feel of being out on the water with the other rowers so much that it distracted me as the time went by.

I just got  a new Concept2 Indoor Rowing Machine. I've watched the online instructional videos. I have an excellent book on rowing. What I didn't have was the feel of actually being out there on the water.

The technical quality of the DVD is not excellent. The photography itself is excellent, but it has the look of older technology. For some reason the introduction and warmup sections seemed old-fashioned, although perfectly fine instructional value.

At first, the audio was practically nonexistent. I could hear the water, which was very nice. Actually that was a major reason why I wanted an on-the-water DVD to train with. Occasionally I could make out a few words. I'm guessing that the rowers were able to understand more because they knew what to listen for.

After the 3rd time through, I realized I was hearing and understanding the commands. I'm amazed at the difference. The DVD didn't change, of course, but my ability to understand what as going on did, dramatically.

Once I got into the rowing, I didn't mind that the picture wasn't crisp and clear. I could see the view around us. The view of the water was authentic and made me feel as if I were rowing on the water. I was able to mimic the rowers in front of me. I'm not advanced enough to do more than basic rowing anyway. After 3-4 sessions, I felt I was getting a much more complete rowing experience.

The DVD did what I needed it to do. It gave me the experience of rowing on the water, with the sound of water as we row. As I said earlier, I recommend this DVD and will be the first to buy when they update it!",1387670400,5,2146,4.3076923076923075
3174876,5,B0017PEOWM,"I searched and searched for something like this to watch while rowing. Not only does it provide the scenery, it allows one to feel as if they are on-board an actual crew, rowing down the river. Plus, it provides inspiration to keep up and teaches one proper form and technique.

Sure if you actually have a river or lake nearby and a rowing scull and are advanced in sculling and/or rowing, this is probably not for you, but for those in want of water and a scull and learning or wanting scenery and technique, it is perfect.

I just wish the workouts were longer as I row sessions of the minimum of an hour a day.",1375920000,9,614,4.2844827586206895
3174877,1,B0017PEOWM,If you make it through this program it shows you're not a quitter mentally. It's so boring and lacking in features that you'll need to be tough mentally not to fall asleep over your oars. Physically if this is a challenge to you I suggest you consult a doctor. If you really want something like this get someone you know who belongs to a rowing club to duct tape a video cam to their ball cap and ask them to sit in the bow seat of an eight. Anything they say or do has got to be better than this.,1358380800,3,497,3.98

3174880,1,B0017PEOWM,"This is a good idea, but there's no setup for the work out, just an awkward cut to the next sequence.  What kind of workout is this? How long will we be rowing?  Who knows?  But, hey, isn't the scenery nice?",1312416000,2,207,4.0

3174884,5,B0017PEOWM,I have been using the first edition of the rowing companion DVDs for a couple of years. It has helped me to lose weight and get stronger with more endurance through regular rowing than any other means I have every tried.  Everyone need to continally challenge themselves to the best health lifestyle possible for their age. I am 61 years old and my wife a couple years younger. Recently  someone entered her in a race in the 40-50 year old category. We both smiled at this person's observations.  She uses the first Rowing Companion about four times a week. We both are looking forward to the New Edition of the Rowing Companion which has two rowing workouts that are more challenging than the workouts from the first DVD. Total workout time for this new edition is 1 hour.,1300060800,10,773,4.586956521739131
3174885,4,B0017PEOWM,When you can't get out on the water this is the next best thing!  I just wish I had the sliders for my erg when I use this!,1295136000,,123,3.392857142857143
3174886,4,B0017PEOWM,"This is a water-level view of sculling which gives a pretty realistic feel of rowing along a waterway.  There are several workouts in varying degrees of difficulty. The viewpoint for all workouts is of a male rower's back as he rows in front of you, and you have to match his pace. Not bad.  I think it would be better if the male rower were gone and all I see is the beautiful waterway, but as it is, it's pretty good.",1294185600,,419,4.160493827160494
3174887,3,B0017PEOWM,"Overall, I'm glad I got this DVD because it is beneficial with regard to keeping good form by simply watching the rower in front of you.  It also has workouts that have you rowing with different strength and emphasis at certain times for more of an interval workout rather than just hopping on and rowing at some steady speed.  My workout on it does seem to go a bit quicker and I'm watching the clock less despite there being a countdown clock in the corner as it plays.  It was clearly shot many years ago as evidenced by the minimally acceptable at best picture quality, even on my 1080p upscaling DVD player.  The sound quality is poor so when it's time to do a ""power 10"" you can barely hear him say that.  It would be nice to get some short scenery shots in there now and then too rather than focus on the back of the rower every single moment.  Again, that's very beneficial for the workout, but I don't think a few 10-15 second shots to the side for some scenery would impact the quality of the workout video and would make it more realistic.

I like that it has a beginner, intermediate and advanced workout, but I wish it had more of a variety of each on there.  Back when it was originally done perhaps there wasn't room for multiple workout tracks, but in this day and age you can jam oodles of things on a DVD.  I think that if a new one was shot now with several more workouts for each level, with HD picture quality and better sound that it could be fabulous and I'd certainly invest in it.",1288483200,5,1505,4.252631578947368

This DVD is just the old VHS tape captured video in a DVD format, which is okay but it could be so much more. I now have a huge 1080p TV and a BlueRay player, and I guess I'm a little spoiled by that. Still, the potential for profit will eventually have someone make high definition rowing video and I just don't want to wait. Maybe I should make one......

8266847,2,B0017PEOWM,"Although you can tell the video is old, the content started out very good. Workout 1 is an excellent overview of the basics of rowing. Workout 2 was also good. The rowing scenes are great and it is easy to follow. BUT, halfway through Workout 2, the video switched over to a children's movie, then the children's movie was followed by cartoons and then film of a church service (with no sound) was displayed. I happened to leave the video playing while typing this review... That's how I got to see the church service. The video does have scene selections, but as I said, only the Beginning Workout, Workout 1 and half of Workout 2 show rowing content. The rest of the DVD content was unrelated to rowing. I'm giving this 2 stars because, as I said, the rowing portions are very good. I've contacted the seller and hope to get a replacement DVD. I don't want a refund because I'm sure that if I can get a good copy it will be well worth the cost (and the hassle of having to exchange it). I actually find this funny... for the cost of this video, the rowing parts met and exceeded my expectations... the additional content was unexpected and laughable.",1442880000,,1152,4.464454976303317
8266848,5,B0017PEOWM,"Where the quality is not HD, it does give the rower a sense of being on the river.  I play it on my lap-top facing me and keep up with the speed.  A very helpful tool for the beginning rower.  I have a Waterrower and have added the Lap-top stand and this DVD  plays on the Lap-top and adds a great amount of realism.",1434672000,3,316,3.890625

8266850,4,B0017PEOWM,"I enjoyed the video. SURE it's not for someone that is experienced. But it is great for starting out, to get a feel of rowing.
What are the other reviewers expecting in this, I haven't the faintest idea. Every time you play the DVD (or any DVD), you will get the same video, the same scenery (DUH!). So enough already. Get out and row then. Sell the video back for someone new to rowing instead of complaining about it. IF YOU HAVE BEEN ROWING FOR A LONG TIME, THEN DON'T GET THE VIDEO !
It's a GREAT VIDEO FOR STARTING OUT, and you won't break the bank buying it!

** There is a counter in the upper left that counts down. If you listen carefully (turn up the volume on the TV),(or hook up some ear buds in your ears), you can hear the coach calling out the routine. He will tell you to slow down/rest, speed up to a 32 s/m, and so on.
You just don't play the video and just row, you need to listen to the coach instructing the rowers how fast or slow. THAT is the key to this video.
I found this to be a really good feel for starting out.
If you don't like the video, then sell it back for other newbe's to get a feel.",1420502400,3,1120,4.0

8266852,2,B0017PEOWM,"This is the most thumbs down review I have ever written and as a result it may not be published. I purchased this when it came out in VHS form and it was terrific. I purchased this when it first hit in DVD Format. And the quality was also terrific. This lastest purchase is, well you insert your own four letter word or words! This DVD looks like it was copied from one of the old DVD's which had been well used. The color is of the count down timer is so blury it is very difficult to read and the TABLE OF CONTENTS HAS BEEN LEFT OUT! In other words you can't pick which row you want, you have to hit the ""skip"" button on your remote! On my ""old"" Rowing Machine Companion, There is a brief table of contents where you can of course choose which workout  your want. The words ""New Edition"" really  got me in the return this item mood. You can't even called this ""restored!"" I am truly disappointed. It is obvious that the people behind this release spent all their money on a beautiful cover page and the DVD label. They are outstanding, where my old DVD is ""plane Jane"" but the content is great!",1397088000,12,1096,4.18957345971564
