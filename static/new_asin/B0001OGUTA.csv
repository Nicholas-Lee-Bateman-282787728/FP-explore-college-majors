8015431,2,B0001OGUTA,"Not an advanced program, seems like an overview to teach you each position and names but not actual workout to do.",1400371200,,114,4.476190476190476
8015432,2,B0001OGUTA,"This is far short of advanced matwork.  I would be embarassed to title this advanced. It leaves out most  of the 34  exercises that are found in the original work Contrology. One of the demonstrators is hardly ready for anything approaching advanced. You would be better served to get the book Pilates for Men that has genuinely advanced work and the entire 34 exercise mat work series in the original order and as it was intended to be done by Joe Pilates.  Maybe the author meant for you to add the exercises in this cd to the beginning and intermediate programs. I don't know.  If so he didn't make that clear.

I consider this to be something of a fraud. Which is a shame because I think the book on matwork written by the author is pretty good.",1237593600,6,749,4.391304347826087
8015433,4,B0001OGUTA,"This is a good DVD not a well done DVD (has a very immature feeling to it, kind of as if they hurriedly threw it together), yes, the workout is challenging enough, bad part is - it does not provide any warm-up in the beginning, of course you can do your own, but a great work-out DVD should have it all...",1203292800,4,305,4.016393442622951
8015434,5,B0001OGUTA,"If you think you know how to perform your routines correctly - think again. This Aussie Pilates style of exercising is more specific in its cuing and performance than all other styles.

Its main focus in on the breathing -""The breathing makes the exercise!"" By implimenting this deeply throughout the program you find a more aerobic type of workout - and a greater challenge all over, especially on the abdominals. This is a no-nonsense workout that uses the first two levels (Beginners and Intermediate) as a great basis for approaching this challenge.

The author of this series has been teaching Pilates for over 20 years and is the pioneer of the method in Australia. This different approach is safe and has new cuing you have never come across before. Enjoy it - its definitely worth it!",1102464000,13,792,4.8161764705882355
8015435,5,B0001OGUTA,"I've been doing beginner and intermediate pilates programs for over a year, and had good results.  This program is a huge leap ahead of all of them!  It's like getting in your yoga, stretching, and meditation along with a butt-kicking strength workout.  The best part is that once you've learned it, you have an entire awesome workout in your head, since no equipment is needed.  It also feels just terrific on my back and is very relaxing.  There are so many new exercises introduced from the intermediate programs that it becomes more of a full-body program.  The instruction style is clear and easy to follow, though it really is not intended to be followed along in real time.  It's better to watch carefully each exercise, taking notes if necessary, and do it on your own, especially since the instructor says at the beginning that while he is showing 4-5 reps, he recommends doing 10.",1095811200,25,890,4.740259740259741
