6667652,5,B00NMF8SEK,"David Oyelowo was amazing in the portrayal of Martin Luther King. The rest of the cast was outstanding. The storyline and Its opening scene is a great reminder of what life was like before the Voting Rights Act, with poll taxes and absurd literacy tests suppressing the Black vote.  The movie  was interesting from beginning to end and will leave you thinking about it long after it is over. This movie is so worth watching.!  It will be  without a doubt an Oscar winner!",1420761600,4,471,4.571428571428571
6667653,5,B00NMF8SEK,"From director Ava DuVernay is the true story behind the life and plight of Martin Luther King Jr. and his march towards equality. Taking place during the 1960s with the Lyndon B. Johnson administration we find Martin Luther King trying to gain support by the president in pushing legislation that gave the right for African-Americans to vote, a right that is already given at birth. When there isn't support by the president we follow Martin Luther King to Selma, Alabama where residents of the town stand behind Mr. King in the support of the right to vote and the path to freedom. But in wake of the protests they find violence and outrage by the white community that pushes Mr. King to the brink.

The film is truly moving and historical in the fact that we get to see the story behind Kings movement that may not have been taught in schools. For anyone who wants to get a real life account of how grueling the times were like during the civil rights movement will get a handful with Selma and gain appreciation for the efforts Mr. King brought to the African -American community. David Oyelowo who plays Martin Luther King was amazing as he not only played the part well but sounded brilliant when giving his speeches throughout the film. His speeches were moving at times and you could feel the respect and love he had for there to be peace amongst everyone in the community.

And its not without saying that Selma has its moments of shock when some of the African American community is beaten down by police guards. One scene that had an affect on the audience took place during the night when marchers walked through the streets to only be assaulted by the police. Wed then follow a family who runs into a local cafe to only find the police walk in and continue to beat down the family and then take the life of Jimmie Lee Jackson (Keith Stanfield). When Viola Lee Jackson (Charity Jordan) holds her son while he lies motionless you can feel the pain and anguish from the brutal attack. Martin Luther King would meet the parents of their slain child to give his coundolescense and to reassure that Jimmies death wouldnt go in vein. The movie isn't for the light hearted and shows how racially charged some parts of the South were like towards the blacks.

There were many great performances by not only David Oyelowo but also co-stars Tom Wilkinson as Lyndon B. Johnson. Never knowing his relationship with Mr. King it was interesting to see how Johnson felt towards civil rights and his passive aggressive stance of a peaceful protest while trying to pursue other political agendas as well. Wilkinsons performance was superb and gave insight into the presidency at the time until he finally passed a law that gave the rights for African-Americans to vote. This among the infamous speech given by Mr. King highlighted the achievements he made and the sacrifices that came with it. Mr. King also had a family and wife who loved him dearly and worried of violence spreading their way. Kings wife played by Coretta Scott King was great as she had good chemistry with Oyelowo when they were together. Although we don't see much of the wife she has a respectable personality of somebody who believes in what her husband in trying to do.

Technically the film debuted in 2014 and should at least get a nod for the Oscars because of how powerful and telling the film is. An Oscar worthy performance by David Oyelowo who was just perfect at playing the late Martin Luther King. Intense moments throughout as your just taken in by the struggles during the times of hardship. Ava DuVernay did an amazing job by telling the story in a way that everyone would be appreciative of seeing on the big screen. And as for history itself, this will be a great film piece for all to experience and to see how far weve gotten from a time of racial segregation and a nation becoming one.",1420761600,6,3872,4.607246376811594

6667680,5,B00NMF8SEK,"Selma shows Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. as a man who must lead, not one that chose such a difficult life for himself. On the contrary, it was very difficult for King and his family. In trying times, he chose to be truthful, brave, dignified, yet remained modest in his composure. King is an undeniable hero for the ages. Director Ava Duvernay really captures how he touches people's lives and changed the country, but why he was necessary.

Selma is beautifully shot with cinematography that lets in the scenery. Ava Duvernay directs Selma with passion to show pain, intellect, and unity among the black community during the 1960's Civil Rights Movement. America could use this brilliantly written film now more than ever. Racial politics are a part of the daily conversation still, so it would behoove you to educate and inform yourself on the most notable Civil Rights leaders. A fun and entertaining way to learn about this important time period in modern American history would be to just watch Ava Duvernay's Selma & Spike Lee's Malcolm X.

While Selma is not a full biopic on Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., it does rise to the challenge of communicating the issue of black voting rights and how their rights as humans were denied to them by government law and prevented change by the racist South. Duvernay takes her time crafting the context and setting for these events. She establishes the major figures, then dives into the deeply emotional and difficult obstacles that King had to overcome.

Strong acting performances from David Oyelowo as King as well as the stand out performance from the young actor portraying Congressman John Lewis. I enjoyed the whole cast, who all play their part with conviction and passion. They are subtle in their choices and deeply engaging. Selma is a rare gem is historical cinema as it is both entertaining and educational. I was really moved by this film. It plays on the reality of the situation, so as not to force contrived emotions, but rather build up your empathy from the violence and danger of the situation.

I highly recommend Ava Duvernay's Selma.",1520726400,,2101,4.844011142061281

6667701,4,B00NMF8SEK,"One of the most poignant films for 2014 and ""Selma"" remains very aware of this (the reference to Ferguson in the end credits song Glory is an obvious, yet subliminal message). On the one hand it strikes at the roots of the current civil rights movement: oppression at the hands of a racist government, as well as home grown terrorism towards the African-American community. However the strength of ""Selma"" lies in its taught political drama between president Linden B. Johnson, governor George Wallace, and the courts. Selma is about the wisdom of how one must circumnavigate the law in win popular opinion. While one could argue its unfair to the Caucasian-heavy government, the peacefulness and courage of the protesters rightfully disgraces the modern-day Ferguson protesters. A theme of non-violence is mournful side of ""Selma"" (note how the deaths are dramatically emphasized in the film), portraying righteous martyrdom for their beliefs.",1514419200,,944,5.3

6667703,5,B00NMF8SEK,"This movie grabs you from the opening scene where joy and innocence are thieved by injustice and hatred. I believe this is a movie for every American to watch. I am 30-years-old, and what I was taught in school does not mirror the reality of factual history. What I was conditioned to see was an illusion of equality when there is systemic brokenness in our country. I am so thankful for heroes like MLK Jr. and James Baldwin who challenged illusions of liberty with practicalities and odds that were (and are) oppressive by nature to our Black brothers and sisters. I won't start preaching, but this movie is incredible. For those who are doing work of racial reconciliation in the Church, if you are a POC, I want to warn you against some major triggers this might hold for you. This movie had me weeping in moments uncontrollably, but a painful reality should not have us shy away from acknowledgement. Praying for all these facts to be reconciled and for a national repentance to happen. With God all things are possible.

In short, this movie was really well-written, gave me a great snapshot of a time I'm thankful me and my younger friends like myself didn't have to live through, and is a must see for everyone- American or not.",1513123200,,1236,4.618181818181818

6667711,3,B00NMF8SEK,"The movie was a bit disappointing for a few reasons. First of all, it is historically inaccurate. The movie makes LBJ look like a racist jerk, when the march in Selma and the idea to pass a bill protecting the right to vote for minorities was LBJ's idea to begin with. Also, the movie makes Dr. King look like a boring robot. Even if that's how his personality was, it was hard to care about him in the movie. A lot of times it seemed like he was just around while all of the other people were the ones making you care about what was happening. Also, it was very difficult to understand what people were saying a lot of them time. It wasn't hard conceptually speaking, but their accents and incredibly quiet voices forced me to turn on subtitles. Also, the volume difference between the loudest parts of the movie and the quietest parts was too much and I had to continuously turn my movie up and down from about 35 volume to 70 and back over and over and over.

The movie has a few too many misses in it to be considered a good movie, but it is still worth the watch, despite its shortcomings. Just click that CC button first.",1506470400,,1127,4.266355140186916

6667728,4,B00NMF8SEK,"The story of the Selma-Montgomery march is put on film as fully as it could be.  Some have dismissed this production as historically inaccurate; and while I'm not any insider expert on the Alabama civil rights movement, this film is spot-on in its recreation of time and place, persons and passions.  David Oyelowo is outstanding in his rendition of King, with all the real man's doubts and conflicts and shortcomings as well as his mountain-moving vision.  The scene in jail, where King accuses Coretta of spiritual infidelity, then reaches his hand through the bars asking forgiveness is one all couples need to view to understand of what marriage truly consists.

Tom Wilkinson captures the conniving and profanely bullying essence of Lyndon Johnson; the reactionary reflexes of George Wallace, Sheriff Jim Clark, and J. Edgar Hoover are displayed accurately.  Characters are introduced - like Diane Nash and Viola Liuzzo - whom the viewer is supposed to know, but rather slighted as to why they should be remembered.  There are tie-ins to current concerns: a mounted trooper slashing a fugitive with a whip, to recall ""!2 Years a Slave;"" a rapping tribute to Ferguson to link the Selma events to ""us.""  That can be overlooked, but what knocked off a fifth star for me was what the film left out: the singing, joyous nature of the marches and demonstrations.  The crossing of the Pettus Bridge seems a little too grim, a shuffling passage of movie-extra automatons herded by a field director, than the clapping and shouting marchers of memory.  The rendition of ""This Little Light"" in the film's closing credits gives a hint of their real spirit, which this production somewhat lacked.

Otherwise it is a faithful reproduction of the ideals and tribulations of a time when victory was assured, but not its final cost.  The intrigue and tensions within the movement, between the SCLC and SNCC; and between Johnson and King and the President's own party and staff are honestly - sometimes brutally - made transparent.  Much of the KIng/civil rights literature, film and print, smacks too much of piety and hagiography.

Racism has come a long way since the time period of this movie but we still have a long way to go and this movie focuses on the way we can overcome this unwelcome ideology: unification under the plan of the God who created us as men and women, sons and daughters, and brothers and sisters of equal placement in his glorious kingdom.",1493078400,,847,4.470967741935484

6667829,5,B00NMF8SEK,"I lived through the civil rights movement as an adolescent. I had forgotten MLKs courage and compassion and intellectual brilliance. He was one of the best this country has produced. But the movement also was about millions of average Afro-Americans saying ""enough""; we deserve exactly the same rights you enjoy-- no more, no less--and the brutality and ignorance of Southerners who thought that segregation was forever. The nonviolent aspects of the movement, in hindsight were incredibly courageous and self-disciplined. It's rare when you can see history transforming itself in front of you--after all, blacks had been terrorized in the South for hundreds of years--but this was one of those moments. Of course, LBJ, was forced to the right thing; but he made up for it by escalating Vietnam simultaneously. It was as if he couldn't be pure: he had to nurture both the moral and immoral at the same time.

With all of the hate speech and crimes that are now supported by the current administration in D.C., this movie strikes a chord that I do not want to hear or see again.  The ugliness of "" human beings"" is on full display and I felt embarrassed for the white race as a whole. I am old enough to remember desegregation in the 60's and I can tell you that we do not need to repeat this time in our history.  It is ugly, repulsive and every other negative adjective that one can think of.  This movie grabs you by the heart and does not let go.

6668071,5,B00NMF8SEK,This was a very good presentation of the events concerning the Selma March. Good actors and the story itself grips you with what had to be confronted and overcome. Imagine the courage it took to deal with what amounts to hatred and prejudice in the culture of the south.

6668084,5,B00NMF8SEK,"This is a heart-wrenching movie and a timely reminder of the hatred and inhumanity that springs from divisiveness. The acting was phenomenal. Tim Roth made my blood boil and I love the guy! The tension between Dr. King and his wife in light of his infidelity  - and her gradual forgiveness - was well-played without overshadowing the main plot. As some reviewers have mentioned, this drama does not delve into all the historical details, but that's ok. I see no issue with focusing on those parts we'd be well-advised to never forget. The violence against people of color and against some of their white allies during the Civil Rights movement was absolutely abhorrent and ""Selma"" captures this at every turn. Let's all make sure that history does not repeat itself.  Oh, and speaking of timeliness, here's your chance to see Congressman John Lewis' role in the movement!",1485043200,,871,4.918367346938775

6668088,5,B00NMF8SEK,"The march from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery, Alabama, to protest the obstacles put in the way of African-Americans trying to register to vote strikes a deep chord today when some states are trying once again to make it difficult for certain people to vote. Rev. Martian Luther King, Rev. Ralph Abernathy, Andrew Young, John Lewis (then a student, now a Congressman from Georgia), and other great figures of the civil rights movement are portrayed as they discuss, disagree, and strategize, as they pray and hope and put their lives on the line to make this dramatic march for voting rights and African-American equality. The acting is stellar and the film is moving. It shows a part of our history we would do well to remember.",1484956800,2,739,4.78125

As for the film, it is thoughtfully and beautifully made. The violence is achingly effective, not gratuitous - but it's still there, and I think this film is more R rated because of the violence.

I also liked that this movie didn't answer EVERY question it posed about that event.  It left some things to interpretation.  David Oyelowo as MLK and Stephan James as Rep John Lewis were especially moving and powerful.  I always have a difficult time watching movies about civil rights because it is so difficult to see people behaving so badly toward their fellow man but this was was riveting.  I started out watching it alone but by the halfway point of the movie both my children had wandered through the room and become entranced by it.  It provided a great context to the Selma march, the fight for civil rights,equal treatment and the importance of maintaining a fair, open and honest election that does not discriminate over race, creed, religion, or sexual orientation.

I may have have to watch it again because there was so much going on that made me have to really think about that time frame in our history, I may have missed some of it while deep in thought.  :-)  And it made my kids better understand that time period.

I was going to show it to my high school class and decided not to because of the crass vulgarity that got in the way of a truly deserving message that I managed to share with my students without crass vulgarity (F word)/offensive language - I can see using profanity to make a point, but in this case it's too vulgar.",1484697600,,603,4.206896551724138

6668186,5,B00NMF8SEK,"The dialogue was kind of wooden, didn't give the actors much to work with but that was the only flaw in this powerfully moving film. I cried on and off through the entire thing. When Selma happened I was only 13, and had forgotten much of the history. Time had even muted the intensity of it all. Selma brought it all back with heartbreaking clarity.

I also could not stop thinking about how little some things have changed: The hateful crowds lining the streets now fill political rallies, the police brutality we're still seeing, and politicians in power who either won't help or actively seek to do harm, the racist stereotypes that (at least some) people still clearly believe, and the ugly hatred that apparently had only been thinly papered over all these years and is now breaking out all over. But when you watch this movie you also can't help but see how far we have come as a nation in such a relatively short time, and you appreciate the incredible power of what King, Abernathy, Young, Lewis, and so many others accomplished.

The actress for Coretta Scott King looked like her and displayed the strength of this woman in a respectful way. Very well acted, disturbing truth of our history, yet inspiring. It's a reminder of what people can do when they work together. Also, to see Mr. JohnLewis's contribution to civil rights in Selma depicted was perfect timing for me, especially considering the recent comments made by Presdent-elect Trump and others who don't agree with him boycotting the inaugaration.

I understand the criticisms of the historical inaccuracy.  To add the usual Hollywood drama, some liberties were taken with the facts, primarily LBJ being portrayed in opposition to Dr. King, when in reality, they worked together to get the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act passed.

I still found the portrayal of the human side of Dr. King and his wife and the human suffering involved in the historical events to be well done. It is a shame so little of Dr. King's actual words and speeches could be used in the movie due to the rights being sold to a different project.

Growing up in Northern California where society was more blended in the 60's, the vicious racism of the South is hard for me to comprehend.  To see it portrayed honestly and graphically (as hate crime and violence always should be) was heartbreaking.  Movies like this should be required viewing and for anyone who thinks this is the past and it's all better now, guess again.  Just because an issue sinks below the veneer of the reality we regularly view, doesn't mean it's gone or that it won't take much to bring it to the surface again.",1483401600,3,608,4.541284403669724

Except for Ralph Abernathy, casting was first rate.

6668688,5,B00NMF8SEK,"Very good movie, but not a documentary. So, don't watch it and then think you have the civil rights movement down cold. It's entertaining and suspenseful, violent and wrenching, heartbreaking and sickening. I found it to be a most appropriate monument to the great men who led the fight for equality in the 50's and 60's. It's also worthy of noting all of the thousands of ""little"" people who stood shoulder to shoulder with those great leaders. The movie gives a nod to their sacrifice, stoicism and resolve. As one who was a teenager during those troubled years, I found the movie a solid story well told and based on fact. But, not necessarily factual in all respects.

6668689,3,B00NMF8SEK,"Pretty good acting, although the dialog, particularly from the character of Dr. King, was hard to understand. Perhaps the actor was trying too hard to sound like Dr. King, and therefore the message was lost. By the time you figured out what he said, you already missed his next line.

The unending trend of those that were raised by their parents, and learn the practices of their parents without the ability to question that which is forced upon them. The choices are those that have been gifted to us, and the freedom to change our minds when our non child mind kicks in and we question what we have been taught.

6668869,4,B00NMF8SEK,"In 1964 and 1965 Dr. Martin Luther King (David Oyelowo) became heavily involved in a protest movement in Alabama designed to give all African Americans the vote. As with most of his campaigns, he advocated nonviolent methods, but was often met with violent responses from the white majority, orchestrated by Governor George Wallace (Tim Roth). Dr. King became involved not only with the local community but with President Lyndon B. Johnson (Tom Wilkinson), who was intransigent at first, but eventually swayed by force of circumstance into passing a bill removing all restrictions on the African American vote.

Ava DuVernay's film tells a straightforward tale punctuated by memorable individual sequences. At the beginning Annie Lee Cooper (Oprah Winfrey) enters the courthouse in Selma in a vain attempt to register to vote; she is summarily denied by the white official. Nothing much is actually said but gestures signify everything; the humiliation experienced by Annie Lee set against the arrogance of the official. Later on, in the wake of the first abortive protest mounted by the African American community as they try to cover the fifty or so miles from Selma to the state capital Montgomery, three African Americans enter a diner and pretend to order food, in the vain hope that they will escape the pursuing white state troopers. The troopers enter and summarily beat them senseless, taking the life of Jimmy Lee Jackson (Lakeith Stanfield) in the process.

The film's moral stance is unequivocal; in a world still riddled by institutional racism, the African Americans have a justifiable cause to plead. As performed by Oyelowo, Dr. King comes across as a tenacious personality, unwilling to give up his cause even in the face of overwhelming odds. Every time the President protests his inability to help, Dr. King goads him; we understand from such confrontations just how scared the President actually was of allowing too many concessions to the African American community.

Brilliantly staged, with careful attention to detail, SELMA deserves to be considered a modern classic, marred only slightly by Roth's rather artificial Southern accent as Governor Wallace.",1471910400,,2178,5.270893371757925

While the story is not as romantic as BOYCOTT, it is much larger in scope.  This film captures the whole of the movement whereas BOYCOTT was largely focused on King only.  I highly recommend both.  While BOYCOTT is about the world being introduced to MLK, this film is about the man that MLK became at the height of his popularity--1964-65.  I absolutely love the cameo of Malcolm in this and the fact that the actress who played Coretta in BOYCOTT reclaims the role here.  Very nice piece.",1469577600,3,630,4.580357142857143

That time in American history during the civil rights movements was told with such detail, it seemed to put the audience in the front seat as the action unfolded. This film showed America at its worst and finest moments!  The most remarkable thing I saw was how History tends to repeats itself.  On March 25, 1965, Martin Luther King Led thousands of nonviolent demonstrators to the steps of the capital in Montgomery, Alabama, these people were met with such violence by the Police.  It resembled in comparison to the numerous shootings and senseless killings today ( 2015-2016) of African American people by the Police, the one's we pay to keep all safe.

6669116,5,B00NMF8SEK,"***** 5 Stars ***** A story every American should know:  on August 6, 1965 - largely in response to Dr. King's refusal to back down in Selma, and the subsequent violence by white southern racists - the Voting Rights Act was signed into law.  The Democratic Party controlled both houses of the Congress, as well as the White House, but this was a wholly bi-partisan bill and passed easily.  Less than three years later Dr. King was dead.  And in 2013, 45 years after his death, the voting rights act that Dr. King had dreamt of and won, was struck-down by today's Republican majority of the Supreme Court.  Despite continuing efforts to complicate minority voters' access to the polls (special ID cards, reduced polling places in minority neighborhoods, reduced polling days, etc.) the Supreme Court ruled that Dr. King's Voting Rights Act was ""based on 40 year-old facts having no logical relationship to the present day"" - and they gutted it.  The film ""Selma"" does well in showing the terrible struggles of 1964-65, and the great ambivalence of the Federal government to intervene.  It also does a good job of 'humanizing' Dr. King - which is important - but fails entirely to capture the thunderous majesty and overwhelming charisma of Dr. King's public persona ... the very qualities that made him a leader in the first place.",1465171200,,1330,4.832599118942731

This movie completely took me somewhere 40 years ago and allowed me to visualize some of the things that I thought had gone on. I really wish the person that wrote this movie would have placed this into some sort of 10 - 15 hour mini-series so that others could get the full understanding of how things where and how things operated in a place such as Selma.

The acting by all was superb.

More importantly, it reminds us of the ongoing struggle for equality and the injustices that still plague many Americans today, be it because of race, religion or sexual orientation.

Dr. Kings dream has still yet to be realized by many many Americans. Racism and economic inequality is as bad now as it was back then, only difference now is there is somewhat less violence, but not much.

Berlin tore down their wall, yet some Americans want to build one.
When will we all see the bigger picture that we are all human, with the same wants and needs, and just by working together we could make Dr. Kings Dream a reality.

Watch this movie before our Presidential Election and see how you feel then.",1464220800,,863,4.443037974683544

I thanked God that the white people in my town did not do such things (as far as I knew).  This history illustrates how important it is to vote and what a privelege it is. I don't know how any American black or white chooses not to vote after seeing what truly brave and courageous people had to endure to secure this right for all. The film is a great acievement and important chronicle of what was, and still is ugly about america and at the same time what was and still is beautiful about america.",1463961600,,752,4.115646258503402

I truly enjoyed the entire movie from start to finish. I really enjoyed the footage at the end! Sammy Davis Jr., Harry Belafonte. It was truly an eye opener. And really gave a graphic account of the events. I think that the producer did well showing what people went through to be heard. But peaceful. To matter, to voice their opinion of who ran their country, state, counties, etc. Isn't it sad how much blood was shed just to get something that everyone should be entitled to!

  This tale of struggle, pain, terror, defiance, justice, and accolades begins on the evening that Dr. Martin Luther King(David Oyelowo) accepts the Nobel Peace Prize in December 1964 accompanied by his wife, Coretta(Carmen Ejogo).
  But it soon flashes back to Sunday, September 15, 1963 when a bomb tears through Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church, killing four young girls heading down to the basement.
  Oprah Winfrey's Annie Lee Cooper is cheated out of her right to vote by the white registrar in Selma, Alabama--an all too common occurance for minorities at that time.
  King and the members of the  Southern Christian leadership Conference(SCLC) travel to Selma to confront the problem. These include Andrew Young(Andre Holland), James Orange(Omar Dorsey), Diane Nash(Tessa Thompson) and Ralph Abernathy(Coleman Domingo).
  FBI Director, J. Edgar Hoover(Dylan Baker), who would later be discovered to have African American antecedents himself, views King as problematic and threatens to disrupt his marriage after meeting with President Johnson(Tom Wilkinson), who believes that he has more important issues that the Civil Rights issue.
  When demonstrators march to register in the Selma registration office, there is a confrontation, a shoving match, and a scuffle which ends with Annie Lee Cooper knocking Sheriff Jim Clark( Stan Houston) to the ground, leading to the arrest of all the demonstrators. Mahalia Jackson's(Ledisi Young) singing helped King keep up his morale that this time.
 We view Malcom X's(Nigel Thatch) discussion with Coretta, regarding the differences in their styles of campaigning for Civil Rights, as Alabama Governor George Wallace(Tim Roth) stands in willful  opposition of the Civil Rights campaign. With a complicit highway patrolman named Al Lingo (Stephen Root) Wallace decides to use at  a scheduled nighttime march in Marion, Alabama. Participant Jimmie Lee Jackson(Keith Stanfield) is murdered by an angry mob in front of his mother, and  the other Civil Rights campaigners  experiences various forms of harassment.
  Crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge on Sunday, March 7, 1965, marchers, including King, John Lewis(Stephen James), Hosea Williams(Wendell Pierce), and march organizer Amelia Boynton(Lorraine Toussaint) are among those who face off with a row of state troopers who club the marchers, throw tear gas, and attack them with other weapons as the cameras roll in the incident known as America's Bloody Sunday.
  As Fred Gray(Cuba Gooding Jr.) the attorney of the movement pleads with the Federal Judge Frank Minis(Martin Sheen), President Johnson sends John Doar (Alessandro Nivola) to tell the demonstrators to hold off on another march.
  As White Americans from the north, including Viola Liuzzo (Tara Ochs)  and Reverend James Reeb(Jeremy Strong) join the movement, we view  more setbacks and tragedies that will ensue as, in King's words, ""...The moral arch of the Universe bends towards justice....""
 Niecey Nash plays Richie Jean Jackson, Ruben Santiago-Hudson, appears as Bayard Rustin, and Common's  James Bevel are among those rounding out the cast as the stirring and Oscar winning rap anthem, ""Glory"", by Common and John Legend brings this historical drama to its emotion-laden climax.
 While it may have its inconsistencies ""Selma"" portrays  many facets of the Civil Rights struggle in a formidable manner, and I highly recommend this laudable effort.",1461542400,,3647,5.491921005385996
6669431,5,B00NMF8SEK,I know this is a good movie from its award nominations. I just did not realize how powerful and moving it is until I watched it.  I definitely have more respect now for Dr. King and the human rights movement.,1461542400,,208,4.2

6669478,5,B00NMF8SEK,It was very good. Scary on how hard it was for our African American families to deal with the ignorance of the white people and worse the political cowards who were allowing the people to be so mean and so brutal and violent. It was portrayed so very well. I will be watching it again for sure.,1461024000,,294,4.175438596491228
6669479,4,B00NMF8SEK,Movie was pretty good and pretty close to accurate according to written history. I'm a H.S.

6669480,5,B00NMF8SEK,Excellent movie. A real eye opener on how the South showed its prejudice in the 1960.,1461024000,,85,4.375
6669481,3,B00NMF8SEK,The movie is not historically accurate.. Once again Hollywood twists the truth of the whole Selma story.  As a student of the history of the Rev Dr. martin Luther King I do not see why the writers and directors didn't go through the books of Taylor Branch but then again it's Hollywood.,1461024000,,286,4.5

6669502,5,B00NMF8SEK,"I thought this was one of the most thought provoking presentations of the battles Martin Luther King, Jr. faced on his ministry of Civil Rights. Too often we forget the complicated dynamics of public life when one is trying to reverse a historical wrong, and even more we forget that these martyrs are fully human beings with all the strengths and weaknesses as such. This is the first time I have seen anything that reveals the schism within the marriage due to what has always been public knowledge of Dr. King's ""thorn"", however the strength of Mrs. King throughout these trying times explains a lot about her works for both Dr. King and the movement after his death. After watching this movie I would propose that a monument to Mrs. King be erected next to Dr. King. Awesome movie. It's important to see how far we have come, and how much farther we have to go.",1461024000,,865,4.551282051282051

6669506,4,B00NMF8SEK,"The over-compression of dark areas in the image was particularly objectionable in this movie because it extended into the actors faces in many scenes.  Re-watching on Prime after previously renting the Blu-ray which did not have this issue. (Pretty sure it's not buffering/congestion... we usually get about a 23Mbps download rate from Amazon, as reported by the player built into our Blu-Ray player, which far exceeds the 3.5Mbps they say their HD streams require. Using wired Ethernet, so can't blame the microwave or neighbors' wifi.)

The movie is fine work; look to others for review of it. Just wanted to mention the compression. I'd rate it 4 stars for the Blu-Ray, too.",1461024000,,677,5.035714285714286

This film glossed over and glamorized all of the issues that were going on in Selma at the time. It turned it into a romantic history-book lesson. It is sad to see real issues treated as if they were/are merely soap opera.

Jefferson Smith was talking about his father, but he could just as easily been talking about MLK all those years later.

""I guess this is just another lost cause. You all don't know about lost causes, but Senator Payne knows.

Change was brought about by brave people who saw crimes against humanity for what it was, stood up, and began the continual struggle for equality. I had a boss who marched in Selma.

6669938,4,B00NMF8SEK,"David Oyelowo should have been nominated for an Academy Award for his performance of the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in this film. This film is about the Civil Rights movement and the march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama in 1965. The Deep South still kept it's Jim Crow laws and segregation. The march was about voting rights for all regardless of race. Oprah Winfrey has a role in the film of a voter applicant turned down. There are other memorable performances by Martin Sheen; Cuba Gooding Jr.; Lorraine Toussaint; Tom Wilkinson; Dylan Baker; Giovanni Ribisi; Niecy Nash; and more. Winfrey was also a producer of this film.

Tom Wilkinson does a terrific job playing the late President Lyndon B. Johnson. Dylan Baker was miscast as J. Edgar Hoover. David Oyelowo performed King with dignity, class, and style. Even the difficult scenes in the film are done with care and sensitivity. This film is a must see for Civil Rights films in understanding how America was before the Civil Rights Bill was finally passed.

The film details how the march on Selma began from the grassroots campaign of the locals and catching the attention of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights activists of the time. The Selma march included marchers from all races, backgrounds, religions, and ethnicities.

Sadly, the DVD only includes 2 extra features. I would have liked to have seen and learn more about the film's background.",1457913600,,1431,4.8806584362139915

For a film with this rating, I expected a little better with my young children watching, even if it may have been historically accurate (hard to know since both participants to the alleged conversation have long been dead). The filmmakers were very tactful dealing with the issue of MLK's adultery, but then went full on with the f-bomb laced profanity of LBJ talking to George Wallace, which, in comparison, was a head-scratcher. Otherwise, very well done and very thought provoking.",1457740800,,621,5.038834951456311

Though I first didn't like Johnson, when he ran against Kennedy for the Democratic nominee, I came to respect him. He inherited a lot of problems, when he was suddenly thrust into the Presidency. He is to be admired for what he did managed to get thru Congress.
What a shame this movie took to ignore his role in civil rights. Was hard to appreciate the great performances, with that thought in my mind. I would have given it 5 stars, if not for that. LOL. They made J Edgar Hoover's looks too good.",1456963200,2,609,4.304347826086956

Could other aspects of the story be used to tell a more inspiring or interesting story? Yes! It seemed a bit preachy and most white people are not being like the ones in the movie. That era was a black mark on our history and the history of how white people acted. We know that. Maybe it would have been better to focus on all the people who stood by Dr King.

The movie does justice to the great crowd of supporters required to make the eventual victory possible.  Martin is portrayed as always pushing to get the eye of the broadest swath of the public on the problem.

For quality acting, one part in particular stands out: There is a tense and quiet scene where Martin pauses his march, and silently, together with his group, prays through an uncertain, unexpected, apparently positive turn of events to try to sense the real truth of the confrontation at hand.  It speaks to the quiet strength which penetrated Martin's walk through an unceasing reign of racial violence in Selma, Mississippi.

I have to say that the film was excellent and the treatment of the trials and triumph at Selma was detailed, measured and not given to sensationalism. Mr. Oyelowo is an incredible actor and did a fine job in his portrayal of Dr. King. It was also interesting to see the representations of Andrew Young and John Lewis, individuals who still work towards better relations between the races in the U.S. to this day. This film adds meaning and texture to the many fine documentaries about this turbulent time in American history.",1456012800,5,758,4.838461538461538
6670332,1,B00NMF8SEK,"In my opinion this movie didn't make MLK a leader or hero. To me he appeared like trouble maker who pushed people into dangerous situations and stood by and watched. The Selma courthouse scene was ridiculous. He knew that the Sheriff was dangerous and probably get a chubby when he found out he was like Bull Johnson. He lead the march to the courthouse with his silk suit on and when they got there, he stood behind and watched. He should have been out front. Jimmy Hoffa was a leader, he would be out front and stayed, not go to the rear. Where was he when they marched the first time over the bridge? He sent those poor people to do his dirty work. He tells Lewis in the car that he can't take violence and brutally anymore! Lewis meanwhile has a freaking bandage on his head. The second march cover the bridge he knew damn well they'd be OK. His followers were the heroes, they should be the subject of the movie, not MLK.
IT is horrible what those poor people went through and I don't think they get enough credit, all the accolades were gobbled up by MLK. Someone who gives great speeches and then sacrifices his followers by sending them into dangerous situations and keeps himself safe isn't a leader",1456012800,,1208,4.42152466367713

I know this to be mostly true because I grew up in this state and know that a lot of the segregation law were horrible. The treatment was very bad to the African American people. This movie hit me hard because I went to school with one of the young ladies that died in the bombing. We lived close to each other and the memory of that is not a pretty picture to remember her dying at such a young age. The movie was very good showing how horrible the law was and they got away with that type of behavior. I still wonder how those people slept and claim to be a children of God. To bomb a church and shoot people for no reason other than that they were black. How a nation could stand by and watch for so long. This makes me wonder about my country.

6670401,4,B00NMF8SEK,"Selma provided me with a different perspective on the march from Selma to Montgomery because of the confrontations that the protestors had with law enforcement. The movie was well-written and had an excellent cast, but I did not believe that some parts of the movie were historically accurate. Selma was a continuation of MLK's Letter from Birmingham Jail and he protested peacefully in the movie without reacting violently to his opposition. The movie also describes consequences that MLK supporters faced from white supremacist groups that disagreed with changing voting laws for African Americans. However, LBJ was presented as a character that seemed to care only for the country and its problems instead of sharing that concern with MLK. I agree that the US had its homeland problems under LBJ in the movie, but MLK was trying to gain support from the president to end voting discrimination against African Americans.",1455667200,,922,5.194630872483222

A good film, like a good book, should more than entertain; but, is an experience to learn from.  Selma teaches some  American history and the African American's struggle for freedom. I learned that freedom is not to be taken for granted, but does require eternal vigilance.

6670443,5,B00NMF8SEK,"How David Oyelowo was not awarded the Oscar for his performance is truly mystifying. I thought his performance was mesmerizing and spot on. The  movie provided outstanding dramatic re-enactment without resorting to sensational manipulation of the facts. The casting was great, with Carmen Ejogo's Coretta almost as perfect as Oyelowo's Martin. Tom Wilkinson's LBJ was also terrific, but I felt Tim Roth's portrayal of George Wallace didn't ring true (I grew up in AL when he was governor and remember him well).
The elements of great storytelling are all there and are flawlessly presented: besides casting, the script is excellent, setting, sets and costumes capture the time and place beautifully, and the pacing of the story keeps interest engaged. This is not a biopic of King, and as such leaves some questions about him, his mission, his ministry and his marriage unanswered. This is a story of the efforts of the civil rights activists to take their peaceful protests to a town where they hoped to make meaningful progress. King is the leader, but the movie gives voice to some of the lesser-known (for many) members of his organization, and also shows how competing groups and individuals worked out their differences on how to take the battle forward.
I heartily recommend this movie, and if you have children over 12 or so who can stomach the brutality of the truth, it is a great movie for opening dialogue about thorny issues. The themes of racism then and now, peaceful protest and resistance, law and order vs. tyranny, etc (the list goes on), make for very informative discussion.",1455580800,,1595,4.97378277153558

6670632,5,B00NMF8SEK,"I for one appreciate the toning down of the historical record that an earlier reviewer spoke of. I lived through the time period depicted as a 13-year-old in the Deep South, and I have no desire to see such intense real-life drama again. It was a terrible time, and the experience of seeing ordinarily good people become morally unhinged (I'm white) was formative. I am grateful that this movie was made and was made so well. The performances are amazing all around, and the script and production values are excellent. Young Americans need to know what happened at Selma, and so the filmmakers wisely dispensed with the more gratuitous crowd pleasers that the film industry resorts to (sex, most notably) to keep the movie available to young viewers.

I don't often give 5-star ratings, but I give this one enthusiastically. This is a wonderfully good movie, and it deserves to be seen and savored. It also deserves better than the Academy Awards snub it received. Depressingly ironic.",1454889600,,985,4.8982035928143715

The story was based on fact, but was filmed with the makers taking artistic license with the story. That being said, it was well directed, well acted, and a film all Americans should watch. When I finished watching I had a new appreciation of what our black brothers and sisters went through in order to vote. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the audio was not good, both my husband and I missed dialogue even when our volume was turned all the way up.

I didn't study the actual history of Martin Luther King and Selma before I saw the movie so I cannot speak to its accuracy but I feel I know more about what happened now that I have seen it.  The acting was very good and the directing and way the movie was done left you with a sense of what it felt like to be a negro in the 1960's.,1454457600,,351,3.861111111111111

6670863,3,B00NMF8SEK,"As an overall movie, it was good.  I think the title is a misnomer.  Personally, I think it should have been named MLK & LBJ because it was more about the interactions of those two that eventually led to events that happened in Selma.  Out of the entire movie about 5% of it focused on those events.  And as someone that was from there I'm just not sold it should have been named that.  Now, did it take away from the movie... NO!  Was the movie in itself good... YES!! In fact there were several things I did learn, so I was glad that I watched it and I will probably watch again.",1454457600,2,581,4.097345132743363

6671013,3,B00NMF8SEK,"A movie like Selma is a must-see purely because of the civil rights ground it covers at a time when racial tensions are once again high. People should educate themselves. That said, while David Oyelowo's performance is strong as Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the plot gets lost in the doldrums at times. The focus should have been on the activists and their struggles, but too often we're left watching white men politicking in back rooms. I also felt excessive cameos detracted a bit from the story.

I don't think I would ever be ready emotionally to watch it but I am that I eventually decided to watch it today and indeed there were several moments where tears flowed freely down my face like a tap turned on. Some of the tears were of sadness and hurt of watching the injustice portrayed and maliciously executed from one human to another.  Other tears were in pride to see human beings behaving as they rightfully should in a period full of darkness. We shall overcome and are overcoming. Glory to God!

I am dumbfounded when seeing and hearing the treatment that was so much a part of the lives of our African-American citizens and brothers. I don't understand how and why so many found it OK or even acceptable to treat people the way our African-American brothers and sisters were treated. My heart goes out to all mistreated persons. We are all children of God, our Heavenly Father.

The movie was excellent!  I applaud those who were responsible for their part in the making of this enlightening project.",1453766400,,848,4.722972972972973

6671153,5,B00NMF8SEK,"A review below says that the movie was simplified to make the events less... dramatic.
The reviewer missed the point.

The story as told, its high art was its quiet tone... the determination of a people but centrally the vision one man's spirit. In real life he likely was mortal and with weaknesses but his words are to this day beautiful and wise.
When others wanted to stir violence between whites and blacks, wanted to fight back, wanted to use the events for a political agenda MLK remained calm and referenced his spiritual beliefs for his guide.

The acting is very good.
It made me realize that our county's true nature has been perverted since 911 for an agenda that includes continuous wars for he domination of Empire, any action to support Israel no matter how immoral their actions or ours, war contracts, Oil contracts, drugs trafficking by our banks, all enabled by the core lie is 911 and none of it is America or American.

The events of Selma is America at its worst and its best.

Good performances from supporting actors as well. It felt a little slow at times, and unnecessarily explicative, but that is probably because I lived through these times as a teenager and remember that era having much more of a sense of urgency than I got from the movie. For young people who don't know what it was like back then, this movie is an excellent education. For black Americans, especially young black men, this movie must resonate. It takes more than electing a black President to teach police how to look at black people the same way they look at white people.",1453680000,,727,4.732283464566929

Shocking & sad, but I'm glad these difficult times are being told and not hidden. I was too young to experience any of the civil rights demonstrations. I asked my father about those years. Basically since we lived in the mid-west, unless it was on the evening news it didn't happen. There wasn't CNN and 24hr coverage. So the Pettus bridge footage brought the struggle into everyone's home.",1453420800,,525,4.78021978021978

6671545,4,B00NMF8SEK,"Certainly worth viewing--historically, it seems fairly accurate. MLK comes across as sincere and a bit flawed (as we all are!).

6671547,4,B00NMF8SEK,"Overall a good movie.  Maybe 2 slow spots where my interest waned.  Gave only 4 out of 5 stars because of deviations from facts:  1) no portrayal of womanizing by Dr. King; and 2) portrayal of President Johnson as less of an advocate for civil rights than he was.  Good that the film was made because we need to be reminded of the oppression that those in power want to maintain to this day when it comes to not only Blacks but women and gays and those whose faith is not Christianity.  These groups continue to battle for the rights that the white male bestowed upon himself centuries ago--human rights.  Don't get me started!  Signed, White Woman in her Sixties",1453334400,,663,4.475

6671550,4,B00NMF8SEK,"Engaging movie.  I found the acting credible (although it is nigh impossible for anybody to fill King's shoes, even as an actor - so that disconnect was very present in my mind as I watched); I found the choice of actors, generally, to be facially credible (I recognized Coretta, Andrew Young, John Lewis and Ralph Abernathy - and Malcolm X too - the moment they appeared; same for Bull Connor and some of the others whose negative roles still makes one want to move away from remembering them at all).  The story is limited to the build up to the march in Selma, and contains sufficient references to history, drama and suggestiveness as to make it a worthy film.",1453334400,,664,4.571428571428571

How hard it might have also been for his wife and kids not knowing if when they saw him, it could be the last time. As all charismatic leaders fighting for human and social rights (Jesuschrist, Gandhi, among others), making a difference in this world against the powers that be, he must have known that somewhere, there was a bullet with his name on it. He didn't let fear and his own personal life and wishes interfere with what he knew he had to do. his followers shared the same courage, spirit, and determination. Together, they achieved the seemingly impossible. We need more men and women of this caliber in today's world.

if you've been *unfortunate* enough to have seen *SCHINDLER'S LIST* you'll have an inside running to this story; to put it bluntly SCHINDLER'S LIST was about ""the jewish plight"" and this story *SELMA* was funded by the company *owned* by one miss *oprah winfrey*, whom is also in the film.

the story is about just one aspect of the life of one *martin luther king jr* and his march from *Selma*, hence the name, to *Montgomery*.

of course there's lots of resistance and miscellaneous murders throughout this film that makes *django unchained* look like *mary poppins* by comparison.

all in all it is a whole heap of *REVISIONIST* codswallop parading as incisive social commentary.

I was a 14 year old little blonde girl in August of 63 when I snuck out of the house to go hear King's Dream Speech, knowing that if my mother did not want to go to that parade that I had to be there, but too young to really understand why.  We were conflicted by the different versions of who and what King and his movement were.  But, youth like me listened and absorbed, and many followed.  And when a white missionary was assassinated in Selma, the community of man finally heard and followed.  Awesome movie, took me back to what I'd forgotten.",1446249600,,931,4.447058823529412

And if you ever had heard Dr. King speak it was a letdown to hear to imitation.  It was good that a movie showing the hate of White America and the way in which Dr. King quiet that hate by getting laws passed, to include the enforcement of those laws by the Government needed to be showed.  But so much was missed.  Another miss understanding is that President Johnson history will never be as great as it should have because of the Viet Nam war, but President Johnson, a southern man, actually wanted to help the American Negro.  His political friends hated this so much that the parties flip flop.  Today democrats are supported by African Americans, but that only happened after President Johnson.

6671863,4,B00NMF8SEK,"While I'm probably the only person who is sick and tired of seeing Oprah try to steal the thunder from every single recent movie about the history of African Americans, this particular cinematographic opus is quite simply one of the finest portrayals of the horrific, cruel misdeeds committed against African Americans in the 20th century. While the movie smartly stays away from overly gory scenes that would have overshadowed the general story-telling, it nonetheless leaves you with a chill - and no amount of Hollywoodism can mask the reality behind it. I found myself actually gasping and crying while watching this movie - so horrified was I to think that there were (and, sadly, probably still are) people who not only see nothing wrong with judging a person based merely on the color of his/her skin but who would think themselves justified in causing such a person bodily harm without any provocation.

This movie captured for me not only the historical  events that took place in Selma, but brought a humanity to the characters not seen before in other films.

A great history lesson for the younger generations, and a reminder of the ugliness of those times, the bad politics of the time, the reluctance of the President to take an authoritative stand to end racism, and of the incredible bravery of those that took a stand. It is also a sad reminder of the illegal activities of the police and FBI against innocent protesters, some of which you can still see today. It was one of the defining moments in the Civil Rights movement. I was in college 90 miles from there, and I still remember some of those murders. I'm thankful the writers didn't gloss over the egregious actions of J. Edgar Hoover, George Wallace, the AL Highway Patrol, the local Sheriff, and many if not most of the white citizens involved.

6671885,5,B00NMF8SEK,This movie is amazing! Well written and directed. Depicts the troubles in the south that our country once struggled with.,1443139200,,121,5.1
6671886,5,B00NMF8SEK,"The film is historical since it deals with a very special episode of recent modern US history: the passing of the act on the right to vote for black people, which in fact was an act banning any kind of procedure that would prevent black people from registering as citizen to vote and run in elections. That act was finally passed in 1965 under President Johnson.

The film explores how that act came into being. Under the pressure of a strong peaceful movement organized and led by Martin Luther King Jr. in Selma, Alabama. The movement came from the local black people who had been organized by some young black people from Selma itself. Martin Luther King was only asked to come into the picture because the local people needed someone to go and speak to the President himself. And Martin Luther King had just receive the Nobel Peace Prize.

Johnson refused at first to deal with the voting problem of the blacks. He had more urgent business to run: his famous law on welfare and poverty and his war in Vietnam. King did not take no for an answer and he went to Selma to organize things with the locals. The reaction from the whites was superbly racist and violent. The governor, the famous Wallace, was entirely against changing traditions and he even asked the President to send troops or other forces to keep peace in the streets.

Johnson actually refused and Martin Luther King managed to get the attention of the national media. Then it was only a question of patience and endurance. They went to court to claim their right to peacefully demonstrate on a constitutional question like the right to vote written in black and white in the 13th and 14th amendment plus quite a few laws. The surprise came from the white judge who had to be a federal judge since it was a federal constitutional matter. The judge decided that the Blacks had the right to demonstrate to request the implementation of their federal constitutional right.

Then the battle was won. A massive demonstration was organized and the state of Alabama did not provoke any violence. Then within weeks the act about the matter was passed by Congress and signed by Johnson into law. This final demonstration enables the producers of the film to get history back on the screen with some of the TV coverage of the time in black and white.

This film is important historically, is well made and well acted. But this film is all the more important because it really starts with a bomb that kills four girls in their home. Thank you Ku Klux Klan! And the killing of a young demonstrator by a cop with his firearm. Thank you racist police and sheriff! This film was shot in 2014 and at the same moment in Ferguson, and then many other places a whole series of young male blacks were killed by police forces with their firearms or their physical brutality or lack of assistance to dying prisoners.

In other words in a way the film tells us history repeats itself if we do not keep up with the various issues encountered in life and make sure the solutions found now will hold later. This violence against young male blacks is typical of that necessity as much as typical of the vicious racism that is developing or that is cultivated in various local police forces in the USA, no matter what race these policemen or policewomen may be. They seem to believe that young male blacks are the inner enemy of the welfare of the nation, at least of their little patch of the nation.

As such, this mixture of history and present politics is a good point for a film on the subject.

A last thing has to be said. Martin Luther King Jr. was shown as a person who doubted a lot before coming to his decisions and actions. At times his decisions and actions were taken in some ritual way that lets us think he wanted us to believe he got in touch with God and got his advice. That attitude is surprising and yet is part of his prudence, a cautiousness that wants to be reassuring by being staged properly, that is to say with some religious dimension.

Hopefully someone will do it again and make a movie that fits the what actually happened better. If the actual story was not so strong I would have been bored and shut the movie off.

This movie brought him to life - centering around a key event in the Civil Rights era.  I've now read more about King, and am convinced Oyelowo got it right. He could not only motivate, but define a movement, embody it, get people's attention even to the President of the U.S., calm down extremists on both sides, and stay resolutely focused despite setbacks.  We even learn he was human and had some foibles.  Amazing that a man could live what we see here for the 13 years he was a leader.

Some of these friends organized the Selma March; one of them was sent into Selma long before the March was conceived.  When I watched the movie, it just did not seem to ring true.  There was a kind of phoniness about it.  Characters in the movie representing people I knew on a daily basis were nothing like the real deal.  They were like Stepford wives !  So I made some calls.  I asked my friends who had been on site way back then.  Brave, brave people who had been to jail, who had been  insulted, threatened, beaten. Whose lives were on the line.  Field staff people.
Well, my instincts were accurate.  I was merely disturbed.  My sources ranged from ballistic to ""I don't even want to talk about it; I'll just get upset."" I guess if you've been there and done that, the Hollywood treatment just doesn't set well in the stomach.",1441238400,35,984,4.418994413407821

A great history lesson for the younger generations, and a reminder of the ugliness of those times, the bad politics of the time, the reluctance of the President to take an authoritative stand to end racism, and of the incredible bravery of those that took a stand. It is also a sad reminder of the illegal activities of the police and FBI against innocent protesters, some of which you can still see today. It was one of the defining moments in the Civil Rights movement. I was in college 90 miles from there, and I still remember some of those murders. I'm thankful the writers didn't gloss over the egregious actions of J. Edgar Hoover, George Wallace, the AL Highway Patrol, the local Sheriff, and many if not most of the white citizens involved. It was an ugly time, and this movie is a good representation of it and the contributions of MLK and many other black leaders such as Rep. Lewis of GA.",1441152000,,979,4.536723163841808

I think that the 'story' was beautifully told and it was really heartwarming and at times gut wrenching.  There just was no super stellar acting performances. They all did their job well but no one moved me. I respect the job they did because it was good but it was not anything like Jared Leto in Dallas Buyers Club for example.  I like when you can't even find the guy you think you know like Bradly Cooper in American Sniper.  I didn't even recognize these guys.  In Selma I never forgot that it was that actor playing King.,1440460800,,681,4.322834645669292

6672025,1,B00NMF8SEK,"This was one of the slowest and most boring movies I have ever watched. Mississippi Burning is a million times better. This film is so freakingly slow, for example, Dr. King is on the bridge and stands with his people in front of the cops. Then he knees down, prays, then he turns around and walk away. I get that this happened in real life, but did they have to shoot it in real time as well? IT'S A FREAKING MOVIE! MOTION PICTURES! Those pictures need MOTION, otherwise it's like looking at a photograph.

Frankly, I don't know what the hell is happening to African-American films. I mean, the scene of King's wife confronting him about his adultery, another slow poke moment. Honestly, did they have an editor? Did they decide not to cut anything? Very disappointing.  Here's an idea, want to learn about King? Read a book. You'll learn far more than with this poor excuse of a movie. I have similar feelings about 10 Years A Slave, another disappointment.",1439337600,7,959,4.60233918128655

See David Oyelowo, Oprah, Common, and others make you feel that you are along with them back in 1960's Selma, MS. Though it discusses a sensitive subject of racial discrimination it does so in a mature, respectful way that I think people can appreciate. It respects the time and the viewer. It tells the story in a way that you won't feel uncomfortable while you watch but you aren't shielded from what was going on at the time the film portrays.

6672096,5,B00NMF8SEK,"I grew up in the Selma area as a pre-teen. My grandparents, uncles, cousins
and relatives are buried in the segregated
cemetery. This was and to some degree,
a VERY violent time. As a child Zina was
told not ever look into a white man or woman's face to insure they weren't offended,disrespected or felt threatened.
Murdering Black people was tantamount
to recreation or sport. Only God saw the
Black population three from day to day.
The movie was extremely accurate. We
should never forget the cruelty inflicted on
other human beings. The pets of whites even had a better life than the Black population of Selma. It rivals my hometown of Birmingham, Al.",1437782400,,655,4.754385964912281

The subject matter itself is compelling yet it has this 'drag its feet' feel to it on film.  Music can be used to create tension in an otherwise non-action film, but not even that is used well.  I think the story also contradicts some previously believed historical facts.  Is that the truth or what the fillmmaker wants us to believe (not stating due to spoilers)?

I still can't believe how much was never taught to us in our so called History books. Growing up in Chicago and going to an integrated school, I had no idea this kind of stuff was being experienced. Separate drinking fountains, sitting in certain places on the bus, not being served in restaurants, and so on. No one said that our black athletes or Hollywood stars had to stay in ""certain"" hotels.  As the 60's and 70's unfolded, I felt so stupid. Thank you to all the brave people who stood up against this oppression and torture. I am so sad more people did not have the right to be recognized as human beings. We seem to torture one group after another. When you have a loved one, hanging between life and death, the only thing that will save them is a blood transfusion, do you stop and ask if the blood is from a white person, black person, Asian or Hispanic, Middle eastern, Native American and so on?

He portrayed him as a regular man with regret, fear and doubt.  Maybe that's not what people want to see.  To me, he made the movie works.

The idea a human being is somehow less because of the color of their skin is completely preposterous. The one thing I struggled with this is movie was how LBJ was portrayed. Now to be fair, I am a huge Tom Wilkinson fan. I do not have a problem with the acting (although he is not the first person I would have in mind as LBJ). I feel the movie portrayed LBJ in a somewhat negative light at times when he was adamant about supporting the Civil Rights movement.

You see how the legacy of slavery has played out 100 years after the Civil War with Martin Luther King's frustrating, dangerous struggle to root out the stubborn, pervasive racism that permeated every facet of American life, especially in the South.  The facet that is explored here is the one that mattered most to Rev. King -- achieving non violent, equal access to a good education -- something whites took for granted, like going to a decent school, was a life or death struggle for a Black American.  You also see the hardball national politics of this struggle in the White House.

6672263,3,B00NMF8SEK,"A stirring film about an important event, but it's aim is hagiography of M L King.  To that end his rough edges are smoothed over and, more strikingly, he is portrayed as the leader of a unified African-American movement.  This requires some well-known distortions.  LB Johnson is presented as more antagonistic than he was.  Malcolm X appears here, shortly before his death, after having been in Africa, as King supporter, even if he will not say so publicly.  Notably, the large role that whites played in the organization and the march has been left out.  As a result, King's civil rights movement is assimilated to what was a black power movement very much opposed to working together with whites.  Indeed, the problem with King's movement was that it depended on the conscience of the large, mostly white society.  Even so, Selma and the resulting voting rights act were magnificent achievements that transformed America.",1436140800,,926,5.006535947712418

6672288,4,B00NMF8SEK,"I feel bad for Selma.  Initially intended for a 2015 release, the post-production was pushed through in a seemingly weak year and the hype machine built this film as the socially important film of the year and immediately the faith the studio had in its Awards chances started to seep into the prognosticators fingertips and, before it was shown to the world, it became the film to beat.  Then it was seen and reviewed and the response to the film was tepid, to say the least.  The social relevance was obviously seen and the importance of the message was heard loud and clear and yet, the film itself wasn't warmly embraced.  Then Oscar season heated up and the word racist started getting thrown around and the fight for this film became ugly, even though it had no chance to pull a win away from the two clear frontrunners.  When the nominations were announced, and Selma managed the BP nom anda Song nomination, the film in a way became a joke.  Its BP status was immediately questioned (no writing, directing, actingnot even a costume nod!) due to the fact that it was clear it wasn't really liked that much.  This was a case of we nominated you here because we had to and not a case of we think you were one of the best films of last year and because of that, Selma kind of has this stigma around it.

Like I said, I feel bad for Selma.  I was one of exploited that stigma after the nominations were announced.

Ive seen the film now (I hadnt seen it then) and at the end of the day, the fact remains that Selma was not one of the best films from 2014.

Its also not a joke, which is why the whole Oscar BP nom, in a way, hurts this movie.  If the film had just been regarded for what it was (or given the extra few months to hone and develop better and then been released, as intended, in 2015), then I think the film itself would have a better reputation.  Unfortunately, that didn't happen.

But enough about all that, lets talk about the movie.

Selma does not tell the life story of Martin Luther King, Jr.; it tells the story of the marches, led by King, in 1965 to fight for equal rights in Alabama.  Chronicling just a few months, the focus here is much tighter and direct than one may initially expect, and because of that the story told carries a heavier, more secure weight.  Biopics can be tricky when they attempt to cover too much ground, and so while I feel like Kings story deserves a complete film, I understand the decision to keep this story more centrally compact (and Spielberg has exclusive film rights to Kings entire story, I believe).

My issue with Selma is this; when the film has its lens off of the actual marches, it lags.

There is such intensity and brutality conveyed in those marches that the rest of the film cant compete.  It feels stuffy and longwinded and laborious, and so it starts to completely lose an audience, only to be shaken at its core by these electrified sequences of violence and injustice.  Im shocked at how monotone so many scenes felt, because the material really could have sustained the intensity or at least the energy if it had been handled better.  Instead, everything from the cinematography to the framing to the performances (Ejogo and Wilkinson aside) felt stilted and unmoving.  Even Oyelowo, who commanded those monologue moments, gets lost in a sea of mellow.

But those marching sequences are astonishingly well directed, crafted, framed and edited.

This is a shame to me, because this story is so socially important.  I wish that DuVernay had been allowed more time to edit and compose this film, for maybe with that extra time she could have compiled a film that felt for alive, but unfortunately the heartbeat of the film was lost in the finished product.  If the media circus had left this film alone, it would have skated through Oscar season without a single nomination and it may have been regarded as a handsomely mounted portrait of an important man, but the unfair criticisms heaped upon a voting body have tainted this film forever.

The biggest shame about all this is that Tom Wilkinsons scene stealing performance as Lyndon B. Johnson was soured by ridiculous controversy and thus excluded from the Awards race early on, since his performance is the best in the film and was truly deserving of any Oscar attention it could have received.",1435881600,,4326,4.554263565891473

6672291,5,B00NMF8SEK,"Selma is a historical drama that was based on the voting rights marches from Selma to Montgomery that was led by Dr. Martin Luther King,Jr together with James Bevel,Hoseal Williams and John Lewis. It provides us what transpired at the time during the Civil Rights Movement.

This movie chronicles the three-month period back in 1965 when Dr. Martin Luther King led a movements for the sake of equal voting rights at Alabama. He and his group initiated a walk from Selma to Montgomery to fulfill his vision of equal rights between blacks and whites in the country. It provided the viewer the events that transpired before,during and after the march as well as the effects that it had with regards to Dr. King's family life with the troubles it brought his wife for the movement that he is trying to initiate and the politics that he adheres to.

This was definitely one great historical drama as we get to see a well-told event of our history that is both factual and transparent. It does not favor liberal nor conservative politics. Added to that,it also does not sanitize Dr. Martin Luther,Jr. as we get to see the film on the good like his commitment to the Civil Rights Movement for the sake of his fellow African- Americans as well as the bad like the negative effects it has provided his wife,Coretta as well as the extra- marital affairs that he has engaged into. Aside from that,we also get to witness a balanced view of racism wherein non-colored people are guilty of it regardless of the politics that they believe in. Finally,the cast provided great acting.

6672350,5,B00NMF8SEK,"The film based upon a true story tells of 'Civil-Rights' leader and 'Baptist-Minister' 'Martin Luther King Jr' (David Oyelowa)
struggle to change the hearts and minds of a nation.
Though the 'Black-Americans' technically had the right to vote, many southern-regions in the main denied them the right to
do so.
'Dr King took his argument to Washington appealing face to face in the Oval Office to 'President Lyndon Johnson' to push
forward legislation to prevent authorities from denying 'Black-Americans' their right to vote.
The President insists he has listened but wants to put the issue on-hold at that time.
In Selma peaceful protest marches often ended in violence usually administered by the local authorities, leading to injuries
and often imprisonment.
The right to protest peacefully repeatedly thwarted.....eventually their voice is heard leading to the triumphant march from
'Selma' and holding a peaceful gathering in the capital of the State of Alabama - 'Montgomery'
Less than three years on, 'Martin Luther King' was murdered in Memphis Tennessee April 4th 1968 he was 39.
100 years earlier a Civil War was fought to abolish slavery.......
A tremendously moving and well portrayed drama with scenes of violence.
Good Picture and Sound Quality throughout.
Thoughts -
I wonder what 'Martin Luther King' would have made of 'Barack Obama' rising to the Top-Job.
Though racial tensions are still evident in many areas of America and indeed in the World at large.
I also wonder whether people 'Black' White' Yellow' or 'Brown' will one day stand face to face and only see a person and not a
colour..............'I HAVE A DREAM'

6672353,5,B00NMF8SEK,"Having been a teenager during this chaotic period, I was reminded how difficult we made the black peoples' need for inclusion and it certainly reminds us of a terrible time.  The acting was excellent and especially Martin Luther King Jr.  It was a soul searching for the viewer.  You could not
watch the horrors of a past time without being emotional.  I think it is a reminder that all people are created equal and colour does not change that.
It instilled in me my own beliefs in acceptance and inclusion of others regardless of age or colour.
I wonder if we Caucasians would have been as brave or as peaceful if we were in their shoes.

6672395,5,B00NMF8SEK,"This movie was simply remarkable. I cried within the first 5 minutes of watching it. For the first time, a movie showed the four little girls who were bombing victims as children having an average day at church on September 15, 1963. No one would have ever imagined that something horrific would happen to them. King was a complex man with a history of Civil Rights leadership that spanned for years. The director (Ava DuVernay) was smart enough to capture a slice of this time (i.e. from the girls' tragic loss to the voting rights act). This time period arguably tested King, the movement and country's commitment to freedom. She displayed the external and internal conflicts in a masterful way.

Pros:
- Director humanized Mr and Mrs King, the 4 bombing victims and other members of the civil rights movement
- David Ayellow embodied King's mannerism and speech pattern to perfection
- Carmen Ejogo looked EXACTLY like Mrs King
- Exposes a little known fact that Malcom X met with Mrs King
- Provided an alternative view of Lyndon B Johnson's motivation for participating in the civil movement (he still remains one of my favorite Presidents)
-  ""Glory"" song

Cons:
- Did not highlight Ralph Abernathy's contribution -- he was Dr. King's best friend and civil rights partner",1434067200,,1277,4.848623853211009

6672401,3,B00NMF8SEK,It was okay for me.  Excellent as far as history and movie making.  But  as far as the violence it was too graphic for me.  David Oyelowo put in a remarkable performance as MLK.  I would like to see a movie where Oprah isn't hitting someone upside the head for once because she has so much more personality in her acting than that.,1433980800,,331,4.190476190476191

6672404,5,B00NMF8SEK,"This movie was not overly dramatic yet it painfully allowed you to peek into the depth of emotions and uncertainty MLK lived through while He led a nation of people into what often times were brutally tragic outcomes all while he sat tucked away in the safety of his office. Being able to feel through the imagery the gut wrenching questions that must have filled his mind....am I leading these people into their deaths for a cause that will never be won? Am I misleading myself in this quest for equality?  How long will this take? Should I fold? The viewers knowing that at every wrong turn, he lived those questions over and over again and undoubtedly carried a huge burden for every painful blow suffered by his followers. And with all  of this he had to stand against the internal forces against him within his own organization. Just writing this, I am living what he must have felt all over again.",1433980800,,903,4.567901234567901

The only one stopping me was my husband, who has more patience than I do, and we just talked through most of it as it ran in the background. The photography is fantastic, but that's about it. It could have been tightened to about 1.5 hours at most, and I think that would have helped. I saw it only a week ago, and can barely remember any particular scene, but do remember that my impression was that it should have been a play, and not a dramatic film.  It was so slow, but sped up a tad towards the end. The script was not great, and the lead actor did not have an inch of inspiration of MLK. Disappointed.",1433894400,3,780,4.125

I wasn't though, ever educated about the struggle depicted here. I learned about the civil rights struggle in school and understood what the movement's purpose was however until I watched this movie at 42 years of age did I begin to understand what this struggle really meant. I have a new level of insight and respect for what therdr truly amazing and inspiring American's accomplished thanks to this movie. Yes it is a good movie with fine acting and storytelling, I found it entertaining and well constructed and executed. I found this to be the case with many movies on Amazon. This movie for me though transcended and made superficial those hallmarks of good movie making. Selma allowed me to experience a small window of this struggle. It showed me what great men and woman can do and accomplish, even in the face of overwhelming cruelty and bigotry. Every American needs to watch this movie. MLK and those in his movement, accomplished something should be exalted as a example of greatness and perseverance. What they accomplished is equal in my opinion what the founders of this country accomplished  They are what is great about America,",1433462400,5,1305,4.8

6672483,3,B00NMF8SEK,"This film is probably okay if you don't know what happened.  But if you do know what happened, you can see that history was distorted - and not in a more dramatic, more Hollywood way.  It was simplified so the events are easy to follow, but the changes make the story less interesting.  The whole drama was reduced to a psychodrama between Martin Luther King and Lyndon Johnson.  Almost all of the conflict between SNCC and SCLC and between Sheriff Clark and Public Safety Director Wilson Baker was deleted.  These conflicts were mentioned, but not enough.  It seemed as if the director knew that he had to include these conflicts, so he did include them but then got back to King.

Famous speeches were changed to make them less dramatic.  Johnson's ""We shall overcome"" speech was changed so it lost much of its impact.  King's ""Now is the time"" speech at the end of the march was changed so ""The arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice"" was not included.  On the other hand, the beating on the bridge, on March 7, 1965, was done well.  The final march to Montgomery was done well because it featured original news footage.

The film had entirely too many scenes of angst - where the actors pause and reflect on the inhumanity of it all.  More action would have been more dramatic and more accurate.

The most important problem with the film is that it made Martin Luther King the main person in the Selma movement.  He was important, but he was not at the center.  This film will contribute to the mistaken belief that the Civil Rights Movement was King's movement.

If you want to know what happened in Selma, watch Episode 6 of Eyes of the Prize, ""Bridge to Freedom.""",1433203200,146,1693,4.516447368421052

6672499,3,B00NMF8SEK,"The movie was good.  It portrayed MLK for all whom he was - a real person who had talents, fears, and failings like the rest of us, which was great to see, and I do think the film should have received more accolades from the Oscars than it did.  However, MLK was a calm man, and Oscars usually don't go to characters who are absent of emotional outbursts.  With that said, I do think that if the film had been done with more suspense, the reservedness of his character could have been elevated to Oscar worthy status.  Overall, the movie told an incredible story in a way that felt disconnected for the viewer.  All of the prejudice and racial hated, both the obvious and the subtle, could have been better displayed to have more clearly showed the tremendous amount of strength that it took for MLK to lead a non-violent protest.  It also wasn't clear why he turned back on that bridge on the day that he didn't lead them all the way across it.  The viewer was left to guess his reasoning for that.  Speaking of guessing, I wish the film had finished by showing Annie Lee Cooper (played by Oprah) from the beginning finally being able to register to vote.  That would have been a great way to end the film.  In sum, the writing and directing did not do justice to this incredible piece of our American history.",1432944000,11,1311,4.402489626556017

6672638,3,B00NMF8SEK,"Since none of the speeches were actually Martin Luther King, Jr. speeches, the credibility of what was said is questionable. If you're prevented from quoting his speeches exactly, why fake them? Also, the song, ""Glory"" would not please Dr. King. He was a pacifist. And including the ""hands up"" reference (which has been proven to be a fabrication) was really unnecessary and seemed to be added as an after thought and not relevant to the story. Gave 3 stars because most of the acting was good. The actual footage from the time was helpful to keep the story somewhat honest.",1432080000,3,574,4.75
6672639,5,B00NMF8SEK,"How did this movie not win all of the awards? Seriously, the acting in Selma was incredible and moving, not just because of the subject matter. The performances of David Oyelowo, Carmen Ejogo, and Lorraine Toussaint stood out most for me. They fully embodied these roles with grace and talent so that there was difficulty imagining historical figures differently from how they were portrayed.

I thought the movie was also well-written. I know some of what was written came from the historic speeches of Martin Luther King, Jr., so he gets some of the kudos on that. But the writing in between speeches and protests, in the private moments of this public figure's life, were written  eloquently & respectfully.

The writing also managed to not only show the past inequalities, but to show that intolerance, excessive force, police brutality, and oppression go on now. That the equality that King fought so hard for and gave his life to achieve is still fragile in some cases, and nonexistent in others. We have come so far, but still have a ways to go.

I did feel that there were some issues in the production--the sound and editing didn't feel up to par with the acting & writing. There were also some little goofs (like that you could get from Atlanta to Selma in a couple of hours in the mid-60s), but goofs happen in most movies. It isn't perfect, but it's pretty close.",1432080000,,1375,4.6929460580912865

6672695,5,B00NMF8SEK,"With my keen interest in historical and biographical dramas, the movie ""Selma"" was a natural for me to want to see. I recently watched it through Amazon Instant Video, and came away very impressed. ""Selma"" is an altogether brilliant film that features standout performances by David Oyelowo as Martin Luther King, Jr., Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King, Tom Wilkinson as President Lyndon B. Johnson, Oprah Winfrey as Annie Lee Cooper, Tessa Thompson as Diane Nash, and Andre Holland as Andrew Young, as well as many others.

""Selma,"" superbly directed by Ava DuVernay, tells how Martin Luther King led the African American fight to secure equal voting rights through a series of highly publicized, non-violent marches in Selma, Alabama in the early months of 1965, culminating in a 50-mile march from Selma to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.  ""Selma"" shows how King was able to first overcome the resistance of leaders within the Civil Rights movement, as well as the opposition of U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson.

Key scenes in the film include the killing of protestor Jimmie Lee Jackson by an Alabama state trooper; the civil rights marchers' first attempt to march from Selma to Montgomery, which resulted in state and local police, using heavy riot gear, making an unprovoked attack on unarmed demonstrators at the Edmund Pettus Bridge (an event known as ""Bloody Sunday"");  the murder of civil rights activist James Reeb by a mob of local segregationists; and two subsequent attempts by civil rights activists to march from Selma to Montgomery.

""Selma's"" historical accuracy has been the source of some controversy, mainly from the way it portrays the relationship between King and Johnson as being confrontational. A key Johnson political appointee maintains to this day that the protests planned for Selma were Johnson's, and not King's, idea. Witnesses to a meeting between King and Johnson insist that no argument between the two ever took place.

DuVernay maintains that her film is accurate, saying that ""...the notion of  the Selma protests being Johnson's idea was 'jaw-dropping and offensive' to African Americans and veterans of the Civil Rights movement."" Even if discussions between King and Johnson had become heated, I seriously doubt that King would have spoken to the President with the level of intensity (bordering on insolence) that's depicted in the film. Despite this controversy, I think ""Selma"" maintains a pretty good degree of historical accuracy, taking into consideration the need to compress and alter some events for the sake of a two-hour film. I certainly came away from watching ""Selma"" having a strong feeling for what the times must have been like in the Deep South of the mid-1960s.

I enjoyed ""Selma"" tremendously, and have now watched it several times. (I now own a digital copy of the film through Amazon Instant Video.) It's one of the few films that I think is good enough to take an honored place in my Blu-ray collection as well. Most highly recommended.",1431820800,6,3009,5.1016260162601625

Director Ava Duvernay and Writer Paul Webb apparently believed they were making a documentary, for PBS/BBC---but somebody obviously forgot to tell them it was instead going into movie theaters. They needed to format it for these viewers instead.

FBI 'information items' appear across the screen sporadically/quickly. But because they are so tiny and so quick, it would have been better to either integrate the FBI surveillance into the screenplay more thoroughly, or leave out the writing on screen all together. Most people now know King had been under surveillance. Tucking in information about his affairs and the problems it had on his marriage for 'dramatic' effect' did not add anything to the screenplay--and should have been left out. Save it for a movie about King's life itself.",1431734400,2,1034,5.148809523809524

To me it did not matter so much about the historical accuracy, because in film, as in fiction, there is room for interpretation and what has come to be know as artistic license. This film was more about a feeling, a movement, a moment in time. If you want the facts, go seek a biography or a book of the history of the Selma march and Voting Rights Act. This was a story told from a perspective that few of us have experienced, and shared among us with great love and joy of a greater truth that facts or realism could ever deliver. See it and experience a piece of American history.

The cast led by David Oyelowo (impressive as Martin Luther King, Jr.) is brilliant! The directing by Ava DuVernay (who also executive produced) is brilliant. The story & screenplay by Paul Webb is brilliant.

The cinematography by Bradford Young is brilliant. The music by Jason Moran is brilliant. The film editing by Spencer Averick is brilliant. The casting by Aisha Coley is brilliant. The production design by Mark Friedberg is brilliant. The art direction by Kim Jennings is brilliant. The set decoration by Elizabeth Keenan, set dressings by Sam Carter, Daryl Farrie, Jason Barr, Rob Dickerson, Jr., John Johnson, Jr., Mike Ellison, Marcus Cooley, Nick Gjoka & Daniel F. Simmons is brilliant. The costume design by Ruth E. Carter is brilliant. The special effects coordinated by Caius Man is brilliant. The visual effects coordinated by Karina Benesh, Justin Tatsuo Chan, Bryan Godwin, Chase Handley & Yasodha Rai, supervised by Anup Shakya, Scott Farrar, Grady Cofer, Dottie Starling & Susan MacLeod is brilliant. The stunts coordinated by Stephen A. Pope & Jeremy Sample is brilliant. The special make-up effects by Bill Myer is brilliant.

This is a brilliant, well-crafted, well-made film that is entertaining, impressive and superb. David Oyelowo gives a career-defining performance as Martin Luther King, Jr. & the supporting cast led by Tom Wilkinson (superb as President Lyndon B. Johnson), Carmen Ejogo (solid as Coretta Scott King), Tim Roth (also solid as George Wallace) & Oprah Winfrey (who also produced) (great as Annie Lee Cooper) is just as brilliant. Ava DuVernay has made her career-defining film (so far) with Selma. This is (or was) one of the best films of the last holiday (Christmas 2014) season and one of the best films of last year, as well, too. This is (or was) also an impressive awards contender, for the awards that it won and had been nominated for, despite not receiving the major number of Oscar nominations that it had (or does) deserve, just receiving the Best Picture nomination and winning for Best Original Song, ""Glory"" by John Legend & Common (who had a role in the movie as James Bevel) and not receiving the Best Actor & Director nominations that it should have received.",1430870400,,2409,5.047738693467337
6672852,4,B00NMF8SEK,"By the end of this film I was filled with remorse that Selma and David Oyelowo did not receive nominations for the Academy Awards. Once again, the powers are trying to show their force.

Oyelowo, as you know plays Dr Martin Luther King, and in this film he is planning the marches for the black vote. He meets with President Lyndon Johnson many times, and finally with the multiple beatings of the black men and women, and the addition of many whites people who join the King marches, Lyndon Johnson realizes he can no longer take his time. He comes to the realization that the people he has promised to protect, do not have their rights and are being beaten and killed. Finally.

It takes a long time for action, and as we know Martin Luther King did not have much time. Tbe acting in this film is extraordinary. By the end of the film, tears were streaming down my face. The history I heard about has come to life. Paid, I am so angry at the powers that be, that no Oscars were given to this film. Yes, I know they won for the music, but that is not enough.

It felt as though the movie was a bit rushed. My favorite part in the movie was when Dr. King was writing a letter to Coretta and he was smoking a cigarette. I loved this, because it showed us that he, too, had flaws, but was charged to lead the movement. Overall, it  serves as a great supplementary piece in support of understanding the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the sole purpose of the Civil Rights movement. Davis was exceptional. There were times, when I actually though he was Dr. King. This is a great movie to watch with family and friends. It is definitely worthy of conversation.",1430697600,,749,4.427536231884058

I felt the hesitation, the burden, the emotions played across his face. That was a heck of a scene. But I feel this way, if you ever feel lax on voting when you should, then sit down and watch this movie and remember the time when some of us in this country couldn't. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

6672894,5,B00NMF8SEK,"While glancing over the reviews of the movie, American Sniper, I saw the term ""Patriot"" used many times. I won't question the patriotism of the focus of that film, but we would be remiss if we did not at least equally shower it upon the focus of this film. As MLK pointed-out many times in this film, at that time, we had the courage to send troops to Vietnam to defend freedom abroad but not to ensure freedom for Americans at home. There are few, if any, other individuals who did more to ensure freedom for the people of this country than MLK.

This film shows his true spirit and the depth of his character. It portrays his internal conflict between achieving the greater goals of equality and risking the lives of all those fighting for freedom. This movie gave us a glimpse into this great man's soul and his struggles. It depicted a man who understood the times and his mission. And he deeply felt the cost of his convictions.

A few commenters have disparaged the film because they felt Oyelowo's portrayal of MLK was stiff and unemotional. I thought that to be a true reflection of MLK himself and of the social/emotional conservatism of the time. Oyelowo did not entirely mimic MLK, nor did the movie focus on MLK's most public moments, which was a prudent choice. For one, it is difficult to recreate the motivational style of MLK for which he was most widely known.. So, Oyelowo and the filmmakers instead showed MLK in his more private moments when he was tired and unsure, which is a departure from his public persona.

The movie was powerful and poignant.  As I watched, I grieved for the people who died and were beaten for simply being a part of this movement. I marveled at the restraint all of those involved called upon to remain peaceful after so many years of violence and abuse. My heart was on the bridge will all of those patriots, with all of those defenders of freedom, as it is with those in Ferguson and Cleveland and New York today.",1429833600,2,1962,4.51830985915493

LBJ is also on record as having used the vaunted N-word more frequently than any 10 other presidents combined. He was a vile racist with murder in his past.

6672901,3,B00NMF8SEK,"Selma is an account of the three-month period in the mid-1960s during which Martin Luther King, Jr. (David Oyelowo) spearheaded a campaign to secure equal voting rights for black people in Alabama against often violent opposition.

Though, technically, every American was entitled to vote, Southern officials regularly made it extremely difficult for blacks to register. In literacy tests they were often asked complicated or obscure questions that were nearly impossible to answer. Sometimes a poll tax was charged that poorer folks could not afford. In addition, those who attempted to sign up had their names and addresses published in the newspaper, making retribution easy.

King met with President Lyndon Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) to press for laws to eliminate such abuses. As depicted in the film, Johnson puts off Kings requests, citing bigger priorities, particularly the war on poverty, and urging a more relaxed road to a voting rights bill.

King is shown as a strategist who understands the power of television to shock the nation with the violence inflicted on innocent folks standing up for their rights. He knows these TV images and press coverage of white officials intimidating, beating, and brutalizing black people who want only to exercise their Constitutional right to vote will shame the country and the President to act sooner rather than later.

Other issues touched on include the FBIs wiretapping and checking into Kings background in an attempt to dig up some dirt against him. We also hear Johnson say he would prefer to deal with King rather than more radical black activists such as Malcolm X. Politics plays a major role as the struggle climaxes in 1965 with a planned march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama.

For a movie that deals with such fiery issues, Selma is a curiously cold movie. Director Ava DuVernay establishes the period well and covers differing points of view, but never succeeds in transforming the Martin Luther King, Jr., of the textbooks into a human being. We see him nobly, wisely professing what he hopes to achieve, calming impatient, angry followers, and foreseeing what paths his actions lead to. But only once do we glimpse the private man, when he has to answer accusations of womanizing to wife, Coretta (Carmen Ejogo).

Mr. Oyelowo is fine in the scenes of King working with his team, speaking with the President, and planning strategies. But in the rare intimate moments, he never conveys the sense that King is baring his soul. This makes for a pretty stodgy, if historically interesting, movie.

A highlight of the film is the March 1965 face-off  on a bridge leading from Selma  between the peaceful demonstrators and heavily armed local police and state troopers. As the confrontation eventually erupts into violence, news cameras capture the chaos. Nightly news broadcasts show viewers here in America and abroad what the peaceful demonstrators are facing. It rallies the country, attracting supporters, both white and black, from around the nation.

As an adjunct to lessons in school about the civil rights struggle, Selma is a vivid portrayal of the courage of ordinary people to stand together peacefully and demand what the law guarantees, when actual danger to life and limb was a day-to-day reality. Rated PG-13, the movie is effective in showing how Kings goal was reached, but less successful in providing an in-depth look at a complex individual.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include deleted and extended scenes, Glory music video, commentary by director Ava DuVernay and David Oyelowo, and two making-of, behind-the-scenes featurettes.",1427846400,43,3629,5.175767918088737

First, my recollection was the SNCC was formed partly by white students, mostly from the Northeast, but not entirely.  SNCC was not entirely an African-American creation or phenomenon.  It would have been nice to have some acknowledgement of that.

Second, were there *any* decent white people in the South then?  Don't seem to be, if this movie is a reflection of reality.  Sure, a few high level liberal politicians in DC.  But any real Americans, working people, in the South, who were not violent racists?

I don't question that there were plenty of brutal neanderthals, as portrayed in the movie.  I grew up in the deep South, and literally lived around this stuff as a child.  I was taken to Klan rallies when I was elementary school age.  I've seen cross burnings and men in white robes.  I don't question that reality.

6672910,4,B00NMF8SEK,"""Selma"" is 90% of a great film.  It tells the true story of a three month period in 1965 when Martin Luther King, Jr. led his famous march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama to secure equal voting rights against violent opposition.  The period is skillfully recreated, generally knowing exactly what to center the drama on, wisely much more than on King himself but on the entire community and how so many came together to alter history.

In spite of the film's impact (especially in the violent scenes between the police and the protesters) and some great performances, the script by Paul Webb inserts a fictitious clash between King and President Lyndon Johnson in order to add a conflict to the film. This has drawn much criticism but, more than doing a disservice to LBJ (who reportedly did not impede putting forward the voting rights bill), it also reveals that Webb and director DuVernay did not feel there was enough dramatic conflict inherent in the story without it.  One can legitimately argue either way, but in my opinion it would have been better to further emphasize the interaction of all the participants more without 'hyping' the LBJ conflict.  Even if the film had been less 'dramatic' in a classical sense it would have been more accurate as well as effective.  Still, this film is a must-see and a significant document of a crucial time in the history of America.",1424995200,2,1383,4.7899159663865545

Even though the Civil Rights Act of 1964 has been passed, African Americans are still struggling for voting equality.

When a group of African American's decide to March from Selma to Montgomery Alabama in order to raise awareness they are attacked and beaten. Left with no other option Martin Luther King decides to join in the next march while President Johnson and Governor Wallace are stuck in the middle of the ethical debate. Before I watched this movie all I heard about was how it was snubbed by the Oscars for Actor and Director. ""How can a movie only be up for best picture and nothing else?"" I went in with that mindset. After watching this I have to say I agree with the nomination. The movie is very good and very much worth seeing. The pacing of the movie was very jerky though. Just when the movie becomes tense it begins to slow down and loses the momentum it had going for it. Oyelowo did a really good job playing Dr. King, but he seemed to lack passion in the speeches and it felt like he was trying to just re-create what he watched the real Dr. King do. On the other hand though, when you are playing someone that iconic you are more or less not trying to screw it up and the tenseness of playing Dr. King really showed. All of that said though the movie is very good and I do recommend it. Overall, this is one of the better movies of the year, but it wasn't as good as I hoped it would be.

6672920,5,B00NMF8SEK,"The sheer fearlessness that David Oyelowo brings to his performance in Selma is something that cant be rivaled by anything else Ive seen this year. He doesnt simply mimic, he embodies, and inhabits his role as Martin Luther King Jr. magnificently. Any reservations that I may have had about the film went out the door seconds after it began. Its a movie that spellbinds from beginning to end and is competently crafted in a way that most biographical pictures arent.

But then again, its not really a biography. It doesnt aim to cover the whole life of an individual. In fact, it only focuses on one key aspect of it. In this case, that happens to be Kings crusade to procure equal voting rights through his march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama in 1965. What we see is the inner workings of that, the trials and tribulations that King and his many supporters are faced with. And one of the main strong points is the way each event is handled, in a way that never feels as if its holding back. What we see on the screen isn't far off from the actual events, and thats the way it should be, especially when you're dealing with an issue this huge.

Oyelowo presents a robust, nuanced performance and works perfectly alongside each of the other actors (another notable one being Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King). Its an ensemble if Ive ever seen one - with character actor after character actor - all fantastic. And it moves with a natural fluidity that grabs the viewer and emotionally attaches them until the final scene. Its nothing short of exceptional and is easily one of the best in this years Oscar-race. Its a shame that Oyelowo was snubbed for a Best Actor nomination, he more than deserves it.",1423353600,34,1706,4.590163934426229
6672921,5,B00NMF8SEK,"The civil rights movement that galvanized people of all ages, races, colors, creeds, and religions in the America of the 1960s was one of the most important parts of our history; and at the head of all this was the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King.  Even after the Montgomery bus boycott of 1955-56, and the March on Washington in 1963, black churches in the segregated South were still being bombed; black people were still being lynched; and voting rights were still being denied to those who were neither White nor possessed of enough money.  Meanwhile in Washington, even with the Civil Rights Act having been passed, President Lyndon Johnson was still vacillating over the issue of voting rights.  To get the point across to Johnson that this was a moral issue, Dr. King and his people organized what became the Selma-to-Montgomery march in March 1965.  That event and the things that led up to it are at the heart of director Ava DuVernay's powerful 2014 historical docudrama SELMA.

SELMA begins with one of the aforementioned church bombings that characterized the White Southern backlash against the civil rights movement following the killings of three Voting Rights workers in August 1964, and follows the efforts of Dr. King (portrayed here by David Oleyowo) as he attempts to organize a big event that would galvanize the nation.  Even as he does this, with help from his wife Coretta (Carmen Ejogo), he is constantly being dogged by hostile forces--in a covert way from the machinations of FBI chieftain J. Edgar Hoover (Dylan Baker), and in a more overt and violent way from Alabama governor George Wallace (Tim Roth) and Dallas County sheriff Jim Clark (Stan Houston), plus the brutality from the white segregationists and Ku Klux Klansmen.  And there is the issue of Oleyowo's infidelity towards Ejogo at this crucial time in his life and in the life of the movement that he is leading.  But once he goes through all these elements, he remains resolute, even through the attempts by Johnson (Wilkinson) to have Oleyowo stop the movement (and supposedly stop the violence), Selma soon becomes the new epicenter of King's quest for equality.  It comes at a bloody cost, first with the Bloody Sunday incident on March 7th, and then the KKK-administered beating of one of King's white supporters just a night or two later.  None of this deters Oleyowo's quest, however; and on March 21st, he and 8,000 of his fellow citizens, black, white, Jewish, gentile, Protestants, and Catholics alike, make the 50-mile march from Selma, across the infamous Edmund Pettis Bridge, and through two very dangerous Alabama counties to the state capital in Montgomery to press the case.

While it can be said that we have made incredibly great strides to get away from the overt bigotry of the past, even with an African-American in the White House at the time of its release, SELMA depicts a time in our history that, though long past, is still relevant today.  Racism and bigotry are always going to be parts of certain Americans' DNA, especially since the nation, in the 21st century, is becoming much more ethnically diversified and less White.  But it was not always so in Dr. King's time, when blacks often made up the majority of rural counties in the South, but only constituted maybe two percent of the eligible voting population, hemmed in as they were by regulations drawn up by segregationists.  Both director DuVernay and screenwriter Webb depict this in very stark fashion, with Oleyowo giving a very stoic performance as the great Dr. King, and Ejiogo equally fine as his wife Coretta.  Wilkinson and Roth do very good turns as, respectively, the old guard LBJ and the uber-segregationist Wallace.  SELMA also features good turns from Cuba Gooding Jr. as one of the young lawyers arguing the case for the march, and Martin Sheen as the Alabama judge who, though perhaps more covert in his racial views, grants the order allowing the march to go forth.

Having seen this film in a theater on Martin Luther King Day in 2015, it made me appreciate even more than I had before how big a part of the mid-to-late 20th century the civil rights movement was in America, at a time when we were going through the most turbulent period in our history since the end of the Civil War; and the lessons from that period are still being absorbed, even though more Americans of non-White ethnicity have entered the political arena in our time.  In that sense, SELMA, along with the classic 1970 documentary KING: A FILMED RECORD...MONTGOMERY TO MEMPHIS, will likely become required viewing in years to come in high school, community college, and university classes.  While we have made great strides, America as a ""more perfect union"" is still a work in progress, and SELMA, one of the best films of 2014, illustrates why this is still true even in the 21st century.",1422921600,2,4859,4.853688029020557

6672923,1,B00NMF8SEK,"LBJ was one of the greatest advocates for Civil Rights for every American. Yes, MLK got the ball rolling, but LBJ was the biggest proponent for passing a Voting Rights Act. If you look at any PBS documentary on LBJ, you'll see that LBJ wanted to put an end to the demonstrations from day one. LBJ had his hands tied, because he didn't have legal authority. He said to George Wallace ""We shouldn't be thinking about 1964, we should be thinking about 1984, and we'll all be good and dead by then"". LBJ wanted to be remembered as somebody who ""did good"" for his Great Society. LBJ persuaded George Wallace to protect the marchers with the National Guard. LBJ was demonized in this film as apathetic, but the truth is that he wanted justice for the all Americans from the beginning of his Presidency. He then gave his speech ""We Shall Overcome"". 5 days later after passing the Voting Rights Act, Watts erupted in violence by African American demonstrators who made fun of LBJ, and claimed they wanted Black Power. To LBJ, this seemed like a slap in the face. This film was historically inaccurate, and the producers should be ashamed of themselves for leaving the truth out of this film, especially the inaccuracies of LBJ. To me, it seemed more agenda driven than anything else. Without President LBJ, there wouldn't have been a Voting Rights Bill, and there wouldn't have been a Voting Rights Act. MLK would have been quickly forgotten, and voting rights may have never changed for the American Black.

  This movie is just another slap in the face to President LBJ. Both MLK and LBJ as a TEAM changed voting rights. I'm forced to believe that this movie is agenda driven, and it's clear the agenda of the movie was to minimize the importance of a President because he was white (or wasn't black), instead of giving credit where credit is due. The producers of this movie are dishonest, and one should question ""WHY?"". Was it more entertaining to show that LBJ had a conflict with MLK (when none existed)?

History matters, and should not be distorted, especially on a sensitive topic as this.

I left a link to a PBS documentary in the comments section to cite everything I explained in this review.

Edit 2/8/15: Many will view this movie as factual, and it's real sad just to display a ""FAKE"" conflict/solution scenario regarding LBJ just to make a profit at the box office. I'd like for everyone that thumbs down my post also do some research on Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner. These were 2 Jewish ""WHITES"" that were murdered for the cause of racial equality. MLK recognized them, and gave speeches recognizing them, but this FUBU (for us by us) director claims she didn't want to make a ""white savior"" movie.

In the days after receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, Martin Luther King Jr. (David Oyelowo) decides to use his clout to establish voting rights for blacks who have been systematically disenfranchised and intimidated, using the town of Selma as his battleground.

What did I think?

Its almost as if the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr. himself came down from the heavens to inhabit the body of Oyelowo for this performance. The fact that he missed out on an Oscar nomination for this is frankly astounding. Selma is a searing and engaging portrayal of a pivotal time in the fight for civil rights that highlights how far we've come at the same time as declaring nothings changed.

On a side note, I would love to see a poignant movie with a black cast that DIDN'T revolve around race and/or slavery. Can Hollywood do that, yet?",1422403200,3,842,4.668918918918919
6672929,2,B00NMF8SEK,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Director Ava DuVernay has mainly been criticized for her depiction of President Johnson as being a reluctant or obstructionist political actor. DuVernay was quoted as saying that she wasn't interested in making a ""white savior movie,"" perhaps implying that Johnson has been given too much credit for his role in the civil rights movement. DuVernay admits that not everything in ""Selma"" is historically accurate, but she's entitled to fictionalize events under the rubric of ""dramatic license.""

Indeed, the most compelling scenes in the film appear to be those involving Johnson's political machinations. DuVernay would like to us to believe that King and Johnson's relationship was much more confrontational than it was. Joseph Califano Jr., a former LBJ top assistant for domestic affairs, points to a recorded phone conversation between King and LBJ on January 15, 1965 in which LBJ appeared to be much more constructive than confrontational.

However, DuVernay attempted to justify her portrayal of LBJ as a reluctant actor, citing a 2013 article by Louis Menand in ""The New Yorker."" Menand maintained that Johnson was not proactive after progress toward getting the Voting Rights Act passed had slowed: ""Johnson had the most ambitious legislative agenda of any President since F.D.R. (his idol), and he explained to King that he was worried that Southern opposition to more civil-rights legislation would drain support from the War on Poverty and hold up bills on Medicare, immigration reform, and aid to education. He asked King to wait. King thought that if you waited for the right time for direct action (as nonviolent protests were called) you would never act.""

In DuVernay's best scene, LBJ finally ""comes around"" and tells off George Wallace face to face. What's so great about this scene is how LBJ attempts to appeal to Wallace on his level, even employing the ""N"" word to show Wallace that he's just a ""good old boy"" at heart. But when Wallace won't listen to reason, LBJ makes it clear that the days of the Old South are numbered.

DuVernay undoubtedly would have liked Johnson to come around sooner and attempts to slightly steal his thunder in his famous ""We Shall Overcome"" speech by having him speak before a sparsely populated House of Representatives (Bill Moyers insists that the chamber was completely packed and LBJ's speech was ""electric"").

The rest of ""Selma"" is pretty much in part, a by the numbers hagiography. DuVernay chose David Oyelowo, a British actor who starred in her earlier feature, ""Middle of Nowhere,"" to play Martin Luther King Jr. Oyelowo is sadly miscast playing King as a grim-faced, stoic preacher, failing to convey a shred of King's warmth or humanity. For those who wish to see the definitive portrait of King, they can find it by viewing the 1978 TV Miniseries: ""King"", starring the sensational Paul Winfield. There is no comparison between the two performances and one can find the entire Winfield miniseries on Youtube under the films of Paul Winfield.

DuVernay is more successful when she sticks to straightforward historical events. There's a compelling scene when Oprah Winfrey as Annie Lee Cooper is rebuffed by a racist clerk when she attempts to register to vote at the county courthouse. Coretta Scott King has little to do in ""Selma"" so I suppose her meeting with a seemingly muted Malcolm X proves to be her character's most exciting scene. The revelation that King was still miffed by Malcolm X's earlier claim that he was an ""Uncle Tom,"" also proves to be quite fascinating. The two confrontations with the racist police in Selma are competently done, but I can't help once again recommending the Winfield miniseries, as the police-protester clashes there, seem more realistic.

Except for a memorable confrontation where Andrew Young talks down a vengeful crowd of dispirited King demonstrators, the ""supporting players"" simply don't stand out. This is particularly evident when King is greeted by his staff at the safe house in Selma (by the way, this is about the only time you see Oyelowo smile during the entire movie).

Eschewing a ""warts and all"" approach, DuVernay puts her MLK on a pedestal. There's little hint of the ""family man"" or charismatic leader. DuVernay unfortunately was hampered (stymied if you will) by the King family, who always demand financial remuneration whenever any of his speeches are used in fictional portraits such as ""Selma."" DuVernay paraphrased King's speeches, but little of it sounds spoken by the great man!

Adolph Reed Jr. of the University of Pennsylvania implies that DuVernay ""inscribes a monolithic and trans-historical racism as the fundamental obstacle confronting, and thus uniting, all black Americans."" One can't but help note that DuVernay believes that there's a continuity between the protests of the civil rights era and the recent protests in Ferguson. While the Civil Rights Era was a monumental and seminal part of American history, to equate Martin Luther King's non-violent movement with the events that occurred in Ferguson, seems absurd. To my mind, MLK probably would have rolled over in his grave had he seen the pathetic and self-destructive acts by those who were caught on camera rioting in Ferguson.

Even though murders of blacks by police are statistically extremely low, media exposure has convinced many people that this happens all the time. While African-Americans were true victims of endemic racism until the Civil Rights Movement of the 60s, the cries of victimhood today, especially in regards to ""police brutality."" are not clear-cut. Some police may be outwardly racist as well as ""heavy-handed"" or ""insensitive."" But recent events have also proved that some African-Americans intentionally provoke the police, leading to tragic overreactions.",1422316800,18,5832,5.1804670912951165

6672931,5,B00NMF8SEK,"I really loved this movie, and I say this while being a harsh movie critic.  It was well written, well acted, and well directed.  I loved the dialogue, the pacing, and the framing of each scene.  Ava DuVernay did such a great job.  I definitely though it was a Oscar worthy effort on her part.

The movie was both entertaining and insightful.  I definitely urge everyone to see this film.

I thought David Oyelowo did a great job as MLK.  His portrayal was brilliant.  He really stepped into the role and became MLK.

My only minor complaint is that I felt like there wasn't much character development beyond the main protagonist and antagonists.  I'll have to watch the movie again to know for sure but I initially felt like I didn't get to know some characters.

The thing I appreciate the most about this movie is how it stressed the tactics used by King and the SCLC.  Specifically, I love this quote:

""The way our organization works is simple. We negotiate, we demonstrate, we resist. We raise white consciousness. And in particular, the consciousness of whichever white man happens to be sitting in the Oval Office."" - MLK

King used the violence and maltreatment of others (local police, etc.) to raise consciousness and invoke tangible changes to the laws and to the status quo.  This contrasts greatly with many protests we see today that often struggle to identify tangible goals while often succeeding at providing cover for violence, looting, and destruction caused by the actual protesters.  Perhaps if this movie came out six months earlier, the outcry in Ferguson would have been more constructive than destructive.

Yes, the movie got LBJ wrong and the LBJ camp has the right to complain about it.  A simple solution would have been to make Gov. George Wallace or the local Selma sheriff the lead antagonist.  Many movies take liberties with their depictions of historic events.  However, those liberties can be called into question, especially when the change falsely portrays someone's legacy.",1422316800,6,2012,4.893491124260355

6672933,4,B00NMF8SEK,"Director Ava DuVernay (""Scandal"") brings us a PG-13 film about Martin Luther King. Screenwriter Paul Webb wisely limited this story to one situation in 1965 rather than try to encompass the entire American Civil Rights Movement and/or the complete life and times of Martin Luther King. We start with MLK receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, then we segue to the church where the four little girls are blown up. These are two of the events which sealed Dr. King's destiny.

This cast includes:
  * David Oyelowo (""The Help"") is Martin Luther King, not a saint, not a devil, just an ambitious man with a dream, and guaranteeing the right to vote for all citizens is the obvious beginning.
  * Carmen Ejogo (""Alex Cross"") is Coretta Scott King, trying to make sense of the life in which she finds herself...her and her children!
  * Tim Roth (""Arbitrage"") is George Wallace, the Governor of Alabama who crosses swords with our hero in Selma, and Lyndon Baines Johnson in Washington D.C. We greeted news of his defeats with glee.
  * Tom Wilkinson (""The Grand Budapest Hotel"") is Lyndon Baines Johnson, President of the United States during this perilous time. He ultimately signs the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but not until after he tries delaying, negotiating, and delivering ultimatums, all to no avail.
  * Dylan Baker (Lots of TV) is J. Edgar Hoover, who has placed MLK on his Enemies List.
  * Oprah Winfrey (""Lee Daniels' The Butler"") is Annie Lee Cooper, whose attempt to register illustrates the impediments thrown up for blacks who want to vote.

The first four outstanding actors are actually British, working over here in the Colonies, bringing their skills and wonderful training to our shores. I'm being a bit facetious, but American actors continue to lose ground... Why don't they ask ME? Aarghhh!

The script makes each separate issue and point of view crystal clear, no easy feat when you consider how complex the situation was in 1965. I only wish the King family had granted the filmmakers rights to Rev. King's actual words. Wonderful cast did brilliant work with what they had, though. Kudos!",1422230400,3,2107,4.862745098039215

There were many strands of opportunity to pursue but nonetheless still somewhat satisfying with the compressed emotion endemic to the subject matter.  Will there ever be a documentary styled film that sheds light into the self-righteous attitudes of the Whites of that region and that era to complement this movie?",1422230400,3,650,5.180952380952381
6672935,5,B00NMF8SEK,"Selma is a movie about a rural Alabama town where encumbered voting was a major issue in the 1960s. While everyone was allowed to vote, many African-American people were kept from voting in various ways. This was due to intimidation or intense questioning before voter registration.

The movie focuses on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s experiences and influences in the city. In my opinion, Selma will win Best Picture because of its focus and commentary on an unresolved issue.

The focus of the movie is firm throughout. The plot starts after King's ""I have a dream"" speech and ends before his assassination. This is important because the movie could have very easily slipped into only being a biographical excerpt of King's life. However, the film holds its focus on the events that took place in Selma, Alabama, including King's influence on marches and protests.

The focus of the story makes this a good film, but the social commentary behind it is what I think will push it into the ""award-winning"" category. The end of the movie is a speech given by King in Montgomery followed by information and pictures from the actual events in Selma. While the major march from Selma to Montgomery described in the movie was an instantaneous success for the people of Selma, the film gave no answer for resolving the entire issue of race relations in the United States. This, I believe, is the film's way of saying the issue is not resolved. An original song written by Common, and African-American hip hop artist, played during the credits, mentioning Ferguson and other contemporary issues.
The movie addresses the fact that injustice issues are still present in the United States but it also mentions the fact that neither side is made of perfect human beings. Part of the movie is dedicated to the marital issues that King had resulting from his affairs.

This is where I think the movie could have gone even deeper. In my opinion, focusing more on King's affairs would have heighted the stressful mood in Selma. While this could be biographical about King, it was true that these affairs had an influence on his work in Selma. Not only were politically oppressive encumbered voting issues happening to the people of Selma and the people involved, but heavy things like affairs were going on inside the personal lives of the people as well. While King was struggling with a specific voting problem that had arisen in American society, he was also struggling with the problem of adultery that stretches much further back into history.

Overall, the film painted a picture of truth inside of a contemporary issue. The contextual parts of the film -its honesty, accuracy and focus - were near flawless. It did not shy away from telling the story the way it happened. We know this because a lot of the scenes were based on the recordings the FBI had from King's travels. Also the theatrical parts of the film were very good. The acting was phenomenal and the setting looked and felt exactly like the actual pictures showed during the credits. But viewers will enjoy the movie because it is based on a true story and the racial differences are something some people can relate to, considering some of the issues are still unresolved.

For this reason I also recommend watching an older series titled Band of Brothers and the newer film American Sniper. Like Selma, both of these paint a picture of history with honesty, accuracy and focus, speaking of issues that people can still relate to today in sending children to war and struggling with the mental repercussions of war.",1422230400,,3569,4.833060556464812
6672936,5,B00NMF8SEK,"Ava DuVernay's ""Selma"" takes us to one of the most crucial events in the history of the civil rights movement--the march from Selma to Montgomery, led by Dr. Martin Luther King (David Oyelowo). It isn't so much a biopic of King as a portrait of him and several of his associates at a time when--literally--they could win the voting rights they sought, or die trying. There is nothing stuffy or pompous about this historical movie. DuVernay and screenwriter Paul Webb make sure ""Selma"" is urgent, edgy, often terrifying: they present the story through the eyes of the marchers, who experienced police and government power as an oppressive and even murderous force. Recent headlines suggest that things may not have changed as much in the past fifty years as we hoped.

""Selma"" has been the subject of controversy, because of criticism of its portrayal of President Johnson (Tom Wilkinson)), and also because it received only two Academy Award nominations when many more were expected. A lot of articles have been published about ""Selma's"" historical accuracy, and they have persuaded me that ""Selma"" doesn't stretch the truth any more than is standard in a historical film. Seeing the film also convinced me that DuVernay, Webb and especially Oyelowo deserved to be nominated. Oyelowo doesn't sound all that much like King, but in his oratorical scenes he captures both King's cadence and his fire. In the quieter scenes, Oyelowo is supremely effective in portraying a man of conscience and intellect, plagued with worry but always resolute as to the justice of his cause.

There are many more fine performances in ""Selma,"" including Wilkinson, Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King, and Tim Roth as a ratlike George Wallace. But it is Oyelowo you will remember, as well as the images of police on horseback, clubbing and whipping peaceful, unarmed marchers.

Overall, it's a beautiful, moving film. At times, that can mean slow-moving, but this isn't necessarily a negative. The film takes time to paint its characters not with the broad brush of mythology, but with the garish graffiti of humanity. It can be jarring to see icons as human beings when we're used to seeing them in grainy footage and as imposing monuments.

Because director Ava DuVernay, leading man David Oyelowo, and producers Brad Pitt and Oprah Winfrey take pains to remember that these were real events with real people, ""Selma"" delivers a somber examination of a shameful, yet courageous time in American history.

In fact, that's the one word I would use to summarize this movie: courage. There are many acts of courage on display in ""Selma,"" all of them starkly embodied by the film's central figure.

King has the courage to boldly proclaim the truth of equality from various pulpits and lecterns; he has the courage to stand up to a President who wants to expend his political capital on fighting poverty, not Southern racists; he has the courage to admit his moral failings to his wife and to himself; he has the courage to listen to the Spirit when the eyes of the world are on him; and he has the courage to admit when he is tired, weak, and alone.

King is never portrayed as a saint or as perfect, and in making this deliberate choice about a man who has been both lionized and vilified, the director and the actor enable his most lasting characteristic-- courage--to stand out and challenge the audience.

I urge you to take the time to view it. Following a year of racial tumult, there's no better time to be reminded of our complicated, ugly history with bigotry and prejudice and one man's nonviolent efforts to model a better way.",1421798400,2,1993,4.6477272727272725
6672939,5,B00NMF8SEK,"I have to wonder if it's the historical controversies over this movie that have caused it to be so overlooked by the Academy. Not that that has stopped them from being all over movies like The Imitation Game but, then, those are less controversial controversies. Yeah, I know Selma got a best picture nomination, but that seems almost as if it was only a token nomination (because they had to) rather than any serious consideration of the film.

The thing is, I think the controversies, especially the ones around LBJ, have to do with perspective rather than actual fact. In other words, both sides are correct and both sides are wrong. Sure, Lyndon Johnson pushed through the Voting Rights Act and not even against his will, but that doesn't mean he didn't also act as an impediment to King. That's really the kind of thing that depends upon which side of the fence you're on. It's an awfully small thing to be arguing about in a film like this.

And what kind of a film is this? Well, it's everything that 12 Years a Slave was not. Where 12 Years is emotionally distant, Selma is emotionally gripping. Where 12 Years is brutally graphic, Selma shies away from actual depictions of violence. The club goes up, but you rarely see where it falls. What you do see is the aftermath and the emotional turmoil. You see purposeful, personal, systematic persecution of a people rather than the rather impersonal depiction of slavery from 12 Years and the isolated vendetta-style conflict. In Selma, it's not someone with a chip on his shoulder abusing a loan slave, it's a culture of persecution against a race. It's deliberate and it's illegal, and it was maddening to watch the injustice. Selma shines a bright light on what was a culture of intolerance and ignorance.

Look, I grew up in the South, and this movie made me wish that I had been alive in the 60s and could have marched with King myself.

That David Oyelowo was overlooked for a best actor nomination is frustrating at the very least. That Eddie Redmayne received one for sitting in a chair is an injustice. As far as I can tell from what people who know have been saying, Oyelowo was pretty spot on and, from the clips I've heard of King speaking, it sounded to me as if he nailed it. What I do know for sure, though, is that he nailed the speaking style of the Southern black preacher. I've been to some of those Southern Baptist meetings with black preachers, and Oyelowo, when he is delivering King's speeches, would have fit in flawlessly. It's also worth noting how monotone Oyelowo was when he was practicing those speeches to himself, but it was a tremendous transformation when he moved in front of a crowd.

The other acting is also great. Tom Wilkinson was spectacular as LBJ, as was Dylan Baker as Hoover. I have a fondness for Wendell Pierce and really enjoyed him as Rev. Williams. And Tim Roth... well, I wanted to punch him in his big, old nose. He needed someone to punch it. Stephen Root is also always good, and we didn't get less than we expected. Carmen Ejogo was also good as King's wife, but I don't actually think that one was an Oscar performance... except when you see that Felicity Jones was nominated; Ejogo was at least as good as Jones.

On top of everything else, though, the movie is timely in its relation to how you deal with terrorism, because that's what had been going on in the South for 100 years. I don't remember the exact quote, but there is a conversation between King and another man while they are in jail, the gist of which was something along the lines of standing up for your rights as a person and how to deal with the fact that the people who have been keeping you down will continue to try to knock you down. You just stand up again. It really resonated with what Charb said about dying on your feet rather than living on your knees. Some of King's followers did die, but they died on their feet for something they believed in, and it allowed those that came after them to start out on their feet. It's a powerful message.",1421798400,15,4032,4.5088919288645695

David Oyelowo is the anchor of the movie but he doesnt own the movie like say Daniel Day-Lewis did in Lincoln. That comes across in the first few scenes that go from Oslo to Montgomery to Selma. This movie like The Civil Rights Movement was about a group of people, not a person. Dont get me wrong  he was positively uncanny as MLK. It was wonderful to count off the people in the movie even though you knew that some were destined to die.

That isn't a bad thing as DuVernay gave a lot of figures the spotlight  Coretta, Mahalia Jackson, Diane Nash, James Foreman, John Lewis, Hosea Williams, Malcom X, Bayard Rustin, LBJ, George Wallace, J. Edgar, Andrew Young, Viola Liuzzo, Jimmie Lee Jackson, James Reeb  and of course the infamous Sheriff Jim Clark.

As far as the LBJ criticism, I feel their pain. It sounds a bit like the criticism of Spielbergs mostly monochromatic Lincoln. Selma was more diverse movie and it was apparent (for those with a bit of historical sense that the LBJ in the movie was an amalgam of JFK and LBJ. I can imagine what the blowback would have been if she portrayed how The Kennedys dealt with The Civil Rights issue then!

I don't think that Tom Wilkinson nailed LBJs speech patterns but he nailed the in your face physicality of the man. The same goes for Carmen Ejogo portrayal of Coretta. Tim Roth played George Wallace and as always, he plays psychos well. It was wonderful to see Wendell Pierce and Lorraine Toussaint even Niecy Nash toned it down a couple of notches. There were many excellent actors in here. I suspect that its partly because of the subject but mostly because of the director.

Ava DuVernay is a premier director not a premier woman, not a premier Black, but a premier director. She has directed I Will Follow, The Middle of Nowhere and now Selma. All are movies of substance and artistic. If you want to know the true history, you must of course go elsewhere. She has made it quite plain that she used artistic license over historical exactness. Normally that bothers me, but she really found a proper balance.",1421625600,,2622,4.489495798319328

Clearly, ""Selma"" is a strong contender for Best Picture at the 2015 Academy Awards.  What even strengthens its chances further is the fact that no blacks were nominated at all in any of the major Oscar categories (Best Actor/Actress and Supporting Actor/Actress).  Wouldn't you agree that perhaps the Hollywood Foreign Press and the Academy will give the Best Picture Oscar to ""Selma"" as a consolation due to the above fact?  This is just my expert psychological thinking talking here, but it wouldn't surprise me in the least if Selma takes the cake here.

We all have our own inherent biases and impressions of people and events - but for any of us, this was an amazing film that will undoubtedly resonate.  This movie will remind us that we still have a long way to go before all of our diverse types of people are living with dignity, and without fear. One of the beautiful parts of this film is that it is not a biography of Dr King.  It is about the entire context of the time and events, and in telling this story, becomes so much more relevant and timely.

Director Ava DuVernay is brilliant, and manages to give us some incredible insight into the 3 months leading up to the infamous march.  I was disappointed that she was not given an Oscar nomination for this work.  A best picture nomination and best original song do not do the film justice.

David Oyelowo is a virtual unknown, at least I had never heard of him before, and totally takes this role and knocks it out of the park!  I can't imagine anyone portraying Dr King more convincingly or authentically.

The role for Oprah is a small one, but pivotal and sets the stage for much of the frustration of the time.

This is a movie you will want to watch more than once.

Update: Another reviewer called my attention to the fabulous performance of Paul Winfeld in the TV mini-series on King, and it is well worth watching.  Just search for that on youtube and you will find a few scenes that will undoubtedly spark some interest.",1421539200,16,1551,4.325259515570934

6672948,5,B00NMF8SEK,"Selma tells the story of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement between the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and that of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The film focuses on the 1965 Selma to Montgomery voting rights marches, at a time when the organizers and participants in the march did so at tremendous risk to their physical safety. It is a reminder of a shameful time in American history when, a century after the end of the civil war, the abhorrent treatment of African-Americans in the deep south persisted and manifested itself in horrible acts of violence against black men, women and even children.

David Oyelowo (who played the part of Lewis Gaines in 2013's great film Lee Daniels The Butler) stars in the film as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He captures the cadence of Dr. King's rhetoric very well, and is solid in the lead role. One of the themes in the film is the self-doubt that Dr. King experienced in the face of the daunting and frightening challenges he faced as he sought to change history. The film also has a wonderful supporting cast which includes actress Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King, Stephan James as future Congressman John L. Lewis, Wendell Pierce as Rev. Hosea Williams, and Tim Roth as Governor George Wallace. Oprah Winfrey also gives an excellent performance as Annie Lee Cooper, a woman violently beaten by Selma Sheriff James G. Clark. The acting in the film is superb and the movie captures the tension of the times and strongly conveys this to the viewer.

The film has been criticized for its portrayal of President Lyndon B. Johnson, who is played in the film by Tom Wilkinson. The Director of the LBJ Library has complained that the film wrongly presents Johnson as an obstructionist and as someone who stood in the way of progress in the field of civil rights. Personally, I didn't get that sense from watching the film. Clearly, at the time, for Johnson to take rapid action on civil rights did not match the political reality that he faced. The fact that, following the march, Johnson was able to bring about the passage of the Voting Rights Act is a tremendous accomplishment. I didn't get any sense that Johnson was unfairly vilified in the film, and in fact I thought that the film presented him positively, especially in one of the last scenes in which Johnson addresses Congress, closing with the words ""we shall overcome."" Any controversy about Johnson's portrayal is best resolved by seeing the film yourself and coming to your own conclusions.

This film is a wonderful tribute to the civil rights movement and a gripping reminder of this turbulent chapter of American history. March 7th of this year (2015) will be the 50th anniversary of the Bloody Sunday attack by state troopers on marchers at the Edmund Pettis Bridge. This is a powerful and moving film and deserves recognition as one of the best films of the year.",1421452800,,2904,4.71259842519685
6672949,4,B00NMF8SEK,"""Selma"" (2014 release; 127) looks at a short (6 month) period in the life of Martin Luther King. As the movie opens, we see King and his wife getting ready for a fancy outing (we later learn it is the 1964 Nobel Peace Price ceremony). The next scene jumps to a vicious bombing of a black church in Alabama, killing four little girls. We then switch to a woman (played by Oprah Winfrey) who is trying to register to vote. The county clerk refuses when she cannot name all 67 county judges in Alabama. King meets with President Johnson to explain the gravity of the situation, urging him to pass legislation that would take away any existing hurdles to let blacks vote. At this point we're about 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, on the heels of last year's shocking ""12 Years A Slave"", ""Selma"" is another important movie about significant times and events for the black community (and indeed the entire country). Here also there are scenes in the movie that are likely to shock (at least, they did me). Second, the movie has run into controversy due to its historical inaccuracies, particularly as it relates to the positions taken by LBJ (in the movie, he does not seem very understanding of King's views). It's unfortunate that the movie's director (who has stood by her views) felt it necessary to bend history a bit, and it bothered me as I was watching the scenes between LBJ and Dr. King. Third, there are a number of very powerful scenes in the movie, including several speeches from Dr. King. Interestingly, the movie did not get permission from Dr. King's estate to use his speeches, so they had to reinvent and rephrase them for the movie. Didn't bother me at all. Fourth, the performance of British actor David Oyelowo as Dr. Kings is nothing short of outstanding, and it is a darn shame that he was not nominated for a Best Actor Oscar. British actress Carmen Ejogo (Coretta King) was also revelatory. Last but not least, the movie saves the best for the final 15 minutes, when it all gels beautifully. Throwing in the archival TV footage of the actual walk was a stroke of genius.

""Selma"" finally opened in Cincinnati this weekend and I went to see it right away. The matinee screening where I saw this at today was very well attended, I'm happy to report. When the end credits started rolling, the audience burst out into a spontaneous applause. Bottom line: ""Selma"" highlights an important moment in this country's history, and for that reason alone I'd recommend you go see it. But on top of that, ""Selma"", warts and all, is a pretty good movie too, with a towering performance from David Oyelowo as Dr. King. Is ""Selma"" going to win the Best Picture Oscar? I doubt it. There are other movies nominated (in particular ""Boyhood"", which is my favorite movie of the year, and ""Birdman"") that are simply more unique and frankly, better, than ""Selma"". But that shouldn't stop you from checking out ""Selma"" too.",1421452800,7,3055,4.634686346863469
6672950,5,B00NMF8SEK,"Where to begin.  I was a child when these events occurred but vividly recall watching the images on my black and white television screen.  For me this movie was extremely moving and personal....I couldn't find enough tissues to handle the flow of tears. The story of ""Selma"" is beautifully told, well acted and directed.  Kudos to all involved in bringing this story to the big screen and overcoming several major hurdles to do so (most importantly, not having access to Dr. King's actual speeches and having to use similar language to avoid copyright infringement).  David Oyelowo in particular does a masterful job of portraying Dr. King....his voice, mannerisms....absolutely superb.  Tom Wilkinson is also great as LBJ. There has been much made of the depiction of LBJ in the movie, whether or not it was historically accurate.  Most biopic movies take license with and stretch the truth about the subject (see The Imitation Game and American Sniper).

I took my teenage daughter to see this movie and she asked me afterwards were events actually as depicted.  Unfortunately, it was (I showed her clips from ""Eyes on the Prize"").  Man's inhumanity to man never ceases and Selma reminds us all of that.  What's so scary is that these events occurred 50 years ago and here we are in 2015 still having to fight against voter suppression and denial of human rights. I'm encouraging everyone I know to see this movie, especially because of its relevancy to today.

Overall, it was truly an outstanding movie and well worth viewing.",1421452800,3,1530,4.9375
6672951,5,B00NMF8SEK,"Selma is not just a fictionalized bio of Martin Luther King Jr. It's a moral tale of community courage in the face of majority terrorism and of ""what it takes"" to make history. It's also a vivid depiction of sordid, stupid, hateful bigotry in the Land of the Free. Set within a few months in 1965, it makes no cinematic leaps to the past or the present, but it has a subtext of fear about the here and now, about the persistent efforts of racists and ideologues to reverse history, to strip away the gains of the Civil Rights Movement of the '60s for the sheer political advantage of the plutocratic Republican Party.

I was in Europe at the time of the Selma events in 1965. I'd been involved in civil rights activism before going to Europe, but when I came back some time later I was more urgently involved in anti-war protests. Nevertheless, I remember J Edgar Hoover and George Wallace vividly. The portrayal of those two hateful scoundrels in the film ""Selma""  was so intense that I wanted to jump up from my seat and rip the smug grins off both their faces. LBJ comes close to having the same urge in his dramatic confrontation with Wallace, when he says he prays that History won't lump him together with such a despicable fool.

History! ""Selma"" is about history and it intends to make history ... if, that is, it moves enough Americans to realize that the voting rights and the blessings of human equality gained in the 1960s are currently being snatched away by the Republican disenfranchisement of voters who ""don't have the brains to vote Republican."" The voting protections of LBJ's 1965 legislation were repudiated by the Roberts Supreme Court last year! If viewers don't make that connection, the whole idea of an ""informed electorate"" is a hoax. So this film is not just a touching entertainment; it's a profoundly relevant history lesson.

However, ""Selma"" is decidedly imperfect in several ways, both as drama and as history. The dramatic flaws are of no interest to me; I was violently moved by the film anyway. The historical flaws require examination, but only if the examiner acknowledges the basic relevance of the film to PRESENT DAY voter suppression. The widely discussed comments by Bill Moyers are clear on that; the film has a powerful message for America in 2015. Any quibbling over the portrayal of LBJ must not obscure that message!

Is Selma the Best Film of 2014? There's a brouhaha in cyberspace about the non-nomination of this film and its director for the Oscar biggies. The answer will depend on what's important to you. ""Selma"" is not as original and bold as ""Boyhood."" ""Selma"" is not as brilliantly constructed and acted as ""Birdman."" Boyhood is the documentation of a Life in Time; Time is its profound theme and its source of power. Birdman is all about an Individual bravely battling an Existence ... his own; it's the ultimate in anomie as art. ""Selma"" is about America ... dare I say the heart and soul of America? ... in the centuries-long battle with its addiction to racism. ""Boyhood"" and ""Birdman"" are expressions of brilliant artistry for art's sake, but the subject matter of ""Selma"" dwarfs such self-conscious self-exposures. If ""Selma"" isn't the Best Film of the year, it's easily the Most Important.",1421452800,9,3254,4.772646536412078
6672952,5,B00NMF8SEK,"There are two things that stood out to me in this biopic about a brief period in the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  First, is the wonderful performance of David Oyelowo as King.  Here is a Brit, born of Nigerian parents who perfectly captures the mannerisms, the southern drawl and the personality of the Civil Rights leader.  Second, the director, Ava DuVernay and how she managed to illuminate sides of King that we hadn't seen before.  His doubts, his faith and his determination are explored.  This is DuVernay's first foray into making a feature film.  Most of her background is in marketing and promoting film.

By most accounts, MLK's choice of marching from Selma to the Alabama state capitol in Montgomery was a turning point in the Civil Rights movement.  DuVernay doesn't pull any punches in the depiction of the racist anger leveled at King and his followers.  Perhaps the most controversial aspect of the film, is how it portrays President Lyndon Johnson (Tom Wilkinson).  What I saw suggests that while Johnson appeared sympathetic to the movement, he was reluctant to intervene so soon after the passing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  King's perspective was that if southern states continued to put up roadblocks to voter registration, nothing significant would be accomplished.  For Johnson, it was all about the politics of the timing.  For King, it had to be now as the brutality of the racist politicians was untenable.  Whether or not this is historically accurate, I will leave for others to debate.  As far as a filmmaker's plotline, Johnson makes for a convenient archvillain.

The film itself is remarkably well done.  Segregating King's life into a brief snippet allows the viewer the opportunity to absorb the evil of the time.  King knew that the key to the Right's movement was to get the attention of the press, especially television.  It was all calculated.  The brave people who were slaughtered and maimed before, during and after the march on the Edmund Pettus Bridge brought the atrocities to white America.  Attention that could not be ignored.

The film is beautifully shot.  There are some great segues at the end of the film where DuVernay blends her scenes of people marching with those of the original black and white film.  This is a terrific film that highlights voting rights, an issue that has come up again in recent times.",1421107200,12,2377,4.870324189526184
6672953,5,B00NMF8SEK,"I have studied Martin Luther King Jr. extensively in both past/present, and to be perfectly clear I fully respect what he stood for and the Civil Rights Movement. To date, I have seen two portrayals of Martin Luther King Jr. but it is clear that not only is this the best portrayal of him I have seen thus far, but the movie Selma is one of the year's best films.

After receiving the Nobel Peace Price, Martin Luther King Jr. leads a movement to get voting rights for African Americans. But in the movie Selma, we see him and many others go through a great ordeal in order to get the right established.

David Oyelowo is absolutely Brilliant here as Martin Luther King Jr. He completely embodies the stature, the mannerisms, and the voice of leadership and reason throughout the movie. What is really likable is how Selma shows the Martin Luther King Jr. as a family man, as the leader of the Civil Rights Movement, and a man with his own problems. Carmen Ejogo is also impressive here as Coretta; the scenes she has with Martin Luther King Jr. at times gives Selma an even more dramatic, compassionate feel. Tom Wilkinson stars as Lyndon Johnson and though the complete accuracy of certain instances in the movie have been questioned-I do like the stern trait he immerses in the character. Stephan James plays the role of John Lewis and does really well.

The story in this movie also develops really well. Some things were revised (for movie purposes), but I like how the key things that did happen were in the movie Selma. Not just the satisfying acting, but the overall direction is why I not only feel David Oyelowo will get nods, but I do believe that the movie Selma Will also receive a nod for Best Picture.

Make no mistake, I was moved by this movie and for all these reasons I consider Selma to be

6672954,3,B00NMF8SEK,"Since I knew Oprah was affiliated with this project, I figured somehow it would be twisted into another half-baked ""Uncle Tom/Aunt Jemima"" trope, the same way that everything else she and Tyler Perry get involved in. As a result, I told myself I would pass it up. But my curiosity got the best of me. And I am happy to report that it was a well done movie. A tightly crafted screen play, after obviously having been pieced together from what undoubtedly had to be sporadic and fragmented materials.

Both LBJ and King came off as believable human characters although Coretta leaned too much in the ""expected cardboard Aunt Jemima cutout"" direction to be believable. Also, I was very disappointed that Malcolm X's speech at the Church in Selma was mentioned but purposely nixed. The times (and this movie) cried out for the new ""Malcolm unity move"" that he single-handedly was trying to integrate into the King-led movement. However, it is a measure of the kind of conservative forces controlling the script that it was omitted: Shame!

Also, the role that Harry Belafonte played in getting a bunch of Hollywood heavy hitters down to Alabama for the march (he spent well over $200K) was very much minimized. Those writing the script should have read what William Cohen's wife had to say about Harry's role, or what reverend King, or Marlon Brando said about him in his autobiography, or indeed Harry's own honest description of those events provided in his own very fine autobiography.

Oprah, as usual hogged center stage -- front and center -- in her usual uncompromising Aunt Jemima role. [C'mon Oprah, have you no shame? Grow up: when are your going to give that Aunt Jemima trope up? Jeez, you are a billionaire? Relax, your slip is showing?]

6672955,5,B00NMF8SEK,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Selma""

1. This movie is called ""Selma"", not ""King"". While Dr. Martin Luther King is the main character in this movie, it's really about the 1965 protest march to overcome restrictions on allowing blacks to vote. So it covers a lot more than just him.

2. I'm not an expert on this area of history; but from what I do know, the movie stays fairly close to the facts. The biggest problem with historical accuracy is the movie's negative portrayal of President Johnson. He wasn't obstructing King's movement, and he didn't assign the FBI to spy on MLK (the previous president did that). They got along a lot better than the movie claims.

3. In 2009, the King estate sold the rights to MLK's speeches to another Hollywood studio for a movie to be made by Steven Spielberg. So this movie wasn't allowed to use MLK's actual speeches. They had to invent new ones that said basically the same things, but without violating copyright.

4. Reportedly, some white people hired as extras in the movie found out that they were supposed to play racists. They politely asked to switch roles, and were changed to marchers.

5. The movie does a great job of showing the complexities of the situation - the black civil rights movement was not a unified front. There were turf issues, competing tactics, and even disagreement on exactly what they were trying to accomplish. It's also honest enough to show the sometimes cynical side of activism - the cold calculations of how and when to do things, in order to maximize media coverage and sympathy from other people.

6. There are a few scenes that are overly dramatic and sanctimonious, but that's to be expected in a movie like this. And they really didn't distract from the bigger picture.

7. It's ironic that in this film of such an iconic piece of American history, the roles of Dr. King, his wife, the president, and governor George Wallace are all played by British actors.

8. If you think this movie makes white people look bad, or if it makes you angry at white people, you have missed the point. And you also aren't really paying attention.

9. As far as historical dramas go, this one is better than most. It's smart, interesting, confrontational when it needs to be, and much more nuanced than you might expect. It's a great addition to cinematic portrayals of American history and the struggle for justice.",1420934400,5,2383,4.681818181818182
6672956,5,B00NMF8SEK,"Hard to know where to begin here.  I realize that to call a film ""powerful"" really might sound a bit cliche', but I just can't think of any better words to describe this film.  I wish I could, because, I believe it transcends ""powerful"" and enters into an emotional realm that very few films I have ever watched have taken me.  I watched most of the film through tears.  I have always admired Dr. King, and looked upon him as one of the truly most courageous and captivating leaders of our time.  Although I was only seven, I remember vividly hearing of his murder--even as a child, it was one of those ""where were you when..."" moments for me....so I watched the film with a high level of expectation, and can say honestly that justice was done by the man.  David Oyelowo's portrayal of Dr. King was masterful--he offers King as a humble man of courage and conviction, who sees the Civil Rights Movement as something much bigger than himself,  and  is determined to do the right thing not for any recognition or desire for fame, but because it is the right thing to do.

""Selma"" is a film of heartbreaking brutality and exalting inspiration.  It is about the best and the worst in us all.  It is particularly timely in light of some of the events taking place today--from the increasing tensions between African-American communities and law enforcement to the concerted effort on the part of certain legislators to roll back many of the gains in voting rights that so many people fought so hard for, were brutalized for, and died for.  In that context, it serves as an effective reminder that although many things have changed, too much has stayed the same, that the malignant force that is racism is by no means extinct in this country, and that we as a nation still have miles to go before we can fulfill the dream.  We all need to climb to the same mountaintop, and need to realize as human beings that any threat to the rights and equality of people anywhere, threatens us everywhere.  We are all in this together.",1420934400,21,2018,4.538674033149171
6672957,4,B00NMF8SEK,"The film opens with Dr. Martin Luther King (David Oyelowo) receiving the Nobel Prize as a church explodes in Alabama. The rest of the film concerns the march from Selma to Montgomery and the work to pass the Voting Rights Act. It looks at the inner conflict of the planners, the trouble in the house of Dr. King, and King's communication with LBJ (Tom Wilkinson).

Oprah settles for a minor role as Annie Lee Cooper after having been denied an Oscar nomination for ""The Butler."" The film as expected is inspirational and emotional with good performances. The film opens itself to criticism from the left as it shows that President Johnson wanted to wait until 1966 for the Voting Rights Act. However, the view in the film is what is basically reflected in his 1976 biography by Doris Kearns. The movie also has actual FBI notes appear on the screen, in case you think the event didn't happen. I found the appearance of the note interesting historically, but annoying and interfering for viewing the drama.

While the acting was good, I didn't feel like I was watching King, LBJ, or George Wallace (Tim Roth). I don't think that they ""nailed it."" David Oyelowo reciting the pseudo-speeches of MLK, while inspirational, failed to project as did Dr. King. Apparently they made a movie about Dr. King without getting the rights to his speeches. Reminds me of the recent Hendrix film where they couldn't get the rights to his music.

Worth viewing. Historically better than an Oliver Stone film, but not as much fun to watch.
