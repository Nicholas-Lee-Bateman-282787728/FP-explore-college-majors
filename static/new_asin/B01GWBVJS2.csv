8763741,5,B01GWBVJS2,"As a screenwriter, I intend on watching this movie 'til my eyes fall out. I'm recreating the blockbuster movie into a creation with Panic! at the Disco's Brendan Urie in mind. Personally, my mind is a giant with creative innovation. Even if he doesn't participate, I'll get someone. Wish me luck!

Meanwhile, Gerard Butler did an awesome and surprisingly strong-voiced ""The Music of the Night"" rendition. Taking a classic a step higher, hold onto your seats for a creative nuance breaking through.",1529971200,,497,5.060975609756097
8763742,5,B01GWBVJS2,"I've enjoyed this movie since it came out.  It is interesting that the complex emotional story is almost entirely delivered in music and song, unlike some musicals where people talk a lot and then break into musical numbers.  The story  is engaging, the actors well cast for their roles and clearly are putting their hearts into their performances.  The comical parts comical, the poignant moments poignant and the scary stuff scary.  The character development is well done and the music will sink into your soul.  I recommend watching this on the biggest screen with the best sound system you can muster.  And if you don't have a decent sound system see if you can hook some headphones up to your TV.  Some TVs have headphone jacks or bluetooth.  That would make a difference since the sounds really do carry the story.",1529625600,,820,4.75886524822695
