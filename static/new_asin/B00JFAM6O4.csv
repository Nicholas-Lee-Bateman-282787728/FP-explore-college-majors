They left a glowing review but for some reason seemed to have mistakenly selected how many starts to leave. Anyway, as far as these types of products go, most of this stuff is produced by prophecy nuts or conspiracy theorists or overdramatized mainstream TV shows, but Decoding the Future takes an entirely different approach and actually educates us on how theologians have truly decoding these prophecies. One may think his discredits the book,but in fact it does the opposite. This DVD actually reinforces that the prophecies are 100% true and paints such a convicting picture from a theological, eschatological and archeological view that I'm not event sure where to begin on how it does such a good job of finally blowing the lid off of Revelation the way it does. I understand these last days prophecies now from watching this for 1.5 hours than I have from the last 10 years of studying! This is simply a MUST WATCH!",1425945600,2,1001,4.693181818181818
6356496,1,B00JFAM6O4,"this was the best interpretation I have witnessed about the book of revelation. I highly recommend this documentary course. I want to see more and more. real on site visits to ancient cities that are mentioned in the revelation. explaining step by step what each city was like at that time. all this information gave me a better idea of what Paul is trying to reveal to us.
I cannot wait to see more.",1415491200,,400,4.418918918918919
6356497,5,B00JFAM6O4,"Like so many others out there, I have a huge interest in prophecy; especially since I do believe there is some credence to what people of the ancient world understood and foresaw. As a result, Ive seen countless prophecy films about statistics and theories; most of which are low budget garbage documentaries/courses/films since they have countless holes or unaddressed common rebuttals that I think we all need to hear responses to. So lets get to the point Decoding the Future: Part One is absolutely NOT one of these types of courses/ documentaries and is easily the best journey through the prophecies in the Book of Revelation I have EVER watched. Not only is this film extremely thorough in the teaching and translations of ancient prophecy, it provides new theological understand and cultural discoveries to bring an in-depth understanding of Revelation to life that no else has ever been able to accomplish as far as I know and easily PROVES the prophecies of Revelation are absolutely valid and happening.
This course clearly looks as if it was created to discuss, debate, and prove the validity of ancient prophecy in such an intelligent way, its easy to see the producers are passionate and care about the topics being discussed as well as being incredibly knowledgeable about all views from multiple denominations, religions and secular world views. This is NOT a product that you watch once and toss, but one youll hold onto for years and share with everyone you know! In part 1 of the course, I must have had at least 10 epiphanies about how we look at prophecy and understand the ancient world and this is coming from someone who actively watches these types of films!  This will bring such a new and deep meaning to not only Revelation, but to life itself that it has changed the way I look at everything.",1397433600,27,1821,4.817891373801917
8650490,5,B00JFAM6O4,This was a very well put together video.  It is definitely a must see.,1483488000,,70,4.0
8650491,2,B00JFAM6O4,It was okay more of a historical perspective,1477008000,,44,4.625
8650492,4,B00JFAM6O4,"Kinda dry watching. Like being in a history class. With that said, it was educational. Will eventually buy the whole series, hoping the price comes down first, though. Recommend just buy the whole series, the first one doesn't give you much.",1474761600,4,241,4.902439024390244

8650494,5,B00JFAM6O4,"The book of Revelation is hard if not impossible to understand with all the symbolism that it contains.  It is also very frightening to most of us.
Our neighborhood ladies bible study is presently viewing the Decoding the Future DVDs.  We are a diverse group coming from different churches.
After our first DVD the ladies were amazed at how Jay McCarl was able to explain the symbolism that is contained in it.  He also showed us that the book is a blessing: Rev. 1:3 ""Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy and heed the things which are written in it: for the time is near.""  He continues to explain there are frightening things in this book, but there are also scenes into heaven before God's throne, the unveiling of Jesus, and even a wedding.  I would recommend this to anyone or group that desires to understand Revelation.",1462147200,,858,4.545454545454546
8650495,3,B00JFAM6O4,Not that impressed. The video series by Dr. Irvin Baxter (endtime.com) is way better!,1461628800,,85,5.142857142857143
8650496,4,B00JFAM6O4,"I really enjoyed part 1. I would appreciate part 2 and 3 and so on...Anyone who is wanting to watch this, will want to continue with the whole thing. Please make the rest available to watch. Why would you offer part one and not follow up with the rest? Did I waste 20 dollars?",1443916800,5,276,4.12962962962963
8650497,5,B00JFAM6O4,"I have the whole series!  What you do with your ""Awe Haw'"" moments are up to you, but I prayed to God. Thank you Father God for helping me understand. In Jesus name amen",1443657600,4,169,3.9705882352941178
8650498,5,B00JFAM6O4,"I purchased the full 7 disc version of this course but fell compelled to leave a review here as well for part one since I have watched it several times and find it important to help spread the word on this course. Prophecy is one of those fields where everyone has a strong opinion about whats truth and whats not and so many are so fast to blow off groundbreaking new discoveries that support the idea that the events of Revelation could actually soon take place. I don't care who you think you are, but this 10-hour long course will shake you awake and force you to look at prophecy in a way that you never ever thought of before and either strengthen your view of prophecy like never before or make a believer out of a skeptic! Its OK to head into this journey a skeptic, but for the love of God, at least choose to TAKE this journey. You will not regret it.",1433203200,22,861,4.224242424242425
