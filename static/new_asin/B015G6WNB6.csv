7435896,4,B015G6WNB6,"I love William Burroughs.  However, the director was not very good.  This was the director's first film, but it is a shame that a better director did not take up this project instead.",1451433600,,183,4.515151515151516
7435897,5,B015G6WNB6,"Burroughs: The Movie, is a revelation. Long unseen with nothing to compare it to, its quite a unique experience. It is very much is a biography of the author, told through intimate interviews and readings from his works. We see a well dressed, dapper, old man recount his sordid, complex, and altogether odd life, retelling his story with his unmistakably slow and textured voice, in a charming and touching way thats truly a privilege to see with a vulnerability thats rarely seen. Some of the moments are profound and revealing, and mostly it is entertaining and informative. Burroughs, a mysterious figure in his own right, opens up in a way that is remarkable, hypnotic, and captivating. Revelations of his sexuality are amazing and profound, the death of his wife is discussed in detail, and his relationship with his son is heartbreaking. The film stayed with me for days after seeing it. if you have a curiosity of the writer and his life, this is a good film to introduce you to the man and his work, if you are a lifelong fan like myself you will love it and find it a satisfying experience. The Blu Ray from Criterion is impeccable, with interviews and outtakes for special features. I recommend for fans of his work or people who are interested in the man himself.",1451001600,11,1275,4.696428571428571

7435899,5,B015G6WNB6,"Finally after so many years locked in the vaults, Burroughs: The Movie directed by Howard Brookner has been released via the Criterion Collection on magnificent Blu-Ray. This in my opinion is the definitive Burrough's documentary, not simply because of the obscurity that it was shrouded in but because of Burrough's own involvement in it. The most recent documentary ""William S. Burroughs: A Man Within"" was great and included a wonderful chosen cast of Burrough's friends, lovers, and admirers of his work, but it lacks the same intimacy and depth that Brookner was able to capture with his documentary. There are appearances from famous beat alumni such as Allen Ginsberg, Herbert Huncke, and Lucien Carr, along with scenes from Billy Burroughs interacting with Bill Sr. which is very rare and substantial footage.

Now for those of you wondering whether or not you should buy this Blu-Ray (which I highly encourage you to do) since you will likely find this either streaming or on torrent sites, I'd recommend getting it just for the extras included. Aaron Brookner, son of the director, went all out on culling together outtakes, footage from film festivals, commentary from him, Jim Jarmusch, and a slew of other interesting features that give you more insights and footage of Burroughs than you've likely ever seen before.

Overall I was highly satisfied with this release and thanks to Aaron Brookner and everyone else who was involved in bringing this classic back for the public to enjoy!",1450569600,12,1498,5.085365853658536

8733463,5,B015G6WNB6,"I got turned on to this film when I read Brad Gooch's memoir of his and the director's life together. I love this movie. It totally humanizes Burroughs, and I could see myself having a conversation with this man. The hombre invisible becomes el hombre accessible because of Howard Brookner's work. I believe that Burroughs' lack of phoniness was his most appealing quality, as this documentary demonstrates. Some of the other Burroughs films appear to be weird for the sake of weirdness, but this film is authentic.",1495065600,,515,4.931034482758621
8733464,5,B015G6WNB6,i thought this was extremely well done.  it was shot well and gives an intimate look at burroughs the man.  definitely the best film on burroughs that i have seen.  if you are a fan of his work or just curious about this well know historically figure this comes highly recommended.,1486944000,,281,4.470588235294118
8733465,4,B015G6WNB6,"Burroughs is a documentary about the life of prolific writer William S. Burroughs. It's a sometimes brilliant, but at other times boring film. I was really interested in the first 30 minutes of the movie. That discusses Burroughs' life as a Beat Generation member and his relationships with Allan Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac and others. The movie is a portrait of Burroughs more than a narrative-driven documentary. It's a very interesting movie, overall.",1478476800,,450,5.263888888888889
8733466,5,B015G6WNB6,Great film; the only place you're ever going to see Burroughs open up about family/personal issues in such an intimate way. Great extras too.,1476057600,,141,4.916666666666667

8733470,5,B015G6WNB6,This is the best documentary on Burroughs made yet. Probably it will never topped since he's gone now and never again will a film maker be able to get this up close with Burroughs. We get to see him hanging out with old friends like Allen Ginsberg and Lucien Carr and with new friends like Terry Southern (some of the funniest moments are with Southern). Of course Billy is here with his dad advising him to apply for a dish washing job at a restaurant in Boulder. That is kind of sad. The extras are quite good too.,1463011200,,516,4.275510204081633
8733471,5,B015G6WNB6,"Criterion did a fantastic job with this release. Great restoration, great extras, including the commentary by Jarmusch, the interview with the director, the outtakes, and the experimental edit of the footage done before the film was edited and released as it appears here. A must for anyone with a serious interest in W.S. Burroughs. (This review is about the Blu-ray edition).",1460764800,2,377,5.19672131147541
