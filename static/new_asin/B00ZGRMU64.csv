7282352,1,B00ZGRMU64,"Some things are off limits when it comes horror movies for me. What the movie shows at the first part of this movie is one of those things. They have gone too far and makes me wonder what type of person would put that in a movie.  If you aren't bothered by a mother dragging her son into the bathroom in order to drown him after she had drowned his siblings, well, go ahead.",1445212800,5,374,4.054054054054054
7282353,4,B00ZGRMU64,This is an entertaining movie it drags a little but picks up quickly  a step ahead  when you have it figured out. Some people won't like it  but its a thirller slash horror not the same stuff all the time  I enjoyed it,1444780800,2,218,4.0
7282354,1,B00ZGRMU64,"I would give it zero, but then it would look as if I forgot to respond. This film was a waste of time and, even worse, a waste of money - if they included the address of the producers, I'd send them a bill for my time.",1456963200,,218,3.6595744680851063
7282355,1,B00ZGRMU64,"tried to be like the grudge , could not pull it off - we laughed through the whole movie ,also I think the only one who actually knew the plot was the director and actors , super stupid and the streaming quality was crap . to boot
stick to free prime and scream tv for cheesy horror",1453507200,,282,3.9649122807017543
7282356,3,B00ZGRMU64,"Story line was decent, the male actor did a better job than the female with the dialogue. Hard to believe that was Dee Wallace, what's with the wig?
If it doesn't take much to scare you, you might like it.",1448323200,,205,4.15

7282359,2,B00ZGRMU64,"I rented this one from The Box for $1.50 Vs. $4.99 from Amazon really?
While this is clearly a low budget movie it did have an interesting story about an apartment that has a history of bad things happening to its occupants with children. The story is eazy to follow although it could use some finessing to make it flow at a better pace. The story also suffers from bad wooden acting that hurts in the keeping you interested department.
A young newlywed couple on a tight budget movie into this apartment. The husband Kevin played by (Andrew W. Walker) has started teaching at a local college and his wife Rachel played by (Michele Hicks) is a stay at home and trying to concive woman who is also suffering from mental illness . It doesn't take long for things to start happening to the couple as well as other occupants of the complex. Their landloard Rose is played by (Dee Walace) and their fertitity Doctor Tenenbaum is played by (Eric Roberts) are the most well know actors in this movie.
Kevin starts to have these strange dreams that he tracks down to coming from a former tenant. The dreams combined with Rachel going off her meds threaten to destroy the couples relationship as well as their unborn baby. I'll leave it there so not to give away to much of the story.
The director/writer Stanley Yung was probably the weakest link in this movie as it was not only writen by him, but he also directed the film and his limited experience shows in both of these areas. Not the worst by any means, but not that great either. This is a movie meant for late teens and adults not due to any nudity, but sexual content and cursing including the F word.",1445904000,2,1652,4.455445544554456

7282361,3,B00ZGRMU64,"The film opens with an apparent child killing inside the title apartment. We then have a new couple move in, being shown the place by the quirky Rose (Dee Wallace) who sets off all kind of signals. Kevin (Andrew W. Walker) is a college professor and his wife Rachel (Michele Hicks- no relation to Catherine Hicks) wants to get pregnant. In one scene he is performing oral sex on his wife, comes up with a small amount of blood by his mouth as his wife laments, ""Why can't I get pregnant?"" Now I am not a doctor, but...I had to laugh. Maybe you're going about it wrong?

Now we already know there is something wrong with the apartment from the title. To make matters worse, the desperate couple visits Eric Roberts to help them get pregnant.

The film has a few things that are going on: Noisy neighbor, sexy Satanic co-ed, wife on medication etc. It tries to keep you entertained. They get a midwife, consultant who apparently learned her craft from Zelda Rubenstein.

Kevin teaches the works of Sylvia Plath at college. For those very familiar with her life and works might find the film has an element of genius in its writing. Unfortunately the characters, dialogue and acting didn't measure up.

7282362,5,B00ZGRMU64,A good Horror Flick for a times ov boredom.,1445644800,,43,3.888888888888889
7282363,2,B00ZGRMU64,As far as horror films goes this one is adequate. The plot is sub-standard and the acting is pitiful. Michele Hicks is supposed to be the star but her performance falls flat. She is also one of the most unattractive actresses ever. Pretty boring but if you like to watch scary movies this one will occupy you for about an hour. Unfortunately the movie is an hour and a half. At times it seems like this movie is about to pick up but it doesn't. It is one of those movies where everyone is hallucinating and seeing bodies and blood but then the scary part turns out to be a dream...etc. I am sure some of the actors in this movie want to disassociate with such a failure.,1445558400,2,670,4.2421875

8720272,1,B00ZGRMU64,A 10 year old could have written a better script. What's up with Dee Wallace these days? She looked horrible and her acting was bad community theater. Eric Roberts looked 150 years old. The plot was a hot mess. I don't even know where to start....and won't bother. 'Move on' would be my recommendation.,1502409600,,302,4.611111111111111
