8745096,5,B019G9JI3U,I love this series!! I go back to it again and again because the length is perfect for add ons and they are tough. Linda will get you in shape like no other trainer.,1494374400,,165,3.8823529411764706
8745097,5,B019G9JI3U,"What can I say!!!  Ouch in a very good way!  It was hard, but so effective!  If you don't think you are ready, don't worry.  There is a modify version and you still get a great workout from it.  I also did the easier version from time to time, and I still feel the burn!  It does feel great on my bad knee as well after I was done!  I had some knee issues in the past and for some reason, Linda's bridge work  makes my bad knee feel better!!!  My lower body is more toned and slimmer since I've been doing Linda's workout!",1464998400,2,522,3.9423076923076925
8745098,5,B019G9JI3U,"I have about 350 workout DVDs in my collection, and just LOVE this one!  It's honestly one of my all-time faves, and is fantastic if you love floorwork. If you love workouts like Ballet Beautiful's Total Body and Blast DVDs or Brazil Butt Lift's High and Tight workout, you'll love the exercises on this one.

To do this workout, you'll just need a mat and a small playground ball. She uses the ball to work the inner thighs, and yours will be screaming after you do her inner-thigh segment!

The DVD has the following segments:

  Glute Bridge - 16 Minutes
  Table Top Glutes - 16 Minutes
  Outer Thighs - 16 Minutes
  Inner Thighs - 16 Minutes
  Abs - 16 Minutes
  Stretch - 10 Minutes

It also has the following premixes:

  Glutes Only - 42 Minutes
  Thighs Only - 42 Minutes
  Glutes & Abs - 58 Minutes
  Thighs & Abs - 58 Minutes
  Glutes & Thighs - 74 Minutes

You also have the option to select ""Play All"" and to do the entire workout, which runs about 90 minutes long.

The only thing that this DVD is missing is an arms segment, but it's a fantastic lower-body workout.  I love Linda's kind, caring personality, and she is so creative and inventive about coming up with new moves for classic exercises like bridges and side-lying inner and outer thigh work.

I love Linda's workouts, and love, too, that she puts out a ton of free content on YouTube.  She's a fantastic instructor!",1458864000,3,1391,4.436
8745099,5,B019G9JI3U,"Linda Wooldridge creator of Barlates brings all the challenging aspects of Pilates and barre into her workouts, along with impeccable cueing. I have tried many of her workouts from her website and Youtube channel and she is definitely a rising star. Her workouts are challenging but you don't find yourself watching the clock. She suffers right though her workouts with you. I was an advanced exerciser with heavy weightlifting background. I am coming off a back injury so I appreciate Linda's cueing and the intensity of her workouts that are challenging to the muscles yet easy on the joints.
Now on to this DVD - I did this yesterday and found it to be my new favorite. The glute bridge segment is very challenging and doesn't let up. She works the glutes in creative ways and I am excited to see what results I will get! It is definitely the best glute bridge segment I have ever done and I have done many. I am always on the lookout for glute workouts. The table top and outer thigh segments are amazing. I felt an amazing burn with these.
Inner thigh segment was another super burner! I don't work inner thighs so today they are sore. I didn't do the ab portion because I ran out of time.
Get this DVD. You won't be sorry. I have hundreds of workouts and this is probably my all time favorite.",1453334400,9,1299,4.485232067510548
