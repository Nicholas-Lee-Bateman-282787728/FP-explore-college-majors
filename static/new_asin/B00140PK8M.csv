Two of them stop working around the middle of the card, while the third stops working around the middle of the co-main event. I read on a forum somewhere that two other customers had this same problem. I own all of the UFC dvds and this is the only time I've had problems with an event. I'm not sure if all the UFC 82 dvds have a factory default; but some of them sure do.",1344729600,,427,3.9767441860465116
8253750,5,B00140PK8M,"UFC just keeps getting better and better, and they deliver every time! UFC 82 features a middleweight championship fight between the champ Anderson ""The Spider"" Silva and Dan Henderson. Dropping down from LHW to Middleweight after losing the Pride belt to Rampage Jackson, Henderson puts his Pride middleweight belt on the line with Anderson Silva. ""He's never fought anyone like me before"" Henderson says before going to battle with the muay tai Brazilian killing machine. This fight doesn't make it to the end and was a great one while it lasted!

Also on the card is a fight between Heath Herring and Cheick Kongo with major title contentions. Kongo, coming off a huge win to Mirko Cro Cop looks to put another loss on Herrings record who was coming off his a loss to the current heavyweight champ Antonio Minotauro Nogueira. The fight goes all 3 rounds, is mostly a ground war, and a split decision is the outcome! An exciting fight to watch live, but I don't know how many times id want to see it.

The return of Evan Tanner was something for any diehard mma fan to take into consideration and watch with great interest. Coming out of a 2 year break, I was looking forward to Tanner to make his return. Too bad Okami is looking for a title shot and won't let Tanner walk through him. This fight let me down a little bit but the winner deserved it.

Talk about some great preliminary fights! Diego Sanchez, Josh Koshcheck, Luigi Fiovaranti, and Andrei Arlovski are all featured on fights and they were all great, although I believe a lot were mismatched.
