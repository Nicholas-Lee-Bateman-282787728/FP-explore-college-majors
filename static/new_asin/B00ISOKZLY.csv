8645059,5,B00ISOKZLY,"Best Godzilla Blu Ray there is! Everything on it! It has 2 menu's! And the HD is amazing! Nothing about this blu ray has a flaw on it. Way better than the American Counter Part release! I recommend this to the hard core Godzilla fans who actually want amazing quality! The Art work is great, I just wish it could have been the original classic poster art, but this is wonderful. Everybody who like's blu ray and Godzilla movies should get these types of blu rays!",1424822400,3,463,4.395348837209302
