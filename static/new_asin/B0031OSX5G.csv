4049330,5,B0031OSX5G,"I tried the first dvd of this series last night and I absolutely love it.  My bum is really feeling the burn this morning and I've been doing Tracy's mat workout for about 6 months now.  This workout has completely different moves from her mat work so you will definitely feel the burn.  It isn't a video that you can master the first time and I felt like an idiot last night attempting some of the moves but that is something I love about Tracy.  She makes her videos challenging so you have to commit to them to learn the routines and get the results you want.  I usually get bored with exercise videos but the challenge of Tracy's dvds keeps me motivated.  I find each time I do her video I learn something else and have an ""ah ha"" moment which is very rewarding.

Most people complain that Tracy speaks very little during the exercises but I love this fact especially if you do the videos over and over again.  It's incredibly annoying to learn the instructors dialogue.  These new dvds have a feature to turn the dialogue off or to switch the music off which I think is amazing for when you master the moves.  I find incredibly chatty instructors annoying so I'm looking forward to the day when I know this dvd well enough just to do it on my own with my own music selection.

I really think Tracy is a genius but like everything worth having in life, her dvds take alot of time and effort to learn and master.  I've been exercising for years and found traditional forms of fitness make me bulk up especially in the quads but Tracy's dvds give me the elongated legs that I'm after. I actually feel my hamstrings working with her dvds which is a welcome change. It will take me a while to learn these moves since they are very challenging but I'm willing to work at it.

The arm section is very fast so I plan on watching it tonight and will take some notes on the moves so I can learn it.  When I tried doing the arms last night, I couldn't really follow Tracy so I didn't feel anything in them but I'm sure once I figure out what to do, my arms will feel the burn similar to the one I get when I do her Mat work.",1269302400,7,2118,4.197530864197531
4049331,5,B0031OSX5G,"I have Tracy's Mat workout and her Post-Pregnancy workout, and am a big fan of both.  I have done all three workouts of her new Perfect Design series multiple times, and I find them all to be unique and extremely effective.  There is just something special about them.  I actually prefer them to the Mat workout, though the arm section in the Mat workout is more difficult.  Being an advanced exerciser, and someone who is not new to Tracy's Method, I started by only purchasing Sequence III, but I liked that so much that I bought Sequence II.  Once I had done that a few times, I decided that I also needed Sequence I to round out my collection.  I get a lot out of all 3 workouts in the series.  I find Sequence I to be just about as challenging as Sequences II and III, though it's technically the 'beginner' workout.  In addition, all three workouts keep my heart rate up for the majority of the workout, which is always appreciated.  I feel like I'm getting in my cardio and toning in one shot!

It is true that the arm series in each DVD is not as taxing or thorough as the arm series in her Mat workout (or the PP workout, for that matter).  I prefer to have the two separate arm sections: One without weights, and one with weights.  The PD series does not use any weights for the arms.  I also am not sure that the almost-frenetic pace of the arm movements in the PD series allows for the most effective toning. I spend too much time trying to keep up, rather than being able to feel each movement and perform it well to get the most out of the exercises.  I do feel my arms a bit while performing the exercises, but the sections aren't very long and also combine standing abs.  It seems like too much is going on, and at too fast a pace, to be getting the most out of the arm toning.  I do use weighted gloves to give the arm sections a little more oomph.

I find the ab sections to be on a par with the Mat workout.  The moves are creative and seem to target all sections of the abs well.  I especially felt the abs section in Sequence I for some reason, though I thought all of the abs sections were good.  There is a portion of the ab series in Sequence III that loses me a bit, but I'm sure I'll get the hang of it as I keep doing the workout.

The true strength of the PD series is the lower body work.  The lower body sections far surpass the Mat workout in my opinion.  I feel I really get a lot out of them.  While I never felt soreness in my lower body after doing the Mat workout, I have experienced significant lower-body soreness after doing each of the workouts in the PD series.  Even Sequence I has intense and effective lower body work.  In general, I didn't really find Sequence I to be much easier than the other two.  The main difference is that Sequence I doesn't use a chair and doesn't have standing lower body work like the other two do.

I really enjoyed all three workouts in the PD series, and I can't wait to see the long-term results that are sure to come from using them.  I have barely touched the Mat workout and the PP workout since getting the PD series, and those were my most heavily-used before.  Anyone who does these regularly is sure to see excellent results!",1269129600,45,3208,4.211475409836066
4049332,5,B0031OSX5G,I have done her previous cardio and mat dvd and in my opinion these are just as good if not better. People have complained about the arm/ab section but I feel my abs and arm muscles burning when I'm doing the chair exercises. I think if you're not doing them correctly then you are probably not feeling the burn as much. It takes time to figure out exactly what she is doing which is why you should start with series 1 then move on to 2 and 3. I work up a sweat doing the exercises more and more each day which lets me know I'm doing it the right way whereas initially I wasn't as much. She doesn't use a lot of verbal cues so you just have to practice and pay close attention to what she is doing before you get the hang of it. I have already noticed results and am able to get into my 'skinny' jeans again. I definitely recommend her method. It's the only thing that has lengthened my legs without the bulk that other exercises have done in the past. It's also way more intense and effective than pilates.,1268956800,10,1007,4.142857142857143
4049333,4,B0031OSX5G,"Well I am a really big fan of everything that Tracy Anderson has come out with- I do all her webisodes and I absolutely adore her first Mat workout and PP DVD. I had been doing similar workouts (i.e. The Bar Method, Lotte Berk, Callanetics etc.)before I caught onto TA and a lot of it isn't really anything new but I stuck around because the arm rotations are so intense and thats a big part of what was missing from all the other methods out there.
Although I bought all three sequences, I have only done the first sequence (Tracy recommends you switch every ten days). I was going to wait to write a review until I had tried all three but I see there are already a couple of reviews that are ""incomplete"" so I may as well throw in my two cents. Tracy does a voice over which I had no problem with since there is an option to leave that part out if her instruction annoys you. I personally, don't like a lot of chit chat in a workout video especially if it has little to do with form or technique. The set is a little dark which is a change of pace from her other DVD's which again is not something that bothers me. The workout: focus is mainly on glutes and abs and some of the exercises are quite different from her other videos. Sq 1 does not use a chair at all but there is some bridgework that is really for all over body toning. My bum, hips and hamstrings were on fire the next day from that alone. Arm work was okay-No weights used at all. I felt a slight burn while doing the rotations which were much faster than in her original mat DVD but I was not weakened at all the next day which is what I longed for. In essence, I'm not sorry that I purchased the set and in fact, I'm quite anxious to try out the other two workouts, but its just a hair below par from her older workouts. This will not keep me from purchasing any other DVD's she produces and it will not stop me from recommending them to others.",1268265600,27,1915,4.109333333333334
4049334,5,B0031OSX5G,"Okay i'm no exercise expert. I had her first 2 dvds (cardio and mat workout) and loved it. it was the only exercise i could keep on doing. I thought the Perfect Design series was right on par with her previous mat workout videos. this is the only strength training exercise i will ever do. I thought the voice overs were a good idea since it would be kind of awkward for her to talk and demonstrate at the same time given that some of these moves are much more difficult.

she doesn't give the best explanations...that becomes obvious but easily disregarded. i guess just 4 stars for that but i really do want to give it 5 because no one else can compare!

I wish she'd come out with new videos each year.",1268265600,9,705,4.253731343283582
4049335,4,B0031OSX5G,"This workout is about 51 minutes long and breaks down like this:
Warm-up: 4 min
Leg/Glutes: 36 min
Floor Abs: 6 min
Arms/Standing Abs: 5 min

The choreography of the moves is more advanced than her other mat workout. Many of the leg and ab exercises combine 2 or 3 different movements. There's a few moves which involve supporting part of your body weight with your arms while you work your legs. The number of different exercises is less than the original mat workout, but she does them for a much, much longer time (average 2 min). While she does many repetitions of each exercise for the leg and glute section, the opposite is true for the ab and arm work. She does very few reps for each exercise and changes her moves quickly. The arm work is combined with standing ab movements which I found very difficult to follow, especially since she moves on to different movements quickly. I didn't feel the ab or arm sequences effectively targeted my muscles as I was constantly trying to catch up with her. Also, there are no arm exercises which involve weights, which was disappointing.

The video features Tracy performing all the movements. There is definitely more instruction and cueing than in her previous videos which I was very pleased to see. There isn't much chaptering in the DVD so it you want to do a particular section, you'll have to fast forward.

I've done the workout a few times and find the leg and glute work to be outstanding. I like the added complexity of the lower body moves and the engagement of the upper body, but this may not be for everyone. I found the ab and arm sections to be a disappointment. I suppose as I master the movements, I'll get more out of it.",1268179200,49,1689,4.5130718954248366
4049336,3,B0031OSX5G,"I was thrilled when I pre-ordered the Perfect Design DVD in December. I only ordered the 3rd disc because of the cost, plus I consider myself an advanced exerciser. Tracy's Mat workout was different from any workout I'd ever tried, and I absolutely loved it. The movements flowed, it had an artsy/dancelike undertone to it - very feminine, extremely effective. Her webisodes have been up to par with her 2008 workouts, surely the PD series would meet the expectation level set by her Mat workout. Her unique arm sequences & ab sequences placed her in a new category. Results from the arm segments in the Mat workout were proof enough that she was not even comparable to other trainers(IMO).

There are several instructors with programs to help women slim down thighs/glutes, elongating the legs by creating a toned/sleek look. That's great for those who tend to be pear shaped!  I've had thin legs all my life - it takes minimal effort to tone my legs.  But arms, nothing worked to slim them down.  A toned/sleek look was something I could only dream about. Then Tracy Anderson does the impossible.  So, her Perfect Design Series focuses on glutes!?

The PD series, Tracy chooses to do voice over - seemed a little lazy. A majority of the workout is leg/glute work.  You need a sturdy chair, and you will use it....too much.  Maybe if I had the SAME chair she did, I wouldn't have been as annoyed? Sure some of the moves were unique, however, the same muscles could be worked without making it so complicated.  One positive with using the chair, you do engage your core a lot! Otherwise, it was BORING!!

Arms consisted of one segment, no weights. Because it is voice over, she makes vague comments which are of no help. The camera will focus on her face, showing the upper arm (nothing past the elbow) as she says to make sure you watch the direction her palms are facing. You can't see what her hands are doing?! She looks as if she is improvising as she goes along.  The setting is a loft with big windows at night with lights dimmed.  Not the best choice for a segment you need to really focus on. The ab work was alright, again, not up to par with her Mat workout. It wasn't challenging for me, just blah.

On a positive note, if you are new to Tracy Anderson or didn't like her Mat workout - you will most likely enjoy this!  If you are looking for some unique moves to target your lower body & enjoy chairs...this is for you =) It's still a unique workout. Seriously, great lower body work!  The ab work will be interesting as well.  A change of pace is always refreshing, and I recommend this if you haven't tried her previous workouts.

If you like & own the Mat workout, I wouldn't waste my money on this.  I'm going to stick to the Mat DVD & webisodes for now.  This seems thrown together and sloppy considering the hype around her workouts. If you wanted some arm & ab work comparable to her previous DVDs, you won't find it here.  This was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT for me.  Maybe my expectations were too high?",1268006400,85,3020,4.484460694698354
4049347,2,B0031OSX5G,boring,1425427200,,6,6.0
4049348,2,B0031OSX5G,I love her approach in theory but there is just no good way to follow her and get the benefits! She doesn't cue so you have to watch her even when she says keep your head in alignment with your spine and look down. Then she changes the move without telling you! Frustrating.,1425081600,3,274,4.188679245283019
4049349,4,B0031OSX5G,Fantastic longer stronger love the method!!! I feel like this is me and just what my muscles need. My head feels so clear!! Thanks so much Tracey,1424649600,,145,4.407407407407407
4049350,1,B0031OSX5G,No rhyme or reason. I want to love her videos but I just can't. She's just making up moves at random and I'm not sure how you're supposed to follow that. So there's no choreography whatsoever. I guess you have to just keep doing it and learn her absurd movements. I'm a fitness trainer and I love to get new DVDs  and new materials for classes. I'm literally addicted. So I even tried a few others thinking she's done such a great job with so many clients she has to be amazing right? But she has zero personality and flailing her arms and legs around it just first of all isn't safe if you have back issues. Seems like there is no proper alignment. And she doesn't give any instruction so she's not telling you about proper movements or alignments or even modifications. Just really disappointed. Too bad.,1422921600,4,806,4.445945945945946
4049351,5,B0031OSX5G,My favorite!,1421884800,,12,5.5
4049352,3,B0031OSX5G,"I would probably give this more of a 2.5 star if I could.  The moves themselves I don't mind and are effective - I could feel the burn, BUT she is totally boring.  I personally did not care watching someone who did not smile, no facial expression, looked bored, and her voice when she did comment on how to do a move was ""bleh"".  I tried for two weeks to push through her style of workout but couldn't do it.

When it comes down to it you have to find an instructor whose style works for you.  My style is Jillian Michaels I have found, so to follow Tracy Anderson was not enough to keep me interested.",1421798400,3,602,4.111111111111111
4049353,5,B0031OSX5G,Tracy totally changed my body !!!Thank you Tracy .I love the design series !!,1415145600,,77,4.571428571428571
4049354,5,B0031OSX5G,"So I started doing Tracy's workouts in April after being devoted to Jillian for several months.  The problem with Jillian is that I kept getting injuries in my knees and hips, and I actually had to take about a month off of working out, which is torture for me.  So anyway, I started with Tracy Anderson's Method for Beginners to see what Tracy's workouts are like, as I had read so many negative reviews, which I now think are absurd.

I have worked my way through all three PDS DVDs, and I just love them.  PDS 3 is just fantastic, such a challenging workout.  I still have to modify the plank move she does with the chair, as my knees just aren't strong enough yet.  I don't know if I would exactly classify these as cardio, but my heart rate gets up, and I certainly get sweaty.  Thanks to Tracy, I am getting excellent definition in my legs and abs.  My only complaint about PDS 3 is that I wish Tracy included more standing abs and arms.  To me, standing abs and arms is what really set Tracy apart from others, and I get killer results from these.

For this workout, you will need a chair without arms and a good thick yoga mat.  I recommend working out in front of mirrors with Tracy, as performing the moves correctly is crucial to getting the best results, and also to avoid injury.

I work out with TAM 5-6x a week.  I don't exactly follow her formula, which is to do a DVD for 10 days, then move on to the next DVD.  I mix everything up; for example, one day I might do dance cardio and throw in arms and abs from Precision Toning, one day do PDS or the Mat Workout.  Also, I haven't abandoned the earlier PDS videos.  Last night I did PDS 2 with arm and ankle weights, and HOLY COW what a workout.  Tracy is the best, and the naysayers just don't know what they are talking about!",1410739200,12,1793,4.211143695014663
4049355,4,B0031OSX5G,Like it but you need to add cardio workout to your routine if you want to see good result.,1410307200,,90,3.789473684210526

4049373,5,B0031OSX5G,Tracy's workouts are very challenging only because of the 20-40 number of reps per exercise. I definitely feel that part I worked out every time and that exactly what I want so I know it's working.,1383696000,7,197,4.5
4049374,1,B0031OSX5G,"She has no foundation, basis or any basic functional anatomy to support her claims. And she is so busy being totally in love with herself that she doesn't cue or explain the exercises.  They are just bizarre movements that seem to be made up as she goes along.

4049378,5,B0031OSX5G,highly recommend this dvd. very difficult but well worth it. i would consider this pretty advanced as the leg portions of this are very hard. The only thing i did not like is Tracy does not say how often to do this a week. Her other dvds she sts to do 6 days a week. I have found that if I do this 4 days in a row without a day off that my hip flexors are very sore and tight.,1380672000,8,376,3.654320987654321
4049379,4,B0031OSX5G,I like this DVD. I work out daily and intensely and this was very challenging for me. They are high reps on all the movements which get's a bit monotonous but I was pleasantly sore the next day and I worked up a good sweat.,1372291200,,223,3.977777777777778
4049380,4,B0031OSX5G,Love how the moves make my legs and butt look slimmer.  Some moves are tough and had to build up to all the reps.

Still a great dvd and would recommend to anyone trying to get slim and toned legs without the bulk.,1358121600,,324,4.095238095238095
4049381,3,B0031OSX5G,"I adore my previous Tracy Anderson dvds & do like this series but there are some huge production mistakes! First, Tracy does not instruct while she performs but overlays a canned speech twice, one for each leg,  and she even says ""for the right leg"" twice not mentioning the left leg. The worst part is she does not tell you to switch moves so when you're doing moves looking at the floor you have to keep looking up to see that she's moved on to other moves or switched legs. Then the cameraman keeps doing close ups of her on the arm work cutting off essential detailed arm moves AND there's a blinding spotlight reflection in our eyes! So we're blinded and can't see her arms or feet movements while she stresses to pay attention to and learn her detailed hand and arm movements. When the camera shows her full on we can easily see everything perfectly. I think the cameraman thought he was making slick visual interest but really ruined a larger percentage of the arm work parts on all 3 videos. Where was the editor on this? It's not practical for real life workouts. They should have had real people use the videos before they released them on a large scale. The content is still good but these are not as easy to watch & use day in and day out as the first series that Tracy made. They have a high annoyance factor.",1307577600,9,1322,4.373983739837398
4049382,4,B0031OSX5G,"Although it has been a few years, my background in dance and yoga is extensive. I agree with some of the reviews for Tracy's other dvd's that state that the instruction is limited. I agree that without an understanding of what the proper form is, you could get injured. I rated it four stars because I really love the work outs. I also have the second dvd in this series and the original mat workout. If you have a fitness background it is an incredible workout that sneaks up on you. For me, her approach is smart, unique and fun. It is the perfect addition to my regime.",1299369600,6,572,4.305555555555555

There is essentially no instructions on how to do the moves when she is standing and so I just sat on the couch trying to figure out how I was going to learn it.  I think you would be better off getting her book and doing to moves she has explained.  I think she has a great idea, but this is not worth the money.",1295481600,,486,3.878787878787879
4049385,5,B0031OSX5G,"Wow, is this series kicking my butt - literally!  This is the first product review I have ever written and I was compelled to do so because of all the negative reviews I read online about Tracy Anderson.  I purchased her Matt DVD a few months back which was a great workout even though she was a little strange to watch.  I needed some fresh routines so ordered this series.  Her routines have changed my body in a way NO OTHER workouts ever have.  I have tried P90x, Slim in 6, ChaLean Extreme, 30 Day Shred w/weights and many other similar workouts.  Every move she has you do works multiple muscle groups, and not in the way, for example, ChaLean has you doing bicep curls at the same time you're doing lunges.  Tracy has you moving repetitively in a way that forces you to seriously balance yourself at the same time.  My core is engaged (almost without realizing I'm doing it) and even when doing the moves on one leg, I am working the other leg at the same time - or my arms, shoulders, back, etc.  I have literally laughed out loud at some of the moves, thinking ""No way can I do that!"", but after some practice, my body figured it out.  I used to get sore in specific areas after what I call the ""old style"" workouts - with hers, you are not.  You feel refreshed, ready to go again the next day.  AND - you get results!!  Love her standing ab routines, again seeing results like never before - why is she the first fitness expert to do these???  And for those that seem really angry about her commments of ""not bulking"" - my body type cannot bulk, never has, no matter how many weights I lifted.  However, my muscles never really responded to the weight routines either.  This approach works for my body(basically repetition and low weights), and considering I'm 41, to finally find an approach that works is like a miracle.  Everyone's body is different, so if lifting weights and doing hundreds of squats and lunges has never reduced your hip size, try Tracy Anderson.  If your anything like me, you will be thrilled.  FYI -  I have not done her cardio dance routine, my results have come from her Matt DVD and this series only.",1294185600,3,2138,4.405612244897959
4049386,4,B0031OSX5G,"I have just started Design II, and I feel like I have enough information to pass along to curious folks out there! I do like the way her moves make you feel. I do think they change your body for the better.  I am weirdly tired after doing her dvd workouts.  I am an avid exerciser, (6 days a week), so I try to do her dvds 3x a week.  It is a large time commitment, though, because they are so long.  I would love if she came out with an ""express"" workout.  I agree with others who have reviewed her new series.  She goes extremely fast, does one type of move on the right, and something different on the left.  It is very hard to keep up with the arms and standing abs portion, ( I prefer the instruction and pace of the Mat dvd along with other reviewers.)As far as the setting and music, it is not awesome..some of the music is strange, and the studio she works out in is a tad gloomy.  This is a tough workout, for sure, though.  I would say if you are a fan of her other dvds and ""know"" how she operates, definately give it a try.  If you are a first time tracy anderson person, get the Mat dvd first:)",1292976000,2,1107,3.9909090909090907
4049387,4,B0031OSX5G,"Although I found this video extremely challenging, (Being middle-aged and not as flexible as I once was!) it does deliver results. Sadly, no weight loss as of yet, although I have only been doing it for 3 weeks, but I have definitely seen results in muscle tone and skin tone in my thighs.",1286064000,12,289,4.471698113207547
4049388,3,B0031OSX5G,"I've been using this DVD for a couple of months now and it definitely gets results. The only problem is I can only go along with about half of each DVD. When she gets to doing arms and standing abs, I get lost every time. She doesn't slow the movements down to show you what you're actually doing and she goes so fast that when I finally get the moves right, she's moved on to the next one. The DVD itself is pretty low-budget for how much each individual DVD costs. Overall, I would say this is great for toning your legs and butt. I've had noticeable toning and definition from using these. The abdominal work she does on the floor works really well too, but only if you pause the DVD and add a few more reps to each move. I like the moves, they are unique and certainly not boring , but if you want fast and optimum results, use it in conjunction with either another workout DVD or your own strength training regimen.",1280188800,7,920,4.232954545454546
4049389,5,B0031OSX5G,"I am 40 years old, and have been exercising since my early 20s.  I consider myself to be in pretty good shape, but after 2 babies, I never thought my lower stomach would be totally flat again.  When I heard that Tracy claimed that her workout would not only get those trouble spots in shape, but that she could also pull in your loose skin, I was skeptical, but I love a tough workout, so I started with her mat workout.  Loved the results - my butt has never looked better, and my stomach actually started pulling smoother and taut - not quite back to the way it was, but better than I'd ever though it would be again without surgery.  My arms are also thinner - I've actually lost a bit of the bulkiness that had come about from too much weight training.  I actually bought a bikini - something I thought I'd never do again. I can't wait to see how much more these trouble spots might change with continued practice.

The thing about Tracy is that you have to really practice her workouts and get to know her moves.  Her cueing isn't the best, though I find that this is only annoying when you are first learning the video.  I like it that she jumps right in, which keeps the workout challenging even after you've done it several times.  With consistent practice, you start to wake up those smaller muscle groups, and you really get in touch with how they feel, so you can still get a good workout just by learning to control them a little bit more each time.

I love this series.  I am still working up to being able to do all of the exercises on the third video, but I find that the first two are still challenging and get me great results as well.  I break a full-on sweat from these, as if I were doing heavy cardio - they are challenging.

I have been so happy with the results I've been getting from these videos.  You have to stick with them, but the results are amazing.  Give it at least a month - you will see your body changing.",1280102400,12,1941,4.222222222222222
4049390,5,B0031OSX5G,"I've been doing Tracy's Method for a while, starting out with the Mat DVD. I bought the entire Perfect Design Series and wanted to wait to review until I'd done all three. It is a lot of butt work and a little arm and ab work. All three are around 50 minutes and you WILL feel it. That being said my arms, abs and butt have never looked better. My husband has even noticed and he typically doesn't notice anything.

I recommend starting out with her Mat DVD or the Post Pregnancy DVD and getting Tracy's moves down before starting the Perfect Design Series. They are numbered for a reason so start with I and do that DVD until you get it down. She wants you to switch it up every 10 days to confuse your muscles, so just when you think you've got it down, switch.

Overall, there are some mistakes in the instructions as others have said and IIIs editing is really bad. She does move really fast in all three so you will have to pay attention but I feel like, if I can do it, most anyone can as well. I like that you can turn off her instruction or the music if you want. They will definately challenge you. I have recommended them to several friends and will continue to say nothing but good things about Tracy's Method, of course these DVDs and the Tracy Anderson Method may not be for everyone.",1279411200,6,1297,4.246963562753036
4049391,3,B0031OSX5G,"I love Tracy Anderson's post-pregnancy DVD and her Mat DVD so I had high expectations for this series.  Although I am not sorry I purchased them, I do not find them comparable to the post-pregnancy and Mat DVD. The moves are typical Tracy Anderson style, which is great, always original, and produce fantastic results but it was lacking ""personality."" I found it dark and depressing, from the voiceover down to the dark gray outfit she was wearing, to the view of the dark city from the window. Everything just felt dark. With that being said, I am still a fan. However, if you had to pick a dvd I would buy the post-pregnancy and/or Mat DVD. I hope this is helpful.",1278374400,10,666,4.5041322314049586
4049392,4,B0031OSX5G,"I am an avid workout at home junkie, I have many different at home workouts from many different sources, love them all and this only adds another great series of DVDs to my collection.  I was looking for something different and this does provide that for me.  She does an arm workout that is awesome, in fact it is so close to the belly dance classes I took, that is why I like it.  Alot of the movements remind me of a series of gyro-tonics, Pilate and belly dance classes I took for the arms and core.  But I am saving money by doing this at home. The one thing I was a bit confused about by ordering the 3 disc set I thought I was getting her dance workout and mat workout as part of the set.  I think Disc 1 is the mat workout but I cannot verify it, and the dance workout apparently is another cost to the 3 I just ordered, so I will not be getting that. I'll review more when I get to the other discs in the set.",1274227200,2,918,3.9405405405405407
4049393,4,B0031OSX5G,"I discovered Tracy from Gwyneth Paltrow's GOOP newsletter and my first taste of Tracy's workouts were her 3 webisodes to benefit Malawi. I especially love the arm and ab workout, but struggled with the amount of reps in the butt and thigh workout. I purchased the Perfect Design Series because I know Tracy wants you to change up the routine every 10 days and I thought this sequence would give me the variety I need. I have done both sequence I and II quite often and I love both of them. Like other reviewers have mentioned, the arm workout is not very intense and her movements are quick and a bit hard to keep up with. The butt and thigh portions are challenging and I have noticed a difference. The ab section is good, too. I'm still working myself up to sequence III because I tried it once and most of it was very challenging. I'm working on perfecting I and II, so I can do sequence III. I've also ordered her Mat DVD and beginner dance cardio to supplement my other DVD's. Tracy is great and I love that she explains why she does what she does. I appreciate that she focuses on a long and lean body that isn't too muscular. I also like that her Perfect Design series offers the option to remove the voiceover and music.

However I found out, after my workout, that it did not challenged my the way it did. Same comparison with Callanetics, Lotte Berke, etc. Except with the New York City Ballet workout that i practice from time to time for a change. Otherwise, it is only Tracy anderson method. This new series (Perfect design) is a fun change that i practice, say, once a week. The rest of the week, i practice an adapted version of the original mat workout, cut to fit into a 30 minute time. That is perfect. No cardio workout. I work outside all day long, on my feet, a very challenging job, i have enough of the mat workout to make me fit for my daily challenge. With the Tracy Anderson method, i am leaner and stronger than i have even been in all my life of practicing workout!!! Bravo Tracy!!!",1272585600,4,920,4.385964912280702
4049395,5,B0031OSX5G,"I'm in my late 30s, am very active and have been working out since I was 17 but was not seeing the results I wanted so I started doing the matt series about a year ago and have been really happy with it.  Tracy's method really helped tone and lengthen my limbs and I never had a problem with her method of instruction or the kind of work she does in the video.

Since I consider myself relatively advanced, I ordered the third part of the series first.  I was a little intimidated when I quickly watched what I was in for, but was hooked after the first go.  I'm naturally small on top so I was relieved to NOT have to spend what I always considered to be a lot of time concentrating on arms as she does in the original matt workout.  What I really like about this dvd is that I feel like she's using the whole body more intensely than she had before rather than delineating work to a certain areas.  I also feel like this workout is more condensed than the matt workout and you accomplish more in less time.

I went ahead and ordered the series II dvd to have some variation with my workout and although it is easier than III, I still really enjoyed the format of the video and felt like I was getting more of a comprehensive workout than I ever did with the original matt series.  Since I am more or less advanced I didn't think anything of not sweating or getting my heart rate up through the matt workout but with both of the perfect design videos I've done I can certainly feel it and even more so the next day.",1272326400,8,1516,4.150170648464163
4049396,3,B0031OSX5G,"Hi
I have her Perfect Design Series.  I absolutely LOVE them and the results are great if you do them regularly.

She does not talk to you directly or looks at the camera at all. She uses a voiceover, which is fine, but I do think it distances her from us even more.

I do feel she makes some rookie mistakes though (I don't think she is a trained trainer):

- most workout dvds 'mirror' you so you can easily follow their movements. Tracy does not, she uses her right leg and talks about you using 'your' right leg
- she still fails to cue you in especially when you are not looking at the dvd e.g. during the floor stomach exercises - before you are aware she has already changed sides and you have missed 4 or 5 reps!
- I have not counted the reps for each side yet, but I am sure like her first mat dvd the reps are not even
- she does not give you any options for the harder moves - there are some moves that you need to be able to carry your own weight - not eveyone will be able to

I have her mat dvd prior to these new ones, and it had a FANTASTIC arm workout. These dvds lack in the arm department unfortunately (she focuses mainly on the legs).  The arm workout nearly borders on luancy where the movements are so quick without ANY cueing that you would need to do the dvd many times before you get it right.  It would be something you could figure out naturally if there was a natural 'pattern' to the arm routine, but there is not (therefore she may do 3 movements on one arm and then 1 on the other - so no pattern).

She has also incorporated her arm routine with her standing ab workout, even more to think about!

Don't get me wrong, I love the dvds, but you have to be prepared to keep up with them.

You need to try them out for yourself. :)",1272153600,13,1760,4.017191977077364
8387140,2,B0031OSX5G,I loved Perfect Design 1 and 2 but very disappointed in this one-several awkward moves and didn't feel the workout flowed well like the first 2-also didn't feel a burn so did another mini workout after completing this. Also felt she moved way too fast on the arms and abs segment and even though I'm familiar with her moves I felt so clumsy and rushed like I was always trying to catch up on one side and she was already on to the next. I loved the use of the chair in Perfect Design 2 but in this one the chair seemed in the way and made a few moves seem so strange and I could not figure out if I was doing them correctly-doubt if I'll use this again,1509062400,,652,4.023076923076923

The moves are really tough but make you feel great.  I haven't made it even close to completing the whole thing.  It will probably take me a couple of months to do so.  When extending your legs, make sure to point your toes and ""extend your energy beyond your toes"".  That makes all the difference.  Her workouts are addicting because you can see and feel results immediately.  My goal is to work up to completing this whole video.  Don't start with this one, or you'll get discouraged quickly.  My legs were burning the next day and I didn't even do all of the leg work.  She's a tiny beast to be able to do this workout.",1494547200,,760,4.28169014084507
