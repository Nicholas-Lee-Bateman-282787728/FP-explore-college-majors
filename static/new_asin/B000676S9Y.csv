2171185,5,B000676S9Y,"I recently bought this program and I'm really enjoying it. I like to do Pilates before my daily Yoga practice to warm up my core and to provide a different type of challenge than Yoga provides.

 These programs remind me a lot of Yoga Zone's format in that they are about 22 minutes (Yoga Zones are about 20), they are set in a beautiful tropical location(Barbados) and the instruction is creative and fun to work with. The instructors have upbeat personalities without being ""rah rah"" and they are inspiring to workout with.

 Jennifer Tilley is the lead instructor with Shelly McDonald following along and sometimes showing modifications.

 I found these to be something that an experienced beginner in Pilates would be able to do. The routines have moderately challenging moments but are not overly intense overall so that they aren't intimidating to work with.

 Either way, I'd highly recommend starting with Stott Pilates Basics (or something like that) to learn the principles of Pilates more in depth in order to stay safe and to learn where to focus your attention in Pilates.

 I am more Intermediate/Advanced in Pilates but found these programs to be a joy to practice with. I love having this program (which was actually part of a very reasonably priced two DVD set, which altogether has 8-22 minute workouts) as a fun way to add variety into my Pilates practice.

 These are taken from a TV program so there are commercial breaks which fade in and out from one segment to another, sometimes they are edited better than others, but honestly they didn't present any problem at all.

 This is definitely the best Pilates buy I've made in terms of what you get for your money.

 Still, if you want to get a really incredible, more classical program to use as part of your home Pilates practice, I'd also recommend Hilary Burnett's Intermediate DVD which is a 30 minute program that has the complete Intermediate Pilates series (as found in Alycea Ungaros ""Pilates, Body In Motion"") as well as several exercises from the Advanced Series.

 Highly recommended!",1143331200,9,2067,4.857142857142857
2171186,4,B000676S9Y,"I bought this DVD in a 2 DVD set today with the Carribean

Workout Pilates Plus at Walmart.  I have just finished watching both DVD's and tried a few of the moves with the tapes and must say that I am very impressed.  Being a long-time yoga person, I am usually not pleased with any Pilates tapes I've tried, including Winsor Pilates, mainly because I've always felt that the routines are dull and/or potentially harmful to my slightly delicate lower back.  But I have to say that I feel I will be able to follow these tapes with no fears of back injury.  I especially like the fact that there is a total of 8 workouts in this set and each one is approx. 20 minutes long.  Very do-able for a busy person such as myself.  I think I will do a different workout each time and thus stave off any possible boredom.  The tapes are very well instructed with two very likable ladies demonstrating the routine in a very friendly and encouraging, non-intimidating manner and the Barbados location is beautiful.  The only thing that kept me from giving this set a 5 star rating is the breaks where obviously the commercials would be placed for the television series, which I have never seen, by the way.  If the routines were presented uninterupted, I feel these would be very worthy of five stars.  But nevertheless, I would recommend these tapes to anyone who wants to try a very do-able, complete Pilates routine, but found themselves intimidated by other such workout tapes.  I think it was money (and very little at that) very well spent.",1111449600,8,1532,4.5510948905109485
2171187,5,B000676S9Y,"I like this a lot, I haven't really done a pilates workout that I could go through the whole thing. I really like this and also the Pilates Plus- I haven't gotten to that one yet. I watched both of them and the instructor has a soothing voice that is very instructive. It is kind of annoying with the cutouts but that's alright. I never watched this on TV. But it is quite good. If you are looking for an easy workout- for beginners then you should definitely buy this. I bought the set of pilates and pilates plus together at Walmart. If you are lookin for a challenging workout, then get the plus only. This seems definitely for the beginner for the regular pilates workout. Hope you all agree.",1110412800,7,696,4.361538461538461

8039615,4,B000676S9Y,The work outs were well balanced with variety across work outs.  I liked the easy conversational style while giving good pointers for improvement.  The video recording could have been better.  Many times Jen would be explaining a move and the video was on her face.

8039619,3,B000676S9Y,"If you are looking for a Pilates challenge you may be interested in the four workouts presented on this DVD. To be honest there are also quite a few reasons not to buy this workout. If you don't mind commercial breaks or exercises being repeated throughout the short routines then you might enjoy the challenging Pilates and Yoga exercises. For beginners I'd recommend anything by ""Jennifer Kries""  or ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Winsor-Pilates-3-DVD-Workout-Set-Basic-20-Minute-Workout-Accelerated-Body-Sculpting/dp/B00077BD7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Winsor Pilates 3 DVD Workout Set  {Basic, 20 Minute Workout, Accelerated Body Sculpting}</a>."" The four workouts on this DVD are definitely designed for intermediate students of Pilates.

Workout 1

A beautiful pool in Barbados is the setting for the first workout. After completing a version of ""Mermaid"" the exercises that follow present an intermediate challenge. You will be working your core muscles while focusing on the abs. A Teaser follows and then you move into Spine Stretch Forward, Roll Ups, Swan and Swimming.

Workout 2

If you want more than 20 minutes you can go on to the second workout. Immediately you will notice a repeat of some of the same exercises that you learned in the first workout. The exercises include an advanced Roll Over, One Leg Circles, Bridge, Reverse Plank, Swan, Open Leg Rocker and Spine Rotations.

Workout 3

The workout starts with a modified plank and then moves into a leg pull and cat stretch. At this point they start to take a lot of commercial breaks which breaks up the workout slightly. Fortunately you don't have to wait through any commercials and the exercises begin again fairly quickly. This workout is on a beautiful beach. The exercises include Scissors, Lower Back Stretches, Leg Pull, Swimming, Advanced Pus Ups and Pendulum.

Workout 4

By the time you reach the fourth workout you are ready to stretch so this works out perfectly. This is a combination of Yoga and Pilates. The exercises begin with a lunge and a Yoga mat is handy at this point. There is a repeat of Arm Circles and Scissors. The advanced roll over appears again and there are some back stretches (Cat/Cow). At this point a little counting wouldn't hurt and one instructor looks like she is about to fall into the pool. The session ends with Leg Circles, a Leg Side Series (you will feel the burn), Spine Rotations and a relaxing Hip Opener.

Once you complete all four workouts you will feel like you had a good full-body workout. This workout would be much better if the instructor had resisted repeating the same exercises numerous times. I would only recommend this to you if you are extremely patient and are also looking for some challenging Pilates exercises.

8039620,1,B000676S9Y,"If you actually want to do pilates - even something on a very beginner level - DO NOT get this DVD.  The workout was cheaply taken from television and placed on DVD hastily just to make some money - they even left in the commercial breaks.  Leaving in the commercials totally ruins the workout  - it fades in and out from these commercials into the middle of exercises - forcing you to quickly catch up and figure out which move the instructor is doing.  It doesn't give you a chance to go into the move properly, and the breaks make you pause and wait between moves - which ruins the flow of the workout.  There are so many great pilates workouts out there that there is no reason on earth to buy this DVD.  I highly recommend either the Stott Pilates series or the Giam Pilates series.  Both companys have TONS of workouts at every level, and with a huge variety of workout aides (ball, flexbands, ring) for increased challenge.  This workout is literally a waste of money.",1184198400,4,975,4.438202247191011
