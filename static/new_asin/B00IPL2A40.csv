8644528,1,B00IPL2A40,"No one who's familiar with Desert Island Classics' DVDs will be surprised to hear that this DVD looks terrible; it's badly cropped, and it's so blurry that I sometimes had trouble telling people from furniture. Even worse, despite the description that promises English language, the whole movie is in Italian, with no subtitles or dubbing. So, if you don't speak Italian, you're out of luck. (And even if you do, you won't be able to see what's going on half the time anyway.)",1412294400,,476,4.746987951807229
