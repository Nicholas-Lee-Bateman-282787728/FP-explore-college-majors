8583409,3,B00CMFTN0E,Willem loves these videos; he watched the trailers over and over again when he doesn't have time to watch the whole thing.  He knows all the drivers and probably has more dirt bike toys than Toys R Us!  PatNH,1391558400,,208,4.3076923076923075
8583410,5,B00CMFTN0E,"My three year old grandson loves ""motor cross"", we rented it just in case it was full of commentary and not a lot of action to keep his attention. He and I were thrilled that it was full of action set to, what I call rock, music.  One song was ""scremo"" as he calls it which he yelled, "" nana, uncles's song!""  :)  any way he watched it everyday. I'm 45 and I liked it too :)",1376956800,,374,3.831168831168831
