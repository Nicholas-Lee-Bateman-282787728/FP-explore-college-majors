8510183,3,B0074NDNGY,"This isn't going to excite you or scar you but it is an interesting storyline. It's a  sort of a film arts student B movie. No cinematography, set dressing, clothes were probably the actors clothes, no special lighting and  bad(simple) special effects. Just people in an apartment with a  so so story line going on.
It really could have bin told much better for better understanding of what's really going on. They should have had  different and better actors and atmospher also just to make it more interesting.

Scribe Jack Jones is delivered a magical bottle of blood to inspire a muse of deathly proportions to him  write his next novel, Try to outwit that plot Bucko.

This film is actually pretty entertaining in a most macabre fashion, With dead hookers to boot.
