I didn't see anything excitingly new or compelling that would justifiy the review that I read before buying.  Nina Hartley has some really well done instructional videos.",1314144000,3,337,4.87719298245614
8435579,5,B001POKBSQ,"As a single male, for many years the POV or Point Of View market of Adult Entertainment held my interest the most. The camera angles are such that you are seeing
what the lucky male actor is seeing while ""doing his thing"" with the female performer in the video. There are many such products on the market these days, but this
DVD goes beyond all the rest. How you ask ? It actually teaches you how to give and get pleasure during an intimate encounter with the opposite sex. This product
seeks to help Adults wishing to involve themselves in more healthy sexual encounters by giving and receiving a more moving experience during the act of love-making.
I highly endorse this product for singles as well as for mature, consenting, adult couples who want more out of their love life. Ring that Bell !!!",1282953600,4,800,4.5625
