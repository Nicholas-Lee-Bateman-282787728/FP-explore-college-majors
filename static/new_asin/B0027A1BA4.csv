3862997,3,B0027A1BA4,This documentary is as much of a mess as The Gentleman's life. I was hoping for a solid well put together story much like Heroes of World Class. WRONG,1377388800,,150,4.206896551724138
3862998,4,B0027A1BA4,"Great insight into Chris Adams downfall. Would have been nice if it would have concentrated on his good side too. Plus I think talking to his killer was horrible! Yeah Chris was on something that night but the ""friend"" who killed him didn't sound upset that he was forced to end Chris's life. It's a good movie if your a fan though. Very Recommended!",1357862400,,350,4.484375
3862999,5,B0027A1BA4,"Very disturbing accounts into the darker side of Chris Adams' life...I'm sure the accountability of some of the people is questionable, like Pam Hernandez (whom looked like she fired up a doobie or popped a few pills prior to her sit down interview from the crack houses of Tyler) or the stripper Laurie (whom is obviously loaded up on meth, coke, & whatever else she could snort up)",1357862400,,383,4.647058823529412
3863000,5,B0027A1BA4,"I have been a fan of both WCCW and of Chris Adams.  Growing up in the 80's I always looked forward to watching World Class and seeing my heroes Chris Adams and the Von Erichs.  Slowly tragedy struck the superstars of World Class and we lost several great superstars: David, Mike, Gino, Chris, Kerry, and finally Chris Adams.  This story tells the untold story of the man behind the character we all thought we knew and loved.  It shows fans how drugs and alcohol destroyed the stars of World Class and robbed the world of some wonderful entertainers.  This film serves as a warning to those who dabble in drugs and/or alcohol and the negative effects it can have on your life and the lives of those around you.  Love the character of ""The Gentleman"" Chris Adams, just don't emulate  his life.",1354579200,3,792,4.535211267605634
3863001,5,B0027A1BA4,"This is a good insight to the dark days of Chris Adams. My how the mighty have fallen. From big Star to an Independent worker to drugs and abuse in Strip Clubs, and a weird scene of reality for Adams. The World Class Curse continues....",1351382400,,236,4.266666666666667
3863002,3,B0027A1BA4,"I made the decision to view, this as a rental, on Amazon. It was my first rental and I don't know if the terrible connection was my new computer or with Amazon. Although the video is worth watching I was glad I viewed it as a rental and didn't have to sit in anticipation for it's arrival. It was a very well made documentary and it's worth watching just to see his ""stripper"" friend. These were everyday people telling the story of their lost friend including a Kevin Von Erich who didn't bother to get out of the hot tub to do the interview. I can only give it 3 stars because there was nothing truly outstanding about the material. I'd like to see a series of these featuring World Class Wrestling stars like Gino Hernandez.",1295654400,,727,4.352941176470588
3863003,4,B0027A1BA4,"great documentary on one of the best wrestlers during the world class era of pro wrestling back in the early-mid eighty's. i only wish there was more than just one match under the extra's menu, but the 1 match given was awesome, the good ole cotton bowl hair vs hair match with chris and gino against the von erichs, this match is show in full from entrances to head shaves",1258243200,,373,4.3428571428571425
3863004,2,B0027A1BA4,"This is an interesting story and worth telling. I saw the documentary on the Von Erichs and World Class and loved it. I thought this movie was being done by the same person. Obviously after watching it it was not. The World Class/Von Erich documentary 'Heroes of World Class' is fantastic. This is worth watching if you were a fan but don't expect it to be anywhere near as good. There are some interesting things in there about the drug GHB and its abuse. Hated and found the music and the quick cutaways during the documentary very annoying.

This is a documentary about some very unpleasant and unsavory people. It is a story of a rise to stardom and the inevitable fall leading to tragedy. Couldn't wait for it to come out when I saw the trailer but then when I got it I just didn't think it was that good. I even rewatched it the next day and again after writing my initial review. Perhaps it is unfair to compare it to the 'Heroes of World Class' documentary but it is my honest reaction. Just one mans opinion.",1250553600,,1017,4.380952380952381
3863005,5,B0027A1BA4,"This film by far is one of the best real life documentaries that I have seen on a professional athlete from any sport and for certain professional wrestling.

Chris Adams at one time was a superstar, through this film you get to look into the life of someone that was once famous and loses their glory going through life. It is incredible the amount of damage that one can do to themselves by not choosing their friends and path in life wisely.

This film is exciting and worth while to see. Even if you are not a wrestling fan you will enjoy this documentary which journeys through ones life that ultimately leads them to a tragic death.

Job well done to the Director Mickey Grant! This was well put together!",1240876800,4,711,4.453846153846154
3863006,5,B0027A1BA4,"This movie was compelling to me for many reasons.  The raw, reality of the people involved and how Mickey Grant tried to expose every side to this tragic story of Chris Adams.

This is as gritty as it gets, and possibly closest to the truth we will ever see in Chris's tragic murder.  From speaking to ex wives, wrestlers and the even the man who shot Chris, you feel like you are on the inside, sometimes a little too deep.

Two thumbs up for Mickey Grant. If you're a wrestling fan you will love this film, if not you will be touched by the tragic story of a man who was revered as a superstar but who's life was cut short with bad life choices.

8354328,4,B0027A1BA4,"Growing up with WCCW, I was intrigued as to what had happened to Chris Adams. As I got older, my interest in professional wrestling waned, but my childhood memories are still vivid following that great organization. Though the production value is not particularly high, it is obviously not a high dollar production, it is still a very informative glimpse into the dark side of Chris Adams lives. The people interviewed were candid and i felt honest, thought that girl at the strip club seemed to be tweaking the whole time. I particularly liked that they interviewed Gary Hart, one of the greatest influences in professional wrestling, especially in the WCCW. The music for the interview stat sheets seemed out of place. Overall it was a personal, candid look at the events that led to Chris Adams' tragic and sad end.",1409961600,,818,4.85

8354330,3,B0027A1BA4,The subject was thoroughly covered and it was done in a way that was consistent with WCCW fans and programing.,1397865600,,110,4.55
8354331,1,B0027A1BA4,"I am a fan of professional wrestling, its history, and (sometimes to my shame) the controversial elements that live within that history. One story I've looked forward to hearing was that of Chris Adams. I'm big on documentary films, especially retrospective pieces involving professional wrestling, so I took a chance on it, and paid the hefty $20 price tag (I generally buy used items, but the story intrigued me).

I thought the entire project was sloppy. The ""stat sheet"" type graphics that would pop-up 10-20 seconds after each new person would speak was distracting, the location of the interviews was distracting (Ex-wife sitting on a spacious park lawn, Von Erich in a jacuzzi the whole time, etc), the fact that many of the people being interviewed were done so over different periods of time made it a harder than it should have been to keep up with. In many cases (especially with the women), their appearances changed. Lastly, This documentary looks like it was shot on a $100 camera, and no budget. Sometimes that can be magic, this wasn't one of those times.",1381881600,,1071,4.852459016393443
