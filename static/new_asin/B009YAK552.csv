8545212,3,B009YAK552,"This is essentially a German retelling of Cormac McCarthy's The Road. It is obviously dubbed, competently in places and hilariously inept in others (esp. the crowd scenes). The acting is quite good, and the scenic design very good. Since it all takes place in a post-apocalyptic 2016, its time has come and gone. It's very depressing, of course, and functions more as a horror movie than anything else, but you can sit through it. It was produced by Roland Emmerich, but it's more intelligent than that would suggest.",1493942400,,517,4.886363636363637

8545214,4,B009YAK552,"I bought this because of the low cost and I like post-apocalyptic movies.
How could I pass one by named ""Apocalypse""  I knew nothing about but I am glad I bought it.
BTW: This is an excellent seller of DVDs.",1399939200,,207,4.175
