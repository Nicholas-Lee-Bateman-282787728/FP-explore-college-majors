This is one of three tiling DVDs (the others being ""Tiling Floors"" and ""Tiling Countertops"") in this series by Michael Byrne.  Michael Byrne is, without doubt, one of the foremost experts in the tile setting business.

That said, this DVD is truly disappointing.  Byrne spends most of the DVD showing you how to ""float"" walls with wire and mortar for a shower/tub tile installation.  Floating walls is tremendously time consuming and requires a great deal of skill.

Almost all tile installed today is installed with cementious backerboard like HardieBacker or Wonderboard.  These are like drywall made from cement.  You securely mount them to the studs, and then you mount the tile to them with thinset.  They're easy to use and will last decades if installed properly.

Floating walls, especially if you have not done it before, will take longer than would the entire install with cement backerboard.  Floating the walls does allow you to do certain things you can't easily do with backerboard (like rounding a corner), but it would take a long time to master it.  Backerboard is mentioned in the DVD, but almost as an afterthought (which maybe it was back in 1987 when this program was first filmed).

Byrne also uses a snap cutter and tile nibblers instead of a wet saw, so you don't learn how to use that, either.  And the entire DVD shows Byrne setting one type of tile in one bathroom (a stage set made for this purpose).

Byrne uses basic, inexpensive 4""x4"" glazed tiles, and the end result looks like it belongs in a cheap apartment.  The look is dated.  This may also be due to this being filmed in 1987, but that doesn't matter when you're buying it 20 years later.  Almost nobody would be satisfied with the install shown in this DVD.

On the plus side, Byrne does explain different methods for planning tile layout.  And, if you want to learn how to float walls, this would be an excellent resource.

I've installed a few small tile countertops and floors, so I already know how to install tile and bought this as a refresher with the hope of picking up a few new tips.  Because I have absolutely no interest is floating walls, this DVD was a waste of time and money.

Conclusions:

If you are a beginner looking for a video that will show you how to install tile, steer far clear of this DVD.  It will confuse you and likely leave you thinking tile work is beyond your abilities.  For beginners, I highly recommend watching the 5-episode ""Tiling Techniques"" series on the DIY network.

If you have experience with tile and would like to learn how to float walls and pick up some layout tips, this DVD is just what you are looking for you.  For someone in this position, this DVD deserves 4 or 5 stars.

I have also purchased the other two DVDs in this series (""Tiling Floors"" and ""Tiling Countertops"").  Apparently they were filmed at the same time this DVD was made, doing work on the same bathroom set.  I'll probably still watch them, and likely review them, but having seen this one I'm in no hurry.",1184457600,33,3131,4.605786618444847
