6776480,5,B00OYSWNBS,"Lovely movie. It has its own depth and sweetness and mystery that makes for a good love story. Liked the characters and the scenery and the feeling of this movie a lot. In fact, this is the 3rd time I've seen it over the years; was happy to find it here on my Hallmark subscription of Amazon and see it again.",1512518400,2,309,4.081967213114754

6776483,5,B00OYSWNBS,"I was pleasantly surprised with this. They took an unrealistic scenario and made it so believable. I was enthralled with the storyline, like a book you can't put down. The acting was very good. I would recommend this movie.",1511654400,,223,4.743589743589744
8685372,1,B00OYSWNBS,"Five star reviews seem to use the word ""sweet"" a lot in describing this movie, not to be gender age sensitive, but please grandma you've seen this storyline a thousand and one times already. There was no creative writing, great acting, or thoughtful dialogue to challenge us. What was on the menu here was bad for your health as you would have learned if you had been reading anything lately other than romance novels. It was just another excessive, syrupy ""sweetness"" w/no nutritional value movie. OK, they did add superstitious fountain penny wish fulfillment along w/paranormal dream scenes to the script to make it different. Well, dumb different! After watching this I now have to see the dentist. Oh, that it took four years after TV showing to release on DVD says something about quality.",1533168000,,795,4.896296296296296

8685375,4,B00OYSWNBS,"Katharine McPhee won me over not with her vocal chops - I'm not much into American Idol - but, rather, with her lovely turn as Paige, the one normal constant in a crew of eccentric geniuses in Scorpion, one of my favorite shows that debuted in 2014 but was just axed after three seasons. In Hallmark's 2014 romantic fable, In My Dreams, McPhee brings the same qualities that enamored me in Scorpion. She's still very much a down-to-earth and very sympathetic character. Doesn't hurt that she's drop-dead stunning. She's Natalie Russo, a restaurateur who's inherited the floundering family business yet is hesitant to implement the necessary changes to improve it. And then there's Nick Smith (Mike Vogel), the underappreciated architect. Nick's hope for a better career prospect rests on his winning a citywide bridge designing competition (not that we much give an ef about Nick's adventures as a draughtsman). What we care about is that Nick isn't much lucky in love, that a failed relationship in the past has made him into a serial dater. His meddlesome mom (JoBeth Williams) even tries to set him up with a clingy landscape designer (Rachel Skarsten) who was his childhood sweetheart when they were twelve.

I guess I should drop a plot spoiler alert for the fuddy-duddies.

In the local park huddles the Hayward Fountain, a quaint structure erected in 1903 from stones transported from the faraway ruins of a castle rumored to have been enchanted. There's an urban legend about this fountain, that pennies cast into it have a knack for bringing lovers together in dreams, and that these dream lovers then have a seven-day window to meet in the real world. So, there's Natalie. So, there's Nick. Both of them strangers on opposite sides of the fountain, both of them tossing a coin in on a whim. And, then, for seven nights, they dream about their true loves...

In My Dreams won't knock your socks off with an epic love story or explode your dome with earth-shattering plot twists or reveals. It's from Hallmark, the network that specializes in comfort food viewing. Yeah, there's a pronounced fantasy element here and a premise to make the diehard romantic swoon. But there's a restraint to the tone that I appreciated. Plenty of times, movies overdo or don't earn the swelling romantic score. I feel that this one's more grounded. It's partly the appeal of a supporting cast that includes JoBeth Williams, Antonio Cupo, Joe Massingill as Nick's supportive co-worker, Joe, and Jessica Wanlim as Natalie's best friend and co-worker, Sharla. Sharla is the one who pushes Natalie to go out on a limb and take chances on love. The two leads, McPhee and Vogel, are just, to use a British term, loverly, the both of them generating this unforced likability so that you grow to care even about, yes, Nick's bridge designing contest (I know what I said before, dammit) and about Natalie's efforts to tweak into success her family albatross, L'Agrifoglio Restorante (she even imports an Italian chef - played by Cupo - who I assumed would be a romantic rival for Nick). In a way, there's a dab of The Night We Never Met and Sleepless in Seattle in that Natalie and Nick don't really meet for real until the movie's end, meaning a crap ton of pining and hand-wringing from the invested audience. It's amusing that, as the movie went on, Natalie and Nick would primp themselves before going to bed in anticipation of a dream encounter, having fallen for each other in their own headspace.

You see all the tropes, including a series of near misses as the story keeps teasing us by almost but not quite bringing the two in together. The big story conflict is, of course, will they find each other before the seven days elapse? And that's where the biggest suspension of disbelief comes in. Because they could've just exchanged contact information during their dreams, right? Except a story like this one does require that you suspend your disbelief. In My Dreams is a satisfying watch for the steadfast romantic and for those willing to put their cynical side to bed for a bit. Katharine McPhee, did she even win American Idol? It doesn't matter to me. I like her lots anyway.",1530662400,,4171,4.813110181311018

8685378,1,B00OYSWNBS,"I grew up on Hallmark movies as a kid. When a Hallmark movie was playing on TV we knew it was going to be family friendly and great to watch. I started watching this movie with our daughter and son.  I was so shocked by the tone of this movie we shut it off 20 minutes into the movie. At one point in the movie, the Italian chef is standing next to the female actor (who is sitting) and he says, ""I am big."" The female actress is stunned and gives him a confused look and then realizes he was talking about something else. An obvious sexual innuendo. Then, the girl proceeds to have these dreams where she is walking on the edge of roof of her building and doesn't care. Or her and this guy and touching each intimately in dream. The whole beginning was so edgy and confusing. It saddens me to see that Hallmark has pulled away from being a movie a family can all sit down and watch. All you have to do is look at When Calls the Heart actress Erin Krakow to see what she wore to the Hallmark Awards night and see the direction Hallmark is going",1525996800,3,1044,4.117647058823529
