3419589,1,B0018RM336,"So, the bundle is now $305.99.  A previous reviewer from July 24, 2008 tagged it at $284.95.  Instead of coming down in price over time, it went up.  Just looking up Black Hawk Down, I can get it new from $16 to $20.  Hellboy runs $14 to $20.  12 movies for $305.99 = $25.50 per movie.  Way too expensive.",1232582400,8,305,4.084745762711864
3419590,1,B0018RM336,"Lets see would I rather pay $225 dollars, the cost of these DVD's together separately or pay the $306 for the bundle???",1230249600,12,119,4.454545454545454
3419591,1,B0018RM336,"It's truly insane to see such a high price tag on an almost random picked movie collection. It's got a wide variety, but it's hard to guess anyone loves more than half the package!

As the other user I'd ask Amazon to post for better offers!",1222560000,17,241,4.239130434782608
3419592,1,B0018RM336,"Let's see you get 12 movies (which you didn't pick) for $284.95. That comes out to $23.66 each! You end up paying MORE for several of these movies so what's the point of bundling them together?!? Sets like these have to be way cheaper to justify the purchase.

Anyone who gets this set for $284.95 should have his/her head examined! C'mon Amazon, give us better deals than this!",1216857600,44,378,4.5588235294117645

8270871,1,B0018RM336,As of this post If you buy all of these movies separately it will cost $141.93 for brand new copies of the movies. Do not buy this bundle.,1430784000,,138,3.9642857142857144
8270872,1,B0018RM336,"I'm not sure who the audience for this $320 release is because many people will already own the best of these films. It is cheaper to purchase your favorite titles individually. This 2008 release is out of print and not worth tracking down. Gattaca, Superbad, The Fifth Element and A Knight's Tale are my favorites. Daniel Craig and Will Ferrell in one collection. All of these films are worth watching.

12 Films: Black Hawk Down, Casino Royale, The Fifth Element, Gattaca, Hellboy, House of Flying Daggers, A Knight's Tale, Layer Cake, Spider-man 3, Superbad, Talladega Nights, Underworld Evolution",1379030400,,600,5.122448979591836
8270873,5,B0018RM336,"You other reviewers are absolutely crazy!! At $323.99, this masterpiece collection is an absolute steal! This package includes timeless classics such as Hellboy and A Knight's Tale, both of which are EASILY worth the $26.99 a piece price tag. The cinematic genius of Talladega Nights and Underworld Evolution alone are enough to justify the price! I honestly can't believe these people are complaining! I suppose you say a painting by the great Monet is not worth its hefty price either! Shame on you.. All of you.. You don't know great art when you see it. These collector's items are very likely to appreciate greatly in value within a few short years. I personally have been waiting specifically to purchase these 12 movies, and did not want to bother with the hassle of purchasing them individually. Once they arrive, I can play them all simultaneously, taking in all of the gloriousness each film has to offer. Buy now! You'll thank me later.",1278374400,7,947,4.888198757763975
8270874,1,B0018RM336,"Cut it to a third the price, then we'll talk.  If you want to sell in bulk, offer a bulk price, not this nonsense.",1262217600,3,114,3.75
8270875,1,B0018RM336,"I was a bit interested when I first noticed this Blu-Ray bundle.

It only took me a split second to realize it to be a disappointing ripoff.",1260403200,3,140,4.185185185185185
8270876,3,B0018RM336,"I guess I am the only lucky one who got a great deal on this box set.  I paid $165.94 for this set in June 2008.  I had seen all of the movies except for ""Layer Cake"" with Daniel Craig and I was pleasantly surprised by the story.  I expected to get a B movie but what I got was a movie that held my interest throughout even though the ""good guy"" is really a bad guy.  However, there is no way I would pay $285 for this set now.",1246838400,3,427,3.7111111111111112
8270877,1,B0018RM336,"Yeah so I just did a breakdown of the prices from Amazon and if you bought all of these separate from the site it would cost you 218.88, brand new. If you decided to buy new between Amazon and the marketplace for the best price you would be spending less than 182.00. Although I like almost all of the movies it clearly is nowhere close to a good value.",1244505600,4,353,4.130434782608695
8270878,1,B0018RM336,"First it was $285, then $306.  Now hold on to your hats.  It is now $407!!!  Amazon.....are you out of your mind?  Prices of blue ray discs are slowly going down, but you offer a 12 pack with a very strange selection and you just raised the price of the pack $100??  Brilliant marketing strategy.  And where did you come up with this assortment of movies?  It doesn't make any sense.  IF any person in America buys this idiotic 12 pack it would floor me.",1238198400,6,454,4.258823529411765
8270879,1,B0018RM336,"I actually already own most of these, so I know for a fact that it is MUCH cheaper to buy them separately than in this ""Bundle"". If the price were dropped, to entice new blu-ray player owners, it would be a hit.

I say, drop it to $200 and market it as a blu ray starter kit, promoting it as a good match for every blu ray player and PS3.",1235174400,4,338,3.8285714285714287
