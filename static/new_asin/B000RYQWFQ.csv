8563118,2,B000RYQWFQ,"This is not an instructional video to teach you about mosaics. It is nothing more than a recast of their 30-minute TV show where you watch two people create a mosaic table. They talk very fast at times due to the short amount of time. I bought this TO LEARN, for more detailed explanation on the how and why rather than just watching excerpts of time-lapsed work and hearing about how brilliant they are. I expected more from well-known names in the industry and feel that they are taking advantage of their reputation to charge full price for a TV recast and pretend it is an instructional video. The DVD is worth something, but certainly not the price they are asking. If you want a good stained glass video, check out Michael Dupille's Beginning Fritography. That is excellent!!",1274313600,2,781,4.666666666666667
