Honey Tree: Winnie the Pooh wants honey and tries two different approaches for honey. Both approaches fail. Next, Pooh goes to Rabbit's house for honey and eats all the jars. But, Pooh can't go out of Rabbit's front door! He's stuck! Next, Rabbit calls Christopher Robin and they try to pull him out. They can't. He's stuck. So they wait for him to get thin again. One day, Pooh moves! Everyone tries to pull him out of the hole. Will the team get Pooh out? Find out by purchasing The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.
Blustery Day: It's a windy day in the Hundred Acre Wood. Piglet gets blown away by the wind and Pooh pulls him on a string. They ""fly"" to Owl's house. All of a sudden, Owl's House falls down! Eeyore goes to find him a new house. At night, it isn't windy anymore. It's rainy. There's a big flood in the Hundred Acre Wood. Everyone goes to Christopher Robin's house, which can't be affected by a flood. However, Piglet and Pooh are still in the flood. Owl goes to rescue them. Pooh and Piglet float down to Christopher Robin's house and Christopher Robin believes Pooh rescued Piglet. They have a party for Pooh. In the middle of the party for Pooh, Eeyore appears. He says he found a house for Owl. Everyone goes to see the house. Instead of being happy, everyone is shocked. Why are they shocked? Find out by purchasing The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.
Tigger Too: Next Review
Last Story: Tigger and Roo go bouncing in the snow. However, Tigger gets stuck on a tall tree and everyone comes to rescue him. Everyone finally got Tigger down. However, Tigger makes a promise up in a tree that everyone is unhappy about except Rabbit. Why is Rabbit the only one happy about this promise? Find out by purchasing The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. (This story is short!)
There's also a bonus story on my tape. It stars Eeyore. Here it is:
Bonus Story: Eeyore gets stuck in a river and everyone finally gets him out. Rabbit asks Eeyore why he was in rhe river in the first place. Eeyore says that Tigger bounced him in the river. Tigger says he coughed and Eeyore fell in. At the end, the evidence shows that Tigger bounced him in the river. Everyone gets mad at Tigger for bouncing Eeyore in the river. At the end, Pooh discovers it's a really special day for Eeyore. It's his BIRTHDAY! But, he hasn't gotten a single present. Pooh gives him a empty honey pot, and Piglet gives him a broken balloon. Eeyore is really happy. During Eeyore's party, something happens that turns his smile upside down. What is it? Find out by purchasing The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.

Rabbit tries to teach Tigger a lesson because he bounces too much. His plan is to lose him in the forest and find him again the next day. When they find him, he'll be a Tigger that doesn't bounce at all. The next day, Rabbit, Piglet, and Pooh set out to ""lose"" Tigger. Instead of losing Tigger, someone else gets ""lost."" Who got lost? Find out by purchasing Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too.
