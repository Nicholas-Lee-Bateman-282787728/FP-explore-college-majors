8476181,1,B005JZBPCS,"There are maybe 3 good movies in the bunch and seperately they are inexpensive movies. The rest are bad writing, directing, acting, etc.  Several are ""foreign"" films I guess because the accents are so thick that the dialogue cannot be understood.  I will usually sit through any movie at least once, some of these were so bad I shut them off before I finished watching them.  If there are any you recognize that you don't own and are building a library, worth the price; but if you think you are getting 8 great movies at a low price, think again.
