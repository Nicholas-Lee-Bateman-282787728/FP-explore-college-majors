8308924,5,B001HLRVRQ,"This is one of the best videos and one of the best instructors ever, Andy James is my new go to guy for learning all sorts of Metallica type licks, very helpful, only thing, wish it did come with some tablature as a backup, however the way Andy breaks down each riff makes it easy and it sounds killer, especially adding a bit of wah pedal to top off some of the phrases.",1318550400,,371,4.095890410958904
8308925,5,B001HLRVRQ,"This is now my 11th Quick Licks DVD. I must say that if you dig the way Krirk Hammett plays and wanted to play just like that then stop reading and buy this DVD. This is your typical DVD from the Quick Licks collection. It has a Jam Track and goes over 25 total licks. Andy James really does a great job on this one. I think for the most part, the material is not all that complicated, however the tempo at which this is played requires lots of practice. Otherwise you'll be able to pull the licks off but sound real sloppy. I think that's what makes Andy a great guitar player. Aside from his versatility, he is one of the cleanest players I've heard. The material includes: double bends, legato runs, hammer-ons and pull-offs, some sweep picking, tapping and tremelo picking. Don't let these terms scare you though, he slows everything down so just about anybody can learn and pick up pace comfortobaly. Just like the other DVD's in this series, you will not find any tabs. You will however learn some pretty sweet sounding licks and get to practice them on the Jam track. For $20, I think that's well worth it.",1239926400,,1113,4.434146341463415
