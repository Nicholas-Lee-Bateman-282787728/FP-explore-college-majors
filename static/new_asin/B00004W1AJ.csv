They have a back catalog of videos they could make a killing on if they re-released them
on dvd or better yet a Blu Ray Complete box set  maybe there's a problem with distribution rights?

This box set is very good mostly do in part to all the Iconic super models in each volume
with the likes of  Kathy Ireland, Tyra Banks, Stacey Williams, Ashley Richardson, Nikki Taylor, Eva Herzigova, Rebecca Romijn, and Rachel Hunter and many more this was the golden era of S.I. Swimsuit

This is the only way to get most of these specials on home video in  a digital physical form besides the OOP Laserdiscs",1449100800,,699,4.346153846153846
7924298,5,B00004W1AJ,"This DVD is just what it says, all 5 late nineties Swimsuit video editions in one collection.  These are the same editions as shown on TV each season.  All your favorites are here Heidi Klum, Tyra Banks, Rachel Hunter, Kathy Ireland, Angie Everhart, Laetitia Casta, Eva Herzigova, Daniella Pestova, Niki Taylor, Rebecca Romjin, Cheryl Tiegs, etc.  I wish they had added some DVD extras to the original broadcasts but the Swimsuit video was still in its infancy when these were made so it's understandable. For anyone who has been a fan of the swimsuit videos since their inception this is a great edition to your collection.",1167177600,2,624,4.867924528301887
7924299,1,B00004W1AJ,"When i first heard about it, I was excited and could not wait to get my hands on it. however, it did not live up to my expectations. It's more like a documentary about a model's life and all other HOO HAH!!
if you are a guy and thinking about getting it, forget it.
if you are a girl and always wanted to be a model, I guess it would be of some use.
Trust me, don't learn the hard way.......",1000857600,4,391,3.8395061728395063
7924300,5,B00004W1AJ,"My reasons for liking this is much different than your typical viewer.  I first saw the 1995 special when it was broadcast on TV.  My main reason for watching it was to see if the models were as stuck up as they were reputed to be.  Actually I found the opposite to be just the case.  I was rolling on the floor with laughter at the self-depricating remarks and their genuine good attitude towards life.  When I had the opportunity to watch it some years later on video I found that my original opinion held.  I was really pleased to see that many of them continued to have prosperous careers.  Including Rebecca Romijn-Stamos who deservedly was made the cover model for 1999.
As far as aethetics go, I can not deny that this is a very well produced and slick video. Very aethetically pleasing on all aspects.
  The thing that struck me the most  about watching the video and looking at the calenders was not so much the aesthetics of the young women.  It wasn't just the fact that they were attractive, but despite the fact that they were posing in bathing suits, there was a dignity to them that is seldom seen today and that is what impressed me the most",996192000,4,1157,4.410377358490566
7924301,4,B00004W1AJ,"Everyone's familiar with Sports Illustrated's annual swimsuit edition, and  the corresponding videos. Now here's your chance to own five years worth on  2 DVDs. Although ,the DVD doesn't contain any ""previously unreleased  material"", it is still a must for all fans, even those who already own  the videos. The increased picture quality and crystal clear slo-mo that  comes with DVD really add to the experience allowing you to see all those  things you thought you saw, if you know what I mean. Best of all there's no  macrovision so you can make your own ""customized"" VHS  copy. Featured models include:Eva Herzigova, Tyra Banks, Laetitia Casta,  Heidi Klum, Naomi Campbell, Nikki Taylor, Rebecca Romijn,and others. All in  all this is an excellent value, but the could've and should've added some  bonus footage.",969062400,28,815,5.145038167938932
