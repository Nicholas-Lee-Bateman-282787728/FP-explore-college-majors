8369078,5,B002FJ45KK,"I don't know how I have never heard of Dive Olly Dive before but it is adorable!  My sons love it, and I don't mind it either!  The show is about submarines who go on adventures it reminds of the movie Little Nemo.  The graphics are really neat and the show is so colorful and bright.  It is a very kid-friendly show and has some great lessons that are simple for kids.  The lessons include working together, solving problems, working towards a goal, and more!  It is a very cute DVD and I love it because it is a educational but my preschooler has no idea!  The episodes are also different as there are not too many animated water shows out there.",1278288000,,648,4.262295081967213
