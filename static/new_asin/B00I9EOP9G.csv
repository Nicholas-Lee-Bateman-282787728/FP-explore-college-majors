8640090,5,B00I9EOP9G,I bought this video because I heard it was perfect for small kids and it was. During the Superbowl all the kids watched this video from start to finish and loved it. Lots of big trucks in all shapes and configurations kept the kids glued to the tv for the whole video. I've seen other similar videos but this one really seemed geared directly to the young kids. The price was also very attractive and it didn't break the entertainment budget.,1393632000,,442,4.469135802469136
