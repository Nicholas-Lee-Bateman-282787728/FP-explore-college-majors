As a schoolboy, I would race home to catch the final minutes of this 1960s classic television masterpiece.  I still believe it to be a 1960s classic television masterpiece.  I hope further dvd sets will be released sometime soon.  And, as an additional comment, I must say the sound and visual quality of the product is very good for the age of the original masters.",1336435200,5,584,4.989690721649485

8722559,5,B010KFR35Y,"The great medical drama continues in this volume two, and right from the first episode we are given a few lessons in philosophy from Ben Casey, a catholic priest and a Hebrew man.

As usual Ben has to deal with more irate people, a couple of lost patients, a rodeo contestant, a man who was to be committed because everyone thought he was emotionally affected, except for Ben. Also there is a jailbird murderer, a self-inflected gun shot wound, or was it? An addict for a patient puts Ben's career on the line, a smallpox epidemic a nine year old boy with a brain tumor and more for Ben to deal with.

In this series Ben is joined by Carroll O'Connor, James Franciscus, Edward Andrews, Ellen McRae, John Astin, Doris Roberts, Burgess Meredith, Rod Steiger, Tuesday Weld, James Whitmore, Ludwig Donath, Nellie Burt, Simon Oakland, Eddie Albert James Donald, Harold J. Stone, and as usual Bettye ""Dr. Maggie Graham"" Ackerman is also back and all the regulars.

Take a trip down the corridors of County General Hospital with Ben Casey, Dr. David Zorba and the rest, to enjoy one of the best medical dramas of the 1960s with an out-spoken doctors' doctor, who gets five stars from me. I hope many people will get the series and see what medical dramas were all about at a time when television was young and the shows were starting to take over from the movies and drive-ins.",1379203200,,1370,4.60655737704918

8722562,4,B010KFR35Y,"Ben Casey was superb television drama. It creator was James Moser, who had been Jack Webb's top writer on Dragnet,and who had created the first 'realistic' Medical Drama, ""Medic"", with Richard Boone, in 1957. Moser, a champion  of authenticity, worked for nearly two years in a Los Angeles hospital as an orderly, researching how a hospital worked. He based the brilliant, abrasive, but compassionate Casey on an LA neurosurgeon.
Moser, who later received the first Gabriel Award from The Academy of Catholic Broadcast professionals, believed television drama could be both entertaining and. at the same time, tackle complex moral and social issues. Ben Casey did just that.
Later, Moser topped Ben Casey with an even better show, Slattery's People, set in the world of state politics, and starring the great Richard Crenna as Jim Slattery, an  idealistic, but wily and resourceful, crusading state legislator. Just as every episode of Ben Casey began with the words, ""Man, Woman, Life, Death, Infinity"", every episode of Slattery's People began with Crenna saying ""Democracy is a very bad form of government, but, I ask you never to forget, the others are much worse.""
Of course, the superbly written and acted Slattery's People lasted only a season and a half. and now gathers dust on the shelves of CBS Paramount. Perhaps the release of Ben Casey means Moser's other masterpiece will come out on DVD, but I am not holding my breath.",1351123200,,1435,5.050632911392405
