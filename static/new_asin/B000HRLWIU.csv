8140907,2,B000HRLWIU,I was very disappointed. There is no way I can learn the Bodhran from this video. I don't think I'm a complete idiot but I felt like one when I tried to follow. He just keeps doing this fast rhythm and never breaks it down so it makes any sense. It was a waste of money.,1370736000,3,270,3.8392857142857144
8140908,5,B000HRLWIU,quite easy to follow instructions if you pay attention and practice with the dvd ata the same time you are watching dvd,1361664000,,119,4.454545454545454
8140909,4,B000HRLWIU,"I feel this DVD is great for the beginner, if you stop it and learn each step along the way. No, the teacher didn't mumble, he's Irish, that's his brogue, turn it up and listen carefully. I didn't see it as being homemade, though the teacher was somewhat uncomfortable doing it, if you can listen, stop, do what he demonstrates, then practice it, you'll learn how to play fairly well. I almost feel like the other reviewer watched a different DVD. Maybe it was an earlier version. The lighting was good, the camera work and insets worked well, I learned from it easily enough, though I still need more practice, of course. The thing to do, is watch it all the way through, without so much as the tipper in your hand, then start again with the tipper and bodhran in the position he demonstrates. Work part by part, don't try to go too fast, then anyone can learn a good bit from this DVD. It's nearly worth the price for the music that's included. Ten bucks for a dvd of any kind, what planet is that other reviewer from? Ain't happenin, dude. Frankly, I don't think you gave it a fair shot.",1292630400,15,1090,4.374384236453202
8140910,1,B000HRLWIU,"This DVD was not useful for a true beginner. The production quality was poor. It looked home made and it was sometimes difficult to hear the speaker who sometimes mumbled. Other than learning how to hold the drum, it left me knowing that perhaps the only way to get any real instruction is in person with a teacher. Definitely not worth the price. For ten dollars maybe, for over thirty dollars, forget it.",1262995200,12,406,4.575342465753424
