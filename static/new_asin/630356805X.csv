7850326,5,630356805X,"My mom bought this tape at a resale shop for a quarter and my son LOVED it!!! he was younger than two... well the VCR ate the tape, I tried to fix it and well it didn't work. I looked it up on here after a few months of him not being able to watch one of his fave movies and bought it. When it arrived in the mail today I called him over (he's 2 and a half now) and I opened the package. you should have seen his face light up when i took it out!. He has been watching it nonstop since this afternoon. :)",1355270400,,504,3.675925925925926
7850327,5,630356805X,"Alphabet Soup is a classic!  It should be in the video library of everyone who either has a dog, or uses the alphabet on a daily basis.  I had lost my original copy, and am ecstatic to have it again in my life.  Buy this!  Watch it!  Laugh!  Enjoy life again!",1326672000,,259,3.980392156862745
7850328,5,630356805X,I bought this long before I had kids. I used to watch it and just crack up. Now my kids love it. The VCR ate my copy. Must replace.,1141084800,,131,3.5517241379310347
7850329,5,630356805X,"This video is delightful.

Just the right amount of silliness in an ""ABC"" format.

Appropriate for elementary children and their parents.

I show it to accompany an art lesson on William Wegman's photography for 4th grade students.",1126396800,,231,5.1891891891891895
7850330,5,630356805X,"My 16 month old son loves this video, and I don't mind watching it over and over with him. He giggles hysterically at the dogs wearing hats. It was recommended by someone and we're getting another copy as a gift for a two year old that watched it and kept asking to see the puppies again.",1064880000,3,288,4.160714285714286
7850331,5,630356805X,"We got this for our daughter at 18 months.  She is absolutely enthralled by it, and we think its hilarious too.  Wegman dresses his dogs up like people and takes them through the ludicrous process of making alphabet soup, full of everything from Ice crean to vineger (""don't put i n too much vinegar, you don't want the soup to be too vinegary.  Oops, its going to be too vinegary!""  This is a great video for both kids and adults.  END",890352000,23,436,4.333333333333333
