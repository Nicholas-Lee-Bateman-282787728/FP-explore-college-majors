3131330,5,B0014FAINE,"I used to think that Tori Spelling was just plain annoying, but this series really shows how down to earth she is. Her and Dean are hilarious trying to run their B and B. So funny, you will have a whole new appreciation for Tori.  Tried to order the second season of Inn Love, but it is on backorder. So funny, you won't be disappointed.",1251331200,,337,4.184615384615385

I will watch show tv channel oxygen new season 4 every tue with closed captioned. thank you.",1243728000,,246,4.25531914893617
3131332,2,B0014FAINE,"I am a huge fan of Tori's. However, I have to admit this is a bad DVD. It shows how pathetic her life has become: she struggles for a life  and have no CLUE about being an entrepreneur. I bought the DVD because I wanted to see her life change and get a glimpse of her new B&B, planning to visit it myself one day. I just gave up. The place is awful to say the least. The decoration is a fiasco. She seems to be the dumbest. It really changed the whole image  I had of  her.",1234051200,,473,3.806122448979592
3131333,5,B0014FAINE,I love them and I hope the will remain together for ever. I love their show and can't wait to see their other one.,1227916800,2,114,3.7916666666666665
3131334,5,B0014FAINE,"First of all, i hate Reality shows, but when my mother told me about this show, from the first time i watched it, i was hooked!! Other than watching Tori on 90210, i really didn't know much about her. Well, when you watch this, you will get to know Tori inside and out. And that's what makes this show so ""un"" reality!! She is so real and down to earth! And so is her husband! I have watched the other seasons on t.v., but never got to see this first season, thus the reason for buying it here. Though it doesn't feature her beautiful son Liam in this season, (she is pregnant), it's still tons of fun, and you'll get to see the closeness that Tori and Dean shares. I found myself smiling through it a lot! (as always) :) You can tell that they don't fake anything for the camera. What you see is what you get with them! You won't be disappointed at all. I haven't watched the second disc yet, but i am always pleased with the shows, and this DVD rocks. They are just the perfect family and they love to have fun and they do a lot of things together on the show. What can i say? I just love it, and i can't wait for the new season to begin. I actually watched several re-runs of the show recently. It's that good! :)",1222560000,3,1216,4.092050209205021
3131335,4,B0014FAINE,It was a gift for my wife.  She loves it.  We watched it together and it was amusing.,1221436800,3,85,3.6666666666666665
3131336,5,B0014FAINE,"I do love reality shows, but I didn't think I'd love watching Tori and Dean trying to buy a B&B with 'not much money' behind them and no experience.  I am pleasantly surprised.  The main focus of the show is buying the B&B (in Fallbrook, CA) and running it, but the other big story throughout is the fact that she is so close to delivering her first baby.  You get to see countless visits to the Dr about her fear that she has killed the baby because they had s*x, or she took a warm bath, and you see them take looks at heaps of places before finally settling on the Fallbrook place (you also see her famous yard sale).  They actually do a good job of getting it up and running because they're so inexperienced, and you get to see how much they love each other too.  The one thing I don't understand is how he can put up with her complaining so much and being so lazy.
It's a good show because you get a glimpse into their lives, but it has a focus, rather than just following them around for the sake of it.  One of the best episodes has to be Let's Go Have A Baby where Liam is born.  It's funny, sad and moving all at the same time.  I love the scenes in this where the two older female guests are playing around with the two male guys - it's hilarious.  Overall, this show is much better than I thought it might be and I really enjoy watching it.  Now I can't wait for the release of season 2.",1218240000,11,1398,4.050909090909091

8255468,5,B0014FAINE,"As I watch more shows with Tori Spelling and read her books, it is obvious her parents did not prepare her for adulthood.  She is trying to become an adult and as we watch it is funny and sad at the same time.  I would recommend this as well as her books.",1288828800,,255,3.8846153846153846
