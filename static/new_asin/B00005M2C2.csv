Its about half way through if you make it that far.",1511049600,,305,4.05

1623819,3,B00005M2C2,I was pleasantly surprised when I watched this. It's on par with the best of the worst films from the 80s. A surprisingly high budget and lots of impressive model work. The CGI was a bit rough but can be over looked. This is Oscar material when compared to Atlantic Rim or Sharknado.,1510358400,,283,4.3584905660377355

1623828,2,B00005M2C2,"The story is pretty far fetched but on the better side when it comes to giant monster movies. The main problem is the monster(s) cg for it is very, very bad. The practical effects for the most part are well done. Exploding buildings look great and the scene where the other monster is tunneling underground is wonderful. The aliens though look awful. The sets and costumes for the humans are very good as well. The dialogue is cringeworthy throughout with many characters being overdramatized stereotypes. It overstays its welcome by about a half hour and the bad cg really takes away from the final battle but storywise it's alright and there are some good practical effects to be seen.",1486598400,,687,4.781512605042017

1623833,4,B00005M2C2,"You've got to like science fiction and satires to appreciate this movie.  And, you have to keep in mind the point in its development that CGI was when this film was made. Now, with all that in mind, here's how this flick affected me.  I found it a lot of fun!  I can't figure out whether the makers of ""Reptilian"" were serious or rather intended it to be a spoof.  And, therein, lies its appeal.  Is it kinda 'corny'? ""Yes"".  If the producers were trying to make a serious monster movie, then this thing is bad enough to make it laughable.  But, if it was made that way on purpose, it has a degree of subtlety to it that, to me, makes it a really cool satire.  Having seen it, would I buy it again? Yes, And I've found it to be a movie that I have enjoyed watching more than once. As an average movie fan, with no insight into the finer points of the film industry, that's always the standard I use when deciding if I think a movie is good or not.",1434758400,,947,4.081081081081081

1623841,1,B00005M2C2,"Reptilian - CGI be Damned. A CGI dino-monster fights CGI helicopters in what has to be the worst scene in monster movie history. When the CGI dino rises from the CGI ocean, a lot of CGI water splashes around. At times there is so much CGI going on, you think you're watching a Saturday morning cartoon.

This film is touted as a Korean Kaiju film but its all American actors and settings (NY?). Plus the American military is called to save the day and what a bunch of bungling buffoons these guys are. The one bright spot was, the film actually had a decent storyline as far as giant monster movies go, but this too, was ruined by some of the corniest and bad dialogue I have ever heard. Oh, and did I tell you about the robot aliens, lets not even go there.

The backgrounds have wrong lighting compared to the monster, Sometimes the scale is off. This movie was so fake looking it became an annoyance to watch. I've seen better animations on you tube by some kids making comedy videos in their backyards. I would much rather see toy model helicopters with wires attached than the helicopter scene in this movie. Note to film makers, CGI helicopters never work!!!! Also, CGI explosions are lame! If you can't make a scale model, blow it up with some M-80's and film it in slow motion - then cut the explosions out of the script. Last note. A guy in a rubber suit would have been a welcome sight for this film. Two thumbs down!!!",1302048000,,1429,4.388679245283019
1623842,3,B00005M2C2,"Well, if you have read any of the other reviews on here than you likely know the story, so I won't bore you with a rehash. What I will say is that I found this movie to be fun and entertaining, and from this type of movie, that is all I really ask.
Yes the story is silly, and yes the special-effects are weak, but if you like Godzilla movies or any of the other giant monster movies out there then you are already well prepared for what your going to see here. Instead of a guy in a cheap rubber suit you will get cheap CGI. The creature actually looks good in a couple of spots, but the year(1999), the budget, and the too little experience of the animators just can't keep up with what the story wants the creature to do. Particurly weak is the ending, where Yonnary fights Cyclor (or whatever its name is) in a virtual battle in the middle of the city. By now (2010) you have probably seen better animation on your playstation, but it is fun none the less. (On a side note, it really sounds as if Cyclor's roar is just a guy growling. If so, they really got cheap and lazy.)
All in all though, this movie was a welcome change from the norm. And if you buy it used (and your a giant monster fan I should add) it's well worth the money.",1269302400,,1238,4.098765432098766

1623845,3,B00005M2C2,"Though this film has a monster named Yongary in it and it was made in Korea, that's pretty much where the similiarities end with the original Yongary.

Bad points:

1.) Bad acting - Yes, very very bad... and I mean Plan 9 from Outer Space bad. There are a few things here and there that made me laugh but sometimes the bad acting just isn't funny.

2.) Special Effects - Take some of the worst special effects you could ever possibly put into a movie and that's what you have here.

3.) Battles - The battles are pathetic, take what you didn't like about the 1998 Godzilla film and put it all in here.

4.) An insult - For those of us who like Godzilla, they insult him in this film, literally.

5.) Aliens - Fake puppet looking aliens, just laughable.

Good points:

1.) Widescreen: What? That's a feature...could have been in full screen, that would just add insult to injury.

2.) Four words - Kids in a bus!

3.) Army sergeant - His acting is just as bad as everyone else's, but for some reason I find him funny.

4.) Explosions - Lots of stuff blows up...... not really more I can say.

Technical Notes:

The explosions and roaring seem to have a much deeper sound than they should have and I found them drowning out the voices and lighter sounds when using 5.1 surround sound.

Overall, this is a really, really bad film. It had alot of potential but fell flat on it's face. If you are a kaiju fanatic, the film should be in your library regardless of how bad it is. If you liked how cheesy Plan 9 from Out Space was, then you might like this too.

If you're a fan of Godzilla or Gamera's regular films, this one might push your cheese tolerance level to it's limits. I certainly wouldn't buy this at full price, pick it up for no more than $6 maximum, it isn't worth anymore than that.",1198627200,,1792,4.291666666666667
1623846,3,B00005M2C2,"Yes it's all true! - what you've read in the reviews. Also:

  I liked the generous amount of monster scenes, tho repetitive. Youngary did little but stand there as he dodged missiles. Another laugh is how many times their missiles hit buildings.

  A shame the Koreans didn't bring in some help to learn how to make the creature solid or look real. Always it looks ghostly, cartoony, often like a kid's 3D computer animation show, although pretty good otherwise.

  I think it was 95% there, that the monster's light sourcing was right, but needed more contrast, or be darker in the right places. Unfortunately it hurts the reality.

  Shame not one monster scene was in day time, as Godzilla 1998 did. I wonder why.

  This was strangely complimented by the music which seems ghostly too, as if the composer was afraid to compose something, but rather whisper, electronically, detached from the action.

  I like that it's one of Korea's biggest budget films tho, the first international one, and even the government helped, and the military.

  After its successful opening in Korea, more of everything was added to the movie for the international release.

  So I appreciate the ambition.

  Oh yes, it has one of the best creative opening credit sequences, after the main title. Luv it when they come up with yet another new one.

  And, was the monster really called Gary?

  The shark in jaws was Bruce.

  And I'm pretty sure Godzilla was called... oh.",1164499200,,1460,4.7926829268292686
1623847,4,B00005M2C2,"REPTILIAN is a truly awful movie. Everything, the effects, the acting, the writing, everything just sucks. But you know what? It delivers what giant monster movie fanatics want and is absolutely hilarious! I swear, I was laughing so hard at one point I thought a chestbuster was about to come out of my abdomen!

 Aliens revive a giant dinosaur and send it on a rampage. Don't ask why. They just do. What follows is a bad CGI monster destroying cities and opening spots for recruitment in the military. There's one scene where the monster fights a squad of jetpack troopers with laser gattling guns!

 Like I said, everything about this movie sucks, its just so unintentionally funny I just can't bring myself to hate it. Rent it and have a good laugh.",1162684800,,752,4.674242424242424
1623850,2,B00005M2C2,"I am a huge fan of asian ""kaiju"" monster films, and this movie is just plain bad. It gives into all of the stereotypes of the genre with horrible acting and worse special effects. The effects are so bad, Godzilla '98 is fantastic in comparison. Those who are just casual watchers won't catch on to how bad it is, thinking that all of the movies in this genre are equally as bad. But for fans that know that there movies in this genre that have great acting and special effects, then this film really does come off as a disappointment.

Not that I was expecting too much out of a film that was the return of Yongary, the monster from the self-titled film that had a lot of bloopers and problems with that as well. At least the story from the original film and special effects weren't bad for its time. Like I said, this is a bad movie, and it does not show what this genre really is, it is an embarrasment. The funniest thing about this movie is that they make comments on here about how bad Godzilla and his films are, blissfully not knowing how much garbage this film is. This movie was even high budget and this is the result! Such a let down. For those who have never seen a kaiju film before, don't start by watching this, it is not a good example of how good they can be. Only gave it 2 stars and not 1 since it is a monster movie",1155686400,,1335,4.154440154440154

1623853,4,B00005M2C2,"Why I gave this film four stars to this movie is because,well first off the plot of this movie is great and I love monster movies and such, but the animation is kind'a pore. It looked like they just put Yonggary (Reptilian)in and forgot to make him seem real. Like the movie ""GODZILLA"" in 1998 they(the people that made Godzilla) made him look like he was really there stepping on people, knocking over buildings, and really looked like ""something"".

When we first popped it in, it was so bad we just about turned it off, but the acting and script was SO bad, we found ourselves rolling with laughter! We decided to watch the whole thing, and it only got better!! This movie is, seriously, the funniest movie I have ever seen by virtue of the terrible scripting, acting, special effects, plot -- everything! From the ever-grinning captain, to the action figure-like aliens, to the comically evil archaeologists -- it never stops! We have introduced this movie to countless friends and acquiantances, and it has become a classic! Shortly, it is the BEST bad movie ever. We have probably watched it 20 times or more, and we find something new every time!!! A MUST SEE!!!",1113696000,3,859,4.620915032679738

Although the plot's dumb, the acting sucks, and the fact that it's filmed in english boggles the mind, the special effects are actually OK, and, most important of all, it's FUN! I guess I would compare it to Godzilla vs. Megalon, another fun-filled movie. If you only like top-notch acting and special effects, then you're stupid, along with 99% of the population (including the people in this movie). If you don't mind pure cinematic cheese (like me), you'll enjoy Yonggary more than any other movie out there. You have my reccomendation, buy it!",1096070400,,590,4.794117647058823

I have to admit to roaring over the lines ""The bones are from a non-Carbon based life form.  Carbon dating makes it 200 million years old!""  Honestly, this movie has the WORST dialogue I have EVER come across in a film.  And it's not just one or two howlers, but its consistently awful.
So, the plot's stolen--Godzilla meets Mothra or some such, with space aliens thrown in for fun. Nonsensical things happen throughout, and one of the monsters can even attack the other without his head!  The effects aren't entirely terrible, just mostly so.  The acting is as wooden as a casket.  Dialogue stupid.  Film awful.  See only for its camp value.  Even better, avoid entirely--your life will be enriched.

1623859,3,B00005M2C2,"I purchased this movie not knowing anything about it, and overall it is fun, but the plot has more holes than OJ Simpson's alibi and as for the acting, it really has to be seen to be believed (a friend of mine threw a ""bad movie"" contest last night, and ""Reptilian"" was my entry...after everyone saw the first scene of this film, I was the unanimous winner!). The English dialogue is so stiffly delivered that I wondered if this was done deliberately so the Korean language overdubs (for the home market) would more closely match the actors' mouths.
In any event, the effects are pretty cool, and what is a big monster film without good visuals? The redesigned Yongary was clearly influenced by the Tristar-reengineered Godzilla - he has a muscular, kind of reptile/humanoid look (but he did retain the ability to breathe fire, while Godzilla was dumbed down). I actually liked the original Yongary film and hoped the remake would stick to the original storyline (the aliens in ""Reptilian"" are more a distraction than a useful plot device; they have another monster at their disposal but choose to 'resurrect' Yongary instead).

Here are the major problems with this film & why I can't recommend it. 1) The Cgi used to create Yonggary & his eventual opponet Cyker are poor. Yonggary looks like a left over from Disney's film ""Dinosaur"". However he is not set in a computer generated world but, placed among real life minatures. Almost as bad as the CGI ""Scorpion King"" at the end of ""The Mummy Returns.""2) Many of the monster scenes take place at night & are difficult to make out. 3) THE biggest determent to this film is the dollar store equivalency of ""acting"". It is just plain gut- wrenching LOUSY! The Dialog is equally as putrid!4) No explanation is given as to why the ""aliens"" needed to bring Yonggary back to life to attack Earth when they had Cyker right from the get go.  Overall, one can see & appreciate much of the effort that went into this film. HOWEVER, more attention should have been given to cleaning up the CGI shots, employing actors who could actually act, and a MAJOR re-working of the script especially the dialog. After viewing Reptillian/Yonggary 2001, it is safe to say that Godzilla's place as ""King of The Monsters"" is most secure.",1015027200,,1186,4.59433962264151

THIS MOVIE REALLY [STINKS].  The acting is so bad, the effects are cheap-looking, the plot itself is boring.  This movie is a waste of time and money!!!

1623864,3,B00005M2C2,"""Reptilian"" is known in South Korea as ""Yonggary,"" and though the entire cast speak English, and the setting (of unnamed city) seems American, it is in fact a Korean production, and the history of Yonggary goes back to the release of the original version in 1967.  This means ""Reptilian"" is a remake of that one, and like Hollywood-made Godzilla movie, it is updated by CGI techonology.  The plot is simple.  Yonngary is a deadly monster that becomes a threat to human beings, destroying whatever comes in its sight, and controlled by aliens from the outer space.
You will see many familiar elements that you might have seen in other monster movies such as Godzilla series, and besides, most unique soldiers in the world -- they can fly and shoot cannons!  Frankly the plot is weak, the CGI looks unusual, and acting is ... never mind, if you love this genre, you wouldn't care.  You see a doctor (played by Harrison Young, elder Ryan in ""Saving Private Ryan"") who, as usual, gives a warning about the coming danger of Yonngary, but nobody listens, and a big monster starts to destroy, and on and on.
So this is strictly for the fans of the genre.  If you're, you will have a good time.  And please could anyone release the original ""Yonngary""?  I like the monster.",1007856000,11,1265,4.641255605381166
1623865,5,B00005M2C2,This movie in my opinion is a great monster movie. the story is good the effect's are great but one thing I do not understand is what did the invaders want with earth. they did not explain that very well in the story or if they did I did not understand it and another thing I did not understand was if the invaders already had a giant monster then why did they need the main monster in the story. but do not let that stop you from seeing this great movie if you are A real godzilla fan. then you will like this great monster flim.,1005609600,,530,4.009433962264151
1623866,3,B00005M2C2,"Being a long-time fan of the giant monster genre, I was caught by surprise by this one. It has all the hallmarks of a Toho studios Godzilla or Gamera flick (OK, except for the rubber suits and the fantastic miniature sets). It is no classic, but is passable in its own way. A great film for a Saturday afternoon. It seems to be part of a recent trend of giant monster films. I hope they continue making films of this type.",1000339200,,422,4.222222222222222
1623867,1,B00005M2C2,"This makes the American ""Godzilla"" film made in 1998 look good! The acting is awful. The effects are cheap. The script is terrible. Can you tell I didn't like the film? If you want a good recent Godzilla-like film, I'd try ""Gamera 3"", not this low budget disaster. Not even worth a rental.",998524800,2,289,4.471698113207547

It has what I'd consider some pretty darn good special effects, but the acting from some of the cast members was so so (maybe they spent all their moola on the special effects and had to skimp on the actors), but I still had a blast watching it and it more than satisfied my monster movie craving.  Big stomping lizardy fun!",998524800,3,478,4.359550561797753
7944708,1,B00005M2C2,Nothing about this dung heap is good. Cartoonish special fx and some of the worst acting I've ever seen completely ruined this movie. Not even on par with SyFy movies.,1524787200,,167,4.6

7944713,1,B00005M2C2,Worst movie I have ever seen.  Can't believe I actually watched 2/3 of it.  Most of the actors were terrible and at first I thought this was a spoof movie where the actors were suppose to over or under act.  Don't waste your time unless you like to poke fun at this kind of movie.,1512518400,,280,4.054545454545455
7944714,2,B00005M2C2,"As a COMEDY, it's a low two-stars fete.  As a Sci-Fi B movie, well, they don't seem to have a negative stars rating available.  I gave it two stars because if you see the humor, it is mildly entertaining.  Watch for the incredible miniatures work that was done.  The cars are not even as good as the Matchbox(R) brand toys.  Also, it's a real hoot when you see crowds of people running, and realize that somehow (magic?  insane serendipity??) they are all Japanese.  This seems to be a Japanese film that has intercut all American actors for cut-aways whenever dialogue requires someone's face to be shown.  And the monster's name? Yongarry?  What's the sequel - Yongarry / Yongross?",1512432000,,683,4.720338983050848
