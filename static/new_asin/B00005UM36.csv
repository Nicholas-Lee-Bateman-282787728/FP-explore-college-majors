7954757,4,B00005UM36,Very touching and gentle. For completest only. Also perfect for children. My 3 year old loves it.  The prints are about 90% clean and clear. The mono audio is also strong and even. Moe and Larry look very old. Much older than they really were at the time...As a fan of the Stooges from their heyday (1930-'43) it's a little hard to watch them. But it's best just to watch it and accept it for what it is...An end-cap to a very colorful and brilliant career.,1428019200,,457,4.313953488372093

7954759,5,B00005UM36,"Anyone who loves and remembers The Three Stooges cartoons will enjoy this DVD release. After years of terrible battered public domain releases, they finally got it right.

The cartoons look better than I remember and more importantly the shows are intact with their live action ""wraparounds"" featuring the aging stooges at the end of their impressive run. Even when I was young I could see this wasn't the stooges at the top of their game, but it's hard to dislike these goofy trips back in time.

As a kid, I always favored the Curley shorts, but soon came to love Shemp and even appreciate Joe!...and Curley Joe. The cartoons are low budget, but they do bring back memories.

The presentation of this release is what really stands out.

1)The cartoons look better than ever
2)The live action ""wraparounds"" are includes and the shows are presented like they were originally aired.
3)The menu is extremely user friendly and you can access any segment of live action or cartoon very easily.
4)Menu has a window next to each show with a portion of that episode playing to make it easier for you to find a particular segment.
5)The original opening and ending themes are intact on each cartoon.
6)The original show opener and closer is intact.

I liked the very short(6 minutes) but informative interview with Lee Orgel, but I wish there could have been a few more extras. The only part of the shows content that really shows it's age is the shows' opening and closing segment, which is totally acceptable.

Over all this is a really good release featuring 4 complete shows' which include 16 cartoons and their 16 ""wraparound"" segments.",1245283200,,1633,4.7935943060498225
7954760,4,B00005UM36,"Rhino's DVD release of ""The New Three Stooges"" cartoons from the 1960s is an absolute must for any Stooge fan.
First of all, this collection contains the first sixteen stooge cartoons: That Little Old Bomb Maker; Woodsmen Bear That Tree; Let's Shoot the Piano Player; Dentist the Menace; Safari So Good; Thimk of Thwim; There Auto Be a Law; That Old Shell Game; Hold That Line; Flycycle Built For Two; Dizzy Doodlers; The Chicken Delivery Boys; Movie Scars; A Bull for Andamo; The Tree Nuts; Tin Horn Dude.
These cartoons do not feature the greatest animation in the world (in fact, the animation makes ""Clutch Cargo"" look like ""Wallace and Gromit""), but they're a must for Stooge fans. Even better than the cartoons are the live action wraparounds by Moe, Larry, and Curly Joe DeRita (who were all looking incredibly old by this point). While the wraparounds are not up the the standard set by the old Columbia shorts, they're still fairly amusing and a Stooge fan's dream.
The picture quality of this release is amazing (at least compared to my muddy old videos). The colour on both the live action and animated segments is incredible, and they're both mostly free of grain. My only complaint is that the opening titles sequence is rather blurry.
On the special features front, there's an interview with supervising producer Lee Orgel, who has some interesting tidbits about the Stooges and some interesting behind-the-scenes facts.
All in all, if you're a Stooge fan, you NEED this collection of cartoons.",1041379200,,1508,4.91764705882353
7954761,5,B00005UM36,"Was so glad to find these cartoons finally released by a top-rate CO.....RHINO!  GREAT cover too!  I love these cartoons!  Yes they were cheaply done by CAMBRIA and the live-action sequences were not the STOOGES at their BEST BUT they are fun and entertaining!  Love the intro/closing and the theme song too!
Nice that they also included everything in complete one-hour episodes.",1010707200,5,379,5.064516129032258
7954762,2,B00005UM36,"I have not seen this DVD, but I can tell you something about the Three Stooges cartoons. Most of them are not very good (which accounts for the only two stars rating), but a few have their moments. For example, in the one where they are explorers in Egypt Moe makes a quip about his ""portable Rosetta Stone"". That's pretty witty for the Three Stooges!
Some fans my age may anticipate these more than others, and for that a little history is in order. When these 156 cartoons were released in syndication in 1965, the Columbia two-reelers had been released to television 6 years befpre. So we young fans were hungry for any new Stooges product. Not only did the Stooges provide their own voices (unlike Hanna-Barbera's Laurel and Hardy cartoons circa the same period), but there were live action wraparound intros to each cartoon. In color!
Recently those live wraparounds have been released without the cartoons by Good Times, and many ...fans wrote in to say they were horrible. Well, they ain't great but they were never meant to be viewed without the cartoons.
I don't know which of the cartoons will be available in this collection - and if there's a volume one, perhaps there will be a volume 2. And at the promised 113 minutes, there should be pretty many.
These cartoons were available about 14 years ago on video from Nelson Entertainment, who released every cartoon - except one! Maybe this collection will rectify that.",1009584000,3,1429,4.742971887550201
