8629260,4,B00H2N44TG,Our kids love both Ninjago and Hero Factory and we've seen it a hundred times (not exaggerating). The Hero Factory discs have independant stories. The two Ninjago DVDs have a few episodes each but there are a few episodes missing between the two. So I'll have to buy the full season DVDs to make the series complete. That's the only annoying thing. I'd have bought the seasons DVDs instead of this combo pack if I had known. Otherwise very entertaining for boys and girls alike.,1424044800,5,478,4.635294117647059
