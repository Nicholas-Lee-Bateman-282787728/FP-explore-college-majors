8410909,5,B002EQA0UI,"A beautifully simple documentary about Menashe Kadishman's lifestyle, which presents him as a gentle and eccentric soul, treasured by his family, indulged and enjoyed by his friends. I bought it because his sheep paintings caught my eye (and how I'd dearly love to own one)and I wanted to know who he was and what he was like.

He talks about his childhood, showing us the house he grew up in whilst drawing on the walls, like a child, to show us where everyone and everything used to be. A born artist, he seems to see beauty in everything - 'it's beautiful, isn't it?' he says, frequently. The simple music and lighting in the film create a sense of calm and peace - I felt I could have sat and watched it all day - and there are moments of humour, for example, a woman stops him in the street and commands that he draws 'an Indian' for her (which he obligingly does) and we see his cheekiness when he chucks a bucket of cold water over his old mate in the swimming pool shower. Fascinating to watch him actually painting - using what looks like a stick with an ancient lump of bandage stuck on the end, dripping in paint - it looks so primitive and instinctive, yet what he creates is so perfect and touching. He says every painting he does is of his mother and I can see how. Kadishman come across as a wild creature of some sort, gentle but stubborn, perhaps like the sheep he loves so much. Dressed in his white nightie and coat, living his life the way it pleases him, surrounded by his memories and keepsakes, he's doing what his soul drives him to do. I can see he exasperates his family who probably gave up trying to tame him long ago, but they're also proud of him, as so they should be - what an enormous body of work he's produced and how dramatically beautiful.",1349654400,,1776,4.333333333333333
