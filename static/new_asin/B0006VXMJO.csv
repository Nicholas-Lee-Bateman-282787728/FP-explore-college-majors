8043738,4,B0006VXMJO,"This was my first look at TRANSFORMERS DVDs but it was a must since our son is into the toys.  We were pleasantly surprised by this colorful, fun DVD.  I think the computer-generated additions to the animation looks cool.  The toys look just like the characters too!!!  You can tell this is a commercial for the toys but we don't mind.  But if the target audience is boys around 5-7 (the toys are for 5+), why do the characters call each other ""loser!"" all the time?  In the ""Return of Megatron"" DVD Kicker says sarcastically ""That really bites!""  This gets repeated on the playground or worse yet to adults.  The writers should use better judgement.  But then again does anything on CARTOON NETWORK escercise good judgement for kid-viewing.  Not from what I've seen.  The only drawback on the ""Shockblast"" DVD is the annoying character, Kicker, who has calmed down a bit and is given a bit less screen time in this DVD.

If this is for your kids, I recommend this and the ""Omega Supreme"" DVD but steer clear of the ""Search for Energon"" and ""Return of Megatron"" DVDs.  I noticed that there is a Canadian rating stamp on these and the two DVDs I liked both get ""G"" ratings and the two I don't like get a ""PG"".  Somehow I think the Canadian rating scale must be very well calibrated to match up to a sensitive parent like myself.  So let's have more ""G"" rated Transformers DVDs from Paramount/Hasbro!!!",1113091200,9,1400,4.544
8043739,4,B0006VXMJO,"The episodes of this DVD are mainly concerned with the plot points of Shockblast escaping prison on Cybertron, Wing Dagger being upgraded to Wing Saber, and Megatron gaining total control of Unicron. The problem is that they skip episodes, like the episode that shows Wing Dagger and Tidal Wave getting destroyed. Now, they include the episode that shows Wing Dagger being upgraded to Wing Saber, but in the episodes, Tidal Wave turns to Mirage for seemingly no real reason. The episodes are good, but they really should put more episodes in",1111104000,,541,4.956043956043956
