First of all lets get some compatibility issues out of the way.

All the DVDs in this box set are Region 0 or Region Free. They should work on any DVD player. I believe the other reviewer may have had a PAL issue. The first 10 seasons are PAL and Season 11 claims to be NTSC, but more on that in a second.

I took the Season One DVD and put it in a PS3 hooked up HDMI on an older Sony HD TV and it would not play. The PS3 said PAL is an unsupported format, but i think that was because the TV itself does not support it.

I then took the Season One DVD. I put it in a PS4 hooked up HDMI to a newer Samsung HD TV. The TV switched over to the PAL standard and began to play with no issues.

I then decided to try Season 11 how ever I got the same PAL is not a supported format warning on the PS3 so the box seems to be misprinted. So i can not stress enough to anyone looking to buy this to make sure that you are able to play it back,

Now that we have gotten compatibility out of the way lets talk about the packaging.
The set comes in a three piece orange box that is designed to look like a flight data recorder and it is a nice touch. There is a cardboard slip case that you slide off and then a little fabric tab you pull to slide the slightly smaller box holding the DVDs from the bigger lid box.

The DVDs themselves come in clear plastic normal sized DVD cases with seasons that have two discs have a disc on each side and three or four disc seasons having a middle swing flap.

There are no inserts. The episode titles and a little bit about the episode is written on the reverse side of the art work and visible though the clear plastic, but you have to remove the DVD to read it. There is a little bit about each season written on the back. The episodes are also numbered by the complete series, and not by season. For example Season 9 episode one is listed as episode 59.

The discs themselves contain about 3-4 episodes per disc depending of course on how many total. Some seasons have four discs some have one disc. There is also no bonus footage and nothing interactive about the DVDs. It's pop in and pick an episode or play all.

Another interesting note is the use of titles. the packaging uses the title  Air Crash Investigations The Australian title. The DVD package uses the same and so do the DVD Menus, but the actual video intro are Mayday intros. The discs and episodes themselves seem to use the Canada episode titles.

For anyone curious every season except 2 and 3 is rated PG 2 and 3 are rated M, but keep in mind these are Australian Classification Board ratings.

The thing that would of given it an extra star for me is if some bonus things were included. How an episode is made, facts and trivia about planes, intros from the other versions.

Lastly for anyone looking to complete the set Season 12 has also been released on DVD.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Air-Crash-Investigations-Season-12-DVD/dp/B00EJ4P3Z0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Air Crash Investigations: Season 12 DVD</a>

EDIT 1. The episodes are a little out of order. Some seasons don't match up with the wiki entry witch is listed in production order and other seasons do.
Season 10 is in production order on the disc. Some earlier seasons were not just in case anyone gets thrown off.

EDIT 2.
Season 7 Episode 2/Series Episode 50 entitled Lockerbie Disaster is written on the inside of the artwork with a description, but is not actually on the disc. Nor is it on Disc 2 at the moment of me writing this it does not seem to be included in the set. I will update if i find it on another disc.",1389571200,,3823,4.318435754189944
8605942,1,B00EJ7D2V4,"At this time, I am communicating with the vendor who sent me the DVDs.  The set sent to me is formatted for Region 0 and our DVDs in the United States are formatted for Region 1.  Therefore they cannot be played on US made DVD players.
This set was very expensive and I hope that someone (vendor or Amazon) will make good on the purchase or refund my money. I am a very good customer of Amazon (prime) and hope that some type of resolution will be made to my satisfaction.
I would appreciate your following up on this situation. Thanks
