1740816,5,B00006AUH9,"With all of the BORING shows on TV which could almost be cookie cutter cut outs of each other in terms of jokes, writing and taste of humor, wouldn't it be great if we actually saw something different for once?  Thank god that a show was made that could always make one laugh and never fails to show how outragous (without being completely tasteless) a show could be.  That show is The Young Ones, and thank god (yes again) that it has made it on to DVD.
The show premise is simple.  Four young english college students live together in the most squalid of houses and go to the ficticous Scumbag University.  Each one of these guys is completely different, original, and almost always getting on one anothers nerves.  Vyvian is the standout, a punk with dyed orange hair, metal stars glued to his forehead and decorated in denim and chains.  He's going to school to be a doctor and spends most of his time destroying the house or harrassing his roommates.  Rick is a Socialology student who always manages to have his loud voice heard, whether calling people Nazis, Facists or Commies, spouting bad poetry or vocalizing an obsession about singer Cliff Richards.  Neil is a fan favorite.  A downtrodden and dirty hippie who takes the most abuse from any of the other guys.  He often can be seen doing 1 of 2 things, cooking his favorite food, lentils or planning some form of suicide.  Mike the final character claims to study in the school of life and is always looking for a way to scam anybody somehow for whatever he can or always trying to pick up whatever girl he can find.  A fifth cast member Alexei Sayle pops in occasionally for some of his own brand of humor and plays multiple roles from episode to episode.  Usually he's the guy's landlord.  (You may hate him at first, but he does grow on you little by little.)
The show doesn't stop there, in between the show we are treated to unusall side storys, existentialism of sorts, musical guests playing a hit song and other bizzare situations which have absolutely nothing to do with the show.  Ths show is a bit dated, particularly with the musical guests (try asking anyone under the age of 13 who Motorhead or The Damned are,) but that doesn't hurt the show much.
Plots of the show are decent enough DEMOLITION has city hall condemning the guy's house, but if Vyvian destroys the house form the inside, will the council still bother?  OIL has the boys breaking in their new house with Mike finding Buddy Holly in his room and Vyvian finding oil in the basement.  BORING, one of the better eps from season 1 has the guys being so bored that even a little demon on the loose in the living room and Vyvian cutting his finger off go unnotticed.  INTERESTING has Mike throwing a party which quickly goes out of control once the pub closes.  Watch for Rick playing with a certain ""object"" in a purse, it's hilarious.  BOMB involves an atomic bomb that has landed in the house.  Can Mike sell it to the underworld before Vyvian blows it up?  In the house?!  FLOOD has the guys running out of food, and when the water gets too deep, they consider canibalizm.  BAMBI is the most famous episode with the boys voting never to do their laundry again and being accepted onto a college gameshow.  NASTY, another popular one has Vyv and Mike getting a VCR (new at the time) and later being attacked by a Vampire.  CASH is about how winter has rolled around and with no money, the guys are burning their possesions for heat.  When Vyvian makes his ""special"" anouncement, prepare to laugh.  TIME has Rick lying about an affair with an escaped murderrer and the house being taken back to the middle ages.  Vyvian attacking Rick with a howitzer is hysterical.  SICK has all 4 guys being sick with horrible colds and later decide to alter the show based on Neal's moms suggestions.  Rick being harrassed by his consciense is probably one of the funniest scenes in the series.  SUMMER HOLLIDAY has summer begining and the guys being bored (again).  Not even setting Rick on fire or attempting a bank robbery can kill the time.
Now does this sound like your average show?  Does it sound like something completely original and needed on TV today?  Do you like violent slapstick and mindless, hilarious destruction?  If you said Yes to any of these questions, you know what to do.  Good Show!",1031702400,15,4329,4.560880829015544

1740942,4,B00006AUH9,"""The Young Ones"" was a usually a fantastic comedy series. A weak episode or two exists, but nearly all are gems. My complaints are just three:
(1) the DVD has the somewhat inescapable plugs for other BBC videos
(2) the episodes on a DVD cannot be clicked on by name, which would make sense, but on a triangle that appears when the mouse is over the name (I only watch these on a laptop)
(3) the region code is North America but I currently live in Japan. Since the BBC is, to my knowledge, a public entity, why is there an assigned regional code at all? I find it hard to believe that this product is threatened by pirate versions.",1269129600,,631,4.266666666666667

1740944,5,B00006AUH9,"This is quite simply a unique comedy series. The spontinaety and nihilism displayed in this collection shows how politically correct the world has become in more recent times. The second series gets even more interesting as surrealist elements start to creep in further and further. In the end, the most disappointing episode is the last one - which comes across almost like a filler after some of the highlights of earlier pieces (""Sick"" and ""Bambi"" being classic episodes). Alexi Sayles cameos and live bands playing as a mock intermission just add to the mahem. A great work which didn't make the mistake of taking a good yarn to too many episodes (12 altogether).",1215388800,,667,4.911504424778761
1740945,4,B00006AUH9,"The differences between American and British humor become very apparent in this show.  Personally, I love this Britcom, but I can see where it would be hard for some Americans to swallow.  Mostly written by Ric Mayall, Ben Elton and Lise Mayer, but occasional references are made to other writers.  The show features 4 college students who are all on grants, but none of them seem to ever make it into a classroom.  They are all best friends, although they all hate each other.  They constantly argue and often try to kill each other.  Ric Mayall plays Rick, the geek that no one likes even though he calls himself The People's Poet and a big Cliff Richard fan.  Adrian Edmondson plays Vyvian, the medical student punk rocker who believes 'why open a door when you can blow it up instead?'  Nigel Planer is Neil, the hippie who is into love, peace and killing himself.  And Christopher Ryan plays Mike, the self-professed cool guy and lady's man, the only one of the 4 than anyone respects, but still he got real nervous when a vampire got loose in the house and he was reminded that vampires only attack virgins.  Alexei Sayle also joins the cast as various members of the Balowski family (including the landlord).  He usually sticks around only long enough to set up a premise where he is allowed to spew out a quick stand-up comedy routine that he wrote himself.  Then, he disappears.  Apparently, the show got permission to put musical acts in the show, so they could get variety show funding.  Usually a band such as Madness, Dexy's Midnight Runners or some '80s band that never made it over here in The States gets to lip-sync one song that has nothing to do with the plot, then they disappear.  The show often drifts off the plot into strange scenes that make no sense.  Some would say it adds to the shows charm.  Others would find it aggravating.  I find that once you watch the show a few times, it really starts to grow on you.  As I said, I love this show...but it's appeal is not universal.  It's full of fun and mayhem, violence, demolition, arguing and attempted suicide....all done with an '80s youthful British flare.  What could be funnier?",1212019200,4,2158,4.582245430809399
1740946,4,B00006AUH9,"I get the sense in reading some others' reviews that this show has a lot of nostalgic appeal for many. I'm writing this, however, just having seen it for the first time. And, I'll say that it's a clever bit of business but not the be-all-end-all of comedy.

Here's the truth: the show has a funny set-up. The Young Ones is about four mismatched college students sharing a flat: Rick, the militant socialist (or, at least he poses as one); Vyvyan, the blindly-destructive punk; Mike, the skirt-chasing young capitalist; Neil, the depressed hippie.  The characters are all well-acted (especially Rick & Neil), very distinct and excellently crafted. And, whenever the show focuses on their characters and the in-fighting that must necessarily arise, it's pretty excellent.

However, the show too often allows itself to follow its variety-show tangents, to stand-up comedy by a not-very-funny Alexei Sayle, other one-shot sketches, or to guest musical acts. None of these distractions are as funny, or satisfying, as the core material, and they ultimately take away from the show. (I understand that these asides were partially due to the show's origins in England's Comedy Clubs, and partly to secure a larger BBC budget by being able to describe itself as ""variety""... but 20+ years later, those reasons do not matter so much to the viewer as the end result.)

Also, I don't know what to account this to exactly, but the show's first series is its pinnacle -- the second series doesn't quite measure up, and is noticeably flagging by the last couple of episodes. It seems hard for me to believe that they should have ever run short of material, here, but then again, the characters are never allowed to grow or change, so the show was bound eventually to grow stale, sooner or later.

Shortcomings aside, at its best the show is very entertaining, and the main four are instant icons. It's easy to see why the show has maintained cult appeal for all this time, and can be recommended for all fans of culty-british humor without hesitation.

Many great tv comedies get their start in the U.K. such as ""The Office"", ""All in the Family"" and ""I Love Lucy"" which all stole their premises from great British comedies.  The Young Ones would never make it in the U.S.  because americans aren't ready for the brutally physical comedy, and wry British humor.  That would be way too advanced for tv watchers across the pond in the U.S.  Therefore, I love this DVD set.

I think the key to the series was that although each of the characters were gross exagerations of stereotypes they weren't so badly exagerated that you couldn't recognize them for they were.

Oddly enough, this is a show in which I don't think anyone in the viewing audience identified with any of the characters, either consciously or unconsciously.

1740955,5,B00006AUH9,"This program is not the type I would normally like - puerile, violent, slap-stick. But for some reason I love it.

Quintessentially British, this series is not for all Americans. If you liked the Monty Python TV shows - not the movies, which tend to have less-British oriented themes - give this series a try.

My favorite character is Neil, the hippie who's perpetually confused, and put-upon by the others. Some of his lines are classic. But all of the main characters have their moments...I also love how 'campy' the look of the whole thing. Never mind that CG was pre-infancy in those days. The show just wouldn't be the same without the obvious looking visual stunts or really fake looking singing/figure skating vegetables.

Interesting tidbit about this series is how many 'rules' it broke. It is anarchic in its format and politics, and none of the characters are likable. It was a big risk for the BBC, and it took some time to win its audience.

One of the fun things about the shows now is looking for early-career appearances from now-famous Brit actors: Emma Thompson, Hugh Laurie, Robbie Coltrane, Stephen Fry, Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders etc etc etc. It's interesting to see how much cross-pollination there was between BBC comedies: Of course, Saunders went on to AbFab (along with Christopher Ryan, Mike in The Young Ones, who becomes Marshall in AbFab), Hugh Laurie (who went on to Black Adder and other silly funny roles before turning serious in House), Dawn French (co-creator of AbFab who went on to Vicar of Darby), and of course, Rik Mayall, Adrian Edmondson, and Nigel Planer who went on to Filthy Rich and Catflap and Bottom.... the list goes on and on.",1185235200,3,1682,4.809688581314879

What were they thinking when they first canceled Family Guy, yet let Friends run far longer than it should (and thats one episode).  The only two ""dangerous"" comedys that ever made it past a few seasons were Married...With Children and All In the Family; and those shows even got soft toward the end of their long runs.

The Young Ones is an early victim of this stupidity. Lucky for everyone interested, Bottom is also for sale.  THAT STILL DOES NOT MAKE UP FOR THIS!

If you are reading this and can understand the point I made, than this comedy is a blast.  You can easily tell its quality by its ability to grow on you, like an Avant-Garde album.",1163462400,4,715,4.412213740458015

I was watching this show in my Dental clinic in Iraq when we had a bunch of British and Scottish guys come in. They all freaked out and went off about the show and how old they were when it came out and how fondly they loved the show. I also got a lesson on some of the other shows like Bottom and a stage show with members of the cast etc. The 1st episode of Bottom was one of the extras in the set!!
I love the show and it is still funny today even though I was 2 when the show came out, all the jokes still work, and it has that timeless apeal to it. I watched almost the whole series with the Brits and Scotts, it was my first time seeing all the episodes but we all laughed like it was the first time an of us had seen the shows.

Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson, with their unique social consciousness, manage to give a glimpse of 80's socio-political humour that blends just enough ""slacker"" mentality to make The Young Ones hard to put down.

1740993,5,B00006AUH9,"This was one hilarious British comedy that captured the 80s mainstreaming of New Wave (formerly punk rock) at a very brief moment.  They were the perfect melding of stereotypical college students: the dirty hippie, the punk rocker, the shifty cheat who seems to live a double life, and the new wave liberal.  They're young, loud and snotty, and proud of it!  And did they have filthy hygiene habits!  The music acts they had on were perfect snapshots of the time.  Some faded away into obscurity, some remain classics (Madness, The Damned and Motorhead made some memorable appearances) that we go back to when nostalgia rotates.  Neil's moaning and depression are hilarious, Rik's annoying, Mike's a scumbag, and Vyvyan's a self destructive antics make them all the most obnoxious bunch of guys who ever shared a house.  Something about the filth of the houses they lived in, their terrible attitudes, and the violence was so punk rock.  And it's completely brilliant!

The series are just as I remembered with bands like Madness, Motorhead and the like, and if you remember there were microseconds of video clips of scenes inserted in the video episodes from who knows what....they are there also.

1740995,5,B00006AUH9,"Well I am glad to see some glowing reviews for 'The Young Ones' because it deserves it!

UK comedy was always in the shadow of 'Python' until in the early 80's a comedy revolution swept through and cleared out all the 'chaff' that was gathering dust in British humour. Alternative comedy...

As Alexi Sayle said 'I'm an alternative comedian..now I'm funny, now I'm not, now I'm funny, now I'm not...'

This program quite literally influenced British culture inside and outside of the television like no other program I can recall.

The co-writer Ben Elton was one of britains most talented script writers at that time...working on Black Adder for instance...he was also a superb standup comedian and hosted 'Saturday Night Live' where a whole new wave of alternative comedians found the spotlight (Harry Enfield, for instance, whose character's 'Stavros' and 'loadsamoney' basically turned him into a superstar in the UK... 'Loadsamoney' T-shirts sold thousands...) Ben Elton has also written many successful novels.

'The Young Ones' is so full of creative energy you get the feeling of a tremendous force bursting to be released in every episode and sometimes it goes a bit haywire to say the least!. Some of the show's lose control a little in the story line and become 'stream of conciousness' towards the end with often sudden finishes like 'Is that the time? <end>' and 'Now there's a funny thing! <end>' but in the subsequent series 'The comic strip presents...' with the same group of actors, the scripts were far more polished and complete.

The pure energy of Rick Mayells performances are quite extraordinary and influenced me as a kid...in my opinion one of the finest performance's ever in british comedy.

Well, as you may have guessed, this comedy has a big part in my history growing up...I was a huge fan (and pretty good rik impersonator!) and if you can get hold of it the 'The young one's book' is hilarious as well.",1118880000,4,1936,4.902140672782875
1740996,4,B00006AUH9,"I'm a bit bitter to find that our release here in Australia is only 2 discs of the shows with no bonus features at all, but putting that aside, The Young Ones is one of the all time greatest BBC shows.

There a bunch of college misfits living together. Vivian is the punk who likes to break things, he's always smashing plates and furniture over someones head, and usualy everything he says has me laughing my arse off. Neil is the depressed hippie who no one listens to, he's always going on about something or plotting how to commit suicide, but never sucseeds. Rick is a snotty little revolutionist that is quite fond of himself, but no one else is. And Mike completes the 4 housemates as a confident ladys man (in his own mind)who is the brains of the house hold.

Together they live and only get along some of the time. There is always tension, misshaps and things being broken. Also there is Alexsie Sayle who comes in as a diffrent charactor all the time, and usualy plays a weird enough charactor to make you laugh some more. Aswell as the shows creator Ben Elton making a few little appearences here and there.

The two season are hillarious, from actors to puppets farting out of the room, it's a laughing riot. Some of the gags are dated, but it's all still a laugh and a half of great humour and over the top antics.... they just don't make shows as good as this comedy anymore.",1118448000,3,1390,4.400778210116732
1740997,5,B00006AUH9,"It's rude, violent and vile. And I love it. In the early 1980's, alternative comedy was beginning to take hold in Britain, and the Young Ones really led the way. The phenomenal cast includes Nigel Planer, Christopher Ryan, Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall as four lazy students living in a rundown apartment. Antics include a yearly pilgramage to the laundrette, an ill-advised appearance on University Challenge, and a petrol bomb in the fridge. It's the style, certainly not the premise, that makes this so appealing. Intermingled in the loose storylines are performances by musical guests (like The Damned), cutaways to scenes that have nothing to do with the story, and lots more. Oh yes, there are numerous references to the god-like Cliff Richard as well.

Watch the whole set and you'll spot British comedy luminaries in various one-off roles, including Hugh Laurie, Robbie Coltrane, Emma Thompson, Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders (aka Mrs. Adrian Edmondson).

The series is, quite frankly, brilliant. And it all comes to a tragic end in ""Summer Holiday"" (a Cliff Richard song, naturally), when the boys drive their stolen double-decker bus off a cliff, exploding upon landing.

""I'm on board the freedom bus, and I haven't even paid my fare!"" exclaims Rik with glee. Indeed. Buy this now.",1113350400,13,1297,5.1084905660377355

1740999,5,B00006AUH9,"Probably the best series the BBC has ever offered outside of Monty Python.

One of the programmes that brought 'alternative' comedy to British television screens, complete with rambling plots, 'comic asides' and 'musical interludes'. It concerns the daily life and 'adventures' of a group of students living in a sleazy house. The creators were making an attempt to develop characters that no one would like or be able to sympathize with.  They failed miserably, much to the delight of many the world through-out.  This is essential viewing for anyone with a sense of humour and punk aesthetic.

Rick (Rik Mayall) is a fanatical disciple of Cliff Richard, eager to protest his lack of virginity at every opportunity.

Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson) is a total nutter, hell bent on bringing about maximum mayhem and destruction.

Neil (Nigel Planer) is a hippy type who does most of the cooking (mainly with lentils) and cleaning (what there is of it).

Mike (Christopher Ryan) is a smoothie, totally out of step with the rest of the no-hope loonies in the house.

Alexei Sayle appears as various members of the Balowski family and contributes a variety of short 'asides' during episodes.",1112486400,,1182,5.0256410256410255
1741000,5,B00006AUH9,"What you need to know is that this is one of the most ridiculous and bright telley shows ever created.  It is totally absurd and for that reason it is quite hilarious.  At times is seems stupid but then it amazes the viewer with bright lines and absolute hilarity.  I first encountered ""The Young Ones"" when it was shown on Comedy Central in the early '90's.  I was an early teen then and while I found it funny I think I can relate to it much better now.  This boxed set of DVD's is terrific and the best assortment of ""The Young Ones"" available.

The show is comprised of for young men Vyvyan, Neil Rick and Mike who share an apartment.  Vyvyan is a vim and venom punk rocker, Neil is a burnt out hippie, Mike is sort a total lady-killer and Rick is a Communist pseudo intellectual.  Naturally these four don't fit well together and each has a different way of handling the insane situations they  find themselves in.  Almost every scene of every episode is shot in their apartment and in spite of this money saving technique the show is fantastic and though sometimes a little slap sticky.

My favorite character is Rick: his lines are well written and ring so true as he tries to be a smart little Marxist.  He is also such a funny character to watch as his blood boils in aggravation with his housemates antics. Vyvyan angers him as he generally finds breaking things to be the solution to any problem.  Vyvyan is often the instigator or the exacerbator of the mayhem that transpires.  Neil and Mike are also necessary characters though I don't think they are the stars of this show.

You had better go and get this now before something bad happens to you.  This really is a great show and is certainly among the best British TV available.  If you like Mr. Bean, The Simpsons, Family guy or Malcolm in the Middle this show will certainly appeal to you.  This DVD set is the best way to get the show and is well worth the price.

Two bad things....the first write-ups for preorders said ""features two never before seen episodes"" which turned out to be two entirely differant shows (Bottom and Filthy) and there weren't enough Young Ones made.....Try to find some Comic Strip Presents... if you like this.

As I remember, it was a good one, but Summerland got strange(r?) about his music following the end of the Police.  This isn't the BBC's fault (for once).
I adore this series-- it really showcases some powerhouse talents, some great early slapstick with Ade & Rik, and guest appearances of most of this Brit generation's comic greats.

If you remember The Young Ones from watching it at the time - buy this! If you've never heard of the show - buy this!
Oh - and John Liosatos - ""A Fistful of Travellers Checks"" was an episode from the classic ""Comic Strip Presents"" series - big overlaps between the Comic Strip and Young Ones' casts.

But reading a review complaining about the poor quality DVD because of all these random clips was one of the funniest things I've read in a while.  If they were not in there I wouldn't even think of buying the DVD!  I just can't believe that such a cult classic show only produced 12 episodes :(

Now for what's missing.  Does anyone remember a parody of a spaghetti western called ""A Fistful of Travellers Checks""?  The only recollection I have of this episode is Rik in a Black Bart outfit donning a black cowboy hat, and a wide shot of an old west town with a sign on a building reading ""Hotel Bastardos"" in the background.  If anyone has any info on this episode, please write to me.  My address is jliosatos@hotmail.com.  I was hoping it would be included on the bonus disc in this set, but unfortunately it's not.

1741039,5,B00006AUH9,"This show broke all the rules of the BBC in it's time! Many of the scenes would not even go over on prime time US TV right now! Running only a couple of seasons(1982-1984) All together. The Young Ones made a great impact to British comedy. They loved Monty Python but wanted to shock people even more, So that is what they did. The BBC never saw anything like it!! You have four young guys living together picking on each other and British pop lengend...Cliff Richard, Constantly. You have Rik, (Rik Mayall) A poet in his own mind. Thinks of himself as a really cool/hip guy but is really a bit of a nerd. Vivian the crazy punk/metal head (Adrain Edmondson) Who loves to smash and break things. Mike (Christopher Ryan) The ladies man who always leads the others. And last Neil (Nigel Planer) The hippy who everyone loves to make fun of and who takes most of the insults. Put them all together in a small house and it's a slug-fest! I bought this set on VHS only a few years ago for almost twice the price. At last on DVD and at this price! You can't go wrong. This DVD set also includes two other projects Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson did after the Young Ones. Not long after the show Rik and Ade teamed up again for the show, Filthy Rich and Catflap, It's not that good. However, On this DVD set is the first episode of Bottom. This is very good!! Rik And Ade team up again and go back to what they do so well...Working together. Also on this set are a a couple extra features on the making/history of The Young Ones.

I like it better than Dylan's version.  It is not on the video release either.",1065916800,2,401,4.671428571428572
1741043,5,B00006AUH9,"There was never anything quite like The Young Ones and there never will be. It's almost impossible to copy this outrageously bizarre and far-fetched TV show anyway. It's even impossible to exaggerate how crazy it was. Do I have to say I totally love it? each episode is crammed full of eternally quotable dialogue, wonderful physical comedy and insane, unexpected plot developments. The Young Ones takes place in a universe where absolutely ANTHING can and WILL happen.
Rick is undeniably the best character tho. He and Vivian get into the stupidest fights and argue over the dumbest of things. Neil the hippy is also consistently amusing in his many failed attempts to off himself. Mike hardly ever had any funny lines but thankfully no episode really ever revolved around him. Plus a Bolowski family member (always played by Alexi Sayle) pops up in each episode to add to the mayhem.
What makes the show priceless are the totally irrelevant and senseless intercut scenes. Check out the episode 'CASH' for the best example of this. And, in an effort to raise the budget from 'sitcom' to 'light entertainment' the show had a musical performance each week from the likes of Jools Holland, Madness and Motorhead. They never intrude tho as they are cut over madcap montages.
It speaks volumes of the youth of 80's Britain and has a lot to say about the politics of the Tory Government at the time. All four play penniless students, surviving on lentils, who are completely unconcerned about their exams or coming bottom in the whole world. This is mainly channelled thru Rick (Mayall co-wrote the show with Ben Elton) who is the most studenty of them all, a wannabe anarchist and people's poet. Vyvian is a hard, hardcore Sex Pistols-like punk/thug who thinks nothing of having steel stars stuck onto his forehead or chopping his fingers off for a laugh. Neil smells. And has no quibbles picking up dead pigeons off the street to cook for dinner. Mike is a ladies man, despite the fact there are precious few ladies around him. All four get on like a house burning down. Or exploding like a cigar thrown into fart gas.
The show was shot on early 80's video with an aspect ratio of 1.33:1. the picture quality is not the best but it's always looked like a TV show so it's perfectly adequate. The sound is Mono but that's all you need to enjoy.
The extras seem cool but they're not really. There is a bonus episode from Filthy Rich and Catflap and one from Bottom (the episode 'Smells' in which Ritchie and Eddie try to lure two lesbians with foul-smelling pheromone spray). The 15-minutes long 'Creating the Young Ones' is quite superficial and deserved to be much longer. And where are the new interviews with Edmondson, Ryan and Sayle? The same applies to 'The Young Ones and the 80s'. Why wasn't it longer? Five postcards of all the main stars are also included in the set. And you must buy it.",1064016000,5,2893,4.696850393700787
1741044,5,B00006AUH9,"When I was younger, in the early 80's I would watch ""The Young Ones"" religiously on MTV.  Although I don't recall that much, except Madhouse, Dexy Midnight Runners  and the characters of Neil, Rick and Vyvyan, this is one DVD collection for those who have the seen show which I can say is that it's very much worth getting.  The memories of the show really brought back the musical memories of the early days and this is like discovering a time capsule.  I was so stoked to buy this DVD!  There are many wonderful reviews on Amazon about the show and synopsis of the show, so what I'll get into in this review is more or less for the newbie and is the DVD worth getting. I'm one of the guys who enjoys introducing people to things outside of their usual paradigm and friends who have a curiousity of the show and have been newly enjoying BBC entertainment have asked if the DVD is worth getting.  Will they love it?  They loved Fawlty Towers, they loved Coupling a lot but will they love ""The Young Ones"".  So, if you are one of those individuals, I have to say that ""The Young Ones"" is unique because although there is a story, things really go off in different places with each character.  Each character are very different, it's hillarious to see them diss each other and to see a punk, an wannabe anarchist, a hippie and a money grubbing womanizer interact is quite hillarious for me.  A friend asked if it's like ""Dumb and Dumber"" type comedy and I really can't say that it is.  It's a comedy that's unique in itself because it does something that other comedies don't do or have never done on television.  You can have a story but then it will switch to another character or people and disrupt the storyline but if you have an open mind to ridiculous comedy especially during the 80's, you will love the episodes.  One episode which I found hillarious is when the guys haven't wash their clothes in years and poor Neil is called smelly.  Unfortunately, when they try to wash their clothes, even the machines reject their smelly clothes.  When Rick pulls down his trousers, exposing the raunchiest brown and stained underwear ever seen on television...e[...] But the episodes are so funny.  As for the DVD, I think being treated with those bonus episodes of shows that the other actors have been part of such as ""Filty Rich & Catflap"" and ""Bottom"" were great additions to the DVD's.  ""Bottom"" is so funny with Mayall and Edmondson as roommates who desperately want to score with girls and spray tons of hormone drenching cologne on them to see if it does attract women.  then you have the two featurettes and much more.  The video and audio quality is good for it's time, so don't expect 5.1 surround sound.  And yes, there is English subtitling to understand some words that may come so quickly.  All in all, for those who never seen it or want to try it, if you are into crazy humor featuring the world's stickiest booger, a nuclear bomb next to a fridge and a singing tomato, you'll love the episodes and the DVD is a definite bonus!  Fans of the 80's show...this DVD is definitely worth buying!",1061596800,,3103,4.5134168157423975

1741047,5,B00006AUH9,"Being only 18, I might have been born a decade too late, but The Young Ones is still as apparently funny now in 2003 as it was back in 1982. The constant bad jokes, the stereotypical characters, (Mike the playboy, Rick the anarchist, Vyvyan the metalhead punk and Neil the hippie) but mostly the pure physical comedy dynamic of Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall is what gives this show its extra brilliance.
I was subjected to Drop Dead Fred and Bottom before I'd ever seen The Young Ones, so I was properly prepared for the humour value of Rik. The real talent in the show lies in underappreciated comedian, Alexei Sayle, who wrote all the extra sketches within the show, and starred as all the members of the Balowski family - Jerzei, Reggie, Alexei, Tommy, Billy, and Brian.
Basic lowdown of the show -
Series 1 -
Episode 1 - Demolition
This episode is just when the characters are first being developed, so they're a little sketchy. Still really funny. Vyvyan comes home and tells the guys that the council has given the okay for the house to be demolished the next morning. After attempting to kill himself, Neil makes his last lentil supper as a final positive action, Rik goes on a protest, Mike tries to bed the lady from the council board, and Vyv smashes the place up. Classic.
Features Nine Below Zero playing live.
Episode 2 - Oil
The guys move into a new place. Mike turns Rick's room into a roller disco, and forces him to double up with Neil. The next day, Vyvyan strikes oil in the basement while playing Murder in The Dark, and as a result, Mike becomes the fascist ""El Presidente"". Together with his henchman Colonel Vyvyan, they order Neil and Rick to dig up all the oil.
Rick organises a mass rock concert benefit  to help the oppressed workers of the house, and it goes horribly wrong.
Episode 3 - Boring
The guys are absolutely bored, and nothing can save them now. A round of Monopoly bores Neil so much that he goes and digs a grave for himself, ""just in case."" To combat boredom, the guys leave the house and go down to the Kebab and Calculator to find that Vyv's mum is a bartender who turns out to have it on for Mike in a bad way.
Episode 4 - Bomb
The lads wake up to find a bomb in the house. Everyone seems to have their own idea on how to deal with it. Mike decides to contact every ethnic majority in London and try auction it off. Rick decides to hold London at ransom, and gets done up in his activist gear to go send a telegram to Thatcher. Neil builds a bomb shelter under the kitchen table, and all Vyv seems to want to do is blow the thing up. All this, plus a visit from the TV detector man, and they haven't even got a license.
Episode 5 - Interesting
It's the most important party of Rick's life, and the house has been crushed by a giant sandwich.
The boys hold a little get together at their place, which turns out to become pretty hectic. Rick has an embarassing episode with some tampons, Mike scores a princess, Vyv tries to dissect random people, and Neil gets massively stoned and takes a trip to the moon.
Very funny episode.
Episode 6 - Flood
Probably my favourite of all time.
London starts to flood, and Rick starts a game of hide and seek to pass the time. Vyvyan, meanwhile, has made a cure for not being a axe wielding homocidal maniac, and left it inside a Coke can where no-one will dare drink it. Problem is, Jerzei Balowski comes along and devours the lot. What more could you want in Britcom?
Second Series
Bambi - Episode 1
It's washing day. The guys make a long awaited trip to the laundrette, and then Neil remembers that they've been picked to go on the game-show, University Challenge.
Guest stars Emma Thompson, Motorhead, Ben Elton, and Hugh Laurie. Awesome episode.
Episode 2 - Cash
My favourite.
The guys are very low on cash. Vyv starts burning random objects around the house, until Mike decides someone should get a job. Rick has a burst eardrum, Mike has a bad leg... and Vyvyan's pregnant, so looks like Neil has to bite the bullet and become a member of the police force to support Vyv's baby on the way.
Episode 3 - Nasty
Mike borrows a VCR for the night from one of his contacts, and he and Vyv decide to indulge in an all night orgy of sex and violence... video-wise, of course. Naturally, the guys are sent a package from the Transvaal, and a South African vampire seems to stuff their video plans up just a tad. Features The Damned playing live.
Episode 4 - Time
Rick wakes up with a woman in his bed. She turns out to be a homicidal maniac. Enough said.
Episode 5 - Sick
All the boys have come down with the flu. Time for a chill out day. In an effort to stay somewhat clean, they tie snotty Neil up in a garbage bag, until Brian Damage, one of the Balowski boys, decides to hold up the house and ruin their plans. And Neil's just remembered, his parents are coming for tea!
This episode features a really funny parody on The Good Life, although non Brit and Australian viewers probably won't understand it.
Episode 6 - Final - Summer Holiday
Such a tragic end.
The summer holidays are upon the boys. Yay. After a lot of fussing around with boredom and playing Rick's stupid games, his parents die, and they're all thrown out of the house with no money. Best thing to do? Rob a bank and steal a big red bus.
After all that, if you're still comedy starved, I highly suggest trying to get your hands on a copy of Bottom Live, because the first episode featured on this DVD, ""Smells"", isn't nearly as funny as the improvisation that goes on whilst Ade and Rik are onstage.
Happy viewing, ....",1055635200,11,5568,4.369334619093539
1741048,4,B00006AUH9,"The Young Ones epitomised the confusion of the generation that came of age in the Thatcher Years. Caught between a right wing government, the residue of punk and left-wing ideas from the 60s and 70s, and the continued disolution of the class system, British youth went through an identity crisis, struggling to find a suitable sub-group to belong to, whether it be punk (Vyv), spiv (Mike), hippy (Neil), or 'right-on' left-wing radical (Rick). Throwing these 4 student-types together in an anarchic, surreal house-share was a stroke of genius.
The main focus is the explosive relationship of the pretentious Rick (Rik Mayall) and the brutally straightforward Vyvian (Adrian Edmonson). These 2 actors later reprised a stripped down version of this relationship in ""Bottom"". Neal the Hippie and Mike the Spiv provided useful ballast and a wider range of plot options preventing this central comedic relationship from imploding.
People who saw the Young Ones the first time round tend to remember it as much funnier than it really is. With repeated viewing some of the weaknesses in the writing become apparent.

I'm a bit puzzled by the commentator below who states that the series was broadcast on MTV uncut, and is heavily cut on these DVDs.  As I perceive it, just the opposite is true.  I know for a fact that there are lines, snippets, and brief scenes cut from the MTV showings (I still have the tapes I made in the 1980s) that are on these new DVDs, and everything else I remember well from the MTV airings, so I can't imagine what's missing from this set.  The stuff that was missing in the MTV airings was predictably some of the stronger racial humor or raunchier sexual innuendo.  The subliminal frame flashes (mostly from near the end of the second series) seem to me to be the same as in the old MTV showings, as well.  Basic cable, which is what MTV was in the 1980s and is now, was always limited in what it could air, which is usually not the case with videotapes or DVDs.",1035331200,3,1174,4.333333333333333

1741080,5,B00006AUH9,"The answer Rick, should be that we all like you.  You were the moral center, the deepest and most flawed character, and the fever pitch gauge of the program.  Your continued quest for respect, power, and acceptance was a brilliant journey.  Most of this was offset of course, by the fact that you were a complete bastard.
After four plus years since the VHS release, and countless emails to the BBC, the DVD version of the Young Ones has *finally* been released.  Having it on pre-order for months through Amazon[.com], I was excited to see it arrive a few days ago.  Like many others, I first became aware of them during their playback on MTV in the mid/late? 80's.  As hilarious as it was then, it's aged well and plays even better today as a marvelous sitcom and character study.  Continued viewing brings out new subtle and not so subtle nuances each time out.
How would one describe the program to a newbie.  Four students at Scumbag college, living in filth on their scholarship grants, battle daily tedium and their own stereotyped existence.  Simmering beneath this conflict are abstract meetings of inanimate objects, cleaning utensils, neighbors, and random occurrences.  The four students are archetypes for future comedies.
1. The nillilistic punk, Vyvyan.  Played by Ade Edmondson, Vyv, complete with iron stars permanently attached to his forehead exists only to destroy.  Like a vengeful Hindu god, he smites everything in his path, except those he exhibits the barest traces of humanity towards; his hamster SPG, his car, and his begonia.  Introduced to the viewer by crashing through a wall riding a wrecking ball, Vyv is involved in the majority of the physical humor.
2. Neil, the vegetarian hippie.  Always dirty, always downtrodden, and almost always on the toilet, in the kitchen, or in bed, Neil is the shows spiritual den mother.  He is also probably the recipient of most of the pain doled out by Vyv.
3. Mike, the playboy hipster.  Seems a bit old to be in college still, doesn't allow is small stature to get in the way of his grand plans and over exuberant braggadocio.  The only flat mate capable of reigning in Vyv and focusing that power with dictatorial precision.  Mike's role doesn't have much depth as written, and perhaps that's with just cause for a guy who travels with a blow up doll and old tapes of women moaning his name.  Essentially a smooth straight man in the mold of Bud Abbott.
4. Finally, Rick.  The sociology student, people's poet, anarchist, and all around poseur.  Rick never lets an episode go without commenting on some aspect of current life in Thatcher's Britain, how he'd fix it, or, tear it down.  It seems terribly difficult to take his anarchist rantings seriously as he flops about in his yellow dungarees, red shoes, and pig tail sprigs.  Still, I find Rick the most consistently amusing of the lot.  His whip quick mood changes from obsequious currying Mike or Vyv's favor to righteous indignation over Neil's choice of South African lentils is priceless.
Combined, these characters create an incredible dynamic as they interact with each other and their varied guest stars.  Additionally, early 80's musical groups could appear without any form of story set up and play in the bathroom or living room at any given time.  When the boys would go out on the town ala Bambi, appearing on University Challenge, it was especially amusing to see the reaction of people on the street who couldn't make sense of them.
I find some of the references are still obscure to someone not familiar with early 80's English lifestyle, but the DVD contains subtitles which were definitely helpful for allowing one to hear some of the more hushed secondary conversations missed in the first go around.  The third disc contains snippets of comedy documentaries produced since the Young Ones aired, as well as the first episodes of the spiritual successor series to the Young Ones. Filthy Rich & Catflap, and Bottom.  They also included a 'where are they now' section that shows just who all came out of the Young Ones and got their start there.  The number of today's successful actors, and comedians is staggering.  Groundbreaking and incredibly funny, The Young Ones is a classic.  Highly recommended.",1034121600,67,4246,4.871866295264624
1741081,2,B00006AUH9,"if you are a true fan  - you will be very dissapointed that a purportedly ""complete"" set contains edited versions of the shows!! A bummer!

1741082,5,B00006AUH9,"And did we mention the Balovski Family? One of Britains true cult television faves,even in the U.S.! ( MTV actual proved it's worth by running these shows,ages ago.).
There is one small problem,especially if you already bought the BBC Video releases....you already have as ""complete"" a set as BBC Video is going to release apparently.
What's missing? DISC.1/Episode:""Boring"" is missing the intro. music.( ""Good Day Sunshine"" by The Beatles.). DISC.2/Episode: ""Cash"",the musical number,""Subterranean Homesick Blues"" performed by ""Ken Bishop's Nice Twelve"" ( Featuring Jools Holland,and Stewart Copeland among others. ). Apparently musical clearances aren't available from Bob Dylan or The Fab Four?? ( So those home recorded MTV broadcastings,might be worth saving! )
Disc 3 is the bonus material,largely,exerpts from BBC shows about the history of televised comedy. You see a little bit of Nigel & Rick circa 2002 in interviews.( Plus Alexei Sayle,Lisa Mayer,and Ben Elton. ). A live poem reading by Rick when he was in ""20Th Century Coyote"". And...the first episodes of ""Bottom"" ( with Rick & Ade ),and ""Filthy,Rich,& Catflap"" ( Nigel,Rick & Ade ),which are amusing,but not half as much as The Young Ones.
Frankly,its Disc 3 that you'll be paying for,since Disc 1 & 2,any self respecting Cliff Richard fan already owns. (Oh,and the 4 postcards,as well. )
Free advice for you my little Thunderbird puppets!",1033862400,19,1406,5.337837837837838

1741084,4,B00006AUH9,"It all started in 1979, when comedy in the UK consisted mainly of old geezers still making the same inane jokes about their mother in laws. Punk was over, but it was about to find a new home in the hands of a few loud and brilliant young stand ups. The great Comedy War of '79 had begun, and their leader was Peter Richardson, who a year later founded The Comic Strip, the core of this new wave of comedy called ""alternative"". The Comic Strip consisted of Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmonson as a comedy duo called 20th Century Coyote, Nigel Planer and Peter Richardson as The Outer Limits, Alexei Sayle, Keith Allen, Robbie Coltrane and AbFab's Jennifer Saunders & Dawn French. They were changing the face of comedy and were about to become famous. They attracted crowds, soon everybody was talking about them; famous heads started popping up at their shows each week. One of them was Paul Jackson of the BBC. When Rik Mayall and his girlfriend came up with an idea for a tv show called the Young Ones (loosely based on Mayall's real flat sharing life) in 1982, they were immediately given the go ahead, under the BBC's condition that they include musical acts so as to categorise it as an entertainment show and not a sitcom, which would have been more expensive to make. Peter Richardson was sacked from the production by Jackson after a personality clash and Christopher Ryan, a stage actor, was brought in to play Mike TheCoolPerson. Richardson remained a key element in The Comic Strip series, which produced nearly 30 episodes in 20 years, notably the cult and brilliant Bad News, a precursor to Spinal Tap (and not the opposite, as it is sometimes falsely stated). The Young Ones changed the way television was done, The Comic Strip changed the way comedy was done. Get this DVD.",1032998400,,1782,4.6424050632911396
1741085,5,B00006AUH9,"What a great comprehensive DVD set this is.
Being a huge fan of this cult comedy I was never expecting a Box Set of DVDs but not only do we get every episode but some special features!
The 3rd disc contains a couple of interesting although short documentaries, plus episodes of other shows the guys made after The Young Ones, to be honest though they don't touch the original show.
If you love British comedy then this is for you.",1032566400,2,430,4.3875
1741086,4,B00006AUH9,"You've already got episode synopsis and whatnot from other reviews, so I'll skip that.  This set is definately the bomb.  However, with the exception of adding the Dexy's Midnight Runner's back into the episode entitled BOMB, there is no difference from this and the VHS versions, as some episodes are missing sections.  Some are small(one or two lines in NASTY and OIL) and others are whole scenes (The musical number in CASH).  However, as said before it's the frigging Young Ones on DVD!  get the frickin DVD already!
Naturally, the third disc is the main reason for the boxset, as the episode of Filthy, Rich, and Catflap and the episode of Bottom possibly means that BBC Video is thinking of releasing them to the states, which is perfectly fine with me!  The episodes are Filthy, Rich, and Catflap episode 1 where Richie has been hit with a paternity suit, and the Bottom episode is entitled SMELLS, where Eddie and Richie get pherome spray to help them ""catch the birds"".",1032480000,11,978,4.757396449704142
1741087,5,B00006AUH9,"The YOUNG ONES ran from 1982 to 1984 and consists of the 12 episodes included here. The show stars Rik Mayall, Adrian Edmondson, Nigel Planer, and Christopher Ryan as Rick, Vyvyan, Neil, and Mike respectively. Alexei Sayle also stars as several members of the Balowski family (one of them being the landlord of their house). The show was brilliantly written by Rik Mayall, Lise Mayer, Alexei Sayle, and last but not least, Ben Elton (co- writer of Black Adder and writer of The Thin Blue Line and Filthy Rich & Catflap). To begin to describe the wackiness, spontaneous combustion, and pure originality of this show is not something I'll do here. You know or you don't, but if you don't and like any other BBC comedies such as Black Adder, Fawlty Towers, Monty Python, Father Ted or Absolutely Fabulous, then you will love the Young Ones!
The DVD set is another impressive product from BBC video. The packaging is like the Fawlty Towers or All in the Family tri-fold case. The first series of 6 episodes (Demolition, Oil, Boring, Bomb, Interesting, & FLood) are included on disc 1 (the disc with Vyvyan's attractive face on it), the next series of 6 (Bambi, Cash, Nasty, Sick, Time, & Summer Holiday) are on disc 2 (the one with Neil the Hippie on it), and disc 3 (with el presidente Mike on it) is all extra features including 2 featurettes (with cast and writer interviews), Extensive talent files of all cast, writers, guest stars, and bands that appeared on the show, and best of all the first episode of BOTTOM and the first episode of FILTHY, RICH and CATFLAP. For those who don't know, BOTTOM is a show that ran from 1991 to 1995 and had 18 episodes. It starred Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson (both also wrote) as single and repulsive roommates, Rich Richard and Eddie Hitler, who spend half their time trying to get women and the other half beating each other senseless. Christopher Ryan would later appear on the show as well.  The episode included on this disc is the first episode, ""SMELLS"" and it's hilarious. FILTHY, R & C is a show that ran in 1987 and only had 6 episodes. It also stars Rik and Adrian, but also Nigel Planer as Richard Rich, Ed Catflap, & Ralph Filthy respectively. The show, written by Ben Elton, is about an obnoxious celebrity and two guys that work for him. The episode here is the first episode, ""Dead Milkmen"". I hope BBC considers bringing out both shows on DVD as they would be nice companions to the Young Ones set. By the way, if you feel bad because Rik isn't on one of the discs, don't, because you'll see his lovely smile on the inside flap everytime you open the case (I've seen it many many times already) Anyway THE YOUNG ONES: Every Stoopid Episode has all 12 uncut episodes (not the MTV versions) with the full beginning song and original end credits (that weren't even available on VHS). All the musical moments from Motorhead to Madness are here as well. Did I mention there are 4 colorful postcards included (one for each YOUNG ONE!) I love this show! ""Once in every lifetime, comes a love like this...""
*Trivia: Adrian Edmondson who plays Vyvyan Basterd the orange haired punk with four stars embedded in his forehead is married to Jennifer Saunders (Edina of Ab Fab) and they have 3 children together in real life!  She also makes guest appearances in ""Interesting"" & ""Time"" on the Young Ones.  Adrian also co-sings the Ab Fab theme song and appeared as Hamish in two episodes!
*Trivia: Christopher Ryan who plays Mike thecoolperson can also be seen playing one of Jennifer Saunders' ex-husbands, Marshall, on Ab Fab!
*Trivia: Three of the Young Ones: Rick, Neil, & Vyv, all have mad guest appearances in the Black Adder series.  Rik Mayall is the only one to become a recurring character: Lord Flashheart (""Woof, Woof"").  Additionally, Black Adder regulars: Tony Robinson (Baldrick), Hugh Laurie (Prince George), Stephen Fry (Melchett), and Robbie Coltrane (Dr. Johnson, Spirit of Christmas) can all be seen in the Young Ones episode ""Bambi"".  Motorhead is also in this episode doing ""Ace of Spades""!",1032393600,210,4056,4.7136812411847675
