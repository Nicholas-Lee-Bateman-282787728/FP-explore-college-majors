8264917,5,B00175GAG0,"The continuing saga of Ito Ogami... -aka- ""Lone Wolf""
Some scenes are a little farfetched... o.k... alot farfetched, like Digaro's baby cart that shoots more high explosive rockets than a 4th of July celebration.  But hey,  the slay and spray scenes and the slice and dice extermination of the Shogun's forces by this katana wielding Mad Max are worth the buy...  especially if you are into this cult series... like I am.",1409270400,3,421,4.819444444444445
8264918,4,B00175GAG0,"The last film in the Shogun Assassin series, COLD ROAD TO HELL finds hero Ogami Itto confronting his enemy Retsudo (and thousands of furious members of the Yagyu Clan) one final time.",1384905600,,183,4.75
8264919,5,B00175GAG0,"Although Akihiro Tomikawa is good as Itto Ogami, I believe Kinnosuke Nakamura would have been better.  Either way the Lone Wolf and Cub movies are as great as the TV series.",1362268800,,173,4.580645161290323
8264920,4,B00175GAG0,I have all 5 of the Shogun Assassins movies and they are a must have collection if oyu like samurai swordmanship and bloody action and the misadventures of a father and son with a well armed baby carraiage then you will love these DVDs. You have to be a fan of the martial arts in order to really appreeciate the these films and they have there funny momments in the midst of some very fast paced action. The first release was origanlly called Lightening Swords of Death which was a  box office smash hit way back when.,1332460800,,519,4.350515463917525
8264921,5,B00175GAG0,"What can a person say about the movies this man and child makes. The movies are just great awsome each one leaves you looking for more and each one delivers and gives you what you want. You must buy this movie and the others if you do not already have them. Lots of action and blood the fights scens are outstanding love the fast sword play.

Buy The Movie,",1285804800,,357,4.173913043478261
