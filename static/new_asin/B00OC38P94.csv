8683131,5,B00OC38P94,"The McDonnell Douglas MD-95 was the last variant of the highly successful DC-9/MD-80-88-90 aircraft. When the Boeing Company took over McDonnell Douglas in August 1997, this aircraft, it's design already completed and in production, was re-designated the Boeing 717. The first deliveries occurred in 1999 and the aircraft was in production until 2006. A total of 156 airplanes were manufactured. As a smaller version of the MD-90 with maximum seating for 158 passengers, the MD-95 had been designed for a maximum capacity of 134. It was intended to appeal to those carriers seeking a short haul high frequency aircraft in the approximately 100 seat category, a low cost 100-seater for the burgeoning regional jet market. In October 1995 Value Jet, later becoming AirTran was the first customer announcing a purchase order of 50 aircraft with 50 options. Value Jet/AirTran ultimately acquired 88 of these aircraft. Southwest Airlines announced it's acquisition of AirTran on 9/27/2010 for $1.7 Billion. SW did not want these MD95/Boeing 717 aircraft. Delta Airlines, with a huge fleet of DC-9/MD-80-88 models arranged a lease of all 88 with purchase as the ultimate goal. Today Volotea is one of only four or five airlines continuing to operate this aircraft and it is highly appropriate for their business model. This Just Planes video is one of the very few that features this aircraft and it's operations are interesting indeed. With a hub in Venice, a half dozen of Volotea's destinations in Italy from Venice are featured, some with special operational characteristics, such as Genoa and Pantelleria. The cockpit explanations are presented well, detailed and informative. Sadly current news reports are that, in spite of Volotea's overall satisfaction with this aircraft, it will be phased out in favor of current Airbus models that are somewhat larger and offer more ongoing comprehensive maintenance support as they are still in production. One can speculate whether Delta might seek to acquire some of these available B717 aircraft.",1455408000,,2039,5.296296296296297
