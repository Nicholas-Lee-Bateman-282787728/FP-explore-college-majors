8574471,2,B0014Z4OHU,"I was a little disappointed in the Discover Dance Combinations series. You can select to view the men's part or the lady's part or as it is danced as a pair. This complicates the menu system a little for the older generations or those not familiar with complex DVD menu's.

The instructional angle means that you must look at the TV over your shoulder and sometimes review the figure (move) a couple of times just to find out how it is performed. The voice over is dull and makes learning this dance from this DVD painful and without the enthusiasm that is needed to enjoy dancing.

Rather look at the Librero's ""How to become a good dancer"" series.",1272844800,,649,4.491525423728813
