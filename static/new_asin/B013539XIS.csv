7360289,5,B013539XIS,"I just received this box set in the mail today. The first thing I noticed as I was un-boxing this item is how well packaging of this box set is. It comes with a hard outer shell and a book style packaging inside with many pictures and stories about the show. Also a nice metal flask is included in the back of the box, and the box is designed so that you can see and display.

I just finished watching the first episode, and the show was also very good. I can't wait to dig in deeper. Picture quality of the Blu-Ray is also Crystal Clear. The acting was phenomenal and the cinematography and music was top notch. I would definitely recommend this set to anyone interested in seeing Justified or was a fan of the original broadcasts.",1447027200,,732,4.304347826086956

7360292,5,B013539XIS,"In response to an earlier review about the Blu-ray discs themselves, I have found no scratches on my set. I have played 4 of the 19 discs and find no issues with quality of playback.
The extra 19th disc has some wonderful footage, outtakes and end of series features. Lots of fun to watch. Various actors reading from about 8 Elmore Leonard stories is also an unexpected bonus.
This is a very nice packaged set with lots of extras that series' fans will appreciate. It makes me wish for more Justified, but I agree that they ended it well. The best final episode I can think of.
Highly recommend to fans of Elmore Leonard, Timothy Olyphant, Walton Goggins, Joelle Carter, Graham Yost, and all the writers and directors that were a part of this series.",1444694400,74,751,4.57037037037037

7360294,2,B013539XIS,"Having gotten a look at one of these, I am sorry to report that about a third of the discs had tiny scratches from a flawed packaging design. A friend showed me an advance and basically, as it stands now, with production underway, the packaging on the complete series set is the flawed cardboard sleeve/book system that we've seen in other sets, the Spartacus seasons and the Alien Anthology spring to mind, which leave your discs prone to scratching against the inside of the cardboard sleeves, not only with repeated viewings (pulling them out and putting them back in) but from the initial packing at the factory.

Complete sets like the True Blood UK edition (and pretty much every other UK release of US sets) where you have single seasons in the solid blue plastic Amaray cases all set inside a lovely outer box packaging are superior in virtually every sense, as we all know, but, for an undisclosed reason the studio opted for the cardboard sleeve system on this one. Even the US Chuck Complete Series set has better packaging that is safer for the discs and offers greater environmental protection (from humidity and the like) and it was a bare bones, basically sticking a cardboard shell around the original season sets, release.

Where the booklet here could have been a separate book set inside a cardboard box alongside Amaray (classic Blu-ray) cases which would do a much better job of protecting the discs, it is included with the sleeves, all part of one book, probably as an ill-conceived nod to the fact that the show began as a set of stories, though the earliest were not originally published in hardback so I'm not sure why, in that case, they didn't just go completely insane and, for accuracy, release this as more of a paper back or magazine/paper sleeve set. The studio may come out and say it was so that it would cost less but, as you can see by the price, by producing a much cheaper set, they have only increased their profit margin and that savings is not being passed down to us consumers.

That last little rant aside, if you have a child free home and will only view this set once, this may work for you. However, if you are concerned with durability, the single sets are superior to this.

For the record, the image quality/transfers used of the episodes themselves are the originals from the single season sets so the video will be identical. The only difference is the single bonus disc of new special features.

That  having been said, as this does contain a single additional bonus disc for us fans, you may have no choice but to purchase this and suffer through the scratching of the discs in order to have that one disc in your collection, which is unfortunate, but, for whatever it is worth, I would wait and see about Region Free international editions that would have the same disc but better packaging, given how very expensive complete series sets can be. So far, Canada's release is the same so don't bother with that and Australia's details have not been released. No UK edition has been announced and, up to now, UK vendors have sold the Australian edition of each separate season, as no UK releases were produced, so I will update here when the packaging details on the Australian edition are released.

I'm hoping they'll redesign this set for future production and still include that bonus disc but I'm sorry to say that is unlikely. So, unless you have to have that disc, because of the disc damaging packaging, I advise purchasing the series as single season sets.

To be clear, this is not a review of the series. You have other people to go to for that. This is a warning about the packaging of this Blu-ray set and an advisory that you have a pro and con situation here. Single sets costs you the bonus disc. This set will be something you have to be very careful with and the scratching issue, which is why he showed me this to begin with, is evident after only a couple of gentle removals of each disc. Getting a set with no scratched discs will be next to impossible on this one so if you must have pristine discs (which he must, where I'm more forgiving) then this set will drive you nuts.

The two stars, rather than one, are earned by including a new disc of extra features. Had they packaged this correctly, as a set that you could rely on to last through your viewings and those of your family, this could have been a five star set and, given the beautiful 1080p transfers on the single sets, it would have been. Good luck making a difficult decision and, again, I'm sorry.",1441497600,49,4537,4.557055214723927
7360295,5,B013539XIS,"Justified is an absolutely brilliant television series that focuses on the interweaving lifestyles of law enforcement professionals, criminal enterprises and contemporary heartland America's socioeconomic issues. Characters often reap what they sow and the issue of whether they receive their just desert is a recurring theme throughout the series. Familial strife and community life are also consistent driving forces where plot development is concerned.

The blu-rays will present some of the finest writing, acting and directing that has been seen on American television in recent years. But perhaps the most brilliant stroke of the producers is to end the series after six seasons. In essence, they have wisley quit while they are ahead. The sheer energy, power and drive of Justified's character development, plot twists and climaxes often paralleled big screen action entertainment. The ability of the creative team to turn out as many high quality episodes as they did was quite surprising. One often wondered how how much longer they could keep that pace up before the law of diminishing returns set in. In bringing the series to conclusion after six years, they have made a decision that will set the show up to, in time, become a classic, legendary long form contemporary western that will thrill generations of viewers for years to come.

Best wishes to all cast and crew associated with this show. May it live on forever. What ever success and accolades it has achieved are most Justified.",1440115200,8,1501,5.224066390041494

I could have wished for a box to hold the cases, but I put them on a shelf, so OK.  No damage or bad cases.  Color and sound were great.  I bought the $80+ set as a review of the cheaper set had some problems discovered by other users.  Well worth the money.  I will read reviews always before buying.

All seasons are there but they are stacked on top of each in the plastic case, much like you would buy a case of blank CDs.  But instead of hard plastic it's more like flimsy plastic that bends at the slightest touch.  Then this package is glued to the inside case which didn't hold.  When I opened it the ""holding stacker"" had come apart from it's backing.  Secondly, the back sheet about the DVD features is glued one.  Minor issue but definitely shows corners cut.  Did I get what I asked for?  Yes, but if I had known it was going to come like this I may have sprung for the more expensive package.",1523145600,,775,4.140939597315437

The packaging however does leave a bit to be desired as all 10 DVD are simply stacked in a single container which means all need to be shuffled to find the episode you may be looking for.

Got a kick out of seeing James LeGros as a character since he was the original version of Raylan in the Dennis Hopper flick Pronto, the first appearance of Raylan.

7360412,1,B013539XIS,"One star for the greed-addled, money-grubbing, cynical corporate ciphers who ordered the cheapest, flimsiest, least user-friendly, ""most likely to damage the content dvd's under normal wear and tear"" packaging known to the human race. Removing the slipcased box from the packaging, the cheap-crap plastic insert containing the cd's detaches itself from the cheap-crap cardboard binder and drops the loose DVD's into my lap. Ah--I spy a thin schmeer  of no-longer-adhesive adhesive that (if it had been designed by a reputable firm that gave a damn) should have held the cheap-crap plastic housing in place. Mind you the dvd's could still spill out in your lap, since they're held in place by a cheap corrugated cardboard widget....oh, I could go on, but why bother. OH! and there's a 2-sided label on the back of the cheap-crap slipcase--one side listing DVD features, the other listing contents of each CD. THAT 'S the side that's securely glued to the cheap-crap slipcase so you can't read it. GENIUS, I tell ya!! I fervently wish I could wave a magic wand and consign the corporate cretin who green-lighted this packaging to life in a world where everything he/she touches, wears, or depends on, is this shoddy, badly designed, and insulting to the end buyer because it's so substandard compared to the retail price ($68 at the time of my purchase).  FIVE STARS FOR EVERYTHING ELSE! Really, if you want the series beginning to end (and who wouldn't) you're just going to have to figure out a way to package the set once the original cheap-crap packaging falls apart. (It's still worth it, in my opinion, or I wouldn't have bought it.) I wonder if my local library has any damaged DVD cases they're throwing out. Even damaged, they're better than this shoddy mess.",1496102400,24,1766,4.922818791946309

The cast,  dialogue, humor and acting is absolutely superb.  I love a guy who can pull the trigger and Raylan can.  If you don't heed his warning you die by his shooting skill.

7360482,5,B013539XIS,"well, i like the series quite a bit and the quality overall is great so why the rating, it might just be my copy which is being returned as we speak but season 3 episode 6, the audio is out of sync of the video but it is back to normal on 7.  it is very irriating.  hopefully it is only my copy.  other than that this is a great series.

i will update once i get my new copy if that is out of sync too.

In the hands of a creative director and writer, this could have been a real piece of Americana. Instead, the story devolves into a series of trite, set-piece episodes that connect to each other in forced, heavy-handed ways. I thought this was a cable series but it plays much more like a TV program.

7360508,1,B013539XIS,"Actually, the product itself (BluRay version) deserves 5 stars plus many more.  It is easily the best ""Binge"" watching series we've ever seen, bar none.  Great packaging and extras included make it even better.  We absolutely LOVE the series and highly recommend this Bluray version.

The reason for only one star was the ""Gift"" wrapping provided by Amazon for an extra charge of $3.49 which was essentially an insult to the recipient.  An extremely cheap and thin faux canvas bag with a drawstring style ""ribbon"" tied poorly at the top was the ""gift"" wrap.  I estimate the profit to Amazon on this unbelievably cheap and cheesy ""wrapping"" was $3.47 because if Amazon paid more than 1 cent for the bag and 1 cent for the labor to ""wrap"" the product they got hosed as did the customer who purchased it, me.  Even the ""gift card"" tied to the bag was terrible and cheap.  Glued crooked on the tag with barely legible tiny font greeting printed poorly inside.  At least they got the Amazon ""swoosh"" logo printed ok on the front of the card.  I suppose that's so the gift recipient will be able to tell her friends what Amazon's gift wrapping is all about.  This is the first poor review I've ever written about Amazon even though each time I've paid for ""gift"" wrapping it has been ridiculous.  I have Amazon gifted for Christmas in the past and the gift wrapping rivaled this one being reviewed in terms of cheap and insulting.  Never again for Amazon's gift wrap.  They shouldn't even offer it unless they post a disclaimer for the poorest quality on the materials and service.  ;-(  .  .",1474502400,,1586,4.607142857142857

Unfortunately, because it is a Sony Pictures Blu Ray, there are, (as is typical of Sony), no Spanish subtitles. While I am a born and raised English speaking Anglo, many of my film and video aficionado friends are not, and even with English as a second language when watching a film with a lot of regional dialect or slang, having subtitles available in that language makes it much better. Given the high percentage of native Spanish speakers in North America, (region1 for dvd coding), you'd think Sony would've stepped up and included Spanish subtitles on Blu Ray releases for this region routinely by now. That they have not seems a bit troubling. For this reason I tend to avoid purchasing Sony videos as, regretfully, I will do here with the blu ray edition. I may wind up buying the dvd version which has many different subtitle languages available, but I'll wait awhile.",1471737600,,1011,4.685393258426966

7360660,5,B013539XIS,"ELMORE LEONARD  TIMOTHY OLYPHANT  JUSTIFED  2010-2014
THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON  2010

The first season of a series always gives the recipe and you have to taste it. If the recipe is good, you will like the sample you taste and you will get attached, addicted or just mesmerized and faithful. Otherwise you will have to drag your feet through all the seasons you bought on a special deal.

The character Deputy US Marshal Raylan Givens is the centerpiece of the series and he better be original and true to life. The actor is essential and he is good, even good looking. He is a cop who shoots always first but never before the other gets or tries to get his artillery out. It always ends badly, for the other of course. This starts with Raylan killing a Very Important Person from the drug business in Miami, Florida. We all know V,I and P are the first three letters of VIPer and that this snake is particularly poisonous, though less efficient than a rattlesnake. But thats only the starting block of the series. Raylan is railroaded back to Kentucky where he was coming from, back to the very city where he grew up and the very city he had thought he had left forever, and ever, till his justified killing of a drug VIP brought him back.

Then the character and the series is a mixture of features that make it unique. First the accent is southern and it takes some time for those who are not used to it to either get it or go back to it if they have had some experience in that field. The second element is that he is a Clint Eastwood of the new age. He has a cell phone and he is clean and he wears a two or five gallon hat as a distinctive trait. Dirty Harry was slightly dirty at times. But as a high plains drifter he is quite trendy in this world of the Internet of Things.

Then Raylan has a personal dimension with a father, a stepmother though no mother, nor siblings. He has his high school girl friend he did not marry and the woman he married and then divorced, and her subsequent second husband. He has all his old friends with whom he did all kinds of antics, some definitely not entirely legal. His best friend, if he is a best, is one of the sons of the local drug king who is just out of prison. Raylans father was the agent of that chap during his barred vacation, but he did not do good. So he has problems. The high school girl friend and paramour married one of the sons of the local drug lord. She finally killed him in strange conditions. The drug lord wants to get rid of his other son who was sent to prison by Raylan but managed to get out rather fast because of various circumstances, but he comes out a Christian reborn in Jesus. Halleluiah!

Raylans whole problem is that he has to get rid of the drug circle and at the same time spare his best friend turned reborn Christian. The rest is detail and funny, well written and inventive.

This season ends up on a cliffhanger. They are all dead except Raylan, his best friend whose father was killed by the only survivor of the Miami drug club. The best friend, who is called Boyd actually, goes after the running girl and we understand Raylan goes after them. What happens next is for next season, precisely. There is no real deep thinking or philosophy in this series. It is more so far what I would call southern folklore and standard US Marshal cop-lore in the boonies.

I should have spoiled nothing because what I have said is the normal pattern that we know from the very start. The pleasure is in the detail, the small elements, people, epiphenomena, and that or those you will have to discover yourself in five hundred and fifty two minutes of running time and the thirteen episodes. Good luck.

ELMORE LEONARD  TIMOTHY OLYPHANT  JUSTIFED  2010-2014
THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON  2010

This second season does not bring the big surprise we could have expected. The Bennett family who have been controlling Harlan County for two or three generations, this Bennett family being in the hands of the mother, with no father available, but with three sons the mother uses as her direct servants and hit men, lets say slaves in crime because that is what it is, this family has to come to an end one day and generally it happens with a lot of pain and suffering.

Why does it have to come to an end?

Because the power of this family is based on crime: illegal cultivation of marihuana at a very high level, grand style and all, for tremendous amounts of money. Because the power of this family is reinforced by one son who is the local sheriff and has turned the local police force into a gang to enforce and reinforce the power of and the decisions of the mother. Because the other two sons are plain criminals and nothing else, killing for fun and torturing for kicks. Because some company from outside decides that the tremendous amount of coal that is hidden in these Kentucky mountains has to be taken out and the Bennett family is an obstacle to this industrial venture and has to be either bought, or even bribed, or eliminated. Since the sons are die-hard criminal minds there is no other way but to eliminate them, and get rid of the mother.

The agents of that cleansing mission will be the Deputy US Marshall Raylan Givens from the Givens family, a rival family to the Bennetts, and the Crowders, another rival family to the Bennetts. Raylan is the only one who is on the side of more or less legal means, the use of force if it is justified. The other members of these two families are on the side of justice for themselves, vengeance for their dead, revenge for their businesses and lives. So they want the Bennett empire to be split up into pieces and the viable pieces to be entrusted, or recuperated, by them.

So the brothers have to go one after another. One is shot dead by a girl he tried to molest and whose father he had killed, the second ends up in prison, the third, the local sheriff, ends up badly too and the mother has her own fate on her own hands. The chief of a tribe, or a clan, of a gang deserves some modest reward in their ends, in this case her end, face to face with Raylan.

The details youll have to get from the 13 episodes, but we knew from the very beginning that this second season was the end of the monstrous criminal corrupt dictatorship or a dumb mother and her three slaves of sorts, and sons by name.

There are tricky moments to eliminate secondary corrupt dummies, and some sensitive moments about the girl whose father was assassinated by the Bennetts. There are also some surprising moments concerning the two female characters, Raylans ex-wife who became his new girl friend, and his high school lover of sorts who is connected to one of the last surviving Crowders. Not to speak of Raylans step mother he calls his aunt. A very strong woman but to be strong is nearly a disadvantage when confronted to unethical criminals.

But I am sure you will enjoy the suspense. At the end, which could have been the end of the series, Raylan has applied for some promotion out of Kentucky or the Marshall service, he has just learned some good news about his ex-wife and we do not know what will happen. Thats not a cliff hanger but that will be a new start next season.

ELMORE LEONARD  TIMOTHY OLYPHANT  JUSTIFED  2010-2014
THE COMPLETE THIRD SEASON  2011

This third season is crucial now the main gang has lost their head, their chief. The only actors are the black gang and Crowders gang that has recuperated Arlo Givens, Raylans father. The new element that is going to animate the whole season is the arrival of the son of a Detroit gangster, rejected by his own father and who is playing the carpetbagger of the 21st century in Kentucky. That means this season is going to be business as usual in an unusual circumstantial situation with the invasive action of an invader from the North who does not seem to know how things are going down South.

Locally we only have one element that has some deeper meaning: the sheriff of the main county of the action has to face re-election. Boyd Crowder and his gang decide to play their pack of cards to get their own man elected. The Detroit invader tries to pay the incumbent sheriff to keep him in office. In fact the election is very tricky and the result is astounding. We must always consider being a newcomer in an elective job is necessarily a handicap but American elections are full of surprises. Remember the 2000 presidential election won by decision of the Supreme Court who stopped the recounting of several millions of votes that were not exactly correct. No allusion of course to rigged elections of any sort that are not possible in the USA: thats typical of third world countries or Asia or Europe, hence of everywhere except the USA.

The second question is the place of a black gang among several white gangs in the South. Segregation is still real and effective though now some members of the black gang are not that clean or faithful as for their own gang and they may give some information to the other side, turning a tricky situation into a very messy situation.

Whats left then if the social and cultural issues are rather light?

Some good intentions that are both illegal and ethical but they create more problems than the conflicts they may solve. The objective is not to shoot all gangsters down, but to put them in prison, at least for a while, and if they have to be shot, they must not be shot dead. Thats the real problem for Raylan Givens, but he seems to be becoming civilized.

The season then ends on a good fine rich situation since most gangsters are eliminated, except one, the black piggy bank is broken and the content is brought to light from the depth of the stomach of this piggy bank and Raylan visits his ex-wife who is presently pregnant with his own child to make sure she is OK at her sisters where she found refuge from the saucy bullet-ridden situation at home, if a police corps is a home of any kind.

So we end without a cliff hanger really but with a nearly cleaned up plate. So how are they going to renew the situation to have new adventures in this southern jungle to put on the platter of next season?

ELMORE LEONARD  TIMOTHY OLYPHANT  JUSTIFED  2010-2014
THE COMPLETE FOURTH SEASON  2012

This Season is tricky since so many of the old traditional outlaws in Harlan County have already been dealt with, I mean flipped over like flip cards and ended up right on their heads, brains and skulls spilled over the sidewalk. We knew there was a connection with Detroit in the drug business or heroin distribution and that there were only two local actors left. But Detroit was furious because the network was being both strangled and drained. So they had to do something about it. First to obtain the merger of the two opposed actors and then to protect the network against Deputy US Marshall Raylan Givens who is definitely not a gift, a present, a blessed contribution to the wealth of business, meaning outlawed business of course.

The Detroit people tried to take over and they sent some cleaning teams but unluckily they failed. Thats when we start understanding the real stake and it is Drew, that dead heroin higher-up gangster or dealer who actually faked his death in Harlan County and disappeared leaving a body behind him and some unluckily identity that was taken care of by Arlo Givens. The two million dollars of heroin went into the local business, made the county rich and the very few people who knew who Drew was kept their mouths shut and just became well-off and even rich. But Arlo Givens cheated, of course and naturally, and he kept the bag and the Drew drivers license ID hidden in a wall of his house. For some absurd reason a couple of young people were sent to recuperate the bag but it ended up in the hands of the US Marshalls. Too bad! Arlo was supposed to have burnt it. And his cheating will not benefit him in the ends since his end is going to be miserable and unhappy. Thats what happens when you play poker  so to say  with bad boys.

And thats the story of the season.
1- to find out who Drew is in the county, under which identity he is hiding;
2- to get him in the hands of justice so that he could get a deal with the local public attorney or prosecutor in exchange of his telling who is who in the vast US network of heroin, or at least the branch growing out of Detroit;
3- to save a poor young nave but not innocent prostitute who was the witness of some crime by one of the surviving Crowders, and at the same time to bring her into safety in the hands of the US Marshalls so that she could bring the last Crowders down, or at least one of them, the others being either eliminated or under some suspended fateful ending:
4- to protect Raylans ex-wife who is going to give birth to his child, knowing that in the hands of the Detroit criminals she is a very good hostage, hence very valuable and thus has a high level of added value;
5- to enable the child to be born safe and secure;
6- to get Raylan suspended for thirty days, a suspension for sure, but a golden suspension indeed that is in fact a forced vacation;
7- finally to manage to get the bad guy from Detroit that menaced Raylans wife killed in a way or another, though not by Raylan and not with Raylans gun.

You can trust Raylan to be able to get everything through with the most numerous surprises possible. That leads us to an end without any real cliffhanger. A baby is going to be born during recess. The merger will be solved among the two gangsters. The poor Boyd Crowder will get some respite and maybe even a promotion and his future wife will be taken in custody. The Black gang, on the other side of the racial divide, will manage to get out sprinkle white though not clean. Drew will be in custody and the young nave etc. prostitute will be safe since her ex-madam is in custody too. And Raylan is on vacation. Happy fishing and lucky idleness, Sir, Mister Master Sir, do not forget we are in the South!

THE COMPLETE FIFTH SEASON  2013

This fifth season is tricky since all the local Harlan County families are dying like hell, so some props have to be brought into the Kentucky landscape. The first one is a whole family from Florida, the Crows, like the birds that are both parasites and scavengers, and they take over the Crowders with all kinds of conflicts going along with this coup dtat if not putsch. The second one through the friends in Detroit comes from Mexico with heroin. And that is the heart of the season with Raylan Givens more and more sidetracked by his chief Art to the point of this chief making a mistake in procedure and getting severely wounded. The worst part of the situation is that a ten year old boy is mixed up in this Crow family, and like with birds crows do not like smaller birds like sparrows and robins. So the boy has a lot of problems with his mother, when she is revealed to be his mother, and with his uncles when they are revealed to be his uncles.

The violence in this season is extremely serious but always the mark of some kind of paranoid or hysterical or even psychotic derangement of the various criminals who are like a bunch of spiders locked up in a glass pot. They are ready to eat one another if they cannot get even with the cops and kill them before getting back to eating one another alive if possible. They try the latter but they are so corrugated that they cannot shoot a weapon straight.

This criminal milieu reveals that family links, in other words blood relations, are an absolute dictatorship, a bond that cannot be cut loose or untied, a connection that is more than a rope, a real cable, and not made of some vegetal fiber but made with stainless steel. Blood means slavery. And on the other side within this blood entourage the stronger individuals consider they have all rights to do what they want and to be followed, obeyed by all other members. It is very bad luck to be a child in such an environment because then you are a pack mule at best and a body shield at worst. You can imagine if being a boy is not easy in that criminal family, what it would be to be a girl.

There is there a real lesson about human society. The lower you go into crime and hooliganism, the more disorganized and disjointed human relations become, in fact there is nothing human left, just the animal instinct not to survive but to kill. These people are not even animals who kill to feed or to defend themselves, but beasts who kill for the pleasure of killing and who torture as long as possible before killing to inflict pain, suffering and humiliation. Strangely enough these men only consider a menace to their manhood as having the chance of getting some kind of influence on their behavior, otherwise dying for them is nothing at all, whereas losing their masculinity is unbearable. You should see them then crawling and begging. They have no decency, no honor, no dignity.

Thats the main dimension of this series: it does not use any subtle intrigue or plot on the criminal side. It is only sheer force and mere violence.

On the cop side you have the ruffians, like Raylan, who manipulates the criminals into killing one another, maiming each other, mutilating themselves even, lets say by accident, but these cops are always getting what they want: the death and elimination of the criminals if possible without going to a court of justice and saving on judicial costs. The second type is those who try to proceed by the rules and by the book, Miranda and all. They know X or Y is going to commit a crime but there is no need for them to make it come faster and thus blocking them, nor to do anything else but wait for the crime to have been committed. The last type, generally the bosses, is so frigid in front of these criminals that they prefer not seeing the crime that is coming rather than sending cops who might be a little bit rough.

So we are justified in thinking that such police forces are in fact by far ineffective, impotent in front of real crime, and this frustration largely explains that then some may become criminal in their turn by taking some ethnic categories of people, young, male and colored, meaning black or very dark, as prime targets for their harassment that can lead to some innocent casualties among these populations. That consequence of bad police work in the USA is not really hinted at in this series, but we know better.

ELMORE LEONARD  TIMOTHY OLYPHANT  JUSTIFED  2010- 2014
THE COMPLETE SIXTH SEASON  2014

The final season of a series like this one is very complicated. It has to take all, or at least the most dangerous criminals down, in prison, in the earth or whatever other way they can imagine. So you have to understand that there is no spoiling in telling you that all except two end up dead or in prison, only two actually in that last category. And two on the loose, on the run, vanished in thin air. No spoiling in telling you Raylen Givens ends up in Miami, Florida, as had been announced for a while. He is a good daddy to his daughter, a visiting or visited daddy more than a real in-house one. His ex wife and mother of his daughter is of course with a second  second-choice husband, nothing to brag about. Not handsome but probably not crooked either, and yet the muscle man type, rough on the outline and hairy all over, working class and physical. A real man in one word even if he won't win any Mister Universe competition.

The only thing I will not tell you is about Raylans hat, his famous twenty-gallon Stetson hat. Apparently he has to bury it in the last episode or so. Bury it in some deeply spiritual way that sounded like some crucial scene in some A-cowboy-movie like Pale Rider or some other B-cowboy-movie with John Wayne like never mind the title they are all the same.

But it is time to summarize this series. As I said, and they managed to keep that steadily till the end, it was a cross between a Clint Eastwood series and a country-rockabilly musical without singers nor dancers. The charm was in the southern accent which was authentic for some actors and an approaching imitation for others, but believable enough, and beyond these criminals seen as individuals you could see crime as an organized society with its own hierarchy within every gang and a special very confrontational hierarchy among the gangs, knowing that the black gang is completely out though they are the last resort gang that provides the various white gangs with technical and emergency help when needed. They are hated but they are very good at what they are doing like fake IDs and passports, the security blanket of a hideout or some rescue money or even team when things are getting a little bit sour.

Then the hierarchy is very geographical. At the top are the local family gangs and each family fights against all the others and the originality of this series is that a very effective though slightly Dirty Harry in style US Marshall is brought into Kentucky to help the local US Marshalls dismantle the gang system and bring down the die-hard last-longest gang based on the Crowder family and a couple of allies who hate them but have to serve them. So the seasons went on and on bringing down one gang after the other.

The family structure of these gangs is normally centered on a man, but there was one exception, and that really was an exception, of one gang centered on a mother and her sons. It so happens that out of one of these gangs one son changed routes and went up the highway instead of down the low way. He became a US Marshall and he of course was the only one who could be of any help since he had been educated with them all and he knew all their little secrets and their weak points and it never was endurance. Patience was the main asset you had to have if you wanted to bring them down, these gangsters.

The final hierarchy was geographical again since it was the various routes followed by the substances they sold on the black market that had to come from outside. So they tried, and had to try, getting in touch with people from Detroit or people from Mexico and it turned fiery and bitter very fast because in Kentucky they hated the guts of these outsiders and these outsiders looked down upon these red necks. This is shown very well in the various seasons.

The final element that is of interest is the spectacle you get of all the various polices in a state like Kentucky: two federal agencies, FBI and US Marshalls, state troopers and state police, and then the police of every single county whose sheriffs are elected by the people in a brilliant atmosphere of thriving prosperous corruption. When you know that and the fact that the police of Harlan County cannot cross the boundary line of the county, you imagine the mess and ease with which one criminal can cross that line. One crossing point is a bridge with the line right in the middle which became the meeting point of all negotiations, all exchanges, all encounters between bands, gangs and various police teams. That means in the US police work is impossible, coordination is a dream and when it is tempted it turns into a nightmare, and the local cops are very simply trained to profile the appearance of a passer-by by his look, skin color, hat, way of walking and other attitudinal and behavioral elements and when a total stranger is profiled into one dangerous category at first sight using a weapon becomes not an option but a reflex. And the only information they can get is from snitches or confidential (criminal) informers.

Thats the problem with Raylan Givens. He had the bad habit of shooting faster than his shadow took to open one eye and he had to learn some restraint. But he managed and strangely enough he remained fair and faithful to the woman who was not really involved but entangled in the Crowder gang to the last moment and even when after all that noise, but well you will have to find that out by yourself. Somewhere deep under Raylan Givens was a sentimental baboon or maybe puppy. Thats the main interest in the man. He was able to feel some emotions, some passion even though he would never admit it because he is a man and in his gang and anti-gang training sessions a real man does not feel any passion, emotion or sentiment. The surprising element is that he survived but we knew that from the very start. Maybe they could have tried an ending  la Prison Break or Dexter. A little bit lackluster.

I share with you below my personal review of my order experience on your website. The product (Justified complete serie in Blu-ray) is presented as All region meanwhile on my Blu-ray player (Sony BDP S 185), the season 4 and 6 are geoblocked. I have contacted the Sony pictures entertainment customer service that is unable to solve the problem.

I think Im dumb
Why I am not going to use services like Amazon, Sony pictures entertainment and others anymore: the long and impossible journey of the cultural amateur

The title seems extracted from a Nirvanas song mixed with the prose of a pretentious old-fashioned writer but they try to present a bad customer experience that I hope will give ideas to the authors, creators and directors that are not at ease with big international companies as the only alternative to promote and sell their creations.
Flashback: origins of dumbness
I remember a long time ago, when the internet was not already public and that dumbness was global, people used to go to see movies in theatres, grab music and movies on physical tapes and share them between circles of passionate fools. I don't know if it was better or worse but the cultural access was:
Limited: it was hard to find culture (if you were geographically isolated for example)
Cheap on a financial aspect but expensive at a personal level: you had to physically move yourself a lot to find cultural information and products
Direct : once you found it, you can always immediately enjoy it and share it again
Hours and hours of music and movies have been shared with the technical possibilities offered at that pre-internet time. Then has arrived the first years of the world wide web that have blown up everything that we knew. For good. Culture and cleverness were human kinds future. On another way, not follow the copyrights rule was definitively criminal (even the FBI from then was mobilized, but this is another story).
Dumb and dumber
Let me present myself, I am part of the kind of audience that is ready to go to a theatre to see a movie (maybe multiple times with different people if the movie worth it), then buy the DVD because it comes faster on the market and finally buy the Blu-ray because definition matters. I can even buy a movie to watch it online if I am out of my home and that I want to show it to friends that have missed it. I have always thought piracy is rubbish, not because its illegal but due to the fact that it takes (in theory) much more time and technical skills than buying it online. Lets say that I am the perfect target that any digital ecommerce company has always dreamed of.
Except that
Im definitely dumb.
For example, I always try to avoid buy products to fiscal delinquent companies. As a stupid fool that I am, I always pay the taxes due to the community so I expect from a commercial company that sells products in my country to be fair and do the same. Saying that I see the sarcastic smiles of people reading this review because (of course) meanwhile I try to have that moral position, the entire world don't mind. And it will surely keep working well with or without me. But as I said, I try not to do, so sometimes I have to stop being dumb and I am forced to act smart. And I have to confess that sometimes I use fiscal delinquent companies as the rest of the world.
On another part, as the technical expert that everyone need to be if you want to buy cultural product online, I always read the small lines on an online product description. For example, if it is a Blu-ray movie and depending on your reproduction devices, you have to check screen format, audio format encoding, player regions,  If you make only one mistake and that you care for quality, you are doomed. The modern era has changed us to audiovisual engineers.
Justified, a recommended crime serie on a non-recommended store
I have recently bought the Justified complete serie on Blu-ray on Amazon.com published by Sony Pictures Store. I had bought the first 3 seasons in Europe on DVD format and the complete serie is only available on Blu-ray in the states. You cant buy it on the American Sony website (because you are in Europe). But on Amazon.com, yes you can! Checking the region format I have seen that it is labeled All regions. We are talking of a $119,71s shopping cart, so its a nice sale for Amazon.com.
I like this serie a lot because it shows the acts of a US marshall very fond of fire weapons, that kills almost all human living that cross his way if they don't agree with his interpretation of justice. As the title of the serie indicates and according to the point of view of the main character, killing is justified. Stories and actors are awesome; its a crime serie masterpiece. You can easily imagine the excitement when I received the pack at home and wanted to begin the fourth season. So I put the disc in the player and I have that message: disc blocked for the device geographic settings, check the regions on the package. I do verify the regions but there is no indication neither on the package nor on the problematic disc. I try to play some discs from the other seasons and I discover that regions 1-3 and 5 works correctly meanwhile 4 and 6 don't (I have a Sony BDP - S185). It is not necessary make any personal comment at this moment to explain the state of mind I was in.
But my dumbness doesnt stop here. As it is a special edition, Sony Pictures Store has kindly included an Ultraviolet version. Fine. Without having any idea about what an ultraviolet is, I thought that maybe there was a way to resolve the geo-blocking. I go to the Sony Pictures Store and search for registration button but there isn't any. I try to change my IP to an American to check it the website is different for American customers and yes it is. I do the  registration (in the modern era, we are bureaucratic engineers too, see David Graebers last book) and now I have to enter an identification code. I have a sticker on the package that say that I have an ultraviolet version but its only for American buyers. At this moment of the evening, I arrived to the sad conclusion that I am so lost into the bureaucratic rules of commercial companies, that actually sells music and movies, that I am obliged to finally download the illegal nerdy torrent files of the fourth season of my favorite crime serie. And, as Raylan (the main character) would say in the serie, it is justified.
Lets get dumber
Regarding this example of an impossible journey to watch a TV serie on Blu-ray at the age of self-conducted cars, what would be the next step for dumbness into culture?
We could say for example that one main thing that cultural amateurs desire is to have a meaningful service that rely us to our favorite authors, actors and directors. So what about them? Why cant we ask them to deploy their own legal servers directly from their production offices or their homes? Technology is each day cheaper and ready-to-use like.
And if I may go to the ultimate level of stupidity, I would love to suggest to Timothy Oliphant (Justifieds main actor and producer), to set up directly a paying peer to peer community where we could watch and share recommendations about his serie. Kill the bad  intermediates that block the process and promote a direct access.

Probably most was filmed in Hollywood, but I saw a lot of KY in the series.

7360674,3,B013539XIS,"While I would give the series itself 5 starts for its writing, acting, production quality, etc., I can't give such a high rating to this set.

I have seen no scratches on any of my BluRays, but the approach of using cardboard sleeves to hold the disks, based on past experience, is certainly more prone to damage.

However, the major issue I have to quibble with is the inclusion of UltraViolet for the digital copies:

-These digital copies are not in high definition. (According to the page, they are are standard definition.)
-UltraViolet is an extremely fragmented platform with generally awful user experience. I get that the studios don't want to share profits with Apple, but they need to give consumers a choice rather than forcing their 2nd rate streaming service on buyers.

Finally - and I doubt anyone much cares about it - the flask seems to be extremely poor quality and its inclusion is a little mystifying to me - in what sense does it represent the show? Raylan's badge, a miniature hat, etc. would have been more representative of the show. Personally, I'd have rather the flask not be part of the case for the BluRays as it just makes the set bulkier.

Full disclosure - I bough this set despite already owning seasons 1 & 2 on BluRay as it was on sale for ~$75 (a cheaper price than it would have cost to buy the additional seasons individually).

Bottom line: the full price of the set is not ""Justified"" by the extras or format of the digital copies, but still a good set if you can get it on sale.",1447286400,8,1520,4.509090909090909

I had stopped buying the individual seasons after season 4 when I decided that I'd wait for the inevitable deluxe box set. Finally got around to it. Checked out the top option. Although I usually go for the sets with the booklets I felt that I couldn't ""justify"" $156. just so that I could get the flask. So, since Amazon rated it highly I patted myself on the back and dropped down to the $56 version. I was disappointed by the cheap packaging, which was already broken when I opened the box. The thin plastic extrusion was never going to last. Then the system for storing the discs, all of them just stacked in the broken sleeve, is about as organized as dropping them into a shoe box. Now, I know that I am an obsessive, that nicely designed packaging appeals to me, (The Columbia ""Complete Miles Davis"" series, studio and ""bootleg"" deserve high points), but in the end it is about the content. So, I put my negative feelings aside and settled down to enjoy re-watching the entire series. Finally, that straw, the one on the camel's back. The damn discs have resolution which appears as if it were shot on a cheap cell phone from an out of calibration flat screen. I only gave this one star because there isn't an option for no stars. I'm sending it back. I'd like to duct tape it to a brick and send it back through someone's window...but whose? I've now become ""justified"" in buying the deluxe package. I'll enjoy the booklet.
