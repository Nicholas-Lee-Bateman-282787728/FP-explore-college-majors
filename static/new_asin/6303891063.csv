Not enough for the player starting out.

7855131,5,6303891063,"This was the first instructional video that I saw, but I believe that it is one of the best.  Filled with highlights from competitive tournament play, computer animation, and shots from different camera angles, this video is helpful to understand the different spins and strokes used to master the game.  I believe that this video is essential for both beginners and advanced players for reasons for both.  For beginners this video is good because the different types of strokes and service types are clearly and concisely explained in a very understandable way.  As for the advanced player, this video may be helpful to refresh your memory on these various techniques.",1055376000,8,669,5.054545454545455
