6673321,3,B00NO3GF1I,"I remember seeing this film back on cable tv in the early 1980's and never forgot it.  I was only 13 or 14 years old then and it made a huge impression on me.  When the blu-ray came out I had to buy it to see if it was as weird as I remembered.  Take a group of kung fu badasses. a gang of weirdo thugs led by a German maniac, a clan of cannibal monks, zombie ninjas, hot babes who undress a lot, an old couple that argue all the time, lots of juvenile humor, and low production values and mix in a blender.  ""Raw Force"" is the result of that mish mash of craziness.  It was fun seeing it again but was not a good movie by any means.  Still, this movie has to be seen to be believed for fans of exploitation cinema.",1420070400,3,715,3.863013698630137
6673322,5,B00NO3GF1I,I watched this in the theater back in the seventies and enjoyed the action in this film it is treuly a different style of film.,1419206400,,127,4.12
6673323,5,B00NO3GF1I,"Very good movie!  Not boring at all.  This movie has pretty good kung fu action, nudity, women running around nude, T&A, zombies fighting with swords, cannibal monks.  Plot was very stupid, but you don't watch exploitation movies for the plot.",1417824000,,243,5.025
6673324,5,B00NO3GF1I,"This movie was ridiculous. Lot of fun, watch it with some friends. Plenty to laugh at here.",1417651200,,91,4.411764705882353
6673325,5,B00NO3GF1I,"By far the best 'So-Bad-it's-good' movie that I've ever seen. I had never heard of this, then saw it on the big screen as part of a movie marathon, and HOLY COW did it EVER leave an impression. It's got Kung-Fu, cannibals, sex, zombies, and plenty of stock footage re-used from Joe Dante's 'Piranha'. This movie is as cheesy as they come, and you won't find better if you're looking for 'Ridiculous'. Move over, 'Troll 2', this is the REAL 'Best Worst Movie'.",1416355200,2,459,4.542168674698795
6673326,5,B00NO3GF1I,"If you are wanting to check out one of the best examples of early 80's exploitation cinema, look no further than the highly entertaining 1982 cult classic ""Raw Force"" (a.k.a. Kung Fu Cannibals). This film has it all: female nudity, copius amounts of poorly staged chop socky fight scenes, kung fu zombies, more female nudity, wooden acting, quick pacing, Cameron Mitchell & yet even more female nudity. It's trash of the highest order and highly entertaining. The movie moves along at a brisk 86 minutes and is never boring. I hadn't seen this movie in years and was thrilled to see it get an official blu-ray release courtesy of the fine folks at Vinegar Syndrome.

I'm a firm believer that any film no matter how obscure has its fans and deserves to be given a chance to be seen & enjoyed in the highest quality available. Thankfully, ""Raw Force"" gets an incredible 2k resolution scan from the original 35mm camera negative and is presented in it's original theatrical aspect ratio with the matting opened up ever so slightly from 1.85:1 to 1.78:1. The negative is in surprisingly great shape and no digital scrubbing was done to remove any of the grain so the film retains a nice filmic look with amazing detail present in every frame. There are a few instances where some print damage is visible in some of the slow motion sequences but this appears to be a fault of the original filming methods and not a fault of this HD transfer itself. Colors are deep and very robust. With gratuitous female nudity filling almost every frame, the skin tones look appropriately natural. This movie gets the kind of love and attention in this release that a lot of much more well known films will never get. The audio is presented in 1 channel lossless mono which is how it was heard theatrically. The dialogue and sound effects/musical score are nicely balanced. It even gets a few nice extras such as the Destination: Warriors Island featurette with the director and cinematographer interviewed (that runs a little over 14 minutes) as well as an audio interview with the finishing editor which runs 5 minutes. The original theatrical trailer rounds out the extras. While not a massive amount of extras, what is included on this release is informative and well done. I should also mention that this is a blu-ray/DVD combo pack. The only small quibbles that I have is the lack of english subtitles for the hearing impaired as well as the film being broken up into only 6 chapters.

For connoisseurs of fun cinematic trash, you can't do much better than ""Raw Force"" and the blu-ray presents the film better than it has probably ever looked before and since.",1414368000,15,2646,4.737527114967462
6673327,4,B00NO3GF1I,"great classic 80s sleaze fulled with nudity , martial arts , zombies and overall a fun flick , great quality , slim on special features but thats to be expected",1414368000,,160,4.366666666666666
6673328,5,B00NO3GF1I,"A group of passengers on a cruise end up stranded on Warrior's Island, a treacherous place inhabited by exiled martial artists and a group of cannibal monks with the power to raise the dead (what a combination!). The passengers, including an L.A. S.W.A.T. team member (Jillian Kesner) and four male martial artists, not only run afoul of the island's inhabitants, they also interfere with a white slaver's business of selling young girls to the monks in exchange for baskets of raw jade. The monks eat the young female flesh and gain the power to raise dead martial artists from their graves (the cruise ship director calls the island, ""The Potter's Field of Kung Fu.""). While the passengers try to find a way off the island, they must endure gun battles, kung fu fights (with both the living and the dead), cannibalism and the nasty laughing monks (led by Filipino horror staple Vic Diaz). It all ends on a happy note, as most of them escape in the white slaver's plane (he is eaten alive by a school of piranhas) while an end scrawl reads, ""To Be Continued..."". This is terrific B-movie stuff. It has loads of nudity and plenty of bloody action, including impalements, explosions, an axe to the back and a decapitation. Star Cameron Mitchell (NIGHTMARE IN WAX - 1969 and countless others) seems to be having a good time here and doesn't walk through his role as he has done many times before. Co-star Geoff Binney also appeared in the kung fu comedy HOT POTATO (1976), while Jillian Kesner was the star of Cirio Santiago's FIRECRACKER (1981) and also appeared in her husband Gary Graver's awful ROOTS OF EVIL (1991; Kesner died in 2007 of a staph infection, a little over one year after her husband Graver passed away). She was a pretty thing! Jennifer Holmes also co-starred with Mitchell in the abominable film THE DEMON (1979). Director Edward Murphy later made the forgettable actioner HEATED VENGEANCE (1984). RAW FORCE (also known as SHOGUN ISLAND and KUNG FU CANNIBALS) is that rare example of a mixture of genres that works well on nearly every level. I was expecting a lot less and was pleasurably surprised with the result. Available in a DVD/Blu-Ray combo pack in its original OAR from Vinegar Syndrome. Rated R. NOTE: These discs will play in all Blu-Ray players worldwide.",1413331200,17,2287,4.792405063291139
6673329,5,B00NO3GF1I,"Not a big fan of zombie films, and I don't like Kung Fu due to the violence.  This a really good movie though.  Documents an extraordinary time in Philippine history- the early 1980s.  Jokes are a bit crude, but the plot is thick.

One minor issue:  The credits list actors who played 6 monks, 8 hoods, 8 corpses, and 10 Hookers... but they don't say when each person actually appears on the screen!!  Viewers are left guessing who's who......",1435449600,,443,4.544303797468355

6673331,5,B00NO3GF1I,"I first saw this movie on the Grindhouse Experience box set, and loved it immediately - An island of undead disgraced martial artists, and the Burbank Karate club? White slavery, and a hitleresque villain? Wow.

When I saw it was on blu-ray, I had to check it out.  The grindhouse dvd version looked like it was duped from a beat-up old VHS tape with tracking problems.  This blu-ray looks like an entirely different movie!  It's suprising how good this looks! A ton of interesting extras make this disc a must buy if you enjoy this sort of thing.",1429747200,2,547,4.551020408163265

6673333,4,B00NO3GF1I,"Blu-Ray Review: The video quality is great for a 35mm restoration but still there is some damage which I love. Perfect picture quality sucks anyways! The audio is good. Special features is a featurette and some audio interview.

Movie Review: This is a nice piece of cinema trash. Though I have seen much better ""so bad it's good"" films, this is pretty well done. I enjoyed the bad acting, the abundance of hot naked chicks with nice butts and boobs, the martial arts action and the kooky characters. I just wish there was some dismemberment. But whatever.

Conclusion: 5 stars for the Blu Ray and 3 1/2 for Raw Force.",1429142400,2,618,4.609090909090909

If you're not a fan of vinegar syndrome releases like this, then you're living life wrong.",1422489600,,265,4.428571428571429
6673338,3,B00NO3GF1I,"Three Stars for the packaging and presentation, as most DVD collectors would come to expect some extra bonus features to footnote the film.  Also the transfer is top-notch considering the source, great job Vinegar Syndrome.
But I cannot go above 3 stars because the movie is in no way above average at best.",1421625600,,307,4.7924528301886795

8679429,5,B00NO3GF1I,"I saw an offer for one of the earlier releases of this, started researching other options due to the allure of Martial Arts Zombies (and not separately, but undead that are trained to chop-socky their victims to an early demise), and was delighted to find that Amazon was carrying this latest/ultimate edition brought to us by the standard-bearers for quality sleaze, Vinegar Syndrome.

""Raw Force"" has so much going on in it for Schlock movie lovers that my mind felt like a perfumed compost heap two minutes into the feature.

I'm never quite sure if Cameron Mitchell is really acting. Surely anyone that performs this over-the-top in front of a camera must be, but It always warms my insides to see him listed as a cast member because even with a z-grade script he comes across as so organic that you'd think he was just some guy that walked onto the set after a few beers, ready and willing to stir up the required trouble,

Add in the irreplaceable Vic Diaz, seasoned with unhealthy doses of the regular ingredients that make a drive-in/grindhouse movie a must-see, and there is no turning back. May as well cash in all your troubles so you can sit wide-eyed in your favorite chair and enjoy the aroma of your brain sizzling in a frying pan. Bib optional.",1501459200,,1260,4.641255605381166

8679433,5,B00NO3GF1I,"Raw force falls into the same area as films like Zardoz, The Vistor, Miami Connection, etc. It is a really fun wacky movie  that really isn't good. It's one of those movie that the MSTK 3000 guys might have made fun of but you ended up having more fun watching the movie.
No one would have done a good a job restoring this, than the guys at Vinegar Syndrome who once again do a great job restoring this film.",1452384000,,408,4.1645569620253164
