8205048,2,6302744490,"Although the movie does show real life on a submarine, it is far too brief (59 min.) to be worth while.  Half of the film is spent on submarine history which detracts from the excitement, and the fact that it is now 12 years old doesn't help any.  Look for a longer, more in-depth video that can effectively portray submarines.",982195200,,327,4.433333333333334
8205049,4,6302744490,"I served on board a 688I class fast attack for 5 years and this video tells it like it is.  But it would have been nice to maybe also seen some inport time, such as the upkeeps and normal inport routine. Brought back lots of good (and not so good) memories.  Excellent job.",978307200,,273,4.132075471698113
8205050,5,6302744490,"I served aboard a 637 class fast attack submarine 23 years ago. This video while being shot on a larger 688 class submarine brought back fond memories  of my days of submarine duty. The tight confines, the hard work, tension,  drills, and even angles and dangles. By far the best documentary of life on  a fast attack, aka. Hunter/Killer submarine I have seen. If you have never  been on board a sub and don't understand life as a submariner, this will  explain it. well done",966643200,3,475,4.541176470588235
8205051,5,6302744490,"The vast majority of this video was shot underway, onboard the H.G. Rickover, SSN-709 just after I transferred off.  It's the real crew members and shows everything we went through...beginning at submarine school to  underway and operational.  Great Movie!",939600000,11,256,5.512820512820513
