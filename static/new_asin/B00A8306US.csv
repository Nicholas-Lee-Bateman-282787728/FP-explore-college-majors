5399547,5,B00A8306US,"I stumbled upon this anime title by chance, and what a lucky guy I was. In the middle of so many unmemorable ""Slice of life"" anime titles, this one stood up like no other.

Featuring Yutta a college student whom was raised only by his older sister, find history to repeat itself placing her 3 daughters ( 2 of which are not related to her by blood ) in his care.

The struggle for him to make it work, will it be a success or a failure ? While taking in consideration all the obstacles he and the 3 girls face.

A story that tell how love, family, sacrifice, courage, perseverance and friendship can change lives.

And as you guessed I Rate it 5/5",1360713600,,647,4.193548387096774
5399548,5,B00A8306US,"Sora and Miu are not related to Yuuta by blood. His sister married their father, so she is his niece by marriage only. And he is 18 or 19 to her 14, which makes just 4 or 5 years' difference. There were nine years between my parents. 14 is too young for marriage or anything serious, but there isn't anything serious at this point anyway. When she's 18 and he's 22-23, if they love each other, there's no issue. Incest is not involved.

Given that incest is the only reason Blondeau rated the anime at 4 stars instead of 5...I rate it 5.

Oh, by the way, the series made it clear that all 3 girls had different mothers. I believe at least one of the first two died. So all three girls have had their share of tragedies, and they are all doubly orphaned. It's nice that the father's family ultimately accepted Yuuta raising the girls.

Apparently the manga goes farther and has Sora and Yuuta getting married. It's in Japanese only and I haven't tried finding a translated version, so I can't confirm that.",1357084800,5,1005,4.39247311827957
5399549,4,B00A8306US,"Color me shocked. When I saw the first screenshots of ""Listen to Me Girls, I Am Your Father!"", my mind instantly painted the ugliest picture of it. For a jaded anime viewer, some shots of three underage girls being taken care of by a college-age man looks like yet another sketchy sex comedy. Out of curiosity at how abhorrent and trashy it would be, I watched the first episode. And then the funniest thing happened.

It caught me off guard, kicked me in the gut, and dragged me through all of its 13 episodes with force. And I loved every second of it. ""Listen to Me, Girls!"" is one of the best anime comedy-dramas in recent memories, and any fan worth their salt owes it to themselves to watch it.

Yuuta is a single college student, barely scraping by in his studio apartment. His luck with the ladies is suspect, and he only has one or two good friends to speak of. His life is about to get a lot harder, though; his sister wants him to look after her three rambunctious daughters for a few days, while she's overseas with her husband. He agrees, knowing he's got his work cut out for him, but also knowing it's only temporary.

Spoiler alert: it's not. In the second episode, the girls' mother and father die in a plane crash. The relatives want them to be separated and to live in different households, but Yuuta knows that would devastate them. So instead, he devastates himself by taking them all into his flat. Thus begins a roller coaster of double-shifts, angry landlords, and (you guessed it) typical ribald anime hijinks.

But the thing is? The latter part is mostly comprised of suggestive humor, nothing more. Furthermore, it only seems to be tacked on to ensnare the creeps, because the core concept of the show, as well as the execution, is incredibly tasteful. Not only that, but it treads into territory most ""harem"" anime (if you could even call this that) doesn't: realism.

The most admirable thing about this show, in my opinion, is its harsh, cynical take on the classic(?) ""let's have a bumbling guy drowning in estrogen"" concept. Yuuta constantly needs to find work, barely scraping together enough money from part-time jobs to pay his rent and put food on the table. His apartment is cramped, the girls are always causing trouble, and the landlord threatens to kick them out. This is not a candy-coated jailbait fantasy; this is, more or less, what would happen if a college dude started taking care of three kids: chaos.

Speaking of the girls, they're some of the most believable in anime. Most impressive is Hina, a precocious three year-old who stumbles and trips through life with little regard for anything but her own curiosity and her sisters. As somebody who has worked taking care of preschoolers before, I can attest to the fact that the writers obviously have a small child of their own, because the things that Hina says and does are startlingly accurate to how a real child behaves. Now if only they could have carried that realism over to her hair...

The other two sisters are slightly less well-written, but strong characters nonetheless. Ten year-old Miu is ditsy and obsessed with having a boyfriend, which naturally leads her into some messy situations later on. She displays some convincing traits, but ultimately, the writers tried too hard to fit her into a character archetype as opposed to letting her expand naturally as a character. My favorite of the three, though, has to be Sora, the eldest at 14 years old and packing a serious attitude. She is fiercely protective of her younger sisters, and not afraid to smack-talk Yuuta when she feels he's being lazy or getting out of line. Oftentimes, though, she does this to quell her own inadequacies. But there's a reason she's hard on him, and it's one that may make or break your interest in the show.

See, Sora has a crush on Yuta. No, this isn't a childish ""I think he's kinda cute but I'm related to him"" kind of deal. This is a full-blown thing, to the point where she routinely dreams about him being in love with her and vows to not give up on him, even at the end of the series. This has some disturbing implications, to say the least, especially when the writers seem to expect viewers to encourage this pursuit. While incest comedies are nothing new to anime, it feels really out of place in this particular series, which is what keeps me from awarding it a perfect grade. At least it's counteracted by Yuta's primary love interest, the downright bizarre ravenhead Raika, who thankfully is of legal age and isn't related to him.

For those who sound weary of the concept, though, I urge you to try and give the show a shot. It's rare that an anime handles losing a parent, taking care of children, or going through college in a realistic fashion, let alone doing it all in the same series. The music is excellent and suitably catchy, and the animation is quite beautiful for such a simplistic series (except for the bizarre elbow glow that you'll notice on the girls... I don't even understand why that's there).

Despite the anticlimactic ending, and despite the aforementioned uncomfortable content, ""Listen to Me Girls, I Am Your Father!"" is a winner. Most new anime coming to North American shores in the past few months hasn't been worth spending 40 to 60 dollars of your hard-earned money, but speaking as a broke college student, I would gladly shell out the money for this show. Cute, realistic, and heartfelt, this is one of the better ""harem"" anime in recent memory, and nowhere nearly as creepy as it looks.

Grade: B+",1354838400,29,5543,4.663254861821904
5399550,4,B00A8306US,"This anime series, a little childish at times, exceeded my expectation.  I found the story line of interest and the art work was good.  I guess the best way to explain the story is to say that it deals with the importance of family ties and how family looks out for one another. I hope they come up with another series since the ending didn't really show what happened to the friends in the club or if the boy ever finished his schooling.",1389571200,,438,4.265060240963855
5399551,5,B00A8306US,"This Anime is actually really good! Good story, about a young university freshman boy who suddenly has to take care of his older sister's daughters, because she and her husband were in a plane crash and were reported missing.
(notice I said missing, and not dead. I still have my hopes that they will return!)

I love that each character has it's own personality and appeal. Each sister has their own personal relationship with the main protagonist, Yuuta. I Especially like Hina's character,the youngest of the three daughters! She's so cute and outgoing! Also, this show teaches you a valuable lesson, family always stick together.

As much as I would like a season two. I doubt they will make one. Given the current circumstances of this Anime's selling in Japan. Please go to Amazon.co.jp and type in ""!"" dvd or BD

Clearly, the anime is not selling well at all in Japan, with very low ratings. It may have high ratings here, in Amazon.com but the creator cares mostly about the Japanese Audience. If you really want to support this anime, buy it from the original! show the Author that he has the support of fans from around the world! And not just Japan! Seems like some Japanese otakus tend to be very picky on their anime's and fail to see the whole picture, and therefore, give it a low rating.

Overall, I give this Anime 5/5 I thoroughly enjoyed this show, and curious on how Yuuta is going to get Raika Senpai!",1379116800,,1422,4.608695652173913
5399552,5,B00A8306US,"This show is not what a lot of people might expect it to be. It is not Hentai (not I fan of)...it does not really even meet the qualifications for Ecchi (some can be rather amusing and the show has its moments for sure). It is a slice of life. Great show, I loved the characters. I love anime for the characters. Japan can do better development in twelve episodes than shows here that last a decade. Reika-san...she is where it is at. She is brilliant yet completely lacking in social skills. She reminds me of myself in a lot of ways. His ""playboy"" friend is developed in a favorable way (I am typically not fond of such people). The club president...woah... weird! I did not think that person to be necessary. Sure  comic relief characters are added...but he made me uncomfortable at times. Despite that elder sister of the protagonist is intriguing (maternal which makes sense, when you consider the age difference and the life they had) and the protagonist himself as well. He takes up a large responsibility as a result of his principles. He does not handle it perfectly, he is rather young. Despite the various problems his decisions pose him he does not abandon his efforts to do what he deems right. Oh, the ""sight-seeing club"" uses ""SS"" as an abbreviation. I do not believe in superiority of race, gender, or sexual orientations. Still, the gag was amusing
I typically do not write reviews, hopefully, I did well enough. It was somewhat fun. If you like dramas, maybe you will enjoy. If you attempting to indulge a fetish...I would just press on. Kidding! Cheers!",1378512000,,1572,4.654676258992806

5399559,5,B00A8306US,"THis was one that caught my eye, and i wikiied it - and the premise intrueged me.  and I watched it, and found it to be an enjoyable and heartfilled story.  The main character is a young college student who was raised by his older sister after their parents die.  Now she is married to a slightly older man, with two daughters from previous marriages (Sora and Miu) and a loveable three year old daughter (Hina).  But when he watches them while they go on their honeymoon, the plane crashes, leaving them alone until he decides to take them in.  Now a small room, three girls (two on which are at THAT age), and a beautiful love interest, can Yutta bring about the happy family, or will he have to let this dream go.

As I said, this was a well written, heartfilled story.  Each character has personalitly, especially Hina, the little weapon of mass destruction of cuteness (everywhere she goes, people love her and give her little treats).  Whille the story is done, it does have a small opening that could bring a second season.  One who likes a story, rather than fan service or over filled with violence.

8548118,5,B00A8306US,"Simple rundown.
While watching his sisters kids while she is on a trip with her husband, a plane crash leaves the three girls, Hina (3), Miu (10), and Sora (14) orphaned, and threatened to be divided between other relatives.  The Lead, Yuta, absconds with the three girls, (the elder two being from his sisters husbands previous marriages,) and attempts to raise them in his one room student apartment, knowing his sister would never wish for the girls to be forcefully separated.

At it's core, this is a cute, sort, sweet comedy, as the girls a Yuta learn to live together, and their personality react to one another.  Sora harbors a crush on her uncle, and reacts violently whenever situations arise with him, which they have a tendency to do.  Miu is slightly more independent, perfering to act aloof and bold, and loves teasing her older sister about her affections.  Hina, the baby, is the adorable one, who is loved by the entire community, with her boundles curiosity, garbled words, and fearless demeanor.

Yuta makes it through, scraping up jobs wherever he can, while going to collage and doing his best for the girls.  Luckily, he is aided by a friend he met in his short attendance to a school club, the girl he himself is attracted to (the seemingly immune to showing emotion Raika, who says the words to her gestures, rather then gesturing herself, (such as ""sob"" or ""stare"") all the while in a deadpan monotone (a la Tsukiko inn Henneko or Ikarus in Heavens Lost Property).  Indecently, also my favorite supporting cast member.)  Add to this a determined Loli pursuer, intent on meeting the two youngest members of the Yuta Household.

All in all this is a nice, heart filled little comedy that tries to show that even in the face of tragedy, things can still work out well, and that good friends and good family is a wonderful thing.",1390262400,3,1850,4.717391304347826
