the acting is typical seventies melodrama EVEN for 'big' name 'stars'.

you won't 'be; disAPPOINTed",1490140800,,144,4.958333333333333
8142134,4,B000HXDWSW,"If you can will yourself to get past the unbelieveably dated look and feel of this artifact, it's really a pretty fascinating film. Shot on a shoestring with a solid B-list cast -- headlined by Peter Graves (""Mission: Impossible""), it actually raises some thought-provoking questions about longevity, entitlement and posterity, not to mention the very nature of what it means to be human. Yes, the whole production is easy fodder for MST3K, but it wasn't too cheesy for Michael Bay to rip off almost in its entirety for 2005's ""The Island"", a far slicker but not any better film.",1421884800,,579,4.858585858585859
8142135,5,B000HXDWSW,"I purchased this movie for my husband who watched this when he was a teenager. I did not personally watch the movie myself, but he loved the movie!",1382400000,,147,4.285714285714286
8142136,5,B000HXDWSW,"I seen this on Tv when it first came out and never did forget it. I remember thinking back then how creepy and eerie it was. As I watch it now I still see a very eerie and entertaining film. Just the basic concept of cloning isn't so scary to think about really, because posssibly with the way technology is advancing it could happen someday. But I thought the way director Fiveson put it together in this movie was very original and haunting psycologically that now its percieved, especially by those who remember it when it first came out, as a cult classic. This proves that you can make an entertaining and interesting film on a low-budget.  They can make all the expensive remakes they want, I know for me it will never have the same eerie, haunting impact has this one. There is a few big names here. Peter Graves is great in this and he's one of my favorites. For me he's best known from Mission Impossible, a 60's and 70's series I like very much.  Dick Sargent from Bewitched and I remember Keenan Wynn from many older movies. The special edition DVD has a great interview and commentary with Fiveson. And it plays and sounds very well.",1308960000,3,1145,4.447619047619048
8142137,5,B000HXDWSW,"Ever since watching The Clonus Horror in the early 1980s (with my young son) I've talked about it but nobody except my son and I were familiar with this movie. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon, not only so my son and I could watch, perhaps laugh at things we then found frightening, but so I could share it with friends.  The film's premise is wealthy, powerful people have clones of varying ages so when they're in need of an organ one is readily available.  With scientific and medical advances it makes one wonder if this could ever become a reality.",1251244800,2,556,4.388349514563107

BTW, Michael Bay's movie ""The Island"" was a total ripoff of ""Parts: The Clonus Horror,"" with some varying bits of other better sci-fi movies as well. Dreamworks eventually reached a 7-figure settlement with the creators of ""Parts.""",1251072000,2,842,7.505050505050505
8142139,4,B000HXDWSW,"A great retro 70's horror movie, special effects a little cheesy but an interesting story.  Tim Donnelly was good in this role - felt very sorry for his character!",1184284800,,163,4.620689655172414
8142140,3,B000HXDWSW,"This VERY 70's movie is about a race of cloned beings that are kept docile in a private clone farm.  The purpose of the clone farm is to serve people classified as ""important"" by creating clones of them to use as organ donors.  The poor clones have no idea of what's going on.  They don't know that they're organ donors.  Heck, they don't even know that they're clones.  When the owners of the clone farm need a vital organ in a hurry, they give the clone a quick party and say, ""We're going to send you to America today.""  Then the clone is slaughtered.

All the clones want to go to America because they're taught from birth that America is a great place.  Of course, none of the clone farm workers makes an effort to inform the clones that the farm is already located IN America.  To keep the clones from getting suspicious of the truth, lobotomies are given to each and every clone on the farm shortly after creation.  Despite such precautions, one clone, Richard, tries his darndest to discover what America is.

Parts: The Clonus Horror succeeds in showing the potentiality of losing ethical values when pushing scientific methods to extend life, and, although it tackles this issue wonderfully, it has a made-for-TV look that I just can't shake off.  No wonder the film was chosen as fodder for one of the MST3K episodes.  You can either use it as an ethical study guide or just something to ridicule, and it works either way.  Interesting...",1168300800,3,1449,4.587548638132295
8142141,5,B000HXDWSW,"I viewed this movie YEARS ago and never forgot it.  To me, that's what marks a timeless movie.  There has been a remake since, but it doesn't seem to work somehow.  After viewing this you ask yourself.....can it really happen?",1166832000,2,226,4.6
