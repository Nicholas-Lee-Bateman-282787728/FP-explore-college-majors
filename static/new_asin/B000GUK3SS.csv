2619796,5,B000GUK3SS,"Unlike some of the other film versions of the Saint, Roger Moore, impeccably groomed & attired, is true to the image of his literary counterpart.  How many of us, on the way to commit a burglary, would pause to add a perfectly adjusted pocket handkerchief to the jacket of a perfectly tailored suit?  With manners to match his grooming & an irreverent attitude toward both convention & authority,  Moore captures the spirit of Leslie Charteris' literary creation.  The first two seasons are in black and white but contain some of the best episodes.  Charteris was closely involved with the production of these early programs.  Some later stories are more James Bondish in nature.  Humor is a vital part of the Saint phenomena in both film & literature as Charteris wrote & envisioned it.  In one early episode, a lady is convinced that Simon Templar works for the British Secret Service and is in fact James Bond.  In another episode Simon sips his coffee and knowingly comments, ""Blue Mountain, lightly roasted, coarsely ground.""  To which the lady replies, ""Instant, fresh out of the tin.""  ""You can't win them all,"" shrugs the unflappable Saint.  This series is adventure, humor and even insight into human nature presented by a fine cast, directors, writers and crew.

Purchasing the individual seasons downloaded to my Kindle was one of my best shopping decisions.  We now have hours, days of outstanding entertainment.  However I am old enough to like the idea of DVD's in my hand to make sure that I can continue to enjoy the exploits of the debonair adventurer Simon Templar, aka the Saint, aka Sebastian Toombs.  Buying the entire series for $149 is a bargain compared to purchasing the individual seasons.  I noticed that some comments on other reviews complain that people  ""review the series not the product.""  So far as I am concerned, the series is the product.  DVD quality is immaterial if the program itself is not worth watching.  Someone else complained that the reviewer did not say how the discs are packaged.  Really?  They come in a box.  The box is a slip case containing four strong plastic cases.  Each case contains several securely attached discs which move in a  manner similar to pages of a book. I don't care if they individually come in a croker sack so long as I get the complete series of The Saint starring Roger Moore, the very best film version made.  Is the packaging really the deciding factor as to whether or not to purchase the series?",1431820800,12,2477,4.794326241134752
2619797,5,B000GUK3SS,"For fans of The Saint(1962-69), this set by Shout Factory should be a very welcome release.  In the mid 2000's A&E released on DVD, all 47 of the color episodes produced from 1966-69.  Unfortunately, A&E only released a fraction of the remaining 71 black and white episodes, produced from 1962-65.

The A&E sets are now out of print, and the black and white episodes were only available on Region 2 DVD.  This Shout Factory release should be of most interest to dedicated fans, some who can finally complete their DVD collection, as the set will include all 118 episodes on 33 DVD's, and will be available at Amazon on the same date it is officially released by Shout Factory.

Simon Templar, aka ""The Saint"", was a man with a notorious and mysterious past, who quite often found himself in the middle of adventure and intrigue.  Author Leslie Charteris created The Saint, and when ITC Entertainment began producing the TV series in 1962, Charteris had already been writing Saint adventures for over thirty years.  Simon Templar, the ""Robin Hood of Modern Crime"", was a man never comfortable with accepting authority.  Motivated by his own unique sense of morality and justice, he had no qualms about taking the law into his own hands.  His travels took him to many places, including the Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa, as well as his native Great Britain.

The Saint's infamous reputation often made him the target of those with malicious intent.  Confident, cultured, and ever the debonair gentleman, the Saint is capable of decisive action when necessary.  Wealthy, yet completely down to earth, Simon Templar is at home most anywhere in world, mingling in high society, sunning in the Bahamas, gambling with the high rollers, relaxing on the Riviera, or cruising down the country roads of Britain.  He's a man that most men admire, and most women dream about.

Leslie Charteris' original stories were initially the primary source material for the series, and feature The Saint engaged in a myriad of activities.  With Charteris providing some oversight of the scripts, the early episodes capture the ""buccaneer spirit"" of Charteris' iconic character.  Although the literary Templar could be quite ruthless when necessary, with rare exceptions such as ""The Saint Plays with Fire"", the darker side of Templar's nature is rarely seen in the series.

By 1966, when the series had transitioned to color, most of Charteris' stories had already been adapted.  In the later years, with a majority of the scripts being penned by other writers, the series loses some of its edginess, and occasionally features a less serious take on the character.  The entertaining full length feature ""The Saint and the Fiction Makers"", is an extreme example.  Even with some flight of fancy, the series still delivers lots of action, as is evidenced by the gritty full length feature, ""Vendetta For the Saint"".

Roger Moore was the perfect choice to play The Saint, and is simply brilliant as Simon Templar.  Moore possessed class, charm, and a dry witty sense of humor, and even more importantly, he brought an air of irreverence and swagger, which are essential to the role of Simon Templar.  Moore (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Maverick/dp/B00CCYNYBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Maverick</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Persuaders/dp/B00NGAJIFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Persuaders</a>) would later play James Bond, in seven feature films, beginning with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Live-and-Let-Die-1971/dp/B001AQT0WW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Live and Let Die (1971)</a>, and was later awarded a knighthood in 2003.

Announced extras include audio commentary on some episodes (which may be the same as on the Region 2 release), and a feature on Sir Roger Moore's experiences while directing several episodes in the series.  It is not clear whether the image galleries that were on the Region 2 release will also be included.

With music by Edwin Astley, The Saint is one of the finest series produced by ITC Entertainment during the 1960's, and features many well-known faces from the period.  Roger Moore dominates the screen time, and ably carries this series with his strong and remarkably charming performance as ""the famous Simon Templar"".",1430870400,47,4386,5.526946107784431
2619798,5,B000GUK3SS,"Roger Moore is superb as the man of means and background who always puts himself in the path of trouble but manages to triumph in these 118 episodes. Unlike his later James Bond affiliation, here Moore as Simon Templar (sometimes using several aliases, including Sebastian Toombs) is answerable to no one. He enjoys helping the law, governments, and people, but is just as pleased going after the same if they are corrupt and evil. He's a modern day Robin Hood, in helping others, but has a reputation as a thief extrodinaire, which he exercises frequently. His greatest rival is Inspector Claude Teale, who Templar benefits and thwarts/embarrasses, and who would like to catch Simon in a crime and put him away for a stretch in prison. During the 71 black and white shows (through 1965) near the beginning of each episode, Simon Templar addresses the audience on camera, drawing the viewer in as though we were an aquaintance. This occurs at least once in the 47 color episodes, which mostly have Simon, instead, making an opening, voice-over narration. The Saint put Swedish automaker, Volvo, on the map as Simon Templar's car became almost a secondary character through the years on this series that was seen internationally. One show has a built in infomercial for U.N.I.C.E.F, which Roger Moore was a supporter of. The color episodes were seen in black and white on ATV in Britain (1966-1969) but were in color on NBC in the U.S.",1426118400,48,1434,4.857142857142857
2619799,5,B000GUK3SS,"I'm really enjoying these - the packaging is simple but robust, and sure beats some of the fancy efforts that look impressive but damage the disks!  The episodes themselves are a decent miscellany of adventures of the tv version of The Saint; i.e. Simon neer personally profits from breaking the law!  Nevertheless there's a lot of fun and Roger Moore's delightful portrayal of the suave Robin Hood of midcentury crime.  All are in black and white (so far, anyway!)

Note that these are region 2 DVDs.  I play them on my old laptop - there are multi-region DVD players (and some that aren't can be modified to be) but the DVD players I have won't run 'em.",1422835200,5,655,4.564102564102564
2619800,4,B000GUK3SS,Pleased to get the Saint Black and White Series in its entirety.  Bought a multi region DVD player to watch it.,1422662400,,111,4.285714285714286
2619801,5,B000GUK3SS,"A&E TV use to sell The Saint series on their website but was discontinued and will not be available again.  Ebay sold the series but trying to find all of them for Region 1 was difficult, incomplete, and expensive.  Amazon sold the complete series in black and white and color but was for Region 2.  The best way I found to get around this problem was to buy the complete series for Region 2 and buy a Multi Region Zone Free DVD player with a PAL to NTSC converter build in also sold on Amazon.  They have many models to choose from.  I made sure it had an HTML connector and a regular AC plug. (However, if it comes with a European plug, just buy an adaptor.)",1404777600,10,660,4.165354330708661
2619802,5,B000GUK3SS,"The early Saint series in black and white (in UK parlance, ""monochrome"") is absolutely one of my favorites. Roger Moore as The Saint is the consummate gentleman--refined, restrained and intelligent. Throw in also macho as a character trait, and you have one of the most watchable and memorable characters from the best years of television. I LOVE the Volvo P1800--so cool. The plots are well written and entirely believable. And the opening musical theme is a classic--creating a mood of sophistication and suspense.",1403049600,,516,5.228915662650603
2619803,5,B000GUK3SS,He was superb in t he role. Would recommend this set to anyone who is a fan of Roger Moore.,1367625600,,91,3.6
2619804,5,B000GUK3SS,I ordered this from the UK to get the complete series. It is only available in Region 2 (Pal) so purchase a region free DVD player which was only thirty something bucks. The black and white series is fantastic and was released in two early episodes dvds in region 1. They only had a few of the episodes on them and are way too expensive now. I highly recommend this collection for all Saint fans.,1364083200,5,396,4.293333333333333
2619805,3,B000GUK3SS,"Roger Moore is an excellent choice for the Saint; and almost all the monochrome episodes have the inestimable advantage of being based on Leslie Charteris's stories, more or less loosely adapted &mdash; although some are very loose indeed.

Which is a bit cheeky of the Casting Director.

The flamenco piece on ""The Golden Journey"" is a sole, beautifully played by Ricardo Corts, of whom I can discover no further trace.

Roger Moore is disarmingly resourceful and detached, and Miss Monroe's legacy
of ambiguous vulnerability is eerily present in the personae of the procession of needy ladies who enjoy the Saint's volvonic assistance.  We ask: can life really be like this?  Well, it used to be.",1463356800,6,479,5.276315789473684
2619824,5,B000GUK3SS,"Years ago when A & E released these episodes in 9 box sets I bought them all. Their last relase for this series was Set #7 and then they stopped. They still had not released 43 episodes and they just decided to stop. Needless to say I was very unhappy with the people at A & E. Then I saw this box set from Timeless Media Group and to be honest I thought it was just another set of bootlegs, complete series or not. I went ahead and purchased it anyway hoping for the best and expecting the worst. The episodes are presented in a 4:3 aspect ratio so if you have a widescreen tv you will have the black bars on the left and right side of the picture. The episodes have not been remastered in any way, it is the same video quality as the A & E sets right down to the little speckles of dirt and squiggly lines in the same exact places. The A & E collection never put any bonus materials in their releases. In this box set Roger Moore provides an audio commentary for 9 episodes. When you navigate the menu system you hear The Saint theme song playing which would have been nice to have on the A & E sets. My favorite episode is from Season 3 called Sibao and it is pretty much a dress rehearsal for Moore's 1973 debut as James Bond in Live And Let Die. To sum it up no Simon Templar fan should pass this up. UPDATE - May 5 - There is a problem with disc 5 of the season 6 episode of Vendetta For The Saint during chapter 4, the scene where Templar is attacked by 2 men on the street the dvd actually freezes up several times, I quit counting after the 6th time. Each time it froze for several seconds. This went on for about 5 minutes then everything was fine again. I'm playing these dvd's in my state of the art Oppo bluray player and it has only happened with this 1 dvd and did the same thing on my computer. I contacted Timeless Media via Facebook and their website but they have chosen to ignore the issue. If this had been a Anchor Bay release they would have stepped up and put out a replacement dvd as the once did with their Highlander the series problem.

UPDATE - May 18 - Shout Factory sent me a replacement dvd and there were no issues with it, so if you have discs that will not play contact them rather than sending your entire set back to Amazon.",1461715200,8,2261,4.080898876404494

2619830,4,B000GUK3SS,Great series but one of the movies in the first season will not play.  Why can't they replace the one dvd instead of my having to return the entire set?,1447027200,2,152,4.066666666666666
2619831,4,B000GUK3SS,I have loved this series since I first saw it as a kid.  ROGER MOORE's Simon Templar easily groomed him for his future role as JAMES BOND.  It is a marvelously good show!,1446076800,2,170,4.121212121212121

2619834,5,B000GUK3SS,Wonderful DVD Presentation. Much better than the oddly marketed sets from A&E in the 1990s that omitted many of the best B&W episodes,1443312000,,133,4.826086956521739

2619840,4,B000GUK3SS,"Great series, it's all there, all the episodes. B&W and the colour ones too.

image quality is top notch, the 4/3 original format was preserved.

Sound quality is just OK. Some distorsion can be heard sometimes, but reflects the original sound, as I remember from the sixties.

All in all, it's a solid 9/10. A must have for the Saint's fans.",1439856000,5,342,4.573770491803279
2619841,5,B000GUK3SS,"I have a standing date with Simon Templar in the 'Swinging Sixties' after work every night- a great way to unwind. I'm now in the 6th and last season and have no regrets with treating myself to this collection. The commentaries on some of the disks are particularly interesting, often with Sir Roger Moore, some co-stars, or directors/producers- it sounds like Roger Moore was always a joy to work with and a very nice human being, to boot. Highly recommended.",1439164800,6,460,4.7625

2619846,4,B000GUK3SS,"I grew up watching the early seasons of The Saint on the local public television station. I had forgotten just how good those episodes were. This set captures the entire series, which is the only complete series collection for region 1. I wish the collection had more special features. The commentaries and one short feaurette are all that were on this set. No matter, the episodes are well worth the price.",1437091200,,407,4.746478873239437

2619849,3,B000GUK3SS,"I would totally buy this set....if it were available as a digital download. The Saint is an excellent and entertaining TV program from the 1960s. Young Roger Moore is absolutely perfect as Simon Templar, the original international man of mystery! Not only is he gorgeous to look at, but his costumes and hair are impeccable. And the show features extremely talented actors and writers with enjoyable stories, despite the limited production values of the day. I'm so happy that all the episodes are finally available in the US in one set. Like so many fans, I have been waiting for years to see the whole series. Having said that, I just can't deal with DVDs anymore. This set has 33 discs! I have no place left in my home for big sets like this. My wife and I have been downsizing and digitizing our media collection. It's so much more convenient -- no shelf space needed, and I can access digital files on any device or screen in the house without being limited to a TV or computer with a DVD player. Therefore, I would give this release 5 stars for the series and because I am so excited that the complete series is now available. However, I'm taking off 2 stars for the format -- should have offered digital download as well. Maybe this set will show up someday on Amazon Instant Video, iTunes, or Netflix.",1435449600,3,1309,4.527426160337553

2619851,1,B000GUK3SS,Arrived with dvd's sliding around and getting scratched due to cheap plastic inserts inside box.  Would rather have paid more for a quality set.  Returned successfully,1435276800,6,167,5.384615384615385

2619853,5,B000GUK3SS,Finally the complete set... Well packaged...,1434067200,,44,6.5
2619854,5,B000GUK3SS,"I've been catching The Saint, a pre-James Bond Roger Moore, on the retro TV cable station, METV.  These shows have been parsed out in ""volumes"", some which have gone out of print.  When I saw that the whole collection had become available in one neat package, I couldn't wait to get it.",1433980800,,286,4.480769230769231
2619855,4,B000GUK3SS,"Before he was James Bond, Roger Moore was The Saint. Based on Leslie Charteris' character, Moore was one of many actors to play the latter day Robin Hood but is probably the characters most famous due to his later fame as James Bond. The show itself is one of the best produced and written TV programs out of England in the 60s. Overall a great show.
Now the set itself. As an American I've waited a long time to get the complete b&w episodes on DVD. An earlier compilation by A&E only has a handful and is now out of print. The only other option was to get a non-region DVD player and purchase the region 2 set 'The Saint Monochrome Episodes"". A bit of misnomer occurs on the discs as they are referred to as ""Seasons"" when on England they were referred to as ""series"". Packaging wise Seasons 1&2 are packaged together in a plastic case, seasons 3&4 together and seasons 5&6 individually. I would have liked a little better packaging, rather than just a slip case over plastic cases.
There are few extras and no accompanying booklet. We get commentary on several episodes by producers, directors and the Saint himself, Roger Moore. I haven't listened to the commentary yet and I don't know if it's newly recorded or older. There are no other extras, although the Region 2 Monochrome set lists a making of featurette and photo galley. Extras like this would have been nice. A lack of booklet isn't a major issue,but again would have been nice with either an essay or photos and episode descriptions.
Finally the episodes themselves look as good as they are going to get. Little remastering was done because I presume that the masters are long gone. Elsewhere people have bemoaned the fact that this set isn't going to be released on blu-Ray but given the given the age and quality blue-Ray might not be kind to the episodes. That aside they look good and sound good.
Overall this is a good set and the only place to get all of the Saint episodes together. If you're a fan, don't pass this one up!",1433203200,18,1996,4.516574585635359

8134771,5,B000GUK3SS,"With Moore's recent passing, there was much talk of his James Bond vs. that of Sean Connery, and of course which one was better. I'm of the age that Moore & Connery are really the only ones I think of when the subject of 007 comes up. I've seen Pierce Brosnan & Timothy Dalton's versions of the role - and feel they did just fine in them - but I wasn't drawn to the direction the franchise was going. And my answer to which of The Two played a better Bond is Connery, but that both of them as 007 paled in comparison to Moore's Simon Templar.

Last time I had seen The Saint was 30+ years ago, when a local UHF station aired an episode nightly, and I'm sure I saw most of the episodes then.  I fell in love with the character's suave roguish nature & his sense of humor, and subliminally tried to incorporate that into my own personality in tiny ways. Now, I'm not ""man pretty"" like Moore, but it should be unsurprising that even a hint of charm can be a very good thing.

There's a lot of material here - 118 hour-long episodes, and I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the DVD transfer. Audio quality is good, and with the exception of parts of a couple episodes the picture quality is stunning - it vastly exceeded my expectations. Some episodes have a commentary track, but I've been unimpressed with them. They were recorded around the year 2000, so basically you've got some folks trying to remember interesting things from 35 years earlier, and they pretty much don't. Not to worry, the red meat here is the adventures of Mr. Templar. If I feel that the character of James Bond went Over The Top as time went on, Simon Templar is perpetually Under The Radar - a very subtle badass, driving a very subtle badassed car (as Volvo put it back then, ""It's either the world's toughest sports car, or the world's fastest truck"")",1501286400,9,1841,4.37719298245614
