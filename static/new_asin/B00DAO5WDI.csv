8591116,1,B00DAO5WDI,when bought all that was said was it was the box set and blue-ray. and after all was said and done it won't even play in my xbox one. only in a after the fact order history look up on the item did it say it won't work (on most) xbox systems. to me not telling me the information i want so i can make a clear and acurate purchase just makes me angry and there for not willing to trust this company to provide quality goods. DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU HAVE A SONY SYSTEM OR A BLUE RAY PLAYER THAT CAN PLAY COPIED DISKS!!,1452470400,4,513,3.849056603773585
