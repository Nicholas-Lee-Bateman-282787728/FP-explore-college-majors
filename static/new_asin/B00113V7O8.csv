8391141,1,B00113V7O8,"Very disappointed.  Am recovering from back surgery, and wanted to watch both the Pacific Coast, and the Redwood Forest.  These DVD's will not play on a Sony Blue Ray, or coventional Sony DVD player.  I called the Ph. number on the DVD case, and was told by owner that I must return, and order the HD DVD on Blue Ray. Blue Ray DVD will play on both machines.  What a hassle. I wish they would have had that info when I ordered them.
Thank You
