8226216,5,B000WZOZNG,"This video is very well done with first-class voice talent including Leonard Nimoy as the voice of Rashi. The animation is hand-drawn and then enhanced with the computer. It has a charm, its not trying to be photorealistic neither it is trying to be a simple cartoon. Instead, you have an animated piece of art with a storyline featuring highlights of Rashi's life. The result is infomrative and entertaining.",1223856000,9,409,4.942028985507246
