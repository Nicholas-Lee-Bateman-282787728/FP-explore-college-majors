Seeing the raw grit required to undertake such a feet, watching the transformation in runners during the 100 mile journey, and finding that triumph doesn't always look so glorious in the process, was all part of what made this film so fascinating. If you are looking to watch a carefully orchestrated melodrama about runners, rent Chariots of Fire. This is real life. This is a 100 mile run!",1261526400,,438,4.8533333333333335
8197218,1,B000QSIZGM,"It was pretty boring, I don't know what I was expecting but I regret spending the money on it. I should have checked netflix first.",1212969600,,131,4.28
8197219,1,B000QSIZGM,I was very disappointed in this video!! I don't know what else to say except I wish I never would have purchased it.,1211932800,,116,4.086956521739131
8197220,2,B000QSIZGM,"I'm a new trail runner and was excited about seeing this, especially since it said it followed two women's experiences training and on the run....the whole package, I thought.  Well.....not quite.  Yeah, it talked to two women, but included a lot of other people and you saw people just sitting down and eating, and what they did at the rest stops....It was kind of a let down.  I didn't get much of the personal running experience of the women, the minute by minute of the trail and their own personal training.  I won't even watch it again.",1203379200,4,542,4.556701030927835
8197221,5,B000QSIZGM,"This was an enjoyable film about ultrarunning and the bear 100. I added this to my treadmill viewing cue! The film has great music, good flow, and incredible shots of the scenery. What an incredible race. It was great to hear from the race director the inspiration and development of the race and the course and how the race has progressed in its first few years.",1200182400,,363,4.515151515151516
8197222,5,B000QSIZGM,"I'm not an endurance runner, but this video encouraged me to get up the next day and run a 5K with my daughter. The scenery is stunning and the story is moving and very inspiring. Great work Mr. Lott.",1198108800,,200,4.153846153846154
8197223,5,B000QSIZGM,"I was sucked in from the opening moments of this film as the Native American music soothed my spirit and the pink clouds dancing over the mountain delighted my eyes. This movie is for everyone, not just athletes. The marathoners' quest unfolds and, along for the journey, we traverse the picturesque mountain beauty of southern Idaho and northern Utah. ""Dancing the Bear"" tells the story of human desire and inner strength as it showcases ultra marathoners pushing their bodies, minds and spirits to their limits and it will inspire anyone watching to get up, go forth and pursue your dreams.",1185408000,2,592,4.93
8197224,5,B000QSIZGM,"Most people would never find the strength it takes to run a 100 mile race up and down mountains in a lifetime.  I'm not a long distance runner / ultra-runner, but I do enjoy running.  This film let me know what it would take to compete in such an intense endeavour.  This documentary takes place in the beautiful Northen Utah mountains. The movie has interviws, and it cuts to the chase about what it takes to run the Bear.  It covers the entire race, from early morning until the next.  If you're a long distance runner that competes / or a jogger that wonders what it might take to be one, than this film is for you.  It's the type of film one would expect to come across at a Banff Film Festival.

Deffinitley a worthwhile short film.",1180828800,5,737,4.297101449275362
8197225,5,B000QSIZGM,The landscape in this movie is breathtaking to watch. The brilliant colors and the cold nights really puts the viewer in the shoes of the runners. The runners themselves also have a great charisma and energy and makes this movie wonderful to watch. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys nature.,1179273600,2,305,4.773584905660377
8197226,5,B000QSIZGM,"As a marathoner and occasional trail-runner, I found this documentary to be both informative and inspiring. I never knew what goes on during these grueling 100-mile ultra running events, but ""Dancing the Bear"" took me into the hearts and minds of both the runners and the race itself. It captures both the highs and the lows of running, both the serenity and the bruised feet, both the exaltation of finishing and mid-race mind games. Cool soundtrack too. I recommend this movie for not just trail runners, but road runners and non-runners as well, as it demystifies much of what makes runners ""tick"".",1179273600,4,601,4.901960784313726
