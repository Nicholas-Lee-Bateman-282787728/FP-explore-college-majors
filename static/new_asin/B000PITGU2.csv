8494837,5,B000PITGU2,"I'm a huge fan of What Not To Wear. With the show having gone off the air, I'm now monthly buying on Amazon episodes from the first four seasons that I've never seen (which means the show hasn't ended for me ... woot, woot!)
Anyone reading any WNTW review I do should know:
1) I'm only doing these reviews to give the ep 5 stars; I will give EVERY ep 5 stars as a nod to the general greatness of WNTW. I admit it, I'm biased. (But really, if the knowledge, fun, and drama aren't enough, the brilliance and wit of Stacy and Clinton push every ep to a 5 anyway.)
2) While I don't have time for big writeups on each DVD, a few observations: Extremely enjoyable ep. The ambush was awesome and Melanie's story had two great hooks: a) her past as a competitive Latin/ballroom dancer and her becoming a dance teacher in a chic NYC studio, and b) her obsession with black clothes. But what really made this ep for me was Melanie's personality. She was so energetic, sassy, and fun! Which surprised me a bit, since I hadn't noticed that as much when she appeared with others in a reunion show a few years later - but that was probably only because they couldn't focus on her in that one. What doesn't surprise me is what I just read: that Melanie went on to much success as a choreographer on TV shows. Anyway, equally adorbs in this one was Stacy's reaction to being able to do that type of dancing for the first time. She and Clinton really picked it up well ... if there wasn't a lot of post-production I don't know about (lol)!
3) Oh yeah, the cost ... $19.95 per ep? WTF! I am a big enough fan of the show, and have the resources, to buy them. But do I see anybody else purchasing them? Probably not. Yet if you do spring for this ep you certainly will enjoy it.
