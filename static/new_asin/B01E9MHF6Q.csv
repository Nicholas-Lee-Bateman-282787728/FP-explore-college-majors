7733879,3,B01E9MHF6Q,"I've purchased the other sets and agree that the quality is not the best, but it's pretty decent, and fact is, that given the times we live, it's not likely that sets like these will be produced in the numbers needed to make a profit while selling them at a low cost.  I will buy this set and enjoy it for what it brought to me many years back when I used to watch Cannon, Monday nights at 8:00pm in Puerto Rico...BTW: back then the series was shown in Spanish..with no titles!  Every episode, a cliffhanger, with all the suspense and smarts that a well developed script ought to have:  These days...practically non-existent.  Thanks for putting this great set out, and I look forward for more seasons ahead.  I look forward to opening the set and watching episodes Monday night at 8:00pm, this time without my parents telling me it was time to turn off the TV and finish my homework.",1347408000,15,884,4.46583850931677
7733880,5,B01E9MHF6Q,"I am already 50 years old and I faintly remembered liking this series when it made its' original run in the '70's.  When the first season was released on DVD a few years ago, I purchased it hoping it was as good as I remembered it to be.  I wasn't dissappointed.  William Conrad was a ""Top Shelf"" actor with a destinctive, one-of-a-kind voice.  I now have the first and second season and I'm extremely happy that season number three is coming out.  I only hope that all 5 seasons will be realeased before too long.",1344643200,25,514,4.368421052631579

7733886,5,B01E9MHF6Q,"William Conrad starred in probably his most famous role as Cannon, another Quinn Martin production.
If you have seen any of Martin's series like ""The Streets of San Francisco"",""The FBI"",""The Invaders"" you will already know what kind of show this is. Exciting stories and plenty of action.
Guest stars include,
David Hedison (Capt Crane in Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea)
David Jannssen (Dr Richard Kimble in The Fugitive)
Richard Anderson (Oscar Goldman in The Six Million Dollar Man)
Martin Sheen (President Bartlett in THe West Wing)
Jay Silverheels (Tonto in The Lone Ranger)
Nick Nolte (Tom Jordache in Rich Man,Poor Man)
Peter Strauss (Rudy Jordache in Rich Man Poor Man)
Paul Brinegar (Wishbone in Rawhide)
Edward Mulhare (Capt Gregg in The Ghost and Mrs Muir)
Cindy Williams (Shirley in Laverne & Shirley)
Apart from acting,William Conrad seems to be a very talented man. He has been a director,producer and narrator. He was the narrator for ""The Bullwinkle Show in 1962. His is the voice you hear on the opening credits to ""The Fugitive"", ""Buck Rogers in the 25th Century"" and other shows like ""How the West was Won"".
He was the voice of Marshall Matt Dillon on ""Gunsmoke"", the radio series, before it was turned into a TV show. For obvious reasons he was not cast for the TV role.
His early roles in movies in the late forties, early fifties was as the heavy. He was one of the killers who guns down Burt Lancaster in his film debut in the 1946 movie ""The Killers"".
His last role was as the Fatman on ""Jake and the Fatman""
The first three seasons of Cannon has been released on DVD.The first two in two part volumes.
Season 4 and the final season is still unavailable as of this writing.",1412208000,,1697,4.66

7733891,5,B01E9MHF6Q,"Buyer beware of manufacture on demand DVD's. I've had mixed luck with them. I ordered the much-anticipated third season of Cannon, only to find the second disc unplayable. Unfortunately, I didn't catch it in time to return to it, so now I'm out the money and can't watch the several episodes on the second disc. I wish someone would grab the rights to this series and release all of it, including the subsequent TV movie. The first two seasons were released on the mass market, half a season at a time, and they weren't cheap. The third season came out on MOD, and it wasn't cheap either. Not sure why this series is such a challenge. Same thing with another Quinn Martin series, Barnaby Jones. The first season came out and that was it.

7733899,5,B01E9MHF6Q,"Cannon, which ran for 5 seasons from 1971-1976, was a terrific detective mystery series led by the incredibly fit big actor William Conrad.  They didn't have altering computers or trick photography back then, so besides his wonderful dramatic ability he appeared to be actually doing most of the athletic stuntwork & chasing of the criminals himself.

7733900,4,B01E9MHF6Q,"Always liked this series, along with Mannix and other 60's/70's P.I. shows. Great casting. Everyone wanted on these programs and made a name for themselves in the process. Looks a little grainy in parts but there's only so much to be done with the original source material I suppose. High marks, overall.",1377561600,,304,4.865384615384615

The style & exploits of Cannon are still wonderful even forty three years later. Filled with great car chases, fistfights and shootouts, Cannon has something for everybody. .Yes it has all the usual cheezy plots and evil bad guys of most TV dramas of the era & works the case like no other private eye Producer Quinn Martin brought only the best action crime drama even today.",1373068800,2,502,4.588888888888889
7733904,5,B01E9MHF6Q,"Really glad that CBS is continuing to put out the seasons of this great show. I didn't notice anything wrong with the quality or sound, and quite frankly growing up in the days when you had to adjust rabbit ears to pick up Cannon on a UHF station, it doesn't much matter to me!",1371168000,2,277,4.148148148148148

7733908,5,B01E9MHF6Q,"This series is a great look into the early seventies. The stories are well done but the highlight is William Conrad as a smart, compassionate detective, clearly aware of his size and the effect this has on others. The show is populated with character actors whose names are unknown but whose faces are as familiar as your neighbours. A good blend of action and plot twists. I am looking forward to the rest of the series. Thanks Amazon!",1365033600,,436,4.602564102564102

7733916,5,B01E9MHF6Q,"Being a big fan of the 70's and 80's detective shows, it is only natural that I would want to keep up with Cannon and get all the seasons. This show and Mannix, are a lot more interesting, better acted, and far better stories than the ones currently on the air. Worth the money for sure",1361923200,,286,4.125
7733917,4,B01E9MHF6Q,"First, I would like to thank CBS home video, for listening to fans of Cannon, and producing the third season. The last DVD release was two years ago. This time Cannon is released in a full season, instead as a half season as before. Another good change. The quality of the audio and video was good. The picture resolution was standard. I, quite frankly would not mind paying a few dollars more for a remastering to HD quality. This was when Cannon was at it's peak ratings wise. It was ranked #10 that year in the Neilson ratings. Cannon was a consistent performer. Like many private detective shows, it stayed to it's ""Who done it?"" formula. Hope CBS home video continues with season 4 and 5 every six months to be released.",1361836800,2,725,4.5

Thank you.",1361577600,,367,4.492537313432836
7733919,4,B01E9MHF6Q,"This is an outstanding TV show, part of the Quinn Martin canon (pardon the pun) of detective/cop shows from the 70s.  My only complaint is with the picture/sound quality.  Like the previous 2 seasons, the image is somewhat murky and faded, like a 16 mm print.  I don't know whether the master reels still exist or not, but the source of these releases seems to be inferior syndication prints (who knows what generation?).  The soundtrack also sounds worn out and patchy at times.  Could they have remastered these episodes to make them as pristine as, say, Streets of San Francisco, Barnaby Jones, Hawaii 5-0?  Not sure what the answer to that is, but I find the discrepancy in quality between Cannon and these other shows to be rather odd.  I didn't have any issues with skipping or freezing, I'm happy to say (though I still have a couple of discs yet to watch).  I have no trouble in recommending this release to fans of 70s detective shows, however, lower your expectations regarding picture and sound quality.  It certainly is better than nothing!",1360627200,18,1052,4.736263736263736
7733920,5,B01E9MHF6Q,I heard alot of people saying that the Quality of the DVD's was not that good but I think there Great..Sound and Picture Very Clear.. People need to understand that there looking at a Program that Aired in the 70's and that there was no Surround Sound then.. or any High Tech Video.. Ive watched these DVD's and thought they were better than watching them on TV.. Very Clear Picture Anyway remember these were made in the 70's.. I really don't see anything wrong with them.. I think there better than watching them on TV... Cant wait till they get the 4 Season and the rest.. only complaint I have is what's taking so long to get these??,1360195200,2,637,4.406779661016949
7733921,4,B01E9MHF6Q,"It is great to have this full third season release, as opposed to the volumes of earlier episodes. Cannon was an international hit, and was still very popular in England and Europe decades after the series ended production. These DVD's, like the earlier unrestored Cannons, were transferred from videotape and wear the 1980's ""V"" Viacom logo after the end credits. Cannon, season 3, looked okay on a 1992 Zenith 27"" color TV, with fair resolution, passable color, and more well developed stories. Frank Cannon, unlike many detectives of the '70's, is a lone wolf, trying to live very well while solving cases. Bring on the complete season 4, please, CBS, and include the 1980 TV movie, The Return Of Frank Cannon, as a bonus on the complete season 5.",1359590400,12,750,4.821705426356589
7733922,4,B01E9MHF6Q,"First off the picture quality is not that bad considering the age of the material. They could have restored it and made the quality of the picture on par with Mannix or Mission Impossible, just  don't watch on too big a screen. That being said, whats not to like about Cannon he a real character, I love the way he thunderers around in that big ass Lincoln of his even going off road in a few episodes. It's good TV from an era when TV was interesting too watch. The disc's are fine in my mind and I deducted one star from the set because they could improved the picture., other than that its great too see Cannon again. Be the way where is the next DVD set of Barnaby Jones ?????

UP DATE....2/7/13.... I see that Amazon is using the packing that CBS does. And it is like season's 1 & 2. And they have the CC on the back of the cover. On the bottom.
And season 1 & 2 does have Closed Caption in English..And it works great.

The menus are of the same format seen with seasons 1 & 2. The 24 episodes are presented on 6 discs. The transfers are adequate, much the same as seen on the first two seasons. Episode promos are included on each disc. The only other bonus is in getting an entire season for less than the price of half a season of the previous sets.

7733925,3,B01E9MHF6Q,"Will update this review when I complete viewing the set, but felt it worth mentioning at this point that at least the first DVD contained an incomplete print of the first episode (""He Who Digs a Grave"" Part 1) which had an odd fade-out and fade-in covering what would have amounted to about five minutes worth of footage by my estimate.

All episodes viewed so far had soft, somewhat faded image quality and rather weak sound indeed, especially in comparison to the robust sound quality that made up for the less-than-steller image of the previously released first two seasons.

All in all, yes, this is better than nothing but purists might be alarmed by the use of syndication prints.",1358380800,,686,4.756302521008403

Kind of bummer had bought part of season 1 and do like to be able to buy at least 3 years of a series.  It is an excellent series.  METV has run this show on Sundays.  The show has excellent stories, great guest stars, and excellent music.  All in all an enjoyable series.",1428883200,2,629,4.10655737704918
8758183,5,B01E9MHF6Q,"I recently bought Cannon Season 3 and it was really good! There were no problems with any kind of skipping,color not being good, nothing at all. It was as good or better than the first two seasons I bought and which cost way too much due to the studio being greedy. I have read on here that Season 3 wasn't that good in quality but I had no problems at all with it. I enjoyed it and hope that seasons 4 & 5 are put out the same way so that I can own the entire 5 season run. Thanks Amazon for having season 3 for us to buy and enjoy!",1425081600,,533,3.810810810810811

I had no trouble playing the MOD discs in my blu-ray player, but I did sometimes have to stop and restart the episode to make the sound work properly. Other than that, no problems here.",1424217600,,453,4.329411764705882
