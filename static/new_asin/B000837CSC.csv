The latter program is designed for self paced learning with ten audio sessions & a study guide, all encased in a hard plastic clamshell. I have owned this complete package since the late 80's.

It shows the seven-step process to build the power of self discipline & motivation into your own life.

In a nutshell, the seven steps are listed below:

DEFINED PURPOSE
MODELS OF POSSIBILITY
SENSORY VISION
THE FIRE WITHIN (DESIRE, OBSESSION, PASSION, ENERGY)
PLANNING
LEARNING
PERSISTENCE

The first three steps are motivational - they provide you with the fire, the drive, the emotional energy (the fourth step) to complete your goal . The final three steps are actionable - they detail the things that must be done for you to succeed.

As your vision fuels your efforts and your efforts bring you closer to your vision, you put together a self-perpetuating spiral of vision, belief, emotion, and effort. When this formula is followed, it will change your life.

This wonderful video clip captures the essence of what Theodore Roosevelt once said: ""The only quality which sets one man apart from another - the key which lifts one to every apsiration while others are caught up in the mire of mediocrity - is not talent, formal education, nore intellectual brightness - it is SELF DISCIPLINE. With SELF DISCIPLINE, all things are possible. Without it, even the simplest goal can seem like the impossible dream.""

I highly recommend 'The Neuropsychology of Self Discipline' audio program, which comes automatically with the 'The Fire that Burns Within' video clip!  I understand it is based on research conducted by author Steve DeVore & Dr Karl Pribram at the Stanford University Neuropsychological Research Laboratories. He studied over 100 of history's greatest achievers & identified the characteristics they had in common, From these characteristics he distilled a powerful formula for self-motivation.",1143331200,3,2129,5.315476190476191
