8118558,4,B000F7CN6M,This is a very good quality DVD. The dances are varied and entertaining. Most of the performers are top belly dancers but the tribal fusion dancers don't seem to match the level of the oriental dancers. The sound and image are excellent too. Overall very professionally made.,1217289600,,275,4.872340425531915
