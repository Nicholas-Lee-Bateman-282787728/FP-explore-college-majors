8324517,5,6302564514,"For anybody interested in the great game of golf and its history,this is an outstanding release,covering the early years up to 1991 when it was originally released(I finally found it this month!!!)Similar sets have been around, but this running over 400mins, great commentary by Pat Summerall, is as complete as you would want. Lovely old b/w footage,great interviews with the stars. Great set,VHS quality is good,a re-release on DVD bringing the history up to date would be even better--get this while you can.",1227830400,4,511,5.168674698795181
