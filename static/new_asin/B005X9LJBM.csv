4902466,5,B005X9LJBM,"After thoroughly enjoying the original Danish version of The Killing (Forbrydelsen), I thought I'd try another Danish series. Borgen (Government) is made by the same company DR (Danish Broadcasting Corporation) that produced The Killing. The series comprises ten x one hour long episodes which delve into the whole world of Danish government. The series encompasses the challenges which face Denmark's first female prime minister Birgitte Nyborg Christensen. Birgitte's homelife, the sacrifices made at home, her relationship with ministers in her coalition government, as well as typical defence, financial, media scandals all intertwine to provide hours of decent drama.
Having enjoyed Forbrydelsen's depiction of Copenhagen city coalition politics, this series features politics on a national level and we see the surprise result of the election, mishaps by rival Conservative and Labour parties, the secret world of Nyborg's spin doctor in addition to the TV1 broacaster which is always attempting to obtain political scoops.
On a par again with Forbrydelsen is the acting - superb! Sidse Babette Knudsen and Pilou Asbk shine as PM and spin doctor Kasper Juul. Familiar faces from Forbrydelsen pop up including Sren Malling (Meyer in Forbrydelsen) as TV1 editor Torben Friis and Bjarne Henriksen (Theis in Forbrydelsen) as defence minister Hans Christian Kongsmark.
Well written and directed, Borgen is a treat. Forbrydelsen fans should keep an eye on Birgitte's husband Philip Christensen played by Mikael Birkkjr. Birkkjr plays a major role in Forbrydelsen 2. Asbk also stars on Forbrydelsen 2.

Enjoy!",1361145600,2,1608,5.590163934426229
4902467,5,B005X9LJBM,"Once again, the Danes don't disappoint with the brilliant political drama, Borgen. This series is so well written and gives an insight into the behind-closed-doors wheeling, dealing, compromise and backstabbing of democratic politics. In particular it explores parliament's co-dependant relationship with the media and specifically in this case, with the number one news channel, TV1. Suspenseful, witty, thoughtful and thought-provoking, the storylines are current and intelligent.
Sidse Babett Knudsen in the lead role finds herself swept to power, an unlikely candidate for Prime Minister, and the first female leader for Denmark. She plays the role with vulnerability and conveys both uncertainty and resolve as her character navigates this new territory. Michael Birkkjaer was compelling in The Killing II and here, his performance as husband of a leading politician is warm, touching and real as both characters naively face unforseen pressures. To be honest, there is no weak cast member and the writing gives each actor an opportunity to really show their range. I don't know what is in the water in Denmark, but their actors are definitely versatile. I'm ordering Season II and looking forward to Season III in 2013.

I really hope the Americans don't feel compelled to remake Borgen as they did with The Killing (and as they do with most successful Danish,Swedish and British productions) and then kill it (pardon the pun) by continuing the show past it's planned 3 seasons. It's a remarkable piece of television and a rare topic that is usually only covered in mini-series (State of Play).  I'm thinking of gaining dual citizenship and proclaiming myself to be an honorary Dane.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Borgen-Season-1-Ep-1-10/dp/B004Z32E0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Borgen: Season 1 (Ep. 1-10)</a>",1346284800,4,1861,5.763636363636364

4902470,5,B005X9LJBM,Really really really good. I ordered season two. I have to say though the husband wife plot is a bit unreal.

4902481,4,B005X9LJBM,"Ok, I bought three seasons...and just finished watching season one. The acting is excellent and the story line is interesting. Almost every person would find this an interesting program and is better than 98% of what American TV offers for entertainment. I was interested also in taking a look at Denmark as a country and trying to get a handle on what their country is all about. That, so far, has mixed results...and somewhat disappointing results. I just don't yet know the truth, but according to this program their politics is very changeable from day to day and their government can be overthrown at the slightest provocation of whatever the media wishes to attack with. Whatever the sins are of the last dirty politician doesn't matter so much because next week they will hold a very powerful position and still be able to attack the present government. Almost everyone in government is having at least one affair and every one of the cabinet is plotting against the Prime Minister. The PM is a far left goody two shoes advocate of giving the peoples high taxes to every leftist cause and is little concerned about much else. It is assumed that the United States is the big evil country of the world and everything that the U.S. does is evil and overbearing(and probably illegal). It is odd that so far Russia is not even mentioned since it is so close by and has played their power politics in that area for a very long time...but, the U.S. is the big evil target here. The media people are portrayed as either go along people...or very aggressive without any doubt that everyone in government is crooked and calculating. Of course private business is also seen as evil, mean and uncaring.

At this point, I am just not quite sure of what this program is telling me about the country...but I will try to read up on that kind of information. I get from this show that their government can tell corporations who they can have on their board of directors. Also that the top people who control the media are appointed with approval of the government. I understand that the meaning of ""free press"" is that it is seen as a good thing that the media uses rumors and tactics to continuously attack almost everyone in government. And of course I am receiving the message that Americans may be tolerated....but mostly disliked and certainly not trusted.",1445385600,,2351,4.6924939467312345

4902487,5,B005X9LJBM,"I can't say I've thought twice about missing the current season of House of Cards with this well-paced and well-written drama in the house. I find it fascinating to see how Danish politics and the politics of spin look so similar, and yet are scaled so differently given the country's size and its place in geopolitics. The acting is uniformly good, and the storylines feel very current even several years on from the dates of the original production. Highly recommended to those who like political drama and don't mind subtitles. I really enjoy listening to the Danish for what it's worth.",1431216000,3,590,4.851485148514851
4902488,5,B005X9LJBM,"Theres plenty of machinations, self-serving and double-dealing is this totally delicious production about Denmarks first woman prime minister and the many challenges she faces. There's also a goodly amount of old-fashioned idealism and principled thinking. Borgens strengths include the superb cast, great story line, and of course the cool Copenhagen environs. The only weakness for me is the far too much emphasis placed on the domestic and personal side, whether that of the PM or her harried spin doctor, the latter played to oily perfection by Pilou Asbk. In either case, at least for me, the domestic scenes always interrupted and slowed down the flow of the story. Moreover, the husband seemed to have two emotions: grumpy and bored. Even in a series this good, I confess I found myself fast forwarding through some of the personal stuff, be it romantic or family. Another minor quibble is that there are no bonus features, which a production like this seems to be made for.

The generally good press Denmark receives these days may be tarnished a bit by this series. Then again it may not. Either way Borgen reminds us that power politics is pretty much the same everywhere. A story about an art form whose currency is attaining state power  inevitably at the expense of others  and using it, not always for benevolent ends, isn't going to be pretty, even in a civilized culture. In any case, sin is always more interesting than virtue, especially for a TV series. The general tone and plot of Borgen reminded me a lot of the Brit series State of Play of a few years ago.

Aside: accurate or no, refreshing the depiction of journalists acting like real journalists, i.e. going after a story and holding officials accountable. In fairness, the emphasis on the spin doctor character reminds us that in politics illusion and perception, not substance, is more often than not the reality. Also commendable is the depiction of the murky existential issues of slippery practices for the cause of the greater good. Of course we don't always agree on the greater good, or the methods, or the best person to carry out the job. And sometimes we have to make deals with the devil. And therein lies the rub, and the joy, of the political drama. Excellent series. A solid five stars.",1430870400,,2278,4.833333333333333

4902498,3,B005X9LJBM,"First of all this is a rip off of ""The Killing"". ""The Killing"" showed very clearly how politicians playing politics affected everyone's lives. This show just removed the murder/police aspect of ""The Killing"" and zero'd in on the politics portion. However, this show is written to uphold the liberal propaganda machine. But even in so doing it highlights what most of us already know about the failures of liberalism--its hypocrisy--unintentionally. For example, ""the first woman prime minister"" runs around telling this person or that person they are ""not ready for the prime minister role"" while she stumbles, fumbles and just about collapses the government before she gets the role and again almost in her first 6 months. If that isn't hypocritical enough she and her ""feminist"" bureaucrats want to force all companies in Denmark to have 50% of their board of directors as women despite cries about how incompetent people would be put in place just for quota measurements. Yet, her own secretary is a woman put in place by a ""union"". And in every episode ""the first prime minister"" wants to get rid of her because the secretary is ""inept"" and was put there because ""no one else would take her"". You also have the sickening pro-immigration stance. Episodes on the poor little Innuit of Greenland and how oppressed they have been by the ""evil white European"". But you hear from the head Innuit's own mouth that their problem with suicide hails from their culture/heritage . . . ""ancient times"". The conservative party members are old, cranky men ""of course"", oh except when they are ""stuck snob"" females of course. The anti-Americanism bit is just too liberal for even liberalism. They site ""bush"" with a lower case and as if it were an adjective instead of ""President Bush"". They try and portray America as some rogue war criminal outpost oppressing the rest of the world rendering Denmark an unwilling satellite territory like we are the Soviet Union and they are Romania or something. They don't mention radical Islam. But they do mention how we have ""illegal prisoners"" of Islam and how their enemy parties in Denmark ""want to ban  head scarfs"". They reference the last part with a gasp, ""they wouldn't dare!"". It is just rehashed headlines made up by liberals thinking if they repeat it enough it will become history. Sad stuff here.",1423612800,5,2338,4.9189873417721515

Writing, acting, directing: this series about Danish coalition politics is simply the best television weve seen in years.  After, as we talked about it, we hit upon a reason why: no graphic sex. This may seem strange --- they're very free and open about sex in Scandinavia, aren't they? Yes, they are, which may be why showing people kissing and then having the proverbial cigarette in bed after sex is quite sufficient for Scandinavian TV. In contrast, American shows like The Affair feature lovers throwing one another against walls and ripping into each others flesh like weasels. Watch an hour or three of Borgen, and, in addition to the high level of intelligence of its drama, youll have fresh contempt for the silly porn on Americas adult dramas.",1418774400,6,909,4.826923076923077

Yet even a country with one of the highest living standards in the world it has challenges and personal tragedies.  You could say there's trouble in paradise.

4902517,4,B005X9LJBM,"The political drama Borgen is a look at the Danish political system from the inside and out.  As noted, it features strong female characters, but to its credit, it looks at the ramifications of politics on the home lives of both the male and female characters.  Since it concerns parliamentary politics rather than our federal system, it takes a bit of getting used to.

Each episode begins with a quote on politics, frequently by Machiavelli, the noted (and cynical) political thinker.  It's appropriate, because the prime minister finds it necessary to jettison political allies and enemies alike.

Who know a subtitled Danish program could hold one's interest?  Borgen does.  Will I watch the second and third seasons?  Not sure...depends on how much time I have for evening programming.  I have to admit it's better than most things on television these days.",1409616000,2,862,5.056737588652482

This added dimension lifts the show above the already lofty level of the others.  The acting and writing are superb, the characters compelling and believable.

With the same abandon that one can regard the scandal that was the Tudors or tsk-tsk the machinations in the ""House of Cards"" , cloaked in respectable history, Denmark is a stand in for intellectual purience.

4902532,1,B005X9LJBM,"Let me see the heroes are a reporter that gleefully commits adultery then kills that man's baby (aborts) after she and an old boyfriend hide details about the man's dying from authorities, has numerous sexual encounters with several men, lies to the public and covers up when it suits her needs yet wants to claim she is an unbiased fair reporter (lol) and is not much of a mother when she has a baby. Then the political spin doctor for the woman who becomes a wacked out left-wing PM. He of course has several sexual encounters, lies to the public to help his boss's political career and is a very rude and vengeful person not to mention being the one who helped cover up the adulterous affairs and death of reporter. Then the really big hero. The woman Pm. Destroys her family so she can have political power. Lies to the public and acts oh so self-righteous ( a very left-wing thing) when in reality all she cares about is power so she can tell everybody how to live. Of course there are huge gaps in the series and it can be summed up as a pathetic sad attempt by left-wing hypocrites showing how they are really dictators while claiming to be the people's champion. In other word's a great big YAWN! I deserve a medal for suffering through 3 seasons although in the last seasons I skipped through because well it was just to boring and I already knew what was going to happen.  So make that 5 YAWNS!",1398124800,8,1404,4.4
4902533,5,B005X9LJBM,"Advance word on BORGEN was that it is absolutely riveting. Hearing this, I was hopeful that would be the case, but also a little bit cautiousat ten 1 hour episodes in length, thats a lot of program to get through, and if it proved to be half as good as expectation claimed, then I had to be prepared to devote a lot of time close together to watch it.

Yes, life can be difficult! For a period of almost a week I struggled to find the time because guess what, folks, BORGEN is as good as it gets. It IS riveting, and finding time to watch it (oh, the luxury of back-to-back episode viewings!) was a challenge but also a nice problem to have.

Imagine that. A show most of us have never heard of, with actors most of us have never heard of, about Danish politics which most of us know nothing about. Superior writing, direction, acting and plotting, however, as well as the fact that human beings are basically the same wherever one lives in the world, explain BORGENs immense appeal and immediate place in the pantheon of outstanding political drama.

BORGEN is refreshing for a number of reasons. The two principle players, Sidse Babett Knudsen and Birgitte Hjort Sorensen, are empowered but flawed women competing in a mans world. Both are beautiful but in different ways, and are much more than merely pretty faces. Ms Knudsen is an immensely appealing forty-something who battles to control her waistline even while running the country. (She banishes Danish pastries from official meetings!) The contrast between the seemingly trivial (to us) dietary considerations and the responsibility of leadership is one way Knudsens Prime Minister remains believable but also accessible to the viewer. Ms Sorensens news anchor is younger and more obviously beautiful, but she is also smart, ruthless and fragile. The way the lives and professions of the two protagonists intertwine is the meat and potatoes of BORGEN.

Equally fascinating though, is Pilou Asbaek as Prime Minister Birgitte Nyborgs spin doctor, Kasper Juul. Michael J. Fox (Spin City) he aint! Juul on the surface appears to be unscrupulous and deceitful, but is he really? He gradually became my favourite character through a demonstration of his sensational daring and guile, which contributed to a key plot point late in this first set of episodes. This is the most compelling aspect of this show, the way the characters unfold, grow and changeand surprise when you least expect it.

Another fascinating aspect of the show for North American viewers is the opportunity to glean an understanding of Danish politicsmade interesting and comprehensible through the drama and the well-rounded characters. How the Danes view the rest of the world, particularly the United States, is both amusing and enlightening.

The show is 95% in Danish with English subtitles, though occasional scenes appear in English. The marvelous English actor Nicholas Wodeson plays the President of the fictional East European country of Turgisia in one important episode. Wodesons facility with accents and ability to be truly different in every role he plays (while being noticeably himself) is truly amazing. The Danish actors more than hold their own with Wodeson and throughout the series. Sidse Babett Knudsen in particular is effective in her portrayal of gradual and subtle change as the Prime Ministers life and circumstances evolve. For such an empowered woman, her PM still retains her vulnerability and thus her likeability, which is a key element to the shows international success and appeal.

BORGENs ultimate achievement, however, is that it leaves you wanting more. With season two and a final season, number three, in the can, one can only hope that the balance of the shows episodes will prove to be as richly compelling and entertaining as season one.",1397433600,2,3806,5.022187004754358
4902534,4,B005X9LJBM,"I'm only up to the first three episodes, but thoroughly addicted already.  Well, maybe just a little annoyed at how politically correct our good-guy heroine is, but I see possibilities for even her to develop a more nuanced and complex character.  There are lots of interesting characters and story lines emerging that hold my interest.  The subtitles don't take long to get past, and i find the infusion of English words and phrases interesting.

Not as dark as some of my other favorite serial tv shows (The Wire, True Detective, even the Sweden's Wallander) but some good drama all the same, one that I can share readily with my less hard-core friends.",1397347200,3,655,4.821428571428571
4902535,4,B005X9LJBM,"I liked Borgen, respected it, enjoyed it. But I didn't LOVE it, as opposed seemingly everyone in the universe (OK I found one luke-warm review out of about 20 by major outlet writers - the rest were flat out raves). My wife loved it. My friends. So maybe I need to see it again? But 30 hours is a big investment in something that didn't blow me out of my chair.

It's about Danish politics, and the almost accidental rise of one woman - Brigitte Nyborg - a member of one of Denmark's 8 parties to the role of Prime Minister - after her less- pragmatic, better known male rivals self-destruct. It followers her, and those around her -- her team, the press, her political rivals -- as they try to stay balanced in the always choppy and morally confusing world of politics.

There's no question the show is extremely well acted. And the characters cover a wide range of jobs, temperaments, levels of honesty and ethics, while almost all remaining human beings (I do wish the leader of the far right party wasn't quite such a cartoon). The human problems the lead character faces as the pressure of high office takes its tolls on both her family and her ethics are believable and moving. And I loved that all the major characters are allowed to be flawed and make bad decisions while still being treated as decent people at heart.

Yet, for me there was something a bit too neat, a bit too old-school in the show's 'crisis of the week' approach, where almost every episode sometimes wildly complex political issues and situations manage to get resolved. While the personal issues are allowed to work in a more serialized way, evolving slowly over time, I don't love how the show pushes to close the book on a brand new political crisis almost every episode. It leads the show to need sudden convenient twists that can feel melodramatic at times, and sometimes makes our heroine just a little too perfect, a little too much smarter than everyone in the room for me to buy it.

None-the-less, a LOT is good in the show, and given it's near universal enthusiastic embrace (and the fact I certainly quite liked it, even if I didn't love it) I may just be forced to hang onto my blu-ray set, and one day give it another go.",1397260800,3,2214,4.5

It was as absorbing as I hoped it would be. It's amazing how much suspense the writers could wring out of parliamentary politics.  This doesn't have the thriller aspect of the British House of Cards (some made that comparison), but it does have sharp writing and excellent acting for the most part.  The character development of the main character was fascinating as she learned on the job and the things she learned, to be an effective prime minister, inevitably changed her and affected her marriage and family.  Characters who seemed like cliches at the beginning (the ambitious female TV reporter, the ethics-challenged spin doctor) turned out to have more depth, without turning into totally different people, and their stories became important parts of the whole.

4902551,5,B005X9LJBM,"{eds. Note: with the cancellation of Dirk Gently being blamed on Brit TVs budget woes arising (partly) from licensing fees for this show, we at The Rotten Review were committed to finding out what was so great about Borgen.  Then somebody remembered that there is a Rottenberg Review in Denmark; our far-flung correspondent Hans Christian Rottinger now reports on Borgen]

The three branches of our [Danish] government occupy the Christiansborg Palace, but nobody actually lives there.  The rigors of attaining high office and navigating the byzantine ways of parliamentary government make that impossible, sucking out the lives of those in government and stamping out their idealistic fervor.

Borgen may depict that by showing the improbable rise of Birgitte Nyborg, the headstrong chief of the shows fictitious Moderate Party.  A center-left politician swimming in a sea of colleagues who like things the way they are, Birgitte is propelled to the forefront by the scandalof other people.  Lars Hesselboe, PM and head of the Liberals, finds himself besieged by allegations he misused official funds.  When the uproar consumes both him and his accuser  Michael Laugesen, the extremely loathsome head of Labour  political gravity sweeps Birgitte into office.

Forming and holding together a government of parties with conflicting agendas proves a daunting task.  Birgitte is not only committed to holding her job but remaking government and keeping her ideals intact.  How well she handles these seemingly intractable problems  sometimes by guile (playing rivals against each other), sometimes by force of will  is what makes this show so impossible to resist.  While Sidse Babett Knudsen makes Birgitte a beautifully multi-faceted character, Borgen excels because it stations characters at different levels to reveal the dynamics and human element at the various stages of politics  the cabinet, spin doctors, the media, Birgittes family, etc.

ISNT THIS WAY COOLER THAN THE WEST WING

I hear a lot of that from Americans  isn't Borgen the better show?  You Americans with your laughable reverse-chauvinism, always wanting to accept anything else as being better than what you have.  The smarter perspective is to avoid comparing the two.  Borgen runs a lean show  our seasons are only 10 episodes long, compared to more than twice that for TWW.  Also, we don't have Aaron Sorkin style scripts that compress six hours of dialog into a 3 minute exchange.  (I cant tell you how hard it is following the subtitles for TWW.)  Borgen is more concerned with the human element, even if that requires showing how fake and inhuman some of the characters can be  even Birgitte.  For fans of topical stories and plot twists, Borgen season one offers an abundance.  For people who think they know about Danish politics (and you yanks who probably couldn't care less), Borgen is definitely a cant miss.",1393891200,,2891,5.210412147505423

4902570,4,B005X9LJBM,"Remember West Wing, some are relating this new Scandanavian series to the US West Wing. Never, in a million years did I think of West Wing while viewing this series.

Sidse Babett Knudsen plays Birgitte Nyborg, the leader of the Moderate Party, who wants to be prime minister. She is a beautiful woman, but knows her own mind and is an example of the 'perfect' woman leader.  Bent Serjo, played by Lars Knutzon, is her PR, spin doctor, Kaspar, and her husband, Philip, played by Mikael Birkkjaer, is a professor. She's also helped by some horrible opponents. We think we have it bad with our Tea Party opponents, these people are much worse.

Borgen, is the nickname for Denmark's Parliamentary building. It's a sensational drama with performances that drag us right into the middle of this political process. Everyone who has seen this series develops a crush on Sidse Babette Knudsen, her character is so amazing in many ways. Her relationship with her husband and her family, ring true to life. The relationships of those who surround her are also titillating and combined with the adventures bring this first season to one that leaves us ready for the next year.

4902571,5,B005X9LJBM,"This subtitled series appears to be a Danish variant of Britain's ""House of Cards"" combined with the BBC production of ""The Hour"".  As such, it's a political/journalistic hybrid.  And one that's very effectively done.  In this series, the Prime Minister is ethical and pragmatic rather than devious. Each episode revolves about her attempts to deal with an impending government crisis.  The other characters in Season 1 are equally likable, classy and appealing--even those who assume the role of ""Bad Guys.""

In addition to reoccurring and sensational romantic/marital overlays, the film displays the illuminating conflicts between European liberalism (e.g. ""political correctness"") and the old world values of ethnocentric European conservatives. Without a doubt, Season 1 is hypnotic and addictive.  It comes off as an extremely intelligent and realistic production with topical themes that could be drawn from today's headlines.

An inevitable by-product of a parliamentary system with many parties where no single party can ever achieve a 51 percent vote. Therefore they are forced to bargain with other parties to achieve enough critical mass to govern.

The story is of course fictional, but it's quite believable as the characters are shaped as real people with their emotions, constraints, and ideals. So, Borgen is not just about power games, toward which the UK TV series ""House of Cards"" leans more. The screenplay writer brilliantly weaves together all these elements of the characters.

In particular it shows that whatever party is the largest it still needs to get into a coalition with and find compromises with a couple of other parties in order be able to form a government and to get something done. A good lecture for Americans.

It also shows how the media people can have a major influence on politics.

I rooted for the irresistable Birgitte Nyborg (played by Sidse Babett Knudsen) from the first episode because she is nice, fun, cute and intelligent. Politics is about compromise, they say, and you wonder how the idealistic Nyborg is going to survive it in government. What is wonderful about the series is that very realistic scenarios are represented in every episode, where we are able to cheer on Nyborg from problem to problem and episode to episode as she trumps her opponents with skilful manipulation at every turn, staying loyal to her ideals. She compromises on some things, to achieve her more important goals. Cleverly supported by her media advisor, whose private passions give us some diversion from the politics.",1368144000,5,818,5.066666666666666

4902694,4,B005X9LJBM,"I am so happy that ""Borgen"" has been released in Region 1 NTSC. I first read about it in in the UK Guardian. Season one of this ten-episode series, which is distributed on four disks, introduces the characters and plot. It therefore might seem a bit slow, and even confusing, if one is not familiar with the dynamics of a coalition government, but do persist. By episode two you ought to be thoroughly hooked (I watched six episodes in one sitting, and the other four the next evening). The series is so good that I want to go back and watch it again and pick up the details that I missed the first time around.

Sidse Babett Knudsen plays Birgitte Nyborg, who rises from political obscurity to become head of her political party. When the voters (in an idealistic scenario) recognise her sincerity and reject the political shenanigans of the conservative Prime Minister and the leader of the Labour Party, Birgitte's Moderate party receives a majority of votes. The Queen therefore asks her to form a government. It is fascinating to see the wheeling, dealing and compromises that she has to make in the process in order to achieve her goal.

The characters are well developed, particularly those of Prime Minister Birgitte; Katrine, an ambitious young television anchor; and Kasper, Birgitte's slightly dodgy SPAD (special adviser) and spin doctor, who proves to be an unlikely common denominator between the two women. Knudsen's nuanced portrayal of a wife and mother whom circumstances thrust into the political limelight and who must consequently balance her very public life with her private life, is totally convincing, especially as she gradually realises that in order to be successful, she has to make compromises and concessions in both spheres.

The series presents parallels to the perilous relationship between politics and the media, the mischief done by tabloid press, political infighting, and what happens when media moguls attempt to influence policy.

Recommended for viewers who enjoy an intelligent drama, and who cannot get enough of politics.",1365379200,25,2066,5.0855457227138645
4902695,5,B005X9LJBM,"After thoroughly enjoying the original Danish version of The Killing (Forbrydelsen), I thought I'd try another Danish series. Borgen (Government) is made by the same company DR (Danish Broadcasting Corporation) that produced The Killing. The series comprises ten x one hour long episodes which delve into the whole world of Danish government. The series encompasses the challenges which face Denmark's first female prime minister Birgitte Nyborg Christensen. Birgitte's homelife, the sacrifices made at home, her relationship with ministers in her coalition government, as well as typical defence, financial, media scandals all intertwine to provide hours of decent drama.
Having enjoyed Forbrydelsen's depiction of Copenhagen city coalition politics, this series features politics on a national level and we see the surprise result of the election, mishaps by rival Conservative and Labour parties, the secret world of Nyborg's spin doctor in addition to the TV1 broacaster which is always attempting to obtain political scoops.
On a par again with Forbrydelsen is the acting - superb! Sidse Babette Knudsen and Pilou Asbk shine as PM and spin doctor Kasper Juul. Familiar faces from Forbrydelsen pop up including Sren Malling (Meyer in Forbrydelsen) as TV1 editor Torben Friis and Bjarne Henriksen (Theis in Forbrydelsen) as defence minister Hans Christian Kongsmark.
Well written and directed, Borgen is a treat. Forbrydelsen fans should keep an eye on Birgitte's husband Philip Christensen played by Mikael Birkkjr. Birkkjr plays a major role in Forbrydelsen 2. Asbk also stars on Forbrydelsen 2",1362960000,4,1599,5.584362139917696

4902697,5,B005X9LJBM,"This first season was so good, I ordered the second. All of my Danish DVDs have occasional brief glitches, but it's so long since I bought American ones--I can see those online or On Demand--that I don't know if this is par for the course.
Following the rise to power of a female politician you get to see the other side of some common gender stereotypes. The characters are 3-dimensional, the decisions they make fraught, and all the time I was wondering if the female protagonist would succumb to the corruption of power. The demands of a multi-party system, where power alliances must be made and can evaporate quickly, are fascinating to watch, as is the Danish take on American politics.
It is no wonder that Danish TV series are so popular in the UK, and a sad commentary that the only way we get to see them here is to order from Denmark through Amazon--but thank you, Amazon, you allow us to be in touch with the rest of the world.
If you liked the Danish original of The Killing, or Bron---The Bridge, which has Danish and Swedish police having to cooperate in a murder investigation when a body is found at the point on the bridge between Copenhagen and Malmo where the international boundaries meet, try Borgen for political intrigue.
Definitely worth the money!
The only difficulty with Danish DVDs is you have to remember which episode you last watched, since there is no English outline of each episode--or if there is, I haven't found it.",1361923200,,1453,4.635658914728682
