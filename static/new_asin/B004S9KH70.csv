8439587,4,B004S9KH70,"Sudhir Mishra's 'Khoya Khoya Chand' is his tribute to the classic Hindifilms of the 1950s-1960s which is considered the golden era of Hindi cinema.
The characters are very well written. Even the supporting characters have a strong presence with little screen time (of course credit goes to the actors as well).Shiny Ahuja is brilliant as the tormented Zafar. Rajat Kapoor is a scene stealer. Ditto Sonia Jehan who is wicked, seductive and vulnerable as the sensual Ratanbala. Vinay Pathak is sublime. Sushmita Mukherjee and Saurabh Shukla provide some comic relief.

'Khoya Khoya Chand' was a visual treat for me and seeing current actors in this period piece made me feel as though I too had moved back in time and was watching a movie sometime in the 1960s. It might not be a film that adhere's to everyone's taste but it is a wonderful film to watch.",1304640000,2,853,4.802721088435374
