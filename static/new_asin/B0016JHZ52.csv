8262716,5,B0016JHZ52,"I saw Marvin Perkin's presentation last night. No, haven't yet bought this DVD.  I most enthusiastically ""second"" the previous made comment. The fireside was packed in Bellevue South with over 400 people, all learned a whole lot, he engaged the audience well. Marvin is a great, vigorous, intelligent speaker who has dug way deeper than most of us who are lighter brown (commonly mislabeled as white) Ephraimites. He talks about the idioms in one language which if you don't understand it in the other language, you don't see what was really meant, and he gives great substance and proof for it; clearly an experience in better scripture study.  So I really recommend this DVD.",1413158400,,677,4.9298245614035086
8262717,5,B0016JHZ52,"The message contained in this presentation is essential to the worlds understanding on the doctrine of race in the Scriptures. These Brothers are bringing to pass the work of the Lord. By the end of this thorough presentation you will find, the only thing difficult about answering questions about race and curses in the scriptures is being bold enough to stand firm on the word of god. This presentation offers and up front sound doctrinal approach by letting the scriptures do the talking. This is a must for anyone concerned about the truth. Is god a respecter of persons? Don't expect these Brothers to step lightly on this issue. Recommended for all who  desire to know about this issue. This DVD is divinely inspired.",1219190400,9,723,4.830645161290323
