8179666,5,B000NNUWRA,"I grew up in La Paz Baja California and traveled a couple of times back and forth with my parents and siblings DRIVING form San Francisco CA to La Paz a few Decembers.
I was very excited to see a lot of the towns, the scenery and the beaches from my childhood. I will have to go back to San francisco de la Sierra.  I had heard about the paintings.

Movie is good as well.  So even if I wasn't from baja, I would have found this movie very entertaining.

8179667,5,B000NNUWRA,"This movie was recommended to me because I love Baja California and its rock art. It turned out to be harder than expected to get a copy, because at the time it was not released on DVD. Finally I found someone who had copied a VHS version off cable TV years ago. Wow! A really intriguing and unusual movie that also showcased the beauty of Baja and its interesting rock art. I'm so happy to see it's finally available on DVD! I hope you give it a chance.",1220745600,3,454,4.170454545454546
8179668,5,B000NNUWRA,"This is an outstanding little Mexican film from 1998 that helped usher in the New Mexican Cinema movement the following year.  It's an art house film to be sure, but unlike any other I can remember, as it's part travelogue, part nature documentary, and part simple humanist drama that scores high marks in all three of those regards.  I have spent years at a time living in central Mexico, and for me it captures the feel of really being there.  And while I've only traveled through the tip of Baja (lower) California, I felt like I knew the place intimately after viewing this film.  Damian Alcazar is an actor whose skill towers over his moderate physical stature, and here he gives one of his two best performances as a Chicano artist from L.A. on a trip to find his roots and cleanse a demon from his conscience.  Jesus Ochoa, one of the top actors of the new Mexican cinema, gives another steady and interesting performance here.  You might recognize the actress who plays Alcazar's wife as Gertrudis from Como Agua Para Chocolate (in physical form only, her Anglo words are voiced over by an American).

Despite what others say, there are no subtitles on this disk in either English or Spanish.  That might be curious to some, as important parts of the film occur in both languages, so if you don't speak both you won't totally get it.  Perhaps that's what director Carlos Bolado had in mind.  He sets most of his (few!) films in the Baja/San Diego area, where real life tends to pass by in those two languages.  That said, the film is largely visual and you could get most of it's meaning even if you only spoke Chinese.

This import disc is region 1 AND 4, meaning it plays just fine on US/Canadian or Latin American DVD players (I own it).  It has no extras to speak of and is unfortunately only available in full screen (but still very worth buying just as it is).  It was retailing in Mexico for about ten buck when I was last there, but it's not real easy to find if you don't know your way around.",1190246400,5,2010,4.456284153005464
8179669,5,B000NNUWRA,"This is a very interesting and intriguing movie set in Baja California , Mexico. The story evolves around a young artist who inadvertently is involved in an accident in which he kills a pregnant mother who is trying to make her way to the United States. The protagonist thus is guilt ridden(it was a hit and run)and sets out on a journey into Baja California where he encounters many strange situations that are analogous to his doing penance. He meets several people along the way as he rediscovers his homeland. The movie is extremely appealing to the eye as the landscapes of Baja California lend themselves to the artistic vision of the artist searching for his roots. The movie is captivating, partially because of the sheer beauty of landscape, the juxtaposition of the arid desert and crystal clear ocean waters, coupled with a minimum of dialogue places the viewer directly into the mind of the artist. He finds some  answers to his questions along the way and in the end his quest is a discovery of self. I especially liked this movie because of the proximity of the location as I have travelled many of the same roads and viewed  the same vistas in the movie. It is a penetrating , powerful, psychological exploration of an artist in search of life's answers. It is in Spanish with subtitles and definitely worth your times if you like foreign movies from Mexico.",1174953600,7,1373,4.716666666666667
