2251410,5,B0007YD27W,It is great that this old classic is available on Amazon Instant Video. I was able for the first time in many years to see the film as it was originally presented in its theatrical release as a early 60s TV movie. The acting is excellent: a real entertaining film.,1418860800,,264,4.3

2251413,5,B0007YD27W,"If David should have a heart after God, and Saul should be obsessed with killing David after the spirit of The Lord left him, and Jonathan and David should love each other like brothers.... And you want it all to draw you in and be really really real , then this is your movie. The portrayal of David's love for The Lord alone is enough for me to recommend this version.",1390608000,2,370,4.225352112676056
2251414,5,B0007YD27W,An older version of DAVID & SAUL.  The constant bewilderment and strange mental anguish between the king of Israel and soul searching he congers within his right-hand cohert.,1365033600,,174,5.214285714285714
2251415,4,B0007YD27W,again i cant say enough the love of the lord is very much shown by david ring as well as his love of Jesus Christ,1362441600,,113,3.56
2251416,5,B0007YD27W,"David Ring is a handicapped individual but his story and testimony is relevant for all of us, especially those of us who are not facing those kind of difficulties.",1361404800,,163,4.655172413793103
2251417,5,B0007YD27W,"My sister bought the DVD recently and invited me over to watch it a few nights ago when I had some things going on in my life that were difficult to face.

This video is captivating and will keep you glued to every word that David Ring says.  He explains how he lost his father and later his beloved mother at a young age while also suffering from painful teasing by schoolmates at the bus stop, school hallways, classrooms, etc.  He was born with Cerebral Palsy and his mother loved him just the way he was, but after she died, he became extremely depressed and lost hope and didn't want to face his problems or go to school.  His sister helped him while others in his family resolved that he would never achieve too much in his life because of his severe handicaps including grimacing of his face, talking ""funny"", shaky movements, problems with his hands and legs, etc..  Later, he came to know Jesus Christ and then got to know what it meant to become a ""CHAMPION IN THE GAME OF LIFE"". He became an evangelist and motivational speaker and tells about God's gifts to him including a beautiful ""knock-out"" wife and 4 healthy smart children in spite of people telling him that he would never marry or have a career or family.

Along the way of telling you about himself, David asks you, I have Cerebral Palsy, Now What's YOUR Problem?""  This video will motivate you to take a second look at what God has given you.  David will inspire you to see that God did not say ""OOPS"" when he created you.  He knew you before you were born.  He has a plan for you.  This video will help you shed your old skin and along the way of listening to David, begin to see your life in a new light and refresh your relationship with God.  If you need a lift because life is getting you down, watch this video.",1218240000,5,1790,4.326347305389222

8053981,5,B0007YD27W,"Probably the most accurate movie on David before he was made King. True there were a few dramatic licenses close to the end, but it was an amazing portrayal of David. What made me grin was having Donald Pleasance as Nabal which was perfect.",1456358400,,240,4.4772727272727275
