2306613,4,B0009NZ6P2,"John Cleese's ""Wine for the Confused"" is an excellent DVD for the novice wine person like me.  Wine-wise, I have the mixed blessing of living in Portland, Oregon, which is a short drive from dozens of excellent assorted Willamette Valley vineyards.  Which means that I am able to try a lot of good wine, but also that I have to deal with a lot of wine snobs.

John Cleese's DVD will surely help me with the more enjoyable task of figuring out just what wine I like and how to explain it.  Essentially, Cleese brings his considerable wit and star power to bear in de-mystifying the process.  When John Cleese says, ""Just use your own words to describe the wine, and tell me what you like and don't like,"" everyone has to listen.  (It's a shame that Cleese doesn't have a companion DVD entitled, ""John Cleese -- Taking Wine Snobs Down a Peg or Two."")

Cleese puts his advice into action by hosting a wine tasting at his house and also visiting a few wineries.  At the wine party, he proves how challenging (and silly) (and fun) wine can be, he asks his guests to price several bottles (ranging from $5 to $200) based on taste alone.  It's comforting to know that his guests (including a near-drunken Brendan Fraser) are as likely to properly identify the $200 bottle as they are to guess that it's worth $5.

But it's also interesting that while Cleese's guests are having a good time at his party, several of them get hesitant when he asks them to give their opinions about the wine they are drinking.  This serves as confirmation that we need more wine education like this -- even in the comforting environment of a casual wine tasting, you can tell that Cleese's friends, like most of us, are afraid they might come across as ""unsophisticated"" or even worse, a ""beer drinker.""

Cleese's quick walk-through six different types of wine is also helpful, and one wishes that he could have explored a few more.  He focuses on three whites (Chardonnay, Riesling, and Sauvignon Blanc) and three reds (Merlot, Pinot Noir, and Cabernet Sauvignon).  Again, while I wish he had chosen an even wider range, this section is an excellent primer.

One thing Cleese is not able to do is to take the pretension out of the wine people that he's talking to.  They don't come across as obnoxious French types, but it's still pretty clear that if these folks weren't talking to a star like John Cleese, they might not be so tolerant of his rudimentary questions.  While pleasant folks, they are also the types of people who wax poetic because a certain vineyard's ""terroir"" (a word Cleese helpfully defines) includes nearby eucalyptus trees.  One thing I've learned living in wine country, wine fans who profess to taste the influence of nearby foliage are generally the folks with whom you don't want to discuss wine.

Tips on buying wine are also helpful because Cleese points out some of the gimmicks in the trade, from the snobby waiter to the layout at your wine store, and how you can use them to spot some real values.

This DVD only gets four stars because it stops so soon.  Chock full of helpful hints and basic elementary knowledge, this DVD leaves you wishing that this was the first in a long series.  And that's not a bad thing.  I'm just not sure this isn't a more suitable candidate for a rental than for a permanent slot in the film library.",1138752000,24,3338,4.582491582491582
2306614,5,B0009NZ6P2,"The world of wine is a very broad subject that can often be intimidating, but on this show John Cleese does a fabulous job of putting you perfectly at ease, by being a warm and gracious host. He breaks down the subject of wine perfectly by posing just the right questions to the wine experts he interviews throughout the show and does so with a confident and witty attitude. This is the perfect way to introduce yourself or someone you know to the world of wine.

The DVD includes:

* `Wine for the Confused' (45 minutes): This is the original television documentary that aired on the `Food Network.'

Red Grapes Covered: Pinot Noir, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.

White Grapes Covered: Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay.

* `Extended Conversations with Wine Experts' (45 minutes): John Cleese offers additional tips and advice on wine in a short segment. The rest of this section contains portions of interviews John Cleese did with several wine experts that were cut out of the original television documentary because of time constraints.

NOTE: The information given on this DVD is very basic, which is why it is called `Wine for the Confused' (it was meant for people who don't know anything about wine). The information given was not meant to turn you into a Master Sommelier! It was meant to teach you the basics and do it an enjoyable and un-intimidating way, which John Cleese does perfectly!

GOOD SHOW! BRAVO!",1136505600,15,1427,4.847736625514403
2306615,5,B0009NZ6P2,"We saw this delightful documentary once and then came up with an inspired idea. The show goes over many things wine, but is primarily structured by exploring  the 6 ""great grapes"" that are made into the wines we all know and love, one at a time. We went down to Cost Plus and Bev Mo and bought a bottle of each type of wine, invited the a few couples over for a surprise and as John presents each type of wine, we opened the bottle and poured them a glass. It went over tremendously well (but remember to provide a receptacle for pouring unwanted wines out!).

The show is witty without being over the top in any way, very informative while being laid back and charming. If you have any interest in wine, this is a GREAT place to start.",1133913600,14,736,4.25
2306616,5,B0009NZ6P2,"Snobbery abounds in the wine world.  Proof of this is hereby demonstrated on this video with Cleese's winetasting party where he has maybe twenty guests vote on which is the cheap bottle vs. the expensive bottle of same grapetype. There wasn't a clear majority who could identify not knowing the label, price.

So, whole point of this well done work on wine is find what you like to drink and don't let anyone convince you otherwise.  This is important, since there is so much namedropping in wine drinking world.  Buy and drink what you like, and try new things, as Cleese demonstrates with his own wine drinking ventures into new realms never explored by his palate before.

It is well done, with basics covered with hands on shots and interviews.  Not an overdo of his humor [which is monumentally good] but very warm and inviting format and hosting on his part.

I tremendously enjoyed this, especially the discussion about the terrario (spelling?), the whole envioronmental scene where grapes on grown, which solidified much of wine discussion for me in a great way.

I believe this will be enjoyable and valuable resource for all levels.",1128297600,41,1143,4.855670103092783
2306617,2,B0009NZ6P2,I ordered this because I'm a huge John Cleese fan (Fawlty Towers is the best sit-com ever!) and I'm a wine fan as well.  It was just toooo basic for me or anyone who knows anything about wine - and who else would buy it???,1126224000,6,222,3.933333333333333
2306618,4,B0009NZ6P2,This is a great primer for all you beginning wine buffs out there. I think John Cleese does a great jod of keeping an intimidating subject lower key and very modest. Look for the great reaction when he doesn't realize the power of fermentation and he puts his head into the vat!!! The bottom line: he is trying to prove that wine doesnt have to be intimidating and scary!!! Good show and I reccomend it to all.,1120003200,39,410,4.337662337662338
2306629,5,B0009NZ6P2,"Used and recommended by Howard Spiegleman in his wine classes at the local Comm. college. Great CD to use at a wine tasting party - all you need is big screen TV, comfy couches, friends, snacks, notepads, large glasses for swirling and WINE. Suggestion: Pair up to share the expense of a choice vintage. Do a blind tasting first and take notes. Remove the bags and taste again. Try a blindfold test and sip red and white side by side - see if you can tell the difference. (This test has fooled many an expert). Guaranteed fun!",1428796800,,526,4.43298969072165

2306631,5,B0009NZ6P2,"Nothing ""confusing"" about this instructional DVD, its spot on!  Since I teach Wine Appreciation and Beverage Management, I am always on the look out for good instructional videos on wine.  I had seen a clip from the DVD on-line, so I ordered John Cleese's ""Wine for the Confused.""  Its fun, filled with great information about wine, and serves as a great introduction.

But the production quality was no very professional.

good education... John Cleese is so fun and relaxed.... just a kinda cheap production.",1376784000,,173,4.9655172413793105
2306638,3,B0009NZ6P2,I was disappointed because it was so very rarely funny.  It should not be marketed as humorous.  It would be false.,1376006400,,115,4.428571428571429
2306649,4,B0009NZ6P2,"This is vintage Cleese; he is right on form and hilarious.  But it is about wine; his comments are funny and easy to remember, not like the droning of innumerable Wine Pontificrats who make your eyes glaze over.  I expected him to come out with a wine label pasted to his forehead, like he did with the Post-It note in the management training film.  But you can't have everything.  This is a good way to have some fun, and learn some fundamental things about the wine business that you will remember.",1371340800,,500,4.461538461538462
2306650,3,B0009NZ6P2,"I liked it because I love wine & documentaries. However for informational purposes there are better titles out there. Titles that have much more information & are better guides for those wanting to learn about wine or barely starting to get into wine. Such as  ""Wine for Dummies"", ""An introductory guide to Wine"", ""Wine Basics"" to name a few. Its an enjoyable watch if you like john cleese or those mini documentaries done in food network or travel channel fashion. I find it a bit outdated. I still enjoyed it (trying to be nice here) but not as much as I did the others. As far as learning more about wine. I feel I learned more from other dvd's & books. You will learn if you know nothing about wine but nothing in depth. I feel they explained the process of making wine just fine. Once again this is not for everybody & I found better, more enjoyable & informational DVDS and books for my money.",1368403200,,899,4.4156626506024095

2306654,5,B0009NZ6P2,"I was a little surprised at how informative the video was!  I had expected a tongue-in-cheek look at wine, but really learned a lot!  He is serious, curious, adventurous, and informative, but also humorous.  It was great.  The best part was watching his wine party at the end of the video - all the movie and tv stars tasting wine and trying to be ""wine snobs"" - it was great!",1335744000,,376,4.328571428571428
2306655,4,B0009NZ6P2,"I watched this short film with my wife and we are definitely not wine-confused. It is our drink of choice, and we try to learn as much as we can about it, and we try to visit wineries in all our travels. Having said that, this little film was great.
We enjoyed John Cleese's dry humor and fun-way of explaining the basics. He does pick three red and three white varieties to discuss in detail. These varieties are geared towards the American market, as this is clearly the target audience.
We also enjoyed the little blind test experiments.
Overall, very entertaining whether you are confused or not. Grab a glass and enjoy!",1304553600,,624,4.580357142857143

2306657,1,B0009NZ6P2,"John Cleese is obviously a funny man and great actor, but this video is truly a low quality, badly filmed home movie that should've never hit commercial distribution. I was shocked to see how bad the actual quality of the video is, so much so that it made me giggle. The camera is shaky... the light and sound are terrible, but these are just ""superficial"" aspects and I'm no movie director anyway.
So let me tell you what I think about the content. I am not a wine-expert by any means and even I could've done a better job just from my ""experience"" as a ""wine-drinker""! The information provided is very biased, approximated, and lacks substance. I don't think it's even worth renting this movie... I don't like writing such bad reviews, but I'm just being honest. It's clear that Mr. Cleese has a passion for wine, but he should've kept this passion at home.
Instead, if you really want to learn the basics about wine, try renting or purchasing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wine-for-Dummies/dp/B000EQ5PSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wine for Dummies</a>, their video is packed with easy to follow information that is actually reliable.",1227398400,3,1181,5.287234042553192
2306658,5,B0009NZ6P2,"John Cleese gives a no-nonsense look at enjoying all kinds of wine.  You don't have to get involved in all the potential descriptors and aspects of wine.  Experimentation is the key, like most everything.  Moderation is the mode of the day.  You enjoy what you enjoy ... plain and simple.  John shows you don't have to buy the expensive wines to find something that agrees with your palate.",1215907200,,390,4.676470588235294
2306669,4,B0009NZ6P2,"fun to watch--more fun than informative, although I did learn some things about wine culture.
One CAN have fun and learn at the same time.",1189123200,,138,4.56
2306670,4,B0009NZ6P2,"I really enjoyed this...John Cleese is warm and funny, but actually interested in this subject and conveys it well. This is NOT some sort of ""sommelier course"" in wine, it is directed toward those with basic knowledge who want to learn a little more. People expecting some sort of advanced info be warned. Cleese picks a few common types of wine and visits local (to him) California vineyards to learn about the production process, and a little more about each type of wine. Some basic info about serving wine, ordering wine in restaurants, etc., is included...along with John's mantra, ""Drink what you like!""

It's altogether un-snobby and enjoyable. My only complaint is that it's too brief. I would like to see Cleese host some sort of ongoing wine series on the Food channel. I really love his style.

Regarding the preview of the movie at the beginning...I don't know what the other reviewer was referring to when mentioning a preview with ""lots of nudity""...that certainly wasn't on the dvd I watched. What was there was a preview for a foreign film which had some sexual innuendo. Nothing too offensive, and certainly not worth giving this dvd a bad review!",1186012800,4,1164,4.844221105527638

This video has a five minute cheesy preview for another movie, and in their preview lots of nudity is shown. My parents would NOT have been amused. It was so bad I thought that I might have gotten a mis-labeled DVD. But not, the John Cleese part eventually showed up.
John Cleese's standard humor you have known from his movies is lacking, the party at his house looks totally scripted, the interviews are stiff and do not flow, etc. Anyone want to buy my copy...?",1184371200,,626,4.313559322033898
2306672,2,B0009NZ6P2,"The John Cleese name made me think this would be witty and informative.  It was neither.  He does make one good point - that people often are intimidated into feeling they ""should"" like something expensive, which needn't be the case.  If you need convincing on that point then buy & watch, otherwise save your money.",1175299200,2,316,4.709090909090909
2306673,5,B0009NZ6P2,"For those that love John Cleese, you will be twice pleased, as this is also a serious  hour of fun education on wines.

2306674,4,B0009NZ6P2,"Wine for the Confused with John Cleese is a very informative video.  The information is very basic and useful.  It doesn't go too far into detail to the point where the audience is lost and confused, helping them loosen up about the topic of wine and accepting the art of winemaking and drinking.  Cleese gives tips about how wine is made, how to describe wine and decide which wine is good, how wine is priced and the proper way to drink wine.  For example, he goes to several different vineyards and discusses the variations between Riesling, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Noir, Merlot, and Cabernet Sauvignon, which are the six main types of grapes that wine is made from, three red and three white, which happen to be the most important factor in the taste and presentation of wine.  He also enlightens the audience about how different lengths and forms of fermentation produce unique tastes.  Cleese then goes on to give details on how the taste of wine can then be described using words such as light, heavy, sweet, dry, fruity, spicy, crisp, and fresh.  Everything is concise and descriptive, helping you to follow the video easily and effectively.  It is a very appealing video because the study of wine and winemaking is an actual interest of John Cleese, therefore making the documentation more intriguing and attention-grabbing.  Cleese also provides humor throughout the video with his foolish jokes that are so silly they are funny.  A few times the video cuts off randomly and picks up at different settings, but it's all because of editing and such and, in my opinion, absolutely does not take away from the abundance of information.  Overall, the video is a very cheesy, but good, one which I strongly recommend to anyone who wants to know the basic information behind winemaking, tastes associated with wine, and the pricing of wine. It is full of a good amount of useful information that is easy to absorb and remember without overdoing it to the point of confusion and boredom.  It's short and simple to the point with a host who has a great personality and funny sense of humor.  Watch this movie and you will learn oodles of information about wine that you never even knew existed and remember: ""Don't let anyone tell you which wine you should like,"" one of Cleese's favorite mottos.

Wine-makers in the Santa Barbara region talk to Cleese about the characteristics of their wines including Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, and Riesling. Cleese also talks to others in the wine business about prices (""would you like an expensive wine better than an inexpensive one?""). In blind wine-tasting tests with friends he shows that liking a wine has nothing to do with the price and that people cannot necessarily differentiate a white from a red wine by taste alone.

The original clip included a segment in which Cleese challenges guests to identify and rate wine tasted room temperature from plain sippy cups.  Most couldn't tell whether they were consuming red wine or white, let alone a bottle that cost $ 5 or $ 50.  I suspect the scene was deleted for DVD production when one of the guests, who had at the time or who has subsequently gained a reputation among the wine cognoscenti.
