6230337,5,B00HW3EXCE,"This is such a great show! I watched all season one episodes in about three days. The characters are so interesting and the show does a great job of developing each one. I love how the show goes back in time to allow the audience to learn about each prisoner's past. I know this show is on Netflix but I definitely wanted to have my own copy, especially with the extras included on the DVD. I highly recommend this series!",1397088000,5,422,4.2875
6230338,5,B00HW3EXCE,"Love the title. Black is suppose to be the safe choice for any occasion but when you are in prison orange is what you sport.
The show does give some insight about officer/inmate relations do's and don'ts, they things that can happen to inmates, what they do to each other and what gets done to them, the fear, the sadness, the inequality, the aspect does this system even work - NO!

it is a serious but overwhelmingly hilarious show!
This can start talks about what is crime, what is an appropriate punishment, what happens if you are in prison for a year can your spouse have other partners? Can you ( although any sex in prison is rape so you're not suppose to have sex)

Very original.",1395446400,3,689,4.417322834645669

6230341,5,B00HW3EXCE,"When a fan loses a beloved TV show, it happens one of two ways: one, when its not the right time for it to end, and everything feels kind of rushed. In this way, a fans breakup with a show can feel bitter and resentful. But when a show has run past its prime, yet came back with a brilliant final season, the way Jenji Kohans Weeds did, in 2012, the fan isn't left bitter and angry. We saw these characters, whom weve loved and hated throughout the years, come to a conclusion that was bittersweet, but felt right. I feel like series creator Jenji Kohan felt a void in her heart after Weeds ended. But like any other working person, she needed a new project.

Kohan has talked about how when season seven of Weeds was starting, she wanted to do a women-in-prison season, but decided against it because it would break up the family dynamic that the show had for the previous six seasons. Season 7 of Weeds was probably the lowest point, creatively, of the entire series. But when the show was awarded a surprise eighth season, she didn't let fans down.

In the back of her mind, Kohan was already conceptualizing Orange is the New Black, a series based on the best-selling memoir by Piper Kerman. Since Jenji left me with a brilliant final season of Weeds, I vowed to follow whatever she wrote in the future. I expected Orange to more or less be Kohans rebound project from Weeds, if you will. I expected the feeling for this to still feel like Weeds, but be a little different.

Jeez, was I wrong.

Orange is the New Black is such a silly title for such a serious and affecting show. We follow Piper Chapman (a different name than the memoirist, for reasons that well get to later), a WASP-y and successful Manhattanite who was a wild child in her glory days. She worked alongside her then-lesbian lover Alex Vause (Laura Prepon), who worked for an international drug cartel. Ten years later, the statute of limitations for her crime is almost over (12 years), and shed long forgotten about the whole thing. She and her fianc get a knock on the door one day, telling her that everyone in the cartel has gone down. She can either go to trial, or surrender to 15 months in federal prison.

Each character who she meets on the inside has her own superbly written backstory. Every one of them is flawed and complicated. The show is less about Pipers existential journey while behind bars, and more about the fascinating people, good and bad, who she meets there. There are so many fantastically written female characters in this one show, that even I was caught a little off guard.

Standouts of the supporting cast include Kate Mulgrew, as the inmate who runs the kitchen, nicknamed Red. Her backstory is probably the most interesting, since she has obvious mafia connections, but its not completely drawn out as to how she wound up behind bars. Mulgrew is fantastic in this part, as a vicious, tough-as-nails broad who is really vulnerable and human at the same time. Also, Laura Prepon is excellent as Alex, who becomes an ally to Piper, even as shes the reason that she wound up behind bars.

Also, Natasha Lyonne, of the American Pie series, is superb comic relief as Nicky, who is the one character whos automatically likable. Laverne Cox plays male-female transgender inmate Sophia, who is one of the best characters in the series. Sophias the subject to a lot of inhumane treatment, when she is denied medications that might slowly erase all of the work shes done to become a woman. Even characters who seem like they're not that pivotal to the story are. In each episode, we explore a different characters backstory, and they're all vastly different, and superbly fascinating.

Another thing I admire about Kohans approach is that shes not scared to show the ugly side of prison. Corrupt guards and sketchy prison counselors rule with an iron fist, and every inmate is in a gang  tribal stuff  the blacks, the whites, the Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, old people, teenagers, what have you. Theres a mother and a daughter, both there for different crimes. And a prison guard is carrying on an affair with an inmate, which is surprisingly one of the happiest subplots in the whole show. Its surprising that this is really how it is in a federal prison.

In one excellent episode, we explore how different life is in solitary confinement, versus minimum security prison. In SHU (short for special housing unit) a person is treated like an animal. Theyre quite literally in a box, with a metal toilet and a cot, where they are completely cut off from other people. Theyre fed a loaf of tasteless food, which has enough nutritional value to keep someone alive, but is completely disgusting. I did some research on my own about how accurate this is, and shockingly, its all true. SHU is very real, and its horrific.

One reason why this show really does work is because of Taylor Schilling. In an actress whose work Id never seen, I wasn't expecting much. But Schilling is a dynamic actress and brings a great deal of depth to the character of Piper Chapman. Shes so unlikable at one point, and were rooting for her in others. I don't really like the relationship with her fiance Larry (Jason Biggs), but Schilling never lets the viewer forget that theres more than meets the eye. Also, theres a reason why the characters name is Piper Chapman, rather than the real-life Piper Kerman. These are two different stories. Chapman and Kerman are not the same woman. This allows Kohan and Schilling to create subplots and other story elements that may not have happened to the real woman. This is no docudrama.

In 13 hour-long episodes, Jenji Kohan creates a vast new world and a slew of extraordinarily interesting characters. I had read the book, by Piper Kerman, before watching the series. If this had been a straight adaptation of the novel, it would have been over by episode 13. The series probably covered three months of time in its first season, so clearly this show could run for a while, even with the obvious endgame. If it continues to be this good, it should go on for as long as possible.

I was very surprised at how dark Orange got in its later episodes. Because of this, the show only becomes more compelling, the longer it goes on. With a Netflix subscription, viewers have the option to watch each episode in a row. I tried to make Orange last as long as I could, because I truly enjoyed being around these characters. Each episode was more interesting than the last, and it truly ended with a bang. I cant wait to see where it goes.",1393200000,25,6543,4.609965635738831

6230541,1,B00HW3EXCE,"Entertainment media continues to push secular progressivism, relentlessly, and this show follows the same stale pattern. Our protagonists are the lesbian couple who wind up in jail for smuggling heroin. They are the voice of common sense and reason, as are many other criminals (including murderers), who are portrayed in sympathetic light. That is, until we get to the ""Christian"" gang. They are are the only group portrayed as crazy, misguided drug addicts with rotten teeth. I'm not kidding..the ""Christians"" ALL have rotten teeth (they are apparently the only group with hideous dental issues), and are put in their places with admonishments from our heroins who curtly explain to them why they're so stupid.. The writers paint them as slack-jawed inbreds from flyover country-the Hollywood norm reserved exclusively for those of us of the Christian faith. Is anyone else getting bored with the decades long attack on Christian faith from Hollywood (not to mention pop culture in general, our education system, mainstream media, etc. It really is creepy they way they seem motivated to stamp out the religion our nation was founded on, while every other religion is supposed to be accepted, and made allowances for. The message is clear: Every other faith/sexual orientation is to be revered, but Christianity is for ""science denying"" morons. I'm old enough to see through this low pattern, but we are all impressionable to a degree, especially the young. Hey Hollywood: I'm a successful, educated consumer that happens to be Christian, and I tend to not support this type of insulting, overtly anti-Christian propaganda (or its advertising sponsors) with my disposable income. Intelligent viewers are insulted by your sophomoric thought policing.",1495756800,3,1751,5.324909747292419

OITNB is everything it is advertised to be.  I really looked forward to each new season.  Piper and her story keep you coming back for more.  It is not too violent, and defiantly puts a funny spin on being in prison with all the drama between the women.  Obviously, the show is for adults with all of the language and sexual situations.

A show like this wouldn't have existed a few years back but now with the general recent acceptance of these things the show now feels comfortable to portray all these different characters.

6230609,5,B00HW3EXCE,"Everyone loves drama, i mean who doesn't love drama. If you're searching for a show that you can binge watch, Orange is the New Black is the way to go. There are conflicts left and right and nothing is ever boring.
 Orange is the New Black is a netflix original show about a woman named Piper Chapman who is sentenced to 15 months is an all womens prison for drug smuggling with her ex girlfriend, Alex Vause. The show consists of flash backs of other inmates on how they ended up in prison, racist drama, and sexual relationships. Although this may sound like serious things, the creators added a bit of comedy throughout the show while keeping is serious because part of this show is based on real life events. There is drug smuggling between guards and inmates and that is pretty funny.
 I loved the show. There was a lot of drama that it was hard to keep up with sometimes and i found that as a good thing. I think that separating the whites from the blacks from the hispanics was a very interesting thing to have because it cause a lot of hate towards each other when she had to come together in the cafeteria. In addition to reflecting how different races behave in real life. Not everyone hated everyone, but, there was conflict between individuals. There were always cliff hangers and i loved that because i would binge watch all summer long. I am very excited for season 5. Unfortunatley netxlix isn't going to release the next reason until the summer of 2017 and they had to end the latest season with the biggest cliff hanger they've ever thought of! Im very excited for the seasons to come. This has to be one of the best shows i have ever watched.
 In conclusion, i would give OITNB a 10 out of 10 and i highly recommend watching this show. Its popular on netflix and is rated 5 stars and i totally agree that it deserves every great review its ever gotten. Give the show a chance, you won't regret it.",1479254400,,1915,4.403954802259887

6230791,1,B00HW3EXCE,"This show is absolute filth and the only statement that can be made about it - and the fact that it lasted past the first season when many far, far better shows have been and continue to be canceled mid-season - is that people apparently enjoy disgusting, vile and downright perverse scenes that pander to the lowest form of what obviously passes for ""entertainment"" these days. And it's not even interesting enough to put up with the rampant, trashy dreck in the first place.

If you enjoy watching things like a muffin served with a used, soaked tampon, this is right up your alley - but if your standards fall slightly outside of the gutter, give this a wide berth. DISGUSTING.",1466985600,8,680,4.619834710743802

6230827,3,B00HW3EXCE,"Jenji Kohan is a brilliant writer, though Weeds is still her better show. Because of her talent for storytelling and engaging (often hilarious) dialogue, it is easy to superficially call OINTB ""good, mindless, light entertainment."" It is anything but light. Wrapped in the guise of humor and woven with the humanity of each of the characters' backstory is an accurate and scathing commentary on two main themes: 1) the prison system in the U.S. is a horrendous atrocity, and this features only ""minimum security"" and 2) the judicial system in general is in egregious disrepair.

I said, ""Huh?"" and ordered up the first season. Wowzarooney, as we say in the biz. Aside from the offensive blandness of the human-zero main character -- and her repulsive walking cliche of an upper middle-class boyfriend, played by Jason Biggs, there's a lot of great writing here.

After reading the book Orange is the New Black I was very reluctant to watch the series. The book is one of the worst things I've ever read -- narcissistic, self-congratulatory, obnoxious, unwilling to admit to any faults and utterly devoid of any insight. I bought a used copy just to throw it across the room I was so repulsed.

The series is ten times better. Intelligent, funny, humane and thoughtful. I was taken aback with delight at just how much the creators of the show managed to turn such poor source material into an amazing series. The whole thing is simply just about perfect in every way. Whereas other people are props for the author of the book, they are fully realized people in the series.

6231268,5,B00HW3EXCE,Started watching this series without knowing at all what it was about. It's continue to capture my attention since the very first episode which is very important to me when starting a new series. It's suspenseful enough to keep me wanting more and has a way of drawing you in. It's not for everyone with some of the nudity and lesbian scenes. If you don't mind that sort of thing then you should definitely give this one a go.,1452902400,,426,4.405063291139241

If your overly sensitive run while you still can lol!
  Orange is the New Black is a Netflix original brought to you by the director of the show Weeds, Jenji Kohan.  It is somewhat loosely based on the book of the same name by Piper Kerman.  They are quite different though.  I didn't like the book.  As some of you Weeds fans out there may know Jenji is a master at playfully raunchy, dark comedy, suspense.  (However that's not all she's capable of, she worked on the show Gilmore Girls)  The characters in both shows you grow to care about are far from perfect.  Some not trustworthy and so you have to dig deeper.  In Weeds it was the same.  Nancy Botwin was an entirely different person in the end. I expect these characters will be also,",1446595200,,1044,4.185929648241206

So far it is a funny, smart drama with a dose of tension - suspense would be too strong a word. I have not seen anything so disturbing that I can't watch. I'm not a prude but I have a hard time with some prison dramas. I loved SOA but had a hard time with the prison scenes. There are doses of sex and violence - but it has not been graphic so far. The lead character is endearing and believable. Some of the other characters are NOT quite as believable - but, then again, I've never been in a women's prison, so perhaps they aren't so far off. Either way, it's a fun ride that I recommend taking.",1440115200,,707,4.057142857142857

6232332,4,B00HW3EXCE,"Piper Chapman is bisexual. I don't think that word is ever said during the entire season, but thats what she is. Shes not straight nor a lesbian. Shes into girls and guys, or at least one of each; her fianc Larry and her girlfriend Alex. Its an important distinction because the theme of Orange revolves around sex and romance. Its a prison soap opera filled with constant drama. The analogy is high school because whats petty in the real world is serious enough to fight or kill someone for in prison. There are also plenty of laughs. Its the combination that entices as you find yourself coming back to follow not just the lives of Chapman and her two partners, but also her fellow inmates; one of which really is a fellow.

Why a man, albeit one who alters his body to be like a woman, is sent to a womens prison is never addressed, though the scenes sometimes cut from current time to backstory. Each episode focuses on one or two characters, and that does wonders to humanize them, but its not consistent. Certain people are covered more than once while others are completely overlooked. Also, the initial idea to end each episode with a wild cliffhanger is abandoned after only three. Soon a show that started-off great has settled into an inferior comfort zone. The drama is sometimes over-the-top and the comedy occasionally misses the mark; the Michael Jackson bit comes to mind; but the show is both zany and endearing on the whole.

My only problem with the show is the actress that plays Piper, and Piper, the real person themselves. They come off as insufferable and superior, much like the rich New Yorkers that I knew in college, who were blissfully unaware 99% of the rest of the world lived like they did. She tells the story from her perspective, making herself look like a legend while everyone else is a buffoon. I really doubt this is the real story we are getting here.

6233066,5,B00HW3EXCE,"I just finished watching the first season, and it was as good as my friends said it was.

I bought a whole lot of DVDs on Black Friday, and this is one of the rare shows that lived up to acclaim.

Piper Chapman/Taylor Schilling is bewitching.  Piper is ditzy, intelligent, strong and often selfish.  Best of all, she is no victim.  She is past rage and fear of the criminal trial, and she seems to accept the situation.

I love all the characters.  They are all so dynamic, with stories of their own.  The actresses invested fully.  None of them look like glamor queens in a jumpsuit, but worn out, tired, animated and sad.

The whole Tiffany ""Pennsatucky"" Doggett affair was just infuriating.  Religion is not her salvation, so much as a weapon, and she uses it to hurt and humiliate.  Doggett would not have tendered the kindness Chapman showed her, but because she is so sanctimonious and dogmatic, she doesn't realize for all her proselytizing, she is a nasty, vindictive mean-spirited person.

Not surprising Natalie ""Fig"" Figueroa, the bureaucrat, is incompetent, cold and lazy.  She could do a good job if she wanted to.  It is mesmerizing how much bias comes to play.

And Sam Healy is crazy to think there is true love between him and his wife.

I will miss Miss Claudette Pelage and Tricia Miller.",1424563200,,1307,4.637554585152839

6233139,1,B00HW3EXCE,"Very disappointed. I had high hopes because of all the ""Buzz"" around this show but the plot is predictable.  I couldn't watch more than 2 episodes. If you're into mild Lesbianism (or shocked by it) maybe you'll be interested or you've lived a sheltered life. Otherwise it's predictable and boring.",1424390400,6,297,4.94
6233140,5,B00HW3EXCE,"This is dramedy at its finest!!! I find Taylor Schilling very hot on this movie despite the dry hair, small tits and orange uniform and all thta. All the characters are very interesting, even Crazy Eyes is interesting. It's nice how each episode features a flashback of how the characters were before they were convicted and how they ended up there.

I couldn't stop laughing at times and at other points couldn't stop the tears. The best part of the show is how it switches from present-day prison to the previous lives of the characters, showing how each of them ended up there. The characters are easy to relate to and even though they have made bad decisions, you realize they are still people.

6233312,4,B00HW3EXCE,"I purchased this for my wife who likes these sort of series  I watch a couple of these episodes and to tell the truth, women in prison series is my sort of movie to watch.  It is not the language, nor the harshness, cruelty or stupidity of the guards.  Rather it is how long it takes for everything to happen and the fact that they go back and forth in time playing snippets of the inmates lives and why they are there.  I suppose I am more linear than others.  It is a good movie, if you can stay involved and much better than you usually find on TV.  My wife saw the first season in three evenings and is starting to ""talk"" me into getting a Netflix subscription.  Men beware.",1421020800,,678,4.129770992366412

Orange is the new Black is one of them.  Set in a woman's prison this is anything but a chick flick series.  Every woman has her own back story of the circumstances that have led her to this place and time.  Things are not always what sterotypes would have you beleive.

6233547,4,B00HW3EXCE,"An excellent series. While the physical conditions of women prisoners as shown are luxury class by the standards of my country, the tensions and complexities of relationships between prisoners, and of prisoners to prison officials is very familiar. While the presence of female staff in male prisons appears to contribute to prison sanity, the contribution of male staff in a woman's prison appears highly dubious.
The story line is the complex interplay of the rich characters to be found in a prison, as the 'News of the World' used to boast, 'All of human life is here'. But prison, designed by men for men, does not fit with the psyche of women. I strongly believe that the prison system for women is not a solution to anything. Women have needs and demands on their motherhood which cannot be met in the isolation of a prison. The imprisonment of women should be a very rare resource, there are other ways of reform and punishment, as proposed in the ""Bangkok Rules"". Women ARE different, and should not be treated as lesser men. In my experience of imprisoned women, behind every crime by women there is a man, and men are more skillful in wiggling out of the rigour of law.
Considered as entertainment, I consider the imprisonment of women too serious an issue to be subject of entertainment. By the second series the theme lags, Piper is no longer the centre of interest, and, to the detriment of the penal implications, the series loses its focus. Prison is not a stage for all the world.

There are so many truly shocking moments that keep you entertained week after week. While I'm not sure how completely realistic it is as I personally have never been or known anyone in jail but honestly who cares, it makes for really great TV.

It continues to surprise me how many of the prisoners had normal lives before they went to jail. All it takes is one bad mistake for them to screw up their entire lives. It's pretty sad how misguided some people are. You get to see their normal side as well as what happens when they get pushed to the edge.

Through all the craziness you begin to develop a certain appreciation for the characters. I can't wait to see how it all plays out and where else they can take the show.",1414195200,,866,4.372670807453416

6233874,4,B00HW3EXCE,"I bought this DVD on the recommendation of a friend and because I'd worked in a women's prison back in the day (late 80s) and I was curious to see how a 'mainstream' group would portray the experience.  As a drama built around 'the ragged edge' relationships I applaud.  Performances of most of the players are excellent and I single out Harney and McGrew with whom I am familiar from NYPD Blue and Voyager respectively.  In Harney's case his Detective Mike Roberts was perhaps a little better given the wider range allowed in that role, but McGrew was superlative here compared with her earlier effort as Captain Janeway.  And I also applaud the portrayal of the inmate released who wastes little time in getting herself re-committed when she discovers ""freedom"" ain't all it's cracked up to be when compared with the comforts of prison.  I saw a lot of that in my time (I was assistant records officer and my jobs included handling the paperwork for every admittance and release), and Orange/Black's handling of that issue was spot-on.  I'll grant that not every women's prison in the country is run the way 'mine' was, but I found it very hard to accept the idea of so many men being involved directly with women prisoners.  I guess that's what's called literary license but it stretches the suspension of disbelief too much to allow me to award five stars to this otherwise good drama.",1413763200,4,1389,4.714876033057851

6233990,5,B00HW3EXCE,"Despite what that idiot from Cracked.com says, Orange is the New Black is quality television, and Im going to give you four reasons why I feel that way.

1.  The Writing

The writing here feels like Weeds before season four-ish (makes sense, since they're both the brain children of Jenji Kohan).  The season finale of the second season of Weeds goes down as perhaps one of, if not the, best episode of television I have ever watched.
That being said, OITNB just completed its second season, were anxiously waiting on its third, and the writing is still sharper than ever (though, the whole Vee storyline was getting a bit tired, to be frank).

For example, in the next to last episode of season two, there is a major storm.  Now, we all know that major storms, particularly rain, almost always signify that something bad is about to happen, whether its in film, television, or a work of literature.  And we can usually predict what that something bad is.  Not here.
There are so many characters and so many interesting storylines that its hard to tell just who things are going to go down south for, and really, they're in prison - how much worse can life get?  (Pro tip: Much.)  Not many writers can make rain suspenseful anymore, but these do.

Even how they handle the seasons is to be commended.  The first season is more about Piper, because were seeing prison through her eyes.  We can branch out to explore the other characters in season two because prison is now Pipers home - its not all about her anymore.

2.  The Characters

It is rare that a show can have a mile-long cast of characters and yet make them so intrinsically different from one another.  Each character has been fleshed out with a unique personality and backstory - you know the writers take the time to make each character his or her own separate entity.  There are no phoned-in performances here, no cardboard cut-outs - its hard to pick a favorite because each character has his or her positives and negatives, and you still end up liking characters that are otherwise normally difficult to root for.

3.  The Stories

There are some shows, like most of the programs on AMC, that operate at a slow boil.  Some of us enjoy that, while it puts others off.  OITNB has a knack for making you think that you know everything thats going on, only to be slow-boiling it beneath you, so that you find out three, five, sometimes even ten episodes later that the person you thought you knew is a complete stranger.
And, on the opposite side of that coin, they also do a great job at solving the little mysteries right away, rather than dragging them out for an entire season to the point where no one cares anymore who ratted someone out to the other side.  We find out in that one episode, and were done.  Moving on.

Plus, its always refreshing to watch the flashback scenes, not just because we get to learn more about the characters weve come to know (and love?), but also because it breaks up the monotony of being in prison all the time by giving us an even balance.

4.  Book Promotion

This is genius.  We know from watching The Shawshank Redemption that prisons have libraries.  What better way to throw a quick pop culture reference into the mix just by putting a well-known book (like John Greens The Fault in Our Stars) into one of the prisoners hands?  They don't even have to talk about it.
Like when Reds reading Jonathan Troppers This is Where I Leave You.  No one mentions it, but we notice it and smile.  And its perfect product placement because we don't wonder how they got there.  Between the library and commissary, theres always a good explanation.",1411689600,,3640,4.547692307692308

Not so much in to the nudity, but then I feel that the relationships are very realistic of what women's prison is like...certainly nothing like the men's prison which is far more cage-like, and the violence must more intense.

6234280,5,B00HW3EXCE,"I don't watch a lot of TV and had no interest in getting hooked on a TV series.  However, the womens prison genre has always held a certain fascination for me from CAGED to PRISONER: CELL BLOCK H.  Knowing this, some friends showed me this series when I visited over a long weekend.  I was blown away and have since given the DVD to two people as gifts.  This is not the usual womens prison film.  This story of an affluent white girl going to prison (primarily for choosing bad companions who involved her in a drug scheme) is quite graphic and deals openly with lesbian sex and masturbation among the array of prison life issues.  I was very impressed by the quality of the writing and the great acting by a fearless New York-based cast.  It is not campy, but it is not without a heavy dose of irony, either.  Every episode gives one a lot to ponder.  Id recommend this show wholeheartedly to intelligent adults with a certain caveat: While this is not hardcore pornography, there is nudity and the sex scenes leave little to the imagination.  The language is extremely graphic.  This is not for the squeamish and it is definitely not for those young people under 18.  But I loved it.",1408492800,6,1186,4.465116279069767

Then watched it again with a friend a couple of weeks later.

Also has a setting that I can relate to--not as a prisoner, but as a former soldier.  Not really the same, but some of the same feeling of being cast in with a disparate set of characters in an insular community.

6234426,5,B00HW3EXCE,"Piper Chapman (portrayed by the lovely Taylor Schilling) is your typical girl next door.  She's built like a cheerleder, she's engaging, she's relatable, she's friendly, she's intelligent and (most of all) she's normal.  All of these attributes serve in her favor in the regular world.  Unfortunately, all of the above traits count against her in her new environment:  a federal prison.

Piper is (rightfully) convicted of being a drug mule and is given a light, 15 month sentence.  (While 15 months would seem an eternity for most of us in the ""real"" world, it's pretty modest compared to most prison sentences in state & federal prisons).  This is the story of how she adapts (or tries to?) to her new domain.  It's a place where the Corrections Officers frequently tend to be far more corrupt than the inmates.  And, of course, when it comes to the inmates, there's no shortage of colorful characters!

People who are expecting this to resemble one of those cheesy softcore porn women-behind-bars movies will likely be disappointed.  There is sporadic nudity, but not nearly as much as I was expecting.  Of course, given the unconventional women who are in this series, it's best that there is not an overwhelming amount of skin.  Let's just say that the lot of them are not to be confused with HOOTERS girls.  For those who are curious, Taylor Schilling is topless briefly  in the pilot episode as well as the final episode of Season 1.

One would think that a series about women-behind-bars would get dull.  After all, every day is Groundhog Day, right?  Well, not so much.  Each episode offers the ""backstory"" on one of the female inmates.  Some of the storylines are so far fetched & unrealistic that I can't help but believe that they were inspired by true events.  You just can't make this stuff up!  What I do know is that the author of the book (on which the series is based) did serve time in a federal pen.

If you're considering buying this series, I would encourage you to do so.  However, just be aware that it's a very raw & gritty series that is occasionally disturbing.  It's totally uncensored & they take full advantage of that.  So, with that in mind, if you're in the mood to fade to orange, put on your jumpsuit to join Piper & the girls!",1407456000,6,2262,4.634760705289673

This show is some sort of strange glamorization of prison life.

6234493,5,B00HW3EXCE,"NETFLIX has created a show that is fresh, exciting, heartwarming and heartbreaking with the most diverse and talented cast NOT seen on TV. ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK was only available to NETFLIX subscribers until it was released on DVD.
ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK is not your typical prison drama. This show delves into the hearts and soul of females in prison. Our hero is sexy Piper Chapman, a privileged white woman whose past as a drug runner finally caught up to her years after the fact. Although her sentence is relatively short, her world is turned upside down. Taylor Schilling shines as the ""princess"" flung into a dungeon of chaos and fear--yet there is sanity and comfort in this chaos. Her fianc&eacute; Larry (Jason Biggs) is willing to wait for her but things begin to turn sour as Chapman's former lover Alex (Laura Prepon) is also an inmate.
There is so much praise to give ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK. Jenji Kohan has created a show that destroys all the stereotypes of life in a prison for women. The show is based on the memoirs of Piper Kerman. We explore the lives of the prisoners and their back stories that sent them to jail. The prison guard and staff have stories and don't forget the family and friends who must cope with having a loved one in prison.
One heartbreaking and so real scene involves Larry on a radio show talking about how his life had changed having a fianc&eacute;e in prison. He relates stories that Piper has told him about the inmates as we seen scenes of this very women listening to broadcast. Few are happy hearing how they were initially seen in the eyes of Chapman. It's a very moving and powerful scene that shows how deeply involved this show is with its characters.  Pipers character grows from a seemingly sweet lady who made one big  mistake to one who realizes she has created a mess of her life as she shattered the lives of others.
The writing is amazing as the tagline says ""Every sentence is a story."" Every word has meaning and every character fills the screen. Here is one of the most talented and diverse casts ever assembled. No one is in the background in this show. Every character is one piece in the puzzle and there are too many stand-outs to even begin to mention. It's good to see talented Kate Mulgrew again. Uzo Aduba, a lovely lady in real life, has transformed herself into ""Crazy Eyes."" ""THAT 70's SHOW"" Laura Prepon has transformed her good girl imagine in to a tough, beautiful drug queen still in love with Piper. Every character has a story and every story has a character. Despite the hardship there is love and compassion in prison. There is a warm story of a guard who falls in love with a prisoner and love stories between prisoners. This show has it all.

6234529,4,B00HW3EXCE,"There are two types of TV series.

First one probably financed by the Tobacco and Alcohol lobbies to promote their products (the mediocre, highly hyped, vacuous Mad Men is one example).

The second series concentrates nothing but the drama and turn out to be of high quality (House of Cards).

Orange is the new black belongs to the latter category.  I was hesitant to buy the blu ray apprehending an excruciating prison break for women kind of experience.

Surprisingly there is almost no violence, of course putting aside the sexual explicit scenes which can be crude and shocking.

Each episode in interesting which is very rare.  Strangely I found the second role acting was better than the lead role.  Crazy Eyes, Doggett, Burset, Diaz and even Chang has some presence  to cite some.

And that voice of Morello is something to remember.

Hope they keep the light mood in the second season.  It would be a shame to turn this series  into a depressing one.",1406419200,,959,4.739393939393939

People mentioning The Wire are misleading the purpose of OITNB. This show is not The Wire and it is not trying to be The Wire. The Wire was fantastic just as OITNB is fantastic in its own right. This show is, first and foremost, about complex relationships between women (friendship and romantic), as well as what they did to end up behind bars, and their friends and family. It is humorous, emotional, and a wonderful character study into the lives of these fictitious people (since this is loosely based on reality) and their time spent at Litchfield. I must admit, I first thought, oh great, another women in prison tale so I approached OITNB with caution, not expecting much. 2 binge-worthy seasons later, I am so glad I pressed play. I am looking forward to many years spent at Litchfield with new inmates, new crazy stories and interactions, and more Alex and Piper!",1405555200,2,1062,4.87292817679558

6234668,5,B00HW3EXCE,"After 1 episode I find myself horrified at watching a woman out of place in prison, and yet I'm totally captivated by the show.

It's uncomfortable to watch, but at the same time it's very intriguing. It's not the prison life that's unsettling. I worked in prisons for a few years. You get used to the constant unhappiness, the violence, and the general crude attitudes of everyone. What makes this show uncomfortable is that it makes you watch it through the eyes of the main character, who is completely out of place in this environment. You don't just feel sorry for her, you feel her own sorrow and discomfort.

I think what really sucks you in is how real the show feels. It directly shows the mindless bureaucracy of government systems, the crudeness of prison life, and accurately portrays how an outsider would function when dropped into this world.

And you feel bad for the main character for being there over a crime committed 10 years prior. She really draws you in and makes you empathize with her, so you feel immediately connected with her. That's the hook of the show.

I actually don't want to watch more because it's uncomfortable to see a character you connect to be so miserable, but at the same time I can't wait to see what happens and if she's okay.

Update:

Since I wrote that initial review I've gotten most of the way through Season 1. The show does not disappoint as it moves forward. It keeps the viewer mentally in the prison with the characters so you feel like you are experiencing all of Chapman's (the main character) emotions and triumphs. (Yeah, she has a few wins along the way).",1404950400,2,1616,4.59375

Give Comcast a run for its money. Comcast is too powerful for its own good sometimes. This is based on a book called Orange Is the New Black: My Year in a Women's Prison. The writer of this true story, Piper Chapman went to prison for a few months for transporting drugs. Shes kind of educated and upper middle class, so she sticks out a little and has a hard time of, like anyone has a good time in prison. Its amazing how simple some of the plot devices are in this show, but its written so well, a chicken becomes fascinating. It has a great cast that played their parts perfectly. It really gives you both sides of the story. The criminals aren't so bad and the guards and prison employees are so good. I think maybe, henceforth the title. Its funny and dramatic and gripping.

Orange Is the New Black revolves around Piper's experiences when she is sent to prison for a crime she did in her early twenties with her former lesbian lover. Piper must leave her soon to be husband and friends and start a completely different life. This show doesn't try to glamorize prison at all like some viewers suggest, but it more makes fun of the characters there while showing a great message that we all make mistakes, and you can always redeem yourself.

6234831,5,B00HW3EXCE,"Had never heard of this show before seeing the DVD on the shelf and picked it up and found it to be an entertaining show and look forward to the next season being released on DVD.  I liked how the actors were pretty much all unknown, (the only one I recognised was Laura Prepon, who played Donna from That 70's Show, who plays Alex in this one and looks a lot different anyway).  This haven't seen before factor gave the cast a lot more believability that they could indeed be inmates, plus the fact that the actresses covered a wide range of real world body shapes and the makeup department did a good job as well (such as Pennsatucky who appears without teeth due her former drug addicted lifestyle) gave it a more a realistic feel.  It would have been tempting for higher ratings as a lot of US made shows have done in the past, just to fill the show with hot women but I think the show works, because they didn't.

The initial episodes obviously concentrate heavily on Piper, a blond surburban woman who had plans to be married before her younger days past caught up to her.  She's obviously a fish out of water and even though she's read up on prison life, in reality she puts herself off side with some of the inmates from the get go. Not helping her cause is that she gives off unwittingly, an I don't belong here like the rest of you vibe.  Her husband as you'll find out, won't help her case there either.  The season for me though became even better though when we started to learn the backstories and got to know the other characters a bit more and episode plots took up more time with them.

There are some inconsistencies with the plot, one episode has the prison setting like a high security one, where all hell breaks loose due to a missing screwdriver in fear it can be used to stab a guard or other prisoner down the track, but then the rest of the time it's like a minimum security facility, where everyone can go wherever they want such as the fact that anyone can just walk into the kitchen at anytime where there's a range of knives, the woman who used to be a man character has scissors to cut hair in her cell which anyone seems to be able to walk into and things like this.  I did wonder on the former man inmate, would he really be allowed to do his time in a women's prison just because he'd had something removed?  Would a snitch really be in the same prison as the person she gave up who got sent there too?  Would a mother and daughter really be sentenced into the same facility?  These things though do add to the fun of the plot, and who knows perhaps they do indeed happen in real life prison.

Orange is the New Black is an interesting title for a show considering inmates in this prison only wear orange while they're being processed during their first days.  But I guess it's more catchy than light brown is the new black.  There's also some nice extras that come with the DVD, besides episode commentary on a few, there's also a few short documentaries where the actors are interviewed (and you get to see them with teeth, speak in their own country's accent and so forth), where they talk about the show and their characters. The real life Piper is interviewed. There's also a gag reel.  All up the episodes and documentary extras take up around 12 hours so it's good value for money on that front too.",1403308800,,3339,4.335473515248796

The fact that Netflix is the only game in town is incredible: nicely done Netflix. Kudos to the lack of  commercials when a client is already paying for the priveledge of viewing a program.  The cast is incredible.  Kate Mulgrew and Laura Prepon deserve awards - although I'm not certain the ""industry"" is ready to support such a revolutionary concept.  This series gives me the willies, headaches, and chills: yet I'm riveted.  Spend the bucks, binge-out and NEVER admit you became addicted to this Jerry Springer mess as it is a definite guilty pleasure.  I'm certain I've had nightmares about making the one or two wrong decisions the way these individual women (stories) have and ending up in their shoes.

6234833,3,B00HW3EXCE,"I really enjoyed the first season as a very well played ensemble production with an almost entirely female cast. It was full of interesting characters, but most importantly it felt fresh. It wasn't like every other prison film ever made.  The diversity of characters, especially the expert portrayals by the  cast of Latinas, was refreshing and always watchable.  I'd give it four stars, five for some episodes.

But in the second season the show seems to be running out of ideas and descending into staple clichs of prison pictures, including at least three explicit beatings.  This is most vividly seen in the introduction of the Vee""/Yvonne Parker character (played by Lorraine Toussaint).  If anything, Ms. Toussaint is too expert in her vivid portrayal of the prison gang leader, female division.  I was hoping the series was going away from this kind of thing and Ms. Toussaint is more than talented enough to go in another direction.  But when she shows up with her gang of enforcers, what the heck?  The sex business is also going over the top. For example, the steamy (literally- it takes place in the shower, chuckle, chuckle) but wholly gratuitous sex scene between Soso (Kimiko Glenn) and Nicky Nichols (Natasha Lyonne) seems to have no purpose except fan service/prurient interest.  Remember those ""women in prison"" pictures whose main feature was lots of nudity?  Headed that way.

Just incidentally, the season goes against two of the principle points in Ms. Kermans book.  Despite generations of women in prison movies there was no serious violence in her prison and no obvious sex, lesbian or otherwise. If the show wants to be just one more prison movie they can do it without me.",1403308800,17,1698,4.936619718309859

6234835,1,B00HW3EXCE,"I can think of two reasons to watch a TV series: I enjoy the characters (either like or dislike them, or both) and become interested in what happens to them (The Simpsons comes to mind); or something about the series arouses a more or less sexual response in me. Sports bore me to death, but I loved Friday Night Lights because so many of the guys were gorgeous. This series neither entertains me nor turns me on.

I'm a gay male, and nothing about the female body or female sexuality excites me; in fact, it turns me off. So just the idea of a women's prison doesn't automatically get my juices flowing, and the abundant nudity and sex in this series leaves me cold and irritated. On top of that, every single character in this series is annoying, from the leads to the very least of the supporting roles.

Piper Chapman is so obnoxious that she deserves far worse than what she gets here; I'd keep watching if I thought she'd eventually (hoping for sooner rather than later) get bumped off, but I know she won't. Her loser boyfriend isn't even sexy, which would be my only hope in a scenario like this.

A Jewish nerd is pretty much my ideal man, but there's something very creepy about Jason Biggs (he isn't Jewish, for one thing) that negates any appeal the character might have. There aren't even any real villains I can hate, just dozens of petty, stupid, ugly, obnoxious jerks, who spend all their time posing and snarling.

By the time I had struggled through the first two episodes, the ""So what?"" factor was so overwhelming that I gave up. If it gets better later, I won't know or care.",1403136000,3,1596,4.474226804123711

6234837,4,B00HW3EXCE,"We've been watching 2 episodes a day for the past week or so.

What an excellent and enjoyable first series this has been.  I'm always interested in pressure cooker/intense situations and women's prison can certainly be that.  I,  with many others,  find Piper Chapman one of the less interesting characters,  but I love so many of the women and their stories and interaction.  Poor Pennsatucky, who is far crazier than Crazy Eyes,  Tastee who can't find her feet outside,  even Yoga Jane and trackstar girl - all of them are wonderful.

I will say that the inmates are more nuanced than the guards/administration who are mostly far less likeable.  Pornstache is a great villan,  but the rest of them (except for the sweet female guard who's face is so familiar but who's name I forget, and the ex vet)  are just awful without being interesting.

Then add the highly improbable 99% of the institutional role models (guards, etc.) being portrayed as also mostly self-serving baddies.

One surprise was seeing Kate Mulgrew as the character, Red!  When I first saw her, she was an actor on the soap, Ryans Hope, who went on to play Captain Janeway on Star Trek Voyager.  She is a great actor and helps make this show stellar. The main character is played by Taylor Schilling, who gives a great performance as the nervous, forlorn, mistreated prison inmate, Piper Chapman. Immediately conspicuous for her skin-color and prissy attitudes, she is an easy target which some inmates delight in tormenting, while others are drawn to her helplessness. There are slices from all walks of life among the inmate population and the character development of each persona is excellent.  Flashbacks allow viewers to experience the behind-the-scenes disadvantages and experiences that each character has encountered.  This enables the viewer to better empathize with the ill-mannered behavior, social deviance, odd quirks, or outright meanness exhibited by the various characters. The show is a character driven series and makes for its audience to be able to identify with one or another nuance of the wide array of characters.

I, for one, could do without the nudity, raunchiness, and language of this show and others like it such as Deadwood (I did not watch after 1st episode), True Blood, and Game of Thrones (Im an avid fan despite the raunchiness). Still, I tolerate it since I have little choice and television/movies can still be masterpieces despite the crude elements. Orange, however, would be remiss if it didn't convey the naked vulnerability, setting starkness & lack of privacy experienced by inmates. As an audience, you may be offended by this up-in-your-face display yet it lends an authenticity to the show, which the audience experiences in shock & empathy, making it all the more credible.

6234885,5,B00HW3EXCE,"From Jenji Kohan, the creator of Weeds, based on Piper Kerman's memoir: ""Orange Is the New Black: My Year in a Women's Prison"", about her experiences in prison. The series revolves around Piper Chapman (Taylor Schilling), a bisexual woman living in New York City who is sentenced to 15 months in a women's federal prison for transporting a suitcase full of drug money to her former girlfriend, Alex Vause (Laura Prepon who played Donna from That '70s Show.), who is an international drug smuggler. The offense occurred ten years prior to the start of the series, and in that time Piper had moved on to a quiet, law-abiding life among New York's upper middle class. While in prison, Piper is reunited with Alex, and they re-examine their relationship and deal with their fellow inmates. Piper navigates the stresses it creates in her life and with her fianc Larry (Jason Biggs). While in prison, Piper tries to understand and find her place in the hierarchy. Sentenced to fifteen months for a crime committed ten years earlier, Piper Chapman leaves her supportive fianc Larry for her new home: a women's prison. Her supervisor, Sam Healy sympathizes with her and tries to gently give her tips to survive. She grapples with the racial dynamics of prison life and learns some of the rules. Unfortunately, she offends Red, the powerful matriarch of the prison kitchen, who responds by serving Chapman a bloody tampon. Chapman is then shocked to discover that Alex, her former lover (who recruited her into carrying drug money) is in the same prison. Flashbacks depict the particulars of Chapman's crime, Chapman telling her family about her crime, and Larry's marriage proposal.

6234888,1,B00HW3EXCE,"Extremely raunchy show and what's sad is that people are too busy being entertained by the raunchiness to even decipher what this show really is. The show is mainly about a privileged white female who can do no wrong that is placed into prison. She is out of place in prison because she is a privileged white female and innocent. She is trapped in an odd place around people of other ethnicities that belong there more than her because she is a privileged white female. All of the other inmates trail right behind whatever Hollywood stereotypes you want to place them in. This show is mainly the view of prison from the privileged white perspective. That is the theme that the show mainly follows.

 You take that and throw in some other trending topics like gay rights and throw in a lesbian relationship and some transgenders and there you go. My mind just isn't numb enough to ignore the obvious about this show and the audience it's targeted at. To anyone with even one quarter of a brain this series is offensive on many levels. Even to people that work in prisons it's offensive to how the system is actually ran. Calling this a ""comedy"" must be a play on the word ""ignorant"". This is an ignorant show for ignorant people. In the real world prison is made up of different types of people and privileged white female would be 1 of 1,000 other women behind bars with the similar story of drug trafficking so she would fit right in. What I dislike the most about this series that it makes the statement of if you're white and privileged you don't belong behind bars even if you commit a crime.

 It's more so about that than a woman going to prison for the first time. This is right on par with the logic of the real Piper Kermans who this show is loosely about. Being a citizen of privileged white society does not excuse you from punishment for breaking the law. These ""other"" people belong here but you don't because you can make hand soaps and lotions. Let's skip that and get back to the drugs you smuggled and why it's a crime and where those drugs end up and the lives they destroy. Obviously this movie turns its cheek to that and so does Piper Kerman. She received an extremely light sentence due to being white and privileged for her crimes to which ""others"" not in the same boat would have spent 8-10 years in prison. After her ""tap"" on the wrists this is her story and if you'd ask me I'd rather watch turds float in a public restroom.

If this show was actually about a woman accepting responsibility for her crime and coping with the time she had to do and they removed the stereotypes it almost might be worth watching.

If they had the transgender, lesbian relationships in there as a part of the prison life and not as ""Let's throw this in your face to get the support of the gay community"" than I wouldn't bother bringing up the obvious.

It's hard to pretend that this show isn't about a privileged white woman thrown in prison amongst minorities from broken homes and now her world is turned upside down as she has left her white privilege bubble to do 1.5years in prison.

This is a comedy? For who? Reminds me of those late  mid - late 90's movies that would feature a Caucasian male that would have to join up with a group of African Americans for sake of whatever the shallow movie plot would be and the first thing they'd have him do is flip his hat backwards and start using slang. It was supposed to be funny and entertaining to see a usually upper class white male acting like a ""homeboy""... I mean acting out stereotypes.

Orange is The New Black is that movie in show form updated for the 2000's. complete with Gay stereotypes and racial stereotypes.",1399507200,23,3683,4.442962962962963
6234889,1,B00HW3EXCE,"OK, let me start by saying that I am a late age male, who understands and appreciates the need to include authenticity to make a drama synch up to reality, however I am surprised to admit that ""Orange is the New Black"" has driven home the point to me that adult fare, whether on Netflix, HBO, AMC, Showtime or any other venue that is not associated with one of the big commercial television networks, has taken a turn that I find disturbing and another signal of the decline of western civilization.

What I am speaking of, you ask? Rampant profanity, excessive nudity and a show that, in the early episodes that I was determined to watch, seems to be a sanctioned version of soft porn.

Yes, I know its a prison drama/comedy, and use of the F word is to be accepted as part of common prison vernacular, but the depiction of womens anatomy and sexual activities is just not necessary and serves to distract from the story and pacing, and has caused me to question what constitutes good television versus a show that has descended into B grade storytelling?

When I strip away the vulgar excesses, the story, with interesting kernels of info dispensed about the justice system, as well as the back flashes of each of the main characters offers up a show that has huge potential, but with all of the other B grade TV elements, it has caused me to step back and question my viewing habits.

I have watched and enjoyed several other adult dramas not of the commercial TV fare, and each has its share of profanity and adult situations, however none has gone to the excesses that Orange offers thru the first several episodes.

As a viewer, I have chosen the little time I spend watching TV in shows that offer a story worth telling, with realistic characterizations, which include situations that do not always have to end happily, and I am willing to watch and look past thematic elements that are required to keep the story moving forward, but when I find that I am growing embarrassed as a show moves thru its paces of telling a story, I realize that I am compromising my expectations just to be watching something.

As a result, I struggle to endorse this show, as it poses to offer B grade TV fare as compelling TV drama, and it does so in a way that offends as much as it entertains.

Watch if you must, but be forewarned that it appears to be walking a fine line between drama and adult soft porn.",1398643200,77,2399,4.475972540045767
6234890,5,B00HW3EXCE,"I've had Netflix for quite some time but had never taken advantage of watching any of Netflix's original content.  Being more of a movie guy, I find myself getting impatient when it comes to watching TV shows.  Then one day when I was sick, I saw a few of my friends raving about this show and just had to give it a curiosity try, so I did.  If you had told me beforehand that I would watch this whole season in its entirety--TWICE--I would have called you crazy.

Orange is the New Black succeeds in bringing doses of comedy and intrigue to what would otherwise seem to be a female version of Oz.  Set at a correctional facility in New York state, it tells us the story of Piper Chapman, a young woman who's serving a prison sentence for what basically amounts to being an accessory in drug running with a former ex-girlfriend, Alex.  In addition to showing us her daily struggle in this prison, we also see life on the outside with Piper's fiancee, Larry, a struggling writer who's trying to make his mark in journalism while keeping it together for the sake of his and Piper's relationship, which is a lot harder than he would believe it to be.

OitNB features a lot more characters, such as Red, a woman serving a lengthy prison sentence who is now in charge of the prison kitchen.  Her character happens to be one of my favorites in the series so far.  We also get to meet other interesting characters such as Miss Claudette, an actual gentle soul whom is feared by all the inmates, and ""Pornstache"" Mendez, a correctional officer who happens to be a real jerk.

It's really worth watching on Netflix if you subscribe to the service, it really is.  However, I see myself picking up the DVD or Blu-ray set when the time comes just in case the dark day arrives where I don't have the wonderful service anymore.",1398384000,93,1813,4.447129909365559
