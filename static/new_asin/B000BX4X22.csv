Not a smile on my face, thanks for trying Johnny Delgado & Robin Padilla. You two cannot even save this film. I miss Dolphy's old movie.",1417219200,,256,4.354166666666667

8093760,4,B000BX4X22,"Directed by funny guy Mark Meilly and just by the title itself, La Visa Loca is a comedy film which shows how Filipinos go `crazy' over a US VISA. Unfortunately, this isn't a high grossing movie or a well-known one much as it deserves to be but it does not stop 'La Visa' from making it to my top favorite Pinoy movies.
The story revolves around Jess (Robin Padilla), who is half American, but lives an impoverished life in Manila as a driver-for-hire with an ailing father (Johnny Delgado) to care for. Jess maintains a long distance relationship with his girlfriend who is in Florida. Like any other millions of Filipinos, Jess thinks that the only way for him to get a better life is by living his American dream. And of course, without a US VISA, this `dream' will never be a reality. And so off our protagonist goes, doing whatever it takes, again - whatever it takes - just to get to America.
There are some subplots in the movie - like Jess having a lovechild from a previous fling, like having a sex-obsessed father that I don't find that delightful. What got me interested are these things shown about Filipino culture, which are very ordinary to us but really strange to foreigners. These are just some of those weird Filipino traits - like people being possessed by Baby Jesus or seeing images of Virgin Mary, faith/'fake' healers, mermaids at circus, etc. I couldn't stop laughing. It's a smart and witty take at the quirkiness, friendliness of the Filipinos. Not to forget, of course, are the singing bits of the chorus accompanied only by a guitar that shows Filipinos' passion for music.
I like Padilla in this film. To non-Filipinos, Padilla is a huge action star in our country. So doing this movie is like chartering untested waters, maybe one of the reasons why it was not a commercial hit. But I think he should be really proud of this project. The late actor Mr Delgado is simply amazing in this. His character was so real I got to think if he was really like that at home. That's how good he was. And to the writer and director Meilly, what a masterpiece.
I highly recommend this movie to those interested in Philippine culture and even to Filipinos who won't admit we have a bizarre tradition. Bizarre in a good way.",1365033600,,2239,4.558312655086849
