3512301,5,B001CHEXZI,"I have to agree with the other reviews already posted on this product.
This DVD set is a dream, come true for any fan of Popeye the Sailor or vintage animation for that matter.

Watching these early cartoons is always so nostalgic.  It takes you back to when times were simple and the ""Moral of the Story"" was simple and to the point.

Fleischer Studios did a great job with taking everyday ideas, commonalities & life lessons and incorporating them into their wonderful vintage animation.  Not just with Popeye the Sailor but with all their cartoons (Betty Boop, Superman, etc...)

If you want a great sampling of where Popeye the Sailor has come from and where he ended up, this is the DVD set for you.",1216339200,11,704,4.555555555555555
3512302,5,B001CHEXZI,"This review is for Popeye the Sailor: 1930-1960 (Enhanced Edition) 2-DVD Set.

The 9 black & white and 10 color episodes look stunning on my HDTV.  These 19 episodes could very well be the best compilation of Popeye the Sailor I have ever seen.

This set contains two awesome Bonus Features.  The first bonus is two of the three Technicolor specials, Popeye Meets Ali Baba's 40 Thieves and Popeye Meets Sinbad the Sailor.  The second is ""Let's Sing with Popeye"", an early Popeye cartoon where we meet him on deck singing his song.",1215907200,6,530,4.655913978494624

8287661,1,B001CHEXZI,"The positive reviews are this are what I consider to be very ""Suspicious"". Either they are fake or written by people who don't know what they are talking about.

1. This is a DVD-R not a DVD since it is cheaper to not have stock.
2. These are all mostly PD cartoons, except for a few but since WB has nothing to do with this release we can only assume they don't know about it.
3. The quality is subpar, the prints are not 1st generation.

They aren't going to look good on your SD TV, so how could it look great on 50+ inch TVs? For serious Popeye collectors AVOID and buy the licensed WB sets that contain all of these remastered properly.",1399680000,,641,4.161290322580645
8287662,3,B001CHEXZI,"I bought the dvd for my newly born baby to watch, so that I could have something to entertain him during leasure. But I was a bit disappointed. The first dvd consists popeye cartoons during the early era in black and white. Meanwhile the second dvd included series in color.

At the first place, I thought all cartoons in both dvds are in color. Anyway, it's a good product for popeye fans.",1261526400,,390,4.416666666666667
8287663,1,B001CHEXZI,"(...). The BW cartoons look really bad with flickering, image bouncing up and down and compression artifacts. The color ones are no better than other cheap DVD's I've seen. Like this is not enough, the second disk is skipping in 3 different players.

The icing on the cake is that this ""enhanced"" version is BURNED on regular DVD-R's, not stamped as one would expect a commercial DVD to be.

What a dissapointment ....",1239840000,26,418,4.712328767123288
8287664,4,B001CHEXZI,I bought this as a gift for my son who is a huge Popeye fan and he loved it.  The bonus cartoons are his favorite.,1228176000,,114,3.56
8287665,5,B001CHEXZI,"The mighty, muttering mariner you all know and love has finally made shore leave on DVD.

That's right. THE Popeye the Sailor is back!  I like Popeye as much as the next animation buff and this set totally proves it. Watch as his two strong arms pack a few punches that render the impossible, so to speak. Whether you grew up with him back in the day, or just got to know him, the spinach-loving sailor man is pretty cool back in his time.

Yes, this collectible set of Max Fleischer classic cartoons will be something to own if you're looking for something very vintage. So watch. Laugh. Sing along if you like. Enjoy this retrospective rally of cartoons which will be a treasure for generations to come. You'll really enjoy the history involved as well. And you may never eat spinach the same way again!

He is what he is and that's all what he is; he's strong to the finish 'cause he eats his spinach. (Well, you get the idea.) I certainly hope the rest of Popeye's cartoons will be out on DVD real soon.",1217289600,2,1007,4.3689839572192515
