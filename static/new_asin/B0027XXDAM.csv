8355246,5,B0027XXDAM,"I bought this film because I had viewed it once before and was very impressed as always with Ken Loach's work. My mistake was not realizing that while the DVD I purchased has the original English audio track, it does not have English subtitles as an option, only French. The first half of the movie is almost exclusively German dialogue, so be aware which subtitle language is available on the version you buy, as there are several different versions available.",1387584000,2,461,4.775
