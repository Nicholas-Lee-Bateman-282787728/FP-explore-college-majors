2592465,1,B000FVQYSG,"The only good skit from these three episodes was the Tupac skit. That's prolly one of the best skits -ever- actually. But the rest of the skits suck.

Big disappointment with these episodes. And I originally thought there were supposed to be 4? Who knows.. but buy the first two seasons, which are priceless comedy.",1154304000,3,315,4.7272727272727275
2592466,2,B000FVQYSG,"I waited a year to see these skits and, well, I feel a bit letdown.  Chappelle's Show: The Lost Episodes probably should've stayed lost.  I only bought it to complete my Chappelle's Show collection.  I can think of maybe two skits that were laugh out loud funny -- the very first skit where Dave is getting a haircut and the club skit where they talk about Tupac. There are a few honorable mention skits like the Daddy Day Care 2 and the MTV Cribs skit.  Revenge Is Best Served Cold and Say What You Mean skits are cool, but like most of the material on the disc, it won't generate anything more than a chuckle.  I did enjoy the audience participation on Episode 2 though.

Sadly though, the drawbacks are plenty.  First and foremost, Dave Chappele is missing, so naturally the show will feel different.  Secondly, Charlie Murphy and Donnell Rawlings simply aren't very good hosts.....especially Rawlings.  They seemed uncomfortable and sometimes unable out there while they were hosting.  Another problem I found were the number of thrown in skits that didn't even have Dave in them (like the ""I'm Broke B*tch"" throw in) and the Howard Dean skit isn't funny at all.  I thought the rehashing of Lil' Jon was corny (especially since his buzz is dying), the Chuck Taylor Newsbreaks weren't funny, and don't even get me started on the awful Pixie skit.  Also, you should probably pass on about 80% of the bonus features, they're pretty weak.  Basically, the first episode is the best one....then you can kind of jump from scene to scene throughout the rest of the disc to save yourself some time.

My guess is that Dave was losing steam and wanted to seperate himself from any mediocrity associated with this disc (and trust me, there's plenty).  I'd only recommend this DVD to die hard Dave Chappelle fans.  Though most of this stuff is forgettable, there are still tidbits here and there that are really funny.  I actually respect Dave a little more now for not wanting to have this released and letting people know that before the DVD hit store shelves.  Comedy Central did what any company would do with such a hot commodity and released this so they could cash in (the sketches belong to them, so they can do whatever they want with them).  If you're going to buy this, you may want to consider waiting until you find it used if you're not a collector.  If you're not a die hard fan, then save yourself the disappointment.",1154131200,23,2424,4.6323185011709604
2592467,1,B000FVQYSG,this horrible show was a mess from the word jump&should have never made it this long. I never found anything funny about the show. all Dave Chappelle did was bite Snoop Dogg's concept&Show.  Charlie Murphy was a one trick pony and not funny either. I never felt the music on the show either. the show was a Choke job&a bad idea period. glad it's gone.,1154044800,,351,4.4
2592468,4,B000FVQYSG,"The swan song to one of the funniest shows ever on TV. The episodes themselves only had a few funny sketches in them. The Tupac, Pixie, and Puff Daddy sketches were hilarious. The funniest part of this DVD are the extras. There is a hilarious unaired sketch of Daddy Day Care 2 with Charlie Murphy. Donnell ""Ashy Larry"" Rawlings and Charlie give hilarious commentary on every episode. There is a ""Making of Season 3"" featurette that is very funny where they debate the Pixie sketch. Also on this DVD, the banjo player in the Pixie sketch (played by Mos Def) is edited out. The musical performances are John Legend ""Ordinary People"" and Dead Prez ""Hip Hop"". Its a shame this show ended on a bad note. I guess it was too far ahead of its time, like the Richard Pryor TV show.",1153958400,2,773,4.450704225352113
2592469,2,B000FVQYSG,"When Dave Chappelle shocked the world by turning his back on Comedy Central and his smash hit Chappelle's Show, rumors of completed skits, or in this case ""lost episodes"" were rampant.  Now, in 2006, Chappelle's Show: The Lost Episodes are here, and upon viewing, it's apparent why Chappelle had grown so disatisfied with the direction the show was taking.  Since Dave is no where to be found, Charlie Murphy and Donnell Rawlings host and present the sketches, which range from Dave imitating Howard Dean, to once again imitating P. Diddy and Lil' Jon.  The saddest part of this DVD isn't that Dave is gone, it's how painful some of the skits are to watch.  The Howard Dead and Gary Coleman spoofs go nowhere, as does ""The Monsters"" in which Dave, Charlie, and Donnell are a werewolf, Frankenstein's monster, and a mummy respectively are discriminated against, and the much heard about pixie sketch is funny at first, but it only furthers the notion that Chappelle stated in interviews about it only furthering racial stereotypes instead of spoofing them.  The MTV Cribs skit begins slowly, but by the time Dave whips out some T-Rex eggs, it gets surprisingly funny.  The biggest gem of the sketches is Dave in a club that spoofs the post-humous releases by Tupac.  Other than that, there's hardly anything else here worth mentioning, which is incredibly disappointing.  The second season of Chappelle's Show was a step beyond the first season as Chappelle pushed the limits of comedy and racial issues, but you'd never know it once you give this a look.  It's worth a look for fans of the show who have been mourning it's demise, but don't expect much out of it.  Instead, check out Dave Chappelle's Block Party or his standup DVD's; they are much more worth your time and cash.",1153872000,109,1779,4.80327868852459
2592470,5,B000FVQYSG,"David Chappelle abandoned the show because he felt that instead of bringing light to stereotypes, he had inadvertently begun reinforcing them.  The ""pixie sketches"", in which Chappelle plays a pixie that derives great pleasure in taunting people about their stereotypes and subsequent insecurities, were the straws that broke the show's back.

When Chappelle felt that he was no longer reaching us through comedy, he quit.  He had wanted all along to teach us about ourselves, and other people in the world, while making us laugh.  An epitaph was being written for a show he no longer felt was within his control and his message had transformed into something he felt was incredibly hurtful.

Chappelle is the truest form of comedian and his sacrifices, enormous amounts of money and friendships as-well-as forever altering his career path and that of everyone that worked on the show, cannot be ignored.  Because of this, there is a tremendous amount of gravitas hanging over the 'Lost Episodes'.  Only a handful of these sketches allow us to momentarily forget Chappelle's frustrations.  But in the end, the comedy and the message still manages to shine through stronger than ever.

On a very simple level, this DVD will satisfy.  It will make you laugh, sometimes groan, and sometimes feel uncomfortable.  These sketches strike the same hilarity to skip-worthy ratio as the previous Chappelle seasons, with an extra-heavy dose of introspection.

On a much more complex level, the 'Lost Episodes' is an incredibly humorous, but ultimately sad milestone in the long history of tumultuous race relations.  The Chappelle Show was grounding breaking on many levels, but the greatest barrier it broke through was itself.

Highly recommended.",1153699200,13,1738,5.227436823104693
2592471,2,B000FVQYSG,"Here is one thing Dave would not want to hear.  This season is just not as good as the last two seasons.  There are good chuckles, but that is about it.  Dave was right to leave when he did.  The pixie skit is more than enough reason to justify his leaving.  I will be supporting Dave and not buying this DVD since he didn't want it out in the first place!",1153440000,5,356,3.9577464788732395
2592472,3,B000FVQYSG,"Now, I have been a big fan of the Chappelle's Show series since it began, so I guess that my hopes had been high for a new third season in 2005, just as they had been for the first two.  As many people know by now, a full third season was scheduled to premiere on Comedy Central in February 2005, but then it was delayed to May, and then it was said that it would not premiere ""until further notice.""  Due to multiple reasons, the season was never finished, and Comedy Central decided to just go ahead and air the few sketches that were shot, comprising of only three ""lost episodes.""

When considering the success of the two major seasons of the show, the content of The Lost Episodes is a bit disappointing.  The show seems to be lacking something that made the old material work better.  The sketches are just not as good as the old ones.  Chappelle himself agrees and it is one of the reasons it was not made a full season.  One of his concerns was that the way racial issues were handled no longer just poked fun at them, but reinforced them.  This is not to say that The Lost Episodes is all bad however.  If I was not already expecting something as grand as the first two seasons, then I probably would not have thought it as bad.

The bottom line:  if you're a big Chappelle's Show fan, you will still find things in this DVD that excite you, but if you're new to the show, I strongly recommend checking out the first or second season first instead, because though this DVD shows that Dave Chappelle is still a hilarious comedian regardless, it also shows that there is a reason he left the show.",1153008000,37,1604,4.3133333333333335

2592483,5,B000FVQYSG,"This is one of the funniest bits of comedy I've ever seen. Every episode is brilliantly written and performed. Hilarious, with a mockingly intellectual bent and social commentary weaving in and out between the lines and sometimes right in your face. And if you can make it through Charlie Murphy's True Hollywood stories without laughing your ass off, you need to have a word with yourself. Maybe Chapelle is just really modest and understated, but I feel like he's one of those underrated artistic geniuses. I feel like his humor scares some, and flies over the heads of others. And in today's America with half the country voting for Trump, I guess that is to be expected, and can maybe even heralded.",1466035200,2,703,4.770491803278689

2592511,1,B000FVQYSG,"Absolutely stupid. The first two seasons contain some of the most outrageous and funny skits in TV history. The Rick James skit from season 2 cannot be beat. This stupid min-season was thrown together from incomplete bits from the third season where Chapelle walked off the set. The skits are over-the-top stupid and just plain senseless. Imagine something so over-done that it is terrible. Like adding 10 teaspoons of sugar to your favorite drink. The right amount of sugar is great, too much is terrible. No one knows why he left mid-season; he says the producers of the show pushed him too hard. They say he lost his mind. Both look evident in this nightmare of a DVD.

Donell Rawlings and Charlie Murphy are good, but they cannot set up a skit to save their life.

2592544,1,B000FVQYSG,"I bought this cause I loved Chappelle's Show and my curiousity beat out my respect for Dave as an artist.  That was a mistake.  The only good reason for viewing this is that if you watch it, there will be no doubt in your mind that Dave's decision to drop out of the show was the right one.",1170201600,4,290,3.9827586206896552

2592548,4,B000FVQYSG,"I can't believe how many people only find the Tupac sketch and the Cribs sketch funny, when the Cribs sketch wasn't even all that. You can't tell me that the Howard Dean parody isn't friggin' hilarious! Or the News Update/ Torture sketch (maybe a lot of you haven't heard 36 Chambers?) Or the ""revenge is best served cold"" sketch. I mean, the funny sketches per episode ratio is at least as high as Season One.

  And I for one think the ""controversial"" pixie sketch deals fairly poigniantly with the fact that we all  must confront our racial heritage(s) when interacting with people around us and will be judged according to how we fulfill or reject that heritage. In fact, I'd say that The Lost Episodes contain some of Dave's most adventurous, observant and down-right funny race sketches to date. Can you really say that the Niggar Family sketch from Season Two offered anything insightful about race relations?

  The only complaint I have is the brevity of the disc. Which is the reason I give it four stars instead of five. But you can buy it used for ten bucks, and you're gonna spend half of that to rent it from Blockbuster anyways, so why not own it? I watched it three times when I rented it and will still probably buy it to watch some more.",1159574400,,1255,4.5265486725663715
2592549,1,B000FVQYSG,"They SUCK! Bad writing and jokes that rely on gimmicks and previously established Chapelle humor. It was like watching Mind of Mencia. Two thumbs down, leave this one alone.

2592550,1,B000FVQYSG,"I agree, these were not used in the first two seasons for a good reason, they are not that good.  OK, there is maybe one or two slightly funny sketches but it is not worth buying.  I love Charlie Murphy and the Ashy guy and I think they could have done more with these guys to make it funny.

2592552,2,B000FVQYSG,"It just doesn't work that well.  These skits are so obviously the C- versions or ""nevermind"" sketches that they never would have made it on the air if they were surrounded by the A+ material of previous seasons.  These episodes admittedly house several giggle-able moments and even some great stuff (I, too, very much enjoy the Tupac song), but the quality is under par, far under what one would expect even from an unfinished project like this one.  I recommend seeing them, just because they're funny enough to be worth the time to watch them, but also because it does provide some closure for those of us who have been attached to Chappelle's Show at the hip for a couple of years.",1155427200,3,684,4.590163934426229
2592553,2,B000FVQYSG,"I gave this DVD a chance being a big fan of not only the show but Dave Chapelle in general.  The skits on this disk were only moderately funny and without an intro by Dave they were just dissapointing.  I could see buying this DVD to complete a collection, but for entertainment value it falls way short of the mark.

The skit about MTV cribs was indeed funny but not worth buying the disk for.  I hope to see Dave do some more standup.  He's is definately one of the funniest men of our time.",1155427200,2,493,4.147368421052631
2592554,1,B000FVQYSG,"The title says it all. Reguardless of why Dave left, these ""episodes"" -- if you even want to call them that, should have stayed lost.

2592555,3,B000FVQYSG,"Like others have said this should have stayed lost. Im glad I borrowed it and didn't waste money on purchasing it. The only skit that I found to be funny was the ""New Tupac Song"" ""I wrote this a long time agooo back in 94"" lol that one had me going. The pixie skit was horrid. It made no sense what so ever. The racial draft from season 2 I believe was 1000x better. Overall I'd recommend you skip this one or if you REALLY really want to see it, borrow it or rent it from the video store. Its not worth $15.",1155081600,4,508,3.941747572815534
2592556,2,B000FVQYSG,"I think Dave Chappelle is a genius, really ground-breaking, intelligent commentary on society at large and the African-American experience.

I hope to God Dave is getting something positive from this.

Watching this dvd just made me sad. I could not enjoy the sketches fully (although, as stated by others the Cribs and Tupac skits work on their own and are funny). Many of the skits were missing Dave's lead-in and seemed disjointed and confusing at times.

Dave really makes the show - while Donnell and Charlie are funny respectively, it gave me a guilty feeling watching it - it's not their show. It wasn't right, it seemed really forced - not natural and genuine like Dave is. I don't think I could watch this dvd more than once.

Watch the first two seasons and the block party dvd, they're excellent.

I wish Dave well - I think he made the right choice to leave.",1155081600,9,870,4.623376623376624
2592557,2,B000FVQYSG,"I know Dave Chappell didn't want the ""It wasn't as good as the first 2 seasons"" review. Unfortunately, I can't think of anything else that would describe The Lost Episodes. Like many of the review below, the song ""I Wrote the song a long time ago"" by Tupac was timeless. However, that episode is pretty much where the laughter stopped for me. The entire season didn't have me rolling on the floor pounding my fist. Compared to his previous work, the Lost Episodes didn't meet the bar. It really did disappoint me, because season 1 & 2 show just how funny this man can be.",1154908800,3,571,4.447619047619048

2592559,1,B000FVQYSG,"The sketches in the previous two seasons, were well thought out and complete. The season three sketches are incomplete (except for the Tupac sketch) and they come off as such. The comic logic previously displayed by Chappelle and company is missing. The hosts (Donnelle Rawlings and Charlie Murphy) are no where near as charasmatic or articulate in their set up of the sketches as Chappelle was. Sure it's funny to see Ashy Larry act a fool, and Murphy act like a tough guy, but it gets tired after the first episoid. Save your money, and look up Chappelle show on youtube.",1154476800,10,573,4.683168316831683
2592560,2,B000FVQYSG,"That Chappelle's Show will be regarded as one of the funniest ever seems beyond dispute. Exceedingly sad that Comedy Central elected to pick the bones of the carcass clean by slapping together this DVD. Dave, the fans, and the show itself deserved better. Goodbye Chappelle's Show - and thanks for 2 incredibly funny seasons.",1154390400,7,325,5.037037037037037
2592561,2,B000FVQYSG,"Let's face it. Chappelle's Show was dying a slow and commercialized death. If you remember back in 2004, everyone and their mother was copying Chappelle as Lil John and the infamous ""I'm Rick James, bitch!"" quote. This got really tiring, and it started to signal the beginning of a slow, slow descent towards massive commercialization and ""jumping the shark"", as some would say.

With the release of these so-called ""Lost Episodes"" (I saw these episodes on Comedy Central), I can somewhat understand why Chappelle went AWOL. These sketches leave A LOT to be desired to viewers who have seen such classic sketches as ""Clayton Bigsby"", ""The Mad Real World"", and ""Kneehigh Park"".

First off, while Chappelle's Show once showed varying sketches of well-thought out parody, The Lost Episodes seems to half-arse the premises of the sketches in these episodes. From what I have seen, I sense that all of the sketches only range from tired pop-culture references, Dave flaunting his $50 million dollar contract, or politically correct versions of their original routine.

Now, I wouldn't mind this linear type of comedy as long as I was laughing on a consistent basis. The only problem was that I wasn't laughing that much. Sure, I was chuckling at times, but when you have such unfunny and hackneyed sketches like the Paris Hilton Sex Tape, the Pixie Sketch, and Gary Coleman as a Security Guard, it gets hard to keep your patience with the program.

Unfortunately, due to the fact that Viacom was seeing green with these episodes, this show died a death that it shouldn't have. As I have said, Chappelle's Show is pretty much dead, due to Dave's threat of ending the show if the Lost Episodes were released. I quietly weep for this once excellent show that had to be abused by corporate interests. I hope you made a lot of money off of this, Viacom. You just added another show to your list of casualties during your tyrannical reign.",1154390400,9,1928,4.833333333333333
2592562,3,B000FVQYSG,"i loved this show when it first came out as did just about everyone that has seen it. that was years ago. now we have this. i wasn't entirely disappointed with this dvd, only it felt a little empty. i think charlie murphy is funny along with the other guy, but it just didn't seem right that they hosted these episodes. aside from that, some of the skits were hillarious while others bordered on tedium.

after watching some of the older episodes, i realized these were just about the same as the rest of the skits, it is only a little too late for them to be released. i fully understand why David left when he did. he wanted to be remembered as one of the funniest comics out there who only did the show for the love of it, not for the money.

check this dvd out only if you were like me and couldn't wait to see something new from him. if not then just watch it on comedy central. it is nice having it uncensored so if you must, just rent it.",1154390400,5,945,4.102702702702703
