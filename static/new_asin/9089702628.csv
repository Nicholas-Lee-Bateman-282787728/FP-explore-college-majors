1172947,5,9089702628,"This is a great idea and I would say a really good sampler if you are not that familiar with ambient films. We do own a lot of them and use this one every so often as a sort of background showing every facet of Mother Nature, we have bought it for a couple of friends and they just love it. Funnily enough, our 8 year old grandaughter is mesmerized by it so I guess it is a really good buy too! Well recommended",1389657600,4,411,3.9047619047619047

1172951,5,9089702628,"I own many of Tony's virtual walk DVDs, which I use and love. This is for when you just want to sit and gaze at a peaceful scene...and there are 24 to choose from. Although each is fairly short, they loop endlessly, which is a great feature. Thanks for another excellent product!",1421020800,,279,4.384615384615385
1172952,5,9089702628,We got this DVD for my mother who has Alzheimer's.  It is working out very well.  There are 24 nature scenes which play for 5 minutes each before moving to the next scene.  You can stay with just one or rotate through the 24 (which is what we are doing.)  We have it set to just keep cycling as long as the TV is on.  It has been perfect for her.  Changing every 5 minutes keeps it interesting but relaxing.  Some similar ones we bought changed too often and she couldn't keep up - it made her anxious.  She is glad that she can now watch TV again and she has something beautiful to add to her day.  She can no longer follow regular TV programs.,1420848000,2,645,4.055555555555555
1172953,5,9089702628,"Very nice nature scenes. The sounds that go with are real nice too.  I like it a lot. Each scene plays for 5 minutes and then goes to the next, or you may play only one and it will go dark for a second then repeat. I like it in the morning.
There is really a nature scene for everyone, and I think at least one scene will remind you of your childhood,  your home or bring back a nice memory.",1419811200,4,391,3.814814814814815
1172954,5,9089702628,"It's like having a framed picture on the wall...if you have seen those framed pictures that light up and it looks as if they are moving...it turns your TV into that.  The picture itself does not rotate as they are still scenes but the scenes themselves have movement...for example, a flowing river.  There are 24 scenes to choose from so no matter who is watching, they will find something they like.  Find the scenes that are to your liking and keep a continuous loop or play all of them in rotation.",1418428800,,501,4.483516483516484

1172958,5,9089702628,"I own many of Tony Helsloot's DVDs - I'm always amazed and mesmerized by the gorgeous photography of the different DVD's - With that said, this one is one of my very favorites - in that you get SO many different views of nature - I never tire of watching it. From beaches to mountains to lakes to beautiful flowers (my favorite is the sunflower film). But every single scene is different and stunningly beautiful. I really enjoy sunrises and sunsets. They're all here to be enjoyed over and over again.  Well done!!",1400889600,5,515,4.537634408602151
1172959,5,9089702628,"I love these ambient DVDs!  Most evenings when I am reading, I will put one on in the background; it adds beauty and mental rest to my evening.  This one is great because the viewer can choose between 24 different natural views (rushing river, falling snow, tropical sunset, waves on a sandy beach, underwater fish, and many more!) They automatically loop continuously.  If desired, a viewer can choose to have all 24 scenes play, one after another, and that also will continuously loop.  I think every home should have a number of ambient nature videos to add life and peace.  After all, most of us don't spend enough time in nature.  Obviously, actually going outside is best, but why not top off your nature with some MORE nature?!  This company (Isis) does beautiful work - the videos and sound are high quality and the locations excellently chosen.  Highly recommended!",1391126400,9,874,4.818791946308725

7901506,5,9089702628,This is by far my favorite Nature DVD. I really like that there isn't any music. I also like that the camera does not pan. It really is like looking out a window. Very peaceful and relaxing. I have worn out my first dvd and purchased a second one. I use it daily while studying and meditating.,1458604800,,293,4.157894736842105

7901510,2,9089702628,I did not realize it was more a computer generated video and not actual nature scenes.  I wanted to use this video as a sleep aid; some scenes are too bright to induce sleep.  I purchased Echoes of Creation which I had viewed on KCET.,1434585600,,234,4.177777777777778
