4232801,5,B003Z6HSKQ,"""Giving Festival Movie"" is the latest CGI film in the ""Care Bears"" series as of 2010 and part of the ""Adventures in Care-a-Lot"" franchise, though not marketed under that title.

Visually, the film is absolutely wonderful. It's obvious that they've upgraded the quality of their CGI since ""Oopsy Does It"" and it shows in some delightful backgrounds and eye-catching special effects. There are also some slight changes to the character models, but they don't bother me.

""Giving Festival Movie"" is presented as a series of three segments tied around one story. It begins with the Care Bears getting ready for the Giving Festival and the arrival of their good friend Princess Starglow. Grumpy has designed a machine to make snow, but a big windstorm blowing through Care-a-Lot threatens to cancel the festival. It gets them thinking about past times, leading into the first main story, in which Grizzle decides to try to move Care-a-Lot away from his home. He ends up creating a big quake and then getting stranded in Care-a-Lot. The Care Bears take him back home, but he repays their kindness by trying to trick them into a trap. In the second story, Oopsy, Wingnut, and True Heart decide to give the new Care Team: Funshine, Cheer, Grumpy and Share a vacation, a day all to themselves having fun. Oopsy invites True Heart to join them, but she runs off and cries and Oopsy & Wingnut learn that she's scared of riding the Funderbolt. They resolve to help her out, but must first deal with an emergency involving the Care Team. In the final story, the Care Team has to rescue Princess Starglow, who has been trapped in a cage by Windle. Windle doesn't like the Giving Festival and is trying to stop Princess Starglow from coming.

This is not a musical, but that is not to say that the music isn't good. There are three songs - the show title theme (used right at the beginning), the energetic ""Care Power On"" and finally ""The Giving Season's Here"" at the end of the film.

The film is presented in 1:78:1, enhanced for widescreen TVs and with closed-captions. The sound is 5.1 Dolby Digital. This film is not rated, but would probably be suitable for all but the very youngest audiences. Bonus features include trailers for other film and television releases, the game Save the Giving Festival! and the ""Care Bears Adventures in Care-a-Lot"" episode ""Belly Blanked / All Give and No Take"" (traditional animation.)",1289174400,5,2410,4.7860576923076925
4232802,5,B003Z6HSKQ,"""The Giving Festival"" is a prime example of The Care Bears at their best. It fits in with both Thanksgiving and the Christmas
Holidays. I really loved the segment with Oopsy and TrueHeart. I also like the concept of The Care Power Team. This is a movie
worth watching for kids and those of us who are kids at heart.",1289088000,5,315,4.266666666666667
4232803,4,B003Z6HSKQ,"""It was wonderful because i love it.""- 4 year old daughters review
She now wants to be Princess Star Glow for Halloween.
It kept my kids entertained without being obnoxious, so that is always a plus for me.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Care-Bears-Giving-Festival-Movie/dp/B003Z6HSKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Care Bears: Giving Festival Movie</a>",1286755200,,387,7.622222222222222
