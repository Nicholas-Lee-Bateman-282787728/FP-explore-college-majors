8247663,3,B0012SB1D4,"I live in the area of the Dolores River.  This had some interest to me because there are many Anasazi ruins within a few miles of where I live.

This is basically a collection of 8mm movies taken by a small architectural crew back in the 1970's.

There is no narrative.  Most of the time you have little idea of what you are watching.

There were some interesting comments made on the sound portions.  For example, when trying to locate campfires, they used a magnetic anomoly detector.  That is something that I thought was fascinating.

There is no editing.  Most of the footage is of the young archeologists excavating a few kivas.  There were some interesting commentaries about the geology of the area and how it related to the pre-collumbian's anasazi occupation of the area.

In all, this is worth watching, but, I am not sure it is worth paying the price.",1342483200,,863,4.6118421052631575
