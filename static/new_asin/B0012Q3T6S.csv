3093411,3,B0012Q3T6S,"Robot Chicken: Star Wars is hilarious. Not as funny as Family Guy: Blue Harvest, but almost. I've seen it countless times on the internet and I've downloaded it on my Xbox 360. I would give this DVD 5 stars but the fact that they're releasing it on DVD is stupid. You're paying for a DVD that's slightly less than 23 minutes long. It's only a collection of segments you're paying for. The segments can seen for FREE on the Adult Swim website and maybe even on YouTube. Why waste your money? Unless you're a die-hard Robot Chicken fan and you only want to watch this in the comfort of your couch on your big-screen tv because you don't own a wireless laptop, I understand. But paying for something that's viewable free on the internet and on Cartoon Network seems silly. Maybe if they added more segments and a ton of special features, then yes I would buy it. But as it is, I wouldn't bother wasting my money.",1205107200,18,909,4.416666666666667
3093412,5,B0012Q3T6S,"Let me qualify this by saying I've yet to get my copy of this DVD so I cannot comment on any extras, if there even are any.

The review is purely for the content, about 30 Robot Chicken shorts that will leave hard core Star Wars fans rolling in the aisles.

I give this 5 stars only for the Star Wars fan, because the price of admission here is a bit steep for a DVD clocking in at just under half an hour and one that has already aired the Cartoon Network. Casual viewers think of this as a 3 star product, best rented before deciding to buy.  And it is certainly not for children.

But for the fan, the price is right and it is a must own for your collection, nestled securely next to your copy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Harvest/dp/B000YRY8CU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Harvest</a>.  The quality of these sketches are much more consistent than the normal hit or miss affair we've come to expect from Robot Chicken.  They were done for the fans, and that simple fact shines through in all of the gags and inside jokes.  Heck, creators Seth Green and Matthew Senreich even got George Lucas to play himself at a Star Wars convention -- a la William Shatner on SNL long ago.  Other notable voice talent includes Mark Hamill, Hulk Hogan, Seth Green & Seth MacFarlane, Malcolm McDowell and Conan O'Brien.

If you have seen it already, there is no reason for me to go into details.
If you HAVEN'T seen it and are a rabbid Star Wars fan, then I would not dream of spoiling any of the surprises.  As the altered opening sequence shows, was this was created with special affection just for you.
Enjoy!",1203638400,35,1655,4.695501730103806

I just loves all the bits and pieces of the Star War World that we got to glimpse into, broken and jagged and hilraious!  Seth Green is a genious and this dvd will have you cracking up!  The deleted scenes aren't much, just scetches really with some sound effects, but I would have liked to see the lego bit come to life.  What did make it to screen was well worth the effort though, as is all of Robot Chicken.  I just think its all little bits of masterpieces brought together with the leftover toys of our 80's playrooms and the mind's of genius who admire the more serious sort and make excellent parodies based on such.  Star Wars fans will not be let down here!  Way better than the Family Guy parody of Star Wars (any of them).  This is really just for anyone who like parodies or Robot Chicken, or comedy.

3093452,2,B0012Q3T6S,"I've given this 2 stars not due to the fact that the episode is not funny, i do love Robot Chicken and think the Star Wars parodies are terrific. It's the fact that this DVD is only 1 episode long, and then contains a bunch of bonus features you will watch once, and probably never again. I find it hard to give higher ratings to a 20 min long feature and a heap of useless extras. Hopefully Robot Chicken will release all 3 Star Wars specials on the one disc and do away with the filler stuff, and release a decent DVD, because just as I start to get into these things, the end credits roll and I feel disappointed that it's not a feature length movie, nor at least an hour of material.

I guess now for the price of it, it's not so bad, but when it first came out it was about as expensive as buying a whole season of RC, and makes me wonder why this episode just wasn't included in a RC season as well. It just feels like a cheaply made DVD to earn a bit of cash on the side for RC, so hopefully as I said, they will combine the 3 some day for the one DVD and make something worth purchasing instead of having to keep swapping over 3 discs to watch 20 min long episodes that could all be contained on the one. For the contents on this disc, i'd expect to see such things in a free promo disc or a newspaper giveaway, or maybe even given away with a happy meal, but as something sold world wide, it's hardly worth the price.",1288828800,16,1426,4.02112676056338

Um, duh, folks. This wasn't a theatrical movie which was edited for television. This was a television show that was transferred to video JUST AS IT AIRED. Why would you be surprised? The deliberately bleeped cursing, the fades for commercials, the shortness of the program, hey it was an animated TV show, what did you think you were getting, uncut Lord Of The Rings?

Take it from me, this is the funniest parody of Star Wars you'll ever see (except for RCST II, of course, also laugh-out-loud funny). If you watch RCST and know anything about the original films, you're pretty much guaranteed to fall off your couch laughing every five minutes for the entire length of the show. It's amazing how the producers did what they did, and it is very much worthy of the awards they've been given for the show.

3093457,3,B0012Q3T6S,"Robot Chicken: Star Wars / B0012Q3T6S

I really love Star Wars parodies, and I've seen Star Wars skits on ""Robot Chicken"" that were truly funny, so I was excited to get my hands on their official Star Wars special episode.

There's a lot of good stuff here, no doubt. Some of the best skits are the longer ones - Han's stalling tactics in the Death Star jail block, for instance, is quite droll (although I did like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Family-Guy-Blue-Harvest/dp/B000YOX3HE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Family Guy - Blue Harvest</a>&nbsp;marginally more, with 'Han' turning the stall into a radio advice call-in show), and the cantina scene (and background) of the poor alien who loses his arm to Obi Wan is completely hilarious. And who can forget the extended skit with Darth Sidious, taking Vader's call from his escape pod? Pure awesomeness.

For all that, though, the DVD is a touch expensive for what you're getting. Most of this is available in various forms online, and several of the really good Robot Chicken Star Wars skits aren't included here (presumably because they were done after the Star Wars special episode). Some of the skits are quick throw-aways, such as the ""Luke and Leia in bed the morning after"" (""That was so wrong..."", she says) skit that, okay, it's kind of a chuckle moment, but not really that great.

I'm not saying you shouldn't see this movie - it's definitely worth a view, just that you might want to save you money and just look for a rental or online content until this come down to something more reasonable. The DVD extras, in my opinion, aren't really thrilling enough to commit to a buy, but more devoted Robot Chicken fans may feel differently.

OK, the other thing I did NOT like about this.  Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) provided his voice for the DVD.  Did he NOT do all the parts where the Luke character was used?  Sometimes you could tell it was him, other times it sounded like someone else's voice.

The first film came out the year I was born, so by the third one I was already collecting the action figures (they still sit somewhere in a shoebox in my parents' garage, and they'd be waiting to provide me a fortune some day if I hadn't taken them out of the packages).  As a result of this, Star Wars has always held a larger significance for me than most other film series.

Maybe that's why I find this set of skits featuring star wars action figures to be much funnier than it has any right to be.  The characters and situations being shown are so familiar, so ingrained in my memory, that even subtle tweaking of these icons is just hilarious.  From Walrusman's bad day (my favorite skit here - poor Walrus was just suckerpunched by fate the day he ran into Luke) to the Emperor's frustration over the destruction of his Death Star (his final ""I love you"" to Darth Vader over the phone is priceless), the original skit material made me laugh so hard I was almost teary-eyed.  The bonus features are nice too, and expand the disc to a regulation-length.

I got my copy used on here for $4 and it was worth that many times over for the Walrusman skit alone.  If you're at all a fan of Star Wars, and Spaceballs (and Family Guy: Blue Harvest) left you thirsting for more Star Wars-related humor, look no further.",1235952000,,1378,4.376470588235295

Obviously I put the disc in my player with high expecations. What a let down. Of the four Star Wars clips I saw earlier this week, one was included on the disc. Where was ""Palpatines Trip""? Where was ""He said set to stun!"", Where was ""Take you daughter to work day""?.

As you can probably tell all of the clips that hooked me were missing. I bought this disc as I thought it would be a good collection to have, but it was luke warm at best. I think I laughed at about three of the clips. I have a feeling that all of the missing clips will be contained within the season box sets. Wish I hadn't wasted my time on this set, $3 per clip that made me laugh just wasn't worth it.

Watch the clips on Adult Swim and I hope the Box sets are better.

Robot chicken's regular episodes tend to be somewhat ""hit and miss"" with the short segments, but this collection of Star Wars bits are all amusing at least and some are laugh out loud funny. We actually ended up watching this 3 times in row and saw something we missed each time.

The episode bit with Jar-Jar and Vader is just about the funniest Star Wars parody I have ever seen and the Seth Green extras are a great addition (seriously, well worth watching).

Highly recommended for Star Wars fans with a sense of humor!

This collection is only about 23 minutes long, and there are a number of clip out on the web that are not included here, but this is worth every penny.
I should mention that it is from Cartoon Network's ADULT Swim.  It's not flagrantly R-rated, or anything, but there are a few moments that you might not want your children to see.  Nothing bad, but certainly PG-13 in places.  For example, there's one scene when Boba Fett is flirting with/coming on to Han Solo, when he's frozen in carbonite.  There are also a number of times when various characters use ""swear"" words that get bleeped out.  You hear only a tiny part of the word before it bleeps out, but you know what they're saying.

They did a great job reenacting many of the scenes from the actual movies but giving it a humorous twist to it while adding humor to other scenes. The only problem is the duration, making you think that there are other scenes that could have also had a funny outcome to it too.

Guess the first one was so successful they had to do another and it compares to the first Robot Chicken Star Wars like the second Star Wars movie compares to the first one. It's better. I'd say WAY better. So, see this first one and then be sure to watch the second one. Is there anything more ripe for parody than Star Wars movies?! (Except U.S. presidential politics of coarse). The sheer absurdity of the mostly poorly made Star Wars films combined with the fact that people still have an interest and still love them -or at least the originals, and know them scene by scene makes for a unique creative opportunity. The result of the Robot Chicken crew's hard work couldn't be better. Parody as art. Thumbs up. (And way better than Family Guy's effort ;-) You probably don't need to buy it.

Fanboys everywhere should love this disc! Six commentary tracks, lots of behind the scenes stuff, and Jar Jar Binks being sucked out an airlock! What's not to like?

Well, the run time. At least when ""Family Guy"" did their ""Star Wars"" spoof it was 42 minutes. This one is about half that length. True, the show itself has half the run time of ""Family Guy"", but still.

Aside from that, all the sketches are great, you get George Lucas doing his own voice, Mark Hamil turning up as Luke and plenty of great moments tweaking the nose of the ""Star Wars"" franchise!

Sure, like most episodes of Robot Chicken, there were some misses, but they hit on the mark more times than not.  Especially funny were the classic ""What the hell is an Aluminum Falcon"" episode, the ""Yo Momma Fight"" sketch, and the real reason why walrus guy got his arm cut off in episode IV.

But that's a personal opinion and I know not everyone will agree with it. Suffice it to say I don't watch it very often any more.

That being said, Robot Chicken Star Wars is hilarious. I saw the Family Guy Blue Harvest special and just wasn't impressed. Robot Chicken's romp in the Star Wars universe, though, was fairly imaginative and clever. I really just couldn't stop laughing.

Seth Green and Co. are real Star Wars fans and it shows throughout this video. The only complaint were two sequences that were just less funny than the rest. One being the George Bush scene where he believes he's a Jedi. The main reason for it being not as funny is because it just went on for too long. I found myself wishing they'd just go back to the Star Wars figures. The other scene was the Boba Fett talking to the Han Solo in carbonite. While funny and portraying Fett as creepy it still just went on too long after getting it's point across.

The rest of it was even funnier than those scenes. But again, much too short. I know how hard and time consuming stunt motion capture is, so I'm just grateful we got what we did.

They mostly consist of the creators and writers goofing around.  The deleted scenes are just drawings with audio.  This DVD was my first look at Robot Chicken.  It was mentioned at the end of the Family Guy ""Blue Harvest"" episode (it's funny that Seth Green as Chris defends his show for airing a SW parody before Family Guy), so I thought I'd give it a try.  The format was not what I expected.  It consists of unrelated clips hooked together that span all three of the early Star Wars films.  It is not a straight parody like Family Guy.  Some of the sketches are clever like an extended look at the day Ponda Baba (aka Walrus Man) got his arm cut off by Obi-Wan Kenobi's light sabre in that bar, how Darth Vader strangles people without touching them, and GW Bush as a jedi.  I like that ""your mama's so fat, Jabba the Hut..."" joke when Luke took on the emperor. There are also Star Wars-related commercials.  Other sketches just were not funny to me and the extras, as I mentioned, are only for the most ardent Robot Chicken fan.  There are 7 commentaries!  I guess it's just me as so many praise this episode to the hilt, but I just don't see the greatness that would warrant so much analysis.

My only complaints with this DVD are that the show was too short and that the menus were a bit more to manage than I like.  Lots of clicking before I get to the show.

This special has some of the funniest bits they've ever done on Robot Chicken and is well worth the price.  The extras are amazing, it even has 7 different commentaries.

There's a couple of storyboarded deleted scenes and let's just say, for the most part, there's a reason they were deleted.

The visual gags and blink-and-you'll-miss-them moments are incredibly funny, and the voice talent assembled (including Green, Seth MacFarlane, Mark ""Luke Skywalker"" Hamil, Ahmed ""Jar-Jar Binks"" Best, Donald Faison, Hulk Hogan, Malcolm McDowell, Joey Fatone, Breckin Meyer, Conan O'Brien, James Van Der Beek, and even George Lucas himself in a hilarious bit) is great as well.  There are some old bits from the previous two seasons of the series included here (such as President Dub-ya's lightsaber battle with Abe Lincoln) among the newly shot footage, with the only real downside of this special being that it ends.  However, this DVD release is still worth picking up thanks to the assortment of extras included, which feature interviews, trailers, and discussions of how the whole thing came together.

The review is purely for the content, about 30 Robot Chicken shorts that will leave hard core Star Wars fans rolling in the aisles.

I give this 5 stars only for the Star Wars fan, because the price of admission here is a bit steep for a DVD clocking in at just under half an hour and one that has already aired the Cartoon Network. Casual viewers think of this as a 3 star product, best rented before deciding to buy.  And it is certainly not for children.

But for the fan, the price is right and it is a must own for your collection, nestled securely next to your copy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Harvest/dp/B000YRY8CU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Harvest</a>.  The quality of these sketches are much more consistent than the normal hit or miss affair we've come to expect from Robot Chicken.  They were done for the fans, and that simple fact shines through in all of the gags and inside jokes.  Heck, creators Seth Green and Matthew Senreich even got George Lucas to play himself at a Star Wars convention -- a la William Shatner on SNL long ago.  Other notable voice talent includes Mark Hamill, Hulk Hogan, Seth Green & Seth MacFarlane, Malcolm McDowell and Conan O'Brien.

If you have seen it already, there is no reason for me to go into details.
If you HAVEN'T seen it and are a rabbid Star Wars fan, then I would not dream of spoiling any of the surprises.  As the altered opening sequence shows, was this was created with special affection just for you.

It's the fact that this DVD is only 1 episode long, and then contains a bunch of bonus features you will watch once, and probably never again. I find it hard to give higher ratings to a 20 min long feature and a heap of useless extras. Hopefully Robot Chicken will release all 3 Star Wars specials on the one disc and do away with the filler stuff, and release a decent DVD, because just as I start to get into these things, the end credits roll and I feel disappointed that it's not a feature length movie, nor at least an hour of material.

I guess now for the price of it, it's not so bad, but when it first came out it was about as expensive as buying a whole season of RC, and makes me wonder why this episode just wasn't included in a RC season as well. It just feels like a cheaply made DVD to earn a bit of cash on the side for RC, so hopefully as I said, they will combine the 3 some day for the one DVD and make something worth purchasing instead of having to keep swapping over 3 discs to watch 20 min long episodes that could all be contained on the one.

I really love Star Wars parodies, and I've seen Star Wars skits on ""Robot Chicken"" that were truly funny, so I was excited to get my hands on their official Star Wars special episode.

There's a lot of good stuff here, no doubt. Some of the best skits are the longer ones - Han's stalling tactics in the Death Star jail block, for instance, is quite droll (although I did like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Family-Guy-Blue-Harvest/dp/B000YOX3HE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Family Guy - Blue Harvest</a>&nbsp;marginally more, with 'Han' turning the stall into a radio advice call-in show), and the cantina scene (and background) of the poor alien who loses his arm to Obi Wan is completely hilarious. And who can forget the extended skit with Darth Sidious, taking Vader's call from his escape pod? Pure awesomeness.

For all that, though, the DVD is a touch expensive for what you're getting. Most of this is available in various forms online, and several of the really good Robot Chicken Star Wars skits aren't included here (presumably because they were done after the Star Wars special episode). Some of the skits are quick throw-aways, such as the ""Luke and Leia in bed the morning after"" (""That was so wrong..."", she says) skit that, okay, it's kind of a chuckle moment, but not really that great.

I'm not saying you shouldn't see this movie - it's definitely worth a view, just that you might want to save you money and just look for a rental or online content until this come down to something more reasonable. The DVD extras, in my opinion, aren't really thrilling enough to commit to a buy, but more devoted Robot Chicken fans may feel differently.

The first film came out the year I was born, so by the third one I was already collecting the action figures (they still sit somewhere in a shoebox in my parents' garage, and they'd be waiting to provide me a fortune some day if I hadn't taken them out of the packages).  As a result of this, Star Wars has always held a larger significance for me than most other film series.

Maybe that's why I find this set of skits featuring star wars action figures to be much funnier than it has any right to be.  The characters and situations being shown are so familiar, so ingrained in my memory, that even subtle tweaking of these icons is just hilarious.  From Walrusman's bad day (my favorite skit here - poor Walrus was just suckerpunched by fate the day he ran into Luke) to the Emperor's frustration over the destruction of his Death Star (his final ""I love you"" to Darth Vader over the phone is priceless), the original skit material made me laugh so hard I was almost teary-eyed.  The bonus features are nice too, and expand the disc to a regulation-length.

I got my copy used on here for $4 and it was worth that many times over for the Walrusman skit alone.  If you're at all a fan of Star Wars, and Spaceballs (and Family Guy: Blue Harvest) left you thirsting for more Star Wars-related humor, look no further.",1235952000,,1378,4.376470588235295

As you can probably tell all of the clips that hooked me were missing. I bought this disc as I thought it would be a good collection to have, but it was luke warm at best. I think I laughed at about three of the clips. I have a feeling that all of the missing clips will be contained within the season box sets. Wish I hadn't wasted my time on this set, $3 per clip that made me laugh just wasn't worth it.

Watch the clips on Adult Swim and I hope the Box sets are better.

Robot chicken's regular episodes tend to be somewhat ""hit and miss"" with the short segments, but this collection of Star Wars bits are all amusing at least and some are laugh out loud funny. We actually ended up watching this 3 times in row and saw something we missed each time.

This collection is only about 23 minutes long, and there are a number of clip out on the web that are not included here, but this is worth every penny.
I should mention that it is from Cartoon Network's ADULT Swim.  It's not flagrantly R-rated, or anything, but there are a few moments that you might not want your children to see.  Nothing bad, but certainly PG-13 in places.  For example, there's one scene when Boba Fett is flirting with/coming on to Han Solo, when he's frozen in carbonite.  There are also a number of times when various characters use ""swear"" words that get bleeped out.  You hear only a tiny part of the word before it bleeps out, but you know what they're saying.  Again, maybe not a big deal for some people, but you might be uncomfortable watching with your kids.  Definitely review it first if you are at all sensitive to that kind of content.

This is definitely a DVD all Star Wars or Robot Chicken fans (or both) can appreciate and love.",1220745600,,620,4.4035087719298245

I could go on and on about this product but mainly if you love Star Wars, pop culture and crazy clay animation, you need this in your collection. Two thumbs up and you will laugh every time you watch it. Also I recommend the Family Guy Star Wars DVD, Blue Harvest if you liked this one as well.",1220054400,,405,4.2727272727272725

 My only complaint is that I wish it was longer, a half-hour did not seem to be nearly enough...BUT, there is a bit of commentary on the DVD to watch as well.
 Overall, I did enjoy the parody and look forward to future seasons of RC!",1219968000,,342,4.08955223880597

3328019,4,B0012Q3T6S,"I really would like to be able to enjoy robot Chicken on a regular basis. Unfortunately they tend to go political and also make fun of Jesus a little too much for me. But that's a personal opinion and I know not everyone will agree with it. Suffice it to say I don't watch it very often any more.

That being said, Robot Chicken Star Wars is hilarious. I saw the Family Guy Blue Harvest special and just wasn't impressed. Robot Chicken's romp in the Star Wars universe, though, was fairly imaginative and clever. I really just couldn't stop laughing.

Seth Green and Co. are real Star Wars fans and it shows throughout this video. The only complaint were two sequences that were just less funny than the rest. One being the George Bush scene where he believes he's a Jedi. The main reason for it being not as funny is because it just went on for too long. I found myself wishing they'd just go back to the Star Wars figures. The other scene was the Boba Fett talking to the Han Solo in carbonite. While funny and portraying Fett as creepy it still just went on too long after getting it's point across.

The rest of it was even funnier than those scenes. But again, much too short. I know how hard and time consuming stunt motion capture is, so I'm just grateful we got what we did.

I'd buy it if I were you.",1219881600,,1309,4.287449392712551

Senator Palpatine sketch is an instant classic and should be seen by anyone who claims to be a fan of either Robot Chicken or Star Wars.",1219622400,,304,4.410714285714286
3328022,2,B0012Q3T6S,"Well, there is a lot of extras on this disc which is good because the 22-minute show isn't much.  The bad thing, though, is the extras aren't much either.  They mostly consist of the creators and writers goofing around.  The deleted scenes are just drawings with audio.  This DVD was my first look at Robot Chicken.  It was mentioned at the end of the Family Guy ""Blue Harvest"" episode (it's funny that Seth Green as Chris defends his show for airing a SW parody before Family Guy), so I thought I'd give it a try.  The format was not what I expected.  It consists of unrelated clips hooked together that span all three of the early Star Wars films.  It is not a straight parody like Family Guy.  Some of the sketches are clever like an extended look at the day Ponda Baba (aka Walrus Man) got his arm cut off by Obi-Wan Kenobi's light sabre in that bar, how Darth Vader strangles people without touching them, and GW Bush as a jedi.  I like that ""your mama's so fat, Jabba the Hut..."" joke when Luke took on the emperor. There are also Star Wars-related commercials.  Other sketches just were not funny to me and the extras, as I mentioned, are only for the most ardent Robot Chicken fan.  There are 7 commentaries!  I guess it's just me as so many praise this episode to the hilt, but I just don't see the greatness that would warrant so much analysis.  The re-watchability of this show is very low.",1219536000,,1401,4.37984496124031
3328023,5,B0012Q3T6S,"A wonderful program for the Star Wars fan.  It reminded me of the times I would sit with my friends in high school and college, joking about all of our favorite films.  This program took those goof-off sessions and made them a reality.  There were several commentaries to enjoy as well from all sorts of different participants.  My only complaints with this DVD are that the show was too short and that the menus were a bit more to manage than I like.  Lots of clicking before I get to the show.  Even though it is short, I have to give it five stars though for content and entertainment value.",1219449600,,594,4.3545454545454545

I'm familiar enough that I get most of the (obvious at least) jokes, and its certainly given me a new found respect for Admiral Ackbar.  This special has some of the funniest bits they've ever done on Robot Chicken and is well worth the price.  The extras are amazing, it even has 7 different commentaries.  Bottom line, if you love Robot Chicken, you need this DVD and if you've never heard of Robot Chicken then this is a great introduction to it.  Now with any luck the writers are working on a Robot Chicken Doctor Who special.  Just remember one thing, ""ITS A TRAP.""",1219449600,,703,4.369230769230769

I highly recommend this.  It was fun for those who really knew the movies and fun for those who didn't.  It makes me want to check out the other DVDs of this series.",1219449600,,505,4.01

On the other hand, if you have a sense of humor, buy this.  It's close to the funniest thing I have ever seen.  It helps if you like twisted humor.  Robot Chicken probably offends some people.

This is laugh out funny stuff.

If you watch the extras, which are mostly worth watching, you will realize how much time and effort they put into this.  Of course the air this show somewhat frequently, but the extras, and the higher quality video probably make this worth it for $10 (which is what I paid.)

For $10 the DVD is definately worth it! What it lacks in actual show time it makes up for with the extras. There are some great behind the scenes features that show just how much work they put into making the show and how incredibly crazy you'd have to be to do stop motion animation.
There's a couple of storyboarded deleted scenes and let's just say, for the most part, there's a reason they were deleted.
Another great thing is the Chicken Nuggets where you can watch the show and at some parts click on the icon that comes up to see a video commentary on what you're watching.",1217289600,3,668,4.352

I've always found Robot Chicken to be hit-and-miss, but I expected more from this highly-touted episode.

Now, if you find yourself among the folks who DID like it, you'll be thrilled by all the extras.  Personally, I don't think this very average piece of work warrants so many bonus features.",1216944000,6,833,5.723577235772358

3328043,5,B0012Q3T6S,"Anyone who's watched Robot Chicken knows that creator Seth Green and his crew are big time Star Wars geeks, which makes this marriage of Star Wars and Robot Chicken all the more sensible.  Robot Chicken: Star Wars is a half-hour special of shorts and skits that pay wonderful, hilarious homage to the phenomenon that is Star Wars, by poking fun at characters and memorable scenes from entire series.  The visual gags and blink-and-you'll-miss-them moments are incredibly funny, and the voice talent assembled (including Green, Seth MacFarlane, Mark ""Luke Skywalker"" Hamil, Ahmed ""Jar-Jar Binks"" Best, Donald Faison, Hulk Hogan, Malcolm McDowell, Joey Fatone, Breckin Meyer, Conan O'Brien, James Van Der Beek, and even George Lucas himself in a hilarious bit) is great as well.  There are some old bits from the previous two seasons of the series included here (such as President Dub-ya's lightsaber battle with Abe Lincoln) among the newly shot footage, with the only real downside of this special being that it ends.  However, this DVD release is still worth picking up thanks to the assortment of extras included, which feature interviews, trailers, and discussions of how the whole thing came together.  All in all, Robot Chicken: Star Wars is a sheer blast, and even if you're only a fan of one or the other, you'll surely enjoy this.",1216771200,13,1338,5.0636363636363635

- Two hours of extra features, including deleted scenes, commentary, animation meeting, panel presentations, alternate audio and more.
- Terrific presentation of the original show. It even sounds as though the music to dialogue level has been adjusted on the ""Empire On Ice"" sketch so that the hilarious lyrics to the songs are much more audible and clear than they were when originally shown on TV.

At less than $10, this DVD is absolutely worth it. A great entertainment value for the price. Even the blurbs on the back of the DVD case are entertaining.",1216684800,29,709,4.582677165354331
