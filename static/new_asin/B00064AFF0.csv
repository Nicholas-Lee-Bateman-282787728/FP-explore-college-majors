2166701,2,B00064AFF0,"So they are naked.  That isn't enough to watch this thing. If you are into extremely beautiful men and explicitly gay-themed independent movies. SUGAR, GRANDE ECOLE and NEVERLAND (the gay themed Peter Pan - NOT the Johnny Depp movie!) are far more impressive.  Even NEVERLAND's prison/bondage thing at the end with the lost boys tied up and in jail is sexier than this.  Just because guys are naked doesn't make it hot.",1114905600,5,419,4.791666666666667
2166702,3,B00064AFF0,"The first thing that strikes you about this film is that it can't decide whether it's soft porn or a sexy drama. It's filed on video, (albeit with single camera) and the sound and music are a little poor; just like cheap porn! On the plus side, there's a love story, and the lead, Dennis, is very attractive. It's shot in a disused prison, so no wobbly studio sets; but there's a lack of attention to detail, eg. one prisoner has a tongue-stud (unlikely to be allowed) and there's a distinct lack of discipline. The DVD extra's include a lengthy interview with the two lead actors, I found this more interesting than the feature and shows an insight into such a film making process, if you're interested!",1111968000,12,704,4.551181102362205
2166703,3,B00064AFF0,Its ok... The story is fine but the acting from one of the main characters is completely weak. (lots of frontal nudity).,1109635200,7,120,4.5
2166704,3,B00064AFF0,"The black character says he's American, but he has the most obvious British accent in the world.  He can't speak a word of German, yet the couple seem to understand each other.  With all the Black American soldiers in Germany, the director is telling the viewers he couldn't find a single Black American who spoke German (or could take a crash course) to play this role?  Further, the black guy is kinda queeny.  I don't think he would survive in an American jail.  Yet in this film, he is DA MAN, and both white German prisoners and officers are in awe of him.  This movie is a watered-down ""Oz"" written by some German who's obviously worships us brothas.  And worse, the English subtitles were riddled with spelling errors.  That only added to the campiness of the film.",1104537600,75,772,4.583941605839416
2166705,5,B00064AFF0,"Okay, so this movie takes place in some strange gay fantasy prison world where everyone is sexy and waxed (even after years in prison).  Plenty of full nudity and sex (especially in the deleted scenes), but why film actual hardcore scenes and then edit them out of the movie?  Marcel Schlutt is simply adorable in every scene.  Mike (the other male lead) unfortunately couldn't act his way out of a damp paper bag (possibly enhanced by the fact that his lines are all in English).  If you enjoy ""Oz"" you will definitely like this film.",1102809600,19,535,4.6
2166706,2,B00064AFF0,"Erotic content good (requisite shower/rape scenes with ample full frontal footage). Dramatic content NOT very good or believable.  Do German prisons really allow inmates to choose their cellmates and to set up housekeeping as lovers? Attractive actors. The ""special features"" interview with the 2 lead actors is very ""honest"" and worth listening to to hear their views on porn.  Apparently the sex scenes are ""hardcore"" according to the actors, although the scenes appear to have been edited--perhaps for the US release?",1100822400,80,520,5.407407407407407

2166729,5,B00064AFF0,"Beyond Sexual.  It looks like a porn with the sex cut out - and low and behold - after you watch this, if it left you wanting more, and sexually edging, there are actually all the actually real sexual interactions between the actors in a different film. It's a secret wish, admit it. You always want a film to trigger your imagination, and now you have it. Watch it, then watch . . Cazzo films - Eingelocht === it's all there. the real thing. They shot the PORN version first, which of course is not available here (go to Cazzo) and  created a soft core version of the actual story, which is certainly a relatively weak but still sexy prison love story.

2166755,4,B00064AFF0,"I've watched a couple of times already, and I plan on watching it a few more times before the rental is up. Okay, the acting may not be Oscar worthy, but I've seen worse; It's believable enough for the circumstance. I think it turns into a tear jerker the moment Dennis finds out his mother is trying to get him out earlier. You can see him struggling with himself: wanting to be free, and not wanting to be free. If there's ONE thing I walked away with from this film, is the fact that these two men are soul mates. One can no longer be without the other. And not to mention how damn HOT it is!! I've watched the deleted sex scene during their last night together, and it's...... no words. This movie is definitely worth the rental fee, the time spent watching it, and the tears shed because of it.",1447113600,,799,4.2631578947368425

2166771,4,B00064AFF0,"After twelve years of its releasing, the freshness of this film can be considered one more proof of the theory that independent gay cinema has much to offer to Hollywood. One more example of technical development in the language of cinema, it does not fear to show sex scenes in a climate of sensible love.
Rough sex is adequate to the ambiance of the film: rudeness, fear, anger, drugs.  The sex scenes are hardly inadequate to this world, where men do sex with other man as a way of passing time, frequently in rude ways
One paragraph of spoiler ad to the value of the film: the relatively happy ending, and mostly the conquist by the couple of a niddle in the space of the cells seems to indulgent.
The interpretations are sore. Sauf Charlie Schmutt, actors hardly can deliver their lines. Schumutt chose a way of interpreting  that valorizes his curly angel body, and gets easily the simphaty  of the public.
In the end, its a simple low budget film that shows that sex is so much, or even more, important than violence in prisions, and offently come combined. Hollywood is good at showing violence, but lacks the sex.",1440028800,,1122,4.6

2166799,3,B00064AFF0,"If you can get past the low budget production and the you've heard better dialogue in other movies part then this movie was not that bad. Two men from different parts of life meet in prison and fall in love. One man inexperienced with men and the prison life finds himself attracted to another man who knows the ins and out of the prison system while serving a long time sentence.
Fighting thugs, crooked guards and a by the book and not willing to bed warden the two men find themselves inseparable even beyond the bars. The movie has a lot of nice frontal nudity and as you can expect in a prison movie some cruel brutality.
Overall not a bad movie with a nice twist at the end that proves that love knows no bounds literally.",1424390400,3,728,4.321167883211679

2166802,4,B00064AFF0,"I enjoyed this movie, despite its myriad flaws. The main character, Dennis, is played well by Marcel Schlutt. I wish I could say the same for many of the other characters, including the second main character, Mike, played by Mike Sale. In the movie, Mike is supposed to be an American from New York, but his British accent belies that. He doesn't even seem to try to affect an American accent. And while he has been in a German prison for many years, he purports to have us believe he cannot speak German -- this while Dennis speaks to him almost exlusively in German, while he converses almost exclusively in English. I speak and understand German, but the constant back and forth between the two languages was at times quite unsettling. Mike claims to understand a lot of German (who wouldn't after so many years in a a German lockup), but does not speak it very well! R.I.G.H.T.!!!  One needs to be warned that there is a LOT of nudity and sex in the movie, and in some regards that is refreshing, since American puritanical attitudes about the male nude body thankfully do not matter in a German film. But if you are one of those Americans who feel that nudity in film is somehow dirty, then this movie is not for you. There is also a violent rape scene, that many might find very unsettling to watch. But it IS a movie about prisoners in a German penitentiary. You make up your own mind. For the most part the English translations in the subtitles are spot on, though I did find some of them  a bit off the mark from time to time. The variance from the spoken German was not so bad as to make the translation completely off base.",1421539200,2,1634,4.4072847682119205
2166803,4,B00064AFF0,"I just  watched this again.  I'd forgot that I'd seen in 10+ years ago.  I had forgotten the plot.  It's a love story, set in the brutality of a german prison.  I enjoyed the story and a number of performances.  The sex scenes are sexy.  The violence is pretty brutal.  Worth seeing.",1420588800,,283,4.3076923076923075

2166805,5,B00064AFF0,Great movie...sufficient  frontal nudity and a good plot. My boyfriend and I loved it! Of course we are kinda partial to prison movies as we met in prison. Yea! for real! Louisiana prisons aren't as depicted in this film. But all in all it was a very good prison flick.,1418947200,,269,4.38

2166810,4,B00064AFF0,"This movie isn't the greatest movie but it's not bad either.

From the wee bit that can be seen in the extra ""Deleted Scenes"", we haven't missed too much, anyway.  I must say that what we do see of Marcel Schlutt is very easy on the eye, indeed.

Set in a German male prison, this is a particularly bad take on Oz-style gay male prison fantasies; though to say so is an insult to that HBO series, which at least had some good acting and interesting psychological situations to recommend it. This has neither, nor any other redeeming qualities. ""Locked Up"" comes across as what your average, run-of-the-mill middle-class gay white-boy with a lite S&M/B&D fetish, along with his Snow Queen boyfriend, would fantasize about as a world of sex-deprived virile young men would be like.

Cute actors, nice characters, but overall something is always missing. In most cases, there's no excuse for the terrible acting, directing, et cetera...  But this movie certainly has an excuse!!!
I became aware of this movie after watching Eingelocht, (yeah, for those who don't know it by now it's porn!), most of the CAZZO film releases are good, you might say they are all little masterpieces of gay pornography as far as porn goes. So it's almost like a real movie with pornographic scenes. When I saw the trailer for Locked Up, I was quite surprised to see familiar faces. You can't forget the main character, he's so cute! So I decided to give it a chance & bought the movie on DVD. The movie on its own isn't that good, I confess, but with the original Eingelocht (which I also have on DVD) it's watchable! It completes the whole picture. It's almost like an extra DVD, but published separately.
Well, what I want to say is that you cannot blame the makers, for taking a chance & publishing this as a separate DVD release. You can see that the actors are doing their best, but everybody know not all porn actors are ""really"" actors & they don't really act. But at least they are trying. The good thing is, they look great at trying!
In general it depends on you! First watch Eingelocht & then give this move a chance. You'll be pleasantly surprised as well as satisfied! You could do it vice versa [watch Locked up & then Eingelocht], that way you could see the actors you liked going all the way & you don't have to imagine the rest.

2166912,5,B00064AFF0,"Ok, so I was watching this movie on Netflix and noticed that while the story was interesting, there was something wrong with the setting.  I couldn't put my finger on it, there was something ""different""... I really enjoyed the story, even though the acting was OFF, but just the same, it wasn't bad acting -like Ben Afleck in the movie ""DareDevil"". It was another kind of ""Bad Acting"". So I go to the Review section on Netflix where someone alerts us all, that Locked Up, is a cut up version of a Gay Porno Film called ""In The Hole"".  So I purchased ""In The Hole"" and LO AND BEHOLD, it is true. Locked Up is just a porno film minus the graphic sex.  WOW. In The Hole is the movie Locked Up, with all of the scenes that LETS FACE IT, you really want to see.  But don't skip Locked Up and just buy ""In The Hole"". ""In The Hole"" is not the complete story and it is NOT in english. Buy both, it really completes the collection. You really don't see the WHOLE movie unless own both versions.

2166915,4,B00064AFF0,"This movie is in mixed language--English and German. Most of it is in German. But it is easy to follow. I really enjoyed it even though I don't speak German. The plot is very good. It is not boring at all. The guys are very good looking with nice bodies. There is a good amount of frontal nudity. They try to give good shots of the naked, nicely built guys.

I can't criticize this movie because I don't know if my experience was due to the Amazon's VIDEO ON DEMAND rental or if it was the movie itself. I will criticize ON DEMAND below. But my problem with the video was that although you got good shots of the men's bodies (and quite often), the details of their genitals were not clear--such as the distinction between the head and the shaft. It was hard telling for sure who was circumcised and who was not. So those details were not clear. But their bodies were nice and I enjoyed the movie anyway.

The movie contains one rape scene, sodomy, several masturbation scenes, and nice shower scenes. I don't remember seeing any oral sex. The sodomy scenes were rare.

Subtitles appear whether you want them to or not. There are no options. They only appear when English is NOT being spoken. Sometimes they get in the way and at least with the HORRIBLE ON DEMAND VERSION, they are sometimes Impossible to read!

******** BEWARE OF THE ON DEMAND VERSION *******************************************************

Amazon's VIDEO ON DEMAND is not good. I certainly WOULD NOT buy a video through them at the prices they want. The quality is HORRIBLE!

1) I've watched 2 movies with ON DEMAND neither one was clear. I thought I'd try another to be sure it was NOT the movie. The pictures are not sharp and you may have to spend time adjusting the lighting to get the best picture.

2) Although the UnBox player will allow you to maximize the picture to fill the screen, the resolution Amazon provides is not good enough to benefit from the feature. They give you just enough but nothing more. When i maximized the screen, the movie was HORRIBLE. I could not tell the different between the people and the white wall behind them. Sunlight or any type of light was too bright and prevented the people from being seen.  So the movie has to be watched without the greatest possible viewing space.

3) The subtitles weren't always legible because of the bad resolution and quality of the downloads. Don't expect the picture to be BETTER than the preview online. I thought that downloading the movie would be at a higher resolution thereby providing a better quality than the quick preview. I WAS WRONG!

4) There was no option for subtitles. You have very little control over the movie.

Unless you want something quick or you want to sample the movie before buying it, I don't recommend using ON DEMAND rental and certianly NOT for purchase!

If you don't use it, they will either ditch it or provide better quality!",1265846400,2,2904,4.61747572815534

2166939,3,B00064AFF0,"This film is more than a bit amateurish, and not particularly well acted.  The plot, such as it is, is standard prison fare, and offers nothing fresh in the way of insight, plot or situation.  If you are looking for some soft-core gay porno with an entirely disposable plot, you may find that it's worth the investment, but I wouldn't describe it as much more than that.  Both leads are fairly nice looking, but I am tired of gay video producers who think all they need to ""sell the product"" are pretty faces and developed muscles.

Also, if you're going to present a character as someone who was born in the US and raised in NYC, it's not a good idea to cast someone with a thick cockney accent, as the producers did with the black character here.  There are those film buffs who seem to be satisfied as long as a gay film has sexy people or situations, and I am weary of video productions that take this for granted.

I agree with the reviewer who suggested that you make sure to watch the ""interview"" section of the special features - it's a hoot.  The two leads confess that they were really having sex in the sex scenes (something I've never heard of in a non-porno film).  In fact, the white guy didn't seem to be very sure whether or not this is a porno film, while the other clearly cared only about his paycheck.  Really funny moments occur in the interviews when the white guy relates that things really heated up when he confessed to his co-star that he has fantasies about having sex with black men.  In the next interview, the black guy says everything was fine until his co-star confessed his fantasies, and it's a real turn-off for him when white men approach him and say they have fantasies about black guys.  This opposite banter was actually more fun than the movie, and almost made the purchase worthwhile for me.",1224892800,,1832,4.455089820359281

I am not sure where this prison is supposed to be, but it's very inconsistent. Some people have coffeemakers and can wear piercings. Some practically have an apartment, while others have just a bench and sink. A gang or two of rough guys has free roam. The guards seem to be involved with some of the prisoners, but it's difficult to tell, and there's some kind of drug-trade theme going on. But the story is so disjoint and clunky that you can't follow this easily.

Don't even think this movie is ""hot."" It's not rough prison sex, there is no chemistry between any of them, and the production values are so low you might as well get drunk and just laugh at the film.",1197590400,,941,4.465116279069767

2166945,2,B00064AFF0,"Mike Sale (the British black guy playing an American) is the worst thing in this movie. Apart from being hopelessly miscast (ie: the English accent and about as tough as a powder puff) he cannot act his way out of a paper bag. Apparently he is an artist - well hopefully he is better at that than acting.

I struggle to see why he was cast in the role. The cast interviews on the dvd show him saying he disagreed with the director and was accused of being a diva on set - so why on earth didn't they fire him and get someone else?!

Mike Sale ruins every scene he is in and if someone else had been in the role, the movie might have been much better than it is.  Sure it is your typical cliche prison movie (shower nudity,pack-rape scene, etc) but Marcel Schlutt is gorgeous and plays his role convincingly.  (Be sure to watch the cast interviews as he looks much sexier in those with his short hair!)

The other thing I found a bit odd was that the ""big sex scene"" that the two actors talk about in their interviews is actually cut from the movie!  It is there in the deleted scenes, but I can't see why the director left it out - its abscence leaves the final farewell lovemaking scene look like something out of some sloppy Danielle Steel miniseries - especially the dreadful after sex cuddle!

If you buy this as part of the 3 movie 'Guilty Pleasures' set it is great value for money and there are some nice cock and body shots in the movie (especially the masterbation scenes), but don't set your expectations too high - because of Mike Sale it is pretty bad!",1186704000,4,1564,4.28135593220339

I found it enjoyable to see such a fantastical tale of prison romance (and the explicit sex scenes between men were not bad either).  At the same time, I tend to agree with the other reviewers when they say that there was not enough in either category, drama or porn, to latch on to.

I was saddened to see that these actors seemed to think they were in a porn first as opposed to a movie that had great potential to have well developed plot, characters, and settings.  Some people might have even related to the idea that love can occur in the least likely of places.  But the acting level was elementary school play at best, and it kind of subtracted from the story (and I found it was easier to just focus on the scantily clad bodies messing around on screen rather than try and glean something from the scene itself).

I saw, very briefly, that the director, whether he wanted to or not, set up a wonderful dichotomy between the stereotypical prison homosexual and the actual homosexual.  The ""love"" that existed between the tougher inmates and their ""punk"" was used to demonstrate the rough nature of the prison itself (although I will admit, it was quite a strange prison with rather lax rules and regulations... especially for Germany) and was based more on a sodomitical need to dominate (as are most prison ""romances""), whereas the connection between the main characters was more along the lines of an actually love story.

The ""romantic gaze"" when the 2 prisoners see each other was ackward and unless you know that's what it's supposed to be you'd think they were crusing or maybe just slow.

2166966,3,B00064AFF0,"German Caucasian Dennis (Marcel Schlutt) gets sent to a German prison for credit-card fraud and falls for Mike (Mike Sale), an African American (?) who is serving a sentence of fifteen years for murdering his wife. What you expect in a prison movie is here: the gang cliques, the drug activity, the violence, the crooked guards and of course more sex than on a Saturday in a New Orleans House of Prostitution.

Although this film is not rated, there is frontal and backal nudity galore, some S & M activity-- for instance, a scene where the bigger, stonger inmates line up and spit on one of their ""punks""-- visual masturbation and a gang rape. So is the movie pornographic? You be the judge. Pornography, for my money, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. A supreme court justice once said he couldn't define pornography but he knew it when he saw it. The photographer Tom Bianchi would say that whether or not something is pornographic depends on the artistic ability of the artist. Certainly Robert Mapplethorpe photographed and exhibited in world class galleries images that make some of these look tame by comparison.

Not everybody acts in this film. Some of the men obviously got cast, not for their acting prowess, but for their bodies or perhaps only men with buffed bodies go to German prisons. Marcel Schlutt as Dennis has his moments. The ending, however, is a quite a stretch. This movie probably is one for watching on a cold, winter night.",1131148800,18,1461,4.7254901960784315

Watch the interviews with the two main characters and you'll learn that they were actually having real sex in this movie! Which is surprising because it doesn't appear to be real sex. But anyway, in the interviews, Marcel Schlutt reveals that he has a fetish for black men and he tells this to Mike Sale who is rightfully offended by him. Mike is then put off by Marcel but remains friendly with him. But both men say it was difficult working together. Mike jokingly says the best thing about making this movie for him was getting paid. He tells a lot about how he felt the director was a ""monster"" and Marcel also talks about how difficult he was to work with. Both men discuss their respect for pornography and how much they enjoy being in porn. Mike has never been in a movie before and Marcel has only had a few tiny roles.

As for the movie itself, it is extremely unrealistic but who cares? Mike is a terrible actor but Marcel is surprisingly very good. He could go on to bigger and better roles. Mike was just painful to watch. And some of the stuff in this movie is unintentionally funny. It's worth a rental for sure!",1127606400,25,1196,4.36322869955157
2166980,4,B00064AFF0,It was very refreshing to watch a gay movie that actually had gay actors.  The movie had an interesting plot which was believable. There were only two things that I considered to be on the downside - a black American in a German prison.  The second being that after watching the interviews with the stars realized that they had actually had sex this movie should have been rated XXX and went ahead and shown the actual sex scenes.  This is what happens in prisons and the character Denis apparently wanted nothing to be cut out of this movie. I have watched this movie at least 20 times.,1126396800,3,587,4.4672897196261685
2166981,2,B00064AFF0,"The editorial calls this movie a german style ""Oz"". Well, they both take place in a prison, but that's where the similiarities end. ""Oz"" has talented actors, imaginative story lines, high quality production. ""Lock Up"" has penises!

The movie looks like it was filmed with a camcorder the director borrowed from his mom. As for the actors, I can imagine the casting director going to a Berlin leather bar one Saturday night and saying, ""Who wants to be in a movie""?

The annoying thing about this film is that whether you're looking for a good story line, or hoping for a bit of gay porn, you're going to be frustrated either way. It would probably suit a closeted married guy who can claim that ""It's just a german art movie"" should his wife find it hidden in his sock draw.",1126051200,4,774,4.521428571428571
2166982,4,B00064AFF0,"GEFANGEN (LOCKED UP) is a testy little German film that dares to push the envelope of NR rating, and given the concept of the story and the background of the writer/director J&ouml;rg Andreas making his first legitimate (ie non-porn) movie, it succeeds despite some technical shortcomings.  No, it is not a film for those with issues concerning same-sex films, but for the target gay audience and for that audience eager to see innovative independent filmmaking adventures, LOCKED UP  is well worth watching!

The setting is a prison somewhere in Germany and the story begins with the handcuffed young credit card fraud 'criminal' Dennis (Marcel Schlutt) encountering his first entry into a prison.  The tone of the film is set at the induction desk where Dennis is stripped and zealously 'inspected!' by the eager prison guards. He is then placed in a cell and begins his two-year prison term.  Naturally the other prisoners (all body builders) on his bloc intimidate him into submission to their rules of the house.  Through his cell window Dennis gazes on a fellow inmate, an African American hunk named Mike (Mile Sale),  in prison for a fifteen-year sentence for the murder of his wife, digging trenches.  They make eye contact and there is a mutual interest.  Gradually the two meet under the rigid time frames for the prisoners, talk, share coffee in Mike's room, and eventually respond to their mutual attraction. During one interlude they are observed by a guard envious of Mike's attention and affection for Dennis. And as the routine prison dramas go, the inmates polarize over the two men's connection.  Dennis is brutally raped, talked into cooperating with the drug ring, but Dennis' growing love for Mike is stronger than the resistance of both inmates and prison officials and they are eventually able to share a cell.

Dennis' mother visits her son, encourages him, and arranges for a lawyer to gain a shortened term for Dennis, a favor that Dennis greets with mixed emotions, as he does not want to leave his lover Mike as others have done.  But in a tender scene Mike convinces Dennis that he is young and should accept the early release, an act of love that Dennis finally accepts.  Dennis is released, but continues to visit Mike whom he loves and his love is reciprocated.  The manner in which the film ends is yet another act of sacrifice and love and is best left unsaid.

Both Marcel Schlutt and Mike Sale are handsome of face and body and spirit and the story benefits from their on-screen chemistry.

In an extended Feature on the DVD each actor (both openly gay) discusses his approach to making the film, and as in the movie itself, these dialogues are in both German and English.  The men speak frankly and bravely about their participation in gay porn movies, stating the sex scenes  in the film are real-time and not simulated.  People will argue about the propriety of this but keep in mind the story and the director's background and perhaps the film will be more readily viewed as an experimental genre.  This is a different kind of love story and I think it works!  Grady Harp, August 05",1124323200,7,3123,4.8

2166984,1,B00064AFF0,"Locked Up opens with Dennis (Marcel Schlutt) going to prison for 2 years for credit card fraud and while in prison he falls in love with Mike (Mike Sale) who is serving 15 year for murder. The supposing dilemma comes from Dennis leaving before Mike's time is up.

  This movie is flat out laughable soft porn that has many beautiful faces and bodies and really nothing more. The cells are the size of dorm rooms and have funishing like lamps, radios, televisions and coffe makers to name a few. Some of the prisoners are wearing uniforms and some are not, not to mention I think most prisons would have you remove your piecings both the belly and the penis. The movie only becomes more ludicrous as the two fall in love after having five minute quikies in a cell. Several scenes were diturbing like the guy that was drenched in spit and the shower rape scene. If all this wasn't bad enough when you get to the last scene of this movie, and see how it ends you'll want the writer, director and producer locked up and the key thrown away.",1118016000,44,1036,4.4136125654450264
2166985,2,B00064AFF0,"Shot on digital video with a budget that might buy you a nice lunch, Locked Up is a by-the-numbers story.  There wasn't a plot point you couldn't see coming, even if you haven't seen Oz.  While everyone involved gets full marks for trying, this is only one or two steps above an amateur effort--not a bad effort, but amateur none-the-less.  The predictable script aside, the other element that really robs it of any punch is the fact that all the punches are so badly performed.  With the exception of the shower scene, the violence is badly performed, so what is supposed to be brutal comes across as amusing.  I can't say that I really hated this movie (Marcel Schlutt has enough charisma to carry the film), it's not one that I would recommend to anyone--not because it's out and out bad, but becuase it's not really good.

Remember those, back in the 60s and 70s? And for some reason they have become just about extinct in American feature movies. This is a very well done sexploitation movie. Most modern, supposed Grindhouse"" movies are NOTHING like this. Most of them are fake and steal only stylistic elements of the movement, ignoring the actual elements that make it a Grindhouse-type movie. Weird, right? But thats what we have today. Why are most of them today fake? Simple. The producers/directors simply don't have the guts to do it right. So, here we finally see a modern day producer/director and lead actor with enough bravdo to do something this provocative and do the RIGHT way. Very well done, it's a very sexy movie. The lead actress was awesome. Well casted. She is beautiful and can actually act! I give her and the director a lot of credit for bringing actual skills and being bold enough to do something risky/risque!
