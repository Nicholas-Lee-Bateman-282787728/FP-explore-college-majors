3445519,5,B001A3EMTQ,"What it's not - A Blu-Ray version of Aloha.
What it is - A version of Aloha that shows extended shots and more footage of Elvis that we've seen before.

It definitely seems like it was meant for the large screen in an arena. If you watch it with that in mind I think you'll really enjoy it. I know I did. I am an Elvis fan and I certainly enjoyed the footage I had never seen before. It really does a good job showing you what the crowd in Hawaii saw on this historic anniversary.",1397174400,3,480,4.0
3445520,5,B001A3EMTQ,"This is for the die hard Elvis fan, could get more stars like 10 for the rating.
Was a really nice evening watching this DVD, My wife enjoyed her birthday Christmas Present.",1390348800,,173,4.4375
3445521,2,B001A3EMTQ,"I was very disappointed in this video...Not what I expected, the 3 screen format was hard to watch. Would not recommend this version.  Older filming of actual concert was much better.",1388534400,13,183,4.903225806451613
3445522,3,B001A3EMTQ,"..while I always love the service at ShopElvis.com I must say I was disappointed with the 40th Anniversary Aloha DVD release.

I am accepting of the fact that the holdout of a proper blu-ray release of Aloha (and also '68 comeback and others) is clearly a cash grab to keep releasing 'new updated deluxe' editions.  And that's true all over the business so 'shop elvis' should not really be held solely responsible...however, this release was clearly a poorly presented 'easy' product to toss out there.  A simple dvd burn of the 40th anniversary event as it appeared at the honolulu center live which clearly was meant for the BIG screen...not a dvd release. The multi angles disconcerting in this format and the sound was actually transferred with error.  The rear back right speaker emits NO sound at all..only one speaker of surround sound works..tested on multiple systems.  ...only works with a fake multi speaker audio option on.  The deluxe edition of 2004 was given much more care and remains the 'ultimate' aloha to this point...however by 2013 it is truly sad there still isn't a proper blu-ray release of Aloha..as well as '68 and That's The Way...On Tour deserves a more 'special' edition as well but as I'm happy enough it came out in blu-ray format at all, i won't nitpick here.",1378339200,24,1293,4.801801801801802

3445525,2,B001A3EMTQ,"I have the Aloha concert in VHS and being that VHS is outdated, my husband gave me this DVD for Christmas.  I couldn't wait to watch it!  However, I was soon very disappointed as the 3 screen layout is very annoying and does not allow you to see Elvis up close.  This edited version of the concert is not what a true Elvis fan wants and I do not recommend this version.",1419552000,3,369,4.097222222222222
