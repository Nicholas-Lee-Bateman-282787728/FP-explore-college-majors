1341620,2,B00004RCL0,"See, Colin Firth is this middle-class bloke who's really into footie, so much that He Just Can't Commit to his girlfriend. And that's it. Basicly a movie about relationships, which might be interesting except both main characters are cardboard cutouts. Not a lot of romance or humour or even football. Unless you're a diehard Arsenal supporter, I'd skip the film and go right to the book.",1005782400,3,388,4.893939393939394
1341621,5,B00004RCL0,"I just want to clarify something here. This movie is more of a drama than a romantic comedy. Sure, we see the struggle of the relationship vs soccer, but it is more about Paul inability to find solid ground in life -- not provided by soccer. It easy to understand why so many American's are disappointed with this movie because in the U.S. no sport is followed with the kind of obsession and fanaticism as soccer is in Europe. I also have to point out that the cover is a deplorable attempt to sell this movie -- the cover in Europe is different (no sex pitch :).
If you are looking for a romantic comedy with a European flavor go get ""Sliding doors"" or ""Together"".",1002672000,5,665,4.328
1341622,5,B00004RCL0,"I have read Nick Hornby's novel and finally got this movie to watch. Without a dobut, it's great as I thought it would be. Being a soccer fan for some years, I really appreciate that someone can tell my feeling about this sport that truely. And I was kind of envy Paul that his friends and families all turn out to be so supportive. What a lucky guy! Anyway, to answer one of the poster's question why that Arsenal wears yellow shirts sometimes. It's because their away shirt is yellow and black, and their home jersey is red and white. Since the last match is Liverpool versus Arsenal, and Liverpool's home jersey is red as well, in order to avoid confusions, Arsenal used their away colors.",992649600,6,692,4.5
1341623,2,B00004RCL0,"I did not enjoy this movie on the grounds that the characters were unsympathetic and boring.  At the end of this film I walked away not caring about the movie or the people in it.  The cover of the box said ""Romantic Comedy"" but the film was neither romantic or funny. Colin Firth plays an emotional ... soccer geek who hooks up with a desperate ... retentive co-worker. No passion. Nothing.",991612800,3,391,4.492957746478873
1341624,5,B00004RCL0,"I throughly enjoyed this movie.  Being a huge sports fan, including English Soccer, I related very well to the movie.  But it is more than just a sports movie, it is more about being a sports fanatic.  I have also discovered that women enjoy this movie as well.  It gives them greater understanding of the true fan and why we develop such loyalties to our favorite teams.  It also has the most exciting final game that is 100% true to history.",986688000,6,443,4.419753086419753
1341625,4,B00004RCL0,"As a Nick Hornby fan, I read ""Fever Pitch"" and found it to be very masculine. It was organized much like the sports page--match by match, sort of a statistical chronicle of Arsenal over several decades. The film, on the other hand, centers on the personal life of the football fanatic (closely based on Nick Hornby himself) and provides much more balance and intrigue.
The match-up of the serious, somewhat humorless female English teacher and the passionate-about-football but about little else male English teach is enticing. She wants to learn to loosen up and connect with her students and their parents the way she perceives he does, and he wants to be with someone attractive with backbone and spark. As played by Ruth Gemmell and Colin Firth, you see why these opposites attract and you also see why they conflict.
Despite the provocative cover, I don't see why this film is rated R. Language, maybe, and adult ideas? The sex is tame and modest, although there is an out-of-wedlock pregnancy. Still, I think this would be as good a film for the teenage sports fan as it is for adults. How passions conflict (in this case, between love and sports fanaticism) and how compromises and resolutions can be made is a worthy topic to address and is well answered in this film.",982281600,46,1276,4.752252252252252
1341626,5,B00004RCL0,"Fever Pitch is a knowing account of a man obsessed with English Soccer team Arsenal, and the difficulty he has in maintaining a satisfactory relationship yet remaining steadfastly loyal to that team.  Whilst most people enjoy sport for light entertainment and a couple hours of escapism, there are others who's life is either miserable or euphoric, depending on how their team fares.  I'm the same, substitute Arsenal/English Soccer for Collingwood/Australian Rules Football.  To quote Colin Firth ""I've spent too much time and money fretting about Arsenal when really I should be in a state about myself"".  The scene early on where a young lad attends a live soccer match, absorbing foul language, cigarette smoke and pessimistic ""supporters"" but becomes instantly hooked gives me goosebumps; it's brilliantly realised. You don't have to like soccer to appreciate this film.  If you are a fanatic about any sport, or even just know someone who goes to work on Mondays hoarse from shouting and is either sullen and unapproachable or dangerously happy souly due to the outcome of a game will relate to this film.  The book also is very good.",980985600,,1140,5.06951871657754
1341627,5,B00004RCL0,"You would never know that this was the same actor who played Darcy so fabulously well in ""Pride and Prejudice.""  He is totally convincing as a teacher whose all-consuming passion is football (soccer really because this is England).  He is in the midst of a romance with another teacher but his overriding interest in football seriously interferes with the woman in his life.  Any woman who has ever experienced this dilemma should fall totally in love with this film.  There are even many hilarious moments pertaining to this sports addiction.  The writer, Nick Hornby, also wrote ""High Fidelity"" and you can tell that the same person wrote both.  He has a very unique way of presenting men and their romantic foibles.  Firth, in this film, and John Cusack, in ""High Fidelity,"" are not your typical screen romantic heroes and they provide offbeat alternatives to all of us oddballs out there.

1341630,4,B00004RCL0,Great to see a young Mark Strong and Colin Firth!  And this film has an unusual story line; also very funny.,1397520000,,108,4.142857142857143

1341632,4,B00004RCL0,"Because of this dvd, I learned a bit to appreciate sports and the ""football"" having stayed in England for a while. It also brought warm memories. Colin Firth, my favorite, is really a true, dedicated and amazing actor to his craft. I like Ruth Gimmel's acting as well, conveying the right messages, so as to make the feelings more comprehensible.",1389139200,,346,4.783333333333333
1341633,5,B00004RCL0,"I think this is one of the most underrated films with Colin Firth. I'm not a fan of any sports, so how could I like so much a movie about a football (soccer in the US) fanatic? Well, it's more about other things: childhood attachments, love, friendship. Colin Firth proves how versatile he is as an actor. This role is on the other end of the spectrum, compared to his excellent Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice. And I still fell in in love with his Paul. Yes, he is immature, but you see that he can be caring and responsible. Ruth Gemmel is wonderful as an uptight teacher who falls in love with a football fan. I also like it for subtle English humor. And the ending is great.",1384041600,,679,4.230769230769231
1341634,5,B00004RCL0,"I like Colin Firth and I bought this movie out of curiosity with some reservations since I do not like most sports movies and I do not understand soccer.  I was greatly surprised. Colin Firth is superb. I think he is much better in this movie than even in Pride and Prejudice the quintessential chick flick. I could not believe that it was the same man. I loved the interaction between the two main characters who are so different and yet they are attracted to each other. I loved the whole school, teachers, scenes and his interactions with the students. God Forbid I even enjoyed the soccer scenes of the movie. The supporting actors are also superb specially the guy who plays his best friend. What a character!  One drawback of the movie is how his early childhood is portrayed. It took me a while to figure out that it was the main character as a young boy. But it may have been just me since I had trouble sometimes understanding the language and this DVD does not have subtitles. I later found it in Netflix (they have removed it since then) and the subtitles helped me understand some of the nuances that I had missed. All in all one rare gem of a fun movie.",1380931200,,1166,4.393518518518518
1341635,4,B00004RCL0,I liked it better than I imagined. It's not a memorable on of Colin Firth but he does his character well,1375056000,,104,4.0
1341636,3,B00004RCL0,I'm not sure if the British version of Fever Pitch came out before the American version with Jimmy Fallon but the American version is far superior to the Colin Firth movie.  I'm a big Colin Firth fan but have to say this was just an OK movie - nothing outstanding.  Fever Pitch (with Fallon) is one of my all-time favorites.  (save your money and invest it in the American version).  The basic plot details the life of a true die hard sports fan is all about.  (Firth of course being the fan).,1371859200,,493,4.315217391304348
1341637,5,B00004RCL0,"A cute and complicated movie about love, sex, pregnancy and sports!! If you like Colin Firth you'll like it. For mature audiences due to mature themes and lots of cursing!",1366416000,,171,4.733333333333333
1341638,2,B00004RCL0,"A lousy film which could have employed the nuanced, diaristic programme of the book's delineation of a football fan's inveterate, but acutely recalled failings.  Instead it took dead aim at a lowered version of conventional romance; with a not very credible object of affection.",1308614400,,278,5.318181818181818
1341639,4,B00004RCL0,"Looking over the reviews, I think this film is suffering from some kind of inflated or mistaken expectations.  Guys are disappointed that there isn't enough football and/or sex, and women disappointed that Colin Firth isn't playing a god.  And that Gemell's Sarah is rather earnest and humorless.  But I thought this was a lovely, modest, good-natured film about the messy lives of `real-seeming people.  The former Mr. Darcy, and current King George VI makes a rather alarmingly good slobby, sweet-natured, thirty-something middle school teacher, who needs a haircut, coasts by on charm, and lives for Arsenal.  His effortless connection with students and parents irks the living crap out of his hard-diving next-door neighbor in the school, Sarah, who works her butt off, has all her ducks in a row, and brooks no nonsense.  By all the rules of romantic comedy, of course, these two are destined to get together.

I must agree though that there seems to be no reason on earth for that US DVD cover.  Has absolutely nothing to do with what this movie is about.",1297468800,4,1061,4.921348314606742
1341640,4,B00004RCL0,"OK, so for the US market this is soccer, not football but fandom is international and Nic Hornby - on whose autobiography this is based - knows what it's like to be a dedicated sports follower.

For the WAGs there's a nice little rom-com going on with Colin (Mr Darcy) Firth looking good as ever and Ruth Gemmel is perfect as Sarah, the uptight teacher who finds herself attracted to the football hooligan and, in the end, comes to understand him.

For the fans there's the background of the Arsenal 88/89 season where... but if I tell you that I'll spoil the ending. Let's just say that any British footie fan knows the  details.

But more than that, this is a film that knows what it's like to be a fan, where the ups and downs of life are deeply tied to the highs and lows of the team you follow. As ""Paul"" puts it in the film ""It's hard to tell if life is s**t because Arsenal are s**t or the other way round."" Anyone who has had their hopes that this would be the season when... well, they'll understand.

Add to all this a perfect soundtrack and this is a little gem that you shouldn't miss.",1295049600,3,1097,4.2548076923076925
1341641,5,B00004RCL0,"I saw this film on the first night in 1997 - it was one of the first ""15"" films I was able to see and I remember being disappointed that only one other person in Southampton cinema had decided to wear his Arsenal shirt for the occasion! Anyway, the filmmakers had the difficult task of condensing an autobiographical book whose insights stretch over twenty-three years into a 90 minute film, and decided to build a story around Arsenal's dramatic 1988-1989 season, whilst using excerpts from the past to flesh out the story. It worked very well, and the conclusion never fails to make me smile.  Anyone could watch and enjoy this film, which balances male and female representation very well, as well as balancing the insights of characters who love football and those who loathe it.  Maybe my only criticism would be that not one single woman in this film really wants to watch the game?  Anyway, yeah, anyone could enjoy this film but as an Arsenal fan it's all the more sweeter to me.",1260316800,2,987,4.628571428571429
1341642,3,B00004RCL0,"Full disclosure:  I've been an Arsenal fan since 1979 and I remember just like the cliched JFK moment exactly what I was doing when my team pulled the equivalent of a sporting miracle by defeating the then mighty Liverpool at their home ground in 1989 to win the title.  I doubt very much that I'd even care to watch this film adaptation of Nick Hornby's book if I wasn't already a fan although having watched this dvd with a non-fan recently I can understand why she thought this was pretty boring.  Interestingly enough the screenplay was also written by Hornby himself and I think even he couldn't do much to save this film that would leave you in snores if you don't fit the right audience profile as described above.  Hornby even picked the songs for the soundtrack which is pretty decent but otherwise the acting is pretty wooden and uninspired.  I liked the way Hornby tried to explain why the protagonist behaves the way he does as an ""adult"" linking it to his emotional trauma at having an absent father being brought up by his mother and hence filling the gaping wound in his heart by loving Arsenal as deeply as he imagined he would have done a dad if he truly had one.  His constant horrible fear of and expectation of being let down at the very end by the team mirrors the insecurity he's acquired as a child; if he couldn't trust his own father not to betray him he is constantly paranoid about his beloved Arsenal doing the same thing to him.

Happily, with the help of his love interest and Arsenal's finally winning the title after 18 years he eventually allows himself to trust others again and hence to move on to a less maniacical emotional attachment where happiness for him is not dependent upon the team's successes.  Great screenplay but unfortunately the rest of what makes a film great is missing here and so unless you are a fan of the team this will be hard to sit all the way through.  The sound quality is okay and is available in Dolby 5.1 Surround sound although the picture quality barely rises above VHS quality and the volume for the soundtrack of the songs is for some reason a lot louder than for the vocal track which is irritating as you almost feel you have to rush to reduce the volume the moment a song is played.

In summary, only for the die-hard fan.",1249862400,3,2295,4.455847255369928
1341643,4,B00004RCL0,"My whole family liked this movie ...o.k., those who were over 14.  Not for little ones due to some words, situations.  The guys in our family are absolutely nuts about soccer, and so much of the movie mirrored the true soccer fan's agony during their team's season - the yelling at the TV, the inability to carry on a conversation during a game, the way the soccer season affects your entire year...if you let it.  Added to this authentic soccer fan picture is a storyline that actually appeals to both sexes, and brings up some great points about life.  Colin Firth is great, as always.  He gets into this relationship almost against his will, is just a guy's guy who has a tough time figuring women out.  Ruth Gemmel  plays his girlfriend who falls for her total opposite, and must get a rapid introduction to soccer.  Yes, she does figure out the off-sides rule;)  They must both figure out how to make this relationship work out literally in the shadow of the Arsenal stadium.",1236384000,5,980,4.586206896551724
1341644,4,B00004RCL0,"First of all, I have to say up front that I am both a football (aka soccer) fan and an ardent Arsenal supporter, so this film was almost a must see, at least for me. That said, I will state that the film has its share of poignant moments, almost all of them revolving around the central character's obsession with all things Arsenal, and the level to which this frustrates his girlfriend as she attempts to build a meaningful relationship (with Arsenal always in the way). If you have more than a passing interest in football, and you want to get an English perspective on the subject, this is a good film. I would also recommend ""Green Street Hooligans"", a film that chronicles the adventures of a US college student (Elijah Wood) who moves to London and falls in with a group of football fanatics.",1190764800,,799,4.517241379310345
1341645,3,B00004RCL0,"I much prefered the book to the movie, and was especially disappointed by Colin Firth (who I normally love in movies!)  I found the main character not charming and relatable, though a bit quirky like he was in the book- but completely annoying and a bit crazy.  That said, anything with soccer fields in it makes me happy.  And I definately prefered this version to the baseball american one.",1181606400,,392,4.6521739130434785
1341646,4,B00004RCL0,"Although the cover art for ""Fever Pitch"" gives one the impression that the film is some kind of soccer sex comedy, the film is actually a touching and funny account of one man's obsession with an English soccer team and how that obsession can get in the way of real life.  Adapted by Nick Hornby from his excellent memoir of the same name, the film has fine performances from an able cast that includes Colin Firth.  If you are an English soccer fanatic like me, the film is a must see.  An American remake was made later that uses baseball as the obsession rather than soccer, but who cares?",1178928000,2,592,4.412844036697248
1341647,5,B00004RCL0,This is a funny and touching movie at times.  I saw the American re-hash of it but it didn't traslate as well to baseball.  As this is Nick Hornby's autobiography how could it.  He's English and an Arsenal fan.  It's a shame this movie will not be seen in the States.  Whoever made the decision to change it to an American version did a gross mis-service to this film.  I have found American audiences to be very receptive to British movies,1156723200,8,440,4.37037037037037
1341648,4,B00004RCL0,"This movie is pretty good if you like British films which I do.  Colin Firth does a great job at playing the crazed Arsenal football fan, and I have a feeling that if you also live and die for Arsenal, you'll like the film even more than I did.  The only downside to the movie is that it does drag at parts, but overall, it's witty and funny.",1121731200,6,342,4.014705882352941
1341649,4,B00004RCL0,"This is the original Fever Pitch, with the screenplay based on the novel both written by Nick Hornsby, who really knows how to write about people.  It is a very likable film. Colin Firth plays a wonderful Joe Sixpack; who knew?! It is interesting to see other members in the cast, who have also played more august roles on BBC productions on PBS play regular folk.  This is an obsessive guy who questions why we aren't obsessive too - and his reasoning is hard to discount. However there is a point where I was so fed up with him and angry after his speech about caring for anything for 18 years that I was ready to shut the DVD player off.  Since when does an obsessive have the right to make a moral judgment?  For a comedy, it was teetering on the edge of becoming too dark.  Well, the big match is preparing to happen and I feel like I should be getting snacks and be worried about traffic.  Also, the actors interacting with the action on television was priceless.  The drama building up was a rush. Without wanting to spoil any endings, I almost died laughing with how a climactic moment is portrayed. The soundtrack is wonderful, capturing the time and mood very well.

I have no idea if Hornsby will ever resent how some of us look forward to his hand the storytelling and in the music direction of films with his name in the credits. He is one of those writers who seems to offer clarity on living in the modern world and also include a refreshing list of musicians I never heard before in the process or a refreshing perspective of music I have been listening to for most of my life.

It is disappointing that this movie was not marketed on this side of the pond.  A good movie like this can teach even Americans to understand soccer.  Although, being a neophyte baseball fan, I am curious how the American remake will translate with what sounds like an interesting cast.  Still, my fellow Americans, give this a chance.  If you like it and feel a little more adventurous, if you have 3 1/2 hours, make some time to learn about cricket by watching an Indian music set in the Kutch during the British Raj titled Lagaan.",1119830400,3,2128,4.411764705882353
1341650,4,B00004RCL0,"I wasn't even aware of this film's existence until my British sister-in-law alerted me to it.  I have yet to see the American version of this film so I cannot make comparisons.  I'm baffled by British football but that is not an impediment to your enjoying this film.  Football is just the subtext for this film about a thirty-something lit teacher(Colin Firth) whose lifelong obsession with the Arsenal club allows him to make a tenuous connection with humanity.  This fanaticism comes into question when he developes a relationship with a fellow teacher(Ruth Gemmell).  Sports obsession is fine when it is put in it's proper context but potentially fatal when trying to be intimate with another human being.  Firth does just fine in his portrayal of the football fanatic, not overdoing it but giving a well-rounded picture of a man who has difficulty letting go of his adolescent obsessions.  There are many funny moments here, many touching, and also many universal truths on display.  This film is an excellent companion to later Nick Hornby film adaptations, ""High Fidelity"" and ""About a Boy"".",1114819200,6,1098,5.027624309392265
1341651,5,B00004RCL0,This is an extremely funny movie and if you know anything at all about the worlds most popular sport this will resonate with you.,1112140800,,129,4.416666666666667
1341652,4,B00004RCL0,"Colin Firth plays a teacher and passionate to the point of obsessive football (soccer for Americans) fan who manages to mangle his only functional relationship, thanks to his tunnel vision when it comes to his obsession and fanatical support for Arsenal. His self-centered attitude with no concern at all for his girlfriend's interests muck up what could be a good relationship. On the other hand, it is hard to see in the first place what the woman finds so appealing about Firth's character, Paul. Perhaps because she is so uptight and needs to loosen up and sees in him a way by which to learn to be less rigid. She attempts to get involved in HIS passion but does not quite have the rabid, feverish passion he has. Eventually the fact that he identifies himself so closely with his football club and its ups and downs leads to the demise of the relationship, but she comes to see that she likes his identity, which is strong, linked to football or not. She has also been carried away by a certain infectious passion about football because it is so much a part of his life. Of course, one could argue that this tale is a sad reflection on the idea that there is a genderlect and that women suffer more in terms of being able to communicate, but that belies the point here that sometimes an imperfect person can still be perfect for someone who loves him, faults, obsessions and all.",1110585600,2,1385,4.544
1341653,2,B00004RCL0,"A cleverly directed film can inspire audiences to share the characters' affection for each other, but just as often, films fetishize obnoxious, childish, or selfish behavior, and watching two people mysteriously bond over actions that should drive them apart is generally more baffling than affirming...Such is the case with Sarah and the unbearable Paul.

No self respecting woman (or man for that matter) would find such behaviour in any way endearing. The status of their relationship at the end of the film makes me think Fever Pitch belongs in the fantasy/science fiction category.",1110499200,,586,5.301075268817204
1341654,5,B00004RCL0,"I lived and worked in London from 1997-1998. As it turned out, I ended up finding a flat on Highbury Park Road in North London. Closest tube stop: Arsenal on the Picadilly Line.

I walked past the Grounds nearly everyday.

When I first mentioned my new neighborhood to my English workmates, they thought I was either mad, that I'd want to live so close to Highbury or lied to by an unscrupulous estate agent ""yes, this neighborhood of Islington is quite leafy and quiet. In fact, Tony Blair lived here before he became PM!""

A friend suggested I check out ""Fever Pitch"" to find out a bit more about my neighborhood and the ""Gooners.""

Well, I had to say it was a great introduction for me into the life of an Arsenal supporter and live in the neighborhood. 1998 was the year they won the double (League & FA Cup) for only the 2nd time in their history. Incidentally, this was the first time in my life I had ever seen riot police & helicopters flying overhead shining lights down on the streets. Seemed a bit LA'ish!

I couldn't quite figure out why I was attracted to the neighborhood, nor why I so much liked the film, until I saw a newspaper article comparing the MLB Red Sox & Yankees to Arsenal & Manchester United (respectively). I finally realized that growing up in Boston, I had found my second home in North London!

Well, this review is more about my experience in London, but the film was a great part of that experience.",1098921600,19,1433,4.429657794676806

I am an Arsenal fan but cannot fully understand what this team can do to fans. Arsenal had not won a league championship since 1971 and we follow Collin Firth as a fan in the 1989 season in which many things happen in his life. His life goes like the season, up and down and with a tremendous climax.
For soccer fans this movie is great, for Americans it might give some insight into the mad people that follow this beautiful game around the world. Don't worry, there are now standing tickets anymore, it's all seats now.
For Red Sox and Cubs fans it might look a little like their own lives, constantly being dissapointed and loving and hating your team at the same time. But like in Fever Pitch, dreams may come true some day",1086480000,5,902,4.407185628742515
1341656,4,B00004RCL0,"I bought this movie because I am a big fan of Colin Firth.  I am not sure if I like the movie or not.  I think I will have to watch it again before I decide.  At first I did not even get that the young boy was Paul as a child.
The acting was great.  Colin Firth and Ruth Gemmell both did a wonderful job.  I guess the only reason I was not sure if I liked the movie was because I could not imagine anybody so obsessed with a football team.  But then, I think in the end Paul came to terms with things and it seemed from his comments at the end that he had decided to make his life more balanced.
It was a good movie.  Maybe I am not the most observant - I think I will enjoy it more and get more out of it the second time!",1086393600,,722,3.6493506493506493

But Colin Firth yet again pulls a great role and the movie on a whole was well worth getting into Arsenal for.

1341661,3,B00004RCL0,"A disappointment. And I am not referring to the racy DVD cover of football cleats dangled before a topless blond, with the caption, ""There's more than one way to score."" If you follow the devoted football fan genre, the story is as weak as the cover is misleading.
Yes, these 'small' English films allow Americans to see parts of London left out of the tour guides and brochures. This 'slice of life' of a football fanatic -- not a hooligan -- captures the teacher's small flat, the local, the grass roots fans, the seasonal swings in the mood around football. The Arsenal stands. The working class neighborhoods. But that's about all.
If you want to summarize the film, think of ""About a boy', Hornby's book and film, and add football, and you have the basic idea for Fever. Substitute Colin Firth for Hugh Grant, and you have the same man-as-boy (""Peter Pan"") problem, only  Fever's Firth is arrested in his development by his devotion to football and Boy's Grant is arrested in his development by the financial arrangements made by his dad. Both characters have a strained yet essentially positive relationship with their fathers, and both of these thirty-something men have to sort out both their commitments to women and the unsolicited fatherly role model they play for impressonable teenage boys.
The love story is hard to explain unless you accept the young, hardened, beautiful spinster theory, a woman who once accepting a ride home from the disheveled protagonist, immediately offers to have him spend the night. Yes, there is some logic in the opposites attract approach but the rest of the film offers more reasons for them to split then they have to stay together, outside the obvious bond that entangles them more than it draws them together.
Yes, Hornby's humor is spot on. The little things in life do matter, even when they are done in voiceover in the film. But capturing a magic moment -- miracle -- in Arsenal's down-up-down-then-up-again season makes it all a little too easy.",1054252800,14,1998,4.859237536656892

Fever Pitch is the story of a boy growing through his parents divorce into a man set against his fanatical devotion to his football team (Arsenal)the one constant in his life.  Despite the team's failure to deliver they are always there, always welcome him, never turn their back on him and always keep him waiting for success (18 years).  He has a career as a highly popular english teacher which is going nowhere, his focus is on coaching the school football team, at one point he even turns down a promotion to avoid losing his coaching role.  Love enters the picture in the shape of a very commited and serious colleague who in addition to the normal battles of love has to deal with playing second love to Arsenal.  In time Arsenal deliver and release the hapless childman and love can flourish.  Despite the sports fan theme Hornby uncovers some meaty stuff in Fever Pitch as he does in all his work, although you have to look a little harder in this one than most.  Will it be a monster success in the US, I truly doubt it.  Personally I thought it was fantastic, but I am as sad and demented as the subject of the movie.",1053993600,2,1337,4.473251028806584

The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that through most of the movie, I found myself screaming at Paul Ashworth for being so damn stupid. Ruth Gemmell is excellent, but who am I kidding?

Yes it's true that the book and the movie differ from one another, but the movie really works, even if the main character isn't named Nick Hornby.  I must say that Mr Hornby has got me hooked on Arsenal now as well.
Sure the outcome of the movie, when it comes to the romance between Paul and Sarah, is easy to predict, but that's not really the point of this movie.  Any sports addict will see themselves in Paul, there is no doubt about that.  But that's half the fun of this movie.  We can laugh along with him, or at him because we see some of the same things we do when we let a sport consume our lives.
I'm glad that this film was made in the UK, it wouldn't have worked being made anywhere else.  I think Ruth Gemmell is an outstanding actress, and she seemed to be the perfect choice to play Sarah.  Colin Firth as Paul, it seemed like the part was made for him.  Even if you might have a problem with the English slang, give this movie a try.

But after several subsequent viewings, my opinion improved. When I approached it not as a love story, which I had expected it to be, but more of a tale  of personal growth, I enjoyed it much more. In fact, I would have to rate it right behind ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" to be my 3rd favorite Colin Firth film (""Pride & Prejudice"" is, of course, first). All of the actors are very good, and watching the sequences of his adolescence makes the viewer aware of life's many passages. All in all, an excellent film.",1021334400,,784,4.681159420289855
1341672,2,B00004RCL0,"I found this movie very disappointing, considering the talent involved.  Either it's one of Hornby's lesser books or the screenplay completely messes it up.  The characters are all ridiculous.  Ruth Gemmel as Sarah is thoroughly obnoxious and completely imbecilic.  She's uptight ninety percent of the time, but invites Paul (Colin Firth) to sleep with her the first time she has him over, and this is only a week or so after she first meets him and hates him.  Meanwhile, poor Paul is obsessed with Arsenal--a bit too much, admittedly, but Sarah acts like he's committing murder every time he goes to a game.  There is no chemistry between the leads, I don't believe they'd last two weeks as a couple, let alone six months or whatever it's supposed to be.  The pacing's all over the place, the best friends are irritating (hers more than his).  How is she expecting to pay that cab driver when she's wearing a pocketless dress and has no purse?  Why doesn't she just leave him alone?  Really, it's a waste of time.  See Bridget Jones' Diary again, or Pride and Prejudice if you need your Colin Firth fix, or wait a year or so for all his post-Bridget success films to come out.  Avoid this like the plague.  There are many great British romantic comedies, so don't waste your time on this one.",1018224000,4,1294,4.62280701754386

1341674,4,B00004RCL0,"I wrote an earlier review of Nick Hornby's 'Fever Pitch' as well.  It's worth writing a separate review of the movie because it's so different.  Not better, or worse.  Just different.  The book focuses on Hornby's lifelong obession with Arsenal, the English Premiership football (aka 'soccer') club.  In the movie, Hornby's written a script that focuses on one extended episode from the book.  It becomes more of a relationship movie.
Here's evidence of the difference:  my wife tried to read the book, but could only stomach about 30 pages of it.  I endured it, liked it, but I'll admit that it can be a tough slog for someone that didn't grow up with English football.  The names of Arsenal players, coaches and opponents became a blur at times.
In contrast, we both enjoyed the movie a great deal.  It's a cute little story (nothing more), and we both like all of Colin Firth's work.  He's a little more rumpled than usual here, but compelling nevertheless.
Oh yeah, ignore the cover box.  There are no topless women.  No strategically placed soccer cleats.  It's yet another odd effort by American re-packagers thinking they have to disguise the true nature of a British movie (see also ""Brassed Off"" and, most egregiously, ""East is East"").",1017014400,26,1244,4.834123222748815

7920664,3,B00004RCL0,"Some years ago I read (and liked) the book ""Fever Pitch"" by Nick Hornby (High Fidelity, About a Boy), which was a collection of autobiographical anecdotes about his long lasting support of Arsenal, from 1968 when he become a fan until 1989, the year the Gunners won the First Division after almost 20 years.

The movie decides to eschew the book approach and fictionalizes the story as a sort of romantic comedy in which supposed opposites attract. It's 1989, and Colin Firth is Paul (Hornby's alter ego) a teacher at a school in London, and the movie is about his burgeoning romance with Sarah Hughes (Ruth Gemmell), a new teacher at the school. As their relationship develops, Paul seems sometimes more concerned about Arsenal's standing in the championship and the increasing likelihood that it will finally win the league. This to the dismay of Sarah, who hates football and is very uptight. Intercalated with these scenes, we see Paul as a young kid in the late 1960s, his relationship with his divorced father, and how he initially become an Arsenal fan.

One problem with the movie is that we never know what Sarah saw in Paul, since she is critical of him from the start (the first time they talk in the movie, she protests the noise his students are making in the classroom next to her own class). Their chemistry is basically zero. Of course, this is not the fault of either Firth or Gemmell (their acting is fine).
