8204062,5,B000001L3E,I got this dvd for my mom. She's a lover of quartet music and alot of times she misses  when certain groups come to town or close to town. I deceided to surprise her by getting this dvd and she was. She played it over and over again. It was a very lengthy full concert that took her right into the concert as if she was there.,1342742400,4,326,3.8656716417910446
8204063,5,B000001L3E,First of all a correction must be made. The title of this vedio is Live in Birmingham not Live in Jackson I own both. I guess I am a little biased toward this group of singers but certainly not in a negative way. I had the chance to meet these find gentlemen about 30 years ago while attending a concert in my home town. Now if you are a fan of good old fashion gospel singing I highly recommend  this title or any of there recordings. This is good old southern gospel singing at its best.,1001980800,4,489,4.09375
