The DVDs walk the viewer through their 8 day adventure to Rio de Janeiro.  Volumes 1&2 are actually a set which covers everything from the famous Ipanema and Copacabana beaches, to the Termas in Rio, to private pool parties, boat parties and even Carnival!  The format is a reality based adventure complete with pop ups that provide useful info to the viewer about travel tips, places to go at night and during the day to meet all kinds of women and even includes info for sightseeing, shopping at malls and suggestions on where to stay to be in the middle of the action.  I knew these guys were for real when I checked out their website at 4womenoftheworld.com.  It has trip reports, great deals on DVDs, a membership site on the way, a message board and travel guides for sale.  These guys are going out of their way to make sure single guys who want to travel and get laid have everything they need to get some ass anywhere in the world.  The Women of the World guys are on to something no doubt!  Nice work gentlemen!!",1091059200,6,1178,4.36697247706422
