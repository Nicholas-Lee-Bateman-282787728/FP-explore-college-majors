1387025,3,B000051S4W,"The Doctor and Jo travel to Spiridon in pursuit of the Daleks from the home of the Ogrons. Only when they arrive, it isn't a squad of Daleks they have to deal with, it's an entire army, waiting to invade the Galaxy! The sequel to ""Frontier in Space"" is like many sequels, not all that great! I don't know all the details behind the original script for ""Planet"", but Terry Nation really should have read ""Frontier..""'s script, because what could have been a classic double six-parter, is merely a great six-parter, and a ho-hum six -parter filler. ""Planet of the Daleks"" has many things in common with Irwin Allen's ""When Time Ran Out"", a compilation disaster epic bomb with very little originality. ""Planet..."" is just that, a compilation of past Dalek stories(Nation's Dalek stories)with a new setting and new characters. It's nice to see the Thals again, but without Horsfall and Hancock, the rest of them are one dimensional stand ins. And the Spiridons themselves, good thing there isn't a lot of CSO! But, at least the Daleks are good. Better than ""Day of the Daleks"", that's for sure(even if there communication bulbs flash totally out of sequence). Let's not forget Episode 3. One has to wonder if the whole program was in this format it might be a little bit more successful. The scenes inside the fissure are well realised, giving a real feeling of claustrophobia.  The production really isn't that bad, it tries so hard to be  a classic(like ""Resurrection..""), but it just misses here and there, and gets a little, well, like all Pertwee six-parters, dull. Love the ""ice volcanoes"", ""molten ice""(and people want to complain about ""Creature From the Pit"" with Lady Adrasta and her monopoly of metal), very 70's!",974332800,4,1720,4.846938775510204
1387026,3,B000051S4W,"For those fans whose only access to Doctor Who is by waiting patiently for the next VHS release, a long wait is over.  ""Planet of the Daleks"" picks up after a cliffhanger ending of the previous volume ""Frontier in Space.""  I don't want to spoil anything for those who have not seen it, but let's just say the Doctor (played here with his usual charm by Jon Pertwee) was in some dire straits.
It's been 4 years (!) since BBC/Fox video relesed the excellent ""Frontier in Space,"" and now we can see the conclusion of that adventure.  In this story, the Daleks are preparing to take advantage of the imminent Earth/Draconia war, a war they helped to provoke.  As the Daleks prepare to thaw out a frozen army vastly increasing their numbers, the Doctor and Jo Grant join a group of Thals (enemies of the Daleks) to head them off at the pass.
This story by itself is not one of the best of the era, but viewed in conjunction with the far superior ""Frontier in Space"" it is truely epic.
""Planet of the Daleks"" major shortcomings are (1) like many of the Pertwee stories it could have been shortened by one episode and would have been better for it, and (2) sadly Roger Delgado, who played the Master with sinister grace through many Pertwee stories, passed away after completing ""Frontier in Space.""  As he was intended to play a major role in ""Planet of the Daleks,"" many elements had to be reworked at the last minute.
But, any Dalek story written by creator Terry Nation has plenty more going for it to make up for any negatives.

The stories are loosely linked together at the end of FRONTIER IN SPACE and the beginning of PLANET OF THE DALEKS. FRONTIER IN SPACE concerns an imiment war between humanity and the Draconian Empire being orchestrated by the Master and his mysterious partners. In PLANET THE DALEKS, the Doctor having exposed the conspiracy of the Master and the Daleks, then follows the Daleks to a jungle world where he, Jo Grant, and a group a Thals discover a army of Daleks in frozen storage waiting to wage war across the galaxy.
Each story is 6 episodes long with pretty good extras on the second disc. Jon Pertwee and Roger Delgado are great in their respective roles as the Doctor and the Master. FRONTIER IN SPACE is driven by political intrigue while PLANET OF THE DALEKS is more action oriented. If you grew up watching Jon Pertwee's 3rd Doctor you should love this set.

Currently if you want to pad a story you just extend the escape scene,  Taking a 2 minute escape and filming 10 minutes of it really lengthens your show.  They didn't do that here.  They fleshed out the storyline with small details.  These two stories may give you a more in depth understanding of the background than any other story.  Also I found the special effects to be pretty good.  They may not be up to todays amazing standards, but the Draconians look really good to me and the location of the shoots was also extraordinary.

The story is garbage and it is painfully boring to watch. Terry Nation has proved himself to be a lousy script writer and story teller with this one. It just awful.

Jo talking into a recorder just magnificently stupid! Compound this idiotic story element with the fact that this recorder was constructed out of a CASSETTE CASE and any rational person will be laughing their head off. The Daleks have never been so boring and the whole invisibility storyline is just ridiculous. How do the Daleks enslave an invisible people?

1387060,4,B000051S4W,"These two stories form a very loosely connected duo of twelve episodes total joined essentially by the presence of Daleks. In Frontier in Space, the Earth has a interplanetary federation which has run up against the empire of aliens known as Draconians. The ""Dragons"" as they are derisively called are pretty well realized for Doctor Who aliens, being humanoids with prosthetic appliances and makeup making them into interesting cone-headed people with scales. They have fought a war with humans, and as a result there is now peace and a mutually agreed upon ""frontier"" between the two space-faring races. A familiar villain wants to upset this balance of power for his own gain. Can the humans and Draconians overcome their prejudice and past problems to work together to defeat the threat?

""Planet of the Daleks"" features the infamous Daleks using a jungle planet to raise a secret army of conquest. Their enemies from Skaro, the Thals, have followed them there to stop their evil plans. Interestingly, the Thals are a peace-loving people at this stage of their development, who have to put pacifism away to thwart the Daleks. The Daleks are almost ready to release their army of tens of thousands when the Doctor and Jo arrive and begin to aid the Thal party in their secret mission against impossible odds! The setting of the jungle planet for a Dalek story is particularly well realized for Doctor Who, and has some nice effects. The Daleks are a favorite enemy and there are a number of morals to this story that are explored as it unfolds.

The special effects for this story are pretty decent, but I didn't particularly like the CGI-heavy two part-fictionalized commentary that tried too hard to explore the meaning of the episodes in their time. Otherwise, there are the usual DVD extras and interviews from a Third Doctor episode.  All in all this is a pretty good boxed duo, which I recommend to get a good perspective on the Third Doctor's off-earth adventures.",1376179200,4,1974,4.886567164179104
1387061,4,B000051S4W,"Although Frontier in Space is about a possible war, there is no sense of urgency in the story. It has a few good moments but overall, is slow and plods along. Roger Delgado's part as the Master brings some welcome relief in comparison to some forgettable characters in the story. You are often waiting for something interesting to happen that never comes.
  Planet of the Daleks keeps your attention and is one of the 6 part Pertwee stories that doesn't feel padded. The feeling of the story is that something is happening. The characters are interesting and add to the story.",1373587200,,576,4.693069306930693
1387062,4,B000051S4W,"Frontier In Space introduced the Draconians, one of the more memorable alien races from the Pertwee era. The Draconians are in a Cold War with Earth, a situation that's fast approaching all-out conflict thanks to raids on each empire's merchant fleet that they naturally blame on the other. Enter the Doctor and Jo...

The first 3 episodes are smart and fast-moving, featuring plenty of action, smart dialogue and excellent supporting performances. The 2nd half slows down a bit - even the introduction of The Master doesn't pep up the story like it usually does. I'm not sure if it's the direction, the writing , or Roger Delgado, but The Master seems bored and tries too hard to be witty. There is way too much incarceration and escape attempts by the Doctor and Jo, 2 space walks by the Doctor, and 3 Stooges inspired ridiculing of the Ogrons by the Master.

Despite its faults the first half redeems the story, and the lead-in to the next series (Planet of the Daleks) keeps the viewer interested and on edge.",1372723200,,1013,4.7175141242937855

1387067,3,B000051S4W,"The Dalek War Box Set contains two loosely connected Doctor Who stories - ""Fronter in Space"" and ""Planet of the Daleks"" - neither of which have stood the test of time. I wouldn't recommend either story to new viewers, but longtime Who fans might have some fun with this creaky stuff.

Actually, I once thought ""Frontier in Space"" was a contender for the worst-ever story, because it features aimless padding, dinky model work, and terrible 1970s fashions. However, seeing the story again recently, I appreciated writer Malcolm Hulke's pacifist message and his attempts to develop an interesting future-Earth society. I was also struck by just how deeply political the Pertwee era was. (At one point, the Doctor is thrown in prison and makes friends with incarcerated members of a global Peace Party, which is plotting to overthrow the Earth government; and yet Doctor Who fans sometimes have the nerve to claim that the show didn't have any political messages!)

Other highlights of ""Frontier"" include Roger Delgado's droll performance as the Master; a good outing for Katy Manning (she has some great confrontations with Delgado); and the surprise appearance of the Doctor's greatest enemies (but not such a surprise, considering the title of the box set). So overall, I'd say ""Frontier"" is an average or slightly under-par story.

""Planet of the Daleks"" is somewhat worse. It aspires to be a thrilling adventure story, but doesn't have the budget to pull it off. The Daleks look, move and act quite wooden here, and the heroic Thal characters are mostly underdeveloped. To make matters worse, Terry Nation's script is a lazy rehash of the Daleks' first story from the William Hartnell era - which had a much better script, more interesting moral dilemmas, and even better special effects! In short, ""Planet"" represents Doctor Who at its most repetitive and uninspired.

The DVDs themselves, meanwhile, are well done. Both stories include making-of featurettes and various other supplements - the best being a very thoughtful tribute to Roger Delgado. The picture quality is pretty good, considering the age and origin of the material, and the sound is very clear. (Extensive restoration work had to be done on part three of ""Planet,"" so it looks and sounds a little worse than the other installments). So overall, this is a nice product, but it's not essential Doctor Who...",1356566400,4,2376,5.069053708439898

Honestly, I'm a little surprised by some of the reviews giving this lower scores. Jon Pertwee's Third Doctor is among my favorite incarnations, and he's as clever and charming as ever in this set. The adventure here, especially the second half, can be seen as a follow-up to the 1963 First Doctor story, ""The Daleks"".

1387070,5,B000051S4W,"Two six-part stories, joined together as a sort of two-part epic:

The first, Frontier In Space, is one of the highlights of the Pertwee era, a longish but entertaining Malcom Hulke story.  Hulk brilliantly creates a sweeping epic largely through dialogue, fleshing out his intergalactic war into a totally convincing conflict.  The fourth episode, made up primarily of the Doctor and Jo trying to outwit the Master on a small spacecraft, the highlight.  Jo gets some of her best moments throughout, Pertwee is typically assured, and Delgado's final appearance as the Master is one of his best.

The second, Planet of the Daleks, isn't quite as strong, as Terry Nation recycles a lot of elements of earlier Daleks stories, but it's very entertaining nonetheless.  Like Frontier, it creates a huge story on a small budget very cleverly.  It benefits tremendously from the direction of David Maloney, one of the very finest directors Who ever had (some of his other include The Mind Robber, The War Games, Genesis of the Daleks, and Talons of Weng-Chiang).

Both are two-disc editions, packed with more than enough extras to be satisfying.

All in all, it's 12 episodes of classic Pertwee Who, worthwhile for any Whovian.",1308182400,4,1219,5.024875621890548
1387071,5,B000051S4W,"Not only do you have two huge story arches but tons of extras including commentary from Katy Manning, Prentis Hancock, Barry Letts, Terrance Dicks, and Tim Preece.  Also, the Third Doctor happens to be one of the best - at least nobody can say he was boring or lacked personality.  I enjoyed the complex and realistic story line in the first arch, even if there are some plot holes, and just love the Daleks.  So you can guess I really enjoyed the second story arch.  I enjoy science fiction, I enjoy space opera, aliens, cool spaceship models and, in general, also think Jo Grant really evolves in these episodes.
True, I think bringing in the Thals was a mistake.  They don't seem to be very good at fighting, their ships don't seem made for space travel, and they don't seem very organized.  I can only assume, as they don't appear in later stories, that they get wiped out by the Daleks or some other alien race.
Terry Nation brings back all his favorite ploys - germ warfare, jungles, invisible creatures, you get the idea.  Very classic in a way.  But unless you love the Daleks you may not be too happy with Planet of the Daleks.  And that means you may not be happy with the whole set.  Because it really is a two part story arch and if you buy four DVDs and don`t like two of them, that is a waste of your time and money.

1387074,3,B000051S4W,"This double adventure, which stretches to 12 episodes in all, includes the final appearance of Roger Delgado as the Master. Otherwise, though, the two linked stories are of only middling interest despite some winning features.

In ""Frontier in Space,"" Jo and the Doctor are forced to land the TARDIS on a 26th-century cargo ship returning to Earth. The ship is raided and its cargo and the TARDIS are stolen by what appear to be Draconians, highly civilized reptilian humanoids of a rival empire. Jo and the Doctor are arrested by Earth authorities as spies for the Draconians, who deny any piracy and countercharge that the humans of Earth are raiding their ships. So who is setting the two empires at each other's throats? Well, it's hard not to give away the ""secret"" when the word ""Dalek"" features so prominently on the box, but the Master is also involved, played by Roger Delgado in his last appearance before he would be killed in a tragic auto accident in Turkey in June 1973.

""Frontier"" includes primitive model work in the spacecraft scenes and relatively unimaginative sets in the studio shots. Much more interesting is the clever use of location shooting outside Royal Festival Hall, whose modernist concrete structure is used to depict a futuristic Earth prison, and at a BBC director's ultramodern private home in Highgate, which serves as the Draconian embassy. The costume design, particularly for the Draconians, is first rate, and the character acting by Michael Hawkins as General Williams and Vera Fusek as President of Earth is also top notch. The abrupt plot resolution in Episode Six, however, leaves too many loose ends (the fate of the Master, for instance) as the story transitions into ""Planet of the Daleks.""

In this second story, the Doctor makes telepathic contact with the Time Lords, who direct the TARDIS to Spiridon, a jungle planet where the Daleks are mustering their invasion forces. There, Jo and the Doctor join up with an expedition of Thals, the peaceful, blond-haired race from the Daleks' home planet of Skaro. Here, Doctor Who welcomes the return of veteran character actor Bernard Horsfall as the Thal leader, Taron. (Horsfall played numerous roles in Doctor Who over the years, including that of one of the Time Lords who exiles the Doctor to Earth in ""The War Games."")

""Planet of the Daleks"" doesn't have much else going for it, though. The story is shot almost exclusively in the studio, with the exception of scenes that were filmed in a quarry (Katy Manning remarks in the making-of documentary that she could start a tour company specializing in quarries). The sets make use of exotic living as well as artificial prop plants, and the studio lighting is effective, but the story, weighed down with Terry Nation's usual preoccupations, never quite transcends its artificial feel.

Added features make this four-disc package worth the $60 list price, but only just. The making-of shorts are competent, workmanlike productions, but the two 30-minute ""Perfect Scenario"" features are a waste of disc space. Don't miss the 31-minute tribute to Roger Delgado, though, which includes interviews with the actor's exquisitely named wife, Kismet, and a rich sampling of original footage from a wide-ranging BBC acting career.",1269993600,16,3268,5.066914498141264
1387075,4,B000051S4W,"It was rare for Doctor Who in its original TV series to do something truly epic in scale. The two stories contained in this DVD box set, Frontier In Space and Planet Of The Daleks, is an example of when that happened. While two separate stories technically, these two linked stories make up a twelve part epic linked by the involvement of the Doctor's dreaded enemies the Daleks. While these two stories are by themselves a bit of a mixed bag, they are well presented here in this box set.

First off is Frontier In Space. While it is certainly true that it suffers from some of the padding evident in most six parters but, on the flip side, we get one of the most complete portraits of the future presented in any Who story. The result is that the story ahs a real epic feeling to it (albeit an low budget one) that travels across a large part of space including future Earth, a lunar penal colony and other places along the way. There's also the Draconians as well whose society might not be quite as fleshed out as the Human's but who remain one of the best designed of original series monsters (which makes one wonder why they never made any type of return at all). There's some nice moments from Jon Pertwee as the Doctor and Katy Manning as companion Jo Grant plus Roger Delgado's final appearance as The Master as well. While a tad bit too long and with some occasionally iffy model work Frontier is still a fine Who adventure.

This epic is concluded in the six part Planet Of The Daleks. This story had been referred to elsewhere by Dalek voice actor/audio storywriter Nicholas Briggs as being akin to ""the Dalek's greatest hits"" and that is a fair assessment. Writer and Dalek creator Terry Nation writes a story that takes the elements of previous Dalek stories and combines them together into one story. The result is a story that is just too familiar for its own good. The result is that story is predictable to the pointing of being downright boring. This is despite the efforts of the cast and crew including some well designed sets and some fine direction from David Maloney. The result is a story with much potential but none really showing.

The special features are somewhat better then the stories themselves. The best special feature is actually the third episode of Planet Of The Daleks which has been restored to full color for the first time in over three decades. The restoration work is so good you'd never have known that the color version had been lost at some point! There are also some fine documentaries as well including making of docs for each of the two stories, a fine tribute to the career and life of actor Roger Delgado and two further installments for the Stripped For Action documentaries on the Doctor Who comics (one for the third Doctor and one for the 60's Dalek strips). Of special interest are the audio commentaries due to them ebbing the first ones released since the passing of Who producer Barry Letts late last year. The commentaries feature Letts who is still at the top of his game and it is as always interesting hearing his thoughts and memories on these two stories. The only real duds of the special features is the two-part Perfect Scenario sci-fi docu-drama which attempts to look at how the world of the early 1970's effected to and can be seen as sub-texts within the two stories. Unfortunately the drama bits are both filled with bad dialogue and bad acting but both the actors and the fictional talking heads, not to mention seemingly advocating genocide before it ends. Considering that the similarly done documentary Beneath The Surface on the Silurian's DVD back in 2008 covered much the same ground for that story in a pure documentary form  so successfully, one wonders why this unsuccessful experiment was even attempted. That said, the majority of the special features are worth inclusion.

So how does the Dalek War box set rank then? Well there's the stories: Frontier In Space is a good story, though slow at times, while Planet Of The Daleks can be considered borderline boring with its over reliance on what had gone before it. The special features are overwhelmingly fine (especially the Planet Of The Daleks episode three restoration and the Delgado documentary) though the two-part Perfect Scenario is far from good. The result then is a good box set, though a bit of a mixed one to be honest.",1268524800,29,4371,4.649417852522639
1387076,5,B000051S4W,"Two great action-packed Doctor Who stories featuring two of the Doctor's greatest enemies! First in ""Frontier in Space"", the Doctor and Jo arrive on an Earth spaceship in the 26th century just as it is coming under attack by the Ogrons who are posing as Draconians. The Ogrons are in fact employed by the Doctor's archenemy, the Master, who is trying to provoke a war between Earth and Draconia. But the Master may not be the mastermind behind this sinister scheme... in fact, he is secretly working with another archenemy of the Doctor's - the Daleks! Then in ""Planet of the Daleks"", the Doctor tracks the Daleks to the planet Spiridon where the evil creatures are massing a huge army of 10,000 Daleks to invade the galaxy. Two thrilling adventures no Whovian should miss out on. Highly Recommended!",1268438400,4,800,4.804347826086956
1387077,4,B000051S4W,"The Doctor and Jo finally traveling in a proper working TARDIS (sort of) have found themselves on board a cargo ship heading towards Earth.  Unknown to the Doctor and Jo ships have been attacked by Draconias.  Noble warriors from the Draconia Empire that view Humans as little more then ignorant savages, with no concept of honor.  Still they have been welcomed on Earth with diplomats to try and create a peace with the earth and its people's.  The Draconias also claim that they have been  attacked by humans and that they want retrubition for thier losses.  The Doctor and Jo get tangled up in this confilct by both sides thinking they are respinable for what is going on.  The Doctor thinks some else is pulling the strings. They witness Orgrans boarding a human ship.  The Doctor knowns of only one race to employ them, but is shcoked to find the Master behind it.  He is the one trying to start a war.  The Doctor can't figure why and what purpose until after finally revealing the Master's plan both the Humans and the Draconians unite to stop him.  Only to be thwarted by..the Daleks.  They were the ones supplying the Master with ships, Ogrions and whatever else he needed to start a war.  The Doctor manages to stop him but not without injury and makes it back with Jo before setting the control and dematerilizing the TARDIS.  There they land on a strange jungle world.  The Doctor has become ill and is unresposive.  Jo goes out into the jungle to try and find help but stumbles upon dangerous plant life.  Shortly after her encounter the Doctor awaken refreshed and wondering where Jo is.  He goes out and searches for her only to discover Thals.  The Kaleds hated foe before the Daleks were created.  They have been sent out to find and stop the Daleks at any cost.  Thier they discover the Dalkes have been trying to use the natives natural ability to become invisable to thier own ends.  With the Daleks creating new weapons and perfecting the invisablity methods will the Doctor, Jo and the Thals be able to stop them?  Or will the universe finally be conqured by the Daleks?",1268006400,4,2092,4.594594594594595
1387078,5,B000051S4W,"Several Years ago I was connacted by the BBC arcives as they found out that I had a copy ( from the late John Nathen-Turner) of the missing shows from planet of the Daleks on VHS.  I made a DVD copy and ssent it to England. The vidio was not very good being convention stock, however the audio was good. this with several other copies they had tracked down should allow full restoration of this very good show, infact referanced in Revelation of the daleks when the Doctor made the same gizmo to stop them. Lookiing forward to a clean copy as all you are. Collecting these poor copies including Eps. 1 of Invasion of the Dinosaurs and returning them to the BBC, allows all of us to see them fully restored now. Hope to see the Dinos soon. the audio was great and it explains why they were in that truck at the start of Eps. 2.  Good Travels.",1260835200,17,841,4.25
1387079,5,B000051S4W,"Pertwee has always been a favorite of mine.  His take on the Doctor was utterly unique.  The only true action hero Doctor.  Loved him then, and love him now.  Even with the series resurrected, it seems that the Doctors thus far(Eccleston and Tennant) have lifted elements from Troughton, Baker, and even Hartnell's run, but no one has attempted to lift any elements of Pertwee's portrayal.  Wonder why that is?  Because only Pertwee can do Pertwee.  These episodes showcase his talents brilliantly, and the baddies contained in the stories are typical for his era.  This is a must have, not just for fans of the Daleks, but for any Who fan.  The series at its very best, by one of the best to ever play the role.  Watch with your kids. Watch, and be a kid all over again!",1258934400,25,771,4.521739130434782
1387080,5,B000051S4W,"I can't remember if I saw these two stories when I was younger watching PBS.  I was hooked at an early age!  I'm just psyched that more Dalek stories are being released, especially this arc.  I think the restoration team ([...]) does an awesome job bringing these stories back to life!  It would be cool if they can fill in some of the other missing episodes with animated substitutes like they did in ""The Invasion"" if the audio tracks are still available!",1257984000,9,457,4.536585365853658
1387081,5,B000051S4W,"Although many elements in this story were taken from other stories like ""The Daleks"", ""The Dalek Invasion of Earth"", ""The Chase"", ""Mission to the Unknown"", and ""The Daleks' Master Plan"", this was a great epic adventure - mainly because many elements were copied.

Continuing on from ""Frontier in Space"", the Doctor has been wounded by the Master, and the Daleks are about to invade the galaxy! The Doctor tracks the Daleks to their new base, the planet Spiridon, where there are 10,000 Daleks in suspended animation - waiting to awake and take what they believe is their rightful place in the universe as the supreme beings. The Daleks have enslaved the local and invisible Spiridons who now serve the Daleks, but one Spiridon, Wester, wants to fight back against the evil creatures that have invaded his planet. Along the way, the Doctor and Jo join forces with a group of Thals who have arrived from Skaro to once more fight the Dalek forces.

Although ""Frontier in Space"" is still my favorite out of the two, this is still a great action-packed adventure that concludes the story that was set up in ""Frontier in Space"". The only down side is that Episode Three is in black & white. But if you want to pay a higher price and wait for the DVD release, you can get the entire story in color which includes a re-colorized Episode Three. Why didn't they do that for the VHS release? But in either case, if its on DVD or VHS, I highly recommend it!",1254355200,,1445,4.575289575289576
1387082,4,B000051S4W,"This story does an astonishing job of making a small studio set for a jungle planet (which has a studio sky and the plants are in visible pots!!) seem like it is enormous enough to run around in while Daleks chase after you. The whole production looks second rate by even the cheap standards of 70s Dr. Who and the script is just another Terry Nation recycling of his earlier stories. But it still manages to be a lot of fun and adventure, especially if watched as the second half of the epic which began with the Frontier in Space.
One thing Nation writes is great first episodes (makes me wonder how good his stories could have been if he'd left out the Daleks altogther once or twice!). This one is great (though Terrance Dicks apparently rewrote much of part one). With the Doctor out cold, Jo gets to be the lead actor for an episode, recoding her thoughts in the pocket sized recording machine that passes for the Tardis log (the prop's just an audio casset box!). Jo explores and records her thoughts and observations and gets into trouble with invisible aliens and killer plants. Katy Manning must have enjoyed this chance to use her acting skills and it is good, if a little stagey. Pertwee ultimately comes alive and strolls through the rest of the tale with customary class. There's a few dodgy bits, but plenty to enjoy. Ignore the plot about 10,000 Daleks off to conquer the Universe with one space ship, it would take an army of trillions to conquer even a small part of a galaxy, but what the hey, this is fun in a Buck Rogers sort of way, and should be enjoyed on that level.",1084752000,,1591,4.4520547945205475
1387083,4,B000051S4W,"Planet Of The Daleks picks up where Frontier In Space ended.  The Doctor has been wounded and after being helped into the TARDIS by Jo, sends a telepathic message to the Time Lords before collapsing.  After landing, Jo goes out for help in a hostile jungle where bizarre plants squirt nasty spores at her.
The Time Lords have sent him to Spiridon, described as ""one of the nastiest pieces of space garbage in the ninth system.  The vegetation is more like animal life than plant, creatures that are hostile to everything including themselves, and a climate that changes from tropical during the day to subfreezing in the night.""
That analysis was given by one of a trio of Thals who rescue the Doctor from near oxygen starvation.  They initially don't trust him, but they team up to fight against Daleks planning to master invisibility, that's a potential ten thousand Daleks who will conquer the galaxy if they succeed.  Of the Thals, Tarron is the cautious leader, Vaber is impatient, wanting action, Codal is scared but courageous, and Latep, has a goofy look on his face when he sees Jo and is smitten.
The Doctor plays counselor to the people he met during his first incarnation.  He gives the self-doubting Codal a ""tutorial on bravery.""  ""Courage isn't just a matter of not being frightened.  It's being afraid and doing what you have to do anyway.""  When Tarron is worried that his lover Rebec being part of the team would affect his command decisions, he is told:  ""The business of command is not for a machine.  The moment we forget we're dealing with people, we're no better than the machines we came to destroy.  If we start acting and thinking like the Daleks, the battle is lost.""  And to the follies of glorifying war:  ""Be careful how you tell that story [of war].  Don't make war sound like an exciting or thrilling game.  Tell them about the fear, otherwise your people might relish the idea of war.  We don't want that.""  No, and neither should we.
The jungle set is really well-realized, as well as the design of the exotic plants.  However, the creatures' eyes on the Plane of Stones are clearly lights flicked on and off.
Bernard Horsfall (Tarron) would play Goth in The Deadly Assassin, and Prentis Hancock's Vaber is a warmup for his role as Salamar in Planet Of Evil.  Roy Skelton has double duty providing Dalek voices and playing the friendly Spiridon native Wester.
This is a fond tribute to the very first Dalek story, and that's what makes this story successful.  There are repeated references and themes to the first Dalek story, beginning with his mention of how he, Barbara, Ian, and Susan, helped the Thals against the Daleks.  Another is the Daleks disabling their victims rather than killing, and there are many more--see how many you can find.  And since Episode 3 is shown in black-and-white (guess what the BBC did with the colour original?) that's a reminder of how old William Hartnell stories were seen.",1028246400,5,2945,4.731372549019608
1387084,4,B000051S4W,"I have little to add to the comprehensive reviews already recorded here.
I am in total agreement about this being one of the best Dalek adventures and as usual the realisation that there are too many episodes. That was one innovation of the Pertwee years that did not work, despite the good intentions. Stretching out the show to the equivalent of a full length movie is a good idea provide that you have the resources to back it up.
The other aspect of this is, as another reviewer has reported, the unfortunate and untimely death of Roger Delgado a.k.a 'The Master', the villain that everyone loved so much. This threw a major spanner in the works as the season in question, Pertwee's last, was essentially conceived of in it's entirety. Planet of the Daleks suffers from a continuity break due to his death and the following story, the Green Deathis conspicuous for having no continuity at all.
However, this has got pretty much everything, invisible inhabitants, Daleks, Thals, jungle, ice, monsters in the dark as in the 'Dead Planet', the works. There is of course the love interest and it is a little surprising when Joe decides to leave and return with the Doctor despite the obvious attraction she has for one of the Thal group which is clearly reciprocated.
There is one question that is not answere about Dalek mobility. It is not clear how they can travel around in the jungle or in the rocky terrain, nor is it accounted for in other stories.
Ultimately it does not detract from what is a great story and one of the best Dalek stories ever.

1387085,5,B000051S4W,"Part of being a ""Doctor Who"" fan is not only having a favorite story, but also having a favorite Doctor. Jon Pertwee, the Third Doctor, has always been my favorite. His charm, courage, wit, intelligence & personality, not to mention  his fancy choice of wardrobe, has always endeared him the most to me of all the Doctors (though I love 'em all!). With ""Planet Of The Daleks,"" Jon Pertwee is given his greatest adventure, and, in my opinion, it's the best ""Doctor Who"" story ever made. It's exciting & greatly entertaining, just like a ""Doctor Who"" classic should be. The six-part ""Planet Of The Daleks"" has it all: the best Doctor (Pertwee, in a terrific performance), the best companion, Jo Grant (the eternally adorable Katy Manning), the legendary Daleks, a great script by Terry Nation, a fine supporting cast playing the Thals (the space travelers who help the Doctor & Jo in their fight against the Daleks), and excellent set pieces in the Spiridon jungle, as well as inside the Daleks' hidden base. Terrific action & drama abounds, with nice bits of humor sprinkled throughout. Not once does this story ever lag, and it always entertains. What more could you WANT from a ""Doctor Who"" story?""Planet Of The Daleks"" is solid, first-rate ""Doctor Who,"" and my personal favorite story of the entire series.

1387086,4,B000051S4W,"Planet of the Daleks concludes the storyline that began in Frontier in Space and does so with a much more compact adventure, unlike the previous story's epic canvas. Here, the Doctor, injured by the Master at the end of Frontier, guides the Tardis to Spiridon to hunt for the Dalek base that is the headquarters for a galaxy-wide invasion. He must first recover his senses, ally himself with a group of Thals that are also searching for the base, and then destroy the base, along with its massive army of 10,000 Daleks. Although the adventure has enough action for most viewers -- especially an exciting chase up a ventilator shaft with the Doctor and his allies hanging on to a balloon while a Dalek hovers up after them -- the story sometimes seems a bit padded, and would probably have worked better as a four parter than the six parter presented here. A scene involving a campfire surrounded by unseen -- except for some unfortunately fake looking eyes in the dark -- monsters seems to go on forever, and doesn't raise suspense so much as it kills some of what's already been built up. However, the final episode more than makes up for this with an intelligent solution to the Doctor's problems and a fine exit for the remainder of the cast. Also on hand is our first viewing of the Supreme Dalek, a different model than the others -- actually one of the Daleks used in the Peter Cushing films -- which adds on to the already established Dalek mythology very nicely. Perhaps this video will appeal more to long time fans than neophyte viewers, but it's one of the better Dalek adventures that's still available to us, and, when watched back-to-back with Frontier in Space, makes for a nice, epic Doctor Who adventure. Note that the third episode is in black and white, but it makes no difference in either quality or enjoyability.",975369600,17,1834,4.6461538461538465

We get to see more of the Thals from a previous Dr. Who episode.  Jo Grant once again steals away the heart of yet another suitor who succumbs to her charms. The Dr. finally gets back together with Jo and fights the Daleks who are trying to steal the invisibility of the Spirodon's to no avail.

'Frontier in Space' has the Master manipulating the Earth Empire and Draconian Empire into all-out war after an unrelated misunderstanding ruined peace negotiations. The Doctor and Jo are mistaken for spies (by both sides), and then it turns out the Master was helping the Daleks. This was Roger Delgado's last appearance on the show: he died in a traffic accident in Turkey while making a movie.

In 'Planet of the Daleks', a large invasion force hibernates on the planet Spiridon. The Daleks want to learn the inhabitants' invisibility secret, and the Thals are there to stop them.
