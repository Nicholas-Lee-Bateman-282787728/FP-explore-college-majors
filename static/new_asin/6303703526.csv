7854582,4,6303703526,"Joan Van Ark stars as radio psychologist, Julie Kaiser (originally Jean Kaiser in the novel), whose parents were killed when she was but ten years old. Now, the man she got put away because she believed he did it, is out after 25 years, and is now after her. However, Julie is beginning to believe that she may have accused the wrong man, and that the ""right man,"" if you will, is after her now!
I think that this film has got some great cinematography, good performances from Joan Van Ark, and a few scary moments. The music score is very cool. I just found something was missing from this movie. I haven't read the book, but I soon will. I do like this movie, even though alot of people don't. It just has a certain quality I like. An above-average TV thriller.",1064966400,2,763,4.3426573426573425
7854583,1,6303703526,"I love Joan Van Ark as I love all of the former Knots Landing ladies, but this film was really awful and unworthy of her talents. The story becomes increasingly implausible as it progresses to its stupid finale. I hate suspense films that revolve around female protagonists being stupid, and this sadly is one of them.",1015459200,,318,4.696428571428571
7854584,2,6303703526,"This movie is neither unique or good. In fact, what makes this flick so memorable is the lovely and sexed-up Joan Van Ark. Van Ark plays a radio psychologist whose parents were murdered when she was a young child. Now it  seems the killer is after her. In order to protect herself and her young  daughter, Van Ark turns to a cop, and the two have one of the steamiest  love scenes in recent memory. Credit the director Nathanial Gutman for not  sullying the scene with corny music . Instead, the scene is silent, with  the exception of panting and moaning (Van Ark even grits her teeth at one  point! ) This scene does make the movie wothwhile, but the hackneyed  ending- complete with a did-you-see-it-coming? would-be plot twist,  destroys all credibility whatsoever. Kudos to Van Ark, though. Forget Pam  or Carmen or Jenny- for two hours, she's the sexiest woman on TV.",951177600,2,873,4.65359477124183
