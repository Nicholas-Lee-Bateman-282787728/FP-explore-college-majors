8520164,5,B007P636EY,"This DVD shows how to hit the Darce from a wide variety of positions.  The DVD covers the Darce from around 15 positions.  There is a second DVD that mainly covers the guillotine in approximately 5 positions and a few of jeff glover's matches.

I believe the greatest aspect of the move/DVD is the simplicity of the technique while being extremely effective.

I recommend this to anyone that wants to learn this one move VERY well.  That being said, I believe this is an interesting way to organize a Jiu Jitsu DVD.  I liked the way the DVD allows you to learn that single finish and have a deep understanding of the infinite ways to apply it.

After watching the DVD I was able to find a darce everywhere when rolling.  It was interesting to see my training partners get frustrated by being tapped by the same finish from everywhere.",1341187200,8,834,4.513333333333334
