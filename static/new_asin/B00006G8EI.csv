1752341,2,B00006G8EI,Je Ne Parle Pas Beaucoup Anglais Alors Excuser Mes Fautes S.V.P . The Image Of The Show Is Good But The Sound Is Bad Because The Voice Of Singer Up And Down Frequently And The 2.0 Surround It's Pitiful,1033257600,4,201,4.17948717948718
1752342,5,B00006G8EI,why did they mix Matthias Jabs' guitar so low in the mix on the live show!  I have to strain to hear him soloing!  The next logical step is to release World Wide Live on DVD in 5.1 surround with tons of extras.  Wouldn't you agree?,1031616000,10,231,3.9782608695652173
1752343,3,B00006G8EI,"The Scorpions are truly one of the best rock bands one can enjoy as much ""live"" as their recorded music.  I enjoy having the ""highlights"" of the Crazy World tour and ""To Russia with Love - A Savage Amusement"" both on this new DVD.
I do wish that they had more origional material on this DVD.
The live/Crazy World portion still has the same flaw that I felt the origional had: the instruments drown out the singer (Klaus Meine). It is almost an EXACT re-hash of their prior two videos mentioned in the above paragraph.
The best part of the DVD, is the crystal clear videos from the polygram/mercury era.  This includes the rare ""Alien Nation"" and a hidden bonus video (go to special features and hit the left directional arrow twice, then enter/select), ""Big City Nights. There are many old Scorpions classics on video such as, ""I'm Leaving You,"" ""Holiday"" and numerous other hits that have never been officially released on a video compilation such as this.
These videos look great and make the purchase worth it for me.",1031616000,8,1020,4.661111111111111
1752344,5,B00006G8EI,"the scorpions have always put on a great show,and this is another of their great ones! i found the whole disc to be a pleaser.although i think the live portion is rather short. the video portion is a great addition to anyones scorps collection. its mix of old and newer videos makes it worth the cash. if your a scorps fan,go for it! you won't be disappointed",1031011200,5,359,4.373134328358209
1752345,5,B00006G8EI,"I have to say that this is an impressive DVD. You get the entire Crazy World Tour video, the First Sting video, plus bits and pieces of 'To Russia With Love'.

I do wish they would have just combined both videos back to back like Def Leppard did with their DVDs, but it's still awesome. The only annoying thing is in between the live songs, the screen fades and the other songs start. I don't know if the original Crazy World video had this or not, but it's annoying.

Of course this DVD has Wind Of Change on it. I finally saw it after seeing it once like 11 years ago on MTV when I was younger. I'm only 22. It did not disappoint me.

Overall the only disappointment I have is that the scorps cut out a lot of footage that made 'To Russia with Love' great. If only they would combine all their vhs videos. First Sting, World Wide Live, To Russia With Love, & Crazy World. That would be a bonus!!",1030752000,,897,4.14367816091954
1752346,5,B00006G8EI,I saw the Scorpions just recently in late July.  What a rockin show it was as they brought down the house.  After being out of the country for a nice vacation I came home to see this DVD available.  I love it!  The package is 12 live songs from a concert in Berlin during the early nineties.  The band plays with great energy and it is a very entertaining concert. All of the songs are post Lovedrive which is my only complaint.  There are also 10 or so very enjoyable music videos that the band has done over the years.  Some of these are the racy unrated versions. Picture and sound quality are excellent on the live show.  The videos are not as clear but totally acceptable.  A treasure for Scorpions fans.,1030579200,2,709,4.3106060606060606
1752347,4,B00006G8EI,"Great to see some of the footage from Scorps thru these years but I've only seen it mentioned in one other review so I'll mention it again:

The big downside to the live show presented here is the fact aside from sloppy/out of synch editing, there are many vocals and guitar parts that have been rather sloppily overdubbed.  This 'fabricated' feel really kinda makes it a sweet and sour experience to watch.  I wonder why it was so heavily dubbed, the Scorpions were playing great thru this time period.

Four stars for the overall package which also features videos and interviews, but if you're mainly interested in the live show try to pick it up on the cheap.

I wish I could find some good quality Footage/Audio of a Savage Amusement concert featuring a live performance of Don't Stop at The Top, Walking On The Edge or Media Overkill....",1231113600,,843,4.630872483221476
1752348,5,B00006G8EI,"This was great to see the 1991 concert footage and listen to the older songs like ""Can't Live without You"" and ""Hit Between the Eyes"" and ""Lust of Love"" and of course ""Crazy World"" as I have never had the privilege of seeing the Scorpions LIVE. The music was intense and it really ROCKS YOU!!! I was also really excited to get all of the Scorpions music Videos that are also on the DVD. Rock ON!!!",1208736000,,397,4.2368421052631575
1752349,2,B00006G8EI,"When the live portion of this DVD was FIRST released on VHS I was disappointed with it, due to the horrible mix. Jabs' guitar is so low it's barely audible (and he's the main soloist, for those who don't know tha band) and Meine's vocals could also do to be higher.

I was hoping this DVD would have corrected this shortcoming, since it spoils my enjoyment considerably. Indeed, it's made it difficult to play more than once or twice. However, this DVD seems a straight copy of the VHS. Maybe the original master no longer exists: if it did they could have made this into the full gig, maybe, or redressed the mix.

In a word, frustrating.",1197417600,,639,4.452991452991453
1752350,5,B00006G8EI,"As a long time fan of Scorpions (since 1984) I was really looking forward to getting this DVD. Not only was I NOT disappointed, I was also finding myself so excited by the fantastic concert footage, I thought I was going to scream. I am an older adult but found I wanted to squeal like a young girl watching these guys in their element; LIVE. They are one of the few rock bands who feed off the frenzied excitement and adoration of their audience and give a performance that is out of this SAVAGE CRAZY WORLD. Their music videos are enjoyable because you can see they had so much fun making them. But as a skilled LIVE band, not many groups can come close to the powerful performances of The Scorpions in front of their fans. If you are or are not a Scorps fan, you will enjoy our favorite boys from Germany bringing all they've got to us; to entertain, enlighten, and energize. UP THE SCORPS!",1173484800,,893,4.3532934131736525
1752351,4,B00006G8EI,"Scorpions are always good in live, so this dvd is original scorpions dvd. The penalty is about the recording tech of sound.
It must be released again in dolby digital sound or DTS.If someone want to see only the live without care about tech...
...then my personal recommended is 5 star at least.",1070064000,2,295,4.584905660377358
1752352,5,B00006G8EI,"Just as I hoped it would be -- live shots as well as artistically created videos. My ONLY disappointment was that the song ""Holiday"" is only the short version. The second part of the song is fantastic and I was hoping it would be included. DVD shows a wide variety of songs from many different albums and you can choose each song individually, or you can select ""play all"". Klaus' voice is right-on throughout the entire series and each musician's talents are featured in detail. As a total ""Rudolf devotee"", it's fantastic because you can hear every lick perfectly. A definite MUST for Scorpions fans!",1060732800,3,602,4.742857142857143
1752353,2,B00006G8EI,"The Scorpions are (were?) a good rock band. Their live performances were characteristic of the band, particularly in the eighties. This DVD attempts to capture early nineties performances but it is unsuccessful. Scorpions used to have a lot of interaction with the audience, had awesome encores and were energetic. Neither of these characteristics is shown in the DVD. They seemed bored. In addition, the edition breaks between song and song making the video a show of isolated boring songs. The bottom line: the concert section smells too bad.
The videos section is OK, it would have been nice if they had included more classics. That's why I give them two stars.",1060387200,,664,4.990990990990991
1752354,2,B00006G8EI,"If, like me, you are a long-time fan of German rockmeisters Scorpions, this is a nice look at the live and studio output of the band in the 1990s.
This DVD combines 12 songs from a live concert in Berlin in 1991 with a motley collection of 14 music videos.
The Scorpions run through some classics, including ""The Zoo"", ""Dynamite"" and ""Blackout"", in the live concert and even throw in a nice cover of The Who's ""I Can't Explain"". The playing is strong and the music was mixed rather nicely.
Strangely, there are fade-outs after every song in the live section of the DVD, and it isn't possible to watch the concert performance without these cuts! The person responsible for this decision should take a few classes in making a good DVD.
The video on the live section is fair, but the quality of the the music videos ranges from poor (""Rock You Like A Hurricane"") to very good (""Send Me An Angel"" and ""Wind Of Change"").
The audio is available in plain Dolby Digital 2.0 or PCM stereo and the video, given its origins, is only 4:3 without any anamorphic enhancement.
If you want a visual document of Scorpions in the 1990s, this DVD will do till somebody decides to release the excellent ""World Wide Live"" on DVD. Otherwise, you can safely give it a miss.",1044230400,2,1250,4.511013215859031
1752355,3,B00006G8EI,"A great live band captured in an average show. still rocks, and much better than the ""Moment of Glory"" DVD, but the ""World Wide Live"" concert released on VHS is much better",1040947200,2,172,4.40625
1752356,3,B00006G8EI,"First, the live part. The image quality is ok, the sound quality is not too good, but it works. The problem, however, is that the sound is badly synced with the image, so it almost looks like those German dubbed movies. The obvious reason for this is that it actually is dubbed, which is easily seen when Rudolf Schenkers guitar changes color in the middle of the songs. When it comes to the videos, the newer ones are ok, the older ones are blurry and often contains scan lines. Some are almost as low quality as the 50mb divx movies flying arond on kazaa and similar services.
Since I'm a big fan of the Scorpions, I would still have bought this DVD if I knew what I know today. But I have to say that the mastering of this dvd is so bad that it would barely keep a movie editing student from failing the course.",1038787200,,814,4.2243589743589745

The sound quality is the worst I have ever heard on a official DVD . The videos are better to watch on VEVO.com , Simply horrible quality .",1441065600,,283,3.982456140350877

7968095,5,B00006G8EI,This DVD is real good.  Good concert footage and they sound like the classic Scorpions that burst on the scene in the US in the early 80s on MTV.  Good stuff.,1389744000,,158,4.064516129032258
7968096,5,B00006G8EI,Me encanta la musica y sobre todo colecciono videos todos los titulos que pueda conseguir y esta compra es uno de ellos,1354665600,,119,4.454545454545454
7968097,1,B00006G8EI,"This dvd has the worst sound quality, It goes in and out. Like this is a copy from another copy from another copy...VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!",1283472000,,142,4.72
7968098,5,B00006G8EI,"This dvd is well worth the price if only for the videos alone, but it does include an outstanding live concert, filmed in Berlin, during their ""Crazy World Tour"" 1991.

Note: If you have a Universal DVD player, it may display a symbol of a camera & 1/2 on the screen. This happened to me. However, it does not happen if you use a region 1 (U.S.A. & Canada) dvd player. Plus, even with the Universal dvd player, it is tolerable, the dvd functions as usual with the exception of the above.

This German Hard Rocking Band has been performing since the early 1970's, and they are still rocking now. This is one on the Best Hard Rocking Bands in the World. This particular dvd contains some of their best songs, either included in the live concert, or in the music videos or both. It contains a lot the material that was on the ""To Russia With Love"" VHS, which I have. Mikhail Gorbachev (Leader of the Former Soviet Union at the time) became one of their fans, and soon after they performed ""Wind of Change"" in Russia, the Berlin Wall soon came down, which reunited Berlin, and also the Soviet Union soon fell. It just goes to show, music can make a difference, and this band is not even a ""political band"".

Well so much for history. Now the DVD. The Concert is awesome. These guys are performers, and they put 100%+ effort into every performance. The guitar playing is outstanding, very hard rocking and performed in a very ""showmanship"" way.

The Concert Song Set Consists of the following:
1. Bad Boys Running Wild
2. Hit Between the eyes
3. I Can't Explain
4. The Zoo
5. Rhythm of Love (One of their best songs ever!!!)
6. Crazy World
7. Can't Live without You
8. Blackout
9. Dynamite
10. Lust or Love
11. Big City Nights
12. Rock You Like A Hurricane (Another one of their best songs ever!!!)

The Videos: (They ROCK!!!!)
1. Rhythm of Love (Uncensored version) Fantastic!!!
2. Believe in Love (Russian Version) Great!!!
3. Walking on the Edge (Russian version) Outstanding!!!!
4. Rock You Like a Hurricane (Russian version) Totally Awesome!!!!!
5. Still Loving You
6. Passion Rules the Game (Uncensored version) Excellent!!!
7. Tease Me Please Me
8. Don't Believe Her
9. Send my an Angel
10. Wind of Change (A Great Message Song, that helped to bring down the Berlin Wall.)

Bonus Videos:
11. Alien Nation
12. Holiday
13. No One Like You
14. I'm Leaving You

Plus, in this dvd package, you get an excellent booklet, that describes the details of this concert and the music videos. If you like some of the best Hard Rock in the world, you'll love this one. I know I do. Thanks!!!",1264723200,2,2579,4.521459227467811
7968099,4,B00006G8EI,"If you like Scorpions, get it, if not that's up to you.  The VIDEOS are great old and new (then). The live is not soooo bad, there's Francis and Herman laying down the rhythm solidly.  I don't know how bad the quality of sound is, but, There's plenty of good material here.  I like it however it could be better (as you read these reviews, that's clear).  4 stars for content.  And please, release WWL on DVD!!!!!!!!!!",1254268800,,418,4.376623376623376
