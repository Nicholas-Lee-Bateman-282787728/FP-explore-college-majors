Rick Steves, who is the best tour guide in the business, only covers Europe and a few countries in the Middle East. I bought this DVD hoping that it would tell me about the sites in Japan's largest cities like Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto. Instead, it was essentially a few vignettes about random Japanese people- a woman training to be a geisha, two high school girls living in Tokyo, an elderly scuba diver, a fisherman, an engineering professor who builds robots, and a tattoo artist. It also focused too much on nature and not enough on Japanese culture. This was not what I was looking for.",1421280000,,692,4.634146341463414
8299954,3,B001EYV2Y4,"I agree, this is not the best documentary made about Japan, and I admit that I was a little bit disappointed by it. However this is still a good documentary, with a lot of interesting informations about this great and fascinating Country. The biggest problem I have with this DVD is that it's only 43 minutes long, not even an hour, so this was really disappointing to me, but overall it's a good DVD to add to your collection. :)",1309132800,,430,4.3875
8299955,2,B001EYV2Y4,"Having spent 39 months in Japan, I was disappointed in the content and brevity of the DVD. Too much time on the subject of Geisha and not enough time on the architectural and natural beauty of Japan.",1294012800,6,199,4.405405405405405
8299956,4,B001EYV2Y4,Good video for someone interested in Japanese culture. Could be used with a class of intermediate or high school students. Reasonable balance between historic sights and modern Japanese culture.,1249430400,3,194,5.724137931034483
8299957,1,B001EYV2Y4,For the price I expect a lot more. But it was just average quality. I would shop around for a better value. And the length of the video is short for the price.,1241654400,2,159,3.8484848484848486
8299958,5,B001EYV2Y4,This film is one of the best to introduce Japan and Japanese culture to non-Japanese people.  I've been teaching Japanese culture over 7 years and figured out this film is the finest material to endorse what I try to explain about Japan.,1229385600,8,237,4.642857142857143
