4237418,5,B003ZZ7TLA,"I really like all the workouts on this dvd.  It has great instructors that give good, clear directions on just what to do, when and how.
 The shorter workouts like these I love to use as fill ins to complete my workout time and keep my workouts using the same amount of time three times a week.
 I have never done a workout with Rodney Yee and it was a super experience.  Now, I will probably order more of his workouts.
 I already have workouts with the other intructors in this dvd but these were new and exciting workouts!",1299456000,,525,4.262626262626263
4237419,5,B003ZZ7TLA,"I was very excited when this DVD came out.  The instructors for these segments are Rodney Yee, Ana Caban, Tanja Djelevic, and Suzanne Deason.  I love and regularly workout to exercise DVD's by Rodney Yee (RY), Ana Caban (AC), and Suzanne Deason (SD).  I've never exercised to a DVD by Tanja Djelevic (TD).  The DVD includes nine individual segments and options to customize the workouts.  The purpose of this DVD is so you can cross train with yoga (RY & SD), Pilates (AC), and cardio (TD).

 The Main Menu has three sections: Express Body Target Workouts, Total Body Workouts, and Custom Workout.  The Express Body Target Workout section contains Upper Body Cardio Toning (17 min, TD), Lower Body Cardio Toning (13 min, TD), Ten Zen Core (10 min, TD), Yoga Lower Body Target Toning (25 min, SD), Yoga Upper Body Target Toning (15 min, RY), and Yoga Core Express (6 min, RY & SD).  You can select the individual workouts in the Express Body Target Workout section or play them all.  The Total Body Workouts section contains Total Body Cardio Toning (30 min, TD), Total Body Pilates (18 min, AC), and Total Body Yoga (47 min, SD).  You can only play them individually when you select them from the Total Body Workouts section.  However, the Custom Workout section allows you to play any combination of the 9 workouts in any order!

 Gaiam has a habit of repackaging previous workouts.  I have to say I don't recognize any of these workouts from anything I've done before, except the Upper Body Rodney Yee.  I have done so many Rodney Yee DVDs over the years I'm not sure which one this is from, except I recognize his teeny, tiny black Speedo brief. ;)  However, maybe he just likes to wear it, and this is new routine.  :) Judging by the clothes, all the Tanja Djelevic (TD) express sections seem to come from the same shoot.  If you have a DVD by any of the instructors on the DVD and want to know if it's on here, give me a description in the comment section on Amazon, and we can try to figure out.  All that being said, for me this DVD is worth it because it would be hard to mix and match all these different workouts like you can on this DVD without repeatedly loading and unloading a bunch of DVDs.

 If you have ever completed a workout by any of these instructors, then you know to expect a great workout!  If you are new to any of these instructors, then you should know that they each have released many DVDs, and there is a reason - they are excellent at what they do!  This is the first time I have completed a workout by Tanja Djelevic.  I have other DVDs I prefer over her workouts, but I did think she did a good job and would be great for an exercise beginner or for an intermediate exerciser like me on lighter days.  I already love Rodney Yee, Ana Caban and Suzanne Deason.  I recommend this DVD to anyone.",1291680000,47,2825,4.413926499032882

4237421,5,B003ZZ7TLA,This is one of my favorite workout videos. There is a variety of exercises yoga Pilates and abs,1413676800,,95,4.333333333333333
4237422,3,B003ZZ7TLA,"While I like the exercises and instructors on this DVD, they appear to be taken from older Gaiam workout videotapes and DVDs. I already owned almost all of them on various other Gaiam videos/DVDs. Also, the DVD I received is defective. Some of the tracks won't play on our DVD player, although they do play on another DVD player.",1387324800,,329,4.593220338983051
4237423,5,B003ZZ7TLA,"One note: the ""ten"" to which the title refers is actually 10 options, not separate workouts.  So you can do upper body yoga, lower body yoga, or both combined into one--and that is 3 options.  This isn't a big deal, really, but a bit confusing when I first received it.

You also have the choice of shorter or longer workouts--""Yoga Core Express"" is 6 minutes and ""Total Body Yoga"" is 47 minutes!  This is great for mixing and matching workouts or rounding out other exercise you do during the day.  You can choose workouts of cardio, yoga, Pilates, and core work.

I can't say enough about Tanja Djelevic!  Her cardio is challenging, her style rewarding.  She's actually the reason I bought this and I was *not* disappointed!  I've lost over 10 pounds so far and feel fantastic!",1378598400,5,779,4.627737226277373
4237424,4,B003ZZ7TLA,"I like this video, though there is something wrong with the tracking. When I first put the video in, it does the advertising intros, then goes straight to the yoga section. I have to hit menu to select what I want. Then if I select the lower body yoga, a few minutes into it, it starts repeating the track from the beginning. I don't think the ""designing your own workout"" function works on my DVD -- after I selected my options, it wouldn't start.

In spite of that, I like the variety this video offers, between yoga, pilates and cardio. (The pilates is difficult!) The yoga is relaxing and I like the lower body yoga workout the best. The transition isn't great between the yoga workouts -- you end up lying on the floor at the end of the first one, and then without warning have to get up for a variety of moves for the second yoga workout (upper body). The upper body yoga and core yoga workouts are faster and don't have any explanation for how to do the moves -- just gotta watch and learn.",1363219200,2,997,4.303191489361702
4237425,3,B003ZZ7TLA,"Tanja and Suzanne save this video.  Anna is just okay.  Rodney, although beautiful to watch, the sound muffled his voice and there is no instruction for the asanas (poses). He offers no cautions or modifications to the viewer and is hardly therapeutic yoga practice.  The Rodney segments are more yoga dance with the backup ladies in snyc.  I was truly disappointed as I bought this video hoping all the yoga segments would be useful.  Unless, you are familiar with Rodney's work his segments/routines. I have both Tanya's and Suzanne's DVD's and practice with them frequently.  We all approach exercise, yoga, and fitness from different viewpoints and different levels, as well as, ages.",1346284800,,688,5.098214285714286
4237426,2,B003ZZ7TLA,"I know it is not a reflection on the dvd itself but it really annoys me that Gaiam repackages some if their workouts and markets them like they are new. I actually already owned two of the workouts, but the pictures on the box were different than the ones on the dvds that I own. So, clearly I recommended the cardio and one of the yoga sections :o) The other yoga section (not the one with Rodney Yee) is a little too simple for me and I feel like it is more stretching than working out.",1322870400,,488,4.09375
4237427,5,B003ZZ7TLA,"Excellent DVD really enjoy it, shame that the DVD has a problem as I cant really send it back to replace so will probably have to buy another one once someone ships to my address in New Zealand.
Worth buying tho and just a little different to some of Rodneys other stuff that I have.",1314144000,,283,4.163636363636364
4237428,5,B003ZZ7TLA,"This is one of the best fitness videos I have ever purchased. And, I have been a fitness instructor going on 35 years now -- so I am fairly picky. The variety is great, and all fitness levels can easily adapt to the exercises. Even though I lift weights and do cardio 5-6 times, per week, these routines made me sore! It was very refreshing to have this challenge.",1313539200,14,364,4.2898550724637685
4237429,2,B003ZZ7TLA,"I just bought this DVD and feel as if more than 1/2 of it is wasted.  More than 1/2 of it is led by Tanja Djelevic who uses countless cliche little workout phrases and a cutsy little voice which is cute once but not all the way through the workouts.  Many of the routines seem to have beens stolen from Karen Voight who is a professional trainer.

Rodney Yee and Suzanne Deason are professional and are the only thing that saves this DVD.",1303603200,,438,4.253012048192771

8411388,4,B003ZZ7TLA,"This DVD offers a lot.  There is a lot to choose from.  There is cardio, toning, Pilates, yoga and more!  The routines range from 10 minutes to 60 and you can combine then to make longer more intense workouts.  There are a lot of different trainers and they all seem to be great.  I believe the routines are probably all from other full length DVDs but I don't own any of them so they are all new and great to me.  But if you have a lot of Giam DVDs be careful you might already have some of them!",1445904000,,497,3.9696969696969697
8411389,3,B003ZZ7TLA,"I really enjoyed the videos and workouts on this. I've owned this DVD twice now...and its so hard to get out of the case, that its broken twice. It might be silly, but I'm not buying this again because the case is so cheap/poorly made. If you get this, I think you'll enjoy the videos, but don't keep it in the original case!",1443744000,,325,4.174603174603175
8411390,2,B003ZZ7TLA,"I have many different exercise DVD's - this one I bought because you could ""mix & match"" exercises, however, the mix and match part didn't work. I don't know if it's the fault of the DVD OR my DVD player.
The Yoga section was not my favorite. I have a Rodney Yee video and it's much better because it explains moves - this rushes through moves and if you don't know what you're doing, I think you'll be quite frustrated.
Also - it seems like a dated Yoga episode (the outfits the ladies were wearing were horrible - very distracting!).
Love Chrissy Carters videos best. Still can't find any I like as well!",1440374400,,606,4.371681415929204
8411391,3,B003ZZ7TLA,"The sections I get to view are very good workouts.  Unfortunately this DVD skips.  I've never got to see what the pilate sections are like, for example, and the Lower Body Yoga is also out of my reach.",1426032000,,201,4.2631578947368425
8411392,1,B003ZZ7TLA,I would have given the content 5 stars but I can't get certain segments of the DVD to play.  I don't know if this is a one time defect on the DVD that was sent to me or if everyone that has purchased this DVD has had the same issue.  The total body  pilates segment won't play at all.  It returns me to the selection menu and one yoga segment does the same thing.  Very disappointed!! :(,1425513600,,387,3.9740259740259742
8411393,5,B003ZZ7TLA,I love that it has a whole bunch of different workout types and lengths to choose from without having to get 10 different dvd's...,1419897600,,130,4.458333333333333
8411394,2,B003ZZ7TLA,"I don't write reviews really but had to come say I've never gotten so frustrated on the mat as I did attempting to do the yoga portions of this with Rodney Yee. He does absolutely zero instructing, simply barks next posture title (only once so hope you hear it!) and then gives no instructions as to what that might mean. If you are unfamiliar with the postures, you could hurt yourself trying to do them simply by looking at what he does and he has zero modifications provided. He also gives no time between some postures, he barks updog and the next breath barks downdog, you aren't even in updog yet. I am glad I got this on EBay for 99cents! The Pilates and core and aerobic workouts may be great but I bought it for the yoga and if that is what you're buying it for, find a different DVD. Sean Corn Detox Flow and Namaste TV are two of my favorites.",1419897600,,854,4.245398773006135
