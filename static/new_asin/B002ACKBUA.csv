3883734,5,B002ACKBUA,"This was the best season of Transformers.  There were no silly episodes, just good, old-fashioned, 80's robot bashing cheese.  These were the episodes before Hasbro started throwing in new characters every time you looked (with little or no introduction to them, just pretending like they were there all along).  If you only are going to buy one season of Transformers G1, this should be it.",1490745600,,391,4.984615384615385

3883752,5,B002ACKBUA,This was a lot of fun to watch. This has I think the first 4 or 5 episodes from the original show on it. You can set the disc to play all and watch them back to back. My son loves it. It's fun to see the old story line and animation as long as your feeling nostalgic.,1439337600,,267,3.6206896551724137

3883757,5,B002ACKBUA,Transformers : More Than Meets the Eye! Season 1!  I can't say enough about this cartoon. It's has some great story lines and concepts about transforming robots. This is the first season of the original Transformers: Generation 1 series. I grew up in the 1980s so I like this very much.  Transformers: more than meets the eye  is a great animated series,1421712000,11,353,4.661290322580645
3883758,5,B002ACKBUA,I brought this item as a gift for my boyfriend. He loves it! And watches it all the time.,1421193600,,89,3.736842105263158
3883759,5,B002ACKBUA,"If you are a true Transformers connoisseur and grew up watching this in the 80s, then having this is not even an option. Not having this is sacrilegious and amounts to treason.",1419120000,7,176,4.53125
3883760,5,B002ACKBUA,It was shipped quickly.  My Grandson loves it.,1416787200,,46,4.75
3883761,5,B002ACKBUA,This is a fun movie.  My Grandson loves it.  I highly recommend this product.,1412812800,,77,4.428571428571429
3883762,5,B002ACKBUA,This dvd contains the pilot episodes for transformers. this is a great show. if you have not seen season 1 then i recommend you do,1339718400,,130,4.24
3883763,5,B002ACKBUA,"According to most of the reviewers who purchased this DVD from Amazon, the disc included the original three-episode arc ""More Than Meets The Eye"" that opened season one of the first Transformers series. This, plus the addition of two extra episodes, would make for a nice introduction for those just discovering the Transformers animated series. However...

I got this DVD from a different store, and even though the cover and disc image say ""More Than Meets the Eye,"" it actually contains the first half of Transformers Season One. It is in fact Disc One from the Season One DVD with new packaging. This means that anyone who buys it might actually be getting EIGHT episodes.

That, my Transformers-loving friends, is truly excellent.",1313625600,,735,5.016393442622951
3883764,5,B002ACKBUA,"I was ecstatic to learn that they had the original Transformers on DVD.  I am share the cartoon I loved as a child with my children!  And let me tell you, my oldest boy is 5 and he asks to see this DVD every single day.",1310774400,,219,3.739130434782609
3883765,5,B002ACKBUA,"It was great to type in Transformers and then see a DVD that I saw when I was a kid growing up. I had no choice but to buy it and give it to my nephew as a gift for going to the 2nd grade! His eyes were so wide opened when he saw it, reminded me of when I saw the episode on TV. Next are all my transformers in boxes to give him!! Thank you for having this DVD for sale and what a great price!!",1309219200,,394,3.4886363636363638
3883766,5,B002ACKBUA,"I bought this as an xmas gift for a son's friend who is 5.  He didn't really appreciate the magnitude of the new Transformers Series but really liked the concept.  So, I thought the original cartoon series might be a good idea...and he concurred!",1293926400,3,246,4.568181818181818
3883767,5,B002ACKBUA,"This is great if you have never seen Transformers Gen 1. This DVD shows the first 5 episodes of Gen 1, however if you buy season 1 you still get the same episodes plus a lot more.",1259107200,15,179,3.864864864864865
3883768,5,B002ACKBUA,"...because of the corrections and the ORIGINAL BROADCAST audio tracks -- none of that digital 5.1 additions that didn't sound right on the Rhino sets.
After getting spoiled with the Filmation Masters of the Universe documentaries, I was more than disappointed in the TF History documentary on this set.  Also, I would have loved to see more original G1 toy commercials.
All in all, this set takes me back to my childhood more than the Rhino sets for its sound and looks when watching ""Divide and Conquer"" or ""The Ultimate Doom"".",1255132800,2,528,4.802197802197802
3883769,4,B002ACKBUA,"This Transformers: More than Meets the Eye DVD presents the first five episodes of the Transformers: Generation One series. the Transformers episodes are: More Than Meets the Eye parts 1-3, Transport to Oblivion, and Roll for It. This Transformers DVD has no special features on it and only has first five episodes of the original G1 TF series. Highly Recommended if you have never seen the original G1 Transformers cartoon series from the 1980s. A+",1254528000,4,449,5.0
3883770,3,B002ACKBUA,"This DVD contains the first mini series that kick-started the phenomenon; if you're already a fan, the season 1 or the complete collection is probably more worth your while and money; but as far as introduction DVDs go, this is quite nice for newbies who want to get a feel for the cartoon and research it.

It comes in a nice see-through jewel case; and as far as completists like myself are concerned, the picture on the disc is slightly different than the season 1 first disc... the picture disc has a different background color (blue like the DVD cover), but that's all; it is possible to find the DVD for $8.27 elsewhere.  Note: The individual series set releases have picture discs that are NOT the same as the 16 DVD complete set release.

The GI Joe mini-series introduction DVD, for those interested, has a completely different picture on the disc that's not the same as the season 1.1 disc, picturing three fighter jets with the jetstream smoke forming the red white and blue colors behind it; which I was excited to add to my collection, even if it's repeat content.",1252540800,6,1077,4.628272251308901
