8616504,3,B00FKTCX38,"I really wanted to like this. The concept, context, and framework of the story are all interesting and promising. There are several moments when Wong makes funny jokes and sharp social commentary. She also gets vulnerable at times during stark, sobering scenes. However, the overall production is disjointed. Some elements could have used more elaboration, while others would have been better off omitted altogether.

I decided to check this out after reading an xoJane article written by Wong. Unfortunately the five-minute read showed much more insight and significance than this eighty-minute show. Or perhaps that's a good thing for Wong: since the article is more recent, it could indicate some growth and maturity.",1432944000,,720,5.371681415929204
8616505,2,B00FKTCX38,"This just wasn't funny or insightful. Bought this because I loved reading her xoJane articles and I wanted to support fellow Asian American talent, but it was all over the place, disjointed and a slog to get through. Her James Franco rant makes me side with James Franco and think that maybe she didn't really rock the commencement speech and she's sensitive to criticism.",1413936000,2,372,4.828125
8616506,5,B00FKTCX38,"So funny and thought provoking.  I just stumbled on this and loved it.  Kristina is great in this daring and original piece.  I am sorry to say I had never heard of Ms Wong, but this show is amazing and entertaining and touching and sharp. And the DVD fully captures the spark of live theatre, so often missing in filmed theater . I loved it and cannot think of enough good things to say about it.",1406678400,,397,4.197368421052632
8616507,5,B00FKTCX38,"I saw this film in my Clinical Psychology course and the play was remarkable, very modern and a great way to express the current issue with Asian American Women. I want to learn more about Asian American Women and how they are misrepresented and how their history was written by the white male perspective. This film is a great way to learn about the issues going on in the Asian American Community and how society does not help in their psychological needs. We need more women to represent, especially minority women. It's very funny how the feminist movement within the white community was to work and gain independence in voting, however minority women have been working the first second they set foot in America. People need to learn to distinguish between the Feminist movement, and how Asian American Women and Latina Women are not part of this white feminist women, rather they have their own separate battle and their own important part in American history. This film is a great way to learn the current issues with the Asian community and a great actress who puts the passion behind it. Good film! :)",1334102400,4,1109,4.751295336787565
