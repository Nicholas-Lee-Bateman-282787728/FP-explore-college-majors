2780711,4,B000NQRR4I,"This is the identical series that PBS released on VHS about 10 years ago. (And boy was I glad to find it on DVD!)
This series is not only interesting and entertaining, it's worth owning because after you've watched it a dozen times, it becomes the perfect cure for insomnia. The score is an absolute lullaby; Linda Hunt's voice is that of a kindly great-aunt; the backgrounds are always a soft, impressionist blue-green... even the marine life seems pretty casual about avoiding devourment by languid predators. It's not boring by any means, but you might want to set the timer on your TV if watching it in bed.

The film makers clearly spent a lot of time analyzing animal behavior and caught some spectacular sequences. (My personal favorite was the hapless octopus who accidentally bumbles into a sexually-unsuccessful male garibaldi's nest, gets chased away from there into the den of a moray eel who bites off one of his tentacles, then finally the poor octopus is staggering around when a harbor seal happens by and casually snaps him up. Tragic, but also a little bit of inky-black humor.) And some bizarre inter-species relationships, which were pretty surprising.

However, the Bonus-Disk that was tacked-on by Reader's Digest is bad enough to cost the rating one star. The narration is cheesy to the point of sounding like a parody of the corny marine life documentaries in the post-Coustea 70's, (with an accidental nod to Team Zissou.)

There are more thorough and more academic marine life films available, but this combination of pleasing imagery, music, and Linda Hunt's bedtime-story narration make this a masterpiece worth owning.",1258934400,7,1647,5.0256410256410255

2780713,4,B000NQRR4I,"This is another good DVD about oceans, fish, divers etc.. Not as good as Planet Earth, but quite informative none the less. The colors are not as  vibrant, nor as consistent as other DVD'S of this type. There are, however, some great Whale shots. Also the narrators voice is lovely, it allows this documentary to flow. Better for older kids or adults, too repetitive for the younger set",1217462400,3,386,4.676470588235294

Nov 2009 update - I have since seen many other underwater films, but Ocean Realm still continues to be my favourite.  I've loaned my disks out several times, always with a glowing review when they're returned.  These are the sort of shots that I can only dream about as a snorkeller.",1195430400,14,507,4.456521739130435
