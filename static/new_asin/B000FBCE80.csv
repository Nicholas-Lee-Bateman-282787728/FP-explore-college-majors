Not since Beethoven's ""Wellington's Victory"" has a piece been written that failed miserably because it required more technology than what was then available.  This is definitely music for the serious musician or those who are just plain nuts, or good for telling boring company it's time to go -- full blast!",1383264000,,328,4.945454545454545

8119884,5,B000FBCE80,This is fantastic.  Great story.  Great music.  I agree with the previous reviewer on all points except the one where he states that all musicians should see it.  Those of us who are non musicians but love or or trying to understand 20th century music should see it too.  Many many thanks to those who I think put in an insane amount of work to pull this thing off.,1235001600,4,365,4.231884057971015
8119885,5,B000FBCE80,"Last weekend I had the honor to view the final cut of a film at the Doc Kountze Film Festival called Bad Boy Made Good. This film brought to life a piece of music that, when it was created in the 1920's, was ahead of its time. What the composer, George Antheil, had in mind when he created Ballet Mecanique, was not possible to deliver to audiences until the 1990s. The work is a composition which includes the following instruments: two grand pianos, three xylophones, four bass drums, and a tam-tam, 16 synchronized player pianos, sirens, bells and 3 airplane propellers. I sh** you not.  It is truly a spectacle, er, spectacular piece.

This documentary includes the evolution of the project as well as the evolution of the life of George Antheil. I don't think that I can describe this with any justice, but because this topic was so far outside of my circle of knowledge, I was completely riveted by this film. I was surprised at what an important part of contemporary musical history (something that we don't hear much about in mainstream channels save for Aaron Copeland) that I felt genuinely enlightened. George's life (I feel so connected that I can call him by his first name) held a lot of the same struggles musicians have today and maybe even on a grander scale because of his ingeniousness. Every musician should see this film for obvious reasons and everyone else should catch a glimpse just to be inspired.

Two thumbs up!",1152057600,11,1439,4.679841897233201
