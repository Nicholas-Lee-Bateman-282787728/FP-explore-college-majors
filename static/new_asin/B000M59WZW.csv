I usually like his pace and location choices... however, I felt this video was a fast paced martial arts lesson that was too complicated to be fun and does not feel like very much of a workout. I think this one will be collecting dust on my CD shelf.",1198627200,8,332,3.970149253731343
2725395,5,B000M59WZW,"This is the best kickboxing cardio dvd I have in my collection.  This dvd is fun and rewarding if you can get to the end!  Seriously, this man knows how to get your body sweating and in serious shape.  I bought this video when I was just getting back into working out, and I couldn't get past the first 15 minutes.  This is for those who have been working out for a while, and looking for high intense cardio.  Not for newbies, though I would suggest getting it now, and then poping it in once your old cardio dvds get too easy.  I love it!",1191801600,14,540,4.095238095238095
2725396,4,B000M59WZW,"I first try out workout DVDs through Netflix.  And that has saved me a ton of money.  Even though it was Gilad, and I've got a couple of his already, I put it on my list to 'try before I buy.'
Good warm-up, great  cardio, 40+ minutes of mostly kick-boxing stuff.  But not a very good strength or cool-down segment which is why I gave it four stars.  Another ten minutes or so of strength and a cool-down to equal the warm-up and I would have gone for 5 stars.
Still, I felt this one in my legs for a couple days because, although it doesn't feel like it during the workout, your quads, calves and inner thighs are working hard.  And that is where you really need a good stretching segment.
So, I'll put this on my list and probably get it in a few weeks, as the holiday season nears and I need the variety to get motivated to stick to my workouts.",1189555200,13,847,4.1030303030303035
2725397,5,B000M59WZW,"This cool dvd workout has been filmed on an actual US Navy aircraft carrier.  That's a first I think.  Anyway, this is the second dvd of Gilad's that I've bought and I'm very impressed with it.
It's a bootcamp kickboxing workout.  The exercisers are civillians and Navy sailors and Marines.  It's easy to follow, but it's no nonsense either just like you'd expect in a bootcamp workout.  There is the classic kickboxing type moves and a good amount of core workout too.  The moves are taught as basically as possible, and then he adds layers to these moves to make them more challenging.  All you really need is some weights and energy and you're good to go.
The change of scenery is refreshing and Gilad's friendly (but very motivating) approach is just enough to push you through to the end.  He's a great instructor and based on this dvd, I'd go out and get more of his workouts.  I really like this one a lot.",1185321600,42,913,4.484848484848484

2725399,3,B000M59WZW,"I was a little disappointed with this workout.  A lot of it was built around what I think must be hand-to-hand combat moves.  I was really looking for more of a straight-forward cardio workout (ie: jumping jacks, lunges, squats, etc.).  Gilad is as usual a great teacher, but I prefer his other workouts a lot more.",1178064000,9,315,4.589285714285714

2725417,3,B000M59WZW,"I have several of Gilad's DVDs and am very happy with them. I wanted something different so thought I would try the Elite Forces DVD. Unfortunately, I was not too impressed. The noise in the background from the planes and helicopters was distracting and I don't feel like the movements went well with the background music. Love the idea but not the workout.",1392336000,,357,4.682539682539683
2725418,5,B000M59WZW,"I have been following Gilad's workout routines for years and have gotten some pretty decent results.  After awhile, though, I get too used to them and my body gets to comfortable with the moves and it's time to up the ante.  That is what Elite Forces does for me. The first time I used it, it was when it initially came out; about 7 years ago.  I was exhausted and put it away, feeling I wasn't ready for it.  I revisited it again recently when I was unable to make it to the gym as we had blizzard conditions.  I put this in the machine and had forgotten how intense it is.  Many have said that the moves are boring. I say they are basic, but effective. I had my Heart Rate Monitor on and saw that I got the same results as if I were in one of my spin classes.  That's a huge plus right there. Was I tired? Sure. I also wanted to stop in the middle of it and give up. I kept on going.  There is plyometrics, lots of jumping jacks, jumping rope, lunges, but you take little breaks and then before you know it, he's got your heart racing again. The perfect HIIT, if you ask me:)  Towards the end, there is a little bit of weight training focused on shoulders and biceps. I was surprised he didn't put in an ab workout--perhaps all the punching/kickboxing moves counted towards that.  If you are looking for a little more in the way of cardio, give this one a try. It's Gilad!!:)  He won't steer you wrong:)",1390694400,,1405,4.14760147601476

2725437,5,B000M59WZW,"Gilad is easy to follow, gives a good warm-up, excellent workout and cardio burning set, followed by a cool down. You do need to be a regular exerciser to keep up with this one; but you can choose what to do or how much to do and work up to it. Excellent DVD. I highly recommend all Gilad puts out for all ages and fitness types.",1309910400,,329,4.0
2725438,4,B000M59WZW,"The only silly thing about this workout is the setting on the deck of an aircraft carrier: it happens to be an actual aircraft carrier, on an actual base, so the producers had to figure out how to incorporate the sounds of jets and choppers into the video. Especially in the beginning, it can be a little distracting.
The workout itself is an aerobic mixture of kick-boxing-type moves and plyometrics. It does not involve any weights, but if you wanted to challenge yourself -- and had perfectly healthy shoulders -- you could box with light weights in your hands. It takes a few workouts to figure out the sequences, and if you've never done anything like that, it can be a little confusing. Stick with it though -- it's a fun workout, and the central (kick-boxing) part can be done on its own if you're pressed for time.",1305763200,,822,4.5608108108108105
2725439,2,B000M59WZW,"I have worked out to Gilad for almost 30 years! I can always count on him to give me a great workout without a lot of dancey moves. This one just seemed a little boring. I couldn't believe how easy it was, and I was actually bored and wishing he would hurry up and change moves. I was also disappointed that there was no ab routine. Gilad does the BEST abs workout and I can't believe he didn't add one. If you're looking for an intermediate or advanced workout, don't bother with this one. Sorry Gilad!

2725441,5,B000M59WZW,I've been doing Gilad Elite Forces for 4 weeks now and I love it.  It's a great cardio workout especially if you like cardio kickboxing or martial art inspired workouts.  It is an Intermediate/Advanced cardio workout so probably not an ideal workout for beginners or for those new to cardio kickboxing (Turbo Jam would be a better choice for beginners).  Gilad's cuing makes it easy to follow.  I actually found it easier to do the moves based on his cues rather than relying on the visuals. I simply listen to his cues while I keep my eyes directed slightly above the TV screen.  It did take me a couple of attempts before I was able to execute the moves smoothly.  I learned to do the workout in sections until I had it all down and only then did I do the complete workout in its entirety. Now I'm at the point where I'm focusing more on form. So don't get discouraged if at first you feel a little clumsy.  Simply break it into sections and don't move on to another section until you've mastered each one first.  Have fun and get fit.,1260921600,,1037,4.364583333333333
2725442,5,B000M59WZW,"I really enjoy Gilad's work-outs! The work-outs on this video are all bewtween 20-25 minutes. On days when I'm pressed for time, I can still squeeze in one of these work-outs rather than skipping exercise entirely & feeling guilty all day. On the days when my schedule is less hectic, I'll do one of Gilad's work-outs then go on to do some strength training with free weights. I would not consider this to be advanced in any way. A beginning exerciser could easily do it. If you've been exercising already like me, then you can just do the moves with more intensity. Some other cardio tapes I've tried were too hard to follow...I want to work my body not my brain when I'm working out. If I have to try too hard to follow them & I'm stumbling through mis-step after mis-step, at the end I don't feel like I got a good work-out. But I don't have that trouble with Gilad. Gilad's cues are good so he's easy to follow & you're always ready for the next move...the first time you do one of his videos, you'll be following along no problem. He's got lots of tapes...get moving & try one!",1252713600,,1082,4.361386138613861
2725443,5,B000M59WZW,"I work out about 30 minutes to an hour every day, and Gilad is my favorite fitness instructor and the hour-long (45 minutes w/o commercials) Total Body Sculpt episodes are a staple for me. I got this DVD because after years of the same workouts, I'm looking for something new to challenge my body and keep things from being so repetitive.

The workout consists of a 9 minute warm-up, a 35 minute cardio segment, and a 9 minute strength training/stretch/cool down segment.  The cardio is mostly kickboxing with some plyometrics thrown in as well.

PROs:
 Overall Gilad delivers in this one. While the majority of the workout consists of pretty basic moves, there were a few moves that were new and interesting to me. The workout itself is challenging and intense. I was dripping sweat and feeling great by the end. There's 35 minutes of straight cardio, which is kind of the opposite of his show which is more sculpting and only intervals of short, but intense cardio.  And it's almost all cardio kickboxing, which is my favorite. I give this DVD 5 stars because it was overall a very good workout and makes for a nice change from his show.

CONs:
While I enjoyed seeing a familiar face (the first thing I noticed was red-headed Arthur in the front row),  there's not as much of the banter and interaction with the other people as there is on his show, so it's less entertaining. My girlfriend and I still can't help but chuckle out loud when we workout to Total Body Sculpt and Gilad picks his team members . Fans of TBS will also notice a lot of familiar moves. The stretches in the warm-up, the cardio moves, and the strength moves are very similar if not exactly the same as moves used in his show. The cardio segment feels almost like they just took 3 or 4 TBS cardio segments and stitched the routines together with a few small twists and additions. If you love TBS and want more, then great. If you're really looking for something altogether new, look elsewhere.

In addition, don't expect much strength/resistance training. You do some bicep curls, some shoulder presses, and a few lunges, but that's it (it's 10 minutes long and that INCLUDES the stretch and cool down). Depending on what you want, this could be a good thing or a bad thing.  Also, if you don't like cardio kickboxing, you'll be disappointed.  Still, it's effective and something a little new and different for me.

THE BIGGEST CON:  THERE IS NO AB WORKOUT AT ALL.
Yup, Gilad completely skips your core. Some will be very happy not to have to do a single crunch or sit-up, but ab work is vital to my workout routine. There's plenty of engaging the abs with the twisting and punching, but it's by no means equivalent to what you'd get from even 5 minutes of focused core work such as at the end of every other Gilad program I've seen. Big minus.

BOTTOM LINE:

I give this 5 stars because I'm more than happy to keep this one in my collection. But, I would strongly recommend first setting your VCR or DVR to record TBS on FitTV for FREE before you go dropping this much money on a single 55minute workout. If you're already a Gilad fan then see if this meets your needs and expectations. If you want more cardio kickboxing, then this is it. If you are looking more for sculpting or strength training, move on. If you want more of the same with some fresh twists, this is just what you need. If you want brand new moves, then you might want to keep looking.",1240358400,12,3431,4.495176848874598
2725444,4,B000M59WZW,"I'm 55 and enjoy working out to this dvd. I feel a little sloppy and uncoordinated for now but I know it takes a little time to learn the routine. Gilad is a good trainer, easy to understand, and explaines each step clearly.",1234137600,,224,4.232558139534884

2725446,4,B000M59WZW,"I LOVE Total Body Sculpt on fittv, and I was hoping this DVD would be just like it.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is very similar.

I would definitely recommend this workout.",1206662400,5,370,4.097222222222222
2725447,3,B000M59WZW,"I own Gilad's quick fit system and I like it. His cardio workouts are pretty effective and always have me work up a sweat. However, I've always thought his sequences are too repetitive and can get boring over time. When I saw this one I thought this might be an improved version of his old workouts, but sadly no. I would say this one is even more repetitive and really borders on being tedious. It's basically the same move over and over again. I think it's important to keep people interested with a variety of moves and this one fails on that aspect. It's still a decent workout but only if you're not opposed to doing the same move repeatedly.",1202688000,6,647,4.4
2725448,5,B000M59WZW,"I absolutely love this dvd; it is very challenging and seriously fun. Gilad builds on the complex moves slowly, adding a piece at a time so that you can keep up with the changes (I especially love how he points his index-finger up--grinning--when he adds the ""uppercut""...I guess he's really really excited about uppercuts!).

The workout is really intense, and I had to pause a lot the first 2 or 3 times I did it, but after a few weeks, I can make it through the whole thing. It's also quite exhilirating/addicting....must be the endorphins rushing around in my head. My only complaint (tiny) is that the cool down should be a bit longer.",1201996800,20,640,4.614035087719298
2725449,4,B000M59WZW,This is a pretty good cardio workout. Not too strenuous.  Low impact (except for the jumping jacks which you can always modify).  It's basically 35 minutes of punching and kicking with some jumping jacks interspersed to keep the heart rate up.  This is a good workout for someone looking for a relatively low impact cardio workout that doesn't involve traditional aerobic or heavily choreographed movements.  I'm thinking that males in particular would favor this workout over other cardio workouts on the market.  You can add some hand weights to increase the cardio intensity.,1201564800,15,578,5.172043010752688

I will also mention that I have decent muscle tone in my legs so I can only blame the sore knees on the workout.
