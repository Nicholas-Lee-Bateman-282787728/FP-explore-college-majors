4401199,5,B004LEOLTM,"Topper, the movie which sparked not only sequels, but also a television series, is a perennial laugh fest.  Cary Grant is at his best, and Constance Benet is outstandingly beautiful and playful.  If ever I get haunted, I hope its by these two.  Basically, a milk-toast bank president named Cosmo Topper (Roland Young), who is secretly dying to break out of his ""lamb on Monday, stew on Tuesday"" lifestyle, is given just that chance when two of his bank's stockholders, who just happen to be THE COUPLE around town, wind up killed in a car crash.  George and Marion Kirby show up from beyond,and believe the only way to get to heaven is to do a good deed (a la poor Topper)- something their actual lives seem to have lacked.  Laugh after laugh ensue as they try to get Topper to break out of his regimental lifestyle, helped along by his social-climbing wife (aghast at anything out of the ordinary or ""proper"") and a dead-pan butler whose underlying humanity slips out of its straight-laced demeanor every so often.  ""What shall I tell Mrs. Topper? he asks as Topper is about to fly the coup.  ""Tell her what ever comes into your fat stupid head,"" Topper replys.  As he drives off, the butler waxes, ""And lo the worm turns...""  Other notable characters include a larger than life house detective at the hotel the Kirbys decide to ramsack, and an inept and hysterically funny bell boy (Dagwood from the Blondie films).  Enjoy the humor and the art deco decor - one of the best from the 30s.",1301875200,5,1489,4.584905660377358

8434263,3,B004LEOLTM,Original Topper is very amusing. The sequel should not have been made.  This would be 5 stars if it wasn't packaged with the sequel.,1417132800,,132,4.5
8434264,5,B004LEOLTM,I watch these Topper movies way too many times because I love all of the Topper series.,1404518400,,87,4.176470588235294
8434265,3,B004LEOLTM,"Topper (1937) has one of the most unusual cars preserved on film.  Obviously poking fun at the famous ""Boattail Auburn Speedster"", the Kerbys' car was actually a 1936 Buick Series 80 Roadmaster with some custom bodywork (info is courtesy of Wikipedia).  Cary Grant, Constance Bennett, and Roland Young launch the ""Topper"" franchise which I think of as a prequel to the 1955 television show also called ""Topper"".
One thing that these two films have in common besides Roland Young is uniquely beautiful leading ladies:  Constance Bennett, who started acting in the '20's reflects the beautiful woman of the that era;  and Carole Landis, the original ""One Million BC"" girl, is a beauty that's almost totally forgotten (I may be her last fan).
Ghosts that can only be seen and heard by Cosmo Topper enjoy putting him in awkward situations and watching him squirm -- especially in the first film.  In the second film, the ghost is primarily concerned with finding her murderer.  Also it was great to see Rochester (Eddie Anderson) who evidently left Jack Benny to drive for Topper for a while.
For the time, these were great comedies with great special effects.",1361923200,,1156,4.93298969072165
8434266,5,B004LEOLTM,"I have several versions of this film and this one is of the best quality so far.

A great movie and a timeless classic starring Cary Grant. I am a huge fan of alot of his work.  Another favorite is His Girl Friday.",1353456000,,214,3.953488372093023
8434267,4,B004LEOLTM,"For those who have been around the block a few times, like myself, the movies were a nostalgic high. Cary Grant not at his best, but still interesting and entertaining.",1347408000,,168,4.633333333333334
8434268,3,B004LEOLTM,"I love the topper films, but if I'm being honest - I was not impressed with this so-called ""Enhanced Double Feature."" There really isn't anything enhanced about the quality of the film. I would wait for a better quality print to become available - save your money on this one.

8434269,2,B004LEOLTM,"If this version of Topper and Topper returns is the best they have to offer it ""Forget about it"". First off the cover says nothing about Topper returns but when you load it in your player it shows that both movies are on the DVD. These transfers are horrible. Its like a very poor VHS print. It would cost almost as much to return it so I'll keep it till a better one comes along. Pass this one up unless your like me, an ardent Cary Grant Fan. The movies are great but this copy is &$*#@*",1342051200,,489,4.051546391752577
8434270,1,B004LEOLTM,"Firstly, I don't usually write REVIEWS unless it's something really great. Secondly, I believe in the maxim ""if you can't say something nice, don't say anything"" -- but this ""2011 REMASTERED"" DVD release of these two cool old films is lousy & below standard.

It is like someone made a copy using the lowest level of analog to digital video capture to begin with, then made a new digital ""copy"" to another digital ""copy"" & then burned all the ""sellable"" copies at the 500x speed.

It is ""bootleg"" quality. [:-(] It stutters with ""pan"" scenes, the sound doesn't synchronize with the visual, the pixels are visable during movement.....you call THIS ""remastering""??

I couldn't get through the first 2 minutes of ""Topper"" before I stopped it -- it's un-watchable, sorry.

Also, although the packaging may use some vintage ""art deco"" graphics, there is NOTHING anywhere on it stating that BOTH ""Topper"" AND ""Topper Returns"" are on the disc.

Now I'll have to gamble on buying the 2009 release -- hopefully IT will be better. [?]",1332460800,13,1024,4.862068965517241
8434271,2,B004LEOLTM,"Both movies are on the one disk, easy to get to each one, but the joy stops there.  I was very disappointed because i bought it on the strength of the 'Remastered 2011' or enhanced inferences in the ad for it.  both movies were not up to the expectations the enhanced addition to the title implied.  They may well have been remastered, but from lousy originals. I have seen plenty of scratchy old westerns, Gene Autry or Hopalong Cassidy, to be specific and the video is superb plus the hoppy flix have a 5.1 audio enhance sound track.
Topper/Return of Topper had none of that. I have Return in a 250 box set from a discounter, mill creek or some such with video and sound equal to this one.  i paid double digits for this duo and about as much as a 50 box set of public domaine offerings.
While these movies are certainly watchable, they did not seem to be precisely what the ad seemed to imply  with the enhanced or remastered addition to the titles.
It is not a rip off or anything like that, just poor quality video that has not gotten the remastered touches that many of the Hopalong Cassidy movies i bought from Amazon. They also sported the Remastered (2004 or 2006) tags and were actually visibly great in comparison to a plain copy of a movie from the 30s complete with scratchy sound and broken film jumps ,etc.
It is worth the relatively inexpensive price only if there are no real upgraded and enhanced or remastered end product. I wouldnt pay more than the $15 or so for these 2 on one dvd.
I  was expecting much better than i got. (as a comparison, 5 completely remastered , 5.1 audio and near perfect video hour long movies for $6 bucks. Hopalong Cassidy)  on amazon...",1324598400,7,1684,4.412903225806452
