8134361,1,B000GT5RSA,"I purchased this DVD in hopes of having a supplement for my discussions about stranger safety and awareness when speaking with my children, but was very disappointed. There was an absurd amount of flatulent type ""humor"" and not enough about the message of stranger safety. I threw this DVD into the trash.",1257811200,,305,4.884615384615385
8134362,5,B000GT5RSA,"I watched this DVD with my kids and they laughed all the way through. Kind of like SpongeBob Squarepants in the forest.

As a parent though, the best part was that Muggsy sparked a conversation between myself and my kids about how to stay safe when dealing witrh strangers. I know they learned some new things and the DVD helped reinforce the things I have been telling them for years!

Great work Muggsy! Thank you.",1153785600,15,416,4.533333333333333
