7920134,5,B00004CZMT,I cannot believe this movie does not have more reviews! This is such a wonderful movie. It is historically correct and respectful to the Apache. This movie is all about the Apache. no white man taking the lead role in this one. There is much truth to this account and is a must for anyone seeking the real story about Geronimo. The actor J. Runningfox is superb! All of the actors were. This is not meant for children.,1422144000,,418,4.371794871794871

7920136,4,B00004CZMT,"Even though this is an older movie and had to get it on VHS I still enjoyed it.
It even had Ryan Black playing the young Geronimo in the first part of it. Lot's of action and a good cast.  I love Michael Greyeyes who played Juh. This guy has sooo much potential as an actor. Have seen him in a few other things. The actor playing Geronimo did a good job too. And Jimmy Herman playing the OLD Geronimo was excellent too. Whether this is ALL historically correct or not I am not sure. It does give a glimpse into the younger years of this period of Geronimo's life.
I think much has been INCORRECTLY printed and filmed about this man. It's definitely worth the viewing if you are a fan of Geronimo or that period in history.",1325203200,4,722,4.194244604316546
7920137,5,B00004CZMT,"I lived for many years in West Texas and New Mexico. As I was interested in the history of the area, I read quite a lot about the Apaches and their leaders. This film is the most true to the known facts of any that I've viewed. Beyond that, it is a very entertaining movie.  It's violent at times, but that's the way life often was back then. It's not all shoot-em-up, though, by any means. ""Geronimo"" presents a very well rounded view of the customs and daily life of the Native Americans in that area of the Southwest. The characters are fully human, not stereotypes. The acting, story, cinematography, and everything else about this film make it one that I highly recommend.",1311292800,3,677,4.504065040650406
7920138,5,B00004CZMT,"This is the story of Geronimo beginning with his younger years. The true story of Geronimo will never be fully told because of the wide variety of myths, army documents, and Apache oral history.  However this film held much accuracy.
It begins with Goyaa in his youth as you meet his mother, sister, and best friend. After a brutal attack by the Mexican army Goyaa changes from a naive hunter into Geronimo; a daring Apache warrior that must fight to save his hunted tribe.
There is much brutality in this movie but I still recommend it to anyone desiring to know more about Geronimo's epic saga. He is hero to some, enemy to many but from all that he has endured one understands why his tactics were so brutal. Other movies tend to focus on Geronimo during his years of war but this movie is more in depth explaining what made Geronimo such a fierce fighter.
The cast, mostly Native Americans, did an excellent job as I found myself crying several times during their heart wrenching tragedy. Unlike Dances with Wolves, the Red Man is the star of this Indian flick. Being a full blood myself I hope to see many more Indian movies with Native Americans leading the cast.",1225152000,15,1169,4.566666666666666
