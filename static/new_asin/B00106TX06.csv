3048087,5,B00106TX06,I gave my brother this for Christmas and he loves it.  When he was little he would eat his breakfast on a stool in the living room with our dog next to him and they would watch these cartoons.,1239321600,5,192,3.923076923076923
3048088,5,B00106TX06,"While modern kids might enjoy this uber-collection, it is primarily the adult cartoon geek that will have a true appreciation of this set.

Essentially, this contains a gaggle of public domain cartoons made over the years. Many of these are of historical interest, particularly to adult amination aficinados. There are some early silent FELIX THE CAT cartoons from the 1920s that are quite bizzare and surreal along with some later color ones from the 1930s such as BOLD KING COLE. Additionally, some early Walt Disney is represented here with some really good ALICE COMEDIES (for the unititiated, this was a 1923-1927 series where Uncle Walt and co. mix a real life little girl in a cartoon world) and two excellent OSWALD THE LUCKY RABBIT (Mickey's predecessor) episodes GREAT GUNS and THE MECHANICAL COW. Both are amusing, but the latter is particularly well done in character comedy for its era.

Amos and Andy fans and early sixties children with revel at CALVIN & THE COLONEL (the 1961-62 'toons featuring the voices of Amos & Andy). This is typical early 60s limited animation mixed with pretty good comedy. The episodes are clearly drawn from actual A&A episodes (the same writers as well as voices were used), but these are mildly entertaining.

HOPPITY HOOPER, a rarely seen 1964 'toon from the folks that brought you Bullwinkle is included, as well as the charming debut of Casper the Friendly Ghost from 1945 (a 'toon of the palsy poltergeist uncharacteristically fighting moon men from 1953 is also intriguing). Popeye fans will be pleased to see the Arabian Nights trilogy from 1936-39, including ALI BABA, SINBAD THE SAILOR, and ALADDIN (with the classic politically incorrect gag ""Salami salami baloney""), albeit not in the best picture quality.

As with any such collection, this one includes some junk. The notorious CLUTCH CARGO ""cartoons"" form the early 1960s are sadly (and stragely) included. Widely considered among the worst American catoons ever made, these monstrosities feature static and poorly-drawn comic strip panels with the only motion being that of human mouths. It is difficult imagining anyone being able to sit through more than a few seconds of this, much less several whole episodes.

Some famous cartoons that are usually included in such sets, such as the 1940s Superman cartoons and PLANE DUMB (1932) featuring Miller and Lyles (the stereotyped black comedy team said to have inspired Amos and Andy) are not in this set, but are available elsewhere.

That aside, there is much more to enjoy. Get it and do so.",1230508800,8,2551,5.04750593824228

Included here are such old favorites as Popeye, Baby Huey, The New 3 Stooges, Casper the Friendly Ghost, Little Audrey, Woody Woodpecker, Felix the Cat, Betty Boop, Mighty Mouse, Little Lulu and many more.

In this new double pack, ""150 Cartoon Classics"" has undergone a redesign. Discs #1 and #2 are no longer stored atop each other, nor are #3 and #4. A center leaf is provided for disc #2 on one side and #3 on the other. The MILL CREEK logo still flashes on-screen midway through each short, however. ""Ultimate 150 Cartoon Festival"" doesn't have these distracting on-screen watermarks, and the main menu system is simplified and thus improved. Downside here: cartoons are grouped by studio and subdivided into main characters, so there's less of a variety feel. Also discs #1 and #2 are stagger-stacked when stored. (Note that Ub Iwerks' ""Dick Whittington's Cat"" has been misfiled on disc #3 as part of the Famous Studios collection.)

A highlight of the ""Ultimate"" half of this set is two silent Oswald Rabbit cartoons animated by Walt Disney. It's easy to see from these 1920s animations how Mortimer (later ""Mickey"") Mouse evolved. The rarest here may be ""A Christmas Tree,"" which was produced in Soviet-era Russia. Of especial note on ""Classics"" are several British-made Hoffnung shorts. Their drolll humor and impossible situations are set to strains of familiar classical music.

Studios represented: AUDIO PRODUCTIONS, BREWSTER, CAMBRIA, CELEBRITY, CORNELL, FAMOUS, FLEISCHER, HALAS & BATCHELOR, HANDY, JEFFERSON, LANTZ, NEW WORLD, PIED PIPER, POWERS, SOFAC, SULLIVAN, TERRYTOON, VAN BEUREN and WINKLER

Stock material varies from very good quality to barely fair. There's no evidence here of digital enhancement. Some shorts were dubbed from 16mm b&w prints once sold for home use, even though the originals were in color. One example is ""Jingles"" (it's actually ""Mendelssohn's Spring Song"" -- ""Jingles"" being the series name). Although b&w here, the original is in ""Brewster Color.""  Audio is generally clear.

I'm truly happy with how this DVD collection kept my 4 year old busy for at least 4-5 hours! It's been a couple of weeks/months and he still wants to watch. It was received sooner than thought, properly packaged, and service was perfect. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone.

Most colour cartoons are of very low quality. It looks like it was made of old 16mm Prints.
In such prints colour detiriorates and all blue is replaced by green.
The Black and white films looks O.K.
In general- poor purchase.
