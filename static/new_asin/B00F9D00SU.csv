5971521,4,B00F9D00SU,"The Die Hard movies are a lot of fun.  The first film is a classic; the others vary in quality but can at least be admired for impressive stunt work.

For anyone who doesn't own these movies on blu-Ray, this is a great way to get them all.  Please note that this is not a box set, but rather a bundle of individual titles... Each Blu-Ray comes in its own case (a DVD copy is also included for each movie, plus a digital copy of ""A Good Day to Die Hard"").

The only thing you are missing out on is a bonus disc called ""Decoding Die Hard"", which contains special features.  That disc is only available in the Die Hard 25th Anniversary Collectors set:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Die-Hard-25th-Anniversary-Collection-Die-Hard-Die-Hard-2-Die-Harder-Die-Hard-with-a-Vengeance-Live-Free-or-Die-Hard-Decoding-Die-Hard-Blu-ray/dp/B00ANGID14/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Die Hard: 25th Anniversary Collection (Die Hard / Die Hard 2: Die Harder / Die Hard with a Vengeance / Live Free or Die Hard / Decoding Die Hard) [Blu-ray</a>]

The other two I haven't watched yet.  The video quality really depends on the player your using and the screen as well so I will just say it looks great where I am once I got proper software installed in my computer.  This isn't a collection as well, its what you see here, 5 separate cases with no collection box that have been put together into a Bundle.",1438128000,,532,4.076923076923077

5971549,5,B00F9D00SU,"This is the Blu-ray Die Hard Collection. I mean, what more can I say. For starters, the HD in the original movies was better than expected. The old movies clean up nicely. Also, the progression of the series is interesting. In the first one, the action takes place all in the same building, in the second one, he gets to venture off in the neighborhood, but not far. By the third one, he's all over New York City, and in the fourth one, he gets to travel across the United States. Since, in the fifth one he trots across the globe, one can only assume that in the sixth Die Hard, John McClane will travel into space and save the galaxy. I can't wait!",1408924800,7,650,4.25

I was not a fan of the last Die Hard and the one before was OK also.  Of course, the first one was great, the second one dipped off a bit but was still good and the third one entertaining too.

5971571,4,B00F9D00SU,I loved Die Hard 1-4 which i had previously seen before purchasing this package. A good day to die hard is the worst movie i have seen in awhile. No one should ever buy this movie. I almost threw it in the trash because I didn't want it my house.,1389052800,,246,3.94
5971572,5,B00F9D00SU,Bought these for my husband's Christmas list even though I'm a fan of the movies too.  We hadn't seen one of the movies and didn't even know it existed so we were both excited about that.  What can I say?  The movies rock!,1388966400,,222,4.116279069767442

5971581,3,B00F9D00SU,"The disks are not held very securely in the carriers. I received a box from Amazon containing the Die Hard collection and the Planet of the Apes collection. Some of the die hard disks were rattling inside the boxes. Thanks to Amazon's GREAT return policy I was able to send them back for a replacement. The second set came without a problem. So, kudos to Amazon for their return policy.
The quality of the recordings is great, they look wonderful. But, and I don't understand this at all, every time you pause it long enough for the Blu-Ray player to shut down, or just turn it off, you can't start the movies at the point that you shut down. You have to endure all the lead-in garbage, then search for the scene you were on. The person at the store where I purchased the player said that some Blu-Rays do not have the info on them to restart at the point of stopping, so apparently they left that little bit of info off these. I have used some Blu-Ray recording that do re-start where you left off, so I know that it works. Quite often we take breaks mid-movie, either to do something or go to bed so this is an important option for me.",1385164800,2,1137,4.293023255813954
5971582,4,B00F9D00SU,"I had the previous collection without the latest movie. It was jacketed as a set- this is not. Now i want to rate 3 stars for this but there is no evidence that it should come with a jacket, but since that assumption is on me, ill just dock it one star. These are full size blu-ray jackets so they take up more space but as typical with these size of cases- they hold the disk better. A no frills set otherwise, good value.",1384992000,,423,4.0476190476190474

5971584,5,B00F9D00SU,"Starting out as the everyman hero, John McClane works his way through the movies, and years, into a hero of myth, completing in-human tasks and adventures, becoming an almost invincible tough-guy, who can take on nearly anything which comes his way.  While some may see this transformation as off-putting, it's done in a fun way, which never really takes itself too seriously, making you want to enjoy these movies again and again.  The original Die Hard(1988) is probably still once of the best action movies from this time-frame/genre, and holds up tremendously well to this day.",1384819200,,581,5.041666666666667

5971600,5,B00F9D00SU,"My rating says it all. We Die Hard fans love the series and Willis. Like many people, I have waited for a complete set with both versions (theatrical and unrated) of ""Live Free or Die Hard"" and the latest ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" film. The extended cut on this one is a bonus. Also like many people, I found the various sets' reviews all clumped under each set and never knowing exactly what each set contained or did not contain, confusing. I hope this gives our loyal Die Hard fans a good idea of exactly what you get in this latest set of the Die Hard series and I hope it does not get clumped together with all the reviews in all the other sets.

All movies in this set have 1 High Def Blu-Ray disc and 1 Standard Def DVD *however* there is still no Blu-Ray re-master of the Unrated ""Live Free or Die Hard"" DH4. The Unrated version  is only on the Standard Def DVD included here with the Blu-Ray disc. [The picture here does not show it but the actual disc cover I received says on the bottom ""DVD includes both the theatrical and unrated version of the film.""]

I think this is as good as it will get. When I saw all films on Blu-Ray in one ""Daily Deals"" set, I jumped for it. This is a lot of films for only $34.

Picture and Sound
All Blu-Ray discs are what you expect from Blu-Ray in both crystal-clear picture and HD Master Audio 7.1 as well as both Spanish and French Surround Dolby. All Blu-Rays have D-BOX Motion Codes for those of you who have the moving chair in your home [DH5 does not specifically say that on the back cover but it was released to D-BOX theaters so I am thinking it is there but I have no way to tell. If someone has a D-BOX setup at home, please comment and I will edit this. I will also be right over!]. The DVDs have THX, English Dolby, DTS 5.1 and English and French Surround Digital.

8613385,5,B00F9D00SU,"I want to make this simple, Die Hard 1 is a masterpiece, Die Hard 2 is a good sequel to 1, Die Hard With a Vengeance is ok, Live Free or Die Hard was ok but I like Die Hard With A Vengeance more than this and A Good Day To Die Hard was not bad but not as good as Live Free or Die Hard in opinion. The whole set is a great Christmas set for those for are Die Hard fans.",1449532800,2,368,3.4457831325301207
8613386,4,B00F9D00SU,"I'm writing about ""Die Hard: The Complete Collection (Die Hard / Die Hard 2 / Die Hard with a Vengeance / Live Free or Die Hard / A Good Day to Die Hard) [Blu-ray] ""  I know this review may show up on some other similar Die Hard releases though.

These are just all 5 movies, in their individual Blu-ray boxes, shrink wrapped together.  There aren't any bonus discs or a box to hold them all together.

I think like most of these franchises, the first was the best and the follow-ons just get a little worse each time.  I like the movies, but there is a definite progression downwards in story and quality in my opinion.

I'm not going to review each movie here, many others have done that over the years so if you want the plot and synopsis check out other reviews or IMDB.  I just wanted to clarfiy what you got for your money here.",1446508800,,834,4.2075471698113205
