2043227,5,B0001YJA2O,"A great set of fun yoga dvd's to learn the basics, sexy yoga basics that is  without getting hurt or mixed up with spiritual mumbo jumbo.  There's a beginner DVD that I do with my mom, its only about 25 minutes but hits everywhere in your pelvic core and is great to do just before going to meet my boy friend.  They mixed in a bunch of dance moves with the yoga and its true, I feel sexier after doing these DVD's.  Recently I tried the advanced version and wow, I'm sore, but in all the right places!  If you're looking for super slick production these dvd's might not be for you.  But there is lots of instruction, with text on the screen that if you're confused about a pose gives more info.  The instructor is also very personable.  Feels like you're in the room with her, which is nice.  A fun addition to any fitness collection I even got my gym rat boyfriend to do it with me!  Check out the book that goes with it.",1201996800,7,923,4.163841807909605
2043228,1,B0001YJA2O,"I bought this months ago and just decided to write a review when this dvd came up next to another I was looking at. This is a bad set of yoga dvds. The word ""sex"" draws you into buy it. This is only my oppinion but in yoga, I don't like the music they chose. It is sort of anxiety type music and yoga should have either no music or if there is, it should be more of a meditative type of music. The teacher is not the Spiritual type either. I wasted my money on these dvds.",1201737600,5,472,3.826530612244898
2043229,2,B0001YJA2O,I have seen this dvd series in the past and my bookclub finally offered it. It sounded interesting and many magazines have written about yoga and sex and metioned this series. So I thought I would buy it and try it out. I am sending it back. Someone metioned the poor sound quality and they are totally right. I too had to take time out of the poses and look at the screen. I think it was the worst part of the first dvd. I haven't watched the other two. They should have voiced over the instructions because the room she was in made it echo and you couldn't hear her very well and then from time to time they would play horrible music. Also there were times when I don't beleive she was even taking this workout seriously and would start to laugh. If she was trying to make the workout seem more fun and playful that way it didn't work. I am only giving this dvd 2 stars for the fact that the moves were good and it was a shorter workout that most yoga routines I have tried.,1199836800,3,976,4.115183246073299
2043230,1,B0001YJA2O,"For as much money as I paid, I thought this would be a great series. However the production quality of these DVDs is worse than most home movies. The feedback is so distracting, I couldn't sit through any of them! And I thought that this would be approached somewhat professionally, but these videos are just kind of tacky and have a porn-like vibe that doesn't even come across as sensual...just tacky. I half expected Ron Jeremy to be in one of the videos! Yikes.",1179964800,5,465,4.5476190476190474
2043231,1,B0001YJA2O,"There was nothing sexy about these DVD's.  I have worked as a yoga teacher for may years and there was nothing other than a low budget production.  The postures were not particularly suited to develop intimacy, release kundalini energy or promote increased sexual experience anymore than any public yoga class.  Save your money and go take a yoga class with your partner instead.",1178841600,9,379,4.984126984126984

2043233,3,B0001YJA2O,"I bought this DVD because my gym was cancelling it's yoga classes and I wanted something to do at home.  In my class we focused on breathing and controlling our movement with our breathing.  This DVD more goes through yoga sequences, but doesn't focus on the internal focus of yoga.  I feel she goes through the movements too quickly to use my breathing correctly.  The sequences are good, although she doesn't go through any modifications of some of the poses (ie doing crocodile on your knees if your triceps aren't strong enough to do it, doing cobra instead of upward dog).  The music is kind of reminicent of a cheesey porno flick, thankfully it's not too loud.  When the instructor goes into forward bend poses it becomes difficult to hear her voice, which could have been fixed with some sound editing.  They do camera shots that focus on close-ups of her ""sexual core"", her pelvis mostly, but once you get to know the moves and you don't have to look, it's not so bad.  Mostly a good routine with poor direction and sound editing.",1155168000,7,1038,4.603260869565218
2043234,2,B0001YJA2O,"If you're really interested in improving your sex life through yoga...

...I would avoid this video. I'm sorry, I'm sure the instructor who made this series is a terrific person, but this completely misses as a yoga video. This video is really soft-porn. If you want soft-porn, then buy this video or any other soft-porn that suits your fancy, but if you're interested in how yoga and the ancient Hindu teachings can help you improve your sex life, there are far better sources available. Tantric, Kundalini, and Kama Sutra teachings all offer far superior information about sexuality. Truthfully, any vigorous yoga practice will help you develop the necessary physical core power for a spectacular sex life. And, if you really want to take it to a different level, then explore tantric teachings and you will discover the beauty of your own sexuality.",1137110400,27,852,5.0
2043235,5,B0001YJA2O,"Better Sex Through Yoga #1, Beginners - Body Awareness Through Yoga

Throughout this workout, Jacquie teaches sensual and graceful yoga moves beyond upward or downward dog. Horizon, plank and warrior pose will all be familiar.

Occasionally, you will hear a woman's voice giving you instructions like: ""Feel your sexual core contract and release."" You will also learn some essential: Breathing techniques, Pelvic Stretches, Inner-core strengtheners and Body-enhancement positions.

What did I notice after exercising? A new level of energy, a tingling sensation all over my body and improved confidence. Poses: Warm Up, Standing Poses, Sexy Yoga Dance, Floor Work, Abs and Sexual Core and Final Relaxation.

Better Sex Through Yoga #2 Intermediate - Makes You Feel Sexy

Jacquie Noelle has two partners in this workout who are equally fit and flexible. You start with basic neck stretches and make your way to forward stretches and then shoulder rolls, down dog, creative hip stretches, an amazingly creative upside down stretch, warrior, triangle pose, fun-sexy-hip swirls, isolated hip rolls, primitive dance-style forward rolls, challenging balancing poses, deep leg stretches, back exercises, table, sexy side stretches, creative stomach exercises, Pilates exercises, sitting forward bends, challenging knee stretches, a creative series of pelvic exercises and a final relaxation segment that you will really deserve!

After this workout I noticed a higher level of body awareness.

Better Sex Through Yoga #3, Advanced - The Ultimate Yoga Aphrodisiac

After trying all three Better Sex Through Yoga DVDs, I must say these workouts will not only improve your physical form, they actually work on a much deeper level to provide enhanced sensation and awareness, not to mention an increase in sexual energy and desire.

The second time I tried this workout I noticed all sorts of new sensations in my body and soon after this workout I discovered that ""yes"" these exercises do work and there is something magical about the entire Better Sex Through Yoga series.

For starters, this workout will heat up your whole body as you move to sexy music and also try a few sexy hip movements and rather challenging balancing poses. Not only does this workout promote confidence, the exercises target hard to reach inner-core pelvic muscles.

I loved the deep forward bends and the especially sexy mini-dance segments. While you will find many familiar yoga poses in this workout, the way in which they flow together is quite beautiful and inspiring.

Jacquie really adds creative flair to many of the poses. The Sun Salutation series teaches you to breathe and flow from pose to pose. I found that the plank to lower plank and back up to upward facing dog and then downward facing dog really helped to strengthen my upper body. The entire Sun Salutation section makes you feel invigorated and quite alive.

Jacquie Noelle is a true inspiration and when you see how fit and flexible she is, you will understand why you will want to keep doing these workouts and attain her level of fitness. Jacquie has a cute, sexy instruction style and gives these workouts pure personality appeal. I love the way she quickly fixes her hair after some poses and giggles now and then. Well, it looks like she finally does workout in a tiny outfit. Actually, the less you wear, the more you will enjoy this workout. You really do get quite the workout.

Additional Benefits of this Series:

-Tightens the stomach in amazing ways
-Lifts the Butt in a sexy way
-Improved confidence and posture
-Smaller clothes! Shopping becomes much more fun and you feel so sexy in anything you buy. I dropped two sizes so far and am wildly happy about that aspect alone.
-Weight Loss by the pound. Between Yoga and Walking, you will see the pounds dropping faster.

Special Features on each DVD: Introduction, Trailer, Out-takes and Bloopers, The Yoga Goddess Jacquie Noelle Bio, Additional Instruction on all DVDs: Jacquie Introduction, Yoga Poses and Words of Wisdom.

The bare wood floor and sheer drapes covering the window are the basics of the set. Then, you have some mats, plants and lots of candles. You sort of feel that you are in a dance studio and so there is a realistic feel to the entire workout and you feel like you are part of a yoga class. The music for these workouts is very sexy and encourages you to keep moving. An extended relaxation section on each DVD makes this workout a satisfying experience.

""The Better Sex Through Yoga Series"" is an exciting set of three workouts designed to increase your body awareness all while seducing you into a new level of sexual fitness. There are a lot of yoga workouts out there, but nothing will make you feel as sexy as the ""Better Sex Through Yoga"" series.

2043236,1,B0001YJA2O,"This is an awesome idea for yoga, but you can NOT hear the insturctor! It is a really poor quality soundtrack on this set of dvd's!!!!",1116892800,18,134,4.1923076923076925
2043237,2,B0001YJA2O,"I brought this video because of the good reviews it received. I would not reccommand this video to anyone. The picture quality isn'tvery good. It looks like a homemade video. The music is very annoying. Along with the music you hear (breath through you sexual core, Etc..) The sound is not good. It sounds kind of hollow. Like there's a slight echo. I really don't have anything good to say about this dvd. I can't tell you about Volume II or III because I was very disappointed in I. The only reason I gave this dvd 2 stars is because the moves are so bad.",1109635200,26,557,4.314285714285714
2043238,2,B0001YJA2O,"Although the poses were OK - the same as what you would get on any other normal video - the sound was absolutely horrible. You can tell this is a low budget tape. No special attention was placed on the audio. All you hear is an annoying echo. When the instructor is giving direction, she's usually in the pose, so she's talking into the mat, which rendors the audio even worse. There are additional directions given, however, they are written on the screen. If you're in a pose, being able to view the screen in order to read isn't going to happen to easily. I've seen better ....MUCH better.",1105747200,,592,4.440366972477064
2043239,5,B0001YJA2O,"I bought this for me and my girlfirend to do together over Thanksgiving. I figured, its starting to get cold, and I knew after the holidays we needed a good reason to workout. Well, this was a good reason, and ended up being a great workout. I was skeptical as I'm kinda a macho guy who usually lifts weights, and nothing more. I wanted to try yoga for a long time, but always thought of it as kind of something for sissy's. Not so much anymore though. Doing this video is a total turn on. Not just doing it, but also watching someone do it. When my girl bends over and wiggles her hips, its hot. Plus the music is cool, not the usual spiritual stuff. The instructor is really easy to follow, and very likeable, as she keeps things light and fun.

I definitely feel differences in my flexibility, and my girlfriend seems much stronger..""down there"" if you know what I mean. We both love feeling the results after, and it keeps getting better. Great reason to try yoga if you've never done too. Great holiday gift, and New Years Eve resolution.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!",1101945600,12,1063,4.446153846153846
2043240,1,B0001YJA2O,"I don't usually write reviews, but I feel so strongly that this one is awful, that I feel obligated to warn future buyers to keep your credit card in your purse when it comes to this one! I am an avid yoga/fitness DVD athlete -- have been doing yoga for over a decade, have run two marathons: I know my stuff.
You could make a case for the yoga routine being a good one, but I find that the production is so awful that I can't hear the instructors voice, so I constantly have to bend out of positions just to look at the TV screen to see what she's talking about. Not to mention the camera shots of her tush and close ups of her inner thighs are just disgusting. She's very fit and toned, but I just don't want to see anyone up that close.

If you want a yoga routine that makes you think you might be learning from a strip-dancer, go ahead and spend the 50+ bucks on this one.",1101686400,51,877,4.040229885057471
2043241,5,B0001YJA2O,"I'm back on this page because this is the third time I've bought the DVD's and am back buying them for my friend who just had a baby.  After reading some of the reviews below I figured I'd chime in.  Yes, so obviously they shot them in a small dance studio somewhere, not a TV set or beach.  Fact of the matter is the routines are awesome and not devoid of personality like some other squeaky clean made for the day time TV crowd videos.  Not to mention they are real workouts.  For a full work out I do the advanced dvd, my boyfriend sweats like a dog - but I'll tell you this is the only yoga video he agrees to do with me and things have only gotten better in the sack since.  Even the beginner video which I bought for my mom, you break a sweat yet beginners can do all the yoga and feel the benefits fast.  Now mom is doing the intermediate video and dad seems happy!  Go figure.  I love these videos!",1091232000,14,906,4.044943820224719
2043242,1,B0001YJA2O,"This is a cheezy production. Looks like someone's home video with a stage set up in their living room. BTW -- Better Sex through Yoga could be a title for any Yoga practice. Yoga will help you in many ways ;o)

 The best bet going if you're looking for a good all around yoga practice in Hemalaya Behl's ""Yoga for Urban Living.""

2043243,4,B0001YJA2O,"This is one of the better yoga workouts, but the production is so bad that I couldn't give it 5 stars.  The voice overs are cheezy.  (""Feel your (...) core."")  The music sounds like a (...) soundtrack.  The setting seems to be in someone's apartment.  The street traffic can be heard.  Also, I could barely hear the instructor.  I had to watch it a few times and take notes just to follow the routine.

(which i actually don't mind)  it is a great stretch that really makes you aware of your whole body.  especially your sexual core.  my bf makes fun of how often she says ""breathe into your sexual core.""  but... its a reminder.  i love it.  always makes me feel great after.  i find myself reaching for these videos over my tens of other yoga videos.",1339632000,,601,4.324324324324325

8018295,2,B0001YJA2O,"I was very disappointed in the video.  The filming quality was poor, the set was unimpressive, the instructor did not seem entirely comfortable in front of the camara.  There was little if any introduction--nothing was explained, movements were in quick succession and repetitive.  The video seems liked something that could be put together at home.  I also had thought that the video would involve partner yoga, but it wasn't, and didn't seem to have much to do with better sex, except for her mentioning the sexual core a lot.  I think a regular yoga class could do about as good on this topic.",1281139200,2,596,4.747572815533981

The lighting and sound values are very amateurish, in some spots it is hard to hear and see what the instructor is doing.",1243641600,7,441,4.301204819277109
8018297,5,B0001YJA2O,"I always thought that yoga is for people who can sit a lot in strange poses and think that this might be good for their health. - A belief kind of a thing.
But the idea of better sex made me try it.
The thing with the better sex I haven't found yet (other than that the lady in the video is my kind of a girl), but: IT IS A GREAT WORKOUT. It works for my lazy lower back, makes me feel relaxed and happy and is the perfect cure for my too-much-sitting-stiffness.
So, maybe the thing with the sex will come with time.
But already now I am happy with what it does for me.
Thank you Jacquie Noelle Greaux.
Much happiness for You and Your way of doing things.",1242604800,2,655,3.9696969696969697
