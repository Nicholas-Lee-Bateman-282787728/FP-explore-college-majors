8331836,1,B001P1WM0Y,"A.D. was a TV series scripted by Anthony Burgess and first broadcast in 1985 in 12 hour-long episodes. The story was told on parallel tracks: the shenanigans of the Imperial court in Rome, with all the debauchery and intrigue of Tiberius, Caligula, Nero, etc; and the development of the early Christian movement in Judea, with all the infighting and arguments over circumcision, etc. (Burgess also wrote a companion novel, THE KINGDOM OF THE WICKED.) A.D. wasn't a great series (certainly not in a league with I, CLAUDIUS), but it was interesting and featured a lively cast. This DVD version has been gutted of all the ""naughty bits"" (i.e., the Roman emperors), leaving only the Early Church material, so as to make the story suitable for Sunday school viewing. Of course, removing the historical context and contrasts totally subverts the original intent (and also eliminates the star turns of Anthony Andrews as Nero, etc.). Poor Anthony Burgess must be turning over in his grave...but respect for creative artists (or discerning audiences) is the last thing the purveyors of this bowdlerized version have in mind. I suppose, once we have President-for-life Sarah Palin, this sort of ""cleaning up"" will be done to lots of books and movies, for our own good and that of the children. Won't that be nice?",1284595200,5,1304,4.986238532110092
8331837,5,B001P1WM0Y,"If you're like me, you're always spoiling for something more from the Bible to watch. Well this is one. Like so many it doesn't stick too closely to the Bible. But it is fundamentally in accord with scripture. And it is great watching. Actually the inaccuracies are good in a way, I find myself comparing what I see to what I've read and thus strengthening my knowledge of the scriptures themselves. It's a good long movie with plenty of viewing for one long or two shorter evenings of viewing. Personally I like one good long run, but I've noticed that others get antsy and have to move on. Short attention span.",1278892800,2,613,4.531531531531532
