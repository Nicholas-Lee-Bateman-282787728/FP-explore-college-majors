7826377,1,6302424216,The sound was defective. There was static that made it virtually impossible to hear the dialogue. I dumped it in the trash as it wasn't worth the time and cost to send it back.,1476662400,,176,4.205882352941177

7826379,5,6302424216,"I sincerely believe that all of these VHS tapes
concerning Star Trek (especially the 25th
anniversary) should be transferred to DVD.
A box set of all of them would be greatly
appreciated. I would certainly pay a premium
for such a collection!  thank you.",1375142400,,254,4.7727272727272725
7826380,4,6302424216,"The Star Trek 25th Anniversary Special(1991) aired on TV in 1991. Part of it was hype for Star Trek VI The Undiscovered Country(1991). I swear the TV version was longer. There were outtakes from ST: TNG. Paramount released this special on VHS and Laserdisc, but they never bothered with a DVD or Blu Ray release. This special is fun to watch, but it's dated. Hosts William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy are younger. TV shows such as Star Trek Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise debuted years later. This was before Star Trek Generations, First Contact, Insurrection and Nemesis were made. This was before J.J. Abrams' 2009 reboot of Star Trek. This TV special takes us back to the 1960's when Star Trek debuted on NBC. However, they ignore Star Trek The Animated Series(1973-1974) and skip to Star Trek The Motion Picture(1979). They also ignore the fact that Star Trek V The Final Frontier(1989) was a critical and commercial failure. This special also covers the Star Trek The Next Generation era from 1987-1991. This special has some priceless interviews with the late Gene Roddenberry and the late DeForest Kelley. There was a Universal Theme Park attraction where guests could participate in a ""Star Trek movie""! This Star Trek TV special is retro fun and any Star Trek fan should see it.",1368748800,3,1294,4.886363636363637
7826381,5,6302424216,"A quarter of a century of trekking to where no one has gone before Gene Roddenberry. What a vicarious thrill ride to distant planets and aliens cultures. This retrospective reawakens the wonder we all felt when we first discovered the Star Trek franchise, and shows so clearly why Star Trek has had such a long life, how creativity and
courage made it so prosperous!",1296864000,,366,4.734375
7826382,5,6302424216,"I have been a HUGE Star Trek fan since 2002 and I decided that I had to have this. Star Trek: 25th Anniversary Special is incredible. This documentary is hosted by Shatner and Nimoy and they take us through the history of Trek. We also get to see TOS bloopers and  the current space program and how progression has been in reality, hosted by LeVar Burton.

Another great thing that is shown is a few Trek parodies from other TV series; SNL, In Living Color and the Wonder Years. All of the skits are funny, my personal favorite was the Wonder Years Trek scene. The cast from both the Next Generation and the Original series are interviewed, a few behind-the-scenes people are interviewed as well. Some of the people interviewed

George Takei

Walter Koenig

Nichelle Nichols

Whoopi Goldberg

Patrick Stewart

DeForest Kelly

Rick Berman

and many more including Gene Roddenberry

A behind-the-scenes look at Star Trek IV and VI are shown. Many interesting facts are learned in this entire special. There is so much talked about and said in this special, it's a cannot miss for any Star Trek fan. I bought my copy from here at Amazon and it was in good condition and was totally worth buying, especially at such a low price. It is definitely worth a lot more that what it is being offered. Buy it, you will absolutely love it.",1139356800,,1326,4.6
7826383,5,6302424216,"This VHS tape is Excellent!! A TV Special to commemerate the 30th Anniversary of Star Trek. Hosted by William Shatner and Leonard Nemoy. It traces the series from the early days progressing to the Next Generation (Which was airing at the time the special was made) Great behind the scenes action and stories, interviews with the creator Gene Roddenberry and Bloopers!! If you are a Star Trek fan this is a collectors dream. The only negatives are; It does not come in a DVD format and Since it was a promotional VHS tape an annoying message pops up on the bottom of the screen every ten minutes or so telling you it is for promotion only. Still a great addition to anyones collection.",1128124800,,684,4.569105691056911
