8587308,4,B00CXN3VYY,"Dr. Suzune is a specialist in parasites. Climate change and genetic manipulation has caused new mutant parasites to emerge as a new threat to Japan. From parody to mild psych-horror to martial arts action and finally to monster bashing, this film tries out many things and mostly succeeds. The mild sophomoric situations come about because someone has tampered with an anti-aging pill. It appears that when someone is infected with parasite x they lose all inhibitions towards the opposite sex. Dr. Suzune dresses like she just came from a cosplay (see cover) but she does have a frog sensor strapped to her side. Yes, a FROG! Evidently the frog knows when an infected host is nearby. Some parts may make viewers go eewww  or laugh depending on one's point of view (the method of extraction good case in point). The good doctors father has a hand in all this as he was trying to develop a way for people to be happy, with bioengineering. Not A-list material by any means but for viewers of Japanese SF/ soft films with plot a good enough movie. However the film does end abruptly with no resolution other than an advert that the story continues in Suzane:Evolution.",1391990400,14,1165,4.738916256157635
8587309,4,B00CXN3VYY,This movie is as eerie as it is fast paced and interesting. I highly recommend this to any fan of this genre....,1376870400,3,112,4.136363636363637
