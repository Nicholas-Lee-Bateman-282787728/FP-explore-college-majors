545647,4,6303046452,The movie its self was good. Silly special effects though. Obviously based on Admiral Byrd's expedition to the South Pole,945993600,,121,5.1
545648,3,6303046452,The monsters are clumsily done but the picture in general is well done and the scenes impresive for such an old picture.,938908800,,120,4.5

It begins with a view of Washington DC. A military officer talks of the investigation of the Antarctic. There may be valuable minerals there. A woman reporter arrives, she will be part of the expedition. The ship arrives in icy waters, the Ross ice pack. A helicopter flies away in 40 below weather. This area was once tropical in temperature. Bad weather forces a return through fog. Something happens, the helicopter loses altitude! It gets warmer outside. Can they repair the damage? No, the magnesium alloy rod breaks. They send a maidez call. They hear a scream. There is no climactic change, its like the Mesozoic Age. Can they be rescued by the Navy? If they drop a replacement part the helicopter can be repaired and fly away. They need fresh water. Then a huge lizard appears! The people run to the helicopter for refuge.

An unknown man grabs Maggie and carries her away in a boat. He speaks to her and says he is the lone survivor of an earlier expedition. He is the fittest to survive because of his intelligence. Dr. Hunter meets the others and offers them a deal. Will the lizards attack? Can a Colt .45 drive the huge lizard away? Maggie rows a boat on the water. Will she be threatened by a sea monster? (Does it look like the Loch Ness monster?) Can Dr. Hunter drive it away and rescue Maggie? Will one of the military try to rescue Maggie? Will they learn about the escape route? The men find wreckage and a replacement part. Can they take off before that huge monster lizard approaches? Can they rescue Maggie? What will happen to Dr. Hunter? It takes a good guy with a flare gun to stop that bad monster lizard. The helicopter flies back and lands on the ship; all are rescued. They plan to return next year. What will change?

This would have been a better movie with a better story to compensate for its low budget. Conan Doyles story of The Lost World must have inspired this story. This originally appeared with the title The Land Unknown.",1479600000,,1995,4.520775623268698
7836009,4,6303046452,"This is one of those rare monster movies where no one gets eaten.  Drat.  Especially as they had more than enough irritating characters to improve somethings diet.
The story involves a naval expedition to Antarctic.  A small crew, saddled with a woman reporter, takes off in a helicopter and soon runs afoul of an inconvenient storm that almost grounds them permanently............in a jungle.......in Antarctic.  Hey, it could happen!  After running into a pterodactyl, they are stuck, the helicopter beyond repair...........unless someone just happens to have a spare part.  While stranded, they dodge a tyrannosaurus (a guy in a really bad rubber suit), a couple of giant monitor lizards bent on killing each other, a man-eating plant that settles for a nocturnal tree-dwelling potto hors doeuvre instead, and a swell looking elasmosaurus.  I loved it when the elasmosaurus plays peek-a-boo with a couple hiding in a cave.  This movie is just daffy enough to prove entertaining, if you like this sort of thing.  Its a plot thats been done before, and better, but not as cheap as this version proves to be.  I love the 50s sensibilities when it comes to these old Sci-Fi flicks.  Speaking of which, this movie can be had in the DVD box-set The Classic SCI-FI Ultimate Collection volumes 1 & 2 (one of ten films).",1362441600,,1314,4.954337899543379
7836010,5,6303046452,"I know that the young people of this generation will turn up their noses at movies like this. As a child of the 50s,we view movies like this as PURE unpretencious FUN!I'm going to crank up my VCR,get a big bowl of popcorn & ENJOY this movie. This is a rarely seen ""gem"" for fans of 50s movies. Even when it's shown on TV,it's chopped all to pieces by commericals. Like I said before,ENJOY!",1350259200,,389,4.27027027027027
7836011,3,6303046452,"It's a good movie. They go to the south pole. But there is a
warm spot there due to hot springs or something. Anyway the
area is prehistoric with dinosaurs. There is also a man living
there who was left stranded there from an expedition years before.

Never mind that the dinosaurs look so fake. The seriousness of
the acting makes you hardly even notice. It's interesting, with
action and good dialog. It may be in black and white. But it's good.",1252713600,,447,4.451219512195122
7836012,3,6303046452,"This is one of those movies that appeals to old sci-fi B movie lovers. The effects are weak but, are very familiar of the time and genre. The dinosaurs effects run from OK to pretty silly, they use a variety of techniques from real lizards shot with miniatures, a man in a T-Rex suit and a sea serpent that looked like a puppet of some sort. The acting is typical also. If you are like me and can't resist these old B Sci-Fi flicks than you will be pleased to know this is available on Ultimate Sci-Fi classic collection volume 2. The DVD transfer is very good and there are a total of 5 films in the set.",1193875200,,605,4.135593220338983
7836013,5,6303046452,"Okay, I agree some of the monsters in this movie are rather weak, but all in all, because of the likable cast, this is a perfect Drive-in Black and White film. I am sure kids of today raised with all colour films and with the high quality computer generated effects, will sniff their noses at this film, but to the baby-boomers that loved Drive-In B movies, this is one of the better ones.
Jock Mahoney (TV's Yancy Derringer and later a Tarazon for movies) stars with the gorgeous William Reynolds (TV's FBI and also from The Thing that Would Not Die another perfect B movie) in this tale of a polar expedition that crashes over the South Pole due to crashing into a Pterodactyl. There is a hot pocket where all sorts of prehistoric (make it in this case prehysteric!!) monsters still exist. Three men and a woman crash and await rescue, but due to one of the running the battery down they cannot get word where they are hidden in the tropics jungle at the centre of the Pole. They discover there was another party, with one man still surviving, and since there is only one female, tempers flare up naturally.
I am a sucker for the old Black & White B horror, Sci-fi and mysteries.  It's not the quality of the monsters...its the experience.  So pop some popcorn, turn out the lights and enjoy a kinder gentler Jurassic Park....",1048377600,,1328,4.5062240663900415
7836014,4,6303046452,"Today's kids, raised on computer-generated graphics, will probably sneer at it, but by 1957 standards THE LAND UNKNOWN was pretty hard to beat.  Drawing inspiration from 1920s silent classic THE LOST WORLD and using film shot by Byrd during his polar expedition, THE LAND UNKNOWN presents the story of a helicopter forced down at a warm-water oasis in Antartica--where the crew discovers a prehistoric world where everything seems determined to gobble them up.
The special effects are a mixed bag, ranging from live-action shots of lizards-in-combat to Godzilla-style rubber suits to full size mechanics.  While I wouldn't describe it as greatly sophistocated or even consistently executed, it is all a tremendous amount of fun.  The script is more intelligent than you might expect--and the story takes an unexpected turn that tempers the action-heavy plot with a certain depth.  The cast is no-name, but every one plays expertly, and THE LAND UNKNOWN moves at a cracking pace.  This will never compete with the likes of Harryhausen's stop-motion classics, nor will it go down in the history of film as an equal to the truly great science-fiction and fantasy films of its day.  But THE LAND UNKNOWN is a fun flick, and I recommend it to fans of 1950s creature features.",1020988800,,1270,5.052631578947368
7836015,4,6303046452,"This flick had well above average production values for the 1950's.  The actual sets were spectacular(for this timeframe) and it had great use of stock footage.  Sure, the dinosaurs were cheesy, but name one 50's monster that wasn't. I purchased this before seeing it and am glad to say that it will remain in my library. Most films I purchase before seeing end up on Ebay.  Check it out!!",979430400,,389,4.608695652173913
