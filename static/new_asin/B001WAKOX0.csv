3826132,3,B001WAKOX0,"First of all, I absolutely love Tyler Perry movies just like I love all the stage plays. With that said, Madea goes to jail was a good movie, but it wasn't anything compared to ""The Family That Preys"", ""Madea's Family Reunion"", or ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman"". I must say that I was pleasantly surprised to see Keshia Knight Pulliam out of her element. This was the first time that I could actually see past the fact that she was a ""Cosby kid"" and actually see her as a legitimate actress. Derek Luke was very good in his role as always. Madea was really funny and over the top as well, but I can't seem to get pass the fact that it seems like we've seen this all before. To it's credit, it does tell a deeper story than Madea going to jail for stealing gas like the stage play. Plus, it has a group of fresh actors in the cast like RonReaco Lee from ""Sister Sister"". It also tells you a story about a young prostitute with a past who is reunited with an old friend who desperately wants to help her break her cycle of abusing herself as well as her body. All in all, I think it was a good mix of drama and laughter. Madea gave you a chance to laugh and Candace gave you a feeling of sorrow and sympathy. If you don't take this movie too seriously you'll like it.",1237334400,2,1263,4.117408906882591
3826133,5,B001WAKOX0,"Most of Tyler Perry's movies have left me wanting... wanting a better script, better dialogue and better acting.  Many of his previous movies are exaggerated and stereo-typical, but Madea Goes To Jail is different.  The acting is so much better than in many of his previous films (who knew the former Cosby kid had so much talent???) and the Madea character is funnier than ever.  This is by far, the best movie Tyler Perry has ever done -- he's getting better and learning his craft as a producer and director and casting better actors in his films.  I found myself crying over funny parts of the movie and over sad parts.

A great family or date movie!",1236297600,6,654,4.555555555555555

3826153,5,B001WAKOX0,One of the best Tyler Perry movies of all times. The message is deep and pulls at the viewer heart but Madea brings the comical relief. I shine a light on a topic that mean try to pretend doesn't exist.,1520899200,,202,4.075
3826157,2,B001WAKOX0,I watched this movie to laugh plain and simple and the only part that literally made me laugh is when Madea goes to court at the beginning of the movie 'hala-loo-YER' (LOL). That part had me busting up! I replayed that part about five times when she's talking to the judge and she starts talking about the Lord & JeeeeZUSSS! That part was tooo funny!! But that was it for me. I've seen other Madea movies better than this.,1520208000,,422,4.3544303797468356

3826161,1,B001WAKOX0,"I couldn't have been more bored.  I was waiting for something funny to happen - something touching - something that made sense - ANYTHING to redeem how dry and predictable this movie is.  For those of you who have ever gone to Boston Market - everything you get from there has the same taste and after-taste.  Just like Tyler Perry movies.....If you have seen one, all of his others are the same formula.  I was hoping for something entertaining, but now I'm sleepy and ready for bed.  This movie was great for boring me to sleep.",1519084800,,530,4.479166666666667

3826164,3,B001WAKOX0,"In classic Madea style, there are a handful of funny moments that made me laugh out loud. I also liked what they went for with the side (non-Madea) plot in it's redemptive nature. However; I didn't like its ending and I think it took too much screen time away from the funny section where Madea was actually in jail. I had a good time with this film overall and it was worth a watch on Prime, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it or watch it again.",1518220800,,451,4.255813953488372

3826183,1,B001WAKOX0,"My in laws are not from the United States. They wanted to watch a movie and saw Madea Goes to Jail, and thought, ""This looks like it could be a fun movie."" I told them it was not, I begged them not to watch it. Perhaps because Tyler Perry is a black director/actor/writer my in laws assumed this comedy simply wasn't for me, I, as a white male, am not the target audience, but they being of foreign background, thought this movie could, in fact, be for them... They were wrong.

We watched 15 minutes of this movie. My father in law speaks English as if he were born and raised here, so the language barrier was non-existent. It wasn't the fact we didn't understand the jokes that made them not funny, it was the fact there was no actual humor to be found in the jokes or situations that made them not funny.

This movie is unwatchable. I hate it. I hate everything about it. It is insulting to every demographic. If you're black, white, Hispanic, man, woman, transgender, or non-binary, this movie is a slap in your face. A better use of your time would be to cut off your hand and watch it cook in the microwave for 15 minutes; that would be less painful as well.

I'm writing this review in the hopes that giving a low score will remove it, and any other related movies (by Tyler Perry) from my Amazon recommended watch list.

I hate myself for not throwing my Playstation 4 in the bathtub the moment my in laws thought watching this movie was a good choice. That's a mistake I have to live with.",1514937600,,1499,4.304964539007092
3826184,3,B001WAKOX0,"It was a decent movie, but it lacked the comedy we've come to know and love from Tyler Perry/ Madea. Also, I would have loved to see more of the jail stuff, but there was very little to begin with and most of the movie was about Candice and her friend. I'd watch it again, but only if I was bored.",1514678400,,297,3.8852459016393444
3826185,5,B001WAKOX0,I loved everything from start to finish. My favorite part was when Madeangets even with the woman who steals her parking space. My least favorite part was the one violent scene in the movie. My sides hurts I laughed so hard! Love Tyler Perry!,1514419200,,242,4.5227272727272725

3826192,1,B001WAKOX0,This movie was terrible. The plot made zero to no sense. The story had close to nothing to do with Madea. She's in prison for less than ten minutes. Overall a 0/10.,1512950400,,164,4.15625

We need to wake up and see through clear eyes instead of how follywood has slowly steered us into partaking in their evil ways.  Madea is a man in woman's clothing, is a liar, deceiver, immoral, user, untrustworthy, disrespectful, unaccountable, irresponsible, rejects God and what He stands for, is a god unto himself, and all under the guise of 'entertainment'.  When we stop making excuses to partake in evil we'll start being true to ourselves and 'we'll' stop being liars, deceivers, and thieves.

You still have your acting skills girl. I hope to see you appear in more movies.  As for MADEA - refreshing in a prison jumpsuit.  Your prison Latina friend Sophia was hilarious. We need more Hispanics and Latinas in film. Thank you Perry for looking outside the box for talent and including a fine Latina like Sophia Vergara.

But, if you're looking for something to simply entertain you and make you laugh, this will do it.  However, some people don't like this style of humor. There is some swearing, so you may not want your young children to see it.

While the visual content may be PG unfortunately; the SUBJECT matter of prostitution is given so much emphasis that it detracts from the focus of comedic entertainment and becomes uncomfortable for even a 13 y/o that we actually didn't finish the movie.  Disappointed in this movie, have greatly enjoyed others though.  Will probably watch other TP movies, just be cautioned on this one.",1429488000,,500,5.225

3826603,5,B001WAKOX0,"This is my favorite Madea movie, and now it's on blu ray. It arouses such a wide range of emotions as the storyline bounces back and forth between humor, reality, hard luck and human behavior. It's about the human condition, food triumphing over evil, loyalty, forgiveness, finding your way back home, and justice. The message is typical Tyler Perry: justice prevails and good triumps over evil, all with a large dose of humor. The actors are great and the script successful. Yes it can get a little corny and sappy at times, and sometimes it moves a little slow, but the message is real. No spoilers here. You've got to watch it to see the multiple plot lines.

""Brownies for my brownie,"" says T. T. , a female serial killer, to Madea. One of my many, many favorite lines. This movie is a classic.",1421798400,,798,4.541666666666667

3826769,4,B001WAKOX0,"Tyler has one thing that is likeable by anyone and everyone, he is continually giving advice to young kids, to adults and the general public. He injects religious believes that affect those who are watching any of Tyler's movies. It's great the way he depicts the life that is typical of African Americans. He has done a great job. He surrounds himself with singers that you don't find easily. Great singers. Tyler and all his crew, CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!",1400371200,3,453,4.896103896103896

3826774,1,B001WAKOX0,Disappointed in the quality of stream on this rental. I tried to rewind back to a missed scene and the service went haywire on me. Frustrating movie night and the movie takes a hit over it.,1398556800,,189,4.277777777777778
3826775,3,B001WAKOX0,But sometimes I just don't. There's only so much Madea a person can take but it's hard to deny that this is has become a cultural thing now.,1398470400,,140,4.035714285714286
3826776,5,B001WAKOX0,I watched this because I was looking for the scene in jail where Madea helped a woman help her own child behavior when she met the woman in prison but this movie did not show that scene. I would appreciate any helpful-posts. I am not sure if there is a difference in the movie and play. Thank you for Diana,1398211200,,306,4.116666666666666

3826778,4,B001WAKOX0,"This is one of a series of Tyler Perry Madea movies.  I think we've seen all of them.  Tyler Perry is such a versatile actor, you have to pay attention to the different characters to figure out if it's him in heavy make-up or another supporting actor.  His movies provide old fashioned slap stick comedy that you can't help but laugh at his character acting.  Very funny movie!",1397865600,,377,4.5
3826779,5,B001WAKOX0,"If you're a fan of the Madea movies, you'll love this one!  I love living vicariously through Madea.  I mean, there's been times when we've been upset over something someone's done...and we may or may not have thought to act out like Madea...but we don't and she most certainly DOES!  ;)",1397779200,,287,4.588235294117647
3826780,5,B001WAKOX0,"It  seems that any thing from Tyler Perry is worth the money and time to get it and see it.  I love his moral messages.  He writes about real life which I love the best.  Loved watching the movie, and I plan to watch it again!  Thanks for great service!",1397692800,,253,3.98
3826781,5,B001WAKOX0,I love all of Tyler Perrys movies in which he plays Madea.  Madea is the funniest of all the charecter he plays,1397692800,,111,4.045454545454546
3826782,2,B001WAKOX0,"While it was an okay movie, we were expecting the same laugh after laugh as in Madea's Witness Protection. It was definitely not as funny, and even a bit sad at times.",1397606400,,167,4.25
3826783,3,B001WAKOX0,"This was an okay Madea film. As always there is a good moral to the story, but Madea's Witness protection is hilarious! I like it a lot better than this film.",1397088000,,158,4.129032258064516

3826785,4,B001WAKOX0,"First, I gave this 4 stars because it was funny but not quite as funny as the other Madea's films. I enjoyed it but was a bit disappointing. The only funny part for me was Madea was trying to find a parking spot. Really the movie was more about the girl that was in the street. Rather than Madea.",1396569600,,296,4.033898305084746
3826786,4,B001WAKOX0,"Another funny situation for Tyler Perry's character Madea is side busting funny. However, I don't think Jail situations are worth experiencing.",1395360000,,143,5.857142857142857
3826787,4,B001WAKOX0,"What else can you say? I love Madea films and plays. I love her character and sometimes lack of character. She is funny, strong and seems an unlikely source of so much wisdom and comfort for those around her. Madea gets herself thrown in jail, much to her surprise and she manages to share enough of her wisdom and comfort to help those around her get a hold of themselves and turn their lives around. Touching story in many ways.",1395360000,3,430,4.3875
3826788,4,B001WAKOX0,I ordered this dvd for my mom. She loves these moves and plays. The dvd was fine. the seller was fast. I would recommend if this is the kinda thing you find funny. it's good clean comedy for what it is. No complaints overall.,1395273600,,225,4.136363636363637
3826789,4,B001WAKOX0,Enjoyed this movie and the story line and plot was very good. I thought the romance of the couple was over-simplified somewhat at the end - but it had a very good theme and idea.,1395100800,,178,4.114285714285714
3826790,4,B001WAKOX0,It was nice to watch with the rest of the family and it was very educative as always  with Madea,1394668800,,96,3.8
3826791,4,B001WAKOX0,The story drifted to much away from Madea but none the less had a good plot. I enjoyed a fraction of the movie,1394150400,,110,3.8260869565217392
3826792,5,B001WAKOX0,"Ive always like watching any of Tyler Perry's movies, and the ones with Madea are always the best. Humor with a strong story to follow makes for a great combination.",1393286400,,165,4.533333333333333

We only made it through about 20 minutes or so & had to turn the movie off. It's like a weird ""B"" movie. We had company in town & all had the same consensus. Totally disappointed that we actually PAID to rent this movie, but ended up not being able to bare watching it.",1391990400,,373,4.123287671232877
3826804,5,B001WAKOX0,"The play and movie are different people, but they are both are really good.  I liked it a lot. If you are wondering which one to watch I would say both if you are a Tyler Perry fan.  They are very different movies but they both seem to focus on the one theme ""Madea goes to jail, which if you are familiar with Madea is saying enough.  :)",1391817600,,338,3.9411764705882355

3826816,1,B001WAKOX0,We watched Madea Witness protection movie and loved it so we immediatly ordered Madea Goes  to Jail.  Big mistake as it was not a comedy and no one in the house watched it all the way through. It was our fault for assuming it would be similar to the other movie. I even fast forwarded to see if it got better.  Not a fun entertaining movie at all. violent and crude,1388793600,,365,4.112676056338028

Way to go Tyler Perry and his ""Madea"" character, not to mention that he plays two other parts in the movie also!!!!!!!!!!",1388016000,,383,4.260273972602739

3826838,5,B001WAKOX0,"Tyler Perry's tried and true formula always works for me. After watching several of his films you'll see a similar format in his production, however there's always a good moral to all his stories. His character of Madea is funny and reminiscent of several people I know all roled into one! She brings great comic relief to the otherwise seriousness of the plot- a prostitute  is sent to prison.",1382400000,,394,4.7101449275362315

3826860,5,B001WAKOX0,Tyler Perry is underrated by the mainstream. This is one of his best. And you will be surprised to see Sofia Vergara as the cellmate of Madea! Sofia gives the funniest performance you've ever seen from her. She is brilliant. Really good stuff.,1376524800,,243,4.674418604651163

This one, however, was plain silly, but I was also offended by your repeated need to make fun of God.

3826883,5,B001WAKOX0,"""Tyler Perry's Madea Goes To Jail"" is great! This is how the story goes: After a high-speed freeway chase puts Madea in front of the judge, her reprieve is short-lived as anger management issues get the best of her and land her in jail. A gleeful Joe couldn't be happier at Madea's misfortune. But Madea's eccentric family members the Browns rally behind her, lending their special ""country"" brand of support. Meanwhile, Assistant District Attorney Joshua Hardaway is on the fast track to career success. But Hardaway lands a case too personal to handle - defending young prostitute and former drug addict Candace Washington - and asks his fiancee and fellow ADA Linda Holmes to fill in on his behalf. When Candace ends up in jail, Madea befriends the young woman, protecting her in a ""motherly"" way as only Madea can.

The cast led by Tyler Perry (back in his roles as Madea / Brian / Joe), Derek Luke (as Joshua Hardaway), & Keshia Knight Pulliam (as Candace Washington) is great! The directing and story and screenplay by Perry (who also produced) (who also produced and directed and wrote the stories and screenplays to ""Madea's Family Reunion"" (2006, also starred as Madea / Brian / Joe), ""Daddy's Little Girls"" (2007), ""Why Did I Get Married?"" (2007, also starred as Terry), ""Meet The Browns"" (2008, also starred as Madea / Joe) & ""The Family That Preys"" (2008, also starred as Ben), he also wrote and produced ""Diary Of A Mad Black Woman"" (2005, also starred as Madea / Brian / Joe) is great!

The music by Aaron Zigman (who also did the music to Perry's ""Why Did I Get Married?"", ""Meet The Browns"", & ""The Family That Preys"" is great! The cinematography by Alexander Gruszynski (who also did the cinematography to ""This Christmas"" (2007) is great! The film editing by Maysie Hoy (who has been doing the casting to Perry's films since ""Daddy's Little Girls"") is great! The production design by Ina Mayhew (who has been doing the production design on Perry's films since ""Diary Of A Mad Black Woman"") is great! The casting by Kim Hardin (who also did the casting to ""This Christmas"") is great! The art direction by Mark Erbaugh (who also did the art direction to ""The Family That Preys"") is great! The costume design by Keith G. Lewis (who has been doing the costume design to Perry's films since ""Diary Of A Mad Black Woman"") is great!

This is an great comedy that is funny and heartwarming at times. This is another hit from Tyler Perry. Madea's back and funnier than ever.",1369526400,7,2482,4.7011494252873565

3827002,2,B001WAKOX0,"Tyler Perry's storytelling skills are about as rudimentary as they come.  His modus operandi is generally to gather together a group of two-dimensional characters and broad comic stereotypes to act out a simplistic morality tale - then throw in some  lowbrow buffoonery and high-minded sanctimony for good measure.  In Perry's world, good and evil are real, palpable entities and just about everyone we meet is either a hero or a villain.  ""Tyler Perry's Madea Goes to Jail"" is no exception to that rule.

And don't let the title mislead you, for the sassy, take-no-prisoners Madea (played by Tyler Perry in drag) is little more than a glorified second banana in a movie that is all over the map when it comes to plotline, character development and tone.  In fact, thanks to its gear-grinding tonal shifts, the film feels more like a series of comic sketches interrupted periodically by bits of social drama - or maybe it's the other way around - than like a fully developed and integrated work in its own right (the scenes in prison are particularly egregious).

The ""comic"" storyline centers around Madea's apprehension for speeding and resisting arrest (a scene that actually took place in Perry's earlier film, ""Meet the Browns""), though the jail time she faces is actually for a subsequent offense.  The ""serious"" plot thread involves Derek Luke and Ion Overman as two impossibly attractive attorneys who are engaged to be married and who keep bickering over just how concerned Joshua (Luke) should be about the people he's left behind in the ""ghetto.""  Joshua wants to lend a helping hand to a female pal from college who's become a drug addict and a hooker (Keshia Knight Pulliam, an all-grown-up Rudy from ""The Cosby Show""), while the unscrupulous Linda - a spoiled little ""princess"" who's always had daddy's money to make things easy for her - thinks Joshua should just do his job and let the young woman die on the streets or rot in prison for the rest of her life.  Needless to say, neither plot strand offers much in the way of plausibility or credibility, and the movie isn`t always even true to its own moral code.  For example, just after the imprisoned Madea has delivered an impassioned speech about how people ought to take responsibility for their actions and accept the consequences for their wrongdoing, she dances out of prison on a technicality.

The actors do what they can with scene after preposterous scene, but you'd have to be a thespian on the order of a Laurence Olivier to triumph over a script as hopelessly messed-up as this one is.",1261094400,2,2566,4.833333333333333

3827015,5,B001WAKOX0,"The beginning of this movie is very funny.  The rest is very disturbing.  To see little Rudy play a grown whore was disturbing in and of itself.  As you learn her story it gets even more disturbing.  I almost turned it off during the scene where she is being roughed up and raped by her friend's pimp.  I almost couldn't take it.  It was too real.  After I found out that the reason she was a hooker was that she was gang raped in college I almost ripped the disc out of the player and destroyed it.  Not since Malcom X have I had such an emotional response to a movie.  Spike Lee did too much in that movie and Tyler did too much in this one.  I don't think I'll be coming back to watch this movie again any time soon.  The emotions that it raises are just too painful.  It's a great movie but if you have any emotional issues this movie should only be watched with a lot of friends around to help you out.  Watching it alone could lead to a nervous breakdown.  Tyler Perry is a great story teller and a very great movie maker.  Buy this DVD.  It's not for the weak at heart, though.",1253923200,,1084,4.0663507109004735

This movie however strayed too far away from that premise. The sub-plot and plot were not cohesive. It was almost like watching two different movies.

I would have enjoyed it more if Keisha's character had some interaction with Madea prior to going to jail. Especially since they did not go to jail until 3/4 into the movie. Prior to that, there was no connection between those people and what was going on with Madea. It was just random.",1253059200,,570,4.578431372549019

Save your time and enjoy the trailer, because it contains ALL the funny parts of this movie.  I surly would not label this movie a comedy.  There are too many storylines going along at once and none of them converge to make a solid movie.  I really like Tyler Perry and his concept of Madea, but this movie so under uses her that she could have been a supporting role instead of the lead.  Honestly, the best part of this film is during the final credit roll up with an out take scene with Medea and Dr. Phil.",1249084800,2,600,4.085470085470085
3827032,2,B001WAKOX0,"I know there are those who won't agree, but I didn't enjoy this movie as much as I have some of the other Perry movies. First, ""Madea goes to Jail"" was typical Tyler Perry, there was nothing new or exciting. The cookie cutter formula of ""man does woman wrong, woman struggles, Madea acts a fool but has a good heart, and everything works out after a great deal of struggle, with a lot of laughs and some serious moments"" is still the recipe of this Perry movie. However, there were also some lose ends that seemed to hang out there left unanswered.

Madea is once again facing jail time for actions that she takes when a woman steals her parking space. Willing to do things that the average person is afraid to do, she takes things into her own hands and issues her own brand of justice. Facing a less lenient Judge (Judge Mathis), Madea is sentenced to some prison time. Meanwhile, an over zealous prosecutor, fueled by jealousy, insures a stiff sentence for her fianc&eacute;e's friend, Candace (played by Cosby show's Keshia Knight Pulliam) by committing prosecutorial misconduct. Surrounded by several interesting characters, both Madea and Candace (rape victim turned prostitute) do what they have to do in order to survive prison.

Although there were some funny situations and lines in this latest Perry production (the Uncle is still a hoot), I don't think it offered anything new or original. Perry's formula of victimization, laughs and someone done someone wrong worked to a point, but would have been better if some of the storylines had been followed through.  I thought Madea would pass along some of her wisdom or influence Candace more than she did. Instead, Candace and Madea seem to just be in the same institution with no real interaction. In other Perry movies,  Madea was instrumental in helping the main character recognize her victimization as well as provide support for her to do something about it. In this movie, Madea was just in the prison and providing some comic relief but in my opinion not really influencing Candace. Then again, maybe I have come to expect a lot in Perry movies and was just disappointed. Was it the worse movie to watch on a Sunday evening, no...would I have paid to see it in the theater, no.",1248739200,,2245,4.748717948717949

3827037,5,B001WAKOX0,"MADEA GOES TO JAIL

I am a Tyler Perry fan and was completely excited when I found out that this film was going to be his next, based on the great play I knew it would be a great film. So it came to theaters and like I thought it was a hit so I knew the DVD would be excellent. Finally when it came out it was bought for my girl for her birthday and we all had a great time watching it. Perry is excellent at delivering heartfelt films with a bit of comedy thrown into the mix. Like before he succeeds here once again and delivers another marvelous film. Perry once again provides a well crafted drama/comedy that will have you hooked for sure.

There are two different stories going on in this film like most Perry films, this like the others blends both stories very well and even brings them together. One follows Madea and her legal battles as she escapes prisons grasp only to fall prey to it later. This is the comedic side of the film as you know and really makes this movie funny. Then we have Joshua Hardaway an Assistant District Attorney who just landed a case that puts him back in touch with a former childhood friend who he elects to help. Since he didn't help at one time when she really needed it in their college days he feels the need now.  Of course this does not sit well with his fianc who has a bit of a secret her self. Of course this is the more dramatic side of things and it is classic Tyler Perry, excellent story with these ones.

Perry has always been an excellent writer and this shows exactly why he keeps churning out hit after hit. The script is full of great believable characters and full of emotion which only brings you into it. Of course his direction is great and keeps the movie moving along at a nice pace. Perry himself is great in three different roles and yes they are the same three he plays in all the Madea movies. Of course the lead character Madea is excellent and one of the most fun characters in film history and Perry as usual is brilliant in the role. Then there is Madea's brother Joe is funny as always especially during the party scene. And then there is Perry with out a get playing Brian who is the family's lawyer, and a member himself.

Derek Luke is great as Joshua and brings a real feel of emotion to the character and is very believable in the role. Keshia Knight Pulliam is absolutely brilliant as lost cause Candace who feels betrayed by Joshua over an incident [a really bad one] in college that led her to a life on the streets and prostitution. She may very well steal the show as far as the dramatic performances. Ion Overman is great as Joshua's girl who does not understand his feelings about his former childhood friend. David and Tamela Mann as always are great as the Browns and bring a lot to the comedic side of this film. Every one in this film did a great job and really bring it on this film. But if there is any one who is also up for show stealer it is Sofa Vergara as T.T. who Perry fans may recognize from the ""Meet The Browns"" film. Her character is the craziest/funniest serial killer of all time, I loved it.

This is one of the better releases thus far and is very much worth your money, this is a great movie. Tyler Perry is a great filmmaker and an even better writer so you should check this out. This is a great film that we all truly liked here at the house so I assure you that you will to. Go out and buy this now or at the very least rent it tonight because you will like it.

3827043,5,B001WAKOX0,"Madea Goes to Jail made about $90M in the theater, and was the primary contributor the highest grossing February in HISTORY.  Pretty impressive.  Unfortunately, I didn't have the time to see the movie, so I waited for the Blu-ray... bad move.  Obviously, as there's no Blu-ray.

According to ""Industry Insiders"" at Blu-ray.com, Lionsate didn't make a Blu-ray because the ""Urban Demographic"" doesn't buy BDs.  Basically, they're saying black people don't own Blu-ray players, so there's no reason to make discs.

Of course, Eddie Murphy's ""Meet Dave,"" last summer's biggest flop got a Blu-ray.  And you can bet his ""Imagine That,"" which hasn't even made $10M in its whole run, and cost at least one executive his job, WILL be getting a BD.

I'm no fool, and I understand demographics drive marketing decisions.  But at the very least, it feels very disconcerting to be potentially associated with a group of people who aren't considered worth making BDs for.  At least by ONE company anyway.  And I guess I'm just not convinced of their reasoning since they don't cite any sources.  And this was a massively successful movie, so there is a market.

3827053,1,B001WAKOX0,"I found this movie to be a sad insight into Tyler Perry's world view. The movie claims to be about not being a victim - but that is exactly what I think Tyler Perry's message in this movie is. I think this movie sends the wrong message about all people getting along - no matter what color God made them! The 'pimp' is either a white or very light colored Hispanic male and says to the black prositute that he wants her to be his 'slave'. The white lady that parks in the spot Madea wants at the Super K Mart refers to Madea as 'Jememia'. The white 'Christian' businessman (with his wedding ring on and photos of his children behind him) that the black female pastor enlists to help get prostitues off the streets and into jobs is shown to be a criminal that only gives the girls jobs if they sleep with him. In the prision, the blond haired-blue eyed Scandanavian looking inmate is an aggresive-violent homosexual - especially toward the young black prostitute. Madea's white cellmate - also a Hispanic (assume by her accent, but they never specify) is a serial killer that acts like a crazy goodie two shoes. To top all that off - the two lighter skin toned black characters, especially the prosecuter/fiancee of the main male character are shown as the ones with no morals and willing to do wrong.

Since Tyler Perry wrote this entire movie - it is evident to me that he wants to portray whites/Hispanics/and-or lighter skinned blacks as bad people with racist tendencies, in my opinion. For example - the fiance mentioned above - she calls the prostitute 'them people' 'from the other side of the tracks'. Tyler Perry is willing to show a lighter skinned accomplished black woman as the main villian by only being able to get ahead by padding her cases and wrongly sending people to jail - either at all - or for longer periods of time than is allowed. The prostitue frequently tells her long time love that this woman is 'not his type' and is a 'princess' (ie - strong implication that she is not truly a black person). I feel this should be insulting to any woman - black or white - or any color - that happens to value her education and wants to get ahead - especially any black woman (or man) that would be considered a 'traitor' for pursuing a good education, career, and life - that is considered to be a 'white' attribute.

Of course, wrong is done by the female prosecutor - but the way it's portrayed and the way most of the white people are portrayed in this movie (aside from all the swearing and negative religious content) as sick, violent, or just plain racist - shows me that Tyler Perry wants to continue the division of victimhood, instead of bringing all of God's people together - as he could have done with this movie - but chose not to! God gave him an opportunity, a voice, and a platform to further this worthy goal and it saddens me he didn't take it.",1245542400,6,2879,4.450757575757576
3827054,3,B001WAKOX0,"this movie was okay,but the play version of this movie was way better. My compliant is that why does tyler perry have to make his movies so negative and filled with sterytypes. Why does the black girl have to be the one who is a prostitite?Why cant he make a movie about a black girl who got a degree and went to college. Just almost all of his movies show black women getting sexuialy abused or mistreated by their husband,like diary of a mad black women for example,the main character in the movie whose name is helen is kicked out of the house,and her husband leaves her for a prettier white women,or in madeas family reunion the main character was abused as a child,her ,or in why did i get married her husband calls her fat and doesnt even like her. Those are sterytypes just because these people are black doesnt mean they are just horrible people. And then he calls these movies christian with all the cursing and madea talking about she was a stripper,how is that so christian?The only fun part of seing this movie is listening to madeas jokes other than that this movie is just cheap entertainment.",1245456000,,1107,4.512437810945274

3827057,2,B001WAKOX0,"Sigh.  Let me start by saying I like Tyler Perry. I like what he's trying to do.  I just wish he would take more time to do it.  His characters are so underdeveloped.  I was impressed with ""A Family that Preys"". I was convinced he was growing, then he whips this out and dang it Tyler!  I love Madea.  How can you not?  But when you've seen the plays and the movies it gets really redundant.

The man is talented...I just wish he would take more time to develop that talent.  Quality not quantity. He's spreading himself thin.

As for the Actors... Derek Luke was great for what he was working with. Ronreaco was funny. The girlfriend was blaze. Typical one-dimensional character. (SPOILER) Of course she ended up being a crook in the end. We had to hate her. Madea and Joe were Madea and Joe, same as always.

I loved the preacher/social worker.  I felt that actress; her pain and her past.  She was real to me.  Great job. I even liked the prostitute friend.  Now Ms. Pulliam was a different story.

I'm no critic but my biggest complaint was I knew it was Rudy. Rudy trying to forget her spellman education and trying to act like she belonged in a world she knew nothing about.  It was overdone.  I wasn't enthralled by her story...(Spoiler)I just wanted to know where Stanley was during this rape?  Why she didn't tell Dr. Huxtable so she could get some help?

Okay I'm being snotty but I don't want to see Keisha Knight Pulliam. I want to see the character. I never see Angela Bassett. I see Anna mae Bullock, Dr. Betty Shabazz, Katherine Jackson, Mace, Stella whoever she is in that moment. I don't even know the name of Keisha's character it was that unforgettable.  I don't know anyone's name besides Madea and Joe.

Tyler is trying to give ""his audience"" what they want. But plot and character development is a heavy price to pay for occasional laughs and heartwarming melodrama.",1244851200,5,1888,4.507374631268436

A gleeful Joe couldn't be happier at Madea's misfortune. But Madea's eccentric family members the Browns rally behind her, lending their special ""country"" brand of support. Meanwhile, Assistant District Attorney Joshua Hardaway is on the fast track to career success. But Hardaway lands a case too personal to handle - defending young prostitute and former drug addict Candace Washington and asks his fiancace and fellow ADA Linda Holmes to fill in on his behalf. When Candace ends up in jail, Madea befriends the young woman, protecting her in a ""motherly"" way as only Madea can. I have all of Tyler Perry's movies, and I think this movies is very entertaining.  No one does it better but Tyler Perry.",1244678400,3,866,4.851351351351352
3827059,5,B001WAKOX0,"This is a great movie.  It is, by far, my favorite Tyler Perry movie to date.  It's laugh out loud funny and the actors are fantastic.  I've seen all of Tyler Perry's plays and movies.  He's exceptionally talented and I love all of his work but I'm a bigger fan of his movies rather than his plays. I believe that's where the division of the reviews will lie.  If you're a bigger fan of his plays, you may not agree with my review.",1244419200,10,431,4.144578313253012
3827060,5,B001WAKOX0,"Even though I have not seen this movie (I am waiting for the DVD to purchase), I believe that the movie was as entertaining, and funny with the positive messages that Mr. Tyler Perry always creates and presents in his plays, and now movies. I have the Plays and they are so funny and with down to earth messages. I just viewed again my DVD of Madea Goes To Jail -The Play, a few nights ago; it was so very entertaining, as always. I can't wait until the DVD of the Movie comes out June 16, 2009 - according to Amazon advertising. I enjoy the acting of all of these wonderful Actors that Mr. Perry has so wisely employed into his company. Mr. Perry, being a great comedic actor himself, plays so well with David And Tamela Mann, Cassie Davis, LaVan Davis - just to name a few. In my opinion, Mr. Tyler Perry is a comedic genius as well as a strong, down to earth, intelligent, compassionate black man.  We are so proud of you, Mr. Perry and all that you and your company have accomplished. Hoping & Praying for your continued success. May God Bless All of You!
From your fans,
The Williams' and friends",1243555200,6,1101,4.318840579710145
3827061,3,B001WAKOX0,"Tyler Perry's latest installment theatrical movie Madea Goes To Jail was pretty much okay. The acting was pretty much straight forward, especially Mr. Perry playing an old female convict, Madea. I don't get to watch his movies very often (the last I saw was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Why-Did-I-Get-Married-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B001132GO8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Why Did I Get Married? (Widescreen Edition)</a>, so I really don't know the full background behind all of his movies nor screen plays.

Pros: All acting was great. The movie casting was great. Especially Derek Luke's character, playing the good guy here in this movie. Mr. Perry playing Madea (as well as a lawyer). Some of it is funny how you find an elderly woman acting like a 20 year old, making sarcastic jokes throughout the movie.

Cons: I asked the title in my review because I was under the impression that this was a comedy, but it would jump back and forth between comedy and drama. Madea is the star of this movie, but the majority focus was on Keyshia Knight Pulliam's character ""Candy"" and her life as a prostitute, and Derek Luke's character trying his hardest to help her out, which is were the drama comes in. I really hate that when there is more than one plot going on in a movie and they're unrelated to each other. At times its like watching two separate movies here. Also I thought that this movie was very predictable with cameos. Example: Former TV Divorce Court Judge Mablean Ephriam Esq plays a judge on here. When they said a new judge was taking over Madea's case, I saw Judge Mathis making an appearance from a mile away.

Overall this movie was okay, but not great. I guess this is more geared towards an older crowd, more than some young twenty-something year old trying to gain benefit from watching this. Just know that it is not all Madea here in this movie. There are some funny parts and there are some dramatic parts into this movie. To get the full enjoyment out of this movie, you will have to follow both plots here (it's not so hard toward the end though). I don't think it's worth your 9 bucks to see this movie. Wait until it comes out on DVD. Peace.",1237680000,2,2208,4.867021276595745
8347406,5,B001WAKOX0,This was another funny show and serious all at the same time. Watched this with my Mother she is 84 years old. My Mom loves Madea. We ended up watching 3 different Madea movies tonight and this was one. There are some cussing as always.  We are both adults so its nothing we haven't heard. My  Mom laughs so hard during these movies that makes it half the fun.,1528416000,,360,4.202898550724638
