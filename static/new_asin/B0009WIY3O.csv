But, I am truly impressed with the show - specifically the direction provided by Joe Dea.  Joe was instrumental in the development, production and editing of the pilot episode.

The program is actually airing on INHD this summer in glorious 1080i HD (the DVD is SD - they have not released the standard for HD-DVDs).  If you have cable in the U.S. and subscribe to the HD package you will be able to see MotorSport Ranch - set your TIVO.  In the meantime take a look at the DVD and write a review if you have a minute.
