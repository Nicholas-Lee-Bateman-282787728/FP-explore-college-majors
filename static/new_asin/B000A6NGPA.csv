8074912,5,B000A6NGPA,"I love Champions By the Bay, everytime I am getting ready for a game I watch the movie. It gets me motivated, gives me some tips, shares some great plays, swings and stories about incredible players.

The 1989 season was incredible and what those teams, managers and players went through to make it to the world series and there play well even after the earth quake is incredible.",1343174400,,380,4.588235294117647
8074913,5,B000A6NGPA,"This video is a fantastic video yearbook for both the SF Giants and Oakland A's and their amazing World Series Season that was disrupted by the San Francisco Bay Area Earthquake just prior to the start of Game 3.  From the view as the biggest Will Clark and Rickey Henderson fan, there is lots of footage that adequately display their great talents and the impact they've had on their respective ball clubs.  This video is a must have for any fan in the Bay area of either of these teams.",1303689600,,488,4.411111111111111
