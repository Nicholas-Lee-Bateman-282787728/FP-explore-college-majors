8519149,2,B007KRPOVG,"The DVDs I bought were very disappointing. While the HD picture is fantastic, the English subtitles are atrocious. They are clearly written by one whose first language is not English. Some sections are omitted due to lack of translation. Having watched the series previously, I was very aware of the poor translation. The DVDs have all been previously watched, as every one I viewed began mid-episode, even though I paid $150.00. I will not order from Amazon again.",1376870400,,465,4.9743589743589745
