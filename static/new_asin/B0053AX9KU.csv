Well, if this film doesn't touch you deeply I don't know what will. It's a fictionalized account based on true events of four orphaned children in Tokyo, trying to sustain themselves and live somewhat normal lives while trying to stay together. Get your heartstrings ready for a heavy workout.

A young mother with 2 boys and 2 girls ages 4 to 12, moves into an apartment and deceives the landlord into thinking it is just she and her 12 year son. Soon we meet the other 3 siblings and it doesn't take long before they all endear themselves to the audience. Mother, who although easy going with her children, sets down the rules which may never be broken. No noise, and other then Akira, the oldest boy, no one can ever go outside. As she leaves them each day to go to work, they follow the rules, Akira looking out for his younger siblings. But Mom, we soon learn is more childlike then the children themselves. Putting her own social life ahead of the kids, she leaves them for weeks, then again, never to return again.

As Akira tries to balance the budget, frugally using the money she left, and being caregiver to the family, the rest of the kids learn to make do with what they have; survival becomes the objective.  Their world falls to pieces; scrounging for food, losing the use of basic utilities, we watch their gradual descent into depression as they live in filth, and their exaltation when they decide to break the ""rules"".

Everyone of these kids will find a place in your heart. You may feel like grabbing them up and taking them in yourself. I thought the children were portrayed wonderfully by the actors, and could feel all the very real emotions and fears each was feeling. Even the happiness they felt at just the little extravagances, like getting to go out for a walk, celebrating a holiday, hitting a baseball, making a friend. A face full of the joy of a short freedom will stay with you for quite a while. The extraordinary filming also gave a good look at their life and their surroundings.
I loved the music as well.

It's a wonderfully intense story, and worth a couple of views at least. One that will stay with you for quite a while after the view. If you are looking for action and special effects, pass this one by. The only thing that kept me from going 5 stars was that I didn't feel closure at the end; I would have liked to have known more of what the future held for these marvelous children.
