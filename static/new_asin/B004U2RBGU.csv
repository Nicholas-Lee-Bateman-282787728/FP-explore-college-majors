4466182,2,B004U2RBGU,"I will start with saying that Trigun is my all time favorite anime series, and ranks in my top 10 TV series ever. This movie feels like the creators watched the first episode of Trigun and said ""we got it! start writing the script!"" The movie feels like a shallow copy of Trigun. It has none of the charm, wit, or storytelling of the series. The storyline is totally pointless, with nothing being accomplished. The characters do not learn anything or grow on their own. They are written to share ideals of Vash (the series Hero) for no reason. Vash believes that every situation can be salved without death and in the series you learn why this belief is so dear to him. in the movie, it is not explained at all, so new viewers will not understand why this is an issue. Nor will they understand the relationships with the side characters. If a studio is going to make a Movie, it needs to stand on its own legs for new viewers. I could go on for a while, but I don't feel this movie is worth it. I would recommend spending your cash on the original series and ignoring this movie all together.",1317254400,10,1092,4.331707317073171
4466183,5,B004U2RBGU,"Trigun is an amazing balance of comedy and drama spiced with action.  Trigun has tons of entertaining humor but there remains an underlining of serious issues.  Trigun has a western type feel to it with the addition of some futuristic technology place within it.  I watch lots of anime and out of the hundreds that I have seen Trigun stands out for it humor and action.  This is worth the money you pay for it.

For those of us who have seen the original TV series and liked it, this is a must buy.  Nearly as good as the the TV series.
For those of you who have not seen the original TV series of Trigun, this movie still offers quite a lot of entertainment and does not require seeing the TV series to understand the plot.",1317081600,,724,4.248175182481752
4466184,2,B004U2RBGU,"I loved the 26 episode series. It has a great mix of comedy and serious story telling. I own all the DVDs and have had many repeat viewings. This movie is pretty dull. There are a few cool Wolfwood action scenes toward the end but Vash kinda sucks in this story. If you've never seen Trigun before, watch the entire series first, don't start with this movie. If your a huge Trigun fan it's still worth watching at least once.",1317081600,8,425,4.325
4466185,4,B004U2RBGU,"This is a nice little side story in the Trigun Universe.  Vash, Meryl, Milly, and Wolfwood all appear in this movie.  Like most movies based on series, it doesn't really fit anywhere within the timeline of the series, so the problems that are introduced within the movie are solved in the movie, the new characters introduced in the movie go there own way at the end of the movie and the main characters are pretty much the same at the end of the movie as they were in the beginning.  This works well for Trigun, since a lot of episodes from the series are like this also.

If your a fan of Trigun looking for something new, I recommend this.  If you've never seen Trigun, the series is a better starting place.",1317081600,6,711,4.356060606060606
4466186,4,B004U2RBGU,"I was fortunate enough to see the world premier of this movie at sakura con 2010, and it was fairly good.  It has a similar mix of action and humor as the series.  And the art has improved with the time passed.  The plot works and (trying not to give too much away) is partly centered on a new character (Amelia) and the villain of the film, Gasback.  The characters are handled well and the writers do a good job creating a story that lets them have Vash and Wolfwood work with and against each other.  While the story works over all it is mostly fun just because it lets us revisit the characters from the series and sets up some cool moments.  Although if they do more of the films the basic setup could become a bit tiresome if they do as so many other anime movies based of tv series do and become formulaic, but by itself its pretty good.  Visually the movie is fairly close to the series with some tweaks to designs and a fuller somewhat odder world.  Over all its not perfect but is pretty good.

Bluray Edit/update
As far as the Blu-ray goes it has a surprising amount of special features for a Funimation release. It is all pretty much from the Japanese stuff and a lot of it is trailers and short interviews, how interesting they are varies.  The picture quality is very good and shows off the art.  The audio is nice and has both voice tracks, personally I enjoyed the English one better even with the recast voices.  Johnny Yong Bosch reprises his role as Vash and while his voice is not exact it is still fairly close to how he originally sounded.  Everyone else has new voice actors and much to my surprise it was not distracting.  Luci Christensen replaces Dorothy Elias-Fahn as Meryl and may be an improvement. Trina Nishimura takes over as Milly and comes off surprisingly close to the previous voice.  My only real disappointment was Wolfwoods voice, the new voice was well done and fits the character but I really like Jeff Nimoy's work as the character.",1316649600,2,1974,4.429362880886426
4466187,5,B004U2RBGU,"I was fortunate to see a screening of this movie at Mechacon 2011 in New Orleans, and it was a real treat.  I wasn't sure what to expect, considering I have a good view on what the series was and was supposed to be, and how many ways there were to mess something up.  But everything is pretty much perfect!  It plays out like a longer episode of the series with higher production values.  The new characters are nice additions, and here are several shoutouts to the old series (hard to believe it's thirteen years old now).  The comedy is the standard and always enjoyable Vash the Stampede's zany actions, including over-the-top infatuation with the new character Amelia.  The action scenes and gunplay have been polished and refined, with things like characters actually reloading, etc.  I really can't think of a single thing to say negatively about it.  You could make the argument that I'm biased, and that's fair, considering I've been a fan for several years and viewed the movie within a room filled with nothing but other fans, with every gag onscreen bringing up a completely warranted roar of laughter.  There should be more reviews soon that will give a more fair view of the technical quality.  But if you want a fan's opinion: it is exciting and hilarious.",1314576000,59,1270,4.705882352941177
4466188,5,B004U2RBGU,"I was lucky enough to be able to see this in the theater in a nearby town. And i can't wait to watch it again. My friends and i are going to get together and watch it the day it comes out. This is an amazing Trigun story, i don't care what the hardcore people say. It was hilarious and full of every thing you could expect from Vash ""The Humanoid Typhoon"" Stampede!!!!!",1313884800,8,369,4.068493150684931
4466189,5,B004U2RBGU,"YES! After a long loonggg time comming, the Trigun movie is coming stateside IN ENGLISH! Vash is awesome and I watched the English Sub version a long time ago and needed to watch this in English. GREAT movie if your a fan of Anime and for fans of the show like me, this is a must have, and on Blu-ray, oh ya!",1312934400,13,308,3.9838709677419355
4466190,5,B004U2RBGU,"Twelve years after the release of the original series in 1998, the busy Madhouse Studios have finally revisited the hugely popular world of Trigun with Vash the Stampede back for another adventure. Original director Satoshi Nishimura returns having directed very little in the meantime (other than highly regarded Hajime no Ippo TV series) and staff credits in shows such as Eden of the East, Monster and Kiba.

Trigun is one the classic anime TV series from the 90s but donft expect this movie to expand on any of the themes of the original. It is feature length side story involving a bank robbery gone wrong, a crew lead by the infamous robber Gasback is betrayed by his crew and twenty years later he is about to exact his final act of revenge. Gasback has a bounty of 300bn on his head and rumours of his next heist draws bounty hunters everywhere to Macca City, including Vash the Stampede.

If you havenft seen or donft remember the TV series (I can barely recall much about the story) Vash is a misunderstood bounty hunter who has built up a criminal reputation for being involved large robberies. People call him the humanoid typhoon but in reality he is there to prevent the crime from succeeding and stop anyone from getting killed. Vashfs normal demeanor is an obnoxious goofball which makes an excellent cover mistaking him for an impostor.

Twelve years ago this sort of cartoony comedic action was the norm but Trigun differed in that it had an interesting backstory and world. It is set in a futuristic wild west but not in the way Cowboy Bebop was, it is more steam punk with a mix of old and new but very steeped in the traditional western atmosphere of deserts, isolated towns and rampant crime. If I remember correctly the world that they are on is not Earth but some planet that was colonised after large colony ships crashed there.

This movie is a fun return to the world of Trigun but it is definitely missing the broader themes and story of the original series. It has plenty of great over the top action scenes which is a throwback to the 90s which is infrequently done well these days. It is nice to see a HD widescreen version of Trigun, as the original was 4:3, the animation really pops with the vibrant colors of the original. Ifd recommend people see the TV series if they havenft and if they want to see more just keep in mind this is really just a side story.",1301184000,5,2393,4.545243619489559
4466191,2,B004U2RBGU,"I was so excited to see another Vash coming onto the scene.  Unfortunately I was disappointed.  The music was all wrong and  I also felt that it was just a bit ""off"".  Maybe it was harder to come up with something after so long a break in between.",1493251200,,247,4.083333333333333
4466192,5,B004U2RBGU,Its amazing! Johnny Young Bosch returns as Vash the Stampede.,1491091200,,61,5.2
4466193,4,B004U2RBGU,"The movie begins as a typical TRIGUN episode, then leaps forward in time twenty years, to find that nothing has changed; neither Vash, Millie, Meryl, or Wolfwood has aged a day. This makes hash of the original series and its ending, but since the twenty year gap in ""Badlands Rumble"" is a crucial plot point, it's better to just relax and enjoy the movie for what it is: a triple-length TV episode with a bigger budget, more fluid animation, and better drunk jokes. Nice to have, but essential? Nah.",1487462400,2,499,4.617977528089888

And it's not bad. The animation is gorgeous. Some obvious CGI here and there but all in all it was a nice addition to the whole story of Vash the Stampede.",1473120000,,369,4.125

4466201,5,B004U2RBGU,I was so happy when I heard this movie was coming out. It had been years since finishing the manga and the anime and I was ready to see some more! It was great to see the gang back together and running wild on Planet Gunsmoke and if you're a fan of the Humanoid Typhoon you should get a kick out of the wild west antics in this one.,1467590400,,332,3.8260869565217392
4466202,3,B004U2RBGU,"This is a review for the movie itself, not the DVD/Blu-Ray quality.  If you've seen the show, you've seen the movie.  Other reviewers have made the same comment that it's like a longer episode, with higher production value; but why they say that like it's a good thing, I have no idea.  The entire time I watched this movie, I kept thinking I had seen this before (and no, I had not).  It was like experiencing Dj vu for an hour straight.  And maybe that's what you want.  Maybe you're a giant fan like most of the other reviewers and that's exactly what you're looking for in a Trigun movie.  I am, and I thought that's what I was looking for, until I watched it.  Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad movie.  I still give it 3 stars.  It's enjoyable, and whether you're a long-time fan, or completely new to this world, chances are you'll be entertained.",1464739200,,854,4.314465408805032

This felt like I was back in the series and was done very well. Some of the voices changed, guess they couldn't get the voice actors back? Either way, was done very well. It takes place before Wolfwood dies so it was great seeing another adventure with him in it. The story ties in with the Trigun theme very well.

4466257,5,B004U2RBGU,"This is my very first exposure to Trigun and Ill have to say that I was so taken with it that I watched it two evenings in a row.  The graphics and musical score are amazing and I thought the English voice cast did a great job.  Im not usually one to spend much time with a shoot em up type story but this one held my interest.  I actually found all the gun play to be quite entertaining.  (Strange, but to me, some parts were reminiscent to Antonio Banderas Desperado, without the humor this little movie offers.)  This movie is quirky, as other reviewers have pointed out, which makes it that much more fun. The star character, Vash the Stampede, is loveable, light-hearted most of the time, funny and a bit of a bumbler, and tries to be suave with the ladies but misses the mark (or does he?)  He almost seems out of place with all the serious ruffians and female leads he comes across on his journey to and within the little town of Gasback. But, when he has to, he really knows how to take care of business.  Im still trying to figure out why he has such a high price on his head because it seems hes trying to save lives rather than take them. The story is a good one, reaching back 20 years for several of the characters, with reflections back in time for others.  This all comes together to round out the story.  It also has some twists and turns to keep the audience's curiosity peaked.  I enjoyed it so much, I've ordered the complete series this evening and cant wait to watch that as well.",1424217600,,1501,4.253521126760563

4466291,4,B004U2RBGU,"Vash the Stampede rides again in this midquel, and all because the fans demanded it! Since Cowboy Bebop: The Movie did some decent business for its franchise as a midqual, mostly due to the strong American fanbase, one for Trigun was also made. Unfortunately, this movie came out about 12 years after the original anime ended, but it still managed to gain enough momentum from otaku on both sides of the Pacific to propel this space western into being made in the first place.

Beginning about 20 before the TV series began, the ""Humanoid Typhoon"" manages to stop a bank robbery by the large outlaw Gasback, who himself is betrayed by his own gang that make off with the loot. Fast-forward to sometime around the middle of the anime series(at least after Wolfwood first appeared), Gasback is still at large, and threatens to take out the members of his old gang who used their stolen money to become big shots, like the last one in his list Cain who became a city's mayor. Cain hires dozens of completely bombastic bounty hunters to try and stop Gasback, and all this noise attracts Vash to make sure things go down peacefully. Insurance agents Milly and Meryl show up too to deal with any damages caused by this grand shootout. Gasback finally arrives, but he's managed to rope Wolfwood in as his personal bodyguard for saving his life. Instead of trying to kill Cain, Gasback makes off with his city's giant lightbulb which powers it main generator. Meanwhile, the appearance of a sexy redhead named Amelia has spurned Vash's affections, and she seems to have a personal beef with Gasback that goes way beyond a large bounty.

As a movie, this fills in the bill for a standard Trigun story stretched out to 90 minutes. Obviously the quality of animation is a lot better, but still keeps the flavor of the 90s TV series. It acts a good stand-alone chapter, while at the same time works as a great intro to the Trigun universe. Badlands Rumble is definitely a fine look at what makes anime sci-fi truly awesome, so pick it up for your library today.",1411603200,,2049,4.641873278236915

4466311,4,B004U2RBGU,"The only downside to doing a feature film version of a TV show is making length seem not like an issue: after all, a TV show is between 30 minutes and an hour. Trigun episodes clocked in at 30, meaning this one film is the length of three episodes. While the show did that with expertise, sometimes stretching a story over multiple episodes, this one felt like two episodes stretching into three. There are multiple spots early on that linger on gazes, character silence, minor things that pad out the story until the real plot gets rolling. Does this hold it back? Nope. Overall, this is primo Trigun, comparable to some of the better episodes. For some, however, those pauses are going to keep people at bay.

Trigun is one of the only anime I prefer English dub over Japanese. However in the movie many of the voice actors were different so it felt a bit off. However Vash is still the same.

I wouldn't try to fit the movie into the series. It is best to think of it as a standalone. Many things don't add up or are missing. Possibly they were just oversights when creating the movie. If you had to place it, likely between episode 9 and 12 somewhere. After Wolfwood sets off into the desert and before meeting Legato.",1390262400,,589,4.25

4466324,5,B004U2RBGU,"This movie is everything I loved about the series.  I loved the first half of the TV show over the second because I enjoyed the humor and episodic situations a lot more than the melodrama and angst of the latter half.
This movie is just like the first half of the series; it drops you and the characters into a situation and allows you to watch the hilarity unfold.  This is now my favorite thing to come out of the anime, because it was everything I loved about Trigun and nothing that I found annoying.  The emotion and drama are at just the right balance with the humor.  I'm not sure WHERE in the series this is supposed to take place, but in a way its fitting that we can't tell because then we can just enjoy the movie for what it is instead of trying to mentally tie it in with the series.
And it allows us to have more of all four of the gang; Vash, Meryl, Millie, AND Wolfwood.  Yes.
As for the voice acting, I found it even better than the series.  I had watched the TV show first, and was hesitant when I heard this movie got new actors for three of the characters (thank fully Vash stayed the same; that would have been tragic).  But part way into the movie I decided that if anything, I liked the new actors BETTER than the ones from the series.  They did a wonderful job sounding close enough, but adding their own flavor to the characters and it worked out wonderfully.
The animation and effects were also way up, although that shouldn't be surprising considering the leaps in animation and tech since the original series was finished.  The fight scenes were very clear and visually appealing, and movements very fluid.

I would be very happy if they would just continue to make movies like this.  I know some people complain that its more of the same, but I didn't get enough of this before the series turned into a soap opera on me, so I'm HAPPY to have more of the goofyness of Trigun back.  And its not just the goofy; there are deep moments as well.  The villain is one of the most interesting I've seen in the Trigun series by far.  A despicable person, and yet you can't help but relate with him.  There's the saying in the writing world about how a hero is great and all, but a good villain is what really makes a story.  Between Vash and Gasback, they make a VERY good story for me.",1385769600,,2306,4.266666666666667

4466359,5,B004U2RBGU,"I own the entire Trigun series, the manga, and even playing cards with Trigun screenshots on them. When I learned about this movie I immediately bought it and let me just say it was worth it. This movie brings back all our favorite characters with updated animation that makes me drool just thinking about it!

One of the central characters, Amelia, was actually one of my favorite characters in this movie. Usually, whenever a female character is added to a series, I usually get annoyed with them pretty fast but Amelia is definitely one of my favorite female anime characters ever. Her style and attitude was really fun to watch and when she was approaching Gasback with Wolfwood, I have to say that had to be one of the most epic scenes. Also, the scene where Vash gets shot was really well done. The way the sound was muted was a nice touch and the monologue given by Amelia and Wolfwood was executed well. The reactions of all the characters when they believed Vash was dead was really nice and carried real emotion. Especially that of Wolfwood and Meryl. A nice touch that I'm not sure how many people noticed was when Wolfwood was wearing Vash's glasses as he was fighting. That really hit home to me how close Vash and Wolfwood's friendship was.

The soundtrack as usual was amazing! Every sequence fit the scenes perfectly. When the the opening song for trigun started playing when Vash came up behind Wolfwood, I could barely hold back the fangirl squeal.

Now for the sub/dub discussion. Both of them have their pros and cons. The Japanese brought back all the original cast from the Trigun anime, but I felt that Vash's voice didn't have as much emotion as Johnny Young Bosch's portrayel did. Some of the lines were also more funny in English than Japanese. Also, in English when Amelia's mother was dying, the actor didn't have enough ""dyingness"" in her voice. (Pardon the made up word.) She didn't sound like she was dying. Overall, I thought the dub was better than the Japanese version. It was well executed and since there was no subtitles to read, I could focus all my attention on the wonderful art and actually enjoy what was going on in the scene. Colleen Clinkenbeard did an excellent job as Amelia and Johnny was still amazing as Vash.

All in all, this gets two thumbs up from me. A definte must see! d(^_^)b",1376611200,,2333,4.614457831325301

The video and sound on this blu-ray were perfectly fine, as I find it far less noticeable with animation for audio or video issues when compared to live action movies or TV. It was a rollicking good time with a few interesting twists. I watched this in the original Japanese with the subtitles, so I cannot speak to the dub.

the movie itself comes in a nice sleeve featuring the cover art you can see in the images of the product, all the metallic objects on the front (ie the bullet casings and the metal on his shoes) have been extruded and has a nice shiny finish along with a shiny finish on all the red text all around the sleeve making it very nice to look at in the right light.

once you get that shiny sweet sleeve off (and you may not want to believe me it looks nice) you get to the regular case which features the same art as the sleeve just less shiny (disappointing I know) however you can remove the cover art and flip that jazz around and use the alternate art its got on the back side which features a compilation of many of the movies main characters. the case itself is sturdy and holds the two disks that come with the movie (disk one being the film and disk two being the extras) each disk has its own spot to clip in so their not just piled on top of each other and left to scratch(a problem I've had with other dvd collections I've bought)the disks are both red and feature the same image the only difference being the designation between disk one and disk two.

if you like the show Trigun its worth checking out and it'll look good sitting in your collection, if you didn't like the show Trigun then buy it anyway its a nice looking dvd and will still look good sitting in your collection.",1366848000,,1624,4.232258064516129

I'll be straight forward with this, if you're looking to get back in touch with all the characters you came to love from the series you're in luck, however if you happen to be a first time viewer of this having no backround at all in the show you might be a little lost. The only benefit from watching the show is the instant character recongnition and their backrounds, this movie does not follow any part of the original anime which i was a little dissapointed in but viewed from a side story as itself it does more then okay. The animation in the movie is very pleasing to the eye (i personally wish they would re do the whole anime in this caliber :)) The only thing that bothers me is the comparison of the animation in the movie to the anime series really shows the anime series age. As for the story I can say that it kept me drawn in with action and chuckles here and there and its a good watch overall. In general if you're a fan of the show you will enjoy this, (feels like having an old friend back lol). The reason i only gave it four stars is because i would have liked it to have more of a connection to the series but all and all it was worth it to see that gun slinger vash lose it over some donuts again.",1364860800,,1361,4.101123595505618

The late 1990's to the early 2000's was a great time for anime in the United States and in general with a boom in popularity with shows like Cowboy Bebop, Big O, Zoids: Chaotic Century, Outlaw Star, Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team, Trigun, Blue Gender, Fullmetal Alchemist and others. I had always been an anime fan growing up with anime shows like Transformers, Robotech and Voltron, but that was the time I truly became an avid fan of the genre. Still originally I skipped Trigun the anime series. From the trailers and previews I had seen it looked too much like an over the top comedy series, but my older brother convinced me to give it a try and loaned me his VHS tapes. For those of you who don't know Trigun takes place on a distant planet after generations ago humans left earth to settle on a new world and the story follows Vash the Stampede who has also been nicknamed the Humanoid Typhoon for all the destruction that follows him. The anime follows this carefree guy who doesn't seem like the guy who brings chaos and destruction with him, but sadly for him and the people around him it seems to happen. I was surprise at how good the anime series was and is. Sure at the beginning there is a lot of comedy and there is humor throughout the series, but I think it's there to lighten the mood of the series, because without it Trigun would be a very dark and bleak series and it works as the anime series manages to blend drama, action, humor and even romance almost perfectly. Oh it the series has one of the best death scenes a film or anime series ever. It has become one of my favorite anime series of all time, so when I heard about there being a Trigun film being made back in 2008 and 2009 I was very skeptical. I really didn't think it was necessary especially if it wasn't going to be connected to the anime series like the Cowboy Bebop film was connected to their anime series. The film was released in Japan in 2010 and in the United States a few months ago. I finally got to see the film a few days ago. Was there need for a Trigun film no, and was the film good and again the answer is no.

Trigun: Badlands Rumble barely there plot starts twenty years in the past where a gang of thieves led by the huge man Gasback who enjoys showing off and the big robberies. Things go smoothly for them as they get the money. That is until Gasback's men turn on him shooting him in the eye. Things look bad for the gang leader until Vash stumbles in clumsily and saves Gasback's life. Does Gasback thank him as his former comrades make off with all the money and the bank is surrounded by the police no he doesn't. Instead he hits a button and launches a whole bunch of missiles laying waste to the town and the bank. Twenty years later Gasback has formed another gang and is looking for revenge on his former comrades. One former comrade runs Macca City where Gasback is headed with his men and his body guard Wolfwood. Vash is also headed on a steamer where he runs into the beautiful Amelia who is after the 300 million double dollar reward for Gasback. They hang out in the city until Gasback attacks and things get out of hand from there.

The plot isn't very good. The problem with it is it doesn't follow any continuum whether it be the manga or anime so it will be confusing for a fan of the manga or anime series like me let alone a new comer. If you haven't seen or read the anime and manga and try to check out this film you will be completely lost. The writers don't bother to introduce or give any background to Vash, Wolfwood, Meryl or Milly who are from the Manga and Anime series. The writer and directors just assume that a newcomer will be able to follow or care about these characters, and even with my love for the anime series and manga I barely cared about the plot or the characters. I love Vash he's a great character and he was again the best character in the film, but even he was a letdown. The story just didn't carry the depth, humor or emotional impact that one episode of the anime series did.

What can I give praise to is the animation down by the great anime company Madhouse. The same company that has done great anime series and films like Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, Gungrave, Wicked City, Record of Lodoss War, Ninja Scroll, three Batman films and more. The detail in this film is amazing from the facial expressions to the vehicles Madhouse did an outstanding job bringing this film to life and honestly it was the best thing about Trigun: Badlands Rumble.

Going into this film I wasn't expecting much, but I was hoping for a good anime film. Sadly that isn't what I got. Trigun: Badlands Rumble fails to entertain newcomers or fans of the series and manga with a weak plot, lack of character depth or emotional connection, good music. The only thing that the film has going for it is the excellent animation done by Madhouse, so sadly I can't recommend this film to a newcomer to anime or a fan of Vash. Instead if you are interested in Vash I would recommend you read the two manga series or better yet check out the anime series which I consider the best of all of them.",1356307200,2,5378,4.337636544190666
4466409,3,B004U2RBGU,"movie didn't show any of the unique points that the series has like honor, kindness, and connecting relationships.  I would not buy this movie.  The movie was thrown together were a lot of stuff was explained in the ending credits.",1355616000,,231,4.75

But after purchasing and watching this movie I must say that it had everything the original series had all packed into one movie.

The story is great and fits nicely into the already established world. The characters are true to who they were in the series and the bluray is simply phenomenal. The new characters they added for the storyline all have an interesting intertwined history that makes for a great story for Vash and his friends to become a part of.",1354233600,,614,4.339130434782609

4466415,5,B004U2RBGU,"Bought this at Wal-Mart cheaper than it's currently selling for on Amazon.  Just to let you all know.

I am a huge fan of the Trigun series.  For anyone who has not seen it or is new to the series, make sure and check this tv series out!  This movie occurs roughly somewhere in the middle of the series.  It is not a sequel to the series, more like an addition to it.  But the darn dvd box will not fit into my trigun box set, so it will have to just sit beside it.

Anyway for anyone not familier, Vash the Stampede, the main character, is an outlaw on this planet (whose name escapes me at the moment.)  All the inhabitants are here as the result of their space ships crashing here hundreds of years ago.

So this is science fiction to say the least.  But it focuses more on gun slinging than anything else.  Bullets seem the cheapest and easist way to kill each other, so that's what people use.

Vash is a mysterious character.  Also he has a bounty of 60 billion dollars on his head.  For wiping out an entire city.  You'll have to watch the series for more on that...

This movie quite honestly is geared toward the fans.  If you are not familier already, you will be lost going into this.  Nothing is really explained at all, driving home the point further that this is for existing fans.

The action is great, there are a few thought provoking moments.  At the end I was pleased and plan to rewatch this very soon.

I recommend you buy the tv series and movie at the same time.  Watch them both together.  If you are new to Anime or a fan of the genre who somehow missed this gem, go for it.  I am confident you will not be disappointed.",1332979200,,1645,4.182108626198083
4466416,4,B004U2RBGU,"Badlands Rumble takes place somewhere in the middle of the Trigun series and serves as a visit back to Vash's particular brand of madcap adventure.

The series is known for it's blend of comedy and drama (until turning much more serious later).  The movie captures this very well, keeping Vash's lighthearted approach throughout while still dealing with things like the harshness of life, revenge, taking responsibility and self sacrifice.

Badlands Rumble should be accessible for new viewers, but you will get a lot more out of the details if you've seen the series first.

The animation was excellent, a step up from the series while still retaining the same feel.  I'm not much of a technophile when it comes to specs and the like so I'll just say the picture and sound were both great.  I prefer the original audio so only watched it that way.  **Note: the subtitles are done in white, which can be very hard to see sometimes.  Just advanced warning.**

Definitely worth checking out for fans of the series or anyone who doesn't mind silliness and thought mixed into their action.",1330214400,,1085,4.821621621621621
4466427,5,B004U2RBGU,"I love Trigun the anime series. I would list it in my top five series I love. This movie is no exception to that. I love the storyline, it's right out of something you could imagine happening during one of the trips Vash takes across the desert world of Gunsmoke. There are some subtle differences in design from the anime to the movie and that has a lot to do with the comics. His coat, gun, millie's coat and gun, and a few other things are very much based off the comic books instead of the anime but it doesn't disrupt the flow of the show at all.
I picked up both the blu ray and dvd sets because I do quite enjoy this movie and all things Trigun and hope for more to be released.
If you like futuristic westerns and the original series of anime (which Funimation has the current rights to and has released a nice set for 21 or so dollars) this will feel right at home in your collection.

About the dub though funimation switched out the voices of Meryl, Millie, and wolfwood from the original Geneon release. Vash is still though voiced by Johnny young Bosh (and honestly I couldn't hear anybody else trying to do his voice). I don't like Meryl or Wolfwood's voice but it wasn't to much of a shocker for me to not overlook. Millie actually sounded better then the original to my ears but again not a deal breaker.

If you love the original anime this should be a no brainer on buying.",1329609600,,1391,4.265151515151516
4466428,3,B004U2RBGU,"Recently picked this up for my wife, who's a huge Trigun fan.  We settled down to watch it in Japanese with English subtitles (as we do all of our anime) and were appalled to find the subtitles were small and white.  As any Trigun fan can tell you, the dialogue can sometimes be rather rapid fire; strainging to see the subtitles before they were gone became infinitely more frustrating when they disappeared against light-colored images.  And this being Trigun, there's a lot of sun-baked desert to project tiny subtitles on.  The end result was that my wife walked out in disgust while I stuck it out to try and tally how much I could read.  I would estimate nearly 20% of the subtitles were either difficult or impossible to read.  This made for a very disappointing experience.  Shame on you, Funimation!  Yellow subtitles always work better.

As far as the movie itself goes, it's fine - more of the same classic Trigun lunacy (considerably lighter than the later parts of the series).  Animation was superb and there were some fine action scenes.  The 3-star rating reflects more the overall experience than the quality of the movie, which without the subtitle issue rates a solid 4 (or even 4.5) stars.",1328400000,3,1209,4.7368421052631575

This movie pretty much plays out like most of the episodes, Vash starts goofy, then gets serious and helps someone who wasn't inherently bad realize the errors of their ways...

To be honest I think the problem was it was hard to really get involved with the new characters with a short time period to get to know them in. I loved the humor at the beginning/middle of the movie, but when it came time to be serious I just didn't really feel anything for the new guys.

All in all it felt like too much crammed into a short movie, kind of like Serenity was to Firefly. Decent movie but man I wished it could have been made into more episodes.",1324166400,3,749,4.297872340425532

I loved watching it then, and the lack of subtitles and my lack of Japanese language skills didn't impede the enjoyment much at all. This movie picks up from the early Trigun episodes' funny character interactions between the whole gang, and adds a few new characters.

Don't look for any revelations about Trigun or the characters in this movie. Watching the DVD release made it clear that it is an extended Trigun episode, perhaps with better special effects. It includes all the characters you know and love, and has plenty of opportunity for Vash to save the day and improve people's lives. It's effective in recapturing the fun and spirit of the TV series, much as the Cowboy Bebop movie did before it. If you like the series, you'll love this movie.",1319760000,,1054,4.666666666666667

Cons: (SPOILER ALERT)
************************************
My biggest problem with this movie is Nicolas D. Wolfwood. If you watched the original series from start to finish, we remember seeing Wolfwood bleeding to death in a church.. or so we thought.. in Badlands rumble when wolfwood appears, working as Gasback's body guard, Vash makes a comment about how he he was sure Wolfwood was already dead. this leaves a bit of a story gap, as this confirms that Badlands rumble takes place some time after the original series.

To me, it seemed like the music was really subdued for the movie, which isn't bad, but it's the only part that seemed to disappoint me.

4466489,5,B004U2RBGU,"My dad pretty succinctly pointed out the only problem with this movie:  ""It's about 15 hours too short.""

Trigun: Badlands Rumble is a great movie, especially if you love the earlier parts of the original Trigun series.  What I love the most about this movie, though, is that it really feels like it could fit in with the continuity of the original story line.  The dynamics between the characters are developed only to the point they would be if you were watching this within the timeline of the anime.

The animation is great.  There is a lot of computer animation, but it is integrated very well with the 2-D animation (for example, the computer animation is shot at the same rate as the 2-D animation, making it appear seamlessly integrated, instead of ultra-smooth compared to the comparatively choppy 2-D animation).  The action scenes are really well choreographed and animated as well.

The character designs are more reminiscent of the manga (particularly visible in Milly's character design and Vash's coat design), and the world is bigger, as if borrowing from the manga (especially where robots and cyborgs are concerned).  The world is fuller and you really feel like you're in the middle of a bustling city.

The new voice actors for Meryl, Milly, and Wolfwood are pretty good.  The first time I watched it in English, I felt like something was off, but the second time I watched it, I found myself not really noticing, and in fact enjoying, the new voices.

Bottom line: if you like Trigun in its wacky hi-jinks phase, you'll love this movie.  Check it out!",1318464000,4,1572,4.799256505576208

4466491,5,B004U2RBGU,"Words cannot describe after all these years of waiting how worth it, this movie was!
It made me cry multiple times and had next to nothing wrong with it.

Pros-
Animation is AMAZING. Even more so than the original show which was marvelous for its' time!

Film Grain is back!-the biggest difference between the transition from Cel animation to digital animation is that it was no longer filmed on camera. A lot of people have found colors and everything to be ""too pure/solid"" but one look back to tons of anime from the Cel animation era is that they all had the same solid/pure colors that were generally offset by things such as the master film copy,AND film grain. Watch generally any cel animated show on blu-ray and you'll find film grain something that is notably absent on most modern anime. But according to the extras on the DVD,they wanted it to feel like a western so that's why they added film grain.

Imahori does the music again! And is incredibly fitting, fun, joyous and emotional!

It has EVERYTHING that makes Trigun, Trigun. Vash being a woman loving puppy, drinking scenes! Absurd humor, emotional moments that make you cry, and everything you can think of!

All of the original voice actors for the Japanese Dub are the same!

Cons-
It's only 90 minutes!

Only 1 of the main characters has the same Voice actor in the English version, and most importantly it is Vash. So that's not terribly a big deal considering the new actors for Millie,Meryl and Nicholas are VERY good and sound close to the original actors so to not change the characters much.

Wish there were more extras from the English voice actors as Johnny Bosch played Vash all those years back just as Masaya Onosaka voiced Vash when they made the show in 1998.

Overall this is an AMAZING movie, I've already watched it twice and it will remain among my top favorites for years to come!

Thank you so much Madhouse, Mr. Nightow everyone involved in making this movie a reality so much!
It was worth the wait!!!!!",1317686400,2,1998,4.63456090651558
4466492,3,B004U2RBGU,"Well I just watched this last night and I must say it doesn't feel like a true part of the original series. First of all the music is terrible. I found this to be the worst part of this outing. I couldn't focus on the scenes because the music just took away. OK there is also a bit to much computer generated images for my tastes and that was also a turn off. Dialogue is poor and veers towards the monologue at points (quite cliche). Some of the original voices are there but a couple MAIN CHARACTERS are NOT. Also a distraction. The storyline feels like a poor filler from the series and in reality you could probably watch this halfway through the original series and you'd completely forget about it. I really hate this because I was looking so forward to it!!!! OK on the PLUS!! It is very pretty in high definition (blu-ray) and the animations are pretty smooth. Good attention to small details, and I appreciate Vash's classic insanity still being there. The action is also very well put together (BEST part!!). Donuts are also a big part!! The first appearance of Vash is my favorite scene :) Hahaha

It is up to you really if you want this in your collection. I just wish I had rented (or borrowed) it first.
I don't hate it but I was disappointed.

Whether you agree or disagree thanks for reading :)",1317686400,10,1310,4.409090909090909
4466493,4,B004U2RBGU,"Storyline is alright, could have been better I guess. Seemed like an episode stretched out for 120 minutes (which of course is not horrible). I really liked the show and the english voice actors they used, but the movie casted different voice actors for several characters, most noticeably Meryl and Milly. I know many anime fans swear by reading the subtitles, that just ain't me. Recommended to anyone who has seen the series, anyone who hasn't maybe a little lost with the plot.",1317600000,3,481,4.807228915662651

Long-time anime fans should be no stranger to the world of Trigun. For all the goofy, donut-eating, light-hearted, love and peace(~!) moments and all the unknowing and spontaneous chaos and destruction brought about by just his mere presence alone, The Humanoid Typhoon, Vash the Stampede, is renowned for his naive, yet charming personality and is easily one of the more memorable characters in anime lore. But good grief, can you believe it's been 12 years since the TV series ended? Needless to say, the Sixty Billion Double Dollar Man is back for another go-around. If you're new to the anime medium and have no idea what I'm talking about, Trigun is an anime Spaghetti Western (with a little bit of sci-fi) that follows the adventures of Vash the Stampede, a socially-labeled outlaw of outlaws that is said to be the worst thing you could come across at any point of your life. They say he's big, they say he's bad, and if you're lucky they say you'll die a quick death! But in truth, it's just a bunch of rumors.

As I mentioned earlier about his happy-go-lucky qualities, Vash the Stampede is just trying to live his life and make the world a better place along his travels. Unfortunately, trouble does follow him pretty much everywhere he goes. Character analysis aside, this film is a one-shot story taking place in the Trigun universe in which a bank robber named Gasback is foiled by his own henchmen, only to be saved by Vash, but then pursues a plot of revenge against his former cronies. In the meantime, the last remaining target of Gasback's vengeance has put a rather large bounty on anyone who can stop him. I can't say much else that could entice newcomers, but if you've seen the series and know its material you will absolutely love the atmosphere. Pretty much all of the fan-favorite characters make their return appearance (all the good guys, anyway), and the writing itself is very fun and quirky like the first half of the series (before things got a lot darker). For dub fans, the only returning voice actor is Johnny Yong Bosch, but all the replacement actors do an excellent job filling in the gaps. And if this is your first time experiencing Trigun, definitely give the TV series a look. FUNimation did license both the series and movie and have reported that they do eventually plan on putting the series on BD at some point, so hope that they do it soon and keep an eye out for it.

Video - 5.0

- Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC
- Video resolution: 1080p
- Aspect ratio: 1.78:1
- Original aspect ratio: 1.85:1

I'm a bit biased here about the video presentation in 3 ways: 1) I'm a big fan of Madhouse and always have been; their animation is very high quality on a consistent basis and a lot of the TV shows, OVAs, and movies they've produced over the years have always ranked as some of my favorite anime titles. 2) as I said it's been 12 years since Trigun the TV series aired in Japan, and while it looks good, even the remastered DVDs show the animation's age, so I'm glad to see the same style redone with today's technology. And 3) it's an anime movie, which means a really high budget and less time constraints will make for a seemingly superior product both in terms of video and audio presentation when compared to a TV series. So with that said, we get Badlands Rumble presented in an aspect ratio of 1.78:1, an obvious upgrade from the series' 4:3 presentation back in the day. Not only am I delighted to see the Trigun world in true widescreen, but the HD video quality is the best I've ever seen the franchise look.

Oddly enough, the movie is digitally-produced but has a very cel animation look to it, as talked about in the extras with chief animation director, Takahiro Yoshimatsu. The results are utterly astounding, though, as I looked at both my remastered DVDs of the series and compared its quality to the movie. Granted, it's 12 years later with better technology and a bigger budget, but it's rare that I that I find an anime feature film that really reflects the amount of work put into, especially with a project as delayed as this had been. The line detail is my favorite part of the presentation giving the art style a very distinct look that's closer to the original manga design. Colors are extremely well-saturated with reds, yellows, and charcoals making up a majority of the color palette for the world's desserty theme. And they even added some grain to give the movie a more filmic and gritty texture that really makes it feel like the Old West. And even better, I can't say I remember any instances of banding, aliasing, or artifacting despite the movie itself being a digital production. Then again, the first time I saw this was at AnimeFest 2011 where the source was a DVD-R copy on a crappy projector in a badly-seated conference room and with even crappier audio.

Audio - 5.0

Languages
- Japanese: Dolby TrueHD 5.1
- English: Dolby TrueHD 5.1

Subtitles

As I said, the audio in that screening was crap. I sat in the third row closest to the speakers and could still barely make sense of the important parts (it was a dubbed screening, by the way). But boy howdy, does it sound better in lossless and in the comfort of my own home. Something else I should bring up with the case of anime on BD is that a lot of titles I've seen haven't had much in terms of true surround audio. Most TV shows these days in Japan are only even produced with a 2-channel sound design in mind, and when they come to the States the companies are simply remixing the audio masters in a quasi-matrixed (i.e. artificial) 5.1 dub. Sure, the idea of 5.1 English dubs SOUNDS like a good idea, but they're not true surround experiences. It's not often that a TV show actually gets one (unless it's just really high-budget like Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex or anything else by Kenji Kamiyama), but when we actually do get the chance for the real thing I'm especially happy about it.

With that said, the TrueHD 5.1 tracks for both the Japanese and English tracks sound perfect. Something that always bugged me about those artificial 5.1 tracks was the fact that dialogue sounded so damn quiet from the center. But here it's flawless in either language (both of which you really can't go wrong in terms of acting either). The sound effects and music (all hail Tsuneo Imahori for coming back to compose!) are spectacular as well. Gunshots, blowing wind, sand and gravel, and all the people chattering in the background have an amazing amount of depth and clarity. Action sequences, in particular, possess some great separation and directionality; the scene where Wolfwood makes his first appearance has a LOT of gunfire effects, and the bar fight with all the hooligans yelling about offers a good deal of sonic immersion. LFEs are potent and fitting for the movie's subtitle (Rumble), and while the sound design certainly isn't on the level of a Hollywood blockbuster, it still does its job with great precision. My favorite scenes for audio are the bar fight or all the craziness that ensues (both visually and aurally) and the scene at the end where Vash fights Gasback.

Extras - 5.0

I really have to hand it to FUNimation for this one. Previously, just about all of their other BDs have had next to nothing worth of special features outside of some English cast commentaries that never really contributed anything worthwhile to the creation process or provided any truthful insight into the shows they adapted. But here, there's a good 2+ hours of special features and all with the original Japanese cast and crew (all in SD). Interviews include:

- Creator: Yasuhiro Nightow (11:08)
- Voice of Vash: Masaya Onosaka (8:59)
- Voice of Milly: Satsuki Yukino (8:31)
- Director: Satoshi Nishimura (11:06)
- Voice of Wolfwood: Shou Hayami (10:00)
- Voice of Amelia: Maaya Sakamoto (6:43)
- Chief Animation Director: Takahiro Yoshimatsu (7:26)
- Voice of Meryl: Hiromi Tsuru (3:12)
- Voice of Gasback: Tsutomu Isobe (7:06)

All of them give VERY insightful comments on the general worldview of Trigun, their past experiences on the TV series (where applicable), their new experiences in doing the movie, and a lot of other interesting opinions. The interviews are rather candid, yet cordial and I have to say if you've ever seen these kinds of omake where cast and crew sit in front of the camera and answer questions, there are loads of things you can learn from them. In particular, I really enjoyed the interviews with Onosaka, Yukino, and Hayami. Onosaka because he seems like a very amicable person, which ties in extremely well to the way he portrays Vash. It's also a nice contrast to the more hot-head role of Tekeshi Sendou he played in Hajime no Ippo, which I watched a few months before this. Yukino because she's always been one of my favorite seiyuu, and I find it interesting that Milly was one of her very first roles in the industry. She gives a good amount of reflection on reprising the character and sounds very grateful for the opportunity she was given way back when. And Hayami, well, I'm just so used to hearing him play the villain, that I was very surprised to see that he looks as debonair as a lot of the characters he portrays (both good and bad). Additional features include:

- Movie Premiere at Cinema Sunshine Ikebukuro (8:47)
- Post Recording (3:51)
- A Mildly Amusing Story by Something Yoshimatsu (0:28)
- Video Footage from Anime Expo 2009 (1:38)
- Talk Event at Kawasaki Cinecitta (3:32)
- Special Talk Show (38:16)
- Web Promotion Clip (1:37)
- Promotional Video (2:23)
- Theatrical Commercial (00:37)
- Theatrical Trailer (1:39)
- Original Commercials (00:49)
- FUNimation Trailers

The Special Talk Show was by far the funnest feature for me. Anime and manga has such a strong following in Japan, and to see people of the industry having so much fun and interacting with their fans is a real treat to watch and listen to. The cast and crew that took part in this event were very laid back and welcoming to all the accolades and questions received from the audience. The whole thing just shows a lot of unity and the kind of investment Japanese fans really have for the industry in general. I wish the North American market was as successful. FUNimation, if you're reading this, put more extras like this on your BDs!

Overall - 5.0

It's been a few years since I've seen Trigun the series. But it left such a lasting impression that I still like it a lot to this day. And seeing this film makes me want to watch it again and even has me curious about the manga. Production values are through the roof with all of the Japanese cast returning, and at least Johnny Yong Bosch returning for the English dub. Regardless, though, even the new stand-ins do a great job, and I would definitely say you can't go wrong with either language track. I had absolutely no problems with the A/V quality, and I LOVE the fact that FUNimation actually put forth the effort of including all sorts of interesting interview material from the creator, cast, and crew of the film and series. Here's hoping for another movie, or even an adaptation of Trigun Maximum. If you're a fan of the series, this is a must-own. Casual anime fans, or even non-anime watchers, should at least give it a rent. And if you like it, try the series, too. Love and Peace~!",1317513600,17,11341,4.63894422310757
