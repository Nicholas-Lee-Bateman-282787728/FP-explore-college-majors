8175739,4,B000N9EK5E,"This film arose from a European woman's interest in Navajo culture, but it provides more depth than that might indicate. I found it useful to introduce students in my World Music classes to aspects of that culture, including adaptations to modern living conditions. The visuals of the countryside can be stunning. (I can't remember whether both Monument Valley and Canyon de Chelly are included, but in any case the exteriors are well photographed and the life of the people in those environments is the focus.)

Nice vignettes of a silversmith, a weaver, a traditional family breakfast. Discussion, by culture bearers, of philosophy and religious beliefs. Historical background on the forced migrations of the Navajos and the lingering, tragic results of those migrations. Pulls no punches.

No extended ritual or ceremonial footage; I get the impression that permission to film things like the Nightway or Enemyway is still tightly controlled, and usually denied to outsiders.

All in all, a very respectful and broad-ranging look at Navajo life today.",1230681600,12,1054,5.299401197604791
