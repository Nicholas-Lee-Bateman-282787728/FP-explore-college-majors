7855612,4,6303925111,"I really liked the actor Scott Plank in this engrossing film.  While everyone really fulfilled their roles, Scott Plank just stood out for me.  Doing research on him, there is very little, except to my dismay, I saw that he died from injuries resulting from an automobile accident.  I wish I had not looked further because this is very sad in that another promising and talented human being died way too soon.",1451174400,,409,4.652777777777778
