1653678,3,B00005R87N,"Of course there are no vampires in the film, silly. But it does have a great bat in the opening jazz-music titles.

One of my favorite of the sub Grade Z Franco-Italian thrillers of the early 60s. No, it's not LA DOLCE VITA by a light year, but it does try to pull off some 'Marcello and Anita-Styled' basement-rate moves in a hilarious, failed way with its low-grade minimalist sets, shimmering Black-and-white photography, and an ersatz-jazzy-sex music score by Armando Travolji. Of interest to mainly time-and-species watchers like myself who also have a fetish for an occasional dose of camp and kitsch.

Some choice moments make the 90 minutes tolerable:  Jeannette, the stripper, throwing a fit in the hospital where she ails disfigured from a strange car crash brought on by despair with her boyfriend, Pierre(with the help of a saxophone) and her having a fit and smashing the windows; Dr. Levin's Betty Paige lookalike assistant, Monique (love these names!), showing up to offer Jeannette reprieve from her disfiguration with some of that groovy Derma-25 (call Glaxo) ; Monique crying by her record player; and Sascha, the sulking rose gardener, who slinks around the entire movie looking like he is someone's Quasimodian S&M victim.

Jeanette's mostly absent gumshoe boyfriend, Pierre (or is he a Navyman?) shows up ocassionally in a trench coat and a square jaw. I think the wardrobe people just threw crap at him without regard to any back-story in their rush to get to a meal of spaghetti!  And Pierre doesn't get to do much more than coo ""Oh, Jeannette!!!"" and shove his hands in his pockets.

Dr. Levin is played by the woefully underused Albert Lupo, who must have been way down on his Italian luck when he took this job running around in a bad mask with a Billy Idol haircut. Lupo (which, oddly, translate as ""wolf"")  was a decent talent of his day (which could be said of a lot of Italian industry talent, like the wonderful Catherine Spaak).

Some great lines, too, like ""IT's not love, really, just some sort of sentiment!"" and  ""I want to possess you... creatively!""  I thought I was the only person who thought like this!!!

What's even better is that almost every line is dubbed with an exclamation point.  The dubbers in NYC must have been on 60s-era Black Beauties speed tabs the day they recorded this one. I bet they had a blast.

I suggest you rent this with ""Valley of the Dolls"" and get your fill of 60s camp, then run back to the cloister and repent.",932515200,2,2481,4.728538283062645

Sadly, the real ""star"" of the movie is a sorry sap and a bit of a drudge (Dick Purcell as James McCarthy).  There's also some involvement with voodoo, a kidnapped US Admiral, and a German spy (Henry Victor as Dr. Miklos Sangre).  The role of the German spy was intended for Bela Lugosi but he was unavailable.  They tried to get Peter Lorre but couldn't reach a satisfactory deal.  The part was finally turned over to Henry Victor.

1653706,2,B00005R87N,"King of the Zombies (1941)

 We can learn a lot by watching old movies, including this low budget comedy from 1941.  The plot is comfortingly familiar.  Three Americans fly across the Caribbean Sea when they make a crash landing on a tropical island.  They are befriended by a mysterious but well dressed refugee from Austria, Dr. Miklos Sangre.  (Sangre means blood).  The mystery man not only turns out to be a kidnapper, a spy for a foreign power but a man with a basement full of Zombies.  The doctor is played by British character actor Henry Victor who made a couple of dozen films from 1916 through 1945.  Like many horror film bad guys of the era, his Doctor Sangre formal, well educated and creepy.
 The real star of the show for me is Mantan Morehead, the personal servant of the main character (played by another busy character actor of the era, Dick Purcell).  Morehead was a comedian and black.  He had the best lines.  He portrays his character as fussy, cowardly and quick with a quip.  His style of acting would offend most people in the new century as demeaning to Black people.  Morehead made about 60 films, many of them aimed at Black audiences but just as many aimed at the more general market.  Big eyed black men who are scared of ghosts were once a staple of the movies.  Now we have Denzel Washington.  I enjoyed Mantan Morehead's work and found it to be instructive of American social evolution.
 Joan Woodbury and  John Archer round out the principal players.  They both had long careers but neither became household words.  In the 30s and 40s the studios made a lot of films, very quickly and without big budgets.  ""King of the Zombies"" fits right in there.  There are typical tiny budget flaws that we scoff at today.  The acting will seem strained and wooden by modern standards.  We can see the  wire holding up the airplane, we can see microphone shadows and the script is little more than a vehicle for comic set ups for Morehead.
 But the months just before the US entry into WWII made for some film oddities.  Nazis and Germany are never mentioned in the film, but the spys are clearly European and can be no body else.  In a sub plot an American admiral kidnapped by the Dr. get rescued at the last moment from a Zombie attended Voodoo ritual.
 Throw spies, Voodoo, comedy and Zombies together and you end up with something of interest to film historians.  It really isn't good enough to watch just on its merits as a Zombie flick.
 It would be rated PG today.  The Zombies are not scary at all, being just dead people who act more like low capacity slaves than monsters.  Two brains for this historical relic.",1414195200,,2646,4.533898305084746
1653707,2,B00005R87N,"Jeanette Moreneau (Susanne Loret) makes her living in the entertainment industry. This makes her boyfriend (Sergio Fantoni) mad; so he leaves for the sea. She ends up in an auto accident that and really burnt over the situation.

Along comes a brilliant doctor (Alberto Lupo) with a secret. He promises to put Jeanette back together again. In the process, the Doc falls in love with his patient. So now, his nurse assistant is only good from spare parts.

If you aree wondering how the doctor dedided to turn into a monster there are two suggested cenarios in the film:
1) He use the previous generation of the serum that is known to create monsters that need to take periodic stem baths.
2) Monsters from Japan, which were created by the atomic bomb, sneak in to the U.S. disguised as normal doctors.

Well it is show time, the police are getting suspicions and the boyfriend is back. Can Jeanette be permanently fixed before the doctor is permanently fixed by a police bullet or worse?",1411776000,,987,4.69364161849711

Yes, there are scenes that could be understandably considered offensive,  but no more than other movies of its genre.

1653723,2,B00005R87N,"Pierre (Sergio Fantoni) is a Navy Lieutenant by his bars, a Chief Petty Officer by his collar insignia. He breaks up with his stripper girlfriend Jeanette (Susanne Loret) who immediately explodes her car going down an embankment. WOW! Do sailors really date strippers?

She is in a hospital with a slightly disfigured face, one that skin grafts could cure, or her long hair could cover...which it does for most of the movie. She believes her face will always be this way as she contemplates suicide with the gun she is packing in her purse while smoking cigarettes in her hospital room. My how things have changed.

Never fear, a woman with stereotypical sunglasses and a trench coat (Franca Parisi) shows up and offers her help through Professor Alberto Levin (Alberto Lupo) who has a machine that goes ping, an oscilloscope, a centrifuge, and a ""radiation chamber"" that could be an early microwave oven. His new product Derma 28 he wants to use on a human guinea pig, hence the stripper with the deformed face, one that he instantly falls in love with to the dismay of his assistant.

The professor uses the substance and it turns him into more of a hideous Mr. Hyde, than a vampire. I think ""Atom Age Mr. Hyde at Times"" wouldn't sell as well as the vampire thing. They could of at least gave him a long teeth. The make-up was pretty bad. It must have been stuff left over from our Lend-Lease program.

Not much in character build-up. Acting and script were pretty sad. Might have some film history interest as a vampire film worse than anything with Kristen Stewart in it. Just kidding Kristen, I really did like how you played a dead chick in that Snow White thing you otherwise ruined.",1368921600,2,1690,4.642140468227424
1653724,4,B00005R87N,"Zombies of the 40's and 50's are kind of like the early Klingons of Star Trek.  Not a bit like the zombies of today.  These guys are just stiff sloughing guys who walk like they hypnotized instead of dead guys brought back to life.  Of course, it's never really clear whether they are zombies or not, anyway.  The plot revolves around two white guys and a black guy who crash on an island somewhere in the Atlantic.  You get this from the references early in the movie although it is never established where the island is.

The humor is relentless, especially with the manservant ""Jeff"" played by Mantan Moreland.  If you've seen some of these movies with the wide-eyed overly frightened stereotypical black man before you know what I mean.  Unless you come into this movie with an open mind as to the way the typical black man was portrayed in those days you are apt to find it offensive.  But keep in mind that at least it IS a black man and not some white guy in black face.

I don't know if all of it was intended to be as funny as it is, but it will give you a few laughs.  Henry Victor as the villain (must not have been able to get Bela Lugosi or Boris Karloff on their budget, or maybe they thought the script was too ridiculous.)

Once you get through with the movie, you can take it and use it as a coaster, but you still have a T-shirt.  Like some of the others I've reviewed in this collection, it's mainly that T-shirt that makes the price of admission worth ponying up.",1364688000,,1483,4.272401433691757

1653726,1,B00005R87N,"Released to American audiences in 1961 as ATOM AGE VAMPIRE, this film is actually a 1960 Italian bomb originally named SEDDOCK, L'EREDE DI SATANA, and it follows in the twenty-year-old footsteps of Bela Lugosi's THE CORPSE VANISHES--and no doubt numerous others.

In essence: Jeanette is a beautiful stripper who has been disfigured in a car crash; mad scientist Prof. Alberto Levin becomes obsessed with restoring her beauty, even if means killing innocent women to supply the necessary glandular treatments. The film has nothing to do with vampires, and with the exception of Sergio Fantoni, reduced here to playing the role of the mad doctor's mute assistant, the cast is largely no-name. Director Anton Giulion Majano did manage a few mildly notable films, but was largely confined to the wasteland of Italian television, and he manages to wring nothing new out of a bad (and badly dubbed) script.

Now and then you come across a movie that is so bad it is fascinating--or which manages to be goofy, loveable, or watchable in some way. Such are rare: most bad movies are simply bad, and ATOM AGE VAMPIRE is no exception. It isn't worth the time you'll spend watching it.

Admittebly,for that cover alone worth the small sum you pay.

What this is really,is Mill Creek entertainment rereleasing some of there films from there 50 DVD sets unto a smaller twenty pack.
For people who've already got em,this isn't much,but for the uninitiated,this might be kind of cool.

The set really dosen't cater to Vampire and Living Dead films.
There's ALOT of weird stuff on here.

Here's the contents and there worth:

Atom Age Vampire(1963)-One of those Spanish made horror films re-edited for American audiences.
Not really that exciting,and rather boring.
Great title,though.

Count Dracula and his Vampire Bride(1973)-This is actually the frequently released ""Satanic Rites of Dracula"" under a different title.
It was the last of the Hammer Draculas with Christopher Lee.
He dosen't have much to do in this,as the plot revolves around a James Bond like plot of a agent trying to undermine the plans of a crazed millionaire who plans to unleash the bubonic plague upon the earth!
Peter Cushing is back as Van Helsing,and thank god he is.
Not a great film,but worth seeing for Cushing and Lee.
And the basement of chained up,topless vampire girls!

Crypt of the Living Dead(1973)-Mill Creek loves to release this one.
Originally shown in color,this is featured in black and white(?) and is a rather alright vampire film.

The Devil Bat(1940)-This is always mistaken as a vampire film because of the presence of Bela Lugosi.
He actually plays a chemist enacting revenge by sending out giant bats to kill his enemies!
Campy fun for the B-horror movie fan.

Horror of the Zombies(1974)-Actually a U.S retitling of one of the Blind Dead series.
This one is set on a boat,with the typica; creepy atmosphere,chanting and downbeat ending.

House of the Dead(1972)-Another Mill Creek favorite,this one seems to appear on every other set.
So-So horror anthology,nothing special.

King of the Zombies(1940)-Hilarious horror film about men who crashland on an island where a german zombie master plans to use zombies for the Axis powers.
Ridiculous,but saved by the great comic performance of Mantan Moreland.
Some may see his performance as offensive,but Moreland was a genuinely,talented comedian and is the real reason to watch this film today.

The Last man on Earth(1964)-The first film version of Richard Matheson's ""I am legend"" and a big influence on George Romero's Night of the Living dead.
This italian production stars Vincent Price as the last man on earth,who is trying to seek a cure for the virus that obliterated mankind while killing off vampires!
Not the best print,but a must see horror movie.

Mama Dracula(1980)-TERRIBLE  horror comedy with Louise Fletcher.
Painfully unfunny. That's all I can say.

Moon of the Wolf(1972)-Okay Tv-werewolf movie structured as a who done it.
Problem is that it's VERY obvious who the werewolf is,and the wolf man make up kind of sucks.
Still it's good,clean fun.

Night of the Living Dead(1968)-One of the greatest horror movies of all time and the most popular public domain horror release.
If you don't have it.....seriously,who dosen't?

Nosferatu(1922)-Silent masterpiece in sub-par print.
Only reccomended if you haven't seen it,otherwise get the Kino Dvd.

Oasis of the Zombies(1980)-One of the many Italian zombie movies made in the early 80s,and one of the many with a nazi sub-plot(!).
Cheezy and rather boring,this does feature sme striking shots of zombies against the sun walking across the sand dunes to reccomend it.

Revolt of the Zombies(1936)-One of the only bombs from the Golden age of Horror,was made by the Halperin brothers to cash in on there previous success with White Zombie(1932).
Except,there's no Bela Lugosi(his eyes are used superimposed over zombie soldiers though!).
The plot could have been good,a story about a guy training zombies for war,but it turns to tedium quickly.

The Vampire Bat(1933)-Not about vampires,but starring Lionel Atwill as a mad doctor who has created a sponge like creature that lives on blood!
Of interest to classic horror fans for the cast,including Melvyn Douglas as the hero,Fay Wray as the heroine and Dwight Frye playing another looney like he did in Dracula(1931).
The sets from Frankenstein are also re-used.
Not bad stuff.

Vengeance of the Zombies(1973)-Paul Naschy horror movie with Nashcy playing duel roles of kind Guru and evil demon guy who unleashes zombies on his enemies.
Features the typical Naschy film mixture of blood and naked women.
Harmless fun.

Voodoo Black Exorcist(1973)-GREAT TITLE!
The film has NOTHING to do with that title,though.
Basically it's your average Mummy movie,with him loose on an ocean liner.
Lots of babes and a gruesome monster make up to reccomend it.

Werewolf in a Girl's Dormitory(1964)-Fun idea,but not as tongue in cheek as one might assume.
Lots of pretty co-eds,a REALLY lame wolf man,and it's missing the ""Ghoul in School"" song from the main title!
Oh man!

Werewolf vs.the Vampire Woman(1970)-Another in Paul Naschy's Waldemar Dansky series,finds him battling an undead vampire countess.
Alot of the blood and nudity were cut from this print.
Uncut print is under the title,""Werewolf Shadow"".

White Zombie(1932)-The first zombie movie and one of the best.
Bela Lugosi gives one of his bets performances as Murder Legendre,a zombie master in Haiti who drugs a young woman to use as a zombie slave.
Not one of the best prints,that's for sure,but an essential if you haven't seen it yet.

Fun Dvd set if you can get it for under ten dollars.
Not the worst,and certainly with some interesting titles.
It's alright.",1227225600,,5664,5.157205240174672
1653748,4,B00005R87N,"I wasn't quite sure what to make of this movie by the title and actor list.  Don't let the title fool you into thinking this is a movie along the lines of Night of the Living Dead, it isn't.  This is really a light-hearted, comedy-mystery-thriller, along the lines of The Ghost Breakers, or as mentioned by another reviewer Spooks Run Wild, which happens to also have been produced by the same studio, Monogram.

King of the Zombies is a true ""B"" movie with a great supporting cast.  Mantan Moreland is responsible for the comedy element throughout the movie and does a great job.  This was my first introduction to him and I am looking forward to seeing more of his movies.

As the movie runs just over an hour, it moves at a comfortable pace. A group of three men, in search of a missing plane flown by an important military officer, crash land on an island.  The island appears to be deserted except for a mansion inhabited by a mad doctor and an odd group of servants, including Zombies.  The doctor has no knowledge of the missing plane, or so he says, but is willing to put the men up until they can be rescued.  They become suspicious of the doctor and their snooping reveals many secrets.  Though the ending is relatively uneventful, it really is the path of the story that makes this movie so enjoyable.

As with many of the Monogram pictures, there is a bit of propaganda sprinkled throughout.  For example, the enemy ends up being the Germans.  It is also interesting to consider the way that other races were once viewed and treated.  The movie allows us a window to our past.",1211241600,2,1588,4.487804878048781

1653766,3,B00005R87N,"Made just as the US entered the second world war, this goofy zombie horror comedy is breezy fun throughout its 67 minute running time.  Some US agents and their servant crash their plane on a creepy, remote island.  They find a shadow mansion populated by a staid German doctor, his staff, and his wife, who is said to be afflicted with an illness leaving her in a trance-like state.  First the servants give hints that voodoo practices have resulted in many zombies on the island, and it isn't long before Mantan Moreland, the aide to the agents, finds himself amusingly unable to convince his employers that dark mischief abounds, possibly rooted in the workings of the mysterious German.  Mantan Moreland steals the proceedings as the constant scaredy cat, though his role is far from PC and is rooted in servant stereotypes.  He is partly redeemed by being the only character to show some common sense, let alone some acting charisma; most of the other performances are fairly stiff, and I'm not counting the zombies!  Lots of fun to be had in details such a the zombies having to be on a special low-salt diet, Moreland's crisis of whether he himself is a zombie or merely hypnotized, and... are those voodoo drums or Gene Krupa?

Typical dialogue:

""I've seen em with my own eyes!""
""He seems to be troubled with hallucinations""
""No sir, zombies. That's what I'm troubled with.""

Or

""You're not a zombie. Zombies can't talk""
""Can I help it because I'm loquacious?""

The film drags some towards the end when there is less comic relief and more focus on to tying up plot threads, but compared to many of the supernatural films of its day (and much later), this is still watchable as it knows when not to take itself too seriously.",1206921600,,1734,4.68976897689769

Unfortunately this transfer of the film print to DVD is the worst that I have ever seen, and Im not referring to the scratches, dust or spots on the print that was used, this actually adds to the vintage feel of the film.  The problem with this DVD is that the frame of view has been cropped in on all sides so any scene where the actors head is close to or at the edge of the original frame gets there head cut off down to the nose or mouth and this is through the whole film not one or two scenes.

1653770,3,B00005R87N,"This movie appears to be an attempt to capitalize on every possible contemporary issue and popular subject of the late 1930's and early 1940's.  There are spies, Nazis, zombies and an African American comedian thrown in for good measure.  I would say the director threw in everything but the kitchen sink, but there was one of those too.  The primary plot is generally dull and lifeless, but the comedy in this movie is classic.

Our story begins with three people in an airplane lost over the ocean.  They desperately scan for a radio beacon to find an airport, finding instead a suspicious radio conversation.  The trio, James ""Mac"" McCarthy (Dick Purcell, who managed 74 film appearances before his untimely death in 1944), his servant Jefferson ""Jeff"" Jackson (comedian Mantan Moreland, who is one of the best things about this movie; Moreland became a regular in the Charlie Chan movies of the 1940's), and pilot Bill Summers (John Archer, who was near the beginning of a career that would eventually span 60 years) crash onto the island and discover suspicious happenings.

We soon learn that an admiral is missing, and that can only mean one thing.  Yep, you got it; the admiral has to be on the island somewhere.  The local guy in power appears to be Dr. Miklos Sangre (Henry Victor, who appeared in many spy movies as well as the cult classic ""Freaks"").  He has assorted house guests, including a bevy of genuine zombies.  We also learn that Dr. Sangre is attempting to use voodoo to gain the secrets of the admiral.

Most of this movie was bizarre.  I kept wondering why the various characters did the things they did.  The one thing that made this movie survivable was the antics of Mantan Moreland and beautiful Marguerite Whitten as Samantha the maid.  Both actors were far superior to any of the other actors in this movie.  Moreland's style of comedy may seem to step too closely to the degrading stereotypes of the era, but it was also evident that servant Jeff Jackson and maid Samantha were the only two characters who knew what was really going on and were the only characters smart enough to stay out of the way of trouble.  Moreland's lead in taking the zombies to dinner is easily the best part of this movie and that scene showcased the talents of both performers.

My first impression of this movie is that it tried to squeeze too many subplots into its short length.  We have Nazis, zombies, a missing admiral, a love story, a crash and more.  The director avoided the problem caused by having a lot of plots by spending very little time on developing any of the plots.  I thought this movie was about the missing admiral, but the movie seemed to wander around for a while and the missing admiral got very little face time until near the end of the movie.  Even after watching the movie the most memorable portions were those featuring Moreland and Whitten.  My general impression is that this movie is a comedy that also has some stuff about zombies and an admiral in it.  At least, that is the way I am going to remember the movie.

I could easily dismiss this movie as worthless, and it nearly is.  However, all the scenes with Moreland and Whitten were enjoyable.  Whitten was a wonderfully smooth actress who commanded her role.  Moreland is a natural comedian whose presence made him the focus of every scene he was in.  This movie is rare in that African American performers were the lead characters in several scenes though Caucasian performers were the nominal stars of the movie.  I recommend this movie for the presence of these two stars.  However, be aware that much of the humor in this movie would be considered unacceptable by today's standards.

Before I forget, the title of this movie borders on the absurd.  Dr. Sangre was a Nazi experimenting with hypnosis and voodoo.  He was far from the ""King of the Zombies.""  Sometimes movie titles are more impressive than the movies themselves.

1653797,3,B00005R87N,"There's something we need to clear up here at the very start.  Despite the title, there are no vampires in this movie.  No, the monster you'll find here (and I'm using the term monster rather loosely) is something else entirely, a sort of really ugly Mr. Hyde who is compared to ""a vampire of the atomic age.""  Don't go in looking for a lot of atomic whatsits either, as you won't see anything much beyond the technology of the vaunted machine that goes ping - oh, and radiation is apparently just white smoke that can't harm you, by the way.

With the preliminaries out of the way, let's talk about the story.  You've got this stripper named Jeanette (and, sadly, I only know she's a stripper because the film tells me so) who gets dumped by her boyfriend Pierre, reacts rather hysterically, and ends up driving her car over a cliff.  She's left horribly disfigured (even though it's really not that bad at all), which really bums her out.  That's when this stranger named Monique shows up in her room, telling Jeanette all about her colleague Professor Levin and the miraculous work he is doing with cell regeneration.  It's all hush-hush, though, so Jeanette has to sort of sneak over there after she is released.  Well, the doctor does his thing, and his super-duper Derma-28 works wonders.  Naturally, Doc falls madly in love with the girl, which causes problems of its own sort.  Even worse, the miracle cure doesn't seem to be permanent - and Doc is all out of Derma-28.  He could get what he needs from a living specimen, of course, but the donor would probably not live to tell about it.  Hmmm.  You see where this is going, don't you?  Doc will do anything to cure the woman he loves - anything.  That's where your monster bit comes in.  There hardly seems to be a point to the whole monster business, if you ask me, but what are you gonna do?

The main problem with this film is the fact that it seems to have passed through the hands of several snip-happy editors on its way from Italy to America.  The Italian original (Seddok, l'erede di Satana) is some 18 minutes longer than the standard American print (although I think the version I saw was even shorter than that) - this is a good time for me to point out that I'm reviewing the movie, not the DVD (thus, I can't tell you for sure just how long the DVD print runs).  However you slice it, though, this is just your basic 1960 sci-fi/horror film.  There are a couple of nice transformation scenes, the first half of the film fares reasonably well, and Mario Bava had a hand in the production, but the bad pretty much balances out the good.  The dubbing isn't all that great, the over-acting of several characters would be obvious in any language, and the whole story is a little less than original.  Despite its faults, though, it's still entertaining enough to be worth a look.  Just remember - it's not a vampire film at all, no matter what the title says.",1137024000,10,2926,4.487712665406427
1653798,2,B00005R87N,"I also got this movie as part of a 50 horror movie set. I think that 50 cents was about the right price for this awful movie. The only reference to anything atomic is the display of some rather unfortunate photographs of Japanese atomic bomb victims. The ""vampire"" part is just..just..well, wrong. I think something was lost in the translation from Italian. The story is about a mad scientist in his basement with a formula that can revive disfigured flesh. He wants a human subject on which to test his discovery, and his devoted, romantically frustrated assistant will not do. So in her role as a classic enabler, the assistant goes out an ""procures"" a disfigured stripper for him. Of course, the doc falls in love with the stripper, much to the consernation of the assistant, the stripper's boyfriend, and the hapless young ladies wandering in the night who become ingredients in his evil potion.

As an example of what you're in for with this, our mad, love obsessed doctor transforms himself into a monster in order to kill women for their adrenal glads to keep the object of his desire in flawless physical condition. When he is a ""monster"", he wears what looks like a ""barf"" mask over his head. However, the mask was so cheaply made that the mouth does not move when he talks. We're talkin' quality, here. The transfer was poor, but I attribute that to the fact that I shelled out 4 bits apiece for these classics. My recommendation? If you can find this for what I paid, I say add it to your collection.

1653800,4,B00005R87N,"During WWII, a Govt, Agent Bill summers (John Archer) is searching for an admiral whose plan went down somewhere in the Caribbean. He's accompanied by the search plane pilot ""Mac"" (Dick Purcell) and his servant Jeff Jackson(Mantan Moreland).

While searching, their own plane goes down and crashes into a cemetary on an island. They are taken into the residence by Dutch Dr. Sangre who claims to have fled there from the Nazis. He's accompanied by his wife who walks around in a trance-like state.

Not only that, but there's several black zombies skulking about the creepy house that only Jeff ever seems to encounter. It's soon revealed that Dr. Sangre is a nazi conspirator who has the Admiral captured and is using a voodoo priestess to try and get sensitive military info out of him.

Along the way Jeff get's ""Zombie-fied"" by the doctor in the movie's funniest bit. This film really seemed to be a vehicle for Lugosi in the role of the mad doctor Sangre but Henry Victor does an admirable job.

Mantan steals the show with his one-liners and really brings some life to the film. Purcell is ok as the pilot but Archer is REALLY wooden as the would-be hero.

Yes it is a bit racially stereotyped as Jeff his told that he cannot stay in a guest room and must instead stay with the other black servants. But instead of running it down lets rememeber the era that the film was made in. No one should much feel sorry for Mantan Moreland as he steals virtually every scene he's in.

1653803,2,B00005R87N,"Although I am not a fan of vintage horror films I purchased KING OF THE ZOMBIES because of a very favorable review in a German movie magazine.
The plot has an US secret agent, a pilot and their black servant crashland on a small Caribbean island. It turns out that the island is ruled by a German expatriot, who has kidnapped an American general and uses black magic Voodoo Mumbo Jumbo to get some military secrets out of the unfortunate high ranking officer. Of course the zombies of the title are not the flesh-eating ghouls of today's splatter films, but the living dead of Voodoo magic, will-less slaves of the Nazi, who uses them for his sinister plans. Will our heroes succeed in thwarting the Nazi's evil plan? Well, I do not want to give it away, so watch for yourself...
Despite the unusual storyline involving espionage, a sinister Nazi, Voodoo and zombies, I found KING OF THE ZOMBIES rather dull and talky. (I am aware that fans of vintage horror will have a different view and likely rate it higher than I did.)
Despite the brief running time of a little over an hour it drags in places. However black actor Mantan MORLAND was fun and his many funny lines will make you laugh throughout. While I am usually not into comedy, I found his performance a real joy to behold. Be aware that KING OF THE ZOMBIES shows his age. This is evident not only in the choice of the baddie as a German (owing to the propagandistic needs of the time), but also in a few of MORLAND's jokes, which are of a racial nature (like commenting his appearance, when he looks into a mirror, ""the tropics sure gives a man a colour""). Don't watch, if you dislike such jokes. However there is no doubt that MORLAND was a great actor. Were it not for him, this film would have been a complete waste of my time. I also liked actor Victor HENRY, who played the baddie. As usual in these films the heroes are bland and boring.
The DVD is a bare-bones release, with no extras whatsoever. And don't expect picture quality to be as good as of a recent blockbuster movie. This is only natural given the film's age.",1078185600,6,2087,4.4375

- His shaky valet Jefferson: ""I don't know, but it ain't Gene Krupa.""

While enroute to the Bahamas, a plane plows into a storm and is blown off course. Now somewhere over Cuba or maybe Puerto Rico, in the same region where an admiral vanished a week ago, and having lost contact with the radio beam, the three on board crash land onto a remote island. They brush themselves off - pilot James McCarthy (Dick Purcell) and his two passengers, Bill Summers (John Archer) and his nervous valet Jefferson (Mantan Moreland) - and take a stroll, eventually coming upon a spooky mansion nestled in the dense jungle. It's at this stage that the Old Dark House vibe starts sneaking in.

There's the sinister host, Dr. Sangre (Henry Victor), and if you know even a smidge of Spanish, you've sussed out that his name brings up alarming connotations. The good doctor claims that he and his wife, Madame Sangre (Patricia Stacey), are Austrian refugees, and you observe Madame Sangre's perpetual state of stupor. You eyeball the unsavory servants: Momba (Leigh Whipper), the creepy butler who seems carved out of burnished dark mahogany, and Tahama (Madame Sul-Te-Wan), the dry-as-a-husk scullery hag what's constantly stirring a pot of strange brew.

The only two normal folks in residence seem to be the co1ored kitchen maid Samantha (Marguerite Whitten) and the Sangres' worried niece Barbara Winslow (Joan Woodbury).

The doctor politely invites the crash survivors to spend the night and other nights to follow at his spooky mansion, never mind that Jefferson, nervous valet, hysterically claims they've walked into a nest of zombies, these ""Dead folks who was too lazy to lay down."" Sangre dismisses Jeff's dither, although, conversely, he does make mention that ""They say evil spirits lurk here, waiting to prey on the injured."" So, yo, which is it?

3.5 out of 5 stars for 1941's KING OF THE ZOMBIES, a passable, breezy 68-minute-long horror comedy very much of its time. I found it droll and loads of fun. There's lots of creeping around by candlelight, and startling at creaky noises, and secret passageways gliding open and shut. It's an era in which the best remedy for nerves and everything else is a healthy slug of brandy. We're treated to the horror victim's time-honored clarion call: ""We better split up."" Mantan Moreland as Bill's chatty, panicky black valet does his best wide-eyed Willie Best impression and awesomely delivers some genuinely amusing one-liners, although, okay, his performance overall is nowadays considered politically incorrect. Just keep in mind, back in the day, this was how it was. Think of it as a historical snapshot of a bygone era. You can brush off the plot's McGuffin - that missing Admiral and some sensitive plans about key canal fortifications. Instead, sit back and enjoy the Old Dark House sensibilities. It's packed with action, as well, with square-jawed Bill Summers coming in solid as the dashing man of action (D!ck Purcell may have snagged the top billing but he's more of a sidekick here). The ""zombies"" - or ""perishable things,"" as someone refers to them - are composed of imposing island natives that look creepy in how they rigidly shamble along, tireless arms akimbo, eerily silent. The best scene, then, is when Jefferson believes he'd become one of the walking dead. He still can't stop yapping.",1483574400,,3446,4.975694444444445
