8689209,1,B00PUHEK3G,Complete waste of money. DO NOT buy this,1484179200,,40,4.125
8689210,1,B00PUHEK3G,"Behind the Mask was the dumbest unauthorized documentary ever. Up to our Necks was a little better. It was not worth the money I spent. I'm disappointed. ..... With that said. If I were a member of Slipknot, I wouldn't authorize these pieces of garbage either.",1456704000,,260,4.673913043478261
8689211,5,B00PUHEK3G,"Bought as a present for a big SLIPKNOT fan, he loved every minute. Worth getting and containing two DVDs in a nice box.",1451779200,,119,4.217391304347826
8689212,1,B00PUHEK3G,"This is the same as Maggots, rank outsiders, from here to eternity, and behind the mask. Just released w/ a different name and box. I was disappointed!!!!",1441584000,,154,4.7407407407407405
8689213,1,B00PUHEK3G,Thought this was a band video. Its mostly other people talking about the band and their hometown roots. Waste of money and waste of time. Don't make the mistake I did. Buy something different.,1433030400,,192,4.676470588235294
8689214,1,B00PUHEK3G,"This was a waste of money, it has nothing to do with them, no interviews with the band, all you get is pictures here and there, very dissapointed, DON'T BUY!, False Advertisement, whoever made this should refund everyone, i will never get Rekt like this again.",1426809600,,260,4.673913043478261
8689215,1,B00PUHEK3G,"As a huge slipknot fan starting before they even became the ledgens they are,i was seriously let down and cross about the money i wasted buying this product,dnt make the same mistake i did.",1424563200,,189,4.588235294117647
8689216,1,B00PUHEK3G,These are terrible. I already have both of these dvds. They have been repackaged for the new set. One of the new dvds says 2015 when I have the exact same one that says 2002. What a rip off. They suck anyway so don't waste your money,1424304000,,233,3.978723404255319
8689217,1,B00PUHEK3G,"Giving it one star for a few different reasons... The description doesnt tell you that neither of the two dvd documentaries are created with slipknot's permission. What they also don't tell you in the description is that these are over 10 years apart, one is made in 2004, and one is made apparently this year, which maybe it's just me but I was under the impression that this was a complete brand new 2 dvd documentary when it's actually 2 separate. Basically to sum it up, I could've saved the 20 bucks and watched these on youtube, I know for a fact I've actually seen one on there already.",1424217600,2,593,4.4495412844036695
8689218,1,B00PUHEK3G,"Absolutely terrible.  Says on the back which they do not show you, that ""This film is not authorized by Slipknot, Their record label or management.""  That would have been nice to know.  It contains two unauthorized documentaries.  No performance or interviews with the band at all.  I cannot begin to explain how bad they are.  If you are a Slipknot fan, please avoid.",1423958400,2,368,4.761904761904762
