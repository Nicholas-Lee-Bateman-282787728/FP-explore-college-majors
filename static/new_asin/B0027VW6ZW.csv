3869792,4,B0027VW6ZW,"The edition viewed is the one from PRStudios.  Amazon should have noted that this is a DVD-R.  This is a great production of a very timely story, although the DVD quality leaves much to be desired.  I've seen much better kinescopes than this.  1984 was late coming, but has really picked up the last few months.  The novel should be required reading in all schools.",1269561600,6,365,4.553846153846154
3869793,3,B0027VW6ZW,"Follows the book, kind of.  The 1984 version with Hurt and Burton is the best representation, but this one isn't bad.",1265587200,3,117,4.571428571428571
3869794,2,B0027VW6ZW,"There is no mention in the description of this item that this is a DVD-R, *NOT* a properly pressed DVD, and the quality of the video and audio is very poor.  I agree that this version of ""1984"" with Peter Cushing and produced by the BBC in 1954 is the best ever produced, with stark performances and the most chilling portrayal of a totalitarian government I've seen.  But this DVD is obviously a bootleg import, and for Amazon to be selling it with no mention of its true nature is deceptive at best.  There are numerous video artifacts: pixellation in the video as well as innumerable specks, lines, and a constant flickering.  This identical release has been duplicated on two other Amazon products: B0025ZIG8Q and B002KECK1G - all of which are of the same poor quality.  If you haven't seen this version, it's worth going to YouTube and watching there, but this DVD-R is not worth what they're asking.",1263945600,60,905,4.666666666666667
3869795,5,B0027VW6ZW,"This 1954 BBC production is amazing to watch.  Orwell's tale of a futuristic society actually caused a great deal of controversy when it first aired due to the scenes of torture, most of which is implied rather than shown.  Peter Cushing's portrayal of Winston Smith may just be his best work, his performance carries the story. The rest of the cast is also good, though only Andre Morell and Donald Pleasance are known to American viewers.  Morell is much better here than he was as Watson in Hammer's ""Hound of the Baskervilles"", while Pleasance has less to do before his character no longer exists.  The black and white photography helps to convey the dreary atmosphere necessary to the story.  It starts out slow, but soon draws the viewer into the story and refuses to let go until the credits roll.",1261785600,8,804,4.714285714285714
3869796,5,B0027VW6ZW,"This is the first recording of 1984 on film, made for the BBC in the 1950's, a brilliant set of performances, with sinister overtones for today's emerging information centered ploice states, or as one might say 1984 by stealth. Peter Cushing plays a great part, the settings are dark and the feeling of hopelessness and yet immense course and human fortitude. The ideas are derived from Stalin's pathological police state which like no other devoured its own's children, Goya perfectly captured the essence of this over 100 years earlier in his portrayal of Saturnus devouring his chidren. The film quality is not so good, but I think we are very lucky it survived so I for one would never complain. Buy it its very cheap and read the book and animal farm.",1254441600,9,756,4.734848484848484
3869797,5,B0027VW6ZW,"Probably one of the best renditions of the story based on a book ""1984"" written by George Orwell.

Basic story:
In a society that has eliminated many imbalances, surplus goods, and even class struggle, there are bound to be deviates; Winston Smith is one of those.  He starts out, due to his inability to doublethink, with thoughtcrime. This is in a society that believes a thought is as real as the deed. Eventually he graduates through a series of misdemeanors to illicit sex and even plans to overthrow the very government that took him in as an orphan.

If he gets caught, he will be sent to the ""Ministry of Love"" where they have a record of 100% cures for this sort of insanity.  They will even forgive his past indiscretions.

Peter Cushing, a veteran actor, plays Winston smith. The film is in black and white. There are clips of this film in other 1984 documentaries. Copies are hard to find. With any luck, this fill will show-up on a Criterion DVD.

3869798,5,B0027VW6ZW,"This is a rare treat. Peter Cushing starring as our hero facing a cold heartless goverment of the future, where ""Big Brother"" monitors your every movment. In this world of tomorrow, independent thought is a crime, and the dictionary is being ever revised as to curtail thought, a jargon called 'new-speak'. When you watch this version, it not only holds up well, but the metaphors that can be seen in the ills of present and past social structures can be seen. Peter Cushing is great as always. A young, although still bald, Donald Pleasance of ""Halloween"" and ""Fantastic Voyage"" fame is also part of the cast! All in all, this early BBC TV work is a must for fans of the famous novel or sci-fi fans.",1241049600,10,700,4.563492063492063

3869826,4,B0027VW6ZW,"Not as harrowing as the theatrical motion picture adaptation of George Orwell's ""1984"" that was actually made in the year 1984 (starrgin William Hurt, Suzanna Hamilton, and the late, great Sir Richard Burton in his last role), but a decent adaptation, given the limitations of live 1950s TV. From a historical nostalgia standpoint, it's fascinating to see Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance in their younger days.",1369699200,3,413,5.2727272727272725
3869827,5,B0027VW6ZW,"I've seen the color version of ""1984"" with John Hurt & Richard Burton, and this B/W version is just as good as the color version with Hurt & Burton.

Peter Cushing is Winston who lives in a totalitarian system in 1984, dominated by ""Big Brother"", where even the thoughts of people are controlled by the government.

There are some minor flaws with the visual playback, but other than that, it's very good.",1308096000,6,405,4.611111111111111
3869828,5,B0027VW6ZW,"1984, the classical 1954 BBC television version is full of great stars and wonderful images.  They do a great job of following the story and trying to keep the feel of the novel.  Peter Cushing plays Winston Smith and of course can be seen in such great films as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-Episode-IV-A-New-Hope-1977-2004-Versions-2-Disc-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000FQJAIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope (1977 & 2004 Versions, 2-Disc Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;and he is also known to me as the big screen Dr. Who as in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Doctor-Who-Collection/dp/B00005OCK9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Doctor Who Collection</a>.  His thin, tired looking body and his skills as an actor make him a perfect Smith.  Andre Morell who played O'Brien is also known for playing Professor Bernard Quatermass in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quatermass-And-The-Pit/dp/B000X0TVUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quatermass And The Pit</a>.  Of course, this version was adapted for the BBC by Nigel Kneale, who invented Quatermass.  Andre's manners, his calm demeanor, his appearance all screams power.  Wonderful!  Yvonne Mitchell is lovely to look at and seems to be a good actress.  Her down fall is made all the more terrible in the end by the change in her appearance - she goes from pretty to ugly.  I thought they had replaced her!  Donald Pleasence who plays Syme in this version also plays Parsons in the later version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1984/dp/B0001H6D5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1984</a>&nbsp;and does a wonderful job of being a loyal party member who, frankly, knows just a little too much on how the system works.  Campbell Gray who plays Parsons in this version is perfect for the part.  Kind of reminds me of Aubrey Morris but they are two different people.
If you are a fan of the BBC or 1984, get this DVD.",1275350400,15,2066,6.4963503649635035

the horror of big brother and govt takeover and now with the technology available most young adults and kids are brainwashed by the left
propaganda and don't see the truth and how much their freedom and thinking is being taken away. As a big fan collector of classic horror
and sci fi and Peter Cushing I had to have this even though the quality is not great it's such a great version of 1984 and as one said anyone
with a brain this is quite terrifying without blood and gore and the usual scare tatics by TV and Movies today. Cushing's performance is
brilliant as the only one who seems to see the truth and dangers of living in a world controlled by big brother. This is happening now and
hopefully most will be smart enough to vote the right way not the left way! I highly recommend this movie to every american and their kids
and young adults and any movie documentary about WWII and the nazis and their propaganda and control over their own people. a must have.",1475366400,,1107,4.326923076923077

Both serve as a warning that the dangers of totalitarianism is alive and well and the consequences for humanity devastating.  A good companion book for college age young people would be Christopher Hitchens work  ""Why Orwell Still Matters.""  Language and thought are the most fundamental defenses of human freedom and human rights. Hitchens makes a strong case in favor of resisting current trends in political speech and thought.",1470873600,5,554,5.054945054945055
