OMG the songs are so catchy and the Nat Geo film footage of the animals is second to none, the high quality production and of course, Dudley Moore as ""spin"" who takes the children around the world as the Earth to see the animals is entertaining. I highly recommend this to anyone who has a child who loves animals and songs.",1363046400,,405,4.2727272727272725
