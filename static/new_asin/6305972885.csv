1110888,4,6305972885,"I'm a big fan of Paul Verhoeven's American movies.  Once I moved to Holland, I thought I'd check out his older Dutch movies.  I found an English-subtitled version through Amazon.com and I wasn't dissappointed.  It is one hell of a war movie.  One of the best I've seen.  It was pretty cool to see Rutger Hauer acting in his native Dutch language before he went off to Hollywood as well.  Another recognizeable actor, Jeroen Krabbe, is in this too.
I didn't even mind reading subtitles through almost the whole movie(some parts of it are in English).
If you like war movies, check this out.  If you like Paul Verhoeven's weird sense of humor, check it out too.",997920000,4,659,4.581196581196581
1110889,3,6305972885,"I first saw ""Soldier of Orange"" in the early '80s and remembered it as a well-made, intelligent war/action film. I looked forward to seeing it again, both to see if my memory was justified and to answer a question that had been nagging me for several years. Nothing about my memory of the film suggested much similarity to the subsequent work of its director, Paul Verhoeven. So I was curious to see what, if anything, looked forward to his other films.
That question was answered in the first sequence, as the protagonist, Eric (Rutger Hauer) is initiated into the boyish antics of university life. As punishment for trying to shirk the hazing, Eric's future friend Gus (Jeroen Krabbe) smashes a bowl of soup over his head. As Eric falls to the floor unconscious, the blood, noodles and broth mingle in a mess on the floor. This combined carnality and violence is Verhoeven's signature, and while the film doesn't have as much sex as some of the director's later work, it otherwise is in keeping with his almost obsessive fixation on sensuality.
Still, the DVD was vaguely disappointing, partly because the transfer is rather dark. More fundamentally, while ""Soldier"" is indeed intelligent, it may be too sophisticated for its own good. We get a believably broad look at the range of reactions among the Dutch to the Nazi occupation, from resistance, to acquiescence, to active collaboration. Far from the flawless heroes of Hollywood, Eric, Gus and their friends are frail, fearful, heroic almost by accident. The problem is, these Realistically drawn characters do not make very compelling centers for an epic. We may sympathize, even recognize a bit of ourselves, but it's hard to get excited by action caused as much by the characters' blunders as by their intentions.
Yet despite these Realistic details, the characters drop in and out of the story so frequently it's difficult to recognize who they are. This fragmentation of the relationships may be necessary to preserve the forward movement of the action, but the result is neither a compelling war drama, nor an insightful exploration of character. Only Gus and Eric are portrayed in any depth, but that doesn't help either, since they are marked as much by their posing and vacillation as by their heroism.
The film moves quickly, and despite the messiness of the story, no one will be bored by it. You are equally unlikely, however, to be very satisfied by it. In the last scene, one of the other characters says to Eric about his wartime experiences ""I survived."" (I'm not giving anything away, here, incidentally, since the film starts in flashback.) That comment summarizes the film's interests and limitations. ""Soldier of Orange"" is ultimately not about Idealistic Heroes proving themselves but the grubby realities of getting on in an ugly situation. Interesting, perhaps, but not an epic.",989712000,17,2858,4.9937106918239
1110890,5,6305972885,"This film is an absolute Dutch classic! It is about a group of Dutch students who meet at their fraternity initiation in 1938 in Leiden. We follow them from the tense pre-war days to the end of WWII. They take a photo of their group just before the war starts. From there they drift in different directions. Erik Lanshof gets involved in the resistance, while Alex decides to join the Waffen SS. It tells the universal story of courage and betrayal. One of the most dramatic moments for me was at the end of the movie when they show the pre-war photo of all friends, knowing what had happened to all of them. Every time it leaves me with a feeling of great sadness about the suffering that the war has brought. Arguably the best scene is where Erik enters occupied Holland and ends up in the middle of a German drinking party. To his surprise he finds Alex there and they dance a most remarkable Tango. My grandmothers both experienced life in occupied Holland and I heard from them first hand stories about betrayal and abuse of power. I can only imagine by watching this movie what it must have been like.

It takes place in Holland just before the Nazis invade and take over and it about a group  of friends and the paths they take. Most work for the Dutch resistance, one  goes to the Nazis and becomes an SS officer. The hero / main character Eric  Lanshoff ( Rutger Hauer in a breakthrough performance ) goes through an  extraordinary transformation from frat boy pledge to resistance fighter, to  RAF bomber pilot to spy to bodyguard of the Queen of the Dutch House of  Orange ( thus the title ).

1110912,5,6305972885,"This is an epic tale of friends who live and die during the German occupation of Holland during World War II. This is not a feel-good movie, nor is it meant to be - instead, we have a group of people who are sent through the meat grinder and come out CHANGED. I am being purposefully vague, because the specific details would take too long to elaborate upon, and aren't exactly relevant.

War is going on, and Rutger Hauer's young man is the everyman who explores the different fields of battle from the streets of Amsterdam, across the North Sea, and into England, where he becomes a spy for the allied forces. His friends aren't so lucky. One is a traitor to his people recruited by the Nazis, one is a rebel whose world is going to hell, and another joins the German army and is shipped off to Russia.

This is a tale of innocence, friendship, and determination - and the loss of all three. It is especially amazing to observe the difference from start to finish, considering just how different these people are - how angry and vengeful, how demoralized and destitute, how apathetic and lifeless the war has made them.",1408320000,4,1121,4.517241379310345

AMAZON, you are misleading the customer by not providing enough information in the description. If this DVD cannot be played in a US DVD player, it should have been stated specifically in the description. I blame you for this vital omission.

1110934,5,6305972885,"This is Paul Verhoeven at his best, before he was Hollywoodized. It is a thoughtful, intelligent movie about the Nazi occupation of Holland, a grittily realistic film that shows the complications of war and occupation - the desire for self-survival, the limits of patriotism, the fragility of war-time romances, and the bravery and sacrifices that some, but not all, are willing to exhibit. The movie follows six students through the tragedies and moral uncertainties of occupied Holland. Nothing in this war is black and white, the choices are not easy and only two of the six survive to the end of the war. The deaths of the others run the gamut from heroic to tragic to shameful. Both the maturation of these young men from the naive students they were in the beginning and the grim consequences of the choices they are forced to make are brilliantly depicted. Unlike many war movies which concentrate on spectacle and explosions, this focuses on feelings - the realities of life in occupied Holland and the emotions of these six men.

This was a breakthrough film for Rutger Hauer as the central figure of the movie and he gives a beautifully nuanced performance. The growth of his character, Eric, from naive student to a man struggling with the horrors of the occupation to the seasoned soldier at the end sweeps the viewer along with him.

'Soldier Of Orange' is right up there with such classic war movies as Kubrick's 'Paths Of Glory', Fuller's 'The Big Red One' and Peckinpah's 'Cross Of Iron'.  Highly recommended!",1238803200,4,1525,4.857692307692307
1110935,5,6305972885,"So said the queen then and so it became.  This film is one of the great half dozen or so masterpieces of film from the 20th Century.  It's no secret that Mr. Hauer is considered the European ""James Dean"" of his generation and perhaps the most intelligent actor ever from Dutch Cinema.  The innovation and pure poetry of ""Orange"" from the insertion of Hauer into old newsreels, to the delicate embroidery of repetive music has been endlessly copied but never reproduced.  A great film has to have transcendant scenes and this is full of them.  My favorite is when the Jewish boxer is taken to the dunes to be shot and he stands above the dug grave waiting for the bullets and breathes in the last breath of salt air, sees the clouds scud across the Holland sky,and a flock of birds flies across the screen as if to show him the way.  This is a pure work of art, a seamless expression with no mistakes.",1200009600,4,900,4.391566265060241
1110936,5,6305972885,"The Netherlands (aka Holland) has not produced many movies that survived the onslaught of Hollywood productions in the cinemas. I grew up as a Surinamese youth in the Netherlands, from a Dutch father that was in Holland for most of WWII. He never talks about it unless I really prod and the stories and memories visibly shake him and others that talk about it. Memories of him as a 13 or 14 year old in the Hague when the Nazi's rounded up folks on a square in the city and eliminated them. Anyways, I am drifting of the topic... It would be good for newer generations to stop and listen to those around us that have lived through the war(s), any wars. It is life changing and affects their (and our) lives into our future and beyond.

Anyways, on Sep 29th of 2007 the Soldier of Oranje, Siebren Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema, died at age 90 in Hawaii. It is worthwhile to watch this film, based on his book of the same name.
This is his personal view and story of how he and his close friends lived through WWII and how it affected them all individually.

I watched this movie as a pre-teen in School and remember how brutal and undiscriminating this film takes you through the episode.
I am not really a fan of Verhoeven but think that the honest, bsic, naive  storytelling is very typical of Dutch films and leaves room for your own interpretation of the events.

Don't discard this move for it's lack of Hollywood grandeur but watch it as an autobiography of a very respected and heroic Dutch freedom fighter. This movie belong is a collection of A Bridge Too Far and Patton. Must have war movies with deeper meaning.

It still moves me after all these years and has held up well over time.

The story was a fine but not great story.  It follows some college frat buddies through the war years.  The various buddies take very different paths durring the war.  Some joined the German war effort, some had key roles in the resistance, and one simply continued on through his education with little notice of the war effort.

1110940,5,6305972885,"Winner of the Los Angeles Film Critics Award as Best Foreign Film in 1979, Soldier of Orange is based on the memoir of the same name by Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema, one of the founders of the Dutch Resistance, aide to Queen Wilmelmina during her exile in England, and RAF Pathfinder pilot in the last days of the war. Directed by Paul Verhoeven, the film dramatizes the traumatic effects of the Nazi occupation on Holland, and the often futile attempts to form a local Dutch Resistance.

Location scenes provide stunning realism--from the boisterous hazing of students in Leyden, where Hazelhoff (known in the film as Lanshof) was a law student, to the beach of Scheveningen, where Lanshof and his friends attempted to cross the Channel to England by small boat, and the streets of The Hague, where one of Lanshof's friends is seen late in the war.

Often said to be the best film ever made in Holland and the best film ever made by Paul Verhoeven, the film is also the best film ever made by Rutger Hauer, who plays the role of Lanshof with great panache. Jereoen Krabbe, playing his best friend, Guus LeJeune, is equally good in his role as a long-time friend from Leyden and hero of the Resistance. Focusing on these two men and four friends who react to the Occupation in different ways, the film brings to life the choices made by people in occupied Holland. Of the 144 who, like Lanshof and LeJeune, escaped and then made the decision to return to Holland to set up a Resistance, only 28 survived.

Beautifully photographed by Jost Vacano, the film gives a sense of the helplessness of Holland's small army against the Nazi juggernaut, the beauty of the countryside, and the victimization of the Dutch people as they faced subjugation.  Though the torture scenes are graphic and brutal, the film is so well done and so involving that one even forgets the film has subtitles.  Hazelhoff continues this story in his recent autobiography, In Pursuit of Life, which I strongly recommend, not only to fans of this film and the book which inspired it, but to anyone interested in fine writing and a fascinating life story.

Based on the life of Erik Haselhoff Roelfzema,  it chronicles his life in the resistance and that of  a small group of law students in Leiden, The Netherlands.  Verhoeven's commentary is worth the price of the DVD as he explains scene by scene what he tried to portray, while asking some very thought provoking questions.  Verhoeven and I are the same age, and both of us lived in Holland during the occupation.  His view of the conditions in Holland and the responses of the Dutch under occupation are very different. I also think his references to Das England Spiel are inaccurate.  Having said all that, I still consider the DVD one of my most favorite productions, including the film itself.  Soldaat van Oranje is my choice for best ever Dutch film.

Anyone that enjoys war movies will probably like it. If you enjoy the dramatic ones like ""Schindler's List"" and ""Das Boot"" you will definitely enjoy it. Although it is a bit long it did not seem long to me since the pace was good.

Anyway, the movie starts with a recording of queen Wilhelmina stepping out an airplane at the army airport ""Valkenburg"" (near Leiden) at the end of the WWII. She's accompanied by Eric Hazelhoff-Roelzema, adjudant to the queen and soldier of Orange. The movie tells the story of Eric Hazelhoff-Roelzema (Eric Lanshof in the movie). He studied law in Leiden and was in fact one of the last students to graduate at Leiden University during the second world war. He also was a member of the Dutch resistance. Eventhough the movie and the book he wrote about the war are not very similar, the situation and circumstances of the war in Holland are nicely shown.
In Leiden you can still see the room right accross the Academy Building, where Eric lived at the beginning of the war.

1110960,5,6305972885,"I first saw SOLDIER OF ORANGE several years ago and then rewatched it this week. My reaction to the film on the second viewing was very different. I've visited the Netherlands many times (my mother was Dutch descent) and have known for years Rotterdam was leveled by the Nazis. Since it has been completely rebuilt, the sadness of the WWII bombing for me until now has been that I could no longer visit the lovely old buildings that existed before the war. How shallow I have been.
I live 5 blocks from the Pentagon, and on Sept. 11 when I drove home from work, I saw first hand the aftermath of an act of war. (My husband saw the blast from his office window.) I have friends who were in NYC or the at the Pentagon on Sept. 11. My friend Mike was in NYC for a meeting and packing to return when he heard the first explosion. As the first tower fell, he ran like mad from the Marriott that used to be in the WTC complex. Mike was barefooted and cut his feet to pieces. I asked him why he did not slip on his shoes before he ran. He says he did not want to appear in public wearing loafers with no socks. As Mike ran body parts rained down on him. He is shaking and breaks down in tears everytime he talks about it, but his psychiatrist tells him to keep talking about it.
So, when I watched SOLDIER OF ORANGE last night, and I saw Rutger Hauer's reaction to seeing body parts and broken babbling people after a Nazi bombing, I understood how little I had known before Sept. 11 and that bravery is relative. Some people like Donald Rumsfield stay on the job and pull people out of the wreckage. Some people run like mad. Some hide until the dust clears. Not until terrible events occur do any of us know how we will react.
Verhoeven's rendering of SOLDIER OF ORANGE is brilliant. The story concept is straighforward--follow the experiences of an ordinary group of young Dutch men who are all friends at university, who over the course of the film experience the halcyon days of college life and the destruction of their homeland via war and its aftermath.
Verhoeven shows how each of these young men reacts to events beyond their control. These are ordinary men in extraordinary circumstances. A few of them do end up in uniform (opposing sides). One man cannot stand to see a Jew mistreated and he intervenes to his sorrow. Another has a German mother so he joins the Nazis. One is Jewish and must attempt an escape. Another hides out and continues his eductation, acquiring his degree behind closed doors. Another dies in a concentration camp. Yet another joins the RAF after a series of misadventures and becomes a hero.
Someone once said to me they thought Tom Hanks was miscast in Speilberg's RYAN, to which I replied, but he's just like my Uncle Paul who received a battlefield commission and a chest full of medals when he was the last man standing in a fight in southern France. Gentle Uncle Paul who went home to Illinois after the war, resumed his life as a printer and never did another bold thing.
I think this story is fabulous--an exploration of how real people behave during unreal times, which Verhoeven seems to understand. My DVD is excellent with vivid shots of the Netherlands and England twenty years ago when folks still rode bicycles. What a hoot to see a troop of soldiers on bikes!! (The film contains some hilarious scenes, even in war funny things happen.) The DVD contains a commentary with  Verhoeven and others similar to the CRITERION films.",1004745600,35,3471,4.492088607594937

I also hope you can help me get two copies that I can work with. I did a six week research job for Paul Verhoven in 1996 and a new copy of this film will be great!
