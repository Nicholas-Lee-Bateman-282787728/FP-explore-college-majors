Example: Gambatte mas!=I'm ready!
I rather like the version I'm used to, as in:
I, Kobato will do my very best!
Also, in the opening: I surprise myself
in how much I believe in tomorrow
My comfy version: I believe in my amazing future
One might be more accurate, but one definitely
Has the upper hand on elegance of phrase.",1379376000,,380,4.291666666666667
8451212,4,B0050I97BK,"If you're thinking about getting Kobato, chances are you're already a fan of the series and/or CLAMP and know what to expect from the story.  It's on the lighter side, along with Cardcaptor Sakura and WISH, rather than more intense works like X or Magic Knight Rayearth.  If you're unfamiliar with Kobato and are thinking about looking into the show, I recommend looking into the manga, now complete: there's are some things (jokes mostly) that the dvd, subtitled only, just doesn't translate that the manga takes the time to explain.  It's perfectly possible to enjoy the dvd and more importantly, the story, without the knowledge of these Japanese in-jokes.

The release itself is pretty bare: not a lot of work went into dressing the product up.  Everything from the dvd menus to the packaging is bare and simplistic.  What it comes down to is you're buying a dvd case, a kobato cover for the case, and two dvds (6 episodes each).  Like I said, the dvds are bare, with simple menus and not much in any kind of special feature... maybe a creditless opening/closing?  It seems like they put about as much work into the release as they thought it would sell, being something of a lighter niche title.

Still, despite everything, Kobato, is a fun, light-hearted show, and this is how you buy it.
But if you're already a fan, you knew that.",1342396800,2,1338,4.683760683760684
8451213,5,B0050I97BK,"This is a very touching series.  I have seen them all, and was glad to find that I was able to buy the dvd's to own.  I recommended this to anyone who likes Shojo or Clamps other works.  Truly a great show.",1331164800,,206,3.857142857142857
8451214,5,B0050I97BK,"Its a very cute anime with a very interesting concept. Clamp is known for its adorable and memorable characters along with a meaningful path for their characters to follow and hopefully reach the goals they set out on in the beginning. This is no exception.
In my opinion this anime is much better than Chobits, or Card Captor Sakura even...and we all know that card captor had an amazing storyline. Instead of missing cards like in card captor, or memories like in Tsabusa Chronicles...the main characters goal is to heal broken hearts or help someone in need in order to collect their ""candies"" in a small bottle...which the ""candies"" are almost like a token of proof to show that she was able to help them. She collects their ""candies"" after she helps fix the issue and in turn, if she fills the bottle within a time limit...then she is granted a wish, which is actually why she sets off doing these tasks in the first place. Its only in subtitles, so if you are not a fan of reading your anime, then you may not find this suitable, but if you're like me and don't even realize your reading the show...then I think you will love this  as much as me(:",1326758400,,1153,4.464454976303317
8451215,5,B0050I97BK,"The beautiful and heart warming manga from the internationally famous CLAMP (xxxHolic, Tsubasa, Chobits) fills the heart with hope in this sweet tale of a girl who tries to heal hearts in order to make a wish come true.

Kobato comes to the world of humans with a wish to be granted but to do so, she must fill a special flask by healing hearts and taking their sorrow away and into the bottle. With the help of otherworldly creature Ioryogi, she goes around a small town and helps true love unite, a mother's heart mend, and a baker and his apprentice's goals meet, in this tale about wishes coming true.

It is such a nice, well intentioned story. Kobato is clumsy and energetic and brimming with good intentions as she throws herself into everything a thousand percent if not more. We watch her heal hearts but at the same time a growing story arc is emerging involving her helping out at the nursery/orphanage and getting closer to the anti-social Fujimoto.

The more she helps and goes about her tasks, the closer she gets to the distant Fujimoto, if only by increments. She helps out Sayaka who runs the place and does her best to see that everyone is happy. Towards the final episodes of this collection, Kobato learns a bit about Fujimoto's childhood and that Sayaka's place is in debt. Everyone is doing their best to help out, but while all this is going on, Kobato only has a year to fill her flask or else her wish will not come true.

The show has huge heart and that's its appeal. It's a anime good show through and through. There is some mystery around what Kobato truly is (a ghost, an angel?) and what her wish is about (she only mentions that it is somewhere she wants to go but she never says where or why) so we learn little about her. She's a cute enigma and clearly the soul of the show.

The art by Madhouse (Rideback, Allison and Lillia, Tokyo Babylon) have made a show as pretty as another CLAMP title: Chobits. In fact, some of the characters look a lot (and by a lot I mean identical) to some of the characters from Chobits. The twins look like younger version of Chi from Chobits. Why this is, I cannot say, but it is interesting for CLAMP fans to spot the similarities to previous characters from other series. The bright and light palate of the colors are right in line with the feel good vibe of the show. It has a way of warming you from you head to your toes!

EXTRAS:
Bonus extras include clean opening and ending animation along with trailers of other anime titles.

IN SUMMARY:
A sweetheart of an anime! Kobato is about a girl trying to make life better by healing hearts and making wishes come true. An anime sure to put a smile on your face!",1319068800,,2679,4.4

Loved it. I'm going to buy the second one but I have to be careful to not find out the ending since the #5 manga isn't out yet.

8451217,5,B0050I97BK,"This has nothing to do with the anime itself, but reviews from another anime are showing up for Kobato Collection 1 that completely distract from the actual content of the show. Viewers be warned that most of these reviews do not relate to this show and therefore the star ratings are not accurate. I have seen some of Kobato and it looks gorgeous, has wonderful music, and has a great cast of characters, if not a ditsy main character (wouldn't have it any other way). If you like Angelic Layer or Tsubasa, you will enjoy this latest addition from clamp along with collection 2.",1312243200,5,579,4.576923076923077
