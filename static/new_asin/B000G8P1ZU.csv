8129452,4,B000G8P1ZU,"Amazon doesn't list the VCI DVD-R edition of ""A Lawman Is Born"", so note that I have only seen the VCI edition and not the Alpha.  Alpha started using a superimposed logo around 2005-2006, so I refuse to purchase garbage like that.  On this VCI edition there is also ""The Gambling Terror"".  I like the films, but am not too pleased with the presentations.  Lawman is slightly edited and both films are TV prints as evidenced by the Hollywood TV Service title card replacing the Republic Pictures card.  Both features also experience splices during dialogue.  I've noticed that other of these VCI westerns they are putting out experience these same problems.  I purchased a few of these and don't know that I will purchase any more.",1355097600,,731,4.753968253968254

While there were a great lineup of Western heroes to marvel at, Johnny Mack Brown (and Hoppy) has always stood out and now that I have watched this clean, clear, well produced DVD, I really understand why.  He didn't sing (Yuck, ptooey), he didn't dress fancy, and all his getup wasn't snazzy or frilly; he was just a good old fashioned down to earth western hero that stood for being honest, good, caring, loyal and hard working. Roy and Gene were alright, but I think that I learned the most that stood by me well throughout my life from guys like Johnny. Too bad that these days youth don't have this kind of hero to look up to and learn from.",1298246400,3,824,4.248407643312102
