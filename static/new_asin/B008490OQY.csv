5130362,5,B008490OQY,"The instructional videos helped me learn to play golf. I've always had an interest in the game when I played with my father, but wasn't any good at it. I thought I could use a few tips and bought these videos. Best Decision I've invested in a Hobby!  I learned the basics in the game (Like how to stand, grip, and swinging.) And my father couldn't believe I got so good so fast.

The videos where easy to understand and you get four dvds for the price of one! I recommend these videos to anyone looking to improve or learn golf.",1380672000,,528,4.217821782178218
5130363,5,B008490OQY,"After buying this dvd set. It is amazing what I have learned, and what I can do in such a short period of time. It takes you through all the basics. It teaches how to grip, hold stances and how to swing and stroke.  I learned how to judge distance, and when to putt and when not to.

Each dvd had a lot of information. I like the guy's accent on the DVDs. Sounds like he is from UK.  The only thing was the DVDs were kinda short and looked a little outdated. But for the price of 4 DVDs it is pretty match to the price of one DVD sold from someone else on amazon.  Overall good deal for the price.

Since watching the videos, I have been getting better and better. My boyfriend is jealous now. lol",1380153600,4,697,3.985611510791367

5130365,5,B008490OQY,"Thanks to these golf videos, I am beating my husband at his own game! I never quite understood how to play golf. These videos taught me a lot about my stance and grip that I hadn't even thought of before I watched them. They even explained how to putt and when to putt. I think the most useful information was how to handle slopes! My game improved so much that my husband had to watch them too. I would recommend these dvds to anyone.",1362614400,8,435,4.190476190476191

5130370,5,B008490OQY,For me as a beginner I learned a lot that improved my game the first time I played after watching the video.  The video keeps it simple which was great for me.  In contract I suspect and advanced play would be disappointed that more advanced shop making is not addressed.,1435536000,,271,4.4
5130371,5,B008490OQY,"Golf is the game of gentlemen (and ladies too). It is the perfect platform to make and grow relations. There can not be anything better that golf to unwind.

5130372,5,B008490OQY,"This DVD set is fantastic for beginner golfers. They show you exactly how to stand, how to putt, and how to handle all of the golfing challenges. It is truly worth the money and saves the hassle of hiring someone to teach you the same things.",1426032000,,242,4.282608695652174
5130373,5,B008490OQY,"I enjoyed these DVDs  but then again I enjoy watching golf of any kind. The short game DVD was the most interesting and useful one of the four, and I have picked up some very useful tips.",1420761600,,187,4.054054054054054
5130374,5,B008490OQY,"Golf as a sport had been pretty much strange to me and I was wondering why it is so popular. While watching tips and instructions from this DVD set, I started to like it. As I plan to play it occasionally and only recreational, these lessons are more than suitable for me. A little drawback is a video quality.",1420416000,,310,4.271186440677966
5130375,2,B008490OQY,The case that my dvd came in has the centers broke out on all 4 post. The dvd's just slide around. Need a new case.,1419811200,,115,3.64
5130376,1,B008490OQY,"The case for the 4 disks was so broken on the inside that it will only grip one of the disks.  Apparently this company's web site is down as I have attempted tomcontact them regarding this matter.  The disks are somewhat scratched but appear to work OK.
I am unable to judge the content of the DVD's as yet.",1416960000,,307,4.186440677966102

5130378,2,B008490OQY,"Not what I expected.  The presenter on the tapes is sometimes hard to understand does not speak the ""King's English"" clearly.  In general I think any weekend golfer could have done just as good.  I would not recommend these videos to any of my friends.",1416009600,,252,4.555555555555555
5130379,5,B008490OQY,"I have never been into golf or tried playing the game until my father started. He invited me to a game of golf one day. Luckily I had time to practice. I searched on the web on how to play, but didn't understand. I came across several blogs about people learning to play by watching how-to DVD's. I went in search of a DVD and came across this one along with several others. I purchased this one because of the reviews. I have loved it. Dad and I went golfing, and I beat him at his game. I now play more often.",1415059200,,511,4.019607843137255
5130380,3,B008490OQY,"The practice drills DVD doesn't play well at all and that was the DVD I was most interested in.
The short game DVD is very instructional, and I've already incorporated 2 points which have decreased my green strokes already -- keeping my head still while putting and making the swing the same pace for the duration of the swing.  I wished the short game DVD gave more tips for distance control with the putter.  I have a big problem judging the distance of long putts, and usually pop my ball up because I'm trying to hit it hard.  I usually three-put very long puts.",1405555200,,566,4.423076923076923

5130382,2,B008490OQY,"This instructional CD is just OK for a beginner.  First, the instructor has a really strong S. African accent, so I have trouble understanding what he's saying.  Second, certain parts of the CD menu don't pull up the corresponding instruction.  For example, when I tried to open golf course 'Etiquette', it opens instructions about how to hit the ball away from natural obstacles (huh??).  I'm going to give it another try, but after spending more than an hour with it, I'm disappointed.",1399161600,,487,4.902439024390244
5130383,3,B008490OQY,"The info in the DVD's is good, but it seems to be shot on a home video camera.  You might just prefer watching the Golf channel and learning from the pro's.",1396915200,,156,4.032258064516129
5130384,5,B008490OQY,The best Golf Videos for everyone. I learn a lots from this Videos. It works I like it very much,1395360000,,96,3.85
5130385,5,B008490OQY,I haven't touched a golf club in nearly twenty years.  This series of DVD's was/is a great refresher course. The only negative thing I could offer is that the accent of the (in my opinion South African) instructor was a little hard to understand at first.  It got much easier as I continued watching the videos.,1394150400,,311,4.535714285714286

8525015,5,B008490OQY,I was feeling a little weird learning how to gold from a DVD and not a real person but it actually was a smart idea. Golf can be frustrating to learn but with this I didn't have to feel embarrassed messing up in front of someone or having them repeat the same thing multiple times. The instructor was really good at explaining what to do and why you need to do it. I would say this film is worth a shot.,1481155200,,403,3.9876543209876543
