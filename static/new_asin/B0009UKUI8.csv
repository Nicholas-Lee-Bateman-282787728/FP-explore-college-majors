2322142,5,B0009UKUI8,There are many things I like about this DVD - it will serve me for many years. Thanks to YMAA for top quality in all aspects.,1214784000,,125,3.8461538461538463
2322143,3,B0009UKUI8,"The organization of the material presented is good.  You get basic taiji theory, breathing exercises, the basic moves, the forms, and then the applications.  The early material is presented well.  The breathing exercises, in particular, are shown clearly, at the pace and for the length of time which you actually perform them.

My difficulties lie with the essence of the material; the basic movements and their implementation in the forms.  All are presented at a reasonably slow tempo.  But, they are only shown once and without narration, which makes using this DVD an exercise in frustration.  Learning where to place the blade, how to move the other hand, and how to place and move the feet means a great deal of work with the DVD remote in order to watch a given move multiple times, so that you can study each aspect of it.

That frustration would have been greatly alleviated had each move been shown 3-4 times, and from different angles.  A narration would also have helped, essentially taking the role of an instructor talking you through each movement.

The martial applications are shown similarly.  It is not a problem for that section, however, because it simply displays how the movements would have been employed in a martial situation, and the applications section is a very interesting and welcome inclusion to the DVD.

All in all, it is possible to learn from this DVD.  It would work better, though, as an adjunct to taking a class, as an at-home refresher of what you learn in the class.  I don't know, however, whether that would work if you were to take a class from somebody other than the people who publish this DVD.",1184544000,11,1644,4.763250883392226
2322144,5,B0009UKUI8,"Normally, I recommend to students to learn the simplified forms first and then graduate to the long forms of a style.  However, due to the quality of the DVD offered by Dr. Yang, Jwing Ming of the Long Form of the Classical Yang Style Sword Form, I feel the best choice would be to learn the long form offered on this disc.  Although there are many good Taijiquan Sword instructional videos available for the Chen, Wu, Sun and Yang styles, I believe that Dr. Yang, Jwing Ming has done his usual top notch job of providing the student with a wealth of material on his Taijiquan Sword Classical Yang Style DVD.

A good teacher will teach you a form.  A better teacher will teach you an application.  A higher level would be the teaching of the technique.  And as Jou, Tsung Hwa relates in his book, The Tao of Taijiquan, the best thing a teacher can pass on is the ""key"" to the system.  I always get the feeling when I study the tapes, books and DVDs from Dr. Yang that he is truly sharing many secrets of the various styles that he teaches.  Fortunately, unless a student is at a level that has the understanding and skill necessary, the information cannot be used or absorbed.  I say fortunately because this can prevent injuries through misuse.  Yet Dr. Yang provides enough of the basics and the exercises that build a strong foundation, whereby a student can raise themselves to the higher levels where deeper information on the DVDs become more available, understandable and usable.

This 54 posture Yang Sword Form is presented along with the Taiji Sword Form, the Taiji Sword Qigong Set, Taiji Qigong Breathing, Fundamental Sword Techniques and 10 Matching Drills for training with another student.

As Dr. Yang frequently reminds the viewer on his tapes, you must practice and make these moves a natural part of your being.  Without practice it is impossible to achieve mastery or even capableness of these techniques, applications and forms.

The Taiji Sword is considered by many to be a very advanced level in Taijiquan Mastery.  Learning the sword form greatly enhances and strengthens the Taiji set.  Learning the sword form increases one's ability to project chi and is a necessary tool in reaching advanced levels of Taijiquan.

Even if you've purchased Dr. Yang's VHS tape of this form, it is worth the money to obtain the DVD as it contains much information not included on the VHS tape.  Additionally, information on DVDs is much easier to access than on a VHS tape.

The DVD is professionally filmed with very easy to follow along teaching, showing the moves at slow speed and at normal speed.  Additionally, using students to demonstrate the moves and then having Dr. Yang provide constructive criticism and praise offers more insight into the moves to the interested viewer.",1163635200,22,2794,4.78125
2322145,5,B0009UKUI8,"I recently became interested in learning Tai Chi after perusing a variety of bookstores looking for sword techniques and styles I thought offered a balance between grace, usefulness, and agility.  I settled on Tai Chi after looking at the forms and the styles that compose it.  As you may or may not know... learning any sword technique from a book is very difficult as it is just as intensive with footwork as it is with the sword itself and sometimes moreso, and after a couple of weeks I was getting nowhere fast.

  I ordered this DVD with another one and found the other one would not play in the player... which was more than a little discouraging.  I put this one in and was greatly relieved, at first just because it worked, but as I watched it there became some clarity in pace and footwork that was not at all apparent in the book I was using.

  The DVD goes through several phases:  including a breathing and postures phase, the 54 forms, the 54 forms in chapter format, drills for two people, and a few other things.  The heart of tai chi is the 54 forms, and they are clearly performed in one long string, subtitled to show which form is currently being performed.  This is very daunting to study or try as a beginner, but I imagine will be extremely useful to someone who has learned most of the forms.  The real meat of the DVD to me is the breakdown, which each form is shown once in very slow execution, allowing for study, then shown again at a faster pace on an attacker.  I cannot stress the usefulness of this.  I haven't seen a book that showed application of technique... only the technique themselves... I was (and still am) hugely impressed with this extra step.  It gives you not only the correct, clear way to perform a form, but demonstrates its use and footwork very clearly.  If you are interested in learning a sword style, I highly recommend this DVD... there are also additional ads for other DVDs this company produces and I definitely will be buying some of those as the clarity of the video and the teaching style is very illumative and well done.",1142812800,33,2084,4.470899470899471
2322146,5,B0009UKUI8,"This beautiful program teaches the entire 'long form' of the Tai Chi sword sequence, and has an excellent ""warm-up"" section of Qigong breathing techniques and Sword Qigong movements.

This Sword form is an excellent addition to your knowledge, whether you train Tai Chi Chuan, or another martial art, or are a beginner. The fundamental techniques are very comprehensive, and give a complete overview to the art of the Sword.

The DVD has amazing navigation, picture quality, and sound, and you can quickly get anywhere in the 2-hour program with just a couple clicks.",1120089600,40,567,5.086021505376344
8066740,5,B0009UKUI8,Another great DVD tutorial from Dr. Yang's extensive collection,1458172800,,63,6.111111111111111
8066741,5,B0009UKUI8,"This is a very useful guide to those students wishing to pursue the Tai Chi Sword form.  Dr. Yang provides good discussion of basic techniques of the Jian, demonstrating each movement as a solo practice, then demonstrating a couple of examples of how the movement might be used in application as it relates to position etc. Dr. Yang then provides demonstration of the entire, traditional, 54 Movement Set, followed by slower detailed instruction.  The 54 is a long and challenging set, and newer students my find it challenging if they have not been exposed to simpler sets like the 13 step form or other basic sword forms.  That being said, the 54 is traditional and it is excellent to have a detailed guide as reference to such a challenging set. This video also includes examples of a Qigong set to help improve movement and focus for developing feeling and extension in use of the Jian as well as explanation of application and partner sword practice.  Overall, this is one of the better Tai Chi Sword videos available.  The instruction is clear and step by step, it had detailed menus allowing you to view sections and movement over and over again with ease.  There are relatively few sword instructional videos with this level of detail and quality available.  It is particularly helpful if you are using it as a supplement to Dr. Yang's book by the same name.",1429747200,,1366,4.738396624472574
8066742,5,B0009UKUI8,Well done video. Easy to follow. But I'm just not coordinated enough yet to get very far into it.,1411516800,,97,4.157894736842105
8066743,5,B0009UKUI8,"So first, you need the book and the DVD together. And even then you are going to be doing a fair amount of going back and forth between the book and the DVD to learn the Tai Chi Sword.

Second, in the absence of a good instructor you really need to take the time and learn this in bite size bits. You may be tempted to skip over parts, the strength training, the Qigong, the postures, and the technique fundamentals- DON'T! One of my first Tai Chi instructors said, ""Every move in Tai Chi has meaning.""

Third, don't be in a hurry. So much the better if you have a training partner, but you can still get a lot out of this without one. Take your time and learn each part a bit at a time. Add a new drill or exercise each week. The DVD does a great job of demonstrating the Qigong practice associated with the sword. It is a standing form, so there is no stepping, the only movement is with your arms and the bending of your knees, and of course your breathing. My local instructor and I had an hour long session on the importance of a good standing Qigong practice, and it has the added benefit of moving your body in ways you haven't been used to yet, so be prepared for some sore muscles the first couple of times.

Fourth, as with the other drills, add and practice the sword movements one at a time, at least that is how I do it. I will learn one sword drill, and add a second one in a week, sometimes longer. This way I can gradually get my body used to moving in the way of the Tai Chi Sword. And can build up to the strength needed to do it well.

Fifth, don't rush the techniques. In Tai Chi, I am finding doing them slowly, and the slower the better, builds perfection, helps you communicate the different parts of your body to your training,

So, the DVD is clear, but lacks total completeness, the book, has pictures, but are sometimes difficult to divine the movements from the book. Together they are a great resource on your way to learning the Tai Chi Sword, tho it cannot be over stated that there is no substitute for a qualified and knowledgeable teacher.",1409961600,3,2073,4.224747474747475
8066744,3,B0009UKUI8,good for practice and review.,1406332800,,29,5.0
8066745,5,B0009UKUI8,"Over the years I've owned several of Dr. Yang Jwing Ming's products, both books and videos, and they have always been of the highest quality. They tend to be well presented, highly detailed, and informative. Recently I've purchased his TAI CHI SWORD DVD and I'm very pleased to say that it's outstanding.

This DVD offers extensive information on all aspects of Classical Yang Tai Chi sword forms and techniques. It also includes training in Tai Chi sword Qigong exercises, something that I had never even heard of before. Dr. Yang presents dozens of basic sword techniques, shown without an opponent and with. This allows the viewer to concentrate on the movement alone and then see precisely how it is used. This is a great advantage for learning each movement from both a dynamic and functional point of view. It also provides training on stances, partner training drills, and applications.

Included in the program are the names of each movement read in English and Mandarin with subtitles on the screen. Subtitles also indicate the breathing with regards to inhales and exhales for each move. I don't know if Yang is responsible for the writing and organization of this program or if he hires someone, but this program is designed very well as a teaching tool. The instructions are precise, logical, and easy to follow. The DVD's menu makes it easy to skip around the content and select subjects out of sequence or for repeated viewings.

The 54 posture forms presented on this disk are different from those that I learned years ago though the movements and techniques are quite familiar. Camerawork, lighting, and editing are good quality and aid in ease of viewing and comprehension. The content of this DVD is also available in book form which may be very useful as a companion tool to the DVD.

There are several very good products on the market today regarding Yang Style Tai Chi Sword, but for anyone interested in making a thorough and effective study Yang Tai Chi sword forms and methods, you couldn't do much better that buying this excellent DVD.",1378857600,3,2061,4.863247863247863
8066746,4,B0009UKUI8,"This was well presented and professionally shot. The martial applications were well done and was useful to see as it inspires the imagination in addition to the ones presented. The form was well done with a nice tempo and the explanations were clear as well as noting the footwork, hand work and body position. What was nice also to see is the form I learned in Taiwan was very similar to the one Dr. Yang presented with very minor variations. The sword used in Taiwan was shorter, about 39"" actually which was one of the differences. It would have been nice to clearly identify the basic 13 historic techniques along with the others presented. However, I really enjoyed this DVD and certainly recommend this to others.",1377388800,,719,4.714285714285714
8066747,1,B0009UKUI8,I really was hoping to like this video and train from it.  I purchased this video along with a sword.  I am glad this video arrived first because now I am going to need to purchase another training video.  This video is DEMO ONLY and gives no instructions at all other then to breath in and breath out by way of subtitles on the lower right of the screen.  In all fairness it does state that this video is supposed to be used with the book by the same person.  I don't have the book nor do I intend on purchasing it.  I only hope the book has some sort of instruction in it.  I also consider the provided video demo's of poor quality since they are all from a single camera angle.  This day and age most good training has multi-camera angles and picture-in-picture to show how to do something properly.  There were numerous times where the distant hand was not visible and I was wondering what position it should be in.,1369526400,4,919,4.265895953757226
8066748,5,B0009UKUI8,"This is really a beautiful treatment of taiji sword practice. It offers a view of practice with an opponent present, making clear the practical applications of the poses and postures . . . Dr. Yang is an amazing practitioner and teacher. The DVD is extremely graceful but also practical in that the viewer can match it with the information given in the book. Dr. Yang would rather the student master manual taiji, then broadsword, then straight sword. That would be the right path for beginning at the beginning but it is not unusual for students today to be learning manual and straight sword taiji at the same time. Perhaps not optimal but some of us are beginning later in life and still building foundational skills and learning the meditation and philosophy at the same time. The book and DVD are a bit beyond me so my teacher has them at this time. Dr. Yang does not disappoint the longtime practitioner who has depth and skill already.",1343692800,2,942,4.680722891566265
8066749,3,B0009UKUI8,"I really wanted a video that was self explanatory. This isn't.  I also could swear that the ""breath in-breath out"" commentary doesn't match the sword master's breaths and hand movements.  Impossible to tell if I'm doing anything correctly.",1234310400,2,239,5.2631578947368425
