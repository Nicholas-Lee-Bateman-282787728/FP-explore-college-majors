8445253,5,B004WLATYK,"As I was watching this video, which is quite good, they mention safety several items, but they never mention one very important safety lesson, as taught by the military. You NEVER cock the gun over-handed, with your thumb behind the cocking handle, NEVER! They do it wrong on the video too. What can happen is, that when firing, you may get a delayed round or hang-fire or hot-fire, and when trying to clear it, it goes off while you have your thumb behind the cocking handle, ready to cock it, and it will drive the cocking handle back into your thumb, ripping it out of it's socket, or breaking it. You ALWAYS cock these guns under-handed, using the four fingers, and having the thumb pointed outward to the right, so if you have a delayed firing, it will simply jump out of your fingers grip, and miss your thumb. Again, never cock one of these guns, especially when they are hot, over-handed, NEVER!

The rest of this video was well done, the disassembly and operation instructions were well explained, including adjusting headspace. They also show what is needed to convert the gun from 30-06 to .308, and how to use a link and belt loader. Last, they show the operation of the semi-auto version, and the fakes. On the range, you get to see them fired off, full-auto.",1363478400,4,1272,4.578947368421052
