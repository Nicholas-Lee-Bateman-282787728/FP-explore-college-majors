7958384,5,B0000633F1,"Once I watched volume one of this series, I knew I had to have volume two. Within a few days of practice (the tape comes with an accompanying booklet of music & tablature), I was able to play through these with expanding ease. Mr. Ruskin first shows you the basics of each tune and then breaks it down and shows you how to include variations. I've already played a few for some guitarist friends and they all sat up and watched. With a little more practice, I'll be able to play them a lot better. Very easy to view split-screen and on screen counter for reference. A winner!",1027209600,,575,4.333333333333333
