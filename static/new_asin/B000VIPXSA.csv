8413916,5,B000VIPXSA,I exercise to this tape with my kids.  We're all sweating at the end.  We're not tired of it yet.  We alternate with other exercise programs throughout the week.  We use this one at least twice a week.  It's also great for reaching kids at a level they understand.,1234483200,2,264,4.3061224489795915
8413917,5,B000VIPXSA,"I bought this dvd for my daughter and she is 12- I think this dvd is excellent- the instructor speaks to teens in a very positive way and focuses on being healthy and confident.  I do the exercises with my daughter and they do burn but they are ""do-able"" and you can feel and see the results.  I would recommend this to all teens.",1197763200,2,330,4.140625
8413918,5,B000VIPXSA,"I've been seeing Matt Richardson for Pilates in a 2 month period, and I have been able to refrain from spinal revision surgery. If this guy can help me then he can help anyone. I'm a skeptical person and I would recommend his instruction to anyone.",1194825600,,248,4.413043478260869
8413919,5,B000VIPXSA,I found this workout challenging and fun.  It's a lot cooler than any other Pilates workouts I've done.  It's upbeat and the music is cool.  The best thing is that it doesn't talk down to teens like we're little kids.,1194739200,5,217,4.375
