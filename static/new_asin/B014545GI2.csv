8729647,5,B014545GI2,"This film somehow manages to bring something new to the gangster film genre with its intricately weaved storyline and a nod to a Shakespearean tragic romance. The movie is expertly shot. The pacing is exact, and the ensemble performances deliver the gravitas and grit needed for a film of the stature. Watch it; you won't be disappointed!",1452038400,,338,4.947368421052632
