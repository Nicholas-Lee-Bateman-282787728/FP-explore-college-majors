5049528,5,B0072BNK02,"How Seth Green and co managed to convince George Lucas to allow this to happen is beyond me, but I'm sure glad he did. As a fan of the movies since I was a child and a HUGE Robot Chicken fan, this series was a dream come true for me. I'm really glad they didn't go by the movie format like the Family Guy Trilogy did and just picked whatever they wanted from all 6 movies. Turned out great. Whoever voices Palpatine and Boba Fett deserve raises. Well done!",1355097600,3,456,4.134831460674158
5049529,5,B0072BNK02,"At roughly 15.00 for the trhee discs, it's very entertaining and worth the expenditure....wouldn't pay the 45.00 or so to buy them seperately.....video is of high enough quality for me, and I'm not much of an extras guy, but I did watch one commentary, and it was cool enough.",1354838400,,276,4.653061224489796
5049530,5,B0072BNK02,"I freely admit, I am a nerd.  I have every incarnation of every Star Wars movie ever released, even the horrid 'remasters' of the originals.  Interestingly, I never really watched RC prior to these airing in 2010 (I think that's when it was).  I watched these with my sons (also big Star Wars fans) and we couldn't stop laughing.  Even the youngest was rolling on the floor.  If you're a Star Wars fan, these are a must.  If you're not, you may be amused, but the references almost require a solid understanding of the undertones of the movies.  All I can say to Seth Green is ""Well done, sir!""",1348099200,14,594,4.394495412844036
5049531,5,B0072BNK02,"I figured since there are already plenty of reviews on the individual Robot Chicken Star Wars releases, which is what these are only bundled, I will just quickly point out exactly what this set is and how it is packaged, since Amazon does not even have a stock image or anything and very little information in general.

I purchased this for 14.99. What this is is not some separate box set with different packaging. Instead you get all three original Robot Chicken Star Wars DVDs each separate one factory sealed. Those three are also wrapped together and there is a little paper insert on the front that says ""Robot Chicken Star Wars Episodes I and II and III"" So essentially, this is the same exact product as buying the 3 versions separate. the difference is this is much cheaper. It is around 15 bucks here and at Best Buy, 5 bucks per Episode. The individual Episodes, as of right now, are $9.26, $10.73, and $11.19 respectively. So a total of $31.18. So you are saving more than 50% if you choose to go with this set. Even if you already own one of these Episodes and you purchase this set, you are still paying only $7.50 each for the other 2 episodes and have one extra brand new copy that you could re-sell. So this really is a hell of a deal.",1342656000,62,1252,4.396551724137931
5049532,5,B0072BNK02,"The 3 dvd were in perfect condition, the shipping was faster than the time said and i laughed so much watching it!
I recommend those DVD for fans of robot chicken, fan of star wars and people who sometime like simple jokes.",1341878400,,223,4.333333333333333
5049533,3,B0072BNK02,"When I ordered this I was expecting an 'official' collection of the Robot Chicken:Star Wars trilogy but instead it's simply the three seperate discs combined for one purchase. That's not necessarily a bad thing, just not what I expected. I already had the first RC:SW, due to it being mentioned on the Family Guy parody, and even though I wasn't all that impressed with it I still couldn't resist getting the other two, because I'm a big SW fan, and getting them all together definitly saved some money. If this sounds like a predicament you're in then I would recommend getting this set, or if you're a big RC & SW fan. However, if you're simply a SW fan and only casually watch RC (like myslef) than I would borrow/rent these first to see if they're for you. RC:SW is not like FG:SW because it's just a bunch of random clips in all three episodes, and they are just regular eps too not special releases. Don't get me wrong, it's funny, just not for everybody. Despite its lesser reviews I personally enjoyed the third one more than the other two combined, but I appear to be in the minority for that. I seem to be the first reviewer for this collection, so my apologies if it's not very helpful, but I would say have a good idea of what RC is all about before you purchase this.",1338249600,15,1280,4.405063291139241
5049534,2,B0072BNK02,"This just didn't do it for me for.  I chuckled only a handful of times giving all 3 a fair chance.  Being a major Star Wars fan and also loving the the Family Guy Star Wars I thought I'd love these.  However I don't know the Robot Chicken show at all, and had I seen that prior I might have been better prepared for the style of the show.  I certainly did not hate it, and I did laugh at points, but it didn't meet my expectations at all.  Now the Family Guy Star Wars I'm crazy about and I've shown them to friends having seen through them a good 4-5 times.  Lastly the packaging the RC DVDs came in while being perfectly fine, they couldn't of found cheaper DVD cases to put them in.  Not really a boxed set, more like 3 recycled DVD cases bundled in plastic.  Still nothing arrived broken and everything worked fine.  Yeah, check out Family Guy Star Wars instead as it's much funnier (so long as you find Family Guy funny) and I think it's around the same price.",1499990400,,965,4.172972972972973

5049559,3,B0072BNK02,Love this series and I love the insanity they bring to the star wars franchise. It was a great price deal and the special features are entertaining. The only downside to this is that they are all censored and there is no other option for uncensored. was really dissappointed by that fact. They do have sketches that weren't on tv though.,1428192000,,337,4.540983606557377

5049568,5,B0072BNK02,"Wonderful shorts based on Star Wars. While a fan of the Family Guy SW series, I found this collection to be superior for a couple of reasons. First, I think we all have to admit, and the creators even jokingly admit in the opening scroll to the third episode, that the Family Guy SW series started running dry and trying a little too hard as it went along; the Robot Chicken collection stays funny throughout. And that is mainly because of the Second point, since they aren't held to the story line like Family Guy was, Robot Chicken is able to take their jokes in the most unexpected and bizarre directions, keeping it fresh. Very recommended. I only hope that Disney will be half as understanding and supportive of their fandom and its projects like this as Lucas was.",1416096000,2,770,4.546762589928058

Only one thing that puzzled us is that the first one is only 20 minutes, 2nd one was about 40-60 (don't remember!) and the 3rd one was 30 minutes... We thought it was odd since other people said that this does include extended version.  Not sure if we are dumb or didn't get it?",1396483200,,445,4.2
