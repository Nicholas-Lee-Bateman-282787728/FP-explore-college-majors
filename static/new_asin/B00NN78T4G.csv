8679293,5,B00NN78T4G,"This is another gem from ""TV's Golden Age"" (the 1950s) thanks to the folks at VAI (and the Library of Congress, from which the print used for this release was sourced). Almost 55 years from the date that this TV musical aired on NBC - on ""Max Liebman Presents"" - it is now on DVD for the first time. (Honestly, I don't know that it was acer available on commercial home video in any form prior to now.)

The charming story of ""Heidi"" - based on the book by Johanna Spyri  - is full of great credentials.  The script was co-written by playwright Neil Simon (who was writing for Sid Ceasar's ""Your Show of Shows"" at the same time) though don't expect Simon's usual humor. This is not a comedy. The original songs (using the music of Robert Schumann as themes) has lyrics by Carolyn Leigh and music by Clay Warnick.  The cast includes such veterans as Elsa Lanchester, Jo Van Fleet, Wally Cox (coming off of his hit TV series ""Mister Peepers"" - and actually dancing - AND doing a cartwheel!), and the young Natalie Wood, in a performance that occurred just weeks before her step to stardom in the film ""Rebel Without a Cause"" ! Wood doesn't have the biggest role here - nor does Cox - but both make the most of their screen time.  The star - in the title role - Jeannie Carson went on to a long TV career, She (as well as Cox) seem a bit old for the characters they play but, hey, this is sort of a ""fairy tale"" anyway.  And I don't wan to forget the comic interlude featuring the marionettes of Bill and Cora Baird; a nice bonus for those who remember them on TV in the 1950s (I do!).

The kinescope print (a film of the TV broadcast) is in really nice shape - no scratches and the only ""lighting issues""- a few washed out spots were caused by the stage lighting in the production, not in the filming or preservation. It is - of course- in black and white in 4:3 standard screen aspect.

None of the songs ever went on to be ""hits"" so you've probably never heard any of them unless you saw the original TV airing. (An EP recording on a 45 RPM release  was issued - a copy of the cover is shown on the 4 page insert in the package. )  Speaking of the inseert, VAI did a nice job with this too. 2 of the panels advertise other similar VAI releases, one side lists each of the 25 ""chapters"" on the disc- so you can skip to the musical numbers directly, and there is a VERY informative essay by George Dansker on the shows history and impact which fills the fourth panel.

When it aired - the show ran 90 minutes and was sponsored by Oldsmobile. There were only 3 commercial breaks. The commercials are excised here in the feature presentation but added as a bonus feature (approx 6 minutes). The first is actually the ""Introduction"" to the story.

I see this DVD has having multiple audiences. First, a memory for those who remember the production. Next, for music theatre fans. And, last, but not least, for families to watch with their young children (that's why it was originally created). The book is still read by young girls and the songs are well written.  No, there's not the flash of Disney color and the spare set design of the Swiss Alps is no match for ""The Sound of Music"", but it's a good way for parents (actually grandparents) to explain to their grandchildren what TV was like when they were kids.  Match this up with the release last year of ""Babes In Toyland"" from VAI and you have the makings of a great weekend of family entertainment for the whole family.

I'm not sure what's next from the Max Liebman archive at the Library of Congress, but I, for one, am waiting with anticipation!

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
