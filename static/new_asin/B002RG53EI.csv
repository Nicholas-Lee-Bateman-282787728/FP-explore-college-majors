8378721,5,B002RG53EI,"Live theatre is best seen live - but if you were not able to see Theatre Du Soleil's magnificent ""Flood Drummers"" - this is absolutely worth getting.
Theatre Du Soleil - under the direction of Arianne Mnouchkine, has long been one of the world's leading theatre companies. ""Flood Drummers"", by Mnouchkine's long time collaborator Helene Cixous, continues their work in physical, visually poetic and theatrically literate storytelling. The actors perform as Banraku style puppets, with other actors operating them. Other actors are off-stage providing voices and creating music and soundscapes for the play. The epic story conveys a contemporary environmental message by telling an ancient story of catastrophe brought about by greed and lack of state control over private interests.
The compexity of the vision and simplicity of the mode of storytelling makes for compelling viewing, as do the many surprising and innovative ways of creating the imagery of the story.
I cannot recommend this enough - this is the worlds greatest theatre, essential viewing!",1323216000,,1056,5.406060606060606
