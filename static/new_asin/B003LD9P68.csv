8399660,3,B003LD9P68,"This is a well deserved, but, sadly disappointing tribute documentary type film to the ledgendary Grand Opera basso Nicolai Ghiaurov. The primary redeeming quality is the inclusion of several live recorded staged segments from some of his most storied portrayals; Mephistopheles, Don Quixote, Fiesco, Boris Godunov and Don Basillio. These clips may well not be otherwise available. The documentary has no narration, no subtitles and even it's date of production is elusive.  Also see this reviewer's comments on ""La Scala: A Documentary of Performances"" released by this same producer, ""VIEW Video"", which contains virtually all of the same inadequacies as this one, but, again contains clips that may not be otherwise available.",1466380800,,729,5.508928571428571
8399661,1,B003LD9P68,"The subject, Nicolai Ghiaurov, deserves so much more and this DVD provides so little.  As noted by the previous reviewer there is no narration to link the disjointed excerpts.  There are no subtitles.  There is no information about location and date of the performances.  A drive to the MET in NYC with a side shot of Mr. Ghiaurov is unhelpful and uninteresting.  Excerpts from Rhapsody in Blue are not consistent with the subject material.  The images are clear, the sound reasonable.  The lack of narration, the lack of any sort of discernible order or rationale for what is being shown make this an unacceptable program.",1375574400,2,623,4.876190476190477
8399662,4,B003LD9P68,"Neither Amazon's product description nor the DVD's packaging was informative, and so a review of this film called for detective work. Watching it raised many questions, some of which have gone unanswered. There was a previous release, 15 years earlier, on VHS. An entry in the Internet Movie Database suggests the film was made for television in 1981 under the title ""Az ne zhiveya edin zhivot."" I strongly doubt that all of the performances included are from 1981. To this Ghiaurov connoisseur's ear, much of the singing sounds to have come from the 1970s. But, as will become apparent below, guessing is often all one can do.

As a documentary, this tells us little. No one addresses the camera; no interviewer puts questions to Ghiaurov or anyone else. There is no shaping narration. Nothing is date-stamped. There is *occasional* on-screen text (in English) to identify people and places, but not enough. When a caption does appear, it is often unnecessary or useless. I would have been able to recognize Mirella Freni and Jos Carreras without help (thanks anyway, film), but I would love to know who is responsible for the superb conducting of a complete ""Il lacerato spirito"" from SIMON BOCCANEGRA (the maestro is briefly seen taking his bow with the cast -- my best guess is Nello Santi, but I would not testify to it in court). In the opening moments, a chyron informs us we are looking at the Vienna Opera House, which we are, but we cut immediately to a performance not taking place there (or in *any* opera house -- it's on a set and is lip-synched). There are no optional subtitles in any language, so you are on your own as to the texts of the operas sampled, and you will need fluent Italian and Bulgarian to understand overheard conversations. The film even lacks basic structure and rhythm. We jump and drift from one thing to another, sometimes maddeningly. For example, we see too little of a rehearsal of a Verdi Requiem led by Herbert von Karajan (white-haired but trim and mobile, so this had to have been before his severe health problems began in the early 1980s). We also get footage of the concert performance of that Requiem. The identity of the soloists other than Ghiaurov is anyone's guess. Freni may be the soprano.

All anyone comes away knowing is what I would imagine anyone reading this already knows: Nicolai Ghiaurov (1929-2004) was an operatic basso with an unusually beautiful and arresting timbre. He had a busy career in the world's best houses (we see him performing in Vienna, New York, Tokyo, Milan, and Moscow), and was favored by such distinguished conductors as Karajan and Claudio Abbado. His signature roles included Gounod's Mphistophls, Massenet's Don Quichotte, Mozart's Don Giovanni, Verdi's Jacopo Fiesco, Rossini's Don Basilio, and Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov. Verdi's King Philip II is the conspicuous omission here, and IMDb suggests there was a significantly longer cut of the film that included Philip (the longer cut may have been more coherent overall...which would not be a tall order). Also, he was married to legendary soprano Mirella Freni.

The few attempts to depart from the basic script are unwelcome, as they land with a thud. Ghiaurov goes sightseeing in Japan, we hear the ""Lacrymosa"" from the Verdi Requiem on the soundtrack, and there is editorial commentary in the form of a ""horrors of the atomic bomb"" montage: damaged edifices, children visiting graves, gruesome photos of people with radiation poisoning (""This film is about a Bulgarian opera singer, but Japan will never be the same, you know. Feel bad!""). A sequence with Ghiaurov flying on a plane is puzzling: we hear his recording of the Champagne Aria from DON GIOVANNI, and so much time is spent scrutinizing the faces of the passengers (all of whom are wearing headsets, though I doubt they're hearing the music we're hearing) that I wondered if I were supposed to recognize them.

Ghiaurov impresses as a quiet, modest, rather shy man off stage. He pays no mind to the cameras, although, as often in documentaries, there are dubiously candid moments. I understand Italian well enough to wonder if a BOCCANEGRA discussion with Claudio Abbado wasn't in part staged. Both knew this opera well and performed it often, and they seem to be discussing very basic matters here. I found it odd that they would have just been getting around to these things when camera and sound crews were on hand.

In an extended sequence, the basso painstakingly applies his own elaborate old-age makeup for a performance of Massenet's DON QUICHOTTE. A piano reduction of ""Rhapsody In Blue"" is the background music. We get the same Gershwin piece in full orchestral clothes over shots of New York, suggesting the director had seen Woody Allen's then-recent MANHATTAN. We also see Ghiaurov signing autographs; modeling dramatic attitudes in the mirror; pacing backstage while experimenting with phrasing and inflections (playing around with the word ""Tsarevich"" for BORIS) and growling endearingly to indicate satisfaction or its lack.

It is fortunate that the film contains many musical performances of reasonably generous length, for these are the reasons to see it. One wishes the musical numbers were better contextualized, but on the plus side, not a single clip was one I had seen before. Only ""Il lacerato spirito"" from BOCCANEGRA is without question from a staged performance, as indicated by the distant and relatively static shooting. (An aside: it is unclear where that BOCCANEGRA was taking place, but the audience was a knowledgeable one with the taste and intelligence not to bury Verdi's quietly stunning postlude by clapping and hollering after the singer's last note.) The Death Scene from BORIS (for which Ghiaurov is beautifully costumed) *appears* to be taking place live, but later there is apparent lip-synching, so it may be a composite: mostly on stage but with some clean-up in post. DON QUICHOTTE may also be a composite -- we see Quichotte and Sancho in silhouette against projections of sheep, windmills, etc., but the actual Death Scene may be taking place on a stage. Again, some of it appears lip-synched, but the applause at the end leads one to believe it was live. Presumably concocted just for this occasion are the soundstage films of the ""Song of the Golden Calf"" and Cathedral Scene from FAUST, and Basilio's ""Calumnia"" from IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA.

In brief: the deaths of Quichotte and Boris are sung and acted with eloquence and poignant restraint, forcefully rebutting anyone who dismisses Ghiaurov as another huge-voiced Slavic ham. The FAUST film, co-starring the wife as Marguerite, has rich, vivid colors, and Ghiaurov's devil is nearly scary this time. (Interestingly, Freni and Ghiaurov are never in a shot at the same time, suggesting they acted their parts as their schedules allowed. They may be lip-synching to their EMI recording conducted by Georges Prtre.) The Rossini piece is a quasi-ballet, with malicious gossip Basilio darting about a mansion surrounded by dancing ghouls and demons. The staging cleverly links this character with the literal devils (Gounod's and Boito's) in the singer's repertoire.

From what appears to be a Ghiaurov tribute concert (perhaps his 50th birthday?), Freni is heard singing a snippet of BOHME's ""Mi chiamano Mim,"" and Jos Carreras and Piero Cappuccilli tear through the cabaletta of the final tenor/baritone duet from LA FORZA DEL DESTINO. If these fine performances were to be included at all, there should have been more of them. This applies also to rehearsal footage, which (besides Karajan's Verdi Requiem) includes Abbado's pulsatile conducting of the Act Three prelude of BOCCANEGRA, followed by a teasing, too-short excerpt from a Cappuccilli/Ghiaurov performance of that act's reconciliation duet. This was obviously in preparation for a Milan staging of the legendary Giorgio Strehler production; its iconic sets are recognizable. I believe -- but, again, could not testify -- that Jos van Dam appears fleetingly. There is a brief tour of La Scala, set to Verdi's ""Requiem aeternam.""

As suggested above, the film is by turns enthralling and frustrating, but the singing elevates it. I cannot imagine any Ghiaurov fan not wanting to see it at least once...and I cannot imagine anyone who enjoys the included music not *being* a Ghiaurov fan. In a separate biographical section, we are told (in scrolling text over the QUICHOTTE death scene) that Ghiaurov's ""thespian acumen, booming yet refined voice, and magnetism on stage transformed him from the humble country boy into perhaps the greatest bass singer of the post World War II era."" That about sums it up. If a more purely beautiful lower male voice emerged in the postwar era, I have not heard it.",1285372800,11,8768,5.053904630269523
