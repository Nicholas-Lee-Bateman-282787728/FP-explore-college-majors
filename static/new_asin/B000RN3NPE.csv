8201502,5,B000RN3NPE,"This isn't technically a review per se.

I came upon this Amazon.com listing while searching for an authentic DVD release of the classic Ikkyu-San anime about a young priest/monk who outwits his elders and solves mysteries.

Although technically correct in identifying the box set being offered here - it was more commonly known as ""Highschool Baseball Ninja"" in markets outside of Japan. This anime tells the tale of a young teenager who is a descendant of a famous ninja. And although athletically superior, he doesn't play sports. Eventually, the baseball coach and fellow classmates recruit him to play the game in the hopes of saving the high school's reputation.

Felt it was important to clarify this distinction in case someone made a purchase based solely on the name of the program. And at $200+ for this boxed set - that would be one heckuva mistake.",1379376000,2,861,4.924137931034482
