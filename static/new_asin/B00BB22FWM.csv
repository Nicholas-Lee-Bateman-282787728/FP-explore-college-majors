5569128,3,B00BB22FWM,"As like the other reviews stated, this movie doesn't seem to violent at all. The movie cover is really misleading with the NOT RATED movie. This movie is PG or PG-13 at the most and could be air on public TV no problem now a days. In fact, I seen worse things happen on TV movies/shows than this.

First thing first, the gun behind the girl's back on the cover is not there ever. Also, the back cover has the daughter holding a gun as well. i don't know what's up with the gun drawing being shown on the title or back cover, but it's not there! The only gun there is in the whole movie seen bad one drug dealer and it wasn't even fired or used.

Now let me talk about the movie. This movie is one of those family coming together movies, and you could watch it with you family and you could talk about the things being shown in the movie. It's about a daughter that grew up in Trinity, TX  with her SUPER religious family and runs away to Austin, TX, when she turns 18. Also, unknown to her family, she keeps a very bad secretly that she done to them. Once she runs away, she wants to forget it all and starts doing drugs. She also meets her Boyfriend as well, which doesn't help her situation as he is a drug dealer.

After some time, she and her Boyfriend get caught by the police in their car. They both get arrested by having drugs in the car. This all leads to the boyfriend going to jail and the daughter going back to her hometown. The movie then starts with flashbacks of the daughter life before her going to Austin, TX. Then, would revel more and more of her life story. Then, the movie would come back to the present time and go back to flashbacks when something new is revealed.

I only recommend this movie if you want to talk to your teenage kids about drug issues, sex, running away, or anything else you see in this movie. This is a good movie to show them that family first and what bad things that comes along the way, the family can overcome it and get through it.",1377475200,4,1982,4.164490861618799
5569129,2,B00BB22FWM,"When I saw the box cover I saw a a young girl holding a gun behind her back. As I was watching this movie I only remember her with a revolver
in one scene. The movie itself is fair. It is most certainly not a super violent or over the top movie as is lead to believe by the box art. This
is not even a crime related movie either. I saw it as more of something made for the Lifetime or HallMark Channel. This movie is pretty tame and barley
even deserves a PG rating. Maybe just for a small amount of profanity but their is no nudity in it at all. I think this movie needs different box cover art to properly represent it.",1365638400,5,621,3.9365079365079363
5569130,5,B00BB22FWM,"I was throughly impressed by this movie. The main roles had good actors and it kept my interest the whole time. I though Andrea Bowen did a really good job, and I thought Adam Mayfield was wonderful! He was nominated for Best Actor & Best Supporting actor for The Preacher's Daughter in the St. Tropez Film festival! That has to tell you something! I would watch it again!",1365120000,,372,4.485294117647059

5569148,2,B00BB22FWM,"This is a Faith Based movie. Nothing wrong with that, but it is misrepresented, which is disappointing. The explorations of Sin and Innocence, Faith and responsibility, morality in the family, society and self, are well developed and heartfelt. As a film, it is quite slow in development, and somewhat confusing as the plot is developed in a long series of flashbacks as a means of self-reflection that become tedious. To me the most disappointing thing is that I believe there is a hidden agenda that becomes a manipulation by not describing and packaging the film accurately as a faith based film.",1471996800,2,599,4.9405940594059405

Wish I hadn't.

It is footloose, without the dancing or any redeeming story.  I lived in small, highly religious towns until age 18.  The prayer-gossip line is true.

Oh - and see my title?  Two can play this game (for the people who selected the DVD cover).",1461110400,,373,4.492537313432836

5569173,5,B00BB22FWM,"As a bi-vocational pastor, I am very concerned with sin and its effects on my parishioners. We focus so much on avoiding sin in the world that we forget that the church can also be a place where a believer can become entangled in sin. This film focuses on the fictional account of one such church casualty, Hannah Price, the preacher's daughter.

In graphic detail, the film depicts her fall as well as her eventual redemption. This film should serve as a reminder that anyone, including born-again Christians, can lead others into sin.

Though the language is a little rough (in the unrated version), the film accurately depicts how sin can affect and destroy a life.

I agree with previous posters about the movie art. It is blatantly inaccurate.",1441411200,7,748,4.782945736434108

To avoid nasty consequenses in the present, Hannah is sort of forced to face the past. And that's not easy at all. By and by you come to understand what made her leave her hometown, because of the long flashbacks. Actually this film is more playing in the past, then the present. But that didn't really bother me. It's like a puzzle where you are given more and more parts. Although some parts are pretty predictable. But the emotions were played so nicely, that it became nice entertainment if you love family drama.",1384646400,,605,4.559633027522936
