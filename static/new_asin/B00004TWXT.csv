7923121,5,B00004TWXT,"How anyone can rate this DVD below a 4 or 5 is beyond me.  They must be blind!  Nine of the twelve girls are absolutely spectacular and the production values are perfect.  This was an amazing year and all but one of the girls are ""natural"".",1390953600,,240,4.173913043478261
7923122,3,B00004TWXT,"This seemed like another pretty average year with 2 mid-level stand-outs.  Jodi Ann Paterson is an all around hottie for sure.  Nicole Lenz has a great face & hair.  Her all natural almost total lack boobs still looks better than a lot of the implants on the DVD as well.  I can't say either girl is a strong enough reason to buy this DVD over other years given the all around mediocrity of the majority of the girls.  There are def. better years to get than this.

My biggest complaint is that  of the girls end up in bed with a guy caressing/kissing them.  It's still pretty tame which is good but the guys really only serve to block the view of the girls.  That's the lame part.

As usual, that's just my opinion.",1272585600,,716,4.276119402985074
7923123,2,B00004TWXT,"Playboy's 2001 Video Playmate Calendar is one hour and thirty three minutes long and was released on video on October 17, 2000. Included in this video is mini 2001 Playmate calendar Zebrahead's music video Playmate of the Year; the ""uncensored"" version. In the video the ladies are topless early on the video and in clothe the rest of the video. Jodi Ann Paterson who is in the video does not bother to undress. So what you are getting is the censored uncensored version. The Playmates start off strong but after the Bernaola Twins, the nudity is mild at best; though it does try to rebound close to the end. Here is the order of the Playmates in this video.

Rebecca Scott\Miss January-Rebecca is fully nude 75% of the time in segment one. In segment two, Rebecca sings and is fully nude 10% of the time.
Carol and Darlene Bernaola \Misses February (Playmates of the Millennium)-The Beranaloa Twins are fully nude in segment one, the clothes stay on in segment two, fully nude in segment three and four, and full nudity 50% of the time in segment five.
Brande Roderick\Miss March (Playmate of the Year-2001)-Brande shows very little nudity in segment one and in segment two the clothes stay on 97% of the time.
Nicole Marie Lenz\Miss April-Nicole is topless and nude briefly; otherwise the clothes stay one in segment and in segment two she is fully nude 60% of the time.
Suzanne Stokes\Miss May-Suzanne is briefly nude in segment one and full nudity is hardly shown in segment two.
Jennifer Rovero\Miss June-Jennifer switches back and fourth from clothes on to full nudity in segment one and Jennifer is fully nude 40% of the time in segment two.
Brooke Richards\Miss July-Brooke is topless or shows full nudity 15% of the time in the beach segment. She is topless 25% of the time in the second segment.
Brooke Berry\Miss August-Brooke is nude more or less in segment one. She is nude 10% of the time in the second segment.
Kristi Cline\Miss September-Kristi is either topless, nude from the waist down, totally nude, or clothes on in segment one. Kristi strips down to full nudity in the sex phone segment.
Kimberly Spicer\Miss October-Kimberly shows full nudity most of the time in the car segment. Starting a few seconds into segment two, Kimberly is completely nude throughout the remainder of the segment.
Cara Wakelin\Miss November-Cara is fully nude 80% of the time in the nature segment and 90% of the time in segment two.
Jodi Ann Paterson\Miss December (Playmate of The Year-2000)-Jodi stays in her clothes 90% of the time in segment one and she is only fully nude 25% of the time in segment two.

With two Playmates of the Year being conservative about their nudity, it is no wonder that I am giving it a low score. Playboy's 2001 Video Playmate Calendar gets a D.",1222473600,,2777,4.747412008281573
7923124,4,B00004TWXT,"Overall, I enjoyed the video as I do most Playboy videos.

Some reviewers have stated that the video was not as good as they had expected (or hoped). Their principal complaint was that the director\editors cut too much nude material and replaced it with shots of fruit, a musical instrument, men, or something un-playmate-ish.  I agree. I don't like it when they do that either. However, that is the way Playboy is\has been for as long as I can remember; true of most Playboy videos, not simply limited to this one. Playboy thinks that they are adding class to the material by doing this.

Having said that, the girls of this video are all very beautiful. The DVD is longer than most and is peppered with *many* satisfying moments.

But, as with most Playboy videos, many times you only get a glimpse or a flash. That's why I rated it four stars. What a pity. The video had the potential to be great before the director\editor worked his magic and gave it more class.

Bottom line: If you are not disappointed by most Playboy videos, you probably won't be disappointed with this one.",1156982400,,1083,4.590673575129534
7923125,1,B00004TWXT,"Of coarse they do... look at the quality women they get.  But as for their video production team.... okay, Mr. Parker was exactly right.  Don't make the same mistake that I did and buy this video.  Playboy needs to finally recognize who their audience is and comprehend why we are buying the tape.  It is not so that we can appreciate the ridiculous symbolism.  Maybe they have to make it seem artsy in order to get these girls' clothes off, but I doubt it.  I think they are just wasting a lot of money.  If you normally buy these videos, like myself, make a statement this year and save your money (you are not missing anything).  It's time that Playboy gives us what we pay for.  They could at least keep the camara still for two seconds when there actually is nudity.  Plus, this is a bare-bones dvd.  Don't think that you will get a handful of ads for their other videos (like the 2000 calendar).  There is nothing but a slide show (pointless) and a music video (just plain bad).  How about adding data sheets and the playmates' monthly spread?  At least give us the ads back.  Last year's video was suprisingly good and this year's is nothing more than a waste of time and money.  I hope that I have been able to save somebody some money that I foolishly wasted.  p.s.  Is it just me or are all of the playmates starting to look the same= blonde and plastic.",975110400,21,1364,4.345238095238095
7923126,1,B00004TWXT,"Well, after last year's superb video I thought Playboy was finally taking a turn for the better in their video production.  Unfortunately, Playboy is back to their old tricks.  When will they stop messing around with trite symbolism and gaudy sets?  Needless to say, the girls are beautiful but you only see them as the camara swoops by them to focus on a candle or fountain or something lame like that.  Moreover, the women hardly even move.  It's like watching naked statues.  The director apparently told them to stand still with as little life in them as possible.  There are exceptions but they are few and far between.  It's nice that there are a few simulated sex scenes, but actually it appears that Playboy stopped trying to make it look convincing.  As expected, the couple barely moves and when the man touches the playmates breasts it almost seems like an accident.  Just grab them!  It's frustrating to watch a video with so much potential fail miserably because of misplaced priorities.  The priority in this film is to showcase the tacky sets, the horrible (yet familiar) soundtrack, while the women are placed in the background with the rest of the props.  Playboy needs to reinvent this boring style that we all grew tired of years and years ago.  The playmates and their fans deserve better.",973382400,20,1309,4.785714285714286
