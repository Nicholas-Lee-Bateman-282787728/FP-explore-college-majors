5553073,2,B00B2H4Y0M,"The only thing 3D about this film was that much of the backgrounds was done using computer animation.

This film by Italian horror veteran Dario Argento stars his daughter Asia this film has a relatively low budget of 5,600,000 Euros (aprox. US$7mil). The only two stars are a very old Rutger Hauer (as van Helsing) and as Dracula Thomas Kretschmann (from Hostel III).

There are some novel aspects to this film such as Dracula transforming from an owl, and also into a giant praying mantis (all computer generated)!! Whether the genre needed that kind of development is another question.

Miriam Giovanelli gets her top off a bit in this, but her role as Tania, the bride of Dracula is another novel development that wasn't needed.

5553074,4,B00B2H4Y0M,"This import blu ray of Dario Argento's Dracula contains both the 3D-2D versions of the film on one disc. The film is in English with french subtitles only, while the 2 extra 15 and 45 min documentaries are in Italian and contain no subs.  What you get here is meandering, laconic adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula with some surprises the least of which is that the 3D is quite good is quite clearly how the film was meant to be seen.  Sets and costumes all appear ripped from a Hammer film as do many of the dialogue heavy scenes that bookend the action, the matte backgrounds bring to mind Browning's original.  I am not sure what the rating is on this but there is nudity and some gore along with some decent CG and some unfinished looking and laughable CG.  Simonetti's theremin heavy score feels oddly out of place in a good way however and there is an extra 5 min video featuring him playing the difficult instrument.  This adaptation seems to want to pay homage to the many stage versions that are so much a part of Dracula's lore and does so successfully.",1370995200,5,1064,4.463917525773196
5553075,5,B00B2H4Y0M,"It's awful. Terrible, God-awful. Dreadful. Rotten... And lots and ltos of fun. It's so bad it's good. I was laughing the entire time. It's the Plan 9 from Outer Space of Dracula movies.  It's brilliant!

  And then when Abraham Van Helsing shows up it's priceless. He randomly breaks into Lucy's house instead of knocking. Then he breaks into a blacksmith's shop and kills a guy for coming into the shop. Now for all Van Helsing knew it could have been the blacksmith, we the audience knew it was one of Dracula's minion, but he didn't. And he impale's the guy's head on something sharp hanging on the wall. In fact he kills at least two humans. And we already know the town's economy is dependent on Dracula. And it has such great likes as ""Thank god I had enough garlic for that bullet."" You mean the fact that it was silver meant nothing?!

  And there's the head scratching moment of when Mina says to Dracula ""You killed Lucy!"" and he says ""I gave her eternal life."" So she switches gears ""You killed Jonathan!"" and he says ""He was in the way."" Dafuq?! You made him a vampire too! Why did you just lie!??

  Oh, yes, and there's a scene where Dracula turns into a seven foot tall mantis which is why my friends and I have nicknamed this movie Mantis-Drac.  I love this movie.",1370822400,5,1280,4.427350427350428
5553076,3,B00B2H4Y0M,"I searched the IFC website and this is not on their books so it seems we are stuck with these English Language Italian dvds. The color and clarity are good and the storytelling remains within Eastern Europe, but somehow there is no spark within this film. The cast portray their characters the same as Bram Stoker's Dracula, with the exception of Asia Argento who plays Lucy as the opposite of Sadie Frost. But where the 2 films differ completely is in the amount of blood and flesh on show. The only naked scene that is any good is the very first one, so make the most of it cos it's all you're getting. The blood count is down on anything Argento has done this century, and I hope he hasn't jumped ship and joined the Mary Whitehouse camp. The only reason I am not slamming this feckless cow of a film out of hand is that it is an Italian U and so may be cut, although there is no obvious visible or audible sign of this. Italy has a 14 and an 18, so I suppose a U is the only solution because it may well be that the prime age group for this movie turns out to be 13. Come on all you gorehouds, in the 60s and 70s there used to be millions of us and the theaters didn't dare cut anything; these days we seem to get just too much fast editing and soft focus. This is advertised as 16/9 but is in fact 2.35.",1365984000,8,1308,4.054054054054054
8561431,1,B00B2H4Y0M,"love Argento HATED this film, bad acting, bad CGI, BAD special effects, Rutger Hauer was the sole good thing in film, Hopefully Argento will make another good film alas this wasn't ONE of his best....",1521072000,,200,4.742857142857143
8561432,4,B00B2H4Y0M,A great retelling of the Dracula story. Thomas Kretschmann is an amazing Dracula in this one!,1485561600,,93,4.875
8561433,2,B00B2H4Y0M,"This bloodsucker comes from schlock-horror filmmaker Dario Argento. Rather than recreate some new basis for a Dracula film, Argento takes bits and pieces of Stoker's characters and just puts them in a new setting. Gone is the gothic castle in Transylvania and the long ocean voyage to England. Instead Dracula (a wooden Thomas Kretschmann) has a pretty decent updated castle in some little village in the Carpathians. The time is still the 1870's as near as I could determine but Lucy (Asia Argento) lives with her father, the village mayor. Harker (Unax Ugalde) comes from a nearby city to work for Drac as his librarian rather than being a real estate broker.

Evidently Dracula has some little arrangement with the village council (excluding the mayor) where nobody asks questions in return for what, not being a victim? Right off the bat (pun intended), we see the comely Tanja (Miriam Giovanelli) become the first victim. Not until after she does a little soft porn shuffle with a married man in a haystack. As she walks back home alone...at night...in the woods, you know what to expect. Yep she's attacked by the vampire disguised as...an owl! Yeah, Dracula is bored with bats and wolves and mist and likes to morph into flies, rats and get this, a giant bright green praying mantis. What have I gotten myself into here?

Mina (Marta Gastini), of course is Drac's ultimate objective as she is the spittin' image of his long departed original lover. Mina comes to the village from the nearby city looking for her husband, Harker who hasn't kept in touch. Rutger Hauer shows up 72 minutes into the 110 minute movie as Prof. Van Helsing and immediately goes to work dispatching people getting in his way.

I've never quite appreciated Argento's work and frankly get a little squirmy thinking about him directing his daughter's nude sex scenes. I refuse to fully dismiss the film, however bad it is (very). I thought the musical score wasn't too bad. Kind of a throwback to the 60's. At least it added to the non-existent tension. The sets were fine - no scratch that - terrible. The 3-Dness was acceptable and not a distraction. But even the nudity isn't a big draw. The script is terrible and the acting is just horrible. Yeah, it's all pretty bad.

The 3-D Blu ray is fairly cheap to buy (Best Buy) and isn't a bad transfer either. I only watched the 3-D but did watch just a bit of 2-D for comparison. The 3-D doesn't add a lot but the colors are fine. The contrast and detail are excellent as well. As with all 3-D, the picture looks a bit darker, but I didn't find that a big problem. Perhaps because the lighting was consistently boring in the film. The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and an optional LPCM 2.0. The cast is comprised of mostly Italian actors and it was evident most were dubbed in with English or American accents. Some of the dubbing looked and sounded just fine. Others just not. The audio is actually very good with plenty going on in the surrounds. There are Spanish and English SDH options. Extras include a 1 hour + ""Behind the Scenes,"" a music video, and a couple trailers.",1396656000,,3108,4.6454545454545455
8561434,2,B00B2H4Y0M,an insect/dracula? really?? how sad. this movie could have been great if not for that scene...that really blew it for me,1390867200,,120,4.761904761904762
8561435,4,B00B2H4Y0M,"While's it's not an Academy Award winning film, it plays homage to so many horror movies. Creepy music, sappy dialogue, cheesy but effective effects and what seems to be an attempt at old school stereoscopic 3D (which as times made me go cross-eyed trying to watch - maybe something was out of line in the transfer). I did enjoy this movie. The 4 stars is for all those b-movie loving people out there. Great cinematography, sets and costumes. It really took me back to those campy Dracula movies that I really loved.

NOTE: The disc does work in the US. I had no problem viewing it with my Panasonic Blu-ray 3D player.",1383523200,,619,4.526785714285714
8561436,4,B00B2H4Y0M,"This telling of Dracula is clearly Dario's.  His fascination with books and their secrets is present in the adaptation of Harker as a librarian.  Everything about this version says: ""Dario Argento"".  No, this is not the classic film style of his youth.  Though, his infusion of strange and even simple film styles and his masterful use of color are clearly present.  If you watch this version as a double feature with the Hammer version of Dracula, Horror of Dracula - 1957, then you will see that Dario made a masterful version of Dracula... just a lovely and modern version of a true classic.  He did over use the CG effects and that is the only reason I knock off one star.",1382918400,4,676,4.545454545454546
8561437,5,B00B2H4Y0M,"It was hard to judge if this movie was to be any good from the lack of advertising and half and half reviews but as an Argento fan I had to get this bluray version and it turns out my gut instinct was right as it is brilliant, once again Argento makes another classic movie to add to his large range of horrors and thrillers over the years, this movie has been made to look as if it could have been done many years ago, the cast is great and the story follows in much the same as most Dracula movies, there is as usual some strong bloody gore and violence and plenty nudity, as usual as like most Argento movies some of the acting can be a tad cheesy but it adds to the charm most of the time, same with the effects, some are very cool, the gore is great, a couple are questionable like the giant preying mantis, but it does not spoil the film, its great fun from start to finish and a must for fans, this import version is region free ABC and is in English language, it has a few small features not in English.",1382313600,,1011,4.034825870646766
8561438,4,B00B2H4Y0M,"pourquoi toujours critiquer le travail de dario argento?bon film  avec un dracula tout en retenue(sauf pendant les attaques bien sur)!la 3d n est pas mal non plus!

8561439,4,B00B2H4Y0M,"I must say that when I approached this movie, I took very small and cautious steps based on the fact that the movie never got picked up for distribution here in the States and that it mostly got ridiculed by most reviewers.

I'm glad I got the chance to see it as I don't think it's bad at all. It's probably Dario Argento's most consistent film in a while! It's not as bad as per say Mother of all Tears and Do you Like Hitchcock? (Hitchcock himself must've been rolling over in his grave with that homage!) and it's obviously not as good as his classics although it can still be argued whether Suspiria is really a great movie or not. But at least this one is definitely not at the level of Cat O'Nine Tails, Tenebrae, Deep Red, The Bird With The Crystal Plumage and even Opera.

Although it's based on Bram Stoker's Dracula, I would say it's more loosely based. Dario Argento re-works the story to his vision on this one. It works overall. Also the effects were pretty good with the exception of one particular scene that I'm thinking with a giant grasshopper that made the whole film jump from being a horror flick to pretty much a comedy flick! It just looked ridiculous. But compared to some of his previous latest films, it wasn't so bad. Thomas Kretschmann was good playing the lead role as Count Dracula.

Overall, it's an entertaining film and worth watching if you're into Dario Argento. It could be interesting for those who are vampire-obsessed.",1378771200,3,1458,4.5361216730038025
8561440,4,B00B2H4Y0M,"Italian horror master Dario Argento sexy, gory version of Dracula doesn't follow the book very much (in this version, Jonathan Harker is a librarian, hired to put order to the old books of the count), but it is a watchable effort, reminiscent of the low budget British made horror films of the 1960s and 1970s. The most intriguing thing in the movie is the patently artificial, cardboard settings. The effect is eerie.  Argento's direction is fine, though a psychologist would surely tell us why he would want to film his daughter Asia in the nude (she plays Lucy Westenra in the movie). On the down side, the acting is mostly stilted. German actor Thomas Kretschmann is Dracula; he has been fine in other movies, but he lacks charisma here as the Count (he has one great scene, though, taking on five or six people at the same time). Only the veteran Dutch actor Rutger Hauer is fine playing Van Helsing, though he appears only on the final 20 minutes.",1377648000,,953,4.6390532544378695
