1918711,4,B0000CDL3Y,"I first heard about this film before it came out, as I am an Eddie Izzard fan.  Disappointingly, it was in such a narrow release, that there wasn't a single theater for 200 miles playing it -- not even in Dallas!  Then it closed out very quickly and took nearly 6 months to come out on DVD.  Needless to say, I was rather anxious about the possible quality of the film.
I was not disappointed.  The film was great!  With my degree in history (concentration in fashion), I'm one to sit through an entire film (like, oh, Gladiator) and complain about the accuracy.  This was spectacular!  The clothes were great, even the hideous ""formal"" that LeBlanc wears in one scene.  It's attrocious but it's not wrong.  And I too noticed the ""I'm 21"" line.  Keep in mind that the drinking age varied from state to state until the late 70s/early 80s.  And that the voting age at that time was 21.  My mother informs me that when she was in college in 1960, the drinking age in OK had just been changed the year before from 21 to 18.  So, it is possible that is not an inaccuracy...
I will agree that LeBlanc is a weak point to this film and that I would have liked to see more of the transformation time (a la Miss Congeniality).  But, I have watched this film twice already and I expect to watch it many more.  If you're willing to stop thinking about what could be improved and take the film for itself, it's a fantabulous time.  If you can't, well, make your list and watch it twice.",1073952000,5,1473,4.301818181818182
1918712,2,B0000CDL3Y,"Take four British blokes, toss in one American, put them all in dresses, toss vigorously with a thin plot to infiltrate a female factory in WWII Germany to steal a secret machine called the ""Enigma"", and you have an excellent opportunity to entertain.  Unfortunately, that opportunity was missed in this movie during their attempt at ""Some like it Hot"" humor.  Had we seen a better transformation of the guys, or seen more than five minutes of it, it might have been more palatable, but not so.  Eddie Izzard is the only highlight to this movie, who's job it is to transform three gruff-looking men into passable women to pull off their mission...a task he admits to failing several times in the film.  I had to agree.
Buy this one to see Eddy, or listen to the flawlessly spoken German, or even because you're a fan of Matt LeBlanc, but don't buy it with the idea that you will watch it again and again, because you won't.",1070150400,3,923,4.542168674698795
1918713,4,B0000CDL3Y,"ALL THE QUEEN'S MEN could have easily fallen into the ranks of the ""let's dress men in drag for laughs"" films that followed  THE BIRDCAGE and  usually end up being unfunny and at times less than dignified slapstick.  With excellent direction from Stefan Ruzowitzky and a strong ensemble of actors this film about the Brits sending a team of men to capture the Enigma machine from a Nazi factory that only employs women in Berlin (hence the need to be in drag) succeeds with grace and warmth and tenderness -  and humor.  Eddie Izzard is hilarious as a cross-dressing entertainer who is assigned the duty of transforming a team of macho guys into credible women (which he succeeds in doing!).  The team is ably led by Matt LeBlanc and includes David Birkin and James Cosmo, each with their own personal stories that make the story more believable.  Their 'contact' is the German spy Nicolette Krebitz and with her help and a lot of surprises the mission is 'accomplished'.  Yes, this is a comedy with many good belly laughs, but it also is a tender rendering of how men and women (and children) relate under the stresses of war.  The cinematography is first class without blowing the story out of real proportion.  Recommended for the whole family.",1069891200,15,1247,4.731481481481482
1918714,5,B0000CDL3Y,I caught this movie on TV  about half way through and started to change it but I just wasn't quite sure what I had here and decided to finish it.  I am so glad I did.  A war comedy with a couple twists and a half. The male heroes go into Germany pretending to be women.  Not that they fool that many people but they do get the job done and leave you laughing till you hurt.,1383091200,,373,3.8051948051948052
1918715,4,B0000CDL3Y,I bought thus movie as gift for my kids as they are avid Eddie Izzard fans. Everyone in my family enjoyed watching it over the holidays.,1359936000,,136,4.269230769230769
1918716,5,B0000CDL3Y,"In this World War II comedy, several British men led by Matt LeBlanc's character, O'Rourke, go behind German lines to steal an Enigma machine. Because the factories in Germany are being worked solely by women, they must all go in drag. Eddie Izzard's character, Tony Parker, is a dream. If you enjoy Eddie Izzard's comedy, you will enjoy this sweet, unpretentious movie.

Matt LeBlanc gets the straight-man role, literally. He has to shepherd this unlikely group consisting of an unsuccessful spy (LeBlanc), a pencil-pushing temporary major (James Cosmo), Izzard's primadona drag queen and a code-breaking genius (David Birkin) into Germany to pass as women factory workers. You might remember David Birkin from Star Trek: The Next Generation. He played Picard as an adolescent in the episode ""Rascals"".

For me, the fun comes from remembering Eddie Izzard's description from his stand-up routines, of how if only we would use them, men in drag could throw off the enemy's concentration when parachuting down to war. Izzard describes it, and then he gets to do it! Big fun! I imagine that Izzard enjoyed making this movie. He gets to sing, wear fun costumes and speak in several languages, including German. Overall, the movie is fun as well as funny. Enjoy!",1353110400,,1258,5.072463768115942
1918717,4,B0000CDL3Y,"Really, pretty good, despite a typical, subpar performance by Matt Leblanc---I am a huge Eddie Izzard fan---he can do no wrong.",1348185600,,127,5.095238095238095
1918718,1,B0000CDL3Y,This movie is painfully flat.  It ought to be great and i am usually a fan of Matt LeBlanc but he doesn't do the period stuff very well.  He's just not suited for it.  Sorry.  Eddie Izard on the other hand is terrific.,1330473600,,218,4.0
1918719,4,B0000CDL3Y,"It's difficult to imagine how on earth anyone raised money to get this movie made, but I'm glad they did. It's not a comedy, it's not a WWII drama, it's an off-beat quirky study of human nature that doesn't have a standard Hollywood central theme, character arcs, or overcoming-adversity motif.  It's a silly sort of film, but contains lots of small moments that are poignant, interesting, and definitely Euro-centric.

If you enjoy movies ""just because"" but you can manage to live without standard Hollywood cliches, then this is a diverting couple of hours.",1300492800,,559,5.0
1918720,4,B0000CDL3Y,"This movie was made when Matt LeBlanc was a bigger star than Eddie Izzard, someone who is familiar with dressing up in women's clothing. LeBlanc really doesn't make a convincing woman and neither do the others in this WW II farce about what was known as a ""poof"" brigade. I don't know if these actually existed, or if the machine the men in the movie, did, either. However, there are some performances by notable stars, both English and German. You may want to watch this movie with the subtitles on, since you need to understand German to comprehend some of it. If you like British comedy, then you'll like this movie. If not, you might want to skip it.",1288396800,,654,4.504201680672269
1918721,5,B0000CDL3Y,I was not very impressed with this movie.  It was not very funny and it seemed to drag on forever.,1256688000,,98,3.9
1918722,3,B0000CDL3Y,I got this video just to see Eddie and I wasn't disappointed. It was worth it just to see him walk around in sling-backs and seemed stockings. The man has great legs.,1200700800,,166,4.21875
1918723,5,B0000CDL3Y,"""All the Queen's Men"" is far far better than it should be.  The acting on all levels (especially Matt LeBlanc) is simply enchanting and situation perfect.  The topic (locating the Enigma machine during WWII); the plan: (dress in drag to infiltrate the only German manufacturing plant making these machines whose workforce must be the women left behind).  The funny and the fear here are mixed wonderfully.  The supporting cast is dead-on...this is a movie, again, that is far far better than it should be.  I don't watch many films over and over...but this is one that gets a pretty good workout when the hour is late, the mind is still buzzing and one needs to remember that great things can be accomplished by incredibly ordinary people.",1194998400,2,739,4.833333333333333
1918724,4,B0000CDL3Y,Matt LeBlanc makes an incredibly ugly woman. Eddie's not that cute either. But the movie's a riot. If this was the war movie that Joey made on FRIENDS Chandler would not have fallen asleep.,1175472000,,189,4.588235294117647
1918725,1,B0000CDL3Y,"All the Queen's Men was quite a disappointment considering the presence of Matt LeBlanc and James Cosmo among others!

The acting is all right (but nothing great), the plot is below average, while the dialogues/lines are way beyond ""below average!"" What a waste of talent!  A shame really...

The movie starts off well and then goes into ""gay"" gear.  No further comments are needed.  Nothing to see here...  Move along...",1157500800,3,421,4.942857142857143
1918726,3,B0000CDL3Y,"There are only two reasons to watch ""All the Queen's Men"":  Eddie Izzard as a bisexual drag queen and Scotland's James Cosmo as an older family man and inadvertent mommy.  Izzard is both funny and touching as a man who will go to any length to be with his love, and Cosmo is downright heart-tugging (in an honest way) as he uncovers emotions he would've never encountered under normal circumstances.

Matt LeBlanc is badly miscast as Bruce Campbell, er, Special Services Agent O'Rourke.  It's a pity he has no charm in this role, nor does he have any chemistry with the equally wooden Nicollete Krebitz.  Rent it, if only to see how damn good Eddie Izzard can be as an actor, and how James Cosmo displays such wonderfully subtle emotion, especially in the German bombing scene.  If the whole movie had been as excellent as that one scene, it may have lasted a LOT longer in the theaters.",1118620800,5,887,4.582278481012659
1918727,2,B0000CDL3Y,"""Running, jumping, climbing trees...putting on make-up when you get there"" is how Eddie Izzard describes his life as an Action Transvestite.  And it's true, in this movie, you get to see Eddie running around in heels and a gown, carrying a big gun.  In all honesty, he is the most skilled, of the cast, in heels and dresses.  And it seems like the perfect combination of major topics from his show ""Dressed to Kill,"" World War II and Nazi Germany, Great Britain defending itself, slap dash army make-up, there are even shades of ""The Great Escape.""

But this movie is definitely a ""renter.""  I don't care how much you love Eddie Izzard, don't buy it.  Matt LeBlanc is tepid at best, and there's not enough time devoted to the supporting cast to save the film.  Interesting in its own way, but even bargain basement prices couldn't entice me.",1118102400,5,841,4.641891891891892
1918728,3,B0000CDL3Y,"I bought this DVD from the previously-viewed bin at my local video store. The only reason I picked it up was for Eddie Izzard. The fact that Matt LeBlanc was in it scared me. I found that the movie, though full of plot holes, was actually much better than I feared. For fans of Eddie Izzard, it definitely is worth watching, and I would also say it is worth buying, if you can get it used.",1111536000,5,389,4.131578947368421
1918729,1,B0000CDL3Y,"Not a normal reviewer of movies, but after sitting through the entire film, felt the need to express in return for the money I spent.

This movie is bad from start to finish.  For a comedy it is not funny, and as a war movie / drama it is fatally flawed.  Starting with the opening scene in which the LeBlanc charachter plays an OSS officer who has his stolen Enigma machine destroyed by the Brits because they think it is a typewritter and it is not allowed to have German office supplies.  Then they throw him in the British stockade because he bit a British officer.  I can think of 40 different ways that you could have put LeBlancs' character with the Brits and this was not one of them.

Speaking of LeBlanc - he is AWFUL!  He is still playing the same character from Lost in Space.  Back to the story line.  So then lets put his character behind enemy lines in Berlin where he does not speak German.  Lets pretend he / she is Italian.  Wait - he also does not speak Italian. Lets have the old Brit Sargent hide in the back of a car during a party - but never explain why or use his character through the whole scene.

Lets wrap it up with a clever escape from a German airfield.  All of the planes scramble for some reason - including the transport planes. Not sure how a German transport plane can shoot down a B-17, but they were in a hurry to fly off with the fighters.  There is one transport plane on the ground that the germans can start.  LeBlanc over powers the crew and starts the plane right up.  Only then when taking off do the Germans appear from the barracks to shoot at the plane while taking off. This of course after a 10 minite gun battle and explosions that they must have been sleeping through.

This film has no redeeming values, unless you like to hear Eddie Izzard sing in drag.  It is just plain bad.",1095552000,3,1831,4.242774566473988
1918730,3,B0000CDL3Y,"All The Queen's Men isn't a bad movie but it isn't a very good one either.  It's kind of like an extended sitcom that picks up nicely at the end and in so doing redeems itself a little bit. It's a fairly simple story about a team of spies who go undercover as women in Nazi Germany to steal a codebreaking device.  Obviously most of the humor comes from the cross-dressing concept but it actually does provide somewhat of a clever action plot once the plan gets under way.
Eddie Izzard is great as always in a role that seems to be tailor-made for him.  Matt LeBlanc is funny but it's hard to believe that anyone would ever be convinced that he's a woman.  And not for nothing, but how can this man be a spy inside Germany when he doesn't speak German?
What's frustrating and ultimately detracting from the film is that there are numerous opportunities for sub-plots and themes that would add enormously to the story but they are not used to full advantage, except for the one involving Izzard's character's German male lover.  There are some isolated moments of cleverness involving the mission, typical of what you would see in a well-crafted action film.
There are a handful of laugh-out-loud moments but don't set your expectations too high.",1085616000,21,1245,4.615384615384615
1918731,5,B0000CDL3Y,"I really liked this movie; I know others might have found it dumb and stupid and all that stuff, but I really really liked it.  As far as I am concerened, the best character was Tony (Eddie Izzard's character), but then again, his being in the movie was the soul reason why I bought it.
If you like this kind of humor, than I suggest you at least rent it to see if you like it, but if not, rent it anyways!  Give this movie a chance I think; it's very odd humor.",1080000000,7,462,3.956989247311828
1918732,4,B0000CDL3Y,"It depends on what you are expecting going in. A war thriller it is not, and not really a comedy in the sense that most people would think. If you are a fan of Eddie Izzard, you will love it. He is very funny in his role, and i would buy the DVD based solely on his musical number in the film.",1078012800,11,293,3.7419354838709675
1918733,3,B0000CDL3Y,"All the Queens Men is worth seeing, although I don't think you'll want to watch it over and over, which is the reason I don't give it many stars or an enthusiastic recommendation to buy it.
Matt LeBlanc's acting is fine, I'd say its just the role leave a lot to be desired.  I'm sure some people will watch the film just to see Matt LeBlanc in drag.  Hey, it is what it is!
If you go into this movie seeking precise historical accuracy you will be dissapointed.  It is a cute World War II story, and shows how people relate under dire circumstances, particularly in the scene where they flee for the bomb shelters.  Just like ""Life Is Beautiful"", I think society is at a point where we can discuss hard issues like World War II in a context that is a little light hearted, but doesn't take away from the human context of the serious situations.",1077580800,3,844,4.322784810126582
