6704033,5,B00O28CD6A,"I agree it is graphically violent and may not be for those who prefer their mysteries to be more about sleuthing and less to do with crime...but if you are interested in complicated crime solving, don't give up on these.  The acting is superb, gritty and very realistic, and captures your attention and keeps you going to find out just what really has happened.  In our case one of our family members has difficulty with British accents and modern British English, and prefers to see the synopses before watching the episodes as it gives a little structure to what is being seen,  I've watched the episodes both ways with and without previews and synopsis, and I tend to agree with Mr. Hamm that they can be a bit of a spoiler for the seasoned British crime drama fan.  In any event, this is on par with the earlier series Prime Suspect, and if you were a fan of that series you will certain appreciate Above Suspicion.  Definitely not for children, they may find it boring as the series relies more on developing plot than action hero type scenes.  Ciaran Hinds is amazing, and Kelly Reilly as Anna Travis gives a deep and well thought out performance.",1422748800,13,1153,4.572815533980583
6704034,5,B00O28CD6A,"ABOVE SUSPICION COMPLETE COLLECTION. (2009-13). From Lynda La Plante, creator of PRIME SUSPECT, the British mystery television series that was a massive worldwide hit, comes ABOVE SUSPICION, another British television series made by ITV that is based on the bestselling work of the former cop. In this value-packed collection, Set 1 is based on the crime novel ABOVE SUSPICION; Set 2, on THE RED DAHLIA and DEADLY INTENT, Set 3, on  SILENT SCREAM. The author also served as screenwriter on the series.  The police procedural appears to be set in the current day, in London, as the cop shop on which it focuses is assigned to the London Metropolitan, better known as the Met. The entertainment has been called ""a younger, sassier successor to PRIME SUSPECT"" by The Telegraph of London. The series ran in the U.K. for four seasons, 2009-13, but has not been seen in North America.  This boxed DVD set  of four discs gives us four feature-length mysteries running  approximately 532 minutes plus meet the cast (24 minutes),  conversations with cast, crew and LaPlante (37 minutes) , a behind the scenes featurette for DEADLY INTENT(10 mins.),  photo galleries and more.  Also, a warning, for mature audiences only, contains violence and coarse language. And, thank goodness, and let me blow a kiss to RLJ Entertainment and Acorn, who have released the set; subtitles, or else what would those of us on this side of the pond do with that quick London cross-chat?  The production is also available in streaming format.  I received this as a review copy.

One her first day on the job, rookie detective Anna Travis (played by rising star Kelly Reilly, BLACK BOX, SHERLOCK HOLMES) throws up at a crime scene and faints at a postmortem. Does she have what it takes to succeed in policing, still mostly a man's world?  With the veteran Ciarn Hinds (GAME OF THRONES; TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY) as DCI Langton, her brusque boss.  There's no question but that Hinds has developed into a middle-aged actor with the chops and the gravitas to carry the series, and that he and Reilly, unusually beautiful even among  beautiful actresses, with her lush body and fine featured face, produce smoldering chemistry.  The elements of the cop shop seem accurately portrayed; the script and photography are sharp and hard-edged.  Somehow the gorgeous Reilly does not seem out of place in the precinct, perhaps because, or in spite of the fact that it is not universally peopled by pretty boys and girls, as an American detective show would be.  The acting is uniformly fine, with appearances from some well-known British supporting players, including old-timer Sylvia Syms; Simon Williams, who played the son in the beloved UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS; Sara Stewart, (PHILOMENA), and Julian Sands, (A ROOM WITH A VIEW).

The episodes are, with thanks to Acorn:
Series 1, Disc 1: Above Suspicion
Part 1
For eight years, someone has been murdering women, following the same brutal ritual each time. The most recent victim doesn't fit the profile, but evidence links her to the others. Anna volunteers to go undercover to crack the case.

Part 2
Langton allows Anna to spend an evening at the ballet with the prime suspect, a handsome actor on the brink of stardom. A discovery at the place where one of the victims lived helps Anna set a trap. Meanwhile, sparks fly between Anna and Langton.

Disc 2: The Red Dahlia
Part 1
A young woman's body is found by the Thames, horribly mutilated and drained of blood. It's exactly like the famously unsolved Black Dahlia murder that happened in Los Angeles--in 1947. When Anna's senior officer, DCI Morgan, falls ill, Langton steps in.

Part 2
After a second victim is discovered, Anna gets too close to a journalist that the copycat killer has involved in the case. When an angry Langton suspends her, Anna has her own reasons to regret the attachment. A prime suspect is identified, but he seems to have an alibi.

Part 3
An anonymous tip leads Anna and Langton to a deeply troubled family with long-buried secrets, a vain and arrogant father, and a fiercely protective housekeeper. When the murderer is cornered, the case takes a shocking final turn.

Series 2: Deadly Intent
Part 1
In London, ex-cop Frank Brandon is shot dead in a drug den; his glamorous widow, Julia, is strangely unmoved. With little help from her distracted supervisor, despite Langton's orders, Travis goes in search of the truth.

Part 2
As the body count rises, Langton acknowledges that Travis may be on to something. The detectives get a confession about the Frank Brandon shooting, but the other murders remain unsolved. An international drug lord seems poised to introduce a new drug to the U.K.

Series 3: Silent Scream
Part 1
Hot young film star Amanda Delany is murdered; DCS Langton is called in to lead the investigating team. He wants to solve the case quickly to get back on his career track. DI Anna Travis is assigned to the team; she interviews possible suspects including several of Delany's former lovers.

Part 2
Anna learns that Amanda had found a publisher for a tell-all book, so the list of suspects grows even longer. Langton visits Travis at home late one night; it's obvious that there are unresolved matters between them. The team finds and views CCTV footage from the night of the murder; a fight breaks out at Amanda's funeral.

Part 3
It is not clear what the motive for Amanda's murder might have been, so it is not easy to focus on any one suspect. But the situation clarifies as the team goes about its business.

Well, there's no question but that, in addition to the superb PRIME SUSPECT, LaPlante is capable of producing  weak work: see the TV series BELLA MAFIA, or the novel ROYAL FLUSH ( AKA: ROYAL HEIST).  And this is an undeniably commercial production that sometimes leans to the gothic. It  is hardly set among real folk: 2 episodes feature actors, one features an insanely rich powerful man of high station, and another the usual superman international drug dealer.  Even so, the scripts are thrilling, tense, taut, full of twists and turns while featuring a number of cleanly-drawn characters. The two stars have robust, convincing chemistry. We found the show absorbing,  gobbled up all the episodes quick as we  could.  When LaPlante is good, she is GOOD.  Get it and see.",1420243200,19,6304,4.853408029878618
6704035,5,B00O28CD6A,"When DCI James Langton (Ciaran Hinds) takes on rookie DC Anna Travis (Kelly Reilly), he's doing her dead father (a former colleague) a favor. She can't even wear the right footwear to a muddy crime scene. But soon he finds out that she's got some of her father's smarts about her. She notes things his detective team has missed.

In the opening episode, Langton's team is investigating a series of murders, grisly murder scenes (think maggots etc.), which have baffled police. What's best about this series, aside from the two main actors - Hinds and Reilly - is that the investigation is fast paced. If you've ever shouted at your T.V. telling the detectives what to do before they think of it, this time they are as smart as you are.

Didn't think this series needed as much gore as was shown.  5 stars or more for acting, dialogue, pace etc. I add an extra star for any show that Ciaran Hinds is in as I like him that much. Reilly is equally suited for her role as the new rookie who wants to be appreciated for her intelligence.  But really didn't care for the violent flashbacks, gross crime scenes etc. So, be warned if they upset you. This is based upon Lynda La Plante's mystery novels.  Characters were throwing up during the show - you may feel like doing it, too, looking at some of the gory corpses, so be warned. This may be a 5-star show for those with strong stomachs. 4.5 stars",1419811200,12,1393,4.447058823529412
6704036,5,B00O28CD6A,"Above Suspicion was a crime  series which aired on the British commercial ITV network beginning in 2009. Well it wasn't exactly a series as we know it. The first film was a two-part, two hour show titled Above Suspicion based on a Linda La Plante novel (she was the author of Prime Suspect which introduced Helen Mirren to US audiences, and she is an industry unto herself.). This was followed by a second two-hour, two-part film in 2010 base on another La Plante novel with the same characters. The next two films were 2  hour, three-part stories. And then the series was cancelled. NOTE: This is not a spoiler alert because nearly all loose ends are tied up in the end.

The show never aired on US TV and is being released in the US for the first time as The Complete Collection by Acorn. I loved it.

I want to warn those who do not like graphic violence that this may not be for them.  And there is graphic language but most crime shows have that.

I see two reviews up already. (I based mine on a set provided by Acorn for review.) One of them spends a lot of time on the plot of each episode. I never quite understand how that can be beneficial in a mystery; the less you know the better. In the case of this DVD set I have a few more recommendations for those who want to enjoy the mystery the most. Before each episode (4 each for Set  1 and 3 for Sets 2 and 3) there is a plot summary.  You can read if you want but it contains SPOILERS. Even more important is that, just before the credits in each episode there is a series of Next on Above Suspicion clips. STOP the DVD player at this point.  There are way too many spoilers there.
The acting is great and, if you have watched the BBC series The Paradise on PBS, youll find it interesting to see Joanna Vanderham (who played the shop girl Clara in The Paradise) as a sexy promiscuous movie star in Above Suspicion Set 3.

Each Set contains Bonus features with interviews. There is no reason to list them here. Amazon has listed them in the description on the product page. But DO NOT WATCH any before you watch the show. They all contain SPOILERS.
So, yes, I can recommend this to anyone who likes British crime mysteries.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6704037,5,B00O28CD6A,"A great price for ABOVE SUSPICION COMPLETE COLLECTION. It's a box set of previously released DVDs, but if it's new to you, this is the way to go.
ABOVE SUSPICION raised the bar for realistic crime scenes, morgue, and victim visuals. It is so realistic, it can put off weaker viewers. DC Anna Travis (Kelly Reilly -Poldark: Series 2) is a hot female cop and atrocity reality turns her gut too. Lovely Reilly plays the role so well, sassy, wanting to be best, but makes gaffs. DCI Langton (Ciaran Hinds -Amazing Grace) heads the team. If you can stand graphic scenes, you'll also see good acting by regulars and guest stars of this gritty London crime, by author/screenplay writer/producer Lynda La Plante.

Subtitles provided.
=== ABOVE SUSPICION: 114 min. Travis goes undercover to end murder carnage. Jason Durr & John Savident guest.
=== THE RED DAHLIA: 140 min. Based on real story, body halved and mutilated is an old case that may now be a copycat. Guests: Simon Williams (Upstairs Downstairs); Sylvia Syms (The Queen); Edward MacLiam.
=== DEADLY INTENT: 138 min. Bestselling thriller of Lynda La Plante opens with a Mexican doctor doing a realistic facelift. Ugh! Ex-cop killed in a crack house leaves wife Julia (Stine Stengade) unfazed. Deaths rise, is Julia next?, a drug cartel is involved, how?
=== SILENT SCREAM: 2 1/3hr. And scream YOU may. Intense! Murdered film star Delany by Joanna Vanderham (The Paradise). Druggie flatmates include Felicity (Bryony Hannah -Call the Midwife) and Jeannie (Kate O'Flynn). Saraa Stewart (Philomena) is the actress's agent, with Geoff Bell (War Horse) her driver. There is Danny Webb (Land Girls), Ray Fearon. . . . the list goes on.
=== LOTS OF BONUS TOO
UK unrated but definitely adult fare (with strong stomach) for graphic violence & images, nudity mostly prosthetic, and language. Even so, it's compelling thriller viewing.",1418860800,2,1876,5.012820512820513

The central characters are likeable and well-etched (although the relationship between Langton and Travis differs from the depiction in the novels). The plots are interesting and the twists are clever and plausible. The gender themes are subtly interwoven into the plots and I like this series because of the focus on the characters themselves. Their responses to the crimes investigated in each series develops our understanding of the characters themselves.

The acting is  Intelligent and there's an interesting subtheme about  young female police officer who is just starting out.  Her father (deceased) was also in officer, but instead of her  being treated in a friendly and inclusive way, the females are particularly catty and the men either ignore her at first or exclude  her.

8681569,1,B00O28CD6A,Disgusting is the very best thing I can say about it. I understand that actors need jobs but this was some bad trash. Next time they need to do Shakespeare in the park. I've seen Ciaran Hinds before. He should look for better material or find another job.,1526688000,,255,4.333333333333333

I would like to give it for the whole collection, however, as I'm watching this on the Acorn channel (ATTN:  FIRE STICK), I have been unable to access either season 3 or 4.  I'm assuming there is a glitch in the system.  I hope Amazon is able to fix it.  I'm sure the acting is just as stellar in the final seasons of this series!",1519084800,,376,3.96
