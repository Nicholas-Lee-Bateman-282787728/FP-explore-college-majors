  Connie's singing brought back old memories too, she sounded just like she did
  when she first came out.  A beautiful voice!!!

  I purchased this movie at Amazon, and it is well worth the purchase.",1328400000,2,281,4.352941176470588

4669800,2,B005EXA88C,"This is the third remake of ""Girl Crazy"" by ""cheapy"" producer Sam Katzman to cash in on Connie Francis. Harve Presnell, fresh off his ""Unsinkable Molly Brown"" appears completely lost in the proceedings. I don't know how long this movie took to make, but the diminutive Francis with the huge voice, shows marked weight fluctuations in many scenes. The studio that she helped support through her enormous record sells, put her on illegal diet pills (shades of Judy Garland).

The plot is nothing much to speak of. It never was and is given little support here about a rich Eastern womanizer who gets into trouble and is sent off to a small Nevada college. The great score remains intact and several new songs are added but does not enhance this musical in the slightest. I must admit the title theme sung by Connie Francis was more effective than some of the Gerswhin tunes warbled by other cast members. And Connie Francis is not a ""duet"" person, her voice is too commanding...she's better when she's singing solo.

All the performances are mediocre and much of this due to the terrible script and dialogue. But we do have the great Louis Armstrong on hand. He is the most enjoyable thing in the movie. Connie gives it her best (she does overact at times), but nothing can save this movie. Stick to the definitive Garland/Rooney version of ""Girl Crazy"".

I am glad to see all four movies made by Ms. Francis available for the first time on DVD. This should delight her fans, and appall serious movie buffs.

Another cheap marketing ploy to utilize the then reigning female songstress in the world. Connie they should have let you do all the singing in the movie as you did in the first three, and cut out Sam The Sham and Herman's Hermits. The score is just not suited for them.

4669822,4,B005EXA88C,"Connie Francis and Harve Presnell are an unlikely but charismatic pair in this, the third screen version of the Gershwin musical ""Girl Crazy""; which had been done so brilliantly by Judy & Mickey in 1943.  In this version - set in the 'modern day' (ie: 1960's), Presnell plays Danny Churchill, a young bachelor who decides to help his would-be girlfriend Ginger (Francis) and her gambling-addict father by turning their Reno property into a resort for accommodation-seeking divorcees.

It's all very fluffy and fun; you don't expect ""high drama"" in a film like this.  Connie Francis fills out the Judy role beautifully, singing the Gershwin standards in her own wonderful style.  Harve Presnell was coming off his big success in the film version of ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" and does well here too.  The visual of tall Harve and petite Connie  is just so endearing.  The tunestack is expanded in this ""Girl Crazy"" with additional numbers - unrelated to the original score - performed by the likes of Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs, the Standells, Louis Armstrong, Liberace, and Herman's Hermits.  It's almost like a ""Beach Party"", but with a slightly bigger budget and minus the Annette & Frankie gang.",1435190400,,1203,4.98

4669829,3,B005EXA88C,"Well this movie leaves a lot to be desired in a good movie musical script.  However, if you are a great fan of Connie's you enjoy seeing her in anything.  The story is weak, the sets cheap, the acting bad, but through it all there is Connie singing her heart out. There are some great Gershwin songs included.  The best scene in the entire movie is the opening title track with Connie singing ""When The Boys Meet the Girls"".  A classic rock song by long time writer Howie Greenfield (Where the Boys Are) sung as only Connie can.  It's fun in a throwback 60's, comedy way.  Connie was not an actress as she admits. MGM did their best to ring every dollar out of her, and they did.  She alone kept the studio afloat in the early 60's with the MGM record label and the millions of records she sold here and over seas.  I suggest you like connie or campy B rated 60's movies to buy this Connie movie.  Oh, shoot, get it anyway, its fun.",1375660800,2,932,4.220338983050848
4669830,5,B005EXA88C,"When The Boys Meet The Girls is a camp riot ! Connie Francis plays Ginger Gray who runs a dude ranch in Reno. I love it that Connie's films are now all available, and that 3 have Boys in the title. MGM knew the audience they were selling to in the 1960's. Connie  sings When The Boys Meet The Girls, Mail Call, Embraceable You, I Got Rhythm, and But Not For Me.  In this her last film Connie Francis keeps her fans happy. I am one !",1364169600,3,432,3.954022988505747

8469223,3,B005EXA88C,"A 5 Star Movie.

Sadly, they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type DVD-R disc.  VERY Good Movie Otherwise.

I completely understand that obscure movies like this may not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would have gladly paid a dollar or two more for an M-Disc that would last forever.  Instead, they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 5 - 7 years. A burnable M-Disc will last 100s of years.

This review is for the actual item I received from Amazon. If you are after a, Pure movie review"", I suggest you look at the International Movie Database. There you will find many reviews without regard to the delivery mechanism.

It appears this is accepted fare for Connie Francis, and her low-ball acting fits this film perfectly, although her vocals are acceptable.  The plot is silly, the acting well below par, and the inclusion of then current pop 'sensations' and oldtime performers, makes for dismal entertainment.",1480291200,,418,5.117647058823529
