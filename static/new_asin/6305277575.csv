The more I  have viewed the tape, as I  begin to unravel some of the mysteries of sound and technical jargon, the  more I realize the depth of information in this master.  Great tape!",924480000,4,358,4.53125
8451521,5,6305277575,"I was very pleased with this video. Mr. Swedien demystifies his wonderful techniques as though he were passing along the information to his legacy. I felt as though I received a fresh perspective on recording, and I have been  a professional recording engineer near 20 years. A great opportunity to  study at the feet of the master!",923184000,5,332,4.807017543859649
