4337971,3,B004EP42Y2,"This series looked good on the web page, but turned out to be A Dsappointment. Background noise prohibits hearing and understanding anything most of the actors said. Everyone talks at once on top of that. The screenplay seems disjointed and caused me to be confused as to what was going on. We quit watching them after the first 2 or 3. I'm not a person who is critical for the pleasure of it. We've watched a LOT of British Mystery dvds, and have found some difficult to understand, but this series stands out in that regard.

4337972,2,B004EP42Y2,"'Murder Investigation Team' is a spin-off 'The Bill' and begins with solving the murder of Sgt. Boyden. The casting in this show show just didn't work. The 2 female leads are embarrassingly bad -  no similarities to Cagney & Lacey. The supporting cast just seemed to go through the motions. It's hard to really put a finger on what was wrong with the ensemble, other than they just didn't work.  The stories were gritty, but also heavy-handed and predictable. This is possibly worth a rental if you are bored, have nothing else in your queue,  and want to watch an English cop show. However, there are much better shows out there, including 'The Bill.' I'd go with 'George Gently','Dalziel & Pascoe' or 'Lewis' before buying this. I own the DVD's and would love to get rid of them.",1312243200,24,781,4.644927536231884
4337973,4,B004EP42Y2,I am enjoying this new (to the US) British mystery. Cast is very good and the stories very intricate. The cast interacts well and that enhances your enterTainment.,1308268800,12,163,4.857142857142857
4337974,4,B004EP42Y2,"Very good plots, story lines and believable characters. Enjoyed the way the team worked together. If I have a criticism with the show it would be that the dialogue could have been a little livelier. All in all, though, a thumbs up.",1306800000,8,231,4.523809523809524
4337975,3,B004EP42Y2,"This is a very edgy series and I enjoyed the stories and action very much.  However, I'm not thrilled with the choice of actors, so I probably won't buy any further seasons.",1303948800,9,173,4.40625
4337976,5,B004EP42Y2,"Sometimes gruesome, always gritty, crime sleuth team. Realistic faced investigation struggles are dramatized. All cop stuff, only a hint at MIT individual lives outside of the investigations. Episodes are filled with police action, raids, chases and arrest struggles. Clue searching moves at a fast clip with false leads, new suspects, and dead ends. This team must dig for clues in the bowels of London society. Certainly not the scenic vistas of `Midsomer Murders' series. Drugs, incest, murder, rape, prostitution, mutilation and other things are seen which are not on the tourist brochures.
A crack team with women in the forefront. 2 beautiful ambitious female MIT leads, one nail tough, one a bit softer. A bit of a British ""Cagney & Lacey"" but with more raw & cruel crime.
A dialogue quotation is series descriptive: ""Forensics would like you to have a look at some vomit.""

Episode details, 49 min each, with SUBTITLES:
1 MOVING TARGETS
DI Vivien Friend (Samantha `Sam' Spiro) heads MIT (Murder Investigation Team) in a shooting case of a police Sgt. A second victim at the scene is a credit card thief. Who was the target? How much police involvement is associated with the duel deaths? Commentary option with episode 1.

2 DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL
A dead body of a 3-year missing girl is found in concrete. DI Friend is not so sure the obvious suspect is the truth.

3 RUBISH
A boy's body (minus its heart) is found in a refuse barge. The MIT finds some distasteful clues. There's more to this murder than meets the eye...and nose.

4 READING, WRITING AND GANGBANGING
A vagrant's beating murder and a questionable teacher's suicide set the MIT looking for a connection and ultimately the solution.

5 RED HEADS
The murder/abduction MIT investigation takes a detour when a 2nd kidnapped girl is found nearly nude walking the streets. The only initial connection is red hair. Maggots only come in white.

6 LAMBS TO THE SLAUGHTER
A released pedophile is stabbed and emasculated sending the MIT looking to his past which seems to have disappeared from police records. Why?

7 MODELS AND MILLIONAIRES
Murdered porn model's body is found beside the Thames. DC MacManus (Lindsey Coulson) suspects the spouse. DI Friend finds MacManus' judgment a bit suspect. Friction midst MIT.

8 THE BIGGER THE LIE
A journalist's `big scoop' leads to her brutal murder. The story dealt with racial problems which culminate in a huge problem within the MIT.

One pleasantry, without grit, is the theme song ""Sweet Bitter Love"" performed by Petra Jean-Phillipson. Audibly pleasant, quite the contrast to MIT cases. This DVD is unrated but comes with the box warning of strong language, violence, and graphic images. It's that and more, not for kids, only for adults with a serious interest in murder drama. This 2003 series continued in 2005, and I'll be looking for the next Series on DVD.",1295136000,19,2873,4.943983402489627
4337977,1,B004EP42Y2,"I've watched several British and Canadian police procedural/crime series and liked them, most of the time more than I like the US ones.

4337983,3,B004EP42Y2,"I'd put this one in the ""okay"" category. It's watchable, but not what I've come to expect from the BBC. Not even in the same league as Inspector Morse, or Lewis, or really any of the ""classic "" UK cop shows. I wouldn't buy it again.",1430784000,,232,4.065217391304348

4337990,1,B004EP42Y2,"I felt as if I was watching a documentary about police work.  This might make a good police training series but it's not at all entertaining or moving.

4337998,3,B004EP42Y2,"I was disappointed in this series because the people that starred in it could not act.  The stories were well written though, which made it watchable.  Rather than an example of women's equality in the work force, I found the main characters to be pushy broads.  With the exception of ""Sarge"", and the young black guy, the characters weren't even likable.  I gave it three stars because it's still better than American television which I stopped watching three years ago.  Not because of the deficit in quality programming, although there is that, but because of the commercials.",1370908800,,579,4.927835051546392
4337999,5,B004EP42Y2,"I thought it was going to be another ""Blue Murder"" but found it more gritty and engaging. I'm not one for characters getting together so the romantic tension between the two lead characters of Blue Murder made it more of a romantic drama than a cop show. MIT is spot on for tension between the old (Trevor and his ways) and the new (Vivian and her fast track). Overall this is a good procedural show with good story lines and an overall engaging cast. Here's to hoping for a third season.",1367107200,,488,4.373626373626373

English subtitles!!!!!!!!!!",1358294400,,139,5.363636363636363
4338001,4,B004EP42Y2,This is a no nonsense murder drama. Good plots and an intriguing degree of avoidance in personal issues among the force members.,1357948800,,128,4.863636363636363
4338002,4,B004EP42Y2,"Murder Investigation Team is a series that creeps up on you. You need to view a couple of episodes before you feel like you are beginning to get to know the characters. Series One, has eight episodes and is really a police procedural.  This is a gritty drama, focusing on the work of investigating violent death.

The show focuses on two women, DI Vivien Friend, played by Samantha Spiro, and DC Rosie McManus played by Lindsey Coulson. Vivien is the head of the Murder Investigation Team, and the first case is a drive by shooting of Sgt Boyden. In the first episode, a number of characters are introduced, and as I said it takes a few episodes to understand who is who and what is going on.

The show is a police/procedural of the investigation, and it follows this tract especially well. The characters are well sketched, and have depth  and personality.  The cases center on drug use, incest, necrophilia, and child murder.  Cases are left open and sometimes the guilty party will get away with it. This is fairly common aspect of real police work.

The characters are real and share all human values.  The stories flow smoothly, and overall the show is a success. There seems to
be a real conflict of authority between the female boss and one of the male detectives. This is a win/win
for the series. A valuable series that shows the real inside bits of the UK crime reality.
