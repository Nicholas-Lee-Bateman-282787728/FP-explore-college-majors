In Gene's own band,I think that his musicianship tend to be overcome by showmanship,but as a sideman,I think Gene played with a fabulous musical sense and inspired the tunes and musicians that he backed for with vitality that makes you feel like stompin' to the beats. You will feel it in those numbers of this video such as ""China Boy""""The Shiek of Araby""(both played by the members of original Benny Goodman Trio. What a nice combination of Teddy Wilson's bass line with Gene's drumming!!),""After You've Gone""(played with Benny and Mel Powell at the piano. Mel plays very fine swing-style piano and Gene shows traditional snare-drum-backing. Awfully Good!!) and ""Sing Sing Sing""(Joyful without reservation.)",977788800,6,825,5.257575757575758
8194873,5,B00003G1KU,"The amount of video footage available of Gene Krupa is very sparse.  Aside from his motion picture appearances, most video of Gene was not archived for posterity and had to be saved from being lost forever.  I had a small part in the production of this video and Bruce Klauber uses the best video available.  For 99.9% of viewers, they would rather have this invaluable video available than not have it available at all.",977011200,6,420,4.648648648648648
8194874,1,B00003G1KU,"Gene, was way ahead of his time, he would have made it great in the 70s rock bands. I'm disappointed NOT with Gene Krupa, but with the  quality of film footage used to make this video. most of the film footage is fuzzy,  until they get  1971. They didn't even mention the movie""the Gene  Krupa story"" with Sal Mineo, to bad they didn't use better and earlier  film footage. Most of it was from the 50s.",957830400,3,402,4.2368421052631575
