2748252,5,B000MTFDDI,Haven't I been waiting long enough already???  :)  I can't WAIT to see these cartoons.  I LOVED them as a kid.  And I guess in some ways I'm STILL a kid.  Good for me!!!  :),1183420800,,173,3.8
2748253,5,B000MTFDDI,"Imagine my utter surprise and delight when I found out these 70's comedy classics finally made it to DVD. I mean, how can you NOT love a stubborn Aardvark who talks like Jackie Mason and an Ant who sounds like Dean Martin going head to head in one bizarre hilarious chase after another.

And EXTRA bonus cool points for the great jazz music that accompanied these chases, played by some of the best West Coast jazz cats of the time (like Pete Candoli, Ray Brown, Shelly Manne, Jimmy Rowles etc), heck, how many cartoons have musician credits at the beginning?

But this YESTERDAY!!!!!",1181088000,3,584,4.660194174757281
2748254,4,B000MTFDDI,"I bought this for my eight year old daughter.  I never sat and watched it with her but listened to the cartoon dialog as she watched.  I had forgotten how funny the Ant Aardvark cartoons were, especially the sound-alike voices of Dean Martin for the Ant and Henny Youngman for the Aardvark.  I remembered that I enjoyed the Ant-Aardvark cartoons more than the Pink Panther when on Saturday morning TV because of this dialog.  It's great.",1179360000,,437,4.7105263157894735

2748256,4,B000MTFDDI,"What a cool blast from the past this collection is. Just recently I saw John Byner on David Letterman's Late Show and in his piece on the show he did the voices for both the Ant and the Aardvark. What a cool surprise. Byner did both their voices. The Aardvark's voice was patterned on comedian Jackie Mason while the Ant's voice sounded a little like Dean Martin. Thanx for reissuing this collection, both parents and kids can enjoy this fun and classic cartoons all over again.",1179014400,2,478,4.569767441860465
2748257,5,B000MTFDDI,"The Ant and the Aardvark series is DePatie-Freleng Enterprises cartoon comic series. DePatie-Freleng team is major cartoon making company of 1960's. Of course, Freleng is former WB cartoon director Friz Freleng. DePatie-Freleng team's most famous outing is Pink Panther series. They won Academy awards with their first Pink Panther cartoon THE PINK PHINK. And after that, they made very interesting, well made two cartoon series. They're The Ant and the Aardvark, The Inspector series.

The Ant and the Aardvark had same kind of cartoon structure with Road Runner series or Tom and Jerry series. Hunter and hunted, but Ant and the Aardvark had unique feel and style all its own. DePatie-Freleng's cartoons are back to the old silent comedies roots, pantomime. Cartoons are basically visual genre so many classic cartoon makers did their best works with visual gags.

The Ant and the Aardvark series is visual cartoon style at its finest. Maybe if you like verbal gags more than visual gags, this series is not suitable for you. But, if you're a fan of visual gags, this is a series for you. The Pink Panther series is more famous than this series, but as a long time classic cartoon fans, I certainly believe The Ant and the Aardvark series had style, inventiveness all its own.

And, reasonably good price, you can get all The Ant and the Aardvark cartoons in your living room. I think that's a pretty good deal for any classic cartoon fans. And, one final note: The Inspector series will be releasing in July. I wrote reviews about The Inspector series, upcoming Woody Woodypecker classic cartoon collection, Tex Avery's Droopy:compleat theatrical collection, too. So, please check it out. Thanks for reading.",1178150400,4,1711,5.017605633802817
2748258,5,B000MTFDDI,I just got this DVD a few days ago and have already watched every cartoon.  I nearly laughed myself sick.  I was just a kid when these cartoons originally aired and this DVD brings back a flood of memories.  I had forgotten several of these.  The Aardvark shares the same futile perseverance as Wile E. Coyote.  Maybe those two ought to compare notes!,1175817600,13,351,4.507936507936508

2748263,5,B000MTFDDI,"I was very little when these first aired on TV. I hadn't seen them in years, but the image on the cover of this DVD took me back immediately.

The Ant and the Aardvark are a lot like the Roadrunner and the Coyote, except I always find myself rooting for the Aardvark because the Ant is such a wiseacre. (Also, after getting bitten and stung by fire ants, I don't have much love for them.)

Much as I enjoy the antics of these two characters, I'm glad the original series was limited to just 17 episodes. It's possible to tell the same joke too many times. This collection gets it just right.",1462406400,,591,4.267857142857143

What real humor is all about.",1394928000,,91,3.6
2748278,5,B000MTFDDI,"During the 1960s & 1970s, animation was at the height of its creative powers - & cartoons & TV programs featuring animation were still as popular as ever with shows such as ""The Bugs Bunny/Roadrunner Show"", the various incarnations of ""The Flintstones"" cartoons, including the various staple of Hanna-Barbera action-oriented features (""Wacky Races"" & ""Laff-A-Lympics""). During these two decades, nothing surpassed or topped all of these quite like the ""Pink Panther"" shorts, which included ""The Ant and the Aardvark"". From the creative minds of David DePatie & Friz Freleng comes 17 delightful shorts originally produced from 1969 through 1971. These shorts would find a permanent home on Saturday morning television for the rest of the 1970s. Comedian John Byner voiced nearly all of the characters, which focused on the antics of an ant-hungry aardvark, who derives great pleasure in chasing his ""meal"" - a red fire ant. Byner adds zeal to the two main characters - voicing Jackie Mason for the aardvark & Dean Martin for the ant. All 17 episodes are here, from ""The Ant and the Aardvark"" to ""From Bed To Worse"". So funny, you'll most likely need to seek intensive care while viewing these hilariously hip, classic shorts, so please proceed with caution when watching this DVD! ""The Ant and the Aardvark"" is rarely seen on TV these days, so it's wise to hunt this DVD down, before it becomes extinct.

2748286,5,B000MTFDDI,"When I came across this cartoon on dvd, I knew I had to get it. Each cartoon is only about 6 minutes long but long enough to find yourself laughing at the simple but effective plots that make this and others cartoons from this time period the classics they are.

This cartoon is similiar to The Roadrunner that you have one character chasing and trying to catch another while using any means possible. While the aardvark is not very bright, he sure is determined while the ant tries to mind his own business. The music is very catchy and you'll find yourself humming along with this fun tune.

2748300,5,B000MTFDDI,"Growing up in a one TV household, pre cable, one of the high-lights of the week was catching an episode of The Ant and the Ardvark on the Pink Panther cartoons on Saturday morning.  This DVD conatains all the A&A cartoons broadcast(17).  There were very few episodes sprinkled in amongst the Pink Panther, and other 'toons which I can not remember, but the crazy antics of the Ardvark trying to make a meal of one single ant is hilarious.  John Byner does some great voice work.  I laughed again like I did for the three years this cartoon aired, 69,70,71",1272326400,,555,4.52
2748301,5,B000MTFDDI,"""The Ant and the Aardvark"" was a Saturday morning favorite of mine growing up. Made in a three year span starting in 1969, the shows chronicle the exploits of a blue aardvark, voiced in the style of Jackie Mason by John Byner, and his attempts to catch and eat a small red ant named Charlie, voiced by Byner as well in the debonair style of Dean Martin. There are other characters in various episodes (a rival green aardvark, a very un-helpful computer, etc.) which are also largely voiced by Byner, whose vocal skills are second to none (there are a couple of other vocal artists, but their contributions are fairly minor.)

The cartoons follow a formula of ludicrous aardvark capture attempts thwarted by the wily ant, in a manner that is somewhat reminiscent of the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote. Who wouldn't love an aardvark that inhales with the sound of a very loud vacuum cleaner? Along with The Inspector, these were intermixed with the Pink Panther cartoons seemingly at random, but were always the highlight of the show for me. This DVD has all seventeen of the Ant and the Aardvark cartoons on it, and is a wonderful bargain, whether for purposes of childhood nostalgia, or to entertain younger audiences who haven't been lucky enough to grow up with the series.

I highly recommend this DVD; I only wish there were more episodes!",1271894400,3,1343,4.7106382978723405

2748306,5,B000MTFDDI,"This DVD collects the complete episodes, in chronological order, of this series of cartoon shorts that were broadcast, at least when I saw them in syndication, in tandem with The Pink Panther. While it may be possible to gripe that some of the plots seem recycled from other cartoon series, e.g. Tom & Jerry; Sylvester & Tweety (Friz Freleng worked at Warner Bros. before moving to DePatie-Freleng), I don't think plot originality is terribly important in humorous cartoons. Watch the nonchalant ant and the preciously inept aardvark (transmogrifications of Dean Martin and Jackie Mason, respectively) go at it in the classic American way: the underdog always comes out on top. To the tune of perfectly hokey Vaudville music. One of my favorite aspects of Fritz Freling cartoons in general (including The Pink Panther, The Inspector, and others as well) is actually the backdrop. I enjoy the way he weaves together what seems to be, in this case, Southern Africa and the American Southwest. His technique is very simple but warm and surreal, impressionistic and memorable; and his intense use of colors make me think, I hope not presumptuously, that he may have been touched by the psychedelic era if not by the psychedelics themselves. It's good art; don't let that go unnoticed!

Here are some brief sketches of the episodes I am watching, in order, in case you are hunting for something specific:

1) THE ANT AND THE AARDVARK: the ant absconds into his hill with food from a picnic. The aardvark attempts to smoke him out with a cigar but ends up taking in too much smoke and inhales an entire lake to cool off.

2) HASTY BUT TASTY: The ant attempts another picnic-invasion, this time on a motorcycle. The aardvank employs numerous methods to block his passage on the road, including his own motorcycle, a hot-air balloon, and ""liquid hole"". What I want to know is: is the aardvark a member of the Boilermakers Union??

3) THE ANT FROM UNCLE: Various hijinx (none based on ""The Man from UNCLE"" as you might think), including an attempt to get the ant to visit the respectable Ant's Club (the Aardvark's stomach). This is the episode in which we first hear mention of the ant's name as Charlie, as well as meet his ""aunt"" (the puns NEVER cease.)

4) I'VE GOT ANTS IN MY PLANS: A $100-a-plate ant dinner is rudely interrupted as the aardvark and his green doppelganger battle it out like angry lovers over Charlie.

5) TECHNOLOGY, PHOOEY: The aardvark assembles a huge MIT-style mainframe computer to give him advice about catching ants. He bungles it anyhow and ends up in quicksand. He then buys a remote-controlled ant-stamper...

6 NEVER BUG AN ANT: Watch as an entire bear is sucked through Charlie's hill by force of the aardvark's vacuum cleaner; a sugar trail that leads to disaster; the aardvark inadvertantly assist Charlie force a watermelon into his hill; the aardvark turn pale and retch from blowing ant killer down a false hill; dynamine thrown down the false hole; the destruction of Charlies' furnature by shotput and magnet (very clever, aardvark!)

7) DUNE BUG: the first to take place away from the surreal Freeling landscape. Hijinx on the beach. The aardvark, mistaken for a dog, is thrown off the beach multiple times by a lifeguard.

8) ISLE OF CAPRICE: We have two adjacent islands, on one of which is marooned one aardvark (THE aardvark) and on the other some ants (none of which is Charlie, curiously enough); the dynamic here is mainly between the aardvark and a shark that swims between the islands (the ants are only seen through the glass). All manner of floatation devices, air propulsion, tightrope paraphrenalia, etc. is employed but to no avail. The shark (and the palm trees) are against the idea of the aardvark fulfilling his appetite.

9) SCRATCH A TIGER: Charlie and his friends receive protective services from a tiger who owes Charlie a favor (for removing a thorn from his foot). However, in the end, the aardvark removes a thorn from the same tiger's foot and is this owed a favor of similar weight. The tables are turned.

10) ODD ANT OUT: Green and blue aardvarks wage war over a can of chocolate-covered ants that falls from the back of a lorry; neither of them has a can-opener. When the can finally does open, guess who is inside!

11) ANTS IN THE PANTRY: Bongo Pest Control, 402 Bongo Road. The aardvark intercepts a call and beats the technician to the scene: a bungalow, which gets thrashed in the proceedings, as does the aardvark. He ends the episode eating spaghetti in a spaghetti parlor.

12) SCIENCE FRICTION: Charlie is studied in a ""scientific expedition"" trailer by an entomologist. The aardvark attempts to steal him by employing bamboo snout-extension, by outright bumrushing the trailer, and other methods.

13) MUMBO JUMBO: Brothers of the Forest Lodge 202 members are vowed to protect one another; when the aardvark moves in on Charlie, Tiny the Elephant goes to bat. Landmines in a scale, et cetera!

14) THE FROZE NOSE KNOWS: Snow hijinx on skis, as Charlie tries to collect food for winter. Bet you can't imagine what happens to the aardvark on a frozen pond.

15) DON'T HUSTLE AN ANT WITH MUSCLE: Charlie takes vitamins (steroids?) that give him superhuman strength; the aardvark sucks in ball bearings and has magnet trouble. When the vitamins wear off, drama increases.

16) ROUGH BRUNCH: a termite helps Charlie avoid the aardvark by taking him home to a huge Victorian house that the termites are eating to the ground. The aardvark doesn't know which way to run. The sky is magenta in evening...

17) FROM BED TO WORSE: Both Charlie and the aardvark break their legs in an auto accident and are placed in an veterenary clinic beside a vicious dog, in this final episode....",1233100800,,5748,4.824186991869919

They're a blast from the past. The cartoon prints are very clean on this DVD and every episode is included!,1220832000,3,464,4.1098901098901095

2748320,5,B000MTFDDI,"I watched the Pink Panther, when I was a kid, just to see The Ant & The Aardvark and the Inspector cartoons!!  I could have cared less about the Pink Panther.  Every A&A cartoon is on this disc and in unedited condition.  Meaning not made politically correct like many of the cartoon classics being released these days.  The cartoons are every bit as good as I remember them.  Now how about releasing the Inspector cartoons?!",1199404800,,425,4.613333333333333
2748321,5,B000MTFDDI,"Having been a fan of the ant and the aardvark myself, I thought my sons might get a kick out of it as well. I had no idea when ordering that they would want to watch this stuff everyday.  They are age 6 and almost 3 and are just nuts about this dvd. They watch as a ""wind-down"" before supper and they talk about the shows constantly.  And their parents enjoy watching with them.  I highly recommend this whether you're already a pink panther fan or not.",1197331200,,453,4.183908045977011
2748322,4,B000MTFDDI,"hadn't watched the aardvark cartoons in more than 20 years, since i was a kid. one of the funniest least politically correct cartoons of it's time.",1196553600,,147,4.6923076923076925
2748323,5,B000MTFDDI,"I remember this cartoon airing back when I was a kid in the early 1980s.  It was during a 1/2 hour cartoon show with an episode of either The Inspector or The Ant and the Aardvark sandwiched between two episodes of The Pink Panther.  As soon as I heard the jazzy theme song to Ant and the Aardvark, it bought me back.  I'm glad I can add this DVD to my Pink Panther collection and, like other reviewers, am hoping for the release of The Inspector which may be my favorite of that trio of cartoons.

The Ant and the Aardvark is entertaining on many levels (animation, voices, one-liners, music).  That big, goofy-looking blue aardvark (so ugly, he's cute) and that fun, jazzy music.  What really makes the show are the accents given to the characters by John Byner.  Charlie, the ant, is a hip daddy-o who sounds like Dean Martin.  Even better is the Aardvark who has a stereotypical north-eastern Jewish accent (his voice was patterned after New York comedian Jackie Mason).  Almost anything he says is funny.  There are many hilarious one-liners, especially in the early episodes.  The show was released to theatres between March 1969 to May 1971, but I think even today's kids will enjoy this cartoon.

Here are the 17 episodes in order of their release:

1. ""The Ant and the Aardvark""-- The ant tries to take home an entire picnic, but the aardvark would like to make a picnic of him.  Aardvark after a pie to the face--""Coconut cream pie.  You know how I know it's coconut?  Because it's got a coconut in it, and it huyts!""
2. ""Hasty But Tasty""--The hip daddy-o ant gets himself some wheels in the form of a motorcycle.  The aardvark after swallowing a giant sandwich--""You know, peanut butter really sticks to the roof of your back.""
3. ""The Ant From Uncle""--Clever title--a take-off of ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E.""  The aardvark introduces himself to the audience.  He then tries to get the ant to visit ""The Ant's Club"" in his stomach and visits the ant's pad: ""What is this place?  Nothing but hallways.""  We find out the ant's name is Charlie and we meet ""Charlie's Aunt"" (a reference to the classic play and later film ""Charley's Aunt"").
4. ""I've Got Ants in My Plans""--The aarvark and his rival, the green aardvark, compete over Charlie.
5. ""Technology, Phooey""--The aardvark purchases a computer that sounds a little like Paul Lynde (it's not his voice, though) to help him catch Charlie.  Aardvark: ""I could say something right now, but it would only get censored.""

6. ""Never Bug an Ant""--The aardvark tries many creative ways to catch the ant--none work but they are creative.  Aardvark: ""I'd rather be a banker and have a businessman's lunch.""  Ant: ""Lucky for me, an ant can lift 100,000 times his own weight"" (that comes in handy).
7. ""Dune Bug""--Charlie is vacationing at the beach and the aardvark keeps getting kicked off for not wearing a leash.
8. ""Isle of Caprice""--The aardvark somehow ends up on a deserted island and tries to swim to an adjacent island inhabited by ants--but a shark keeps putting the chomp on his plans.  No Charlie in this one (sorry, Charlie).
9. ""Scratch a Tiger""--For pulling a thorn out of his foot, a tiger protects Charlie and his ant buddies from the aardvark.  The tables are turned, however, when the aardvark also relieves the tiger of a painful thorn.

10. ""Odd Ant Out""--The aardvark competes with his rival green anteater over a can of chocolate-covered ants.  Charlie is only seen at the end.
11. ""Ants in the Pantry""--The aardvark gets tips on where to find meals by intercepting calls to a pest control company.  When he shows up at Charlie's address, however, he is no longer in control of the pests.
12. ""Science Friction""--A scientist wants Charlie for research, the aardvark wants him for lunch.
13. ""Mumbo Jumbo""--An elephant, and fellow member of the Brothers of the Forest Lodge 202, comes to Charlie's aid when he's confronted by the aardvark--""With a mouth as small as mine, I've got to pick on somebody his size or I'd starve.""

14. ""The Froze Nose Knows""--It's winter time, but there's no hibernation for the aardvark--he probably should consider it, though.
15. ""Don't Hustle an Ant With Muscle""--Charlie takes strength vitamins and becomes a muscle-bound powerhouse who can even get the aardvark to be his waiter: ""I never thought it would happen to me, an aardvark bringing lunch to an ant.""
16. ""Rough Brunch""--Charlie finds support from a family of termites who makes life miserable for the aardvark.
17. ""From Bed to Worse""--The Ant and the Aardvark are hit by a car and are put in an animal clinic with an angry dog.  The little old lady nurse reminds me of Tweety Bird's owner.  Aardvark: ""The hospitality around here can make a person sick.""",1194652800,45,4720,4.745098039215686

8172275,4,B000MTFDDI,"THE ANT & THE AARDVARK: Unlike the dialogue-free ""predator vs. prey"" favorites Tom and Jerry and The Roadrunner, The Ant & the Aardvark thrived on snappy patter that accentuated its fast paced story lines. Gifted mimic John Byner provided both characters' voices, giving Charlie Ant a laid back Dean Martin vibe and the flustered Blue Aardvark the muttering personality of Jewish comic Jackie Mason. A ragtime themed score and the vacuum cleaner hum of the Aardvark's elongated schnozz were just two of the series' quirky trademarks. The Ant & the Aardvark
was second only to Depatie-Freling's acclaimed Pink Panther (Looney Tunes fans take note: From Bed to Worse is a scene for scene remake of a Friz Freling/Tweety and Sylvester classic) The Ant & the Aardvark was miles ahead of the company's subsequent ""chase"" toons Crazy Legs Crane, and The Blue Racer.
