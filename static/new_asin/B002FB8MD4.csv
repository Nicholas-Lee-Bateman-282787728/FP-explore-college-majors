8368943,5,B002FB8MD4,This is a really good basic accounting DVD.  I have been looking for something like this for a long time.  It explains the concepts clearly without a lot of silliness that I have found in most other accounting videos.  I'm not sure why but most other videos feel the need to start off by telling you how awful accounting is and then trying to use hack comedy to explain it.  Not this video.  Accounting In An Hour is all business and yet keeps you engaged and interested.  Thank god somebody finally got it right.,1303257600,5,513,4.404255319148936
8368944,5,B002FB8MD4,"Finally, a quick and easy study about the basics of Accounting.  I had a hard time in college with Accounting... I wish this product would have been around back then.  I learned more in sixty minutes with ""Accounting In An Hour"" than I learned in a whole semester in college. I was amazed at how easily this DVD translated a sometimes difficult (and boring) topic into an easily digestible and applicable presentation.  Thanks for making this available to the masses.",1246406400,10,467,4.8125
8368945,5,B002FB8MD4,"I could not believe how easy it was to pickup accounting concepts from this presentation!  They made everything so simple to understand with good explanations and examples I could really relate to.  This company has an incredible approach to teaching.  I hope they come out with some other titles, because this is a no-brainer compared to spending 20+ hours of my busy life reading some sub-par book.  I also hope they don't realize how inexpensive this product really is.  It's a steal for forty bucks!",1246233600,6,503,4.870588235294117
