8386080,3,B0030U1U7E,"A decent documentary, especially for those new to the sport of triathlon. Gives you somewhat of an insight into the training and lives of amateur triathletes.",1383091200,,158,5.115384615384615
8386081,2,B0030U1U7E,"Personally I really didn't enjoy this dvd/documentary at all.  It's been a while since I last watched it.  Actually I've only watched it once...the day I received the shipment.  I bought this dvd in anticipation of the winter cycling season and thought that I could watch it through the winter on the trainer.  It just couldn't hold my attention...not even on the trainer.  I'm sure it can insipre some, but just wasn't for me.",1323648000,,427,4.716216216216216
