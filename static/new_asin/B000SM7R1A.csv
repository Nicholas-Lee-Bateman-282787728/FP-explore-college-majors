8205886,4,B000SM7R1A,"The first movie I saw Ray Dennis Steckler  in was ""Wild Guitar.""  I grew to like his phony tough guy image.  Then I came across this collection and found out a lot more about him.  Surprised to learn he grew up in Reading, Pa. which is a stone's throw from where I live.  Then I recognized him in a bit part in one of my favorite movies, ""Eegah.""  These movies are odd, but I enjoyed watching them.",1488240000,,398,4.103896103896104

8205888,2,B000SM7R1A,For bad movie fans only. Torture your friends with these turkeys! Ray Dennis Steckler's all time Zombie musical classic for bad movie fans.,1386288000,,139,5.086956521739131
8205889,5,B000SM7R1A,"Ray Dennis Steckler may be an acquired taste, but his best films reveal an original, passionate filmmaker's vision behind the drawbacks of ultra-low budgets and an evident improvisational style. ""MIdnight Movies"" includes Steckler's best-known films in a single package, at the price that normally would be paid for the purchase of just one of them. The DVDs are worth their value: brand-new prints, informational extras and trailers, as good as it gets for Steckler. Outstanding in quality are ""The Thrill Killers"", a serious crazed-killers melodrama with chilling sequences, and ""Rat Phink a Boo Boo"", a fun movie which starts as a straightforward drama until, midway through, it becomes a loony takeoff on ""Batman"", with very good music from Roy Haydock and Carolyn Brandt at her loveliest.
Highly recommended, for those with a taste for exploitation cinema. All others, beware!",1368403200,2,881,5.345323741007194
8205890,4,B000SM7R1A,"The title doesn't specify the fact that all the films featured in this were made by Ray Dennis Steckler.

The quality of the DVDs are all excellent with great transfers and lots of extras. The films featured are all from the 60s which looks to be Steckler's heyday.

Rat Pfink and Boo Boo is Batman and Robinesque, the Lemon Groove Kids is Bowery Boysesque but Thrill Killers and Incredibly Strange Creatures is all Steckler.

Again, the bonus fatures and picture quality make this a worth while purchase ONLY if you are familiar with low budget movies and don't mind fairly schlocky horror movies.",1360972800,4,828,6.05982905982906
8205891,4,B000SM7R1A,"These movies, by no means, are masterpieces, but I was really surprised at the above average production values.  This helps when you get two future ""star"" cinematographers working their first American films, just to get their foot in the door.  ""The Lemon Grove Kids"" three shorts are corny, but have their hearts in the right place. The Incredibly Strange Creatures... makes little sense, but is entertaining and worth watching.  As I said earlier, theses are better than expected. Ray Dennis Steckler surprised me.",1315526400,3,516,5.192771084337349
8205892,5,B000SM7R1A,"Movies arrived on time and great price.  Thought this would be a low-rent set of Steckler films, but each DVD was the deluxe remaster.  Great deal for these movies!",1252713600,2,164,4.620689655172414
