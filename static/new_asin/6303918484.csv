7855536,4,6303918484,Kira Reed in this movie is acting as a sex FBI/police officer and there are some sex scenes inside(to those whom are interested in this genre of erotic natural arts). The story is about Kira solving a FBI/police case.(I do not want to elaborate further to spoil the whole interest in the movie). This movie is longer in production BUT happen to saw it at the british web store called Bensonsworld.co.uk. This movie is worth for those whom like to collect. A good recommended collection for this movie.,1065398400,,501,4.704545454545454

Now Trent has to come clean without getting caught by the police, who are after him because Deena gets killed and his clothes are found at her house. Why didn't i like this movie? The storyline was great at the beginning, 5 minutes later it just got dull and then came the sex scenes that were very strange I mean they didn't even bother to edit it properly so you basically see two grown people dressed and having sex several times for the first 30 minutes of the film. Then came the murder, then came the blackmail and then came the ""who is behind it"" plot which was silly and again the only reason to watch this movie is Gregory.",995328000,3,1463,4.209964412811388
7855538,1,6303918484,"this movie suffers from an extremly bad director, it is poorly casted and the story as predictable as the eclipse of the sun.
the only thing which kept me awake was the always reliable joan severance, struggling hard  against the ""below average"" in almost every part of this  flick.
unless you really go for joanie, save your money and your time.",937526400,,346,4.655737704918033
