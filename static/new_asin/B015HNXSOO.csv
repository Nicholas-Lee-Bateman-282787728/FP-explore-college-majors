8733609,3,B015HNXSOO,"This Nutcracker was an ambitious project -- Yuri Burlake attempted recreation of the 1892 Petipa/Ivanov production. Sets, costumes, and choreography were supposed to adhere to the 1892 production as much as possible. And you can see the result of the research -- the costumes and sets are indeed full of period detail, while the choreography has aspects that you can see Balanchine, or Sir Peter Wright picked up. For instance, the Candy Cane hoop variation is something Balanchine preserved in his version. The Waltz of the Flowers was the eye opener -- both male and female flowers dancing together. This is a wonderful concept and Burlaka deserves credit for his efforts.

However, the Berlin Ballet's performance is invariably sluggish and uninspired. For example, in the Snow Scene, the music and the dancing is at such a ponderous level that you lose all sense of the ""blizzard"" pattern that Ivanov created with the snowflakes. The Candy Cane variation is also danced so slowly that the thrill of jumping through the hoops is gone. Also, it seems as if Burlaka was unwilling to make Clara/Prince child roles, so Iana Salenko and Marian Walter take over the second act as the adult Clara and Prince and once again, the Sugarplum Fairy role is deleted. Salenko and Walter are fine dancers. This ignores the 1892 storyline and structure of the ballet, which was decidedly NOT a love story, but rather a child's fantasy. In the end, this video is a document of an extremely noble ambition (restoring the 1892 Nut) but with unfulfilling results.",1484697600,2,1546,4.946153846153846
8733610,4,B015HNXSOO,"This Nutcracker was full of beautiful dancing, but not a great deal of magic. The tempi (especially in Act I) seemed to drag. At some points, the children were actually seen ""waiting"" for the downbeat to take off again. Act II was better. Some to the most beautiful dancing was from non-principals. The oriental (or as we would say now, Middle Eastern) dancers were wonderful, especially the women. The Pas de deux was beautiful but it might have been thrilling. The simple descending scale is so familiar, but the ascending scales were gorgeous. There were times when the climax of the phrase came after a physical high point for the couple. Again, it could be tempo related. The dancers were graceful and flawless, but the marriage of choreography to the music seemed a bit ""off."" Costumes for women were beautiful. The sound over a ""normal"" sound system was quite dull.",1450569600,,872,4.82
8733611,5,B015HNXSOO,"On this new DVD from Belair Tchaikovsky's beloved ""Nutcracker"" ballet receives a splendid performance from the Berlin State Ballet Company with Marian Walter as the Prince and Iana Selenko as Clara and the Sugar Plum Fairy. The orchestra plays well under its conductor Robert Reimer, the dancing is excellent, the scenery is good, though I am sure that it would have been even more lavish if more had been spent on it, and the audience was well-behaved. I have only one minor criticism: I find it odd that Iana Selenko performed the dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy without a change of costume from her role as Clara. I suppose that there is no reason why Clara and the Sugar Plum Fairy should not be danced by the same protagonist, but the sudden appearance of Iana Selenko, still dressed as Clara but now dancing to the music that always accompanies the Sugar Plum Fairy, was initially confusing. If this strange anomaly doesnt put you off, the rest of the performance should give you much pleasure.

8733612,3,B015HNXSOO,"An odd production - I was expecting more from the Deutsche Oper Belin and the Staatsballett Berlin, but the production didn't gel for me.  Some specific points: the tempos are *quite* slow - and that is comparative to other Nutcrackers I've seen, such as the San Francisco, and Royal Ballet versions - slow to the point of dragging; the design is also somewhat drab - with the woman's outfits superb, but the male costumes are bad to the point of absurdity, with polka dots and stripes and eye-cringing color combinations.  The backdrops are incredibly detailed, with the Candy kingdom and other scenes vivid and wonderful.  The dancing is fine, but nothing struck me as spectacular; there are some odd choices for the libretto, with the Rat King being cast as one of Drosselmeyer's dancing dolls, and nothing in the way of prologue.  Another sticking point is Drosselmeyer's magic tricks, which are rather pedestrian and hackneyed.  All in all, a workmanlike production that failed to produce any wonder or magic.",1449100800,8,1014,4.976331360946745
