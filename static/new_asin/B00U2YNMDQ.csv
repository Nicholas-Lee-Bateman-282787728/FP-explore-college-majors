8704126,4,B00U2YNMDQ,It's a foreign film so it's going to be different meaning your never really sure how it will go. I liked it. Others may not. It's a bit slow moving but crazy. It's in Hebrew language but English subtitles were easy to understand and follow. Music was cool in it. Follow it through to the end. As an Israeli film I was intrigued by it and would say it could be characterized more art/indie with a dash of unique weirdness. Not a comedy but humorous in a dark way.,1499040000,,462,4.202247191011236
