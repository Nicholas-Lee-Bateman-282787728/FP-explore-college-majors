8346615,3,B001VLBDBW,"I expected more from this dvd in more ways than one. First up, it is a DVD-R recordable disc. Second, the program runs for only about 55 minutes and NOT the 94 minutes as stated by amazon. A little more time may be taken up with a bonus gallery of photos but I still think that the disc is misrepresented and, for the hefty price tag, I expected more than a DVD-R running for a considerably shorter time than stated. Large chunks of Yul's life and some of his movies were omitted. I was hoping to see bits from the elusive ""The Journey"" that he made with Deborah Kerr, his priceless 'drag' cameo in ""The Magic Christian"" and also a little 'seedy' information..(like the time he diddled Marilyn Monroe). Since my initial rage has somewhat subsided, I may give this disc another viewing but my first experience with it left me asking: ""Where's the rest???"" and also with an overwhelming compulsion to throw it in the bin. You'd be probably better off spending the money on Rock Brynner's book about his dad: ""Yul"".",1274832000,5,1012,4.53551912568306
8346616,5,B001VLBDBW,"This video is a series of interviews with people who knew Yul Brynner, including his son, one of his daughters, and one of his ex-wives.  There are clips from his movies and events in his life.  All together the video presents a well rounded picture of the man that he was.

  One thing that I enjoyed in this video was the way his talents, other than acting, were related.  I learned things about him that I hadn't known before.  Of special interest to me were the interviews with his children.  They both express a deep love and admiration for their father and I felt that brought him down from the pedestal that we often put entertainers on and put him on a human level that gave me a better understanding of what type of person he really was.

  For the true Yul Brynner fan I recommend this video, if for no other reason than seeing this beautiful man in action, so to speak.",1252627200,9,880,4.337423312883436
