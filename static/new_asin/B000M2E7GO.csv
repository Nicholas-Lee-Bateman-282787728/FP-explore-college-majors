8165773,1,B000M2E7GO,"Disc said it was universal and it does not play in US DVD players! It was my fault for not reading previous reviews because I am not the only person who has complained about this. However, was very disappointed when the seller said they would not refund and it will not play in my DVD player although in the description it states that it is universal!
