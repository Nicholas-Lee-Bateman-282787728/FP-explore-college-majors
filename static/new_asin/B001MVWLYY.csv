3701432,3,B001MVWLYY,"Can CBS Television get it right? Don't get me wrong. I LOVE this series and I'm willing to pay full price for shows/DVDS, but...

Last sesaon's release was ok. The shows were in order but one essential thing was missing- the SONGS. One of the reasons this show was a hit was because the show used popular songs back when the show debuted. For whatever reason, the songs are not included as originally produced.

This season, the second season, was better than the first but again, we are missing those songs and now the order in which enscribed on the DVDs is in the wrong order. The storyline doesn't match up because of the episode are in the wrong order.

I just ask - How hard is it to get it right? These things seem minor, but when CBS releases the shows and wants, in store, 39.99 for the season, I wish they would get it right, will all elements in tact and included.

It would be nice to see some added extras in the third season, with the songs and in order.",1239408000,18,968,4.273224043715847

3701438,4,B001MVWLYY,Nash Bridges has all ways been one of my favorite show's. I was very happy when it was released on dvd.

3701439,5,B001MVWLYY,"I am a Big Don Johnson Fan, But I thought Nash Bridges was Broadcasted in HD? so why is the DVD`s not in HD? Thats my down side.",1236384000,,128,3.607142857142857
3701440,4,B001MVWLYY,"In my opinion, this is a much better release of Nash Bridges than the first season was. While this season is not as loaded with features as the previous one, this season only has part two of the writers round-table continued from the first season, the presentation of the series itself is better. While the first season contained none of the songs by popular artists featured in the televised versions, this season actually contains some of them, an example being the opening song of the episode 'Night Train'. Also, where the first season DVD's replaced its songs (from James Brown to Rod Stewart and the Allman Brothers) with primarily new created instrumental overdubs, this season actually uses other popular music in place of some of its songs. The picture is once again fantastically restored, as was the first season's and the commentary by Don Johnson and others on a few of the episodes is rather interesting. Overall, in my opinion, this is a better quality release of a great series than was the first season.",1236038400,19,1020,4.8342857142857145

Anyway, I'd waited for several years for the first season DVDs to come out, and just purchased the second season.  (Now I know when the theme song changed!)

3701476,5,B001MVWLYY,"After watching Season 1, I HAD to get Season 2.  It's awesome ... better than Season 1, and makes me wonder why this show was canceled prematurely ... ?  I still love all the police drama, car chases, and the fantastic San Francisco scenery, which is really like another character in the show.  As someone who is now about the same age as Nash was when the show started, I am even more taken in by all the issues he (and the other characters as well) is dealing with, especially when it comes to family.  Most of us middle-aged baby boomers can relate to what it's like to juggle a job, a home, kids, and aging parents ... and, oh yeah, our own life as well.  Again ... great writing, top-notch acting, relevant storylines, good balance between drama and comedy, and VERY easy on the eyes.  I think I love Nash more than Sonny Crockett because he is just a more realistic character ... and like a fine wine, a few extra years only did him good!",1284940800,3,944,4.305084745762712

the end of Nash, but in this day and age everything ends up for sale. Again I gave
these to my son for Christmas and he was delighted.  I still think it's a cheesy
show but it had its' moments and it's a way to see Don Johnson when he was still
young enough and fit enough to play a smart-alec cop. Cheech make the show watchable.
Some of the story lines are interesting as I recall. I did watch it when on TV so
what can I say.",1265846400,,511,3.8207547169811322

3701486,5,B001MVWLYY,"Don Johnson and Cheech Marin are perfectly cast as Nash Bridges and Jose Dominguiz. The drama, the comedy and yes, sometimes the sadness makes this one of the best police dramas,including the present days series. The setting which is San Francisco, is the perfect backdrop for the stories.
Nash Bridges (Don Johnson) is handsome, very sexy,and sometimes shy. It is easy to understand why the twice divorced Nash is attractive to so many women. Joe Dominguiz (Cheech Marin) is the perfect counterpart to Nash. Joe always has a scheme, which more often then not,colapses, but usually includes Nash. The stories have depth and hold ones interest. I am very anxious for season 3.",1251590400,,675,4.982300884955753
3701487,1,B001MVWLYY,"For years I looked forward to this show being released on DVD. When it was I didn't buy it right away because I was afraid this show would suffer the same fate a lot of popular TV shows get when they make the transition to DVD. The songs you heard on the show when it originally aired disappear, most often replaced by generic muzak. I'll settle for my bootleg edition of Nash Bridges before I buy this crappy release which does exactly that. I don't think I'm in the minority here either. The Miami Vice seasons probably wouldn't have sold half as much if the music had been tampered with. As Nash himself would say ""Save your money, bubba"". I'm disappointed.",1249862400,15,660,4.462809917355372
3701488,3,B001MVWLYY,"I can understand the issue with music copyrights but the omission of the original score in each episode takes away from the value of this series. For season two, they did it again. At least on our copy. Plus, again, scenes are cut and it plays much like the syndicated version on USA network. If you don't mind that, it will be fine because the series is superb regardless of that but not as good as the original, uncut, unaltered version. Why, oh why can't we have the original form??? Miss it terribly. Should you buy it or not? Uh, yeah, but....",1248566400,3,548,4.382352941176471
