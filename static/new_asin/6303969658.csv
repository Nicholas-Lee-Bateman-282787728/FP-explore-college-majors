7858357,3,6303969658,"Cadfael - St. Peter's Fair was not one of my favorite movies.  The quality of the filming did not seem as good as other Cadfael films that I have viewed.  But, it was entertaining.  As always Derek Jacobi was superb as the mystery solving monk.",1367539200,,244,4.377777777777778
7858358,5,6303969658,"My sweetie got me into this when it first appeared on TV.
I'm not usually into mysteries, esp. murder mysteries; but the acting and cinematography is awesome.
Now that I own the entire BBS production of Ellis Peters' stories; I'm going to have to read the books.
Anything that translates this well to a television format must be a great read.
It doesn't matter if you like murder mysteries or not; this series is well worth watching.",1360540800,,433,4.636363636363637
7858359,3,6303969658,"Unfortunately, I agree with the overwhelmingly negative reviews. I also did not like the actor who played the sheriff as much as the usual actor, thought that the story dragged, and I was able to identify the culprit and why he did what he did because it was very like other Cadfael dramas. But, having said this, I still found the story somewhat interesting.",1345766400,2,359,4.625
7858360,4,6303969658,"Not quite so easy to follow as most of the Cadfael stories, this one relies a little too heavily on there being a great many strangers in Shrewsbury during the fair, and not known to the audience or to the characters. But the general idea was easy enough: during the time of the war between King Stephen and Queen Maud of Wales, it was not always easy to know whose side anyone was on.

There are divisive elements involved here. The craftsmen of Shrewsbury must keep their shops closed during the fair, are not allowed to participate in the fair, and demand compensation for their lost revenue from the Abbot. The tolls for the fair booths all go to the Abbey, and that by the King's decree, and the Abbot does not have the right to modify the terms. So the Shrewsbury craftsmen, stirred up by the hot-headed butcher's son, end up in a brawl with the fair merchants.

A wine merchant comes to the fair for the dual purpose of selling wine and meeting with a contact; he's a spy, at least in the sense of those days. He's got his beautiful young niece with him. When he is killed, the niece is determined to finish what he started. One could have trusted that meant selling the stocks of wine, but it's pretty clear it meant more than that. But she gives herself away to the observant Cadfael when they return to her caravan and see that it has been tossed, presumably by a robber, but she answers way too quickly that nothing has been taken.

Was there some other reason for the brawl??? What was the wine merchant's mission that got him killed? And why did the killer cut out his tongue? Why does the wine merchant's niece keep sneaking off despite Brother Oswin's best efforts to look after her? And why was there a single glove in her caravan that was way too big to be hers, but which she claimed was?

And what about this handsome son of the Earl of Chester, come to the fair for the ostensible purpose of buying materials with which to provision a long abandoned home?",1336780800,,1975,4.402739726027397
7858361,3,6303969658,"I have not read any of the Cadfael books nor seen any of the other productions of this series---it was all new to me.  Also I am dreadfully ignorant of English history and I don't have the mind for mysteries.  So take my review with a grain of salt.

I loved the setting and the fine characterization of Cadfael by Derek Jacobi.  He was interesting to watch throughout.  I admit that I became confused about the characters early on and didn't have enough interest to rewind to figure them out.

As charming as Cadfael was, the heroine, Emma, was lacking in anything to commend her, as far as I could see. The supporting cast was filled with handsome actors with terrific voices....too bad I couldn't remember who was Fowler and who was Glover and then there was Thomas and Hugh and....???  I wasn't sorry when the film was over although some reviewers made me curious to see if others of this series might be better.

Anglophiles and mystery lovers will probably love this.  For the rest of us, well, I'm not sure.",1277596800,,1014,4.527472527472527
7858362,5,6303969658,"Derek Jacobi is, perhaps, one of todays finest actors. His portrayal of Cadfael is brilliant.  This is a fine mystery and an amazing look into early England.",1167782400,,157,4.814814814814815
7858363,3,6303969658,"I enjoyed the ending of the book- I didn't enjoy the ending of the movie-

Cadfael (though well acted) does not have to be the hero ALL the time!

I also missed the real Hugh and his wife-

Read the book!",1093824000,2,204,3.926829268292683
7858364,3,6303969658,"Perhaps if I had not read the book first, I wouldn't have been a little disappointed. Sir Derek Jacobi is wonderful as always as Cadfael, but I didn't like the lack of rapport between Hugh Beringar and Cadfael, the almost adversarial stance between them. I also didn't like the guy playing Hugh as well as I would have expected. They also took more liberties with the story than I liked. I really liked the book of this name, and so I was a little disappointed with it's treatment in film. It's still good and worth seeing, but it left out the romance, which is always a sweet little aspect of the novels, and didn't have as dramatic a climax to the story as the novel did. See this episode before you read the book, and you'll probably like it just fine.
It has a complex plot that keeps you guessing, starting with a dispute between the town and the abbey, and leading right into a whole series of murders, with a series of suspects that keep you guessing too. A fine story overall!",999648000,5,984,4.382513661202186
7858365,3,6303969658,"This is a disappointing treatment of the Cadfael mystery St. Peter's Fair. Those familiar with the relationship between Hugh Beringar and Cadfael will find the hostility between the two in the movie version most incongruent. Moreover, the lack of romantic tension between the heroine (Emma) and the villain compromises the climax. In the book, the villain remains courtly and attentive, while in the movie he is forward and boorish. The ending is the most disappointing of all. In the book, the villain, truly ruthless and without principle save for his own interests, meets a firey fitting end at the hands of Emma. In the movie, he dies for his partisan principles in a much more pedestrian way - one more soldier killed in a civil war. Thankfully, Derek Jacobi is perfect as Cadfael. He gives his character depth, humor, and charm. He gives the show a presence it would be lacking otherwise.",992995200,5,894,4.8881578947368425
