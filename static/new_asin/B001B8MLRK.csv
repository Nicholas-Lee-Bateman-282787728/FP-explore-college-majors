8514890,4,B001B8MLRK,"Though probably a little two long, at over 2 hours, for such a simple story this samurai ""comedy"" was excellent fun to watch and quite moving in parts. This is a 2004 remake of a movie originally filmed in black and white in 1935 as ""The Million Ryo Pot"". The cinematography is wonderful. Highly recommended for some very campy acting by Etsushi Toyokama and good sword fights.",1330560000,,377,4.641791044776119
