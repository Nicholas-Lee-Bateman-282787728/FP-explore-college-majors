6440416,5,B00KQHWAR8,"This UK import is a great way to buy all of Eastwood's Universal films on Blu-ray.  These are region free discs, and as the usual case with Universal, extras are sparse.  All of the previous extras seen on the DVDs have been ported over to this release.

I suspect Universal will get around to releasing all of these in the U.S. eventually.  Thus far, they've only graced us with single disc releases of some of these titles.",1416960000,20,425,4.48051948051948

6440424,5,B00KQHWAR8,"Clint Eastwood: The Blu-Ray Collection features seven action films starring Clint Eastwood, and the film Breezy (1973), which Eastwood directed but does not appear in.  The other titles in the set are Coogans Bluff (1968), Two Mules for Sister Sara (1970), The Beguiled (1971), Play Misty for Me (1971), Joe Kidd (1972), High Plains Drifter (1973), and The Eiger Sanction (1975).  These films are mostly solid action vehicles for Eastwood who during the 1970s continued to build momentum as one of the top box office draws in cinema.

These Blu-rays are region free, so they should be playable on most Region 1 DVD players.  The releases are international versions which feature audio dubs in a wide selection of languages, and subtitling in various languages, but strangely English is not included.  The menus feature symbols instead of text, and only one film has any extra features, and that is just a trailer.  The discs have different cover art than the Region 1 releases, and are rated according to the British system for rating films.

As I already owned the DVD version of many of these films, I wondered if a rebuy was justified.  After viewing the improved quality of the Blu-ray versions, I do feel this purchase was worthwhile, as The Eiger Sanction, High Plains Drifter, and Two Mules for Sister Sara in particular, appear to be much improved.  Coogans Bluff and Joe Kidd also look better, but to a less significant degree.

A second question concerned whether to buy this set, or&nbsp;, which features the Region 1 versions of the same seven Eastwood films, but does not include Breezy, which is a cool period drama starring William Holden and Kay Lenz.  From what I could determine, the Universal Collection has a few more bonus features, but the cost was significantly more than this import release, even minus the Breezy Blu-ray.  Fortunately, I got a used copy of the international version set at a very good price.

The discs are housed in individual cases, and packaged in a cardboard box.  None of the films had inserts and there is no booklet accompanying the set.  After sharing the spotlight in blockbuster films like Where Eagles Dare (1968) and Kellys Heroes (1970), Clint Eastwood came into his own as an action star in Dirty Harry (1971).  During the 1970s, after being encouraged by people like Don Siegel, Eastwood began to direct films (including four in this collection), and expand the type of roles he would select.  These would be very productive years for the iconic actor/director, who would later win two Academy Awards for Best Director.",1486857600,8,2576,4.912240184757506

6440437,5,B00KQHWAR8,"This is a fantastic collection. You may find one of the movies, Breezy (directed by Clint) as an odd duck in the collection as he is not in the movie, William Holden is (well Clint does make a un-credited appearance in a boardwalk scene). Yet there is magic in this movie. I was completely taken by surprise to find just how wonderfully charming it was. I am so very happy that this little, unknown and first release on blu-ray made it in the collection.",1424131200,8,454,4.416666666666667
6440438,4,B00KQHWAR8,"Rather than try to review each film individually - for which you can get a better idea about them on Rotten Tomatoes, Wikipedia, or blu-ray.com - this will be about the set as a whole. Even though this is a U.K. Region B release, it's region free and they all play fine on a North American NTSC TV and player locked to Region A. It becomes obvious when playing these discs that Universal created the set for as many countries and languages as possible, including the use of glyphs instead of words for the playback menu (top menu allows language default selection). Likely due to a number of factors including the number of dubbed sound tracks, even larger number of subtitles, and the 1970's era of these films, there are no ""extra"" or ""bonus"" content features, not even original TV or theater trailers.

The real value is getting a number of Eastwood films on Blu-ray that cannot be obtained separately - either at all, or without difficulty. As examples, Coogan's Bluff (the McCloud TV series plagiarized the cowboy sheriff in NYC concept) has only been released on Blu-ray in Germany; region free but one bonus item, a PAL featurette, won't play on NTSC players (the other extras are all cinema HD encoded). Other examples are ""The Beguiled', ""Play Misty for Me,"" ""Breezy,"" and ""The Eiger Sanction"" which haven't been released on Blu-ray individually in any country. I had several of the films in this set already that are available and have subsequently given them away to close friends or relatives. The Blu-ray transfers are quite good given the source film stock and audio for their era. Universal paid attention to color, contrast, audio conversion and general clean-up, but don't expect extraordinary restoration effort. Even so, my impression is the source negatives or prints used were in generally good condition making for good HD transfers.

Overall, this is a great set of ""early"" Eastwood immediately following his Leone ""Dollars Trilogy"" films for which Universal has distribution rights. If you're wondering about other Eastwood films from the same era that are not in this set: Hang 'Em High, Where Eagles Dare, Kelly's Heroes, and Thunderbolt and Lightfoot are UA/MGM. The Dirty Harry franchise is Warner Bro's. I've given it four stars for the films it contains without adding or detracting anything for the Blu-ray HD transfer quality (which is very good). These are among not only his best 1970's work but continue to rank among his better work in the filmography spanning his entire career. Eastwood directed ""Breezy,"" but it's the only film in this collection in which he did not play any role (he is the lead in the other seven).",1421107200,18,2656,4.9

8660809,4,B00KQHWAR8,"This is a UK set but the discs play in my United States version PS4, apparently the discs are still Region 1.  I had difficulty finding the subtitle menu.  It is a box with lines symbol, the last item at the bottom of the menus, you just have to scroll up after selecting the box (it may look like its blank or missing, but scroll up after selecting the box anyway, then they come up).  There are no extras in this set.  I very much like commentaries, so just FYI, none in this set.  The subtitles are a bare minimum for me, so it has that. My brother got me an Eastwood set and I got this to complement it as there are no duplicates: [&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clint-Eastwood-20-Film-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B00BGO4XFM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clint Eastwood 20-Film Collection [Blu-ray</a>]See Link ]

Some of the movies are dated, but worth a watch if you are a movie or Eastwood Junkie.  *Joe Kidd* (1972) is a very underrated film.  I give it a 9.  Written by Elmore Leonard (yes, that *one) and co-starring Robert Duvall it is one of the best western stories you will find in that era. Two Mules for Sister Sara was pretty good.  Other than Joe Kidd and Breezy, my own ratings pretty much track with IMDB's for these movies.  Breezy (1973) is the only one in the set that Eastwood does not act in; he Directs this one.  Breezy is an amazing contemporary window into the post-Vietnam War cultures of Southern California.  It stands out as unique in the set, my only 10 for them.  Play Misty is the first one in this set that he directs.  They are displayed in chronological order FYI.  They span 1968-1975, but are not all inclusive of his work during that time period, only a selection, but a fair one.

*Elmore Leonard has written 3:10 to Yuma, Jackie Brown, Out of Sight (be sure to see this one) and many others.  His non-linear style inspired Quinton Tarantino's style in later years.",1527206400,2,1944,4.769461077844311
