8255060,5,B0014C8G4A,"Very informative.  It contained a lot of information, not just about lighthouses, but history too.  I wish it had covered more, but you can only fit so much into that amount of time.  I hope someday they come out with more episodes on lighthouses with even more information and covering more of the many lighthouses in America, as well as the rest of the world.",1378166400,,361,4.523076923076923
8255061,5,B0014C8G4A,"Beautifully and eloquently depicted representation of America's lighthouses and the attempts by preservationists to save and restore them.  Previously, I had no particular interest in lighthouses except as they appeared in the distance when visiting coastline vacation spots.

How is it possible that a documentary about lighthouses be a tearjerker?  I myself do not know as I have not shed a tear at a movie since the Titanic.  But this will definitely pull at your heart strings.  The historic importance of lighthouses is huge especially with the number of lives they've touched with the building and maintenance of the edifice itself, those who were safely navigated thanks to them and now to the preservationists and tourists giving them due respect.

Highly recommended for an exceptionally well done slice of American history!",1354233600,,833,5.320610687022901
