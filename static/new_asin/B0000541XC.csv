A man in a wagon rides along a road. Five riders race after him, shooting. Six riders approach the stopped wagon and shoot at the robbers. El Puma! The bandits are sent away with a warning. Professor Lucian is on an expedition to excavate Indian burial grounds. The Sheriff will send Deputies for protections. [Note the shape of the Sheriffs badge.] An Old Prospector visits this group for a meal and warns them. Miss Marion Ross meets El Puma. The Old Prospector inspects a tent for reading material. Marion visits El Puma, Jerry objects. That Old Prospector picks up that knife from the ground. Magpie recognizes Carson, who explains his actions after that other Professors death. Is the Old Prospector working for those bandits?

That book tells of buried treasure, but who can read its words? Magpie rides by, he doesnt believe Carson. El Puma warns about Benson, then takes Marion away. Benson and his gang ride after Marion (she can read that writing). There is a chase for action. Marion agrees to translate that obscure language and writes a page. That Old Prospector sneaks up and steals that letter, later he gives it to Benson. The Sheriff and his men arrive, they race after El Puma, and El Puma goes after Benson and Dobie. When the Sheriff arrives Dobie confesses about Bensons earlier murder of Professor Willits.

This has an interesting story but doesnt quite work well. Too low a budget? Would Carsons disguise really fool anybody? Tim McCoy had an interesting life, he was more than just an actor in Westerns. He joined the US Cavalry in WW I and was later promoted to Brigadier General (brevet) in his late 20s.",1405555200,,1665,4.774305555555555
7930607,4,B0000541XC,"This is a review for the ""B"" western, THE FIGHTING RENEGADE
which stars Tim  McCoy in sort of a dual role.

Framed for murder six years earlier Bill Carson (Tim McCoy)
 has changed his identity to El Puma, leader of a gang of
Mexican outlaws. Even though disguised as El Puma, Bill Carson
is still searching for the man who framed him.

When Carson comes across his former assistant Magpie, Ben Corbett,
 Magpie sees to it that El Puma is hired to escort the scientific
expedition he is working for. However, when the professor is killed
with El Puma's knife, and the diary that has information as to the
location of the treasure is missing, El Puma is in hot water again.

Pretty well done ""B"" western with Tim McCoy doing a nice job as El Puma.
Good cast with Joyce Bryant, Dave O'Brien, Ben Corbett and Ted Adams.

7930611,4,B0000541XC,"I have a fondness for Tim McCoy's Lightin' Bill Carson westerns, especially when Tim goes undercover using a disguise to solve the case.
This time the case takes 6 years as Tim/or Lightin' Bill becomes El Puma, a Robin Hood-like Mexican bandido. It seems Lightin' Bill was framed for a murder actually commited by Bad-Guy Link Benson (the great Ted Adams). So Bill goes undercover for 6 years...no matter, to get the goods on Benson in a 52 minute slam-bang, hard-ridin' fun-for-all action classic!
I'd rather watch a quickly made no-holds-barred action western like THE FIGHTING RENEGADE any day over a so-called ""classic"" like HIGH NOON which has way too much talking and way too little action.
McCoy is just great as usual! Ben Corbett plays his old partner ""Magpie"". Bud Buster plays ""Old Dobie"", Ace-heavy Ted Adams is perfect as Benson, Joyce Bryant is the heroine and dependable Dave O'Brien is her love interest. O'Brien (Texas Rangers series, CAPTAIN MIDNIGHT serial, DEVIL BAT etc.) always seemed on the verge of hitting it big and moving on to leading roles in A-features. He was charming, witty and had a winning ""common-guy"" appeal. He will always be one of my favorite low budget heroes!
The ALPHA dvd is acceptable. Some scenes are a tad too dark but over-all it really looks pretty good with lots of sharp images.
Remember,it's directed by penny-pinching cheapskate Sam Newfield, which means tons of low-budget action fun!!!
