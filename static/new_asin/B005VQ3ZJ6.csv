8487557,1,B005VQ3ZJ6,"This movie is the only one I've ever been able to find on the topic of Queen Mary (child of Henry VIII, sister of Elizabeth I).  I was highly motivated to watch it, despite the $30-shipped-from-oversees price and bad reviews.
To its credit, the picture quality was NEVER grainy, the play-in-all-regions really did work in my DVD player, and the occasional subtitles were easy to read.

The images of charred bodies and gruesome medical disfigurements make it a VERY BAD choice to let children watch.  (Teens who watch horror flicks would be a different story.)

Despite that, it FELT like a children's movie because it was so simplistic, so light on information, and lingered overly long in what seemed like all the wrong places.  It's like they wanted to make a picture that was an emotional journey, which first made you feel happy for the pretty little girl, then sad when her daddy got angry, then happy when she got the throne, then wistful that the man might love and choose her, then understanding when she (as the narration explained, quite understandably) started hanging & burning people.

I'm a big fan of historical dramas, both real and fiction:  SIX WIVES OF HENRY VIII, ANNE OF THE THOUSAND DAYS, ELIZABETH R, MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS, LILLIE, Anthony Trollope, Shakespeare, The Great Courses (Teaching Company) classes, Masterpiece Theater, BBC, David Starkey, Elizabeth Gaskell, Jane Austin, DUCHESS OF DUKE STREET, UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS, etc, etc.  None of them, not even the cheesy 1970s things, felt as childish, emotionally manipulative, or empty of detail (even the fluffy ones usually have great cinematography, and the poor image ones usually have lots of drama or information).

So I'm not exactly sorry I saw it, but I'm even more excited/ enthusiastic/ eager about how now I never have to see it again.  EVER! (Yes, it was that bad.)

//UPDATE: It took me a while to put my finger on what felt wrong with this film.  It felt like a propaganda film, like it wanted to sweet talk me into thinking she was ... like a saint or something.  Very discordant with the rest of the historical drama genre that I've experienced before.",1390867200,8,2144,4.857142857142857
