7809109,1,6301038827,"A 'you HAVE to be kidding me' ripoff of Robocop IS literally so bad it's not even funny.  Margaret Trigg is pretty cute but I had to find something positive to say........unwatchable.

Rating is half a star!",1390435200,,207,4.5675675675675675

7809111,5,6301038827,"ROTOR has gotta be one of the very funniest bad movies I've ever seen in my life.

Why isn't it on DVD yet???

You have a female gym teacher scientist who has a giant curly mullet that changes color from scene to scene, you have a black guy that's apparently Native-American who's named Shoeboogie (!!!), you have a prototype robot police officer that's supposedly over 5 years from being functional, yet he gets activated by Shoeboogie's headphones bumping some electronic equipment.  You also get non-stop continuity errors (in the climax, one rope being pulled from a truck magically turns into five ropes being pulled from three different directions) and some of the worst ""snappy"" dialogue I've ever heard.  At one point the main character says to his government superior, ""You fire me and I'll make more noise than two skeletons making love in a tin coffin, brother!""

And they're serious about all of it, the movie is NOT a joke.

Its incredible.  Someone PLEASE put this ultra trash gem on DVD!!!!",1359158400,,1005,4.842105263157895
7809112,5,6301038827,"R.O.T.O.R. is one of those ""so bad it's good"" films that people either love or hate. If you like shows like MST3K, then smile and say ""cheese""!",1259452800,,143,4.333333333333333
7809113,5,6301038827,"One of the most delightfully horrible movies I've ever seen.  So many baffling sequences, so many brilliant bits of dialogue.  One of my favorite characters, Shoeboogie --  jive-talking (Seminole?), Afro-Native-American comic relief -- spouts ""With these cheekbones, I'm an Indian or I'm a sissy!"" while attempting to flirt with his Valley Girl-like coworker scientist.  ""Once you go Red, you never get out of bed!"" he coos. In her notebook, alongside mathematical equations, she scribbles  ""Shoeboogie is a jerk!""  She then flees the scene and it's up to Shoeboogie, the catalyst for the whole movie, to set Rotor on his rampage with his switchblade comb and Walkman batteries.
  I have had the distinct pleasure of having worked with Mr. Cullen Blaine, director of Rotor, on a cartoon show.  He was animation director at the time and, on a whim, a coworker decided to Google him.  We already knew he was an old hand from Hanna Barbera and Disney, but we discovered so much more.  A remarkable man had walked amonst us. Besides Beauty and the Beast II, The Mighty Ducks and a couple other cartoon titles was Rotor.  Unfortunately, Cullen soon left our show for greener pastures (a brand new live action film, even!) and I was chagrined that my VHS copy of Rotor didn't arrive in time for me to get an autograph.  A fine fellow, I wish Cullen well.  It should please him to know that I and my coworkers have learned entire chunks of Rotor dialogue by heart and still greet each other in Coldyronese.  A brilliant bit of folk art and I encourage everyone to buy a copy, since it'll probably never get to dvd.  Enjoy it while you can.  Check out Jabootu's Bad Film Dimension on the web for an insanely in-depth review of the joys of R.O.T.O.R.  But you must buy R.O.T.O.R. and enjoy.  Go.  Hurry!",1060560000,10,1794,4.707395498392283
7809114,5,6301038827,"If you're looking for a great movie about nothing at all, then ROTOR is your kind of film. The fighting scenes are so realistic and the special effects are so ahead of its time. The wardrobe department did an excellent job on putting together outfits (we love tattered plaid!) Female ROTOR is such an inspiration to young women everywhere.  Her color changing mullet, or as we like to call the Chameleon Mullet, is so mesmerizing; we could look at it forever. Watch this movie ""if you know what's good for you.""",1039737600,4,511,4.615384615384615
7809115,1,6301038827,"Actually, it was one of the best bad movies I've seen in a long time.  I saw it on tv one time and I've never forgotten it!  Basically, it's a really bad version of Robocop, but really funny.  The premise is that a robotic police officer, supposedly perfect in every way, goes bad... of course.  He goes on a rampage with much grunting, ""R.O.T.O.R. vison,"" and throwing of weak punches and threats. His one weakness is that car horns make him squinch up his face and put his hands over his ears.  (Actually, he's wearing a motorcycle helmet most of the time, but he puts them where we can only assume his ears would be).  Priceless.  I can't really remember how it ends, but I vaguely remember something involving running him over with a motorcycle and throwing him into a lake.  Yeah, that oughta do it.  Then we see the 'new generation of R.O.T.O.R.s' -- namely, a manly woman robot with a mullet.  I recommend anyone see it, even if only for a good laugh.  It's worth it just to see the female R.O.T.O.R.'s mullet.",1028073600,6,1017,4.443243243243243
