USA.  thanks.",1352073600,,159,4.266666666666667
8080993,4,B000AYQJOW,"My discovery of the popular British detective drama resulted in hours of quality entertainment.  Anyone who was a fan of the American TV show, ""Hill St. Blues"", will notice a slight similarity, although ""The Bill"" allows the viewer to witness the problems and daily challenges of the Sun Hill Station from the perspective of both the officers on the beat and the detectives, who sometimes get in each other's way.  I highly recommend both Series 1 and 2 -- more, if available.",1279065600,,476,4.7926829268292686
