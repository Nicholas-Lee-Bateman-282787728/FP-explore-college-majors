8112470,3,B000EOTU44,"This short series could have been better, I don't understand why the Japanese feel the need to have all the main characters children or little girls, Of course this is not true for Macros Plus which is one of the best animation out there, maybe it's because they left the kids at home.",1239667200,,285,4.39622641509434
8112471,5,B000EOTU44,"Ok the McCross pronounciation of Macross is getting old.  But heck if it irritates you that much you can always watch the Robotech Series to get the true pronounciation of Macross.  But keeping in line with the series, I'm beginning to clearly understand the series better watching SDF in its raw format.  Proto-culture is simply the life before Zentran.  And Zentrans are clones designed for war, so strong they can withstand the vacuum of space.  Well Britai anyway.  And then the biggest catch in this series that I missed on the Japanese version was how Misa discusses the Zentradi  ships falling apart.  The steam rooms and water boilers were leaking, Zentrans are soldiers with no capabilities of creating the ships and maintaining them.  That's the whole plot that ties so many things together for the series.  Humans are able to create and maintain technology.  The Zentrans don't know who their founders are, nor can they maintain their ships.  This adds to the series, and hence re-inforces the reasons for examining and fearing proto-culture (Human life).",1148860800,4,1066,5.0285714285714285
