5901017,3,B00EAZYIMC,"I have watched the first season and was disappointed.  I found it rather boring.  The characters were uninteresting, the acting was more like a stage play, and the sets and costumes were drab.  Hopefully later seasons will improve.",1431388800,,231,5.026315789473684

5901020,5,B00EAZYIMC,"Before there was Downton Abbey, there was Upstairs, Downstairs......The first 3 discs require a little patience as they are setting up the ""Household"".  After that life gets rocking.  What fun, we look forward to each and every episode.  What Fun.  I am so happy to be able to purchase the complete series in one.  If you purchase this, sit back and enjoy........",1428796800,5,363,4.790322580645161

5901023,5,B00EAZYIMC,This is the version to get!  It is remastered with no errors lots of bonus material and even the spinoff.  Revolutionary in its timely controversy!  A bit rough in that the first year was in black and white with poor sound but pretty decent when the technicians strike was over.  A lot more money is spent on DOWNTON but this is just splendid.,1422403200,23,343,4.396825396825397
5901024,5,B00EAZYIMC,"A TV gem period series. This 27-year span epic won 9 Emmys, 2 BAFTAs, Golden Globe & a Peabody Award, 31 nominations. The aristocratic Bellamy's of 165 Eaton Place, London, live upstairs over the downstairs clockwork servant aid led by butler Hudson (Gordon Jackson). Classic Edwardian masterful plots in this funny and dramatic back time-travel over 3 decades inside the Bellamy house. A crowning British achievement in the 70's and worth owning today. Was this the idea gem that inspired ""Downton Abbey?""

Sir Richard Bellamy MP (David Langton) and Lady Marjorie (Rachel Gurney) have heir Lt James (Simon Williams) and Miss Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett-`A Bit of a Do') who need quite a crew downstairs to keep their house in order. Mrs. Bridges (Angela Bradeley) cooks up a storm, while maid Rose (Jean Marsh, co-creator) helps keep linens and affairs tidy. The pilot (an alternate plot pilot available) introduces new servant Sarah (Pauline Collins), who adds saucy spice to the house on both ends of the stairs. Footman Alfred (George Innes) who quotes Bible, Perce (Brian Osborne) is lady's-man coachman during carriage years, Thomas (John Alderton) chauffeur in later auto episodes. The star studded cast is endless.

This new release provides 21 discs in 5 solid cases all in the anniversary storage sleeve. Quite an improvement from the earlier release. 68 episodes, each about 50 min. Add 25 bonus hrs and you have a value, not to mention the dynamic dramatic entertainment including romance, mystery, drama, historical significance, humor, suspense, & more. Episodes 2,3,4,5,&7 are B/W due to a technicians strike. Pilot was remade in color.

SUBTITLES-THIS SET OFFERS SUBTITLES.
SERIES 1: 1903-09, introduces cast, Bellamy house trials, scandal, love, and the delight of seeing the wonderfully differences between the working and upper classes. Great plots in every episode, too many to list. Always sub-plots, upstairs and downstairs. Delightful set and an array of costuming that shows both the upper and lower class dress of the times.
SERIES 2: 1908-10, shows life with a newly married Bellamy, potential fatherhood, and romance downstairs too. All scandalous in high society, as is several topics this show dared to address in the 70s. Cast members playing Sarah and Thomas would eventually marry in real-life.
SERIES 3: 1912-14, the period finds Kind Edward VII is dead and pending war. World war and politics are just a fraction of the turmoil found at house 165. Love upstairs and downstairs is as treacherous as the war trenches. Reason enough for this seasons' best drama series Emmy & Golden globe.
SERIES 4: 1914-18, the Great War is happening, and it touches the Bellamy house stairway ends. Another 2 Emmys won due to struggles with soldiering, war efforts, changes in lifestyle due to war, and love at all times. A fine dramatic, but historical look at WWI, on the London home front.
SERIES 5: 1919-30, the largest span of time. War's end. The 1920's roar, and that impacts the family upstairs as well as the lively help downstairs. But even war fails to change some things, like scandal, family disgrace, celebrations, and again the outstanding drama series Emmy and the prestigious Peabody Award.

After the airing of ""The Forsyte Saga"" (a must series also), Eileen Atkins and Jean Marsh dreamed up the ""Upstairs Downstairs"" concept. Jean stared as Rose. The pair of actresses combined again in creating ""The House of Eliott"", another period saga, bloody good Brit drama, an absolute must own ""complete collection.""
There you have my lengthy opinion, but so much in this anniversary edition. Worth the price. My final recommendation: BUY ""Upstairs Downstairs"", ""The Forsyte Sage"", and ""The House of Eliott."" I own them all and have watched them repeated times.",1408320000,33,3785,5.149593495934959
5901025,4,B00EAZYIMC,Yes very good,1492560000,,13,3.6666666666666665
5901026,2,B00EAZYIMC,Quite disappointed.  British by birth with Brit sense of humour but this didn't do it for me.  Episodes were disjointed and sometimes downright silly.  Can't imagine aristocracy or servants acting as they did in some episodes,1492300800,,225,5.194444444444445

5901036,1,B00EAZYIMC,After reading the reviews on this series I was so excited to receive it hoping it would measure up to Downton Abbey. This particular boxed series is terrible. It's like watching a poorly shot home movie. I really tried to give it a chance and continued to watch but I just couldn't get over the poor story line and the poor production. I recently ordered series 1  of another Upstairs Downstairs which looks like another version. I hope it's a more updated version of the series.,1458691200,3,479,4.569767441860465
5901037,5,B00EAZYIMC,Very good stories.  I can see how Downton Abbey is similar and different story-telling.,1455753600,,87,5.214285714285714
5901038,5,B00EAZYIMC,"What a great series. Nothing today comes close and better than Downton. Longer takes then permitted much great character development. Also quite apparent that Julian Fellows ""borrowed"" most of the plots, settings and characters for Downton.",1455148800,9,240,5.694444444444445
5901039,5,B00EAZYIMC,I bought this as a gift for my mother but I am sure it will meet all of her expectations she has wanted this set for quite some time I'm giving it to her for Christmas,1447286400,,167,3.6666666666666665
5901040,2,B00EAZYIMC,"This is definitely not a replacement or even close to the same quality of acting quality or anything comparable to Downton Abbey. The picture is very grainy, and the acting is not very good. Do not get this if your expecting Downton Abbey, you will be highly disappointed.",1441843200,,272,4.6875
5901041,5,B00EAZYIMC,excellent. good reproduction. enjoyed it very much,1441756800,,50,6.285714285714286

5901043,5,B00EAZYIMC,A very compelling and sensitive program. Beautifully directed and acted.,1440460800,,72,6.3
5901044,5,B00EAZYIMC,Great program! As good as I remember it. In my opinion superior to Downton Abbey.  Expertly written by creators Jean Marsh & Eileen Atkins.,1440028800,2,139,4.791666666666667
5901045,5,B00EAZYIMC,"I remember watching episodes of this wonderful classic show when my parents went away on holidays, Unfortunately I was unable to go with them because I had school to attend and was sent to stay with my dear grandmother, Grandma always loved watching this show religiously and soon I too was enjoying Upstairs Downstairs and loved all the episodes I viewed.

When my parents returned home from their holidays I became very much annoyed  because I was not allowed to view Upstairs Downstairs, This show was simply not their cup of tea.

It took many years before I was able to view all 5 seasons in their entirety and I relished every moment of the episodes I had missed.

I have been so thrilled to finally get this much loved show on DVD and these are going to be thoroughly enjoyed for the rest of my life.

The Upstairs Downstairs Ultimate Collection from Acorn simply has the spin off series Thomas and Sarah included.

The 25 Hours of Bonus Content is very informative and thoroughly enjoyable too.

The included spin off series Thomas & Sarah is quite amusing to watch as they go through various misadventures. But it's not quite up to the same standard as Upstairs Downstairs, But nonetheless an enjoyable. It's a shame it was doomed to only last the one season, I would have liked it to continue for a few more seasons at least.

The DVD's have full Subtitles on every episode which is a great help as after almost 45 years my hearing isn't so sharp any more.

This boxed set of DVD's have the best video quality of this show released on DVD.

It must be remembered that when Upstairs Downstairs was made most British TV shows were filmed on Video Tape. Shows recorded on Video Tape simply don't have the HD Quality you get from Cinematic Film and because of this Upstairs Downstairs is stuck at its 1970's Standard Definition quality and the recordings have suffered from the effects of time.

The only thing you can do is reduce the Sharpness setting on your DVD player to a softer level and adjust the Resolution Output to a lower level.
Also check and see if your TV has PNR(Picture Noise Reduction) function and set that to the maximum picture noise reduction level.
These adjustments will make viewing of older TV shows and movies easier on the eye.

Now it's time to pour myself a nice hot cup of tea, put my feet up and once again visit the Bellamy's and their much loved staff at 165 Eaton Place.

Oh how the wonderful nostalgia filled memories come flooding back when I'm viewing Upstairs Downstairs with immense pleasure.",1439856000,16,2539,4.59070796460177
5901046,1,B00EAZYIMC,"We were quite disappointed. We were
expecting a Downton Abbey feel to the
Series. It had great reviews. Unfortunately
I purchased the entire series. I should have purchased just 1 season. Downton
Is in a class by itself. Buy 1 season before
You buy the entire collection.",1436745600,2,271,4.787234042553192
5901047,5,B00EAZYIMC,Perfect !! Loved this  series !! Missed it when it first came out and always wanted to see the whole edition !! Characters are all perfect !!,1436745600,3,141,4.222222222222222
5901048,5,B00EAZYIMC,"Anyone who is a fan of period drama (or even just fans of Downton Abbey), this series is the best depiction of London society from the early 1900's on.  Being created and filmed in the early 70's, there were still folks around who had lived through that era and gave a much more realistic view of the servant / master of the house relations in those times (whereas Downton Abbey is written with some 21st century values incorporated into their characters, which gives an unrealistic portrayal of what life was really like).  Despite some behind the scene drama, that created some cast changes after the second season, the series carried on and grew stronger every year until the sad finale.  The one thing to know about this particular set is that it is basically the 40th anniversary re-packaged and now including the sole season of the spin-off ""Thomas and Sarah"", so it's essentially 5 year old DVDs with nothing new in the special features department.  Still a great buy when on sale.",1436659200,23,988,4.726744186046512
5901049,5,B00EAZYIMC,"Awesome, awesome awesome!!!!

This is the best British set of videos ever produced. The story is very interesting, and my husband and I love watching these videos. The quality, of course, is not HD but the story is so good, it doesn't matter that the picture definition is standard.

You will never tire of watching these videos. When we finish watching them, we will start over, because the storyline is so great!!",1435622400,2,415,4.75

8603389,5,B00EAZYIMC,i had surgery and was staying with my sister - i purchase this collection and took it to her house with me.  i had to stay in about two weeks or take it easy - she and i love all the PBS/BBC movies and had never watched this when it was so popular.  We started watching ti every evening and sometimes during the day - it was fabulous !  we are huge Downton Abbey fans and both commented it was just as wonderful.  i am so thankful i bought this and gave it to my sister as a gift for taking care of me......for anyone enjoying this period type movie - buy it !!!!,1505692800,3,563,3.912280701754386
