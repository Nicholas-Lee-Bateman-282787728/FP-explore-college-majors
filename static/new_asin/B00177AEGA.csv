3167651,5,B00177AEGA,"""The Reflecting Pool"" is not a documentary. It is an intense drama illuminating the legitimate questions many people have concerning the ""official"" story of 9/11.  I highly recommend this superb film to everyone who cares about the people who died in the towers, and the thousands of soldiers and millions of civilians who've subsequently died in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Many of us wonder if we were lied to about the twin tower attacks and if we're still being manipulated into wars of personal revenge and aggression which have created a living hell for innocent women, children and men in these oil-rich countries.

""The Reflecting Pool"" also raises the specter of authoritarian regimes who massacre of civil liberties and terrorize their own citizens. The characters in this film represent the full spectrum of reactions to these events; some are skeptical, some are certain, and some don't want to know.
The acting is grounded and real, searing and affecting. The cinematography  compells and holds us, the music is somber and foreboding, helping us imagine that something strange has happened in our own country.

In sum, ""The Reflecting Pool"" is asking us to reflect, to think, to question. Are we Americans thinking for ourselves or are we merely mirroring back the version of truth this government is benefitting from making us believe?",1207785600,18,1344,5.1187214611872145
3167652,5,B00177AEGA,"Having spent three years toiling over THE SHELL GAME, researching the lies of the Bush Administration in their attempt to cover up the events of September 11th, I felt I had heard it all, seen it all, and read it all. But the crimes of 9/11 are far more than facts and investigations, what we forget is that this was a crime against humanity, a drama at its most extreme. Just as a Jew I was brought up never to forget the Holocaust, as Americans we must never forget September 11th...but first we must expose ourselves to the truth...truth buried beneath a rubble of expertly manipulated lies. What if Eisenhower had never insisted that the Nazis crimes be filmed and documented? What if concentration camps had been excavated and sent to China for burial before anyone could analyze the crime scene? What if the survivors had been coerced and publicly ridiculed? Just as the Holocaust represents the greatest evil in human history, so too does September 11th represent the greatest CRIMINAL ACT, and The REFLECTING POOL takes the crime and places it exactly where we all must see it...at the human element. You see, it's not enough to discuss war games and cover ups, stand down orders and WTC 7. Instead, we must FEEL the heart-wrenching pain only a parent can feel when they lose a child... we must share their anger and frustration as they are forced to swallow lies from their own government. We must taste the poison pill as it burns in our throats when they realize their loved one is dead because a group of neoconservative fanatics deemed their sacrifice would aid a foreign policy gone amok! Much like The SHELL GAME, the REFLECTING POOL is a tool of truth that elicits an emotional response, and that makes it MUST-SEE! --Steve Alten",1207785600,5,1745,4.705882352941177
3167653,5,B00177AEGA,"I saw this flick at an event in DC last September 11.  It was a pre-release version I think.  Still, it was good.  It is sort of a mystery story.  The main character is a reporter who is assigned to write about 9/11 and he starts to uncover clues and pieces of the official story that don't make sense.  He starts out as a believer in the official government's version of events but by the end he knows the government version is bull.
It is a mix of spy thriller, docudrama, buddy movie, and road movie.

3167662,5,B00177AEGA,"The Reflecting Pool and The Shell Game do not fall neatly into the categories of either propaganda or truthful journalism; they engage us in the drama of large events, the immense personal struggles people go through when they stick their necks out for truth and justice, to prevent major acts of violence against innocent people. They call on our spirit, demand that we pay attention, think for ourselves, not succumb to the mind-numbing lies propagated by an Orwellian press. They help us to see that there is something deeply amiss with the media in this country and encourage us to help change that.

Films like The Reflecting Pool can have a profound effect on society. My own life was changed by Oliver Stones film JFK, which I saw in 1992. It disturbed me and sent me to the library to find out for myself what happened and prompted me to become a media activist. The Reflecting Pool has the potential to stir a persons curiosity in the same way to question the official story about 9/11. The government spends hundreds of millions of dollars to sell the war on terrorism, which is entirely based on the official lies about 9/11. The Reflecting Pool, which was produced on a shoestring budget like most of the 9/11 truth movement, can be a stone from Davids sling that helps to bring Goliath down.

Those of us who challenge the lies of empire believe in the power of truth, that knowledge is power. The more knowledgeable we are as citizens, the more powerful we will be to withstand and rein in the assaults of the tyrannical forces that seek to terrorize and control us. Our strength lies in an unwavering quest for truth, a faith in humanitys inherent goodness, and a willingness to overcome our feelings of separateness and join together in a common cause- The Reflecting Pool is both an introduction and invitation to join in the continuing struggle for truth, peace and justice.",1357603200,,1892,4.712990936555891
3167663,4,B00177AEGA,"The Reflecting Pool is a well made movie which uses the artifice of fiction to bring out elements of truth; because of the many constraints of time and context, it cannot show more overwhelming evidence. I think it could have been more effective if the fictitious protagonists had been more numerous, their voice louder, and the conclusion more overwhelming in order to bring the audience to ask questions of its own. The movie's ending makes it too depressing for anybody to try to make their voice heard.",1240099200,2,506,4.827586206896552

Certainly, nobody wants to believe that our government was involved in the worst example of terrorism since WWII.  Any person, with just a modicum of intelligence, cannot believe that our government is innocent in this.  How could people in the basement of the Towers come out burned if the plane crashed into floors many above the basement?  And, how could the third building implode into itself many hours later?  This is just another example of how these criminals have taken the country hostage and destroyed the image and prestige we have enjoyed for many decades.
