8689299,5,B00PULRSYU,"This is a clash of cultures.  The photo probably looks like everyone is from the same heritage, but actually it is Korean versus Chinese.  Most of the parents' complaints would also be true if it were Asian versus Caucasian so if you know anyone in a mixed marriage you will get tons of laughs from the parents' objections.  Elizabeth Sung is hilarious as the new mother-in-law.  I laughed throughout the film.  And the young couple is as romantic as you could wish for.  I've seen this comedy at two festivals and then bought a DVD.  Anita Ho was Audience Favorite at International Family Film Festival.",1433548800,3,604,4.695238095238095
