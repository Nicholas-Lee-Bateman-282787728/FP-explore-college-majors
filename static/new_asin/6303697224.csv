715477,5,6303697224,"The one thing that made me cringe was no safety vest or face guard or dental protection in earlier bull riders. Not sure how any of them made it out alive. 

I was amazed even the naughtier side buckle bunnies were portrayed. Happy to see Lane was a human. He did make mistakes as all the attention and adoration which sometimes brings upon all athletes .  I know his mother has said Lane was a Christian which the movie never acknowledged. His father wasn't as critical as portrayed in the movie either.

I think the movie was well made. The rodeo bull riding scenes were awesome. Luke Perry did a wonderful acting job. He is very believable as Lane. That is big shoes to fill indeed.

I saw the movie way back  which made me sad for Lane Frost and family. However, I didn't really know who Lane was. I just bought the DVD because I love and respect bull riders now. I understand now why Lane was and continues to be an outstanding bull rider as well as person in bull riding history.

715482,3,6303697224,This is a very good movie.  Based on the life of Lane Frost.  At the time that this really happened I didn't know who he was.  But I remember hearing about it.  The movie came and went pretty quickly and I didn't get a chance to see it.  It is very well acted with good performances by Luke Perry and Stephen Baldwin.  And also Cynthia Geary.  And a good soundtrack with The Oak Ridge Boys and Brooks and Dunn.  This shows life in the rodeo and how dangerous it is.,1488844800,,465,4.088888888888889

715554,4,6303697224,"Luke Perry gave us a wonderful performance of his portrayal of Lane Frost, an American professional bull rider who tragically died in the arena at the 1989 Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo as a result of injuries sustained riding the bull named Takin' Care of Business. One thing the film did not include was that Lane was a devout Christian. In the movie, this was not even lightly mentioned, much to the dismay of both his parents and Kellie. It also portrayed Lane's death showing family present. On the day Lane was killed, there were no family members present. But aside from that (and other discrepancies) it did show people who do not know anything about the sport of bull riding a glimpse of how very dangerous this sport can be and some of the people who choose to follow this path.",1484784000,6,787,4.588652482269503

This is one of my all time favorite movies, and i can watch it over, and over, and over again without it getting old. It has a fantastic story, based on a real life cowboy in the rodeo world. This movie has just about every emotion in it, and you'll feel right along with it. The comedy is hilarious, they did a great job of casting this one!

717388,5,6303697224,"I knew nothing about rodeo's and could not understand the passion to ride a bull that could very well end your career or life.  Well, this movie changed all that.  I have watched ""8 Seconds"" a few times and am glad it's in my library of video's so I can watch anytime.  It to me is one of the most profound stories of a young boy who always wanted to ride bulls and be perfect for his father whom at one time was a rodeo sensational.  He fell in love and married Kelly, a barrel rider.  Kelly found herself neglecting her life dreams to devote herself to Lane's career.
Infidelity played a role in them separating and Lane trying to please his parents with gifts a new home while she and him lived in a rather distasteful trailer.  When Lane and Kelly settled their differences he bought a breath taking piece of land where he and Kelly would build their home and begin a family but Lane had one more ride and there is where my tears begin and continued right up until the end.  It may seem like a simple story but it was told with such passion I get a lump in my throat just writing this review.  Life is so short and you might never get to live out your dreams.  I'd say for the most part Lane did if only his father could have said, ""I love you""",1410048000,4,1248,4.12396694214876

717464,5,6303697224,My husband and I are big bullriding/rodeo fans but I think this movie would appeal to a larger crowd than that. Its a true story which should make one view it in a different light right off the bat. Luke Perry is a charming as the very appealing Lane Frost and Stephen Baldwin seems comfortable as wild - outgoing  Tuff Hedeman. I can not recall the gentleman who plays Cody Lambert but I know the poetry he writes happened and he did contribute to developing the vest all bullriders now wear when they ride. I would highly recomment this movie.,1405209600,,545,4.45

717678,5,6303697224,"If you have ever been to a bull riding event or just watched an event on the t.v. , you may of heard the name , Lane Frost . (I know that fans and basically anyone ever involved with the rodeo circuit know exactly who he is ). But you don't have to be a Bull rider or fan to enjoy this film . In my opinion-this film only lacks one thing - needed to delve a little deeper in his ability . (More than likely)-the film makers wanted to make this more of a love story (to appeal to a bigger audience) . Just seems that way ,because ,there was a lot more to Lane . -- So you pretty much don't have to know anything about the rodeo or bull riding . Just turn the lights down and snug up on the couch with your loved one (ones)-- and watch this film . It is very touching . I don't want to say too much because I don't want to ruin anything for those that never seen or ever heard of Lane Frost .",1389398400,,890,3.7903225806451615

717732,5,6303697224,One of my all time favorites!  Lane Frost was a nice kid who had one problem:  he wanted to please all of the people all of the time.  I think he learned over time that it just isn't possible to do that.  I loved how the movie showed the closeness with his 2 buddies.  Even though they were also competitors it didn't stand in the way of their friendship which is how it should be.  The film also shows how true grit and determination and belief in yourself allows you to accomplish anything you set your mind to.  The dysfunctional father/son relationship disturbed me some but I considered the times and understood that was just the way a lot of fathers were then.  A perfect blend of chuckles at the guys antics and tears at the end.  Luke Perry's best performance ever!,1388880000,,773,4.387323943661972

The site includes information on what is fictional and non-fictional about this film, but overall said it was worth seeing, saying that Luke Perry made great effort to portray Frost as he was.  Having seen the video of Frost at the museum, I have to agree; Perry does a great job in this film.  It is worth checking out the website prior to viewing the film, it does provide insights that enhance the experience of viewing the film. Lane Frost from all I've read and seen, was indeed a man worth remembering.

At least we see that Lane Frost died doing what he loved.

718361,4,6303697224,"I never saw this in the theaters and never really thought I would watch it on DVD since the two main stars are Luke Perry and Stephen Baldwin. But a few years ago I was fiending for some country type movies and decided to give this one a chance. When the movie was over and the credits were rolling I was pretty much in shock of how good the movie was... especially since it was a true story.

Luke Perry plays Lane Frost in this true tale of a champion. Lane begins riding bulls at a young age (actually sheep at that young of an age) and as he gets older, just continues what he loves to do and makes it his profession. Living the dream. That right there is just amazing to me, because there are very few out there who are doing exactly what they want to do. But not only is he living the dream, but he's really good at it. Also he has 2 really good friends who travel with him and also compete with him. One of the friends, Tuff, is played by Stephen Baldwin. Baldwin isn't too bad in this role, but I still think they could've picked a bum off the road and he would've been better. And then Lane, during one of the meets, comes across his future wife Kellie, played by the ever so boring Cynthia Geary.

8 Seconds has some great moments in it and some really funny moments also. I cracked up when Lane brings a really bad trailer home for Kellie... as an actual house for her. She's thinking it's a joke, and he really thought she'd be ok with it. Well... maybe it's funny to me since I know people like that back in Georgia... lol. There are also some really slow parts to and it's mainly cause of some of the acting. Sometimes you'd think you should be watching a romantic part or a good story telling part, and Cynthia or Stephen would just ruin it cause there acting is crap.

When the credits were running, I sat there and thought to myself, ""Man this guy had a crazy good life even if it was ended to soon.""Sure he wasn't perfect. He had major daddy issues, he cheated some, and he was barely home (cause he was out making the money). That doesn't hurt the fact though that he tried really hard to make everyone happy. Maybe to hard for his dad. But he was always there for his fans and a really good role model for the kids. And he tried very hard to give everything he could to Kellie (even though he wasn't always faithful). And you really can't help but smile at the end while they show real pictures and clips of Lane. He was always smiling and you could see how much fun he was always having.

Man this movie really made me miss home. I gotta find me a rodeo to go to sometime here in Vegas.

In the end I would say this movie might feel like a Hallmark movie, but it was a lot of fun at some points. Definitely give it a try.

P.S. - I met Stephen Baldwin once back in 1999. I went to a Wal-Mart back in Tucson one night for some super glue and was walking to the check out counters when I saw a guy dressed in all black and wearing a black Kangol hat. I looked at him and thought to myself, I know this dude... but... from... where...? And then I thought, ""HIGHSCHOOL!"" So since he was seriously just standing around and hanging out at the check out counters I went up to him and said, ""Dude did you go to Northside High School back in Georgia?"" He said, ""Nope."" So I walked away totally confused of how I knew this guy. Then I asked someone in the check out aisle who he was and she said, ""I can't remember his name but that's the Bio Dome guy."" ""Ahhhh... now I remember."" And then I went home with my glue and a fun story.",1234742400,,3542,4.103896103896104

718363,3,6303697224,"After being directed by Amazon's recommendation to ""8 Seconds,"" and reading the reviews, I thought that this would be an enjoyable film and purchased it.  I am not a big rodeo fan, but I do enjoy them once in a while; and I have been friends with several bull riders.  While I enjoyed the film, I cannot say that it really helped me to know more about Lane Frost (portrayed by Luke Perry), his life, career, his relationships with other performers, or his marriage.  Indeed, after watching the film, I found myself looking up more information about Lane Frost on the internet to help me make more sense out of the movie.

What I missed most in the film was the sense of Lane's apparent true love for both his wife and for bull riding.  They are essentially implied; that is, the viewer must assume them or ""look between the lines.""  This may, to a degree, be caused by the director's inability to do so without changing the rating of the film; (but really is something that could have been done without changing the rating if they wanted to do so).  Also, several of the best songs, in my opinion, were wasted on the credits rather than integrated into the film.  If you are a big fan of bull riding or extreme sports, I am sure you will enjoy ""8 Seconds,"" but if you are looking for a good biopic, this film falls flat.

On the other hand, I found the cinematography to be outstanding, and while both Luke Perry and Cynthia Geary (who plays Kellie Frost, Lane's wife) give believable performances, the ""chemistry"" between them was just not there, as far as I am concerned.  Moreover, I feel that the pace of the film was too fast regarding key events and themes, preferring to spend more ""film"" time on the actual ""bull riding.""  I do not think that ""8 Seconds"" has too many bull riding scenes--indeed I think it would have helped to have had more scenes of Lane's ""bad"" rides--but rather that ""8 Seconds"" needs more depth to the other scenes.  I guess, in the final analysis, what I am saying is that the film was edited to be only 105 minutes, when it should have been longer.  Hence, I feel, in the end, that ""8 Seconds"" is a good movie, but not quite as good as other reviewers have rated it.

Please Note: If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews. My goal is to provide help to potential buyers, not get into any arguments. So, if you only disagree with my opinion, could you please say so in the comments and not indicate that the review was not helpful. Thanks.",1220572800,4,2537,4.416309012875536

718450,4,6303697224,"I bought '8 Seconds' expecting to see a movie filled with rodeo action and rodeo life. I got an adequate helping of that, but I also got a whole lot more of something I didn't expect: an interesting movie about a man's relationships with the most important people in his life.

It's interesting to see how Lane Frost was driven to become a champion because he looked up to his father, who had also been a champion rodeo cowboy. The problem for Frost was that his father was never happy with anything less than perfect and, even as great as Lane was, he still wasn't perfect enough. Without his father's approval or encouragement, the championships took on a much lesser meaning than they should have had for Lane Frost, and throughout the film we see how tortured he is by the idea that his father isn't proud of him. After Lane's death, his father laments the fact that he can't remember ever telling Lane that he loved him. The movie makes a powerful statement about the affect that fathers have on their sons.

We also see the effect that long absences have on a marriage as both Lane and his wife, Kellie, become involved in adulterous affairs. Thankfully, the movie makers spare us the graphic details (i.e. no gratuitous sex scenes) and focus on the impact that their actions have on their consciences and their interactions with each other. Through it all, even through the adulterous one-night stands, it's obvious that Lane loved Kellie. The movie accurately portrays a man who tried to be good but who was flawed, which makes it realistic and far better than the idealized portraits of celebrities that movies often provide.

Lastly, we also see Lane's friendships with Tuff Hedeman and Cody Lambert. Obviously this is where the rodeo action comes in, but we also see how they bonded as friends, in spite of being competitors, through many long hours on the road, sharing beds in fleabag motels, and riding in every rodeo they could enter. Hedeman's ride for Frost at the end of the movie is a touching tribute to his fallen friend.

None of the relationships get the in-depth treatment that is sometimes seen in films about parent and child, husband and wife, or best friends, but each of them is developed enough that we genuinely feel like we've come to know something about Lane Frost and the people who were close to him. Oh, and that rodeo action, it's actually pretty good, too.

Due to the profanity (to me, always unnecessary and unfortunate), bar scenes, and adultery (mentioned but not shown - I give credit to the filmmakers for this), this one is not recommended for youngsters. For the adult crowd, it's a good one though, even if you're not a rodeo fan.",1165708800,3,2678,4.677282377919321
718451,4,6303697224,"This director also did ""Rocky"" and ""The Karate Kid"".  A small, enjoyable film about a real-life bronco bull rider named Lane Frost  who became a world champion in his early 20s.  Cynthia Geary, who plays his wife, sure looks like she is Jessica Lange's daughter.  The resemblance is remarkable. And the intense scenes of bull riding.  Why on earth would any man want to do that for a living?  The film really showed the bone-jarring that goes on, and the very real danger once a man is off.  Lane Frost was killed before he had a chance to live.  Somehow, just to be the best at bronco bull riding, while providing entertainment for the crowds, does not seem a worthy endeavor to lose your life over.  The actor who played Lane's dad, James Rebhorn, has been around awhile, and is very good.  In fact, he later starred in the wonderful ""Babe"".  But Geary is not so very good.  She has all of Jessica Lange's woodenness without the intensity inside.  The music was good, country, and so was Stephen Baldwin.",1143072000,,1006,4.553072625698324
718452,5,6303697224,8 Seconds is a great movie about a good man. There are same things that are made up but thats the way thats HollyWood. For the most part it follows the real life story of Lane Frost and his rodeo career. I feel that it is one of the great movies the any down home country loving person should own.,1127520000,,297,3.966666666666667
718453,5,6303697224,"You don't want to miss this underrated, wonderfully acted, brilliantly directed, action packed movie called 8 Seconds. The fact that it's about rodeo bull riding only serves to ""harness"" the real reason the movie grabs you. It's the love story.....that's what gets you.....the love story! Yes the action shots are amazing, even if you never saw a rodeo or thought it was stupid or boring. Luke Perry is outstanding in the title role as the tough as nails (albeit diminutive) bronco busting cowboy Lane Frost. Despite his skinny lanky stature he makes an impressive showing in the title role. Matching him almost line for line is Steven Baldwin (the nice Baldwin) turning in a great job as Lane's wisecracking buddy. Also giving a great performance is Cynthia Geary.....just great as Lane's wife. Every live, every look, every moment she's on camera is so convincing I swear she must have married Luke Perry after the movie. She didn't? Well you could have fooled me! But the really out of this world credit goes to the director John Avildsen who just runs away with this one. Maybe his best work ever! I especially liked the scene where a young Rene Zellwegger knocks on the door playing a rodeo groupie. I expected to hear her say: ""shut up, just shut up, you had me from hello"". But that's another movie. You have to buy this. It's too good not to enjoy over and over. A modern day classic!",1124323200,3,1392,4.685714285714286

718455,5,6303697224,"This movie is amazing. Luke Perry does a great job playing rodeo great, Lane Frost. The movie follows the true story of Lane Frost, and although parts of this movie were created by Hollywood (there was no Martin Hudson, Kellie wasn't there in the end, Cody didn't write poems, etc.) it is still a great movie.

Luke Perry plays Lane Frost, Luke does a great job portraying Lane. Lane's parents, Clyde and Elsie, attended throughout the filming of the movie. As did Lane's best friend, Tuff Hedeman. Tuff could sometimes be heard speaking to Luke and saying ""Lane wouldn't do it that way"", so Luke would stop what he was doing, and start all over, doing it until he got it right.

If you overlook the few ""Hollywood"" moments, this is a great movie. It is without a doubt my favorite movie, and I hope it will be yours too. It's a great movie for rodeo fans of all ages, and even if you're not a fan of rodeo, you will be a fan of Lane's by the time this movie is over!",1104624000,6,967,4.278688524590164
718456,5,6303697224,"Bulls, tight pants, and Stetsons: what more could a girl ask for? In the 1994 movie 8 Seconds, Lane Frost (Luke Perry), an Oklahoma cowboy, travels the contiguous United States in search of the World Champion Bull Rider title. He travels with his two buddies, Tuff Hedeman (Stephen Baldwin) and Cody Lambert (Red Mitchell), also bull riders. They go through many trials and tribulations including the times when each of them getting hurt, acts of adultery, and, let's not forget, Lane falling in love.

  This is my all-time favorite movie. I love the fact that it is a true story. Lane Frost was one of the best bull riders to ever come off the circuit. He was kind, compassionate, and he loved what he did. He never turned a child away when he/she wanted an autograph. The saddest part about the story, however, is that he lost his life doing what he loved to do most.

  This is a story of a true hero. Many cowboys looked up to Lane Frost, both young and old. He was not only looked up to, but he also gained the support and trust of these cowboys throughout his many days of riding. However, we cannot forget that Lane was human and made a few mistakes in his life (e.g. adultery, drinking, cussing), which are presented in the movie.

  This is a great movie to watch with your family, aside from the couple references to adultery and cussing. It teaches values and respect, and it makes you want to love what you do, just as Lane Frost did.",1099440000,4,1447,4.450757575757576
718457,5,6303697224,"I would have to say that 8 seconds is one if my favorite movies. I watch it over and over and cry every time, it never fails. Lane Frost is the best bull rider I know, he is definately the man. He had a lot nuts to keep on riding and don't give up, he had more nuts than Red Rock. Luke Perry was perfect in playing the part of Lane Frost. Every time I see the movie I think about my cousins, friends, and the guys that I don't know and pray the God nothing like that happens. Lane Frost really deserves to be in The Hall of Fame. May God bless his family for holding up.",1071532800,,570,3.8389830508474576
718458,4,6303697224,"When this movie first came out, I did not know who Lane Frost was.  After I saw it, however, I wish I would have known him.  This film may come off as sort of sugary sweet to some, but adultery, drinking, fighting and cussing don't seem so sugary to me.  Mr. Frost had faults.  He was human.  But he prevailed where others have failed.  That is what make him a hero and Luke Perry's portrayal of Mr. Frost exemplifies that.
This movie suffers from a few inaccuracies, but those inaccuracies help move this film along at a pace that non-rodeo people can enjoy.  The acting is fine, and that's really Luke Perry on some of those bulls.  You've got to give the guy a nod for that.
The soundtrack is also very influential on the look and feel of this movie.  ""Once In Awhile"" by Billy Dean is the pinnacle performance in this movie, and if you're eyes don't well up when you hear it, you've got no heart inside.
This is a decent family movie, although some younger kids probably shouldn't be exposed to some of the language and the adultery.  It should be noted, however, that these things are key in making this a real story.
This is a solid movie about a real man, full of heart and fault, yet still a hero to us all.",1068422400,29,1215,4.2663755458515285

I really don't think they could have gotten anyone better to portray him. I saw the movie in the theater probably 10 times , got the book , and own the movie now. My oldest son was named after Lane. I rodeod professionally from 1994 up to 2000 (started out as a bullrider , and then switched over to a Bullfighter), and I'm here to say , I don't know of one single person that that movie hasn't affected in one way or another. Lane touched alot of people's lives , both in and out of the arena. He had a way with kids , and was an ambassador to the sport. This story reaches out and lets you know if you are human or not. If it touches you in a certain way , you'll know. People still make quotes from the movie to this day , and everyone I know that has seen it , has either watched it more than 4 or 5 times , or just bought it. If you haven't seen it. Watch it.

Karl is taking the helm at a time when the PRCA has been forced by circumstances to take a close look at their organization and the future of rodeo and the results have been a new positive look at the future. Rodeo like all sports continues to produce extremely talented athletes and the stock contractors are raising bucking horses and bulls from breeding programs that just continue to produce top quality buckers. Word around the rodeo circuit is that this is set to be one of the best events in the history of the PRCA. Several exciting events have happened within the Professional Rodeo Cowboy Association since the NFR. All good! There is a new man at the helm of the association, Karl Stressman. Karl is certainly not new to the sport of rodeo and to what it takes to put on a top-notch event.

The  fact that it was not an enormous box office sucess only means that the  Silver screen was also not ready to acknowllege his maturation as an actor.
No fan of country music, I actually found myself humming many of the  songs in the movie, and was impressed to learn that Perry actually did his  own line dancing during the wedding scene.

Even when they don't stay on  for the eight seconds they still had their chance to be one with the bull.  Just about all cowboys have dreamt about this since they were kids.

But so what. One thing this film does do is to  reveal a North American Western culture tenaciously clinging to life in a  world that constantly mocks and denigrates it. Lane Frost was, (and still  is), one of the best representatives of this culture. This was the world I  grew up in here in South Texas, where honesty and a person's word meant  something; where ideas of family and faith were REAL and not just political  agendas for republicans and fundamentalist fanatics. Yes, there is a dark  side to this culture, (I also grew  up surrounded by racism and bigotry and  religious nonsense), but ALL human societies have their positives and  negatives. I for one have grown tired of seeing Texans and other people of  the West constantly depicted in film and literature as know-nothing yokels.  8 SECONDS is a welcome reprieve from the usual way westerners are treated,  along with TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL and TENDER MERCIES. And Lane Frost certainly  deserves the tribute this movie gives him.  How long the culture of the  North American West will be able to survive the relentless cynical New  York-L.A.-Perrier drinking-Vegan-Politically Correct but Intellectually  Bankrupt Weltanschaung Machine is hard to say.

This movie showed me that Lane Frost was a man that had his ups and  his downs throughout his short career as a pro bull rider.  It showed me  that rodeo is a way of life that is so unpredictable that you never know  when your last ride is going to be and it showed me that there is more to  rodeo than just getting on a horse, bull, or bronc.  Rodeo is a way of life  and it can bring people together and build those close relationships that  you never want to lose and it can also take away the ones you love.

718822,5,6303697224,"I first watched this video back in 1995 after a friend recommened it.  After watching and crying we purchased our own copy of the video and also the soundtrack cd, which our 6 year old requests all the time, he knows the whole story of Lane's life and can proudly retell it to anyone who will listen.  Lane's life has become part of ours, it is hard for other people to understand how someone who lived on the other side of the world, who we never met has become such a big deal. When our second son was born on the 22nd May, 1998 we named him Lane, in memory of the fantastic Lane Frost.  When our Lane is old enough to understand it will be with great pride we will tell him of the achievements of the man he was named after.
To Mr & Mrs Frost, Thankyou !!!!! I did write to you but I don't know if you ever received my letter, to Robin & Cody what a fantastic brother who have, to Kellie what a terrific guy to have married and to Tuff & Cody a friend who you will never forget. We certainly won't. We are collecting all merchandise EG: posters, Tshirts ect but coming from the Gold Coast in Queensland Australia it is a bit hard. If anyone in  the USA has any extra info that I could possibly send over a cheque for could you please post me the details. Thankyou

Lane Frost was truly one of the best all around cowboys this world could have known, and Luke Perry did an excellent job portraying him, made it very believable. i would reccomend this movie to anyone who has a heart. 5 stars is truly not enough.
