2510009,1,B000E8N9D8,This is a TV show and the production was terrible. Didn't watch after 10 minutes. the movies are so much better.,1390953600,5,112,4.380952380952381
2510010,4,B000E8N9D8,"A classic.  Anyone who has seen TV from the late 40s or early 50s will relate.  The method for product placement is priceless.  A little cheesy perhaps, and not subtle.  But probably effective for its day.",1266105600,5,205,4.611111111111111

2510012,4,B000E8N9D8,"I am 66 years old ;one of the first television shows I saw was Martin Kane. The shows are somewhat corny but fun to watch. I remember Martin and others meeting in the tobacco shop discussing the crime with Happy,the owner. You will love the shameless plugs for pipe tobacco and cigarettes for the sponor of the show. I forgot how many Martin Kanes there were but you will find three who played the part on Volumn one and two,Martin Kane,Private Eye. I am very happy with my purchase of Vol. one and two and hope there will be more Martin Kane dvd's for sale.",1159142400,6,558,4.3238095238095235
