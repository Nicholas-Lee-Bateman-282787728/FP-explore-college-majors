589498,4,6303131123,A fun western not to be taken seriously. Clint Walker is superb as the tough sidekick and Telly Savales shows he can actually sing when he does a song at the end credits.  Walker is a great singer but that talent is not used in this picture.  The dvd is excellent quality and Chuck Conners is over the top with his portrayal of an obsessed army officer.  Panco Villa as played by Savales comes across as kojak pretending to be villa. Ann Francis has a bit part as Walker's wife but it's a wasted role.  Walker doesn't even get to kiss her.  Nonetheless it's an entertaining movie and I got a big kick out of it.,1262995200,2,611,4.232758620689655
589499,5,6303131123,"The GENEON DVD is the one you want...a beautiful widescreen print of an often put-down Spaghetti Western. Along with CAPTAIN APACHE, A TOWN CALLED HELL [...],BAD MAN'S RIVER & SAMURAI (THE WHITE,THE YELLOW & THE BLACK)this is one of the most shunned of the genre. Am I the only person who likes these movies??? Each one is a STRANGE/UNIQUE look at American/standard Westerns, deserving of critical attention...Yeah,OK...It's not Sergio Leone, and it's not even Giuseppe Colizzi or Sergio Corbucci...but this is a well-directed (Eugenio Martin of BAD MAN'S RIVER),well-produced non-historical account of Villa's slam-bang Spaghetti Western raid on Columbus,N.M...Relax & enjoy...the camera work is great, the acting top-notch(Chuck Conners is a standout!!!)and the overall production values are better than most...so buy this at such a bargain price, buy a six-pack of your favorite Mexican beer, open the taco chips & join Pancho's bandidos/soldiers in their quest for Spaghetti Western political un-correctness...VAMOS A MATAR COMPANEROS!!!!!",1157760000,15,1043,5.779220779220779

Once it was over, and I accpeted it for what it is, I watched again and loved it. It's fun and funny and the finale is fantastic.

589501,5,6303131123,"Savalas, Walker, and Connors are excellent in this very goofy and often extremely laugh inducing comedy about Pancho Villa's invasion of the United States. This is one of the most insane films I have ever seen! Enjoy the cast and the wacky stuff, but don't even try to take this movie serious. It's truly a camp classic! Telly is phenomenal!",1092873600,6,341,4.7
589502,1,6303131123,"Quite simply put, this is the silliest movie I've ever seen. There are no characters, only characatures; virtually nothing is believeable. The Army officers are all boobs; the enlisted men are stupid beyond comprehension. There is nothing other than the names of Villa, the 13th Cavalry, and Columbus, New Mexico to connect this fiasco to the real world, and Mexicans are portrayed in the most condescending and stereotyped fashion imaginable. The attempts at humor are at best amateurish and at worst infantile. Why anyone wasted the time, money, and resources to make this film is incomprehensible; I needn't mention acting talent because there isn't any. At least the film appears to be properly exposed in most sequences. Don't waste your time!",1041638400,,748,5.190082644628099
589503,3,6303131123,"Read any online movie review and chances are you will find at least one writer who carps endlessly about the various historical inaccuracies of such and such film.  As though that is the end all and be all criteria for  a good period film.  Well, I imagine such a person would have a field day  with this version of Pancho Villa starring Telly Savalas.  The only problem  is no one would care.  Simply put, Pancho Villa is a jokey and  light-hearted action film.  At least it tries to be.  In actuality, it's  slow-paced and only mildly diverting.  As portrayed  by Telly Savalas,  Villa is a boorish, self-centered bandit recently deprived of his hair  while held captive by nemesis General Goyo(Antonio Casas).  Clint Walker  plays his American friend Scotty, who goes to Columbus, New Mexico to buy  arms for Villa.  Double crossed by the dealer, Scotty barely survives an  ambush and makes it back to Villa to report the bad news.  Ever the glory  seeker, Villa comes up with the brilliant idea to cross the border into  Columbus to get revenge, except do it under the guise of a military  invasion. From there, all sorts of hijinks and gunplay ensues, including a  game of chicken between two trains manned by Villa and Chuck Connors as a  wild-eyed, spit-and-polish, calvary colonel.  Plenty of noise, but  curiously little energy.  Savalas and Connors duel with each other in the  scenery chewing department, hamming up their respective roles as if it were  their last.  'Ol Telly even gets to sing the closing song over the credits!  And director Eugenio Martin would redeem himself for this film and the  excreable Bad Man's River with Horror Express.  Some kudos go the DVD by  MasterTone, which has a fairly clean looking print and letterboxed it to  boot.  Certainly as good as I've ever seen this movie.",960681600,10,1816,4.775974025974026

589554,1,6303131123,"This is listed as ""Action"" and ""Western"" on Netflix instead of Foreign and plainDumb. This movie is pure malarkey,Telly Savalas(Kojak) is one Cool Cat,however this movie is a snooze. First Despite my name and my looks I am Not Mexicant(intentional)or ""Chicano"".so I do not share the zeal and admiration for the so-called Revolution or the many bandits before or thereafter.(If I am wrong,please tell me what state Mexico is in now?the same state it was many years ago. Despite the Spaniards educating them and bringing Catholicism to Savages who would sacrifice their own still no Progress sadly Hundreds of years later.)If you think My views are wrong,that's too bad it is a free country and free speech and Yes I was born here. Secondly,Pancho Villa is Like a Che,A Murdering,Thieving Man not a Hero or a Martyr. A Bandit is too nice of words to describe him,the movie despite it's horrible direction shows what a Despot Pancho was. Of Course many people don't realize this when they buy the shirts of him and Viva Zapata at Walmart(Irony?)and Che. For every Revolution there is a Counter-Revolution,and all revolutions except The American end badly as History shows. If your looking for a Movie to watch or an interesting Character,I would pass on this one. You could see if you like,I did but just know your watching a bunch of GuerillaChicPropaganda which during this era was all the rage with Rich Anglo CollegeLiberals.",1329782400,,1426,4.945833333333334
589555,1,6303131123,"Pancho Villa (1878-1923) is probably the most popular Mexican personality who has been immortalized in film. He was a bandit turned revolutionary who became a Governor (Chihuahua) and a major player in the Mexican revolution. Wallace Beery won an Oscar playing him in 1934 (""Viva Villa"") and other actors to play him include Leo Carrillo (""Pancho Villa Returns""), Alan Reed (""Viva Zapata""), Yul Brenner (""Villa Rides""), Pedro Armendariz Jr. (""Old Gringo""), and Antonio Banderas (""Starring Pancho Villa""). Pedro Armendariz Sr. played him 3 times (1950, 1957, and 1960) in Mexican films.

The film focuses on Villa's attack on the U.S. in 1916.

Telly Savalas (1922-94) plays Villa. He's best known as Kojak for which he won an Oscar and a Golden Globe in 1974, but he also made 50+ films including acclaimed performances in ""Birdman of Alcatraz"" (1962), ""Battle of the Bulge"" (1965), and ""The Scalphunters"" (1968). But most of us will remember him best for his role as the psychotic Maggot in ""The Dirty Dozen"" (1967).

Clint Walker (1927) plays Villa's sidekick and also appeared with Salavas in ""The Dirty Dozen"" (1967). The 6'6"" Walker is best known for his TV series ""Cheyenne"" (1955-63)

Chuck Conners (1921-92) plays a U.S. Army Colonel. The 6' 5 "" Conners is best known for his TV series ""Rifleman"" (1958-62).
Writer and director Eugenio Martin (1925) made 30 films, most of them Spanish.

The top grossing films in 1972 included the terrific western ""Jeremiah Johnson"" along with ""The Godfather"", ""The Poseidon Adventure"", ""Cabaret"", ""Deliverance"", and ""The Getaway"". The big Oscar winners were ""The Godfather"" (Picture, Actor) and ""Cabaret"" (Director, Actress, Supporting Actor). Other memorable films from that year included ""The Candidate"", ""Last Tango in Paris"", ""The Ruling Class"", ""Way of the Dragon"",  and ""Pink Flamingoes"". Westerns from 1972 include ""The Cowboys"", ""High Plains Drifter"", ""Dirty Little Billy"", ""Ulzana's Raid"", ""Junior Bonner"", ""Bad Company"", ""Joe Kidd"", ""Buck and the Preacher"", and ""The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean"".

This Spanish production was basically made to take advantage of the notoriety of the TV actors who star in the film. Its major purpose was to make some money. It's not completely without merit - you get to see Telly Savalas get his head shaved in the first scene.

If you're interested in Pancho Villa, Beery's 1934 film will be of interest as well as ""Viva ""Zapata"" which deals with him peripherally. To my knowledge no one has ever really captured this very interesting and unique individual.

BTW - If you think that Savalas makes a poor Mexican, here are some equally ludicrous examples of non-Mexicans who took on a role as a Mexican - Burt Lancaster in ""Valdez is coming"" (1971), Paul Newman in ""Hombre"" (1967), Wallace Beery in ""Viva Villa"" (1934), Marlon Brando in ""Viva Zapata (1952), Eli Wallach in the Spaghetti westerns, Rod Steiger in ""A Fistful of Dynamite"" (1971), Yul Brenner in ""Villa Rides"" (1968), and Charlton Heston in ""Touch of Evil"" (1956).",1307836800,4,3020,5.121951219512195

This flick was an obvious attempt at an ""Airplane"" style comedy knockoff. The excellent actors must have been hungry or drunk to participate in such a flop. Poorly written and directed, the jokes (if you could call them that) didn't work. A real yawner. A little worse and it could have at least been campy, but it wasn't even that.

I tried hard to appreciate this disjointed film from some perspective but it was so poorly done I'm not sure it even deserves a review.",1282694400,,471,4.476744186046512

7840247,3,6303131123,"Released in 1972 and directed by Eugenio Martn, Pancho Villa is a Western farce starring Telly Savalas as the eponymous Mexican revolutionary general who decides to invade America with his raid on Columbus, New Mexico, a town three miles from the border, on March 9, 1916. Clint Walker plays his right-hand man, Scotty with Anne Francis as the latters wife in a troubled marriage. Chuck Connors plays the US Army officer assigned to repelling the raid.

In real life, Pancho was commander of the northern division of the Constitutional Army and governor of the northern state of Chihuahua, Mexico. He was in line for leadership of Mexico and thus had the sympathy of the US Feds who ultimately forsook Villa in favor of his rival, Carranza, who defeated Villa in two major Mexican battles in 1915. Embittered, Pancho took his wrath out on America with his raid on Columbus, which was a slap in the face to the USA, resulting in the death of 8 American soldiers and 10 civilians. Woodrow Wilson retaliated by sending General Pershing and a punitive expedition into Mexico to apprehend Villa. They went pretty deep south of the border, capturing and killing several of Villa's lieutenants, but failed to capture the famous revolutionary himself. The Perishing expedition ended due to Mexican protests and the US entering into WWI. Villa died seven years later when assassins ambushed his car in Parral, Chihuahua.

The movie focuses on the Battle of Columbus and is an odd mixture of serious drama/violence and utterly goofy comedy, like the ridiculous kill-the-fly sequence, which I guess was to make fun of Connors more-military-than-thou character. Due to the farcical elements its hard to take the radical violence seriously. Is it funny to see Mexican citizens shockingly shot on the spot at Villas whim? Is it funny to see American soldiers & civilians slain during the raid on Columbus? For me, this absurdly incongruous tone ruins the movie. Despite my cavils, Pancho Villa is somewhat entertaining as a what-were-they-thinking early 70s curiosity, not to mention Savalas & Walker are amusing as the protagonists and Connors as the often silly antagonist. As for Anne, she was still stunning. For anyone whos interested, Savalas sings the credits song.

Obviously this movie shouldnt be taken too seriously, but it IS somewhat amusing, highlighted by a great train collision at the climax, not to mention the movie DOES inspire you to research the real-life events.

A joint English/Spanish/American production, the film runs 92 minutes and was shot in Spain.
