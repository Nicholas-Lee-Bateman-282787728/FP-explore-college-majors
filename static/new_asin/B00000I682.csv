1219152,5,B00000I682,Great movie that most people have never heard of before.  It's sort of like the Indian Jones films but not as good because of lack of budget.

1219160,5,B00000I682,"I remember when this movie was released.  My brother and I LOVED it and watched it every chance we got.  These were the days of the huge satellite dish service, so we were fortunate to watch the movie, then switch over to the west coast broadcast and watch it again.  The music is awesome and I still hum the theme song often.  I watched this again recently and found that I didn't remember it being so violent, but it is still a great movie.  And, really, what movie isn't great with Tommy Lee Jones in it?!?!?!?!",1388016000,,514,4.3125
1219161,3,B00000I682,"It is your classic men's adventure film, with warrior women and evil villains. The story takes place during the late 19th century somewhere in the Southwest Pacific, possibly Samoa. During this period the Germans were looking to establish coaling bases for their growing naval fleet. In their desperate efforts to procure such harbors, the German Baron turns to Hayes' less than ethical rival. Eventually, Nate's kidnapped wife is offered as a human sacrifice to an island leader who might grant the Germans harborage.

After Nate and Hayes rescue the latter's wife, the Germans pursue the swashbuckler Hayes and his companions in a steam powered gunboat, while the heroes are trying to escape in a sailing vessel. The Germans decide to board the sailing vessel in order to recapture the girl.

The main reason I watched the movie was to look at the German gunboat. It strangely looks like a small British monitor from World War I. Two, I found it interesting that the enclosed turret on this vessel was hand powered and not steam powered. Three, had the Germans been serious about gaining a harbor, they could easily have sent a cruiser to shell the head hunter's village, and then sent a detachment of marines to finish them off. But then you wouldn't have a movie.

Nate and Hayes is a laughably enjoyable play on history.",1386892800,,1325,4.853982300884955
1219162,5,B00000I682,a cable classic I enjoyed as a child with the whole family. High adventures on the high seas and only the way you could make a film in the 80s. this was Pirates of the Caribbean before all the CGI and over the top characters.,1386547200,,225,4.022222222222222

1219165,5,B00000I682,"I was surprised when I saw this on TV so many years ago. I recorded  it and my copy over the years has degraded considerably, was very happy to finally see it released on DVD.
As far as I know, this is the only ""swashbuckler"" film he ever made, he has made some great films over the years, the most recent that I really enjoyed was his ""In The Electric Mist"".
 He got lost in the Lincoln movie, overshadowed by the story itself. If you are a ""swashbuckler"" fan, check this one out, I highly recommend it.",1369008000,,504,4.185567010309279

1219167,5,B00000I682,"Want to see Tommy Lee Jones when he was young, dashing, and didn't have a face that looks like a road map?  How about a pirate story where the pirates are both the bad and good guys?  A very pretty girl, cannon fire, swordplay, nasty natives, and a lot of action?  No?  Then read Dickens and go back to sleep!",1361145600,2,309,4.1

1219171,5,B00000I682,"I love this movie. It is also known as Savage Islands. It is very much a Precursor to the modern Pirates of the Caribbean films - Loveable rogue, and 2 prim and proper sidekicks that end up on an adventure with said loveable rogue and his crew. Filmed mostly around New Zealand and the pacific islands.

Great film.",1330473600,,315,4.431034482758621

1219176,5,B00000I682,"Excellent movie, one of Tommy Lee's finest.  He makes a very good swashbuckler, the original Jack Sparrow.  I saw this movie back when I was young and had forgotten about it.  Now, 25 years later, I got to thinking about it and put it on order.  Just as fun as I remembered it being, my 15 year old daughter enjoyed it just as much, even though he is an ""old man"" now to her she enjoys the movies like ""Missing"" or ""US Marshals"" with him as well.  It was fun for her to see him as a younger man.",1278633600,,495,3.95959595959596
1219177,5,B00000I682,"Tommy Lee Jones is a big name in Hollywood but what people don't realize is once upon a time he starred in a movie called Nate and Hayes. This movie was one of my childhood favs. I had it on VHS and wore the tape out to the point of snapping. I have been searching for this movie for years. Imagine my surprise when I saw it on AMAZON in DVD format of course I had to snap it up. When it got here I opened it up and watched it non-stop three times.

What surprised me was I expected after all of these years to laugh at the bad acting or a bad script or even to scoff at the special effects at the time being so bad compared to the superior quality we get today. I didn't! It stood the test of time and delivered a quality story with equal parts action, romance, and humor with special effects/stunts that could easily place it on the silver screen today and no one would be the wiser that it was made so many years in the past.

Having said that I know must tell you that very few people know of this movie which lead many to believe it wasn't very good or since they have never heard of it they should pass it over. STOP! There is an old saying, ""Never judge a book by it's cover."" In this case never judge a movie because you've never heard of it. Snap it up, watch it, love it, pass it on! It is a great action flick and if you are anything like me you will swear it is one of Tommy Lee Jones's better roles. By the end of the movie you will be saying, ""How come I never heard of this movie before?"" or I didn't write this review! ENJOY!",1269648000,,1541,3.9358974358974357
1219178,4,B00000I682,"With a family connection, I had to buy this movie Bully Hayes (our spelling has changed over the years) was my great great grandfather, kinda cool having a for real pirate captain in the family!

1219182,5,B00000I682,"I cannot believe I found this gem on DVD but I did.  I remember begging my mom to let me watch this movie all the time when I was little.  When the poor Beta machine died I cried inside, we didn't have it on VHS.  My boyfiend and I were looking at movies on Amazon when I happened upon it and almost screamed.

This underrated movie is about Bully Hayes who is played by Tommy Lee Jones.  He is destined for hanging when he tells a reporter/author a 'memory.'  This memory involves Nathaniel and Sophie who are going to be married and becoming missionaries.  Bully drops them off on the appointed island they are to go to.  'Blackbirders' or slavers who use Bully's symbol of the raven kill Nathanial's Aunt and Uncle, capture many of the islanders (and kill those they don't take), knock him out cold, AND kidnap his fiance during the wedding cerimony.  That is just the start of this movie.  It is a good adventure and fun to watch.",1256947200,,934,4.377906976744186
1219183,5,B00000I682,"This is a great action movie which for some reason didn't make too much of an impact in the theaters. It is full of action, adventure, unexpected twists & humorous dialogue.

1219184,4,B00000I682,"A modern pirate film that pits the good honorable pirate Bully Hayes against the truly bad, self-serving pirate Ben Pease.  This film takes place at the end of the sailing ship era as steam powered ironclads make an appearance as the German empire attempts to gain a foothold in the south pacific.
A fun adventure with mild blood and the required violence expected in this type of movie.",1219795200,,387,4.6911764705882355

1219187,5,B00000I682,I have loved this movie for years.  After seeing Tommy Lee Jones in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof I didn't like him too much.  This swashbuckling adventure changed my opinion drastically and made me realize what a great actor he is!,1207440000,,224,4.309523809523809

If you like pirates, and chases, and sword fights, and suspense, and romance in the purest form of the word, you will like this movie.  This is the flick that made me a fan of Tommy Lee Jones.  It never takes itself too seriously.  Enjoy, enjoy.  May your swash never buckle.",1184284800,,343,4.059701492537314

In Australia this movie had the title ""Savage Islands"", which in my opinion was a much better title than the lame sounding ""Nate And Hayes"".

This is a great flick for any lover of adventure movies, and its not as B grade as some reviewers have made it sound. If you have actually looked this up on Amazon then you are the kind of person who will like this movie - just buy it as its cheap and more than worth it.

But it was a good pirate-style film with action to keep you awake. The reason I bought the film is because Bully Hayes married my great-great aunt.",1173312000,2,321,3.953846153846154
1219191,3,B00000I682,"This film is not the quality one would expect from a name like Tommy Lee Jones but it does have its moments. Watching it is like watching an old B movie serial with more modern effects like color and scripts.

Jones plays Capt. Bully Hayes, a south seas scoundrel with a reputation for piracy. He is hired to transport a young couple to the island where they plan to marry and become missionaries. The young lady on her way to be married is a bit nervous. She does not seem like she is ready to settle down to such a calm life. Even so, she is resigned to it but not without a little act of defiance. She takes some of her money to ""invest"" in the dashing captain's maritime exploits.

After dropping the couple off, the couple's island is raided by slavers who think they have killed everyone except the girl, who is naturally taken prisoner. They try to leave evidence implicating Hayes and plan to use the girl to trade to a barbarian king in exchange for basing rights for the expanding German navy. She is to be a human sacrifice in the style right out of the Saturday matinees.

Meanwhile, Capt. Hayes has decided that he has a romantic interest in the girl and turns back to get her. He find a very hacked of fianc who believes that Hayes is the cause of all his woes. Together, this unlikely pair head out to rescue the damsel in distress, take on the Imperial German Navy and clear the Captain's name.

The film is full of unlikely plot devices and rube Goldberg contraptions but it does have a certain brassiness about it. It was fun to watch but is certainly not worth keeping near at hand. It might be best suited for entertaining some unruly boys on a rainy weekend.",1171324800,5,1679,4.371794871794871

Plenty of action for the boys and a little romance for the girls! I've been searching for this movie for years, ever since I saw it on an airplane when I was in elementary school. I never knew the title, all I knew was that it was a swashbuckler and had a girl in a white dress and headhunters in it. Thanks to an e-bayer for selling his videos from the 80's, I finally found it and ordered this DVD for my father who always wanted to see it again too!",1167782400,2,572,3.982608695652174

There was a Bar called ""Bully Hayes Place"" we used to go to. I made sure I had a copy of the movie so I could always show my friends. If you like Action and Adventure this is a can't miss.

Captain Bully Hayes (Tommy Lee Jones), on the other hand, may have been chopped up a bit by the harsh realities of the 19th Century and the dregs of colonialism in the South Pacific, but his moral compass still points true north.

One of this movie's amazing accomplishments is capturing the loose view of the law and the adventurous spirit that we associate with pirates, while still keeping the protagonists on the right side of morality.

I never heard of this movie when it was released in the 80s.  I ran across it on VHS, and I've about worn that tape out.  Now, at last, I can get it on DVD.",1150848000,3,793,4.324324324324325

This has everything a pirate movie needs: swashbuckling action, chase scenes, naval battles, pretty girl, handsome boy, grizzled pirate captain (played perfectly by Tommy lee Jones), humor and just the right amount of gore to make it realistic.

It's a shame the film wasn't marketed right.

It's really very good - watch it.",1150675200,3,474,4.8875
1219199,5,B00000I682,"Although not a ""Box Office Hit"", this is one of my all time favorite movies.  I have waited years for it's release on DVD.  It takes place in the mid 1800's, while Pirates still prowl the South Pacific.  The movie has something for everyone; A Love Story, A Comedy, Pirates, Cannibals, Swords, Cannons and an action adventure in a ""Historically correct setting"".  Memorable performances by Tommy Lee Jones & Michael O'Keefe in the title rolls.  A must have for anyone's DVD collection.",1143763200,6,485,4.865853658536586

1219202,5,B00000I682,"There are some movies that are meant only to be both hightly enjoyable escapist watching and great to eat popcorn while watching it.  Nate and Hayes is one of those movies.
Nate and Hayes is about pirates in the South Pacific.  Tommy Lee Jones plays Captain Nate ""Bully"" Hayes while Michael O'Keefe plays the starchy minister, Jenny Seagrove plays O'Keefe's wife and Australian actor Max Phipps is the evil Captain Ben Pease.
The action starts when Captain Pease raids the island right after the marriage ceremony for the minister and his wife.  The minister is struck unconscious and his wife is taken prisoner by the evil Pease.  The minister then joins forces with Captain Hayes who has his own score to settle with Pease and that's when the fun begins!
Nate and Hayes is a much underappreciated family film classic.  Thrills and chills abound in this wild and wacky fun fest.  This is a great film for all ages and for families in general.
Heartily recommended.",1089158400,5,965,4.783132530120482
1219203,4,B00000I682,"I had this on Beta years and years ago. Why this isn't out on DVD by now is beyond me. Any fan of Tommy Lee Jones should love it. Fans of adventure and pirate movies will enjoy it as well. Jones and Michael O'Keefe are a good team in this lighthearted action movie. The story, acting, music, and directing are borderline great. Unfortunatly it didn't catch on at the time of it's release and most of the following is people that lucked upon it on TV or at a rental store.
Any fan of movies like ""The Three Musketeers"" or ""The Mask of Zorro"" will probably enjoy it. A great adventure movie with a mix of Indiana Jones and Pirates. We can only hope with the release of movies like ""Cutthroat Island"" on DVD this won't be overlooked since it is a notch above several all ready available. It may not measure up to ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" but it still has a good deal of fun and action. There are no great special effects, just a good story and some decent acting.",1087948800,22,962,4.262295081967213

1219205,5,B00000I682,"This movie is a GOOD time waiting to happen.  It's simply fun.  Lots and lots of fun.  More fun than a sack of badgers.  Tons of action, great fight scenes, excellent humor, and fantastic cinematography.  I'm surprised we don't get more movies set in the South Pacific (except, of course, for the deadly sharks, destructive typhoons, remoteness, lack of modern medicine, headhunters and posoinous everything; some people are just more easily deterred than I am, I suppose.)
If you're looking for a good, entertaining romp with great catch phrases and plenty of action, this is it.  The music's pretty good, too, by the way.  WHEN IS THIS COMING OUT ON DVD!?!?!?!?!?  I must have it!  Oblige me, Ben!",1019433600,20,699,4.8559322033898304
1219206,5,B00000I682,"Fun! Is the word to describe this film. This film wasn't well known nor was it a big blockbuster, but it is fun to watch. Seeing Tommy Lee Jones younger and with a beard is different. This film was made in 1983 so don't expect big and flashy special effects. Even without big special effects this movie is still a fun adventure story.
Tommy Lee Jones plays American Pirate ""Bully"" Hayes. Nate is played by Michael O'Keefe, and he is studying to become a missionary. The story starts out in the South Pacific where we see Captain Hayes running guns to the natives. He is captured when the deal goes bad and is set to be hung shortly thereafter. The rest of the story is of Hayes telling a writer how he came to be imprisoned, sort of a Quentin Tarantino style before it became popular. The main story revolves around Hayes' adventure with the missionary man Nate and his Fiance Sophie. Hayes' Nemesis, another pirate and former business partner Ben Pease, captures Sophie. The adventure consist of the usual story of this type, Nate and Hayes teaming up to get her back. This film is a complete adventure story filled with pirates, South Pacific natives, shrunken heads, early modern war ships, stuffy German sailors, swashbuckling sword fights, and other off the wall elements. I recommend this film to you if you are looking for something fun and a little different than the usual big flashy movies of today.",999129600,7,1409,4.662650602409639

7909602,5,B00000I682,"Nate and Hayes is most definitely a "" Pirate Movie"" !!!  I was in both the U.S. Army & the U.S. Navy & breaking any law on the sea, rivers or lakes can earn you the label of Pirate!  This has happened to Rum Runners, Black Birders, Gun Runners ( as Captain "" Bully"" Hayes is labeled.) Theft of a ship or any sea going vessel & robbery as well as holding prisoners for ransom which we see still going on today!!!  True... Pirates have replaced their cutlasses for Machine Guns but they are still called pirates!!!  As far as action at sea "" Nate & Hayes"" clocks in as much time on the sea as "" Captain Blood"", "" The Black Swan"", "" Sea Hawks"" or any other Pirate movie you have seen!!!  This is a outstanding Pirate film with exotic locations, Flora & Fauna as well as cannibals & your typical rival pirates.  In fact  Captain Bully Hayes's main adversary isn't the law but a rival!  I don't want to go into to much detail & spoil the movie but as far as the 80's go there is not a lot of Pirate movies to choose from.  I would say this is a must have for collector's of Pirate films & a fun filled adventure for movie viewers of all types.",1496361600,2,1138,4.067264573991031

7909605,5,B00000I682,"My chief objection to calling Nate and Hayes (also released under theunfortunatetitle Savage Islands) a pirate movie (although its called that even on the DVD cover) is that today pirate movie tends to evoke images of Captain Jack Sparrow, dancing skeletons, and barnacle-encrusted, supernatural nightmares with tentacles instead of facial hair--as opposed to films like Captain Blood, Against All Flags and The Black Swan (the one with Tyrone Power, not Natalie Portman). Nate and Hayes is actually a seagoing, action-adventure story in the spirit of Wake of The Red Witch and Reap the Wild Wind and is a lot closer to reality (cmon it is a movie after all!) than the fantasy of Pirates of The Caribbean. Nor is there a kraken to be seen, though there is an iron-hulled dreadnought that does a pretty good impersonation of onefor a while . . .

What we have instead are gun runners and slavers (Bully Hayes aka Tommy Lee Jones and Ben Pease aka Max Phipps), rogues and scoundrels (Again, Bully Hayes and Ben Peaseand a bunch of other dudes), missionaries and innocent newlyweds (Nathaniel Williamson aka Michael OKeefe and Sophie aka Jenny Seagrove)--plus savage aboriginals (is that a redundancy?) who are into Virgin Sacrifice (or at least Cute-White-Chick Sacrifice), not to mention a Prussian Count--whos running the aforementioned dreadnought--all thrown together in an intriguing story-line. One that even has a slight basis in reality, given that the title characters are historical personages.

The acting is excellent, the production values outstanding, and the story-line well done (forget what Roger Ebert says). And just seeing Jenny Seagrove as Sophie, with either a knife or pistol in her hand--in the white wedding gown she wears through much of the film--is reward enough in itself.",1481760000,,1799,5.178694158075602
