2158004,3,B0006210ZG,"This movie doesn't live up to the hype. It has some good things going for it, not the least of which is the acting. Meryl Streep has to be the greatest actress of her generation and can do anything. She is amazing here, particularly in her Oedipal scene with Liev Schreiber, who is also well cast. Denzel Washington does a fine job as Major Marco and is convincing as a deeply troubled veteran of the gulf war. But actors need a good script. This one jerks and starts. At times it's silly; at other times the action is repugnant. I do not need to see a man choked to death as he vomits in living color. Thank God for the Greeks for believing that sometimes less is more. Directed by Jonathan Demme, the film is set in the present. I'm not sure what kind of parallels we are to draw here. Is Streep supposed to remind us of Hillary Clinton? She has the drive, the ambition and the haircut but not the political philosophy. Someone drops the phrase ""conservative vigilence"". Are we to think the second George Bush here? And a multi-national corporation (Manchurian Global) putting one of its brainwashed own into the White House? Why buy the cow when the milk is free already? The White House welcome mat has always been out for the Enrons and Halliburtons of the world. Let me rephrase: one Halliburton lives in the vice-presidential quarters now.

 The writers, to their credit, do not attempt to copy the original and have changed the plot considerably. If only it worked better. Although the movie certainly has it moments, there's a lot of not very interesting, confusing times between the high points. It was a very long 2 hours and 15 minutes for me. I checked my watch often, something I never did in the original movie. Although this film is neither in the league with ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" nor the 1962 version, it is certainly worth seeing if only for the performance of the incomparable Ms. Streep.",1091232000,4,1904,4.580645161290323
2158005,5,B0006210ZG,"Though I'm a huge fan of John Frakenheimer's 1962 film of Richard Condon's novel, I wasn't one of those purist fogeys who kept posting those ""how dare they tamper with a classic"" rants on the internet.

 After all, if ""Hamlet"" can be re-invented why not a political thriller?

 If talented people can take a dated piece of material and create a hip new variation on it, who's to object?

 And damed if Director Jonathan Demme and his screenwriters, Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris haven't pulled it off!

 Demme and company have turned the classic Cold War thriller into a contemporary paranoid fantasy, much in the tradition of

 ""Parallax View"" ""Three Days of the Condor"" and ""The Conversation."" Gone, for obvious reasons, is the political satire that made the original novel and film so memborable, but this film is so entertianing in its own way, the satire is not missed.

 One may occasionally yearn for the iconic symbols of 1962....the soliatire game and the Queen of Diamonds are no more and the ""Red Menace"" has been replaced by a new villian--a mulintational Haliburton-Carlyslesque coporation called ""Manchurian Global"" that uses computer implants (and ""Cup O' Noddles!"") to alter behavior instead of card games and Freudian symbols (Michael Moore will be thrilled).

 Meryl Steep chews the scenery to great effect as the evil-domineering incestual mother, who, in this new film, is a powerful U.S. Senator (despite the one day controvery in the press, nothing about her performance seems to allude to Hillary Clinton--philisophically she's more like Paul Wolfowitz in skirts and Denzel Washington is flawless as the nightmare tortured Marco.

 Demme cleverly avoids trying to duplicate the amazing Garden Tea Party scene from the original and in many ways the braninwashing sequence in this new ""Candidate"" is weider; certainly more graphic and intense.

 Rachel Portman's eerie score heightens the mood of closed in paranoia and the super-paced editing belies the film's 130 minute length.

 Is Demme's new ""Candidate"" a classic in the tradition of the original?...probably not, but it sure is as timely as its gets and a hell of a lot of fun.",1091232000,2,2156,5.088319088319088
2158006,5,B0006210ZG,"This is a riveting and provocative remake by a top-rate director in Jonathan Demme. The original with Frank Sinatra may very well have been controversial and its plot far-fetched, but the acting was so compelling and sincere that it effaced these objections and commanded even the most skeptical viewer's full attention. With its stellar cast -- the brilliant Meryl Streep and the always reliable Denzel Washington -- this film delivers precisely the same merits. Streep's performance as a smarmy, power-obsessed US senator bent on advancing her son's political career is so convincing as to induce chills, while Denzel never once flinches as a disturbingly paranoid victim of US intelligence abuses. Especially welcome is Demme's courageous decision not to make a stale carbon copy of the film's classic predecessor, but to reinvent it in a more contemporary setting: the post gulf-war/9-11 world. Fueled largely by the hysterical climate of fear and terror we now live in, his portrayal of contemporary American life is thoroughly convincing and lends credence to its premise: a government conspiracy to plant a privately-owned president in the white house. Besides, in our age of campaign finance disarray and the public interconnectedness between military operations and corporate profit (hence Eisenhower's prophetic farewell speech), the accusation seems less far-fetched than naive, for it certainly does not take some fantastic intelligence scheme to buy-out a politician. American history is rife with examples and the pattern continues to this day. Just take a look at some of the current allegations against Tom Delay.

But whether or not this conspiracy theory resonates, the human problems the film presents are as believable as they are engaging. There is nothing to believe or not believe about one man's tortured efforts to trust his instincts amid so much harrowing opposition, to maintain a sense of reality and truth amid a Pynchon-esque culture that favors images over substance, virtual existence over tangible reality, platitudes over discourse, advertizing over honesty. These are not conspiracies: all you have to do is look around on your morning commute through ten thousand billboards flanking the highway, keep up with a political campaign for a while, or simply try to get through a single hour without being hit up for money by a commercial, a print ad, a junk-email or a telemarketer. These are the situations Demme explores in his admirable attempt to endear a very jaded audience to the adventurous claims of a sci-fi political satire. Or is it satire? Gulf War Synrome is a widely documented phenomenon observed in tens of thousands of Desert Storm troops. The battlefield of Kuwait is known to be the most toxic in the history of modern warfare, with US planes detonating various chemical weapons sites in 1991 Iraq (and, according to well-censored reports, American missiles equipped with chemical agents), unleashing vast amounts of toxic poisons into the sky that were then blown about by the weather, infecting soldiers. Symptoms these people complain about are identical to those of victims of agent orange or chemical attacks in World War II, and the government itself has set up several hospitals exclusively for soldiers who exhibit symptoms of Gulf War Syndrome. Lastly, the theory of government efforts to hypnotize and program people is actually a well-founded possibility. Evidence of cold-war era hypnosis programs sponsored by US and Soviet intelligence agencies is real and, in that age of massive espionage and paranoia, hardly seems surprising. People are free to believe or disregard widely spread and often credible reports that Sirhan Sirhan, the alleged RFK assassin, was the product of just such a program. Neither he nor the security guard who is suspected to be the real killer, Thane Eugene Cesar, have been able to remember anything about that disgusting afternoon in California. While my mind's comfort depends on a denial of these possibilities, my gut gags over its inability to dismiss them. This nausea was just one among an array of emotional responses I experienced while watching The Manchurian Candidate. I think films capable of inducing such strong response are becoming rarer by the year, and that this one qualifies as just such a film ought to be reason enough to give it a chance.",1091232000,4,4356,5.240687679083095
2158007,2,B0006210ZG,"I haven't seen the original, but by today's standards this whole sci-fi mind control conspiracy theme just plays out like a bad episode of The X-Files. If you want political commentary and satire regarding white house corruption and corporate influence on policy, then stick to Fahrenheit 9/11. The message is largely the same, but F-9/11 is authentic, clever, and entertaining. The Manchurian Candidate on the other hand, is a heavy handed yet thin allegory that doesn't end up making a whole lot of sense. Furthermore, the film takes itself WAY too seriously as it plods through all the mandatory steps of mystery and conspiracy with absolutely no humor or charm. The whole thing just feels dull, forced, and obvious. You know before going into the theater that this film is about the all powerful corporate boogeyman brainwashing a soldier and turning him into their White House sleeper agent. And well, that's basically all there is to it. Knowing the source material and having seen the previews really leaves you very little reason to actually sit through the film itself. It has no imagination or charm to add to what you already know about it. That's not to say that it follows the original very closely. I don't know how much it parallels the original since I haven't seen the original. But even then, this film failed to surprise or impress me at all.

  Basically the plot boils down to Denzel looking deadly serious as he tries to piece together the mystery of what really happened to his patrol during the Gulf War (Did Shaw's heroic actions really save them in a bad Iraqi ambush, or were they actually kidnapped and brainwashed? Why are they having strange dreams, and why can't they actually remember Shaw saving them?). The problem is that we pretty much know the answer from the beginning. In the end, there aren't anymore surprising revelations. There are only contrived details (OH, so they're using some kind of high tech mind control implant!) and some plot holes that never really get explained or addressed. Denzel isn't given much to work with here. Liev Schrieber and Meryl Streep both deliver solid performances. But in the end, the story simply isn't engaging or intelligent enough to sustain any interest.",1091232000,2,2234,4.904761904761905
2158008,3,B0006210ZG,"IMPACT? A Curious Tale seen through the looking glass of Global Corporations and the impact ...... the Global impact ...

 SO? This one hits close to home - beloved son returns as War hero, later his ambitious mother [read Lady MacBeth] shoves sonnyboy headlong into the political meatmarket.

 PROBLEM? Combat buddies [falling fast] seem to be having the same recurring nightmares about sonnyboy and the 'rescue'.

 THIS version does not quite follow the same path the original 'flew' but hits home in rather a nice way. Along the way - especially towards the 'conclusion?' We really hit a double wammy - very, very NICE.

 MAKE SENSE? 'Control, control and more mob control' - most chilling is the TV 'fodder' CGI corrections at the end ...... not that startling....think Lee H.O. As for those color-coded 'Threat Warnings'!

 TECH CREDITS? Costumes, Art direction - music - all quite good - Oscar calibre work.

 STREEP as Lady Mac, or ...err ... 'You know who's lookalike' is fairly chilling, but one can sympathize with Ellie ... after all 'just WHERE are all the real men' [leaders?] in today's world? She also spews rather an interesting bot mot about one's neighborhood serial killer[s]. Prime scenes for STREEP - especially the 'Marketing' of the Candidate - and the Electoral Vote structure ...... Florida???

 [Unless you have your head buried somewhere and still believe in Kansas].

 WASHINGTON? Nice, modulated performance.

 SCHREIBER? Very moving, very effective as 'Our Son' - nom worthy here.

 VOIGHT? Slightly wasted, but excellent in the confrontation[s] with Streep.

 Most chilling is the 'South African' rogue doctor somewhat physically a Hitler lookalike. Lots of cameos [Dean Stockwell, Ted Levine - other Demme alumni]

 BUT still can't quite forget the LANSBURY version ......

 FOR SHEER PERVERSION?

 TOM HANKS in the ""Ellie' role ~ CHARLIZE THERON ? Raymond natch!

2158009,5,B0006210ZG,"Shades of Fahrenheit 911! This superbly crafted and well acted re-make of the 1960s political thriller, ""The Manchurian Candidate"" bears little resemblance to the original, a taut but relatively conventional psychological drama based on the premise of the selective brainwashing of a platoon of American soldiers during the Korean War by the North Koreans. In the original, the storyline revolves around the nightmare ruminations of a military officer (played by Frank Sinatra) who comes to realize all hinges on a fellow prisoner, the scion of a wealthy, influential, and politically ambitious family becoming a sleeper assassin who will be activated to act out his part in a diabolical plot to stage a deft and ostensibly peaceful coup-d'etat of the American government.

Here Denzel Washington underplays the part of the officer to the point of perfection, yet the story-line is much more of a postmodern twist, involving corporate geopolitical ambitions for a Halliburton-like firm who tries to use the brainwashing during the Gulf War of 1991 to ensnare and brainwash the sleeper agent (played well here by Liev Schreiber, once again the scion of a wealthy, influential, and politically star-crossed family). Meryl Streep plays against type as a brash and arrogant neoconservative senator who uses her bully pulpit to spew imperialistic venom. There are many contemporary touches and twists to the script and the plot that make this a quite artful, albeit obviously fictional, philosophical diatribe on the state of current American politics seen through the eyes of Hollywood intellectuals (or is that a contradiction in terms?).

All that said, there is indeed much beyond these blatant attempts to examine the current state of the American polity to recommend the film for your entertainment. It is a forceful and mind-expanding whirlwind ride through the threats we face both within and without our borders, and it offers a number of interesting and diverting scenes of people swept up by and then caught helplessly within the crosshairs of circumstances way out of his or her control, and in that sense is a timeless statement of how much the particulars describing each of our lives depend in the unique set of historical circumstances we find ourselves enmeshed within. This is quite a rollercoaster ride, and one I highly recommend for your viewing entertainment. Enjoy!",1090972800,44,2383,5.268421052631579
2158010,5,B0006210ZG,"I was able to attend a pre-screening for Manchurian and I must admit, Demme has outdone Frankenheimer's '62 classic. Denzel delivers a superd performance as Ben Marco, while Meryl Streep provides an outstanding supporting effort as the sadistic mother, Eleanor Shaw. The plot differs from the original in many respects, some more obvious than others. For instance, in the latest version, Marco and Shaw (Schreiber) fight in the Gulf War opposed to the Korean War. The plot twists and turns throughout the film, leaving the viewer on the edge of his/her seat until the very end, which if I may say so, was surprisingly good. Despite the great anticipation to see The Village this weekend, you should consider checking out Manchurian instead. I can at least guarantee you'll love one of them.",1090800000,8,790,4.992424242424242

2158024,2,B0006210ZG,"The original film is one of my favorites of all time.  I am normally quite skeptical of remakes--especially of classics.  However, this version has a great cast, so I did give it a viewing.  While the performers are strong, the attempt to change the motivations for the entire operation veer too far into the absurd  The original version made a level of sense and critiqued certain issues in American society in a way that made the viewer appreciate the work that had gone into the production.  This version, on the other hand, presents what ultimately comes off as a ridiculous explanation for what is happening.  In order to buy it, one has to suspend all understanding of business or embrace the idea that large corporations are routinely taking wild and unwarranted risks when the reality is that they tend to be among the most cautious entities in the business world.  Risking everything on a million-to-one (at best) shot is something that just doesn't hold up to scrutiny.

Denzel was excellent in the movie by the way, and so were the other actors and actresses, especially  Meryl Streep, who played one of the characters mother.

 the book. Perfectly cast it was Frank Sinatra's best dramatic role. Why he was not nominated for
an academy award is a mystery. Ditto Janet Leigh who I never considered to be a great actress delivers in this film. But the standout was Angela Lansbury who played Lawrence Harvey's cold
 blooded ruthless mother. She was chilling! Denzel Washington and Merryl Streep are two of our
 greatest actors . I have never seen a Streep in anything where she was not great, even in a bad movie. But the acting is not the problem in this remake. They try to update a story and it just does
 not work. Sinatra's and Harvey's roles are combined and Shriver's roll is changed to what was Lansbury's husband, not her son. Watch the original, read the book but skip this movie.",1417996800,2,1064,4.27363184079602

THE MANCHURIAN SLAUGHTER

On August 8, 1945, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan. Having extracted their terrible revenge on Germany, they were now fired by a desire to punish Japan, the second instigator of World War II. Aided by the Mongolian Peoples Republic Army, they attacked the Japanese Kwantung Army in northern Manchuria. The fighting was ferocious and vengeful, the Nippon soldiers attacking in hordes, arms linked, into a withering fire of machine gun bullets. Many, armed with explosives, threw themselves under the tanks of the advancing Red Army at the same time shouting their Emperors name. The few soldiers who were captured showed no hesitation in committing hara-kiri by exploding hidden grenades and at the same time killing many of their captors. The Soviet and Mongolian soldiers unfortunate enough to be captured by the Japanese, faced a swift and terrible death. Their bodies were mutilated, eyes gouged out and genitals removed before decapitation. The Red Army suffered 8,219 killed and over 22,000 wounded. The Kwantung Army lost 7,483 killed and around 70,000 wounded. When the northern Kwantung Army laid down its arms and surrendered, Stalin took his revenge. The 640,000 prisoners, including 148 generals, were transported to Siberia and there put to work on forced labour projects. Some 62,000 of these prisoners died while in Soviet captivity. During the war (1937-1945) Japanese military losses were 1,140,429 killed in action in all theatres.

PINGFAN (1945)

When Russia invaded Manchuria in 1945, the Japanese Government ordered that Pingfan (the Japanese experimental Biological and Germ Warfare Centre in occupied Manchuria) be destroyed. This complex was established by General Shiro Ichii and an Imperial prince and cousin of Emperor Hirohito. The documentation authorizing the building of this establishment, which occupied an area of six square kilometres, carried the Imperial Seal of the Emperor. Prisoners in the holding cells were first killed and all Chinese and Manchurian slave labourers who were forced to work in the complex were then machined-gunned to death. About 600 were killed this way, the bodies of the victims cremated in three large ovens the same way as those used in the Nazi death camps, and their ashes then dumped into the nearby Sungari River. The whole Pingfan complex was then blown up before the Russians arrived. Pingfan had 4,500 flea breeding machines which produced 100 million infected fleas every few days. These fleas, infected with plague, typhoid, cholera and anthrax organisms, were to be dropped on the invasion troops in a last ditch effort to win the war. Most of these plague-infected fleas was purposely released before the complex was destroyed. North-eastern China immediately became a disaster area and at least 30,000 people died over the next three years from plague and other diseases.

MUKDEN

About 350 miles from Pingfan (the Germ Warfare Complex in Manchuria) was the prisoner of war camp at Mukden where 1,485 American, British and Australian P.O.W.s were sent in November, 1942. The American prisoners arrived in terrible shape via the hell-ship Totori Maru and suffering from all sorts of diseases contacted during their imprisonment at Camp O'Donnell  and Cabanatuan. In August, 1942, around 1,500 men from Cabanatuan boarded the Totori Maru and sailed for Pusan in Korea. From Pusan they boarded a train destined for Mukden, Manchuria. There were two camps at Mukden, one at Hoten and the other at Hsien, the later holding the higher ranking Allied prisoners who were to be used as hostages in the event of an Allied invasion of Japan. The prisoners at Hoten were put to work producing parts for Japanese aircraft and tanks at the MKK factory. The deaths incurred here were due to neglect, disease, hunger, Japanese brutality and accidental bombing by US aircraft on December 7, 1944 when 19 P.O.W.s were killed and 54 wounded. By November, 1943, a total of 84 British, 16 Australians and a large number of US servicemen had perished.

 It is estimated that around 60,000 prisoners, including Chinese and Manchurian slave labourers, lost their lives at Pingfan and Mukden. Chemical and biological experimental Units 731 and 100 of the Germ Warfare Complex were situated at Pingfan. It was here that Chinese and Manchurian nationals were experimented upon. It is not known exactly how many Allied P.O.W.s were subjected to these experiments but their numbers were relatively small. The terrible experiences suffered by prisoners at Pingfan and Mukden, has been, for over forty years, one of the best kept secrets of the Second World War. With the exception of one or two, none of the Japanese scientists and doctors at Mukden or Pingfan were ever brought to trial, owing to a deal done with the USA, through General Douglas MacArthur, in which it offered immunity from war crimes in exchange for scientific data acquired at Mukden and Pingfan to give the US some germ warfare advantage over the communist Soviet Union. Unit 731s records were moved to US military research centre at Fort Dietrich in Maryland and today are still classified Top Secret. After repeated requests by war crime investigators for authority to arrest General Ishii and the Imperial Prince Takamatus (Emperor Hirohito's cousin) the requests were denied by MacArthur. After the war these men, about thirty five of them, held top positions in Japanese medical and scientific institutions. General Ishii died of throat cancer in 1959.

The combined figure of British and American prisoners of war who died while in Japanese captivity, totalled 24,969. Over 22,000 Australians were prisoners of the Japanese. Of these, 8,296 died while in captivity. Of the Australians who ended up in German P.O.W. camps, 265 died in captivity. Allied POWs in Germany died at rate of 1.2%. Throughout  the Pacific area they died at the rate of 37%.",1409616000,,6857,5.111706881143879

I've always enjoyed Denzel Washington's acting, but Frank Sinatra's role was unforgettable, Lawrence Harvey's acting was excellent & Angela Lansbury was icy cold & just plain scary. As Meryl Streep is maybe the best actress around now, nevertheless she looked merely neurotic next to Lansbury's Oscar nominated performance. Plus, the former MC was filmed in B&W, which added to the film's tense atmosphere. The '62 movie is the one to have, very definitely.",1407715200,,784,4.9393939393939394

2158134,4,B0006210ZG,"The remake of The Manchurian Candidate is one of the few Denzel Washington films I've never seen. To be honest, the story just didn't interest me that much, but it started streaming this month, so I gave it a shot. As expected, it's a someone complex story, that at times was difficult to understand, however an all-star cast manages to pull it together at the end. The story begins in Iraq during the Gulf War, when a U.S. Army platoon goes missing for three days. Even they were unaware of what happened to them, until one of the men starts having nightmares, and bodies start turning up. Denzel Washington plays the commanding officer, who takes it upon himself to investigate the strange deaths of his men, almost a decade later. As always, Washington is at the top of his game, giving off that infectious intensity, that keeps you on the edge of your seat through every step of the investigation. Washington is paired with Liev Schreiber who is one guy that has always just rubbed me the wrong way. It's not that he's a bad actor, there is just something about him and the characters he plays that is inherently unlikeable. He wasn't bad in this film, but being a similarly intense actor, meant that the chemistry with Washington was almost non-existent. The story is complicated and in the beginning of the film, it's going to be somewhat hard to watch. As the film proceeds and the elements become more clear, the film gets easier to watch, and the ending really pulls everything together. The Manchurian Candidate is one of those films that you think is going to be a bust, some people may even turn it off, but those who stick with it will see that it just gets better and better until a surprise ending brings it all together. If I were the writer of this film, I would have made the beginning of the film more intense and less confusing. The truth is the most important parts of a film are the beginning and the end, and without a strong opening, a lot of people will be turned off to the film and have the wrong attitude throughout. If you manage to stick with it, The Manchurian Candidate is great, but it does take a while to get there.",1405900800,,2150,4.487244897959184

2158140,1,B0006210ZG,"What an embarrassment of a film, especially as it purports to align itself with the original themed movie of the 1960s with Frank Sinatra. Directed by Jonathan Demme who has shown that his original reputation has morphed into a didactic caricature of liberal hype. Why do these Hollywood celebrity directors insist on shooting themselves in the foot?

The standard bearer in the original movie was the idea of brainwashing by Korean communists to plant a mole in the American political hierarchy. This idea was supplanted in the more recent film as a corporation called Manchurian Global who wants the ultimate in influence via a nefarious plot using brain implants to capture the American Presidency. Thus the original anti-communist plot is changed to a plot by the business world to take over the political apparatus of the whole world. A right wing view is supplanted in this way by a left wing view.

The question brought up in the 1950s and 1960s is why would any American align themselves with the communists? The answer was brainwashing. The question now is why would anyone trust corporations and align themselves with them? The Hollywood answer is.....implants? OK, Demme probably doesn't really see it like that, but still, the corporations are too nefarious to be trusted in any real capacity, in their view. This is a modern left-wing idea. And a stupid one at that.

Question: I thought the corporations already had control, so why do they want the headache of the Presidency itself if they already have the influence they need? Answer: Crickets, because the left just doesn't have an answer here. Thus the plot is just didactic and not even intellectually so.

That is leftist Hollywood for you. Their motto should be: will create sophist arguments for profit and the privilege of being a celebrity.  In a Freudian sense, maybe what they really want is to be Manchurian Global.",1403740800,4,1892,4.955835962145111

My wife normally falls asleep when we watch movies late at night, but she actually watched the entire thing, so that should tell you something.

If you have never seen the original movie from the 60's and are not familiar with the plot line, then you will really like this movie. There are lots of twists and turns, and it has a sort of chilling, spooky feel to it because it seems like one of those stories that could possibly actually happen in real life.

2158226,4,B0006210ZG,"To begin with, I'm honestly not familiar with the 60s version, and it may be better in every way.  I don't really know.  I can say that some of the complaints about this version which compare it to the 60s version--for example, that the movie merely indulges in patriotic gesturing, and that it contains less than 50 minutes of story--seem pretty exaggerated.  If I have any real complaints, the most outstanding is that some of the details of plot elements don't quite make sense (to avoid spoilers, I'll just say, what the heck were the shoulder devices for, considering everything else that was done?).  The second is that the very few real villain-type characters (and one of them far more than the rest) seem a little too over-the-top to swallow completely, bordering on comic book villainy.

As a psychological film, though, the handling of blurred-together hallucination and memory was done magnificently well, and the portrayal of people who can feel their minds betraying them was admirably credible and also respectful. Although there is some lack of closure regarding the ultimate fate of Atticus Noyle, in a way this is fitting, since he seems almost like a phantom during the course of the film. The main reason I gave four stars rather than five is that while Manchurian Candidate is often skillfully atmospheric, in pursuit of atmosphere, it sometimes becomes either heavy-handed when trying too hard to create an impression or impossibly vague when trying to avoid being explicit. However, it usually manages to keep well-balanced, and seems to aim high, both of which are done all too rarely.

As an aside, for some reason, Liev Schreiber and Denzel Washington, the actors whose characters are obviously at the center of the story and who get the most screen-time, are listed as supporting actors, and those playing two of the soldiers who show up only briefly are listed as the ""stars.""

Washington and Liev Schrieber give Oscar calibre performances with Streep outstanding as a ruthless incestuos mother bent on world domination.

In the original it was Cold War paranoia with Communism as the impending evil on American society. In the remake it is Manchurain Global, corporate America, as the impending evil trying to get a brainwashed, hypnotized sleeper into the Oval office. The film has sophisticated cinematography in creating a sense of paranoia. The score creates a mood of fear. It's an extremely well crafted film with a nice small role by Bruno Ganz. Not a masterpiece as John Frankenheimre's original. I wished at the end of the day this was darker and more menacing then what we got.

2158245,3,B0006210ZG,"Granted, the original is a hard act to follow.

Demme's remake has its moments and a few updates relevant for the times, but it also suffers from some lazy moments that undermine the film.

This is one of those movies that suffers on repeat viewings because some of the tiny details that are easily overlooked at first become more noticeable in later viewings.

Here are what some might consider petty examples, but to me they represent a dismissive attitude about detail, and sometimes details really do matter:  there are several moments in the film where we see the candidates giving speeches on TV in front of large political convention crowds.  Rather than speaking loudly into the microphones to be heard over the cacophony of noises in the room, the candidates (and more Liev Schreiber's character than anyone else) speak in soft, conversational tones.  It looks like what is really was  --  not performed live but rather put together in post-production.

In another scene at the end, a scene where the winning candidates are celebrating their election victory, the news graphic shows a two-bar graph of the voting count.  The winners received 70% of the vote, yet the bar graph shows that the one marked 70% is the shorter of the two.  That is impossible.  Any graph bar of more than 50% will be taller/higher than each and every other graph because it is the largest proportion.  If the shorter graph bar is supposed to represent 70% of the vote, what was the taller one supposed to represent? Maybe 110%?  The graph is a measure of 180% of the vote?  No wonder the voting system is so confusing.

Did I catch these details the first time I watched the film?  The speeches, yes, the not the graphs.  There are several ""false moments"" like this in the film (and in a lot of films, to be fair).  But those are the moments that can ""take you out of"" the film, and when they draw attention to themselves you lose your interest in the story and focus more on the details that the filmmakers either were too busy to catch or hoped you wouldn't notice.

If you are eating a meal that has a lot of stuff in it you like but one single, solitary, tiny-proportioned ingredient that you don't care for (and is cooked into the food and unable to be picked out), pretty soon that single ingredient is the only thing you taste or think about when you eat the meal.  It effectively ruins the meal for you.

I liked this remake the first time I saw it but now I can't sit through it without the ""little things"" jumping out at me.

Aside from that, however, it is a decent enough movie.  A well-cast film.",1299024000,,2596,4.533333333333333

With that in mind, this is a fairly decent thriller movie, that although slow paced, still manages to keep you interested for the duration. The story has been updated for this remake to take into account modern conflicts and scientific developments, but the key idea remains the same. A US soldier is brainwashed to commit a political assassination when he returns home. The film is based around this basic idea and also how to uncover the plot and motivation behind it. Washington turns out a decent performance and Streep, whilst being a parody of the evil domineering mother, still manages to be fairly convincing. Liev Shrieber is the last part of the acting puzzle who manages to lift this film from mediocrity to something half decent. This has flaws aplenty and as I mentioned before it is slow paced and dragged in places, but it still a reasonable film and worth a watch at some point. It has made me want to see the original to see if it as good (and as superior to this version) as I have heard.

2158247,4,B0006210ZG,"""The Manchurian Candidate"" is a remake of the 1962 political thriller.  This time, Captain Bennett Marco is played by Denzel Washington.  The movie kept reminding me of the new dream thriller ""Inception"" where planting ideas in the brain by invading one's dreams or subconscious.  The Manchurian Candidate had the same thesis of planting thoughts and erasing how they got there.

This newer version of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" focuses on soldiers from the Iraq War as the test subjects.  Capt. Bennett and Sgt Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) are taken captive during the first Iraq invasion, The Gulf War, and brainwashed to rebel once they return home.  Ten years later, Shaw's mother (Meryl Streep) is determined that her son become president, and pressures the Convention to get him on the ticket as vice president nominee.  She gets her way and we soon realize this is just the first step.  Shaw's mother has taken over Shaw's life.

As Marco begins to unravel the brainwashing, he does Internet searches and soon remembers the geneticist that plants ideas.  Not only has he found a microchip in his back and Shaw's, ideas are planted deep inside the brain.  Soon it becomes a race to beat the brainwashing plot.

2158251,3,B0006210ZG,"The Manchurian Candidate, 2004 film

The film begins with soldiers gambling. The flames suggest the Iraq war of 1991. There is an ambush. Sergeant Raymond Shaw won the Congressional Medal of Honor for his actions in the battle. Years later Major Marco tells the Boy Scouts about this event. Corporal Melvin tells of his bad dreams. A news program tells of problems for the American people. Congressman Raymond Shaw makes a speech to cheers. We can prevail. [Who is we?] Politicians pick the party ticket. Elly Shaw pleads for her son Congressman Shaw as the VP. It works. Does Major Marco recover a forgotten memory? Dont touch me. Marco gets his orders and meds. Shaw practices his rhetoric on the public. Later he has a strange experience. What about his brain? Do you remember me?

Marco meets Eugene Rose on the train to New York city. Who would implant a chip in his back? [Does the film start to drag here?] Does the conversation between Shaw and Marco seem real? Is the confrontation too dramatic? He hit me! Did the Army experiment on its soldiers? Will that physician work on Marco? Can a brain be rebooted from a crash? Can he recover his memory? [Is the story becoming weird?] Marco reads about Manchurian Global. Senator Thomas Jordan explains it to Marco. Later he discusses this with Raymond and Eleanor Shaw! Does Jordan have a suggestion to regain the VP slot? Will this problem be neutralized? Jocelyn runs out of the house without a cell phone or firearm! Does it look like an accident?

Is the Shadow Unit watching Marco? Could a powerful corporation use scientists to create global changes? Will friendship trump sworn duty? Does Elly have more balls in her game? There is another meeting between Shaw and Marco. Was this foreseen? Is there a diabolical plot? Will the country be saved? Will there be a dramatic and shocking ending? [You know its coming.] Will the plan go wrong? And so another lone gunman changes history again. Will history be rewritten again?

This is a more complex recreation of the original isn't as good. But it is good enough if you never saw the 1962 film or read the novel by Richard Condon. Was the personality of Elly based on a well-known politician? There was no need for Manchurian in the title given the extensive changes in the story. The Corporate Candidate would be more apt. Corporations have been controlling politicians since the Civil War era. Before that the privilege of limited liability was reserved only for those who served the public need (water supplies, canals, railroads).
[I wonder if the original story of a lost patrol that led to political success was a subtle parody of PT-109? What would happen to America if someone became President because his father was a powerful politician or Executive?]

Yunte Huangs book Charlie Chan noted that Richard Condon was a publicist for the movie industry since 1936. His 1959 novel The Manchurian Candidate echoed Sax Rohmers 1936 novel President Fu Manchu.",1248739200,,2969,4.825147347740668
2158252,3,B0006210ZG,"1962's ""The Manchurian Candidate"" was an outstanding classic of an earlier era of movies, crisply shot in black and white and featuring a talented cast and a tightly wound, haunting plot firmly embedded in the tensions and paranoia of the Cold War.  2004's remake also features a talented cast in Denzel Washington, Liev Schrieber, Meryl Streep and Jon Voigt, but misses badly as a movie.  Produced for an audience that might only dimly remember the Cold War, the substitute premise of a rogue corporation selling arms fails the plausibility test, while a major change in the plot undercuts the credibility of one of the principal characters.

Major Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) is a veteran of the Gulf War, suffering from nightmares that seem to present an alternate version of a fire fight in which his life was saved by a Sergeant Raymond Shaw.  Shaw, played with disquietingly detached deameanor by Liev Schrieber, is now on a greased path to political stardom, coached by his ambitious and prominent mother, played by Meryl Streep.  Marco's attempts to resolve his nightmares lead him to contact Shaw and to suspect that his experience in the Gulf was an illusion.  Marco's quest for the truth will lead him into a nasty conspiracy involving brainwashing, with a shocking outcome for Marco and Shaw.

""The Manchurian Candidate"" has a good build-up, as Marco relentlessly seeks the truth of his experience in combat.  However, the movie loses its way in its closing stages.  An effort to be original by introducing changes in the basic story makes for an incoherent and implausible ending.  2004's ""The Manchurian Candidate"" may well be a perfectly acceptable movie for someone who had never seen the original.  For those who saw and appreciated the original, this remake is a missed opportunity, worth a look mostly for the outstanding cast.",1239667200,,1848,5.026229508196721

2158266,4,B0006210ZG,"Jonathan Demme's version of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" was a favorite film of mine that recently came to my DVD collection as the result of a great price.  Demme won the Oscar for directing ""Silence of the Lambs"" in 1991.  I enjoyed watching the DVD extra interviews with him, only wondering why he didn't use a razor.  :)

There is no doubt that with two Oscars for ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" in 1979, ""Sophie's Choice"" in 1982 & numerous other nominations, Meryl Streep is one of the most acclaimed actresses of our time.  However, it was this film for which she was nominated by the British Academy Awards & the Golden Globes that really made me a Streep fan.  To watch her glide through Eleanor Shaw with elegance, polish and the cold-blooded instincts for political survival was incredible.  The scene where she's wearing purple sunglasses and swirls around lecturing the other Manchurian Global bigshots was breathtaking.

Liev Schreiber who I recently enjoyed in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Painted-Veil/dp/B000NOIX48/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Painted Veil</a>&nbsp;does an excellent job as Congressman Raymond Shaw.  Schreiber has been nominated for a Golden Globe as Best Actor in a TV movie or miniseries for ""RKO 281.""  As Shaw, he does a masterful job of playing the polished politician with perhaps too strong ties to his mother's apron strings.

That said, Denzel Washington turns in another blockbuster performance as Maj. Bennett Marco.  Washington has two Oscars for ""Glory"" in 1989 & ""Training Day"" in 2001.  The levels he achieves -- from the stable military commander to the unstable programmed assassin to a confused man trying to figure out a puzzle -- result in a varied & excellent performance.  Demme particularly complimented Washington on the scene where Marco tells Shaw that there is a strong bond between the two of them.

Jon Voight who won his Best Actor Oscar for ""Coming Home"" in 1978 as a stressed out veteran does a good job here as Sen. Thomas Jordan who gets squeezed out of a vice presidential nomination.  Vera Farmiga who I'm enjoying in the DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Never-Forever/dp/B001840TU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Never Forever</a>&nbsp;and who played in ""The Departed"" performs well in the cameo appearance as Jocelyn Jordan, the daughter of Sen. Shaw and the past romantic interest of Raymond Shaw.  Her demise is as strangely beautiful as it is violent.  Kimberly Elise who was in ""The Great Debators"" plays Rosie with depth, the F.B.I. agent who becomes sympathetic to Washington's Bennett Marco.  Jeffrey Wright who has recently played in ""Casino Royale"" as well as the new James Bond film ""Quantum of Solace"" does a masterful job as the unstable Al Melvin who is haunted by his dreams, writes them down in a journal and scribbles disturbing drawings on the wall of his flat.

Demme keeps the pace moving, the intrigue breathtaking up to the final shots in the film.  This was a great picture whose performances make it worth viewing.  I also found the issues of just how much control the people actually have in a democracy when those elected constantly try to control the outcome to be relevant to present day.  Enjoy!",1225238400,2,3277,5.332684824902723
2158267,5,B0006210ZG,"The political importance of The Manchurian Candidate, a movie based on the novel written by Richard Condon, is excellent because it teaches us how power corrupts and absolute power has the ability to corrupt people, process and society absolutely. Lina Navarini and I set out to see the version played by Frank Sinatra in 1962, followed by this remake by Denzel Washington.

The first movie takes place during the aftermath of the Korean War, but now the plot takes place after the Gulf War. Now played by Denzel Washington, Bennet Marco is an infantryman who experiences recurring nightmares because he was kidnapped and through an implant on his back and another in his teeth, the enemy is able to plant false memories in his mind and in particular, in the mind of Raymond Shaw. Mr. Shaw, candidate to Vice President of the US, upon receiving a phone call that triggers his mind to do whatever he is told, is capable of murder, without ""guilt or fear"" therefore, little risk of being discovered.

The purpose behind altering the neuron connections and re-wiring the brain of these Americans is a desire to place a man in the White House that would do anything the enemy desires. Imagine the power the enemy would have if they were to control the United States of America.

But Bennett Marco is haunted by dreams with images that make him question reality. The platoon told the world that Sergeant Raymond Shaw, played by Liev Schreiber had rescued the platoon soldiers, to the exception of two who perish. He has told the world that Raymond Shaw saved them, when in his dream, he remembers Shaw murdering one of the soldiers.

Shaw is decorated as a war hero, given the medal of honor, a distinction that is rarely awarded, but his dreams make him question whether they have been brained washed to believe Shaw had saved them. At first, Sinatra feels that he may be going mad and goes to see military medical personnel in search for help and support. They too believe he is experiencing post traumatic disorders, and they remove him from any duty, asking him to go on vacation and to rest.

But another member of the platoon is also having the same type dreams and soon they realize that there is more to this story than meets the eye. Denzel Washington becomes Mr. Shaw's nightmare as he gets close to him and unravels a rather sad personal story, where we learn that Shaw's mother has manipulated her son's life in search for fame and glory for she has plans for him, to transform him into the President of the United States. The mother's role is masterfully played by Meryl Streep, now a Senior Senator who took over the vacant seat left by her husband. She is ruthless, displaying a Machiavellian attitude that the end justifies all means to get her son elected and we soon find ourselves hating this manipulative, controlling, and mad woman. As with the first version, this movie is simply a magnificent political thriller, don't miss it!",1222905600,3,2945,4.710679611650486
2158268,2,B0006210ZG,"I was disappointed. Meryl Streep was the star of this one, she really didn't need the supporting actors.  They could have done a lot with this movie which had my attention in the beginning, but once I figured out what was going on (35 minutes into it) it became boring and predictable.  I agree with another reviewer, Denzel did what he could with what was given to him, his pitiful character was sad to watch.  They could have done more with Kimberly Elyse as well.

The movie wasn't horrible, it's just one that I won't watch again or recommmend.",1214611200,3,548,4.505050505050505
2158269,4,B0006210ZG,"Manchurian Candidate is closer to the original, at least in spirit, than might be expected.  But it's not the exact movie, and it hardly could have been. The relevance of the original to today's events counts little to an audience with little sense of history, and that has a hard time drawing meaning from any social context out of its experience. One glimpse of black and white films stock, men in felt brim hats, and cinematic conventions from an earlier era, and most teenyboppers under the age of thirty grab for the remote. Since they will only sit through a first run, it is good that they have one. Fortunately, the update stands on its own.

The new is less dialog-driven, which tends to make it less literate. But this film runs more on mood than on dialog, and Jonathon Demme's just-barely-odd framing and pacing provoke discomfort on a subliminal level. It is not cozy, and is laid out with less detailed explanation. The resulting sense of uncertainty may also be part of why the film is not universally liked.

The remake does solve some of the problems of the first. Gone are the swarthy, vaguely foreign-looking actors standing in for Russians and Chinese agents. Gone are the poorly choreographed ju-jitsu moves that might provoke giggles in a present day audience, used to world-class martial artists on screen, and the multi-racial world commonly reflected on film now, vs the early 1960's.

The new film retains the acting strengths of the original. Every performance is fine. Liev Schrieber's work is worthy of Laurence Harvey's original, a gut kicking performance, though Harvey still holds the edge. Washington's craft is more than a match for Sinatra's unevenly inspired work. (One of the wonders of the first is realizing that Sinatra -could- act, that he did things with rhythm and cadence because those were his only tools, and it worked. He was no method actor, but he very much had something going on.) Streep's scenery chewing is, frankly, perfect. Because unfortunately, really disgusting people actually do exist, and in positions of power. And unlike an actor's performance, criticism of real public figures whose behavior is over-the-top are rarely heard.  Seen any Fox commentators recently? Streep's Senator Shaw may well be over-the-top, but the only thing that distinguishes her from the real thing is that she is only playing the role, not embodying it every day of her life.

Make no mistake, both original and remake are thrillers in the paranoid vein, and the overly literal person will likely say of either, ""preposterous"" -- though the original is a classic. But the literal representation of reality is not what movies are ever about, and such criticisms fail to register with me.

So is this as excellent a film as the original, adjusting for the times in which each was made? No, but it is a good film. It hits in the right places, horrifies us with an incredibly cynical vision of what our nation is becoming, and yet it is offset by the thinnest sliver of a wild, earnest Patriotism.",1213574400,3,3032,4.8757281553398055

The cast is excellent and the film making is top notch. It is visually and aurally appealing. The only thing I did not like was the music at the beginning of the film, which seemed out of place in a movie of this caliber. Fortunately it's brief and soon forgotten.

2158286,4,B0006210ZG,"While being accompanied by a member of the press during the Persian Gulf War, an army unit is ambushed.  The men of the unit don't remember much of what happened after the attack but they all remember that they were saved because of the actions of Sgt. Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber).  After the conflict, Shaw was nominated for the Congressional Medal of Honor by his commanding officer, Capt. Ben Marco (Denzel Washington).  Shaw won the award and the recognition he received allowed him to successfully run for political office.

Years later Major Marco runs into another member of his unit, Al Melvin (Jeffrey Wright) from those days who questions Marco about what really happened in the desert and asks him if he ever has any dreams.  Marco politely dismisses Melvin's accusations, but he knows he speaks the truth because he hasn't stopped having any dreams since he returned home and he spends his time off duty as a broken man.  Melvin's meeting sets off a chain reaction with Marco's brain and he begins to remember things better.  When he sees that Raymond Shaw has been nominated for a Vice Presidential nomination, he sets out to meet with Shaw and discover the truth.  It's a journey down a rabbit hole more terrifying than anything Alice ever met: from mind altering implants beneath the skin, convenient murders, brainwashing, with an international corporation known as Manchurian Global trying to covertly take over the world.

When I first heard that Hollywood was going to remake THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, I was very skeptical.  The original film has become a classic example of political intrigue.  That film was made in the heyday of the Cold War and not only captured the hovering suspicion leftover from McCarthyism, but also portrayed the attempted assassination of a president, eerily foreshadowing what actually happened to President Kennedy just a few month later.

Two generations have passed since original THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE and the geopolitical landscape of the world has changed drastically.  Except for the overpopulated nation of China and a few small countries scattered around the globe, Communism no longer poses a threat to democracy.  In its stead we are faced with a new type of conflict that has no national, political, and religious borders.  This new conflict provides the opportunity for businesses to engage in legal international war profiteering, something that the world has never seen the likes of.  It is against this backdrop that the new THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is set warning not of sabotage from a foreign power, but of a secret and sublime internal takeover brought about by corporate greed.

I really enjoyed THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE.  The acting is top-notch with fine performances from all lead actors (Washington, Schreiber, and Meryl Streep as Eleanor Shaw give Oscar-worth performances) and most of the supporting cast.  The script has been rewritten in such a way that it doesn't mess with the spirit of the original film and novel, but is able to add some new twists and present the troubling concept as a very real possibility more relevant than ever in our current political landscape.  The film has a great plot, wonderful writing, and some very powerful artistic and directorial techniques that add to overall tone.

Of course, even if I believed otherwise I might not say it because even now they're watching you, you know.

The DVD includes a commentary with director Jonathan Demme and co-writer Daniel Pyne, a couple of featurettes, deleted and extended scenes, outtakes with optional commentary, and Liev Schreiber's screen test.",1175472000,4,3606,5.096938775510204
2158287,5,B0006210ZG,"The original ""Candidate"" was a masterpiece, and an awfully creepy film, considering the subject matter.

I personally would not watch the original first and then this; I'd do it the other way around.  This film loosely takes the idea from the first one and replaces the communism scare with a corporate conspiracy.  Oh, it still works just fine, but in only a few scenes did I find myself comparing it back to the original one.

Meryl Streep absolutely chews the scenery in this film, playing a combination Hillary/Coulter/Matalin hybrid who suffocates her son (and sacrifices him, literally) because of her political ""true believer"" status.  Her tirade directly at fellow party members who initially reject making her son the VP nominee is classic.  It reminded me of Alec Baldwin chewing up his five minutes in ""Glengarry Glen Ross.""

The most fun in the movie is watching Liev Schreiber start to unravel as he realizes what they remember from the Gulf War is not what it seemed, as is an early scene where a fellow vet confronts Denzel's character after a rah-rah speech to boy scouts about his Kuwait exploits.  They don't waste much time here before letting you know something is really wrong.

Jonathan Demme directs and he uses his ""Silence of the Lambs"" technique of extreme facial closeups to great, disorienting effect.  It's pretty freaky, quite often.

They update the original in that the ""trigger"" isn't a visual one but a verbal one, which I thought was a nice touch.

On repeated viewings, you'll catch some things you didn't notice before going on in the background and some ""Did I just see...?"" cameos, most notably by the one and only Robyn Hitchcock.  And I swear, in one scene in the background, a guy who either is or really looks like Barry White is playing a security agent.

One last highlight is the completely over-the-top ""convention"" climax, when the two candidates come out to face the crowd.  The ""theatricality"" and over-the-top absurdity of it all (a new Mt. Rushmore?!) probably seemed ridiculously funny a few years ago, but would probably be done irony-free these days.

Oh yeah, and you'll never look at Cup O' Noodles the same again after this.

This movie isn't just a thriller with elements of a modern MK-Ultra conspiracy but also a commentary on our current political system, whereas the original dealt more with the freaky thought of communist sleeper agents in our midst.

Highly recommended.  Hey, it's Demme after all--it's hard to go wrong with this.  If you liked the final explanation/twist about what happened in 'Nam in ""Jacob's Ladder,"" this is right up your alley.",1174262400,4,2617,4.904545454545454

2158290,5,B0006210ZG,"This is that rare remake of a classic movie which actually improves on the original. Jonathan Demme, a moderately famous but greatly underrated directing talent, weaves an unnerving and spidery tapestry that chillingly illustrates the enigmatic and duplicitous times we live in. Like in the original 1964 version, a dangerously ambitious and maniacal political matroness, Senator Eleanor Shaw (Meryl Streep in another brilliant acting interpretation), suffering delusions of grandeur but no less determined, has embroiled her son, Raymond (Liev Schreiber), now a U.S. Congressman, in a vast conspiracy to seize the reigns of American power for a devious corporation. Awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for saving his platoon during an ambush in the first Gulf War, Raymond's fellow soldiers have long had painful doubts about what it is that really happened. Raymond's former commanding officer Captain Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) tries to follow the Army's orders to continue his assigned public relations tours to promote Shaw as a war hero, but privately he is racked by a nagging recurrent dream of medical experimentations, torture and brainwashing. When confronted with his old platoon buddy's seemingly delusional notebook collages of their experiences and haunting memories, Marco finally cannot deny that something very strange and wrong transpired involving Raymond during the ambush. Marco sets out for New York to confront Raymond, who has been nominated as the Democratic Vice-Presidential Candidate, and is befriended on the train by a mysterious woman who recognizes him from their neighborhood supermarket shopping. When Marco arrives in New York and meets Raymond, it may be too late for the truth to help, because most everyone is not really who they seem. It took the genius of Demme's vision to mimic the sheer paranoia and underlying terror that grips Americans today in our post-9/11 collective misery. The Manchurian Group corporation of the film, which has implanted its victims with mind-controlling chips in clandestine medical safe-rooms, is as powerful and connected as present real life global goliaths such as The Carlyle Group or Bechtel may in fact be, and Streep's portrayal of Eleanor Shaw resembles a cross between the equally terrifying Hillary Clinton, Lenora Fulani and Eva Braun. But it's also the subtler details of the screenplay and especially the art direction and photography which mark this film as a quality achievement. From Marco's obsession with trying to figure out his alter-nightmare dream life, to his neurotic need for Cup 'O Noodles soups, red tomatoes and No-Doze tablets, the film also achieves an accurate, hallucinatorily-realistic portrayal of how people in today's propaganda-saturated media landscape are reduced to acting as brainwashed automatons and circus spectators, cheering lustily for Hollywood socialist political creations such as Hillary Clinton, John Edwards and Barack Obama. The entire nation has been reduced to a mass of mindless, public-schooled political groupies on one side, loyally allegiant to the 'Great National Cause' of 'Democracy', and the disaffected, disillusioned loners on the other who see through the hypes and the con-jobs of the fascist march to power but must suffer alone, shunned, rejected, and socially exiled because of their insight and clear understanding of the incredible lies and dishonesty behind the establishment's veneer. After all that, Demme shows us in the end that reality itself, or what we thought reality was, may be just another illusion, and what we think we know about the truth may just be implanted by unknown puppet masters, or else airbrushed onto digital video discs. We're left alone on an island finally, and the endless war goes on. We're each just another casualty, but watching Demme's great 2004 version of The Manchurian Candidate, we're able to glimpse the terrible puzzle we're trapped in for the briefest instant, through a mirror darkly, before our pieces will get reshuffled.",1164672000,6,4021,5.44551282051282

Like in the original 1964 version, a dangerously ambitious and maniacal political matroness, Senator Eleanor Shaw (Meryl Streep in another brilliant acting interpretation), suffering delusions of grandeur but no less determined, has embroiled her son, Raymond (Liev Schreiber), now a U.S. Congressman, in a vast conspiracy to seize the reigns of American power for a devious corporation. Awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for saving his platoon during an ambush in the first Gulf War, Raymond's fellow soldiers have long had painful doubts about what it is that really happened. Raymond's former commanding officer Captain Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) tries to follow the Army's orders to continue his assigned public relations tours to promote Shaw as a war hero, but privately he is racked by a nagging recurrent dream of medical experimentations, torture and brainwashing. When confronted with his old platoon buddy's seemingly delusional notebook collages of their experiences and haunting memories, Marco finally cannot deny that something very strange and wrong transpired involving Raymond during the ambush. Marco sets out for New York to confront Raymond, who has been nominated as the Democratic Vice-Presidential Candidate, and is befriended on the train by a mysterious woman who recognizes him from their neighborhood supermarket shopping. When Marco arrives in New York and meets Raymond, it may be too late for the truth to help, because most everyone is not really who they seem. It took the genius of Demme's vision to mimic the sheer paranoia and underlying terror that grips Americans today in our post-9/11 collective misery. The Manchurian Group corporation of the film, which has implanted its victims with mind-controlling chips in clandestine medical safe-rooms, is as powerful and connected as present real life global goliaths such as The Carlyle Group or Bechtel may in fact be, and Streep's portrayal of Eleanor Shaw resembles a cross between the equally terrifying Hillary Clinton, Lenora Fulani and Eva Braun. But it's also the subtler details of the screenplay and especially the art direction and photography which mark this film as a quality achievement. From Marco's obsession with trying to figure out his alter-nightmare dream life, to his neurotic need for Cup 'O Noodles soups, red tomatoes and No-Doze tablets, the film also achieves an accurate, hallucinatorily-realistic potrayal of how people in today's propaganda-saturated media landscape are reduced to acting as brainwashed automotons and circus spectators, cheering lustily for Hollywood socialist political creations such as Hillary Clinton, John Edwards and Barack Obama. The entire nation has been reduced to a mass of mindless, public-schooled political groupies on one side, loyally allegiant to the 'Great National Cause' of 'Democracy', and the disaffected, disillusioned loners on the other who see through the hypes and the con-jobs of the fascist march to power but must suffer alone, shunned, rejected, and socially exiled because of their insight and clear understanding of the incredible lies and dishonesty behind the establishment's veneer. After all that, Demme shows us in the end that reality itself, or what we thought reality was, may be just another illusion, and what we thnk we know about the truth may just be implantd by unknown puppet masters, or else airbrushed onto digital video discs. We're left alone on an island finally, and the endless war goes on. We're each just another casualty, but watching Demme's great 2004 version of The Manchurian Candidate, we're able to glimpse the terrible puzzle we're trapped in for the briefest instant, through a mirror darkly, before our pieces will get reshuffled.",1164585600,4,4018,5.440705128205129
2158292,3,B0006210ZG,"Boy, if you thought that Meryl Streep was a meanie in 2006's The Devil Wears Prada, she took mean to the extreme in 2004's The Manchurian Candidate.

A bit too far-fetched at times, The Manchurian Candidate still delivers a 2+ hour, twist filled thriller. I am surprised that Director Jonathan Demme didn't keep a better hold on reality with his great track record for doing so in movies like Silence Of The Lambs and Philadelphia under his belt.

Credibility gets a bit lost in The Manchurian Candidate by the suggestion that access to a vice presidential candidate would be so easy in order to execute the evil deeds that need to be done by his conspirators. Even more ridiculous is the notion that a vice presidential candidate could escape surveillance in order to commit heinous crimes...let's say for example...a double-murder.

Regardless of the sensational conspiracy, the movie is quite entertaining. Good story. Good story-flow. Good actors. Meryl Streep does a terrific Mommy Dearest. Denzel Washington is, as always, on target. And Liev Schreiber plays a zombie well.

2158303,2,B0006210ZG,"THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is a sluggish remake and updating of the 1962 classic starring Frank Sinatra. This film is a case study in why some movies should never be redone.

This is a film that takes globalized issues and reduces them to personal jealousies. Afraid to assert a viewpoint, the script meanders. Denzel Washington plays the Sinatra role of Ben Markoe. He seems dazed on camera as though he is struggling to remember his lines.  Washington, normally a gifted actor, plays the part without any conviction whatsoever and uncharacteristically brings zero charisma to the role.

Markoe discovers that his Gulf War comrade-in-arms, Raymond Shaw, soon to be the next Vice-President of the United States, has been the subject of mind control experimentation by Manchurian Global, a vast multinational conglomerate. Raymond's handler is his Senator mother (Meryl Streep in the role of an ice queen).

By diluting the threat from Communism to Capitalism, the producers lose sight of the most powerful elements of the story. After all, it is no great achievement to convince a major American political candidate to back big business, and so the grotesqueries of Shaw's brainwashing get lost against the backdrop, seeming less heinous than merely greedy, even when Shaw becomes a programmed murderer at the hands of his avaricious, amoral, and possibly incestuous mother.

Why the film created the unlikely Manchurian Global corporation as the demon of the day and shied away from any real political controversy is indicative of the Manchurian Global mindset that has gripped Hollywood. God forbid we should point a finger at mainland China (or anyplace else); it might reduce the bottom line. This film says more about its creators than about the threat it attempts to portray.

2158305,2,B0006210ZG,"What ever happened to the tight and taut political thriller movies of the sixties? Remember 'Seven Days in May', 'The Parallax View' . Even the original ""Manchurian Candidate"". Well unfortunately they find no suitable heir to their tradition in this movie. ""The Manchurian Candidate"" remake provides a great story line and the original provides a great precedent, they even have a great cast of seasoned actors and stars...

But the final result is slow, plodding and whatever tension or mystery is built, and there is not much of that, is plainly dissipated so early that I kept wanting the damn assassination to be over and the hero shot so I could go to bed. I'm not sure if it's bad writing or bad editing to blame but the movie is a real disappointment. I don't think the big name stars will want to remember it either.

The only thing worse are the DVD extras. There are a series of short interviews with a selection of 'pundits', discussing contemporary political challenges. With terrorism and civil liberties under threat this should be a lively discussion. Unfortunately the 'pundits' are all wannabe no bodies with absolutlely nothing valuable to say. To make things worse none of them seem capable of making a logical adult sentence. All vibe and no verbs. The pundits all seemed to reflect the same leftoid point of view too. Nothing wrong with that. I use the term 'leftoid' because I think they are hollow shells, pod people, not real leftists. These ""pundits"" if anything dumb down the left or liberal position so much that it is must be embarassing for genuine liberals or radicals to watch. I can't see these guys persuading anyone.

2158309,2,B0006210ZG,"The decline of Jonathan Demme into derivative hackery has often been put down to the curse of Oscar, but it's to be hoped that after his horribly misguided remake of The Manchurian Candidate the only way is up. Even were the original not such a terrific movie, this one would fall on its lack of wit or imagination, not least because of a strikingly poor script by Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris that not only fears what's best in the novel and the original film but also lacks logic, momentum, satire, characterization or, most crucially for a thriller, suspense or even cheap thrills. There are a few positives: the red menace now becomes Haliburton - sorry, Manchurian Global - the romantic interest has a more valid reason for involving herself with an obvious psychiatric case and there is one neat switch in the finale. Unfortunately they're all thrown away, with an epilogue that is truly absurd, while the political commentary is never embedded in the narrative but crudely pasted on in the form of news reports. And is it just me, but why do the hands-on villains have to be Brits? Can any nation have treated their allies in not one but two Iraq wars with such open contempt?

Even on a technical level, at times it's strikingly clumsy, be it the often crude editing, the inane nightmare sequences or the literally unbelievable sound mix (those cheers on the nomination speeches set a new low in credibility). But the biggest problem, along with chronic overlength, is that you never care about anyone in the film. Whereas Laurence Harvey's pathetic cold fish latched onto Frank Sinatra's Marco even though he knew he despised him out of a terrible and desperate loneliness born of self-loathing in the original, Demme and Levine keep the two apart for most of the film, denying both of them the relationships with `normal' characters that highlighted their damaged psyches in the original. Nor are the actors able to draw you in much either. Denzel Washington is on poor form for much of the film until his paranoia takes him over Parallax style. Liv Schreiber fares better, but seems to be channelling Robert Foxworth circa 1978. But the real nail in the coffin is Meryl Streep, an actress who may have heard of subtlety once but has since gone out of her way to avoid it at all costs, giving the worst performance of her career, displaying an unbelievable assortment of ridiculously over the top mannerisms that put you in mind of a drunken Robert Newton playing Widow Twankey in a rundown seaside town's annual Christmas panto. Her Wicked Witch of the Far Right constantly screams ""LOOK AT ME!! ME!! ME!!! I'M ACTING!!! I'M ACTING!!! AND I'M GREAT AT IT!!!"" through a megaphone.

2158311,2,B0006210ZG,"I'd held off for a bit on seeing this; the original Manchurian Candidate is an all-time favorite movie, and, well, you know...

At the end of this film I scooted over to my bookshelf and grabbed the DVD case of the original. My guess was the remake was no more than 90 minutes and the original must have been at least two and 1/2 hours in duration. Good Lord! They were both exactly 129 minutes long!

There's a profound lesson here. The first film, in that wonderful 129 managed to tell a great story, travel a lot, freak me out repeatedly, stun me with novelty (the playing cards, the whole Republican/McCarthy/Lincoln shtick, the ""flower show' interrogation, the ""jump in a lake"", getting drunk with Shaw, and on and on) work in a great love story, work in a tragic love story, work in a pathological love story, and develop a host of intriguing characters, and thrill me with what seemed to be an unending sequence of marvelous performances. The equally lengthy remake stirred little sympathies and seldom got off the ground. As storytelling, the film spun its wheels. You'd think if you remake a movie, ignore character development, ignore any relationship development, ignore any complex and intelligent commentary on modern goings-on (it was just terrorism and corporate involvement in war handled in the most superficial way)--ignore a whale of a lot--you could bring the thing in at about 48 minutes, maybe 60 with commercials. If I watch it again (not likely) I'll have a stop-watch handy and I'll take notes. It was like some magic trick.

So what happened in that 129 minutes anyway? I'm honestly not sure--Denzel Washington sweats a lot and communicated none of the subtlety and complexity that Sinatra managed, Meryl Streep brought on the heretical thought that maybe she's overrated and maybe Angela Lansbury was underrated, I missed Janet Leigh who delivered the same lines splendidly, I missed the black humor and irony and ambiguity, and who the heck was that bad Lawrence Harvey impressionist? Motivations were lost, the WHOLE POINT that everyone hated this guy but parroted their adoration for him wasn't presented clearly, and the motivation for the entire brainwashing venture was muddled up by the script after first stating that it was all about control. What a mess. Every time the film tried to echo the original, it'd already gone so far off track that it just confused matters even worse.

My serious suggestion is that some professor (and not necessarily a film professor) have a class watch both versions, note what went right in 129 minutes in the original, and what went horribly wrong in the 129 minutes of the remake and then have the students try to explain why. My guess is the answers will be fascinating.

It's a one-star movie but I give it two because it was up against impossible-to-beat competition.",1141516800,71,2841,4.885892116182573
2158322,2,B0006210ZG,"This movie is another classic example of what is wrong with so many Hollywood movies lately. They are all about flash and forget the substance. I picked up the Manchurian Candidate because Denzel Washington always delivers a watchable performance and because of the history of the original film.

Although it was not boring, it didn't have the excitement, the edge-of-your-seat suspense that the original '62 picture had. The Manchurian Candidate is just plain dull. Never mind the original version -- this is not a remake as much as it is an adaptation so I judge it strictly on its own merits. However, it is so weak that it barely has its own merits. The story is slow and inconsistent and the directing is just plain heavy handed - focusing more on mood and music rather than story and plot. At one point about 15 minutes from the end credits all of the implications crystallize and the viewer can finally care - if they haven't given up completely.",1141344000,4,953,4.706586826347305
2158323,3,B0006210ZG,"In the ""Manchurian Candidate,"" director Jonathon Demme asks the question: Can a man from Manchuria be elected vice president?  Of course, the answer is yes, but he can't be elected president.  This has to do with the laws passed by congress which enable immigrants to this country to run for any elected office short of the presidency.  And herein lies the problem with Demme's film - the answer is obvious from the opening scenes.

Loosely based on the Frank Sinatra hit, ""Come Blow Your Horn,"" the movie stars Denzel Washington as Freddie, a hip young architect who has just completed drawings of a replacement for the Twin Towers in Boston after the attacks of 8/11.  Freddie happens to know a friend from Manchuria, the ever-lovable and enjoyably cute Liev Shreiber, who plays ""Freddie,"" a man intent on rising through the Republican ranks of power to become the next vice president.  The film also features fine performances from Obba Babatunda as ""Senator Wells,"" and the incomprable Simon McBurney as ""Atticus Noyle,"" who, along with  the piercing Michael Pierce as ""Secret Service Agent #2,"" attempt to convince Freddie to build a podium for Freddie so that he may appear to be taller than he is in reality, thus impressing the Republican convention with his height and recent penile surgury.

Will Freddie build the podium for Freddie?  Will the Boston city council approve of Freddie's new Twin Towers design?  Will Freddie put in a good word for Freddie?  Will Secret Service Agent #2 receive the promotion he's worked so hard for so long, or will he have to finally take a bullet to earn the respect of his superiors?  And, more importantly, will Senator Wells add his name to the new appropriation bill or won't he?  Events begin to spin out of control as an eager nation watches and you may not see most of it coming.

All in all, it is a fine film and I am giving it my approval, if for no other reason than because it is a fine film, all in all.  The performance of Teddy Dunn as ""The Mysterious Arabic Woman,"" is something to behold - I think we have found a new star in the making.

Cast:  Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep, Liev Schreiber, Jeffrey Wright, Kimberly Elise, Anthony Mackie, Adam LeFevre, Ann Dowd, Simon McBurney.

Running Time:  129 minutes

Rated R for violence and some language.

""The Manchurian Candidate"" is ""Silence of the Lambs"" director Jonathan Demme's remake attempt at the 1962 classic.  In the new film, the villainous force isn't Communism, but capitalism, or more specifically, a vaguely defined corporate entity that hopes to rule the world. As such, in giving us a generic corporate villain, the film has all the gravity of a James Bond adventure. The change is revealing in that it shows the political correctness of Hollywood thinking (in not wishing to slur any ethnic group, or for that matter any specific political party), plus it shows the lack of creative thinking in Hollywood (by playing it safe and trite with the usual stereotypical band of rich, white, male Western capitalists as the baddies).  Denzel Washington plays Colonel Ben Marco, who we first meet delivering a speech to a Boy Scout troop about his experiences in the first Gulf War, and how Congressman Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber, who deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor) saved his platoon from an enemy attack. Marco, we soon discover, has been having mysterious dreams that say otherwise. Dreams of torture, medical experimentation, brainwashing, and murder. He is motivated to investigate the dream when he finds out from a former platoon mate (Jeffrey Wright) that he's not alone in wondering what really happened that night.  Meanwhile, Raymond Shaw has just been positioned as his party's reluctant nominee for Vice-President of the United States thanks to the machinations of his nightmarish mother (Meryl Streep), who is a US senator. Marco visits Shaw and tries to get Shaw's help in figuring out what happened, but Shaw is reluctant to get involved. he suspects Marco is insane. Little does he know, his mind is being controlled by the very same people Marco's been dreaming about.

Arguably, the actors in this remake are better than the actors in the original, or at least Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep and Liev Schreiber give more nuanced and complex performances. Yet, better isn't necessarily better. Frank Sinatra's Capt. Marco was a troubled man, who still was in control, he grounded the film; Washington's Marco is progressively more unstable and somehow less satisfying as a-man-no-one-will-believe clich. Schreiber, who even looks a little like a baby-faced Laurence Harvey, plays Raymond with a gentle vulnerability, which would make him appealing as the would-be candidate, but it was Harvey's unrelenting nastiness that made it so ironic in the original that he ultimately became both heroic and sympathetic. This film begs you to like Raymond Shaw; the previous one dared you to. Even Kimberly Elise, whose Rosie is now an intricate part of the story, lacks that cool charm and dry humor of Janet Leigh's mysterious and ultimately irrelevant character in the first film. The characters have been rewritten, but not reenergized.  Streep, with the thankless job of trying to fill the iconic shoes of Angela Lansbury, gives her character a controlled ruthlessness that is perfectly believable; but lacking that mix of cold-blooded ruthlessness and cheerfully vicious opportunism that made Lansbury's performance a classic. Streep gives a fine performance; Lansbury gave a unique performance. Plus, by making Streep an actual Senatorm logical, given the times, her power is made obvious and the character is the weaker for it. Lansbury, on the other hand, was playing Lady Macbeth, a power behind the throne whose dominance was all the more frightening because it was unexpected, inexplicable, yet unquestioned.

To their credit, the filmmakers have tried to follow the blueprint of the original film, while still adding twists and clever surprises to make the story different, if not fresh. Unfortunately, many, if not all, of the changes don't work or don't improve anything. Despite a reasonable effective start the film begins a downward arc, right up to a twist-upon-a-twist ending that makes the unlikely plot seem simply stupid. It says something when you end a film with a political assassination and still can't generate suspense. And it doesn't help that the convention and rally sequences all look totally fake.  Some films are simply products of their times; they don't translate to different eras. Frankenheimer's ""The Manchurian Candidate"" is one; it plays as fresh and exciting today as it did them, but it is nonetheless an artifact of the Cold War era. It tells us something about America, circa 1950-1965. All Demme's ""Candidate"" tells us about 21st century America is that Hollywood has gotten lazy.  Not a bad film by any strech of the imagination, but not up to the original version.",1136073600,13,4895,5.233716475095785

Though older generations criticize remaking these films, the newer generations are happy to see them with the latest theatrical technology.  The remake I am going to be reviewing is called ""The Manchurian Candidate"".  In my opinion, the remake is superior to the original.  Though the acting was great in the original, I am more of a fan of Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep.

 The synopsis of the movie is this:  Captain Bennett Marco (Denzel Washington) and Sgt. Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) were part of a platoon of soldiers kidnapped and brainwashed in Desert Storm. Ten years later, Shaw, a ""war hero"", runs for vice president while Marco, label paranoid by the government, eventually remembers being kidnapped and discovers that Shaw's mother (Meryl Streep) played a big part in the brainwashing. Bennett must now convince Shaw that the brainwashing really happened. Washington does a superb job as the hero; he isn't the flashy, perfect hero that we usually see in movies these days.  Schreiber also does an excellent job in this movie as well.  His character is the innocent victim.  He is a good person but is under the control of his evil, power-hungry mother.  Streep steals the show though.  Her character is so manipulative and evil that is was just great to watch.  The director, Jonathan Demme, does an excellent job guiding this movie along.  The camera work that he utilizes really adds to the suspense of the film.

 Overall, I think that any fan of suspense movies should go out to see this film.  It is very creepy in the beginning and then gets better as you figure out what is going on.  The actors all give an excellent performance and are lead by a great director.",1133136000,3,1767,4.7947019867549665
2158327,3,B0006210ZG,"I was exited to hear that there would be a remake of the 1962 Frank Sinatra classic The Manchurian Candidate, and excited still to learn that it would star two of Hollywood's finest in Streep and Washington, but what interested me the most was that the film would be directed by Academy Award winner Jonathon Demme (The Silence of the Lambs).  Demme, in my opinion, is the king of suspense.  His trademark actor-looks-straight-into-camera shots are amazing.  He takes something so simple and fuels it with suspense and horror, and it's only heightened by the fact that it appears the characters are looking directly at us.  But alas, even the fine actors and wonderful Demme couldn't save this film.

It starts off brilliantly.  Demme uses his close-ups and the tension mounts from scene to scene.  Even scenes that aren't intended to be suspenseful teem with a sense of pervading fear, overlapped by distant news media reports of growing violence in the Middle East.  Washington is very effective in the role of the shaken Capt. Bennett Marco.  The dream sequences are horrific, complete with terrifying tattooed women and images of murder.  But as the movie progresses, it begins to disappoint.  The cable news images are almost unbearably tacky (although perhaps that was intentional as a device to show the utter absurdity of the 24-hour news beast).  Also, the rules of American politics seem not to apply to the purposes of this film.  If you are in any way a pursuer of the Beltway, it will annoy you that this film invents political processes where they do not exist.  At times, it moves too quickly, leaving gaps that concern revelation and understanding.  In one scene, Capt. Marco denies having ever had nightmares of his tenure in the Gulf War, soon we learn that this is a lie, and in an instant, we find him sitting before an army counsel alleging that he and his men were brainwashed to believe that now-congressman Raymond Prentiss Shaw (Liev Schreiber) heroically saved their lives.  Yet, this is news to us, we had no idea this was how the Captain felt.  When did he reach this conclusion?  There are far too many instances like this.

In the end, this is still a good film and deserving of certain praise if for nothing more than the brilliance in which Meryl Streep portrays the insanely evil Sen. Ellie Shaw, a movie villain of the utmost stature.  But that being said, it could have been so much more.  It was smart to attempt to cash in on the fear that now possesses what I am certain will come to be known as the Age of Terror, but in the end, the movie misses it's mark.  It had that potential to be a dark satire of the deviant world of American politics and a smart horror presentation of the world at present, but unfortunately, it fails to deliver.",1130198400,2,2778,4.672839506172839
2158328,4,B0006210ZG,"Jonathan Demme's ""The Manchurian Candidate"" is a superb and timely 21st Century remake of John Frankenheimer's 1962 classic of Cold War terror and paranoia.  For this new version, the Cold War has been replaced by the War on Terror as the menacing background against which the story unfolds, but, apart from that, the major plot points in both films are virtually the same.  Both involve a group of soldiers who are brainwashed into believing that one of them, Sergeant Raymond Shaw, is a hero whose unquestioning bravery and quick thinking on the battlefield saved the lives of most of the men in that squadron.  (The original's Korean War setting has been updated to the Gulf War's Desert Storm).  In fact, upon his return, Shaw is awarded the Medal of Honor, a tribute he eventually parlays into a career as a United States congressman.  After several of the men in the squadron begin having the same recurring nightmare in which they are being subjected to murderous hypnotic suggestions, one of them, Captain/Major Bennett Marco, comes to suspect that they may all be the victims of some nefarious scheme to implant them with microchips to get them to believe something that is not true.  One of the few key differences between the new version and the old version is that the ""Manchurian"" of the title no longer refers to the Communists who do the brainwashing but rather to a mega-corporation (called Manchurian Global) that has positioned itself as the master puppeteer pulling the strings of government behind the scenes.  And in its scathing vision of modern day politics, the film asks just how much of our freedom and civil liberties we are willing to sacrifice in exchange for ""security"" and ""safety.""  No theme could be more timely.

It would be a disservice to ""The Manchurian Candidate"" to reveal too much about its ingeniously contrived plot, which is chock full of intrigue, suspense and larger-than-life events and people.  The dominating figure in the nightmare scenario is Eleanor Shaw, an uber-powerful senator and the ultimate Machiavellian matriarch, whose unrelenting and nefarious effort to get her craven, mediocre Congressman son elected Vice President, serves as the engine that pulls the story forward.  Thus, while Marco spends his time trying to piece together some semblance of the truth out of the fabricated memories and distorted half-truths spinning around in his jumbled memory and mind, Eleanor works her way to the ultimate position of power.

This new ""Candidate"" gleans its topicality and its contemporary significance by zeroing in on the nexus that exists between politics and the corrupt military-industrial complex - a connection made even more frightening when the latter, working in a moral vacuum, is able to employ the latest in technological advancements to further its cause.

Although the surrealistic elements are probably less shocking today than they were in 1962, the film still does an amazing job replicating the dislocation and fragmentation of Marco's mind, establishing a beautiful balance between the world of ""real"" reality and the world of virtual reality, a concept that seems far less incredible in this day and age of ubiquitous computer technology.

Denzel Washington takes over the role of Marco, originally played by Frank Sinatra, and Live Schreiber replaces Laurence Harvey as the mother-dominated Shaw.  Both actors are superb.  But it is Meryl Streep, stepping in for Angela Lansbury as the Big Bad Mama Supreme, who walks off with the film.  Her portrayal of a ruthless and icy Lady MacBeth who will stop at nothing to get what she wants is bone-chilling and unforgettable.

In an age in which most thrillers are formulaic, empty exercises in high-tech wizardry and flash, perhaps it was necessary to reach back 42 years to find a work of power and substance to remind us of just how dangerous it is to allow modern technology to fall into the hands of the power-hungry and the ruthless.  Indeed, what this gripping tale of an attempted coup against the United States government manages to do is to remind us that, even in this age of international terrorism, the greatest threat to our unity as a nation and our safety as a people may actually come from within.",1129593600,2,4237,5.027142857142858

Schreiber's mother is played by Meryl Streep (upcoming Prime with Uma Thurman, The Hours) who gives a good performance here as she fools everyone around her, giving speeches and so on.

2158330,3,B0006210ZG,"On routine recon during Operation Desert Storm, Capt. Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) and his team, including Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) mysteriously disappear for three days, but later Sgt. Shaw is awarded the Medal of Honor for saving the men, except for two unavoidable fatalities. Years later, Shaw is positioned to run for Vice-President of the United States, if his conniving mother, Senator Eleanor Shaw (Meryl Streep) has anything to say about it.

Ben Marco is deeply disturbed, far more than warranted by delayed stress reaction, haunted by nightmares and images of himself and Shaw in a clinical setting. The VA doctors can do nothing but medicate Marco, but when another soldier from their unit approaches with some of the same dreams and memories, Marco begins to wonder if something was done to his group during those three missing days in the Middle East.

Eventually, Marco contacts Shaw, but Shaw is unwilling to hear his fellow soldier out, in the

middle of his political campaign. Left to his own devices, Marco does his own research; he is being watched, but it is unclear who is doing the surveillance and why. Psychologically unmoored, Marco drifts along, occasionally jolted by recurring images and fragments of conversations. The momentum of a political campaign is contrasted with Marco's confusion. Urging Shaw to meet with him, Marco hopes they can unravel the dreams and the missing days. But Shaw remains emotionally unavailable, almost an automaton, at least the way Schreiber chooses to portray the candidate. Shaw: ""Life is so bizarre, isn't it?"" Marco: ""Which one?""

As Shaw's mother, Eleanor Prentiss Shaw, Streep is smarmy and unctuous, a controlling matriarch unwilling to let her son out of her sight, directing his career and bullying anyone who opposes her agenda, chewing up the screen and all in her wake. There is one particularly disgusting scene between mother and son that leaves little to the imagination. Certainly, Streep doesn't look old enough to play Schreiber's mother, but maybe this character has something else in mind. Washington is larger onscreen than this role, plodding along in a fog, but determined to learn the truth.

The evil plot goes as planned... almost, but Raymond finally disappoints as the perfect son, the scheme set in motion during the Gulf War thwarted. Only in the movies. With media cooperation, the ""assassin"" is identified, but the plan is never exposed to a gullible public, glued to their television screens. A murky screenplay renders this film somewhat confusing. With its twisted psychological overtones, Jonathan Demme's version hasn't the dramatic punch of the original, which starred Frank Sinatra, Laurence Harvey and Angela Lansbury.

2158343,2,B0006210ZG,"Being a huge fan of the original film, I was immediately intrigued upon learning that there was going to be a remake - starring Denzel Washington in the Frank Sinatra role, no less. Denzel as Maj. Ben Marco! Jonathan Demme directing?? And one thing I found out about this new version of ""Manchurian Candidate"" is that the ending is truer to the original book than the 1962 version was. So that right there gave me three reasons to make this a MUST SEE!

However, this rehash of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" left me feeling totally cheated. I know they decided to update the script to modernize it for today's audiences (the threat of Communism in Cold War America was the focus in the original), but making corporate America the enemy instead and brainwashing an entire platoon into believing their hated sergeant, Raymond Shaw, saved their lives in the Gulf War (when he really didn't) and becomes a decorated war hero for it was too much of a stretch for me to believe. It was a veritable plot with the Russians, Koreans and Chinese as the evil leaders of Communism in the '50s and '60s, but not now. Stories like this aren't meant to be updated because they don't translate well when they are made for a new generation.

Are we really supposed to buy this new twist on the story that Manchurian Global, a huge and powerful international corporation, wants to have a ""yes"" man in the White House? Couldn't they just do that with campaign contributions?
And while we're asking questions, what is the purpose of going to such an extreme length to do this, brainwashing the whole platoon to believe that Raymond is a great guy? If he's already been elected to public office, then who cares if he was likable or not? Would it really matter? Why choose Shaw and not someone else? It doesn't make sense. In the original, you might have found suitable answers to some of these questions. In this one, they are never answered. There are a lot of loose ends that were left hanging when they re-wrote this script.

I was really disappointed in the Raymond Shaw character, which in the original (played superbly by Laurence Harvey), was truly obnoxious to everyone around him and he had an absolutely venomous attitude when it came to his mother. He literally could not stand the sight of her. However, in this one, Raymond (Liev Schrieber) merely tolerates her overbearing behavior with a ho-hum type persona. There is a scene between mother and son which is stomach-turning, and further gives you the impression that perhaps Raymond didn't despise his mother as much as he claimed to. He also seems to like the attention he is given as the winner of the Congressional Medal of Honor; whereas in the original film, he hated all the fuss made over him because of it. The role of the inept stepfather senator, John Iselin, is non-existent in this version, and Raymond becomes the political figure whose domineering mother (who is herself a state senator) is pushing her son far beyond where he wants to go.

I love all the actors in this movie (Denzel and Meryl Streep as Raymond's hell-on-wheels mother were especially convincing), but this was a poor vehicle for all of them. As in the original version, I failed to see the purpose of the character of Eugenie aka Rosie (played by Janet Leigh in the 1962 version, and Kimberly Elise in this one). At least they gave her more to do in this version, so that was a small plus, but not by much.

To me, the star-power was not enough to save ""The Manchurian Candidate"". I found it too lengthy and boring, and I honestly fell asleep in the theatre while watching it. When I woke up from my nap, and it was still on, I couldn't believe that it wasn't over yet. Maybe because I am such a fan of the original, my opinion is biased. If I had never seen it, I probably would have enjoyed this film a lot more. But I truly feel that to remake this classic - even with Jonathan Demme as director - was a colossal waste of time. Goes to show that you shouldn't try to improve upon perfection. Watch the original instead.",1127001600,3,4046,4.575172413793103
2158344,3,B0006210ZG,"Denzel Washington happens to be one of my favorite actors. He is just a convincing person in whatever role; whether he be Malcolm X or a dirty cop. He shines again in this one, about an experiment by a Venture capital company into mind control techniques on gulf war veterans.

What disturbed me about the story was not that this could be happening (and I don't not doubt it) but that it would be highly improbable to get someone into so high a position in the greatest power on earth. Had they made it at the state level then perhaps that may have had some credibility.

Apart from losing touch with reality on that point, I think the rest of the work is fairly well done. It was certainly entertaining and except for that black woman who acts as the FBI officer (Kimberly Elise I think) who in my opinion takes overacting to an extreme (check out the emotional scenes in John Q), the rest of the cast was great.

It is a definite thriller, but unfortunately it isn't an unforgettable classic. 3.5 stars from me.",1126569600,,1013,4.435483870967742
2158345,4,B0006210ZG,"Manchurian Candidate is closer to the original, at least in spirit, than you may expect -- even though it's not the exact movie, it hardly could have been. The relevance of the original to today's events counts little to an audience with little sense of history, and that has a hard time drawing meaning from any social context out of its experience.  One glimpse of black and white films stock, men in felt brim hats, and cinematic conventions from an earlier era, and most teenyboppers under the age of thirty grab for the remote.  Since they will only sit through a first run, it is good that they have one.  Fortunately, the update stands on its own.

The new is less dialog-driven, which tends to make it less literate.  But this film runs more on mood than on dialog, and the moods created by Jonathon Demme's just-barely-odd framing and pacing can provoke discomfort on a subliminal level.  It is not cozy, and is laid out with less detailed explanation.  The resulting sense of uncertainty may be part of why the film is not so universally appreciated.

The remake does solve some of the problems of the first.  Gone are the swarthy, vaguely foreign-looking actors standing in for Russians and Chinese agents.  Gone are the poorly choreographed ju-jitsu moves that might provoke giggles in a present day audience, used to world-class martial artists on screen, and the multi-racial world commonly reflected on film now, vs the early 1960's.

The new film retains the acting strengths of the original.  Every performance is fine.  Liev Schrieber's work is worthy of Laurence Harvey's original, a gut kicking performance, though Harvey still holds the edge.  Washington's craft is more than a match for Sinatra's unevenly inspired work.  (One of the wonders of the first is realizing that Sinatra -could- act, that he did things with rhythm and cadence because those were his only tools, and it worked. He was no method actor, but he very much had something going on.)  Streep's scenery chewing is, frankly, perfect.  Because unfortunately, really disgusting people actually do exist, and in positions of power.  And unlike an actor's performance, criticism of real public figures whose behavior is over-the-top seems completely irrelevant.  Seen or heard any Fox commentators recently?  Streep's Senator Shaw may well be over-the-top, but the only thing that distinguishes her from the real thing is that she is only play-acting.

Make no mistake, both original and remake are thrillers in the paranoid vein, and the overly literal person will likely say of either, ""preposterous"" -- despite the original being a classic.  But literal truth is not what filmmaking ought to be about, and such criticisms fail to register with me.

So is this as excellent a film as the original, adjusting for the times in which each was made?  Not quite, but it is a good film.  It hits in the right places, horrifies us with an incredibly cynical vision of what our nation is becoming, and yet it is offset by the thinnest sliver of a wild, earnest Patriotism.",1125792000,3,3051,4.912109375

2158348,2,B0006210ZG,"The script is the spine of a film; I guess there must not be any doubt about it. And this is, precisely the main default: there were too unfinished many details and the cast direction was really terrible.

Let's start with the FBI female agent: simply unbearable; I really couldn't believe it: this role was a fundamental piece in this puzzle script and facing her with Denzel Washington the difference increased exponentially: inexpressive and extremely flat acting without hues.

What happened with Meryl Streep? This character wasn't understood; the perversity, cruelty level and moral depravation shown by Langsbury can not be reduced to a cynical smile and some frenetic raptures. The audience does not know anything about her past; there wasn't a simple flash back about her relationship with her husband; Streep was extremely monochromatic, vapid if you want if you consider her actress status, she seemed to be absolutely absent. I just think in three actresses who perhaps could match with this extremely complex role: Jessica Lange would have been my first choice, Glenn Close (Dangerous liaisons and Fatal Attraction are enough evidences she likes and even handles those border edge roles), or Helen Mirren.

What's up with the implant as dramatic support?, insipid and imprecise.

What about with the wasted talent of Mr. Voight?  his lines seem be written by a personal enemy. The dramatis personae about a crisis of such magnitude were not polished at all. The dialogues do not reflect the real magnitude of what's goin' on.

In the other hand, Denzel saves the game with his undeniable talent but it wasn't enough. Roland Shaw character was OK but Demme doesn't feel comfortable with this political thriller. I just can think in three directors that know this land and domain the multiple involved implications: Phillip Noyce , Wolfang Petersen and Oliver Stone.

Finally the pretentious twist of fate of the original script at the end of the film, was a true anticlimax.

This movie was one that required your utmost attention throughout and still you missed things. The DVD version is much better than the theater run because you can rewind and re-watch for things you missed.  This makes it worth owning.

A group of soldiers are brainwashed to think that one of them was a war hero, when in fact nobody was in combat.  The ""war hero"" was being pushed by his ex-senator mother (played brilliantly by Meryl Streep in her first truly ""evil"" role) into politics and is on the verge of a possible nomination for the vice presidency.

Some of the men start having recurring dreams that make them doubt what they thought was reality.  Denzel Washington, who was leading the soldiers back in the Gulf War, wants to get to the bottom of it.  Each time he gets close to some information he is told that he needs to continue taking his ""medication"" for the Gulf War syndrome.

Things really get confusing when Denzel is being followed by government people and locates a computer chip in his back, that has capabilities that Denzel's friend who is a computer expert says could not possibly exist.

The viewer can kind of figure out the Manchurian corporation is somehow behind everything and that it is all an elaborate plot to get the ""war hero"" into office.  The tension mounts however, where the viewer doesn't know how things will play out and if Denzel's character will come out of it alive.

2158363,2,B0006210ZG,"Jonathan Demme's retread of the old goofy-creepy conspiracy theory classic ""The Manchurian Candidate"" is a cheese sandwich.

You read that right: this movie is a Cheese Sandwich.

No, you haven't gotten back from a super-secret patrol deep inside Iraqi-controlled territory. No, you haven't been ambushed, sprayed by helicopter gunships bearing the gift of Better Living through Chemical Weapons, manhandled and hauled off to a super-duper-secret Gulf island laboratory/torture-center, and jacked up with implants.

It's not the implants talking, Soldier---not now. This movie is a Cheese Sandwich.

I mean that, quite simply: it's competently put together, nothing special, and does its job. And in an hour, not only won't you remember the Cheese Sandwich, but you'll be hungry all over again.

Pretty dismal that with all that talent on-board (Denzel Washington, Jon Voight, Miguel Ferrer), a big sleek Hollywood budget, and one-time uber-director Jon Demme at the helm---with all that, the best Demme could do is a Cheese Sandwich?

This time Commies are out, Corporate America is in, because we all know there's nothing more terrifying than a Private Equity firm (Manchurian Global) teeming with blue-pinstripe-suited bankers poring over their Wall Street Journal and checking their stocks while plotting global perfidy. Right? And also, because Commie China would never try to brainwash a U.S. President.

Nope. Nosirree.

I'm not a stickler for logic with either movie, though the remake is a little murkier: I can see why the nefarious Russians & Chi-Coms would brainwash Raymond Shaw---their automaton gets fingered, they have total deniability (and fairly hard-to-get at zip codes).

But let's put ourselves in the cushy leather boardroom chairs at Manchurian Global, Remake Territory. Run it by me one more time why Managing Director Carstairs (ya know, the guy down the hall in Accounting) and I should put everything on the line---our careers, manor homes, Bentleys, family, fortune, freedom---to do this little Black Ops job on Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) and company.

I mean, you take all that risk, and for what? At the end of the day we get a U.S. President you can flip on and off like a light switch---and who can double as a stone-cold killer on those days when you need an assassination done and the CIA isn't checking its voice mail?

Ummm, I think not. You want your man in the White House? There's an easier way: it's called campaign contributions.

Anyway, Demme's remake isn't a bad movie, nor, as some claim, is it a politically offensive movie. It's too unsure of itself, and ultimately far too bland, to be edgy enough to offend.

It's stylish, sleek, techno, suitably paranoid and edgy. It's got Denzel Washington totally owning the Ben Marco role and making it his own, right down to grinding teeth and bulging, terrified eyes. It's got Liev Schreiber, who starts out as a creepy nutball and ends up as a creepy nutball & hot political commodity! See, brainwashing ain't so bad!

You get a funky Wyclef Jean rendering of John Fogerty's old protest song ""Fortunate Son"", which gives the remake some wry, cynical street creds early on and sets up the mood. You get Miguel Ferrer and Ted Levine (Buffalo Bill from Demme's ""Silence of the Lambs"")---don't blink or you'll miss 'em. You get seriously, skin-crawlingly creepy Arab women wandering around showing off their insanely bad henna jobs. You get about an hour of taut, paranoid nastiness that had me thinking I was going to get a conspiratorial feast instead of---well, instead of cheese, bread, and a little mayo.

Oh, you also get an appetizer of John Voight, who, after ""Anaconda"", should know to stay far away from the water. You get Meryl Streep confusing loud shouting for acting, yet again.

But in the end, this is an amazingly stupid, sadly generic flick that will exit your mind, never to return, as soon as the credits roll. Think about it this way: you manage to dig an electronic implant out of your back, proof, finally, that there's something to these night terrors after all.

Then you fumble the little gewgad, and it flies out of your slippery hands and down the drain.

Now, stay with me here, Soldier---you're telling me that you---an Army Major, a combat vet, obsessed with getting a shred of evidence that those filthy corporate McNasties are running you like a little flesh-&-blood Rayovac---you're telling me you don't know you can remove the sink drainpipe to retrieve the damned thing?

2158364,5,B0006210ZG,"First, this is not a new movie with the same script. It has just enough differences to keep you interested, if you knew the original, while staying close to the original.

Sometimes, it was eerily close. Meryl Streep played the role that Angela Lansbury originally had - I had never noticed the facial resemblance before. Liv Schreiber took Laurence Harvey's position as Raymond Shaw, and brought close resemblance to that role as well. The whole nervous tone of the movie was another good match. The constant background murmur of newscasts kept terrorist attacks, arms buildups, and the rest at the edge of attention. It worked fairly well in place of the original's Cold War jitters. And of course, Denzel Washington worked well - but he always does.

A few things didn't quite keep the tone of the original. There's a weird edge to the Shaws' mother/son relationship - enough to reinforce the over-all badness of the bad guy, but otherwise gratuitous. There's also an attempt at a happy ending that just didn't work for me. Still, those weren't enough to turn me off to the movie.

For once, a remake approaches the original movie. It replaces the Cold War bad guys with more contemporary villains, and doesn't try to follow precisely in the original's footsteps - changes that I'm sure will offend some viewers. Still, it's a good attempt and a good movie in itself. The only problem with this is the impact and importance of the movie that it follows, giving this one an impossibly high standard to meet.

2158367,2,B0006210ZG,"While the ending of this film was basically given away somewhere in the first half hour of it, there was indeed one big surprise for the viewer: that director J.Demme delivered such a sad mediocrity.

  With the storyline offering great possibilities for a great and very dark atmospheric film, Demme and the other contributors managed to make a boring saga that will have you reach for the fast-forward button in desperation.

  The story is indeed full of holes (as other reviewers mention as well) and on another surprising note D.Washington is actually pretty mediocre here too. Someone either forgot to tell the scriptwriter or Washington himself that being brainwashed does NOT mean walking around in total stupor and half asleep.

That is really one part of the film that borders bad comedy as Washington's interpretation of the brainwashed veteran trying to find out who's pulling the strings behind the New Order plot he's unwillingly involved in is simply horrible.

  To make things unbearably worse, you know far too early what the actual score is (and if you failed to figure it out early enough i'm stupified myself). But that's not the main problem. That would be that the film is so unengaging that even if it did manage to keep its plot twist unrevealed till the end it would still be boring.

  Aside of Merryl Streep who's probably the only bright spot of this flick, the casting is actually a disaster. The senator candidate looks like someone out of a toothpaste commercial and acts like someone out of a toothpaste commercial. Granted, some politicians do look and act that way, but this is not what this film needed. The rest of the cast are simply putting in a good day's work, grab the check and go home.

  The biggest failure here is by far the script. Had the script been adequate the actors would've (perhaps) put in a better and more engaging performance. But that's as iffy as the plot itself if not more so. In a film like this, where the storyline has to be super tight in order to capture the audience it's exactly that element that falls loudly apart. Early on too.

  All in all, keep this on your rental list for when you've run out of all the better and even lesser choices you've got. I'm sure that list is ever-expnading.",1114992000,3,2261,4.678481012658228

WARNING - SPOILERS!

It seriously takes nothing away to mention the changes from the original, since they're both mentioned in reviews (here and elsewhere) and apparent early on in the movie. And NONE of them constitute an improvement.

Rice-sized electronic implants are a foolish change from the original's concept of brainwashing. There's little evidence that anyone has ever really been brainwashed, and maybe microcircuits are more contemporary and sexy, but they get implanted in solidiers' *shoulders*, not heads - except for the one character who gets a recharge/reset via a needle into his brain, one of several crucial disconnects within the plot.

The dialogue is weak, predictable, and even sloppy. The cinematography is boring, the direction haphazard, and the casting distracting. If the actors had been nobodies, it might have stayed afloat. But when you get Denzel, Close, Voigt, and others together, you sorta kinda expect something thrilling. Instead, if you bother watching it, you'll probably find something flacid, pale, and tiring.

Verdict: skip it!",1114473600,4,1379,5.331797235023042

The original was better, but this was a pretty good thriller on its own. The remake filled in some of the pot holes that were opened in the original and created some of its own. The original was more suspenseful and I cared more about the characters. However, Denzel's character very sympathetic.

I am stuck because I don't want to reveal the changes in the plot. The original Manchurian candidate has the Cold War as its milieu. The remake has a nebulus corporate entity pulling the strings. It is just not as scary as the communist scare.

It is a good movie and the acting is very good.",1114214400,3,711,4.590551181102362
2158370,3,B0006210ZG,"Denzel Washington is pretty good in this remake of the Sinatra thriller brought up to date for a modern audience. Here playing Ben Marco, a captain (and now Major) in the US Army whose tactical unit were saved from being wiped out, by Sgt Raymond Shaw (Liev Shreiber) single handedly in Kuwait before Desert Storm, or so it would seem. Sounds straight forward, but the only problem is that Marco's unit have all since disappeared or suffered an untimely demise, and this accompanied with his strange dreams and flashbacks have led him on a one man mission to find the truth. The erstwhile saviour and hero Shaw, now riding on his heroic exploits is proudly sporting his medal of honour, and steered with political avarice by his State Senator mother (played brilliantly by Meryl Streep) is in the running to be the next Vice President. As the story unfolds we see a connection between Shaw, his mother and ""Manchurian Global"" a huge conglomerate simply reeking of political back dealing, corruption and outlawed scientific experiments in mind control, as Marco starts to fit the pieces of the jigsaw together. I'm not going to give the story away, because the movie actually does that on it's own about half way in, and tries but never really delivers on the suspense or credibility front, rather bumbling with a tepid predictability instead. Comparing this to the original (for those who have seen it) is interesting for the similarities. Both movies paint their villians well as almost insidious and faceless power figures, or puppet masters working behind the scenes, and ultimately wielding all the power, and if one had too choose, this version is probably more believable on paper. In the Sinatra movie it was of course the Communist Red Chinese (it was 1962 after all) and now it's a comparitive of virtually any modern powerful conglomerate. The movie was OK, but really had way too many improbable scenes for me. Another question I kept asking was why the villians were even tolerating the existence of Washingtons character in the first place, when he could have easily been made to ""disappear"" once he had begun to air the can of worms he had opened. Jon Voight has a nice Cameo as Senator Thomas Jordan who helps Marco, and one or two red herrings and twists help the picture hold your attention. All that said, 129 minutes is a bit long, and the constant flashbacks, and fade to black camera shots get a little tiresome. Washington is believably engaging as the paranoid shell shocked Major, and Schreiber also works hard to lift the film, but this is not something that will appear too near the top of either ones Resume I suspect. DVD extra's are standard, plus a featurette and commentary section. Unless you're a collecting fan renting is probably best advice. Enjoy",1112745600,,2783,4.836477987421383
2158381,4,B0006210ZG,"'The Manturian Candidate' has two great things to offer, and one of them is the cast, Densel Washington, Meryl Streep and Liev Schreiber plus many supporting actors whose names you might or might not know -- Jon Voight, Kimberly Elise, Jeffrey Wright, Miguel Ferrer, Ted Levine, Simon McBurney, Dean Stockwell, singer Robyn Hitchcock, and wow! Bruno Ganz of German cult classic 'Wings of Desire'!  And I though I saw the face of Roger Corman.  And is that Walter Mosley the original book writer of 'Devil in a Blue Dress'?

Besides these faces, the film effectively presents the paranoia suspence story with very brooding, atomospheric touch.  The results are often unnnerving, and almost successful in making us forget the plots and gimmicks that look no longer fresh and convincing as before.  Still, the film is worth your time.

The film is about Ben Marco (Denzel Washington good as always) who keeps on dreaming wierd dreams since he came back from the Gulf War.  Back in Kuwait, Ben, knocked down by the emeny attack, was saved single-handedly by Sgt. Shaw (Schreiber), who beat the Iraqi army.  So America hailed Shaw as war-hero, and with Shaw's fiercely power-hungry mother (Streep), Shaw is nominated for vice-president.candidate, while Ben is still tormented by the nightmares.  And going to therapies does not help.

But because of curious things, like a 'tiny sliver chip' Ben Marco finds in a strangest place, Ben starts to suspect that there is something going on within himself, within America's political system, or within America itself.  Is there any conspiracy going on around presidential campaign?  But is that possible?  And if so, how can Ben prove that when he knows his words would not be trusted anymore?

The film's premises are no longer fresh and intriguing as used to be, and director Jonathan Demme knows that.  Instead of the straight-forward approach, Demme uses his unique camera works (like frequent close-ups or characters staring into camera) to establish the brooding sinister atmosphere, which prevails the whole picture with downplayed but shrewed use of such props as news flashes.  And if a character experiences hullcination in Demme's film, he does not see the so-called 'dream sequence.'  Instead, he walks on, right through the wall of the room, and quietly accepts the 'reality' of the next room.

[WAHT'S MANTURIA?]  The original 'The Manchurian Candidate' starring Frank Sinatra (1962) has been thought one of the greatest political and paranoia suspence films ever made.  As it's classic status will not be likely to be replaced, Demme changed the meaning of 'Manturia' to something else.  The Korean War is now the Gulf War, and when the soldiers play cards, they just play cards and that's all.  Well, don't compare the original and the remake, and that's all I want to say.  You may think some changes are pointless, but Tina Sinatra (Frank Sinatra's daughter and co-producer of the remake) said OK, so it's OK.

Not as great and unsettling as the original, 'The Manturian Candidate' is still a well-made thriller with good acting and the dark and effective tone.  But don't try to think about its John Carpenter-type story or its scientific accuracy.  The film is interesting in the same way as the famous story about Coke and the subliminal message.",1111881600,2,3306,5.042357274401473

The only setbacks are in relation to:

1) The Senator being drowned without a single member of his personal security in sight (!!!), and

2158390,3,B0006210ZG,"The Manchurian Candidate (Jonathan Demme, 2004)

Note: this review contains spoilers for the 1962 edition of the film. If youhaven't seen the original, stop now and go rent it.

Taking on a remake of one of the finest films ever created takes stones. Jonathan Demme and screenwriters Daniel Pyne (The Sum of All Fears) and Dean Georgaris (Paycheck) decided to do something exceptionally risky; not only sis they update the script for The Manchurian Candidate to the present day, they also wrote a ""based-on"" screenplay that would twist things so that those who have seen the amazing original would still not know what was coming. It was, to say the least, an admirable idea, and had it worked, this new version of The Manchurian Candidate may well have stood with the original as a piece of American film history. Unfortunately, the practice didn't quite gel with the theory.

Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) led a troop of men in Kuwait just before Desert Storm. The men, now known as the Lost Platoon, were ambushed, and Marco was knocked unconscious, leading the way for Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber), after taking out the enemy, to lead the troop back to civilization for three grueling days across the desert. In the time since, Marco has stayed a career Marine, while Shaw has gone onto a career in politics, driven by his obsessed mother Eleanor (Meryl Streep). Thanks to Eleanor's machinations, Raymond snatches the vice-presidential candidacy out from under the nose of Tom Jordan (Jon Voight), with whose daughter Jocelyn (Vera Farmiga of the TV series Touching Evil) Shaw had been involved before joining the armed forces. Or, at least, that's how everyone remembers it. Marco is approached by one of the Lost Troop, Al Melvin (Jeffrey Wright of Basquiat fame), who's been having disturbing dreams about those three days. Marco's been having the dreams, too, and he undertakes a quest to figure out what really happened to them during those three days in the desert.

The Manchurian Candidate may be a remake, but it's informed by a number of things that have come between (most notably Jacob's Ladder), and so the updating-to-the-present-time part of the screenplay works better than one would expect it to. The new plot twists also work on a number of levels. Where the film fails is in its attempts to bring the original screenplay into the mix. A number of scenes (especially the garden party) and characters (most notably Jocelyn) seem as if they've been left in for the purpose of pacifying fans of the original film, and serve no real purpose in the remake. What actually happened in the desert is presented here in far more impressionist fashion than what happened to Frank Sinatra and Laurence Harvey in China in the original, and the whole things ends up being confusing, rather than illuminating. (Kudos to the screenwriters for keeping the title relevant while changing the setting, even if they did take something of an easy way out). The film's other stumbling block is that one of the new twists gives portions of the climax an overly moralizing tone that really wasn't necessary.

All that said, the usual suspects turn in some amazing performances. The infamous kiss shared between Laurence Harvey and Angela Lansbury in the original film is played with even more understatement here by Streep and Schreiber, and it's just as shocking in 2004 as it was in 1962, though more open to interpretation. Some time in this (or any) review of the film should be given to the performance of Liev  Schreiber, who has quietly amassed a resume of excellent performances under the Hollywood radar, and blossoms here, albeit as a supporting actor. (Washington's Marco has morphed into the film's main character, whereas Frank Sinatra played the supporting role to Laurence Harvey in the original, despite Sinatra and Harvey having roughly the same relative status in Hollywood in 1962 as Washington and Schreiber have today.) If anything good comes from this film, it will hopefully be Schreiber seeing more lead roles.

Both are corny in their own way. The politics in the remake are corny (showing a picture of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates' faces on Mt. Rushmore at the convention). In the original the mind-control/brain-washing is corny. But in the original, this corniness has a similar charm to the old Twilight Zone.

A problem with this film is that in some scenes, it takes itself far too seriously, while in other scenes it appears to be unintentionally comical.

It was also difficult for the writers to transfer a conspiracy to take over the US government from the Cold War to the modern era, replacing the Sino-Soviet empire of the early Cold War with a powerful conglomerate. After all, how many politicians aren't in the pocket of conglomerates these days without being brain-washed?

2158404,1,B0006210ZG,"It's a shame that Amazon does not have a button for 0 stars.

I am watching this movie right now (borrowed from a friend) and I am barely paying attention to it.  I am not a fan of remakes, but I do appreciate some of them (i.e Sabrina, Miracle on 34th St, etc).  This, however, was an idea that should have stayed in the boardroom.  This movie is awful.  It's long and drawn out, and it tried to make itself more than it really is.  It's way too violent.

Like another reviewer said, this is just going to drive viewers to see and purchase the original. Now that was creepy!  I was actually afraid of my closet!  I am only 21, but I have read plenty about the Cold War and McCarthyism.  The original made sense. This version does not.

SPOILER:  BTW, what happened to the Queen of Hearts?  The secret code from the original was WAY more clever than hearing ""Sgt. Raymond Shaw.""  Pathetic.

I am really disappointed in Denzel.  I hated Training Day, John Q, and now this. Meryl Streep is NOWHERE near as creepy as Ms. Murder She Wrote, and Liev did not make me feel sorry for him like I did the other guy. I just didn't get the hype of the movie. I found it to be very anti-climatic. Not saying that I want a remake to be an exact copy (look what happened with Psycho), but the changes were too much.  Especially the ending.

2158405,3,B0006210ZG,"The original version of this movie is one of my all-time favorites. It was one of the most thrilling movies of all time, sure, but it showed a true mastery of the medium: the pace of the movie, by and large, is slow, but it creates such an unforgettable atmosphere of dread and paranoia that you had your eyes glued to the screen for every second. The original Manchurian Candidate was excellently written and acted, and really funny--it really holds up after 40 years. When I heard it was going to be remade, I was a tad concerned, but finding out that it was going to be helmed by Demme and have a cast headlined by Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep, etc., I was understandably excited by the possibility. The themes of political treachery and paranoia could be well applied to the terrorist age, and I was anxious to see a different director's vision of this story. I had high expectations, but the end result turned out to be, well, average.

Don't get me wrong, the acting is superb. Denzel is in top form, cast against type, playing the Sinatra role in a considerably more haunted manner than the Chairman did. Liev Schreiber channels Lawrence Harvey and proves capable of taking over Harvey's classic performance. Meryl Streep, it goes without saying, is great. Jon Voight, though, gives probably the most balanced performance of the film, as a Senator who has to juggle idealism with pragmatism learned by hard experience--it's quite an accomplishment, and rings true in this age of the 'axis of evil'. Although this film didn't get any acting nods come Oscar time, it did have fierce competition, and in another year it just might have. The problem is the screenplay. If you haven't seen the original, you might imagine that this is a smart, satirical political thriller. However, if you look up the definition of those words in the dictionary, you will find the movie poster for the original incarnation of this movie. It's a tall order to remake one of the best American--heck, Earth--films of all time, and it might be unfair to criticize the movie by comparing it to the immortal source, but it is inevitable upon an undertaking like this, so here goes.

Little of what made the original film special is present here. The comic unreality of the brainwashing scenes is replaced with standard-level atrocities, the humor is replaced with such grimness that the movie draws you in easily, but it is hard to enjoy. I saw it with two rather smart people (I'm no dunce myself), and none of us could completely figure out the contradictory motivations of some of the characters, or the message of the movie. It's obviously an indictment of corporate power politics, but that is so obvious that I just imagined there had to be something more to it. The original was an indictment of McCarthy-era politics, but it also did so much more: for example, people are likely to stick with a President if something horrible happened during their term, regardless of whose fault it was. This isn't a Bush metaphor, although it applies, but the same thing happened to FDR. The message of political assassination for promotion is still provocative, since many people still believe that LBJ was in on the JFK assassination. To paraphrase Pauline Kael, that movie has some of the most sophisticated political satire ever committed to the screen. The new movie has some of the most obvious political satire ever committed to the screen: Corporations want more power? There are power-crazy people in Washington? More breaking news: there's a military-industrial compex that doesn't want peace so that they can keep their jobs, and the media is obsessed with ratings instead of being our check against power. I take a more optimistic picture of our government than the movie does, so its dripping cynicism doesn't quite hit home for me. Ultimately, Demme deserves credit for not doing a shot-to-shot remake of the original, but this movie shows how hard it is to recreate a classic movie that's just as memorable. Now, before they remake Casablanca with Ben Affleck, Owen Wilson and Natalie Portman, we should probably let the studios know that remakes are ten times harder to pull off than an original film, especially if the original is a classic, and that if they're hell-bent on remaking films, they should use bad ones so that the new ones look good by comparison. I'm thinking Ed Wood here, how about Glen or Glenda with Joaquin Phoenix and one of the Desperate Housewives? I'd sure go to see that one, and I do trust film executives to come up with a movie that's better than one of the worst of all time, but not much more.",1108339200,2,4617,4.777221526908636

And although I did not like that one very much either, I would have to say that one was more convincing. I don't want to give away things, so suffice it to say that this one seemed to have some serious flaws in the plot, and the conclusion was not really convincing. I think a better movie could have been made, in the sense of being more believable and a more convincing critique of corporate power and the military/industrial complex. Acting was good; it is the material that is not really believable. I would rather rent it than buy it.

The film is truly brilliant, it's got great cinematography, the acting is spectacular.

Academy Award Winning director Jonathan Demme (Best Director, ""The Silence of the Lambs."") is just amazing. The only true problem(s) I have with the film is, the ending which is way to drawn out, the beginning credit sequence (which is WAY TO DRAWN OUT) and the acting by Liev Schreiber is at some times horrendous. Schreiber is quite possibly one of my least favorite actors. The movies main character is Major Bennet Marco (Two Time Academy Award Winner Denzel Washington, Best Supporting Actor ""Glory"" and Best Actor ""Training Day""). Marco served in Operation Desert Storm along side Raymond Shaw (Schreiber). The way things played out is rather mysterious to Marco. After the enemy opened fire, Shaw saved the entire crew and won the medal of honor. But, the crew also disappeared for three days. Now, Shaw is running for vice president (the man also happens to be somewhat of a mommas boy for Senator Eleanor

Shaw (the terrific Meryl Streep). Marco begins having dreams and begins to uncover a conspiracy that involved Shaw and Manchurian Global, a big time company.

This should have been a great movie.  The original was great and they had that example to follow.  The thrill and suspense are built into the script.  This movie is lousy.  One of the producers/directors discusses how the blurred background behind the actors was to achieve a ""dream-like"" perspective to the scene.  He was proud of that ""artistic license"" but projecting the point of the movie was less important.  The movie ends with the business tycoons only disappointed, not punished.  Are there more brainwashed people left?  Are they thinking of a sequel?  Yes, and they should forget it.

2158424,2,B0006210ZG,"I never quite understood what exactly was happening in this film. It followed the original movie's story closely, but the changes made seemed focus-group inspired. Manchurian Global wants their own man in the White House? Well Haliburton's got their own man in the White House and no one had to put a microchip in Dick Cheney's head! The premise falls short of reality. The original mixed a sence of paranoia with black humor very well. It was told in black and white in more ways than one. This remake is far to murky and vague to generate any real sence of danger or dread.

And finally, Meryl Streep is a fine actress, but  Angela Lansbury's performance in the original is legendary. Streep doesn't even come close in comparison. Lansbury is one of the greatest movie villains ever. Her ""exit"" from the film is one of the most powerful screen images ever.",1106524800,4,858,4.675496688741722
2158425,4,B0006210ZG,"Remakes of well known movies start off saddled with an especially difficult negative.  If they make the exact same movie, why?  And if they change the movie they run the risk of offending the fans of the old movie.  Why not give it a new name and take the new direction with only the homage of having been based upon the original movie?  Do they think the name of the old movie is so powerful that it will have its own audience?

The production values of this new movie are much richer than the original black and white.  Also, this version has fabulous actors giving exceptional performances.  I mean, Denzel Washington versus Frank Sinatra?  Sinatra as an actor couldn't carry Washington's shoelaces, although Sinatra was terrific in his version of ""The Manchurian Candidate"".  I think Angela Lansbury edges out Meryl Streep, although Streep is still powerful as the mother of Raymond Shaw.  Kimberly Elise as Rosie is a completely different character with an entirely different purpose than Janet Leigh was as Rose, so it is unfair to compare the two, but both played their roles terrifically well.

I also like the cultural updates in the movie.  In the original, Lansbury had to work out her ambitions through her son because she could never have played a direct role in elective politics at the level she wanted to dominate.  In this version, Meryl Streep is a powerful and cut throat senator who wants to extend her family dynasty through her son.  This version sits absolutely in our time and culture and this forces many changes from the 1962 version.

And the director, Johnathan Demme, does make interesting changes to the plot that in some cases improve the drama of the original.  They smooth things out a bit.  Frankly, I was surprised and then pleased at which scenes from the first movie were not incorporated into this version. I missed the scenes, but then I realized they could not be topped in any remake, so why not do something different.  The one exception, and one that I feel would have made this a better movie, is a more extended perspective of what the victims of the mind control were perceiving.  This was a brilliant coup in the first movie that is missing here.

Now, the villain in this version has to be different that the Korean War cabal of world-wide communism of Korea, China, and the USSR (doe the kids today even know that name?).  And this presents a special burden to this remake.  The term ""Manchurian Candidate"" makes all kinds of sense in the first film based upon the origins of the conspirators.  In this version, the name Manchurian is given to a corporation that is given the characteristics that one side in the last Presidential campaign used to impugn Haliburton.

Of course, this film, like the first one is NOT really about the villains per se.  It is about paranoia and at what point these nightmares edge into reality or where the person seized by paranoia slips into delusion.  Yes, it is about political usurpation as well.  But it is the weaving together of these two real yet unreal worlds that works the magic.  You can enjoy the first version without believing in the existence of a powerful global communist conspiracy and you can enjoy this version without believing in all encompassing corporate power stealing our freedoms.  (Of course, each of these villains was the perfect psychological foil for its time.)

This is an effective thriller.  I like some things better in each of the versions, but both are very good and Denzel Washington is terrific as is the rest of the cast.  Enjoy the fog of paranoia!",1106265600,4,3572,4.729773462783172
2158426,3,B0006210ZG,"I was getting tugged on multiple sides when I decided to rate and review this film. First, and most obviously, was that I loved the original with Frank Sinatra. I think it was probably his defining role as an actor and was my personal favorite Sinatra movie. Second, I was worried that I might try and draw too many comparisons between this new film and its predecessor and thus end up hating this one. Third, I like Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep, and PRAYED that they didn't put these two excellent actors into roles that they either weren't made for or couldn't live up to.

So basically I stressed out over nothing. The movie was good. Not great, not the best of the year, but good enough to hold my attention and keep me up later than I normally would be.

The film: Denzel Washington takes on the role of Major Ben Marco (Sinatra's old Captain role), a desert storm officer who's come back from the war with terrible headaches, undecipherable dreams, and a member of his team who won the Congressional Medal of Honor.

Liev Schriber plays Raymond Shaw, the powerfully connected Sergeant who wins The Medal. He comes back to the States and is swept into politics. And he's being primed for the vice presidency.

Meryl Streep plays Senator Eleanor Shaw, Raymond's hard-nosed mother who NEEDS to have her son in a position of power. The family name MUST be upheld and put into the history books. Mrs. Streep plays probably her most creepy role to date; I loved it. Her character infuriated me one moment, and then made my stomach turn the next. A perfect performance.

Instead of Manchuria being involved, this time we have something known as Manchurian Global, a company that wants to rule the most powerful nation on Earth by controlling one of its most powerful leaders. But who's behind this global corporation? Does the military know? IS it the military?

Denzel pulls off a decent performance as the conflicted soldier who wants to do the right thing, but is hampered by what's ""inside his head"". His decline into near insanity is more like a landslide (i.e., felt rushed), and those around him can't hold a candle to his more adept acting abilities (with the exception of Mrs. Streep who practically stole the show).

Will I watch it again? Probably not.",1106265600,27,2268,4.697732997481109
2158427,5,B0006210ZG,"Well, the so called remake of Manchurian Candidate is not truly a remake. Oh sure, we still have a Captain/Major Bennett Marco (Denzel Washington) and the well connected Sgt. Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) but the story has been updated and modified. Yes it has the same premise (brainwashing)as the original and the conniving, unscrupulous mother/Senator, Eleanor Shaw (Meryl Streep) is still a central part of the story. But whether you want to compare the new version with the old or not, Manchurian Candidate 2004 is a pretty darned good, highly entertaining flick.

Captain, now Major Marco has never been quite right since he's returned from serving in Desert Storm, the original Iraqi war in 1991. Among other things he keeps experiencing recurring dreams, unsettling dreams - nightmares. You see, Captain Marco's patrol was ambushed by Iraqi soldiers backed by helicopters and the whole patrol, except for two casualties, was saved by the unassuming Sgt. Shaw who turned into a tiger and almost single handedly demolished the enemy and led surviving patrol members to safety, for which he received the Congressional Medal of Honor.

The problem is that Marco's dreams don't reflect what his memories do. In fact he's not even sure his memories do. It's just that when asked what happened he recites the same canned description word for word every time as do some other surviving members of the patrol, including Shaw himself. His dreams deal more with a captivity that never happened or did it? The patrol was missing for three days and in his dreams the two missing soldiers are murdered.

Things get even more complicated when Raymond Shaw, now a Congressman, is coerced by his ambitious mother, Eleanor, into running for Vice President, a position that we all know is a heartbeat away from the presidency.

Is Major Marco lucid or is he a paranoid delusional? Were the members of the patrol captured and brainwashed? Marco himself isn't sure until he discovers an electronic jelly bean style object just below the skin above his right shoulder blade. For Marco this is the smoking gun but can he make anyone else believe it?

CONCLUSION

The movie lasts 130 minutes but does not get tiresome. The direction by Jonathan Demme seemed to be very good and the actors playing the three main characters (Washington, Schreiber and Streep) acted their part to a tee. Obviously with the two movies being forty-two years apart some adjustments to the story were necessary. Other than the mother, the bad guys in this movie were a global conglomeration - Manchurian Global, hence the name Manchurian Candidate.

Manchurian Global was a shadowy nefarious corporation dealing in all sorts of legal weapon systems as well as outlawed items such as Chemical and Biological weapons and of course mind control. Other portions of the story, including the ending were handled differently and effectively as well.

All in all, I found The Manchurian Candidate suspenseful and enjoyable. I don't want to compare this film to the original academy award version released in 1962 because the film stands on its own very well and a comparison would only complicate things.",1106179200,,3157,5.0344827586206895
2158428,3,B0006210ZG,"The plot was terribly convoluted and some of the characters were not developed well at all.  This was not Denzel's best performance.  Somehow, the story did keep me interested for most of the movie.  I started getting bored towards the end.  Overall, it's a pretty bizarre movie that was OK.  Some scenes were unnecessarily violent too.  I probably could have found better use of those 2 hours of my life I spent watching this movie.",1106179200,,433,4.706666666666667
2158429,2,B0006210ZG,"As if we needed another Hollywood fiasco to prove once and for all that today's filmmakers shouldn't mess with a perfect and powerful movie classic. Yet they will anyway, and they did here. I can say only two things in the movie's defense, but even these aren't altogether positive things. It is nothing like the original in truth and Streiber makes a good Raymond Shaw. However, every character that mattered in the original is painfully underdeveloped, the plot is not clear or riveting, and the idea of torture and murder depicted by this movie will undoubtably turn your stomach. Being a former SERIOUS movie fanatic, I went into this new release believing that I was watching pure sacrelige, and felt guilty for a while, but after about an hour I realized that the new Hollywood is lacking that one thing that old Hollywood had so much of--direction. The film is rated R, and with good reason because of the violence, but the language isn't as strong as most war movies and the incestuous mother/son angle is almost as subtle as it was in the original. As a matter of fact, just watch the original and be thankful that we have that.",1105747200,,1137,4.661691542288557

Well Denzel does his part, but the storyline/plot was a joke to me. It made sense but it just wasn't good enough for great actors like Denzel and Meryl Streep. Towards the middle it all starts to get long winded and boring. I know that this isn't an action movie but I thought it was supposed to be a suspense type thriller or something like that. There wasn't much suspense for me; I could see almost everything coming a mile away, especially the cheap and corny ending where I was hoping to be rewarded for sitting through all the speeches about whatever.

2158442,4,B0006210ZG,"Jonathan Demme's remake of John Frankenheimer's classic political thriller still manages to retain the paranoia and suspense that made the original a masterpiece, only with a more disturbing and gut-wrenching update.

Gone are the Korean War and Red Scare (fear of communism for some of you) and inserted are the Gulf War and an evil corporation. Terrorism is minorly mentioned, but Demme's version doesn't go into that. Surely that's what all us Americans fear more than anything, right? An evil corporation (called Manchurian Global here) sounds like something right out of a James Bond flick. In other words, it's been done before, and it doesn't sound as scary as terrorists. But I guess it's because they had to figure out what the word ""Manchurian"" would stand for in this picture. But top secret corporations created for the sole purpose of manipulation by brain control to give someone one of the highest forms of power in this country is something quite terrifying. In this movie's case, that seat of power is the vice presidential role, while the brain-washed puppet will gradually work up the last few steps to gain the role of president. With technology rapidly advancing nowadays, this type of scenario is very quite possible.

Denzel takes the role of Ben Marco. Years after the Gulf War and the ambush his unit sustained which resulted in one of his men, Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber), to become a hero and win the Medal of Honor for saving his men, Marco has gotten dreams of the incident that says otherwise. Another man from his unit met Marco to discuss these dreams. Marco just shrugged it off and said he doesn't have those dreams. Unfortunately, in a later scene, we see Marco purchase No Doz pills (so he won't be able to sleep).

As for Raymond Shaw, he's a Senator and is now up for being a vice presidential candidate, all being pursued with the help of his mother, Elenor (played by Meryl Streep). She pushes her son to run for that particular position by any means necessary. Here, she attempts to become the villaness that made Angela Landsbury one of the greatest villans of all-time. Streep pulls off one hell of a performance and just about steals the movie from everyone else, including our hero Ben Marco. Manipulative, persuasive, and perhaps scary.

Soon, Denzel shifts into a somewhat different character. While still playing the ""good guy,"" he plays a very paranoid, nervous, and scared person. He one-ups Sinatra's performance by being more scared than ever, but the original Sinatra version was more determined and confident to uncover the truth and prevent a horrific event. Nevertheless, this is Denzel we're talking about. Naturally, he still pulls off a great performance. Liev Schreiber also does good, but this movie's version of Raymond Shaw isn't quite as memorable as Laurence Harvey's portrayal of Shaw. I think the main problem was that Shaw's character was underdeveloped here. In this movie, he's more of a puppet. Not much else. In the original, he was still a puppet, but he was still a human being that was lonely and hated his mother more than anything else. We felt sympathy there. Here, he's just blank and not much of a character.

Also gone is the hypnotic triggering that involved the Queen of Diamonds for Shaw. Here, the triggering is how the person's name is said. And instead of being complete robot-like, Shaw is... happy. But the movie's biggest flaw is the severe underdevelopment of Raymond Shaw's love interest, Jocelyn (played here by Vera Farminga). We aren't given much info on why Raymond loves her and why his mother forbade Raymond from ever seeing her again. Therefore, we don't feel sympathy for Raymond, and the reason why Raymond doesn't have much of a character. Although Jocelyn is in this movie, she's only tossed in for a minute or two.

Despite my rants of this movie, it does what it was supposed to do: keep the audienced thrilled and wondering what's to come next and most of all, how would it end. I swear, I was biting my finger and clenching my fist and teeth. I was in suspense most of the time, which is why I'm giving this 4 stars. The dream sequences are also a bit, dare I say, better than how the original depicted the dreams. The dreams were more haunting and disturbing here than in the original.

As Ben Marco grows more paranoid, so does the audience. One can wonder if such an evil corporation exists or will exist. One of those political conspiracies that enrage the paranoid American mind, like the JFK assassination, although that may be a bit too much and I think this movie isn't meant to be true like the original. This is just pure entertainment while the original prophecized the communists taking over America. In a review I've read on a different site, one critic said the original ""Manchurian Candidate"" inadvertently prophecized what would actually happen in Dallas of 1963. That is, the assassination was indeed a conspiracy, due to that movie. Who knows? Maybe Demme's version is predicting that a similar event could happen that was depicted in this movie. We can only ponder or simply shrug it off as being blasphemous.

Oh well, just watch the movie.",1105315200,5,5170,4.820744081172491
2158443,2,B0006210ZG,"I have a theory that G.W. Bush is a superhero and that his superpower is that he makes his enemies say and do really stupid things.  This movie is a case in point.

The original book and movie was a protest against the hysteria driven excesses of the McCarthy era.  It was clear that America's enemy, communism, was the enemy and the title derived from the state of Manchuria where a group of GIs were taken to be brainwashed by the Chinese communists.  This version protests the lack of sufficient hysteria to create the paranoia necessary to see America itself as the enemy.  For no reason other than the necessity of piggybacking on to a good movie, the primary villain of this movie is a Halliburton-like corporation named Manchuria that conspires with that focus of evil in the modern world, the US military.  While this is merely ridiculous, there is one truly troubling aspect of this movie.  Unlike the original movie in which the hero (anti-hero, pseudo-hero or whatever he was) is killed and vilified after his assassination of a candidate, this hero (and there is no doubt that he is the hero) receives the thanks of a grateful government and nation for the act of murdering a politician controlled by corporate interests.  This appears to me to be a dangerous idea given the campaign of hate waged against Bush in the 2004 election.  Luckily for the country, the world, and the Democrats, whose party might once and for all collapse if some Michael Moore or Democratic Underground inspired lunatic did assassinate Bush, this movie has been greeted with the mild ho hum that it so richly deserves.

I'll mention one other irony.  The candidate in question is a phony war hero running on his phony war record supported by his family wealth.  This description would seem to fit a certain real life Democratic candidate of recent vintage far better than it does the movie's obvious intended victim but I am sure they didn't know that back when they were writing this script.",1105228800,5,1982,4.746355685131196
2158444,1,B0006210ZG,"One has to wonder why re-makes are made of good movies.  The bad movies should be re-made to try to make them better.  Good movies are good, so why try to re-make them . . . I always enjoyed the Sinatra/Harvey original, which was crisp, credible, and where one can identify with the characters, and have feelings for them.  In this remake, there is very little, if anything or anyone that deserves empathy.  It is presented in a backdrop of doom.  Washington never smiles thoughout the movie and his character is so dark, one wonders how he can get up in the morning.  Raymond Shaw jockeys between a glad-handing and inciteful politician to a fruitcake, which makes him lose any credibility he might be fishing for.

The plot centers on a shadowy corporate entity controlling much of the industrial and military activity in the world and which seems to be run by a cadre of silent and mysterious automatons.  How they can get into and out of the minds of the protagonists is kept well into the shadows, with little explanation.  Who are they, what are they going to do with all the power that they are accumulating . . are they supposed to be an update of James Bond's SPECTOR?

Leiv Schreiber is also outstanding as the aspiring vice-president, giving a solid, emotional performance. As others have pointed out, Mery Streep is fabulous and steals almost every scene in which she appears.

Now about the story. Very involving, and to a certain degree, realistic. The film is a great government conspiracy yarn in the same vein of ""Enemy of State"" and ""Conspiracy Theory"". If you've read other reviews, you know what it's about, so I'll just tell you a little about the technology on which it is based

Brainwashing is a real tactic explored by the military in the late sixties and early seventies. It was called MK-ULTRA, and it was also experimented with by Hitler's administration around the time of WW2. Microchip implant technology also exists. Look up ""Digital Angel"" in any search engine. A family in Florida has already been implanted, with all their medical information stored in a bar-coded device the size of a grain of rice.

Could this technology be used for control of our daily lives? Could a president be placed into power simply to protect corporate interests and undermine freedoms of average Americans? Dunno.

2158447,4,B0006210ZG,"Having already seen the orignal ""The Manchurian Candidate"" with all its avant-guard, 1960s style cinematography, I really had to temper my criticism for this film remake.  The original is a landmark film, a timely incarnation more appropriate for release at the center of the Cold War when brainwashing soldiers and/or government officials was not met with as much cynical skepticism as it is today.  Having said that, this remake is actually a surprisingly professional creation with director Jonathan Demme at the helm.  His best work remains ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and he continues with his penchant for close-up full frame shots of peoples faces speaking directly into the camera as if the audience as a whole comprised the character being spoken to.  He is a good director but all directors have their trademark signatures.  The entire cast shows up this time around, as well, each and every performance adding both texture and believability to their roles.  If I am pressed to point out any singular performance here it has to be that of Meryl Streep.  I will place a significant wager that she will receive yet another Oscar nomination for her reprise of the now infamous Angela Lansbury performance of a conniving, power hungry, manipulative Arch Angel protectorate who will see her son reach the height of political power at any cost.  She has many outstanding moments.  But all the paranoid intrigue this story invokes is not all that amazing now at the heart of the Information Age as it was during the Cold War.  If you have not seen the original then this film might seem inspired, albeit sometimes incredible to entertain.  My advice is to compare the original version with the one here then buy the one you prefer.

The method is by implanting a device in the brain of the vice presidential candidate and by developing a plan that will result in the vice president assuming the office of the president.

When the original Manchurian Candidate movie was created, the movie was about communists who sought to influence the leader of the free world.  Today, in a world with Islamic terrorists posing the greatest threat, Hollywood felt that it would be wise to make a movie about the threat of corporate totaltarianism.  This is absurd.  There is no indication that corporations are a threat on our way of life whatsoever.  When Hollywood had a chance to talk about an important issue -- whether terrorists are seeking to influence national elections, as they had in Spain and the United States, the Hollywood elite is quiet.

The always obvious question is whether a particular remake is as good as the first one. I submit that the quesiton is not relevent. I think any film should stand or fall on it's own merits and if you are looking for an edge-of-the-seat thriller well folks this does qualify.

I am not in no way a Meryl Streep fan, but damn,  was her performance fantasic as was Schriebers, but none rose to the level of Washington's. Denzel took the part and ran with it. You could see the paranoia and confusion in his eyes and he communicated the fear, uncertaintly and the moments of revelation so well he didn't even need dialog in most cases. Bravo Denzel!

I though the film was well directed and well scripted. The plot could have been a bit tighter but in order to build suspense on this level it is often required to allow the uncertainty of the story line to invade the presentation. In fact it might be essential since the suspense part works so well in this movie. I though Demme did an excellent job laying it out.

Being a fan of the first movie - I have an old worn out copy on VHS - comparisions are inevitable. I felt thet any compromises and story line changes and up dates were appropriate to the aim of the producers. I like that they now have vehicle to show a wonderful story to a whole new generation or two in an updated  context that they can relate to.

John Voight was as always a welcome addtion to any cast and I am really beginning to really like Vera Farminga ( USA Network Touching Evil ) who played Voight's screen daughter as well as Shaws love interest or as close to love interest as can be in this kind of movie.

It was dark and frightening, and yes suspend some of the logic but also refelct on elements that don't seem to be relevant - they may be on second viewing.

********** Beware - the next paragraph could be a SPOILER *****

I saw one reviewer mentioned the Oedipal unertones of of Senator Prentiss-Shaws relationship with her son. I think that is an important point and key to fully understanding her motivations. With her husband dead suddenly befre he ever had a run at the White House Prentiss-Shaw tranferred that desire-obsession to her son along with a few other desires. Not irrelevant at all in my opinion. In fact I think it explains almost everything. Yes it is subtle, but subtle is often best. Watch it again and look at the non-verbal interaction between the Shaw and his mother. Subtle and intense at the same time.

Anyway for all that I though this film was a worthy remake although probably not as good as the original, but worthy indeed.

I recommend it to any thriller fan or fans wanting to introduce their children to the Mancurian Candidate without the ""But, he Chinese are our friends, they'd mever do that"", comments.",1104624000,2,3443,4.403149606299213
2158461,4,B0006210ZG,"""The Manchurian Candidate"" is a sleek, stylish thriller about power, politics and paranoia. It is a remake of a truly classic 1962 thriller, which was directed by John Frankenheimer and starred Frank Sinatra, Angela Lansbury, and Laurence Harvey.  While the new version is both scary and entertaining, the original is powerful enough to blow the viewer away.

The film starts in Kuwait in 1991 just before The Gulf War officially started. A US army patrol, led by Capt. Ben Marco [Denzel Washington] is attacked. Allegedly due to the heroism of Sgt. Raymond Shaw [Liev Schreiber], who receives the Medal of Honor, all but two members of the patrol are saved. The mysterious thing is that after the attack, three days elapse before another unit finally locates the `lost' patrol.

Fast forward to 2004. Sgt. Shaw, son of powerful US Senator Eleanor Shaw [Meryl Streep] is now a US Senator. Eleanor, the mother of all pushy mothers, sees Raymond as a candidate for Vice-President. Aided by her allies at Manchurian Corp., a huge multi-national company to which she has sold her soul, she can achieve this. Enter Capt. Marco, who has spent the last several years trying to figure out what happened in those `lost' days. Raymond is clueless. Eleanor has all the clues and more. Can Marco thwart a diabolic plot to overthrow our government?

The new version has an advantage over the original. It is far more likely that our nation will be taken over by giant corporations rather than by Communists, as the original foresaw.

The original triumphs because it is both a monument to great filmmaking and a product if its time. As horrific as 9/11 was, it can not compare to the fear of 1962, which was nuclear holocaust - the end of civilization as we know it. People today can not fathom what paranoia was back then.",1104624000,3,1810,4.788461538461538
2158462,2,B0006210ZG,"My Dad and I used to have this conversation. If you take some of the great plots of the last 40-50 years and use today's technology, liberal attutudes toward sex, violence and heck, reality, don't you come up with a better product? Look at Double Indemnity and then see Body Heat. Kathleen Turner just scorches Barbara Stanwyck. The answer is absolutely.

Yet we all know of some flops where great technology and acting couldn't carry the show. And this is certainly one of them.

First of all, Meryl streep is fantastic. You might have only expected that but still beautiful, powerful, manipulative, evil, sexy . . . she plays it to the hilt. And Denzel also does marvels with what he has to work with. Laurence Harvey was more sympathetic-creepy as Sergeant Raymond Shaw but Liev Shrieber does a credible job.

That's it. The plot is so convoluted that by the end, you have no idea of what's going on. Holy Cow it was an incredible (as in virtually unbelievable) story (Richard Condon) to begin with but Sinatra (I never thought I'd say this) and Harvey and Janet Leigh gave us a road to follow and we did. Here, by hour number 2, Meryl Streep's having conversations with people that I suppose I'm supposed to understand play a significant role but I can't figure out what it is. Or who they are. I thought they were Republican members of the Senate! And the Oedipal thing. Come on. A little over the top. Really pandering.

2158463,3,B0006210ZG,"""The Manchurian Candidate"" takes inspiration from both Richard Condon's novel and its memorable 1962 film adaptation. Screenwriters Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris have updated and rewritten this paranoid thriller for today's political climate. When Major Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) led a reconnaissance mission into Iraqi-controlled territory in 1991, his unit was attacked, two men lost, Marco was injured, and a Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) emerged a hero, after he fought off the enemy and guided his unit to safety. Over a decade later, Congressman Raymond Shaw is pursuing a very upwardly mobile political career at the urging of his controlling, ambitious mother, Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw (Meryl Streep). A visit from a former Desert Storm comrade causes Ben Marco to suspect that his frequent nightmares of brainwashing, torture, and murder may contain clues to what happened to him and his men all those years ago, as well as information vital to the integrity of our political system, considering that Raymond Shaw has just received a Vice Presidential nomination.

""The Manchurian Candidate""'s themes are powerful and provocative, but the narrative is so far-fetched that they don't hit home. That might also be said of the 1962 version of the story as well, but the emotional impact of these characters isn't enough to overwhelm the film's implausibility. There was no reason to make the technologies of mind manipulation so laughable or so prominent. The character of Raymond Shaw is kind of creepy and so unstable that he's not credible. A neuroscientist is introduced out of nowhere to help Ben, but he seems to exist in a vacuum for no other purpose. It's difficult to tell if all of this brainwashing was done to advance the cause of corporate ambition or political tyranny. Politics makes strange bedfellows, but demonizing two separate parties, neither of which would need to result to such tactics, is confusing if the film is trying to make a socio-political statement -which I think it is.

I have to compliment Meryl Streep's performance, though. Eleanor Prentiss Shaw is a thoroughly detestable individual whose self-possession and sharp tongue make her charismatic nonetheless...and easily the most interesting character in this film. She's an ambitious ideologue who will stop at nothing to see that her country conforms to her vision. Streep's performance reveals both the character's commitment and the dangers of her fanaticism. Streep claims to have modeled Eleanor Shaw's manner on a real person, whom I assume to be Senator Hilary Clinton. That is not to say that Senator Clinton is villainous, but that her career and disposition superficially resemble those of Shaw. The interesting thing is that the two women are on opposite sides of the political spectrum.

""The Manchurian Candidate"" is mostly fluff. It's a passable thriller that requires a little too much suspension of disbelief. Apart from that, its themes are poorly articulated. -Except in the character of Eleanor Shaw, the Senator from hell. Viewers will either love her or hate her. Or maybe both sides of the political spectrum will see an ugly reflection of themselves in her. Her ideals and her methods are insightful, provocative and perfectly realized by Meryl Streep.

The DVD: Bonus features include 2 featurettes, 5 deleted and extended scenes, 2 outtakes in which Eleanor Shaw is being interviewed by the press, a Liev Schreiber screen test, some discussion by amateur political pundits, and an audio commentary by director Jonathan Demme and co-screenwriter Daniel Pyne. ""The Enemy Within"" (15 minutes) is a making-of documentary that features interviews with the director, producers, writer, and cast in which they compare the film to the book and discuss the film's conception. ""The Cast of the Manchurian Candidate"" (12 minutes) explores the three main characters: Ben, Raymond, and Eleanor and includes interviews with the actors who play them. ""Liev Schreiber Screen Test"" (3 minutes) is the scene in which Raymond asks his mother to help Ben. ""Political Pundits"" (10 minutes) includes three conversations, each between two people, about a loose socio-political topic: Beau Sia and Roy Blunt, Jr. discuss voting in America. Fab 5 Freddy and Anna Deavere Smith discuss ""gangsterism"". And Sidney Lumet and Reno discuss American power and a disinterested electorate. The audio commentary by Jonathan Demme and Daniel Pyne addresses the decisions made in writing the script and in constructing the film. Demme and Pyne occasionally discuss the film's relationship to current events or give background information on the script, but the commentary is mostly about writing and directing. Subtitles are available in English and Spanish. Dubbing available in French.",1104537600,3,4787,5.328042328042328

Why remake one of the best Cold War thrillers ever?

Richard Condon's 1959 Cold War thriller, The Manchurian Candidate, posed brilliantly satirical ""what if"" questions bound to upset the left: What if an ineffective and bumbling anti-communist senator such as Joseph McCarthy was just one of many puppets under the direct control of the international communist conspiracy itself? What if the John Birch Society's worst nightmares weren't paranoid enough? What if the Red Chinese, the Soviets, and the North Koreans had access to truly effective brainwashing and were using it to take control of the United States?

From this brilliant novel was made one of the best Cold-War-era movies ever made, 1962's The Manchurian Candidate, adapted for the screen by George Axelrod, directed by John Frankenheimer, and with a brilliant cast led by Frank Sinatra in his best screen performance, Lawrence Harvey, Janet Leigh, and Angela Lansbury as one of the most chilling movie villains ever.

Now we come to the 2004 presidential election when this new version of The Manchurian Candidate was released.

Gone is totalitarian international communism as the enemy. Instead of brainwashing on captured American soldiers in communist Manchuria during the Korean War, we have a huge American company, the ""Manchurian Corporation,"" which is providing battlefield support services for the American Military. It's just a coincidence that during the 2004 election the left -- particularly Michael Moore in Fahrenheit 911 -- was trying to convince the American people that Halliburton was still being run by Vice President Cheney, and that Halliburton's profits were the ""real"" reason the United States invaded Iraq to depose the totalitarian dictator and sponsor of international terrorism, Saddam Hussein.

The plot of this new version of The Manchurian Candidate has almost nothing in common with Richard Condon's novel or the faithful 1962 screen version.

In this new version, Halliburton -- excuse me, the ""Manchurian Corporation"" is like the Borg in Star Trek, putting computer implants into the brains of American soldiers and politicians -- all the better to support the company's design to take over American foreign policy and send their mercenary army around the world.

You know, it would be funny if you didn't hear this sort of paranoia being taken seriously in leftwing media. To the left, conservatives and patriots never take their oaths to protect and defend the Constitution seriously, but have sworn Satanic oaths to their corporations and their bottom line.

Don't waste your money on this film, which not only is politically ridiculous but which contains incoherent storytelling, indifferent cinematography, and lackluster acting.

Flip to the original book and film in the Amazon.com catalog and buy them instead.",1104537600,12,2837,5.398190045248869
2158465,4,B0006210ZG,"When I first learned there would be a re-make of what may be my favorite movie I cringed.  I remember the horrors visited upon Cassevetes classic ""Gloria"" when Sharon Stone - missing every subtlety Gena Rowlands brought to the film - turned it into an almost drag queen performance.

Imagine my surprise when Jonathan Demme came up with enough clever new twists and turns to the original plot to make it an entirely different movie - variations on a theme if you will.

The performances are all strong with Meryl Streep sinking her teeth into a role that is as strong a female character as ever committed to the screen.  She's sensationally evil.  Denzel looks less glamorous and more believably gritty and insane as he tries to unravel the mystery of what happened to him and his army troupe during the first Gulf War.

Demme and company hold our interest throughout and couple of hours whiz right by, thoroughly entertaining and, at times, appropriately chilling.",1104364800,3,965,4.818181818181818
2158466,3,B0006210ZG,"I was very pleased with the acting, especially Streep's. She had the same cold-hearted creepiness that Lansbury brought to the original. I was a bit dissapointed by the storyline changes. The original managed to both play on our fears of the insidious nature of the communist threat while deftly lampooning McCarthyism. I feel that the modern version was a switch in it's political view, changing the enemy from the communists to the capitalists. It tried to ""balance"" this switch by taking a stab at the political left, albeit with a Hollywood rubber prop knife.

Another dissapointment was the much hoped for updated dream sequence, that just didn't deliver. The first time I watched the original I was blown away by those parts, and kept thinking: ""God, this couldn't have been made in '62!"" It REALLY was ahead of it's time. I hoped modern effects and the like would have created something equally ""trippy"" for our time. A good, enjoyable movie, possibly ruined by my pre-conceived notions.

2158469,5,B0006210ZG,"If you like movies about the big, bad corporate evil stalking innocent civilians and making unholy alliances to further their already outlandish power and profit, then you are going to love The Manchurian Candidate.

Ben Marco (the excellent Denzel Washington) was a Captain in a Gulf War incident, where his squad was attacked by the enemy and suffered two casualties.  The movie begins with him speaking to a troop of scouts about his Sergeant, Raymond Shaw (played expertly by Liev Schreiber) and how Shaw won the Medal Of Honor for his bravery in saving the squad.  Just outside this small meeting, Marco runs into Al Melvin, a disorientated squad member with a bizarre notebook containing sketches of his dreams.

Like a slow leak, Melvin's revelations incite the unraveling of Marco's mind also, who attempts to confront Shaw with his own dreams that mirror Melvin's.  But Raymond Shaw is running for Vice President, a position that his mother, Senator Ellie Shaw (brilliantly played by Meryl Streep) used her power to manipulate him into.  Shaw seems a little strange, a little bit robotic, and reluctant to speak with Marco.  He seems torn by a force that is hidden inside him.

Under all the political treachery lurks an enormous Corporation, Manchurian Global, contributing to both sides of the political dance but in fact backing a candidate they can completely control.  Ellie is obviously a tool of this conglomerate, but believes with pompous narcissism that she is always the one in control.  Running against her son's ticket to the white house is Senator Thomas Jordan (superbly played by Jon Voight), a man with enough power and experience in politics to thwart Ellie's plans for her son.

Time reveals secrets unraveled, brainwashing, mysterious co-incidences, and a nasty evil-doctor villain named Atticus Noyle.  Ben Marco is in a race for time against his own sanity, and the only one he can rely on is a new acquaintance named Rosie (played by talented Kimberly Elise, who also appeared in John Q. with Denzel).

You really must see the film, because nothing is what it seems to be, and at the pace that both discoveries and sanity unravel, it is truly a nail-biting experience.  Some of the scenes are a little disjointed, which in my opinion, follows the slide through Marco's mind.  There is a very bizarre dream sequence, and a very disturbing ""incest is best"" scene between Ellie and her son Raymond.

A little reminiscent of vast deregulation spree of the 1990's, The Manchurian Candidate takes corporate greed and takeover-hunger to new heights of insanely dubious behaviors, one that we hopefully won't see in our own non-fictional future.

Far outshining any other aspects of this movie is the absolutely spectacular performance of Meryl Streep as Ellie Shaw.  I thought she had reached her pinnacle when she made me laugh so hard in `She Devil', stealing the show from every other actress in it, but I would resolutely state that this is her finest performance to date.  She comes across as hard yet feminine, determined and demented, powerful and righteous.

Teamed up with such a successful actor as Denzel Washington, for me it was a no-miss simply from the performances of these two actors.  Liev Schreiber is fantastic in his portrayal of Raymond Shaw, reminiscent of a talented cross between Kevin Spacey and Kevin Pollak, very adept with facial expression and depicting emotion.  Jon Voight is phenomenal as Senator Thomas Jordan, and my hat is also off to character actors Miguel Ferrer and Bruno Ganz for their roles.

If you like intrigue, brainwashing, evil corporations, and sinister doctors and dreams, then you should like The Manchurian Candidate.  Enjoy!",1104192000,,3702,5.031147540983606

Take that same money, and buy the original, with Laurence Harvey, Frank Sinatra, and Angela Lansbury, which has now been re-released by MGM as a Special Edition. This newer version doesn't even come close to the suspense and intrigue generated by the original movie. This version is boring, convoluted, and devoid of any meaningful plot twists. I could go on and on about the original, however if you haven't seen it yet, I don't want to give away any of the plot twists of the original, so you'll just have to trust me, and go pick it up as soon as you can.

It's like comfort food for the eyes.  Remakes are a tricky business. Change the plot too much and you risk alienating fans of the original film. Don't change the plot enough and fans of the original will be bored. Meanwhile, those that DIDN""T see the original will wonder what all the fuss is about. Usually the result is a film that gets lost and that no one sees. Jonathan Demme's failed remake of ""Charade"" was a case in point of everything that can go wrong with a remake. Luckily, ""The Manchurian Candidate"" succeeds where that remake failed by touching on the themes of the original film, updating the story for a post-9/11 world and through careful casting. Although it's flawed, it's still a powerful film that will leave an impression with audiences. Hitchcock liked to point out that suspense thrillers aren't really designed to connect with common sense or answer all the questions we expect. That would be true of ""Silence Of The Lambs"" and also the remake of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" as well. Demme realizes, like Hitchcock, that suspense thrillers don't necessarily have to have the orderly clock work precise logic of a mystery. They have different purposes. The former is a mind puzzle the latter is just designed to keep you glued to your seat.

In the midst of the Gulf War a platoon of soldiers fight off an enemy advance with their Sgt. Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) fighting off the enemy alone while his commanding officer Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) is incapacitated . Or did he? It seems that members of Marco's platoon are having nightmares about what happened and these nightmares, which seem vividly real, suggest that something else entirely happened and that, in fact, Shaw killed one of their own and that this is some sort of weird plot to deceive the American public. Since Marco and others members of his troop appear to be suffering from Gulf War Syndrome and symptoms of paranoia, their observations are discounted until Marco discovers some troubling information

A number of interesting extras include the usual ""making of"" featurette. The best featurette is the one on the cast of the film. We get to hear the cast discuss their characters, their reasons for interest in a remake of a paranoid thriller/political satire. There's also deleted scenes (which help to clarify a couple of plot points but aren't essential) as well as the screen test that actor Liev Schreiber did with Meryl Streep for Demme prior to production. Schreiber clearly was the perfect candidate for the movie with his boyish good looks and undercurrent of vulnerability. There's also an option to watch the uncut faux news program hosted by Al Franken with optional commentary as well.

 Director Demme and co-screenwriter Pyne discuss not only the nuts and bolts of working on the movie but what their intensions (even if they don't always work and they'll admit it themselves first) were. Both clearly enjoy each other's company and compliment each other very well covering material that the other hadn't thought about.

An exceptionally good remake that updates this classic paranoid satire for contemporary audiences, ""The Manchurian Candidate"" brings Richard Condon's novel and John Frankenheimer's classic 1964 film to life with nice unique touches all its own. While Demme's decision to make the political satire more subtle is questionable (based on a lot of reviews here some folks missed that angle), Demme's sure hand and the script by Pyne and Gregarious provide the perfect canvas for the cast to express themselves. The outstanding cast manages to make their characters uniquely their own. If you're unsure of the film, I'd suggest renting it first and seeing if appeals to you.",1103673600,5,3863,4.97984496124031

The acting performances are very good from the entire cast particularly Streep as the evil scheming biotch and the movie is also shot well. The director does a good job in several scenes of zooming in on the actors' faces which really captures the state of the character or situation in a subtle way and adds to the feel of the movie.

 have chosen this BORING movie to participate in.

I have the original 1962 movie on dvd and it is superb.

If you watch the special features you will find out that the

director of the new version decided to totaly remove the key

elements that were in both the novel and the original movie.

These elements were what riveted you to your seats in the original. I can't tell you what they are because it would spoil the impact the first movie has. If you watch the special features,they inform you of some them in a way that doesn't

give them the real impact that they had in the movie.

There is no point in my telling you the plot,because others

have already done so.

What I suggest is,BUY and watch the older version FIRST,then rent the new version. If you aren't bored silly with the second

version after seeing the first then I will be VERY surprised.

The actors in the original ( Frank Sinatra,Angela Lansbury,

Lawrence Harvey ) along with the faithful to the novel script.will keep you glued to your seats. You won't want to take a bathroom break. If you are too young to know about the acting

careers of the actors in the original,all I can say is that they were considered top of the heap.

DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE !!! Rent it.

If you enjoy the first version,may I suggest that you see,

""The Boys From Brazil"",""Seven Days in May"",""The Holcroft

Covenant"" and "" Judgement At Nuremberg"".

I know that what I had to say wasn't a review of this movie,

all I can reiterate is see the original FIRST and rent the

Movies of this genre become a slam-dunk when peoples minds start translating it into todays worlds political arena. I did some guessing too. And after replacing Raymond Shaw by John Kerry i got really really scared. John Kerry is also a decorated Vietnam war hero, and, even more scary, his presidential candidacy was also based on his Military records. Then remember the overblown media coverage of the Swift Boat veterans and the counter part , Swift Boat veterans for Truth, it even gets more scarier.

What a smacking hit Jonathan Demme is holding in his hands. Adding the absolute amazing performance by Meryl Streep and Denzel Washington, you have a absolute winner, and a guaranteed audience with fiend and foe.

The outcome may distress a lot of people, but actually the outcome was very very friendly : The sleeper inside the White House and his evil Mom were shot, manchurian global had a very bad day on wall-street, but resumed business as usual, and a whole set of surveillance tapes were digitally adjusted. That last thing make me rolling on the floor, laughing. Its maybe Demme's wakeup call for people to watch a little beyond the length of their noses to see what's going on in Washington.",1102636800,2,1441,4.779116465863454
2158494,4,B0006210ZG,"This was a good movie. It kept my attention well, and I thought that Meryl Streep did an absolutely phenomenal job in her role. I've never been a fan of hers, but this really was a part she played impeccably.",1102550400,2,208,4.225
2158495,5,B0006210ZG,"Let's get this out of the way.  The original is one of the best films ever made.  It was creepy, foreboding, disturbing on political and emotional levels, and featured unassailable performances by very fine actors.  Normally, a classic that shouldn't be disturbed.

After the mess that was ""The Truth About Charlie"", I didn't want to see Demme's revision of ""The Manchurian Candidate"".  So glad I went against my instincts.

Not sure if the setting should be described as an alternate present or the not-so-distant future.  Corporate interests controlling politics, deepening poverty, corrupt career politicians, the subversion of privacy for the sake of national security and frequent terrorist attacks- our worst modern fears magnified.  Against this backdrop, Denzel Washington is trying to piece together what happened to him and his men during the first Gulf War.

Wasington is not the first actor who comes to mind to play Sinatra's role, but it works.  In the original, the audience just knew that Sinatra was telling the truth because Sinatra knew.  Here, Washington is edgy, twitchy and haunted- you get the feeling that he would almost rather be mentally ill than right.  Demme zooms in and magnifies Washington's natural intensity, and you may find yourself backing away as Washington speaks, as if he might touch you from the screen.  Here's hoping the Academy is watching.

Liv Schreiber as Raymond Shaw is excellent.  If Lawrence Harvey was twisted by his bitterness and desperate for release, Schreiber is haunted both by what could have been and what might be.  Demme shines a brighter, harsher light on Raymond's past.  Jocelyn, his high school sweetheart, isn't a tragic missed opportunity as she was in the original but a reminder of how isolated he has allowed himself to become.  Schreiber is more active in his redemption, but he's still very much Macbeth- unable to realize his power over his own ""fate"" until he's locked himself into it.

Meryl Streep blew me away, and I don't say that lightly.  I was prepared to roll my eyes at another Streep performance, but she was completely transparent in her role.  Though Angela Landsbury was excellent in the original, Streep is better if only because she has a more complicated part.  She's the creepy mother, privileged brahmin, backstabbing politician and conniving schemer all rolled into a flawless, seamless package.  She absolutely deserves a nod for Best Supporting Actress.

The other updates in the movie work.  Rosie isn't just a convenient talk-to here; now she has a reason to be on the screen.  A surreptitious Cold War double agent doesn't make sense now, but selling out the public for corporate patronage does.  And while the Gulf War may not make an audience twenty years in the future wince, who would have thought that the Cold War would push our buttons forty years later?

Demme, knowing that a lot of his audience will be fans of the original, included some winks in his version.  There is no Queen of Hearts, but there is a poker game; inexplicably, Washington decides to give his number ""the old-fashioned way"" a la the original.  However, he keeps the reminders to a minimum so the audience doesn't lose track of the movie they're watching.

Finally, every critic I read stated that the political party in question could have gone either way.  Maybe, but I think the prominence of Al Franken in two key scenes gives away what Demme was trying to say.

Nothing replaces the original version, but this update can easily stand on its own.",1102118400,4,3529,4.957410562180579
2158506,3,B0006210ZG,"Within the last ten years or so I saw the original 1962 version of The Manchurian Candidate on video.  I remember feeling tension and getting caught up in the plot.  I can't say that much for this newly released version.

The world is different than it was in 1962.  We're all jaded from the politics around us.  And we crave something more than a science fiction story that tries hard to include elements of modern politics.  For example, the threat now is really corporate greed rather than communism.  And there are references to recent incidents that seem right out of today's headlines as well as political speeches that can be attributed to a wide variety of real-life candidates.  I think that's what interrupted my involvement with the story line.  I was just so busy trying to figure out how it all applies to what is going on right now that I just couldn't get caught up in how the hocus pocus of implanted computer chips would impact a presidential election.

The actors all did a great job, especially Denzel Washington, cast as a former Gulf War officer who is trying to solve the mystery of his frequent nightmares and memories that don't seem to make sense.  Liev Schreiber was once a member of his patrol and has come home a war hero and is now running for the vice-presidency of the United States.  Schreiber's mother is Meryl Streep, an outspoken senator who will stop at nothing to get her son elected.  Much of the time, however, I had to struggle to follow the plot and, later, when I tried to put it all together, I found too many loose ends to make conclusion satisfying.

One of the problems with this film is that it tried too hard.  The modern politics didn't ring true, especially when we're surrounded every day with the real thing.  There was some sort of political statement hidden in the story that never came across as authentic.  And, in spite of good acting, I never cared about the characters.

I can't tell you not to bother with this film.  It might make you think about some of the horrors of corporate takeover of the world.  But this particular story is too convoluted to make that meaningful.  I therefore give this 2004 version of The Manchurian candidate no better than a lukewarm recommendation.",1100908800,,2239,4.6177215189873415
2158507,4,B0006210ZG,"Updated to contemporary times, ""The Manchurian Candidate"" opens with a sense of foreboding and unease, feelings effectively maintained throughout the film, during the days of Gulf War I as an Army platoon is ambushed in the Kuwaiti desert. Although two soldiers were killed in the firefight, the rest were led to safety by Sgt. Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber), including the platoon's leader, Major Bennett Marco (Denzel Washington). As a result, Shaw, the son of the esteemed Senator Eleanor Shaw (Meryl Streep), became a Medal of Honor winner and parlayed his heroism into a political career. Marco, on the other hand, spends his days giving speeches where he mindlessly recites the details of the firefight and spends his nights suffering from surreal nightmares that suggest that there might have been more to that fateful night than what he remembers.  Or what he thinks he remembers.

Political junkies will have a lot of fun with the jabs the film takes at the gullibility of the news' media and the buying and selling of whorish politicians.  From Saudi Arabia to John Kerry to Halliburton, the movie rarely stops to take a breath from drawing parallels between its fictional world and the world we reside in.  Sometimes it comes uncomfortably close, giving the film a sense of dread that will most likely only be noticed by the politically conscious.

Director Jonathan Demme does his best to keep the film entertaining for the apolitical with his snazziest directing since ""The Silence of the Lambs"".  The dream sequences are frenzied, distorted and disturbing.  Demme achieves the same sense of dread here as he did in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" with numerous flashbacks and nightmares just as in John Frankenheimer's original.

This film is blessed with an incredible cast.  Meryl Streep gives a truly creepy performance as Senator Eleanor Shaw, a virtual Hillary Clinton clone.  Liev Schreiber manages to be scary, frightened, threatening and vulnerable, all in the same scene.  Denzel Washington gives one of the most compelling performances of his career as Ben Marco.  Washington manages to hold his own against constant comparison to Frank Sinatra's portrayal of Marco in the original.  The fear Washington's Marco is feeling washes over the audience and kept everyone on the edge of their seats.

""The Manchurian Candidate"" is a smart contemporary film that takes familiar genre conventions and gives them a reasonably intelligent spin. True, it doesn't hold a candle to John Frankenheimer's original and it never comes close to approximating the boldness of the original film. However, it is a slick thriller that contains some first-rate performances and moves along quickly and efficiently.  Unlike ""The Stepford Wives"" remake, ""The Manchurian Candidate"" is a good film that can stand on its own two feet; a sign of a decent remake.  While it doesn't hold a candle to the original film, 50 years from now people will still be watching Frankenheimer's version, it doesn't do it any grave dishonor either.",1100390400,4,3022,5.124236252545825

Good earnest stuff from Johnathan Demme, but it just does not cut it when placed against the original version. There is too more gore and too many silly story lines for the whole thing to work.

On its own terms, the film works as a solid thriller, but the director is Johnathan Demme who is in the top class of thriller directors. We deserved better.

Meryl Streep, as Senator Mother, gives it everything and she may have carried the film, but it simply has too much baggage of its predecessor and no about of clever reworking or updating can shake it loose.

At the end of the day it is not a patch on the original.",1099526400,6,735,4.545454545454546
2158509,4,B0006210ZG,"Against the odds, the 2004 version of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" succeeds, mainly because it doesn't just try to remake the 1962 original.  Yet this isn't so much a bold re-imagining as thoughtful one - skillfully written, masterfully played, and wonderfully shot.  As you can always expect from Jonathan Demme, it's a beautifully crafted film.  If you've seen and admired the original, you won't be bored.  While the plots are similar they're far from identical, and Demme unfolds his with perfect smart-thriller timing and a contemporary narrative style, often deploying a highly economical use of images, voiceover and inter-cut scenes - an excellent device for delivering maximum information in the shortest possible time.  There's also a lot to enjoy in the performances.  Denzel Washington manages to be simultaneously charismatic and pathetic, perfectly capturing the essence of the damaged solider.  Meryl Streep is destined for her fourteenth Oscar nomination, and possibly a win for Best Supporting Actress.  While she doesn't deliver the same kind of desperate mania as Angela Lansbury's original (a performance Streep deliberately avoided seeing before the shoot), she manages to be equally creepy, mainly because her ruthless and cunning  character is so disturbingly familiar to any observer of politics.  The Oedipal bath scene is particularly chilling.  Overall, this is a satisfying film: not only a respectful remake, but a solid thriller in its own right.  And it's worth noting also, in what is surely the most wonderful irony, that forty years after the original movie the Red Menace has been replaced by capitalism's darkest and equally dangerous breed - the global military-industrial corporation, with designs on political power.  What isn't so funny is how close to reality it is.  Bush doesn't have a chip in his head, but he does have a piece in one ear and Dick Cheney in the other - which is probably somewhat worse.",1099180800,4,1945,5.252427184466019
2158510,4,B0006210ZG,"The Manchurian Candidate is an excellent remake of the 1962 classic starring Frank Sinatra, Angela Lansbury, and Laurence Harvey.  I didn't think the original movie could be remade, but director Jonathan Demme has succeeded.  During the Gulf War in Kuwait, Sergeant Raymond Shaw saves his squad during an ambush and receives a Congressional Medal of Honor for his bravery.  Twelve years later, he becomes the Vice Presidential candidate in the presidential elections.  His commander during the Gulf War, Maj. Bennet Marco, has been having flashbacks about what he thinks really happened during the ambush and in the days afterwards.  Marco begins to investigate his nigtmares, and finds a huge conspiracy invovling politicians, terrorists, and mulit-conglamorate corporations.  What makes this movie good is that it does not try to be an exact duplicate of the original.  The basic storyline is the same as the 1962 classic with little twists and turns throughout, especially the ending, that keeps the viewer interested. The 2004 version is an excellent movie that can stand on its own and is almost as good as the original.  Highly recommended.

  Denzel Washington is excellent, when isn't he?, as Major Bennet Marco, the Gulf War veteran trying to find out what really happened on that night in Kuwait.  Washington is very believable as a veteran struggling with post-war traumatic stress.  Meryl Streep plays Senator Eleanor Shaw, Raymond's mother, who has more than a few aces up her sleeve.  Watching her transformation as the plot reveals itself is creepy, although not as good as Angela Lansbury's performance.  Liev Schrieber stars as Congressman Raymond Shaw, the Vice Presidential Candidate who wants to believe what Marco tells him, but ultimately cannot.  Jon Voight also stars as rival senator Thomas Jordan, who Marco confides in.  The movie also stars Kimberly Elise, Ted Levine, Miguel Ferrer, Simon McBurney, and Bruno Ganz.

It's just easier to watch on the DVD and the theme is easier for me to relate to. Sure, the script could have packed more punch and pastiche (certainly our present world lends very well to notions of impeding danger, both on a national and corporate scale) but as it were, taken on its own merit, this is still a very taut thriller.

I saw the original version of this film before seeing the 2004 version. The new one is definitely an improvement.

The original was just odd. I think it's probably due to the fact that it was made many years before i was born and because 'communists' have never been my choice of boogeymen. And i mean really, Frank Sinatra? Wasn't he a singer or something?

In any event, i went to see this movie last week in a theatre and had a great time. It was paranoid, dark, and very well put together. The music was creepy and tense, the  acting was spectacular and the premise, despite what others have written in here, was believable enough in the context of the film to keep me interested.

What I liked:

The 'reality' of the film is a spoof of modern American politics. The party that Raymond Shaw is running for is not clearly identified and probably for a good reason: there really isn't much difference between Democrats and Republicans anymore, so take your pick.

The music was without any real melody, but was present throughout most of the film, adding soundscapes that enhanced the tense, paranoid feeling of the film.

Some people have commented that the premise of the film is really unbelievable. I don't unserstand. No one goes around attacking the Lord of the Rings for being 'unbelievable', but people enjoy it nonetheless. It's fantasy, folks, lighten up.

For me, the premise that a corporation has put a sleeper in the White House is a perfectly good one. Look at George W. Bush. And this stuff about electronic mind control implants? That's a bit hokey, but then again, the only mind control most politicians need is a printed little piece of paper called money. And corporations have lots of that.

So, the acting was great, i thought the story flowed well with some decent twists thrown in, and even though i saw the original film, i wasn't sure how it would end.

Worth a rental, definitely.",1096588800,4,2054,4.630853994490358

The plot involves former soldiers who have been brain washed during the Gulf War, but takes place in modern times.  One is a Congressman who is running as a vice presidential candidate and the other protagonist is an army officer who is being encouraged to retire due to post traumatic stress syndrome.

Both parts are ably played to perfection by Denzel Washington as the soldier and Liv Schreiber as the Congressman.  All, however, are over shadowed quite gracefully by the outstanding performance of Meryl Streep as a Senator who just happens to be the mother of the vice-presidential candidate.

The major theme of this fascinating story is power and control and how far some corrupted individuals will go to attain it.

I couldn't help but remember the roles originally played by Laurence Harvey and Frank Sinatra, but, as per usual the performance by Streep surpasses even that of the great Angela Langsbury in the same role.  Oscar nominations for Washington and Streep for sure.

2158525,5,B0006210ZG,"The original ""The Manchurian Candidate"" is one of my all-time favorite movies.  The movie has such a great story line, acting and ideas.  So when I heard that Hollywood was remaking a classic, I was very skeptical.  But now after seeing the new version, I am pleasantly surprised of how good of a job Johnathan Demme did with handling a classic.

This version takes place after the first Gulf War and I believe that the movie is in 2004.  Captain Bennett Marco (Denzel Washington) is having a re-occuring dream about what one of his fellow soldiers, Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber), did when they platoon had got ambushed during a battle.  Raymond Shaw, who has won a Medal of Honor for his actions in the Gulf War, gets into politics and gets put on a ticket as the Vice-Presidential candidate.  Capt. Marco's dreams becoming more clear to him and another former member of his platoon admits to him about having the same dream.  Capt. Marco comes to the realization that him and his fellow soldiers that were captured were all brain-washed and can still be controlled.  Now Capt. Marco's mission is to convince Raymond Shaw to undergo further testing and to find out who is controlling Raymond and himself.

This movie had many good things in it.  Great performances all around by Washington and Meryl Streep.  Streep will probably get an Oscar nomination for this performance.  Maybe Streep and Angela Lansbury will both be winnners of Oscars for playing the same character?  Liev Schreiber does a good job as Raymond Shaw.  Of course, this cast cannot be compared to the original that contained Frank Sinatra, Angela Lansbury and Laurence Harvey.

The story line in this movie was obviously updated from the original, but throughout, the main story and even some of the dialogue remained the same from the original.  The only problem that I had with this movie is that it may have been a little too long, but not too long that you lose interest in the movie.

2158526,4,B0006210ZG,"I was very, very impressed with this re-make of the classic
movie with F. Sinatra and A. Landesbury. I felt that the movie
makers did a very fine job making ""The Manchurian Candidate"" more
current in 21st century cicumstances, and using modern technology to
show the viewer what the people who run the world and control events
can really do, from the amazing surveilance devices to the
overpositioning of a fake assassin's video footage over that of
D. Washington's character (more on this below). The movie had a
great feel, eerie, suspenseful, and intense but not too much of
any of these, and it flowed well, with many surprises yet always
under control until the final scenes.

  I am definitely going to watch the original movie again for
comparison, but what I saw in this modern version (and do not
remember in the original) and appreciated so much was the
confirmation of ""conspiracy"" theories I've studied for years.
What I have learned from these studies is that there are many
factions behind the scenes, sometimes fighting each other, sometimes
strangely cooperating, yet the real ""enemy"" is the public, who are
fed very well-understood (by the controllers) symbols and archetypes
by the media, mere pablum for the masses, who neither have the time
nor the inclination to know the real stories, the deeper truths. The
conundrums of these multi-faceted, ever changing, behind-the-scenes
battles and compromises, explains why in the movie we aren't
sure why various factions of the ""intelligence"" organizations
cooperate at times when it would seem they would be fighting
each other.

  The performances were superb, except Ms. Streep's, and I say that
because even though she always delivers, what I saw in this movie
was her rejection of the devious, unscrupulous character she
played - not
surprising.",1093392000,,1814,5.070469798657718

But this is not one of those remakes that re-hashes the original.  Demme's ""Manchurian Candidate"" brings the original, screaming and fearful, into the current election year.

Jonathan Demme's movie remake of the  1950s film seems to take place almost inside its characters' heads; shot after shot is a tight, claustrophic close-up of his actors' faces.

Fortunately, Demme's whole cast is so gifted that even thoughts the characters can't express appear, broadcast, on their faces: the face of Major Bennett Marco (Denzel Washington) is a mass of tics barely held in place like a net by the thinest layer of military discipline; the face of Senator Shaw (Meryl Streep) is all control - except her eyes, which dart about like nervous goldfish, betraying her paranoia.

Although Streep turns in one of her strongest performances ever (which is saying a lot in my book), Denzel is her equal; these star turns are supported by Jon Voight and other standouts in much smaller parts. (There is one fellow who plays a doctor specializing in brainwashing who is so creepy I seem to have forgotten his name on purpose.  Maybe it was brainwashed out of me.)

Another point for which I liked it was the fact that the movie was constantly engaging. I think that this film will indeed move out of the shadow of the original and become a classic itself. I would most certainly like the Academy to consider this as a Best Picture nominee.",1093132800,3,672,4.516393442622951
2158529,4,B0006210ZG,"I have to give credit to screenwriters Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris for the way they played with the original 1962 screenplay by George Axelrod based on Richard Condon's novel ""The Manchurian Candidate.""  The original film is a classic and for all those who have seen it this 2004 version provides minor twists and turns for all of the major characters and plot points.  You know what is going to happen, but not exactly, so that Jonathan Demme's film works pretty much equally well for those who have seen the original and those who have not.

Of course, for those who have seen the original Denzel Washington plays the Frank Sinatra character (Captain Marco), Liev Schreiber the Laurence Harvey character (Raymond Shaw), Meryl Streep the Angela Landsbury character (Raymond's mother), and Kimberly Elise the character played by Janet Leigh.  Forty years down the road politics has changed enough that now Raymond's mom is not married to a U.S. Senator but one herself and Raymond is now the title character.  The ""Manchurians"" this time around are not Chinese Communists but a multi-national corporation, which actually makes the situation more realistic than the original (at least in terms of the villains).  Despite the appearance of liberal gadfly Al Franken as a television commentator, there really is nothing to really pin down which political party we are talking about here, which is fine, because it works either way.

On the eve of Desert Storm a reconnaissance mission is ambushed.  Most of the unit survives and Sergeant Raymond Shaw is awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for his actions.  When he returns to the United States he is elected a Congressman from New York and is pushed for the vice president spot on the party's ticket by his Senator mother.  But Marco and the other members of the unit have been having the strange dream and are becoming convinced that the story they have been repeating is not what really happened.  By the time Marco finds something under the skin on his back, it seems there is something at work here that is more serious than depression or Gulf War syndrome.  Could it all be some giant conspiracy?  Oh, you had better believe it.

One of the ironies of watching this version of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" this particular week is that as Raymond Shaw is suddenly put on the presidential ticket while there are media references to ""the Lost Patrol"" that he saved, there is no effort by the media to contact Marco or any of the other members of the unit.  This week everybody who ever stepped foot on a Swift Boat during the Vietnam War, whether they knew John Kerry or not, gets to be on television.  But Shaw the war hero has no contact with the men he supposedly saved and nobody in the media seems to notice because that would make playing out the game here a lot more difficult.  So we make allowances.

Washington's Marco does not get to be as heroic as Sinatra was in the original, not only because the script takes a slightly different tack but also because we have a different expectation today of what happens to people when their brains get messed with my mad scientists.  Schreiber does a nice job as the man who is caught in between who he is, who he wants to be, and who he remembers he was once upon a time.  I think that those who insist on seeing Hilary Clinton in Streep's performance are missing the point, because I see sure signs of the hyperbolic female talking heads on television news programs.  Pyne and Georgaris get special credit for fixing the major hole in the original film, which was why Janet Leigh takes up with Frank Sinatra (it always bugged me since it suggested it was setting up something but was not).

In case it is not clear, if you have not seen the original version of ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" then you should do so.  At this point you should probably wait until after you have seen this one and if for some reason you feel you should only see one version then it should definitely be the original, but it does belong on your must see list, even if it is in black & white and the Cold War means nothing to you.  For everyone who has seen both films, I definitely doubt that anyone will prefer the new to the old, but I also think that few viewers will consider this remake (or updated version) to be an insult to John Frankenheimer's original.",1093132800,18,4347,4.630208333333333

The high adaptability of politics to constantly changing times also means the 'new' ending does not detract from the enduring film message (which itself has not changed): Candidates which apparently seem too good to actually be true are likely fronting for another organization.

Such is true with Jonathan Demme's 2004 remake of John Frankenheimer's 1962 masterpiece THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE.  But while it can't really match the impact of the '62 original, it still scores in its own way.

This time instead of the Cold War, the setting is in the aftermath of the first Persian Gulf War.  Denzel Washington is Captain Bennett Marco (the role played by Frank Sinatra in 1962), who suspects that the man who saved him durng an ambush in the Iraqi desert in 1991 may have undergone brainwashing.  That man is Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber, in the role first played by Laurence Harvey), who is now a potential candidate for vice-president of the United States, all the while being fiercely manipulated by his calculating, cold-blooded mother (Meryl Streep, doing Angela Lansbury's role).  The villains in this film are not the Manchurian Chinese of the '62 original but a big-time corporation called Manchurian Global, who have implanted Harvey (and Washington, for that matter) with electronic devices that can force the subject to do the company's bidding...even if that means making one of them commit a political assassination to put a corporate lackey in the Oval Office.

Having three big pairs of shoes to fill, Washington, Harvey, and Streep do very fine work all the same, with some slight differences.  Demme indulges in many face-on shots (a stylistic trademark of his reminiscent of what he did on PHILADELPHIA and THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS), which is a bit irritating after a while, but otherwise his direction of the film is quite good, and he gets fine performances from his three leads, as well as Jon Voight in his role as a senator vying for the spot Havey wants and whom Streep hasn't the time of day for.  Veteran character actor Charles Napier and Demme's low-budget director/producer mentor Roger Corman also have cameos here.

Although the climax is a bit disappointing in comparison to the disturbing aura of the 1962 original, the 2004 version of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is a smart and cunning political thriller all its own, well worth seeing.",1092873600,4,2246,5.013440860215054
2158533,5,B0006210ZG,"if you're utterly clueless, you probably imagine that off-and-on for the past 2500 years there has been a life-or-death struggle between western notions of the primacy of individual choice and a variety of communitarian polities from the east determined to stamp out individualism.  if you're particularly dull, you might think that since 1940 or so, America has been, in the words of Polish-born writer Ted Morgan, the ""world's last best hope"" against economic totalitarianism (communism), racial totalitarianism (fascism), and now religious totalitarianism (Islamic fundamentalism).

but, as everyone who's anyone in the world of the arts or the life of the mind knows, the real ""enemy"" [sic] is ""rich people"" [sic], global capitalism, an assertive American patriotism, and, though it dare not be said aloud, the type of Christian who raises her hand and says, ""I'm a believer"".  in a word, Republicans.

fortunately, those of us who were still in the dark now have a remake of The Manchurian Candidate to clue us in as to who the ""enemy"" really is, and how this enemy goes about trying to steal away our democracy (such as it is).  it seems that a multinational corporation indistinguishable from Haliburton has hired a mad scientist (naturally, he's from South Africa) who uses the knowledge he gained making genetically modified tomatoes to implant microchips just beneath the skin of those whom the enemy would control.  how do these microchips do this?  no one knows -- except the mad scientist.  oh, and there's something about belly dancers with faces covered with tattoos who carry around red, white, and blue models of the human brain accompanied by weird music.  is that clear?  if it's not, you're obviously some kind of Republican.

but, the reason for going to see this movie is not for its coherence on the subjects of politics and science.  rather, it's to see how the supreme diva of all Hollywood, Meryl Streep (still drop-dead gorgeous at age 55), measures up to Angela Lansbury as the most over-the-top emotionally controlling mother in the history of cinema.  let's just say: if *that's* your reason for seeing this film, you won't be disappointed! see: [...]

it's also a pleasure to watch Denzel Washington as Major Marco (doing his best Colin Powell imitation), Kimberly Elise as a very believable heroine, and Liev Schreiber as a much more likable Raymond Shaw than the effete impudent snob that Laurence Harvey portrayed.  along with Ms. Streep, they should cop nominations for best actor and actress and best supporting actor and actress.  but, from the point of view of pure acting, no one deserves an Oscar more than Jeffrey Wright, as one of the hapless members of Marco's and Shaw's unit in Kuwait.

2158534,4,B0006210ZG,"It's inevitable that Jonathan Demme's new remake of the political thriller 'The Manchurian Candidate' will be compared to the 1962 original. But it's important to let the film stand on its own merits, of which it has quite a few. Even though the original came out WAY before my time, it's funny (in a scary way) how little things have changed. Fear and paranoria are still ever present and Demme's film plays greatly against our current political atmosphere. It centers on Ben Marco (Denzel Washington), a Gulf War soldier who was knocked unconscious during an ambush. His platoon is saved by the heroics of Raymond Shaw (Liev Schrieber), who single-handedly fights the enemy. Shaw is awarded the medal of honor for his deeds and the platoon returns home, save for two members who die in the battle. Years pass and we are reintroduced to Marco who is plagued by bizarre, horrifying dreams. I won't spoil what is included in them but suffice to say, they are frightening enough to keep him awake at night. Shaw has now become a surprise Vice Presidential candidate, mostly due to the drive of his hyper-ambitious mother Senator Shaw (Meyrl Streep). Marco believes he has uncovered a conspiracy involving their platoon and begins attempting to confront Shaw about it. Soon both of them must face up to the truth of what really happened during that ambush.

Demme has crafted a chilling and challenging look at our political society today. With Communism no longer as big a threat, he has updated the villian to a worldwide corporation called Manchurian Global, a change that works well. He uses a lot of extreme close-ups to heighten tension and give the audience a feeling of claustrophobic closeness. There's no escape here, nowhere else to look except at the faces of the talented cast Demme has assembled. And what a cast! Washington delves into his character's ticks and trademarks, much the way Russell Crowe did with Nash in 'A Beautiful Mind'. Streep does good work as usual as the mother you'd never want to have - she's evil, incestuous, and won't quit. And her physical resemblence to Hilary Clinton is undeniable. The actor who does the finest work though is definately Liev Schrieber. I really hope this turn finally makes a star out of him. He's been doing great work for years and this role is Oscar material. Shaw could have been mechanical and inhuman in the wrong hands, but Schrieber gives him a melancholy depth viewers can understand.

The film itself is one of the better I've seen so far this year. Though it unravels a little bit after the climax, for the most part it stays tightly constructed. It's intelligent, startling work. If you're at all interested, see it. Even if you're a fan of the original, this one still has surprises in store.",1092787200,7,2765,4.80672268907563

Just watching the scenes where the military are brainwashing the soldiers - is so frightening and scary. When I left the movie, I was saying to myself ""Now that was scary"". Just the Sci-fi elements added to the brainwashing techniques were amazing.

Meryl Streep gives an outstanding performance as the over-bearing political mother who will do anything to get her son elected to office. But I think at Oscar time Liev Schreiber will be on everyone's list. He certainley does an excellant job portraying the brainwashed political candidate. Denzel is also great as the military man who is the one that figures out the truth of what is going on.

It seemed practically blasphemous to take a movie as good, as shocking and as original as the Frankenheimer classic and turn it into some ""Charade""-into-""Truth About Charlie""-style mess.

But I was wrong. ""The Manchurian Candidate"" is Demme's best film since ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" and this remake still has the power to shock and impress, combining the same old twists with some startling new ones. Knowing the original as well as I do, I was still on the edge of my seat at the end of this one, and I left the theater thoroughly satisfied.

Denzel Washington turns the character Bennett Marco into an over-the-edge potential-psycho, making Marco far more colorful than Sinatra did in the original. And that move essentially shifts the main focus of the film from the once-main-character of Raymond Shaw onto Marco, allowing for all sorts of new twists.

Meryl Streep, taking on the Angela Lansbury role, also takes the original character into new directions, though she maintains Mrs. Shaw's innate, delicious viciousness.

There are some quality moments of UNEASINESS. Frightening scenes. Meryl Streep did an outstanding job filling Angela Landsbury's shoes. A terrible person. Not to mention, the movie did a fantastic job of portraying the realism in cutthroat, no mercy, do anything to win election poltics.

But then, the movie dropped right off the planet for me.

Everything was fine until, in order to get to the finishing point of the movie, two characters made decisions, based on conscious thought while under a hypnosis that couldn't be previously broken.

The premise remains basically the same: army guys captured in an ambush, brain-washed, one remembers the real incident while another is on the verge of making his shrewish mother powerful.  This time the enemy is not the communists, but rather big-business, which can support either Republicans or Democrats.  This film does not label the political party, much like the original, which is very good since the ""Manchurian"" Party can be any party in U.S. politics.

The ending has been changed since John Iselin's character has been completely omitted from the film, but at least the premise is the same: what if one of the candidates for the presidency was actually controlled by foreign or domestic powers?  If one man can be controlled by another, then why not all of mankind be likewise become puppets?

This is by far the second major contendor for Best Picture to come out this year, first being Kill Bill Vol. 2.

 ""The Manchurian Candidate"" is a difficult movie to remake and update and still make thrilling and relevant which is exactly what this one did and did quite well. Instead of the threat of communism, we have the all-too cozy alliance of politicians and multinational corporations (in this particular case, Manchurian Global).

 The acting was excellent. Denzel Washington plays the panicked Capt. Marco, Liev Schreiber is fantastic as Sgt. Raymond Shaw (he even looks like Laurence Harvey), and Meryl Streep steals the show as Raymond's evil mother.

 There are, however, some things which I disliked. First of all, Johnathan Demme implemented some images and extra blood and guts just to add to the shock value of the movie which was completely unnecessary (the Arab woman with her face tattooed holding the brain for instance...sort of laughable). Another thing was that the film was almost completely devoid of humor, which I found unbearable in some places. I understand that ""The Manchurian Candidate"" is not a comedy, but maybe a joke per hour just to lighten the mood?

Three days later, they are found alive - supposedly rescued by Raymond Shaw (Shreiber), a member of the convoy.  He is awarded a Congressional Medal of Honor, and thirteen years later his is running for vice-president.  But Marco is having nightmares about those three days; days that are blurry in his memory.

When he finds others in the convoy are also suffering from nightmares, his paranoia increases.

I have never seen the original, but this remake, from director Jonathan Demme, delivers a sufficient amount of mystery and intrigue to keep you on the edge of your seat almost until the credits roll.  My only complaint is that they attempted to deliver a type of ""happy ending"" to the film.  To some extent, it takes away from what has happened just before it.  That is all I can say without giving it away, but if you have seen the movie, you know what I mean.  Denzel Washington gives another excellent performance as the tormented Ben Marco.

2158570,2,B0006210ZG,"Alexander Payne's 'Election' is prime satire. Pick any of Hitchcock's films, and you have a great example of a thriller. Stanly Kubrick gave us all one of the most popular horror flicks ever with 'The Shining.' But while director Jonathan Demme attempts to mesh these three genres into one of the best films of the year, he misses the mark and turns out an uneven mess of a paranoia movie.

'Candidate' takes place in present day America, but it starts in the early '90s when the Gulf War was still on the front page of every newspaper everyday. The prologue focuses on a small troop of men in the U.S. Army, two of which are Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) and Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber), the central characters in this political thriller. When the group is ambushed in the middle of the night, two troops are killed, and the rest are knocked unconscious with the exception of Shaw, who shoots down an entire Iraqi attack squad, eventually winning him the Congressional Medal of Honor and the title of War Hero. After this slightly uneven, if involving opening, the film jumps to modern day where Raymond Shaw is suddenly pushed into a Vice President nomination by his dangerously ambitious mother, Eleanor Shaw (a fierce Meryl Streep), while members of his former Gulf War troop, including Marco, are having haunting dreams that tell a different story of what happened that past Iraqi night than what everyone had come out of the situation believing had occurred, no doubts at all. This offers an intriguing thriller full of conspiracy theories and brain-washing that, at times, feels overwhelming.

Throughout the film, you can tell that director Jonathan Demme and his cast and crew attempted to create a biting political satire. Unfortunately, this goal is overshadowed by the stronger desire to thrill, scare, disturb and shock. Despite some recurring attempts, not much of it comes across as shocking or scary; in fact, there is such an obvious lack of edge that even the thrill factor falls flat on its face. Unfortunately for Demme, there is too much to disturb the audience; a cornucopia of stomach-turning dreams and a seemingly random scene of incest that nearly destroys Demme's credibility (you feel as if he went too far in his obsession with this ""shock-factor"").

The excitement in 'Candidate' all falls on the shoulders of the superb and engrossing Streep. She is the satire, she is the evil, she is the shock, she is a central disturbance, thus ruining the film's possibility of being entirely well-rounded. She encompasses everything the film lacks: for that, I'd give her an Oscar nomination; it proves she can do anything, even save a film from being complete cinematic dreck. Unfortunately, she is, at times, over-the-top. I can't see her making my own personal shortlist. But overall, you knew she was having the time of her life. Also notable is Liev Schreiber, whose mechanical persona works quite well for his character who is under so many forms of emotional and psychological control that a sense of drained mortality feels hauntingly realistic. Even Kimberly Elise was somewhat memorable as an early companion of Ben Marco. All in all, the cast did very well, but it was Denzel Washington who direly disappointed.

The character of Ben Marco is one with hundreds of layers. What Washington did was flatten him out and add a few irritating mannerisms to defyingly set apart this performance from any other performance he had given in the past. Put on a confused face, and you have his version of Ben Marco. There were even parts of the film in which Washington was inexplicably happy and, dare I say normal; not one sign of trouble. I walked out of that film angry at Washington. He ruined what could have been a chance to give America a memorable tour-de-force.

Even Demme disappoints. I have not seen the original 'Candidate,' made in 1962 with Frank Sinatra and Angela Lansbury. But I have seen Demme's masterpiece, 'The Silence of the Lambs,' and all I see isn't his return to fine cinema, but a regurgitation of thrill formulas and an unsuccessful ambition to create another disturbing work of genius. What this version of 'Candidate' needed was edge and sophistication. What arrived to America on July 30th was yet another Hollywood version of something that could have been important to a modern society that desires a stronger artistic voice.",1091836800,2,4381,4.914864864864865
2158571,4,B0006210ZG,"Despite many initial detractors, director Jonathan Demme has delivered a brilliant remake of ""The Manchurian Candidate."" Based upon the 1962 classic directed by John Frankenheimer, the movie has received a skillful updating that gives the already chilling story new relevance. The Korean War of the original has become the Gulf War, and instead of the Communists, we get the threat of an ominous global corporation.

Denzel Washington plays Major Bennett Marco, a soldier who is being driven to the brink of madness by his nightmares about one fateful night in Iraq. The official story is that Raymond Shaw (Liev Schrieber) saved his entire troop from an enemy attack, thus earning the medal of honor. Raymond has since become a senator and is being groomed fro Vice President of the United States. Marco thinks there are darker origins to Raymond's rise to power, and he starts to unearth a terrifying political plot involving mind control and murder.

Washington is used to playing strong, heroic characters, and he gives a refreshing performance. His Marco is always on the verge of going to pieces, never knowing if he has lost his sanity or if he is truly onto a secret plot. It is a very commanding, focused performance.

Meryl Streep has the uneviable task of living of to Angela Lansbury's legendarily evil performance in the original ""Manchurian Candidate,"" which earned Lansbury an Oscar nomination. Streep deserves the same for her work here, and perhaps more. An actress of lesser talent may have tried to copy Lansbury and fail, but Streep makes the part her own. Her Eleanor Prentiss Shaw is a dangerously ruthless woman with unstoppable political ambition. Eleanor is determined to put her son in the Oval Office and she manipulates everyone in sight to get her way. Eleanor is frightening because she downplays her power to the point of being comedic, then unleashes it with icy ferocity. Streep is best in these moments, and in the quiet, Oedipully charged scenes with Raymond, when she tenderly explains to him her motivations.

A sadly underrated actor, Liev Schrieber gives an impressive performance here. I have admired him since seeing his work in Michael Almeryeda's 2001 ""Hamlet,"" where he easily outshone co-stars Ethan Hawke, Julia Stiles, and Bill Murray. Schrieber makes Raymond the complex character he should be, and in the end he breaks your heart. Raymond is at once a charasmatic politician and a frightened boy who is terrified by the thought that he may be nothing more than a puppet.

The only qualm I have with ""The Manchurian Candidate"" is the ending. Demme and company elect for a slightly ludicrous happy ending instead of the darker one that the story cries out for. Perhaps in our current political climate such an ending isn't bankable, but it should be. As it is, it is a fairly large weak point in a remake with surprisingly few.",1091836800,2,2874,4.954356846473029
2158572,3,B0006210ZG,"When Major Marco (Denzel Washington) begins backtracking into the dim recesses of his mind that may have been tampered with by a global conglomerate, he finds that there is some solid truism to the movie cliche: ""You know you are not paranoid when they really are out to kill you."" A decade earlier, he and a congressman's son, Sgt. Shaw (Liev Schrieber) fight a winning battle with Iraqi insurgents with Shaw winning a medal for bravery.  At least that is the official army version. What happens from this point is a series of logical flaws that undercut the otherwise fine acting of Washington, Schrieber, and Meryl Streep in an over the top Hillary Clinton rant as the power hungry mother of Shaw.

Marco believes that his entire patrol has been brainwashed for reasons that do not become clear until the film's close. What director Jonathan Demme tries mightily to do is to capture the relentless pressure that director John Frankenheimer managed to generate in the 1962 version of the original.  In this version, the focus was on the clash between a satirical poke at the political left and right that feared a communist was hiding under every bed. In the newer version, Demme substitutes a military-industrial conspiracy hodge-podge that replaces a red under each bed with a microchip in each cranium. The problem with such theories is that audience credibility  concerning the validity of the secrecy of such an all powerful group is strained when the number of conspirators exceeds the number of those killed by those same conspirators. Further muddying the plot is an odd Oedipal subtext concerning Streep and her film son Schrieber.  When a far too attractive and youngish Streep gets down on her knees in front of her semi-nude son and plants a non-motherly kiss on his lips, one shouts out: ""Relevancy!""

What is supposed to emerge from Demme's reworking of the Frankenheimer original is a cautionary tale about the dangers of allowing a shadow government to call the shots in deciding a nation's political destiny.  What actually does emerge is a pseudo-thriller that instead points to the need for current script writers to remember what passed for true suspense in the first place.",1091836800,18,2196,4.951086956521739

Now, the trajectory in question is not so different than the original, but the tone of this version is so somber, so serious, so heavy, that you can't abandon the need for gritty, realistic answers halfway through the film.  The original Manchurian Candidate didn't take itself half as seriously, and that's why it succeeded where this version fails.

A couple of notes:  Meryl Streep is channelling Hillary Clinton (her denials notwithstanding), and Denzel Washington obviously watched a bunch of Pacino films before settling on this character.",1091750400,,1043,5.178571428571429

  First of all Denzel Washington and Jon Voight are excellent actors and always interesting to watch in their various roles.

  There are two ways to approach a remake. Either you stick to the original format and concept or you better come up with something original. As an example of the former you have ""12 Angry Men"" and of the latter ""Ocean's 11"". Both well done. Mr. Demme has done neither. A confused storyline supported by a bad script. Ridiculous sets. Photography, color enhanced with a multitude of annoying closeups and handhelds. A dull somewhat oblivious supporting cast with no depth. Consider the original ""trigger mechanism"" of the Queen of Diamonds being replaced by the man's name and rank. Nothing to replace the hilarious ""57 varieties"" routine or the Central Park accident. Meryl Steep is a dead ringer for Hillary Clinton but cannot begin to approach the shrewishly manipulative Angela Lansbury. And last but not least the final shot, where Sinatra was superb in a quick snap to black, replaced with a baldheaded Denzel washing away past sins in some ""Sea of Jordan"" while loitering onlookers seem to have discovered another ""Stonehenge"". PLEASE.

  All in all you have to place blame on the Director. So, Mr Demme, the next time you consider undertaking the re-making of a classic film why don't you try passing the time by playing a little solitaire.....",1091750400,7,1416,4.991489361702127

This is the only time in my experience that the re-make of a movie has surpassed the original classic. Superb acting by Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep--Of course!",1091664000,,314,4.90566037735849
2158577,2,B0006210ZG,"What a shame. the new version needn't have tried to ""copy"" the original but why, oh, why did they strip the story of it's emotional impact. Raymond's hatred of his mother was watered down to nothing. Raymond's relationship with Jocelyn was mimized to the point where her demise was more of an afterthought. The current version lacked humor. Ben's patriotism was eliminated. the antagonist was sketchy and indistinct. the character of Raymond's stepfather was eliminated. The emotional core of the story is a tragedy with echoes of Hamlet from which Condon obviously lifted part of his premise. Demme seemed to end scenes 30 seconds to early, just when the characters were about to develop. None of the character's developed, particularly Raymond. Enough said. At least the new version has drawn peoiple to the old version, a true classic",1091577600,3,837,5.072463768115942
2158578,4,B0006210ZG,"Why remake The Manchurian Candidate?  The original is perfect.  Meryl Steep and Denzel Washington are great, but how can you replace Angela Lansbury and Frank Sinatra?  Jonathan Demme is one of my favorite directors, but lately he's only doing remakes of superior films (he remade Charade as The Trouble with Charlie).

That being said, The Manchurian Candidate is about as good a remake as could have been hoped for.  On the downside, we all know the key plot point.  However, the story itself is so good, so timeless, and so TIMELY, that it seems new.  There are several key differences between this version and the original that mark the passage of time.  The character of the Mother need no longer be relegated to a senator's wife - she is a senator herself (thereby completely doing away with the need for the Johnny Iselin [Joe McCarthy] character).  The methods of brainwashing in this film are more sophisticated but, unfortunately, they have done away with the game of solitaire.

Perhaps the biggest challenge for the filmmakers was the title itself.  In this film, to mark the changing times, it is evil corporations and not communists that are trying to take over America.  The evil corporation is Manchurian Global (get it?).

I have to say that some of plot points in the newer version make more sense than the original.  The original Raymond Shaw was just an assassin; there are enough willing assassins in the world, unfortunately - they don't need to brainwash anybody.  In this film, Raymond Shaw IS the Manchurian Candidate.  The good people at Manchurian Global make sure that their time with Ben Marco isn't wasted either.

In the end, this is a good movie - another variation on theme.  You can watch it and enjoy it, but it will never replace the original.",1091577600,3,1779,4.796052631578948
2158579,4,B0006210ZG,"As a stand-alone film, the ""re-visitation"" of Frankenheimer's 1962 classic is quite good. Washington, Shrieber, and Streep acquit themselves admirably in roles previously covered by Sinatra, Harvey, and Lansbury. Kimberly Elise does well in the tremendously altered role of ""Rosie"", originally assayed by Janet Leigh. And Jeffrey Wright is on screen briefly, but memorably, as a soldier tormented by the same nightmares that plague Washington and Shrieber.

 The different elements of plot between the two films are reflective of the times in which they were produced. Demme continues to use his technique of having the actors speak directly into the camera. This adds an eerie touch to the presentation, making the viewer feel as though he is part of the action.

 There are a few slow passages and the convention hall sequence near the film's end seems protracted.

 I saw the film with a mixed group, half appearing to have seen the original while the others were totally alien to the classic. The latter had no frame of reference and could possibly appreciate the newer version better.

 As an owner of the Sinatra film, I found myself comparing and contrasting the two. This may have resulted in my giving the newer movie less than five stars.

 Lansbury as the first ""Mrs. Shaw"", along with James Gregory as her befuddled Senator husband, were just too awesome and memorable to erase from my brain.",1091491200,6,1404,5.012931034482759
2158590,3,B0006210ZG,"Having never seen the first, I can't possibly compare the two. After seeing this one, I would like to watch the first and see if it's any better. To be honest, I thought this film was just plain bad. The acting was great, but the plot was full of gaping holes and preposterous devices.

 Basic story is, Capt. Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) and his men were in Iraq when they were ambushed and Sgt. Raymond Shaw (Liev Shrieber) saves the day and gets a Medal of Honor. Fifteen years later, Marco runs in to one of the men he was with that day, and the guy is having horrible nightmares about what happened that day which lead Marco to investigate as he has the same dreams/nightmares. He eventually leads himself to believe that some evil Haliburton-like corporation (Manchurian Global) implanted him and his men with mind control devices and brainwashed them into believing Sgt. Shaw saved the day. Shaw is now a politician and getting ready to be named as the Vice Presidential candidate under the watchful eye of his Senator mother (Meryl Streep). The premise is that the evil corporation has total control of Shaw and is using him to benefit themselves politically/financially and control the United States.

 I did think the acting was wonderful - Meryl Streep was especially good as the creepy and controlling mother, but Denzel Washington and Liev Shrieber were equally good in their roles. They can't help the shoddy script and did the best they could with what they had. Supporting cast was also excellent.

 My big problems with the movie were the unexplained plot devices and gaping holes in the story. They show Ben Marco in the grocery store buying No-Doz, Cup o'Noodles and smutty romance novels. Ok, they kinda explain the No-Doz and noodles, but they never explain the romance novels. How many 40-something military men do you know that read romance novels? The market is primarily women and if it was supposed to be significant, it was never properly explained. If it wasn't significant, well... it was just weird for the sake of being weird and made no sense. Another problem was the ending, which I can't go into detail as I don't want to give it away... but suffice to say, they do not explain why the characters are acting the way they do.

 Also, I get really annoyed seeing big technical errors in movies, especially when I KNOW the people who make movies know better. The only reason I can think of that they still do it is because they believe the audience to be too stupid to know the difference. Prime example...at one point they are modifying a videotape to make it look like someone else was on it instead of Marco. They basically take one frame of the video and using a MS Paint-like eraser, somehow wave a little cursor over Marco and he turns into a white guy. This then turns him in to a white guy on the entire videotape, like it's that easy to do. Total garbage and well, it drives me nuts.

 Despite the bad plot, the movie was entertaining. Unfortunately, it wasn't very suspenseful as they give away all the plot twists long before the actual ""twist"" is supposed to happen. Even so, I'll give it 3 stars for actors only. If I based this on plot alone, it would get 1.",1091491200,2,3204,4.605263157894737
2158591,5,B0006210ZG,"People will have different reactions to this movie, often based on their love for the first one.  I will admit to loving the first one and, if pushed, will also admit to prefering the first one.  But Jonathan Demme's Manchurian Candidate is an effective thriller in its own right, heightened by brilliant performances.  Meryl Streep easily wolves down the scenery when not chewing on ice (a very nice touch) and is equal to the chilling portrayal of this character first created by Angela Lansbury.  It is wonderful to see this actress open herself up so wide and throw in every stylistic trick in her repertoire in her portrait of evil ambition and spooky mother love.  Liev Schrieber is perfect as her son.  Denzel Washington has the toughest acting job and come through admirably.  As one of the sanest seeming actors working, playing somewhat paranoid-crazy is not one of his strengths but his performance grew on me.  This is a wonderfully paranoid thriller that can seem relevent, to either side, or mere escapist, and works on all of these levels.",1091491200,3,1054,4.849162011173185
2158592,3,B0006210ZG,"MOVIE: If you were to go to The American Film Institute's website you would see that the original Manchurian Candidate sits at number 67 for the best 100 movies in the last 100 years. The only question that strikes me here is why fix something if it's not broken? The original is a political thriller about the communism scare during the Cold War. The reason it's a classic is that the movie's plot delt with the possibilty that an outside evil could be controlling us, and the film also was telling the audience that communism is a government that will hypnotize you and your life, it was a message from the film makers. This new version uses the same idea of ""control"" except that instead of pointing at communism it's pointing at the idea that we live in a corrupt world, that our government is corrupt. Okay. . .I'm pretty sure that idea has been presented before, and in reality our government is corrupt in some ways and we know that. The movie does show us an almost fictional way of how the government is being controlled and that can raise questions like ""does the executive branch really have the most power or are they influenced enormously by others?"" While the answer to that question may be simple it also may be complex. The problem with the movie here is that the issues raised in the movie are way too fictional and far out to have any reference to our daily lives. Microchips implanted in our nation's leaders' brains is something that someone would say ""yeah right!"" to. The original delt with communism, a very real threat at the time. While the new modern version has the similar formula of the original movie, the main ingredient has been changed and the flavor just doesn't seem right.

 ACTING: This is a movie where if they had mediocre actors then the movie would have been considered an insult to John Frankenheimer. Denzel Washington gives a very convincing performance and it adds to the effect of the movie. Meryl Streep pulls off the role of the evil mother, but I still find Angela Lansbury's performance much better. The acting was top notch overall and all that emotion was needed to keep the audience entertained. Jonathan Demme also added to the tense atmosphere by using a lot of close-ups for character shots. Everytime an actor is delivering an emotional line the camera is always focused with the chin at the bottom of the screen and the top of the head at the top of the screen. This forces the audience to focus in the actors' eyes to really get the emotion, but just the fact of having to force emotion to the audience shows that remaking a classic wasn't easy.

 BOTTOM LINE: What if someone said that Hollywood was going to remake Casablanca, Lawrence of Arabia, or Ben-Hur . . . exactly! This modern version is no match for the original classic, and even though the original may have lost its touch due to the passing of communistic fears it still holds the values that make it way better than this modern tale.",1091404800,,2957,4.584120982986767
2158593,4,B0006210ZG,"The first half of the movie is suspenseful and feels rather mysterious, especially for me who haven't seen the original. Guided by assured direction, the first half of the movie generates an effective anticipating atmosphere that leads the audience into believing that something really exciting and dramatic is waiting to happen. It offers such a strong sense of promising possibility that I was almost literally licking my lips eagerly looking out for the next twist and turn in the movie.

 Quite disappointingly though, the second half of the movie does not entirely live up to the expectation created earlier. The believability of the story appears to be undermined by the rather inconsistent behaviors of the ""manchurian candidate"" Raymond, who sometimes is portrayed as a total thoughtless puppet while other times we see him determined to fight for his own identity. A bit more acute description of Raymond's inner struggles and psychological journey leading him to come to terms with his destiny would have undoubtedly given the movie more dimension and even more soul.

 The premise doesn't appear to be totally convincing. If someone has the control of a technology so powerful that he could control others' mind, he doesn't seem to have to resort to such an indirect plan to get more business from the government. That said, this modified story that has the ""plan"" involve not only the ""puppet"" but also the ""investigator/hero"" is clever. I believe, however, the way this detail of the plan is revealed could have been done better. Unfortunately the kind of sheer suspense the same director (Jonathan Demme) managed to craft in the climax of the more successful ""Silence of the Lamb"" is conspicuously missing in this movie's finale.

 The acting is superb, though. Meryl Streep, quite unsurprisingly given the quality of her performance in her other movies, injects into the movie a refreshing breath of life. Danzel Washington is solid as usual.

 Overall, the movie offers a decent amount of thrill and emotion stimulation, though maybe not nearly enough to make one feel compelled to call it an excellent movie.",1091404800,,2125,5.1037463976945245
2158594,3,B0006210ZG,"Meryl Streep is the kind of actress who impresses you no matter what she does, be it mediocre (she was the lone bright spot of Stuck on You) or masterful (she was a powerhouse in Angels in America), so I was kind of scratching my head a bit when I realized that Streep, reprising Angela Landsbury's notorious role in this remake of the 1962 political paranoia thriller, doesn't have much screen time. That's right, folks, one of the greatest living actresses on the face of God's green earth comes on breathing fire and brimstone in a great scene in the beginning, pontificating and pointing that slender finger like a knife...and then she kinda disappears for a while, letting the revamped plot of Candidate take hold.

 And as a plot, it's a little iffy. In 1962, the villains and instigators of a high-level plot to control politics were the commies and Laurence Harvey's Raymond Shaw was merely a noted war hero. Demme and his screenwriting team have made ""Korea"" into ""Gulf War,"" ""Commies"" into a corporation called ""Manchurian Global,"" and (*scratching head*) Raymond Shaw into a possible Vice Presidential candidate (???). I know Demme and his writers were trying to transfer the movie's pertinence into an area we recognize today, but the contrivances of its plot ever-so-slightly feel just like what they are: a director desperately trying to turn a remake into as much of his own as possible.

 Demme is a talented director, though, and he does keep the early scenes of the film charged with a looming paranoid feel that did have me feeling the vibes of the original. And homeboy can do a great close-up, too; those camera-up-your-nose shots Demme favored in Silence of the Lambs are nearly as effective here, especially in a scene where a psychologically damaged Gulf War buddy (Jeffrey Wright) comes to inform Major Bennett Marco (Denzel Washington) that he, too, has been having dreams that something else happened on a mysterious night overseas. These dreams that both have been having send the paranoid Marco on a quest to find out the real truth about Raymond Shaw (aptly played by Liev Schrieber), and that consumes most of the film.

 Problem is: it's not deliriously engrossing, like the original made it. Marco begins realizing he's right more and more, jumping through the loops of a prevalent conspiracy, and this just kind of goes on and on and on. As I said before, Meryl Streep's Eleanor Shaw disappears from the film, we never see anyone from Manchurian Global, and Kimberly Elise really botches her reprisal of the sultry Janet Leigh role (also changed, in its relation to the plot). Demme turns the movie on a kind of auto-pilot, fading out scenes in a hastily edited fashion, permitting Washington to stammer and yammer like he's posessed by Woody Allen, and even alters the emotional pull of the movie.

 I have no problem with a director trying to elicit emotion from his cast and building a scene fraught with it. But, in my opinion, characters in a political thriller should not cry. Case in point: a scene in which Marco and Shaw are together alone in a room. Shaw gives him more and more information about how he might be brainwashed, the ominous (and repetitive) score by Rachel Portman gets heavy in the back...and then Shaw elicits a single tear. WTF?

 But Liev Schrieber triumphs, despite that insipid little weeper of a moment. Denzel Washington, on the other hand, can't really escape the way the part has been written for him. In the (yes, I'm bringing it up again - that happens when you remake a classic) original film, Frank Sinatra's Bennett Marco was a strong man who was deeply disturbed by a dream he knew was right. Put in the present day, Washington's Marco never seems confident for one minute; in fact, he seems to be crushed by the very volition of the movie, and you should never crush Denzel Washington. Only if he decides to act like he did in Training Day.

 I think I know where they were going with the whole ""let's make Denzel a pussy"" deal. And that, friends, is this - botching the ending of The Manchurian Candidate like nobody's freaking business. If you've seen the original, you're likely to hang yourself with your underwear when you realize that Demme actually changes who does what in the film's climactic scene (I was ready to). More than that, though, I came to a realization that the grave misstep that the movie makes in that big scene, well, negates the entire purpose of The Manchurian Candidate in the first place. I want to run up to Jonathon Demme right now and scream, ""What in the hell were you thinking???"" It's that ridiculous.

 And it's kind of a shame. The Manchurian Candidate, had it stayed closer to both the plot and the emotional resonance of its predecessor, could have been a gripping yarn that succeeded on technical, narrative, and character levels. Demme's movie has altered all three, and he comes up a little short in each case, which is kind of a bummer for such a great cast (Meryl Freaking Streep!) and such haunting material. The movie has its moments (I sure liked seeing Bruno Ganz from Wings of Desire, but that's just me) since it's well-photographed and occasionally suspenseful, but in the end I still can't see any point in its existence. Denzel, Meryl, Liev, and Demme could have all made great, original contributions to film instead of this unneeded remake. All this movie does is reminds you how much of a masterpiece the original was. GRADE: C+",1091404800,3,5459,4.7690677966101696
2158595,3,B0006210ZG,"Jonathan Demme's remake of the 1962 classic Cold War political satire, ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" features Denzel Washington as Ben Marco, an army officer who served in the Gulf War. Now living in squalor many years later, Marco subsists on a diet of noodles and No-Doz. He is tormented by incomprehensible dreams from his last days in Kuwait. When a soldier who served in the army with Ben approaches him with stories of his own weird dreams and disturbing memories, Ben blows the tormented man off with platitudes. However, in his heart, Ben believes that someone messed with his and other soldiers' minds back in 1991.

 Denzel Washington is perfectly cast as a man of integrity and courage who embarks on a one-man crusade to expose a sinister plot that may have global consequences. Washington's intensity and anger make his character the most credible in the movie. Liev Schreiber plays Raymond Shaw, another of Ben's comrades from his old unit. Shaw won the Congressional Medal of Honor and came home a war hero. He is now taking the country by storm as a good looking and charismatic candidate for Vice President of the United States.

 Meryl Streep, alas, is way over the top as Senator Eleanor Shaw, Raymond's mother. She plays an ambitious, smothering, and manipulative woman with an unhealthy attachment to her son. Eleanor will do anything to get Raymond elected to high office and push her right-wing political agenda. Although occasionally amusingly smarmy, Streep is simply not credible as a female barracuda. Jon Voight, however, is convincing in a small role as a politician with a conscience.

 The script by Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris is heavy-handed, and the loud, intrusive, and pulsating music lets the viewer know whenever a menacing scene is coming up. Why remake a superb movie at all? The only reason would be if the filmmaker has something new to say, or believes that he can make a picture that is equal to or better than the original. Jonathan Demme's ""Manchurian Candidate,"" for all its timely references to terrorism and global conglomerates, is not equal to or better than the 1962 classic. Its only saving grace is Denzel Washington's memorable performance as an anguished soldier who is torn apart by forces that he cannot control.",1091318400,2,2271,4.963157894736842
2158596,5,B0006210ZG,"The newest version of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" has an almost insurmountable chasm to overcome what with the superior reputation of the 1960's version of this story staring it in it's proverbial face. And even though on most counts the new version equals or surpasses the aforementioned film, in one crucial point...it doesn't. And that one crucial point is in the performance of Meryl Streep.
 Now, there is no doubt that Streep is a National treasure and that she has given us many indelible performances but her Eleanor, is too mannered, so much of a ""performance,"" that she loses her character thread early on and her portrayal becomes caricature. Compare her Eleanor to Angela Lansbury's in the original: Lansbury is all motherly, Oedipal, crafty, intelligent, cunning, a ""real"" amoral snake willing to do anything to gain power.
 Updating the Richard Condon novel, director Demme and his writers have done an exceptional job of turning the red-scare, Cold War era of the early 60's into our post 9/11 times. The main theme remains intact, though: the underlying feeling and sense that our government is somehow, someway turning us into robots, playing with our minds or at least experimenting doing so. It's the ""1984,"" Big Brother is watching thing that is just as strong now as it was 40 years ago.
 Denzel Washington dominates this film in a performance that is the logical extension of his performance as the beat-down, lonely, alcoholic Creasy in ""Man on Fire."" In this film he has shaken off all remnants of his hero persona and dug as deep as he can go to his core: he's frightened, he's crazy and he's a man with a mission; a very potent cocktail of character traits.
 Unfortunately, a telling and shocking moment between Eleanor and her son Raymond (Liev Schreiber) has been cut since the preview that would have added much to the final form of the movie.

This film doesn't top the 1962 original, however, it stands on its own as an exciting political conspiracy thriller.

Denzel Washington plays a psychologically troubled 1991 Gulf War veteran.  One evening, his platoon was ambushed, resulting in a firefight.  Knocked unconscious, he still has a vivid memory of what happened.  One of his troops, Sgt Raymond Shaw, ends up performing some heroic actions that saved the lives of his fellow soldiers.  All but two survive and the Sgt ends up winning a medal of honour. Upon returning to the US, the Sgt., son of a senator, ends up becoming a congressman.  Oddly enough, the way they are touting John Kerry's military record for saving his boat crew is similar.  The problem is, that Washington obtains discovers that his one and only dream, a nightmarish recollection as a result of brainwashing, is shared by another of his former platoon mates.

Mentored by his controlling Senator mother, played superbly by Meryl Streep, Raymond Shaw ends up as possible candidate for Vice President.

In the first film, the would-be President is a Communist sleeper.  In this film, the congolerate Manchurian Global serves as the conspiring organization.  They are protrayed not unlike Dick Cheney's old employer, Halliburton.  The spectre of corporate greed is a credible replacement for a much diminished political ideology.

There is a possible continuity error in the film.  After VP candidate Shaw votes in an elementary school, his is ushered upstairs for a meeting with the Washington character. Moments later, one of the Secret Service men hides a gun in an air duct in the same building.  We see the gun re-appear later in the film, but it appears to be a totally different building.

While likely not a blockbuster, this is an entertaining film nonetheless.

2158599,3,B0006210ZG,"Comparisons and contrasts between this film and its predecessor of the same name directed by John Frankenheimer (1962) are inevitable. Both were based on Richard Condon's novel (1959), although it seems to me that this remake owes more to George Axelrod's screenplay for the original film. The comments which follow, however, are limited to the 2004 version directed by Jonathan Demme and co-starring Merl Streep (as Eleanor Shaw), Denzel Washington (as Captain Bennett Marco), and Liev Schreiber (as Raymond Shaw). Although their performances as well as those of a few others in supporting roles (notably Jon Voight, Kimberly Elise, and Simon McBurney) are first-rate, I think this film has serious flaws.

Here are four. First, the implausible, at times cartoonish ""villains."" Specifically,the senior-level executives of Manchurian Global corporation who have devised and then implemented a plan by which to gain and then sustain total control of the President of the United States by placing their candidate, Raymond Shaw, in the Oval Office. He is a recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor for heroism during Operation Desert Storm. What is their motive? What else? Potentially trillions of dollars from sales worldwide of military products and paramilitary services. I also had problems with the narrative which suffers from confusing  transitions from the past to the present to the past and from one location to another. My next criticism concerns Demme's ineffective use of what could be called the ""Mad Scientist"" device, in this instance Dr. Noyle. He is an infamous geneticist whom foreign countries as well as multinational corporations hire to conduct human implant procedures ""by which to gain and then sustain total control of...."" You get the idea. I just wish Demme had developed the Noyle character as brilliantly as he did  Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lams (1991). For me, the most serious flaw is the dysfunctional coda which I will not discuss out of respect for those who have not as yet seen this film. I will suggest, however, that it raises more questions than it answers.

As Eleanor Shaw, Streep dominates every scene in which she appears. Near the end of the film, there is one with her son Raymond which suggests all of the passions which have driven her, probably for decades. Washington does the best he can with what is, as presented, a muddled character. He communicates intensity better than almost any other actor since Rod Steiger in his prime. As Marco, he also communicates torment. As for Schreiber, I think his is the most difficult character to portray because, pre-implant, Raymond Shaw was an especially unlikeable person. Post-implant, although in many ways still unlikeable, he is nonetheless a victim who is never permitted to deviate from the assignment for which he has been so thoroughly, scientifically prepared. There are brief (albeit subtle) indications of Raymond's humanity as when he is obviously pleased to see Jocelyn Jordan (Vera Farmiga) again and then later when he begins to realize that Marco's various suspicions may indeed be true.

For the reasons indicated, I think Demme and his associates created a film which lacks both thematic cohesion and dramatic impact. It is OK but....",1091232000,3,3261,5.168560606060606
