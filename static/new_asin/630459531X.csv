7877949,5,630459531X,"I saw this movie years ago when it first came out so I was glad for the chance to own the DVD.
The fact that it not only is a true story, but rumors were circulating in my hometown in NE Pennsylvania that was where the body was buried. If true, the area was only 20 miles away from me. Awesome movie!!",1423094400,,301,3.870967741935484

7877952,5,630459531X,"When the film first aired originally for USA, I appreciated the fact that this true story was ever told. However, after a few years progressed, I researched this made-for-tv version versus the true case and here is what I know. There is truly a difference when a film opens and disclaims that this movie is ""based on a true story"" Vs. ""A true story"". I am directly related to military life and I KNOW this story through discussion and personal connection.

I only give this movie the highest rating because the story was even told at all. The real victim in this movie is named Shirley Gibbs Russell (not Darnell--which is a man's name first of all--). In the film, the real husband is indeed named Robert Russell. I did not understand why the writer (an instructor from NYU currently) did not take the time to fully devote the richness of the truth.

 I disagree that interracial relationships are based in this manner nor that Shirley's mother, her unit, and friends did NOT react to Robert initially in the manner depicted in the film.

Also, Shirley did not have the drinking problem, it was Robert who had the drinking problem AND he later became a Al-Anon instructor. Also, Robert was given an article 32 because of his drinking problem. Some of the situations in the film were too contrasted as the marriage being a race issue.

This story is about two people who had fallen in true love and endured mounting troubles in their marriage just like any other couple. Joanne Jensen was NOT the fierce know-it-all in this case, it took many many investigators and the collaborative efforts of old fashioned detective work and cooperative from Shirley's friends and unit to bring this case to fruition.

This was a very terrible thing and the family really should have been depicted as they were instead of the obviousness in the manner of the true relationship between Robert and Shirley. The Marines is not an outfit where they made a big what to do about interracial marriages and by the time that this film was released, the dialogue between blacks and whites should have been a bit more comfortable than the way it was written.

It was a bit on the ""over-sensitive-careful"" side so as to not frazzle the extreme sensitivities of audience members in the vary regions of the United States and I am here to say that if people cannot accept such relationships, then, it either should not be written at all or people should watch something else rather than to change how things really are in our military branches.

People are just not that static about interracial relationships as was illustrated. for example, Jasmine Guy (who seems to not garner a lot of credit for a serious role in which she portrayed Shirley's character with grace and understanding and should have been given equal kudos as Kapture.

This is not the usual role for Guy at that time as she was more into comedy and she did a fantastic job w/ the limitation of material). In one scene ---a flash back--she speaks to a friend regarding picking up the divorce papers and says to her friend, ""well Lincoln freed the slaves..""/ I am like, African-Americans (partcularly in the Core) just do not address each other in this manner.

It was certainly not how Shirley spoke and there was not this bantering and over anti-septic issue in the military about race in this manner. I am familiar with the writer and she is not the most ""in touch"" person I ever met. she writes with a rather, card-board and formulaic capacity.

The film could have been a little longer for the subject matter. It was a very serious case and became a landmark case due to the crime committed. I will not spoil this for anyone. But I will say, I enjoyed the performances, Mitzi was good but the others held their roles just as well for what they had to work with, It could have been given more care to the truthfulness as this IS Shirley's story and I do personally know the situation a lot more than I had originally mentioned.

If ever (and I hope that any of you reading this shall ever endure this, not ever) you find that your life becomes a made for TV movie, then, you too would want the correct facts to be displayed so that your loved one is well-received. Shirley Gibbs Russell is a REAL person and was so much more.

The movie is worth watching, but keep in mind that I rated it high for the fact that the story is out there at all and also keep in mind that the dialogue concering interracial relationships is not so caged and far-fetched for what is depicted.

Over all, enjoy the film for the performances and the subject matter as it is an important one, But do your own research and understand that this can happen to any female across the board no matter the race or circumstance you find yourself in.

The reality is that this was extremely heart-breaking and it changed a great many lives around us and in the Core. Mitzi is not the Main Character as the film seems to harp on (though she did do a stellar job as well as Jasmine Guy who should have recieved equal billing for a first time dramatic performance.

That's my review, and do your own research and Google the real Shirley Gibbs Russell and the outcome of this case.",1280275200,9,5187,4.549356223175966
7877953,5,630459531X,"Incredible movie, well acted, well directed, and well produced.  The movie moved from scene to scene not dragging a bit.  The Cat and Mouse activity between Mitzi's character and Nicks' Kept us postponing trips to the kitchen and down the hall facility.  As a fan of Nick Searcy, I was pleased with his usual abiltiy to depict an arrogant character authentically.  This is the first I have seen Mitzi Kapture in a movie or a series episode but I will try to keep up with her in the future. She gave a credible performance as an NIS inviestigator.  This review was based on the recent January 24th presentation on LIfetime and recorded for later viewing and highly recommended for the fan of suspense movies.",1108339200,3,707,4.669354838709677
