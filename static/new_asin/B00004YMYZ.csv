BE CAREFUL OF THAT!!!",1283385600,,177,4.741935483870968
7927762,5,B00004YMYZ,"I have been waiting years for this affordable release. The only thing that could have made me happier would be the release of a soundtrack for No Looking Back.

The Brothers McMullen is not my favorite movie. In my opinion, it is the weakest of the three. The acting is ok, the story line is predictable, and the characters just don't pull you in and make you care a whole lot about them. She's the One is much better.

But, my favorite is No Looking Back. Jon Bon Jovi does a great job in this film! He once again proves that some music stars CAN cross the bridge into acting. All of the actors are able to make you care about them and the outcome of the dilema that makes up the backbone of the movie. The music (Bruce Springsteen, Patti Scialfa, Sheryl Crow) sets a tone that is accentuated by the cinematography. You can practically feel the chill in the air at the beginning of the movie when the camera's eye scans the ""Jersey Shore"". The bleakness of the background is representative of the despair felt by the characters.

I wholeheartedly recommend this box set if for nothing more than to see No Looking Back. Which, by the way, had previously cost more to purchase on its own than the box set is now. My advice, when it comes in--grab a blanket, pop the DVD in the machine and then curl up on the couch to watch it. It's one of those movies you won't soon forget!",1162598400,5,1374,4.317829457364341

Burns movies are the kind that make you think about the human tragedy. These are movies that you drink coffee and discuss in extreme detail.
My sister sent me the book ""Three Screenplays by Edward Burns"". I started reading the plays and knew I had to see the movies. What stories, what writing.
I feel his screenplays will become classics, with such plays as Millers, ""Death of a Salesman.""  I can't wait for his next play.
Thank god for Sundance and the opportunity given to let the public have the pleasure of seeing such fine work as Ed Burns.
Being from Rockaway and leaving to make something of my life I can honestly say Burns depicted life in Rockaway in ""No Looking Back"" true in every detail. Even got the colors in the homes exactly as I remember them.  These movies will have a permanent place in my collection.",1045353600,6,975,4.405555555555556
7927764,4,B00004YMYZ,"Edward Burns is a great writer and director and all three films in this set are great.  My favorite of the three is No Looking Back.  It's a great story about a woman freeing herself from a life going nowhere and becoming an independent person.  It's a great story and all three lead actors in the movie are perfect in their roles.  I was skeptical about Jon Bon Jovi, but, he proved me wrong once again.  The other two movies are absolutely fabulous also!!!  Ed Burns is three for three!!!  Highly recommended.",971395200,11,511,4.489130434782608
