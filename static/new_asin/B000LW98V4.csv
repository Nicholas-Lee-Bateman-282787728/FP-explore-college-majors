8164653,4,B000LW98V4,This product shows the empty hand kata from two different views and then dives into the applications.  Many applications are quite different from what I originally learned.  Many are based on joint manipulation and pressure points.  The author introduces the video by saying that these applications are his own and to not view them dogmatically.  I really enjoyed the different applications and I believe is in the spirit of Isshin-ryu because Master Shimabuku is quoted as saying to look for secret applications in the kata.,1226188800,4,525,5.141176470588236
8164654,5,B000LW98V4,"These DVDs are by far the best Isshinryu Karate Bunkai I have ever seen. These DVDs cover all eight empty hand Kata (performed the way Master Tatso Shimabuku intended) and their Bunkai focusing on pressure point techniques and (for lack of a better word) secret and/or hidden techniques. The DVDs are truly amazing - you get approx 3.5 hours of expert instruction! The katas now finally make perfect to me. I have been studying Isshinryu Karate for over 25 years and hold a 7th degree black belt myself. These are the real deal, not Master Uezu and Sensei Jennings' ""bock them to death"" applications. Master Thomas performs all of the Katas twice then performs a very thorough and detailed break down with multiple explanations for each technique. These DVDs are a must for anyone studying Isshinryu Karate or any style from Okinawa for that matter. The DVDs are very high quality and professionally produced. You will not be disappointed.",1167091200,7,939,4.911949685534591
