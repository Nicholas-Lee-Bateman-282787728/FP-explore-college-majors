313317,5,6301026128,This little film is not to be missed!  It is a beautiful pastiche - a little slice of life.  Bill Cosby plays a hard working father who is looking to the future to provide a house and good life for his wife and son.  Events conspire to give the lesson that life must be lived in the moment.  The acting by the wife and little son is superb.  The location shooting really lends a sense of both quiet resolve and potential.  This wonderful little movie is truly a lost gem.  A must-watch for those in love with the seventies.  Bill Cosby fans will be delighted as he both stars and conceived the storyline.,1353110400,,604,4.283185840707965

313319,5,6301026128,"I remember this movie vaguely from when I was a kid. I actually had to go to another website to find out the name of the movie. I remembered the actress Gloria Foster, so I had to find a filmography for her to get the name of the movie. I also remembered the son's name ""Vandy"". I was happy to actually find the movie. The movie starred Bill Cosby (pre Cosby show) as a father who is desperately trying to get his family out of a housing project. He sets his sights on an old, rundown house he wants to buy and restore. Blue, as his character is named scrimps, saves and scavenges things from the side of the road or wherever he finds them and sells them.
While Blue is planning for the future his young son Vandy is being denied a normal childhood, because of all the scrimping and saving. Vandy is diagnosed with an incurable disease and Blue decides to change his ways. Gloria Foster plays Bills wife and Vandy's mother Serena, who constantly tell her husband to allow Vandy to be a normal child. Good television movie made in 1972, so picture quality is okay. I would recommend this movie.",1318636800,,1093,4.362745098039215
313320,3,6301026128,"Obscure and I never heard of this before.  I figured it was a made for TV film since it is an hour and ten minutes (not 90).  This is a Bill Cosby production and I am sure that he meant well, but this was poorly directed and even poorly written.  It starts out one way and then ends another.  In the end we do not get to see what happened in the beginning topic even if we can speculate.

I guess this is one of those that must be forgotten even by Cosby himself.  The good part is, I can tell that this must take place in Bridgeport, CT since the film made reference to ""St. Vincent's Hospital,"" Cosby had to make a trip UP to ""Hartford"" and of course - a friend wanted to take the kids to ""Rye Playland"" which is just over the CT border in NY. Not to mention it shows what looks like the Westchester County Airport at the start of the film as well. I even noticed the old school CT and NY plates on some cars.  For this alone I recommend this.  I am biased.  It's not really that good but it is something to see if you have not seen it.",1312848000,,1038,3.9282296650717705
313321,5,6301026128,"Blue (Cosby) has big dreams.  He wants the best for his family and he sees their opportunity in an old house away from the projects.  When not working his two regular jobs, he is out doing extra odd jobs which leaves no time for his son Vandy.  They ride around in an old station wagon and do not have color TV like some of the other families in the projects.  Being a typical kid, Vandy wonders out loud to his father why they can not have these things as well.  Blue has to explain to Vandy the types of (illegal) activities those other parents do to attain those color TVs and Cadillacs.  His wife (Gloria Foster) tries to explain to Blue that Vandy needs his time not a house.  Vandy collapses while playing with the neighborhood kids and after a series of tests they learn that he has sickle cell anemia and will not live very long.  The dream of a house now seems unimportant to Blue as he struggle with the fact that a poor man has very few choices when it comes to health care for his child.  A very realistic story. An excellent dramatic turn by Bill Cosby.",1281484800,,1066,4.263681592039801
313322,4,6301026128,This is the classic mustached bill cosby way before his hit 80's show. THis movie is about bill cosby struggling to make ends meet and the whites mans world and him trying to have a relationship with his son who despises him. The script is solid watch this movie.,1226966400,,263,4.387755102040816
313323,5,6301026128,"Thank you Cosby for doing this timeless work.  I was born in 1973 and have Sickle Cell Anemia, this is the first time I am seeing this movie I don't live far from Norwalk where it was filmed.  ""A Warm December"" (1973) with Sidney Poitier, is the only other movie I know of that Sickle Cell Anemia plays a role in the story.  I wonder why it takes so long for our black actors to take up this subject that still affects our communities?

Originally telecast February 25, 1972, To All My Friends on Shore stars Bill Cosby as a middle-aged airport redcap named Blue. Frustrated by his job and his ghetto existence, Blue (played by Cosby) vows to seek out a better life for himself and his loved ones. But his stubborn efforts to do so succeed only in turning his family against him. Already burdened with enough problems, Blue must face a new crisis when his son is discovered to have Sickle Cell Anemia. Filmed on location in Norwalk, Connecticut, To All My Friends on Shore not only starred Bill Cosby, but was produced, scored and written by him as well. Allan Sloane was honored with an Emmy for his adaptation of Cosby's original story.

2006 same story goes on...",1163808000,,1166,4.481132075471698
313324,5,6301026128,"I saw this made for TV movie just one time in 1971, when I was seven years old. I only knew Bill Cosby as a comic actor, and was stunned (yes, a seven year old can be stunned now and again) by his performance. I never got it out of my head. Last year I found this heart wrenching film, and discovered it was the same movie I saw in my youth. I was again amazed at how powerful it was/is. Now being a father myself, it's message is even more meaningful. Take a chance, get this movie and share it someone you love. It will definitely move you to tears.",1138579200,,551,3.972972972972973
313325,4,6301026128,"I remember watching this on TV as a child! Bill Cosby stars as a struggling member of the working poor, helplessly watching his only child slowly dying of sickle cell anemia. It really is a very moving story; you get a sense of the overwhelming frustration experienced by those who never seem to get ahead, despite their hardest efforts. It's a low budget, made-for-tv, four-hanky tearjerker of the type they used to make in the 1970s, and it's great to see that it has an audience once more!",1124236800,,492,4.6022727272727275
