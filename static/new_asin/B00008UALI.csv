1862106,5,B00008UALI,"This gripping 77-minute film holds us spellbound and captivates our imagination as much as almost any other work in the history of cinema.

Yes--it's because of technique; and yes--it's because of the artistry, because of the the craggy feel of the Aran Isles and the hard-scrabble looks of the locals pressed into service as actors by the brilliant documentarist, Robert Flaherty.

But there are deeper reasons, too. We have an inner need to glorify and dramatize the hardships of our ancestors and of those who have come before us.  This mythmaking process--for myth it is--is an essential way in which we define ourselves and place ourselves in human history.

And the Aran Isles occupied a central place in the mythmaking that allowed the Irish Republic to define innate strengths and assert its identity, independence and nationhood.

As William Butler Yeats stated: ""We desire to preserve into the modern life that ideal of a nation of men who will . . . remember always the four ancient virtues as a German philospher (Nietzche) has enumerated them: first, honesty among one's friends; second, courage among ones enemies; third, generosity among the weak; fourth, courtesy at all times whatsoever . . .""

Yeats and Lady Gregory, concerned to engender a foundational mythic drama and poetry for modern Ireland, sent John Millington Synge to the Aran Isles to live among peasants and capture the cadences of their speech and learn their outlook on the world. That advice became a turning point for Synge, both of his life and career. Out of it came the book of his experiences there&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Aran-Islands-Penguin-Twentieth-Century-Classics/dp/0140184325/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Aran Islands (Penguin Twentieth Century Classics)</a>&nbsp;and his great 1904 one-act play&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Riders-to-the-Sea/dp/1406501824/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Riders to the Sea</a>.

Man of Aran is a continuation and new beginning in film of this creational myth. It enlists and captures all the energy and drama of myth-making and brings it forward in time so that audiences today can share it and experience the emotional power.

Man of Aran captures in a short space drama, tenderness, struggle against the elements, the relationship of men and women to nature, destiny and ultimately death--all the greatest themes of literature and art that transcend in space and time the making of the early Irish Republic.

Great art arrests the motion of life by artificial means holding it fixed in time so that a hundred years later, when a stranger looks at it (or hears it if it is a poem or a song), it moves again since it is life.

Great art paints on the ""big canvas"" of human destiny. Truly effective propaganda and myth (like Shakespeare's history plays) are subtle, and transcending their original purpose, carry the audience along to a higher plane no matter what the era.

Transcendent art is not didactic, but rather, kinetic--precisely what Flaherty achieves in Man of Aran, created over 70 years ago.",1184976000,9,3134,5.521920668058455
1862107,4,B00008UALI,Had to buy this movie as I was going to this island of Aran. Stayed in the B&B that was built for the director.,1183420800,2,111,3.6666666666666665
1862108,4,B00008UALI,"Black and white docudrama of what it was like to scrape a living off the barren coastal islands of Ireland. Story is scarce, sound is almost indecipherable, but if you watch the actors, (locals hired for the film,) they wade waist deep into the icy Atlantic breakers without even flinching, it's an every day thing for them to risk their lives to gather a torn net or pull a boat through the huge waves, just to glean enough to keep their stomach full.  I was on Aran, recognized some of the settings, life is tremendously better, now, but you see why they still consider someone not of the island families an outsider, no matter how long they've lived there.",1178928000,2,659,4.53781512605042
1862109,5,B00008UALI,"Man of Aran (the extra features aside) stands as a landmark film, a beautifully-shot evocation of the desolate west Ireland coast, part documentary, part fiction. These are actors, but the man, woman and boy are placed in timeless places and activities -- the physical labor and danger very real -- whether it's trying to spear a shark the size of their boat, or trying to extract themselves and that boat from an angry sea, or scratching a potato bed from rocky soil and making the soil in the process. Flaherty is as painstaking as these people, showing a very real process of creating a potato bed out of nothing but rock.

It's worth noting that film was still just emerging from the silent era then, and Robert Flaherty apparently filmed a silent film and then masterfully added sound -- there's very little dialogue (other than incidental). The repeated footage of the sea breaking on that cliff-lined coast conveys all of the power and danger of that surf. (The print seems of good quality.) The documentaries on the DVD show just how primitive the cameras and other equipment were -- indeed, the four documentary featurettes tell much about the difficulties and limitations of film production of the day.

The documentaries also put the film in perspective, returning to a much-tamed Aran of a later day. The interviews with former cast members and other islanders can be touching and genuine.

Possibly Robert Flaherty's best film, and the DVD is a worthy vehicle for it.",1153008000,20,1480,4.865079365079365
1862110,5,B00008UALI,"No movie better illustrates the tenuous, symbiotic relationship between brute nature and human endurance than Robert Flaherty's hauntingly gorgeous ""Man of Aran."" Flaherty, director of the classic ""Nanook of the North"" and father of the documentary form, shot ""Aran,"" his first sound feature, over the course of two and a half years, casting heroic locals in key roles and training his camera on the rugged, magnificent environment in which they eke out their survival. ""Man of Aran"" is pure visual poetry, astounding and unforgettable.",1125964800,12,536,5.392857142857143
1862111,5,B00008UALI,"""Man of Aran"" may strictly be no documentary, but it is very real.  The hard life of the people of the Isle of Aran is portrayed in its full harshness and splendor.  Of a sort.

Robert Flaherty, director of acclaimed documentary ""Nanook of the North,"" brings his same authentic eye to this struggle of man against nature, and how people can claw out an existence in even the harshest of climates.  His camera makes you believe his story, as does the unaffected dialog and ability of his subjects.

Unfortunately for Flaherty, the daily life struggle of the Aran inhabitants was not raw enough, so he brought their lives about 90 years into the past, into the realm of harpoon shark fishing and suicidal egg hunting near towering cliffs.  In order to resurrect this past, he located islanders who remembered the old ways, and knew the skills necessary to achieve his vision.  In this way, Flaherty is authentic, using the elder residents to bring their childhood to life again.  But it was not modern Aran.

This DVD is fantastic, bringing not only the original docu-drama, as well as several supporting documentaries regarding the making of ""Man of Aran,"" about Flaherty himself,  and several interesting dialogs about the film.  One could not wish for a more complete package.",1112313600,29,1277,4.8657407407407405
1862112,5,B00008UALI,"At last! Man of Aran is one of the true greatest documentaries ever made. Like Nanook of the North (Flaherty), Olympia (Riefenstal), The River (Lorentz) and many others, this is a key work in the history of documentary films.
Now about the film itself: shot for two and a half years on the irish coast, Man of Aran follows the lives of a group of irish fishermen: their constant struggle for life in a sea full of dangers. The cinematography is simply breathtaking. I simply cannot remember another film that has ever captured the sea with such a poetic feeling of greatness and power. Like most of Flaherty's films, this is a labour of love and devotion.
It is incredible that a film like this was made nearly 70 years ago!! It has a technical brillance and a dazzling style that puts it over any other film made at sea. This film shows like no other the unbelievable battle men undertake against the sea. Death, life, storms, winds... and above all, love for the sea.
This film is a true documentary experience like no other (talk about the power of the images...).
This DVD edition has a fantastic pack of extras. Two documentaries (one about the film, other about Flaherty himself). Photos and lots of great information about this landmark film. The image is very good (considering the age of the film) and the sound is very good. I replaced my VHS copy (it had a poor picture - full of damages). This is a great DVD edition. If you already know the film, this is a great DVD to have and treasure. If you don't know the film yet, give it a try for it is a true gem.",1053043200,56,1569,4.413793103448276
1862133,5,B00008UALI,"This is an early documentary about life on the little island of Aran, west of Scotland.  The island is little more than a vast rock.  The people make their own soil by composting seaweed -- seaweed they laboriously lug up the cliffs.  And they are fishermen.  There is a long sequence wherein we see them harpooning a whale shark -- or perhaps a basking shark?  (Both species grow to more than 30 feet.)  There is a long and astonishing scene wherein we see one of their small fishing boats -- a small 4-person boat perhaps 12 feet long trying to get in to shore in a storm, through high seas and POUNDING surf.
  So, the movie is fascinating for the life it is depicting.
  And it is a beautiful movie -- one beautiful scene after another.
  But one is also dazzled by the movie's technical excellence and reach.  How in the WORLD did they get footage like this in 1934?!",1398470400,2,872,4.375

1862135,2,B00008UALI,"You gotta really really love irish esoterica to find something here.  Sure Man of Aran is a myth, of sorts.  Sure its and early film and uses a new technique for the times here and there. But that's it.

Suggest you focus your viewing efforts on ""I Know Where I'm Going"" on DVD. Scotland, not Ireland. But much more fun and still Gaelic infused.",1358726400,,345,4.359375

1862137,5,B00008UALI,Good DVD copy.  Excellent representation of Bob Flaherty's camera work.  Good focus on the history of the Aran Island people.  Nice special features which many will not view 'cause it is too detailed & requires more concentration & appreciation than the majority of viewers in this country can handle.,1346457600,,301,5.1020408163265305
1862138,4,B00008UALI,This film captures the hopelessnes and physically torturing efforts to just survive in the Aron Islands. Although it is different today we can still see what those first inhabitants found to be a never-ending struggle on a sea that was so dangerous and cruel. Don't skip the special features on the making of this film!,1335052800,,319,4.818181818181818
1862139,5,B00008UALI,"I have lived my entire life protected by a city.  So, I am insulated from the raw powers of nature - those enormous and mysterious forces that mankind has had to face for centuries. This film reaches deep into my mind and pulls me back into an ancient time when men and women battled the fury of nature - wind, waves, and cold - every day for basic sustenance.

Robert Flaherty captures the resilient spirit of the people of this remote island, to be sure, but what I remember are the crashing of the waves on ragged rocks, the howling of the wind, the screams above the din.  What an experience!

This documentary is exceptionally well done.  And don't miss the extras which includes a fascinating biography of Flaherty himself who is truly a cinema pioneer and adventurer.",1331337600,,774,4.579710144927536
1862140,4,B00008UALI,"""Man of Aran"" is not best described as a documentary. It may be a document of sorts, but what it is most true to is Flaherty's poetic vision, rather than the actual lives of his subjects. The film - despite its two years in the making - tells us very little about the ""characters"" (""the man"" of Aran is a universal man). They are essentially figures in a landscape - silhouettes, as often shown, set against a cloud-billowing sky.

But the film is still a wonderful thing. The elemental struggle it depicts is powerful and timeless. (One is reminded of the Japanese film ""The Naked Island"", though that is more of a character study.) Certainly something of a former time and way of life, now gone, has been preserved for us, and this should be celebrated. The film, nevertheless, is quite short and consists of only a few sequences (again surprising, considering how long it took to make) - a point that gets lost in some panegyrics.

This DVD includes a number of interesting features. One introduces some of the people seen in the film, forty years later. Another which I found especially interesting was on Frances Flaherty - the film-maker's wife and collaborator. What a fascinating individual she seems to have been: a genuine, New England free spirit.",1293408000,,1258,4.739726027397261
1862141,4,B00008UALI,"Very interesting. Considering how long ago it was made, the photography is great. And, the lifestyle of these people, WOW. I'm glad I got to watch it.. But, as a heads up, I don't think your kids will appreciate it.",1288915200,,215,4.4
1862142,5,B00008UALI,"I wouldn't call this a documentary because although it was filmed using actual inhabitants of Aran and documented the rough life of the people there, these people were cast in the parts of ""the man"", ""the woman"" and ""their son"" and the narrative was staged, much of it actually showing the people doing things that by 1931 when the movie was filmed, the island people were no longer doing. However, this is a breathtaking film that takes a central theme, the struggles with nature of the people of Aran, and depicts this theme in a hauntingly beautiful film that was groundbreaking for its time. This is an artistic masterpiece.",1249084800,,628,4.770642201834862

7986834,2,B00008UALI,"I first viewed ""Man"" as an undergrad in the 1960s as part of a college art film series. Last summer I visited the Aran Islands and vaguely remembered the film I'd seen 50-some years ago. I was interested to revisit the film and compare it to my actual impressions of the island. The film was a big disappointment. The narrative is choppy, acting is stilted (yes, actors portray the central characters), sound is awful. On the other hand, the visuals of the island and of the tremendous waves crashing ashore are impressive. What I didn't appreciate 50 years ago is how controversial ""Man"" is. I thought it was an early example of ""cinema verite,"" when actually it's staged. The shark hunting scene, for example, had to be recreated since islanders no longer hunted sharks in the way depicted. It was also a disappointment to learn that the man and his family were not actually a family, but a selection of islanders cobbled together to constitute an idealized Aran Islands family.",1484265600,2,980,4.770588235294118
7986835,4,B00008UALI,"Visually beautiful, powerful, suspenseful, tender. The ""movie music"" characteristic of the era detracts from film's power; otherwise it would get 5 stars.",1472774400,,154,6.045454545454546
