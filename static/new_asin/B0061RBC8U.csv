8490930,4,B0061RBC8U,"I received this DVD quickly.  Packaged nicely.  Unfortunately, could not play it on my US Magnavox TV-DVD combo TV.  I guess it was from a different region than my TV could support.  I was really looking forward to giving this to my mom.  Will look for a DVD player or TV that plays all regions.",1464652800,,295,4.290909090909091
