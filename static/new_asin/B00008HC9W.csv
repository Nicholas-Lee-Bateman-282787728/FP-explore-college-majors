And wouldn't they just do the silliest possible things imaginable? Treat each other terribly? Or run around with flowers in their hair and dance all day? Not one of them would be able to grow their own food, and for sure - they would absolutely drug and abuse any other women out of what? jealousy? Oh please. The only good part of this is the end where the only man alive after the rain is GAY!

This is just awful, not campy. It belittles women in every possible way. Save your money.",1342915200,,598,4.245614035087719
7984303,1,B00008HC9W,"I found this movie had very little story line I could follow.  I am trying desparately to remember what happened but my recall of this mivie is a better description.  A movie length nothing!  No politics, no made you think moments whether for or against your own thoughts.
I was glad to buy it because now I can tell my friends what not to waste there money on!
Sorry nothing positive to say about this film.",1331596800,,408,4.342105263157895
7984304,4,B00008HC9W,"This should be reworked with a changed more powerful score. I wouldn't change any of the actors, although I did reach for my abseced tooth once and awhile. I must go back and see Death Race 2000 again. I asked my wife tonight I f I should become an actor, because it doesn't seem like I'm making it at anything else. Hope floats. I loved the coloring of the scientist! Stereotypes are shattered, an alcholic can properly raise two children on her own. Although, I wonder where the realist were: they didn't run out of gas once, even at 3 miles to the gallon, they were present when the desperate housewives were starving, I got really excited to see a realistic Zombie!! Sandra Kinder made it in the movie ""worth the price to see it again.""",1173916800,2,740,4.448529411764706
7984305,5,B00008HC9W,"A fagulous midnight movie, now available 24/7 via DVD release!  Todd Hughes' premier full-length feature stars cult phenomenon Mary Woronov in her best role since _Eating Raoul_, and a sumptous performance by Sandra Kinder (_Twin Peaks_: ""Want to know our specials?  We don't have any."").  The always enchanting Roma Maffia and buzz-cut butch pin-up girl Jenny Shimizu also appear in this mind-melting take on the apocalypse.  It's like a strong cigarette: your head spinning is the POINT, sweetheart.",1055376000,3,501,5.384615384615385
7984306,3,B00008HC9W,"Complete and utter camp, The New Women is a must see for anyone into cult B-movies.  Full of hilariously bad lines, weird sci-fi twists and kooky characters, it wears its love of John Waters and Russ Meyer on its sleeve.  It stars Mary Woronov (""Eating Raoul"") as Lisa LaStrada whose husband is cheating on her with the town slut.  At her sister's BBQ, she starts boozing it up for the first time in 3 years and spirals down into a despair the likes of which only Devine has ever surpassed.
On her way home from the party, a weird rainstorm hits. It causes the entire world to go into a sleep from which only the women awake days later.  What will Lisa do?  Why, take her cheatin' husbands' job as town sheriff and unsuccessfully attempt to stop the rampant looting and chaos, of course.
And it gets loonier.  It eventually turns into a road movie when Lisa, her sister, the town's senior citizen floozy, and the local feminist all jump in an RV and head to Elysium, a new society that was made by women for women.  On the way, they meet hippie chicks, biker babes and scientists who want to make sure the human race continues.  There are enough zany shenanigans here to satisfy the guiltiest of pleasures.",1054512000,8,1206,4.474885844748859
