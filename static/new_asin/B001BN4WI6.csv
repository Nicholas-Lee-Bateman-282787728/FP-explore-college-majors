3495598,4,B001BN4WI6,"The proxy review extended to Mission Impossible below was my original criticism of CBS/Paramount for their malicious destruction of The Fugitive Season 2 Volume 1.  I have since changed the star rating from 1 star to 4 stars deleting the original review and cutting & pasting my review, with appropriate revisions, back in place.

This was a protest of sorts, focused on the tragic plight of the classic series The Fugitive as mishandled by CBS/Paramount, but it also pertains to Mission Impossible and other series given positive reviews prior to their release dates by overzealous fans.

For those unfamiliar with what occurred, without prior warning and following an entirely satisfactory release to both volumes of the first season, CBS/Paramount hired a modern composer, Mark Heyes, to record a synthesizer score, replacing the classic Pete Rugolo orchestrated score and cues which in effect destroyed the emotional impact of scenes and nuanced dramatic feel of the series. The reaction has been overwhelmingly negative, covered by Variety and numerous media review sites and discussion boards.

So, why would anyone give the 5th season of Mission Impossible a negative critique without having viewed it?

Well, consider it karmic balance if you will, because everyone who provides a positive five star review an upcoming release without having seen it is performing exactly the same function or rather disservice to consumers, since CBS/Paramount could just as easily make drastic unannounced changes to this series!

Positive reviews of unseen products are the reason why folks get burned buying series sets based upon testimonials prior to release dates! That is precisely what occurred with Season 2, Volume 1 of The Fugitive. Both volumes of the first season are fine, so the CBS/Paramount decision to alter the scoring and cues in a horrendous fashion was totally unexpected and left many disappointed fans having spent money for product they did NOT enjoy.

Conversely, I had no desire to be insensitive to fans of Mission Impossible who are anticipating what may be a perfectly fine release. So, to be fair, I changed my review and rating because this release has come out with very little if any alteration.

Of course, my goal is to encourage the folks at CBS/Paramount to do the right thing and respond to the public outcry by restoring the original theme music and cues to Season 2 of The Fugitive, but my concern extends to all series licensed by them. This cautionary warning may or may not have the impact desired, but the mistreatment of these classic series as corporate property to be issued for quick profit and forgotten rather than as nostalgic art will require some rehabilitation before I can be in the CBS/Paramount corner again.

Great series television begs for release in unaltered form, as aired, with scoring and all original footage intact. Minor alterations are always tolerated, but wholesale removal and 'creative' alteration is not. It is imperative for consumers to take a stand and let these folks know the dissatisfaction felt by their customer base if they want us to continue buying their product.

This probably won't be my last preemtive review of an upcoming CBS/Paramount product, but I plan to treat them all with the same degree of fairness!

I know that there were 7 seasons of this series all together and that including this one the company has re;eased 5 of them.... please please please once that 7th season has been released, if not before, please release the ""MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 1988"" two season series with Peter Graves, Phil Morris, Tony Hamilton e.t.c. thanks :-)",1219449600,8,398,4.852941176470588
3495600,4,B001BN4WI6,"Peter Graves, Greg Morris, Peter Lupus and Leonard Nimoy return for yet another season of this series~ NO FULL TIME FEMALE LEAD  has been seen since Barbara Bain left at the end of Season Three~ along comes Leslie Ann Warren~ unfortunabely she is bit of a bore~

what makes up for anything else is the WRITING IS BACK ~AND SOME GREAT GUEST STARS~ SEVERAL OF THE BEST ARE~

The Killer has Robert Conrad as a Hired Killer who changes his plans EVERYTIME HE MOVES ABOUT~ so to trap him is even more difficult~ his natural ability to ""blend"" is fantasic and the team sets up very detailed surveilance and one of the most fun clever plot twists we have not seen since season one~

Homecoming~ Jim Phelps travels back to his home town where a serial killer suddenly emerges~ a Vietnam Vet is the primary suspect but the team moves in to help solve this well written and acted epiode~ one of the BEST~

DECOY is fun~ watch the team help a brother and sister escape under the eyes their many guardS with a mini racer in the back of a hearse~ WELL WRITTEN AND SOME CLEVER GADGETS~

NOW BACK TO LESLIE~ she was ""very"" young when she made this series~~ and HER BACK GROUND WAS SINGING/DANCING~  suddenly she attempts acting~ I LOVED HER IN VICTOR / VICTORIA SHE IS GREAT BUT IN THIS SERIES SHE ALWAYS FALLS SHORT~ SHE ONLY LASTED ONE SEASON ...THANK GOODNESS~ lol but THE CLEVER PLOTS AND GREAT WRITING PULL THIS SEASON BACK UP WHERE WE LOVE IT~ I GIVE IT A SOLID 9 OUT OF 10 FOR WRITING IN MOST OF THE EPISODES~",1216512000,17,1501,4.358422939068101
3495601,5,B001BN4WI6,"Good evening. This is the fifth season (1970-1971) of ""Mission: Impossible"" which is fully produced by Bruce Lansbury from season 4 and supervised by top writer Laurence Heath who, nevertheless, produces six episodes. Here is a complete revision of the series because of its ideological shift through a leaning towards the thematics of the youth movement (for instance: students' agitators and radicals in ""Takeover"", NLF guerrillas in ""The Rebel"", far left terrorists in ""The Hostage"" and subversive revolutionaries in ""Blast"").

You will find some deep changes: a new-hip-younger ""regular"" leading lady named Dana Lambert (played by Lesley Ann Warren) introduced in ""Flip Side"" (in which she performs two folk songs), a replacement of Willy in twelve episodes out of twenty three via a young physician named Doug Robert and also named Doug Lang (played by Sam Elliott), a faster-harder-urgent urban main theme music (moreover, four episodes contain the original main theme music), no more multi-part episodes, a recursive portable gadget used to stun that can be described as a ""golden needle ring"" (created by writer Ken Pettus in a season 4 episode of ""The Wild Wild West""  and introduced in a late MISSION season 4 entitled ""The Crane"", and over-used by producer Bruce Lansbury), no dossier scenes, a dramatic prologue-teaser followed directly by the tape scene before the opening credits, downbeat and realistic kind of narratives with accidents and failures, assignments in progress, improvisations, and caught up agents. The fashion design of the team is also renewed and reflects the trend (casual or outrageous) of the 1970's: pay attention to Jim's outfits (suits and sunglasses) during the tape scenes which will blossom from season 6.

Anyway, two of the series' main ingredients remain: a master of disguises (Paris) and foreign intrigues (around sixteen). Actor Leonard Nimoy shines again in these offerings: brainwashed Fred Stark in ""My Friend, My Enemy"", Kabuki performer Nakamura Taizo in ""Butterfly"", abducted business man Walter A. Phelan in ""The Hostage"", criminal Alfredo Sanchez/old convict Martin Sanchez in ""The Catafalque"", professional gambler Harry Kroll in ""The Merchant"". You'll still discover top episodes: the masterpiece ""The Killer"" (guest starring Robert Conrad), ""The Innocent"" (a controversial plot re-written by Laurence Heath that calls into question the methods of the IMFers who blackmail a young ""hippie"" scientist so that he works with them), ""Flight"" (guest starring John Colicos), ""The Catafalque"" (written by scripts genius Paul Playdon and guest starring John Vernon) and good ones: ""My Friend, My Enemy"" (guest starring Peter Mark Richman), ""The Merchant"" (guest starring George Sanders), ""The Hostage"" (guest starring Lou Antonio), ""The Amateur"" (guest starring Anthony Zerbe), ""The Missile"" (guest starring David Sheiner), ""The Party"", ""The Field"". As in season 4, intimistic stories centered around IMFers return: Paris (""My Friend, My Enemy"" in which we learn his past as a magician), Jim (""Homecoming"" in which we get a glimpse of his hometown and his family background), Barney (""Cat's Paw"" in which we meet his brother). The music scores are powerful: ""The Killer and ""Takeover"" by Lalo Schifrin and ""The Rebel"" by Hugo Montenegro.",1214784000,66,3287,5.479289940828402

I'd thought that I'd seen most episodes, but found out that I had missed quite a few. I was in the military at the time, so there was not a lot of opportunity to commit to seeing a television show every week. This time around, I started at Season 1, Episode 1, and began watching in sequence. Most of the episodes hold up over time very well, although today's technology does make some of the gimmicks of the era seem quaint today. More to the point, since this review is supposed to be about Season 5, I can easily say why it only gets 3 stars, and not 4 or 5 such as I would give other seasons. The cast had evolved over time for reasons that most viewers are now well aware of, and season 5 brought both Sam Elliot and Lesley Ann Warren to the program. Ms. Warren was a young and hot property in show biz at the time, and I'm sure that the producers were always mindful of bringing in a younger audience with someone who would appeal to that demo. Likewise, Sam Elliot was a new face then, and not the craggy looking old dude he is today. (He is a great actor, though). The problem is, Ms. Warren was just too young to be hanging around with the generation of operatives who were pulling these capers, and it was creepy seeing her engage in some of the tactics necessary for the missions with men who could be her father. As good an actress as she was ( and probably still is) she wasn't convincing in the way that Barbara Bain, or even Lee Meriwether was. But I won't blame her entirely for the three stars. Half of the stories, and the developed scripts were pretty bad, and I mean really bad. They came off as if they had been done over a couple of drinks over the weekend, and lacked the complexity and ballsiness that earlier shows had. The repeated efforts to do stories about ""student protests"" and uprisings on campus probably seemed topical at the time, but bring out a yawn today. Give me Col. Rogosh, Stravos, Rojak and all of the other lowlifes that Jim, Barnie, Rollin, Paris, Willie, Cinnamon, and Tracey crushed in previous seasons, and I'd be happy. Maybe they were just running out of stories...",1453507200,2,2221,4.341346153846154

3495715,5,B001BN4WI6,"Season 5 or 4, as I now am on Season 6, was interesting as to the character's that came on and went away and some stayed.  Season one had Hill as the lead character of the IM Force and was replaced in Season 2 by Graves as Hill had a dispute on pay.  I think Season 4 or 5 Bain and Landau thought as a real married couple they had a better chance on their own and did not do so well so Nimoy took Landau's place with the masks and several women changed for Bain's part like Day George and Warren, etc.  The funniest thing I found is that Nimoy superior was ""Jim"" and then in the mid 1970""s his superior was ""Jim"" or Capt Kirk and also in Season 6 Nimoy is gone and replaced but the first episode Shatner is the bad guy gangster and no Nimoy.

3495743,3,B001BN4WI6,"The show:  it's not Mission's best year.  They cut the budget and it shows.  Leslie Ann Warren is a bit too young for a lot of the things she was supposed to do.  They tried phasing out Peter Lupus and replacing him with Sam Elliott, but he ended up largely doing the same things and didn't add anything new or interesting.  And they dumbed-down/simplified the story lines, so a lot of the Missions could have easily become episodes of Mannix or other, more ordinary shows.

There are things going for it: they tried some experiments to shake things up and get out of their ruts.  There are more and better unexpected plot twists and turns; there is more conflict and action; and they tried to reveal a little of the personal histories of the leads.  Some worked well, some fell flat.  There are a few good episodes in this series, but fewer than in previous years.

The DVD Set:  nicely done but nothing special.  The picture and audio are clean and clear.  The chapter breaks usually match the act breaks.  There are no extras.  It's better watching the show on these DVDs than it is on TV with commercial breaks, time compression, superimposed advertisements, edits, and all the other ways TV manages to degrade the viewing experience.",1439856000,2,1238,4.640552995391705

3495777,5,B001BN4WI6,"I think Lesley Warren greatly improved the show over Season 4.  Season 4 was reeling from the loss of Martin Landau and Barbara Bain and greatly suffered from the lack of a strong, regular female character.  The change in direction in Season 5 fixed that, in my view.  In Season 5, Lesley Warren and Leonard Nimoy worked quite well together - they seemed to have a very nice chemistry - plus Lesley, at age 24, added a late 60s - early 70s hip feel to the show.

This is probably the third best of the 7 seasons.  All are at least very good, but this one is lots of fun to watch due to the combo of Lesley Warren and Leonard Nimoy.

But I can understand why some don't like the feel of Season 5, because you either hate Lesley Warren or you love her.  I just happen to love her, because I grew up in the 1960s and 1970s.",1403308800,,820,4.0875

3495806,5,B001BN4WI6,"The 1970-71 season of ""Mission: Impossible"" saw the return of the permanent female lead. She was not cool as a cucumber, like the glamourous Cinnamon Carter. Then again, could anyone else be THAT cool? Her name- Dana Lambert, portrayed by Lesley Ann Warren, or Lesley Warren, as it says in the opening credits. Dana was younger, fresh-faced, and sexy. Some still have their complaints about her. Sure, she looked like everyone's kid sister, but I liked Dana. She was a good addition to the show, and a new take on the IMF female. She was similar to Peggy Lipton over on ""Mod Squad"", with that same innocent, doe-eyed look.

This was also the season the show took on a more personal touch, focusing on the pasts of both Jim and Barney, and the IMF team being seen more as friends, as opposed to just colleagues. Also during this time, Mr. Phelps no longer looked through his dossier of photos, deciding who to use on each mission, as he obviously felt confident to go with the same team every time. Therefore, that sequence was eliminated for good. We also saw a new character- Dr. Doug Roberts, played by a clean-shaven Sam Elliott. Word has it the producers were trying to ease out Peter Lupus in favor to Sam, to the dismay of loyal viewers. This did not take place. I liked Dr. Roberts, and enjoyed seeing he and Willy work together on a mission once. There was room for both, as each had a different role within the team. Paris was back, with little to do, unfortunately. This is my only complaint about this season. The character of Paris is fascinating to me. He should not have been on the sidelines. We should have had the opportunity to learn about his past, too. This is no doubt why Leonard Nimoy chose to leave the show at the end of the season. It remains a significant loss.

The theme song took on a more hip, modern tone, while the episodes remained the same- still exciting, captivating, and suspenseful. This was the cast at its largest, and their chemistry was superb.

Season five is one of my favorites within the series. Actually, I like each of the seven seasons equally, for various reasons.",1326585600,4,2115,4.560526315789474

3495811,3,B001BN4WI6,"The addition of 24 year old Lesley Warren to the cast of Mission Impossible in season five (1970-71), brought some stability, focus, and youth, to a program with a history of issues in the production department, and turbulent cast upheavals.  The series continues to evolve away from missions with a cold war flavor set in fictional foreign lands, and include adventures related to crime and illegal activities.

A traumatic season four, featured the departure of Martin Landau and Barbara Bain, and the introduction of Leonard Nimoy (Star Trek) as Paris the Great.  An assortment of actresses appeared as IMF (Impossible Missions Force) agents during the fourth season, but none of them was selected as a permanent replacement for the fifth season.  Instead, the role went to the relatively unknown Warren, who joined a veteran cast of middle aged males.

Most of the core of the show remained intact, with Peter Graves as IMF leader Jim Phelps, Greg Morris as electronics wizard Barney Collier, and Peter Lupus as operative Willy Armitage, returning to perform their familiar roles.  Paris seems to have a less prominent role, after being a featured player the previous season.  Often left floundering by the writers, this would be Nimoy's final season.  Lupus was also apparently considering leaving the series, and Sam Elliot was brought in as physician Doug Robert, replacing Lupus in nearly half of the 23 episodes.

Having worked with more experienced actresses in the previous season, the producer's selection of Warren as Dana Lambert, seems a bit odd.  With experience on stage and as a dancer, Warren tries hard, but is not always credible, as she has a tendency to get too emotional and overact.  Her performances do seem to improve over time, as the writers stop putting her in bimbo roles.  The actress apparently felt that the situation wasn't ideal, and left after one season.  The departure of both Warren and Nimoy, continued the trend of cast turnover.

Attempting to come up with fresh ideas and establish the dynamics between the new characters, the episodes are a mixed bag of mostly average quality stories that often cover old ground, while incorporating familiar elements.  Entering the 1970's, the tone is more relaxed, with longer hair, more stylish clothes, and a more swinging vibe.  As in the early days, some adventures still involve the manipulation of foreign governments, but many missions involve matters, much smaller in scale.

Occasionally the stories do explore new areas and come up with something fresh, as in the episode ""Homecoming"", where Jim Phelps returns to the town where he grew up, and a series of murders causes him to bring in the IMF team to help investigate.  In ""Decoy"", Jim falls in love with a princess he is supposed to rescue, and drives her to safety in a race car.

Outrageous con jobs are a staple of the program, and ""Flight"" is probably the best example in season five.  John Colicos is a government official planning to assassinate his country's president and assume power.  The IMF team cooks up an over the top scheme involving a phony plane crash, and escapade in an island prison, to foil the scheme.

At a time when the practice of apartheid was condemned by most of the free world, ""Kitara"" explores this controversial subject.  Lawrence Dobkin plays a white military officer in a fictional African land, who suddenly finds his skin turning very dark, as part of the IMF's plan to free a captured rebel leader.

Barney Collier is spotlighted in several episodes.  He goes undercover to avenge the death of his brother in ""Cat's Paw"", and is exposed to a deadly toxin and captured by the enemy in ""The Innocent"".  He is wounded on a mission in Africa, in ""Hunted"".  Desperate and on the run, he is befriended by a beautiful deaf girl.

Paris also has some personal time in the badly written ""My Friend, My Enemy"", when he falls into enemy hands and is brainwashed.  In a superior story, Paris impersonates a mob figure, and penetrates the inner circle of an organized crime family in ""Squeeze Play"", where Albert Paulsen plays a dying mob leader.

With faint ties to reality, Mission Impossible always required some suspension of disbelief.  A smash hit with a bold and exciting premise, maintaining credibility was not a high priority when the series created by Bruce Geller began.  However by Season Five, cold war tensions had eased, the novelty of rubber masks had faded, and plots were being recycled.  There is still some entertainment value, and the new cast members add some interest, but long time fans may find that the same gimmicks and phony accents, no longer play as well.  There are some good moments, but there are also several terribly written episodes that just do not work.  More changes would follow in Season Six, as Lynda Day George would replace Lesley Warren, and the IMF team would mainly operate as a foursome.",1294012800,4,4906,4.905454545454545
3495812,4,B001BN4WI6,"Packaging, video and audio quality first rate.  Some very entertaining episodes here, and a few clunkers.  I always liked the teamwork and camaraderie of the ""Mission: Impossible"" regulars.  Why have there never been interviews with personnel associated with ""Mission: Impossible"" or CBS Video's other '60s-'70s title ""Hawaii Five-0"" on the expected bonus tracks of these DVDs?! What a treat it would be to see Peter Lupus, Lesley Ann Warren and Leonard Nimoy provide insight into production of specific episodes and share some meaningful anecdotes about ""Mission"" and the show's treatment by Paramount and CBS.  I mean more than the cliched ""Oh, we were all just like a family.  Blah, blah, blah.""  And speaking of ""Five-0"" why hasn't CBS Video provided the ""Mission: Impossible"" episodic promos which are provided on ""Hawaii Five-0"" DVDs?  And why not include/offer the station break bumpers mid show?  Those 5-second music and title card clips are nostalgic to many of us who fondly recall ""Mission's"" CBS broadcasts.  And one doesn't have to be in the group who saw these episodes first-run to want to see/hear the Paramount logo at the tail of the end title.  Why, oh why, can't CBS Video retain the complete end title with Paramount title card and then add on the CBS Video clip?!  It boggles the mind.  That one act destroys the overall experience of feeling one is watching vintage ""Mission: Impossible.""",1283731200,2,1412,5.064935064935065
3495813,5,B001BN4WI6,"""Mission Impossible - The Fifth TV Season"" originally aired in 1970-1971 and featured a few subtle changes to the standard format of this classic TV drama.  The plots shifted from an almost exclusively Cold War focus to new, more contemporary 1970's issues for the Impossible Mission Force involving criminal syndicates, terrorists, protesters, apartheid, private crimes, and in one instance, a serial killer.  There were new cast members.  Long-time series regulars Peter Graves, Greg Morris, and Peter Lupus were joined by Leonard Nimoy as Paris (for his second season), a young Sam Elliot as Dr. Doug Roberts, and an even younger Lesley Ann Warren as Dana Lambert.

This DVD set contains all 23 episodes of the fifth season.  Among the highlights: ""The Killer"", in which the IMF tracks a contract killer played by Robert Conrad and in which Lesley Warren is introduced as new agent Dana Lambert.  In ""Homecoming"", Jim Phelps rallies his team for an off-the-books mission to catch a serial killer in his hometown; the episode provides an intriguing glimpse of the young Phelps.  In ""My Friend, My Enemy"", Paris is kidnapped and transformed into a killing machine whose target is his own boss, Jim Phelps.  In ""Kitara"", the IMF team must liberate a young black freedom fighter by convincing his ruthless captor of his own black heritage.  In ""The Party"", the IMF cleverly ""borrows"" an entire foreign consulate to fool an enemy spy.  Each episode features the exotic plans and race-against-the-clock mission execution that were the show's signature.

The Cold War is almost two decades in our collective wake, and the special effects look less impressive than at first showing, but these Mission: Impossible episodes are still fun to watch.  The  ""Season Five"" is very highly recommended to its fans.",1259712000,2,1800,5.123287671232877
3495814,2,B001BN4WI6,"Mission:Impossible is my favorite TV show ever, and I own all of the first five seasons on DVD. In my view Season 5 represents the nadir of the original Mission:Impossible series.

In my opinion the mistake that the producers made at this juncture of the series (which coincided with the dismissal of the show's creator Bruce Geller) was to make the episodes character-driven instead of plot-driven. Mission:Impossible was conceived as a show based on a complex, intricate and perfectly executed plan. While the characters were important in terms of the various skills they possessed in order to carry out the plan, the story was never about the characters. This changed in Season 5, as is evidenced by the episode ""Homecoming"" which features a very weak plot and a lot of rather sappy references to Jim Phelps' personal history. Gone is the meticulously constructed plot; in its place is a very pedestrian crime drama. (One exception to this trend in Season 5 is the episode ""The Killer,"" probably the best show in an otherwise poor collection.)

Thankfully the producers came to their senses and in Season 6 restored many of the elements which made the series great.

To sum up, Season 5 is only for die-hard fans of Mission:Impossible. Casual fans and/or those who want to see only the best episodes would be better off acquiring seasons 2-4.",1245283200,37,1345,4.916299559471366

Seeing Leonard Nimoy in action is always fun.",1239062400,3,495,4.8352941176470585
3495837,3,B001BN4WI6,"The 5th season of Mission:Impossible was good but far inferior to the previous 4 seasons.  The main problem is Lesley Warren, who is cute but way too young and unsophisticated for the IMF.  She would be replaced the following year by Lynda Day George who fit in much better with the men of the IMF.  Also a problem was the lack of use of Leonard Nimoy who, in many episodes, had little to do at all.  Nimoy has related in various books how disappointed he was with the show and how he couldn't wait to get off Mission after this season.
As others have previously said, the best episode of this set is ""The Killer"" guest starring Robert Conrad, a terrific episode.
As usual I continue to be amazed by the CBS/Paramount lack of retrospectives or commentaries on any of the Mission DVD sets.  This is one of the few classics of the 1960s with the majority of the cast still alive: how they can continue to release these sets with nothing extra is beyond me.",1238976000,14,954,4.3977272727272725
3495838,5,B001BN4WI6,"The first four years were a formula series with the same thing week after week. Few episodes broke from the formula and are generally considered the best of the series. This season broke the mold by eliminating the slower formats of the series such as reviewing the files of potential assistants, and the criminals were more local terrorists of the times such as rebel fighters to teenage crime waves. Leonard Nimoy appears in a number of episodes and only his voice gives away his ability to disguise himself to the average television viewer.

Among the highlights worth watching are ""The Killer"" with Robert Conrad as a hitman who makes decisions randomly using a pair of dice -- thus proving a challenge for the gang. ""My Friend, My Enemy"" has Paris (Nimoy) abducted in Switzerland and subjected to a procedure that turns him into a killing machine. His first target is Jim Phelps! ""Homecoming"" features Jim Phelps returning home and discovering one of his old friends may be a killer. In ""Cat's Paw"" Barney tries to avenge his father's death by bringing down the crooked police captain and black syndicate leader who had him killed.

Anyone who has watched the first four seasons can tell from the plots described that this is the season that makes the transition and revamps into a more hip series. Recommended.",1237248000,3,1316,4.844444444444444

3495844,5,B001BN4WI6,"I will always give a five-star rating to each of the 5 seasons of the original MI series, but, unfortunately, it was in season 5 that the show lost much of the luster it had in its first four seasons. (Please note-even a ""poor"" MI episode is heads and shoulder above almost everything else on television).  Creator Bruce Geller was forced out of having anything to do with making the show, which led to changes the irrevocably changed the nature of the series.  One was to make the show more attractive to a younger audience.  This involved bringing Leslie Warren in as the regular female member of the team. Most of her performances were lackluster, with one notable exception.  In addition, the theme song was made more ""modern"" and less gripping, in my opinion.  Secondly, a number of experiments were made with the basic premise of the show, most of which were not successful.  Among them was a scene in the episode ""Blast"" which is played for pure comedy (a house belonging to a well-to-do couple is taken over by terrorists, including IMF people pretending to go along with them, and the IMF people are forced to promise not to damage the furniture and to take good care of their dog!), another is an especially uninteresting episode where Jim goes back to his home town and gets involved in solving a murder which is a total waste of the IMF's talents and in which Paris quotes the the stupidest line ever from the series: ""I dig old home towns!"".  On the positive side, there is a very good episode (""The Innocent"") where Barney is injured and the IMF is forced to bring in a reluctant outsider to help them and in which the morality of what the team does is questioned.
It must be said there are numerous fine episodes that dealt with what were then current events such as nuclear weapons proliferation (""The Field""), apartheid in South Africa (""Kitara""), another episode in which Barney is injured in a white-ruled country in Africa which was a thinly disguised version of Rhodesia, and the famous hotel-switch episode with Robert Conrad (""The Killer"").
As I noted above, Leslie Warren was just not the best person to take Barbara Bain's place on the team, being too young and not ""serious"" enough, however, she did put in a fine performance in ""Flight"" in which she is captured and at first seems to break down and cry claiming she was a fringe person innocently recruited into an intelligence operation without really knowing what is going on, then, she quickly changes persona, becomes cool as a cucumber and tells her interrogators that yes, she is working for American intelligence. However, this brief moment of glory for her and her character didn't last.
I happen to think Sam Elliott was a fine addition to the series, but I guess they didn't figure there was room for both him and Peter Lupus in the show. His best performance was in ""Kitara"" where he plays an Afrikaner army officer (he had the accent down pretty well) who is an expert in rooting out blacks pretending to be whites.  Again, like Leslie Warren, he wasn't really given any other challenging roles.
This season was Leonard Nimoy's second as Paris, and he was very disappointed in the show and decided to leave it. He was not given that much to do, but he also put in some fine performances (although, on the whole, he is not the actor Martin Landau is), among them, ""The Field"" where he plays an American traitor who is arrested and accused of murder, which was not part of the original mission.
Finally, it was in this season that the decision was made to de-emphasize the episodes about international intrigue due to the unpopularity of the War in Vietnam, however there are still some good ones, particularly, ""The Amateur"" with Anthony Zerbe, one of MI best villains. After this season, these type of episodes were completely phased out with the Missions  changed to battling organized crime, which quickly lead to the writers running out of ideas.

Having said all this, any fan of series will still enjoy these season 5 episodes.",1227225600,8,4021,4.698863636363637

This 5th series of MI is one of my favorites. They finally grow there hair/sideburns a little and start swinging with the '70's! Really strong writing, and a good variation of plots. Too bad Leonard Nimoy wasn't happy with his role, but he is a team-member of equal importance, and really shines in several episodes. Sam Elliott as a doctor is not a good replacement for strongman Willie in 10 episodes, but he is not as bad as I expected, just generally useless. Lesley Anne Warren is very young and new to acting, but she is gorgeous and wears some incredible mini-dresses & mini-skirts (and never wore a bra). Yes, I admit, pure eye candy, but she is effective in the mod episodes where Barbara Bain would have seemed, well, out of place. The next years are good too, but this seems like the last classic team, and the least repetitive with plots.

The sets are very artificial-looking. Many of the plots are weak, and the acting thin.  Leslie Warren is awful in the beginning but steadily improves as the season progresses.  Unclear why Sam Elliot alternates with Peter Lupus, who actually develops a personality after four seasons of blah.  I did not like that the introduction of each episode is inconsistent one to the next.  Some of the character actors utilized throughout are excellent, such as George Sanders.  This is Leonard Nimoy's second season, and he is not as good as in the first, but this may be due to the weak plotlines.  Peter Graves and Greg Morris are the stabalizers; very good each time out.

Well, to my fellow CBS/Paramount skeptics, I'm glad to report that this 5th season of Mission: Impossible is okay, and has not been bastardized by any tampering from the CBS/Paramount music-changing service labs.

I waited until I had heard from another reviewer before even ordering this set, and still kept my fingers crossed.  I've watched a few episodes, and I'm happy with the set.  No music has been removed, and, more importantly, none has been injected in.

The video and audio quality is fine, the same as the earlier Mission sets  -- but, of course, this is the set where the 1970s ""hipness"" begins.  Dated, yeah, but, at least it's the way it was originally aired.

After the awful and unforgiveable debacle with what CBS/Paramount did to The Fugitive Season 2 Vol. 1, we're all scrutinously skeptical of anything they put to DVD.  Let's hope they decide to make good for how they've disappointed us all with The Fugitive.  Maybe they'll re-do that set right.  Or maybe they'll drop the whole rest of that excellent series.

As ""The Beatles"" modified their music to suit the times, Mission Impossible morphed in to the psychedelic '70's as well.  This season has a very contemporary theme for its time while still carrying the intrigue of its core mantra.

My one star deduction is that the DVD's are NOT picture discs as with the first four season set releases.  Continuing on with picture discs would have been nice with the addition of two new members to the IMF.  The discs are a plain gray, identical to 'The Untouchables' discs.

3495862,4,B001BN4WI6,"This season feels like a departure from the previous ones. Even setting aside the introduction of a cute but unconvincing Lesley (Ann) Warren and an insipid Sam Elliot, the flavor of the show is completely different. Overnight, the style and flair of the 1960s is replaced by the tacky squares-trying-to-be-hip feel of almost every early 1970s show. That aspect is so fake that it comes out almost as comedic. In counterbalance, this season introduces shrewd and intelligent enemies who pose a real challenge to the team instead of being ineffectual dupes who fall for every trick in the book. In turn, the IMF team is no longer perfect. They make mistakes and unforeseen events throw monkey wrenches into their complicated plans. The combination of competent villains and imperfect heroes makes the show a lot more interesting and less two-dimensional than the earlier seasons.

Also gone is the selection of the team from a list of potential candidates at the beginning of each episode. Apparently, Jim Phelps realized what the audience picked up on a few years before him: he's always going to pick the same people, so why go through the motions? This is reflected in the interactions between the team members. No longer are they assumed to be relative strangers from different walks of life who are brought together for a mission, but they're shown ""hanging out"" together in their spare time.
