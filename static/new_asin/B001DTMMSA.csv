3539279,5,B001DTMMSA,"An Innocent Man is the colorized version of Sagebrush Trail.

An Innocent Man is one of the infamous Lone Star B-Western films that typified the early stages of John Wayne's career.  Featuring no budget, sometimes off-kilter sound and the occasional gaffe, the B-Western ""genre"" is intimately familiar to even the youngest of audiences, thanks to generations of successful copying by and integration into mainstream pop-culture and cinema.  What I'm sure many of you might find surprising is that these limitations often bring out the best of Hollywood--location shots are the norm instead of bland studios or abundant CGI, and stuntmen (or actors performing their own stunts ala Wayne) are actually employed to the fullest extent of their ability in order to create drama and visual excitement.  Maybe I'm just jaded by the dross that is ""modern filmmaking,"" but the fact that the B-movies of yesterday outshine their modern rivals says something.  The classics are far from dead.

Obviously the highlight of this particular title (other than a name change that more directly conveys the conventional plot) is Legend Films' added color.  Although the film's appearance obviously isn't up to today's standards (it is nearly eighty years old), the color is as good if not better than first generation full-color films, and manages to look completely natural despite its decades-later addition.  Even by this standard, the added color dramatically changes the way that you view the film, making An Innocent Man a unique experience for even the most seasoned Wayne fan.

Another great feature of this re-mastered film is all the bonus material that they include.  Special features certainly weren't the norm in the `30s, and they certainly weren't for earlier VHS iterations of Sagebrush Trail.  This disc includes vintage Wayne commercials and trailers and several short features about Wayne, his movies and the Western genre itself.  Also worthy of a mention is a trivia game that would test the mental mettle of even the most seasoned Wayne fan.",1228176000,,2045,5.201219512195122

8294839,4,B001DTMMSA,"Another decent early John Wayne film.  Again the added color and sounds seem a bit off, but don't really damage the viewing experience.  I seem to recall that these films had their own music, and I'm unsure if the new score is simply a rerecording of the old music, or whether some of these films didn't have music, but either way it's a pretty good film with a pretty good story.

Again, they just don't make them like this anymore.  This is essentially a one off TV like one-hour film that was probably billed with a couple other films when it was in the theatres all those decades ago.  The film making style is fairly basic, in fact kind of primitive, but respectable enough, and the story is again good basic fare that'll hook most people.

Dealing with the waning period of the ""old west"", Wayne's character seeks out the man who framed him by infiltrating a gang in some nondescript section of the midwest.

You know, before TV and movies went off their rocker and decided to preach through social psychology, films used to be pretty straight forward.  This is one of them.

Give it a shot and see what you think.",1505520000,,1120,4.477832512315271

8294841,5,B001DTMMSA,"If you like old John Wayne westerns, I think you will enjoy watching him in this 'young John' movie.  I also think they did a great job in adding color to this classic 1930s film.  I'm sure I would have liked it in black and white too, but I think the color enhanced it.",1502582400,,270,3.9814814814814814

8294847,5,B001DTMMSA,"I loved this film not just because I am a huge John Wayne fan (as is my husband), but the colorization made an already great film into a fabulous film worth catching. I would compare this as when everyone saw The Wizard of Oz, and when the film changed went from black and white to spectacular colorization, the film takes on a whole new life--very vibrant. This was so much fun to watch, and a family friendly film (though the toddlers won't understand, but the older kids will).",1396483200,,480,4.465909090909091
