7035955,4,B00UCBOV5W,"This film knows that you know that found footage films are not real. It has a wry sense of humor and the characters are in fine form in order to take you on an entertaining ride. There are some fun unexpected twists along the way, which do carry some weight because the one thing you can say about this film is that the characters are likable and that you care about what happens to them regardless of their outlandish circumstances. This is no mean feat because the downfall of many films, in this relatively new genre, is that you just don't give a $%^& about the characters and you want them to die as soon as possible. Of course there is always someone you love to hate and cant wait to see them offed. Check that box. Done. There is one of those here as well. Also there is a lot of creative use of the camera by the director, which also keeps the pace moving forward as the story heads to satisfying found footage kind of way. Tough how abrupt these stories have to end. After all its not very often the villains pick up the camera and then turn it into their story. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised.",1444694400,5,1109,4.285714285714286
7035956,5,B00UCBOV5W,"The Warning is about an aspiring reporter wanting to make a name for herself who returns home and takes a camping trip with two old high school friends to investigate reports that Colorado Springs is the Satanist capital of the world.  Re-uniting with her former best friend and old boyfriend they deal with their complicated love triangle while they investigate possible satan worshiping locations.  The Warning is a fun, amusing and clever found footage film with great twists and good scares.  Shot on location and shows the work of the compelling actress Summer Moore.",1443225600,2,572,5.0638297872340425
7035957,1,B00UCBOV5W,the movie is bad the acting was well bad. About the facts on the movie it self I don't know of anything that would say that  around Springs area has devil worshipping. In Oklahoma City the devil worshipers wanted to put a pentagram next to the ten commandments at the capital. so the over all ratting was very poor.,1433894400,3,315,4.338983050847458
7035958,2,B00UCBOV5W,"Well first off, the 20 something, most over the top character in this fiasco (Summer Moore) is actually 39 nines years old which becomes immediately noticeable when actually with her two 20 something co-stars. It's as iff they took a marginal script and just told everyone involved to over act every line and do it all in one take. There's no suspense, there's no scares, and there's no skin. The reason I gave it two stars is because it's not as bad as as so many of the other garage made films listed in this genre.",1485648000,,517,4.395833333333333
7035959,4,B00UCBOV5W,"It was a good effort and had some interesting, (and humorous), moments. The twist at the end, though somewhat obvious, was well placed. I must admit that I almost stopped watching a few times, but I'm glad I kept watching until the end.  For me it provided a good laugh at the end, to others it might not.  I would suggest that if one has a good imagination and an appreciation for independent, ""found footage"", films with a shoestring budget, to give it a chance.",1485475200,4,464,4.447058823529412

7035964,2,B00UCBOV5W,"Yet another supposedly ""real life lost film footage"" Movie that is just totally preposterous. The acting was 1/2 way o.k. for these types but so slow moving I had to wake my husband up more than once. When will they stop trying to convince us we are watching ""Police Evidence"" of missing ppl then show the ACTORS in the cast?",1484352000,,325,4.433333333333334

7035975,3,B00UCBOV5W,"Okay.... so it was a little lame.... it wasn't the WORST I've seen on Amazon Prime for free, but it definitely circles the toilet bowl. I ended up watching it to the end (while doing dinner dishes, and hiding Christmas gifts...it wasn't so bad, but it definitely wasn't so ""GOOD"" either. If you have some time you're trying to kill, it's worth watch, but otherwise...I wouldn't recommend it.",1481328000,5,391,4.764705882352941

I can name two other movies that the kids pushing a car come on whatever happen to real horror movies, ready to just rewatch old eighty horror at least you saw and got a thrill for the kill.
