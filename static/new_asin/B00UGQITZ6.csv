8706739,4,B00UGQITZ6,"Schindlers List is a movie, which is based on the novel titled Schindlers Ark that portrays the challenges that the Jews faced in the hands of the Nazis. In this case, the director, Steven Spielberg, uses various techniques to create a similar setting to the World War II that gives all the specific elements that occurred at that time. The movie is insightful due to the themes addressed that looks at the life in the concentration camps and suffering from the harassment of the Nazi soldiers. Most importantly, Spielberg focuses on showing the role that Schindler plays in saving the innocent Jews that were at the risk of being attacked. Given that Schindler was a German and used that opportunity to save the Jews shows the risk that he was taking. Portraying the challenges that the Jews encountered illustrates a historical perspective of the issues that the minorities experienced during that time. It gives deeper insights into the World War II and the holocaust because Schindler persuades the Nazi soldiers from taking the Jews to Auschwitz concentration camp (Spielberg, 1993). The fact that Schindler used his money to move the Jews and even offered them jobs reveal how he did not consider the hate that was projected towards the Jews. Instead, he wanted to save them from the misery that they were facing. The visuals and sound play an instrumental role in capturing the emotions of the Jews and the Germans. For instance, the Jews are shown walking on a road dejected and uncertain of their future. By the roadside, the Germans are seen insulting and using every derogatory phrase while throwing dirt and snow on them (Spielberg, 1993). The scene illustrates the anger and the hate that the Germans portrayed on the innocent Jews due to the fact that Hitler had ordered that they should be killed. The depiction of the various events that occurred during that time can be uses as educational materials for the students. In summary, the movie talks about the emotional challenges that the Jews dealt experienced at the hands of the Nazi soldiers.",1522281600,,2060,4.9054441260744985
