8373979,4,B002MPQII4,"I discovered this program years ago, when it aired on cable.  I'd recorded it on video cassette, but when everything switched over to DVD, I couldn't find it for sale anywhere.  In my desperation, I even bombarded the company that distributed the movie BARRY LYNDON with the suggestion that for any possible re-release, it include this program as a DVD extra.

My need to go to such extremes ended when I located this DVD.  Hosted by Marissa Berenson (the BARRY LYNDON connection; the movie is also mentioned in this program) and featuring the late Diana Vreeland, this tie-in with a Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition of the same title is an interesting program, covering fashion from the years of the Sun King to the French Revolution, with Catherine the Great and Abigail Adams focused on in between.  The initial sound quality wavered, but after the first couple of minutes it was fine.  The film quality is what you'd find in a nearly 30-year-old program that hasn't been digitally restored, but the content -- including on-location filming at places like Versailles and at the Adams home in Braintree -- more than compensates.  I couldn't be happier.
