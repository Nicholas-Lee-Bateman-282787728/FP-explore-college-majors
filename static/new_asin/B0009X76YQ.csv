2334026,4,B0009X76YQ,"This DVD, along with its sister volumes covering the 1939-1941 and 1944-45 periods, provide excellent video footage on the U-Boat war. Most of this footage consists of German newsreels so it provides a perspective intended to diplomatically intimidate outside of Germany and to garner support for the war effort and the Nazi Party within Germany. As a result one sees plenty of video footage that is quite unrealistic but very impressive (i.e., a flotilla of u-boats working a few hundred yards from each other in open seas, etc.). Needless to say, a good deal of this is not very realistic. However, much of the footage provides good footage of vessels being sunk, life on board the vessels, refueling from submarine tankers and even the application of a manned helicopter being launched from the deck of a u-boat). In addition, there is footage of surface craft also. Much of this would be of interest to not only the novice, but the knowledgeable viewer also.

The video not only has good film footage but is fairly informative (at least for the novice), even though the voice over is in a very dull British accent. Not only is the history of the boats recounted but there is good analysis regarding their strenghts, weaknesses per se as well as factors affecting the u-boat arm in general (i.e., deterioration in crew training and quality, slow development of boats superior to type VII and IXs [i.e., type XXIs], etc.). All and all quite informative. Far more so than documentaries one would normally see on the topic on History, Discovery or Military Channels in the U.S.",1265673600,4,1577,4.862453531598513
2334027,5,B0009X76YQ,"This the second in a series of three DVDs deals with the start of the Battle of the Atlantic and the ""Happy Times""  Lots of good footage taken on various Uboats at sea....good narration provides lots of good information.....enjoyed this very much.",1235001600,4,247,4.880952380952381
2334028,4,B0009X76YQ,"Covers the critical years of the UBoat activity in the Battle of the Atlantic, during the time where the tide was turning as the entry of the United States into the war brought technology and industrial strength to bear against the German submarine forces.",1194825600,,256,4.840909090909091
2334029,4,B0009X76YQ,"The Grey Wolves series is all black & white news reels filmed by the Germans during WWII. These news reels would normally be played to the general German public in movie theaters, etc.  The program lasts around one hour. While this program runs, you see the footage which is in German, while an English speaking person talks about what you are watching. Over the English talking, you can still hear, just barely, German being spoken in the background.

I'm a big WWII buff & I have watched a ton of WWII programs. 99% of GW:1942-1943 I have never seen before.

I enjoyed GW '42-'43 a lot more than GW: '39-'41. The '42-'43 deals a lot with the U-Boat Campaign off the United States.  GW: '39-'41 deals with a lot of the end of WWI and post WWI U-Boat upgrades and development.",1167523200,14,776,4.4822695035460995

8069300,5,B0009X76YQ,"Reall footage taken way back when. You get to see some of the action as if you were actually there some 50+ years ago. Interesting to see how young some of the players were, and captain of a U-boat as well.",1426982400,2,206,4.048780487804878

8069303,4,B0009X76YQ,"I am not sure I would call it the Definitive Guide to the German U-Boats of World War II, but it is a nice set.  A total of three DVDs, cover the submarine development of the Great War, all the way to 1945 and the end of the Second War.  The DVDs, using footage from the time period, allows us to examine the subs, their captains and crew, and the tactics used by their owners.  It covers some of the major turning points in the war, some of the issues this branch of the service had, both within the government and with the allies, but it is a tad light on the details.  I would have enjoyed more information on the daily life, how the equipment worked, break down of the crew and their functions, so on.  If you are fan of the other War Archive DVD sets I would suggest this but only if you have a interest in the Naval operations of the war.  Otherwise you may wish to skip it or get a thick book on the subject.  Even at 180 minutes it still feels unfinished.",1367971200,2,963,4.063492063492063
