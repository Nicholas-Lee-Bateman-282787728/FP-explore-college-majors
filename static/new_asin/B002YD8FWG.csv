4013034,1,B002YD8FWG,"I understand this was low budget, but it looks like it was filmed with an iphone. I tried very hard to find something worthwhile in this.  The characters were totally unlikeable and the plot proceded like continental drift.  I shut it off and deleted it 1/4 through.",1426550400,,266,4.638297872340425

8384152,1,B002YD8FWG,"This is comparable to a movie 6th graders made for drama class.  Makes no sense, lighting is terrible, acting is...  well, like 6th grade.  This would be a great film for the Mystery Science Theatre gang to get hold of.",1513641600,,219,4.425
8384153,1,B002YD8FWG,"SAVAGED (2008) begins w/ two headless people leaving their home for a trip. Enter Maria Longosi (Debbie Rochon), who has arrived to watch the couple's dog, named Lotus (Valkrie Liquori). Once Lotus introduces herself, the two have many long conversations, and share a peanut butter sandwich. Then, it's time for... a walk! Lotus smells something. We know this by the strange flatulence that seems to occur. Back inside, more human / canine chatting takes place. Maria really opens up to Lotus, like, Oprah-style! The talk takes a turn into ""eww"" territory. Lotus tries to stay awake, desperately pretending to be interested. Now, it descends into Dr. Phil-land. Should Maria smoke a cigarette? Lotus does her business out back. Maria makes a phone call, while she unpacks. Lotus is somewhere sleeping, if she's lucky. A backstory about an eeevil ex-boyfriend is established. Lotus checks in to see if there's still a movie going on. Should Maria read a book? She takes a nap instead. The doorbell rings. Is something exciting about to happen? No. It's the twelve year old sheriff. Two sheriffs. One w/ a beard. Humans! Talking! Together! Back in the house, there's that odd farting noise again! Very mysterious. Maria finds a revolver. I break the fifth wall, as I beg her to point it at the camera and shoot me in the forehead! Maria's mom calls to let her know that a bear is running loose in the area. Lotus groans. Is she the source of that gaseous sound? Maria turns talking to herself into a pastime. She takes a lovely bubble bath. Another phone call. Another talk w/ mom. Lotus looks forlorn. Dear god, make something, anything interesting happen!  Please? God?? Do you even exist? Lotus says, ""no"". Out back for a smoke. Huge, bear-like growls echo through the yard. Perhaps it's the homeowners, back to find their heads. Where's Lotus? I guess she's had enough. The cops return, w/ the bearded one's face so red, that it looks as though his head got stuck in a bread-maker! Another talk w/ mom. If there were a god, he / she / it would have already sent the lightning. I mean, I should be ashes by now! But, nooo, I'm still watching this! The bearded tomato sheriff returns for... a chat. Maria could be in peril, as the eeevil boyfriend appears to be lurking about. Time for a cigarette, followed by more nothingness. Then, the not-so surprising ""finale"". UN-FUN FACTS: #1- Waiting for the ""finale"" of this movie, is like waiting for a bus at an extremely dull bus stop. #2- Witnessing the ""finale"" is like watching another chat between Maria and tomato man. Oh, that's just what happens! Nope, no god. No god at all...",1512518400,4,2630,4.74235807860262
8384154,1,B002YD8FWG,"This had to be one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. The acting was horrendous, everyone was terrible.  I kept fast forwarding in hopes that it would get better it never did. This was a waste of film and money to make. If I could give it a minus zero I would.",1510531200,,268,3.8727272727272726
8384155,5,B002YD8FWG,"An intimate movie, heartfelt and moody. Excellent performance by Debbie Rochon, one of her best. Story line was simple and engaging. Glad I saved this flick for Halloween night.",1509408000,,177,5.137931034482759
8384156,3,B002YD8FWG,It's a B movie which I love!  Dog was adorable. I don't expect great acting in B movies but actress was ok.  Quality of video was eh otherwise I would have given it a 4. I loved the credits at the end. I think better quality video and audio would have made it better.,1506816000,,267,3.925925925925926
8384157,3,B002YD8FWG,Everyone was pretty much right about this movie. It's not even really ok. But that dog is so cool and I love dogs so much well .... that's my soft spot. big dogs.,1506556800,,162,3.9393939393939394

8384159,2,B002YD8FWG,"Strangely enough it held my attention. I kept waiting for the maul attack by the animals though! Totally misleading. I do, however, give the movie an 'A' for effort. But, I agree with the other reviews.",1504396800,,202,4.638888888888889
8384160,2,B002YD8FWG,Horrible! Horrible acting! The only reason I'm giving it two stars is the dog is adorable. It is hard to imagine that dog being vicious in the first place. I just wanted to give it a big hug!,1497484800,,191,4.052631578947368
