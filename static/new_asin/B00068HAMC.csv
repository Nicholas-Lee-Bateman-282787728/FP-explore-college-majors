8040426,5,B00068HAMC,"I purchased this video for a child, thinking it was a selection of Muppet Babies episodes, but instead it is Kermit narrating a story with images from a storybook. I had assumed they didn't mean storybook as literal; however, that is my fault for not doing enough research on the video. I was unaware there had been a storybook series released to video. With all that being said, it was definitely an enjoyable video and had some funny comments from Kermit, including his impression of Animal. It took me back to my childhood when these type of video storybooks (no moving characters, but rather a moving camera) were popular.

Most of the stories were read in a very calm tone, so I think this video would be perfect for kids to watch when settling down for a nap. I really appreciated the values in some of the stories, such as the one about Gonzo trying to find out ""what"" he is. The moral was Gonzo being Gonzo is enough, which is basically the same moral of the Fozzie trying to be Kermit story.

I sincerely hope that some company in the future will put up the finance and effort needed to release the entire Muppet Babies series on dvd. There is a high demand for it, and I'm certain any costs and frustration in obtaining the large amount of copyright permissions would be worth the profits from the dvd sales.",1433376000,,1318,4.4875
