6497594,5,B00LOWT56S,This is the most important series you can share with your friends and family.  Climate change isn't a hot button issue; it's not a liberal cause or a tree hugger fantasy.  This is the biggest challenge we face as a civilization and it will affect the lives of everyone on the planet in some way - large or small.,1408579200,51,312,4.271186440677966
6497595,5,B00LOWT56S,"Incredible series.  I have followed this issue closely but learned so much from this series.  It is a great educational resource, its an intense example of story telling, of the real world application of science and top level journalism.  Definitely worth getting access to this series.",1408492800,66,286,5.173913043478261
6497596,5,B00LOWT56S,"It's about time Hollywood told the unvarnished, non-airbrushed, upsetting truth about global warming -- what it's doing to us now, and -- this is the hard part the sponsors won't like -- what it's going to do to us real soon if we don't get it under control. Buyer beware: this series is unsettling because it's real. It'll make you mad and scared. I wish every decision-maker, consumer, investor, politician and young person on the planet would see this and then take action. We are way behind, with little time to get ahead of this unfolding catastrophe. Thank you to all who participated and to Showtime for making it happen.",1408406400,82,628,4.718181818181818
6497597,5,B00LOWT56S,"How good is ""Years of Living Dangerously""? It won the Emmy for ""Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series"" -- beating out ""Cosmos,"" which was itself awesome TV!

This show is for you, if you are at all interested in climate change or just great TV from  some of the greatest storytellers in Hollywood working with  former 60 Minutes producers who have 18 Emmys between them (not counting the most recent Emmy).",1408406400,61,413,4.871428571428571
6497598,5,B00LOWT56S,I had watched a few episodes of this series before I bought the boxed set. Some episodes are critical to my work in Sustainability. I am so glad I bought it.,1457308800,,157,4.096774193548387

6497604,5,B00LOWT56S,"If you are interested in the very human side of the Climate Change debate, you will enjoy this series. It tells the stories of various people who are affected by the changes in weather patterns in the world today. Well known personalities look into the facts and interview people from all walks of life. I was particularly interested in this series because I am a fan of Ian Somerhalder (star of television's The Vampire Diaries) who started  the Ian Somerhalder Foundation. Their foundation seeks to educate and therefore activate and empower young and old to protect our planet and all of the creatures in it. Ian interviews a father and daughter with opposing views about climate change in Episode 4. You will also see Harrison Ford and Matt Damon featured.",1441238400,,760,4.846153846153846

6497606,5,B00LOWT56S,"I am a scientist, but I teach to non-science majors about science. This film will definitely go in our to be watched series in this course. I don't have children but I can see the impacts of climate change every day and my students who are the future voters, parents, and consumers need to know what's happening in the US and around the world. This film hits with an emotional impact, which is what people need to see. Recommend following this up with viewing the new DVD ""Merchants of Doubt"" that explains how the anti-science think tanks, politicians, and fossil fuel industry (plus the tobacco industry lobbyists) have been so successful at casting doubt that global warming is real and man-made. Now, get out there and do something about it folks!",1441152000,4,751,4.740458015267175

6497611,5,B00LOWT56S,"This is one of the most important documentary series you will ever watch.  Climate change is happening now despite the denials that are fostered by propaganda from the fossil fuel industry's ""think tanks"".  This series clearly details how climate change imperils our country, our planet, and the very future of the human race. It shows how and why there is such a lack of political will to address this critical issue.  We are in the middle of the sixth mass extinction and we are the cause.  Our forests and seas which produce the oxygen we breathe are under assault.  Our forests are disappearing from exploitation, drought, pests, and fires.  The oceans' life forms provide more than half our oxygen but are at threat from increased warming and 30% more acidity.  The oxygen content of the atmosphere was about 20% a half cantury ago.  In some areas it is now reduced to a little more than 12% (typically in urban and industrial areas) with health consequences for populations in the vicinity.  For every increase of one degree in temperature, crop yields are projected to drop by 10%.  This may be an optimistic estimate since California is now experiencing a drought of historic proportions and California provides half our fruits and vegetables.  There are reports of severe weather events in the news multiple times per week.  Most land areas are drying up and sea levels are rising.  Due to the increased moisture in the air, storms are more severe and prone to cause flooding.  Ice at both poles and all glaciers are melting faster than previously projected and sea levels will rise at least 20 feet for certain with the current melting; and if all ice melts, the oceans will rise 200 feet.  This series will motivate you to get involved and take action and hopefully help recruit your friends who'd like to ""stick their heads in the sand"" and ignore the problem.  The only question is whether the future will be difficult - or impossible.  Stay ignorant and ignore this at your peril.",1426982400,,1994,4.783625730994152

6497621,5,B00LOWT56S,"I've been concerned about the state of our planet for well over 40 years since I read, ""The Population Bomb"", by Dr. Paul Ehrlich. He explained AND accurately predicted what will take place in the next 50 years from when it was written back in the late 60's if I'm not mistaken. This program will drop your jaw if you pay it any attention at all. Whats going to happen is inevitable. Plus you'll see how a particular political party views the issue's. Believe what you want, but the old saying,""He who dies with the most toys wins"", shows just how stupid that saying is if EVERYONE loses due to greed. You can laugh if you will at the funny guy standing on the soap box with a sign reading,""The world is coming to the end"", but who will get the last laugh is up to us. An amazing show, that hopefully will make you think twice about what YOU can do to help save our planet. I remember George Carlin the comedian once said,""Everyone keeps saying SAVE THE PLANET, SAVE THE PLANET, but we should just be worried about saving ourselves, the planet will be back to it's original state in time. It may take a million years to do so, but once we are gone, we're gone for good!""",1421539200,,1170,4.298642533936651

6497624,1,B00LOWT56S,"Garbage in, garbage out.  There is so much supposition and false associations through the shows I have made myself watch that I can take almost none of what is presented as truth.  There is mounting evidence that the premise of this series is wrong, and I do not buy what they are selling here.",1418428800,3,294,4.425925925925926

6497632,5,B00LOWT56S,"This is by far the best attempt to explain climate change and its effects that I've ever seen.  Each episode follows two aspects of climate change as it applies to different parts of the world, and how information about information about climate change is represented and misrepresented by different parties.  The stories in each episode are not chosen at random - they complement each other well, often as ""cause"" and ""effect.""  Deforestation complements drought, burning coal vs. ocean acidification, changes in wind direction vs. temperature rise.  The final episode includes an interview with President Obama.",1412467200,6,613,5.421052631578948

Uncomfortable realizations, such as palm and coffee impacts, normally kept under the rug, are exposed in this brave film. This series gave me hope.",1410393600,7,448,5.323943661971831

6497643,5,B00LOWT56S,"A brilliant and necessary document; this series brings the highest production values, and the most engaged political actors, journalists, and artists, to deepen our understanding of what climate change is already doing to our world & how profound its effects will be in the coming decades. I really appreciate the way this show focuses on human stories, on the complexity of cultural, religious, and practical responses, and on the many ways that people are working to come to terms with the changes we ALL must make. Information rich and emotionally moving; this is best series on the topic. Every lawmaker, every college and high school teacher AND student, every community leader, every activist, every business owner, every journalist, every artist in any medium should see this series. Are we going to respond to the greatest threat and opportunity humanity has ever faced, or are we going to zone out until the floodwaters reach our doors?",1410393600,6,945,5.103225806451613
6497644,5,B00LOWT56S,"This is OUR story. There will be no place to hide, the Earth's climate brings ALL PEOPLE -- rich and poor, first world and third world -- under the same sky.  Good enough to be fiction -- but it's today's reality and a peek at the future if we let the dinosaur fossil-fuel industries keep up business as usual.  Everyone should be informed, spread the word, and face the truth.  Oil was great but it's time for human society to take the next big leap forward with renewable clean energy.  Our water, our air, our arable land all depend on it.  Otherwise it's game over for our first-world lifestyle.  Let's take this crisis as an opportunity to move humanity forward, not cling to the dead ways of the past, but embrace a much better, happier, healthier, more prosperous and secure future.  It is within our reach.  This series really shows the fork in the road, the decisions we are making each day.  Choose wisely.",1410393600,6,916,4.536585365853658

I am very interested in seeing all the seasons too. Thank you for coming up with a series, and not just a 2 hour movie. I want to be aware of the many changes the earth is going through and what some people are doing to prolong its life and be good stewards of it.

 I am a Christian and believe this documentary confirms what the Bible said would happen to the earth in latter times. Present generations are witnessing the fulfilment of holy scriptures.

But, we gathered every Sunday, a group of 5 to 10 women friends, shared a delicious pot luck dinner, and hunkered down to watch together and then to discuss and rally around how we might bring our collective voice to solutions, since we were and are: a Permaculture Designer working on a 260-acre Regenerative Design Farm & Community and Native Forest, a Carbon Drawdown Solutions expert, an Environmental Studies and BioChar student, a successful business woman with decades of experience, an organic diverse farmer, a holistic organic whole foods chef and health educator, and a gluten-free Baker Student. This series gave us something to chew on, to consider how to bring inspirational media through in real stories, and I pray we get to that.

6497670,5,B00LOWT56S,This series does an excellent job in presenting this crucial information so that the public can understand what is at stake for our future.  The information is well researched and the presenters are obviously passionate about the topic as well as committed to inspiring action.  The diversity of issues presented keeps interest keen.  High production quality is evident throughout.,1410220800,8,381,5.423728813559322
6497671,5,B00LOWT56S,"Love this series. Incredible storytelling, and I learned so much. The stories have really stayed with me, and it's been some weeks since I've watched. The producers aimed to breathe life and stories to the real-life issue of climate change ""happening now"" and ""affecting people"" and are very successful.  The series takes you from NYC to TX to CA and around the world to Indonesia, Antarctica, Bangladesh, with noted correspondents and 'celebrity' correspondents  (the latter doing a great job despite this not being their profession - either have a natural bent for reporting, or got a lot of training before hitting the road). The series very much deserves the Emmy it received.  And for more info nice write up here in new york times from april 2014: http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/07/showtime-series-aims-to-engage-sleepy-public-on-climate-change-with-celebrity-guides/?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A7%22%7D",1410220800,7,951,6.4140625
6497672,5,B00LOWT56S,"I watched this series as it unfolded on Showtime. It is the singular most important television serial to date. It won an Emmy, and ya, that's great and all, but the real importance is more stark: if the governments of the world do not start to take this and other news like it to heart, there is no future. End of story. Please watch it, and share it, if not for you, then for your children.

6497675,5,B00LOWT56S,"This is the best series I have ever seen on the multifaceted subject of climate change. It is smartly written, easily understood, undeniable in its impact and well presented by the celebrity hosts. It bears repeated watching. Anyone who watches it will be moved and motivated to do something. It is terrifying to consider that we may well be close to or even past a significant tipping point where natural restorative equilibrium is not possible. What kind of world are we giving our children where corporate greed and drill baby drill matters more than the complete destruction of our planet? Buy this set and watch it with your family and your friends. I sincerely hope there will be a season 2.

6497680,5,B00LOWT56S,"I watched all nine hours of this on Showtime. Some of it was distressing to watch; but all should watch it. I think what we all need from this is an update. Now there is a plethora of documentaries for and against any number of issues. When this series was being collected and not yet ready for viewing the data would have been at least five years old for some of the issues presented. Given how fast the media picks up on hot topics and the UN is about to issue yet another study on how bad CO2 is, please update the data shown in this series. Tell if factually, what was presented before, what has changed since and present the data with compelling stories any age can understand. The Ocean acidification is definitely very bad and worsening but few understand this or why it should be important. What they also need more of is the air quality data presented near the gas wells neither the local, state, or federal EPA has a handle on how bad that is. Someone also needs to look into why drilling companies are not required to add a marker that indicates when they've violated an undisturbed aquifer. Take this country back from the big oil and gas companies as a former Army General has just demanded this week! Google that phrase, you'll find it.",1410220800,11,1250,4.439130434782609

In my opinion we have an obligation to watch shows like this and to educate ourselves on the reality of what is happening right now all around us, and get involved in whatever way we can. What I really loved the most about this series is that it gave me hope for the future, which is not an easy task considering the subject matter. It calls for us to open our eyes, see what is happening, and then be inspired to start thinking about how we can contribute to a solution. Plus I loved Harrison Ford going all Indiana Jones on Sumatra's Minister of Forestry. Totally rocked my world :)",1410220800,12,705,4.3893129770992365

And if you ARE, you'll be grateful and energized by this incredibly in-depth coverage, not only reminding us of the science and the politics, but bringing both up-to-the minute with the latest datla and investigations across the globe.

But the most groundbreaking aspect in YOLD is the truly international scope of stories of diverse people, communities, and environments who are being crushed by the oncoming wave of climate change threats. And pf course it doesn't hurt to have major star power doing the reporting, especially if it brings new eyes and ears to the audience.

God built this wonderful planet for us and gave us animals, shelter and so forth its our job to show him how much we appreciate his gift by taking care of it.
