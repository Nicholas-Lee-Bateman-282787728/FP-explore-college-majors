4708784,4,B005IAAQN8,"what a great documentary. touching, informative and honest.  i respect chaz for putting everything out there for this film.
however,  that she devil of a girlfriend made watching this almost unbearable.",1418860800,,202,5.483870967741935
4708785,5,B005IAAQN8,"Helped me understand Chaz,s issues with gender identity.",1416700800,,56,6.125
4708786,5,B005IAAQN8,It is a real story about someone who goes through a transgender operation. It is not only about the surgical procedures but the emotional transition as well.,1395014400,2,157,4.851851851851852
4708787,1,B005IAAQN8,I gave this a 1star rating because I did not like some of the stuff they recorded. like the surgery. that could have been left out. I love sunny and Cher. Even cher had to get use of this change. I only rented this movie cause my mom is cher crazy.,1385164800,,248,3.8823529411764706
4708788,2,B005IAAQN8,"Having watched cute little Chastity on the Sonny and Cher show I wanted to check out this new state of things. To hear him tell his story in his own words.  I fully believe that anybody/everybody should be who they want to be...be who they ARE.  But I think I felt a bit like his mother feels... off balance. This is such a HUGE change it's disconcerting. Not my business, though. I hope Chaz has a happy life.  One thing I took away from watching this documentary was how ""regular"" famous people are!  What do you know, they're just like the rest of us work-a-day folk!  I was kind of surprised.",1375833600,,596,4.333333333333333
4708789,5,B005IAAQN8,"I had watched this once before on a movie channel on tv and found it fascinating. Chaz is very frank about his experience and brings you into his life to follow his journey. He does not color coat the experience, nor the relationship hardships the change caused. I did find it odd, however, that he introduces a 5 year old that went through a sex change and the support group for children facing sex re-assignment.

All in all, a very brave exposure of his life.",1372291200,,462,4.435294117647059
4708790,4,B005IAAQN8,"As a straight guy who just heard a bit here and there about Sonny and Cher's daughter, or is it now son, or...whatever, I was pretty interested in this whole transgender thing, I wondered how someone could get to the point where they would make such a drastic change in their life and their identity.

I found Chastity/Chaz to be very likeable and appreciated the honesty in this documentary. Nothing is left unaddressed by Chastity/Chaz this documentary. Sex, relationships with its significant other and it's mom, Cher. However, once that is addressed, I really find Chastity/Chaz to be quite boring. I'm not sure what Chastity/Chaz does all day other than talking about Cher and how being a tranny isn't easy. Does it work a real job or just leech off of her parents cashola? I do end up feeling pretty bad for Chastity/Chaz's girlfriend. She seems to be very nice and as understanding as possible that her girlfriend is about to become a trannyfriend. I refuse to say boyfriend because there's no penis, so that would not be correct.

I am all for equal rights. It's no ones business who you marry or what you have in your pants and how you use it in your bedroom. I applaud Chastity/Chaz for being open and honest and exposing this world to many people who are unfamiliar.",1339200000,2,1277,4.671111111111111
4708791,5,B005IAAQN8,I'm a 39 year old FTM and learned a lot by watching Becoming Chaz. I have been on T for over 2 years but found this to be very helpful.,1320796800,5,135,3.533333333333333
4708792,4,B005IAAQN8,"Interesting documentary about Chastity Bono's sex change to become Chaz
Bono. It deals well with the complexities of life for both the
transgendered, and for the children of very famous people.

Quite touching and informative, it makes the still uneasy and confusing
(for many) subject of sex re-assignment far more human, and
understandable on both a technical (how does it work?) and - more
important - emotional level.

It also doesn't shy away from the hard parts (e.g. the difficult
personality changes brought on in Chaz by his intense hormone therapy).
Chaz is allowed to look self-centered, and even like a jerk at times,
without it impeding on our sympathy or identification.  He's just a
person, like all of us, which is the whole point.

While the film-making itself can be uneven, this is the kind of film
that helps people open their hearts and minds to those who seem
'different'. And that is always a worthwhile thing.",1315180800,10,933,4.886075949367089
8474436,5,B005IAAQN8,"I couldn't help but like Chaz, this video was also produced well by Chaz, and the resolutions the family members made are an interesting start of a new life; and the love he drew to himself; maybe I'll make the transition so I can become a local success story, but at my age it probably wouldn't matter. I've avoided Chaz life and remember when she came out; I had no idea she was transgender. i said was because he is obviously a man. Wow, what a story. Now with gay marriage legal single people could marry a man to be their wife or a woman to be their husband, Lol. It's all more free. Chaz's personality is real interesting and entertaining. I just couldn't help but like Chaz. I recommend this to open minded people and especially to closed minded people.  Chaz's humanity is brought out in this doc. Cher's appearnces are exciting, what a wonderful lady. I love this movie.",1512345600,,879,4.459627329192546
8474437,5,B005IAAQN8,Excellent documentary on transgender issues and Chaz journey from Chastity to Chaz.  It has the element of celebrity because of Sonny and Cher but the intimacy of Chaz's journey.  Everyone should watch this!,1505692800,,207,5.242424242424242

8474444,5,B005IAAQN8,"Amazing film. He's a good and inspiring man. The dynamic of he and Jenny's relationship is tough to watch, but unequivocally realistic of the troubles all couples face, let alone those in such a peculiar situation.

Worth a watch.",1456617600,,230,4.897435897435898
8474445,4,B005IAAQN8,"This movie was really interesting. Very honest and down-to-earth account that sheds light on some aspects of hormonal transitioning (its effect on intimate relationships) that you might never have thought about. I really liked Chaz and the girlfriend, whose name I can't remember. Very genuine. He is right when he says, ""I am not a celebrity"" and it's refreshing.",1433548800,,364,5.186440677966102
