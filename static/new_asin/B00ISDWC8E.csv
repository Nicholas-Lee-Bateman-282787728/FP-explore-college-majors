8645017,5,B00ISDWC8E,"This review was sent to the producers when the DVD was first released.  It was written by Hank Nothhaft, son-in-law of Capt. Roy M. ""Butch"" Voris

"" feel you have captured the essence of why the Blue Angels have been such a great success and the importance of the team concept in their make-up.
I was moved by Butch's interviews and the skillful manner that they were weaved into the team's current state of eminence.
The emotional impact was significant as well.  I must say it moved me a great deal, particularly the skillful manner on which you went full circle to Butch at the end of the video.""
