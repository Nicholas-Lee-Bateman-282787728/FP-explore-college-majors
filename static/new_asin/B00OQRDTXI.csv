The trailer looks very interesting. I have read the book and it made sense to buy the movie.

I missed it as it was further down on the page. I'm used to one-click buying.
My video and entertainment system at home is made for US consumption.

It does not make sense for this DVD to even have restricted zone since it is not likely to roll out in US cinemas.",1480464000,,456,4.101123595505618
