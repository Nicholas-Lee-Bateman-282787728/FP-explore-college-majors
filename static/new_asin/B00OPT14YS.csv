8684478,5,B00OPT14YS,"This is a very interesting trilogy.  Years ago, there was an anthology that was very similar where a serial killer set up a camera and filmed his murderous ways.  I forget the name of it but it was quite good.  This reminds me of a 70s style shock film with a modern twist...it's kind of like Dexter without the sympathy or empathy for the character.  The entire trilogy is worth the watch.",1414108800,5,390,4.375
8684479,5,B00OPT14YS,"Have only seen 2 of the films featured here but it's about time someone came around with a true sense of the genre. Rise of the Scarecrows and Family Secret were made with a lot of love for horror films and that comes out on the screen. Those two movies are worth the price alone.  Give this collection a watch. Turn of the lights, grab some popcorn, and have a good old fashioned night of scares from some film makers that have a great understanding of fear.",1413936000,3,459,4.275862068965517
