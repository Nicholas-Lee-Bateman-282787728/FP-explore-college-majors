5562920,2,B00B84KDYK,"I love this woman!  However this was like an infomercial
If you want to know how to perform the DVDs correctly get the callanetics beginner or even the DVD that is 20 min stomach , 20 min butt and hips , and 20 min legs. I found that she really explains the exercises well in that DVD
She also performs the exercises herself , not so in this short DVD.
I didn't find it inspiring either. Save your money and buy one of her books- 10 years younger in 10 hours has lots of inspiring untouched photos AND the exercises.
Don't waste your time with this one. Sorry Callan! I love you but..... :)",1374883200,15,590,4.175438596491228

program works!  That's my reason for rating this DVD 5 stars!",1383523200,,156,4.923076923076923
8563978,5,B00B84KDYK,"Can't say enough about Callan Pickney's callanetics videos/DVD. I have been a huge fan of her's since the early 90's. You will see quick results. Make sure you don't rush through them, listen to her tips for better results. Great for new mothers wanting to get back into shape and for days when you have inclement weather. Super callanetics is more intense but only by intricate movements you are expected to do. Super callanetics is better than doing aerobics in terms of results of timing  in 1 hr callanetics equates 20 hrs of aerobics. I have a bad back so these exercises are great. She explains different level of degree you can work on. You work on what you are able to do and over time you will look and feel better, naturally.",1383177600,7,735,4.526315789473684

8563980,4,B00B84KDYK,"This was really nice to be able to make sure one is doing the exercises correctly. This is NOT a workout, but a more detailed description of way to make sure you perform the moves well, so as to achieve the desired results. This is really important because if you do them poorly, you'll be disappointed. Do them properly, and it's like magic! Worth the money for this short DVD.",1377734400,8,378,4.414285714285715
