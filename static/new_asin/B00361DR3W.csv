8389370,2,B00361DR3W,"There may be some interesting dancing within the choreography but you would never know it as the photography is thoughtless.  Dramatically staged and lighted but overall  experience is ruined by too many closeups, too many shifts in viewing perspective, and too few full figure dance segments.  Hopefully there is a dancer's cut that will be released at a later date.",1440288000,,367,5.083333333333333
8389371,1,B00361DR3W,"Mauro Bigonzetti has staged a dance program distantly (he would term it ""abstractly"") alluding to Prokofiev's brilliant ballet.  Physically appealing young people stomp, writhe, and frozenly pose while garbed in unlabeled Speedos, in what might be fun to observe in a live performance.  But the experience is completely, completely destroyed by the juvenile strobe-manic TV direction of one Andreas Morell.  As one's mind wanders during this frenetic and tedious production, one recalls that Fred Astaire had it written into his film contracts that his entire body should be visible during all dance routines; the one time this rule was broken occurred when Francis Coppola directed his final musical and ended up with Astaire's biggest musical movie flop.  By all means, invest in this DVD if you are more interested in extreme close-ups of nostrils, wrists, and cuticles.  If, on the other hand, you prefer dance programs (or, for that matter, aesthetic soft porn) that features a preponderance of whole bodies creating forms and suggesting interpersonal sparks, Mr. Morell's egocentric fatuousness will spit in your face for an hour and forty minutes.  As for the Bifonzetti production itself, it's always nice to hear Prokofiev's score (even in this butchering of the suites), but the self-celebratory artiness of this (the word ""deconstruction"" captures its the reek of pretentiousness here) does not support the claim in the accompanying booklet that the choreographer COULD have presented a ""traditional"" version of the narrative ... which, by the way, is what most purchasers of the DVD might have sought.  Again, one is reminded of Zeffirelli's post-R&J SHREW that so distrusted audience tolerance for the Bard that he substituted grunts and heavy breathing for the verse, and reminded of Dietrich's famous solo in DESTRY.  In every respect except for the physical beauty of the splice-n-diced dancers, this product is a cheat, a thorough disappointment, and a bore.",1411862400,2,1975,5.348387096774194
8389372,5,B00361DR3W,"This an Italian interpretation, danced in Germany, of the classic star crossed lovers motif.  The music is a ""musical montage"" based on Sergei Prokokofiev ""Romeo and Juliet.""  The details of the familiar Shakespeare are not here. Right up front the notes indicate that even the entire Prokofiev ballet score is not here.  But, that said, the 101 minutes are outstanding, well presented dance with 9 couples dancing the agony, distress, passion, and death of the star crossed lovers.

The dancing is strong, sensual, emotional.  The set is minimalistic.  The costumes are simple and brief.  The music is well played,leading the dancers but not obscuring them.  The Romeo and Juliet motif comes through clearly.  The photography is exceptional and intimate and brings out the passions and emotions of the dancers.

This is a very body celebratory production.  While no genitalia, buttocks or female breasts are uncovered, the rest of all 9 male and 9 female bodies are photographically explored extremely close up.  This is an European production so there is not the American body phobia.  Also, every mole, black head and skin blemish is right up front and exposed.  Many of the men proudly bear chest and abdominal hair.  All the dancers sweat and breath heavy.  There are many excellent closeup of faces. Many shots are of dance technic showing a limb moving slowly. I liked the style of the photography, but do understand that many would be put off by such body celebration.  Actually the intimate photography adds to the beauty, intimacy and emotions of the production, displaying the male and female human forms in motion as art.  This is definitively not homoerotic.

I just wish the producers of the dvd had put English subtitles on the introduction as well as the bonus interview.  It is spoken in Italian with German over dubbed.",1358812800,3,1837,5.0
8389373,5,B00361DR3W,"This dvd is an extraordinary reinterpretation of the Prokofiev's score.  It's intelligent, sensitive, provocative and danced with quiet good technic.  It is not the full length version, but rather a selection of themes used to construe a radically new proposal.

However, this is certainly not a good choice for those who only like classic ballet.

For those, like myself, who enjoy both classical and modern dance (and anything good in between), this is a true jewel. Bigonzetti is simply one of the greatest choreographers of our time!",1336435200,2,537,5.137931034482759
