2806494,5,B000OZ2CVQ,"I liked all 3 of the movies, the last one was the most unique to me. Well worth the money.",1245110400,,90,3.55
2806495,5,B000OZ2CVQ,"3 movies in this box set are great, especially the first one which mentions the jeopardy of the end of the Jurai ruling throne. I would say there is a little difference between the first 2 and the last movie, including character design, story line. If you have watched all the other Tenchi Muyo anime, why not watch the very last production (the 3rd movie) of this lengendery anime in Japanese anime history?",1217808000,4,408,4.602739726027397
8187865,5,B000OZ2CVQ,Tenchi Muyo: In Love was one of the first anime movies I had seen when it played on the Sci-Fi (now SyFy) network years ago and I tell in love with it! I was so excited when I saw all three movies were in this set! They are all still great!,1522022400,,240,3.7254901960784315
8187866,5,B000OZ2CVQ,"Like any of Tenhi anime. It was great. The movie wa bite long. I didn't remember was that long but
it was  it. The artwork was bite dated. The story was good.",1401235200,,158,3.9375
8187867,5,B000OZ2CVQ,Loved the show and could not help myself on getting the movie. It is such a comical movie and can't help but feel a little sorry for Tenchi.,1386892800,,140,4.035714285714286
8187868,2,B000OZ2CVQ,"Tenchy is nowadays a cult title among the comedy/harem series made in the 1990s.
Although not familiar with that series the films are professionally made. But in my opinion, it lacks really good humour; there are attempts, but those only raise a smile. The harem element only is obvious in the second movie.
The movies are not that impressive, in the end. Sometimes you wonder, who is who and why are they doing this. More for the fans of the series, I think.",1356134400,,459,4.542168674698795
8187869,3,B000OZ2CVQ,"The movie itself is pretty good, the animations is also good quality. The storylines are a bit riddiculous but entertaining.",1327449600,,124,5.25
8187870,4,B000OZ2CVQ,"I can't even remember the first time I watched the first movie of this collection.  All I know is that since then, I wanted a copy of it for myself.  I have loved the Tenchi series since I discovered its existence and am happy to see that the people developing these products are always looking for the best ways to please their customers.  What better way to get the collections than to buy them all together in a compact package?  Thank you Geneon for always keeping up your performance.",1303689600,,489,4.46067415730337

8187872,5,B000OZ2CVQ,"I have had these DVD's for about 5 years or more? But I always find myself watching them! They are great to watch and they share the same charm that the series itself presents. A great thing about these movies, they don't share the same storyline like most movies have based on the series. Its fun and work every penny! Love the series and then u would like the movies!!!!",1274572800,,372,4.328571428571428
