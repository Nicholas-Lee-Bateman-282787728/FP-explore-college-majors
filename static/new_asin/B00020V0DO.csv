8019715,3,B00020V0DO,"The instruction was good, if a little more advanced than one would expect on a 'beginning' DVD.  The production quality was very disappointing.  It looks like the instructer is in her backyard squinting into the sun the entire time.  She is also sometimes hard to hear.

The performance part of the DVD looked like a bunch of home videos put to some techno music... a lot of the performers used staffs instead of poi (cool... but not what the DVD advertises).  The poi performances are uninspiring (the one exception is a video of ""Bassman"" who does some release skills and spins poi while walking on stilts).

There aren't that many poi DVD's available, however, and if you want to learn, you can pull some useful information from this disc.",1172102400,3,742,4.713178294573644
