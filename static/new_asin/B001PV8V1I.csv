The words are spoken clearly enough to actually understand what they are saying without having to focus........as I am usually doing something else, and walking in and out of the room.  I think most people would like the DVD  so they could watch the musicians  if they want to---makes you feel as you are at their performance.  I bought both of their DVD's and both are good.

  Since buying the DVD's, I met a missionary to  a muslim country, where a non-muslim church is not even allowed.  She told me that as missionaries, they  sing the scriptures, and people come to hear the music.",1384905600,,625,4.54954954954955

8334749,5,B001PV8V1I,"This one to keep and review when your soul is thirsty for His comforting word. These men, and ladies, put music to the Psalms in a way that is contemporary, yet quite possibly the way David, Asaph, or the sons of Korah originally played them. Their skills aren't as well-honed in their early releases as they are in RAIN, but you can feel their hearts in the songs. The Holy Spirit works amongst them, I look forward to something new from them, but no pressure they do have other responsibilities. The DVD Sons of Korah - Live is an excellent buy.",1286150400,,547,4.425742574257426
8334750,5,B001PV8V1I,"Having recently discovered Sons of Korah, I am greatly impressed by their level of talent.  Not only are the tunes well written, they are reverent and honoring to God, using the very Word of God for the lyrics.  What a magnificent way to memorize Scripture and Worship the Lord of the universe!  Praise God for the new songs sung unto Him.
