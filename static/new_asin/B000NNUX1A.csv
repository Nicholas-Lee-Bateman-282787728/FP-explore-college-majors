8179443,1,B000NNUX1A,Really bad picture quality. I watched about 20 minutes of it before I took it out of the player and chunked it in the trash. Obviously a bootleg copy and not a very good one at that.,1394668800,,182,3.945945945945946

8179445,1,B000NNUX1A,"Watched one of the 3 movies so far, The Getaway.  Recently saw the movie on Cinemax. The version on this DVD has many scenes chopped out of it.  Almost the regular TV version of an R rated movie.  Now I see why the uncut new version DVD's are $60+ for this movie.  If you want to be left a little disappointed, buy it.  If you want the whole movie, you're not getting it with this DVD.",1328572800,11,385,4.0131578947368425
8179446,3,B000NNUX1A,The description is misleading. There is nothing unrated on this Triple Feature: The River Wild and The Real McCoy are both rated PG-13 and The Gateway is the R-rated version of the movie.,1259280000,5,187,4.696969696969697
8179447,4,B000NNUX1A,"I bought this just for 'The Getaway' but when my package arrived, I was disappointed to find the DVD unsecured and moving about inside the package. When I opened it, it was all scratchy from moving around. I cleaned it as best I could and hoped it would work since I didn't want to send it back. Luckily it worked and I have no complaints but that IS why I gave 4 stars. The company should make sure DVDs are secured before shipping.",1243209600,2,433,4.228915662650603
