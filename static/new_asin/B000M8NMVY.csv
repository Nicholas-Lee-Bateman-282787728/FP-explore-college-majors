8167169,4,B000M8NMVY,"I am only comparing this set to a poor-quality 50-movie set that I got as a gift. The movies in the 50-pack were poorly transferred. It appeared that they just cropped a 4:3 portion of the original screen, so the action often occurred off screen or partially off-screen. Also, the movies weren't that great.

The Kung-Fu Theater set is much better. The transfer is better. You can see all of the action and the picture quality is better (keep in mind these are transfers from film, so you see film artifacts as you watch). The movies themselves are better too. Better fighting, better plots (if you even care), and better actors. I actually recognized a few of them as character actors from other films. For the price, I am pretty happy.",1252368000,8,737,4.625954198473282
8167170,4,B000M8NMVY,"the overall package of movies is good, they are equivalent to 80's-90's Tv movies. Two of the movies contained full frontal nudity which I think was inappropriate for such a genre. There is usually no nudity in older movies like these so I was surprised. This is why I don't give it 5 stars.

Outside of that, if you like older martial arts movies from Japan and China they are entertaining.",1243468800,7,391,4.507042253521127
