3666464,4,B001KKU9B4,"This is not a real 4 movie. However, the very clever fighting, was somewhat original and boosted my rating to a 4. I feel if the young ensign had shown more of a positive attitude and unwavering willingness to aggressively fight the intruders, the movie would have been better and the outcome more believable. The bad guys were bad, and the ""insane"" captain and his henchmen were played very well, as was the doctors resourcefulness in fighting against overwhelming and impossible odds and firepower. Worth a watch and enjoy this light hearted ""thriller""..",1326844800,,556,4.989247311827957
3666465,4,B001KKU9B4,"Was really surprized at how good it was given the ratings from the other reviewers. Really enjoyed the action and suspense. The action takes place mainly on this new stealth technology submarine which was out for its first trial run when it gets taken over by terrorists. From this point on the action and suspense have you on the edge of your seat as the sub tries to avoid being destroyed by our own navy before trying to nuke major cities. If you like 24 type movies with Jack Bauer, this might be the type of movie for you.",1325203200,,527,4.333333333333333
3666466,1,B001KKU9B4,"This DVD is not only unrated, but it's unmindful of the hearing-impaired and deaf community by being without both subtitles and closed captions.",1284854400,2,144,5.304347826086956
3666467,3,B001KKU9B4,"Decent actioner that won't waste your time. This may be the B variety but Eric Roberts and Corbin Bersen do a good job of keeping your interest. When a prototype stealth sub is hijacked it falls to Bersen to get them off his ship. One by one he takes them out and sabotages their plans to nuke Washington DC. Well worth at least a rental, and maybe a buy if you go in for this kind of action. I enjoy this type movie as I think just because some movies have better budgets doesn't mean they are better movies. Good quality DVD with some replayability.

3666468,3,B001KKU9B4,"""Depth Charge"" focuses on veteran naval Commander Krieg (Eric Roberts), who has commandeered his own submarine with the help of mercenaries.  While demanding a ransom in exchange for sparing the lives of billions from a nuclear attack, Commander Kreig is unaware that saboteurs are bent on stopping him from carrying out his dangerous and destructive plan.  On board are two of the submarine's original crew and they will do anything they can to stop the madman.  A standoff begins fathoms below sea level, with the fate of the world at stake.  There are elements here of ""The Caine Mutiny"" (Capt. Queeg, Commander Krieg) and ""The Hunt for Red October,"" with lots  of action and a fast pace.  Special effects, however, are not convincing.",1233446400,7,738,4.959349593495935

8315296,4,B001KKU9B4,"a pretty good story.  the main characters (Krieg, doc, the ensign) are mostly believable, the crew of the florida are ok, the rest of the bad guys and all ashore are 2D placeholders.  the military technology presented is much more plausible than most of the things Hollywood puts out, altho certainly not up to Red October standards.  the communication technology that drives the plot isn't even close to real --  you're not going to be able to speed-dial the president from well below the surface of the atlantic
