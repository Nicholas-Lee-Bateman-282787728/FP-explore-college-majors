3997054,5,B002VKNNII,"For about a year, I have been searching for a ""good"" aquarium on BD. I've browsed several options online but wasn't quite sure about the product and decided to wait. So when I chanced upon Bluscenes and their aquarium HD - I decided to purchase it. After reviewing the product description and with the going price (which by the way is very good considering the quality of the product), I figured, I've got nothing to lose.

I received the package within a week...that in itself is very good considering that the shipping cost was free at the time I purchased it. 5 stars on this alone...

Then I tried the product on my 52"" Sony Bravia XBR on a 5.1 surround settings and oh boy, I was really pleased. It's like having my own ultra sized fish tank in my living room - very colorful, very clear, love the soothing sound of water (and yes, you can toggle between having a background music or just have the plain water sound in the background - contrary to what was said on one of the feedback here..not true at all, you have the option). Each tank has good selections of colorful fish. What a treat! By the way, I have it playing while typing this review - and just have to keep looking back at it. I can't wait for my nephews to see this. They have their own real aquarium but are surely in for a treat when they visit. The product definitely deserves a 5 star....I just love it. I can't wait to order their upcoming productions which include freshwater aquarium.",1263513600,,1461,4.387453874538745
3997055,4,B002VKNNII,"Like some other reviews I got these as part of a bundle promotion.

I don't know much about fish or coral.  I'm a graphic designer.  The fish on this disc look sharp and vibrant, and while it's not 3D (somebody should make one!), it gives you the feeling that you are looking at a tank full of fish.  You can see very fine details.

I would have given 5 stars if the disc also included information about the fish and maybe some instructions for people who are new to blue ray.  As it stands, it's very pretty eye (and ear) candy, which aptly fits the product description.  The whole set of discs was very relaxing.  If you have problems looping or turning off the music you just need to use the pop up menu button on the remote.",1263427200,3,728,4.22463768115942

I saw no choice for music off/bubbles on.  Fish are not realistic in their movements.  No real flow.  What a mistake.  Please please look elswhere.",1263340800,4,322,4.7272727272727275

3997089,5,B002VKNNII,"7 different tanks. Each can be set to loop or loop the whole disc. There are three options for sound. The first, natural sounds,  is the sounds of bubbles and gurgling water played in stereo, no music. This most resembles a fish tank. The second is 5.1 surround with music only. The third is 7.1 surround with music and tank sounds.
The music is more or less New Age.

3997112,5,B002VKNNII,"This disc has one goal, and one goal only:  it turns your television into an aquarium.  This isn't the disc for you if you're looking for moving shots, or coral closeups, etc....however, this is a fantastic disc to pop in when you're entertaining guests or just need some quiet background imagery.  For a reef geek like me, this is a great substitute for the real thing.  I bought this disc while we were moving and my big tank was still in storage.  You see, true reef addicts start to go through withdrawal symptoms if they don't have their daily ""fix"".....trust me, it ain't pretty.
This disc contains three aquarium scenes which are filmed from a stationary camera in high definition for good long periods of time.  The first scene is a beautiful mixed reef filled with stony corals and corallimorphs.  The second scene is predominately a large red anemone, and the third tank is mostly stony corals.  Each scene is roughly 20 minutes long, and there are plenty of controls for your viewing options: you can either play or loop the entire disc, or you can choose individual scenes and play OR loop the scenes by themselves.  I wish some other discs would do this (I'm looking at YOU, ""Picture Perfect Hawaii!"") and I'm very happy that it's a feature of this disc.  Honestly I usually choose the first scene since it's the prettiest IMO and set it to loop.  FYI, the loop on this scene is almost seamless.
There is a great ambient music track option for this title as well.  Much like the scene menu, the music track menu is well-programmed and gives you the option of just tank sound (basically water gurgling for you aquarium newbs), or just the music track, or a combination of tank sound + music.  Unlike other discs I've seen, the combo track was very well done and balanced the sound of the music with the sound of the water very well.  The music itself is very airy, definitely new-age, but certainly relaxing and fits well with the imagery of the disc.
I've owned this disc for about 2 years now.  I recently upgraded from my 40"" TV to a 55"" set, and I still enjoy putting this disc in on the weekends while I'm goofing around the house.  I would recommend this disc to anyone who was looking for a coral reef aquarium, without all the hassle of the real thing.",1389398400,3,2272,4.518337408312958

3997114,5,B002VKNNII,This video is exactly as advertised.  It essentially turns your tv into an aquarium.  Soft sounds in the background and great video quality.  Our 5 month old loves it.

3997137,4,B002VKNNII,"Like having a real aquarium without the messy cleaning. I would have given a 5 Star rating, but the last two of the four aquarium scenes, the sound ""sucks"" literally. The tank sounds in the audio is very annoying because the pump isn't getting enough water. the scenes are very soothing and relaxing to watch, except for the bad audio track.",1364860800,2,341,4.60655737704918

3997152,1,B002VKNNII,Nice concept and GREAT crackling sound to enjoy! However this disc will display different resolutions depending on which dvd model and make you have.

But if you are either a Blue Ray fan, or knowledgeable of coral reef aquaria, you will find fault. I adore high quality Blue Ray, and have had $7500 plus coral reef aquaria (hard coral SPS fan) and seen other aquarist's GORGEOUS tanks in person, and this disc doesn't really deliver if you know what you are looking for.

clarity of recording is quite good.  realism can be improved by hiding any/all man-made features of the aquarium.  for example, the return-flow turbine in the upper left corner of the screen should be hidden during recording.  Also, ""cropping"" can be improved a bit. for example, location of the ""free-surface"" of the acquarium could be deduced with ease.  also, the water flow/interference wave pattern formed by the aquarium is easily seen in one of the scenes (scene 3).",1325203200,2,764,4.968503937007874

3997204,4,B002VKNNII,"Although I wasn't a fan of their aquarium disc, I really like the Classic Fireplace disc.  You get a static fire of the fireplace, which a lot of other discs do not have.  You have your choice of 4 views of a fire place; each a different level of pulling out from the fire.  but this choice could be the reason I only gave the disc 4 stars - each scene runs only about 20 minutes.  You can set it to auto-loop, so the fire will be continuous, but it's the same music each time, so if you plan on having this play all night, you're going to recognize the music pretty quick.  If I had my druthers, I would have two hours of 'scene 1' to give me enough music to get through an evening.  As a 'bonus' track they have a scene with light holiday music.  Again, this is nice and I enjoyed it, but at 20-ish minutes long, with recognizable holiday music, you'll noticed the looping pretty quick.

Given all these fireplace discs receive mixed reviews, I think you'll be happy with this disc.",1316217600,5,984,4.224598930481283
3997205,3,B002VKNNII,"Picked this up to be a nice background while showing off the HD TV.  I suppose it accomplishes that.  We have three different aquarium scenes.  The option to continuously loop, so you can put the disc in and forget about it.  Each tank has three soundtracks - music and tank sounds, music only, and tank only (tank is a combination of filer and bubble sound).  But while it was a nice HD image, the tanks themselves didn't impress me.  Rather than a controlled lighting scene like you might see in a store or aquarium.  These tanks look lit by sunlight, which caused some problems for me.  The first tank is  a bit bright, with the top of the image too sun bleached.  Another tank has ripples on top, so the sunlight pattern is constantly changing, which I found a bit distracting.

It's a decent enough disc, but it wouldn't be my first choice.",1316217600,,845,4.457516339869281

I love the quality and the change they make.
when I made the transition from a house to an apartment, there was simply no more room for the hobby. So as an attempt to fill the void, over time I purchased 3 different ""fish tank DVD's"". But for various reasons, I was completely dissatisfied with them ALL. I guess my biggest gripe And you can trust the quality the blue ray gives. (besides them not being in HD resolution) were the unpredictable mix of camera shots. Like when the video would suddenly ""zoom in"" to a specific section of the tank...or start following a single fish around the tank...or suddenly switch into ""slow-motion""! *UGH* (Some ""Fireplace DVDs"" do this same type of film mixing, which I find equally as irritating). But then, I found this ""Bluscenes"" video fish tank, and for the first time,

3997217,3,B002VKNNII,"In this hour long Blu-Ray, I saw maybe 2 min of actual journeying through space.  It took half an hour just to get out of the solar system and all we saw were quick edits from one planet to the next.  I was surprised to see a reviewer say this was *all* CGI.  It's possible the Earth was an animation, it was realistic enough to make be believe it was shot out of the shuttle. After that I'm pretty sure we were seeing NASA photographs.

I'd give the music a five out of ten.  I like ambient but this soundtrack, mostly electronic with some choral and lots of echo, didn't inspire the feeling of being in space.  I suppose the constant music was jarring against the emptiness of space.

The first 10 min are focused just on the Earth revolving with day and night shots, the next 10 on the moon, the next 10 are the planets and the remaining half hour are super slow pans across NASA photographs, for example the Cat's Eye Nebula or the Magellanic Cloud.

3997255,5,B002VKNNII,"I'll write this review in three parts, so that I can address the content, the picture quality and give some suggestions to some of the other reviewers who had problems.

1) The coral and fish:  This is why I bought an aquarium Blu-ray disc, and it's also why I reviewed this disc very highly.  You can tell that the habitats are in excellent health, and the fish and coral are very well lit.  A little internet sleuthing shows that these tanks are also known as the ""Pratt Reef,"" at Pratt Art Institute, and I'd have to say that those students are very lucky to have these tanks in their presence.  I could never make my tanks look like that, so I have to experience them on my TV!

2) Regarding picture quality, some of the reviews seem to be all over the place.  I tried this out on two TVs -- one with a matte screen and one with a glossy screen.  You owe it to yourself to view these with a GLOSSY screen.  Only then do you experience the true color and contrast of the disc.  Glossy screens allow for truer blacks, and if you think about it, aquarium tanks are always glossy.

These tanks are well-lit, and look fantastic in kitchen where I have very bright full spectrum lighting.  If you are looking for darker, moodier tanks, this is probably on the opposite end of that spectrum, but the light serves the important purpose of keeping the coral healthy.  There are some darker blu-rays like HD Moods Aquarium that use artifical coral inserts and have less fish.  HD Moods is a bit darker and might be better in a darker room as it's harder to see in a bright lighting.

Each of the 3 Bluscenes aquariums plays in a loop, and it's done in such a way that its hard to tell where the disc is looping (Hint: the loop freezes for a fraction of a second while the laser moves back to the beginning of the loop.  If you are not looking for it you will miss it.  None of the other aquarium discs that I own have done that, and hopefully more will add it in the future).

3) Regarding reviews that say that this looks like someone just aimed a camera at an aquarium tank, that's what I was hoping for, so I am pleased.  For me the closeups that are on some of the other discs, or pan-and-scan ruin the illusion of the TV being an aquarium.  As far as those saying it's not colorful and then others saying that it is, I think that a lot of it has to do with your TV (and maybe partly based on whether your TV is glossy or not).  It definitely looks hi-def though because you can make out the individual scales on the fish and also the pieces of gravel.  It's very clear.

So anyway, maybe if you think it looks dull on your TV and you have a matte screen, you might be able to tweak the contrast a bit to darken the blacks a bit.",1275264000,64,2727,4.181992337164751
3997256,2,B002VKNNII,"Nice try, but not good enough.  Colors are drab in some areas and over-exposed in others. There is even one track where a mangy algae-covered background is featured.

3997257,5,B002VKNNII,"This disc has one purpose - to make your TV look like a fishtank.  Other discs from this company make your TV look like a fireplace, etc.  It's not a disc that is designed for you to sit and watch like a movie.

A few of the reviews here scored low because they said that the video did not amount to much more than a selection of aquarium tanks being filmed straight-on with a camera, which happens to be what I was looking for.

3997295,5,B002VKNNII,"I just received this from Amazon and it is beautiful! I have it on a 37"" TV with an HDMI cable so I am getting 1080p and it is very relaxing.  I used to relax with ocean waves and beaches but the bright light of the day actually kept me from feeling sleepy! So I got this virtual aquarium dvd and my tv lets me set up all kinds of color combinations so that I can get the screen bluish and darkish so that the bright light doesn't keep me up anymore than I have to be. Since I have snorkled in Hawaiian waters and have seen the little fishies (pacific ocean anyway) closeup, I can agree with another reviewer who said that the colors of saltwater fish are truly THAT vivid and bright as it is on this Blu Ray dvd.

I also enjoyed the Space DVD, and the fireplace blu ray - I have 2 other fireplace dvds and this one is good in that you can adjust the size of the flames.

*************

 The cinematographers at BluScenes combined the renowned coral reef tanks of Advanced Aquarist and Senior Editor of Reefs Magazine, Randy Donowitz, with the crystal-clear image quality of the RED One(tm) 4k camera to create the ultimate Coral Reef Aquarium Blu-ray Disc. Featuring three unique and colorful aquarium tanks, teeming with amazing fish dancing before a canvas of living coral. You can seamlessly loop each chapter and enjoy the specially- commissioned ambient soundtrack with numerous surround and stereo audio options or experience the soothing hum of each aquarium tank.

Play a trick on your guests:  At about 18:30 minutes into the first tank, we dropped a little bit of fish food into the upper lefthand corner of the tank.  Set your watch alarm when you start the disc and tell your friends that it's time to feed the fish.  Watch the fish, and your guests go crazy.

How else is this disc different from other aquarium discs?
1080p content shot on a RED One camera
The tanks and lighting were designed by an advanced aquarist, and look more like real coral tanks, because they are real coral reef tanks.  Coral reefs tend to be very close to the surface and in sunny climates.
Interesting fact: While each tank appears very different under the aquarium lighting, the same type and number of lights are installed on each tank.  The different corals and fish simply reflect the light differently!

I think to make it a ' managed copy ' disc they limited the files to around 4gb in size so they can copy , the video runs around 18-20mbps, I would have liked to have seen 25-30mbps average... the flames tend to be too bright in certain areas... while they said it was recorded with a red camera the video is just not as sharp as hd moods fireplace which was also shot with a red cam and delivers almost 30mbps video with no flame over brightness...

3997301,5,B002VKNNII,"I live in a small studio apartment where aquariums are not allowed.  When I found out that this virtual aquarium existed - I was ecstatic.  I recently splurged on a 40"" HDTV with a blu-ray player, and I love the fact that it can serve not only as something to watch TV and movies on - but also as a means for providing some background ambiance.

The disc contains 3 different aquariums - and all 3 are just beautiful.  Even if you did have your own real aquarium, you'd have to be obsessed with design and upkeep to have anything half as nice as the aquariums used for this disc.  Each aquarium has its own mood: The first, the Coral Reef tank, is vibrant and full of a variety of very active fish.  The second, Anemones, Clams and Exotic Fish, is more subdued and calming with the fish enjoying the flowing tentacles of the anemones.  The third, the Brain Coral tank, is almost frenetic - with lots of movement and action.

Great variety, well produced, and perfect for experiencing amazing aquariums without the headaches and expense of upkeep!

I also have to mention how fantastic the customer service is from BluScenes.  They're very accessible and willing to go the extra mile to help if there were any problems with your order.  Discovering a couple other BluScenes discs that I wanted, I decided to change my order mid-stream, got in contact with Jason, and he made sure that everything arrived exactly the way I wanted it.
