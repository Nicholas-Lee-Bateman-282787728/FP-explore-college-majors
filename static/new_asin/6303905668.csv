722030,5,6303905668,"My dear, sweet, wholesome husband loves to watch old Westerns where you knew the good guys from the bad guys by how they behaved.  They upheld decency, honesty, respect, fair play, and all things good.
We first saw ""Rim of The Canyon"" in October of 2012.  Gene was once again rescuing the damsel in distress and having to solve a mystery at the same time.  With a little excitement, romance, mystery, and maybe even a benevolent ghost, you are entertained for 81 minutes.  Eighty one minutes of enjoyment you can watch with the whole family.
Even if you aren't a fan of Gene's, you'll enjoy this sweet little movie.",1369699200,,615,4.614678899082569

722032,5,6303905668,Gene was a childhood Hero of mine and this is one of his better films. I enjoy the old movies more than the movies of today.,1355270400,,124,3.8076923076923075
722033,5,6303905668,"This film from 1949, in the twilight of the B-western era, was one of Gene Autry's finest and also I believe one of the best budget westerns ever made.
 Autry plays a double role, of himself in real time, and his own father in flashbacks to 20 years before. Steve Autry, a sheriff, had captured and sent up three bank robbers. Two decades later, his son Gene runs into two of the three, plus a third convict, escapees from prison who are intent on finding and reclaiming the loot they stole. In the process, they also steal Gene's horse Champion. The crooks; Autry; a young woman who is secretly in love with him, and two fascinating old men, one of whom has been thought dead for many years, wind up in a ghost town where the action-filled denouement takes place.
 The screenplay for this movie is superb. One can tell that Gene Autry knows he has a superior vehicle to work with, and gives it a fine performance (who said he couldn't act?) Nan Leslie as the smitten young teacher manages to morph from a plain-Jane schoolmarm type to a beautiful goddess, almost as if by magic. Sorry, no spoilers; you'll have to see the movie to find out how.
 The three baddies are suitably villainous, especially Walter Sande, and Autry has a couple of excellent fight scenes with Jock Mahoney, later to become TV's ""Range Rider."" Autry shows how he could do a fine job with his own stunts, when allowed to by the studio bigwigs who were forever afraid of an injured star and costly delays in filming.
 A special mention is due the handsome and intelligent Champion, who gives a fine performance as an outraged stallion stolen but determined to escape and return to his owner Gene.
 If you looked in the dictionary under ""B-Western,"" it would be highly appropriate if the definition said, ""Rim of the Canyon.""",1191024000,3,1797,4.585669781931464
722034,3,6303905668,"Shortly after Gene Autry returned to the world of Western filmmaking following his wartime service, he left Republic Pictures, moving with his production company to Columbia where he enjoyed the greater fiscal capabilities of the larger studio, as can plainly be observed in this well-made melodrama that is marked by strong contributions from all involved, and that offers a storyline having precedence over Autry's former bedrock singing scenes, of which there are but two examples in this piece.  Gene plays a double role, incorporating flashbacks as his sheriff father Steve who, 20 years prior, had arrested a trio of stagecoach bandits that are now prison escapees and have returned to their former hunting grounds, in the area where Gene owns a spread, to regain their secreted loot, and before this briskly-paced film has come to its closing, we may enjoy a scenario featuring an exciting stage coach race, a ghost ( naturally residing in a ghost town), a rampaging herd of wild horses, excellent stunt work, a romance (for which a homely schoolteacher abruptly blossoms), along with gunplay and superb horsemanship.  The original story penned by Joseph Chadwick and published in the long-running pulp magazine ""Western Aces"" is adapted to a script by John K. Butler that improves upon it, adding elements that match the skills of those involved, including director John English who further tightens the work, cinematographer William Bradford, notable cameraman of equine fare, editor Aaron Stell (TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD) who works closely with English, George Montgomery, whose designs are moodily effective for the ghost town interiors, Russell Malmgren with noteworthy sound mixing, in addition to the duo of Paul Malcolm (makeup) and Beth Langston (coiffeurs) who successfully bring about a metamorphosis of Ruth (Nan Leslie) from a plain, lovelorn spinster into an actual beauty; Leslie is impressive, as are future cinema Tarzan Jock Mahoney and rugged Walter Sande as hold-up men, and there are fine turns from old hands Thurston Hall, Alan Hale Jr., Clem Bevans, John McKee, Francis McDonald and Denver Pyle, while Champion Jr. must not be ignored, the Tennessee Walker's actions being fundamental to plot development.",1099785600,,2233,5.3229461756373935
722035,5,6303905668,"This is a movie in which Gene is at his best and plays a dual role.  The part of himself Gene and the  part of his father, Steve Autry.  In this movie, Gene's horse Champion is stolen and Gene is trapped in a ghost town with a spinster schoolmarm, that turned out to be quite a beauty before the show was over.  Confronting 3 escaped convicts, it is action at it's best.  For those that are Gilligan Island fans, Alan Hale,Jr. plays a part in this in the first 15 minutes of the show. So for a qlimpse of a young ""Skipper"" and a handsome hero ""Gene Autry"" the good guy wearing a white hat, riding the world's greatest horse, ""Champion"", watch this movie. Champion does a bit of acting in this one himself!  You will see the worlds greatest cowboy, singer and entertainer save the day and win his lady's hand!!! Let your kids watch too.  They still need a hero like Gene Autry!!!",1009756800,6,878,4.284848484848485
