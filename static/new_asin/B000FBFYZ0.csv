8120076,4,B000FBFYZ0,"This DVD came as close to perfection as any review of US Nave submarine forces activities in WWII that I have seen.  But, Having read and re-read Edward L. Beech's book ""Submarine!"", I was left with a feeling of incompletion after seeing this presentation.  In fact, the only way that I can see to remedy the situation is to create a second disc [or more] to cover the gaps.  As an example, the material available for U-boats in the Atlantic is much larger and comprehensive than any comparable work on our own forces.

In that this DVD derived from the History channel, one hour is all that we can expect for a single issue review.  But, this topic needs much more content than one hour can offer.

Without this criticism, I would rate this DVD a 5.",1393372800,,750,4.437956204379562

8120078,5,B000FBFYZ0,"A very well done documentary on a typical U.S. Navy submarine during her 10 war patrols throughout the Pacific during World War 2. Interspersed with period photos,home movie and Navy film footage from Bowfin's actions are recent interviews conducted with her surviving crew members aboard the sub itself ,as she sits in Pearl Harbor today as both a memorial and museum. A must for naval buffs !!!!!!!!!",1226880000,9,402,5.014925373134329
