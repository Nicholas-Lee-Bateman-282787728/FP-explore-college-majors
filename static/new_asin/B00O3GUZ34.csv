8681844,4,B00O3GUZ34,"Both of these versions of 'Alice in Wonderland' are worth watching if only for academic comparison.  I believe I've seen every filmed incarnation of Lewis Carroll's bizarre, nonsensically cerebral parable (none of them, even Disney's hilarious romp, up to the source material).  But kudos to those who keep trying to do the story justice- clearly it's been a bee in the bonnet of Icarian producers for a more than a century now.  Video quality is surprisingly decent by Alpha standards.  A solid 3 1/2-star experience.",1467849600,,518,5.0588235294117645

8681846,5,B00O3GUZ34,"I have, probably, an unhealthy relationship with Alice in Wonderland. I've read the book more times than I should have, and I collect all the adaptations to film that I am able to get my hands on. I love the story and I love to see what people do with it. It's a shame modern interpretations are often so poor, but that's another thing altogether.

The films on this DVD are fascinating.

The first is the 1915 silent film- which came out only 12 years after the very first Alice in Wonderland film. While I'm not usually a big fan of silent films, because I don't believe they do very well at pacing (because they have to break up the film with title cards to give you some perspective on what's happening), and I think a lot is lost with the acting, and ambiance, if there is no sound. Anyway, I won't meander on that, but I really thought the silent, 1915, Alice in Wonderland film on this DVD is actually the better of the two films. It both has ambition (they didn't do a whole lot with special effects, but the costumes in particular are actually very ambitious), and it hits the notes of Alice in Wonderland as well as you could expect for a silent movie that came out before the Disney film that inspired every other Alice film after it for a very long time.

It could just be that I love Alice in general, and I'm usually fine with any interpretation of it, and how safe they actually played the silent film in narrative is maybe why I'm biased to say it's my favorite of the two, but the actual film stock quality of the silent film is also easier to watch.
The 1931 film, however (while I still like it too- for different reasons), is much harder to watch. At times it made me wonder if anyone working on the film had actually read the book or if they were winging it. Again, remember, this film is before the Disney film (as well as the much higher quality 1933 film which starred several famous actors and still sports much better film making quality over all) so they weren't inspired by much. It is possible the 1931 film makers saw the silent films, as there are times it seems they copied it (and I think one flash back shot used as stock footage from the 1915 silent film).

In the 1931 Alice film the acting is probably the worst acting I've seen in an Alice in Wonderland film ever. I've seen a lot of versions of it, from the one where a lot of British actors wanted to perform extended monologues, to the more famous Disney film which takes pieces from both Alice books and melds them together. Again, though, I have no issue with interpretations. Acting in Alice films has never been a focus because the story is so surreal on it's own the acting doesn't entirely matter. It just needs to fit. However, the actors in the 1931 film are either not used to film acting or they are not used to acting in a film with sound. It's so broad and there are constant times when actors will forget to look forward and you see them intentionally turn towards the cameras to deliver their lines. It's really a marvel, and I love that this was saved forever. It really shows how far film has come. Even if these ideas were more prevalent in the 1930s than I know, it still time capsules an era of film making that cannot exist anymore because we're now grown to just know certain things about film making even if we don't make films.

Last, film (DVD) wise the silent film is surprisingly the easier of the two to watch. There could be a lot of reasons for this, one of those being a single person could have had the film stock for the 1915 film for years and kept it preserved quite well, and the film from 1931 was just not taken care of so the transfer can only be so good. I don't know, but the 1931 film, at times, is really hard to watch because it breaks up a lot. I recall this happening the most around the beginning of the film, but the quality of the film never gets better per say. It's still often blurry. I don't get the impression, at any rate, that there was a lot of money to make the 1931 film. It's even possible it was miserable making it, but I am only speculating that based on how the film looks and the type of acting that is presented.

Anyway, all in all I really enjoyed this and am glad to have purchased it. It's a fascinating look back at a time in film that no longer exists, but also both of these are interesting takes on the story- even if they are both mostly playing it safe.",1456704000,6,4419,4.261025029797378
8681847,3,B00O3GUZ34,"This disc offers two early versions of Alice in Wonderland. The first, a silent film, does a passable job. There are just about no special effects by modern standards (some double-exposure opticals), but the fantasy elements all come from elaborate costuming. That was as good as any since then, and the Alice story came through quite well within the silent idiom. It's just not an idiom I enjoy all that much.

The second was an early talkie. Maybe because film technology then couldn't capture delicate contrasts, maybe because of closeness to the silent era, this still relied on exaggerated makeup to convey facial expressions. And, unfortunately, the cheery and chipper Alice in this rendering missed the restrained bafflement I find so central to the Victorian girl's mien.

So, neither is the worst I've seen, but I didn't find them at all memorable, either. Interesting to the Alice completist, perhaps, but I see no need for a second viewing.

The 1915 silent film is absolutely wonderful. The costumes are amazing, and the film was done beautifully. The 1931 film on the other hand, is completely terrible! The conversations are choppy, the scenes are done terribly and have no proper transitioning, and the costumes are hideously horrible! But I loved it just the same. Fellow collectors will understand.",1429660800,10,488,4.951219512195122
8681849,3,B00O3GUZ34,"The good news is Viola Savoy's film is OK. She plays Alice well and the director seems to have read the book. The bad news is the Ruth Gilbert version is awful. (As much as I love ""Alice in Wonderland,"" I never thought I would say something like that.) She mugs her way through a bad production with hopelessly overacted or underacted characters. The video is only good for a Carollian needing to complete a collection.",1413417600,6,419,4.526315789473684
