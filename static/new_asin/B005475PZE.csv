8456427,5,B005475PZE,This is one of my favorite shows and I'm happy it's available on DVD.  A great show and real interesting to see all the little hole-in-the-wall places around the country.  I have all four seasons now look forward to each new season coming out on DVD!,1345420800,,250,4.413043478260869
