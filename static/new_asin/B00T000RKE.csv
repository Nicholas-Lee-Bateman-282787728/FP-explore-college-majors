6998691,5,B00T000RKE,"B.C. Butcher is an enjoyable little flick, and I can totally picture watching it in a groovy 50's/60's drive-in. At just shy of 52 minutes, it's quite short, and that works in the film's favour. While I'm sure it would've been fine with a regular run-time, at least this way it definitely doesn't overstay its welcome, or ever get dull and boring. At the very least, if you don't much like the film, it's over quickly. The acting is intentionally over-the-top and exaggerated, but never bad. The anachronistic soundtrack adds a lot to the film. It has a very 60's style, from the main theme Alley Oop (courtesy of the Hollywood Argyles), to other tracks, and these fit perfectly with the proceedings, despite the stark difference between 60's pop, and the prehistoric setting. Finally, the effects are fun to behold. Some are deliberately fake, while others are genuinely good! All in all, I totally recommend B.C. Butcher!",1483920000,,923,4.885350318471337

6998705,2,B00T000RKE,"Dina (Miranda Robin) is murdered by Neandra (Leilani Fideler) for sleeping with Rex (Kato Kaelin because everyone needs a sidekick named Kato). Her corpse is taken away by a hideous Neanderthal (Dwayne Johnson, stuntman)  and commands him to avenge her by killing everyone.

I thought Poppy (Molly Elizabeth Ring) had the best lines and was going to be the ""final girl."" She was by far my favorite. The film by design is bad camp. The anachronisms were horrendous, including a wooden shack in the background....and where did they get all those leopard skins? And I did laugh out loud when Anaconda (Natasha Halevi) was telling her story, having to ""quiet down the audience."" However outside of that scene, the humor didn't work. The dialogue just wasn't there as they tried too hard to make this a ""so bad it is good"" cult film, forgetting it must be good enough to be entertaining. They needed more of Poppy to be the anachronistic voice of reason.

First this is a Troma release and if you know anything about Troma you know it is pretty much a Z-movie grindhouse, expect bad...everything. This is one of the better(relatively) films from them, the acting is somewhere between bad and adequate, the limited special effects are simple and obvious. the photography is fine(surprise!), the actors, outside of the two children, a goat and a duck, are average looking. The two good things this film has are the opening song ""Alley Oop"" by The Argyles and the soundtrack/incidental music. It's a simple story, Rex, played by Kato Kaelin(remember him?) is romancing all the women in the tribe and the 'Alpha' female finds out about one and kills her, some random dude finds her, takes her back to his place and is then taken over by her spirit and exacts revenge for her by killing Rex and the other females in the tribe. Pretty much a waste of time, best used as white noise for some mindless chores. (MIght have been better if they threw some bad 70s pron in there, but I doubt it)",1474848000,4,1108,4.57286432160804

It can be a bit hard to follow at times, but if you stay with this story I wholeheartedly believe it will change your outlook on life. Because really, aren't we like Frankensteins monster sometimes?

To call them bad isn't really an insult, it's mission accomplished. And describing what's wrong with them is high praise. B.C. Butcher happens to be one of their more accessible films and guaranteed to be the most unique slasher spoof ever.

B.C. bimbo #1 finds out that B.C. bimbo #2 has been doing it with her boyfriend, and so disembowels her with a spear. Left for dead, but not quite dead, a hideous hermit caveman scoops her up and takes her home. Bimbo #2 telepathically sends him on a killing spree of revenge. It's all amusing nonsense. Obviously, everyone involved in making this movie is in on the joke.

I don't know how many in the cast are recognizable to anyone else, but Kato Kaelin, famous for being O.J. Simpson's tenant at the time of the football hero's killing spree, appears to be having a great time hamming it up for the camera. He's fun to watch. And Rodney Bingenheimer, longtime L.A. D.J. and alternative music star maker has a cameo.

There's also several really good independent rock songs. I don't know if there's a soundtrack album, but there should be. If you like camp, this is likely to entertain. And if you're not sure you want to waste 90 minutes, cheer up! It's only 51 minutes long.",1469145600,10,1361,4.615702479338843

8700059,1,B00T000RKE,"BC Butcher - 1 Star - Nah

I like ""bad"" movies, cheap FX and cheesy monsters. I agree, some films are so ""bad"", they're good. BC Butcher just hits bad and stays there. It isn't classic, campy or schlocky. It's just bad. It has to be embarrassing for fans of Dwayne Johnson.
Yes, I'm aware it's directed by a young amateur, on a low budget. It clearly shows.
There are many of these films, spoofing the schlock films of the past. Good ones spoof in a flattering way by subtly mimicking. BCB spoofs by blatant ridicule. Often, the spoof is ludicrous; as is the case when the sabre tooth tiger attacks. No stock footage. No animatronics. No wrestling with a life-sized dummy. They threw a small stuffed tiger toy at the leader, who knocked it down and speared it. End of fight. No drama; just a groan of disappointment. It isn't schlock. It's a bad decision.
BC Butcher attempts to appeal to younger viewers who would not be put off by gratuitous gore, which is not usually a part of the schlock genre. The ""horror"" of the film could have been done more tastefully, but this is as ""in your face"" as it gets. Movies evoke emotion and the disemboweling scene was intended to evoke disgust and nausea. It's early in the film which puts one in a more critical frame of mind for viewing the remainder.
Because of this mocking approach, it's hard to say whether the acting is bad or exactly that for which the director was looking.
