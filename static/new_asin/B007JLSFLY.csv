8518395,3,B007JLSFLY,"The first time I saw it was back in 1947. I bought it because I didn't remember much about it but at that time it impress me quite a bit. I thought it was a much darker film. The scenery are great, the music excellent. A major credit to the film in my opinion was the performance of the Cornish Rhapsody at the end of the movie. One thing is not to be confuse. It was not composed by the character as portrayed in the movie. It was composed by Hubert Bath.",1391817600,3,456,3.967391304347826
8518396,2,B007JLSFLY,"This film is rather dated by to-day's standards (story can be told in 30 minutes).  The redeeming factor (and the reason for my buying it) is the music of the Cornish Rhapsody.  The last 15 minutes of the film present it best.  Unfortunately, the quality of the audio is rather poor with it requiring attention to the volume control to bring it to normal hearing standards.  I do not fault it being what it was for the times but for the poor attention to quality and volume in the dvd.",1341360000,5,485,4.355555555555555
