8467535,5,B005DTZXIC,"Excellent and true Detective stories....We get to see the very hard work they put in, just to solving all these crimes. And are not shown too much of the horrible gruesome scenes, Sometimes it has taken up to 20 years befor finally catching the culprit.  This must show that the police department have never compleatly closed the case. All the episodes are very interesting, and will keep you guessing as to which one of these suspects "" DID DO IT ""....Beautiful colour in all episodes too.  Im very pleased I bought this 10 hour DVD series of USA CRIME.",1524700800,,554,4.585858585858586
