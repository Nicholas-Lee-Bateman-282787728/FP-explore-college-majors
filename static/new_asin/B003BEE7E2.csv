8393534,1,B003BEE7E2,"Buyer beware.  Although they share the same title, this is not The Dark Room based on the Minnette Walters' book (a British television production).  It is rather a low budget horror film with actors I have never  heard of.  Be aware of this before ordering.  No review of this actual film per se.",1517529600,,296,4.509433962264151

The story was riveting and fresh.  Had a solid ending too.  Took a while to understand it all, but I love that about it.",1341792000,3,194,4.162162162162162
8393536,5,B003BEE7E2,I enjoyed Darkroom from the start as the action came at a pleasing pace.  The story was really interesting and got me talking long after the film ended.  Acting was top rate and I was happy to see a strong female role played so well.  Technically the film was also a success with great editing and sound design.  I am glad I have added it to my library.,1326585600,2,353,4.147058823529412

8393538,5,B003BEE7E2,"Have a watch.  It is a film that you'll be asked to follow, but if you're willing to do so, I suspect you'll enjoy it, or youll fall asleep. Either way, Id like ya to give it a try.",1319068800,,181,3.641025641025641

8393541,4,B003BEE7E2,This is a well made British short film in the vein of 'Captivity' / 'Saw' with some real wince-inducing moments and well crafted suspense. Considering the low quality of most 'movies' made like this on the independent market it's good to see someone doing it the right way. A sadistic guy who is a real charmer with the ladies decides to keep his previous girlfriend bound & gagged in his dark room (basement) and torments her while his new girlfriend slowly finds clues to his secret life. It all builds to a violent / satisfying conclusion with a final scene twist. It would have been great to see this made into a full length feature but it's tight and lean here with no wasted moments. Worth checking out.,1276905600,,709,4.546875
