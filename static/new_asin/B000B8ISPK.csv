2408648,4,B000B8ISPK,"I shared this video with three friends and we all agreed it was a marvelous experience. Miss Sutherland, because of advancing years, is not in the same vocal form as she was when she was younger. That's life. But, even so,her singing here is amazing. She brought the house down after singing The Mad Scene, and rightly so. Pablo Elvira is an excellent Enrico, as is Paul Plishka singing Raimondo. My carping is directed at Alfredo Kraus singing Edgardo. This is purely subjective and there probably will be many who will disagree, but I always found Mr. Kraus lacking innate fire and also chemistry with his leading ladies. His singing voice is good; it's his uninteresting stage presence that prevents me from giving this video 5 stars. If you're looking for a great Lucia, look no further.",1202428800,3,791,4.781021897810219
2408649,2,B000B8ISPK,"I'm watching (listening) once again after some years as I write this little note. Out of curiosity I read what the other thirty-five of you had to say. All the opinions count because they are expressed by people who are either educated to opera or have great affection for it. Having said that, I was embarrassed for the principles - and was that taken with Pablo Elvira who has done little in the way of recordings, more's the pity. Plishka was, well, Plishka. In case some of you haven't noticed, the Met has rather shabby performances with singers who don't fit and some who shouldn't be singing in what used to be a world class house. Clearly, that was going on in 1982 and little has improved. (Ask me about Meistersinger on 3/19/07.)

Oh-yes! I'm not brand new, and long for those days of yesteryear when an opera singer considered the lyric stage either a convent or a monestery, so to speak. Dame Joan most certainly lead a circumspect life with her Dickie and God bless them both. Somehow, even the greats too often just don't know when to quit. I've never understood that sort of mania but, then, I never had to.<G>

I believe that those of you who adored this performance and its stars did so out of appreciation and reverence, just as I often do with Callas who had some outstanding flaws - that wobble alone probably drives some listeners to turn her off.",1173744000,14,1368,4.534412955465587
2408650,5,B000B8ISPK,The sextet in this opera performance is well worth the price of admission. No words describe it,1172275200,5,95,4.647058823529412
2408651,5,B000B8ISPK,"Perhaps this is not the definitive production of Lucia di Lammermoor, nor is it Sutherland's most sensational performance of the role. But it merits 5 stars simply because it is Sutherland in her signature part, an amazingly rare document considering the astonishing length of her career (she was 56 at the time of this performance), the number of times she performed Lucia, and her position as the foremost bel canto artist of the 20th century.

There were many fine, even great interpreters of this role in the last century prior to Sutherland, despite the remarks of another reviewer. Among them were Tetrazzini, Galli-Curci, Melba and, or course, Pons. Contemporaries included Callas, Sills, Peters, Mesple and, for a very short while, Scotto. In spite of these singers many individual qualities, it is well known that the role belongs to Sutherland.

Opinions are fine, but comparing Devia to Sutherland is quite a stretch, and is a representative example of the deterioriating knowledge about vocal artistry in today's opera going public, which week after week cheer pedestrian-to-outright bad performances on the stage of the Met (one reviewer would have shown greater sensitivity acknowledging the work of Gruberova over Devia). As to comments that Sutherland's voice seems strained at times, there is no question that it does not have some of the qualities it once did. But that would not be the point. The miracle is the way in which she manages this performance, a notoriously difficult one, and succeeds, to the reviewers' own observation, to rise to the occasion at exactly the right moments.

For those who were not fortunate enough to hear Sutherland in a live performance, this recording, as with her others--studio or otherwise--will in no way inform the ear about the incomparable amplitude, virtuosity and sheer beauty of this remarkable instrument. And if one wants to hear what real strain and pinched, uneven  singing sounds like, sample some of the work of successors June Anderson, Ruth Ann Swenson and others.

I would also suggest Sutherland's 1986 performance of Lucia from Sydney, on DVD/VHS. Her voice is remarkably fresh, the instrument pliant, and her endurance, well, stupendous. Both studio recordings, made 20 years apart, are also exceptional, showing the amazing growth of an already unsurpassed voice. If you can find her performance of the Mad Scene from the 1984 Concert for Peace in Sydney, get it. As for pirates, they are out there. Of this group, I would recommend the 1970 Lucia from the Met with Domingo.",1145923200,26,2549,5.117788461538462
2408652,1,B000B8ISPK,"and too large (compared to Edgardo). Even musically (closing one's eyes), Devia is much better in my view.",1139097600,12,106,4.944444444444445
2408653,5,B000B8ISPK,"When people think of Opera composers they usually think of Verdi or Wagner, Mozart or Strauss. I think of Donizetti for some peculiar reason. Possibly because he reminds me of a hard working blue-collar guy who heads out early in the morning, well before sun-up; then returns home late at night, dog-tired: heading straight for the neighborhood bar. I feel that I could have a glass of wine with Donizetti (it's a wine bar, of course. This is Opera, not Cheers). Try hoisting a few with Wagner. He'd get you drunk then pick your pocket! Donizetti, on the other hand, was what we here in Brooklyn would call ""a mensch"".

Lucia di Lammermoor is one of the great tragic Operas. It lay dormant for many years because the coloratura soprano necessary to sing this demanding role simply wasn't available. By a happy accident, two coloraturas appeared at mid-century: Maria Callas and Joan Sutherland. The Bel Canto repertoire was revived.

Sutherland made her reputation in the role of Lucia starting in 1959, and had been singing it ever since. If there is one role associated with her, it is this one. She made her historic debut as Lucia at the Met in November 1961 in an old production originally mounted for Lily Pons. A new production followed in 1964, created by Margherita Wallman. This was Sutherland's subsequent showcase in 1966, 1970 and finally, in a restaging by Bruce Donnell, in 1982. This DVD, taped on 13 November 1982 from a live broadcast on PBS, records that production.

The picture is quite clean following digital remastering, but there are some artifacts due to the age of this tape. There's a slight fuzziness in the image, as well as ghosting during rapid movement and occasional color bleeding (for a moment, a large green blotch appears out of nowhere). These are all minor and don't subtract from enjoyment. The sound is clear and full in either LPCM stereo, Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS 5.1 Digital Surround (my choice because it sounds best).

As for the performances: this is definitely a vehicle for Dame Joan. Her husband, Conductor Richard Bonynge, has edited the performing edition, removing the stormy scene between Edgardo and Enrico as well as other passages surrounding the vocal highlights. To my ears, Sutherland's voice sounds tired. Age has pinched her high notes so that they sound raspy. She is pushing her voice rather than letting it flow naturally. But when she is ""in the moment"" the heft of her voice returns. The famous Sestetto is stunning. The size of her voice, it's old power and amazing range are all there to hear (albeit in slightly degraded form). I think she was husbanding her resources, waiting for her signature moments, a wise thing to do. The famous mad scene (with flute, not glass harmonica as in Beverly Sill's wonderful recording for Westminster) is similarly great. The ovation from the packed house continues for 5 minutes. Making allowances for age, her performance is terrific. Fans of Sutherland will want this DVD.

The late tenor Alfredo Kraus is fine in the role of Edgardo, a part he sang well into his 60's. Baritone Pablo Elvira is a good Enrico. Bass Paul Plishka is a sonorous Raimondo. Conductor Richard Bonynge has the measure of this score, of course. I like his reading of this marvelous Opera. In fact, he is quite a Donizetti specialist. Some have criticized him for being somewhat pedestrian, but not here. The Met Orchestra is just plain wonderful, as usual. The production is beautiful to look at. A traditional staging, typical of the Met. I like that conservative approach, for what it's worth.

Whatever imperfections exist in Sutherland's aging instrument are probably irrelevant. Fans will want this DVD because Sutherland at 75% is better than any other coloratura soprano singing today. It is a treat just to see her in this role. Coloraturas of her vocal greatness just don't happen that often. It may be a long time before we see her like again, sad to say. My strong recommendation seems beside the point. Get this DVD as long as you can accept the effects of time on a great soprano's voice. Then close your eyes, listen and dream of long ago when titans strode the Earth and some of us were privileged to witness it.

Even though she was no longer in in her prime - age 56/57 for this Met Opera performance of Lucia (always her signature roll) in 1982/83 -  she was still singing gloriously. This Met Opera performance of hers is noticeably better than her Australian Opera performance on DVD which was recorded 3 years later in 1986 when she was 60 years old.",1403740800,,391,4.507042253521127

2408658,5,B000B8ISPK,"This is another outstanding opera that my father had on reel-to-reel many years ago. I have always loved the coloratura performance of Joan Sutherland as Lucia. Even though she is somewhat older here, she had not lost that touch for those real high notes in her arias. Alfredo Kraus does a remarkable performance in this opera as well. It is done very well. I am glad I bought this DVD.",1391644800,3,386,4.5285714285714285
2408659,4,B000B8ISPK,"If there is any reason to purchase this dated production of Lucia di Lammermoor, it is for the voice and memorialization of Joan Southerland in one of her signiture roles.",1391644800,,171,4.733333333333333
2408660,4,B000B8ISPK,"Or shall we say, a respectful warning.  I admit on first viewing I had to turn it off after a minute or two into Joan Sutherland's entrance.  It was just too late in her career.  Visually and vocally, the performance was simply not to her distinguished credit.

After a few days, after looking into the alternatives (i.e., earlier complete operas on videos), ... I thought I had better try again with a more open mind.  After all, you must be aware, the pickins are mighty slim.  And besides, the main reason I had purchased this DVD was to see and hear Pablo Elvira, who had done Trovatore in Phoenix, back in '82 when I was in the chorus there (oh memories).  He has even less video out than Sutherland, if such a thing is possible.  So it had to be a package deal, or nothing.

Being forewarned and forearmed, it was not too bad.  I will still cling to my Art of the Prima Donna (done in 1960, was it not?).  I did end up enjoying La Stupenda in this late performance, and I have always enjoyed Alfredo Kraus (although this is late in his career as well).  And I especially thrilled to Pablo Elvira, who needs no apologies whatsoever.  I wish they ALL had recorded more.",1384819200,5,1173,4.350230414746544

What a great evening in the theater watching and hearing Southerland, Kraus, Plishka and Elvira.  I don't know if it ever gets any better than this.",1358208000,2,403,4.882352941176471
2408666,5,B000B8ISPK,"I had recently bought the Opus Arte DVD of ""Lucia"" with Mariella Devia and Renato Bruson from La Scala because I admire both artists, But the production in which they appear just doesn't measure up to Sutherland and Kraus, in their late 50's, at the Met in 1982.  Twenty years earlier, of course, these were two of the finest young voices in the world, and Sutherland was already a famous Lucia.  Here the voices are older -- has Sutherland taken the part down a shade? -- but they're still in good condition, and they just flat-out know how to make an opera like this dramatic.  Sutherland gives herself to the role with no embarrassment and that big, mobile face of hers registers all of Lucia's feelings of pain, joy, conflict, and madness.  It's a remarkable performance, and though her voice has ""spread"" a bit since her younger days, and though early on there are the notorious undifferentiated consonants, the top of the voice is exhilaratingly secure and true -- just hear the end of the sextet and the mad scene.  Kraus sounds a bit rustier, but he knows how to spin out a line, and the dynamic variety of his singing, especially in the final scene, is masterly, and he gives a moving performance.  Pablo Elvira is a superb Enrico, much more positive in this production than the great Bruson is in his, and the only vocal reservation I have is that Paul Plishka as Raimondo sounds a bit wooly and woofy.  Richard Bonynge conducts with momentum, the DGG sound is good for its age, and the camera work -- not afraid of the telling close-up -- makes us appreciate the detail and attentiveness of Sutherland's performance especially.  Devia on Opus Arte sings most beautifully, and Bergonzi and Scotto, in mono in a 1967  performance from Japan, sing superbly, but there are serious problems with the productions in which these fine artists appear.  Sutherland, Kraus et. al. at the Met give you the whole deal -- a musico-dramatic experience.",1356739200,,1948,4.71976401179941

2408668,4,B000B8ISPK,"I have a CD recording of her Lucia, but without Kraus.  She is in good voice here, but not as good as earlier in her career--to be expected.  Kraus, even at his age, still sings well, as do the others in the cast.  Sutherland's singing was always superior to her acting, but who's complaining?  I recommend the DVD.",1343088000,,315,4.379310344827586
2408669,5,B000B8ISPK,"I saw Joan Sutherland in Lucia in Sydney in 1965, with a then little-known Pavarotti. Now that Joan has passed away this is a fantastic reminder of ""the voice of the century"" in her signature role.",1288396800,,197,4.5

2408671,3,B000B8ISPK,"The two Met's DVDs, 1982 by Sutherland and 2009 by Netrebko, are played back to back.  Sutherland is vocally calculating as an old pro.  Lucia is more about passion and less about a canary singing contest.  Her lack of emotion/passion has lesser impact on CDs than on DVDs.  Her facial expression, if any, does not convey emotions.... unlike Netrebko.  Sutherland makes a great concert singer.  Krauss is superb, as always. This is a three star performance.

Netrebko's voice is passionate and highly credible. Her acting comes across fabulous on DVDs. Her facial expressions are well synchronized with her beautiful singing. Her Mad Scene is outstanding. In my memory, it is the most passionate Mad Scene since another Anna half a century ago. That was Moffo. Beczala, while already an international star, could be a household name before long. I prefer Villazon and his robust voice. The Netrebko-Villazon chemistry is hard to match. Zimmerman does a superb job on the background scenaries (simple photos in Scotland), but the photographer and the injection can be done without.  The supporting cast is outstanding.  This DVD definitely deserves a 5 star.",1259020800,5,1157,5.144385026737968

2408673,5,B000B8ISPK,"....of this absolutely fabulous performance. To say I was overjoyed to encounter this DVD would be an understatement...I saw this performance on a ""Live from the Met"" telecast back in 1982, and it has stuck with me.

Opera is in some ways the most unrealistic of art forms...here we have a bunch of Scots singing Italian. Two not terribly attractive middle-age people pledge their young love to each other in some of the most beautiful music ever written. Both lead characters keep singing after they're dead [that happens often in Opera]. Who cares? We come to the Opera to be blown away, and we are. If you want pretty girls, try pop. If you want stories that make sense, go elsewhere.

This performance absolutely COOKED!!! Dame Joan was 56, and Lucia was her signatue. If she had been a little better 20 years earlier, it wasn't by much. The late Alfredo Kraus was the lyric tenor of the ages; Edgar was perfect for him. He cared for his voice superbly, and picked his roles with care. The late Pablo Elvira is a wonderful Enrico, the villain brother who wants to marry off Lucia for money. Paul Plishka and Ariel Bybee were in perfect voice, and Richard Bonynge conducted with a sure hand. The audience went berserk, and well they should have.

I heard several of these fine singers in person over the years [and will always treasure the program Alfredo Kraus signed for me at Carnegie Hall in 1984; he was a gentleman]. They never sounded better than they did the night this was taped. If Opera is your cup of tea, don't miss this!!!",1214179200,13,1539,4.589090909090909

- Recording serves as a testament to Sutherland's vocal longevity. Made late in career as many other reviewers have stated.
- Nearly all principal performances are impeccable. Elvira - playing Enrico - is particularly buttoned-up and poised singing the difficult role.
- A traditional production for those who would desire it.

Negative aspects:
- Doesn't pass the smell test when it comes to acting. Staging is formulaic and dull, engaging in clichs that are difficult to ignore.
- Colonnello's set design is deathly dusty and cold. Scenes are subsumed by browns, greys, and blacks. Lucia's Act II dress has very little distinction when contrasted with this color palate.",1511222400,,690,5.2727272727272725

This is a later production, from the early 1980s but is almost as good. Also, my memory says that there are some missing and shortened scenes, when compared to that earlier, Met/Sutherland production.

 Sutherland owned the role of Lucia, for many years, due to her extraordinary performance, in the mad scene.

 This is a traditional production of the opera, with mostly excellent singing. Sutherlands voice is not at its peak but still very good. Until the recent Netrebko production, the Sutherland versions were my favorite, for this opera. Alfredo Kraus aria, as Elgardo, at his familys grave site, is especially well done.
