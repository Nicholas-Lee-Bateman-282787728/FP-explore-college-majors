I had already had a sneak preview on TV but I was keen to see the whole thing all the way through - non stop",1376697600,,223,4.1395348837209305
8437774,5,B004PRUU04,"Carefully crafted suspense with great casting that doesn't have to rely on lewdity, nudity or crudity for the story line. I only have a USA player so I had to watch this through other means, but I have no hesitation in recommending it. I watched all 4 episodes in one sitting, which I haven't done in years. Great debut for new actress as main character. I discovered it because I was looking for more Dervla. Will keep an eye out for more like it.",1362182400,,448,4.345238095238095
