3589511,4,B001FXG2DU,"I have mixed feelings about this film. It chose to focus on a self-indulgent  character in the name of Evan.  It appears Simon lacks self esteem and is willing to settle for the crumbs of life, rather than seek  a level of existence  that would give him some purpose in life! He is either delusional or terribly naive in maintaining his relationship with Evan, who in turn treats him like a kept 'trick!' There is no love there, only a marginal contentment  on the part of Simon. It's too bad Ren could not have been more of an influence on Simon, but Ren didn't have it in him, due to his preoccupation with drugs and music. The production values leave a lot to be desired, but not bad enough to dismiss this film as a high school production (close!). Acting was o.k. and with a little more experience both actors (Simon & Ren) could find acting a career goal!",1442620800,2,861,4.389937106918239
3589512,2,B001FXG2DU,This is another movie about dysfunctional gay men that doesn't really say anything new.  There are a lot of better choices out there if you are looking a movie that is about gay men,1442448000,,181,4.323529411764706
3589513,3,B001FXG2DU,Some hot scenes. Not the greatest production quality. An okay movie.,1441670400,2,68,5.2727272727272725

3589516,1,B001FXG2DU,"The director's interview is perhaps one of the most memorable I've seen because it makes clear in director Jeff Maccubbin's own words the degree to which this film is a mirror to his own psychiatrically disordered life. The isolation, drug use, and self destructive behavior we see in INTO IT are as much the director's as the characters in the film. A reasonable hope is that with the new, cheaper, but higher quality film making equipment available to beginners, Maccubbin will refine his understanding of the art of telling a story without the self-indulgent camera tricks, lack of focus and jumpy editing which eventually sink this effort. The guy has the creativity but whether he can acquire the hard headed practicality crucial to keeping his audience with him is yet to be seen.
  Own it? No. But if you are a cinema student, this would make a great study in beginner's land mines, not to mention the basis for a slew of film school discussions.",1277596800,,953,4.7696969696969695

3589518,2,B001FXG2DU,"Simon and Rem are two young hustlers sharing an apartment and a hazy drug/alcohol existence in the city.  Rem is the more alert of the two, although he seems content to turn an occasional trick and spend the rest of his time stoned and plugged into his music in the apartment.  Simon claims to want more out of life, including someone to love, but feels powerless to attain it through his self-destructive behavior. When Simon meets Evan, the host of a strange late night home shopping show on cable, he sees him as another lost soul of sorts, and initiates their first sexual liason.  These eventually take on a S&M bent, but surprisingly appear to relieve Evan's Tourette-related facial tics, which gives Simon some long desired sense of personal worth.  As time goes on, Rem points out - and Simon realizes - that the relationship is just another source of depression for Simon, which he doesn't seem to be able to escape.

When I was trying to make any sense out of the first 15 minutes of this film (an ""artsy"" hodgepodge of quick disjointed scenes), I immediately compared it to the worst gay movie I ever had the misfortune to watch, ""Soul Maid,"" which stands at the very pinacle of my personal ""What Were They Thinking???"" Hall of Filmmaking Shame.  Not surprisingly, I later found out writer/director/screenwriter Jeff Maccubbin is responsible for both of these fiascos.  The best praise I can give this one is that it is not AS BAD as ""Soul Maid"" ... though it is painful to watch.  One could cite a comemdable attempt to focus on the lives of individuals who are definitely in the more-slimey areas of the ""pond"" that is the gay community, but it doesn't really tell you anything new.  A little bit of eye candy, rear nudity and simulated sex make this unrated film a definite hard R.  DVD has trailer and director interview.  I give it 2 stars out of 5.",1226880000,4,1865,4.604229607250756
