8461776,5,B0058M07VM,"I use this DVD to start up my day. It is 5 diffrent workouts to chose from or do them all at once. I do 10 min. each day to start of. The workout is good and well explained how to do, so everyone can do it.",1391472000,,206,3.404255319148936
8461777,4,B0058M07VM,Great variety of ab work.  I love about 3/4 of this DVD.  The pilates ones are a bit boring. The others are awesome.,1372809600,2,116,4.0
8461778,2,B0058M07VM,"I was excited to get this DVD b/c I love several of the trainers on there (Lara Hudson, Amy Bento, and Suzanne Bowen). I was disappointed to find out, however, that the segments from these trainers were just taken from existing 10-Minute Solution DVDs. I thought they were new routines, so that's why I was disappointed. If the DVD description had made that point clear, I wouldn't have bought the DVD. If you don't currently have any DVDs with Lara Hudson, Amy Bento, Suzanne Bowen, or the other ladies, this is a great DVD. But since I already have 3 of the 5 ladies' workouts, this was a wasted purchase for me.",1370217600,9,614,4.491071428571429
8461779,4,B0058M07VM,"I would like to disagree with the reviewer who said this compilation was a total waste of money, and that most of the workouts don't target abs.  All six workouts target abs, but they target them in different ways.  There are not a lot of crunches on this DVD, but every segment features solid core work.  Four of the workouts require a mat for floorwork.  One of the workouts, Belly Fat Burner, also requires a single light dumbbell.

The first segment, ""Six Pack Ab Attack"" comes from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Minute-Solution-Ultimate-Bootcamp/dp/B0033WH6KO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Minute Solution: Ultimate Bootcamp</a>.  This was my least favorite segment, as I disliked Jessica Smith addressing me as a ""soldier"" and I found her use of bootcamp lingo somewhat irritating.  However, I recognize this comes from a Bootcamp-themed workout DVD, and others might find the theme a lot more amusing.  She has us do a simulated mud crawl that features a lot of solid work with forearm planks (often ranked by trainers as the single most effective ab exercise) and sideplanks.  It also includes sit-ups -- an ab exercise that you don't see on many DVDs these days.  (For more on this segment, check out Amy Henley's solid review under the link for the Ultimate Bootcamp DVD.  She gives a step-by-step description of this workout.)

The next segment, ""Belly Fat Burner"" comes from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Minute-Solution-5-Day-Get-Fit-Mix/dp/B002EWD0CC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Minute Solution: 5 Day Get Fit Mix</a>.  Amy Bento had a chatty, chipper style that I did not enjoy that much, but I did appreciate the diversity of moves she used to engage the core.  She uses a single light dumbbell along with a mat for this, and does a number of swinging moves inspired from kettle bell.  She also does twists, side bends and standing crunches of various types.  She then moves on to floor work and includes some interesting variations on crunches and planks that I found fun to do and really felt the next day.  She keeps a fast pace and this gave me a good cardio workout.

The third segment, ""Dancers Abs"" comes from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Minute-Solution-Dance-It-Off-Tone-It-Up/dp/B002UPUSEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Minute Solution: Dance It Off & Tone It Up</a>.  This was my all-time, hands-down favorite segment from this DVD, and the one that I used over and over during the week that I had this DVD checked out from the library. Galardi has a low-key style and delivers a great dance workout centered on abs in this segment.  Here's what I loved about it: it gave me a nice cardio workout, and featured plenty of muscle isolations and moves from both belly-dance and hip-hop.  I enjoyed grooving to it, and my abs (and glutes and hips) got a nice workout to this one.  However, I've had a couple of sessions of belly dance classes in my past, and knew how to do isolations.  Galardi does not stop to instruct fully on each move, but just keeps building on the moves as the dance goes to keep things working.  Someone without some background in bellydance or other other dance choreography might find it really confusing.  It is definitely more of an intermediate segment.

The fourth segment, ""Waist Slimmer"" comes from Lara Hudson's wonderful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Minute-Solution-Rapid-Results-Pilates/dp/B000GEIRAU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Minute Solution: Rapid Results Pilates</a>.  She is the only instructor on this DVD to not bare her midriff.  I really like Lara Hudson's style of instruction: creative and challenging while still being low key.  Her presence on this DVD was my primary reason for checking it out from the library.  Hudson is not a Pilates purist, and often fuses moves from yoga, isometrics and gymnastics in with her pilates work.  I personally feel the fusion gives her Pilates workouts a freshness and a sense of fun that I find missing in some of the other instructors I've tried.  There are a few moves that Hudson does that I cannot do yet -- rolling the upper body up from a prone position using only abs -- but I am slowly building the strength for it, and I think her workouts have been largely responsible.  (If this DVD makes you interested in checking out other Lara Hudson DVDs, take a look at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Minute-Solution-Pilates-on-the-Ball/dp/B0013D8M3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Minute Solution: Pilates on the Ball</a>.  It is the most creative and interesting physio ball workout I've ever done, and one that I return to time and again.)

The fifth segment, ""Pilates Perfect Abs"" comes from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Minute-Solution-Blast-Off-Belly-Fat/dp/B000KJTFDE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Minute Solution: Blast Off Belly Fat</a>.  Suzanne Bowen provides a fairly straight forward traditional pilates workout.  Her style is pleasant and low-key. Like Hudson, she includes moves like the hundreds and pilates teasers.  Despite this, there was very little overlap between the two pilates workouts on this DVD.  She also gave me a great abs workout, and a better understanding of the basics of some of the Pilates moves than I got from Hudson, so I considered it worth including both workouts on the same DVD.

With the sixth and final segment, ""Bikini Belly"" (from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Minute-Solution-Quick-Tummy-Toners/dp/B001AYWY7M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Minute Solution: Quick Tummy Toners</a>) we return to Jessica Smith.  She is still pretty enthusiastic and chipper, but I found her less annoying in this segment since we no longer had the bootcamp lingo to deal with.  Bikini Belly is a standing abs workout -- an aerobics routine with simple dance moves and lots of standing crunches and ""ab-centric"" moves.  I found it similar to the standing abs routine from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kathy-Smith-Tummy-Trimmers/dp/B000WOSAVK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kathy Smith: Tummy Trimmers</a>&nbsp;but I enjoyed Kathy Smith's Standing Abs routine more.  Still, it was a good cardio workout and provided a lot of variety.

Overall review: this was a pretty good compilation.  You may not want to pick it up if you already have the DVDs these workouts are compiled from, but I found it fun and useful.  If you want another DVD with a bunch of ten minute workouts for abs, you may also want to try Kathy Smith's Tummy Trimmers.  Smith pulls her five workouts from a variety of disciplines and has consistently good cuing and a nice low-key presentation style.",1347148800,15,6888,5.786706349206349
8461780,1,B0058M07VM,"This is the most awful stomach work out DVD I've ever had--6 work outs is a great idea, except when most of the work outs don't target the stomach muscles! The dance work out was just plain strange. I'm actually putting this DVD in the Goodwill box, something I've never done before with a work out video.  I'll go back to my ""Abs of Steel"" series!",1323734400,4,348,4.2727272727272725
8461781,5,B0058M07VM,"With 6 10-minute workouts to choose from, I never feel pressured with finishing a whole video of 30-60 minutes, although if I have time, I choose to do more than one workout at a time.

Each workout is very different than the others, so you feel like you are working out your whole core, not just one section; each one is effective in its own way.

5 instructors keep it fresh so you're not always staring at the same face and hearing the same voice (which CAN be nice if you find someone you really like).  When I finish one 10-minute session, I am excited to move on to another one.

I recently tried out ""The abs diet workout for women"" video with Jessica Smith (she teaches 2 workouts on this video), and I have to say this video is a ton better than that one.

Overall a great workout routine for the belly, and a great introduction to different types of workouts (pilates, dance, etc) so you can get a better idea of what you'd like in the future.

Only thing I don't like is the main menu, which is a little annoying to navigate, but worth it.",1317427200,5,1050,4.251256281407035
8461782,5,B0058M07VM,"I absolutely LOVE this DVD!  For the most part I work out with a lot of Chris Freytag DVD's but I've been adding 1 to 2 of the Best Belly Blasters workouts along with my regular workouts.  I like the variety of workouts to trim and tone the belly that this DVD has to offer.  The only one I'm not crazy about is the dancers' section, but that's because I have 2 left feet!",1316044800,2,372,4.0
