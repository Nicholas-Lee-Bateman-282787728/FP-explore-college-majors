6681940,5,B00NW6KW5C,"Non Non Biyori is a nice series with a good animation.
Looking at the environment and nature is soothing after a hard and stressful day.

The main girls just live their everyday lives without anything too special, going to school with 5 students and meeting each other in the afternoon. But everything they do is funny and cute.
Sentai subs are good and Biyori just comes with 1 BluRay, without many extras...
Now waiting for season 2.

Enjoying this.",1422489600,4,451,4.69620253164557

6681942,5,B00NW6KW5C,"Non Non Biyori is the perfect anime to come home and watch after working a 12hour shift. much relax. such chill. wow. Every character is adorable and every episode brings a smile to my dull and tired face.

BEWARE: This is NOT DUBBED as the Amazon description suggests. Japanese with English subs only.

Blu Ray does not contain any special features. Literally the 12 episodes (OVA not included). Ta-da. 10/10 would chill again.",1420761600,26,428,4.8493150684931505
6681943,5,B00NW6KW5C,"This is one of the best Slice of Life Series I've seen in a long time (I've been an Anime fan since the 80's) it has no fan service, fight's or magic, or highly emotional scenes (well maybe one) it's a simple story of rural life thru the eyes of a group of girls between the ages of 6 to about 14 and the interaction between themselves and a few of the adults in their lives. It's very well written the animation goes from very good to spectacular so I'm glad it's out on Blu-ray the music is almost perfect the background noises are spot on if it's spring you'll hear the birds and other sounds of spring. If your having a bad day just watch some of this series and most likely you'll feel better it's that laid back and relaxing it can be very funny at times and I'd bet their will be a few moments when you'll say I remember that or doing that. I just found this series to be very entertaining and would recommend it to anyone. It's not dubbed but that's o.k. their is an OVA out(really a 13th episode wish it was on here!) and their will be a second season very glad to hear that!",1418515200,12,1084,4.093896713615023
6681954,3,B00NW6KW5C,"I wish it had the OVA on it and that there was a way to turn off the subtitles. Other than that, it's perfect.",1454198400,2,110,3.625
6681955,4,B00NW6KW5C,"Non Non Biyori stands out from other ""cute girls doing cute stuff"" titles out there. There's no random yuri scenes, there's no fanservice at all and the pacing is excellent and easy to follow. Most slice of life series are based in Tokyo, but this one takes place in an outside town that teaches us how Japan is outside of the big cities. Limited stores, people farm their own food and the school is quite small (only 5 students!?). Delightful characters, funny sequences and some drama, all in perfect harmony. There's also several parts focusing on every single character, so you will feel like you know these people in real life.",1449964800,2,632,4.702702702702703

6681958,5,B00NW6KW5C,"It's a perfect show for when you've had a tough day, and life looks pretty bleak. But, then you get to watch this show with its charming characters and Lush colorful countryside, and then you are refreshed again.  I watched this show sparingly, an episode at a time like drinking fine wine.  i was so glad to hear a second season is beginning soon.",1435881600,3,348,4.421875
6681959,5,B00NW6KW5C,"Non Non Biyori (Nom Nom Weather) has beautiful artwork set in the Japanese country side, very lovable characters, and a gentle pace perfect for its slice of life humor. I really loved it and have already watched it about 15 times, which is extremely rare for me because I'm more of a one-time view anime fan. Imagine if Green Acres, The Andy Griffith Show, and Sailor Moon, had a child. It might be something like Non Non Biyori.",1432771200,,429,4.512820512820513

6681961,5,B00NW6KW5C,"An adorable series, very relaxing to watch, and the rural aspects of the setting make for some interesting scenery and interactions.  Looking forward to the second season.",1429228800,,171,5.333333333333333
6681962,5,B00NW6KW5C,"Non Non Biyori is a rural Japan comedy set in what amounts to a one-room school house.  Having come from a near equivalent American background the things that the 5 kids in this school do are familiar and, yes, very funny.  In a way it points out how the rural spaces in Japan have been hollowed out by the pull of modern city life, again not at all dissimilar to America and other parts of the world.  I'd recommend this to anyone that is looking for something light and relaxing.  Oh and cows are still cows no matter where you go, they never get in a hurry.",1426982400,2,560,4.205607476635514

8680616,5,B00NW6KW5C,It's like the most wholesome anime ever...and I probably like it more than any other anime that has come out in the past 20 years. :-),1532908800,,134,4.1923076923076925
8680617,4,B00NW6KW5C,"Do not believe that this anime is dubbed in English.  It is NOT.  I was disappointed when I started watching this as there are only English subtitles.  Also, there is the minor inconvenience that there is not enough time allowed for reading them.  I can read fast; but, the subtitles are on the screen for maybe 10 seconds and then you are off to the next one to read.",1508457600,,368,4.2898550724637685

8680623,5,B00NW6KW5C,"This show is simply beautiful, relaxing, and fun. The show stars 4 girls living in a backwater country area part of Japan far from any cities and one of those girls moved there from Tokyo. Life is peaceful and quiet. There's not much for me to say other than I really enjoy this show and I plan on getting season 2 ""Non Non Biyori Repeat"" whenever Sentai Filmworks releases the Blu-ray for that",1456272000,,394,4.410958904109589
8680624,5,B00NW6KW5C,This is a great show for any kid who is interested in watching Anime.,1455926400,,69,4.0
8680625,5,B00NW6KW5C,"This is my favorite slice of life Anime.  The humor in this series is quite clean and sentimental with no racy bits unless you count the joke about Koma-chan's  swimsuit from the beach episode or Hotaru's admiration of Koma-chan but that all depends on your point of view. This region 1 DVD edition has nice, no frills packaging and colorful discs; just don't expect any extras other than the clean openings.
I really hope the OVAs and season two aka Non Non Biyori Repeat, which just ended September 21st 2015 come to Region 1 soon. In the meantime you can enjoy season 1!",1455667200,,573,4.553398058252427
