7877666,4,6304746563,"The story of a niave country man trying to make it in Mexico City. Once there, everyone takes advantage of him and rip him off constantly. Hector Suarez did a great job in his character and shows how the gullible country men get treated and fooled when they get to the city looking for a job and money. Of course, Hector Suarez adds much humour in this flick. The point and message he was trying to get out in this movie was to try and turn people off and think twice about moving to Mexico City and making a living there because it's not very easy.",1014163200,2,549,4.188679245283019
