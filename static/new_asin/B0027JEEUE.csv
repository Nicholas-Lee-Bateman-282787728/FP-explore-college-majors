8354848,5,B0027JEEUE,"Word to the wise when ordering The Avengers (great show of course) but you should be aware that the box sets often contain two volumes, so if you order Volume 4 you're actually going to receive only the second disc of Set 2 (Set 1 contains Volumes 1 & 2 and Set 2 contains Volumes 3 & 4). Once you get the right ordering information, you won't be disappointed.  I recommend ordering the sets because of the added cover art and convenience of the packaging.",1382918400,5,456,4.364705882352941
