8174878,5,B0002T46GS,"This DVD picks up from where the Beginners Level 1 left off; still the same length but it's so packed with good stuff it feels better value. From the footwork I would point out the Suzy Q and the Hook Tap Slide as elements of styling ""social"" instructors don't know or don't bother to teach.

The partner moves cover the basics nicely; after practicing this material you can actually hit the dance floor and feel good about it.",1109116800,,427,4.4743589743589745

type=more performance than social
Most of the bad points in this couples first dvd are repeated in this 2nd dvd.
Do not bother to buy.
There are far better Salsa instructional dvd's being sold on Amazon.
This dvd is a waste of money.",1108598400,,242,4.5227272727272725
