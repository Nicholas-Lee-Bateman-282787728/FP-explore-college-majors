8489002,5,B005Y1B3K6,"Short Attention Span Summary:

1. A young man lives in Inkster. (I could swear that they shot some of this movie over in Lemoyne Gardens before it got torn down.)
2. He goes to school in Romulus. (These are all places that someone in Southeastern Michigan would know and this situation of Inkster kids going to Romulus is a very common one.)
3. It seems that his family has a cab company that supports them-- *just barely*.
4. They happen to be Muslim
5. Remainder of film is about young man using ice sculpture as a way to get a college scholarship and the conflicts it causes about leaving his family. There are a few minor plot elements.

All the characters in this film are actually real people (or based on real people). The culinary arts teacher, Mr. Charles Usztics really is (was) a teacher in the Romulus school system (he taught me) and the places that they showed were all places that I have passed 1,000 times in actuality.

The acting in this film was not first rate, and that is OK. It was better that this was not overdramatized.

The black people in this film also act much like black people that I grew up around. The one unfamiliar component of this was Islam. But since the rest of the film smacked so much of reality, I can assume that the representatation that they gave us of a black American Muslim family was accurate. And in that sense, I did learn something from this film.

There is also the feeling (one gets the distinct sense)that the filmmakers did a lot with a very little (in the way of budget).

Verdict: Worth the time. Worth the rental fee.",1379289600,2,1576,4.43598615916955
