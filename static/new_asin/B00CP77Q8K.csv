5731924,3,B00CP77Q8K,"Found footage is found footage. These movies are starting to blur together at this point so the question is if a show can execute things well... This movie felt very much like it was basically just redoing Blair Witch and that's okay, but it didn't really add much. It was a very paint by the numbers movie for this genre. And that's okay. I'm okay with that - I don't want my money back for renting it or anything but I wouldn't watch it again.",1395446400,,445,4.247058823529412
5731925,1,B00CP77Q8K,"PLEASE DONT PAY TO RENT THIS!! It's a waste of time and a whole lot of waiting for something anything that could be considered suspenseful or scary or at all interesting with no pay off. Except one quick jump toward the end. This movie is not anything like the synopsis. No mention of severed feet except briefly as another reason for the girls to scream their high pitched screams when they find what looks like one of their missing project partner's shoe with the foot or maybe a ham bone still inside. No other mention of this so called phenomenon that this documentary is purported to be explaining, except at the end of movie during the credits rolling and then they just list the supposed dates of shoe with severed feet findings. So on conclusion, VERY BAD ACTING, A BLATANT MISREPRESENTED SUMMARY OF PLOT, INCESSANT SCREAMING BY TWO TEENAGED GIRLS FOR REASONS OFTEN NOT SHOWN OR EXPLAINED AND TERRIBLE CAMERA WORK OUT OF FOCUS MUCH OF THE LATER HALF OF FILM!!",1394755200,3,967,4.6608187134502925
5731926,1,B00CP77Q8K,"Awful boring and horrible acting
Incredible waste of my time and money.
Is found footage flick, but the footage should have remained lost.",1394668800,,138,5.043478260869565
5731927,1,B00CP77Q8K,"IF I COULD GIVE THIS HORRID MOVIE,I WOULD.THIS BY FAR IS THE MOST BORING UNEVENTFUL HORROR,PARANORMAL MOVIE .THIS SHOULD BE IN THE GENRE OF COMEDY",1389398400,,146,4.88
5731928,1,B00CP77Q8K,"if this is really a ""true story""/ based on events-then I feel for the families involved and hope they get the answers they are looking for. That being said- I did not buy this as a true story. The acting was cheesy, the script- ""gee"" was actually used. if you are looking for a good scare this is not it. if you have never seen a scary movie in your life, you may have a different view.",1388448000,,386,4.025974025974026
5731929,4,B00CP77Q8K,"Just received my copy and was rather entertained by this movie.  It starts out with a funny comedy element then as the film progresses the mode changes almost instantly and started to creep me out. There are parts that literately made me jump in my chair as I was watching it! One of the coolest things is that all the paranormal things they talk about and experience in the movie actually happened. Looked up some of the things they mentioned about locations and found out where they are actually a real places and things did happen there! Now that creeped  me out. Going to have to get some buddies to go check it out sometime.

So yes, Severed Footage is a must watch if you like 'found footage' movies",1370649600,4,705,4.449612403100775
8584397,1,B00CP77Q8K,"Horrible. The first 40 mins was like a slow youtube video by a 10 year old. It gets exciting toward the end, but the wait isn't worth it.",1496966400,,137,3.9285714285714284
8584398,1,B00CP77Q8K,Do not watch this. It was one of the worst found footage movies made,1476835200,,68,3.9285714285714284
8584399,5,B00CP77Q8K,Very low budget FF flick but the tech/plot device at the very end make it very entertaining.,1468281600,,92,4.470588235294118
8584400,3,B00CP77Q8K,Severed Footage was okay as far as found footage movies go. There's nothing in it that we haven't seen before in other movies of this type.,1442102400,,139,4.384615384615385

8584402,1,B00CP77Q8K,This film does not even merit one star... do not waste your time!!!,1420156800,,67,4.230769230769231
8584403,1,B00CP77Q8K,"Ack,  I saw the same movie set in Minnesota or somewhere.  As I recall my review, I said that the hikers were too stupid to live.  These kids are in a class beyond stupid.  The severed feet were never  tied into the plot.  The lead  male was a mash-up of all things testosterone.  The girls were mindless gigglers that turned into mindless screamers.  The scenery was great, but it had no lines.  Too bad.  Watch if you must, but my suggestion is to go for a walk instead!",1417046400,,472,4.25
8584404,1,B00CP77Q8K,"Yet another boring entry in the found footage horror genre. I wish I had more insight, but frankly (oh, and don't let the cover artwork with the obligatory gold wreath icons fool you) this film isn't even worth my wasting your time reading a bunch of fluff describing what is just another ladle of slop on the ever-spreading pile of found footage horror that has been slowly speading over the horror genre since Blair Witch and the discovery, by an entire generation of teens and 20-somethings, of high-quality, low cost video cameras and editing software. I am always looking for good, unique found footage, and - happily - I have come across perhaps 10-12 that I'd recommend. This is not one of them.",1416528000,4,702,4.715447154471545
