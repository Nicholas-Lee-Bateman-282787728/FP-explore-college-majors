2991543,4,B000WTVZEY,"Prevention always delivers a fun and exciting workout.  However, I wasn't as challenged with this routine like I am with others.  The video is broken down into four 10 minute segments with a warmup and cool down.  The last section called showtime was the most fun and the one I really felt challenged by.  The instruction is good and the moves are fairly easy, but the delay between sections leaves you hanging for a few seconds.  I will keep doing this video and continue to look for new titles by prevention.  As for danciness, this one hits the spot in fresh and fun moves.",1199318400,7,576,4.490384615384615
2991544,4,B000WTVZEY,"I rec'd this DVD and did it this morning.  What fun!  It's a well chaptered DVD with warmup and cooldown.  There are 3 dance segments (Hip Hop, Jazz-Funk, 90's Jam) that are 10 minutes each, as well as a 10 minute ""Showtime"" segment where the instructor goes through all of the moves.  Total running time is about 50 minutes.

Tabitha D'Umo is a great instructor and I was able to pick up most of the moves on the 1st try (except for ""Farmer John"").  I hope to see more of Tabitha in future dance workouts.  She's very personable and easy to understand.

I definitely worked up a sweat, especially on the 90's Jam and Showtime segments, and time just Flew by!  This workout is relatively low impact except for a couple of moves, which I modified with no problem.  It's also pretty easy to do on a carpeted surface (with the exception of the ""Farmer John"" move).

I recommend it!

The only quibbles I have with this workout are:
* if you're doing all of the segments, there's about a 1 minute period between the segments where you just kind of march and wait for Tabitha to instruct.  Easy enough to fast forward through, though.
* there are no leg stretches in the cooldown, which are a must with dance workouts, in my opinion.",1197936000,33,1227,4.424107142857143
2991545,5,B000WTVZEY,"Prevention always bring terrifc workouts.  They are always easy to follow and yet challenging enough to keep you from getting bored and also effective enough to burn some serious calories.
This dvd is no different.  It's taught in a great way that allows you to learn the moves very easily.  You start out learning a little bit and it's done in a slow tempo and builds up the pace to full tempo and repeats itself so you can really get the moves down well.  Having said that, there is a lot of emphasis on having fun and enjoying the movement rather than being able to totally master the moves.
The three dance styles they focus on here are jazz funk, early hip hop and 90's jam.  They are all fun and before you know it you've done the workout and broken a good sweat.  At the end of the workout, all the styles and moves that you've learnt are put together and that definately gets you puffing.
I really enjoy this dvd.  It's another brilliant Prevention workout that I've added to my collection so I don't get bored.  I find it's easy to do and keeps your heart rate up for almost 45 minutes.  I feel great after doing it and highly recommend it.",1197504000,23,1149,4.331775700934579
2991546,5,B000WTVZEY,"Thank you to Prevention for once again coming out with an instructor with excellent cueing and great moves!  This is a very innovative, fun, fresh routine of dance moves.  It is very, very dancy, with no aerobic type moves.  I appreciate the consistentcy of the Prevention DVD's where the segments are broken down into warmup, jazz funk, hip hop, 90s jam, put all the dances together segment, and then cool down.  The 5th segment where you put all the dances together is really the icing on the cake.  I am an intermediate excerciser and really need that additional ten minutes of working out.  Unlike some of the other dance DVD's where you can only get a good workout once you really learn the moves, this one is very high intensity.  I was sweating really hard at the end.  THis will definitely be my favorite new DVD along with Jennifer Galardi's Dance off the Inches Hip Hop.",1197331200,14,880,4.596153846153846
2991547,4,B000WTVZEY,"First of all, let me say that this is pretty much all hip-hop dancing even though only one segment is called that.  There is a 2-3 minute bonus Salsa routine, but I don't count that in my review.  Tabitha D'umo instructs this workout, and this is the only DVD I know of that she leads, at this time.  She is a fabulous choreographer from ""So You Think You Can Dance"" and she seems to be a great instructor, as well.  She has 4 segments, 3 of which teach routines.  The way she does this is she breaks down all moves to half-time, does it four times, goes up to tempo, does it four times, puts it together with any other moves you've learned, then moves on.  This is beginner-friendly.  Then the Showtime at the end gives something to advanced viewers.  This is my opinion of the sections on the DVD.

Warm-Up-This is about 5 minutes and it includes some warm-up dance moves as well as some stretching for the legs.  It is nice and it does warm you up.

Jazz Funk-Tabitha calls this routine ""sassy.""  I found it to rather to be hip-hop choreography with a definite fusion of jazz dance moves, as well.  It's fun and smooth.

Hip-Hop-Tabitha describes this routine as ""tough.""  I found it to be mostly street hip-hop with a few elements of dancey hip-hop mixed in.  It's my favorite segment.

90's Jam-Tabitha refers to this routine as the ""old-school"" routine, but it's just 90's hip-hop moves.  It is fun, but there is one move that takes up 2 8-counts, and you are constantly doing the same move both of those 8-counts, which I felt a bit repetitive, but this is still a great section.

Showtime-Tabitha does each routine through 6 times with a short 10 second break in between each time.  The great thing, I thought, is that there is pretty much constant movement.  As an advanced exerciser, I do this routine 3 times through, and get better cardio benefits than having to do all of the teaching.  Another great thing is that for each style the music changes so you never get sick of the music.

Cool-Down-This is just a slower hip-hop dance routine that Tabitha teaches in 3 minutes.  One of the moves stretches the side of your body, but there is no stretching other than that.  It does cool-you down, but it doesn't follow through with stretching which I was unhappy about.

This is a fun DVD if you like hip-hop dance.  It is easier than ""Dance It Off"" because Tabitha doesn't try to fit a lot of choreography into each routine.  There are really just about 4 moves per routine.  It is a great DVD for beginners, and advanced exercisers will appreciate the Showtime segment at the end.",1260835200,2,2591,4.488222698072805
2991548,5,B000WTVZEY,"I own a lot of dance videos (many by Prevention) and like this one the best by far. Once you learn the steps, you can do the 10 minute workout at the end that combines everything you learn in the ""teaching"" segment of the workout (kudos to Prevention for adding that 10 minute segment .. I haven't found that in any of my other Prevention dance DVDs). If you ""stumble"" on the steps (or forget), you can always go back and review them slower in the ""teaching"" (beginning) of the video. I found the combinations interesting and stimulating and most of all fun to dance to! I can use some of these moves on the dance floor too! I enjoyed the energy of the instructor, Tabitha D'umo...plan to look for more done by her. Thanks Prevention for a quality product.",1217548800,,756,4.4071428571428575
2991549,2,B000WTVZEY,"Of all the Prevention Fitness DVD's I have this one
is for me complicated to learn and follow.
I find that I am shown much too quickly (twice)how to do
the moves and soon are asked to follow in a quick pace
and since its mirrored I have a hard time
""getting"" some of the moves and although I try this video
again and again I can't really follow them all which is frustrating.
Some of the dances in this dvd are easy to follow.
All in all I do not use it too often because of that.

The steps are a little complicated, so my guess is that I'll have to try it again and again and again before I can even get through the routine without messing up (I like to keep up!).

The instruction (especially the cuing) provided by Tabitha D'umo is severly lackly and I agree with another reviewer that not enough camera time is spent following the dancers lower bodies to enable you to get the choreography down.

2991555,2,B000WTVZEY,"I have a number of dance videos and I found this one to be a bit on the disappointing side.  Here are my concerns:

1. Almost all of the dance steps are taught in half time. This really slows down and pace and the cardio workout.  At full tempo, the dance steps are very fast, which makes them difficult to do.  I would have preferred a more moderate pace with less difficult steps to keep the workout moving.

After the routine is learned, many will find the teaching segments to be boring.  Others will find the steps at full tempo to be too fast for them to do.  I recently purchased another cardio video that taught all of the steps in half time, moving to full tempo, in a separate chapter.  That was a great approach, so the regular chapters workout did not get slowed down.

2. Like most dance videos, the instructor builds on prior moves.  The initial sets of moves got repeated a lot, but I found it difficult to learn the last set of steps within a routine.  They were only shown a couple of times and then it was back to the top again.

3. Sometimes there were text cues for the next dance move on the screen.  I would prefer adequate verbal cues so that text cues are unnecessary. There are no text cues in the show piece.  This is where the text cues would have been helpful because the instructor cuts down on the verbal cues.

4.  The camera work had a lot to be desired.  There were MANY closeups of the dancers from the waist up, so obviously the director/camera person/film editor didn't have experience doing dance videos.  You're trying to learn a new step and you get lots of upper-body shots.  It is just fine to focus on the background dancers, but give me full body shots, not upper half.

5.  After a warm-up and three 10 minute segments of teaching, the video climaxes with the show dance segment, which puts together the 3 prior routines at full tempo.  After I get the dances down, I will probably just skip the teaching segments and do the show segment several times (with the warm-up and cool-down).

Like with many dance videos, I try to learn the dance steps first and then add on the arms.  My favorite instructor is Jennifer Galardi, who has videos under the Crunch, Prevention, and Dance Off labels.  For me, she is the gold standard for good teaching, cuing, and properly paced routines.  It takes some repetition to learn the routines, which is a good because it keeps the workout interesting.  I get a good workout without getting bored.",1201737600,27,2475,4.442222222222222

8225438,3,B000WTVZEY,"Ms. D'urmo is a clear, precise instructor. I hate all the 'music' and found the combinations undancy. But then I don't like the movement of the time and was looking for a smoother exercise method. Bored with all the PREVENTION hype.",1373068800,,232,4.682926829268292

8225440,3,B000WTVZEY,"This dvd is fine, it just isn't very challenging.  Other than learning the new steps - there is nothing challenging about it.......maybe I am just farther along in my progress than I thought.......",1298764800,,197,4.96969696969697
8225441,2,B000WTVZEY,"Of the 3 Prevention Dance DVDs this one was the most lacking.  While the Dance moves were pretty cool the instructor needed to break a huge portion of the moves down taking the pace to 1/2 time.  You just don't get any aerobic effect at this pace.  I suspect if you are an experienced dancer you could watch the DVD a few times and then use it by just repeating the Dance segment ending where they do the dance to tempo a couple times to get your 20 minutes of Cardio.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prevention-Fitness-Systems-Express-Workout-Dance-it-Off/dp/B000B7QCOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prevention Fitness Systems - Express Workout: Dance it Off!</a>&nbsp;does much simpler steps, more like steps you might do at a dance club, but has no 1/2 tempo moves so is more like a fitness video.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prevention-Fitness-Systems-Dance-Yourself-Thin/dp/B000FZETV6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prevention Fitness Systems - Dance Yourself Thin</a>&nbsp;is also a good one, and while has a few spots of 1/2 tempo keeps moving enough to give you a work out.",1289260800,,1164,6.3081761006289305
8225442,4,B000WTVZEY,"It's fun. Love the routine, this will make you sweating. The songs is a bit boring and not loud enough (using computer to open). Not too difficult to follow but not that easy too. You will need some practicing time.",1272844800,,215,4.4
8225443,1,B000WTVZEY,They spend too much time showing too many very complicated and detailed moves yet hardly any time with your heart rate really up. What a waste of time. They how you 100 moves in each segnment with no time to practice and your heart rates really not getting up or steady. I wouldnt call this a workout video I'd call it an instructional dance video. not enough cardio here. dissapointing..,1268697600,3,388,4.557142857142857
