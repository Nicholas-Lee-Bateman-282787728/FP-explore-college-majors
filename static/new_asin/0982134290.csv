7915296,4,0982134290,"A recorded presentation/seminar on long-distance triathlon which offers very practical and easy-to-grasp advice/tips when participating in Ironman-distance triathlons (Ironman, 70.3, long-course ITU Tri events, etcs). Key here is how to execute your race plan, which differentiates this from other Triathlon DVDs that dispense advises or guides you on Tri training.

Don't expect motivational Triathlon videos (you can get this free from Youtube), or specific regimen on triathlon training. It's about what happens on Race Day.

A good supplement for your other Triathlon Training DVDs & Tri Books.",1389484800,,598,5.862068965517241
7915297,1,0982134290,I thought that there would be some actual footage of a triathalon. I was mistaken. Just two guys standing in front of a chalkboard for two hours.  Breathtakingly Boring!  They could have released this on an Audio CD.  No action at all.,1329696000,,235,4.5476190476190474
7915298,5,0982134290,"The commentary was a bit dry by these two guys, but who cares?! The new perspective they present on Ironman triathlon is absolutely critical for people to realize!! This video will help me without a doubt in my Ironman triathlon.",1329350400,,229,4.75
7915299,5,0982134290,"This disk is an extended talk by the authors on how to race an ironman.  The focus is not on training, but on how best to use the training you have already done on race day.  If you are new to the distance but have done other triathlons, you should be aware that in many ways the IM is a completely different event, and this talk helps you figure out how to do your best with what you have.  It is a good stand-alone product..

The disk is also an intro to the Endurance Nation coaching system.  The authors sell training plans and also administer an on-line coaching/community system that takes a somewhat contrarian view of  how to train for IM distance.  Over the ""out season"", they advocate doing quality bike and run work in order to get faster while eschewing much by way of long, slow distance work, swimming, and weight training.  Then they advocate a fairly short (approx 12 week) buildup in volume for the HIM and IM distances.  The central thesis is that the traditional base-building then speed-building approach to triathlon fails at the IM distance because no one can handle both the increase in volume and speed simultaneously.  They are also big on maximizing your return on invested time.  (The prescription not to swim during winter is a prime example of this.)

Part of the EN philosophy is that there are different levels at which one can be involved. They have an active free presence on Facebook and Twitter.  They podcast frequently.  Some version of this talk is given free and publicly at almost all the North American IM events a few days before the race.  You can also subscribe to a free level of service (as of late summer 2010) called EN Fan, at which you can get significant discounts on various items (e.g., this disk...).  The next step up is buying specific plans, and finally becoming a member of the EN web community (which includes plans).

So, ultimately, this disk is both an introduction to a system and a standalone product.  It would be a great gift to a spouse or relative who is thinking about and/or training for an ironman.  If looking at it for yourself, I think Rich and Patrick would both suggest that you explore their world a bit on the net first and you'll undoubtedly find a less-than-full-price way of getting it.

Full disclosure:  I have been a member/customer of EN and have been very pleased with the results I got.",1282176000,2,2373,4.589073634204276
7915300,5,0982134290,"How many people do you know that are in AWESOME shape but yet blow it on race day?  If you are involved in long-distance triathons, you probably know a few.  Heck, it could be you.

The simple fact of the matter is there are literally hundereds of books on how to TRAIN to run/bike/swim faster and harder, but very few resources on how to RACE correctly.  Rich and Patrick from Endurance Nation walk you through the key concepts on how to execute to the best of your ability on all that fitness you've built up during your training.  They also give some great tips on what to do the week leading up to the race in order to shift from a training focus to an execution focus in your head.

If you are a first-time Ironman racer or someone that is unhappy with how their races have gone in the past, you owe it to yourself to watch this DVD a few times.  The message is simple, but it takes awhile to sink in (it did for me).  Considering how much us triathletes blow on the latest carbon gadget that saves us 20grams, this DVD might be the best return on investment you can make for your next Ironman race.",1254960000,5,1104,4.223809523809524
7915301,5,0982134290,"This is an excellent DVD. I watched it 4-5 times before my first IM in 2008. I used the 4 keys the coaches preach through my entire IM and easily knocked off 30mins to an 1hour of where I would have been with out watching the DVD.

The other thing I like is the section on equipment and gear required. I am not the most organised person in the world and the coaches advice saved me a lot of stress in the days leading up to the race.

All in All very happy with this purchase and would recommend it.",1222819200,7,499,3.98
