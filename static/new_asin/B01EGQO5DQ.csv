The film begins in Switzerland. Two men enter a caf, and old man meets them to give them orders. They plan to steal a bombsight from Dr. Franz Tobel. [Did you notice the clue?] Will the spies be fooled by an impersonation? Can they be flown out of the country at night? They arrive safely in London. Mission accomplished? There seems to be some trickery here. [Or a lack of security?] What is Dr. Tobel drawing? Who is after him? Holmes explains his deductions. The bombsight is tested on Salisbury Plain [it looks like the western desert of the USA]. Will it revolutionize aerial bombardment? There are scenes of London. Dr. Tobel wants to work independently without unwanted attention. The bombsight is composed of four parts, each one produced at independent workshops. [Are all telephone calls monitored by a government agency?]

When Dr. Tobel goes missing Sherlock Holmes looks for him while disguised. Holmes finds a person who knows something. Will he walk into a trap? Will Moriarity eliminate Holmes at last? Or will his plot fail? There is a trick to raise the writing from an impression on the paper beneath. Can they decipher the code? What if the men named are dead? ""What is the name of the fourth man?"" Holmes figured out the trick. Will Moriarity? Who has the better plan? ""A keen observation."" ""You've played into my hands."" Will Lestrade and Watson arrive in time? Will Moriarity fall into his own trap for an ironic ending? [What about the sequel?]",1501977600,,1518,4.790076335877862
