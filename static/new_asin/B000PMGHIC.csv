2825699,3,B000PMGHIC,"Cute little movie, no obvious flaws, clean flow.  An easy watch for a rainy Sunday.  However, as I was watching I decided to do a quick internet search for the adorable Lois Butler and...nothing.  She married Hall Bartlett (writer producer, director)the same year this film came out.  Or did she?  Apparently there is a discrepancy on this little fact as his other two wives show up on his bio but she is Lois is rarely mentioned.  All I can find is that she stopped working after she was married.  I can deduce from Hal's reputation and career they divorced soon after.  After that, nothing until she dies in 1989 at the young age of 58.  Now I'm intrigued.  I can't help wondering what happened to her and if she died content, or if the story took a tragic turn.
If anyone has any info, let me know.  And then do her legacy a favor and post the info over at IMDB.
Thanks.",1377043200,,873,4.327160493827161
2825700,4,B000PMGHIC,"It's a pity Lois didn't do more films, as she had a lovely voice. This is silly by today's standards, but continues to be an entertaining film.",1372982400,,143,4.333333333333333

2825704,5,B000PMGHIC,"I chose a five star rating because I'm thrilled to be able to view this movie again.  I last saw it when I was 13 (54 years ago) and loved it.  I really thought I'd never see it again.  Yes it shows its age - but it takes me back to 1959.  A simpler, more romantic time.",1367280000,2,270,3.6842105263157894
2825705,5,B000PMGHIC,"This is a great family movie with a great plot young girl helps father find a wife.  Hattie McDaniel does a great job as the maid with lots of great lines,",1292198400,4,155,4.0
2825706,5,B000PMGHIC,"Mickey Kelley (Lois Butler, Indianapolis native) is a tomboy loving baseball and growing up as a doctor's daughter in a small town in Indiana.  At age 15, she has a father, George (Bill Goodwin) that's beginning to get the idea he needs to remarry to give his daughter a mother/female figure.  The likely catch in town, Lydia (Rose Hobart), encourages her expected role as the new mom.

Mickey's neighbor friend helps her plot against the mom-to-be, the one with the geek violin playing son, and encourages instead, the friends visiting Aunt Louise (Irene Hervey).  Lots goes wrong and gets everyone upset till the correct information surfaces.

Mickey gets plenty of chances to sing, which she does well at her young age.  She trades in her Tiger's baseball jersey for a formal, several of which the lady viewers will enjoy seeing in their 40's dress style.  The automobiles would today be worth a small fortune.  A fun look at life back in the days of ""Father Knows Best"" except this father didn't get it all quite right along the way.

A great nostalgic movie, with violence limited to a couple of fisticuffs, skin shots limited to bare shoulders, and language dropping to just the occasional ""darn"".

The story is loosely based upon Peggy Goodin's book ""Clementine"".  The author was from Bluffton, Indiana and not related to the Hoosier lead actress or Bill Goodwin, the lead male actor.  The book is as good as the movie and different enough you'll want to read it as well as watch the movie.  The title was changed because another movie running at the time conflicted with the same name.  Thus the girl Clementine or ""Clem"" was also changed to Mickey.  You'll recognize several of the songs as well.  Wholesome DVD viewing from the past.",1215129600,10,1743,4.7792642140468224
2825707,5,B000PMGHIC,"Bill Goodwin portrays Lois Butler's father in this 1948 vintage classic comedy film.  Mickey is a tomboy whose dad is a widow & set to marry a society snob who has every intention of taking over after she becomes Mickey's stepmother.  However, Mickey's friend's (Beverly Wills) aunt (Irene Hervey) is in town & acts as somewhat of a surrogate mother to Mickey.  The two warm quickly to each other & Mickey sets out to point cupid's arrow in the direction of this woman & her father.  Irene Hervey & Bill Goodwin would later reunite for the 1958 film, Going Steady.  The chemistry between the two is apparent & makes the interaction between them (Goodwin & Hervey) even more realistic & enjoyable.  Hattie McDaniel turns in a fine performance as the feisty housekeeper, as does Skip Homeier, & Rose Hobart.  Worth the viewing time & worth adding to your library.",1195689600,8,861,4.738255033557047

2825710,3,B000PMGHIC,"Sort of cute. Like an early 1950's TV show in writing and acting quality. Color is there, but of poor quality. Lois Butler has a beautiful voice, and there are quite a few songs. Seems she only made two more movies and then disappeared.",1461110400,,236,4.386363636363637

2825712,5,B000PMGHIC,"Movie a bit outdated but hey, this was back in  1948 (when I was born) so what can you expect. I love old movies because they are usually  human interest stories and don't have foul language or steamy sex scenes and this fit all of those things. I loved seeing Hattie McDaniel again in a movie (haven't seen her since ""Gone With The Wind"") because she usually plays the part of someone with a lot of common sense--and she filled that part here too. Mickey reminded me of a younger Judy Garland, can't put my finger on why, but she just did. And her boy friend made me think of Jimmy Stewart with the way he talked and acted. There was slang used in the movie that isn't used to day--we just substitute other words--example, ""toddling around"" I would think meant ""fooling around"" now.

I was looking for something with little light comedy and this hit the spot. The funniest part to me was when the father thought his daughter (Mickey) was making out with an older man. Since others have already more or less told the story, I just wanted to tell you why I liked the movie.",1458518400,,1072,4.376884422110553

8192614,4,B000PMGHIC,"[Spoiler follows!] It's horrible but nice. Mickey is a tomboy who experiences a rush of lady hormones when she's wrestling a boy and seeks the help of an older lady who herself realizes the importance of looking alluring thanks to seeing herself through Mickey's eyes. The movie climaxes when Mickey, finally transformed into a God-intended, natural woman, ready to be virtuous and pretty for a good man, seems ready to lose everything that matters when her virtue comes into question. All because of a conniving harpy of a widow-woman seeking to get her manipulative claws into Mickey's successful and widowed doctor father. The singing and costumes are fantastic.",1481673600,,665,5.166666666666667

8192616,3,B000PMGHIC,"""Mickey"" has many sweet moments, and Lois Butler who portrays her acts well and has a beautiful singing voice--which, in my opinion, was overused in the movie, often disrupting the flow of the storyline. That storyline followed basic romcom patterns, but unfortunately introduced too many silly moments and implausible situations. 3 stars",1475280000,,338,5.519230769230769
