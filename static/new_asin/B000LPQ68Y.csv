8163115,4,B000LPQ68Y,"Aaron Kwok stars as Frank, a rich young man who is estranged from his father after an accident which resulted in the death of his mother. Celia is a young girl who sells herself into prostitution to raise money to free her brother from jail. When Celia is framed for murder she goes into hiding with Frank's help.

I really enjoyed Moment of Romance II. The characters were realistic, entertaining and very brave. I particularly liked the relationship between  Jack and Frank, and Celia's character.

I did find Celia to be a bit of a Mary Sue. She is entirely selfless, honest, and good which gets a bit old after awhile. Her interferance between Frank & his father was a tad sappy. I also felt some of the motorcycle stuff went on a bit long for my tastes.

Overall, an entertaining film, sure to delight fans of HK romance.",1186444800,,826,4.523489932885906
8163116,5,B000LPQ68Y,"This part of ""A Moment of Romance""is much different from the first part,although the bike is the part of these two movies but the story is totally different.
The romantic story that happened with the leading actor and actress is much different and also the character of them in this movie too.
It is the romance story that could make people believe in""Human Kind"" it could make people believe that love can begin with kindness that happened between them.
The well performance of Wu Chien Lien could make audience touch the different amoung these 2 characters of leading actress between the first part and the second part of ""The Moment of Romance"",the first part she played wealthy girl,but in this part she played the character that totally opposite site of the first part while compare with society'classes,she could make people believe that love can happened amoung difference of society'classes,she really could make audiences feel and believe in their real loves.",1069977600,,968,5.05625
8163117,5,B000LPQ68Y,"Having read my previous review on ""Moment of Romance II"", I discovered my review did not do the movie justice. So here goes:
""A Moment of Romance II"" is filled with unpredictable turns of events. Character development is surprisingly strong, and the plot is successful in realistically weaving in many characters' conflicts. Heavenly King Aaron Kwok (""The Storm Riders"", ""China Strike Force"") gives one of his best performances, and he brings out feelings from the audience.
""A Moment of Romance II"" consists of romance without being ridiculous. It also has beautiful motorcycle racing scenes that are a must-see, for they far override the racing scenes of Andy Lau's ""Full Throttle."" Unpredictable, and filled with relationships that the majority of an audience can relate to. Relationships like boyfriend-girlfriend, sister-brother, father-son, mother-son, best friends, and boss-employee. With mixed stories in the film, it never confuses an audience, for plot development is so evident. And to top it all off, it's not one of those corny happy-ending movies. A sensitive person may even manage tears. The score/music itself can choke up someone, with beautiful melodies and touching lyrics. Definitely worth buying. The soundtrack and other Aaron Kwok movies are also recommended. - Priscilla",993686400,,1296,5.485
8163118,5,B000LPQ68Y,"A Moment of Romance is filled with unpredictable turns of events. Both Aaron Kwok and the girl, sorry I don't the name, have talented acting skills... and this movie has a well-developed plot and the music and songs  are excellent - the soundtrack is recommended. This has a very sad  storyline & even if you don't know Chinese, subtitles are still good  enough to make you touched. Filled with action, not-so direct romance, and  special effects. (motorcycle racers, this is great!) PS... all Aaron Kwok  movies are highly recommended.",952128000,,536,4.977528089887641
