8576763,2,B00C2U6HJ4,"This DVD of questionable legal origin has finally been released after being delayed a few months past the original release date. Though the quality is in some respects not as bad one might expect, the presentation is still on the half-assed side, so I'm reviewing it as a public service.

Starting with the cover itself, the image is a harbinger of things to come. The mustachioed gent pictured is not Don Van Vliet; it's anyone's guess who is actually depicted here. The back cover does actually feature a photo of Don, though eagle-eyed consumers will notice that the track listing advertised earlier in the year bears no relation to what's actually on this disc. That original lineup was:

Who Do You Think You're Foolin'?
Diddy Wah Diddy
If You Got Ears
She's Too Much For My Mirror
My Human Gets Me The Blues
Old Folks Boogie
Hair Pie
When Big Joan Sets Up
Woe is Uh Me Bop
Bellerin Plain
Instrumental For Feet & Fingers

The songs actually included are:

Electricity
Sure Nuff Yes I Do
I'm Gonna Booglarize You
Mirror Man
Upon The My O My
Full Moon
Crazy Little Thing
Improvisation
Peaches
Take Me To Your House
You're Gonna Need Somebody
Upon The My O My (Special Edition)
This Is The Day
Mirror Man (Special Edition)
Click Clack

This complete shake-up is not a good sign. Considering for instance that ""Who Do You Think You're Foolin'?"" and ""Diddy Wah Diddy"" must have been the 1966 ""Where the Action Is"" footage that is owned by Dick Clark Productions, and ""When Big Joan Sets Up,"" ""WoeisuhMeBop,"" ""Bellerin' Plain,"" and ""Instrumental For Feet & Fingers"" was certainly the 1970 Detroit Tubeworks footage currently administered by Reelin' In The Years Productions, it's not unreasonable to speculate that in both cases the owners of said footage caught wind of this release and blocked the clips' inclusion.

As for the actual video content, the quality ranges from fairly decent to mediocre. The source materials expectedly betray their age and sometimes low-budget origins, and I have no issue with that; it's simply a fact with materials of this vintage. Unfortunately, in each clip it is evident to me as a video professional that the source materials used were not taken directly from the master tapes but rather from what are clearly sub-masters, and prepared for DVD at a resolution that sometimes betrays glaring compression artifacts, especially if viewed on a larger monitor (I viewed this disc on a 60"" 1080i screen, and eventually chose to view at half size as that was easier on the eyes). With a few exceptions however, less demanding viewers might find the quality perfectly acceptable, especially if viewed on say, a computer monitor.

The clip-by-clip breakdown:

* Electricity
* Sure Nuff Yes I Do

Cannes Beach, 1968 MIDEM Pop Festival. Quality is very good, but the ""Bouton Rouge"" title card at the beginning has been removed.

* I'm Gonna Booglarize You

Beat Club, 1972. The first couple notes of Bill Harkelroad's guitar intro have been inexplicably cut off, otherwise the quality is decent though a shade less sharp than has been seen on other official releases.

* Mirror Man
* Upon The My O My
* Full Moon
* Crazy Little Thing
* Improvisation
* Peaches
* Take Me To Your House
* You're Gonna Need Somebody

The ""Tragic Band"" live HEC, Jouy-en-Josas, Paris, France May 24, 1974. I've listed the titles as they appear on the sleeve, but Beefheart fans familiar with this performance know that penultimate track is actually a cover of Howlin Wolf's ""Who Will Be Next?"" The date ""1974"" is superimposed over the upper-right hand corner of the frame or the duration of these clips. Quality is OK but there are some very noticeable compression artifacts, and a glitch during ""You're Gonna Need Somebody On Your Bond"" that is not present in the source material.

* Upon The My O My (Special Edition)
* This Is The Day

Old Grey Whistle Test, 1974. No idea what ""Special Edition"" means, as these are the clips as already widely circulated. The first few notes of the intro to ""Upon the My-O-My"" are cut off, and a few moments of ""This Is The Day"" seem sourced from a VHS tape; otherwise the quality is the same caliber as the ""Booglarize"" clip.

* Mirror Man (Special Edition)

Dutch ""Pink Pop"" Festival, 1974. Again no idea what ""Special Edition"" means in this context, unless it refers to the fact that the clip as it appears here is exactly as seen on YouTube ([...]), albeit with ninety seconds clipped from the opening, and a minute lopped off the tail. Inexplicable and inexcusable.

* Click Clack

Bataclan, Paris, 1972. Worst quality on the set, looks like it was taken directly from a copy encoded at low resolution at half the normal frame rate. The opening title card has been snipped off, so consequently the first few seconds of the song are missing as well.

There you have it. In some ways better than expected, in others worse than it has any reason to be, but in overall presentation not at all reflective of the respect the artists deserve.

8576764,4,B00C2U6HJ4,"This says it is all region. I am in the USA. I am not totally versed in this matter of regions. The case says it is  region code 0. Amazon says it is all region. I put in in my Sony Blu-ray and got an error message. I put it in my Oppo dvd player (which does play discs from Britain and DVD-A titles). It plays fine in Oppo player. so if you are considering purchase you may need to investigate whether this will actually play on your player.

The audio content is good. The bleating sax of the Tragic Band does become a concern.

Video Content? Well I'm watching it now and The Cannes Beach footage of Electricity and Sure Nuff are the clearest I've seen, I'm pleased with that.
Booglarize from Beat Club is as good as any that I've seen.
Next up Mirror Man, Upon the My O My, Full Moon, Crazy Little Thing, w/ ""Tragic Band"" good, better than I've seen previously. Improvisation, (I'll call it Sweet Georgia Brown) has some minor defects with an on screen apology!. Peaches looks good.  Take me to your House, a tragic  band long intro  has Don sprinkling notes from the sax onto the crowd. Don appears to be having fun  on this unfamiliar tune, this segues into You're Gonna Need Somebody.

Another Upon the My O My in a studio with Tragic Band. I've seen this before, here it looks as good as any I've seen. it is clear. Now a surprise for me, This is the Day performed with TB. It looks good and Don's vocals are passionate and very much in control, damn that flute solo.

Mirror Man (Special Edition) Grainy footage of CB & TB arriving @Euro airport and  clearer footage @ Pink Pop.

Last is Click Clack with Magic Band. Slightly grainy somewhat poorly lit , yet still very watchable.

Ok. so my point is check the region for your viewing and obviously its unfortunate that it is less Magic and more Tragic but in 2013 that is OK.",1376697600,8,1835,4.3023255813953485
