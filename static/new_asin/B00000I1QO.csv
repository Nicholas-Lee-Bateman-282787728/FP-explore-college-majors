the story is about earth after 2 years.it had become a battleground and tetsuro is in the middle fighting those machine bodies,he later gets a telegram from maetel to board the GE999 and head on an adventure to destroy the main mechanoid planet.
This movie isn't as good as the original,a second best but if you love GE999 then you might like it",1049846400,,437,4.341463414634147
7909303,5,B00000I1QO,"The graphics are so well-done I couldn't help but marvel at them. The story is well-written,and the music beautifully
orchestrated. Some scenes may frighten children,so parents
please use caution when letting your kids watch this movie.",1009152000,,236,5.583333333333333
7909304,4,B00000I1QO,"It's strange, this anime has all the things I hate: Bad art, bad dubbing, cheesey music but I found myself really enjoying it when I saw it recently. It's really rather entertaining. It's got such an interesting plot and cast of characters that the art and voices don't drag the film down (like some other anime) If you've been trying to decide if you'd like to watch this or not (like I was) go for it. You might enjoy it",994723200,,422,4.2875
7909305,5,B00000I1QO,"I'm a very big fan of anime and manga,and I too first saw this movie on the sci-fi channel series. Watching anime since I was 3 gives me a good perspective of the art and patience. Very Very well done.",963705600,2,201,4.05
7909306,4,B00000I1QO,"More of a continuation than a sequel, Adieu Galaxy Express 999 gives the story of Tetsuro's father, who bears some distant resemblance to Darth Vader (must be the helmet and the cloak).  We get to meet some new  characters in this coming-of-age story, and delve deeper into the mystery  of the mechanical people.  Crystal Clare is missing from this trip,  replaced by a snobbish mech named Metal Mina.  There is the usual mix of  beautiful scenery, science fiction action, and philosophical musing of the  meaning of existance.  This is not as good as its predessor, but is still  highly reccomended.  Take the time to watch the movie all the way through  in one sitting.  Of course, Captain Harlock and Emeraldas will be showing  up along the way.  All aboard!",961545600,5,761,4.790697674418604
7909307,5,B00000I1QO,Normaly I am not a big old-fashion anime movie watcher.  I once saw this movie on the Sci-Fi channel.  I have to say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life!  This movie is incredibly well scripted  and the plot is amazing.  It is suspenseful and amazing to watch.  I  strongly recomened that anybody who is looking for a great movie with an  amazing story line which will intrigue you and move you to see this  outstanding movie.  I strongly recomened this!,947289600,5,482,4.314606741573034
7909308,5,B00000I1QO,"This sequil to the original Galaxy Express 999 is excellent. The artwork is of the same quality as the first 'three nine'. If you have seen the first Galaxy Express 999 movie, then this one is a 'must see'. A lot of the  questions left unanswered by the first movie are answered in this one.  Although many would say Galaxy Express 999 is dated, this is still one of  the finest anime movies I have ever seen. Although no one particular aspect  of Galaxy Express stands out as the best in anime, when you combine every  thing together, story, character's, artwork, music, etc, you have what  amounts to one of the all time classics. This is one of those you will  watch over and over again! Another nice thing about this video is that you  are not totally lost if you have not had the opportunity to see the first  Galaxy Express 999. But, if you get a chance, the first Galaxy Express 999  is equally as good and well worth finding and viewing. I would have to rate  both Adieu Galaxy Express 999 and the first one, Galaxy Express 999 as my  two favorite anime videos.",942883200,5,1069,4.370558375634518
7909309,5,B00000I1QO,The continuing adventures of Tetsuro Hoshino and Maetel is the best thing this movie has going for it. The animation is colorful and bright and the music superb. Very lush and beautiful.,934243200,,186,4.84375
