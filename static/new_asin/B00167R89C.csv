8261450,5,B00167R89C,"Being directed by Hitchcock, people tend to overlook that the story was writing credits Thornton Niven Wilder who wrote ""Our Town"" three years earlier.
Teresa Wright one year earlier was in ""Mrs. Miniver""

This film is creepy from the beginning as Charlie (Joseph Cotton) goes to his hometown to avoid two mysterious men following him. Who are they and what do they want of him?

Mean while back home things are just down right monotonous. Little Charlie (Teresa Wright) plans to send a telegram to Uncle Charlie to come and brighten up the place. She realizes she possesses telepathy when Uncle Charlie's telegram reaches her first. When Uncle Charlie arrives he brings secrets and the two mysterious men show up as magazine men doing a survey. Little Charlie must find the secrets and why the men are there. Each scene and secret reveals a more sinister environment. It just gets creepier.

The film and the camera angles are exceptional. The dialog helps build up the tension. Yet on this VHS copy I can not help but thing that some scenes were cut or something to that affect. One minute Little Charlie is walking happily with her quasi date. The next moment she is being apologized to for being deceived as he reveals his purpose. I wonder how many more scenes were cut or condensed.

However you will want to keep a copy of this classic.",1522800000,,1343,4.702127659574468

The film opens on a long-gone city scene: boys are playing baseball in the street with no automobile traffic. A landlady tells a roomer that two gentlemen were looking for him; they said they were friends. He leaves and they follow him. Uncle Charlie decides to visit his relatives in Santa Rosa California. Little Ann gets the message. The steam-powered locomotive pulls into the station to meet the waiting family. All are happy. Uncle Charlie presents a wrist-watch to his banker brother-in-law, a novelty for him. We learn about the family. Charlie gives an emerald ring to his niece, named Charlene after him. His niece now thinks of a tune - ""The Merry Widow Waltz"". This banker has in interest in true crime stories. There is a funny incident with the daily newspaper. Niece Charlie is a sharp observer and figures out the trick. But we see a hidden side of Uncle Charlie.

We learn that two men want to interview the family and take their photographs. Uncle Charlie doesn't like that! (He must have left a back trail.) When he visits the bank he makes jokes in poor taste (displaying a contempt for his relatives). Uncle Charlie demands the film after he is accidentally photographed. Niece Charlie figures out the ""reporter"" is a detective, and he tells her about the search for an unknown subject who is a murderer of rich widows! At the dinner table Uncle Charlie shows his contempt for old rich widows. There is an odd discussion about poisoning by a neighbor Herb. Charlie runs off, and Uncle Charlie takes her to a cocktail lounge for a chat. He twists a napkin to symbolize his nervousness and troubled mind. Later niece Charlie is warned by a detective that the photograph was sent east and they could arrest her uncle in two hours. But fresh news points to a solved case, by default. It seems to be over. But new events bring danger from accidents. Uncle Charlie presents a speech, then announces he is being called away on personal business. At the railroad station there is a final chapter to this story. [I found the ending improbable.]

Alfred Hitchcock's films often show the horrors that can pop up in everyday life in a small town, or a large city. Crime and violence are mostly suggested, except at the ending. Imagine having a distant relative who was a serial killer? This film presents small town life around 1943. The war is hinted at by the men in uniform. No mention of rationing. It is a forerunner to those TV dramas that portray parents as bumbling fools oblivious to the realities of teen-age life. The discussion about crime (or sports) suggest the censorship that forbids that forbids any mention of politics, the economy, or the unmentionable war. They didn't want to upset their customers.",1437696000,,2758,4.72972972972973
