My loss really as on the evidence here he is a very intelligent fun loving chap with what appears to be a real zest for life and quirky things. The show is not really a conventional stand up routine though there is some in here. There is a lot of use of musical props and song and Bailey seems to bring together a very conspiratorial vibe to the show in that the audience feel they are part of it. For this to come across even on DVD is a testament to his skills in this area.

As the show progresses it is clear that Bailey is not one of those comedians who relies on masses of profanity to get laughs nor is he a one subject diatribe. In fact seeing this made me want to get my hands on more of his stuff and certainly see him live if the chance ever presents itself.

By the way, the special features are well worth looking through as well for an insight into the guy himself and his touring.",1529107200,,989,4.119170984455959

8432137,5,B004K1ZKXM,"One thing that makes you appreciate stand-up comedy is getting on stage yourself and giving it a go. Many think ""I could do better than that"", but until they get up onto a stage, it's all hot air.

Reading reviews of this you might get the impression that Bill Bailey has lost his way and that he's not as funny as he used to be. This is far from the case as he has an exceedingly rare gift of making almost everything funny. As an example there is his much cited 'Oud' skit which appears to be an ad lib and yet is the funniest bit of the show.

There is also his gift with songs, which most comedians seem to lose in their 30's, but Bill Bailey still has in abundance. Songs he does include his French version of Gary Numan's 'Cars', an internet love ballad (with all the appropriate l33t metaphors - e.g. LOL, ROFL etc) and even a hip-hop song.
In fact, in this one show there are more songs than on all Bill Hicks' comedy albums put together!

All this being said, the show does lack a central theme. According to the sleeve, it's supposed to be 'doubt' but this ends up just being a one-liner. This is not a problem though as the show just seems to follow Bill Bailey's whimsical train of thought and he is skillful in never hitting a wrong comedic note.

To sum up, feel free to ignore the negative reviews of this DVD as really Bill Bailey is still on good form and you need only look up video clips from this DVD to see that he is enduringly funny.
That said, I apologise if you don't find it funny. I personally found that 90% of the material hit the mark and that it is the work of a gifted comic who is at ease on stage. If we disagree then it is probably out of admiration for a true craftsman...",1306627200,,1708,4.151057401812689
