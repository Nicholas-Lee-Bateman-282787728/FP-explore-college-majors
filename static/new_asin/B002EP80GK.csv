8368059,3,B002EP80GK,"It's unfortunate and very odd that no names are shown during the film to tell us who was talking or playing when it was someone as notable as Mike Seeger (Pete Seeger's brother), he had numerous things to say throughout, there were probably many other notable people too that I'm not familiar with. I had no idea who he was until the all the names were listed in credits at end, I saw Mike's name, googled it, saw photo and it was like, ""Wow, wish I would of known that"". Other than that, it was a nice collection of informal interviews with many people and gave me a good idea of what this music is all about and what the people are all about too.",1418774400,2,648,4.192

8368061,3,B002EP80GK,"This is obviously a low-budget feature, but the kind of people interested in watching this film probably won't mind.  The people interviewed are very enthusiastic about old-time music, though sometimes to the point of being a little overly-obsessed.  They spent a while building up a dichotomy between old-time and bluegrass music which became pretentious and unnecessary after a while.  I would have enjoyed a little more music and a little less talk, but otherwise this was an enjoyable film.  If you are interested and have a few bucks to stream it, I'd recommend it.",1361145600,,570,5.031914893617022
8368062,5,B002EP80GK,"This is an excellent glimpse into the world of Old-Time music.  Lots and lots of interviews with folks who love it and play it.  There wasn't as much footage of people actually playing the music in the film as I would have liked, but then I was pleasantly surprised to see many songs available to view in the special features section of the DVD.  The setting of the film seems to be at one particular festival, the name of which was never revealed, which seemed a bit odd.

Another thing I found odd was that there were no names placed with the faces of the people interviewed throughout the film.  At the end, during the credits, it rolls out names listed as they appeared, but I'm not sure anyone could figure it out that way.  As a person wanted to learn more about this genre, it would have been helpful to put names with faces for further study.  The fact that this didn't happen honestly puzzles me.

My favorite thing about the film was that it was kept clean, meaning anyone can watch it with their kids.  I don't remember hearing any profanity or anything inappropriate.  That is important to me, so I really appreciated that.

I think this is a great place to start if you're curious about the genre of Old-Time music; the quality is top-notch, the footage is good, the people interviewed were interesting and seemed well-informed, and it was a fun viewing.  I'll be watching it again, and probably inviting others over to do so as well.  I only wish there would have been more footage from other festivals so I could have gotten a better feel for them.",1273881600,8,1563,4.480565371024735
