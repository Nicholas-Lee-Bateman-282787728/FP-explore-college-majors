8192170,1,B000PKG90A,"This shot-on-video (VHS?) ""documentary"" focuses on various aspects of fetishism, from transvestitism to rubber wear.  The cheap production values only serve to cheapen the material.  It's all rather tawdry and silly, especially when the program's ""host"", Joe Djavadi shows up dressed in a frock, knickers, and suspenders.

Also note that the production of the DVD is subpar as well.  The nicest thing about it is the cover image.  The rest looks like it was put together on someone's home PC without previous knowledge of DVD-authoring software.",1226707200,2,545,5.290697674418604
