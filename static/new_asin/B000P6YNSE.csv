Also, the sub-titles pop up.  The sub-titles show on every episode except the first one on each disc.  I continually have to go to the menu to attempt to turn off the sub-titles.  The problem is sometimes they continue to pop up, even after they've been turned off.  If you have the same issue that I've had, please report it to Amazon so that they know and can do something regarding these issues.  Good luck.",1494720000,,562,4.450980392156863

2813811,3,B000P6YNSE,"I kinda wish I could give this both a Zero stars and 4 stars.
This show ran from 2004 to 2010, and this downward trend continues with the networks. : (
Hostile - violent - Insane!! - People treating themselves Horribly - I hate to even call this entertaining.
I know we're supposed to 'suspend some sense of belief' - but one moment charactors kill someone in a moment of stupidity -
then the next people forgive them - hug - and offer them like an 8th chance to be nice.
I have seasons 1 - 3 and so far - I'm Refusing to buy the other 3.
I'm disappointed in television for offering terrible plots and upsetting themes - society for condoning this -
and mad at myself for getting 'sucked into the jet engine of' Lost.
They should have reserved a season 7 = and KILL that jerk 'Ben' a different way each time. - One death alone - is Not enough for that bastard!!

I am half way through watching season 3 and am convinced that the people on this island are not lost, however the people watching this series probably are.  Every hour you watch brings in something new like a polar bear on a tropical island, a black cloud that kills, a black horse that appears and disappears and a village of people who lives in houses that has electricity.  What more could you want in a series.  I forgot the flashbacks which shows everyone on the island is carrying a whole lot of extra baggage.  I am convinced that if I had been on that airplane and survived with those people, within one week I would have packed up everything I could and moved to another part of that island just so I could have some peace and quiet.",1468713600,,813,4.294117647058823

That's one of the reasons I adore Amazon--almost every show I have ever loved is available on this website. But anyway, that's besides the point.

They skip, freeze, pixellate, even eject themselves as ""not able to play disc"".

The bonus features disk is really good too. Very informative. Everything up to Season 3 (so far) is perfect, more than we hoped. However, there is a manufacturing defect in the set for Season 3. Disk 5 which is supposed to contain the season finale (episodes 21-23) instead is just a copy of Disk 1 (episodes 1-5). The disk is labeled 5 but its contents are from disk 1. This is a real bummer since now we can't watch the exciting season 3 finale! Contacted Amazon about it and I'll post what they will do to get us the correct disk.

OK, I would not have minded a few involving more recent characters, but they went WAY beyond that. Apparently, most people didn't mind/enjoyed it or surely they would have stopped.

So for Lost fans it is a no brainier that obtaining the six individual seasons via Amazon ( or in my case Amazon Prime Instant video)

 My review is more aimed at the more uninitiated who may be a bit more apprehensive to sign up to watch the Shows total story over the 6 seasons. I do that because I recall it being one of my reasons for not watching live- the story arc was three years going and reviews of episodes were pretty daunting to comprehend. Characters were time shifting and a smoke monster was haunting and 'The Others' were all over the place- honestly it sounded pretty much like a hot mess of an overall story.

 The characters are the driving source here. The background developments and the advancing storylines sure helped pull me through this adventure. So even though you maybe picking up LOST in season 3 without the benefit of having seen prior seasons- this characters are dynamic enough to keep you entertained and enthralled throughout the season.",1388361600,,1133,4.512195121951219

2813978,5,B000P6YNSE,"This review is for the whole series not just season three.  Granted the third season started out somewhat slowly, the main characters locked in cages, but the writers soon found their mark and the season ended strongly setting up the remainder of series perfectly.

Simply put LOST is awesome, the actors were perfectly cast and superb, the character development is some of the most detailed and involved of any television show.  This show has everything action, drama, interpersonal conflicts, love triangles, and science fiction and fantasy elements.  LOST is one of the few shows that if you take its core message to heart it will help you be a better person.  And the final episode was perfect don't listen to the haters, if you watch from the beginning to end you will see that most of the major ""mysteries"" were answered, those who say other wise are either just causal fans or not very deep thinkers.",1387324800,,907,4.788461538461538

2813988,5,B000P6YNSE,"Season three has its ups and downs. There are a few 'filler' episodes and characters (Nikki and Paulo, for example), but there's a lot of really good episodes, too. And whatever shortcomings the season might have are made up for by the great (if bittersweet) finale.",1385683200,,266,4.804347826086956

2813993,5,B000P6YNSE,Loving every season. Plot twists and turns each episode. We end up watching 3-4 episodes a sitting bc we want to know what happens next!,1384300800,,136,4.48
2813994,5,B000P6YNSE,"Where season 2 was all about the hatch, this season was all about the others and learning some of their back story.  Because this is still Lost, we do not learn everything through the course of the season, but we do get an understanding of who they are, and how they ended up there.

Season 3 picks up where the season 2 cliffhanger left off.  Kate, Jack and Sawyer were taken and held prisoner.  So the first half the the season is essentially telling three or four parallel stories.  Those of the people still on the beach.  Fleshing out the others' story and following Kate Sawyer and Jack.  Most, but not all, of the character development in this season revolves around who the ""main"" Others were, and how they came to be there.  Although we do learn some other things along the way like how Locke was paralyzed, a familial relation that is revealed only to the viewers along with a lot more of the Jin/Sun relationship.

Like in past years the characters do not get through the season unscathed, and the season ends not only on a cliff hanger, but with the first flash forward of the series.  It definitely ends the season on a high note, with again some questions answered, but many others left open.  We also get cameos from a few characters that were killed off in prior seasons.

As for the blu ray set for those who get the discs.  The series looks and sounds great again.  The season play mode is not as seamless is it was for the first two seasons, but it does work essentially the same way and you do not have to create a profile.  There are a lot of extras for those who like to go through them.  There is a good 2hrs plus worth of bonus material from behind the scenes features, deleted scenes, a gag reel and commentaries.

Lost is definitely not a show that is for the impatient or people who cannot accept weird twists.  You have to be able to suspend your disbelief and realize that you will not learn everything at once.  I is probably an easier series to watch on disc than it was when it aired because you do not get all the time between episodes and you can follow all the plot points better.  If you like fantasy, action, drama, and/or mystery this is definitely a show worth checking out because it blends them all together very well.",1384041600,,2259,4.371702637889689
2813995,5,B000P6YNSE,"This season is as good or better than the previous two.  Shucks, it might be the best one so far.",1383091200,,97,3.85
2813996,5,B000P6YNSE,"I was one of the very few people in the country that NEVER saw even 1 episode of LOST when it was on Prime-time.  I would see the advertisements and nothing on those ads appealed to me.  Well one day I was on Amazon Prime searching for something to  watch and as I scrolled past the icon for Lost I saw JJ Abrams name and since I have loved most everything he's been involved with I thought I should maybe check out Lost.  I thought what the heck, I'll spend a few minutes looking at the 1st episode, can't hurt and I can just turn it off if it's boring.  Well - less than 10 minutes into the 1st episode I was hooked and I watched the entire series and was very sad when I'd watched the last one because  there was no more.  BUT I am very glad I never got hooked on it when it was on TV because I would have hated having to wait each week to view the next episode and the summer breaks would of been awful.  So if you are like I was and never saw the show and you love story lines with twist and turns you'll like this.",1383004800,,1020,3.893719806763285

2813998,4,B000P6YNSE,"Great series, but I liked season 3 less than 2 and 4. It's obvious that they decided to start stretching the series out after season 2. Still a good season, but seems to meander a bit.",1382227200,,184,4.138888888888889

2814005,5,B000P6YNSE,We loved fringe and pretty much anything J.J.

2814018,5,B000P6YNSE,"This is the best season of the whole series in my opinion, though I'm not sure you could understand what's happening unless you've seen the first two seasons. If you only ever watch one episode of this show, watch ""Expose"" (episode 14 of season 3) - it is by far my favorite (Oh, the horror!).

The character development of this show is unprecedented. This show is about the characters, and how you never really know someone, really. Everyone has a little mystery about them, and everyone makes mistakes. Everyone has their own interests and is willing to sacrifice different amounts of things to accomplish their personal means.

This is a great, albeit addicting, show. It's very well done all throughout, though this is the most revealing, exciting, and mysterious season of all.

I highly recommend for fans of dramatic intrigue and horror.",1376611200,,844,4.929577464788732

as far as impacting me....well no, I don't think tv shows that are meant for pleasure should impact your life.
It has helped me kill some idle time, and some time that I shouldn't have been idle...lol

2814072,5,B000P6YNSE,"LOST season 3 introduced ""the Others"" to the viewers and the tension of keeping Jack, Kate, and Sawyer locked up was excellent and made us wonder why they were being locked up. Also, towards the end of this season, it literally started the beginning of the end, just like the 2-part season finale titled ""The Beginning of the End"". Although he had a heart and showed it by caring for Claire's baby, the annoying character, Charlie, commits suicide by locking himself in a room that fills with water in the Looking Glass station.
A lot of LOST fans disliked this season (possibly because Charlie left), but I totally disagree. This season went in-depth to the Island's ""Others"" and was reminiscent of J.J. Abrams masterful drama-action storytelling (i.e. with Jack, Kate, and Sawyer locked up in cages) previously seen in one of the other best TV shows, Alias, and the best Mission Impossible sequel, Mission Impossible 3.
If you're a true fan of LOST, watch season 3!",1366243200,,967,4.831325301204819

2814110,5,B000P6YNSE,"My family of five started watching LOST on DVD last Nov or Dec (2012) and only one of us had EVER seen Lost before. I never watched it EVER when it was on TV but my husband did (wasn't my husband then) and when we married in 2011 he BEGGED me to watch the LOST seasons with him but I didn't buy into all the hype back when it was on and didn't want to start now.

But I gave it more thought and I decided to go ahead and ""try"" and see if I could ""get through"" the first few episodes before telling him ""well I tried and it's just not that good"". Well, I was WRONG!!!! I could not believe how HOOKED my girls and I got from the very first episode and we still are! We cannot get enough of LOST. My 17 year old loves it and my 13 year old is absolutely obsessed with it!! She even started watching it from the very first episode ALL OVER AGAIN during times we aren't watching where we currently are at!! She's on Season 3 on her ""own time"" while we all watch it together.

We have watched Season 1-5 now with last night being the finale of season 5. We are VERY sad that season 6 is upon us already and will be very sad when we're all caught up and we're done. I bought season 3-6 on Amazon and I am SOOO glad I did!! I HOPE you will watch every single episode of LOST and give it a chance. We think it is the BEST show we have EVER seen!!

Heck, I even dream about it pretty much every night. The only thing I don't like is that there aren't enough episodes in season 5 and 6!!!! I cannot recommend LOST highly enough! There just isn't enough ""stars"" available to rate this show!!! You will fall in LOVE with the characters (we LOVE to list our favorite characters IN ORDER and discuss why and what's going on during each episode), LOVE the plot, LOVE the scenery, LOVE the humor!!! LOVE the whole CONCEPT of the show and LOVE LOVE LOVE being engrossed in it!!!!!

Note to writers--  piling on multiple layers of confusion into your screenplays is not storytelling.  Even the actors look bored reading your 500+ subplots and back-stories.

I started to watch the first episode of season 3 with hopes it would get better, but after ten minutes I was rooting for Jack to go on a hunger-strike and die on camera.",1355011200,,603,4.579439252336448

2814125,5,B000P6YNSE,"LOST's third season was the best. We shall provide but a few examples of its greatness in this review. Please note: The massive hiatus that followed season three (late 2007) produced absolutely hundreds of insane fan theories. These may be mentioned in this review.

The Greatness:
1. Ben Linus - formerly known as Henry Gale, we meet the leader of the Others this season. He's smart and manipulative, and doesn't take kindly to people leaving the Island.

2. Desmond - he is the wild card. When he's not busy with preventing the Island's destruction, he can see the future in the form of FLASHES.

3. Dharma Initiative - we get to see who they were and what they did. More stations are discovered and more Island territory is seen. Also, we get to see what happened to the DI.

4. The Showdown - the Losties have a chance at getting off the Island, but they'll have to face the Others to do it. The radio tower returns, as do the numbers: 4 8 15 16 23 42

The Theories:

1. The Island is Lost in Time
2. The Others are the decendents of the Island's original inhabitants
3. The plane crash was staged
4. The smoke monster is Vincent
5. Walt has the Shining
6. Ben Linus is a secret billionaire
7. Kate works for Widmore, who arranged the crash
8. Desmond Caused the crash (of 1929)
9. The numbers are biblically significant

Season 3 is the best of LOST!

The bonus features sometimes really go into depth and give you a perspective of how the show was made and it is quite interesting to see the bloopers, the deleted scenes, and interviews from Cast and Crew. There are hours of bonus features that really add to the set.

This show was probably the most detailed show in TV history as far as I am concerned. The amount of back story to make this show come together is mind boggling, and how the writers tied everything up together is truly a feat. You can tell how anyone who worked on this show from producers, cast, and crew took so much pride in making this a great show from beginning to end.

Now, in my opinion Lost is one of those once in a lifetime shows that will never come around again. Lost has a beginning and an ending, but to fully enjoy Lost you need to own and watch all of the seasons sequentially. They are all great seasons. While I do like some seasons better than others, I find them all an intricate piece of the overall puzzle that is Lost. In order my choices for seasons are:

Season 1
Season 2
Season 3
Season 5
Season 6
Season 4  I believe the writers strike really messed this season up.

*****Spoiler Alert *******

Lost is a story about a group of people who crash land on an island. They soon discover this is not just any island, there are ""Others"" living on the island. There are various life forms living there that should not be able to live there such as a smoke monster(explained in season six), a huge polar bear etc. The island has certain properties as well, such as women who become pregnant do not live to full term, there are also hatches on the island from a former group called ""The Dharma Initiative."" These inhabitants were killed off by ""The leader of The Others."" (Explained in season 3) When it becomes apparent that rescue is not coming to the survivors thing really start to heat up on the island. Eventually some of the survivors do manage to get off of the island (season 5) during which time the rest end up back in time (yes the island can move through time)and find a way to work in the Dharma Initiative. When those who had been off the island find a way back, all hell breaks loose. I won't tell you how it ends for a number of reasons, but I will say that I was very happy and disappointed in the ending. The ending had answered most of my questions satisfactorily only to leave me feeling a bit empty about the whole series.

*****End Spoiler Alert******
If you want to be hooked on a great series buy the whole series and enjoy. I personally could not watch each episode fast enough once I started. I found every excuse to watch show after show. I cannot remember the last time I had felt this way about a TV show. I only wish there had been more of Lost to watch.

It's been easier to keep track of the little things between the flashbacks and what is currently going on with the survivors and the others. This season is a really big deal for the series and sees some major changes and shifts.

There is also the introduction of flash forwards which means you really have to pay extra attention to what's going on. Of course, the season flows with the same suspense as the previous two. Of course, they still don't tell you what the smoke monster is.

Again, this show is like crack and of course Season 3 ends with you yelling at the TV to see season 4. Of course, if you waited like I did to see them on DVD, you can pop season 4 right in!",1282176000,,754,4.122448979591836

2814155,3,B000P6YNSE,"3.5 stars.  I never followed this series in broadcast and finally, with the final few episodes left to air, I finally broke down and started watching it on DVD. This show more than deserves its addictive yet similtaneously frustrating reputation. Featuring some of the best acting ever on television by a remarkable and constantly rotating ensemble cast, it also has its share of moments that inspire sheer incredulity. Frankly, if this were just a tale of castaways on a normal tropical island without the mystical/scientific overtones, I'd probably like it even better, since paranormal has never been my bag. But I hang on for the moments that are anchored in something resembling reality and our stellar cast does not disappoint. Hands down my favorite season to date, I have a feeling that the subsequent three seasons might find it hard to match this level. And I have settled on my favorite castaways out of our overstuffed cast: sexy conman/cowboy with an unexpected bookworm side, Sawyer (Josh Holloway, he of the roguish dimples) and tortured Cassandra, Desmond, (Henry Ian Cusick, yet another sexy Scottish export). The always excellent Michael Emerson as the diabolical (or is he?) Ben Linus has given the show a much-needed shot in the arm since his introduction last season and provides a counterpoint energy to our original castaways, some of whom have become rather tedious through familiarity.  We also get to meet beguiling Other, Juliet (Elizabeth Mitchell) who is playing both sides now--which side will finally come down on?  Particularly strong episodes this go-round are ""The Man From Tallahassee"", in which we find out how Locke came to be in that wheelchair; ""The Brig"", in which Sawyer comes face-to-face with his nemesis, the original ""Sawyer"", and discovers a bond with Locke that neither knew existed; and ""The Man Behind the Curtain"", which explores the origin and backstory of Ben Linus, and how he came to be the leader of the Others.  During the two-part finale, ""Through the Looking Glass"" we say goodbye permanently to one of our castaways and I'm equally sad to say goodbye to Season Three because I don't know how they are going to top it.  All indications are that they can't, and they don't succeed.  However, because this series is video crack and I can't stop watching, I have duly started Season Four.  Once you get ""Lost"" you have no choice but to keep going.  One thing's for sure: we ain't seen nothin' yet--it's only going to get weirder and weirder from here on out.",1273968000,2,2513,4.938388625592417

2814157,4,B000P6YNSE,"Season 3 of Lost is my least favorite season of the show so far, but that's not to say it is bad. It still has it moments of greatness. The first half of the season deals with our main castaways being held captive by the Others. Kate and Sawyer spend a lot of time together, and Jack meets an Other named Juliet. The complex relationships between the characters creates more tension than in previous seasons. If you care more about the characters and their relationships, this season might be for you. Fans of the science fiction aspects of Lost, who want the answers to their questions about the island and the DHARMA initiative, will have to wait until the second half of the season to get a taste of what they're looking for. My personal favorite episode is ""The Man From Tallahassee"", in which we learn about how Locke came to be in a wheelchair. The scenes between Michael Emerson (Ben) and Terry O'Quinn (Locke) are just fun to watch.

Just as the previous two seasons of Lost, Season 3 is a seven-disc set with plenty of bonus material. There are the usual Lost Flashbacks, which are never-before-seen segments into a character's past. The Lost on Location featurettes show various aspects of production of different episodes. The best feature in Season 3 is ""Lost in a Day"", where cameras take us into a time span of 24 hours, where seven episodes are in different stages - some being planned and written, others being filmed or edited.

In summary, Season 3 is perhaps the weakest season of Lost, but it's still quite good and it moves the series into a new realm by giving more insight into the history of the Others, the DHARMA Initiative, and the powers of the island.",1269475200,,1680,4.596666666666667

2814160,4,B000P6YNSE,"- THE GOOD

The Episodes:
Yet another great Season of Lost.  I'm glad the writers really like to take chances and this season is a great example of them really stretching themselves after an Amazing second season.  In this season the Sawyer-Kate-Jake love triangle is further complicated with the addition of a forth, Juliet; we find out who the Others are; yet another layer is added to the Kwon family's history; lock grows increasing mysterious, and the aftermath of the second season finale is felt by all, especially Desmond and Charlie.  Desmond, who was only briefly introduced in the second season, is further developed and becomes one of the truly interesting standout cast members of the Season.  Top it all off with a stunning Season Finale, and you've got yourself a great season of Lost

Quality of Product and Features:
I believe this was the first season of Lost to be transfered to Blu-Ray, so needless to say it really is beautiful.  The locations show off beautifully, the greens and blues really pop.  The blacks are nice and deep and the overall picture quality is excellent; you can just feel the stubble on Jack and Sawyers face.  The audio is good, not mind blowing, but gets the job done.  There are some feature commentaries on select episodes.  You get your usual on location features, extended scenes, and blooper reel.  Not a huge selling point for me, but its nice if you like that sort of thing.

- THE BAD

The Episodes:
I remember watching this season when it aired.  Unlike previous seasons there are some episodes that just feel like ""fluff"".  They seem like episodes that were put in since the writers were obligated to make 23 episodes. The episodes I'm mentioning are actually not that bad, they were just so painful to watch when they first aired since you were waiting all week to know what the HELL was going on after last week's killer episode only to be subjected to a fluff episode.  Watching the season again on Blu-Ray it really isn't so bad.  This season also gets criticism for starting off heavily ""others"" centric.  The momentum does change midway through the season and things swiftly return back to legendary television status by the later episodes.

Quality of Product and Features:
I do have a minor gripe that they did not keep the box set features and packaging consistent between all Seasons.  Seasons 1 and 2, which were released later on Blu-Ray, have a different box, more subtitle and language tracks, with a better Season Play interface.  Season 1 and 2 just don't look right sitting next to Season 3 on my DVD shelf.  If you're sort of a box display nut, you might want to wait for the complete series box set out in August.",1268265600,,2686,4.6923076923076925
2814161,5,B000P6YNSE,This season gives many questions but is still a good telling of an ongoing story.  Can't wait to pick up the fourth season.,1268179200,,123,4.3478260869565215
2814162,4,B000P6YNSE,"After the utter lostness of Season 2, watching the first 6 or 7 episodes, you'd think you have been caught in a time-warp where Season 2 never died. But don't worry folks, the brutal tediousness of the beginning of the season was not to keep this season down, and in fact, it's provided the show some of its best & most underrated moments in the history of the show. Sure, it may be small pieces in a big puzzle, but almost every minute of the 2nd half of this season is simply enthralling.

Highlight Episodes:
Flashes Before Your Eyes
The Man from Tallahassee
Expos
The Man Behind the Curtain
Through the Looking Glass

Season 3 is all about those mysterious Others, a group with the weirdest sense of motives, or lack thereof ever conceived on television. For the first 6 episodes, you got intimate knowledge of their polar bear cages, and the general complex of the zoological facility, which you would never really see again. But hey, you got a lot of tedious dialogue, a lot of Jack being stupid, Kate being the point in a love triangle/quadrangle. Make no mistake about it, if you did not watch these episodes back to back through the wonders of DVD, I feel sorry for you. It's hard enough dealing with this tediousness over a night, much less months.

But again, all is not Lost, because the producers saw the error in their Season 2-type ways, and sought to correct them. We got some Desmond flash-forwarding with one of the most emotional moments the serious produced up until that point. We got some AWESOME Locke dialogue and interactions with Ben Linus, including a lot of Ben Linus vs. John Locke.

And then of course, we have Nikki & Paulo. Oh, that infamous duo that was so eloquently summed up by Sawyer as, ""Who the hell are you?"" Sure, I wanted to slap them every moment they were breathing until they got an episode of their own, but once they did get a flashback episode, one could consider it one of the worst Lost episodes of all time, or one of its worst. There was strippers fighting crime, hilarious flashbacks that tried REALLY hard to show that this duo was there the WHOLE time (What? You didn't see them in the background doing nothing?), and really atrocious dialogue/acting. I mean, they even conceived an excuse for why Paulo was going to the bathroom in almost every previous scene we had seen him in before! But alas, these truly awful, annoying characters were literally buried alive, set to some of the most inappropriate clapping I've ever done. Oh, Nikki & Paulo, how will I ever get by without you? Just fine actually.

Heck, the producers actually made Charlie likable again, right before they killed him off. I mean, they tried so hard to make him a jerk last season, and here he is making the top 5 moments of his life, and heck, we actually like him again! What's worse is, we genuinely root for him! Oh, how easy we forget. Sure, Jack & Kate are basically the same as last season, continuing their characters' downward spiral. But hey, Sawyer is as hilarious as ever, Hurley is as lovable as ever, and hey, we finally did away with full-time flashbacks! Oh Lost, how far you came in such a short span of time.

Overall, watching this season is one of the most satisfying of the show, especially since you get such plentiful, awesome moments after sitting through so much tediousness at the beginning. Underrated, Season 3 will always have a special place in my heart, if only for the reason that it truly made what Lost became later.",1266796800,,3478,4.574638844301766
2814163,4,B000P6YNSE,"SPOILER ALERT: If you have not seen the first two seasons of Lost you may want to wait to read this review. This will either give things away, or confuse you as you watch the first two seasons.

Things start to really heat up on the island as Jack (Matthew Fox), Sawyer (Josh Holloway), and Kate (Evangeline Lilly) find themselves prisoners of ""The Others"", who might need more from them than they're letting on. As for the other survivors of Oceanic 815, Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and Locke (Terry O' Quinn) find another hatch which may prove that pushing a button every 108 minutes in the first hatch is futile. Could ""The Others"" be their chance to get off the island? Why hasn't anyone come to save the survivors of Oceanic 815? Where did ""The Others"" come from? What will happen if they don't push that button? What is the purpose of the Dharma Initiative? Some of these questions will be answered, and so many more will be asked by the end of the third season!

The first two seasons of Lost don't even begin to prepare you for what comes next, which is fine by me! One of the great things about Lost is it's compelling storyline that always keeps you guessing, and as time goes by I, all at once, feel that I wish I would have seen this when it first aired on TV and that I'm glad I waited. Watching all of this at once means that I don't have to wait after an episode to see what's going to happen next, but at the same time I can't really talk to anyone who's already seen the series about what happened in the episode I watched last night because they're already way beyond that. But here I am, a little closer to getting caught up with the series.

After season 2 which really felt more like a place holder between seasons 1 and 3, season 3 really gets the ball rolling on what the show's really about. Unlike the previous 2 seasons, season 3 might introduce you to new characters, but because those characters are meant to be shrouded in secrecy it doesn't do much to really introduce them. This lack of introduction allows the story to propel forward faster than the previous two seasons. Not only do you get flashbacks in season 3, but now you have flash forwards as well. The way that everything's set up is brilliant storytelling, even if it doesn't give you the satisfaction of a quick and easy payoff.

More new characters are added to the roster this season, most of which aren't really explained too much as they serve the purpose of fleshing out characters in flashbacks and flash forwards, or to further the story of ""The Others"". Of these new characters Elizabeth Mitchell (V, Gia) as Juliet is the most important. Of course, there's always the stand outs in the crowd, and Terry O' Quinn continues to shine as John Locke, but in his first full season Michael Emerson as the oily Benjamin Linus upstages everyone. As a master manipulator bending everyone to his needs, Michael Emerson is the true star of this season.

As with season 2 there is a slight problem of some characters doing things that seem to be more about moving the story along rather than being in the best interest of what the characters would or wouldn't do. While not as bad as the second season in this aspect, it can still be distracting as you move along through the series. Of course, this isn't a major problem, as the twists and turns of the plot may leave you more distracted than the character's acting against type at times, and those twists and turns keep your further invested in the story.

In my opinion, season 3 is really where Lost kicks off. The first two seasons get you into the characters, but the third season starts to answer some of the questions and pushes you into the direction of where everything is heading. Of course, by the end you'll probably be asking more questions than what you had answered, but the intrigue will leave you hungry for more.

With Jack, Sawyer, and Kate (the Lost love-triangle) all in cages held by the Others at the beginning of the season, the series makes a bit of a tedious beginning.  But as usual, things pick up and Season Three does not disappoint.

One of the weird things about Lost (there are many) is that there are 40+ survivors, but we really only get to know a handful.  Once in a while some of the outliers show up in some scene or other, and when one lovely woman outlier says something disagreeable to Sawyer, he pretty much speaks for us all with the line: ""who the hell are you?""  My thoughts exactly, and we never do find out.  Hilarious.

One thing about this series: it is not afraid to kill off major characters.  Season Three is noteworthy in this regards.  No spoilers here.

I liked Season Three just fine.  The Dharma Initiative continues to creep everyone out, the smoke monster is as mysterious as ever.  Elizabeth Mitchell makes her debut in this season as Juliet Burke, and she is as lovely as ever.  Mitchell is a charismatic actress, beautiful, well-spoken, with a presence that causes her to dominate every scene she is in.  Since she is a doctor, will she interrupt Jack's interest in Kate?  Inquiring minds want to know.  Again, no spoilers here.

Another great season.  Highly recommended.  RJB.",1262390400,,1412,4.598393574297189

2814170,5,B000P6YNSE,"This is my favorite season of LOST. It never seems to get boring it's constantly moving and changing. First they're captured then they're freed with a twist involved. The first six episodes are a mini season ending with a cliffhanger that left you stew for three months breathless. This season had a lot of great twists and turns with the Hatch, Nikki and Paulo, Charlie finding his fate, and Desmond teleporting through time. Then the finale hit and by the way the finale is my favorite episode of the series. It left you breathless and keep you wondering and obsessing over the long hiatus just what that last scene meant and what it would lead to. In a way the series had no where to go but down.
 The series in my mind has gone down after this season. The fourth season was still pretty good, but the fifth season was a mistake. They did however rectify it in the season 5 finale and it looks like season 6 the final season may rival this season for the best of the series. Anyway the third season is a must watch as you learn more about the others, the island, the man behind the curtain, and most importantly you delve deeper and with finer focus the lives and pasts of the survivors. This season like the previous two had a much different feel. It introduced so much information that is still prevalent in the final season. This season is the greatest 23 hours of television you will ever watch. The Blu Ray is crisp and clear and brings you closer to the island then you ever thought possible. If you're on the fence on whether you should buy this on Blu Ray or DVD do yourself a favor and pay the extra money the video quality and extra special features are well worth it.

2814173,5,B000P6YNSE,"The tag line for this review references the title of the finale of Season 3, a jaw dropping, mind bending, shocker that pointed the series in a new direction and laid the groundwork for the endgame that would begin to unfold in Season 4.  Yes, it is an extremely pivotal episode for this groundbreaking show, yet it seems that it is the only thing that people remember from what was an otherwise excellent third season.  Critics and fans alike grew extremely frustrated with this installment of the series, only to jump back on board the Lost bandwagon at the season's end.  That's unfortunate since Season 3 is the most underrated of the show's run and quite possibly the best.

The season opens where season 2 left off.  Jack, Kate and Sawyer are being held captive by the others while Syaid, Sun and Jin try to rescue them.  Much of the first half of the season focuses on this plotline and gives us a closer look at the inner circle of the others.  We learn more about Ben and his true motives.  We are also introduced to a new character, Juliet, a member of the others who may or may not be loyal to them.  Viewers are also introduced to Alex, the daughter Russo has been searching in vain for.

The first half of the season focuses largely on Jack, Kate and Sawyer and their capture by the others.  I suspect that fans felt aggrivated by this since it took the focus off of the remainder of the survivors.  But it allowed the show to deepen its mysteries even further, to develop its three main characters more fully and to allow the audience to start to get an understanding of who the others are and what they are doing.

The season's second half reunites the three with their island mates but continues to muddy the waters with the introduction of Richard, a member of the others whose role is unclear and who seems to never age.  We get some backstory regarding Ben's childhood where we finally see the Dharma Initiative in action as well as finding out what happened to them.  The mysterious Jacob, the never seen but revered leader of the others, is introduced into the plot as well.  Meanwhile, Desmond becomes a cast regular and gets an episode that shows what happened to him after the hatch exploded.  This episode not only deals with the ongoing theme of fate, but it also hints at the time travel element that will come to the forefront of the series down the road.  Elsewhere, Mr. Echo's time on the island comes to and end and Charlie learns what fate has in store for him.

There's a lot to mull over in Season 3.  I haven't even mentioned the continuing identity struggle of Locke who eventually ends up joining the ranks of the others, or the sereis of events that brings Sawyer face to face with the man who was responsible for his parents' deaths.  Quite often, it can feel like the show is spinning its wheels; providing more questions than answers.  But be patient.  Season 3 is a dark, mystery filled journey that is extremely crucial to the show's story arc.  Even before arriving at the finale that changes everything, this season had already proven to anyone who had been paying attention, that Lost was about more than just survivors stranded on an island.  Something much bigger was happening to the surivors of Oceanic 815 and Season 3 is a major step towards figuring out exactly what that is.",1251763200,2,3328,4.534338358458961

2814183,4,B000P6YNSE,"Season three more or less completes a cycle, as island life is changed forever with the set of events that unfold.  Overall, it was a pretty good season.  Certainly plenty of action leading to a fitting season finale in which the viewer discovers the last of the old Dharma stations as Des and Charlie try to open up a line of communication to the outside world.  But, it is the bumpy and confused set of episodes one has come to expect from this series.

The viewer learns quite a bit about the Others to whet his appetite.  New characters emerge while others meet their fate on the island.  Locke becomes obsessed in the meaning of the island which takes many twists and turns, leaving Jack in a quandry as to what Locke is really after.

The writers struggle to hold all these competing storylines together.  It would seem there are just too many characters with a lot of moving back and forth between the various camps that have emerged.  Much of the mystery is gone, leaving one to wonder what if any metaphysical aspect to this series remains.  But, the writers still want you to believe something deeper lurks at the heart of the island so they pull out Ol' Smokie a few more times and provide some other interesting clues to the island.

If you've been sucked into this series, you can't stop now, but in many ways Season Three represented the peak of the series.",1243036800,2,1371,4.510121457489879

Our losties were taken by the 'Others' and that's where the storyline started to get a little old. It was like ok what's the deal here? where are they? who are these people? but after about 8 episodes the season started to open up and get very very interesting.

2814196,5,B000P6YNSE,"Season three of Lost sees the series travel far from its roots as a show about a small group stranded on an island after a horrific catastrophe. The thing is, the plots in this, ""the captivity season,"" are so fast-paced and enthrallingly good, it's not only forgivable, it's a great ride! Answering the season two cliffhanger's burning question of what the heck happens now, the third season takes off like a rocket with Jack, Sawyer and Claire captives of the sinister ""Others"" whose brief onscreen moments in seasons one and two never hinted at the extent to which this society is entrenched on the island, or how advanced the Others are. Season three travels in many directions and for once answers more questions than it raises: a rarity in Lost. It is also possibly the most tragic season, with the loss of one particular cast member somehow hitting harder than any of the many deaths in the show to date. The introduction of Juliet Burke, the quiet, unflinchingly pragmatic fertility doctor and oft-dubbed ""scariest person ever on Lost"" was probably the highlight of the season, though the fault lines developing among the loyalties of the original Oceanic survivors brought out a soap operatic quality that was one more reason to tune in. Among the special features, the most winsome is probably Evangeline Lilly's behind the scenes moments with the numerous vital but seldom seen crewmembers whose labor brings Lost to the screen.

Which I think was little dull in the middle, still great season though.  Coming back the third season, alot of things have been revealed to us and more questions arise...not surprisingly.

One of the things LOST introduced me to was the Twilight Zone which J.J. Abrams was inspired. Besides this box set of season 3 of lost, I recommend a book also on Amazon.com. THE TWILIGHT ZONE: Unlocking the Door to a Television Classic by Martin Grams. Together, they both open the skies for cult television.

2814204,2,B000P6YNSE,"SPOILER ALERT.  I seem to be one of few people who thought that Lost Season 2 was the strongest yet.  Season 2 is everything that Season 3 isn't:  Carefully plotted, secrets revealed at the right times and with the right amount of impact, storyline well paced, and a sense of confidence in where the story was headed.  By the end of Season 2, I was intrigued.

That all ended in the first minutes of Season 3, where we discover instantly that the Island isn't really removed from the rest of civilization the way we thought, and all the mystery and menace of ""the Others"" simply evaporates.  By Episode 3 I found myself simply not caring about any of the characters or their schizophrenic decision-making.  This persisted throughout the remainder of the season with the exception of a tense standoff over Ben's spinal surgery.  In general, major events become laughable, the dialogue devolves into something bordering cheap and hoaky, tense situations are poorly constructed, and characters begin making decisions not because they make sense, but because they conveniently advance the plot.

An excessive amount of time is dedicated to flashbacks, many of them utterly pointless.  The insertion of the back-story on Nikki and Paulo is particularly irrelevant.  If I wanted to watch a show about a B-Movie actress, a con heist gone awry, or a love affair on the Sydney riviera, I wouldn't turn to Lost for my fix.  Intense stand-offs between key characters in pivotal moments are sloppy and often make no sense considering the circumstances.  The key players stop behaving in ways we would expect them to based on our previous understanding of their characters, and it isn't intentional.  The use of coincidence gets more extreme than ever, to the point of inducing eye-rolling rather than surprise or fascination.

A sense that there's a good explanation for all the coincidence rapidly diminishes as Season 3 progresses.  More and more characters seem to be becoming omniscient, somehow knowing things that nobody in their right mind could ever hope to piece together, and not just because the island or some unseen force told them.  Speaking of mysticism, the writers have become utterly reliant on superstition - and what appears to be telepathy - in order to get characters to learn and communicate efficiently with one another.  There's a flashback of Desmond's where even one of the ancillary characters not familiar with the Island seems to know all its secrets and everything about everyone.

Hurley gets inordinate screen time, which would be fine if his character weren't such a crashing bore.  Most of the new female characters have had so much cosmetic surgery that they don't fit in with the rugged environment of the Island.  Juliet is simply hard to look at, her face deconstructed and pieced back together with silicone, collagen and sculpted bone fragments, and ditto for Desmond's wife.  It's all well and fine for soap operas; wrong for a show like Lost.  Charley's death came at a disappointment particularly since none of the new characters are interesting enough to replace him.  Most of the new additions are dry, bland, cookie-cutter types that you might expect to see on a show like 7th Heaven or a filler courtroom drama.

There is almost no real ""Island time"" to speak of.  Most of the events take place in the built-up parts of the Island, complete with swingsets, electricity, pianos, flower pattern curtains and hospital beds.  Scenes with the original survivors of flight 815 at their original beach camp seem out of place given that you apparently can't walk very far in any direction without stumbling upon a house, farm, quay or bunker.  The sense of adventure is completely drained from the show by the time Season 3 concludes.

Now that I think about it, Season 3 was so bad I might not even watch Season 4.  And considering what a promising start the first two seasons were, that's quite a feat.  The promise of ""Lost"" is escapism, but Season 3 brings us right back to the real world of dry primetime television.",1225929600,8,4049,4.910294117647059

2814215,5,B000P6YNSE,"While Season 2 was not very good in my opnion, season 3 of Lost has regained mometum and it is actually even better than the first season. While as usual the flashbacks are unnerving at times and do not really contribute much to the storyline, after a while one gets used to them. It is interesting to see how the lives of the people were connected even before the crash . As usual the season will end in a quite unexpected cliffhanger with some new questions raised. We see life with the Others and while we do not really get to know who they are, there are some interesting touches here. The real hero of the series is Hurley really.",1217203200,,635,4.3

The colors are very vibrant, and the environment is lush and alive. The sound is top notch also you feel as though you are on the island with them.

As far as the season itself goes, I really enjoyed it. Lost is a very mysterious show and this season raises more questions, although it does answer a few questions viewers were waiting for. It has a very awesome ending too.

In conclusion, if you love Lost and have a blu-ray player, please get this it's worth the extra money. You won't be disappointed.",1216512000,,678,4.459677419354839

Every night it's on, I'm there in front of the TV and the next morning I'm discussing it with a friend.  LOST is the most original show out there.  By far.

2814224,4,B000P6YNSE,"What makes a show like ""Alias"" or ""Lost"" strange is that they're entirely built on mysteries and double crosses, questions and answers and finding out what they all mean is the fun. Sure we can knock the show for drawing out its answers a bit too long and revisiting might lose that mystery because we now know what it all means, it's always great to get immersed into a show that doesn't involve a crime being solved in an hour. But even the great shows stumble and season 3 is one season where there's enough promise and greatness to outweigh the flaws but just too bad the flaws are just so visible.

Season 3 opens with Jack, Kate and Sawyer held hostage by the Others; Sayid, Sun and Jin are on a sailboat attempting to rescue them while Locke and Desmond deal with the fallout of the electromagnetic explosion that happened at the hatch. But naturally there's plenty to branch off from as answers (some) are revealed, new ones are introduced and some characters won't survive till the end.

I tried to be as broad and general as I can since the fun of a show like this is getting caught up in it and not really worrying that you've watched a good number of episodes in one go. And watching it on DVD or Blu-ray helps the flow of the season well since disappointment isn't as easy to get when you don't have to wait a week or deal with frequent commercial interruptions. A lot happens in this season, some of it surprising and some...strange but the show creators don't so much stumble as they occasionally drop the ball then bounce back.

The first ball drop is the opening set of episodes before a long break which dealt rather heavily on Jack, Kate and Sawyer's time in captivity with the Others. While it introduces their society and some motivations and a new main character, it feels strangely sluggish and the show just kind of limps along for awhile. Then there's the new characters Nikki and Paulo which deserve their dislike from fans since it seemed like a good idea to try rather than something vitally integral to the show. But then the show gets into the swing of things and twists add plenty of fuel for the mythology and the 2 part finale is quite the whopper for changing the show around. But as you can probably guess, some of the answers seem slightly frustrating as if the show's winking at us in a ""this is all you're getting"" way. One of the mysteries surrounding the Others was their kidnapping of several flight survivors and the reveal or shall we say, the tease, of what happens to them is just silly.

There's a lot of episodes that are great here to exceptional to just merely serviceable. Ones like ""Man Behind the Curtain"" (complete with creepy late night cabin visit), ""Man From Tallahassee"" and the 2 part ""Through the Looking Glass"" are season highlights and it's worth checking out the season if you're a Lost fan. Just be prepared for some...iffy parts along the way.",1212537600,,2907,4.531428571428571
2814225,5,B000P6YNSE,I recently purchased this product from Amazon. The quality of the DVDs and the free shipping made this an excellent addition to my Lost season collection. I would certainly order through Amazon again.,1211846400,,200,5.090909090909091

2814227,5,B000P6YNSE,Lost keeps getting better and better. Everything you know gets thrown out the window when flashback are not what they seem because you now have Flash Forwards. Filled with great bonus features this is a most have for any TV fanatic.,1210896000,,232,4.682926829268292
2814228,5,B000P6YNSE,"The common consensus with fans seems to be that the third season of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost/dp/B0017HZZP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost</a>&nbsp;is the weakest.  I have to, respectfully, disagree.

The genius writers and assorted crew behind ""Lost"" kept it fresh in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/second-season/dp/B000FIMG68/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">second season</a>&nbsp;by focusing most of the action around the mysterious hatch.  In the case of this season (the third), the main plot focuses on the conflict between the Oceanic survivors and the Others.  Finally, after two entire seasons shrouded in mystery, some of the big questions start to get answers.

+ We learn how Ben came to be the leader of the Others
+ We learn what happened to the Dharma Initiative
+ We get a 'sort of' origin story for the Others
+ We learn how Locke ended up in a wheelchair.

But that's not it.  This season has a tighter narrative than any of those previous.  While the flashbacks sometimes felt a bit contrived (especially the ""how Jack got his tattoo"" story), the main plots of each of these episodes tied very nicely in to each other, creating a very focused story-arc for this season.  Jack, Sawyer, Kate, Charlie, and Desmond get some great character development, while characters that seemed to be static (such as Hurley) start to play larger parts.  As with any show, there were story lines that I wasn't sure about (such as Locke becoming increasingly morally ambiguous), but the fact that I was constantly shocked and enthralled by this show is just a testament to how well-done it is.

Though the story is so continuous in ""Lost"" (particularly this season), it's hard to pick out the episodes that really stand out, but there are a few I thought really solidified this series as one of the best I've ever seen.  These are those episodes.

5. The Cost of Living: Tugs on your heartstrings, and opens up new questions.
4. Flashes Before Your Eyes: I was confused at the decision to make Desmond a permanent character, but this episode made him one of my favorites.  Tragic, revealing, and the essence of ""Lost.""
3. Tricia Tanaka Is Dead: Nearly perfect. This episode solidifies Hurley as a great character, and shows the characters having fun, which is great to see in the middle of so much drama.
2. Greatest Hits: As a penultimate episode, it is a perfect example of how to build up tension for an explosive finale.  Also, it has the greatest usage of flashbacks (recounting the best moments of Charlie's life) in the series, until...
1. Through the Looking Glass: This two-part finale is a roller coaster ride that will keep you tense up (with tears in your eyes, because not everyone makes it out alive) until the shocking end.

This show is brilliant.  Simple as that.  At this point, I trust the ""Lost"" team with any path they want to take us down, because this season and the two previous ones are proof that the yarn they spin is golden.

The only drawback is that like many Blu-Ray DVDs, it is painfully slow to start up. And to make matters worse, LOST is one of those poorly-designed DVDs which will not start up at the same spot after it shuts down.

Say that you put it on Pause and go to answer the phone. After a couple of minutes, the DVD player shuts down and you have to go through the painfully slow start-up again and scroll around to find where you paused. There is no excuse for producing a DVD this way, as far as I know. Other DVDs will restart from where they were stopped/paused, and some even have their own system for marking where they were stopped.

The solution I use is to Pause, but then start it in slow-motion at 1/8 speed. This keeps it from cutting off, then when I get back, I can easily rewind to where I was.

2814255,5,B000P6YNSE,"After watching the first two seasons of Lost last year on DVD, I was hooked and could not wait to pick up the third when it came out. Since the Blu-Ray was on sale for just $39.99 in a Gold Box special here on Amazon, I had to get it. I watched it over 3 straight days, and it was absolutely fantastic.

The picture was stunning and really shows off the Blu-Ray format quite well.  The colors of the forest just really popped out, and the facial details in close-ups were amazing. The sound was also great, producing the eerie noises of the jungle along with the explosions of the more action-packed scenes.

Some thought this season started a little show, but I think that was mostly due to the fact that they watched it in its serial format, making it seem like a long time before any real ""action"" occurred. However, watching it on Blu-Ray is like watching an epic 17 hour film, and it is quite the ride.

One feature that I really appreciated, especially since I was watching the episodes one after the other in those 3 days was the ""Season Play"" feature, which allowed you to do two things: 1. You could turn off the player, and the next time you started ""Season Play"" again, it would begin from the same point and 2. when you had finished watching the episodes on one disc, it would prompt you to eject the disc and put in the next one, and it would then continue playing the episodes of the disc without the usual maker logos, FBI warnings, and the menu.

2814264,5,B000P6YNSE,"My hat is off to J.J. Abrams, Damon Lindelof, Carlton Cuse and their merry band of castaways. ""Lost"" may frustrate and even infuriate its fans for episodes on end, but the show's makers always manage to keep viewers enthralled over the long haul, winding them in ever stronger, ever stickier webs of plot, character revelation, and ominous portent. (For the record, I avoid the show during its regular broadcast season and catch up with it in one gulp on DVD, thus avoiding a good part of the frustration.) Season 3 continues the high standards of the first two seasons, presenting us with further details about the Others, the fate of the Dharma Initative, several intriguing new characters and shocking developments among the old characters that, no matter how closely you follow the show, are guaranteed to knock you for a loop. If you want to know how Locke ended up in a wheelchair, discover how Ben maintains his nefarious hold over the Others, or see a couple of the longtime characters (I won't say which ones) in the very first flashforward of life after the island, Season 3 will provide that, and more. It's still a marvel how Abrams, Cuse, Lindelof & Co. can lead us down ever more bizarre plot pathways, creating an almost Elizabethan body count along the way, and still keep a sense of total continuity. My favorite episode of Season 3 came almost exactly in its middle: the self-contained tale of minor characters Nikki and Paulo, giving us their backstory and their highly ironic ultimate fate. Alfred Hitchcock would have approved, and possibly Geoffrey Chaucer as well! Disc 7 of the set presents the expected deleted scenes and bloopers, as well as a fascinating tribute to ""Lost's"" crew, that dedicated group of obsessed techies who burnish the show to a pristine and mesmerizing glow.",1203811200,,1805,4.863636363636363
2814265,5,B000P6YNSE,"Lost is part `ER', part `Star Trek', part `Twin Peaks', part `Gilligan's Island', a whole big bit of `Survivor' and yet remains totally unique in every conceivable way. Lost is something to look forward to. It really has become a part of our lives.

In many ways the best way to enjoy Lost is to avoid learning anything about it and just watch it with others who know nothing about it and guess what is going on. For this reason just buy it and prepare to watch a whole season in the span of a few days and then sulk in disappointed over how you have to wait another year to watch the next season, skipping TV, because you know watching a season with every episode back to back is the best way to experience the best that television has to offer.

The logistics are simple. A plane travelling from Sydney to LA has veered 1000km off course and smashed into an island strewing the passengers everywhere who soon learn from a co-pilot that their rescuers are looking for them in the wrong place. When the co-pilot is hurled into the air and eaten alive by an invisible beast who stalks the island the audience comes to realize that the island is no ordinary island, and so do the survivors who set about establishing themselves and facing various challenges that befall them.

Why are `the others' on the island? Who will Kate fall for? Who is Ben really? How did `the others' get there? What is the `Dharma initiative'? Are there psychics? What strange connection does Locke have with the island? Are there ghosts? Is this all an experiment? These are the kind of questions that can come up in a single episode of Lost... however the catch is that you have to wait quite awhile for anything to get answered and the good news is that Lost Season 3, does answer a lot of questions... but opens up a whole lot more.

Season 1 was about the island. Season 2 is about the hatch. Season 3 is about `the others'.

Season 3 is essentially finished with the hatch, but there are a lot more hatches with different things going on. The island expands with more interesting places to visit. It is becoming a bit of a treasure hunt.

In the first season we sat through quite a number of background stories for the series character build-ups, that are quite well driven, although extremely odd at times. These character build-ups are still occurring, so they are certainly a mainstream part of the show, and `the others' get their own back stories now too.

The producers are still working on the death clock element and they do kill off major characters. Main characters will die in Season 3. Who do you side with and why? Who do you hope makes it and who do you secretly hope doesn't? Will Dr. Jack side with `the others'? Will Sawyer kill again? Is Charlie going to die? Michael doesn't show up for Season 3, but for a split scene we do see Walt and even Boon.

The seven degrees of separation are now quickly becoming one degree. We are learning that the characters have more in common then we previously could have imagined. There is a huge twist in a back story in the last episode that will leave your jaw on the stick popcorn floor. The writers of this show are simply layering on the drama to near melting point.

The ethnic variations of actors and actresses gives Lost a worldwide appeal, and deservingly so, as who can say that they don't enjoy the suspense and mystery it has to offer.",1203724800,3,3383,4.461165048543689

2814267,5,B000P6YNSE,"I love this series. And what a great plot! A passenger jet crashes on an island in the middle of the Pacific. There are survivors. They must all learn to live together to survive. They are not alone on the island. Some mysterious forces loom all around them. Some miracles happen: a paralyzed person suddenly walks (John Locke). Desmond gains the ability to see the future. Rose had cancer and now is in remission. Jin was sterile and now is not. The sperm count of the men on the island is way above normal. There are others; other humans are on the island. Some have crashed on the island; some have come on their own free will. What is the significance of the numbers? What is going on? What is going on?

Indeed, what is going on? We are told towards the end of this season that the outside world has stopped searching for them, presuming them all dead. In fact, their airplane was found off the coast of Indonesia undersea. So are they dead? Are they spirits? Does the world know of the existence of the island? Who are the others?

Season 3 finally tells us who the Others are, but there are still many unanswered questions.

The following is a spoiler so stop reading if you have not seen the show yet: Season 3 ends with them being rescued, but with Jack wanting to return to the island. He flies every week across the Pacific hoping his jet will crash, and return him to the island. Why? We'll have to wait for Season 4. The writers actually took a big risk with such an ending. Season four will either live up to our expectations, or will not. Apparently, it was announced that there are three more Seasons, so the show will end with Season six.

I truly liked the character of Juliet, and I think her and Jack make a perfect match. I just hope the writers don't kill her off like they do with all new characters they introduce. For example, the survivors of the tail section were all killed-off except one. Nikki and Paulo were also killed-off. In fact, having them buried alive was quite eerie.

Why do the writers kill-off characters? Is it to make the story more realistic and captivating? This is not necessary the case. In this Season Mr. Eko was killed reportedly because he was hated by all his fellow cast members and he hated them all in return. Nikki and Paulo were killed-off because the fans of Lost hated them. The human element does change the storyline!

This is a captivating Season, and I have been a fan since Season 1. Every time questions are answered new ones appear. The acting is superb, and the characters very believable. This is a first rate show, and you can't get any better. There is not one episode I did not enjoy. You never feel like the writers just lost grip of the storyline and threw in an episode as filler. You will find yourself won over by the cast and the plot.

On a funny note, one reviewer writes, ""Why is Hurley still fat? Two years of being stranded on an island should work wonders for obesity unless one of the revelations is that there is an invisible McDonald's there."" One reviewer answers back, ""They haven't been on the island for two years when Season 3 ends; it's only been about 90 days. Plus, Hurley has an eating disorder that he feeds with private stashes of Dharma Initiative candy bars, peanut butter, and other high fat/high calorie snacks.""",1203638400,,3314,4.467768595041322

I just recently watched all of the previous three seasons in order to get ready for the new season. I was watching the episodes in bunches - at least two at a time and often four together. It was great! But now that I'm watching the current episodes they seem sooooo short. They end way too soon! But, no, I'm not going to stop watching and wait for the next DVD set to come out. I did that midway through the second season because my DVR failed to record an episode. I immediately stopped watching the show that year and patiently waited for the DVD release. The show's ratings took a hit at about the same time. I wonder how many other people did what I did?
""Lost"" is easily the richest, most absorbing, thought-provoking show on television. I have no idea how they can make the ending live up to the rest of the show but I'll be there faithfully to the very last episode.",1202947200,,1024,4.2030456852791875

I will take that because this show is genius and so entertaining. All the actors do such a fantastic job that its so hard to choose a favorite. Though I do have mine of course.

But still, when the action did finally pick up, it did not disappoint at all. Here are all the creepy coincidences, plot twists and solid drama we have come to expect from this first-rate series. I have noted that each season seems to have a major theme running through it: with the first it was ""Fate vs Free Will"", in season two it was ""Faith vs Science"" and for number three it's ""Us vs Them"". Expect lots of explorations of group dynamics: belonging to them, being exiled from them, or leading them. Deciding who is friend or foe and how one defines an ""enemy"".

2814310,5,B000P6YNSE,"I'm not one to give away plots in reviews of books or movies or television programs.  I'll do my best not to mention specifics.
I'd heard grumblings about sesaon 2 of this show hitting a slump, which baffled me; it kept me fascinated and engaged the whole time.
Season 3 keep up the momentum.  In addition to strong plots (spine-tingling twists and turns, I kid you not; whose heart is not pumping in episode 6 when Jack screams ""Run, Kate! Run!!"" in the climax?), the characters are fleshed out in a real way.  Think of your own secrets in life, the things you've done of which you're not proud: the LOST characters backgrounds are explored and, for me at least, seem so real and human I can identify because of my own past regrets.  Whether you love, hate, or feel apathy for these characters, they are REAL.
This, of course, is largely to the strong talents of the actors (and much to do with the directors as well).  Stand-outs are Yunjin Kim, as she struggles with her cultural role as a Korean woman, yet an obviously strong person; Evangeline Lilly, whose beauty doesn't detract from her fierceness; Matthew Fox, whose goes deeper into character as a brilliant, clever man with a dark side; Terry O'Quinn, who finally won an Emmy (side note: I don't understand why more of the actors do not receive individual accolades for their work from these organizations that distribute awards), who constantly keeps us wondering if his intentions are good or bad - is he a hero or villain?; Michael Emerson, whose Ben is sheer creepiness as control freak; and ESPECIALLY Elizabeth Mitchell whose cool, bordering on cold, calmness hides depths of despair we can only guess at.
(I will add that I am looking forward to another strong actor's return to season 4: Harold Perrineau - his Michael was heartbreaking and lovable.)

Please allow me to explain a few topics though, this review is a positive one; however there needs to be a clarification toward Box-Sets and telecasts these days.  My wife and I never watch TV, as a matter of fact, when we do hear of a really good show that's televised, we always reply, ""We'll wait for the box-set.""  Understand that it was the marketing surrounding Lost that ruined the experience; along with episodes recounting old scenes & happenings to bring the viewer up to date.  I understand that the producers want the viewer to be `in the loop' with everything, but for all of us Lost fans - it got old and quick.  My wife and I stopped watching Lost on TV and wait for the seasons to come out on DVD/Box-Set due to all the commercials & re-cap episodes; we feel it's insulting and completely ruins the experience.  I'm happy to announce that by default when viewing the 3rd Season of Lost, no re-cap episodes bog down the viewing.  And of course, a sigh of relief every time an obvious cut-scene continues into the next scene without a commercial is a welcome experience.  Without doubt, watching Lost via box-set will devour all viewers, I can only keep my fingers crossed that the future box-sets will be as pleasurable as this one.",1200355200,,1310,4.521186440677966

We waited and waited for this season and we are still waiting. We are stationed in Korea and were spared what must have been an excruciating week to week season. The season is pathetic. It moves at a snails pace up until the last two disks where apparently the writers and directors realized they had squandered away nearly the whole season and something had to be done quickly. One of the few good episodes features a dejected Hurly rising to the challenge and saving the day.

Far too much time is spent on ""Jack"" and ""Freckles"" who are the least interesting characters on the show. One entire episode is devoted to people not previously main characters and who are dead in the end. A virtually wasted show.

2814329,4,B000P6YNSE,"Many viewers and critics alike felt that Season 3 of LOST failed to meet the bar that had been set during the previous seasons.  Specifically, there were about 6-8 episodes during the middle of the Season that were widely critized for not pushing the story arch forward, focusing on uneventful flashbacks, and containing too many new or inconsequential characters.

Personally, after re-watching the Season, I think that despite the relatively slow middle, Season 3 provides a great deal of content.  The last 6-episodes for example, are among my favorite in the entire series.  And no viewer, fan, or critic can deny the significance of the final episode.

This collection is a ""must have"" for any Lostophile.  The special features, and bonus material are of course outstanding; if that's what you are in to.  Casual viewers, or viewers that have not seen all of Seasons 1-2, should really catch up before purchasing or renting this Season.

If you missed out on this Season, get a rush delivery.  Season 4 premeires Thursday, January 31st, 2008; and you don't want to be lost...(pun intended)",1200182400,,1094,5.0
2814330,5,B000P6YNSE,"Lost is full of twists and turns, so is our mood. Sometimes it turns into somewhere very boring, like the first 3 or 4 eps this season or, to some extent, the whole season 2 if compared with season 1. But Lost is different from the upstarts like Prison Break or Samantha Who, it's a complete project with everything in the writers' mind, everything is just under control.

So forget about these ""ugly"" eps, Lost Season is really a shining season, from this season we learn more about the background of these survivors, but most importantly, who is the others why they live in the island and we have a glimpse of something behind everything. The plot is much more twist than the first two season. More surprises, more questions and more answers.

Be patient, Lost will be a masterpiece",1200182400,,784,4.5928571428571425

Season Three delves more deeply into the history and environment of the Others and, although many viewers were put off by the slow pace at the beginning of the season, I think it was necessary to build their background in order to set the stage for what will come later.

As was the case with the DVD sets for Seasons One and Two, this set contains lots of extras... including a booklet containing a summary of each episode... very important for those of us who like to go back and find those moments where the paths of the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 had crossed in the past.",1200182400,,801,4.472602739726027

Season two ended with a bang and the whole island in disarray with cast members captured and confusion everywhere.  Season Three starts out with all new ideas such as showing things from the perspectives of The Others.  Toward episodes 9 and 10 the season slows to a crawl and presents some of the most unsatisfying content that Lost has ever delivered.  The end of the season totally redeems itself though.  The buildup to, and the conclusion of ,season 3 is quite possibly the best television material that I have ever watched.

2814336,5,B000P6YNSE,"While I can't speak for all those cable shows, I know for a fact that LOST is by far the best show on network TV, (with Heroes coming in close second). Watching a season of LOST all the way through on DVD is like reading a really long, exciting, mystery novel, and Season 3 is no different.

Some people claim that the begining of this season drags on, but I have to disagree. Those first six episodes are packed full of action, drama, philosophy, interesing new characters, and all the other staples that LOST is known for. And if you're one of those people that complain about the show not giving enough answers, you will be pleasantly surprised by season 3.

Another great thing about this show is how radically different each season is. Season 1 could be seen as Man VS Nature, season 2 could be seen as Man VS Machine, and season 3 (with its extensive investigation into the world of The Others) could be seen as Man VS Self.

Season 3 also has a few episodes that aren't up to par with most of the others (The Glass Ballerina, Stranger in a Strange Land, Expose), but even those are better than just about anything else you'll see on network TV.

LOST looks like a movie, with its widescreen HD format, spectacular locales, and production values. The acting is mostly top-notch as well; Terry O-Quinn (John Locke) and Michael Emerson (the Other formerly known as Henry Gale) are mezmerizing to watch, and most definetly deserve the acting awards they were nominated for.  Even Matthew Fox (Jack) comes into his own in season 3, delivering a very powerful performance in the season finale.

Season 3 also has some of the greatest episodes in LOST history. A Tale of Two Cities, Flashes Before Your Eyes, Enter 77, The Man From Tallehasse, The Brig, The Man Behind the Curtain, and Greatest Hits have raised the bar considerably. And by the way, Through the Looking Glass is one of the best season finales I have ever seen, and is definetly my favorite LOST episode to date. Can't wait for Season 4!!!!

As for the DVD extras and all that, they pale in comparison to how good the show itself really is. If you don't buy all three seasons of LOST on DVD, I beg you to at least go rent them (start at Season 1). I promise, unless you're one of those people that doesn't like to think, you will love this show. And if you're a fan of Twin Peaks, The X-Files, Heroes, Battlestar Galactica, or sci-fi and mystery in general, then what the hell are you waiting for???

2814355,5,B000P6YNSE,"This was my first viewing of a TV season in High-Def and I have to say the finished product is phenomenal and fans will not be disappointed.

LOST suffered through it's second season and started off slow with the third, but by the end the writers totally redeemed themselves and gave fans a finale they had dreamed of. Critics who say LOST never answers the many questions the show poses were silenced as Season 3 gave answers to some of the biggest questions fans had:

- Who is this guy pretending to be ""Henry Gale?""
- What do the Others want with Jack, Kate and Sawyer?
- Who are The Others?
- What were the ""lists"" the Others had and how did they know so much about the castaways?
- What happened to the hatch and those that were inside it?
- Why can't anyone find the island?
- Why are there polar bears on a tropical island?
- How did Locke become paralyzed and why can he walk now?
- Why did the Others really kidnap Claire in Season 1?

These questions and more are answered definitively.

Season 1 focused on the castaways, Season 2 on the hatch and the mysteries of the island, Season 3 focuses on The Others, finally given the viewers insight into their lives on the island and the motives behind their mysterious actions. Of course the writers don't give away everything, and there are plenty of unanswered questions to keep people's interests peaked, but overall Season 3 is tragic, innovative, entertaining, and very satisfying.

As for the Blu-Ray version itself, you couldn't ask for a better show to have in Hi-Def. The picture quality is outstanding. The discs feature a new option called ""SeasonPlay"" which will play the season straight through with asking you to press play ever again. This smart new feature remembers where you left off in the season, and if you insert the wrong disc it will remind you where the next chronological episode is. Upon finishing a disc, a screen will pop up asking you to insert the next disc, and will automatically begin playing the next episode once you switch discs. This is an awesome feature for anyone who likes to watch several episodes back to back and removes some of the more tedious parts of doing so.

The bonus features on disc six offer fans exactly what they've been asking for: answers. In a sit down interview segment called Access Granted, show producers give definitive answers and explinations for things about the show. Is a certain character really dead? What was the purpose of the hatch in season 2? What did the button really do? etc.
There are also some deleted scenes, outtakes and cast interviews that fans will definitely enjoy.",1199664000,6,2611,4.628509719222462

Why pre-order if they are not going to ship it at least on the release date, if not before?  I paid $68 total, and it was selling at Best Buy for $120.  Great deal, but the shipping was horrible. Waiting arrival, I rented the first 3 discs from Blockbuster splitting the cost with a friend.

2814366,5,B000P6YNSE,"Ever since the early 90's (when TV peaked with TWIN PEAKS) had I to come across such an engaging Series! Weird (in a good way), Insightful and Intelligent - and with much better luck with scheduling and ratings.

The secret in my opinion: truly SMART writing; well-ahead planed plot and characters not only interesting but also one cares about to follow week after week!
Faith and Reason, Fate and Choice, Dogma and Intuition, Nature and Nurture, Good and Evil are, all, in a constant dynamic equilibrium, raising everyday issues under extraordinary conditions to render all the hues discernible and debatable.
Come for the story, stay for the Philosophy.

If you liked the X-FILES you will appreciate the mythology been interwoven with the action (instead of mythology episodes alternating with action episodes and, thus, pretty much ruining the rhythm of the series).
If you liked TWIN PEAKS you will appreciate the skewed reality and the blurry boundaries between reality and fantasy.

The 3rd Season surpassed even the 1st one in plot twists and reversals. Lighter on background stories, it focused more on the Others and Ben's hold on them through the spectral and mysterious Jacob. It also featured one of the gutsier cliffhangers ever: a flash-forward that, had it not been pulled off so skillfully, it would have killed all interest in the show.
True, as expected after the huge success of the show, some...dilution is detectable (the producers are probably worried of running out of ideas) - yet we should be counting our blessings. Even the worse LOST episode is much better than anything else on the air.

This DVD release features 6 disks on the episodes and a 7th one with all the extra features: out-takes, locations, interviews, bloopers and commentaries.

2814368,4,B000P6YNSE,"A lot of reviewers claim that this season lags terribly in the beginning, but picks up later. I have to disagree. I think that feeling must be an artifact of having watched it when it aired on TV. I understand that ABC made some bad airing decisions on this one that frustrated many people.

As with many recent shows (24, Alias, Battlestar Galactica), I waited for a couple of seasons to show up on DVD and then watched them from the beginning - on my own schedule and without commercials.

Viewed in this way, I did not feel at all bad about the first part of this season. I can't add much that other reviewers haven't already covered. I just wanted to add to the discussion that if you're watching the series on DVD (or thinking about it), you won't be disappointed with any part of season 3.",1199491200,4,795,4.364864864864865

I especially liked the back stories of this fascinating cast of characters as they cope with their mysterious new 'home'. Characters we grow to like meet untimely deaths and in season three, one of those will be sadly missed. (Methinks it's back to Hobbitland for him.) Lost third season is most entertaining as we get to know 'the others' who continue to torment the castaways. This season's finale is a knockout with a cliffhanger to top 'who shot JR'. Were the 'survivors' really rescued? Will I have to wait until Dec 2008 for season 4 to appear on DVD? It seems ABC sees fit to bombard us with commercials every 8 minutes and this really bugs me.",1198800000,,807,4.534246575342466
2814378,5,B000P6YNSE,"Lost is the perfect show to showcase the amazing picture and sound only blu-ray high def can offer. Seeing Lost on blu-ray takes the show to a whole new level. With 6 times the resolution of  DVD, everything just seems to pop out at you in this amazing 6 disc set. From the grass and trees on the island to the blue sky and the facial expressions (including seeing the actors pores), every detail just pops out like nothing you have seen before in a TV show. Lost Season 3 blu-ray is truly breathtaking and is one amazing experience to see it in blu-ray high def. This is one of the best TV shows to come out in a long time, and is one of the few shows that hook you in, gets you addicted, and takes you on this emotional journey with the characters. Sometimes after each episode you are lost yourself by what is going on, but it is that mystery and suspense that keep fans coming back for more.  In season 3 we find out more about the others along with some answered questions on some of the characters pasts. Disney/Buena Vista put a lot in their DVD and Blu-ray sets and Season 3 is no exception. Lost The Complete Third Season -- The Unexplored Experience blu-ray is presented in 6 blu-ray discs with all 23 episodes and is presented in full 1080p high definition with a 1.78:1 widescreen transfer. This blu-ray looks even better than the over-the-air high definition transfer which is broadcast in 720p. This is without a doubt the best looking TV show ever in high definition to date. The audio for Lost is great as well.  You get a PCM track which sounds the best and has more impact than the 5.1 dolby digital track. The sound along with the pristine picture just make this set that much more enjoyable. Lost is one show that was truly meant to be seen and appreciated in high definition.

The bonus material is as follows

  ""The World of the Others,"" which explores the crucial role of ""The Others"" in season 3 and what the world of Lost holds for these characters in the future.

  ""Lost Flashbacks"" - Never-before-seen glimpses into the past lives of the castaways

  ""Lost in a Day"" - Fans of Lost will have a chance to see what it really takes to create the show each season.

  ""Lost on Location"" - A behind-the-scenes look at the making of 10 episodes from season 3

  ""The Lost Book Club"" - Learn about the role of literature in the story of Lost in this exploration of the books featured in the series.

The lost saga continues to amaze due to it's interesting storyline and the show has never looked better than on blu ray dvd.  One can only hope that as time passes the studios will figure out to use as much space as they can on each disc. with this series they did just that.  but both hd and blu ray are guilty of not giving alot of extras on most discs. For the price that is paid, each disc is a special edition and should be treated as such.  Lost season three puts the whole series on four discs and this only proves that the hd formats are not usually using all the space available.  this one does  it right though and is a great buy for fans and just casual viewers as well.",1198108800,3,773,4.079470198675497
2814385,5,B000P6YNSE,"Excellent transfer for an amazing season of Lost.  The colors stand out, the scenery is amazing, and this set is a great demo to show off your BluRay player.  Think of the BluRay/HD-DVD edition of ""Planet Earth"", but with better entertainment/actors/plot.  There are so many scenes where you would go ""WOW"" and be happy with the BluRay set.  The bright/contrast levels are great and consistent.  There are a good amount of extras, and there is a section for ""questions answered"" where it's like a recap for beginners to understand Season 3.  The video is sharp, you see everybody's facial flaws and craters.  Oh, and Evangeline Lilly (Kate Austin) looks AMAZING in HighDef.  Not only the video transfer is top notch, but the cover is EXCELLENT.  The way the CD's are organized is incredible, and I like the fact that they have 5 - 6 episodes per BluRay disc.  If you want to compare the set setup to the setup of Heroes, where you open the cover that stretches to a like a mile, this ""Lost"" BluRay set is by far better.  The slip cover is great too, you can insert the box and than CLOSE IT, unlike the DVD set for Season 1 and 2, where it can easily slide out of the slip cover.  Finally we get to view Lost how it should be, in true 1080P. A must own set, at a reasonable price considering the content, well worth it.",1198022400,,1319,4.404958677685951

However, the same cannot be said for the DVD set.
* The discs aren't labeled with numbers, despite being referenced by numbers in the booklets.
* For a show so amazing, there are few audio commentaries, averaging less than one a disc.
* The season finale is broken up into 2 parts, despite being broadcasted in one two hour block.

2814391,5,B000P6YNSE,"I was first turned onto Lost when my brother bought season 1, and immediately I was hooked! I could't wait til season 2 came out, and I loved it almost as much as season 1. Then season 3 came out and I wasn't really able to watch the first couple of episodes, so I had no clue what was going on or what happened. Needless to say I could not wait til season 3 came out on dvd.

I heard alot of things about season 3. Mainly that the first couple of episodes were not really all that good, but the shows start gaining momentum for the season finale. When I finally got my amazon copy, I immediately put it in. Honestly, I don't really know what people were talking about. I have loved it from the start!! Lost has grabbed me yet again and I don't mind being along for the ride.

In my earlier review i mentioned not seeing the entire season yet, well now I have and IT'S AMAZING!!!!! One of the things people have been getting angry with is that they really haven't been answering many of the questions the show has posed. I feel that in season 3 we're finally getting some answers. At the end of just about every episode I found myself thinking... well what happens next?! I needed to know more! It caused me to lose some valuable sleeping time cause Iwould just keep watching. The show seems to grip you like no other show on television. I wish January 31st could come sooner!! Everyone should own Lost, and be Lost along with millions of people! Great Buy!",1197504000,5,1457,4.27536231884058
2814392,4,B000P6YNSE,"If you didn't stop watching after the finale of seson 2, then you probably won't be dissapointed by this season as well.  I thought it got off to a rocky start but after Ep. 6 the season goes into high gear with one mind blowing episode after another, then to finish off the season with one of the greatest cliffhangers next to ""who shot JR?"".

as far as the DVD is concerned, i like it.  it's in tune with the other seasons (which is a big plus).  The one surprising aspect to this set is the lack of special features; which, i guess isn't too surprising considering that the season 2 DVD wasn't too loaded with features as well (with the exception of the ""Lost Connections"", which got me going for at least a few weeks of mapping out the screen and finding all the hidden secrets).

I'd really like to hear more about the mythology of the show and the origins of LOST and how they came up with the show.  but i'm guess these kinds of features may be saved for the end due to the mystery of the show's plotline.  Showing this kind of material may give too much away.

What really get's me is the complete disregard or inclusion of any of the video footage from ""The Lost Experience"" as shown through the many websites between seasons 1 and 2.  I was expecting it on the Season 2 DVD and when they didn't include it, i was surprised but thought maybe it would be in a retro-spective on the Season 3 discs.  But, low and behold they are not there either.  I'd really like some acknowelgement of this video footage at some point.  It seems like a waist of time and money for ABC and the Producers of this great shown not to offer it in some manner.

One more side note that they left out of all the DVD seasons so far have been the clip shows.  even though they are filler specials, they did provide some answers to the fans about certain aspects of the show and hinted at some things that have not yet come to be.  they were fun and informative.

Anyway, if you're on the fence, just leap over because there is a lot of quality stuff to these DVDs, it's well worth the 40 bucks.",1197504000,2,2077,4.220253164556962
2814393,5,B000P6YNSE,"If you call yourself a fan of Lost (or even the hot castaways) this blu-ray set is a MUST OWN! Do not spend $ renting each disc at Blockbuster, because once you see it, you'll know that you have to have it. The original ABC broadcasts aired in HD, which is only 720p, and it was gorgeous. Seeing it in full HD 1080p is just oh-my-gosh, un-freaking-believable, jaw droppingly aah-mazing!!!

If anyone remembers the teaser with the polar bear that aired before season 1 (also a bonus feature on season 1 box set), it was quite a joke when a viewer took the time to slow-mo and passed it around the 'net. People saw that the teaser for season 1 had a limp, stuffed polar bear catapulted into the air, with a result that was the polar opposite of scary. I bring this up now because we've come a LONG way, baby! The polar bear that Locke takes on is fierce, and the other effects are spot on. And hey, if polar bears don't do it for you, Benjamin Linus is still creepy as hell! But my favorite Other/Hostile to watch is by far Dr. Juliet Burke! You can see the look of sincere pity in her eyes, then she shoots our heroes with a taser or knocks 'em out with one punch. She works for the others, but isn't quite one of them, and kept us guessing 'til the end where her real loyalties lie.

Many fans were unsatisfied and frustrated with the first 6-episode arc, especially with Jack, Kate and Sawyer held prisoner, but there was some interesting storytelling in there. For the first time, we see the world of the others! We see where they live, where they work, and that they have shoes, names, TVs and sandwiches! Ben and Juliet's characters develop, as does Kates relationship with you-know-which-guy, but if you don't I won't spoil it. The conflict in the first 6-episodes was necessary, and the cast and crew pulled it off beautifully.

The rest of the season is more of what we're used to: exploring Dharma stations, Sawyer assigning new nicknames, Hurley constantly trying to keep everyones spirits up, even while still grieving for Libby, Locke on the continual quest to communicate with the island (a fascinating character in itself), Charlie and Claire being too cute as the island's only quasi-nuclear family unit, and taking on the baddies while Rousseau blows stuff up...sweeeeet.

Answers: Claire's father (I knew it since mid-season 2), Dharma & the hostiles, Sun's baby's father, Kate's marriage, the con artist that makes James Ford call himself Sawyer, what happened after the sky turned purple, (one of) Jack's tattoos, why Locke was in a wheelchair, and more.

I won't get too into summarising the plot, because you've either watched and you know, or you haven't watched it yet and want to find out for yourself, sooo, on to the bonus features!
Of course it contains the standard bloopers and deleted scenes...the bloopers have some funny moments with Sawyer, Hurley, Charlie, and actors that aren't used to handling guns. The deleted flashbacks answer a question that was better left ambiguous, but it's interesting anyway. Of the 4 episodes with commentary, the one with Damon Lindelof is the best. There's an awesome sneak peek on the Lost PS3 game due in February, and the making of the Lost action figures...after all, no one knows how to merchandise quite like parent-company DISNEY. There's a feature on how any given day, cast and crew are working tirelessly on various stages of pre and post-production and a nice feature hosted by Evangeline Lily that put names and faces to the people that make the show we love so much. For die hard fans that read books featured in Lost there's The Lost Book Club (I'd join in a second!) but most of the titles are explored more in depth in Unlocking the Meaning of LOST: An Unauthorized Guide by Lynnette Porter and David Lavery. Another orientation video from the Orchid Station can be viewed as well. White rabbits are ALWAYS more than meets the eye on this island! Many more juicy extras you'll just have to watch, but trust me, it's worth every minute!

Now, what you've been waiting for: the blu-ray exclusive features! From the moment you open the box, you'll see a letter from Damon and Carlton that lets you know that this blu-ray is SPECIAL, as well as a video intro from them at the beginning of disc 1. Blu-prints takes you on a fun little tour, and having seamless menus and being able to watch a bonus feature and pick up where you left off is great, but what really makes it worth the blu-ray price over the DVD price is Access: Granted. Here, Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse give definitive ANSWERS to a long list of mysteries, followed by further discussion by Jimmy Kimmel (his theories are out there and a bit silly) and writers from Lost Magazine, Entertainment Weekly(these 2 know what they're talking about), and a woman from the TV Guide channel plays Captain Obvious. Astute fans will have already figured out most of these, but there are still surprises, an EASTER EGG, and validation from Damon and Carlton that you were right all along.

If you're like me, you probably watch every minute of each Lost season's box set in less than a week...so cancel your plans, get comfortable, get snacks, and get LOST!!!",1197417600,,5193,4.668852459016393
2814394,5,B000P6YNSE,"The creators of Lost definitely know what they're doing.  On my original viewing of season 3 I was worried that they may have been losing focus, as the the stories seemed less connected and relevant to the show than the first two seasons.  Some weeks would be really enjoyable and enthralling, while others, while still good, just didn't really impress me.  As the season reached a close I had some doubts as to how they would tie up everything while still leaving enough unanswered to draw me back in for season 4.

Then the season finale came, and everything made sense.  Viewed as a whole, season 3 really delivered.  Of all the shows I have watched this is definitely one where you have the judge each season after it's over because the creators definitely know what they're doing.  Each episode seemed different in hindsight because I could now see how everything was leading up to the end of the season.  As for the season finale, it delivered one of the biggest shocks I have ever gotten while watching a television program.

So, if you gave up during season 3 I strongly recommend you give it another chance.  There's still time to catch up before season 4 starts in February.",1197331200,,1184,4.62200956937799

2814397,5,B000P6YNSE,"This was by far my fav season of LOST. It didn't fair as well when being aired on TV, but when you watch them at your own pace, the the flow of the show makes it that much better.

The Blu Ray set is well worth the money. The picture is very sharp as is the sound. I have to agree with the creators of the show, this is the WAY Lost is supposed to be seen.  The island/beaches just jump out at you. It's simply stunning.

Don't be deterred from some of the negative reviews on here, they are just complaining that LOST isn't on the HD DVD format. What that has to do with THIS product, is beyond me.

You can't beat the price either, so by it NOW while it's on sale. Most TV DVD sets are $50 when not on sale, so for $10 more, you get the whole show  in HD. Also consider that you are getting 24+ hours worth of content. When the average 2 hour movie is $19 on DVD...well, do the math.

Their leader Ben (Michael Emerson) has a tumor, and they want Jack to remove it.

Meanwhile, back at the beach camp, the rest of the survivors of flight 815 are recovering from the explosion of the hatch.  Desmond (Henry Ian Cusick) lost all his clothes when things went boom, but he seems to have gained a new power.  Hurly (Jorge Garcia) returns with news of the capture of Jack, Sawyer, and Kate, and various parties set out to rescue them.  But this season has plenty of surprises in store for the castaways.  What will they learn next?

This season can pretty much be divided into two parts.  The first part was slow, with the story only moving forward at a snail's pace.  After it return from its hiatus, the pace improved dramatically.  I'm not sure that we got that many answers, but I at least feel that the story moved forward.  What these revelations mean to the show and the cast aways remains to be seen, but I am once again confident that the show will bring us resolution.

And that leaves out the cliffhanger ending.  That had to be one of the best shocks of the season.  I never saw it coming, and it left my mouth hanging open.  Yes, it truly was a rattlesnake in a mailbox.

This set will certainly wet your appetite for season 4 (and hopefully we'll get that sooner rather then later).  If you want to get caught up in a show with plenty of twists and mysteries, get Lost.",1197331200,,1707,4.430868167202572

Now, some people have problems with the first 6 episodes.  I don't think any of the episodes were bad or boring in any way, however, when the show returned from a three month hiatus it really hit it's stride.

This season introduced four new main chracters: Juliet Burke, a fertility doctor, Benjamin Linus, who was in severel episodes of Season 2, Nikki Fernadez, an actress before crashing on the Island, and
Paulo, Nikki's boyfriend.  Juliet and Ben are great, but Nikki and Paulo didn't get much screen time until their flashback episode, ""Expose.""

There were plenty of classic episodes in Season 3: ""The Cost Of Living"" where Mr. Eko went on a quest which leads to disatorous events, ""The Man From Tallahasse"", which showed Locke, Kate, and Sayid rescuing a friend, ""One of Us"", where we get some valuable information on Juliet's past, and my personal favorite episode of Lost,""The Man Behind The Curtain"", where Ben and Locke journey to see the myesterious Jacob.

Maybe 'the others' watched it differently, but being a crazy vivid LOST fan i am, i totally think that, there are nothing wrong on the first 6 episodes, yes, there were more suspense added, but it just kept me guessing and put on my own theories.., thus, i love the way the show present the plots.

To me, the more mystery the show deliver, the merrier, it will make this show more unique with alot of question raises and more and more debates on those questions. This is how the show suppose to be made, after all, we are watching a show call 'LOST'.., therefore, i don't mind for being 'lost' together with the show, as i totally i enjoy every single episodes of season 3.

As a crazy 'LOST' fan, i don't mind to watch those episodes again and again, lol.., maybe i am somewhat 'LOST' too, LOL.. xD

2814409,4,B000P6YNSE,"Warning: some spoilers!

Overall, not my favoirte Lost season. Now, i have been a Lost-acholic ever since i bought the first season on DVD and i belive that it is one of the most well crafted shows out there. Sure, it may bring up more questions then answers but then that will give us more answers and revelations.
So you can pretty much divide this season into two halves. The first being the 'fall season', which was the first six episodes and then the 'spring season', being the next sixteen. I thought the Fall season was pretty...well, boring to say the least. Barely nothing happens and nothing is resolved (unless u count Jack's tattoe's, but i really didn't pay much attention to them anyway). However, things definently picked up during the Spring season. First smart move, getting rid of Nicky and Paolo, in a very nicely contructed episode that ended with a macarbe and sinister end. Second, getting Sawyer and Kate off that island. Finally, bringing a background to Juliette and some of the other 'Others'. And finally, that season finale, by far the best one yet. I mean honestly, who can say they saw THAT one coming?
Now, the new season won't start until February. For the Lost fans, thats bad. But for the rest of you, its the perfect oppertunity to pick up the first three seasons of Lost so you can get all caught up before the season premire. and for the rest of you, just give it time. Trust me, all good things come to those who wait.",1192838400,,1456,4.557251908396947
2814410,5,B000P6YNSE,"At first I thought the island was going to lose some of its magic since we now know who the ""others"" are and found out a lot more about them during Season 3, but they really brought in so much more to keep you biting your nails. DO NOT judge this season by the first 4-5 episodes, you will regret it. Once it picks up and gets going, you will be taken for the journey of your life.

And if you're looking for the episodes, you can get them on ITunes for $1.99 each, they download right to your computer, great quality too.

2814412,5,B000P6YNSE,"This season of Lost is, in my opinion, the best season yet! It contains some of the most brilliantly crafted and acted episodes of the series so far. The first six episodes pick up where Season 2 left off and tells the story of what happened to Kate, Sawyer and Jack while being held by The Others. They are all solid episodes but when Lost returned from it's hiatus in February, this show started to heat up like nothing you have ever seen. WOW!!! Some of the Season 3 episodes are likely to go down as some of the BEST television episodes OF ALL TIME! When Season 3 finally reaches it's conclusion with the MIND BLOWING FINALE, you can't help but be profoundly affected.

On a personal note: Desmond, I LOVE YOU! I will look for you until the END OF TIME! Do not give up hope.",1188777600,3,778,4.292517006802721
2814413,5,B000P6YNSE,"Another fantastic season of Lost!  The best show on TV pretty much just keeps getting better.  Although the third season arguably starts out a little weak, it really picks up in the second half (exactly like season 2 did...) and finishes with a bang.

So much is learned about the 'Others' in season 3, and Michael Emerson steals the show as Benjamin Linus, the best character on the show.  Tons of mystery, surprises, action, drama, heartache, humour, etc.  Pick this up as soon as you can... but watch first 2 seasons first.",1188259200,2,526,4.673913043478261
2814414,5,B000P6YNSE,"Let me just start by saying i have never liked movies about being stranded on an island. Blue Lagoon, Castaway etc etc, i avoid those movies like the plague, why? Lets just say growing up in Chicago i have become used to urban enviroments and movies in general with a lot of stuff going on. How much can possibly go on when stranded on an island, fish? Swim away from sharks? Building a fire? Don't get me wrong, i like character development as much as the next person (never seen a lord of the flies movie but i read the book and did enjoy it, but thats the only stranded scenario i have ever gotten into) but i just couldn't buy the old grass huts and spear fishing cliche over and over again.

  So what made me start watching Lost, i hate to say that into the third season i saw a commerical with Evangeline Lily in it and thought to myself, a show with a girl that fine in it has to be at least decent, if anything maybe i could catch some rainy scenes with her in it. So i downloaded the season premiere of season 3, a tale of 2 cities. When i saw the airplane going down after the others (didnt know at the time) came out of their houses i was just blowned away. For one, i thought it was just about a deserted island, instead i get people walking out a neigborhood that looks like surburbia in any ol city. So i thought to myself after watching the episode only one thing.....""I have to get the first 2 seasons Now"".

  Now after being completely won over by the cast of lost for 2 seasons i jumped right back where i left off, the second episode of the 3rd season. Now i heard many reviews about how weak the first 6 episodes are. While it was nothing compared to the second half of the season, it was just basically giving a little insight into who the others really were. The whole dynamic between Jack and Julia is particularly fascinating, simply because Jack never truly falls for Julia like he has fallen for Kate, Julia however falls head over heels for Jack. The fact that they shared the most important bond (getting off the island) drew them closer together.

  I enjoyed the episode when Ben shows jack the footage of the world series with Boston winning and the Look on Jack's face is probably the most stunning/revealing Look on the entire run of the show, You feel Jack's Pain that he can't get home but he realizes the world is still going on and it fuels him to do whatever is neccesary. The season picks up like a runaway train with the return of Lost that came on at 10:00pm est.  Now, Lost is one of the only shows that can get away with coming on so late..10o'clock at night on the east coast, i am usually in bed by 9:30 and you want me to stay awake till 11:00pm. But you know what...i did it anyway, they could show this show at 3:00am and i would set my alarm  clock to watch this outstanding show.  Honestly, in my humble opinion their was not one weak episode in the whole season, even the episode ""expose"" which people seem to loathe for some reason i found enjoyable, sure not as much as others but the ending alone made a chill just go up my spine.

  Lost is like crack to me, if i miss an episode i am downloading it the next day just so i can watch it, i am addicted and i will be addicted until my friends get off that darn island, and when they do, thats when i'll be in tears because this show that has brought me so much entertainment will finally be over.....thank goodness for dvd's.",1188259200,22,3430,4.215267175572519
2814415,5,B000P6YNSE,"Even though the first 6 episodes of Season 3 are rather slow, it is more than made up for with the episodes that follow.

Fantastic stand-outs such as ""The Man From Tallahassee"", ""Par Avion"", ""Flashes Before Your Eyes"", ""The Man Behind the Curtain"", and especially ""The Brig"" are just absurdly entertaining and gripping hours of television.

There was a lot of griping over this show in the beginning of Season 3, which unfortunately means a lot of people missed out on the absolutely stellar second half. Pick this up now if you are even remotely interested in the show, and if you are someone who stopped watching early on, I cannot even express how badly you need to see this season. 5 STARS.",1187913600,2,833,4.628378378378378
2814416,4,B000P6YNSE,"Another masterful season of ""Lost"" has come to a crashing, and enigmatic end.  For fans (like me) drawn to the show's thrills and riddles, Season 3 didn't disappoint.  Like Season 2, you can't just get into the show, but ""Lost"" more than rewards those who can start from the beginning.

ARE YOU LOST:  ""Lost"" follows the trauma-filled lives and back-stories of the survivors of Oceanic Ft. 815, which crashed on a mysterious island enroute from Sydney to LA.  As time passed, and hopes for an immediate rescue dimmed, the survivors realized that they would have to come to terms with their new home, even as (we see in flashbacks) none have proved capable of coming to terms with their flawed lives.  We met jack Shepard, a doctor obsessed with fixing whatever's broken, except for his own family.  We also met Sawyer, the conman and heroic anti-hero.  Kate is the woman between the two of them, a criminal on the run for murder.  Locke (Terry O'Quinn) is a man with a long and complicated past - one that crippled him physically as well as emotionally, until he came to the Island, and found himself mysteriously bonded to it.

Then there are The Others.  Hinted at until the end of the 1st season, we find by the end of Season 2 that the others inhabit an organized commune on the island.  Their purpose and the bizarre strains of their society are slowly pealed away like an onion.  At the climax, the Others blackmailed Michael into helping them kidnap Jack, Kate, Sawyer and Hurley.  (Hurley was released with orders to warn the rest of the survivors to keep away from their half of the island.)  Who are the others, and what is their connection to the shadowy ""Dharma Initiative""?  And what about ""Fake Henry Gale""?  Revealing himself as Ben Linus doesn't quite begin to explain his knotty soul - Ben proves to be as trustworthy, a politician of sorts adept at using fear and hatred to manipulate others.  (For politically minded viewers, the opening scene of Season 3 will raise disturbing parallels with 9/11, and its principal players.)  But in the end, the Others are perfectly drawn because, like the Island, they have a perfectly maintained air of mystery.

In Season 3, Jack must confront the others, find out why he was singled out, and maneuver between them to get Sawyer and Kate to safety.  New characters get the Lost treatment, with flashback episodes for Ben, Desmond (the crazy guy found by Locke in The Hatch) and Juliet, a doctor among the others used by Ben to manipulate Jack.  We see Locke struggle through a crisis of faith over the island, while Hurley attempts to defeat ""the numbers curse"" (another great Hurley episode).  Returned to the good graces of Claire, Charlie learns that he is marked for a grim fate.  These and many other character plot twists abound in Season 3, as ""Lost"" shows that it's lost none of its momentum.  The inertia continues right up to the end of the season finale, which has all the thrills and mystery of the rest of the season and something that the other shows don't - a flash-forward.",1187136000,6,3047,4.671669793621013

Although we the fans have to wait 'til next February to see what happened, I can't wait because I think the fourth season will probably be the best, more twist and turns just ahead for the passengers of Oceanic Flight 815. Of course there were some casualties this season, we lost some great cast members, and what's with Juliet's face? The muscles in her face don't move? Can you say botox junkie!  My fave character is John Locke played by the extraordinary Terry O'Quinn, in flashbacks the long-kept secret of how Locke got into that wheelchair was finally revealed, it was a brilliant episode.

I never watch popular TV because it is boring, old and cliche, but LOST has broken the mould and sucked me in.
The entire team involved in LOST is a cut above the rest. I got in to this show when my wife was watching it and I had to go back to the beginning in order to see the entire series. NOW, I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL FRIGGIN' FEBRUARY, 2008 FOR THE SHOW TO GO ON; MADDENING!!!!!
There were only a couple of episodes that were not spectacular, and even those were not terrible. I am not following all of the conspiracy types that are obsessing over where the show is going, so I don't know what to expect next, but I cannot wait for season 4.

Of course the regular DVDs can be upconverted to high-def, which looks okay, but it's NOT THE SAME!  Especially for something as amazing as Lost.  ;)

2814424,4,B000P6YNSE,"""Lost"" ended its second season with a bang... literally. The hatch violently imploded, and Kate, Sawyer and Jack were captured by the Others.

And so the third season is all about the repercussions of those events. It lags badly in the first half, but shocking predictions and new arrivals on the island add fresh twists -- and some stunning answers -- to the twisty, surreal storyline. But there's still plenty left for the remaining three seasons.

Kate and Sawyer are put to work, then locked up in gorilla cages, while Jack is similarly imprisoned inside an Other compound -- and finds that he is there to be a doctor to the sinister Ben, who is suffering from a spinal tumor. Jack finds himself suspended between two Others -- Ben and the mysterious Juliet -- and unsure what to do, or who to trust.

The tensions between the Others and castaways become worse as Kate and Sawyer escape, and she mounts a rescue to find Jack. But even when they get him (and the disgraced Juliet) back, things don't improve -- Juliet is secretly spying for Ben, Desmond has terrible visions of Charlie's demise, and the newly solo Locke forces Ben to reveal the island's greatest secret -- Jacob, a mysterious power that commands the Others like a god.

Suddenly a woman parachutes onto the island, and tells the castaways that a ship is only a few miles out to sea. As the Others fragment and turn against each other, the survivors decide to take them out once and for all, while Charlie and Desmond set off to infiltrate an underwater hatch. But there will be shocking losses on both sides, as Jack is faced with the most important decision he may ever make....

""Lost"" still has plenty of unsolved, unanswered mysteries, and the first half of the season is frustratingly slow and oblique. No answers, at all. But it picks up and answers questions in the second half, including who ruined Sawyer's life, who commands the Others, and the relationship between Dharma Corporation and the Others and why they protect the island so fiercely.

The writing for the first half is pretty lax (major questions are answered with non-answers like ""We watch""), but later on it tightens up considerably, with dozens of seemingly unrelated plot threads coming together in the battle with the Others. Locke's dad, Desmond's checkered past, Rousseau's daughter and Sun's pregnancy are only a few of them.

But despite all the personal drama (enough about the love triangle!), the stories are still full of gritty action (including Sayid killing a man with just his feet), and increasingly twisted flashbacks that let us see the pre-crash lives of the islanders. These had gotten kinda stale, but Desmond's timeslip makes it seem fresher, as does the revelation of how Ben became King of the Magic Island. It answers a lot of questions too.

And there's the occasional loss. Two beloved characters bite the big one in this season, and the handling of their deaths is enough to bring tears to your eyes. But there's some humor as well -- usually provided by Hurley, who revives an old van, triumphs at Ping-pong, and even gets to be the rescuing cavalry. Not to mention the wry, solid dialogue ("" If it was Rousseau's, a massive rock would be flying at my head right now"").

Matthew Fox and Evangeline Lilly turn in some solid performances as the increasingly tormented castaways. But Dominic Monaghan and Henry Ian Cusick really rule the acting front, with their poignant struggles with love for their respective girlfriends, and the angst that Desmond's visions bring to them both. And Josh Holloway does a brilliant job, especially in the harrowing, claustrophobic episode in ""The Brig.""

The first half of ""Lost's"" third season is decidedly tepid -- not terrible, but flabby. But when it tightens up again, this tense series blossoms out. It'll be a long wait until season four.",1185926400,22,3852,4.822727272727272

2814426,3,B000P6YNSE,"I thought Lost started too late this past season and believe that was the biggest reason they lost such a large part of the audience.  People had already developed their viewing habits and then Lost came way later.  Personally, I prefer it when things are spread out over the networks so there is always something on rather than everyone running in September but Lost waited way too long.  I also never really liked the opposite either where a show runs every week for 8, 10 or more weeks in a row like 24.  I like the show (but not last year) but do like an occassional break.  The decision for Lost III to come out so late though is really annoying.  First off, if the show is starting so late, great and advertising for Christmas is great too but how about giving us all a chance to watch it again before the start of season 4 which cleary is going to be shown nearly everyweek after that?  If Lost II was ready in September last year, I don't get why the new one can't be ready the same time --- they would likely sell more too because the initial rush of buyers will still be strong and the Christmas buying will still happen too with new interest as the show will be about to start.
  One really good thing though is the price ---- pretty good especially for a 7 disc set.  I of course will be buying it but now it will come after I buy quite a few others --- yet again, not such a good idea to wait.
  One final complaint, more to Amazon, is the rating.  Why is a rating forced when we have not yet seen or had a chance to really see the product?  These early reviews are about the season sure, but without seeing extras, I have to give it the middle rating of 3.",1185494400,8,1670,4.145962732919255

The tone of the show lighten up a bit, i think there was a bit more humor in this season that the last one.
Answers that the fans wanted started finally coming, like the secret of Jack's tatoo, how Locke ended up in a wheelchair, who would Kate choose.  New questions were also brought up as we move into the final half of Lost.  The best thing about this season?  The finale.  It is truly as the producers said, ""a game changer"".

2814432,4,B000P6YNSE,"I became a Lost fan this last December. I bought Season 1 on dvd just because I had heard so much about it and was curious. I was hooked from the first episode. Not a single time during season 1 was I disappointed or get bored.

Then I bought season two. Everyone that I knew who had already seen season 2 warned me that it was horrible. One friend told me that on a scale of 1-10, season 2 was a 4. That's awful! Most told me not to expect much, that I would be very disappointed, and so forth. So I watched, with low expectations, and I ended up loving it. I think it's because my expectations were SO low that I had no where to go but up with the show. There were some things I didn't like about season 2 - them replaying one scene over and over again through a different persons point of view was irritating and felt like a waste. Overall though, I enjoyed season 2.

For season 3, a friend of mine downloaded the season and we watched it together. I HATED about half of season 3. It was so boring! I didn't like that the survivors were all seperated now. I was getting REALLY irritated with Kate. I was just not happy at all. It felt like the show was not progressing at all for me until about mid-way through and it felt as if a the show had just taken a shot of espresso. It picked up so fast and got so damn good that I felt like screaming, and crying, at the end of season 3.

This show is definitely my favorite show right now. I am aware that I have to trust the writers and be patient. It kills me when the audience gets an answer to a question only to receive 3 more questions in return, but it makes the show SO much fun.

I will definitely buy this season when it comes out. I will probably re-watch ALL of the seasons before Season 4 begins just to refresh.",1184112000,2,1773,4.042735042735043

No matter how mundane a particular show is, I feel each and everyone has something to contribute to the solving overall mystery of the island and the people.  I am just enjoying the ride.  Just like life, there are peaks and valleys.  Watching the DVD is the best way to go, since you can immediately see the next episode, sans commercials. I watched the whole first season on DVD after the second season had already begun, then got caught up, and am still hooked.  LOST is the only show I will NOT miss each week...even if I must record it.

2814435,5,B000P6YNSE,"This is probably the best and deepest show to ever have been on tv. You have to study this show, read other books that show up in the form of easter eggs and watch each episode at least 3 times to really get it. This show asks philosophical questions and uses elements from the bible, Alice in Wonderland, the Wizard of Oz and a thousand other influences to give us that rare show that will fuel imaginations for generations to come.

That all being said we are only a little over half way through. With 3 more seasons (16 episodes each) to go, this season gave us many of the answers about the characters. It told us how Locke lost his ability to walk, who the real Sawyer was and how Benjamin Linus got to the island to name a few. We also had a glimpse of the mysterious Jacob but most intriguing of all is the idea that the bad guys are in fact the good guys, at least in comparison to this other enemy that has been looking for the island from the beginning.

It's quite a show. I don't feel it dipped in quality at all, but things were certainly set up for some big pays off at the end of this season. There is no question that if you are a fan of this show you have to pick this DVD set up. You have to study each episode so that you get the big picture.

So now that the writers have a definite timeline there is little question that each proceeding episode will be a step towards some answers from here on out. But remember Lost is like a long novel like the Stand. If you stopped reading the Stand when you thought it was getting boring then you cheated yourself out of a great book and would not have later realized that it was all important.

If you're just a normal television watcher who enjoyed the first season but thought the second season was too over the top and strayed away from what you loved about the show...well, the third season didn't help anything.

Also, the third season sees LOST desperately relying on suspenseful endings that I guess are suspenseful because there is loud music and the camera pans really quickly.  However, not even the directorial cues can hide the fact that the show's story is anemic at this point.

2814443,4,B000P6YNSE,"It's no secret that the third season of Lost got off to a slow and shaky start, and it's even less of a secret that the show rebounded in the last episodes of the season and once again displayed that early promise it first showed back in 2004 upon it's premiere.  As the season begins, Jack (Matthew Fox), Sawyer (Josh Holloway), and Kate (Evangeline Lilly) are imprisoned by Ben (Michael Emerson) and the Others, while Sayid (Naveen Andrews), along with Jin (Daniel Dae Kim) and Sun (Yunjin Kim) wait to see what happens.  In the meantime, the aftermath of the hatch explosion leaves Desmond (Henry Ian Cusick) a changed man with deadly premonitions of the future for Charlie (Dominic Monaghan), and Locke (Terry O'Quinn) embarks on a mission to rescue a wounded Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje).  Eventually everyone is brought back together, as Jack prepares to lead an assault on the Others in an attempt to escape the island once and for all, which leads to the explosive season finale which changes everything about Lost from this point onward.  As we've come to expect, some questions are answered while plenty of new ones appear, but this season of Lost manages to mostly satisfy thanks to the fine ensemble cast and plenty of surprises, including demises of a fan favorite character, and a not so favorite one as well.  Other than the complaints of the deliverate pacing of the show, some favorites like Hurley (Jorge Garcia), Charlie, and Claire (Emilie de Ravin) aren't focused on as much as one would like, but their centric-based episodes are enjoyable nevertheless.  The rest of the cast, which also features Elizabeth Mitchell as a shady Other who may or may not hold the key to escape, and 300's Rodrigo ""Xerxes"" Santoro, are also standouts as well.  Despite it's flaws though, the season finale is brilliantly delivered and truly changes everything we know about the show and it's concept, and will have you salivating for more.  All in all, the third, and somewhat maligned, season of Lost illustrates even more that not everything is always as it seems, but at least that way things manage to stay interesting.",1180742400,8,2131,4.867403314917127

There is no other show I look forward to every week, but this one. After I watch each episode, i always marvel at how well the story was told and how something seemingly unimportant (as the van with dead Roger in it), meant so much after all.

This show has such talented people behind it to be able to foreshadow and tie events together with such finesse. There are some points I am still a little curious about, but I am sure it will be explained as the seasons progress.

The actors and actresses are amazing. I love the depth of their actings and how they play out their characters and make me care weekly what happens to them.

The third season was amazing, I most especially loved the episodes after the break. I was shocked when Eko died because I believed they could have used his muscle (LOL), but then with the deaths of all the tailies (except from Bernard's) the focus comes back to the fronties, the people that the audience really cared about.

The season ender was so breathtaking and makes me sad to think I have to wait a longgggg time before I get to watch the events after the rescue play out.

Kudos to everyone behind this show. You are the reason I turn the TV on weekly.",1180051200,9,1392,4.3307692307692305
2814447,5,B000P6YNSE,"Warning!  Major spoiler alert!

I believe that Season Three of LOST is one of those seasons of a show that will have a significant impact on the dynamics of television quite apart from the merits or demerits of the season itself.  This is mainly due to various tensions the networks have had in broadcasting serial dramas.  Season Two of LOST provoked vast viewer anger over the seemingly endless repeats.  All season long they would give us four or five new episodes, only to do three or four repeats.  No one knew sometimes if they would be tuning into a repeat or a new episode.  To counter this, ABC made the decision to broadcast six episodes in the fall to be followed by sixteen episodes shown without interruption beginning in January.  Unfortunately, the six episodes they showed in the fall were almost universally perceived as the weakest group of episodes in the show's run.  The results of all this I think will be threefold:

1.  In the future, I think the trend with popular serial dramas will be to broadcast shows in uninterrupted hunks.  We had already seen this happening with 24.  I think after the Season Three debacle with LOST, which saw the show lose a huge number of viewers during its break, this will become far more commonplace.

2.  The general perception of the first six episodes of the season was that they dawdled too much, provided too little plot development, and simply didn't advance the narrative sufficiently.  Shows tend to learn from the mistakes and failures of other series.  Damon Lindelhof of LOST has stated that the writers on the show have attempted to avoid the piling up of mysteries that occurred on TWIN PEAKS and the lack of focus on character rather than plot on THE X-FILES and to emulate the focus on character within the overall narrative that was seen in BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  I believe in the future that writers on other serial narratives will strive to make sure that the mysteries on a show are being revealed at a good pace.  (Just as I think future writers will try to emulate the pace at which this has been done on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.)

3.  There was also a widespread perception that in much of Season Two of LOST and the first six episodes of Season Three, the overall narrative was simply being padded out to ensure a long run for the show.  From the beginning looked like a show that needed fewer rather than more seasons to be truly good, but it appeared that with the ratings monster it was in the first two seasons that the powers that be were hoping they could stretch it out to seven or eight seasons instead of five or six.  Luckily, the huge backlash against the show following the first six episodes--a backlash that occurred both among everyday fans and among TV critics--seems to have created a reassessment and in the spring it was announced that LOST would be back for three more sixteen-episode seasons.  I was delighted with how positively this announcement was greeted by fans and critics alike.  I think the result has been for the networks to recognize that certain kinds of series have only a limited potential in terms of the number of episodes that can be produced, that there are certain series that you can really only produce if you anticipate their going four or five or at most six seasons.  The other series this is happening with is BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, which like LOST is more or less telling a single story.  Both of these are outstanding series that will benefit from a smaller number of series (the debate among the producers of BSG at the moment is whether they need to end the series at the end of Season Four or whether they will need a Season Five).  As a negative example there is PRISON BREAK, which currently is threatening to fall apart for lack of any real plan.

The great news about Season Three is that after the long break the show came back as good as ever.  If we were rating this as one would rate an ice skater, we'd have to give it a lower rating based on some slips and falls early in its routine.  But it rebounded wonderfully and the frustration that most viewers experienced in the fall rarely if ever returned in the spring.  Furthermore, they started giving us concrete answers to a host of questions that had been bothering us for ages.  We found out all about the others (though not where they originally came from), about the lay out of the island, about the facilities on the island, and a few of -- though by no means all of -- the island's secrets.  At the end of the season there were still things we'd like to know about -- Just who is Jacob?  What's up with the black smoke?  What makes the island so special? What was the genesis of the Dharma Initiative -- but there is no doubt that we knew vastly more than we knew before.  There were also many new characters.  Ben, whom we knew in Season Two as Henry, was back and became one of the most fascinating characters on the show.  And we were introduced to the enigmatic Juliet, whose sad and wistful smile was as impossible to comprehend as the Mona Lisa's.  We learned that following the decimation of the hatch at the end of Season Two Desmond experienced visions of the future and seemed doomed to reenacting events.  The deep attraction between Jack and Kate was made more explicit even though she ends up furthering things with Sawyer.  And as many fans suspected as early as Season One, Locke's father turned out to be the real Sawyer.  Our Sawyer coming face-to-face with the real Sawyer was not only one of the highlights of the season but of the entire series.

I want to say something about the finale, but without giving away the details of how the last five minutes of the season changes absolutely everything we know about the series.  The changes are, interestingly, not so much in new revelations as in ways that are open for the show to proceed narratively in the future.  For the past three seasons the narrative has proceeded in the present with flashbacks to the past of various characters.  That is no longer possible.  In the future the narrative will of necessity either proceed on the island with flash forwards or will take place in the future with flashbacks to events following the end of Season Three.  (Sorry to be vague here, but I really think that one should watch Season Three without knowing what happens at the end of the season to change everything so completely.)  I honestly have no idea what way they will proceed.  If I had to bet, I would say that the show will continue to use flashbacks, but that the main narrative will proceed in the present.  The first three seasons took place pretty much exclusively in the calendar year 2004.  I believe Season Four could well take place in 2008 with flashbacks to the previous four years.  Regardless, the surprising ending changed everything.

There is one beef I want to make with the show.  As much as I love this series, it has to handle the death of characters worse than just about any I have seen.  The first series to kill off a substantial number of central and beloved characters was BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  There had been other deaths on television series, to be sure.  The death of Deep Throat at the end of the first season of THE X-FILES was close to unprecedented at the time.  Previously characters largely died because they wanted to leave a show, like the death of Edith on ALL IN THE FAMILY or Denise Crosby's departure from STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION.  But BUFFY created the habit of killing off key characters.  I'm not sure I've ever been so completely shocked at the death of any character on TV as I was when Angel killed Jenny Calendar in Season Two of BUFFY.  It shattered the hallowed tradition on TV that you simply don't kill off characters you like.  It ushered in a new era on TV to great effect.  Suddenly, a new sense of danger was introduced to TV.  Before you always knew that all the characters would survive any catastrophe, no matter how dire, simply because that was the nature of TV.  But after BUFFY and the way that other series so quickly picked up on its willingness to kill characters, a new sense of precariousness extended to almost every show on TV.  And TV was certainly the better for it.  One thing that made the deaths on BUFFY so compelling was that each one carried such a great price and had such enormous consequences.  All the deaths were exceedingly well done.  But this has not been the case on LOST.  Perhaps the deaths will be made less meaningless by developments in the final three seasons, though I somehow doubt it.  Characters were killed off in almost random fashion.  At least there was no real sense about why they were killed off.  It seems like someone said, ""Well, we need to kill someone off.""  And some of the deaths seemed to be caused by off screen activities.  Michelle Rodgriguez's death in Season Two was thought by many to be in response to a violation of probation that might have required some jail time and impinged on the shooting schedule (she claims she only signed up for one season).  In Season Three Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's great character Mr. Eko was killed reportedly because he was hated by all his fellow cast members and he hated them all in return (some anonymous cast members reported that he was dictatorial to the extent of telling other actors what they should do or how to speak their lines--all reports are that no one was sad to see him leave the set).  But even so his death felt like he had been ripped from the show prematurely.  And a major death in the season finale felt equally unnecessary.  I believe that this will also influence future shows.  I think ""the body count"" is a permanent fixture in any series with an adventure element, but I think that future shows will strive not to make the death of characters as superfluous as they have been in LOST.

The final three seasons will all begin in the winter and be broadcast for sixteen straight weeks with no interruptions.  I love this not merely because it means no dead times between episodes but because it puts definite limits on how much time they have left to finish the story.  I think most fans of the show feel a lot better about how things are going now than they did last fall.  Then the series seemed moribund and seemed almost to be drifting.  Now it feels like it is heading somewhere definite.  And it ended the season by doing something that all the really great shows do:  it took a gigantic risk that changes everything.  I look forward with excitement to what happens next.",1179964800,309,10540,4.556087187666135

Rather than review this show based on all the myriad of detailed plot points, which I know have been discussed in great detail here and elsewhere, I will rather concentrate on why LOST is so popular and what it is about the core concept in LOST that has viewers engaged in such an intelligent way.

What is the core universal appeal of LOST?

Now remember I am not attempting to answer the mysteries of the show although I may hit on answers in this short review.

LOST has a great appeal to viewers because it serves as a metaphor for the great mysteries of existence. This is the fundamental appeal of the show.  In our, the viewers, day to day lives spirituality is mostly absent. All the religions we were raised on did a very poor job of catching up with the modern world and modern concepts so we mostly abandoned the religions we were raised on.

Now, that is a bold statement so I will add that religions are not wrong, per say, they are just lacking modern analogies or metaphors to help us as people relate to the fundamental mysteries of the universe.

Some films have become modern metaphors for this gap in relating to the mysteries of the universe. These films are very popular as a result of this underlying content being presented so well, and so basic that we mostly do not even notice why we enjoy the movie so much. Star Wars The Lord of the Rings, and the Matrix are three such epics that serve as fine examples of this. Sure many are critical of SW but it has a universal appeal and I feel that appeal is because it points to basic concepts such as fate, the forces of the universe, good and evil, and more. Despite it's childish content it still has tremendous appeal due to the basis of its mythology.

The Lord of the Rings, while having been written long ago also has these basic concepts so it is also very popular. It was also done very well. That is also a requirement for appeal. People will not stand for schlock film making with attempted pseudo intellectual content. We flee from such garbage or imitations. If something is too esoteric it attracts fewer people. Take 2001 a Space Odyssey or The Fountain as such examples of films with similar basic concepts but lack mass appeal because they are too heavy handed for the masses.

Now, on to the Matrix. These films serve as a prime example of melding very deep heavy concepts such as have been discussed and melding them with action, love, and characters that the masses find appealing and combining it all together into a very brilliant metaphor for the deeper mysteries of the universe.

I will mention Joseph Campbell here. He is worth reading and if you have read this far in my comments. He is the starting point for anyone who is unhappy with religion and seeks deeper answers. He is also a must read for writers and creative types alike. I fall into both categories and was introduced to him by my best friend. There are others like him out there but he was my gate to a larger understanding so starting with him is a good choice.

Whether or not LOST ends brilliantly right now is irrelevant. The show has mass appeal due to the fact that the island is in the back of our minds a micro verse metaphor for the greater mysteries of the universe.

Now how the show may end and what the secrets eventually are, are all speculation. There are however certain concepts, some of which have already been discredited, that would be lame.

To me there are only really two tiers of possible universal endings that would be satisfying for me. Now true brilliance occurs when something I have not thought of is presented and is more brilliant and fantastic than anything that has been discussed of thought of. The show could end like this. Tier one for me as possible endings will be if the explanations given for all the mysteries on the show will be answered with the island being something alluding to existence, God, and the like. I am hoping that it will end more along the lines of a 2001 type ending than some silly, ""We were all dreaming"" Pincher Martin type ending.

Tier two as far as possible endings go, and what will ultimately be satisfying but not as satisfying as my afore mentioned tire one, could be some sort of very government / illuminati / conspiracy / rouge all controlling group of humans. A kind of ""we run the planet"" or ""We invented the island"" or ""We are in Charge"" type group.

As far as I am concerned the more esoteric God / power / mysterious universe power, (for lack of better term) fundamental answers will be the most satisfying because I believe that is why the show is appealing. To give answers less than my tire one ending would be less than satisfying.

Now the show has another great vehicle that helps viewers to relate to the show and this is very obvious. These are all the characters. There is someone for everyone on LOST. No matter who you are there is a basic archetypal character there for you to relate to. The fact that Hurley saved the day in this season's finale is proof positive of this. The shows creators know this is a very basic reason why we like the show.  The esoteric stuff is there as a lure, the characters are there for us to individually relate to the lure. We all see ourselves in different aspects of each character. None of us is perfect and neither are the shows characters. Some of us do not know who we are until we are in certain situations and we decide how to act. This is played out time and again on LOST. Choice and fate. Engaging the universe or waiting for the universe to engage you. These concepts go back to Joseph Campbell and the Matrix. Are we in control or are we being controlled? As far as real actual non-TV reality goes I feel it's a bit of both. I feel that engaging the world and making choices helps fate work it's magic. While if we sit back and do nothing and play it too safe fate will take a back seat to your path in life and you will go nowhere and do nothing and be unsatisfied and not know why. LOST hits on these fundamental concepts which are with each and every one of us every day. Whether or not we believe in them matters not. They are buried in the back of our minds and we do not even know they are there. They operate in all of us just the same. If a show or film hits on them we light up and react positively and watch with baited breath till it ends.

LOST, no matter how it ends is popular for the above-mentioned reasons. I hope the show stays brilliant. I hope the show ends brilliant and I hope it leads to more works of this type. Creative works like LOST allude to what is so fascinating about the very nature of existence. I feel we, as humans tend to overlook these mysteries, which surround us every day and every second. Good works of art are there to point to those mysteries. Films mostly, and now TV somewhat, are the modern vehicles to help us see these mysteries and point our way to deeper and more satisfying lives.

Thanks for reading this.

2814449,2,B000P6YNSE,"Wow, it was quite frustrating watching Lost this season.  The series went from keeping me glued to my seat for the first two seasons, to a rather boring and inconsistent show for season three.  Starting off the first third of the season we are treated to watching ""Prison Break"" on an island.  All the captives escape with no attempted explanation of why Kate and Sawyer were so important for Michael to abduct at the end of season two (no explanation is ever given for Hurley either).  As the season progresses, no attempt is made to relate to several of the mysteries established in previous seasons.  There is no mention of the numbers, no attempted explanation of why Penny was searching for an electromagnetic charge as shown at the end of season two when the hatch exploded, and no attempted explanation of why Libby was in the mental institution with Hurley or why she gave Desmond the boat.  If you are going to allude to these occurrences at the end of a TV season, it would be a good idea to at least mention them in the subsequent season.  Furthermore, with the shocking revelation in season two that there were tail section survivors, it's rather statistically unrealistic that all but one have now been killed off.  Speaking of killing off characters, what was the point of introducing Nikki and Paulo this season, only to feature them in a half dozen episodes or so before killing them off as well?  All in all it seemed that the show was grasping at straws all season and was a pale comparison to its first two seasons.  It did have its bright points (Jacob, Locke's father appearing on the island, the connection to Swayer, finally finding out how Locke ended up in the wheel chair, and Claire's relation to Jack) but these could have made up about five really cool episodes.  Which is to say this season was full of a lot of filler.  There is the curiosity of the flash forward during the season finale.  At this point it appears that the writers have watched Star Trek: Generations way too many times to come up with a unique storyline.  While I am interested to see how the story plays out over the last three seasons that ABC has announced, I do not have high hopes for the show to regain the edge of your seat coolness of the first two seasons.",1179964800,15,2265,4.533169533169533
2814450,4,B000P6YNSE,"""Lost"" ended its second season with a bang... literally. The hatch violently imploded, and Kate, Sawyer and Jack were captured by the Others.

And so the third season is all about the repercussions of those events. It lags badly in the first half, but shocking predictions and new arrivals on the island add fresh twists -- and some stunning answers -- to the twisty, surreal storyline. But there's still plenty left for the remaining three seasons.

Kate and Sawyer are put to work, then locked up in gorilla cages, while Jack is similarly imprisoned inside an Other compound --  and finds that he is there to be a doctor to the sinister Ben, who is suffering from a spinal tumor. Jack finds himself suspended between two Others -- Ben and the mysterious Juliet --  and unsure what to do, or who to trust.

The tensions between the Others and castaways become worse as Kate and Sawyer escape, and she mounts a rescue to find Jack. But even when they get him (and the disgraced Juliet) back, things don't improve -- Juliet is secretly spying for Ben, Desmond has terrible visions of Charlie's demise, and the newly solo Locke forces Ben to reveal the island's greatest secret -- Jacob, a mysterious power that commands the Others like a god.

Suddenly a woman parachutes onto the island, and tells the castaways that a ship is only a few miles out to sea. As the Others fragment and turn against each other, the survivors decide to take them out once and for all, while Charlie and Desmond set off to infiltrate an underwater hatch. But there will be shocking losses on both sides, as Jack is faced with the most important decision he may ever make....

""Lost"" still has plenty of unsolved, unanswered mysteries, and the first half of the season is frustratingly slow and oblique. No answers, at all. But it picks up and answers questions in the second half, including who ruined Sawyer's life, who commands the Others, and the relationship between Dharma Corporation and the Others and why they protect the island so fiercely.

The writing for the first half is pretty lax (major questions are answered with non-answers like ""We watch""), but later on it tightens up considerably, with dozens of seemingly unrelated plot threads coming together in the battle with the Others. Locke's dad, Desmond's checkered past, Rousseau's daughter and Sun's pregnancy are only a few of them.

But despite all the personal drama (enough about the love triangle!), the stories are still full of gritty action (including Sayid killing a man with just his feet), and increasingly twisted flashbacks that let us see the pre-crash lives of the islanders.  These had gotten kinda stale, but Desmond's timeslip makes it seem fresher, as does the revelation of how Ben became King of the Magic Island. It answers a lot of questions too.

And there's the occasional loss. Two beloved characters bite the big one in this season, and the handling of their deaths is enough to bring tears to your eyes. But there's some humor as well -- usually provided by Hurley, who revives an old van, triumphs at Ping-pong, and even gets to be the rescuing cavalry. Not to mention the wry, solid dialogue ("" If it was Rousseau's, a massive rock would be flying at my head right now"").

Matthew Fox and Evangeline Lilly turn in some solid performances as the increasingly tormented castaways. But Dominic Monaghan and Henry Ian Cusick really rule the acting front, with their poignant struggles with love for their respective girlfriends, and the angst that Desmond's visions bring to them both. And Josh Holloway does a brilliant job, especially in the harrowing, claustrophobic episode in ""The Brig.""

The first half of ""Lost's"" third season is decidedly tepid -- not terrible, but flabby. But when it tightens up again, this tense series blossoms out. It'll be a long wait until season four.",1179878400,66,3855,4.822727272727272
2814451,5,B000P6YNSE,"Well im sure myself, and other LOST fans will be glad to know, as I'm sure any true Lostie keeps up with recent news, but I caught ""Kate's"" interview with Regis & Kelly and she confirmed they've been picked up for another three years.  Some of this season was slow, while other episodes were that wonderful edge of your seat watching that makes us realize this really is a great, unpredicitable show where anything can happen.  I'm looking forward to the Season Finale tomorrow night, will miss the 6 Month break I hear is looming, new episodes won't start again until January, but that will also enable us to have back to back new episodes next year.  For those of you who haven't caught on to LOST yet, you've got time now, pick up a copy of this great DVD, or borrow a friends first, if you do I guarantee you'll want your own.",1179792000,5,830,4.376623376623376
2814452,5,B000P6YNSE,"Ok the season isn't over yet but it has had some of the best episodes so far. It starts out slow in the beginning and Lost some fans complained about the season premiere being disapointing because not much happened. But Lost fans complain about everything really. When the show doesn't give answers...they complain...when the show does give answers...they complain that the gave too many answers. Oh plus they always complain about it's breaks. It took like 3 months off to satisfy fans that were complaining about it taking a break, coming back and then taking another break and another. Of course they still complained about the 3 month break though lol. Plus next season, the show won't be back until January, I wonder how much whining that's gonna cause.

  Anyway the season starts off at the camp of the Others with Jack locked in his own room while Sawyer and Kate are locked in seperate large cages. Jack meets Juliet who brings him food and also obviously did her research on him. She also trys hard to gain his trust and I'm still not sure if he's a fool or not for buying into it evntually. Eko also has to be rescued early in the season by Locke who mysteriously lost his voice for a brief time after th hatch explosion. Sadly though the awseome Mr. Eko dies like an episode later after Locke rescues him from Polar bears. The black fog disguised as his brother tests him and he fails the test obviously. It sucks that he dies but the scene is done sooo creepy that it's satisfying anyway. That is if you can get passed that it's sorta silly that the fog takes the form of a giant hand and picks Eko up and tosses him around violently.

  You also have some pretty mysterious but cool stuff going on with Desmond who has an odd new gift of knowing what will happen next after the hatch blast. He has visions of Charlie dieing and does everything he can to stop that from happening. You also have Jack having to decide whether or not if he wants to perform a surgery that will save Ben's life from a tumor. But since Jack is a smart guy, he realizes he can use that to his advantage. As he threatens not to save Ben if the Others don't let Kate and Sawyer go. Which is good for Sawyer since one guy that had his g/f killed by Sun  for some reason thinks that killing Sawyer will get him revenge.

  We also get some awesome stuff with Hurley finding out something shocking about the plane survivors and finding out how Locke got crippled. We also find out who it is that conned Sawyer's parents and Sawyer gets his deserved revenge. You won't shed a tear though because the guy is pretty evil and has it coming. Since what he did to Sawyer's parents was hardly the worse thing he has done. We also find out that Jack and Claire are infact related and it will be interesting to see how that plays out. You also get to know the Others a bit more as well and get a creepy scene where Ben introduces Locke to the mysterious Jacob. This season has had some truly great episodes and might've shut-up the fans who complained earlier in the season about not much happening. But I doubt it since Lost fans complain about everything lol. Anyway a lot of great stuff has happened in this season and it's not even over yet!",1179187200,17,3222,4.381909547738694
2814453,5,B000P6YNSE,"L O S T is the best show on television and probably one of the best television shows ever. This season is of course nothing short of excellent, the first six episodes are almost like a Lost mini-series, with the ending being one of the best climatic cliffhangers ever, and the seventh episode comes back with a vengeance which blasts off the rest of the season. If season one was survival and season two was the hatch then season three is exploration. And if you thought the season opener for season two was insane you haven't seen anything yet! You haven't already watched Lost on TV and are planning on waiting for the DVD and watching it straight through you are really lucky, thats the way to do it, personally I'm too addicted to do it.

8189716,5,B000P6YNSE,I love this show. Season 3 dips a bit in the middle but boats the most ingenious twist/cliffhanger in television history. If you have never seen this show and know nothing about it (especially the last scene here between Jack and Kate) then just start it now.,1526169600,,259,4.531914893617022
8189717,5,B000P6YNSE,Love this series even though a lot of questions were never answered,1525478400,,67,4.666666666666667
8189718,5,B000P6YNSE,"Some viewers complained there was a lack of action in season three and not enough solutions to the ever growing stockpile of mysteries. I strongly disagree. In fact, this season builds on what LOST did better than any other series, it delved deeper into an intellectual adventure. The rewards of this season come from character depth, quality of writing, acting, plot structure, and a mystery that won't quit. Perhaps this season (in particular) was a bit too ""smart"" for television.

I refer to this as ""The last great season of LOST"" because season four unfortunately introduces several cliche'd plot devices and characters, seemingly to add a sense of ""action"" to the series. There's a lot to enjoy about season four, but it's where LOST loses it. This season was broadcast in 2006, the same year that LOST won a Golden Globe Award for best television drama.

I honestly believe that many viewers could simply stop watching at the end of this season. The ending is mind blowing and leaves your imagination to wander and contemplate so many amazing possibilities. If you continue on to season four you're going to be hit between the eyes with comic book styled schmaltz. A truly horrible fall from the intellectual high of season three.

I highly recommend the first three seasons of LOST.",1524960000,,1291,4.885844748858448
8189719,5,B000P6YNSE,these shows are all amazing!! everyone needs to have one. looking for season 6 though,1524182400,,85,4.733333333333333
8189720,5,B000P6YNSE,"The discs come in cardboard and plastic folding contraptions. The discs play fine.

Lost was a great series, although it wasn't an original idea. The Lost Islands, The New People, and Peter Benchleys Amazon are examples of survivor type shows that came decades before Lost. The New People is one of those shows that Ive wanted to buy on disc for years, but its never been available, and its not available to watch on Amazon either.

After buying the first two seasons of Lost, and liking it, I bought the rest of the series. I laughed at the crazy Jack character and some of his silliness, but overall the series was very entertaining. The ending didn't live up to the hype. Some reviewers said that Everybody was at the church in the last episode. Not true. Mr. Echo, Libby, Lucia and a ton of other characters were not at the church. The church was mostly empty. I think the church represented Purgatory.

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520985600,,2335,5.334239130434782
