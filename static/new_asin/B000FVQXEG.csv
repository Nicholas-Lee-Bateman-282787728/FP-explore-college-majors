locations. the documentary is peppered with tips on each type of hunting and how to approach each prey in its natural habitat.
the documentary even has a small chapter about snakes and rattlesnake poison. amazing from end to end, not just for the heavy metal fan but mainly for the quality hunting footage and humane hunting methods on display. this is my only hunting DVD in my collection but the film makers team up with professional reserve managers, and know what they're talking about so it's thumbs up for me.",1397001600,,645,4.926605504587156
8127284,5,B000FVQXEG,"I've watched just about every rock DVD on the market, and I've seen more hunting programs and DVDs than I'd care to admit. This DVD is the best of either - the ultimate melding of heavy metal adrenaline and hunting adrenaline. Chester Moore is a show-stealer, and Eric Adams lives up to his metal legend reputation as they hunt a wide variety of animals. A must-have for those who were born to rock or born to hunt.",1199145600,,415,4.402597402597403

  I go to great strides to create a quality product and know that to find one that is unique, well produced and exciting is difficult. However, I have managed just that with Wild Life and Wild Times.

 Hosted by award-winning outdoor writer/author/adventurer Chester Moore and rock singer/master bowhunter education instructor Eric Adams (Manowar vocalist), this DVD covers the pursuit of nearly a dozen species ranging from eastern turkeys to bison and bull redfish.

  Each section of the DVD profiles a different species and deals with the subject matter in a fun, educational way. Moore delivers many interesting facts about the animals they pursue while Adams give great incite on the technical and safety end of outdoor pursuits.

 Best of all, Wild Life and Wild Times is done in an extremely fun and professional manner. Moore and Adams are a hoot to watch as they pursue fish and game and the humor and enthusiasm shown throughout make it worth the purchase alone.

 The production values are second to none and you never get the feeling you are watching a couple of ""good ol' boys"" set loose with camcorders. This looks and feels like the professional production that it is and I would not be surprised to see this video win some awards in the near future. The soundtrack written by Adams is also worth noting, going from the heart pounding to the atmospheric.

 If you are looking for fun ride on the wild side that captures the true essence of the outdoors, then pick up a copy of Wild Life and Wild Times. You will not be disappointed.",1152316800,2,1694,4.836805555555555

I thought this was going to be another cheesy vanity project by some rock star who had nothing to do while his band isn't touring. You know, another Ted Nugent wanna be, more crazy republicans running around with guns and such...BUT Eric Adams the singer in self proclaimed ""kings of metal"" MANOWAR is almost as good a hunter as he is a singer. We all know the guys from MANOWAR can be a little over the top sometimes but this is very well done, informative and entertaining, and there is a lot of cool music that i think Adams composed, so cheers to that!  I say buy it and watch it..it's freakin cool and one day will be a real collectors item if you can get it signed!!!",1152230400,,777,4.214765100671141
