8478661,5,B005LVEFYA,"I'm a music lover, especially 20th century, but by no means an expert on Reich's works.  My prior exposure was limited to the CD of Reich's Octet, Music for a Large Ensemble, and Violin Phase, and the CD ""Group 180"" which contains Reich's Music for Pieces of Wood.  I love both of these CDs but never ventured further into Reich's works.  Now I will !  I found this film was totally engrossing, beautiful, interesting, and uplifting.  I didn't realize just how wonderfully intellectual Reich is, he was a delight to listen to.  The visuals were amazing, e.g., the Fase dancework set to Piano Phase.  I literally had chills and goosebumps during much of the film, and several times became teary-eyed because the music was so exquisite.  I'm so glad I watched this film, I enjoyed it so much and now it's going to set me off on a new journey of musical exploration.",1387065600,,863,4.594771241830065
8478662,2,B005LVEFYA,"HIGH - concert footage of his Jewish scripture based pieces
LOW- being tired of listening to him talk at the 40 minute mark
WTF- too expensive & too short!

Illuminates the man a LITTLE. Strictly an open form discussion of the beginning and then some high points of his career. Reich mostly talks about the manner of ideation that brings him to create certain pieces, and the techniques, which is mostly less interesting than it sounds. When he talks about philosophy and music itself, he is fascinating.

The simple animations and performance footage of his work is exquisite, but there's not much of it, which is irritating. The movie itself comes in at less than an hour, and 2/3 of that is footage of Reich sitting in a chair, talking. Then there are 2 short bonus films, which are again, mostly talk. His insight about the split between german and french tonal tradition is good stuff.

Meh. The whole thing comes off as a PBS style promo for a larger series that doesn't exist. Unfortunately, I'd recommend only if you're interested in hearing Reich talk about his work, and then a rental only.

For me- I would've preferred a 3 hour documentary with a biopic, whole performance videos, and commentary by critics and fellow musicians. I think he deserves a better treatment than this!",1336694400,3,1290,4.745535714285714
