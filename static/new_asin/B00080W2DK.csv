""Truly a legend in her own time, creator of over a hundred hits, and winner of grammys galore, it's Carole King in an intimate musical portrait; a candid look at a career in, music which has spanned over two decades.  Her phenomenal `Tapestry' album made history as a world-wide bestseller selling over 15 million copies.  Because Carole King songs have a rare magic-they reach out and affect people on a personal level.  Now, for the first time in over five years she appears in concert performing some of her greatest hits!

Carole reveals the stories behind the big songs too; starting with the early days when she wrote `Locomotion' for Little Eva, `Take Good Care of my Baby for Bobby Vee, and `Up on the Roof' for The Drifters.  `Jazz Man' chases the blues away and Carole rocks to `Smackwater Jack', `One Fine Day', `Hey Girl', `A Natural Women' (a big hit with Aretha), and ""Chains' recorded by The Beatles.

Backed by a first-rate band, Carole performs many more of her own hit songs: `I Feel The Earth Move', `So Far Away', `Tapestry', and `Your Got a Friend.'

It's Carole King - One to One; pure and simple, sweet and true!"" 1982 MGM/UA; 60 minutes.",1182124800,2,1193,4.647619047619048
