Also starring is Father Gary Thomas, includes Priests from The International Catholic Association Of Exorcists.

This documentary summarizes a lot of the information that is found in the above mentioned books and educates it in a movie format maybe for those they don't want to read, I like to read and watch movies, so this movie was a plus.

Quote from movie:
""All those that do not believe in the Devil, actually help the Devil. The Devil is very happy that most do not believe he exists, because when a person does not believe in the Devil, the Devil has more freedom and the person cannot have victory over the Devil. If people no longer believe in Evil then the opposite will be true as well, people will no longer believe in God and will move further away from him. If the Devil can convince us that he does not exist, then there is no reason for us to believe in a Savior.""

Personal Experience:
Talk to an Atheist about God, and you will get laughed at, but talk about the mishaps, misfortunes, calamities of the world and they will talk forever. Suggest that the evil of the world has a source in a fallen angel and you will find more skepticism. Explain to them that the Devil attacks believers the hardest because they know he exists, and that the reason he does not attack Atheists is because what would the point be, they are already damned to Hell for their own lack of belief, but if they should ever develop a little bit of Faith, then the Devil will concentrate all of his energy on destroying their belief in it. But with continued effort for Faith, you will see Miracles, you will see that their is a malevolent force that is trying to distract you.

My turning point came when I was a hardcore Atheist, believing all mishaps came about as a result of Ignorance, bad choices, bad hygiene, bad diet, etc,.But for some oddball reason I always loved a good Exorcist movie, maybe that was God's way of keeping me close. After watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rite/dp/B004VGKXIS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rite</a>&nbsp;I was pretending to be the exorcist priest, then suddenly turned directly around (due to lack of room, small bedroom) and faced a shelf with clothes and stuff on it and said while making the Sign of the Cross outwards, ""God the Father commands you!"" At that moment the stuff on the shelf starting flying off, and onto the floor, as if something had moved really quick to get out of the way, whatever it was it moved to the left, I know because the stuff on the right went first, then everything from the left went in sequence, then to the left of the shelf is my bed, then the bed jolted, not alot but enough to make me wonder what caused it.

Another interesting fact happened, directly beneath the shelf is a AC outlet, but with nothing plugged into it, directly on the other side of that wall is another plug that is in the living room where a little table with a clock radio and lamp are plugged into. About an hour and half after all this happened in my bedroom I decided to go and turn off all the lights in the house in preparation for bed, when I got to the clock radio I noticed that the time was blinking on and off as it does when the power goes off, the time on it was 1:23 though the power in the house never went off, that got my attention. Because I remember reading this book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/An-Exorcist-Tells-His-Story/dp/0898707102/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">An Exorcist Tells His Story</a>&nbsp;(I was reading it because of some weird stuff that was happening with me and my girlfriend, and thought demons might be part of it) in the book he tells how demons can both affect and be affected by electrical phenomena. I came to the conclusion that I was under direct attack.

""The greatest lie the Devil ever got people to believe in was that he doesn't exist.""

But show a little Faith, and talk about pissing the devil off, OMG he will do everything in his power to make your life a living hell, he will try to break you, by causing whatever ill-wills to befall you. Happened to me for about a year, until I strengthened my Faith with God, it wasn't easy in the beginning, learning to pray for something I at one time despised. Feeling embarrassed and stupid for going to Church because just a year earlier I was all against it all. But the more I went, the more I prayed, the less negative feelings I had for it. Every time something negative or painful would happen I would make the Sign of the Cross over it and the weird pains in my legs would cease and dark places in my house would no longer scare me. The Sign of the Cross has been my Armor against the Evil that has been subduing me. I recommend reading&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sign-of-the-Cross/dp/1933184973/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sign of the Cross</a>&nbsp;for a better understanding of this protection.

Also educating your local Parish Priest about this will be helpful for him if he ever does encounter a supernatural situation. This video will show you what to look for and what usually causes demonic possessions.",1380412800,3,5762,5.247557003257329

4716847,1,B005KCIOFG,"I was really looking forward to this documentary especially since the one review that it has was 5 stars, however, it begins with a very low budget scene that does not relate to the documentary very well. The documentary was of an average quality -- nothing really new within the interviews. I believe that their was a lot of potential for this documentary since it is based on such an interesting subject, however, the documentary falls very short and does not provide any significant speakers or statements.",1321747200,4,509,4.862068965517241
