7697605,5,B01D5MPOZA,"Darryl (Alex Williamson) and Joel (Jim Jefferies) work at the telephone exchange during the zombie apocalypse. They are soon joined by their boss Roy (Greg Fleet) and his daughter Emma (Adele Vuko). Joel and Darryl had recently killed Roy's wife and Darryl spends the whole film attempting to break the news to Roy. They are later joined by two apprentices (Matthew Popp, Andy Trieu ) one of which is the boyfriend of Emma and not liked by her dad.

This is an Australian comedy-horror. Our heroes are nonchalant about the zombie issue and care more about trivial aspects in comparison. There is plenty of blood and guts. Most of the humor consists of one liners that work.

7697613,3,B01D5MPOZA,"Purchased this locally. It was OK but nothing special. It was more of an ""amusedy"" (not copyrighted or likely to catch on) rather than a comedy. The acting was good. I was bored the first half of the movie and didn't even see anything to grin about much less laugh--Yeah, the distracted driver of the lawn mower doesn't see the overly large zombie lying in the road and runs him over unawares--totally predictable, ho-hum. Things pick up in the second half but nothing for a good laugh, just some amusement. A lot of the jokes were older than the hills (gay accusations/denials; people expecting the Asian guy to be a Kung Fu master; etc.). I almost laughed during the scene where the father, believing himself to be infected, tries to figure out to kill himself  with a shotgun (he gets interrupted). In this movie, zombies are not totally brain dead: they have an occasional flash of memory (like what an electronic key card is for) and occasionally problem solve. Paint ball guns are apparently useful against zombies, especially if you shoot them in the eye or balls. There is a short scene when the Australian army shows up to save them--all two of them (does their Army really use bolt-action rifles?). That ends badly for the soldiers--as expected. And that is the problem. Predicting the punch lines or what is going to happen takes the fun out of it. On that score the movie is as brain dead as the zombies.",1470528000,,1416,4.6414342629482075

7697615,5,B01D5MPOZA,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

I never tire of seeing what comedic mayhem filmmakers can think up for horror comedies.  And what better source material to use than one of my favorite horror staples, a zombie apocalypse.  Ive seen many U.S. and British zombie comedies, or zom-coms, however Ive never seen one from Australia.  Come to think of it, I don't think Ive seen any horror comedies from Down Under, so ME AND MY MATES VS. THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE is a real treat for many reasons.

Ill state this right up front:  ME AND MY MATES VS. THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE is a blast, and I highly recommend giving it a look.  If you like films like SHAUN OF THE DEAD and COOTIES, then this one is right up your alley.  Chocked full of top-notch humor and great gore, this is one zom-com youll want to revisit again and again.

ME AND MY MATES VS. THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE is shot well and looks great onscreen.  The production value appears high, and the crew seems to have used their budget well.  The writing is crisp and funny.  And despite the vague plot synopsis above, the film offers more than enough material to keep viewers enthralled and laughing for 90 minutes.

The acting in ME AND MY MATES VS. THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE is very good, with a riotous cast that includes comedians Jim Jefferies, Alex Williamson, and Greg Fleet, as well as the beautiful Adele Vuko and the talented Matt Popp.  The whole cast does a great job with their roles, and each plays off the other like theyve been friends for years.

The special effects are excellent, and theres plenty of carnage to keep even the staunchest of gore-hounds happy.  I am particularly impressed with how gruesome and realistic the disembowelment scenes are.  When the zombies start munching on someone, the audience gets a face-full of entrails and guts.  The zombies look good for the most part as well, however a few of the background walkers are only slightly made up, which drew my eye away from the action in the scene.  This isn't really a negative, but more of an observation.

The humor in the film is plentiful, and there are few scenes that do not contain some form of gag or comedic crack.  I don't think Ive laughed this hard at a zombie comedy since SHAUN OF THE DEAD.  As such, ME AND MY MATES VS. THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE is a big win for me, and fans of horror comedies will definitely want to give this film a chance.  Im sure glad I did.",1465776000,4,2445,4.469525959367946
8754975,3,B01D5MPOZA,Wow! Band promo at the beginning was annoying. Typical zombie fare but the characters were quite bizarre -- bizarre enough to make one squeamish realising these were the survivors.  I got it for Jefferies but he didn't last very long. Rather amateurish and I didn't need to see somebody's nads. Ending was sort of a bummer which left the viewer hanging.,1522627200,,353,4.786885245901639
8754976,4,B01D5MPOZA,"This movie proves that a cool accent, sex, and sarcasm can make am eh zombie movie a decent flick. This is a pretty good B movie along the lines of  the zombie apocalyptic style of Shawn of the dead but low budget. The zombie makeup was crappy but good film and editing quality, basic plot but  the characters and the jokes kept the story interesting. Definitely worth watching to kill some time and a few laughs, cool movie.",1508112000,,425,4.435897435897436
8754977,5,B01D5MPOZA,"We need to see more of Greg Fleet. Great performance, the Aussie patois was quite amusing, too. The film didn't follow the standard zombie movie plot exactly, but was close. There was just enough variance to make it enjoyable. Wish they'd do another movie with this cast. It was so much more enjoyable watching people that seemed relatable as opposed to the standard Hollywood lineup.",1508112000,,384,4.923076923076923

8754979,3,B01D5MPOZA,"There are some actual laughs in this film from Australia which includes some stand-up comedians in its cast, so the good news is that's it's not a complete waste of time the way many low budget zombie movies, comic or serious, can be. On the other hand it's not much of a zombie movie, which throws the whole thing off. The zombies are mostly a plot device that sets up a small cast in a single location to get into a few comic situations, but mostly engage in fast dialog and tossing out one-liners to each other.

Two telecom workers meet at an abandoned telephone exchange station seeking shelter from the zombie apocalypse which has suddenly descended on Australia. They are soon joined by their boss and his sexy daughter and after a while by her boyfriend and his best friend. Their plan is to hole up there and use the equipment to contact the military to come rescue them. They manage to bring fairly much beer to survive on. More and more zombies can be seen gathering outside through the windows (I assume they're on the second floor).

The big problem is with tone. From the get go nobody seems particularly frightened or freaked out about what's going on. Its all very casual as they arrive and it never feels like anyone feels any fear or terror. They mostly joke around, two of the young men flirt with the girl and one of them will do anything to get on the boss's cricket team. The zombies are good as far as the makeup goes, but they're mostly kept out of the picture until something needs to happen. They can be lethal but mostly don't matter. They're slow-type zombies and oddly intelligent, like figuring out how to get in the front door using a key card (which almost disqualifies them as zombies). The really great zombie comedies, for me only Shaun of the Dead, Zombieland and Scout's Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse are genuine horror movies with a lot of humor in them and are able to maintain a real sense of tension.

Popular Australian comic Jim Jeffries is listed as the star but is probably only in this film as a favor to a cast member, probably director-writer Declan Shrubb. In any case he's not really in the film very long. Alex Williamson is funniest as clueless stoner Darryl and Greg Fleet as tough boss Roy is a good foil for him. Everyone here actually does a good job with their roles but those roles are very underwritten so they're mostly ""types"" - hot girl, Asian guy, blond jock, etc. There are a few extras and a few moments outside the small set but not enough to really open up a film with such a small budget.

The one-liners are funny and so are many of the jokes, especially the Australian jokes. But it's more comedy sketch than zombie film so be sure that's what you're in the mood for.",1507161600,3,2738,4.4590818363273454
