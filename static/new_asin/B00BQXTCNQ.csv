5668071,4,B00BQXTCNQ,"""The Politicians Wife"" held my interest and I was eager to see each episode. Flora, the wife of the politician Duncan Matlock, was played by Juliet Stevenson (who was superb in the role). Although Duncan deserved everything that happened to him in the end, Flora was not a sympathetic character for me because of her outward support, while doing everything she could to undermine him. I could understand her anger and her concern for the Party and her interest in the welfare of the constituents but I don't know how she could continue to stay with Duncan and act the loving wife while persuading Sir Donald to turn against him, this among other of her plots and plans. Duncan's life was totally centered around himself; not only did he use his oratory and twisting of the facts to advance himself,but his lack of interest in his young son was dreadful, he had no concern for him and no idea of what the child was suffering.

A few scenes were definitely not suitable for children or young teens, although they could benefit from observing the hypocrisy of many politicians.

I recommend this as a most interesting look at a politician whose ambition and self seeking behavior and disregard for others was brought out into the open.",1372204800,,1232,4.725581395348837

It's a rerelease with benefits.

Three hours, and my wife and I said at the same time, ""5 stars.""
Powerful story. Commanding performances by Juliet Stevenson (Flora) who bares all, Minnie Driver (Jennifer) who makes a convincing hooker, and Trevor Eve (Duncan) a politician you can detest.

Episode 1: Stand by Him
Flora Matlock is the Minister of Family Affairs wife, subservient. Don't cross her as hubby did. She bites back. Duncan Matlock should have recognized this prior to his 'hanky-panky' ways. The affair parallels scandals of Washington politicians--even Presidents. Jennifer, the `escort' babe is tabloid news. Can? Should? Flora ""Stand by her man?"" Watch Duncan's pathetic `We're a team' plea. What's the truth? An informant surfaces.

2 Echo Chamber
Flora plays tapes of erotic conversations between her cheating hubby and liaison tart. She gets supplied photos. Conversations and Stevenson nudity are unrated, but not for kids. Flora's disgust turns to revenge. 3 cheers for Flora.

3 Body Politics
It's survival of the fittest after a political bloody battle. A woman's-day-out finale. I didn't see the ending coming. Well done. You see Flora bloom within her own person in this film. Not really a women's lib film as it is poetic justice.

This story has won many awards including an International Emmy and BAFTA.",1366848000,,1817,5.05685618729097
5668073,4,B00BQXTCNQ,"Trevor Eve as the slimy Tory (Conservative party) politician and Juliet Stevenson as the naive wife. When she finds out about his affair, she conspires to ruin his career. All of the men in her life seem to be plotting against her (including her own father), but she succeeds regardless.

Trevor Eve seems to always get the ""bad guy"" roles (with the exception of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Framed/dp/B0047CTO90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Framed</a>, and even there he started out as a not sympathetic character). One finds it easy to dislike him, and it's just as easy to dislike his long-suffering wife. You'll find yourself sympathizing with the poor children of the marriage.

This drama is nowhere near as frothy as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Amazing-Mrs-Pritchard/dp/B000MV8Z9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Amazing Mrs Pritchard</a>, but don't let that stop you from enjoying it.

Watch for ""The Politician's Husband"", which airs in the UK in April 2013, and we hopefully will see it here in the USA before too long. The characters are not the same, but the series author is.",1366243200,3,1182,6.108433734939759

5668076,5,B00BQXTCNQ,This one may be fiction but we've seen true life philandering politicians and even hoped we'd see some retaliation from the wife.  This wife suffers meekly initially but gathers her wits as the handlers try to control her.,1408579200,,222,4.842105263157895
5668077,5,B00BQXTCNQ,"The Brits do this type of drama so well. I enjoyed it immensely and watched the entire presentation in one sitting. The writing and characterization is superb and casting was perfect. Before it was over, I saw the actors playing out a drama that was so realistic and true to life. As the levels of betrayal unfold we learn so many details that might have destroyed a lesser lady but Flora pulls off her answer to Duncan's deception by plotting the perfect revenge. After the details of Duncan's ""other life"" become known to Flora, I could envision her thoughts and reactions to each lie as the lies accumulated. The way she executes her plan is brilliant! You could almost see the wheels in her mind turning as knowledge comes to her piece by piece. Juliet Stephenson's portrayal of Flora is outstanding. Duncan was played to perfection by Trevor Eve as he underestimates his wife and leads his double life. I think the underlying theme of this drama is never, ever think you know another person so well that you can't be fooled. I recommend this with five stars but I don't have to actually see sexual relations to take place as these actions can be alluded to without the visuals.",1399680000,2,1182,4.633333333333334
5668078,4,B00BQXTCNQ,"How many times have news headlines featured sex scandals involving high level politicians? Exactly. Too many to count. That makes THE POLITICIANS WIFE timely, important and relevant.

While not entirely successful due to an at times obvious anti-Conservative bias, this superb production takes a familiar scenario and turns it on its ear. By focusing on the wronged wifes perspective, writer Paula Milne injects new life into what could have been a heavy-handed tirade against the abuses of power.

Walking a fine line between condemning blatant hypocrisy and asserting the producers apparent political views, THE POLITICIANS WIFE works best when it takes you inside the mind and swirling emotions of Juliet Stevensons Flora. Her emotional breakdown is both heart-breaking and fascinating and her subsequent course of action (read Revenge) is alternately satisfying, disastrous and unexpectedly life-changing. Floras thoroughly rotten adulterer husband is made palatable simply by being played by Trevor Eve, a likeable actor who is unafraid to take tremendous risks with this role. One wonders how often he was recognized in public after the initial broadcast and told off, in no uncertain terms, by some formerly adoring fan (it happens).

Probably the most remarkable aspect of THE POLITICIANS WIFE is how it analyzes the whole concept of Betrayal. There are other themes as well, including hypocrisy, honour, morality, etc. But the anatomy of betrayal has rarely been better portrayed. Eves Duncan is a man so wholly convinced of his own destiny that his sense of entitlement is astounding. He relies so completely on his wife (she even cuts his toenails for him when hes in the bath) and yet his reprehensible act of betrayal is somehow justified in his own mind.

The series then asks the question when is revenge justified? And at what cost? The transformative power of betrayal is examined with a surgeons precision, using a literary scalpel to peel away the layers of humanity that are sacrificed when individuals become desensitized to commitment, loyalty and dedication, (whether to another individual or to a cause, i.e. the Party).

The outcome of THE POLITICIANS WIFE may shock as well as (or instead of) satisfy. Along the way there is a positively brilliant cliffhanger at the end of episode two which illustrates why Duncan is such a successful politician. You won't see it coming. Nor are you likely to guess the conclusion to this superior drama.

As mentioned, the only reservation this reviewer has is the implication that hypocrisy and corruption are limited to the political party representing conservative values. There exists in the arts world a proclivity for liberalism that is often very much at odds with traditional values. When this spills over into obvious bias it contradicts the supposed fair way of thinking many artists proclaim. Were this aspect trimmed from THE POLITICIANS WIFE the film would be in a much better place to express moral outrage. Hypocrisy and betrayal are unfortunate traits of human nature, encouraged by power and privilege. They are not specific to any political idealogy or professed moral world view. The news headlines are proof of that.",1397433600,2,3198,5.224171539961014

5668082,5,B00BQXTCNQ,Seen this serie when first aired although not entirely.  Some violence but deals with family matters in an acceptable manner for viewers.

5668083,5,B00BQXTCNQ,"My wife is a BIG fan of The Good Wife and I suspected after reading up on the plot that this was likely the inspiration for the CBS series The Good Wife.  Watching reminded us that nothing much has changed since the Boleyn days and all the shenanigans that go on in the royal quarters,  My wife is very astute about these matters and early in the first episode had surmised the outcome and that is to be expected, she is a clinical psychologist.  It's a good story and even though Minnie Driver was a hit around this time with Good Will Hunting, she was really a minor player in this drama.",1373155200,,590,4.25

Just a note for families: there is nudity, sexual situations and conversations that would be inappropriate for children.

8572941,5,B00BQXTCNQ,"In 1985, in Stratford, I saw Juliet Stevenson on stage for the first time as Cressida, in Shakespeare's ""Troilus and Cressida.""  Her Troilus was Anton Lesser (and Alan Rickman was Achilles!).  It's a pleasure to see Lesser and Stevenson together again in this satisfying 3-part drama from 1995.  It runs about 190 minutes -- once you start, you'll want to see it through.  Stevenson is Flora Matlock, whose husband Duncan (Trevor Eve) is the rising star of the Conservative Party and Minister of the Family.  When it has been revealed that Duncan is having an affair (with an ex-""escort"" played by Minnie Driver), the Party wants the wagons circled and wants Flora and the children to stand up for Duncan -- which they do.  But the more Flora learns about the extent of Duncan's affair (there are tapes!!), the more she realizes that she is being used, not only by Duncan but by the Establishment (which included her father!) of a Party whose policies she doesn't really like, especially those relating to poor and disadvantaged families.  She resolves to take action, and she finds some surprising allies -- in the interest of not spoiling a very well-wrought plot, I'll say no more, except that it all comes to a very satisfying conclusion.

The political angle means that Flora's actions involve reasons that go beyond ""revenge,"" but these actions mean that she has to be become deceptive to a considerable degree.  Having been the victim of deception, she's clearly not always comfortable with herself, and in expressing this discomfort, in gesture and expression (for it's not talked about), Juliet Stevenson is superb.  She is always affecting when she plays morally serious people in difficult situations, and she plays a deceiver here without losing our sympathy.  Duncan Eve is excellent as her ambitious and shallow husband, Ian Bannen, who is always good to watch, is marvelous as the Conservative Chief Whip, and Anton Lesser is affecting and restrained as Duncan Matlock's chief aide.  Only with Mrs Clegg (Diana Fairfax), a force in Duncan's constituency organization, do we come near a stereotype.  The young Minnie Driver is a forceful femme fatale.  The general setting is post-Thatcher Britain.  The Prime Minister -- often referred to but never seen -- should be assumed to be John Major, and one gets the impression that the Establishment powers manipulate him as they try to manipulate Flora for damage control.  The script is fine, even the minor characters are well cast, but it's mainly Juliet Stevenson's show.  Her ability to evoke a pained inner life is really quite wonderful.  See and enjoy.",1459036800,,2620,4.997695852534562

8572944,5,B00BQXTCNQ,"This is possibly the best suspense film since The Sting.  Its exceptionally well plotted story of betrayal and revenge.

8572945,5,B00BQXTCNQ,"Absolutely loved this three-part series when it aired on UK's Channel 4 in 1995 and was delighted to find it from Acorn at well over half the price of the PBS dvd (which is also available from Amazon Prime.)  This Acorn dvd has the complete UK broadcast edition of 195 minutes not the shortened version PBS showed on Masterpiece Theatre.  It has a 'play all' feature, SDH subtitles and a bonus background essay by the author, Paula Milne.
  Juliet Stevenson is perfectly cast as the wronged wife and the talented Trevor Eve ('Kidnap and Ransom', 'Waking. The Dead') is a superb slimy politician.  It's easy to see why this won both the BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television Arts) and the International Emmy awards for best drama.  It's as relevant today as it was 20 years ago and, unfortunately, will be probably be credible 20 years from now.
  This is one series not to be missed; it's on par with both the UK and US 'House of Cards' and the BBC's 2013 'The Politician's Husband' (also written by Paula Milne and starring David Tennant and Emily Watson.)",1429833600,,1065,4.627659574468085
