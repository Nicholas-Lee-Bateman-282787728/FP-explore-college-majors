1218946,5,B00000I1PT,"Out of the many step tapes that I have done this one really works you hard.  It is well-organized, easy to follow and uses weights while stepping to get the fastest, most complete workout.",947030400,6,188,4.529411764705882
1218947,5,B00000I1PT,Gilad is a master!  He makes it enjoyable to exercise.  This step workout has do-able choreography and keeps your heart rate up for 40 minutes.  The location is beautiful and Gilad and his crew aren't hard to look at either!  They look like they're having fun so it makes you want to enjoy your  workout as well.  It has a tight and compact 6 minute ab workout that is  effective and the cool down and warm up are just the right amount of time -  not too long.  Overall Gilad does an excellent job!,943056000,28,498,4.212765957446808
1218958,5,B00000I1PT,"I love this video.  Gilad is a wonderful instructor.  He starts with a really good warm-up.  Then the aerobics are split into four, ten minute sessions.  It's easy to follow.  There are no intricate steps that are hard to keep up with.  There is also a six minute ab routine at the end.  It's a great fat burning workout with a great background to boot!",1047513600,4,353,4.338461538461538
1218959,5,B00000I1PT,"Quite honestly, I am new to Gilad videos and I steered away from them because after seeing his show a few times, I figured, ""How can I get a good workout doing this if I have to stay in that little black circle?"" Well, there are no black circles in this one, and I ended up sweating my hiney off. Now, admittedly, I am a VERY picky consumer when it comes to exercise videos. After using videos for almost 6 years (workout schedule is 5 days per week), I like to vary my workout and I find that I need to be challenged at this stage. Using my heart monitor, I found that I was at the low end of my target range half way during the warm up and right at the high end on the dot (150 bpm) within the first ten minutes of the actual workout. Also, I stink at sticking to the stretches at the end (to save a measly 5 minutes!), but the stretches Gilad does are very effective. Also, he doesn't include the warm up & cool down as total workout time. As a seasoned pro, I would highly recommend this workout.",1037836800,9,1000,4.055555555555555
1218960,5,B00000I1PT,"This starts out so simple and easy that I was concerned at first that it wouldn't be an effective workout. Not so with Gilad--by the time it's over you're drenched and breathing hard (always a good sign). The music is drab but it picks up at the end, just when you need a motivating and upbeat rhythm. Plus if you get bored you can watch the people on the beach in the background.",1034467200,,380,4.219178082191781
1218961,5,B00000I1PT,"I am not that coordinated, so I tend to shy away from step routines, but after reading other reviews that good instruction is given, I gave it a try.  It's true, Gilad gives you plenty of advance notice as to what move he is going to do next, and there are not a lot of tricky moves.  Another reviewer did mention repetitiveness, which I appreciated.  It is repetitive in that the same standard step moves are used in a cycle.  I didn't feel like I was working that hard, yet I did work up a good sweat.",1030665600,4,503,4.154639175257732
1218962,5,B00000I1PT,"I have purchased many workout videos but this one is my favorite. If you want to lose weight this tape is definitely going to help you. I started exercising with it like a month ago and even though I have not been on any diets, I have lost 10 pounds and my body looks incredibly different. You'll have a lot of fun by following this step workout video.",1030320000,3,352,4.1911764705882355
1218963,4,B00000I1PT,"I enjoy step aerobics and found I had a decent workout with Gilad Step Aerobics.  I did sweat, and I felt winded as well.  I missed a few of Gilad's cues, but overall he's pretty easy to follow.  He uses simple steps that combine together for a fairly entertaining workout.  You can tell it's an early 90's video by the clothing and hair styles.  The music wasn't the greatest, but it becomes almost muted after awhile.  There are few, if any, definite breaks for water, but the tape is divided into segments (and given an estimated length of time).  Gilad does not really provide any suggestions for increasing or decreasing the pace of the workout.  Overall, I feel the Gilad video is a good (not great) workout and would recommend Gilad if you are in the mood for some decent sweating.",1029628800,,788,4.539007092198582
1218964,5,B00000I1PT,"I love this workout! It is challenging yet easy to follow.  You don't spend your time watching the next move and trying to figure out how to do it.  His cuing is great and I love his voice which is a plus because it makes it that much easier to do the workout. And you all know what I mean here, sometimes you get one of those trainers and you just want to choke them.  Gilad is a breath of fresh air, which brings me to the beach setting for the workout.  Gotta love working out at the beach and right now the closest I can get to that is this video! The ab segment is a definite bonus!  If you're looking for a great step workout, look no farther.",1028246400,7,649,3.9615384615384617
1218965,5,B00000I1PT,"but since I LOVE step routines, I thought I'd give it a try.  I LOVE IT!!  It is SO much fun and truly a serious workout!  Gilad is SO good at instructions - even thought the first time through I stayed confused.  He comments that this is both a body AND mind workout and that's the TRUTH!!",1027900800,2,290,4.035087719298246
1218966,4,B00000I1PT,Not bad...not dancy at all and gets the job done. I gave it a 4 though because the third sequence is sooooo repetitive. About 100 turn steps in a row..then 50 over the tops...zzzzzz,1027036800,,181,4.352941176470588
1218967,3,B00000I1PT,"Routines are oddly put together in unusual ""segments"" that, at times, take too much thought to figure out.  If you can get past the ""eighties"" attire(tights included), it's a good workout with good cues.",1023753600,,203,4.970588235294118
1218978,5,B00000I1PT,"I love this video..it is a great workout (I can do the whole tape now), and it never gets boring.. nice workout for beginners and intermediates..you can do only segment one, add two if you want (or can) and onward to segment three..his abs workout is good and his cool down is good.....he is fun, makes me laugh and, thank goodness, he doesn't chatter .. what more to say except that: he is not hard to look at and his accent is cute!!",1016841600,4,435,4.253012048192771
1218979,5,B00000I1PT,"This is my first work-out video and I love it.
Gilad is a great a leader and he has a nice clear voice.
The explanation of the moves by Gilad is very easy to follow if you're foreign (I'm Dutch).
Also the moves are great. He takes time so you can get used to all the different moves and at the end he puts them all together.
I think it is also very important that the moves are recorded well on the film so you can clearly see how the steps must be made. That's O.K. too !!!
I can recommend this video to everyone who is a starter.
Come on ... get the move !!!",1015891200,,560,3.836206896551724
1218980,5,B00000I1PT,This is by far my favorite workout video! Good warm up - great 40 minute cardio and good abs and cool down.  The cardio is broken up into three sections.  Gilad teaches each section throroughly and then combines them all.  You can really get a GREAT workout with this tape.  Gilad is easy to understand.  He  tells you what the next move is going to be before the actual move.  The scenery is gorgeous.  The music is so/so - doesn't really movitate you - just background music.,1006905600,10,477,4.402298850574713
1218981,4,B00000I1PT,I have been doing step workouts for the last 9 months.  This tape is fun and moves fast.  The sequences are easy to follow and you get a good cardio-workout.  The arm movements are fun and the location can't be beat.,1006387200,4,216,4.219512195121951
1218982,2,B00000I1PT,I bought this video mainly because of the great customer reviews. I am somewhat disappointed in this video. Okay I gave it two stars because the video is filmed in Waikiki. But the actual exercise is pretty boring. If your like me and you enjoy variety in an exercise than this is not for you. Gilad repeats the same things over and over again changing the routine about a few times during the entire workout. It had me wondering when is it gonna finish? And the ab workout wasn't all that great either. You know I should actually have given this 1 star. Because I bought and did it once and don't plan to do it again.,999820800,11,618,4.2905982905982905
1218983,5,B00000I1PT,"This is a basic no nonsense step workout. He does 10 minutes warmup and cool down, three 10-minute sets and a 10-minute set where he puts it all together. He gets with it, and adds a little jumping, but basically is a low impact type of workout. He does enough repetition that anyone can get the moves even if you are a beginner. Though he doesn't suggest it, one can do this workout on the floor and work your way up to the steps. He adds in arms, but again the moves aren't confusing. He's enthusiastic and upbeat throughout. A great tape for beginners and those returning to step.",998438400,,583,4.3577981651376145
1218984,5,B00000I1PT,"I used to workout to Gilad's show when I was in college so when I saw this video I ordered it right away.  I LOVE it. He is motivating but still low-key (so there is no need to worry about hearing someone yell whoop-whoop at you first thing in the morning!).  If you have a limited amount of space, but like to sweat, this video will be perfect for you.",997833600,2,353,4.0285714285714285
1218985,1,B00000I1PT,"Along with ALL the ineffective Jane Fonda videos, and ALL the dangerous Reebok videos, this humm drumm boring video should have never been made. Gilad seems lethargic the entire time, not to mention his impaired cueing ability. Stick to ""The Firm"" series for very diversified and interesting workouts under very appealing visual formats.  ""The Firm"" is THE way to go!  I've spent way too much money on workout videos made by everyone from Moses to President Bush, and The Firm has got em' all beat by far.  Be sure you have the extra equipment needed for any given tape (i.e. a step, a box for leg work, weights for arm work, etc...) if not, just buy the tapes that require no additional equipment.  If you don't like the music on any of the tapes, (it's low, not dated and easy on the ears) don't let that stop you.  It's all about a certain rhythm and beat you need.  You'll find that some of your favorite music will have the necessary rhythm and beat - so, just mute the TV, and pump up your own tunes while you move that body!!  Try ""The Firm"" series, borrow a friend's to start, but I'm sure you'll soon want several of your own.  I've continued to get excellent results from these tapes for over 10 years.  If I get lazy and loose some firmness, I'll start on my Firm tapes for a week or two. I then loose the weight, and get my firmness back in no time!  I wish you all the best.",997401600,6,1387,4.3
1218986,5,B00000I1PT,"I hadn't done step in a couple of years.  I bought this tape wanting to get back into it.  Gilad is great!  He really explains what to do without being insulting.  He gives compliments the whole time and even though you know he can't really see you, it is still motivating.  His ""assistants"" are very accurate in doing everything exactly as he does.  I'm really enjoying this tape!!  I definitely recommend it for anyone with OR without step experience.  I especially recommend it for people like me--looking to get the exercise in their own home!",996796800,,547,4.684210526315789
1218987,5,B00000I1PT,"If you're looking for a sweaty, good workout, this one is for you.  Gilad is a great instructor, I love his moves.  He brings you through a good step aerobic exercise then works out your abs.  He's easy to follow and really makes you workout.  If your into step aerobics you won't be sorry purchasing this tape.",991267200,10,311,4.4035087719298245
1218997,5,B00000I1PT,"I love this video!  When I first started it took me about 2 workouts to get comfortable, and now I just go to work.  What I love about it the most is that you start working out from the begining.  Try it, I guarantee you will enjoy this work out.",990057600,3,246,3.88
1218998,5,B00000I1PT,"This is the best step tape I own. It goes the right amount of time (40 minutes stepping), the steps aren't complicated and my heartbeat gets going. Out of all my videos, I use this one the most.",985478400,,194,4.131578947368421
1218999,5,B00000I1PT,"I recently purchased this step tape and did it after not doing step for a few years - it is GREAT!  Great warm up, then Gilad shows three different combinations and then puts all the combinations together (at the end).  The first combo is fairly easy and I thought, for just a minute, that the tape would not be fast and fun.  I was wrong!  The second combo was more complex and increased my heart rate.  The third combo was great -even more complex and invigorating.  Gilad really explains the moves well before the move and when he combines all the combos, he remembers to tell what the next sequence will be.
The scenery is beautiful and the music is invigorating and motivating without being irritating.  You can still hear Gilad over the music.  It's an awesome tape!  When I got done, I was DRIPPING with sweat and can't wait to do it again!",984528000,21,847,4.4480519480519485
1219000,5,B00000I1PT,"I have done step aerobics for years and found this recent addition to my collection of tapes to be a good one. At first, I thought it was a bit too easy but by the time I got to the end I was working very hard.  Gilad's direction is good, the steps repeat many times, although for a beginner it may be hard to follow the first few times. Behind the buff bodies of the instructors is a fun, moderately difficult workout.",983318400,,419,4.109756097560975
1219001,5,B00000I1PT,"I just used this tape for the first time and am going to order one for a friend and another as a backup in case this one breaks!  What a great tape!  Gilad is motivating, his cueing is excellent, it builds into a very high intensity work out when adding the power hops, and I found it very easy to follow. If you are looking for a great step workout look no more.  I am definitely going to purchase more of Gilad's tapes.  I find Kathy Smith's cuing frustrating at times, I like Denise Austin but the tapes are a bit short for when I really want an hour workout-this is pretty perfect.  I don't think you'll be disappointed if you buy this one-a true bargain!",980899200,,659,4.198412698412699
1219002,5,B00000I1PT,"This was my first video from Gilad. I've been in step classes off and on for 2 and a half years now.  Finally I got sick of going out to the gym and got my own step, and this video.  I really like this video because its not hard to follow, very simple steps, but it gets you sweating.  When I first tryed it I was so out of breath about my fifth time, I found it just as affective, but much easier.  I'll give you a good tip, like Gilad says, choose a lower step when you are first begining the video, no matter how long you have been practicing step. I started to high, and it made the video hard to follow.  I started on 8 inches.  The backround in the video is very pretty. I use this video every day,it is definantly a keeper!  iTs fun, effective, easy to follow, and Gilad is very motivating!",978393600,,797,4.006329113924051
1219003,5,B00000I1PT,"i am not a big fan of home exercise tapes.  the instructors tend to be a bit cheesy.  at times gilad makes me laugh but he keeps me motivated throughout the entire video.  this is a great workout.  the abs are a huge  bonus.  the beat of the music makes it really easy to keep in step,  although some of the jingles can stay with you for a few days and keep you  up at night sometimes.  the moves used on the step really get your heart  going, are pretty easy to get down, and makes you feel like you are really  working.  i can really tell a difference in my calves, stomach, and arms.  there are no weights involved but i think the constant involvement and  extra movements of your arms throughout the workout help to build muscle  and tone them.  i enjoy working out with this video, and dare i say,  actually have fun doing it.  i was even able to tell a difference within  the first week and i really need that immediate gratifaction to keep  motivated. i am now a huge gilad fan and just placed an order for another  one of his tapes.  i think he is the one i will stick with.",957830400,79,1082,4.100961538461538
1219004,5,B00000I1PT,"I LOVE this video. It is challenging and fun !  I do it on an 8 inch step, so I get quite a workout. I love Gilad. He is fun, and informative and very motivating.  I never did floor work (abdominals, hips, thighs, etc) until I  started doing his videos. I have almost everyone of his videos, but this  and Step and Tone workout are my favorites.",948758400,3,345,4.104477611940299
7909484,5,B00000I1PT,I like his workouts,1522108800,,19,4.0
7909485,3,B00000I1PT,"not Just what I wanted
not just how I wanted it
I would not recommend it to everyone
not in perfect condition I love it",1357171200,,119,3.8
7909486,4,B00000I1PT,"This is the only video I have by Gilad, but it's a good one!  It is set of Waikiki Beach in Hawaii, overlooking the ocean.  Gilad is joined by 2 male and 2 female exercisers. First you will warm up and stretch then proceed into 40 minutes of step aerobics.  There are 4 step segments, 3 of them with simple combinations with basic step moves such as step taps, knee lifts, repeaters, V steps, turn steps, over the tops, all while incorporating simple arm movements.  Each of the segments gradually becomes a little more intense, plus Gilad reminds you to add power moves if you want to bump things up a little.  The final segment you will go through all the combinations in the previous three segments four or five times, by the time you are done you have definitely worked and will be feeling great.  The steps and routines are easy to catch on to, those who are looking for complex routines and choreography will not find this video challenging.  After the aerobics, you will cool down and move into a short abs segment, then it's on to the final stretch.

Gilad is a likeable instructor, he is motivating and encourages you to keep going, and he seems to be having a good time along with his fellow exercisers.  This video is best for beginner/intermediate level exercisers.  I am an intermediate exerciser and always get a good workout with this video.  Plus living in MN, this is a nice one to pull out on those cold and snowy days and I can imagine I am in a warmer climate.  Recommended for those who like simple, basic step routines.",1113091200,6,1541,4.483870967741935
7909487,5,B00000I1PT,"This is a fun aerobic video geared towards a beginner to intermediate level.  The warm-up was brief, and followed by a 40 minute aerobic section.  The aerobic section is actually divided into 4 different segments, where the last segment is simply a combination of all the previous segments.  I liked this cardio portion because it didn't include any lunges and dips which are hard on my knees and joints.  Although it is not a very difficult cardio section, it still got my heart rate up.  After the aerobics is a very brief abs section which I thought was pretty good.  The cool-down was very short too.  All in all, a great video if you don't want something so difficult.
 I find tapes like Karen Voight's Energy Sprint and Kathy Smith's Great Buns and Thighs much more effective and challenging, but they also are VERY hard on my knees because there are sooo many lunges.  Gilad's video is much less strenuous on your joints.",1088121600,5,928,4.644171779141105
7909488,2,B00000I1PT,"Gilad has a decent enough step work out, but his inane comments and the relentless polka music on Waikiki Beach is aggravating.  If you want a serious step workout, try something by Gin Miller or Keli Roberts instead.",1054771200,5,217,4.7105263157894735
7909489,5,B00000I1PT,"As most of the other reviewers mentioned, this tape starts off a little slow, but by the end, you're dripping in sweat!!...the pace picks up quite evenly so you don't even realize till the last 10 minute segment how intense you're actually working...and for those very advanced steppers, it's very easy to add intensity to this workout and not miss a beat...I certainly agree that this tape is a bit dated, but hey, so what!...the workout worked in the last century and it works for me in this one too",1053734400,,501,4.5777777777777775
7909490,5,B00000I1PT,"I've been exercising for years, but this still got my heart going!  The straight 35 minutes of increasingly intense step aerobics is great.  Gilad's instructions are easy to follow and fun.  The workout is followed by 6 minutes of abs and a cooldown.  I recommend this to anyone who's learning to do step aerobics or even an advanced stepper.",1049328000,,342,4.745762711864407
7909491,5,B00000I1PT,"When I started this video, I thought that the level was too low for me, and that it was a video for beginners.
