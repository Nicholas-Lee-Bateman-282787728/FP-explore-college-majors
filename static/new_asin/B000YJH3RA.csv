8233095,3,B000YJH3RA,"There is a soft spot in my heart for Massage Nerd. As a professional massage therapist I like this and several other of his DVD's. They are certainly not Hollywood, but they do contain useful information. This one was not as useful to me as others I own, but it did have some techniques that were new to me and was a good review for me when I began doing chair massage again after being away from it for a few years. I think it a good DVD for the new massage therapist who wants to review and learn techniques and sequences.",1253750400,,524,4.147058823529412
