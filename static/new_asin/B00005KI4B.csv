7943307,2,B00005KI4B,"I bought this on a trip to Las Vegas a few years ago & never got around to watching it. I just returned from another trip to LV & remembered the DVD.
  Although the overall footage & info is good (footage looks like it was takin from a VHS), the audio production is the worst I've ever heard. What amazes me is that someone had to approve this. I tried looking for credits & found none.
  In some sections the music is so loud that you can't here the narrator. In others, the narration is missing, the music dips, like the narrator is going to come in & there's nothing for a few minutes. At other times the narrator's voice sounds completely different, it might have even been someone else. I accedently put on the Japanese audio track at one point & it sounded like it was recorded on a $25 home recorder with a $5 mic.
  It doesn't really cost much more to have some quality control. I'd love to know who produced this & what they were thinking.",1248825600,2,948,4.238888888888889
7943308,1,B00005KI4B,"Trying to watch this production with the bizarre sound issues was a treat.  There were points where the voiceover was barely audible and the background music was blaring, then would cut to very soft music and back again.  There were a number of quirks -
Why would a DVD advertising itself as ""Las Vegas"" video postcard neglect to include icons in Las Vegas, such as the Flamingo, the Riviera, the Hilton, etc, but talk in detail about fledgling entertainment towns 30 minutes away from the strip?
Why would a video on Las Vegas not include any of the culture and entertainment that can be had on the ""original"" strip that is downtown? Binions, Golden Nugget, Four Queens - not one of them is mentioned.
Also, the coverage was clearly biased.  While places such as TI and the Stratosphere went on and on in great detail - room prices, square footage, etc., other hotels like the Monte Carlo were barely given an obligatory mention.  The Stratosphere coverage looked more like an informercial - the Stratosphere rumbling and emerging from the ground, fireworks, and manufactured camera sweeps of slews of folks laughing and partying (sad to say, it was not at all representative of the actual Stratosphere.)
All in all, this video had a lot of potential, but was poorly organized and executed.  It's as if they got 60% done with their material and said, ""ok, that's enough, lets just wing it from here.""  I enjoyed the beginning and had a lot of hope based on the first 10 minutes, but I'm glad I didn't send this to my family as an inclusive example of the sights and scenes of Las Vegas.",1210982400,,1587,4.65
7943309,1,B00005KI4B,"Is a decent video travelogue of Las Vegas too much to ask?  This DVD answers that question with a resounding, ""Yes!""  While making side-trips focusing on the Grand Canyon, Hoover Dam (twice), Bonnie Springs, and a river rafting trip whereby the narrator got to ride in ""a real Hummer"" (dare to dream!), the video entirely failed to mention any of the history-rich casinos in Downtown, the Imperial Palace, Wynn, Palms, the LV Hilton (other than the Star Trek Experience), the Sahara (other than the NASCAR Cafe and Speed: The Ride), and many other staples.  While I am certainly not averse to mention of features outside Las Vegas, when I purchase a product called ""Las Vegas Video Postcard,"" I would expect it not to be done at the expense of actual Las Vegas attractions.  While Rumjungle and Voodoo Lounge are briefly displayed, what about the vast array of other nightclubs?  How about focusing on gambling -- the reason most folks make the journey to Las Vegas and the funding for all the megaresorts on the Strip -- other than quick mention that slots are the #1 moneymaker?  What about the off-Strip casinos like the Station properties?  What about the locals' favorites?  How about we take out the segment on Sigfried & Roy, now defunct for several years (the video states it was left in ""as a tribute to Roy Horn"") and spend some more time on the various Cirque du Soleil productions?

Even without taking the poor production quality into account (segments in which the background music drowns out the narrator, sections in which the music quiets for an obvious narrated segment in which no narration takes place, etc.), in all, this is a very disappointing presentation.",1210982400,,1680,4.846153846153846

7943311,5,B00005KI4B,"WOW what a great DVD! I liked the show segmets the best and it was a big help planing our vacation, I never knew that there was so much to do in Las Vegas now.

I thought the program flowed well and had a really good chaper index to quickly review the parts we wanted to see again. This looked just like someting you would see on the travel channel",1154304000,3,348,3.9714285714285715
7943312,5,B00005KI4B,I bought all of the new Las Vegas VHS & DVD titles here @ Amazon for my trip to LV and this one was the best by far.  It was the best quality and after I visited LV it turned out to be the most up todate with the most usefull info.  It was a bit more than the others but worth it!,1025136000,8,280,3.4285714285714284
