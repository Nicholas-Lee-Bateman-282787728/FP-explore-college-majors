As for the movies,they were older movies,but;they make the best movies. My son loves the older movies,as I do. Whatever movie Jon Wayne is in,you can count on it being a good movie.

It goes from Mississippi killing the last of the four men he had been looking for to avenge his mentor's death directly to him catching up with Cole just after he has a spasm from the bullet in his back and falls off his horse.  Very disappointing.  Otherwise, I was amazed at the quality of the films themselves.",1488672000,,436,4.3580246913580245

2914553,5,B000U1ZV6M,"I love all of these great westerns by John Wayne. To me, these 4 are the cream of the crop. The best, along with ' True Grit'.
 But I must admit I hold a special place in my heat and soul for his last western made in 1976 and of course is the 'Shootist' . W hich is a great human interest adult western drama about a dying older ex- gunfighter and his last days at the turn of the 20th century. Also starring Lauren Bacall, who become friends and yet are resolved to his fate and last days. It is just so, so moving and when the final shootout occurs ( against Richard Boone and Hugh O"" Brian as the mean bad guys) and He gets killed I was brought to tears. This is a must see Wayne final western. Great flic!
 The others are also 3 of the best he made, especially ' The Searchers'. Its just that I hold a special place in my heart for 'The Shootist'
  The pictures are clear and the price is low for the 4 great westerns offered here.
 Buy this set. Its wonderful!!",1430092800,7,966,4.010416666666667

I slipped the unmarked disc into the player and up came Flying Leathernecks. When we finished watching Flying Leathernecks I flipped the disc over and to my surprise it contained a black & white version of Back To Bataan. When we finished watching the movie I used a felt tip pen to label both sides.

We enjoy watching John Wayne in his various roles so even though these are not very high quality discs, and the unbelievable sloppiness of failure to label a disc, I am rating 5 stars for content. I am rating 3 stars for low product quality and lack of labeling for a net rating of 4 stars.",1423440000,3,768,4.370629370629371

Searchers, a drawn out tale of a kidnapping of a niece by Indians......and the murder of the rest of her family and the search for her.

2914990,4,B000U1ZV6M,"John Wayne and Clint Eastwood (among others)  came out with several great Westerns in the 60's and early to mid 70's that I saw new at the drive in's and indoor theater's and when the VHS Movie was introduced in the 80's: I jumped at the chance to buy these Westerns when they became avaliable locally. Of course there was little to no internet in the 80's & 90's so it was tough finding some of them.

After searching for quite a while: I did finally manage to find and purchase three of these classic John Wayne Westerns on VHS and after 20+ years: the quality of my old ""Sons Of Katie Elder"", ""El Dorado"" & ""The Shootist"" VHS Movies have finally deteriorated to where they need to be replaced and this four Movie Warner Home Video
 DVD Package is very handy as a replacement Package. This is nice and I don't have to be hunting down each individual Movie separately.

 This is the first Review I have typed on Movies and unless you are wanting a Movie with lots of Extra's, Special Features and such.....this is the way to purchase them.....Some DVD's in these various four Movie Packages DO have some Extra's,Special Features and such.

Final Comment: Another VHS Movie I had purchased with those three was True Grit but I have already replaced it with an individual True Grit DVD and the fourth Movie that's with this DVD Package (The Searchers) is a John Wayne Western I had never previously owned so I consider that Movie a bonus.",1389052800,11,1437,4.507692307692308

2915016,2,B000U1ZV6M,"I have watched 3 of the 4 movies here in other post-war times. Always fascinated by war treatment through ""based on"" movie stories of actual theatres of conflict and combat.  (I'm very curious about the 4th, Pacific Command, which I haven't seen but would like to.)

As one reviewer correctly states, these are not typical war-time ""flag wavers"" of the kind featuring Wayne (Flying Tigers, 1942; The Fighting Seabees, 1944) and other favourite stars. They Were Expendable and Back to Bataan were released just as WWII was ending (changing events in the Philippines meant script rewrites as RKO shot Bataan) and the other two were made in 1951, years after the war, but which retain that ol' red-white-and blue flavor. Howcum, I wondered? Wasn't the U.S. eager to leave that awful experience behind and embrace the new, shiny upwardly-mobile world of the 1950s?  Well, no.  On one level, it couldn't afford to: `Japs' had been replaced by a new enemy--Chinese Communists; America (along with dozens of other countries) was once again off on another rescue mission. Just substitute South Korea for the Philippines.

So, no wonder Hollywood was re-creating that (safe) war again eager to show, as reviewers here put it,  ""what the USA tho't of itself"" and ""the dedication, perseverance, sacrifice, and bravery of our United States armed forces"" (Whew!!)  The USA was at war again, folks! Just like it was LBJ's Vietnam years, when 1965's In Harm's Way paired the Duke again with his Operation Pacific co-star, the wonderful Patricia Neal--again a nurse!--in another navel picture that acted as a ""safe"" wartime morale-booster.)
That's interesting.

But the movies themselves?  Not so much, today. (which makes over 90 reviews a fascinating fact in itself!) Of the 3 that I've seen, Expendable is the most interesting, because of its dour, meditative feeling. But a lot of doom-and-gloom philosophy talk before the machine guns stutter and the artillery opens up make for a slow ""action"" pic.

All these movies are crippled by their technology, which reduced many action sequences to pastiches of obvious sound-stage heroics, grainy real-life combat footage and (especially with In Harm's Way) primitive miniature work. All of which tends to make them, for me, at least, uninvolving film relics; interesting curiosities, but not very compelling.

For ""compelling"" takes on this theatre of war, purchase Clint Eastwood's Flags of Our Fathers, or Tom Hanks' HBO series, The Pacific.",1384905600,,2476,5.180451127819549
2915017,5,B000U1ZV6M,John Wayne not much else can be said other than it is nice to see a movies that does not have people taking thier clothes off five minutes into it and putting them back on five minutes vefore it ends.

2915019,5,B000U1ZV6M,Very good movies and I particulary like the They Were Expendable. It is very well done and Robert Montgomery add authenticity to it since he was a PT Boat commander in the Pacific and brought back to make the movie.,1383696000,,215,4.4

Very patriotic and to some extent similar in style they often represent fine examples of the movie making art. Particularly worth mention here is ""They were Expendable"" a good story with a fine cast and well developed human relationship themes as well as exciting and convincing action scenes. That this film was made by John Ford would raise your expectations and the film certainly delivers. Nicholas Ray, Edward Dmytryk and George Waggner are the other directors and they do not disappoint. ""Operation Pacific"" is another worth mention being perhaps, in my opinion, second to the ""Enemy Below"" the best submarine film of WW 2. The underwater scenes are rivetting.

I buy things like this for birthdays as I know they are appreciated and hard to find.  Thanks Amazon.com for the best of all DVD's I can find.  I have purchased alot of them, and my favorites are old movies that you no longer can see, nor do they show them.  They are yesteryear, & I am 89 years old, so they please me to see the movies of my day, that were made for good thoughts and putting romance back in your heart.  Thanks Amazon.com.

Tracking said the DVD set was in my neighborhood and out for the daily delivery. Did not get it. Emailed sender and got a refund through Amazon. Then 2 months later via United States mail I received delivery. Go figure? Again I don't blame the sender. I blame the US mail.

The 4 film 2 DVD John Wayne set played perfect with no problems.

Included was They Were Expendable in B/W  Full screen version about a PT boat squadron in the Pacific. They attack much larger Japanese ships and try to slow down the Japanese advance with machine gun fire and torpedoes from their small PT boats. Staring John Wayne, Robert Montgomery and Donna Reed. Excellent movie. 5 stars. If you like true PT boat action read about JFK and crew in PT 109( read my review...5 stars).

Operation Pacific in B/W ( my favorite of this 4 movie set with John Wayne and Patricia Neal is a riveting battling submarine story with Patricia Neal playing John Wayne's ( the XO then skipper of the Thunderfish sub) ex wife. Lots of great naval  battle action and a love story. 5 stars

Flying Leathernecks in color is about a Marine fighter squadron with John Wayne in charge of the squadron and Robert Ryan as the XO. Lots of fighter fight scenes, attacks on ships, and supporting ground troops. 5 stars

Back to Bataan in B/W was in my opinion the most historical showing the collapse of Bataan and the capture of 70,000 US troops. We see the Filipino resistance fighters and their hardships attacking superior Japanese forces and attacking and trying to hold Japanese held positions until General MacArthur and his troops can gather strength and come back and liberate the Philippine nation. Very well done. Here is a DVD set I am proud to show my teenage daughters showing the hardships the military went through defeating the Japanese in WW2. Much of these actions are no longer told in Public schools and INMO it is important to show the younger generation the men and women in WW2 that died  so the  US could remain free and the Philippine people could be liberated. A great movie with historical significance and lots of battle action  staring John Wayne as a Marine Colonel and Anthony Quinn as a Filipino Captain. 5 stars.

The biggest treat on this set is Operation Pacific, a tremendous submarine flick. When the Duke directs a surface ramming of a Japanese freighter, I had to admire the audacity and excitement of this scene....this is a magnificent film!

The other 2 films, Back to Bataan and Flying Leathernecks are very entertaining; Flying Leathernecks features two of my favorite male stars of the era, the Duke and the great Robert Ryan.

2915445,5,B000U1ZV6M,"They Were Expendable may arguably be the best John Wayne WW II movie he ever made. After watching Flying Leathernecks I statrted wondering if I could find an old Hellcat that I could go fly, (It turns out those Grummans are very exspensive and suck lot's of fuel). Realizing that I could never afford to go fly on of those magnificent machines I was forced to come to grips with reality and do what any red blooded american fighting male would do, I watched it again with equal enthusiasim! Operation Pacific is most people favorite, In just thought it was okay. Back  to Bataan is good in that it chronicals the effort to and for America by Fillipino citizens.",1267488000,11,661,4.554621848739496

2915448,5,B000U1ZV6M,"This is an excellent collection of John Wayne movies that are all set in World War II in the Pacific Theater of Operations. Each film individually stands on it's own as a very good depiction of the dedication, perseverance, sacrifice, and bravery of our United States armed forces fighting incredible odds in the Pacific area of World War II. ""They Were Expendable"" is set against a backdrop of the early use of the PT Boat, as President John F. Kennedy served on. (JFK himself is NOT depicted). ""Flying Leathernecks"" is a little more title obvious is about Marine Corps fliers in WW II. ""Operation Pacific"" is about the submarine warfare aspect of WW II. Back To Bataan"" depicts the fight in the Philippines and the way the US Armed forces worked with the Filipino freedom fighters in their effort to resist the Japanese.

They are all good films, each worth the cost of the set, and then some. So grab up the set and get a bargain. You may want to stock up on popcorn and have a weekend film festival.",1263427200,47,1003,4.541436464088398
2915449,4,B000U1ZV6M,"""They Were Expendable"" alone was worth the price of this collection! ""Back to Bataan"" with its recognition of the heroism of the Filipino's, ""Operation Pacific"" bringing The Duke together with his 2nd most popular leading lady (Maureen O'Hara will always be the 1st) and a ""war is hell"" story, & ""Flying Leathernecks"" are all high water marks for JW & what the USA tho't of itself!
