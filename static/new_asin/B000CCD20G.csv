2456780,1,B000CCD20G,"We got this for our 3 year old daughter after reading reviews here and looking at the cute box cover. She loves penguins and penguin stories.

This movie was horrible and shocking! The fathers abandon their eggs, the seagulls steal the eggs, at one point you see a penguin with bloody scratches along its back, the evil (and I do mean evil) sailors kidnap the penguin children, they shoot the old penguin (yes they just nick him but really do we need to show our kids people shooting penguins in children's films), the sailor's ship is then capsized and presumably they're all killed.

Scamper the cute little penguin. More like Rambo meets Happy Feet. Do not buy this please!",1189987200,4,676,4.6722689075630255
2456781,5,B000CCD20G,"I teach Kindergarten and this is my FAVORITE video for this age group. (First and second graders like it too.  Scamper has some exciting adventures and really captures the attention of the children.  Also, as an added bonus, the cartoon creators were able to sneak in a lot of scientific facts without the kids catching on that they were learning while they were having fun!",1169337600,8,374,4.7384615384615385

2456785,4,B000CCD20G,"The animation in this Japanese cartoon is certainly not up to the standards of today's big-budget toonies, but it's a cute little film that smaller kids should find interesting and adults can tolerate.  Scamper is a penguin chick with a penchant for wandering away from the nest.  Facing attacks from seagulls and sea lions, Scamper nevertheless wanders off and meets a huskie and his human owner, a scientist.  Another venture is not as friendly though as Scamper and his little pal Snowflake are whisked away by hunters who plan to sell them to the zoo.  They meet Louie, a Macaroni penguin (?) who tries to help them escape.

Scamper teaches the value of learning and family and is harmless enough for the young set, although there is a little disturbing violence with the penguin hunters.  All in all, a fun movie for the family to watch together.",1137024000,8,851,4.755102040816326
2456806,5,B000CCD20G,This is one of my favorite movies from childhood. It's a simple plot that's easy for kids to understand. It has good life lessons and some humor. It's definitely one you can watch from beginning to end at a young age. My daughter is 3 and loves it! It was fun songs and you learn a lot about penguins. It's adorable and I'm so glad I found it!,1433808000,,343,4.0588235294117645

2456814,5,B000CCD20G,"Watched this when I was a child and yes, the animation is old and the voices annoying to parents after a while, but the messages can't be beat!  My 2.5yr old daughter loves this movie, and I hear her laughing or telling Scamper ""no"" when he's being naughty and really getting involved.  It's safe for 2yrs on up, even the ""scarier"" moments don't have that dread to them because of the music involved and aren't too much for her to handle.

A good, clean, kid movie that'll teach real lessons about penguins and strikes a good balance between humans as both good and bad.  A must!  Get this instead of Happy Feet",1407715200,3,611,4.419642857142857

It's still sorta grainy & blurry like the old VHS versions.  Also, I forgot about the gun violence at the end.  The human's who take penguins shoot at the penguins with big ol' rifles and injure one of the penguins.  I had completely forgotten about that piece and was a little shocked as my young child was watching it.",1406678400,,489,4.21505376344086
2456837,4,B000CCD20G,When I was little I had a VHS copy of this.  I remember I used to watch it all the time.  I was a great cartoon to watch as a kid.  For years since then I always had it in my mind that I watched this as a kid but I couldn't remember the name of it.  I looked it up and I am glad to see it's on DVD.  I recommend this for any child.,1397692800,,331,3.3026315789473686

2456857,2,B000CCD20G,"This is a low budget movie from the early 90's I believe. When I was little, this was my favorite movie. My mother reminds me often about how I watched this over and over and over. I am sure it rated 5 stars back then.

Now I have two preschools of my own and with technology so advanced today, the quality of this movies just doesn't compete in any way. They both were not impressed.

Another thing to keep I mind: Children movies, when I was younger, had a lot of violence and scary moments that society has kind of weaned out these days. I personally do not want my children watching penguins die but that is just me.

Would I recommend this? No but I do believe it was an excellent movie back in the early 90's. Not for today.",1386806400,,730,4.163120567375887

2456865,5,B000CCD20G,My preschoolers and I love this movie.  I play it after doing a mini unit study on penguins.

It is one of those movies that give you the happy warm feeling that everything will be okay in the world. I was so shocked when in my twenties I realized it was an educational video, I never would have known! This tells the tale of Scamper the young baby penguin who has quite the adventure; he and you both learn a good lesson from his adventure. Definitely recommend for any young ones (it is very clean and cute.)",1359331200,,489,4.268817204301075

2456896,1,B000CCD20G,"First, let me say that ""violence"" in nature does not bother my family. Although I have never eaten penguin, our freezer is full of a variety of fish and wild game. So watching hungry seagulls snatch a few penguin eggs does not bother us in the least. However, I just do not see any point or plot in the story whatsoever. It seems nothing more to me than an animated documentary. Further, the accompanying background music swings unpredictably from a happy, carefree state to dark/somber/ominous mood. I didn't know how I was supposed to feel from scene to scene. Overall, I was left feeling very confused. I am thankful to have rented this one from the library.",1324598400,,661,4.6581196581196584

2456902,2,B000CCD20G,"I just watched this video with my daughter who is almost four.  Since this is promoted as a family film with strong values, I was excited to watch it with her.  I must say, I am not impressed.  I don't think Scamper is much of a role model.  Yes, he is adventurous but he continually disobeys his parents and puts his friend in situations they are not comfortable in.  Then at the end he is chosen as their leader?? (sending the message that his behavior was okay) Okay, I get the fact that this is just a kids show and maybe you will think I'm a little over the top for not seeing him as role-model material, but I can't believe I'm the only one who thinks this?  Trust me, I want my children to be adventurous and think independently, but I would hope they would act more responsibly than Scamper.  Plus, at the end the scientists comment something like ""God gave the sailors what they deserve.""  Sorry, but the God I believe has better things to do than go around punishing people.

My daughter did not even really like the movie - she thought the sailers were scary.

The only reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is the fact that there is some scientific information sprinkled throughout.  so, if your child wants to learn more about penguins, an okay purchase.  If you want a film with strong morals - keep looking.",1258761600,,1330,4.383673469387755

2456905,3,B000CCD20G,"* some spoilers here*

I have not seen this particular version of the film nor have I partaken in the DVD.

Nonetheless a few thoughts about this film from a viewer who has seen this in the original state.

The production is Soviet-Japanese from 1986 - an extremely popular cartoon from where I'm from (Russia).  I recently revisited the film after finally seizing upon it after years and years of memories.  I was only a child when I first saw the cartoon and I recall that it affected me greatly.

These kinds of viewings are always risky, because in my adult age I am often disappointed, but my recollections were so vivid that I was convinced that this had to have been something special.

I figured out why this stayed with me for so long.  As a kid you are not exposed to much peril in animation.  Disney in particular keeps its films very free of any suggestions of danger.  There are exceptions like the Lion King, but any kind of death there is accompanied with redemption and clear-cut distinctions between good and evil.  Things are not as simple here.  We have evil, but we also have instinct and basic survival, meaning laws of nature.  Sometimes no one is to blame.

I had a similar experience recently with another Japanese animated work ""Pom Poko"", which was about a rather bittersweet existence of racoons.  Bittersweet is also a good way to describe Scamper or, as they called him in Russian, ""Lolo"".  The ending is profoundly open-ended - not happy but hopeful and somewhat sad.  It was affecting.

Now, I know that this is the American version and I bet that it underwent a lot of changes, so I do wonder how much of the peril it has.  The original version of course has the final confrontation with the poachers where they shoot at the penguins and kill a few.  Interestingly enough I did not recall this happening specifically, but I did remember appreciating the fact that the filmmakers did not treat their young viewers as fools.  There is no false merriment and the penguins' land is not a Disney-fied theme park ride.  In fact, part of the effect that this cartoon had on this young viewer was in presenting Antarctica as large, barren, mysterious and somewhat melancholic.

The penguins' resilience through the tough conditions of Antarctica and the inherent dangers of human and animal variety is essentially the story.  As characters our little baby penguins are not the drivers of the narrative, but are instead caught within one - where the land and its inhabitants thrust them into great danger.  This is very non-Disney.

Kids should be exposed to this.  This is not about redemption, but about survival and friendship.

The sad thing is that the American version has apparently replaced the wonderfully lyrical original score with an upbeat one.  Shucks.

Rating: a neutral 3 out of 5 as I still haven't seen the American version, but the original is wonderful of course.",1208908800,5,2906,4.731075697211155
8097174,5,B000CCD20G,I Loved this movie as a kid and was so excited when I found it here online! I shared it with my kid and my nieces and nephews and they all love it now too. Scamper is such a cute little penguin who goes on some pretty crazy adventures and learns the importance of responsibility.

8097179,4,B000CCD20G,"My wife found this movie in the $5 bin at Wal-Mart.  It was one of her favorites as a small child, and we'd recently been reminiscing about our old favorite cartoons, so on a whim she bought it.  We just watched it together a few minutes ago, and I gotta say it's a pretty cute cartoon, and very educational.  I would much rather watch this with kids than an episode of Spongebob Squarepants.  We are going to be starting a family of our own soon, and I'm glad my wife found this and bought it.  There are some thrilling moments, but nothing that's scary - pretty sure most kids will be able to handle the few tense moments just fine.  I've read that there are different versions out there, and the one we got was definitely the American version where they tone down the violence and make it a bit more cartoony for the children.  Nobody actually dies (well, except for the evil human poachers of course, but their deaths are offscreen when their boat capsizes).  The only blood is a short scene where, after being picked up and carried a short distance by a hungry seagull, there are red scratches on Scamper's back.  But one of the friendly humans patches him up, and the scratches look no worse than what a kid would get scraping their knee on a sidewalk.  I'd say this is a perfect movie for kids, the only flaw being that some of the higher-pitched penguin voices are quite squealy, and would probably become grating to the ears of parents after repeated viewings.  A minor thing, but I found it annoying enough to remove a star for it.  I'll still be showing this movie to my future children: it's fun and educational, teaches good lessons, and has songs that encourage learning and exploring.",1470182400,,1699,4.498371335504886
