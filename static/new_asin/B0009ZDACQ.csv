My son was born on that day and I could hear the show quite clearly. I've never seen the show and never will, at these prices. By the way, upon reading the reviews. They got the date wrong. It was, Saturday, September 14th, 1980. Trust me, I won't forget that date.",1420675200,,393,4.116883116883117

8070727,5,B0009ZDACQ,"In 1980, Elton John held the first ever rock concert in Central Park. Over 400, 000 people were in attendance, as they saw the 33 year old pianist perform some of his biggest hits for the rather large audience.

Now, after 25 years of waiting, the concertis finally available on vhs. And it looks and sounds better than ever. The performance is awesome. Elton is at his best here on songs like ""Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting"", ""Little Jeannie"", ""Bennie And The Jets"", ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" and ""Philadelphia Freedom"". Elton also performs a very moving version of ""Imagine"", just months before John Lennon was murdered. The performance of ""Someone Saved My Life Tonight"" was fantastic, and it was nice to see Elton sing with an audience memeber. The concert's most memorable moment was when Elton performed ""Your Song"" dressed as Donald Duck.

My advice is to go to the video store and pick up this fine, fine concert that is perfect for all music lovers.",1124928000,5,968,4.825301204819277
