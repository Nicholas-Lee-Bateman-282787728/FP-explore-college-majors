8245576,5,B0012EM5HY,Box was in great condition and I feel happy knowing I could finish out my Ranma 1/2 collection. The seller was very detailed in the product description; I would comfortably look them up again.,1469836800,,192,4.676470588235294
8245577,5,B0012EM5HY,"If you like comedy anime, this is an excellent show. I love the humor on it . I am a big fan of Takahashi's work and, for the most part, the anime brings it to life.",1396742400,,165,3.611111111111111
8245578,5,B0012EM5HY,"The title of this season says it all. In the previous seasons we could see some direction. Not much, but enough to progress the story a little. Season 6 is just about as random as you can get. There are your standard anime Christmas and New Years episodes. A couple episodes about another cursed fellow from Jusenkyo. A couple episodes about Ukyo, and an introduction to a new ""rival"". Nothing much really happens in season 6. But it's true to the spirit of the Ranma 1/2 series. It's great fun. I can confidently say that if you enjoyed any of the previous seasons, then you should like this one as well. Random Rhapsody is a box set worth having.",1364688000,,648,4.453781512605042
8245579,5,B0012EM5HY,"This show is a classic. It is amazing, and it is well worth the watch. You will love the characters, you won't be able to not. It's one of the shows that will sneak into your heart and make itself at home.",1359849600,,205,3.9047619047619047
8245580,5,B0012EM5HY,"We've watched six of the seven seasons so far, and I have to say that Ranma is one of our all time favorites. My ex wife actually introduced me to this Anime a long time ago, and my ten year old daughter fell in love with it. As a parent, I will caution that there is some brief nudity through the series, but not enough to make me worry about it. Most of it was done for comedic effect, more than anything else. Even my mother likes this one, which is saying a lot. I like the fact that it has slapstick humor as well as higher level comedic moments. There's nothing in this serious that worries me as a parent, but I would suggest you watch a few episodes yourself and make up your mind.

There really isn't any overlying story line, most of the episodes stand alone but there are a few stories that take more than one episode to tell. I'm going to buy season 7 next and all the movies to complete our collection.",1283904000,3,915,4.140449438202247
8245581,5,B0012EM5HY,As long as you don't expect plot and great story you will find yourself enjoying the Ranma 1/2 series. I find myself watching them when I just want to relax and smile. It is an easy series to sit down and watch an episode or two.,1252800000,,229,4.0
8245582,3,B0012EM5HY,"Ranma 1/2 Random Rhapsody is a DVD box set of the sixth season of Ranma 1/2.  This set contains a total of twenty-four episodes.  The first four discs contain five episodes, while the fifth disc contains four episodes and the special features.

There are six special features on this set: ""Line Art Gallery,"" ""Textless Opening,"" ""Textless Ending,"" ""Cast List,"" ""Actor Profiles,"" and ""Maison Ikkloku Trailer.""  As expected, the textless opening and ending are just the opening and ending credits without the text.  The line art gallery contains eighteen pages of model sketches of the characters that appear in this DVD box set.  The cast list is a list of the English and Japanese voice actors for each character.  The actor profiles are selected filmographies for the English voice actors.  The ""Maison Ikkoku Trailer"" is a trailer for the Maison Ikkoku DVD box sets that were released by Viz Media.

Ranma 1/2 Random Rhapsody is a rather ""low frills"" DVD set.  While the special features are better than what appeared on the first Ranma 1/2 DVD box set, I wish more of an effort had been made with the special features.

While this set could be considered a little high-priced for what you get, the episodes are worth the cost.  This series is very enjoyable for an older audience (16 and up), and really should be in an anime fan's DVD collection.",1248134400,,1350,4.796536796536796
8245583,5,B0012EM5HY,"Ranme is kid animation well liked by teenage and Adult.  It can be silly,funny;but it's warm, caring and romanic.  Many people would give this Japanese TV series a ""R""rating because of the nudity,in the japanese culture this is anormal show being watch by kids all over japan.  PG-13 is the correct rating for this show.  You will enjoy it.",1220832000,2,340,4.711864406779661
