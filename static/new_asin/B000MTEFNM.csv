2747435,5,B000MTEFNM,"This is by far THE best, most accurate, and up-to-date video presentation of the current state of Shroud research released, to date (2007)!!!  If you have any interest at all in the truth about the Shroud of Turin, this is the one to watch.  You will be amazed at how much has been discovered about this true relic of the Resurrection, and the possibilities yet to be discovered.  Buy it!",1179100800,12,388,4.514285714285714
2747436,5,B000MTEFNM,"I eagerly ordered pre-ordered this DVD as soon as I found out that it was going to be released.  I have read a few articles and one book about the Shroud, but the material I have is from 1995.  So I was eager to see what the latest research was.  The 3D images and provided glasses did make the holographic images stand out, but not quite like I was expecting - maybe it is just my old TV.

The DVD launches right into quantum mechanics and other scientific theories from the very beginning.  Someone who does not know about the history of the Shroud might be a bit lost if learning about the shroud for the first time.  Later in the video, the history is brought out as various arguments are put forth either for or against its authenticity.  The ""extras"" are a must see too, as they expand even more upon specific aspects presented in the video.  I learned a lot of new things.  For example, there appear to be coins covering the eyelids of the man in the image; and they appear to be like ""widows mites"" minted under the authority of Pontius Pilate in 29 A.D.  Also, there appears to be an amulet in the image with the letters ""ABA"" (Aleph Beyth Aleph) which means ""Father"".  I want to study those particular things further since I am by nature somewhat skeptical.  So, this video has increased my interest in The Shroud of Tourin rather than satisfied it!  The evidence and new findings presented here are very compelling and powerfully affected me.  I am convinced that the Shroud of Tourin is the very burial shroud of the resurrected Savior, Jesus Christ.  I also think that it is especially awesome that such scientifically inexplicable, tangible evidence of the resurrection has been preserved for us unto this day.  Check it out for yourself!",1178323200,30,1752,4.5495207667731625
2747437,5,B000MTEFNM,"This is a well done documentary about the 'Shroud of Turin' which uses forensic pathology to support a remarkable theory relating quantum physics/the event horizon to the Resurrection. The presentation by a forensic pathologist to explain the physical evidence on the shroud is very convincing.  The theory that the evidence on the shroud, when interpreted in light of current principles of quantum physics, might prove the Resurrection, is equally compelling.  A definite 'must see' for both skeptics and believers.

I learned that the Shroud is one of a kind, unique in its properties - exposing phenomena that are still a mystery to the brightest of minds.

Jesus said if you don't believe him, believe in his works.  This shroud has stood the test of time.  And I really do marvel over the 3d images of Christ.  I even printed out these images and was able to have my own private photos of the 3d crucified Christ. I really do like how the lady scientist explains how Jesus must of levitated in his tomb. Thats why no image wrinkles?  The part about the event horizon taking place was cool.

The video is the most in-depth I have seen to date.  And I'm glad someone smart was able to put to bed the carbon dating results.",1249171200,6,693,4.204545454545454
2747489,5,B000MTEFNM,"In the Fabric of Time DVD we go over some of the (brief) history of The Shroud of Turin; which some claim to be the burial cloth of Jesus: which has been surrounded in controversy; Is it authentic evidence of the resurrection of the Christ or some kind of elaborate fake. Back in the 1970's the Vatican let a team of scientists study the shroud, including cutting some small sample form it, the scientific team put in over 170,000 hours of research on the project and concluded that they did not know how it was made but that it was from Israel and from the time of Christ. In the 80's a carbon test was done and dated the shroud to the middle ages, and it seemed like all the 170,000 hours of research was just tossed out. But that carbon testing has been debunked, because of a few things, one was that the shroud was singed in a fire, and they dated the repair work. that has been proven to be a fact, the evidence shows that the fibers dated were not the original. Also you probably cannot date the shroud accurately because of the fire for one, and because it has a layer of insect residue upon it. So the Shroud is proven to be from the first century and the image is not explainable up to the 1990's. Also forensically evidence shows that the person on the shroud is 5' 11"" around 175 and was scourged, beaten and crucified. Also the blood patterns on the Shroud match with he other head cloth the catholic Church has in Spain, from Christ death and resurrection. In the last 18 years a new theory have come up as to the origin of the shroud, and it deal's with radiation, but we have nothing that can do that, so it cannot be tested. This newest theory has a twist and its is in the DVD, that the shroud was formed by a Quantum singularity. the same power that created the universe and they make a strong theoretical case. Really interestingly stuff. Is this 100% proof of Christ's resurrection, No; that is a matter I accept by faith but this is evidence that can point you in the right direction, and that direction is to Jesus of Nazareth, the Christ!",1241049600,5,2062,4.31701030927835

2747491,5,B000MTEFNM,"This DVD really proved beyond any doubt that the image on the shroud is in fact our Great God and Savior Jesus Christ. He was 5'11"" tall, about 175 pounds, had long hair and a manly beard.  All of this information is right there in the most excellent photograph given to us by Jesus at the moment of His resurrection. He was like, hovering or something inbetween the folded sheet (shroud) Wow, man... watching this DVD almost takes you back in time to the moment Jesus rose from the dead! Outstanding.  Just think, one day that is going to happen to us! God is truly awesome.  As I watched this DVD I couldn't help but think how awesome God is and how He used some fantastic method beyond our current comprehension of putting the image of our Lord on this cloth.  Jesus had type AB blood!  I'm sure that is significant in some way too, man.  I'm not sure.. but that is like a type of blood that can receive all bloods or something.. and that must be saying something but I don't know what exactly... will have to ponder that one.  Oh and what a cool medallion Jesus had around his neck!  WOW!  I wept when I saw that...  Oh the love of God comes through in this production.  What a great God He is, what a great Savior for us all.  I thank God for putting the image of Jesus on the shroud so we can all know what He looked like.  Thanks God!

2747492,5,B000MTEFNM,"This video is a great look at the Shroud of Turin. The first 8 minutes or so is a bit meandering but after that it picks right up. Instead of the ""Shroud of Turin"" I will call it the Resurrection Shroud of Christ for that is what it is. This video will demonstrate to you how there is simply no rational explanation for the Shroud's existence and yet it exists. It is an impossible relic and yet, there it is. Make sure you watch all the extra features as they are extremely informative. The extra features also cover the Suderian which is the other burial cloth of Christ.

Instead, it uses gimmick technology and a mishmash of concepts, all in the name of quantum physics (or something).  To add to the confusion, two sets of 3D glasses are included.  I hate to be too critical, but don't get your hopes up for any ground-breaking news here on the shroud.  It tries too hard, and gets nowhere.",1234742400,2,391,4.542857142857143
2747494,5,B000MTEFNM,"I highly recommend this DVD as my wife and I never grow tired of watching this documentary. It is full of science and facts that will break the foundation of even the most ardent skeptic. I find the evidence for the invisible weave fascinating and has now been verified. The Shroud is a first century cloth. The Shroud contains various flora images, probably formed by coronal discharge, that are exclusive to Jerusalem and to the spring time praticularly. The DVD has extensive interviews and destroys many old held theories such as C-14 dating and that the image is painted. Experts in their fields prove the authenticity of this relic and most fascinating is the Holographic Imagery.
  Dr. Soons took copies on 1930's negatives to a holographic laboratory and though they were quite skeptical were able to produce 3D images,this in itself is astounding as no other 2D object can produce 3D images...NO OTHER 2D OBJECT!!! No the Shroud is completely unique and this DVD does an excellent job of marrying cutting edge science with a 2000 year old image on a cloth to prove the fact Jesus Christ rose from the dead. This is GOD's finger print of what is yet to come for us and proof for an age of science that demands facts. The Hologram also brought out incredible unseen before details about the Shroud including a plaque on the neck of Christ, Dr. Soons recently said in a lecture the plaque read The Lamb and not Father as the DVD represents.
  There is much more but I have made my point get this DVD and be greatly blessed and strengthened in your faith that your LORD did rise from the dead and Nothing is Impossible with GOD....JB",1219363200,12,1638,4.637931034482759
2747495,5,B000MTEFNM,"Was astounded & delighted to see the evidence of the connection of the 2 burial cloths presented in this DVD.  While I've always believed in the Shroud as the physical evidence of the Resurrection, it was gratifying to see such incontravertable evidence presented in such a compelling manner.  It is unfortunate that The Sudarium of Oveido has not received the same notariety as the Shroud; the combined evidence leaves no doubt (in my humble mind) as to their origins/use.

2747498,5,B000MTEFNM,"I watched the documentary. I'm a Catholic Christian. I had some doubts of the Shroud before watching this video. Now that I finished it, I do believe the Shroud of Turin is the burial cloth of Jesus Christ. The graphic analysis by a pathologist is shocking. The only other source we have about the crucifixion is the Bible.

The image of the shroud show a man had his side pierced just like Jesus in the Bible.  He was also scourge 160 times.  No man have suffer this much before the first Century. We only know one man. Jesus Christ, who is both God and Man.",1191369600,29,559,4.304761904761905
2747499,5,B000MTEFNM,"I remember in my senior class being told by my Chemistry teacher that ""you can't put God in a test tube.""  I still liked my Chem teacher.  He was a cool guy.
  Anyway, for those who want an evaluation of physical evidence for the resurrection, this is where the scientists, both pro and con, have been given their wish---a chance to put God in a test tube so to speak.
  When I first heard of the shroud of Turin thirty years ago, I dismissed it as not genuine, because my understanding was that there was a face cloth along with the grave clothes.  This documentary gives a clear discription of the face cloth as well, which has a pattern of blood splotches on it that match ones found on the main shroud. This relic is presently being kept in Spain.
  Unfortunately, because the Roman Catholic church has both these cloths in their possession, it stands to reason that many Protestants will dismiss this physical evidence out of hand.  This, I feel, is a mistake.  Even though I am a conservative Baptist, I do believe the Catholic Church has done a service to the world by protecting these relics.  There is no doubt in my mind that they are genuine, even though the radiocarbon date does not support the shroud's authenticity.
  I would caution those who take the radio carbon date of the shroud seriously to keep something in mind; the shroud went through a fire in 1532 and was even burnt through in several places.  It is hard to imagine how this would not adversely affect the shroud's carbon content and throw off the radioactive carbon date.
  One must be careful how much faith is put into this dating method, especially when different tissue samples from the same mammoth have been radioactive carbon dated at more than 2,000 years apart.
  I would encourage those who are open-minded to sound, scientific evidence to get this DVD.  I believe the Almighty has allowed this physical evidence to be preserved for examination by this highly scientific and sketical age---evidence which could not be as thoroughly examined until the advent of today's highly sophisticated scientific equipment.",1186876800,58,2101,4.751381215469613

A better buy with much more info is Mark Antonacci's excellent book from 2000 - ""The Resurrection of the Shroud.""  This  DVD is constantly promising to reveal the very secrets of the Universe by tying quantum theory into the Shroud....and never really does! I couldn't believe how abruptly the DVD ended!  We still do not know if the basic premise of the DVD (that the image is holographic) is true or not.  And astronaut Edgar Mitchell and physicist Alan Wolfe are tossed into the mix - not as Shroud proponants (which they NEVER even mention in their segments) but simply because they make the roster of interviewees more impressive.  The ONLY thing truly new here is that the samples taken for the Carbon-14 dating were perhaps taken from a mended portion of the cloth: THIS, if truly true, is what the documentary SHOULD have focussed on at greater length....and not the dangling of carrots of ultimate answers before us to lead us, ultmately, nowhere!
