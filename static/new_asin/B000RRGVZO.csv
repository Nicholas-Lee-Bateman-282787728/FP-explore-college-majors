8202368,3,B000RRGVZO,"Gitano, or Gypsy, is a cute showcase of Sandro's talents, and one to rival many of Elvis's movies. Here he delivers an adequately convincing portrayal of a carny who gets mixed up in some criminal mischief. To make things worse, others are quick to judge his character and incriminate him just by the fact that he possesses 'gypsy' blood. To add in a bit of romance, Sandro has two girls in the mix: one doubtful of his innocence and the other ready and willing to aid in his defense.

The musical numbers are entertaining, especially when Sandro puts his signature moves in motion. Unfortunately, the filmmakers fail to keep Sandro's lip movement in sync with the songs, which makes it a bit distracting for the viewer. One of the highlights takes place at the very beginning when Sandro is riding bareback on a horse along the coastline. Another highlight is is when Sandro sings a song fully dressed in a Pierrot-like clown costume. Nevermind the fact that this movie has a basic, star-driven formula. Sandro's charms are enough to hold the viewer's attention until the very end.",1460851200,,1082,4.786096256684492
