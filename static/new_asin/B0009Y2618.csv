2336895,3,B0009Y2618,"El Alamein: Line of Fire is an Italian war film that depicts the Italian point of view in the pivotal Battle of El Alamein in the fall of 1942. The time period covered is early October to about 8 November 1942. Overall, this film was better than I expected but it has a rather mixed quality to it. The non-combat scenes that portray the grimy quality of life in the front-line trenches are excellent and the character development is very good, but the combat scenes are sub-par.

 El Alamein follows the standard war film conceit: the small unit drama. In this case, the unit is a company-size detachment in the 27th Infantry Regiment, 17th ""Pavia"" Division, stationed at the extreme south of the Axis line next to the Qattara Depression. The main characters are Lieutenant Fiori, Sergeant Rizzo and the new-comer, Private Serta. The first half of the film involves the tedium and suffering of static warfare in the desert, particularly with the emphasis on poor supplies of water and food. There are several minor episodes in this phase of the film which are used to ""flesh out"" the main characters, with the most interesting being Sergeant Rizzo and Serta going into the Qattara Depression to look for a lost Bersaglieri patrol. Uniforms, small arms and kit used in the film are authentic, but not quite as comprehensive as what was used in the better ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin."" The director also makes great effort to depict the utter lack of concern of Mussolini and the Italian generals for their troops at the frontline, including sending exhortations to ""fight or die"" instead of sending potable water. On the other hand, I was glad that the director chose to omit any type of conflict or tension within the unit, which so often is used to unrealistically depict life in combat units. The soldiers get along fairly well and Private Serta's adaptation to the front is fairly smooth, unlike other trashy films like ""Platoon"" that emphasize internal discord. Overall, this first half of the film is probably the best and compares well with other foreign war films, such as the Finnish ""Ambush.""

 Once the British attack begins on 23rd October - about halfway through the film - the quality starts to decline a bit. Obviously, the film did not have a big budget and it is difficult to depict a battle that involved over 300,000 troops without spending some. Furthermore, the film becomes somewhat unhistorical as far as depicting the British attacks - British tanks (actually modern M60 tanks) are shown driving on line toward the Italian positions with headlights on! Nor do the Italian positions have much in the way of AT mines or AT guns in support (in fact, the Italians had 47mm AT guns and artillery supporting all the frontline positions), so the British just roll fight over them. Our boys from the ""Pavia"" are sent to reinforce the ""Folgore"" parachute division and suffer about 50% losses, but hold. In reality, these were diversionary attacks while the main British attack was to the north. Indeed, the ""Pavia"" division saw less action at El Alamein than most Axis units.

 The end comes rather quickly once the British breakthrough in the north. Rommel and the Afrika Korps retreat westward, leaving the Italians to fend for themselves (the Germans are shown very little, only yelling ""you're all going to die"" as they drive by them). The men of Pavia begin walking westward in the desert, but soon all of the company is captured except for LT Fiori, Rizzo and Serta. At this point, once it becomes clear that they cannot elude the British and that their chances for survival in the desert are nil, the viewer will wonder why these characters would chose to press on. Indeed, it appears that one motive of this film was to portray the Italian soldier in the Second World War as more stalwart and resolute than popularly imagined. However, the reality is that the majority of the Italians who fought at El Alamein were captured and thousands sought out the British rather than die in the desert.

 Aside from lack of proper heavy weapons in the film (a British aircraft is shown once), the other problem with the film is the omission of any substantial role for either the Germans or the British. This omission induces a ""Robinson Crusoe"" quality to the film, where you almost feel that these men are marooned in the desert with no friends or foes.  In actuality, Rommel had inter-mixed German and Italian units at El Alamein to ""stiffen"" the weaker Italian formations. Instead, we only get a glimpse of retreating Germans and it is highly unfavorable. The British are shown only as casualties on the ground, or in silhouette as attackers in the night, but we are never shown any POWs or close-interaction, as in ""Saving Private Ryan."" Overall, this film is a commendable effort and worth viewing to gain Italian perspectives, but like many in this genre, it has sacrificed realism due to a combination of budget constraints and nationalistic conceits.",1135296000,31,4970,4.830787309048179

History buffs will enjoy this often overlooked part of World War II history.  Benito Mussolini's grandiose military ambition far exceeded the capability of his pitifully under equipped and ill supplied army.  The Germans were well aware of this and used the Italians as sacrifical cannon fodder to protect their own forces.  Nevertheless, history documents the incredible bravery of some of these doomed Italian units.  This movie helps us imagine what it must have been like with a visceral illustration of the futility and waste of war through the eyes of a patriotic volunteer who comes of age under the worst circumstances possible.  This movie will help viewers understand the hatred for Mussolini and why he met such an ugly end.  Incredibly enough, the Italian units in Russia fared much worse and I am sure there is a good movie somewhere about that ugly chapter of history.",1510358400,3,1055,4.994285714285715

Also the determined resistance from the Pavia Division, Brescia Division and elements of the 185th Airborne Division Folgore is accurate from historical sources. The harsh reality of the war, lack of basic supplies and poor armament of Italian troops and struggle in lack of basic supplies of water and basic necessities and last not the least lack of command caused the main defeat of the Axis.

I give the movie itself really good marks for depicting the war in Africa from the Italian point of view and from the common Soldier point of view. In points is a little preachy but overall it's worth watching and pretty darn good. There really isn't much in the way of battle scenes.

The only serious complaint I have about it is the subtitling is done so it's fairly difficult to read the English word as the scroll by. Fortunately I was able to turn on the closed captioning which was a whole lot easier to read and for the most part was right on top of the English subtitles.

Once you get to the actual battle is when it goes from a 5 to a 2 or 3, the combat is laughable and dreadful, all built up character development is tossed aside, and the movie practically doesn't have an ending. Heck, I'm a fine of open ended endings, but this one's is just dreadful.

2336939,5,B0009Y2618,"Though it is in Italian, I found this a very sensitive look at what war does to a soldier on the front lines who has been forgotten by his allies. It does not need a lot of blood and gore. They are part of an Italian platoon all but left behind by their German allies and know their chances of survival is slim if not at all. It does not have a happy ending but does show how each member of a small squad deeply care for themselves and try as best they can to survive. I think it is truly a wonderful film and would recommend it over many others I have seen and I have seen hundreds.

2336941,3,B0009Y2618,"I found it lacking somewhat in the story as an idealistic young man going off to war has been done so often. That war is hell. Some of it did not seem very realistic with  people committing suicide or giving up to die.  I thought the story needed more work.

Some of the characters interesting too.

Its historical accuracy is probably acceptable for such a movie. WW2 fans like me might be a bit disappointed here for example some of the equipment like the mine detector would not have been available to the Italians. There would have been a lot more Germans with the Italians.

The acting was reasonable. Overall, I think these guys did a good job.

The filming was okay, although clearly, they did not have a huge budget, and it showed. The big action scenes I think were hurt by this.

I would not recommend it for these reasons.",1331337600,,833,4.440789473684211
2336942,2,B0009Y2618,"As this is an Italian movie that shows El Alamein from an Italian viewpoint, it is obviously biased in their favour, but it is patently ridiculous to portray the Italian soldiers as being heroic to the point of fighting to the last man, and throwing rocks at the enemy rather than surrender.  The historical reality was the opposite of this.  When the Italians first attacked British forces in North Africa, the British only had 36,000 available troops against 236,000 Italians.  But despite being heavily outnumbered, the British routed the Italians, who surrendered by the battalion.  In fact, it was only the intervention of Rommel's Afrika Corps that prevented the Italians from being totally kicked out of North Africa.  Movies are notorious for taking liberties with historical accuracy, but this one stretches reality to the point of turning it into fantasy.",1331164800,2,865,5.15
2336943,5,B0009Y2618,"This movie is well written, excellent acting and the filmage is superb.  You will not go wrong watching this movie.  It shows a true depiction of war.  Movie is not for the faint hearted.",1288483200,2,187,4.4411764705882355
2336944,4,B0009Y2618,"I was glad to come across this film, illustrating a little-known side to World War II. The fact is that the majority of the ""German"" army in North Africa was made up  of Italian soldiers and it is good to see their side of the story.
I saw this film immediately after viewing the German film ""Stalingrad"" and it is interesting to compare and contrast them.  Both films were less gory than contemporary American war films which seem to go out of their way to sicken the viewer. A friend of mine who was in combat told me that these films show the war from the point of view of the soldiers themselves who are much more matter-of-fact about the matter and who tune the gore out of their minds in order to be able to function.
One major difference between the two films is that the German-Soviet confrontation was literally a fight-to-the-death between two tyrannical regimes, whereas the Italian war against Britain did not have that grim background hanging over them. Italian soldiers who surrendered knew that they would be relatively well-treated, unlike the German prisoners in the hands of the Soviets, and vice-versa.
One thing lacking in the Stalingrad film is that no backround about the battle is given to the viewer, simply its nightmarish conduct. ""El Alamein"" does explain to the viewer that the front line had been static for months, that a British counter-offensive is expected and that that British have a great advantage in supplying their forces over that of the German-Italian forces.
A couple of complaints I have is that Germans, who were running the show, are hardly ever seen or referred to...it would have been interesting to see how the Italians related to their German overlords.
A minor technical point is that men existing out in the desert for weeks or months with no water available for hygiene would have badly cracked and burned skin yet the actors all have very nice, clear complexions. Other films such as ""Flight of the Phoenix"" and ""The Last Place On Earth"" that also took place in desert or arctic-like conditiions did go to the trouble to show how the harsh environment affect their appearance.
On the other hand, the cinematography is wonderful...the most panoramic views of the desert since ""Lawrence of Arabia"".

The final point regarding the Italian soldiers we see...yes, many were patriotic and willing to fight to the death. The hero of the story and his two comrades are given the chance to surrender to the British and while many others did take the opportunity, they refused and two died as a result. Why they were willing to do this for a buffoon like Mussolini is something of a mystery to me. After all, once Italy was invaded by the Allies in September 1943, the Italians turned on their dictator and ousted him and switched sides, so it may be that the Fascist ideology did appeal to the heros of the film. On the other hand, the university volunteer was told to remove his insignia showing that he was a volunteer because it would anger other soldiers who would think him crazy for wanting to come out to that hell-hole.
It must be remembered that the Italian Army did very poorly in World War II when they went one-on-one with the Allies. They failed to push back the French Alpine Army in southern France even after the rest of the French Army was defeated in the north by the Germans. The Italian invasion of Greece was a disaster, and finally, the Italian push into Egypt in 1940 when they greatly outnumbered the British was routed. The British then pushed the Italians out of East Africa in 1941. Only when the Germans arrived on the scene did the Italians put on a better performance.  Yet, the sergeant tells the volunteer that years from now, he would look back nostalgically on this period of his life when he was so filthy, thirsty, hungry, sick and scared.  That pretty much sums up the enigmas about the Italians in World War II.",1280966400,,3893,4.685672514619883
2336945,5,B0009Y2618,"This movie is among the best war movies in the last years and should not be confused with the older movie form the sixties ""Battle of El Alamein"", although both movies share the Italian prespective of the battle they are very different in subject and quality.

El Alamein tells the story of the rank and file fucilieri, common Italian foot soldier, seen through the eyes of Serra, a university volunteer in the Italian Army. When he comes to the front everything is very different from what he or indeed anyone else would have imagined. Thin soldiers, malnurished with no real access to clean water and suffering from diarrhea and despair is very different from the idea of a glorious conquering Italian Army.

There is very good character development as the older men take Serra into their care and they experience their share of joy and sorrow. Then on the 23rd of October 1942 all hell breaks loose when Monty and the 8th Army attack and the Italians are pushed to their limit until they break into a headlong retreat.

The movie holds reasonably true to historical events and great attention is paid to detail (acute viewers with a passion for detail will notice that the British tanks aren't quite right (nowhere close) but by adding camouflage netting this isn't half bad and everything else is very well done, besides there aren't that many vintage British tanks around). Cinematography is excellent and the Desert plays a part of a character in the movie and you can almost feel the dry heat. All that and it offers a fresh Italian perspective on this important battle and how it was to be an Italian soldier.

It comes with my best recommendations.",1264636800,2,1657,4.743055555555555

2336957,2,B0009Y2618,"This movie [...].  I mean it was terrible.  Even as war movies go, it was bad.  OK, problems:

1) The action is supposed to take place over the course of a few weeks.  In that time, the characters all stay healthy-looking and relatively clean.  And they don't lose weight.  This destroys any sense of a viable depiction of life in the desert.  These troops were abandoned by their command.  No food, water, or ammunition was getting through.  By the 5th day in the middle of a desert without supplies, they would be covered in sand, crawling with lice, visibly thinner and more than a little nuts due to the strain.  Instead, they seem quite clean and healthy throughout the film.

2) While it is true that war is 90-99% boredom followed by 1-10% terror, focusing largely on the 90-99% it makes for a bad movie.  It's possible to find ways to convey the lengths of inactivity in war, even at the front, without boring the audience to sleep.  It has been done many times, most notably in both the original and 1970s version of ""All Quiet On the Western Front"".  This movie, however, gives the Italians (who already have a sketchy reputation as soldiers, deserved or not) even more of a bad name.  Most of this movie is the Italians waxing poetic about suffering and wondering about life, while pledging their fealty to the cause of Italy (if not Il Duce) and nobly doing their duties, all with no attempt to surrender.  Talk about historical inaccuracy!  When a man is left by his command to die in the desert and he has had no food or water for a week, you can be sure he will surrender (if he can) without giving it a second thought.  It's not that they were Italians, it is that they were human freaking beings.  Glossing that over was unrealistic.  Never was the word 'surrender' uttered once in the film.  In reality, it gets uttered a lot under those conditions.

3) The main characters manage at one point to get close to the sea, strip naked, and go swimming.  Talk about your gratuitous weenie shots!  If it was possible for them to get that close to the sea without getting shot, don't you suppose they would also have gotten every man jack of them back at their camp to go in shifts up there for a nice swim and perhaps a chance to gather some water that they could desalinate using evaporation?

What is with these Italian and French movies, anyway?  The Italians have to show weenies while the French have to show boobies.  Every single film, it seems.

The only compelling scene in this movie is at the beginning when the cpl from command company gets blown to mist (""blown to sand"" as they said) and the capt. (sgt.?) from the front company picks one of his ears up off the ground and puts it into his breast pocket.  That's the whole part worth seeing.  Oh yeah, that Italian general in the middle of the desert (yeah that was realistic!) who shoots himself after burying his aide-- very noble scene indeed but utter hogwash!  The Brits and yanks took all kinds of Italian generals prisoner and without too much trouble, either.  Hell they lined up to surrender once they got out from under the eyes of the goddamned Germans.  Can't say I blame them, really.  The place was hot, their gov't stuck it to them, and the food sucked, assuming they had any.

It gets 2 stars because the filming was good.  Other than that, this movie [...].",1247616000,2,3350,4.486754966887418
2336958,5,B0009Y2618,"Like many of the other reviewers, I picked this out by accident.  As an amateur historian and retired soldier, I've always been interested in the more obscure services that fought in wars like WW2.  Despite the important role Italy played in WW2, they are at best sidelined in movies and most accounts of the war.

So I checked this out and never regretted it from start to finish.  Italians get an almost uniform poor review (much of it undeserved) for their performance in the War.  Because of that, the Italian role is always denigrated and therefore ignored.

But El Alamein, filmed from the viewpoint of an Italian infantry company in the deserts of Libya, centers on the forgotten men of the Italian army.  It was the Italians who made up the bulk of Rommel's infantry and support troops.  And this movie reminds the viewer that those soldiers had the same mix of reasons for being at the front as even the better armies like the Germans and as much pride as any of the others also. Filmed in Morocco, one could easily get into the heads of the men in their dusty trenches waiting in stalemate across from their British enemies.  Poorly supplied and under equipped for a war of movement, the Italians were bitterly resigned to being underdogs in a war that none pretended to understand.

The movie centers on one platoon of the Pavia Division and develops the traditional characters out pretty well.  The new volunteer replacement, professional sergeant, assorted corporals and other privates, wise company commander-in this case an older lieutenant, all come to life in this film.  Short rations, poor water, and miserable conditions all get the attention due.  Weapons and uniforms are generally straight (except mortars do not fire off plumes of smoke when used), as are the vehicles (except the M48A5s used for the British armor).  The background of destroyed vehicles though is almost all modern Sov/American and will catch the eye of knowledgeable viewers.

The confusion of the Italians as their lines are crushed by Montgomery's massive offensive at El Alamein is well portrayed.  Foot infantry trying to retreat ahead of armor and truck borne infantry, the hopelessness of that in the desert is shown over and over again.  Still they try and do not just give up, trying desperately to regroup and fight.  There is the obligatory portrayals of high officers being unrealistic and pompous but in the case of Italy, that was often true.  Interestingly, there is reference of the tension between the Italian/German allies also.

The ending was quite sober and fitting.  I for one, never knew the Italians have such memorials at the battlefield.  In many ways, this film was both a work of love and a memorial to those forgotten men of Italy who died so far away from home.",1236902400,5,2783,4.851694915254237
2336959,4,B0009Y2618,The suffering of Italian soldiers in WW2 is finally coming to light. I found the movie to be honest and not filled with nationalistic glory.

2336963,5,B0009Y2618,"I'm biased because I worked on this movie but it is a very good prospective from the point of view of the people who fought in the WWII Africa front and lost. No Hollywood visual effects to fill the time, just the simple story told by who eventually survived the massacre, told as my grand parents where used to tell us when we where kids ( for those lucky enough to came back ).
A sad story, a snippet for who doesn't know the history and the courage of the other side of the trench.

2336964,5,B0009Y2618,"Very-VERY accurate portrayal of the Italian soldier at war in the 1940's ""left behind"", these group of guys compensated with VERY little equipment and supplies with courage an honor.  These guys didn't have the equipment of the Germans, if they did we'd be speaking Italian right now, what they laked in equipment they tried to compensate with sheer will, and this repeated again later in 1943 in the front of anzio/nettuno where entire battalions were left behind to block Anglo American troops and help Germans retreat north. again no equipment or supplies. The divisions and battalions most notorious for giving battle and their lives were Folgore, ariete, pavia, X-mas later post 1943 Barbarigo &  nembo.  Great movie very difficult to find ""DIVISIONE FOLGORE"", great one too.",1178668800,3,780,5.174603174603175
2336965,4,B0009Y2618,"Although not entirely historically accurate (and few movies are) El Alamein seems to portray the daily life of the Italian soldier accurately: few supplies reaching them because of the length of their lines of communication, no transport, little in the way of heavy equipment, the German use (or misuse) of their tank assets, etc.

It also portrays the common suffering of all soldiers: seperation, sickness, exposure to the elements, poor food, no information... all elements that still ring true.

Well worth watching.",1171756800,4,520,5.329268292682927
2336966,4,B0009Y2618,"El Alamein tells the story of the battle from the point of view of the Italian side, especially from that of a young Italian lieutenant volunteering for combat and the infantry company he's assigned to with the Pavia Infantry division. The film is a bleak look at how the Italian troops were left to fend for themselves by their own commanders and with little resources at their disposal. The battle scenes are decent, not as good as they could be in the sense they probably didn't have the technical resources or budget an American film would've had, but good enough to give a sense of combat.

Things are pretty tough on the line, water is in short supply, soldiers have to loot the packs of dead Brits (technically I think Anzacs may have been opposite them) in order to get things like canned fruit, investigate the loss of communication with a Bersagliari scout position and the constant artillery barrages which decimates much of the company's fighting strength.

It comes to a head in a final series of defensive battles prior to which much of the more mobile German army retreats leaving the foot infantry like the Pavia and adjacent Folgore Airborne Division on their own. Outnumbered and out gunned the company commander finally tries to lead the remnants of his unit back to the Axis rear through the North African desert.

While the truth is that German interspersed their units among the Italian units like the Pavia and Folgore, they also retreated leaving most of the line infantry who without transportation to fend for themselves. This included sacrificing the Italian Ariete Armored division to provide a screen for Rommel's retreat. Although the southern attacks were considered feints, they weren't by any means light attacks. The Folgore itself, adjacent to the Pavia, fought off several combined ANZAC attacks and destroyed 120 tanks with only a handfull of anti-tank weapons and armour.

Much of the negative treatment of Italians in the war was also misleading. While many of the Italian units were poorly equiped and poorly led, units like the Folgore, Bersaglieri, Ariete and even the Pavia conducted themselves well. The Ariete was destroyed in a final 'screen', while the Folgore by all accounts fought fiercly with or without Ramcke's troops alongside them. Of the main-line infantry the Pavia probably conducted themselves best with a decent cadre of junior officers most units only surrendered after being decimated or running out of ammunition.

'El Alamein' to a large extent reflects the abandonment felt by the line soldiers who did their duty, the resentment of much of Italian writings during the war which blames Rommel for scapegoating them for his own failings and an underlying sense of resentment at the negative treatment given the Italian soldiers on the line and attempts to present another side. Good film, worth a look by WWII buffs.",1147824000,14,2880,5.004175365344468

8070054,5,B0009Y2618,"Excellent.
First, what is isn't - It isn't a John Wayne, Stallone exploding body parts hyper-nationalistic cartoon.
It is probably the most under-rated anti-war film.
El Alamein follows an Italian college volunteer who joins Mussolini's forces in north Africa. The real experiences of the soldiers is depicted, though limited by time.
War is not glamorized. The emptiness is subtly matter-of-factually presented as the characters trudge through the desert.
This version is Italian (audio) as is appropriate. Subtitles are ENGLISH, useless for those in enthralled in ""America First"" educational decadence.",1518566400,,604,5.797752808988764

This doomed the Axis in North Africa.  Good movie that shows the hardship endured by Italian soldiers who were often unfairly categorized as incompetent and cowardly.  Towards the end of the movie, it seems obvious that the best course of action would have been surrender for all the Italian troops depicted.",1517443200,,504,5.275

8070060,5,B0009Y2618,I consider this movie to be very accurate in all respects and certainly depicts the terrible way in which Italian soldiers were grossly misused by their government. Had they had adequate weaponry and supplies the Brits would have had a much tougher time of it. The cinematography was excellent and the acting was superb. I trained to be a US Army infantry officer but ended up with a lumbar spine issue and couldn't finish. I chose to join the US Navy instead because of that. It is historically accurate that the largest part of the Italian army were leg units and were equipped with sub standard gear right from the beginning. The armor was terrible and they had a huge shortage of anti armor weapons and artillery. This movie shows the desperate circumstances of good soldiers fighting a hopeless war with poor general officers and support. I recommend this movie. It is as realistic as it gets as far as I am concerned.,1512518400,3,923,4.668711656441718
