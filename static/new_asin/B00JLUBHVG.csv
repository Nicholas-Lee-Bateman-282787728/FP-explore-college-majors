8652249,5,B00JLUBHVG,"Valerio Zurlini captures the sense of vast, mystical forces at work and the place of humanity within it in the extraordinary 1976 film Desert of the Tartars.  It's like the abstraction of Antonioni applied to the bewildering rules and impossible logic of some cruel authority in a Kafka novel and it's just as compelling and just as unfathomable.

Lieutenant Drogo (Jacques Perrin) is sent to Bastiano, a remote fortress outpost in the rocky, barren and frozen northern region of some unidentified Prussian-like nation.  Among the military officers there, giving it an additional edge of surrealism - are an international cast of some of the greatest actors of the age including Vittorio Gassman, Fernando Rey, Jean-Louis Trintignant, Max von Sydow and Philippe Noiret.  It seems to be a place that people want to leave but seem to be unable to pull themselves away from, arriving and staying almost stumbling their own way there voluntarily, and relocated likewise subject to some obscure rules or the whim of the powers that be.  Orders are orders however, even if that means shooting on your own soldiers or taking suicidal excursions up to the frozen mountains in order to establish where exactly the frontier is.

Quite what the troops are protecting and who they are protecting from is also vague and uncertain. Partly because the command are unwilling to recognise the nature of the threat, treating sightings of the enemy with suspicion or as a trick of the mind, which is entirely possible in this place.  There's a mystical quality to the wide open spaces of the desert that emphasises a fear and unwillingness to confront a fate that will eventually arrive.  The stunning cinematography and the location contribute to this quality, as does a score by Ennio Morricone.  Filmed at the citadel of Bam in Iraq, an abandoned mud city in ruins, parts of the fortress itself are eerily uninhabited, with even the inhabited part seeming to exist in another dimension far from the real world.  The eventual fate of Bam itself, destroyed entirely by an earthquake in 2003, only enhances that impression.

Presenting the French version of the film, the quality of this French Blu-ray edition is quite frankly stunning, the image restored to near perfection.  The BD also includes an extra feature on the creation and restoration of the, Jacques Perrin principally involved in supplying a near-pristine print.  The film is subtitled in English, but the extra feature is not.",1417564800,6,2473,5.0318627450980395
