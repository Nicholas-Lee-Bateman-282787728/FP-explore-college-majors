2884944,5,B000SINSY4,I bought this DVD on a whim and I am so glad I did.  Just wish this series had gone on longer.  The stories are fun and the scenery is wonderful.,1191110400,13,145,3.6451612903225805
2884945,1,B000SINSY4,"One of my husbands favorite shows The second disc will not play.  It starts to play then freezes.  I bought the first and second series and they worked great, but the second disc of set 3 did not work.  I am really disappointed in Amazon.  I discarded  the packaging because I put my movies in an album.  I should have waited to check them all out first.
Really, Amazon I am so disappointed in this..  I read the reviews and found many others had a problem with the second disc of season 3.  I should have read the reviews first.  Now I am not sure about the quality of your movies.",1462320000,,582,4.171171171171171

2884950,1,B000SINSY4,"I love Hamish MacBeth and have all three seasons on DVD. I've had no trouble until the second disc of season 3. It will not play on either of my DVD players. Really frustrating, as of course I want to see the last four episodes. In case anyone wonders, one of my DVD players is region-free, not that it should matter with this set.",1423267200,,331,4.1875

2884955,4,B000SINSY4,"I loved 99% of the Hamish Macbeth series.  However, the final episode was so incredibly disappointing.  I wish they had another season in order for the writers to redeem themselves.  The acting was awesome, as usual which made me give this Series Three four stars.",1399334400,,264,4.822222222222222
2884956,1,B000SINSY4,"I had enjoyed series one and two which I bought directly  from  BBC in the set of three.  The second disc of series three did not play,  and so having never heard back from BBC I decided to order just the series three from Amazon.  Here, too, disc two did not plan.",1396396800,,265,4.019230769230769
2884957,1,B000SINSY4,"This DVD froze toward the end of the series - so did our copy from the library - which is why we bought this one. I guess I can't return it because it's been too long, but given that there are two copies that do the same thing at the same point in the DVD, it appears they must not have been made properly in the first place.

The series itself is awesome, by the way, but this DVD is crappy.",1395187200,,392,3.8395061728395063

2884961,5,B000SINSY4,What is most appealing is the scottish quirky humor of a small town with good story telling.  A well acted ensemble cast of scots !,1385683200,,131,4.24
2884962,2,B000SINSY4,"This BBC DVD set is not region 1 or all.  It is region 2 +4. Not playable on American players.  Luckly I have an all region player, so I can view the discs. Provider needs to check the region of discs, especially BBC ones.",1383091200,,222,4.0227272727272725

2884964,5,B000SINSY4,"Kind of sad, but that's okay.  Loved the ending.  Very Scottish and superstitious.  Will watch the series over and over again.",1368748800,,126,4.904761904761905
2884965,5,B000SINSY4,"If you liked Local Hero, you'll love Hamish McBeth. The constable maintains peace in his locale and deals with the interesting locals. The episode that deals with the ""Stone of Scone"", or the ""Coronation Stone"" was memorable.

The locations where the show was filmed are beautiful. I may never visit Scotland, but I have been given a glimpse of her beauty.",1368057600,,356,4.836065573770492

2884967,5,B000SINSY4,"My wife and I purchased and watched season one and we were hooked.

I immediately sent for Seasons two and three.

We are now halfway through watching them again.

All acting was great and you really connected with all the people.

I just wish they had made more seasons/episodes.",1350345600,,280,4.653061224489796
2884968,5,B000SINSY4,"This was a great ,albeit to brief, series about life in a small Scottish seaside village. If you're we're a fan of the old Northern Exposure series in the U.S., then you will like this series. But you have to start from the first episode to understand the premise and the personal connections between the main characters. For those that are fans of the Hamish Macbeth books, the series is very loosely based on those stories. This small town policeman's goal is to take care of the people in his town, even if it means bending the rules a bit and sacrificing his own advancement in the ranks. He knows if he is promoted he will have to leave his village for another assignment, something he does not want to do....ever. Be advised, there are times the Scottish accents can be a little difficult to understand. If you are already a fan of other British series though it is not a problem. And if you are a dog lover ""Wee Jock"", Hamish's ever present companion, will melt your heart. That Westie has the entire village at his disposal and I am not sure he knows he is a dog and not a little person in a fur suit.",1347580800,,1109,4.336538461538462
2884969,1,B000SINSY4,"I loved the first series and most of the second series; however, I think this set of series began to ""jump the shark"" toward the end of the second series. When ""Alex"" completely departed from character by becoming hysterical, stealing the radio van, driving off into the night and dying/committing suicide, it was a weird and unnecessary departure from the folksy, whimsical, cozy-mystery tone the series previously exhibited. She should have stayed in character and gone back to London leaving Hamish and Isobel to live happily ever after. Clearly, this was a device to stretch the stories into a third series. The third series is just an unmitigated disaster with everyone out of character, unlikely, bizarre story lines, crude sexual humor and humor at the expense of an unlikely and unlikable character with artificial limbs. They must have changed writers for the third series. I honestly wish I had not watched it. It spoiled my enjoyment of the first 2.",1340323200,3,960,5.00625
2884970,1,B000SINSY4,"This is the third of the three series featuring Hamish MacBeth, a BBC production featuring Robert Carlyle as the local Constable who tries to help the locals out more than perhaps he probably should.  But it ends up being an endearing aspect to his character.  This series had some clever episodes such as ""The Honorable Policeman"".  But the really disappointing aspect of the series is the really stretched out plot wise two part conclusion.  Hamish and Isobel end up in a snowy cave rescued by a rather unusual man who burns money and they finally get their differences ""sorted out.""  It would have been nicer after all the previous episodes in which Hamish said he wanted to do things the ""right"" way now, if he had proposed to Isobel in the cave, but the writers had minds of their own.  It boggles the mind in the series how they are in such a snowy peak and in the next scene it is bright and sunshiny.  Perhaps that is possible in the Highlands, I do not know, but the whole thing seems to lack some kind of logical explanation.  It is sad that TV John ends up dying in the series, although in an honorable way.  The plot featuring the hypnotist seems like the series' usual mix of the paranormal with mystery plot fare, which calls for a serious suspension of disbelief on the part of the viewer.  All in all, I'm glad I checked this series out of my local library.  I've watched ""Ballykissangel"" and ""Monarch of the Glen"", so I'm become accustomed to the BBC shows, which can often be quite good.  I do have to say, though, that while this series has promise it just doesn't quite fulfill its promise.  The writing just isn't up to par with most of the episodes leaving many unresolved issues at the end.",1328572800,2,1713,4.469453376205788
2884971,5,B000SINSY4,"Just love the series but am a ""wee"" bit dissapointed in the abrupt ending. I know Hamish and Isabelle get together in the end but you want for more! Wish  they would have made a "" Reunion Special""? That would have been nice. Adore the scenery, the tartan plaids and the local folk. And of course, Jock!  Everybody wants a ""Westie"" ?",1300406400,,332,4.338709677419355
2884972,5,B000SINSY4,"This TV series has an almost Shakespearean blend of tragedy and comedy that has the viewer on  a roller coaster of emotions in the small space of one two hour episode.  The viewer who is already familiar with the venue of Lochdubh and its residents will enjoy the entries in Series Three. More than the first, this (and series two) show the countryside beautifully.  Some of the views of the mountains and the lake are so impressive, I almost feel like going in search of Lochdubh even though I know it doesn't actually exist.

For those who've seen the two previous entries this is a welcome return to a familiar venue.  As in good soap operas, the series characters have caught us up in the ongoing events of their lives, and we almost feel like they're personal friends.  We've lived through some of the ups and downs in some of their lives and have even parted with some of them.  Series Three presents a number of chances for us to see the village in action when their win of a lottery has unfortunate effects on their relationships, their pursuit of the Stone of Scone leads to unanticipated sacrifices, and their confrontation with some big city villains leaves the latter feeling out of their depths.  My favorite of the three, but so sad to see them go.",1280361600,,1262,4.553097345132743

2884975,5,B000SINSY4,"The third and final season of Hamish MacBeth wraps up the storylines and characters we've come to know in wild fashion. The series should have lasted longer. Robert Carlyle (PC MacBeth) is an outstanding actor and, if there was any justice, he'd be getting big parts in great movies.",1233187200,3,283,4.795918367346939
2884976,3,B000SINSY4,"While the DVD's are very enjoyable, they are disappointing to someone who has enjoyed the novels.  Outside of the title, they have very little to do with M.C. Beatons books, so don't look for the residents of Lochdubh or even Hamishs girlfriends.  Cute is about all I can say, a pleasant watch",1228694400,,293,4.615384615384615
2884977,4,B000SINSY4,"My family and I (husband, 13 year old boy and 10 year old girl) all enjoy the Macbeth mysteries.  There is a lot of humor in the characters.  We have found that this series (more so than 1 or 2) has more ""adult"" topics but it's not obvious enough for us to be overly concerned about our daughter watching it.  My husband and I find the village a lot like Northern Exposure--interesting characters, lots of local color.",1206230400,2,418,4.402597402597403
2884978,5,B000SINSY4,"We like these programs very, very much. They incite all our emotions; from humor to tears and the story line is cohesive but varies from show to show and is never tiresome, old or predictable. Sometimes the heavy Scottish brogue is hard to catch but mostly what little of the chat that I don't understand is not vital to following the story. The Scottish scenery and towns are beautiful, the variety of personalities are charming and, except for a villain, lovable, entertaining, and unforgettable.",1205020800,3,498,4.940476190476191
2884979,5,B000SINSY4,"I'm a huge Hamish MacBeth fan, and when I found the third series to the set I couldn't wait to see the episodes.  I wasn't disappointed.  The series does take a jog from the familiar fun first two series and becomes a bit darker.  But I found the story lines very well written and captivating.  The characters were still fun but perhaps a bit more mature as if settling into their respective parts like a well worn pair of jeans.  Like I said the third series was darker, yet even funnier than the first two.  Overall, I loved all three series, but the third season was my favorite.",1202601600,6,582,4.342592592592593
2884980,4,B000SINSY4,This show is one of the best on BBC America. It's a shame it ends with this series. The characters are so enjoyable.,1200614400,2,116,4.086956521739131
2884981,4,B000SINSY4,"The Hamish Macbeth series combines wit, crime, a small town populated by eccentrics, gorgeous scenery, offbeat plots, and the yummy Robert Carlyle. In short, this is one of my most favorite British television series and all three seasons are great. However, while I didn't have any trouble following the dialogue (spoken with mild Scottish accents), if you are accent-dysfunctional you might want to give this a miss.",1197849600,4,417,5.2388059701492535
2884982,1,B000SINSY4,"We have all three Hamish Macbeth series. The first two series are a delight and we eagerly awaited the availability of the third. Oh dear what a disappointment! While the scenery is still there and beautiful and the characters are the same the scripts are poor. It seems that the writers have had to repeat themes (the singing and hockey competitions between the rival villages) and descend into parapsychology to finish the series off (which it literally did). The whole thing could have been done so much better. I'm not surprised this was the final series nowhere near the same high class as the first two. What on earth happened?

[Edit]
I guess the positive reviews for this are based on cultural differences. The third series I've viewed again and I still think it's poor compared to the first two.",1197417600,8,804,4.742857142857143
2884983,5,B000SINSY4,I have enjoyed Hamish series and I am sorry that there were not more made. The 3rd series (season in the US) provides a chance for them to tie up some things from previous episodes. Without giving anything away the series ends on a sad note but a happy note also. If characters with a definite Scottish flare and a little strange twist are for you then this is right up your alley.,1195862400,3,381,4.232876712328767
2884984,5,B000SINSY4,"Hamish Macbeth is a tremendous series.  I am sadden, however, by the fact that there is only the three seasons.  This is the third in the series and the shows presented here have quite the serious tone to them compared the the first two seasons.  The highland humour is still present  as the undergirding for the shows but much of what is here is just good drama.  We get to see a side of Hamish, and the other characters, that weren't so obvious before.  The season does go out on a high, but slightly weird, note regarding two of the characters' relationship as well as a shocking premonition coming true.  This is a must have for all fans of the good folks in the wee village of Lochdubh.",1193702400,12,691,4.3515625
8205347,5,B000SINSY4,"A wonderful end to a much beloved highland drama. Fans of Robert Carlyle in his prime and of Monarch of the Glen will particularly enjoy.

Only through Amazon Prime and Acorn TV was I finally in a position to see what happened to Hamish, Isobel, TV John, and the other residents of Lochdubh. Hamish and Isobel finally hook up (and per the ghost of TV John's da, Isobel is pregnant!), we lose John McIver, and the Stone of Destiny is saved.
