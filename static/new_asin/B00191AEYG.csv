I think it's a nice little story and it doesn't get on my nerves watching it over and over.",1252800000,3,176,3.9166666666666665
3422269,5,B00191AEYG,"My 5 year old LOVES this dvd and plays along with ""instruments"" she's made.  We finally got her a real guitar to strum along- piano lessons were already in our plans, so we are thrilled at her interest in all the instruments in the video.  There are NO evil characters to scare her (unlike the Country Strawberry Shortcake dvd) and there are good lessons about the need to practice to make perfect. We love it!",1235088000,13,410,4.453333333333333

8271556,5,B00191AEYG,"the great grand daughter loves strawberry shortcake, and this
movie was a good one she watched it several times thanks",1357862400,,118,4.95
8271557,5,B00191AEYG,"I admit, I may have unreasonable standards for kid's videos, but most of what is out now is total junk.

Fortunately, Grandma got the kid's this DVD and I'm very impressed.

-Nothing in this video scares my kids in the least, which isn't the case with most videos
- The characters are all nice to each other. There isn't a villan or ""mean"" person
- The characters must figure out how to work together, apologize, and help each other

My kids have gotten out their musical instruments much more frequently after we started watching this video!  And I hear them saying things like ""you have to keep practicing"" which I'm almost certain is from the video.

Finally, a video that positively impacts kids.  My 5 year old son and 3 year old daughter currently choose this video when they are given a choice in what they want to watch, and I'm happy they do.

I was so happy with this video I bought another, more recent Strawberry Shortcake video that is done in CGI, Bloomin Berry Garden.  Two of the three videos on this DVD were too scary for my children and I didn't love the language.  Nothing overtly offensive, but the characters don't sound as intelligent or kind.",1339027200,,1166,4.54066985645933
8271558,4,B00191AEYG,"There IS an evil character, named Peppermint Fizz. We own every single DVD and VHS with her in it, and she's evil (like a villian.). She DOES become nice in the end. But she'll scare your daughter.",1336176000,,197,4.351351351351352
8271559,5,B00191AEYG,"Our 2-year-old loves this DVD.  There is enough going on to keep her entertained but a pace she can handle.  The songs are very catchy and she sings them even when the DVD is off.  She plays air guitar and dances with Strawberry and friends.  As an adult, it's one her movies I enjoy watching with her.  Fun story and Custard the cat is just sarcastic enough to make me laugh.  If your child likes Strawberry and music, you can't go wrong with Rockaberry Roll.",1326153600,,460,4.352941176470588
8271560,5,B00191AEYG,"I bought these DVDs for my daughter who loves these DVDs. THe DVDs are of very high quality.  I do not see this quality for those I bring from library now and then.

I recommend Amazon as the wonderful shopping site for better prices..",1276992000,,235,4.318181818181818
