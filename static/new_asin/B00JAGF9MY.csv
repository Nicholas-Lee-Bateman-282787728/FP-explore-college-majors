8649419,5,B00JAGF9MY,"This is a wonderful movie. In a dark time in the world's history amidst so much pain / suffering, it is more than good to be reminded that the heart of the human spirit can absolutely be filled with love and joy. Tiz a great pleasure to see who James Broughton was , to see clips of his films and to hear stories of friends/ family who knew , worked with, and loved him. ""Big Joy"" shows how a unique , unusual soul, could face the bleakness in our society and yet live a very creative, happy life in the twentieth century. James B dealt with the same demons / depressions that confront most all of us, but he used inspiration from within and without to guide his choices to do what he wanted /needed to do , thus got to lead a full life and then died, not worn-out but spent out, lived out, a fulfilled old man. Mazeltov ! Congratulations to the film's makers & deep appreciation to Broughton's friends and fans who brought James' joy into this delightful film.",1425427200,4,961,4.285714285714286

Exceptional historical footage coupled with rare interviews is woven together forming a unique tapestry that brings to light the work of a very gifted writer and film maker. The films title is perfect because there is no escape from the direct experience of joy. The editing and soundtrack are remarkable. I highly recommend this film.,1419811200,3,475,5.012658227848101
