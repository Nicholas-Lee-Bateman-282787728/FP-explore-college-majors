2724589,4,B00005JPTT,"Picture this: Genetically mutated monster sheep run amok on a remote New Zealand farm. The concept alone is enough to get B horror fans excited. But can a story about killer sheep really provide enough entertainment for a feature film without running out of gas? Writer/director Jonathan King, with special effects help from Peter Jackson's WETA workshop, proves that it can in.

When two animal rights activist's attempt to steal away with some lab specimens, they do more harm than good, releasing a dangerous experimental sheep fetus-monster whose bite is infectious in a style reminiscent of the Sumatran rat-monkey bite in Peter Jackson's gory classic Dead Alive. Infected sheep turn into rabid human-hunting carnivores; imagine a 28 Days Later where it's the sheep that are infected with rage. Meanwhile, humans that get bitten slowly morph into gigantic powerful were-sheep creatures. In both cases, the special effects are incredible. Very little CGI is used, making for more realistic monsters and more intense deaths, both of which fans of the genre will cheer for.

The underlying story about a young man with a crippling sheep phobia, the result of a traumatizing impish prank from his childhood, is decidedly light, but still makes for decent cinematic fare. Obviously, he has to overcome his improbable fear over the course of the film, while buckets of blood and guts are poured on everyone in sight. As the DVD case clearly states, this film is ""not for the weak of stomach."" Though the gore gets pretty intense, Black Sheep is still a good-natured comedy romp at its core and the jokes and sight gags keep the film from settling into generic B horror complacence.

""Can a schlocky horror comedy about weird sheep be perfect? Why not?"" asks a WETA workshop prop maker in the information-rich ""making of"" featurette included on the DVD. It's a good question and not a simple one to answer; though this comedy/horror hybrid has its flaws, fans of low-concept B horror movies will be hard-pressed to find a more expertly executed example of the nature-gone-wild creepfest.",1191628800,6,2085,5.055232558139535

2724591,1,B00005JPTT,"I saw this with a few people who, like myself, love various types of genres. We had garnered tickets at it's premier at a film festival and wasn't of course expecting Oscar material or even anything close to a Danny Boyles film. Around the 45 minute mark, we leaned over to each other several times wondering what we were doing here, and if we wanted to leave. Any comparison at all, like other reviewers, comparing this mess to a George A. Romero film or the 28 series is simply ludicrous and a disgrace to their work. (although if you are a fan of the Asia Argento mess, you will probably consider this one of the finest films of its kind, oh my.) This film is phony, it's characters are wooden and undeniably lackluster. I understand that the film is supposed to be a farce, but truly it must be for a certain type of film lover.

Other reviews talk about how funny it was, well no one laughed hardly at all in the packed theatre and I am assuming most of them were fanatics of this type of genre, unless they were given tickets and expected something like Out of Africa, but I hardly doubt that. Did Leslie Neilson accidentally direct this?

I have compiled a list of ideas for you other than waste your time on this stupid, adolescent cornucopia of absurdity:

1. rent 'Gummy', gouge your eyes out with lead pencils and gnaw on the rubber ends.

2. find a good book, perhaps Rosie's new toiletbowl trash and draw small figments of your imagination in the margins, realizing you would be actually creating something tangible, whereas your viewing of this movie will make you a prize idiot.

3. Go rent some equipment, get a student cinematographer, a few extras, take an add out in the paper, go get a permit to film in the sewers of manhattan, and a decent torch. Write a quick scenario in your head, throw it at the ensemble, get some fake blood, and a generator to play Silent Hill on on xbox for inspiration, do a few takes, have some talking zombie whores from the Port Authority bus terminal eating raw flesh from an Anne Coulter type, and you may just find yourself at a film festival.",1189641600,6,2096,4.447916666666667

2724594,4,B00005JPTT,"This is a pitch black horror comedy with special effects by Peter Jackson's company.  And it concerns sheep.  That's right, mutated, ravenous, lycanthropic sheep roaming the New Zealand countryside for victims.  When one of the wooly buggers bites you, as befitting the legend of such a creature, you transform into a sheep yourself.  In fact, one of the characters in transition tells a group of people "" I'll be baaaaa-ck.""  Okay, if you can get past the ridiculous premise of this movie, you are going to have a lot of fun.  To the actors' credit, they make you care about their characters amidst all the wool bearing.  There are some sly visual gags and enough gore to satisfy the wolf in sheeps clothing.

If you enjoy movies such as Shaun of the Dead, Army of Darkness, or Dead Alive then you will probably enjoy this.

Horror comedy is a really hit or miss genre. They are either really funny balancing the horror aspect to create situations that would be terrifying in real life but in context are hilarious, or immensely stupid totally making fun of the horror aspect and turn out very annoying. This movie is luckily the former. The plot of this movie allows for all kinds of comical moments. This film doesn't pretend to even an ounce of seriousness. Everything is a huge joke, beginning by the very idea of anthropophagic sheeps and jokes begin already on the DVD main menu. Humor mostly doesn't fly very high (sheep farts play an important role)  A great lot of more sophisticated jokes concern a guy with ovinophobia (pretty tough on a sheep farm) and two extremely radical environment activists, a lame guy and a cute girl named respectively Grant and Experience... at one moment some of the sheep will turn really ""baaaaad""...

There is a lot of gore and violence in this film but they are showed in such a ridiculously cheap way that the effect is just to encourage more laughter.  Because of violence and language it is a grown up film - rather not for those younger than 18. Oh, and if you are a vegetarian you will definitely NOT like ""Black sheep""...  Bottom line, this is a surprisingly relaxing, completely idiotic but highly entertaining very black comedy.

SPOILER ALERT  A young Henry Oldfield (Nick Fenton) lives on a sheep farm in New Zealand, with his father and older brother, Angus. After witnessing his father's pride in Henry's natural ability at farming, Angus plays a cruel prank on him involving the bloody corpse of his pet sheep, just moments before Mrs. Mac, the farm's housekeeper, comes to tell the boys that their father has been killed in an accident. The combined shock of these two incidents leads Henry to develop a crippling phobia of sheep.

Fifteen years later, Henry (Nathan Meister) returns home to sell his share of the family farm to Angus (Peter Feeney). Unknown to Henry, Angus is carrying out secret genetic experiments that transform sheep from docile vegetarians into ferocious carnivores whose bite can transform a human into a bloodthirsty half-sheep monstrosity called weresheep (part demon and part mutant). While trying to expose Angus's experiments, a pair of environmental activists named Grant (Oliver Driver) and Experience (Danielle Mason) steal a mutant lamb (meant for disposal) preserved in a container, but accidentally release it when Grant slips and drops the container, causing it to smash open. As Grant and Experience flee from the scientists, the lamb bites Grant and infects him. The lamb then escapes into the fields and infects the flocks of sheep.

Meanwhile, Henry and old friend, Tucker (Tammy Davis), the farm manager, decide to take a drive on the farm. Tucker sees a sheep that refuses to run away. At the same time, Experience steals a rifle from the car to try to shoot them. They eventually team up with each other to investigate a farm house that has smoke pouring out of it. Inside they find the mutilated body of a farmer. Henry sees a sheep in the hallway and, because of his phobia, he quietly shuts the door and locks it. The sheep tries to crash through the door. Tucker shoots the sheep. On the other end of the farm, Angus is driving around when he sees Grant. Grant bites Angus on the hand and runs off.

Back in the car, Tucker, Experience, and Henry leave to warn Angus about the killer sheep, but a sheep hiding in the car bites Tucker. Tucker, Experience, and Henry manage to escape the car, with the sheep still inside, moments before it drives down the same cliff where Angus and Henry's father fell to his death. After the car is destroyed, they seek refuge in the laboratory, encountering a sheep hung up with its underside open, alive. Henry and Tucker finally realize that Angus is conducting cruel experiments. When one of the scientists see that Tucker's foot has now become a sheep's foot, she keeps him there for study but Experience and Henry escape when Angus cannot bring himself to shoot his own brother.

Suddenly, hordes of sheep come running down the hill. They see an offal pit surrounded by a gate. Henry accidentally slips into the pit, and his brother refuses to help. Henry and Experience fall into the pit but escape in the underground tunnels. Meanwhile, Tucker transforms into a weresheep, but the scientist administers an injection of amniotic fluid from one of the mutant lambs' containers which transforms him back to human. But when she goes to give the shot to Angus, she is attacked and eaten by the sheep. While Henry and Experience clean themselves, they hear shearing sounds inside a barn. When they investigate the noise, they see something using shears on itself. The thing stands up and walks up to them wearing Grant's clothes, looking like a bipedal sheep with blood dripping from its mouth. Experience recognises the clothes, but Henry attacks him. Grant hits Henry and lunges at Experience, issuing sheep calls. They lock Grant in the barn and escape.

Angus gives a presentation to businessmen about his new genetically engineered sheep. The businessmen are soon slaughtered by the infected sheep. During the massacre, a sheep confronts Angus, but does not attack him as he has been infected. When Henry and Experience try to warn Angus, they discover he has a love for sheep. Disgusted, they leave. Henry realizes he has been infected, so, like Angus, sheep no longer attack him. Henry and Experience go their separate ways. Henry ends up fighting with his brother, who has now transformed into a gargantuan sheep monster: however, only as intelligent as a sheep, Angus is kept in check by Henry and the farm's sheepdog. While he is cornered by the dog, the revolving propeller of the family plane cuts into Angus and wounds him badly.

Tucker suddenly arrives and disinfects Angus and Henry with more amniotic fluid, administered via a medicine nozzle designed for sheep. Experience arrives. Even though Angus is now a human, he goes back to the sheep and tells them to bite him again. The sheep, driven mad by the smell of blood, devour Angus. Eventually, all the sheep are contained and killed in a giant bonfire of ignited sheep flatulence. The cure is given to the surviving were-sheep, including Grant, and Henry decides on using organic farming methods. Meanwhile, the sheep dog looks on from a hillside, and suddenly bleats like a sheep.",1431820800,,6884,4.837723024638913

2724671,5,B00005JPTT,"The idea of killer sheep is hilarious.  In this case, they are helped into their state of unrest by genetic experiments.  They go from vegetarians to hungry carnivores and those they bite (and don't swallow) they infect.  People quickly transform into half sheep monstrosities (or were-sheep).  No one is safe.
You may very well ask how this came about.  Two dimwitted environmental activists steal a canister containing a mutant lamb.  In their escape attempt, the canister is dropped and the killer lamb is released, free to chow down on an activist named Grant (Oliver Driver).  Meanwhile, back on the farm, ovinophobic Henry (Nathan Meister) is selling his half of the farm to his EVIL older brother Angus (Peter Feeney), the cretin behind the sheep experimentation.  It isn't long before all hell breaks loose as all the sheep become infected and hungry for humans.  And it's a mighty big flock.  And the farm is ginormous.  And there's really nowhere safe to hide...............

I love horror movies in general.  Love horror movies featuring rampaging animals out to kill everyone in their path.  This one meets both those needs and trumps it with a lot of macabre humor.

( On a side note, I saw the movie called, The Devil's Rock a few months ago and turns out by coincidence that the director of Black Sheep stars in The Devil's Rock.) Anyway, I thought that the idea for the movie was original, as far as sheep turning evil on humans and found it amusing that of all animals to go whacko on you, who would think sheep.  I didn't understand the negative reviews unless some viewers didn't expect the humor in a story of sheep-gone-mad.  I loved the acting, the make-up effects and the directing in the film.

2724690,5,B00005JPTT,"Black Sheep is  a New Zealand made and set comedy, tongue in cheek mild horror film.  The American DVD cover and poster promotions image granted makes it look more like a serious horror film so I can understand why some reviewers from that part of the world have been disappointed the film doesn't maybe meet the huge body count lots of victim expectations.  Black Sheep is a movie where those involved are just having a lot of fun, it's not trying to be serious, make you wet your pants in fear and avoid ever leaving the city again or give you nightmares, promote an anti eating meat agenda or anything like this.  It's just New Zealanders making a fun film about sheep who no longer are the passive wouldn't hurt a fly creatures we expect them to be. They are even prepared to make fun of the stereotypes of New Zealanders and their relationship to sheep.  For example (and there isn't a lot of swearing in this film) when they first have to get back in the ute in a hurry (pick up truck) and drive away quickly the farm hand character asks ""What about the sheep"", the brother character replies ""F the sheep"" (in relation to don't worry about them we've got to go now), the farm hand replies ""We don't have time for that"".  There's a few other man/sheep relationship gags in the film revolving around the ""evil"" brother as well.  It's always fun when people are prepared to make fun of themselves.

There's scenes that aren't 100% realistic but they are intentionally so, such as when an infected sheep ends up behind the wheel of a moving vehicle.  They are there to provide humour and they deliver on that.  Black Sheep doesn't have any big name actors (well perhaps they are known in New Zealand but on an international scene anyway).  They all do a good job though, you've got to remember they are playing stereotypes of characters such as uneducated to the bigger picture of what is gong on environmental extremist who acts first without thinking, the smarter extremist (and good looking) extremist who wants to quote facts and expects the listener to change their ways), a guy with a phobia for sheep, a money/power hungry farm owner who doesn't care about ethics, simple farm hand, old farm house caretaker who has held her role for generations, taxi driver and so on.

If you enjoy light horror humour, or creature attack films, this is as good contribution to those genres.

2724722,4,B00005JPTT,"This is not the Jonathan King directed 2006 film 'Black Sheep', but a rather good Russian WW 2 film, here is my review from the UK release.

This film is set in 1941 Russia after the battle of Kiev (the box tells us that). It opens at a penal transit camp, where a new Major has arrived; his first job is to offer redemption to these prisoners. They are allowed to join a penal battalion. For those not familiar with how this concept worked, this was basically a death sentence, as the penal battalions were always given nasty and or suicidal missions. Surprisingly none of them volunteer.

The Major then instructs his Captain to send some guards with a dozen prisoners to a nearby ammunition dump - they are to destroy it to prevent it falling into the hands of the rapidly advancing Germans. So far so good, on the way they are attacked by German fighter bombers, and in the chaos, seven escape. There are two main characters, `Father' who is the nominal leader of the convicts, and `Picasso' so called because of his love of painting. He is a shadowy figure who says he knows of a hamlet that is not on any maps. They can make it to his aunt's house and hole up there.

His aunt is not there and appears to have been arrested for spying. Without doing any plot spoilers, they then discover she is incredibly well stocked up on food and ammunition.

Enter the Nazis; they too seem to know of the existence of the hamlet and the aunties house. They have parachuted behind the lines and are a nasty bunch. The Major has now seen Picasso's prison file and decides everything must be done to get him.

That is the scene setting for the crux of the film. The convicts are now faced with two enemies and have to decide what to do. This is a well directed (Sergey Chekalov) and acted film. It gets a bit confusing if you don't pay attention as the battle lines are some what blurred. The clothing and arms are very authentic, and the supporting cast all do a good job. It does have some action, but not throughout. This though is one of the better films that has come out of Russia of late and should be praised for tackling a unique part of WW2 in a different way. In Russian and German with good subtitles and a run time of 119 minutes, hard to compare it to other films, but if you like `Star' you will probably find this one appealing too.",1386374400,,2339,4.331050228310502

2724729,5,B00005JPTT,"I don't know where the negative reviews from this film come from, but despite those, I found this film to be original, witty and down right horror fest gory, ""Black Sheep"" hits its marks right on the nose. This smartly made film by Jonathan King summarizes what happens when human in their quest for cloning mess with nature and turn some inoffensive, cuddly sheep in to human eating carnivores.""There are 40 million sheep in New Zealand... and they're pis*ed off!"". The sheep have awaken and their are not about to take any more abuse!. Now they will try anything in their power to stop the human from the massacre!... A horror flick with comedic tones sprinkled throughout, this film should have done a lot better at the box office. I blame the distributors for that. It's a well done, well crafted film with very invested actors willing to take on whatever sheep comes their way. Nathan Meister does a fine job playing Henry Oldfield, the lead who is very easy on the eyes and has a phobia for sheep after his brother Angus (Peter Feeney) plays cruel joke on him. If you are absolutely tired of seeing zombie movies, I know I am, this one comes as a delight to have your eyes feast on. The whole idea of using these suspecting cuddly animals as vessels of revenge is fascinating, specially when they are out to attack the human race who for sometime has been using these innocent creatures as test tube experiments to better the human condition.

The outrageous horror comedy BLACK SHEEP scores big laughs with its absurd stance against biological engineering. No one is safe when writer/director Jonathan King makes the self-righteous environmentalists out to look just as foolish as the careless scientists. With the award-winning WETA Workshop assigned to the film, one can only expect the best out of the special effects department, and they deliver. The sheep look incredibly realistic as they just obliterate everything in their path, tearing off flesh and ripping the guts out of each of their victims in a hilarious display of comic gore that calls back to New Zealand's other famous Horror film, DEAD ALIVE. Unsurprisingly, the characters and plot quickly lose focus when faced with the ridiculous antics occurring on screen. Although the overall silliness does begin to wear by the third act, BLACK SHEEP is still a wildly entertaining film that creature fans are sure to enjoy.

The whole film happens on a sheep farm in New Zealand and as you can guess by simply looking at the cover of DVD, at one moment some of the sheep will turn really ""baaaaad""...)))

This film doesn't pretend to even an ounce of seriousness. Everything is a huge joke, beginning by the very idea of anthropophagic sheeps and jokes begin already on the DVD main menu. Humor mostly doesn't fly very high (sheep farts play an important role) but I stopped caring about it after the first five minutes. A great lot of more sophisticated jokes concern a guy with ovinophobia (pretty tough on a sheep farm) and two extremely radical environment activists, a lame guy and a cute girl named respectively Grant and Experience...)))

There is a lot of gore and violence in this film but they are showed in such a ridiculously cheap way that the effect is just to encourage more laughter. There is one scene which will probably gross out most of viewers (in an offal pit). Because of violence and language it is a grown up film - rather not for those younger than 18. Oh, and if you are a vegetarian you will definitely NOT like ""Black sheep""...

+++you've been warned+++

when you Google 'Black Sheep' you're going to get more hits for Chris Farley's '96 movie -- which is a good enough movie if you're a fan of Farley's poor-man's-John-Belushi physical comedy (tho i think that's insulting John Belushi which of course is what I didn't mean to do ... John Belushi was twenty times the comedian and actor than any of the 'fat comedians' who followed him, including and especially his own brother) ... but this movie is an unknown gem that i discovered one day in a viddy/dvd rental store (remember those?) and the tag line of:

""There are 40 million sheep in New Zealand ... and they're PISSED OFF!""

made me lol right in the store so it was worth a rental for sure

much like the 'Chopping Mall' tagline made me lol before anyone knew what lol was -- ""Where shopping can cost you an arm and a leg"" ... I mean, you have to rent those movies ... unfortunately, renting by virtue of that tagline wasn't as rewarding as the 'black sheep' experience ... 'mall' blew nearly its entire fx budget on one head exploding and it wasn't even that good ... in the end you're rooting against the teens trapped in the mall, tho honestly I usually do root against teens in any horror movie short of the original 'Halloween'

but this is a quaint little horror movie involving a mad scientist and when was the last time you saw a movie of that genre? and don't include Jurassic Park ... that's an accidental mad scientist ... or more of a dim scientist who is too dumb to see the obvious flaw in his plan that all of us saw before we even walked into the theater) .. .this is an honest-to-god, dyed-in-the-wool mad scientist jacking around with sheep and human DNA and well, you know where all this is going ...

but unlike many other movies whose plots are tediously predictable (any romantic comedy for instance and certainly many horror movies), we can see where 'Black Sheep' is generally going but we are happy to ride along and see the sights, which for what I'd guess was a fairly low budget movie they really got their money's worth ... the fx is better than the wonderful camp 'american werewolf' look but certainly not cgi ... I think you can see the ballpark I'm in even from my poor description ...

but it all works and that is of course the most important thing ... the movie doesn't take itself too seriously tho there no 'breaking the fourth wall' that can ruin so many good, off-beat horror or comedy movies ...

and if you're a fan of sheep jokes, well, I think they worked in all the ones they could think of ... they even include a rather disturbing yet still hilarious scene that is something of a sideways reverse of the most famous scene from 'deliverance' and the question would be 'can you baaaa like a sheep, boy?' ...

at bottom, 'Black Sheep' is well worth renting and I'd think with a low-price on a nice used copy it would be a great addition to anyone's collection of 'funny' horror movies ... definitely go for blu-ray ... you'll want these sheep to really jump out of the screen at you ;)",1350345600,,3132,4.480701754385965

They are either really funny balancing the horror aspect to create situations that would be terrifying in real life but in context are hilarious, or immensely stupid totally making fun of the horror aspect and turn out very annoying. This movie is luckily the former.

The plot of this movie allows for all kinds of comical moments. My personal favorite is when one of the sheep is driving a truck. I found this to be the most hilarious scene in the movie and I was dying the entire time. There is also a funny moment when one of the characters is in between the weresheep transformation and his face changes several times into different combo's of sheep and man.

All of the acting performances in this movie are great. The actors all seem like they are having a lot of fun which helps in any horror comedy and none of the performances were too over the top. All of the actors and actresses in this are sadly unknowns. Danielle Mason, the actress playing Experience, was really funny and I thought her timing was prefect. Nathan Meister, whom played Henry, also gave a damn good performance. He seems to have focused more on behind the scenes work since he did this movie which is a shame. He is fairly talented.

2724771,4,B00005JPTT,"I thought I would check out this movie, from the pictures and reviews it looked hella good so I want to confirm that yes like other reviewers stated it is both a comedy and horror film, here goes:

scientists in a rural area are trying to mutate sheep into eating meat. One of the compatriots of the scientists is a farmer who wants total control of the farm, instead of sharing it with his brother.

This leads him to trust the scientists who are mutating the sheep even when the cost is loss of tourists and their lives. When the sheep bite someone though, the effect is it turns the person who was bit into a sheep unless given an antidote produced by one of the doctors. Then the person stays normal. The funniest scenes are, when the old lady's haggis gets eaten by a hungry sheep and when Henry has to shoot at a sheep that hijacked their truck and him and his two friends have to jump off the cab before the truck plummets off a cliff into a ravine with the sheep still driving it. Non stop hijinks kept me guessing so I'm impressed overall. I don't recall this movie being in theatres in the United States so I will probably try to learn more about where it was filmed and distributed. In the end, the trio that jumped off the truck cab are shown dosing vaccines and preparing them so maybe they can save the city from being quarantined. The man with the gun who was bit, had enough vaccine that he returned to normal enough to be able to administer the shot. Jonathan King is the writer and director, I will be sure to find more of his releases if they are outstanding like this one, he has me hooked now lol. Recommend.

The normally docile animal, is transformed into a vicious killer in Black Sheep (2006), a horror film by writer/director Jonathan King, that features abundant gore, some offbeat characters, and a some dashes of dark humor.

This Dimension Extreme production takes place on a New Zealand sheep farm where Angus Oldfield (Peter Feeney) the owner of Glenolden Station has been conducting genetic experiments, trying to produce a hybrid breed.  The crisis begins when Grant (Oliver Driver) an animal rights activist type, trespasses onto the farm and steals a canister containing the remains of a mutated baby sheep from the lab.  Grant and his companion Experience (Danielle Mason) try to escape with the evidence, but when the still living creature is accidentally released, it bites Grant which causes him to begin to morph into a strange man-goat hybrid.  The mutant also bites a sheep, and somehow madness quickly spreads through the heard.  The result is aggressive flesh eating sheep, that begin to attack man, gnawing on feet and legs, or going for the throat.

Angus's younger brother Henry (Nathan Oldfield) has a fear of sheep, and has only returned to his childhood home so that Angus can buy his share of the family farm.  Things perk up, when Henry and his friend Tucker (Tammy Davis), run into Experience, and then have to outrun a heard of killer sheep.  Later, Angus is bitten by Grant, and also becomes infected.  When confronted by Henry, Angus refuses to stop his genetic tampering, leaving his brother and Experience to make their way out of a pit of bloody biowaste.

Surprisingly nimble, and with a herd mentality, the sheep do some vicious damage, as they gnaw off limbs, rip open throats, and yank guts right out from bellies.  Grant, the transforming man-goat monster also pops up several times, to battle with Nathan, who is forced to quickly overcome with his phobia regarding goats.  Experience is a fascinating character, who is apparently a simple minded, propaganda sprouting, nature loving, holistic, environmental nut, who speaks of auras, feng shui, and carries aroma therapy candles with her.  Although definitely something of a kook, she does become quite likeable over time.  Angus, the madman behind it all, is played straight and earnest, by Peter Freeney.

The film features some scenic views of the New Zealand countryside.  One picturesque example involves the mass decent of the mad herd down a hillside, after which they massacre and feast on a gathering of people.  It is pretty easy and fun to buy into the premise of crazed killer goats, and the man/goat hybrid thing creates an opportunity for more weirdness and humor.  The resolution to the crisis is a trifle weak, with a miraculous cure arriving just in time, and flatulence playing a key role, but with good special effects, bloodthirsty sheep, and freaky hybrids, Black Sheep is a pretty bleating good time.",1283472000,,2966,5.016326530612245

Amazingly the filmmakers were able to contract special effects wizards, Weta Workshops (the lads who did work on the Lord of the Rings Trilogy) to create the ""Were-Sheep"" designs. Did I mention it was about killer sheep? The recipe for this film is practically flawless.

Too bad the final product didn't turn out as nearly as tasty as the recipe sounded. I wanted to love this film, I really did. For the first 25 minutes I was entertained. Yet once all the sheepish mayhem began I couldn't wait for it to end. The movie is simply boring. It has one simple gag...cuddly sheep turning evil and killing people is funny. Don't get me wrong it's hilarious when it first starts, but the movie is a one trick pony.

The paper thin plot consists of Henry (Nathan Meister) coming back to his family's sheep farm to sell his portion to his older brother Angus (Peter Feeney). However, Angus has been performing genetic experiments to create some form of super sheep without his brother's knowledge. Of course said experiments go horribly wrong and the results are the evil Were-sheep (unbeknownst to Angus). Toss in some hippie environmentalists, who inadvertently trigger the sheep invasion, simmer for an hour and wait for it to end. Seriously, this movie isn't meant to be scary so it needed to bring the funny. Unfortunately, after a few hilarious scenes in the first act, we are left with unfunny (not to mention mundane) gore effects. For all you gorehounds, I hope you like seeing sheep rip out intestines because it's an effect that gets reused ad nauseam. The final straw was that the human sized Were-Sheep were utterly silly looking. Oh, and apparently, once you turn into a Were-Sheep all you can do is punch people in the face with a vicious right hook (you'll see what I mean). I might have been able to forgive some of this if the grand finale was extraordinary, but the resolution was pretty awful.

Black Sheep desperately tries to recreate the same greatness as Peter Jackson's earlier work such as Bad Taste and Dead Alive. This movie is nowhere near that level of entertainment. If you find basic gore gags and sophomoric farting jokes to be funny then this movie might be for you. I'm not above low brow humor (that's an understatement) but this movie bored me to tears. A great premise does not make a good movie and Black Sheep is certainly proof of that.

Grade: B

I truthfully held off on this movie for awhile, actually finding it a little to ridiculous looking. (And I've seen A LOT of Sci-Fi movies--it has to be pretty ridiculous to make me just pass it off.) But it was on T.V. not to long ago, and I decided to watch it, thinking I had nothing to loose.

I watched it, and I got to say...It's....unusual. Black Sheep is one of a dying breed--the horror comedy. The comedy--though dark--is funny, and makes the movie worth watching. What might turn people away from the movie is the gore--there's quite a bit of it. The weird mixture of gore to humor is kind of hard to swallow at first, but Black Sheep has its moments of glory, especially when you see a sheep drive a truck off a cliff to its death.

As for the plot, there's really not much to say. Except for the fact that genetically altered were-sheep are roaming around the New Zealand countryside, attacking hippies and farmhands. (Who comes up with these things???) The actors do a good job getting attacked by the sheep, and hey--it looks convincing. And looking convincing is something that a movie about killer sheep really, really needs to be.

But what makes the movie worth watching is the special effects. Although the sheep look mostly normal at times, the mutated sheep fetuses and were-sheep/people are fantastically done, along with the gore. The film may seem like it had a small budget, but even if it did they sure did spend their money well.

So I got to say, Black Sheep isn't a movie I'll soon forget. To me there's only one thing missing: more info. I would have liked to now the full reasons behind the mutated sheep fetus, and more about the scientists, and more on the were-sheep. In the end, there are just to many different questions Black Sheep raises, but fails to answer. But hey--the important thing was that a movie about killer sheep actually managed to entertain me for an hour and a half....",1245110400,,1959,4.566951566951567

Have you any wool?
Brains please, blood please,
I'll kill you, fool.

One bite for the hippie,
Because he's kind of weak,
And one for that one guy
who becomes Frankensheep.

A stupid hippie breaks onto a private farm and happens upon baby, mutant sheep in glass jars.  He steals one, breaks it, and subsequently gets bitten by the sheep zombie thing.  In a matter of no time the sheep zombie epidemic is spreading throughout the farm, turning people into sheople and ruining the serene life of a Kiwi farm.

It's up to the farmer's sissy son, who has the most ridiculous phobia in history (you'll neeeever guess what it is), and a Maori farmhand to stop the onslaught of the ravenous sheep, and the evil scheme that created the initial Dr. Moreau imitation.

The horror/comedy angle doesn't work very well; in fact, I'd say it's fairly baaaaad.  The acting is average at best.  The plotline is ridiculous.  What does work, however, is the ample amount of gore, and fairly decent human fusion with animal-life (think Goldblum in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fly/dp/B000MNOXZ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fly</a>).  One other major positive is the extensive use of wide angle shots that showcase the vividly green, gorgeous New Zealand pastoral scenery.

The best part of this movie is the delicious irony of a hippie - who probably smells like a sheep - turning into a matted, grungy sheep.

Years later, Henry retains his phobia of sheep, though he must return to the farm for some business with Angus.  Angus has been up to no good, genetically engineering a special breed of sheep to announce to the agricultural world as the Oldfield.  In Angus's lab, geneticist Astrid Rush had taken many risks.

Sneaking onto the farm are Grant and a girl named Experience, vegetarians and tree-huggers, they mean to capture evidence of the evils being done to the animals on the farm.  Grant swipes a bottled newborn sheep, ready to throw away in the ""failure"" pile, as evidence.  Separated from Experience when caught, Grant plunges through the woods.  He trips, falling on his evidence jar and breaking it.  Funny, the little bugger inside is still alive, and takes a lively bite off Grant before heading off for the sheep herds.  It's up to Henry and Experience to control the rabid sheep.  Infection is inevitable, and those humans who are infected begin to transform into sheep ... blood hungry sheep.

Take a silly premise, add one of the more cuddly animals on the planet, toss in some blood and gore, mix lightly with comedy, and you have 'Black Sheep'.  I had to laugh every time I saw one of the rabid sheep attacking, it just seemed so funny.  But there are many other succulent scenes to add, like a gooey carcass pit, a bloody, skinned hanging sheep that's still alive, gory neck bites, amputations, airplane mishaps, unit pulling, and more.

Have you heard about an attack of carnivorous mutant sheep? Well, they are in New Zealand, and they happen to star in this movie. ""Black sheep"" is a black comedy horror film that stands out from the herd. Given the number of horror movies released these days, that is no small feat.

Everything begins when Angus (Peter Feeney), the owner of an idyllic ranch, decides to genetically alter his sheep in order to earn more money. Things get out of hand, though, due to a freak accident that releases an experimental fetus, whose bite turns normal sheep into deranged ones with a lot of extra teeth and an unhealthy apetite for human meat. As if that were not enough, people bitten by these contaminated sheep turn into monsters that join the killer herd. Angus' sheep-phobic brother Henry (Nathan Meister) is the unlikely heroe that will try to save the day.

This is obviously a ridiculous plot, but it is original and carried out in such a way that makes you laugh despite yourself. I'm not a fan of horror movies, but I really liked this one. There is a lot of gore, but there are many funny spoofs that help you not to take it too seriously.

On the whole, I can say that I liked ""Black sheep"", and that I'm certain that writer/director Jonathan King is highly likely to make many interesting movies in the future, if he continues along the path he has begun with his debut feature. Recommended...

From New Zealand comes ""Black Sheep,"" an affectionate, tongue-in-cheek salute to all those wacky z-grade horror movies in which a fed-up Mother Nature finally exacts her revenge on a hubristic mankind that feels it has the God-given right to subdue and manipulate all other forms of life on the planet for its own self-serving ends.  The hubris, in this case, comes in the form of a farmer, Angus Oldfield, and his team of scientists who have come up with a race of genetically-engineered sheep that not only attack people but transform their victims into sheep/human hybrids at the same time (if they haven`t fully devoured them first, that is).  Henry Oldfield (Nathan Meister) is Angus' younger brother who has had a phobia about sheep ever since the day when the mean-spirited Angus slaughtered Henry's pet lamb and dressed up in its denuded skin just to freak the poor boy out.  Now after years spent in therapy trying to overcome this ""irrational"" phobia, Henry suddenly finds that his greatest fears have indeed become a reality, as he runs for his life from herds of killer sheep bent on his destruction.  And humanity sure does get its long-overdue comeuppance here!

Combining deliberately cheesy special effects with an abundance of junior-high-level gross-out sight gags, ""Black Sheep,"" which was written and directed by Jonathan King, should appeal to all diehard fans of low-budget, B-movie schlock.  Some of the humor is obvious and strained at times, but the ideas are generally clever, the performances knowing, and the spirit one of unflagging good fun.

2724828,4,B00005JPTT,"""Black Sheep"" never came to my local art house and I can somewhat see why.  It's a combination of horror and Brit dark comedy that's appealing to a truly demented flock.

It's a tale of three brothers who lose their father to an untimely accident.  Throw in a bit of genetic engineering gone badly wrong and a pair of thieves. Oh, and an animal rights protester as well. And I'm not even going into Woolies gone Were.

If you like comic horror, I suspect you are going to LOVE this movie.  WARNING:  You will never be about to 'count sheep' on a sleepless night again.

'Black Sheep' then, should be ahead before it starts.  These God-annoying creatures are already stalking the British countryside, so Heaven knows what's lurking on the shrouded plains of Russia,  China and elsewhere......

So, mad scientists hiding away in the green expanses of New Zealand is a solid premise (horror and comedy being the only genres that need to have some basis in reality, as they're the two which demand the greatest suspension of disbelief), and you'd think we'd be well on our way to a kicking eco-thriller with splashing gore and in-your-face gags but beneath the surface, a serious treatise on how we put upon our world, and...what we put in ourselves (a nightmare of horror  in itself!).

Unfortunately, 'Black Sheep' is so wayward and clumsy, it negates all these factors almost immediately. The gore is no-where near splashy enough('if in doubt - more gore!!') and the jokes, with a couple exceptions, are too low-brow, too coarse, and rarely find their targets.

The acting is strange. Neither tongue-in-cheek subtle, or wild and unrestrained, just sort of staid in the centre. You don't really want to cheer for ANY of the characters. The hero is a bit of a big-girls-blouse-with-a-phobia(guess what of...go on, I bet you can't), and the heroine is a totally predictable, stereotypical, vegetarian eco-warrior (cue naff 'mutton oysters' gag). Can he overcome his inner terror and rescue the helpless/hapless/hopeless female from death and worse?
Ho hum.

Villainy is represented by big-business sheep farmers (a real painful death industry) and evil, immoral scientists, neither of which are OTT or sadistic enough to really gird a viewers loins and get them all boo and hiss. Again lacklustre (and this is inexcusable - not having at least one hellfire lamb-strangler in amongst the vermin creationists is bad on any level), and I'm afraid as a society, we just don't hate farmers enough.

'Razorback' is 'Black Sheep's angular ancestor, and it's a superior film in every way. Funnier, nastier (ie funnier), better acted, better locations, even the beast itself (which was just a big cardboard head, pushed around by the crew) is far more fearsome than any number of these prosthetic 'black sheep'.

It's a major failing - they're just not scary.  They've got the numbers, but not the inclination.
They're stupid. They die far too easily. They can't bite through a welly. That they purport to pose ANY threat is silly, even in the totally ridiculous horror-comedy sub-genre.
We'd instinctively know how to deal with rebel ruminants in Wales boyos. Pitchfork in hand, and blood-curdling cries of ""mint sauce!"" and ""doner kebab!"" we'd charge 'Zulu' style down the valley to drive 'em from our lands and into the paths of 20-ton articulateds. Really easy. They're not 'The Birds' after all.

That the jokes run dry, and the film descends into grue isn't really giving too much of the plot away, and there is a cool ""animal husbandry"" joke which I won't explain here (The 'report abuse' feature would be activated in seconds and, in the context of the gag, would be wholly appropriate - think about it).

The film I want to see is a bull-fighting horror-comedy ('Toreogore'?), where the matadors and picadors are tortured and slaughtered, and the baying crowds are drugged and castrated and chased down dead-end streets. The bulls then get the girl (Sandra Bullock or Sally Field) and thunder off into the sunset. Directed by Almodovar. No eco-message, just bloodthirsty revenge. Hilarious.
Any-one from Warner's or Miramax reading this....? Get in touch, we'll do lunch. (!)

Anyway, 'Black Sheep' gets a star for the cute sheepdog, and another for its relentless skitting of awful trendy phrases like 'chakra' and 'feng-shui'. Being Mr. Freedom-Of-Speech and a fully paid up member of the 'Screw PC Society', I took some perverse enjoyment from that.

Otherwise it's all a bit pointlessly obvious. The makers would have you believe it's the next 'Shaun of the Dead' (itself over-rated), but they can't pull the wool over my eyes.....(!)",1213228800,2,4162,5.101470588235294

if you think killer mutant sheep sounds funny, then you'll like the movie, otherwise.. well, why would you be here otherwise...

if it sounds like your cup of tea, you're in for a fun ride. basically the outbreak started because of genetic modification of the sheep. also.. if you're bitten and you survive, you become a sheep.

the movie works mostly and has some hilarious scenes of carnage. although, the joke was wearing a little thin at the end, and the climax was about as lame as it gets.. also they had too many scenes that tried to be suspenceful. i really don't get anything out of a mutant sheep slowly stalking around. there should've been more footage of the carnage, because when there was, it was great. i just expected more from the studio that made Dead Alive and Bad Taste(some of the bloodiest, slimiest movies ever made) and they let me down. there should've been a lot more over the top gore, with less focus on the mutation and the human sheep hybrids, it just didn't work for me.

other than that, the movie was good. the camerawork was good, there were great shots of the New Zealand fields and hills(it really makes sense that Peter Jackson filmed most of LOTR there, that country is beautiful) acting wasn't bad, and the gore effects(should've been more) were great.",1210550400,6,1397,4.620967741935484

Let's begin with the delicious details. Before the first flicker of the actual film, you know you have a winner BECAUSE the menu screen is hysterical ... I dare you to try to sleep with it on! Moving on ... the ""horror"" of Black Sheep is hinged on the idea of repulsion ... so, again, if you loved Dead Alive, you will see that style of over-the-top ""gore"" here. And, like Jackson's work, there is humor in this ... watching a sheep-attack victim try to fend-off his assailant with his own severed leg ... that's funny stuff!

A few technical details: let's dish! This is not your typical low-budget, filmed-over-a-weekend stuff ... this is superior quality! A quick run-down for you: the film is nicely bookended (no spoilers here!) ... the film stock is exquisite ... the colors are (almost fantastically) vibrant. The framing is more nuanced than most MAINSTREAM films and the special effects are truly impressive. The writing is better than average for a B-film (it does go a little overboard with the stereotypical hippie jargon, but that can be overlooked). The pacing is excellent (not much drag). The location is BEAUTIFUL (watch it just to view the New Zealand coastal area). The acting is ... very slightly above-average with the exception of Tammy Davis (who plays Tucker). That guy is a goldmine!! I eagerly await his next films!! Overall, I had pretty low expectations concerning artistry and was very pleasantly surprised!

Again, this film appeals to a niche market, so proceed with caution. For fun, let's add it up ... if you dig foreign, B-horror comedy, about sheep (and all the obvious jokes that entails!) then this is for you (maybe).",1208563200,2,2934,5.787037037037037

For a similiar premise that delivers in being both disturbing and scary, I'd reccomend Isolation.  As for those looking for a truly ridiculous and gory cinematic treat, try Evil Aliens instead.

2724867,4,B00005JPTT,"Black Sheep (Jonathan King, 2006)

Do you really need to know anything about this movie other than that one of its taglines is ""the violence of the lambs""? I mean, that alone is worth the price of admission. But just in case it isn't, let me describe for you one of the best (in a ""worst"" sort of way) movies of the past thirty years: three brothers, Oliver (Matthew Chamberlain), Henry (Nathan Meister), and Angus (Peter Feeney), have inherited their father's sheep farm upon his death. Thanks to a trick played on him when younger, Henry has a lifelong fear of sheep, and left the family homestead as soon as he could. Now he's back, because he's heard Angus is up to no good. So have some animal activists, Grant (Oliver Driver) and Experience (Danielle Mason). No one involved has the entire picture, at least until Grant, while fleeing farm workers, accidentally breaks a bottle he's stolen as evidence and lets out a genetically altered mutant sheep. You've all seen enough zombie movies to know what happens from here.

Just the ""mutant killer sheep"" angle already puts this in Night of the Lepus territory. (And if you've never seen Night of the Lepus, hie thee to the video store. Now.) The difference here is that where Lepus gets its charm from being an utterly stupid movie, Black Sheep is blessed with a sharp script, top-notch special effects (from the company who won Oscars for working with Peter Jackson on the Lord of the Rings movies), very good acting, and crackerjack camerawork (though the last is to be expected from any film that comes out of Australia or New Zealand, where the world gets most of its best cinematographers). I grant that you have to have a certain bent sense of humor to find this movie as side-splittingly funny as it actually is, but if ""You're a tree!"" ""I'm not a tree, I'm a ****ing sheep!"" (in context, of course) has you rolling in the aisles, you're pretty much guaranteed to find this movie a treat. Highly recommended. ****",1203033600,2,1974,4.669540229885057
2724868,4,B00005JPTT,"Black Sheep is an entertaining horror/comedy about an outbreak of homicidal tendencies among a flock of sheep at a remote new Zealand farm. VERY similar in tone to Peter Jackson's amazing ""Braindead"", it features some outrageous gore but also some good performances from the cast and some gorgeous scenery.

The central predicament actually only covers a very small section of the local community, which keeps the mayhem Black Sheep on quite a small scale. I'm not sure if this helps or hinders the film, as it keeps our focus on the central cast, but doesn't do much for generating the sense of pandemonium that other film of this nature manage. The story revolves around two brothers who inherit a sheep farm from their father. One grows up running the farm while the other has spent most of his adult life away from the place, and the film charts his return to decide on the future of the business, which just so happens to co-incide with a raid by two (it's a very small raid!) eco-warriors who are trying to expose unethical and cruel experiments that they think are going on in the farm. The eco-pair are right, for unbeknown to Henry, brother Angus has been carrying out some very unconventional research on his flock, and after a bit of bumbling infiltration, a mutant...something...is released into the wild and soon all the sheep are contaminated and hungry for flesh!

First of all, let me say that the effects in this film are great. Most of the time I couldn't tell whether it was real stunt-sheep on the screen or animatronic stand-ins. The shots of dopey looking grass-munchers suddenly leaping for the throats of terrified victims never failed to make me laugh. I think its all the wool, and some attacks were just a blur of flying fleece, which was even funnier. The human actors do pretty well, all playing it straight, and the central duo carry the film without resorting to hamming it up, again very reminiscent of Lionel and Pacquita in ""Braindead"", although the actors playing Henry and Experience don't get much chance to show any real depth of character. The gore is strong in places, but never sickening, as most of it is too outlandish to offend.

The resemblance to ""Braindead"" is so strong it does the film a bit of a disservice, as Black Sheep is much less outrageous in both scale and gore, but it still works as a fun splatter movie. However, it's still more fun than the mundane, earnest slasher movies that keep trickling out of Hollywood, and if anything, you can still marvel at the breathtaking New Zealand scenery that is visible throughout the movie, while your laughing at all the woolly mayhem.",1201737600,,2634,4.734204793028322

When I finished the film I had done a complete 180, thinking how this reminded me a lot of a newer Dead Alive. This isn't to say that the two movies are similar in plot because they aren't, but the two have a lot in common. Here we have a simple premise, genetic mutation, applied to a beastie that isn't really something you normally think ""monster"" with. That worked out well, too, because sheep weren't just fluffy little abominations to contend with. Depending on the size of the beast, the fluffiness, and the amount of teeth it is willing to lend to the shout, they can seem quite deranged - especially when they're double-dipping into a vat of humanity. We also have a main character, a troubled main character, with issues locked both in the past and the present.
And then we have the humor, bizarre and cuddly and terrible all on its own, making a beautiful butterfly to watch buzz the skyline.

One thing I have to say about Black Sheep is that the previews really didn't do it justice. I'm not sure you could do it justice, either, but having such a good movie on your hands and having it spread by word-of-mouth is a sad affair when you think about it. I suppose that's been the blight of a lot of great dark comedies in their time; you have an idea that seems odd but that works, an audience that will grow to love it once they see it, and a bunch of film critics that will herald it the wrong way. Such can be expected, but so much the pity when the product is worth seeing. The acting is good, the prosthetics is good, the sheep fighting humans is funny, and the little plot pieces hiding here and there kept everyone I know rolling because it seemed so beautifully constructed. I honestly never imagined myself as a fan of a sheep body checking someone until I saw it.
I really needed to watch it twice just to get enough.

Granted, this isn't for everyone. It does have its fair amount of gore, a style of humor that is dark and yet light at the same time, and it makes fun of a lot of different types of people. Hippies suffer the film wrath here, for instance, and so do the varied lot of journalists and business class people. That's pat of the beauty of it, too; not everyone will enjoy it but, if the idea seems to be funny to it, it will be sooo much better than you expected.
Highly recommended for anyone interested (you already know who you are).",1196812800,27,2482,4.301282051282051
2724888,3,B00005JPTT,"Black Sheep is a decent horror/comedy from New Zealand, but just not as funny as the ridiculous premise would lead you to believe. I enjoyed it but I hoped it would be better.
The premise of sheep's gone wild in 'Night of the Living Dead' fashion is a funny concept, but it just takes itself too seriously for what it is. For having such a ridiculous plot you would think it would try to focus more on the comedy side of thing's, but for the first half of the movie it try's to play itself off as a serious horror film.
It does have some great special effest's that are done by Peter Jackson's WETA workshop and a decent amount of them. Dismember limb's, disembowelment, animal castration, mutation's, but I still expected more.  The most impressive special effect for me though was the 8-foot tall animatronic sheep/man that actually looked and moved realistically. I really liked the special effect's in this movie but it was not enough to make up for the lack of comedy.
I'd recommend giving this one a rent before you buy it, the price-tag is a little steep for what it actually is.",1196640000,,1086,4.5126903553299496

I was so impressed and glad I went though.  I thought it was so good I watched for it to be released in theaters so I could drag all my friends and family, but unfortunately it was released nowhere near me.  I love this movie and the associated web site and games on there (check them out) and passed the info on to others.  It is destined to be a cult classic amoung the likes of the Army of Darkness trilogy standards for the skillfull combination of over the top gore and comedy.  I am buying this to show everyone I know how scary sheep really can be.",1196121600,,737,4.090277777777778

2724891,4,B00005JPTT,"Black Sheep is one of those movies that when it starts you think you won't like it but then it becomes so endearingly loopy you end up going along with this wild and wooley tail(tail not tale on purpose).

Who can resist a scene with a sheep driving a truck.
And where else can you see a victim fight off a killer sheep with his own dismembered leg.
Another scene involves gassy sheep and a zippo lighter.
Our hero tries to crawl past the mutant sheep covered in lamb wool only to have an amorous male sheep take special interest in him.

The movie has enough wacky elements to make it fun to watch and for those who need it it also has buckets of gore and i am proud of myself that i made it through this review without mimicing a bleating sheep.",1195862400,,747,4.180555555555555

2724893,4,B00005JPTT,"So this is exactly what you'd expect a New Zealander horror B-movie about killer sheep to be -- tongue-in-cheek mixed with gore.

What is most surprising about this film are probably the unusually high production values, far in excess of what you expect from your average horror B-movie. The acting is good, the cinematography excellent (perhaps they had all the extra film stock and out-of-work production staff from Peter Jackson's movies to tap into), the FX high in quality (from Weta, so that's not a surprise), and the direction and editing spot on -- capturing the comedic timing just right (timing is the heart of comedy) while not detracting from what horror you can squeeze out of the premise.

All in all, it looks as if it had five to 10 times the budget of your average B-movie. And it's good, killer sheep fun to boot -- they never miss any of the jokes that you'd expect.",1195516800,2,886,4.6369426751592355
2724894,4,B00005JPTT,"black sheep was a pretty nice tripped out movie. with a bit of dark comedy, and a lot of blood and guts every which way. it's good to get something a bit different, and this gives it. i'd thought i'd seen it all, till i saw this. mutating sheep. wicked. it's bad enough they look creepy already. its setting is beautiful. open fields, endless stream of green everywhere. mountains, the works, and to cover all that with a bunch of gore and thousands of man made twisted sheep. nice going. i thought the movie was pretty good. didn't let me down at all. these sheep are the main characters and they dominate the whole film. it kind of makes you say damn, cause you really don't know what goes on in some of these places. take a good calm animal and change it into a wild monster. definitly worth seeing. this guy, who was raised on this farm has some kind of sheep phobia, and he's had it since he was a kid, and boy he's not wrong. he takes off, and years later he returns. only to find his brother being not so nice. his brother's the bad one, and it's his doing that has made this happen, now it's up to this guy, his friend, and some greenie chick(vegetarian, fight for mother nature) to stop it before the whole world gets infected. that's right, if you get bit, you become one. it seems like there's no escape. it's got some nice effects, some mad scenes, and just all around dark fun. the actors were pretty good. they'll grow on you. pretty good story. i give it props. this film surely deserves some attention.",1194912000,,1518,4.329824561403509

2724901,4,B00005JPTT,"Black sheep has ingredients from all kinds of classic horror films sprinkled heavily with dark comedy, tons of gore, and great scenery, horror fans get a rare treat in this direct to video fangoria seal of approval film.

INGREDIENTS:

One part mad scientist messing with nature film; two brothers, one the prodigal son with a fear of sheep returns to take his share of the family farm and the ""black sheep"" evil brother who is conducting experiments in his laboratory with sheep genes.  And no doubt the experiments go baaaad.

One part zombie film; a cross between 28 Days Later and Shaun of the dead.  More so Shaun, but the animal rights people getting involved has the 28 days influence.  When these mutated sheep are free they turn into blood thirsty beasts hungry for flesh.  Perhaps all zombie films with their messages borrow from sheep, like Dawn and the aimless zombie like people mocking our consumer hungry society at malls, maybe there not zombies or people but; sheople.

One Part Were wolf movie; when a sheep bites you instead of becoming a blood thirsty zombie you actually transform into a sheep and then go looking for food.  There is a part at the end reminiscent of the classic werewolf movie An American Werewolf In London.

Throughout all this we get two of the most extreme sides of animal rights.  On one side we have the attractive greenie who believes the food we eat and farts we make contribute to the greenhouse effect, and her boyfriend who in trying to help causes more death.  Then we have the evil scientist who throws all the genetic mutations in a hole labeled official dumping site and is willing to kill for money and profit.  It pokes fun at the extremists in a fun way.

If you want a great newly released horror comedy along the lines of shaun of the dead with sheep this is for you.  If you like man v. nature tales and like them serious and filled with actual frights check out Isolation also direct to dvd this year and great as well.

The dvd looked great and far from low budget but it's the soundtrack that stands out.  My rear speakers worked so effectively at one part I though something had fallen off the wall.",1192924800,14,2162,4.5595854922279795

And in spite of its preposterous premise, it's a fun movie, if gory, to watch.  I mean who would have dreamed of a stampeding horde of flesheating sheep as monster material?  Nonetheless, with its off beat humor and decent special effects from the WETA Workshop, who worked on the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, BLACK SHEEP is refreshingly original in the tired horror genre.  The cast of NZ actorss, led by newcomer Nathan Meister, is very good, the music and cinematography excellent, and credit director Jonathan King for his going from a scene of peaceful serenity to out and out violence.

Along with ""Feast"", this yet another horror / comedy gem that totally deserves your time and BLOODY attention. Danielle Mason is gorgeous, and everyone else is great in this. I think the at-times cheap SFX are not only intentional, but effective and only add to the morbid charm this film delivers in spades. I love that a commentary, deleted footage, blooper reel, the great trailer, and a making-of have all been included. The image quality is sharp and is framed at 2.40:1 which seems to be the intended aspect ratio (the version presented on pay-per-view was 1.85:1 and opened the top and bottom of the frame with more visual information).
