7969142,2,B00006II6D,"Here we are again, Don. You keep making movies, I'll keep watching them, and maybe we'll eventually arrive at one that we both think is good. ""Black Belt"" here is not that one, despite some occasionally neat tidbits and the inclusion of my favorite German giant, Matthias Hues.

The story: freelance protector Jack Dillon (Wilson,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Forever/dp/B001OST0LW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman Forever</a>) is hired to guard a rock singer (Deidre Imershein,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Skyscraper/dp/B00009Y3M2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Skyscraper</a>) not only from the dastardly plans of the mafia but also from those of an obsessed fan (Hues,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Angel/dp/B005HIBWUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Angel</a>).

For a B-movie dragon like Matthias, weird roles are nothing new, but this one is definitely among his weirdest and a highlight of the movie: as a boy, the killer had an incestuous relationship with his mother, whose boyfriend he murdered, and he now spends his days killing and cutting the fingers off women who remind him of his mom while nevertheless focusing the brunt of his efforts on getting close to the aforementioned rock singer. Even though a part like this should provide innumerable instances of weird-out cheese, Hues doesn't have very many scenes to act in, rarely doing more than fighting and otherwise delivering a bland performance. Stars Wilson and Imershein don't do much worth mentioning either, though I was surprised how much I liked the two songs the latter sings. Had there been a couple more of those, this movie would have qualified for a soundtrack release.

Like many of Wilson's movies, the supporting cast is peppered with genuine martial arts champions, and the film amply averages about one fight every ten minutes, but I just can't applaud most of the action. Few of the eight brawls are fast-paced, with the fighters performing much of their moves awkwardly (lots of slow kicks, uncomfortable blocking, etc.), and even fewer of the matches aren't entirely one-sided. Late in the movie, Jack is accosted by a dojo full of attackers armed with weapons but none of them are any kind of a match for him. Following this, he fights Hues' character in virtually the only brawl that feels like it could go either way, but the choppy editing makes the whole show seem inharmonious. Earlier, a gunfight is staged on what looks like a tiny set, with two or three rows of boxes attempting to convey a warehouse.

The film isn't exactly boring, but there just isn't enough substance here for me to give a higher rating. With the exception of the weird villain, this urban kickboxing adventure is interchangeable with any number of other movies made during the same time. Wilson fans may appreciate it, but casual viewers can find better.",1390780800,,2972,5.671910112359551
7969143,4,B00006II6D,"Got the movie because it has ""Bad"" Brad Hefton in it.  He's a local guy from where I grew up, so I decided to check it out.
Bad acting, poorly staged fight scenes, but fun to watch, nonetheless.",1389657600,,194,4.105263157894737

7969146,4,B00006II6D,"One of Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson's better movies. I like him, but sometimes his movies are so low budget and acting is awful. But we watch his movies for the fights right? Well this has a load of fights, so enjoy.",1355788800,,211,4.170731707317073
7969147,4,B00006II6D,"I saw this movie for the first time many, many years ago on HBo or Cinemax or one of those channels. I was happy to finally buy it on DVD. When I was watching it, I noticed some scenes seemed to be ""edited"" or something was missing. I also have not seen the movie in probably like 10 years or more. But, later on, I KNEW it was edited because I always used to laugh at how the blood was very dark like chocolate syrup and none of those scenes seemed to stand out. When Sweet kills the 2 construction workers, he headbutts one in the mouth and the dark liquid flows out of his mouth- its gone. When Sweet kills Will, he says ""time to die"" and snaps his neck- gone. I like the movie but I don't know why they have to edit it- its not some horror movie- it is totally unnecessary. I will try to look for the REAL version in the future. Hope this helps anyone looking to purchase this.",1300492800,,881,4.04
7969148,4,B00006II6D,"Blackbelt has the feel of another one of Don Wilson's movies from the Bloodfist series.  The beginning credits list about 8 or so real life martial arts champions that are in the movie, also like the Bloodfist movies.  Matthias Hues, though in an unusual role, nevertheless plays the movies big villain.  The acting and rest of the charcaters are about what one would typically expect from Don Wilson.  Overall, its an average film that at times feels better than the usual, and at others, not so good.

The story is somewhat original for a martial arts film, borrowing a somewhat ""Bodyguard"" movie plot as Jack (Don Wilson) must protect a famous singer, both from her nasty bosses and an even more nasty, and literally crazy, John Sweet (Matthias Hues)  This is where the weirdness lies.  When he was younger, John apparently had some sort of intimate relation with his own mother and she wanted to marry him.  Thats just sick.  Ok, yeah, weird.  Anyway, other than that though, Matthias Hues does a good job at keeping everyone frightened in the movie.  He and Wison get the final showdown - 3 minutes of a well made fight with a baaad effects ending.  Oh, and as far as all those forementioned martial arts champions that star, Don Wilson makes a quick finish of nearly all of them in bar fight scenes and so on, so disspointingly, no good one on one's except the final fight.

Blackbelt is typical Don Wilson, which is actually better than many.  While the movie actually has some originality, the action is actually predicatable and average.  Matthias Hues is a delight, despite his strange character and Wilson delivers the rest.  Good film, but not great - I give a 3-1/2 stars exactly.",1181865600,2,1693,4.707482993197279
