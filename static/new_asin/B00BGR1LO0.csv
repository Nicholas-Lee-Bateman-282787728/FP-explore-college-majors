5620884,5,B00BGR1LO0,"Spoiler alert!  I have waited about half-a-century for this one.  The stolen footage used in THE MAGNETIC MONSTER is awesome.  Now I see the original use as part of an attack on greedy billionaires who want to churn out real gold to corner the market.  Do we have any greedy billionaires now?  But will today's slaves revolt against The Machine?  This movie is entirely different from THE MAGNETIC MONSTER; it assumes that Big Science, still envisioned as a noble occupation for just a couple of dedicated lonely geeks, will Advance Understanding.  Motivations will vary.  Lone wolves can either break The Economy or break The Planet--watch both movies to help decide.  METROPOLIS versus The Large Hadron Collider.  Death by cheap gold or death by magnetic black hole, take your choice.  Lasting question:  How did they do the sets without CGI?!!!",1449878400,,847,5.014388489208633
5620885,1,B00BGR1LO0,"I was very glad to see a DVD release of this rare sci-fi film listed here on Amazon but, upon ordering it, was disappointed by the presentation.  The image isn't too bad, tho obviously derived from an analog source, so it looks like a decent VHS copy, with good contrast and reasonably crisp, but not optimal ... there are English subtitles, and they are removable if you wish.  Unfortunately the company distributing this disc have placed a watermark logo for their International Historic Films, Inc. on the upper right hand corner of the film (IHF in capital letters) THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE FILM!  Its VERY distracting ... and its always there ... quite an impediment for someone trying to appreciate the film visually.  So Im returning this disc to Amazon, potentially awaiting release of a decent copy in future (maybe Criterion? ... that would be awesome), hopefully manufactured with more respect to the visual integrity of the film.",1445212800,8,938,4.955414012738854
5620886,5,B00BGR1LO0,"I own ""Magnetic Monster"" and immediately was struck by why certain scenes were filmed the way they were, why costumes changed and the extreme change in personality of one character.  The changes in scenes also reminded me of the futuristic movies of the 1920s and 1930s, specifically Fritz Lang.  I also noted continuity problems in the some scenes - don't laugh- this is the way I am - and then I began to look for what accounted for it and discovered that the German Film ""Gold"" was the source.  I finally found it here and it is a very good quality print and a great cautionary tale in Art Deco style.  It is highly enjoyable and I recommend any one who is a Science Fiction junkie like I am.",1383782400,2,695,4.364341085271318
5620887,5,B00BGR1LO0,The advance look of the German cinema is evident in this production.  Not as intense as Metropolis but the story and the execution are well worth the time to watch.,1371600000,,164,4.466666666666667
5620888,4,B00BGR1LO0,"This DVD is a presentation of an early sci-fi talkie.  I rate it as 4 stars out of 5 for being a good quality video.  However, the film has not been restored to pristine condition.  The opening credits wobble and there appear to be frames missing here and there in the film.  ( The fact that another Amazon product&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GOLD-1934-Sci-Fi-Germany-Brigitte-Helm-with-english-subtitles/dp/B009VK2YPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GOLD 1934 Sci Fi Germany. Brigitte Helm with english subtitles</a>&nbsp;is an inferior video of the same film influences me to give the superior product a better than average rating.)

The ""extras"" on the DVD are not elaborate.  It has a contemporary 2 page article in German about the film that mostly consists of photos.  It has some printed information that is mostly reproduced in the product description on the current Amazon page.

I'm not rating the product as a financial deal or rating the film as entertainment. The film is mainly of historical interest. Don't expect it to have technology on par with B&W films of later years  The sound track sound has the slightly ""tinny"" sound of early talkies.  The dialog appears to acknowledge the limits of early sound systems.  On the whole, it is slow paced.  There are many scenes where each line is delivered as if it has a profound meaning.

From a modern point of view, the science in the plot isn't convincing.  Two scientists have developed a theory that a base metal can be transmuted to gold by using some strong electrical effect.  They intend to test the theory by an experiment merely as a scientific investigation.  An industrialist who wants to steal the process sabotages the experiment, killing one of the scientists.  He lures the surviving scientist into working on his duplication of the equipment.  The surviving scientists is savvy.  He works on the process enough to demonstrate that the theory works and then sabotages the industrial facility.

The film is notable for some large sets that depict the equipment.  I find those scenes more convincing than modern computer generated graphics.

I detect nothing in the subtitles showing the influence of ""the Nazi-era"", during which the film was made.  However, I'm not claiming to translate the German dialogue fluently or be an expert on Germany culture in the 1930's.",1370563200,16,2384,5.281914893617022
8568310,4,B00BGR1LO0,"This review is for the 2016 Kino DVD release of the 1934 German film GOLD.  Some reviews given here appear to be of a different edition released years ago.  As always, Kino has used a well-restored print.  NOT as usual for Kino, there are no liner notes or extras.

Werner Holk (Hans Albers) is a scientist working with his friend and mentor, Prof. Achenbach, on experiments to make gold out of lead.  This involves fracturing the atom.  Its amazing that in the Nazi era German screenwriters didn't think of atomic fracturing for other purposes.  Well, maybe they did, but that would be secret.  The heart of the experiments is a huge and very picturesque machine.  It has been compared to the machinery in METROPOLIS, but, impressive as it is, its not quite that good.

Scottish billionaire, John Wills, contrives to have the experiment sabotaged.  The machine explodes, killing Achenbach and seriously injuring Holk.  Holks life is saved by a blood transfusion from his fiance.  Once he has recovered Holk is approached by agents of Wills who invite him to come to Scotland and continue the experiment at Wills expense.  Holk accepts but he is not deceived.  He has learned that Wills was behind the sabotage and he wants revenge.

Once in Scotland Holk finds that a scientist employed by Wills has already been working, unsuccessfully, at the experiment using a machine that is almost identical to the one Achenbach had designed.  Obviously the plans had been stolen.  In order to keep the laboratory secret Wills has tunneled deep underground and then horizontally under the ocean to hide his laboratory.  Holk sets to work, or at least he makes a show of doing so.  Meanwhile he makes friends among the workers who have built and maintain the facility and learns a lot about Wills and his plans.  Eventually Holk informs Wills that the experiment is a success.  Holk corners the market in lead.

Wills daughter, Florence (Brigitte Helm,) has taken an interest in Holk.  Florence has grown up mostly neglected by her father.  They have very little in common and rarely speak with each other except for things like arguing over who gets to use the family yacht.  She rebels, spends his money and annoys him with her loose morals.  Holk responds to her up to a point.  They have a private dinner in her apartment and sit over drinks late into the night, but he leaves when she makes it clear that she wants sex.

* * * SPOILER ALERT * * *

Wills is to come to the laboratory for a ceremony demonstrating the gold-making process.  When Florence comes to the laboratory ahead of her father Holk insists that she leave, telling her to sail away on the yacht.  He plans to sabotage the experiment and kill Wills in the process, but makes sure Florence and the workers will be safe.

Holk sets the machinery in motion and then escapes by inches before the gold-making machine explodes and the ocean comes falling in.  In an epilogue Holk returns to his fiance and tells her that making gold from lead really is impossible.

* * * END SPOILER * * *

Hans Albers film career started in the silent era but when sound came in his beautiful speaking and singing voice made him the biggest male star in Germany, a status he retained throughout the WWII years.  His relationship to the Nazi regime was somewhat ambiguous.  He avoided becoming associated with the Nazi influence at the Ufa studios but was such a big asset to German film that they even overlooked his Jewish mistress up to a point.  Eventually his mistress moved to Switzerland and then Britain but they kept in touch and he sent her financial aid.  They were reunited after the war.

He was very versatile and appears to have had great fun throwing himself into the role of Holk.

Brigitte Helm was one of the most popular stars of German film.  She rocketed to fame in 1927 in Fritz Langs masterpiece METROPOLIS, playing the dual roles of Maria and the Robot/False Maria.  She didn't make a lot of films but always turned in a stellar performance in both silent and sound films.  She was one of the favorite actresses of both Hitler and Goebbels until she really annoyed them by marrying a man of Jewish descent.  She retired from film at the age of 30 and moved to Switzerland with her husband.

I can recommend this DVD to fans of Albers or Helm or fans of sci-fi and techno-thrillers in general.  I only wish that Kino had seen fit to include some background material as they usually do in their releases of classic films.",1486944000,2,4483,4.636594663278272
8568311,5,B00BGR1LO0,"GOLD is where you find it, if you look in the right places, that is.  This super science fiction gem from Germany of 1934 tells us of a huge dynamo of a machine that is invented which can make gold out of common lead.  As can be imagined, this leads to world chaos, rather than harmony, as markets and nations are driven to sheer pandemonium.  Hans Albers and Brigette Helm co-star in director Karl Hartl's well crafted tale of all that glitters NOT being gold, necessarily.  What was so amazing about this film come the '40's was that many Allied scientists actually wondered if German scientists had built a nuclear reactor long before anyone else, as the gold machine is in essence and operation, just that.  Kino has painstakingly restored this seldom seen gem and theirs is the DVD/BD to get of this classic film.  Footage from here was used in the 1953 United Artists film THE MAGNETIC MONSTER, which is also available on DVD/BD now.  Enjoy!!! :)",1486339200,,952,4.630952380952381
8568312,5,B00BGR1LO0,"This review is of the Kino Blu-ray. Some reviews are of poor quality releases that shouldn't be confused with this one.

This is an early talkie German (with English subtitles) that is well worth watching. It involves very good special effects and the script is a decent one of espionage and intrigue worthy of Fritz Lang. For fans of METROPOLIS, we get to hear Helm speaking as well as seeing the great bass-baritone Michael Bohnen (too bad he doesn't sing in the film). For those who aren't familiar with the fine actor Hans Albers, this is a good opportunity to enjoy his work (another film of his that is available in the 1943 colour film MUNCHHAUSEN).",1483488000,,656,4.655172413793103

8568314,4,B00BGR1LO0,"The opening credits of 1934's GOLD states it's an ""epic sound film"" and rightly so due to the massive underground sets, buzzing sounds of sparking laboratory equipment, and scenery-destroying explosions. Footage from the elaborate laboratory scenes was later used in 1953's THE MAGNETIC MONSTER made in the USA. There's a lot of quieter scenes in between that slow down the action in this big budget production so some new viewers might complain about the film's pacing and length (almost two hours) as did one newspaper review cited below. Don't let this deter you from enjoying GOLD as a worthwhile entertainment with some mild anti-British propaganda.

Hans Albers, who was Germany's biggest male star during the 1930's and 1940's, plays scientist Werner Holk working on a process to convert lead to gold. His mentor and father figure is killed during a sabotaged experiment in their Berlin laboratory. Holk survives the blast and wants to find out who was responsible so he can seek revenge. He is hired by a British mine owner John Wills who wants to perfect the process using his late mentor's plans so he can flood the world with his manufactured gold that would eventually cause worldwide economic failure and chaos. Holk discovers that the Englishman was behind the accident and plans to stop his plans by destroying his undersea plant off the coast of Scotland, but he becomes sidetracked by his lovely spoiled daughter Florence played by Brigitte Helm of METROPOLIS fame. Will he come to his senses to complete his mission or will he forget his devoted fiancee Margit (Lien Dyers) back home who donated her blood for his life-saving transfusion after the Berlin blast or will he succumb to the daughter's charms?  His decision will determine the course of action for the rest of the film.

GOLD was directed by Karl Hartl who helmed Albers's earlier F.P.1 ANTWORT NICHT (FLOATING PLATFORM 1 DOESN'T RESPOND)  and later DER MANN, DER SHERLOCK HOLMES WAR (THE MAN WHO WAS SHERLOCK HOLMES) also starring Albers. Because GOLD took over a year to film along with a French version with Helm and a different cast, Albers unsuccessfully sued for more pay. The cavernous sets and laboratory equipment were designed by Otto Hunte who worked on Fritz Lang's earlier classics and Gunther Rittau, who worked on the Lang films with Hunte, was the lead cameraman. GOLD was a hit with audiences in Europe and abroad; it played well in New York City where the New York Times praised it for its ""remarkable display of thrilling scenes involving excellent views of some fearful and wonderful machinery...  the audience is kept interested in the steps leading up to the denouement, despite the inordinate length of the film."" Ten minutes of the undersea laboratory footage was used in 1954's THE MAGNETIC MONSTER made in the USA.

In Goebbels' diary he says GOLD was ""fabulous from the technical point of view'' but with ""personal scenes strongly kitschy."" Probably the main reason for the film's mild anti-British propaganda is due to it being filmed not long after Hitler came to power and while relations between German and England were still cordial. Holk is portrayed as dedicated, well mannered, and honorable as he attempts to save the mine workers from death as how most of Albers' characters were in his other films. Let's call him here the Good German. The English mine owner aptly played by Michael Bohnen, who was also an opera singer, is portrayed as a sneering greedy Capitalist, callous in his treatment of his workers and his daughter, rude to Holk during their initial meeting, and risks everyone's life to make his synthetic gold. He also dangles his daughter in front of Holk as a reward for his support. Let's call him the Bad Englishman. There's no attacks on the British as a whole and its message about the greed for gold and its misuse crosses all national boundaries, a warning stated in the film's introduction: ""For centuries people have longed to create gold artificially -- because gold is fortune and curse of this world -- for gold people betray, persecute, kill each other...""

This disc's video & audio quality is typical of Kino's unrestored or so-called restored classics (See my 'Buyer Beware!' review of Orson Welles' THE STRANGER) where you see occasional scratches, specks, missing frames and hear scratchy sound at times, but not enough to distract your viewing and is an improvement over RareFilms' DVD. The film needs a true restoration, but for now we'll settle for having it available in better form. Whoever translated the subtitles should learn the difference between 'its' and 'it's' (It's not ""it's campaign of destruction"") but it's only one time I spotted that kind of error. There's a worse error when Holk calls his friend a ""clot"" when the word should be a ""clod""; on RareFilms' DVD, he's called an ""idiot"" a synonym for ""clod"" so we know ""clot"" has to be a typo. Doesn't anyone proofread anymore? It's these mistakes and the video & audio quality that earned the disc my four star rating.",1474070400,,5033,4.921083627797409
8568315,3,B00BGR1LO0,"I bought the Kino Blu Ray, & I just did a quicky comparison with the official France IHF DVD9 release. Even taking the PAL speedup into consideration, the Kino is at least 11 minutes longer.

Other then that, if you already own the French IHF release (& can live with a light ""IHF"" on screen for the entire movie) , I'd suggest saving your money; the print quality is only - slightly to moderately better.  There obviously was little-no effort made at any restoration

My opinion would probably be higher if I hadn't already owned the dvd.

For those in the USA, I believe this is the first official release here, & it's good to have more Helm available. There's still a lot in the vaults.",1466812800,,689,4.444444444444445
8568316,4,B00BGR1LO0,"A must-watch for fans of The Magnetic Monster, which uses approximately 10 minutes from Gold as stock footage. Contrary to the usual stereotype, the hero of the story is a German scientist, the villain is a British industrialist.",1466553600,,229,5.052631578947368
8568317,3,B00BGR1LO0,"If you have interest in Brigitte Helm or Nazi cinema, you might want to watch _Gold_.  You do?  Well, even if you do, you might not find  Gold to be an interesting film.  The restored image and sound quality is relatively low.  This is not a sound sci-fi version of Lang's Metropolis or his Woman on the Earth.  _Gold_ clunks along slowly.  The production values are very low, set design is crude, the acting mediocre, the cinematography and editing barely competent.  The director is evidently MIA.",1465862400,2,499,4.72093023255814
8568318,4,B00BGR1LO0,"Gold is a 1934 German science fiction film that is often overshadowed by the more famous Metropolis, made seven years earlier by Fritz Lang. Directed by Karl Hartl, Gold stars Hans Albers as Professor Holk, an idealistic scientist working on a process to transform lead into gold. Realizing the implications of such a discovery, Holks mentor, Prof. Achenbach (Friedrich Kayssler), keeps everything well secured. On the eve of the definitive experiment, the operation is sabotaged, Achenbach is killed, and shortly thereafter Holk is offered the backing of ruthless businessman John Wills (Michael Bohnen), who plans to corner the market. Convinced that Wills was responsible for his mentors death, Holk makes a deal with the businessman to continue the research while privately plotting to destroy Wills gold-making machinery. As Holk takes his revenge, the millionaires daughter (Brigitte Helm, Metropolis) becomes fascinated by the scientistss selflessness, vision, and integrity.

Sympathy clearly rests with Holk  the pure idealist and loyal colleague out to avenge what he believes is his mentors murder. Wills is obsessed with the precious metal and will do whatever it takes to obtain it, however underhanded and morally corrupt. In that respect, he is a precursor of the megalomaniac Bond villain, Auric Goldfinger.

Unlike Metropolis, Gold is slow-paced and lacks the earlier films massive cast, but it does feature impressive, imaginative sets designed by Otto Hunte (Metropolis, Woman in the Moon). Gold was made just before the Nazi takeover of Germany. Scenes featuring the gold-making machine would later turn up in the American science-fiction film The Magnetic Monster (1953), directed by German expat writer/director Kurt Siodmak.

The unrated Blu-ray release is in German, with optional English subtitles.",1465603200,3,1823,5.5703971119133575
8568319,5,B00BGR1LO0,Impressive Third Reich effort.  When I learned that the film Magnetic Monster had cannibalized it's special effects sequences I was eager to see the original.  It is a pleasure to behold and a revelation to consider the villain in this piece to be a Scottish industrialist with no moral scruples.  Take that Allied Capitalists!,1463184000,,327,5.018518518518518
