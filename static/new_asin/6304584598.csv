901029,5,6304584598,"For Swan Lake, this was an ideal partnership and I have not seen a better performance of this ballet anywhere, ever since. Swan Lake remained a special ballet in the career of Rudolf Nureyev. He danced in the role of Prince Siegfried in 1963 with the Royal Ballet and that production was staged by Nicholas Sergeyev who was the former stage manager of the Maryinsky Theatre. Nureyev gave the role his own identity. He redefined this character by going against the boring and colourless interpretations. Thanks to Nureyev, the male dancer in this ballet now became the equal of the female star. Margot Fonteyn was his perfect match and he danced with her first in 1963 at the Champs Elysees Theatre in Paris. Nureyev has imposed not only is charisma and his skills throughout his career in numerous versions of Swan Lake but he has also danced on some occasions in the role of evil Rothbart, the sorcerer. My favourite performance is with the Vienna Opera dancers and Vienna Symphony Orchestra under the direction of John Lanchbery. Fonteyn and Nureyev created the original choreography of Le Lac Des Cygnes under the direction of Nureyev with costumes and decors done by Nicholas Georgiadis. This film was captured by Unitel in 1964 and the production became an artistic mega event. At the final performance of the premier in Vienna, Fonteyn and Nureyev received eighty nine curtain calls and this is the highest number that has ever been taken, anywhere.",1457654400,,1455,4.894736842105263

901111,5,6304584598,"It's romantic classicism at its best. If you've never seen Fonteyn and Nureyev dance, their style is more lyrical than the more showy exhibitionist style we see today, and it is just beautiful to watch them dance.  The Nureyev choreography  is satisfying, but I keep comparing this version to the Kevin McEnzie version on dvd with Gillian Murphy and Angel Corella, and I think McEnzie's has an edge on the choreography. McEnzie shows the story more explicitly, with his introduction showing how the maiden became a swan, his very entertaining first act (after all, it is a birthday party), and a larger role to the prince's friend.  The Nureyev version focus is on the Prince with more solo for Nureyev (which is ok because he is fabulous).  The costumes and sets are beautiful, and the booklet explains that Nureyev's 2nd act kept the Ivanov version almost intact (only change is the dance for the large swans from 2 to 4 dancers), and kept the Petipa Black Swan (which is all that's left of the Petipa choreography).  This swan lake is a MUST have.",1420588800,6,1050,4.715846994535519

901116,4,6304584598,"I had the great fortune of seeing this pair dance  ""Romeo and Juliet"" back in the 60's.  It made a mark in my psyche that has never disappeared.  I did see Nureyev again, dancing solo, which was great but didn't match up to my original experience of him.  So, I was very happy when a local art house announced a viewing of this performance of ""Swan Lake.""  I didn't even know it existed and was quite eager to see this magical duo together again.

The theater which often contains only a handful of viewers was packed.  I suppose my expectations were too high as that sometimes leads to disappointment.  Actually, during the performance I was right there on the edge of my seat, practically holding my breath.  It wasn't until later that I realized i was curiously unmoved by what I'd thought would be another remarkable performance.

I'm not a dancer or a student of dance so forgive me if my opinions are silly to those of you who may be.  The first thing that bothered me were the colors of the  costumes of the people in court...so much dreary brown, ugly orange and sickening ochre.  At first I wondered why these colors were chosen but later it occurred to me that the problem might have happened in the restoration of the film;  there were very few blue tones or clear reds.  The dancing of the corps, too, was leaden and uninspiring.  True, it was written as a show piece, not just a vehicle for a duo so we sat through many group dances waiting for the stars.  They could have been wonderfully entertaining, as are those in  ""Nutcracker""  but here they were just dull and in more ugly brown costumes. It looked like a bad Halloween party.

The many scenes with the swans were wonderful. Fortunately they were all in white!  I thought of Degas.

As for the stars, Fontaine was as lovely as I remembered.  When she first appeared, it seemed as if she didn't have bones in her arms, her fluttering was so fluid.  Then the sweet bird like movements of her head were equally amazing and touching.  True, she had danced this role many times; she obviously had it mastered the way no one else could have done.  The big disappointment to me was Nureyev.  He choreographed the performance and, as others here have mentioned, it seems that he shifted the show to showcase his talents adding solos for himself.  I'd always been impressed by his passion as well as his technique but here I failed to be moved by his solo dancing.  It smacked of ego. It wasn't until the two danced together that some of the magic began to emerge.  She leaned in to him as a fragile bird would, looking for protection and he provided her with his strength and caring.  He is a marvelous actor as well as dancer and portrayed his inner states of mind naturally and beautifully throughout the performance. (It may be nit-picky of me but I felt his over-the top makeup was bothersome.  Since this wasn't a theater piece there was no need for it and it proved to be distracting, almost bizarre.)  By the end of the ballet, the two seemed to have warmed up and there were some touching and tender moments that recalled the Romeo and Juliet performance.  .

I am truly glad that performance was recorded, if only to show future generations something of the glory of this wondrous dance couple.  I just hope that they realize that this only hints at how they were in person.  I see that there is a DVD available of Romeo and Juliet. I hope that did a better job of capturing their magic.",1405296000,,3459,4.468051118210862

There is part in this where she stands on point with one foot and is tapped on the shoulder then she spins in a circle. She does that three times in a row. This is the most remarkable thing I have ever seen in dance.

Rudolph Nureyev epitomizes strength and grace. He and Fonteyn flow as if they were poured from a crystal canister. His lifts are effortless. Incredible to see this performance from a half century ago.",1315180800,4,536,4.36
901317,5,6304584598,"MORE STARS! I NEED MORE STARS TO RATE THIS! I'll need at minimum 10!
Quite possibly the epitome of the efforts of Nureyev and Fonteyn is found in this recording of Swan Lake. Music and movement is startling to behold and can be visited time and again void of any indication of a yawn. Nureyev the lion consistently supporting to enhance his butterfly, Fonteyn. They were together a cosmic moment that depicted the spirit of the sixties.
For a reading 60s perspective please indulge yourself in the true sixties dogma; we were more than just a culture, we were a happening!

901383,5,6304584598,"This is, undoubtedly  the Ballet of the Ballets. Sumptuously orchestrated, admirable scented, filled of enraptured sequences in which the world of reality and illusion are so closely blended, impregnated of spell that encloses the maxim splendor, charm, and incorporeal dances the ballet had known before or after it. The story has a powerful mythic significance, it's both romantic and lyrical where the classical elegance and the sinister tragedy shake hands.

The duo Nureyev-Fonteyn is legendary. The well known portrait of the Prince fallen in love and then deceived by the perversity of evilness will mean for him the nemesis of a great love, swallowed by the swirling waters of the lake to condemn this love and lead it to an irreversible end.

The emotion throughout the work is simply indescribable. Maybe I'm wrong my dear reader, but there were many episodes all the way through which impelled me to recall the famous allusive pictures of the great Degas.

It's absolutely imprescindible for you to acquire this legendary and overwhelming version. One of the most arresting moments of the ballet ever made.",1287705600,2,1117,5.154696132596685
901384,3,6304584598,"Twice I had the great privilege to see Fonteyn & Nureyev in the Royal Ballet production of Swan Lake in the 60's. Both times provided an unforgettable experience.
This production is unfortunately a pale reflection of the magic that was Fonteyn & Nureyev. There are probably many reasons for this. One might be that this company is truly inferior. Another, I feel, is that this pieced together studio presentation prevents the fire and emotion of these two great artists from fully flowering. They were not used to dancing minutes or seconds of the piece at one time. In live performance, they spent an entire evening, in real time, immersed in their characters while making a fairy tale seem uncannily real and highly emotional.
There is also the very real dynamic between an audience and performers that is totally missing here. It is so unfortunate that the technology didn't exist at the time to film/tape a live performance of these two.
For those who never saw them live, let me assure you, they were absolutely phenomenal. What you see here, will give you frustratingly brief glimpses into what made them great, nothing more.",1285200000,9,1131,4.895833333333333
901385,5,6304584598,"Having seen their video of Romeo and Juliet, we purchased the Swan Lake with Nureyev and Fonteyn. We were entranced by the performances. Fonteyn was amazingly sensitive to her roles and did the vulnerable tenderness of Odette and the contrasting cold, hardness of Odile with the perfection of her art as Prima Ballerina Assoluta of her time. Nureyev is passionate and powerful in his role and the energy between the two is captivating.
Nureyev's choreography is alive, refreshing and a joy to behold and brought to perfection in this ballet.
This is a must for the libraries of anyone who is truly appreciative of the art of the dance.",1275955200,2,635,4.834862385321101

901388,3,6304584598,"Ivy Lin's review is thorough and detailed and since I agree with most of it, I'll just add a few more caveats: 1. Since this was not a live (i.e. stage) performance, I suspect Nureyev's make-up is supposed to give us a message other than the usual stage make-up. What is he telling us about Siegfried? 2. Fonteyn is super-careful throughout. One feels she is just barely making it through. I did see them live many times at the old Met in NYC and she had more abandon then. This must have been taped just before her retirment. 3. Nureyev is technically okay but cold and detached. None of the warmth and ardor of their partnership is apparent here. Nureyev has eliminated all other men (Benno, tutor, companions, divertissement solos, etc.) and has added solos for himself. The self-indulgence hits its zenith at Siegfried's drowning scene - the length of which rivals Mel Gibson's torture scenes. And lo and behold Odette goes off by herself to her eternal rest while Siegfried...? I too prefer the ""unhappy"" ending, but this ending seems unnecessarily pessimistic. In other productions, our seeing them united in the afterworld heightens the romance of the ballet and triumph of true love. Buy this DVD only if you are a die-hard Nureyev fan and can't get enough of him or if you have not seen any other instances of their partnership.",1203811200,13,1337,4.742489270386266

after i bought the dvd ( margot/rudof ), and watching it almost a dozen times either by myself or introduce it to a female friend, it ALWAYS made me cry at the end of act IV, never fail.
so,last week, i spent 40,000 of my precious united award miles, flew almost 12 hrs ( two stops, delayed 2 and 3 hrs here and there,etc)from california to new york to see ABT's ( american ballet theatre ) swan lake procuction at lincoln center.
boy, I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!
why? as usual:
act I's folk dance, i can tolerate it like everyone else,
act II ,III  i wasn't very happy with it already,but, i still have hope for the final act,but then when it comes to
act IV, the production has cut it almost into half !
what a shame.

901392,5,6304584598,"This Swan Lake is one of the best I have ever seen. Though the Nureyev staging is very different from the ""typical"" staging, his performance is unrivaled. He carries the Pas de Cinq in Act I and does an amazing job in the Black Swan Pas de Deux of Act III. Fonteyn is also very good, though she is admittedly past the peak of her career. For all Nureyev fans, this is his best commercially available performance.",1180569600,4,412,4.363636363636363
901445,5,6304584598,"I first saw Fonteyn in a live performance in 1968.  Of course I had seen her on television but was not prepared for the impact of a theatre experience. I was stunned. She was dancing in Giselle with Nureyev. Their performance was sublime.

Nureyev had transformed the role of the male dancer, but it was Fonteyn in my opinion who held the essence of ballet. So of course I bought this video as a record of her art.

At first viewing I found the close up Nureyev a little narcisstic but this did not detract from the quality of the first act.

I was overwhelemed with the dancing in act two and the rapport between Odette and Siegfried has never been matched.  Fonteyn's dancing is simple, precise, and without affectation. There is no over extension which one sees today and which  I find rather more suitable to the gymnasium then the stage. Her placement is extraordinary, the poise of her head and lovely port de bras that has even tho this day no equal. As an example see her in Les Sylphides in the Prelude solo (An Evening with the Royal Ballet) when just running her arms move as though there are no bones!

Her first entrance captures the whole essence of the ballet. A swan queen who has been tranformed into a graceful young maiden. One is not aware of technique so wll absorbed is it into the whole performance; wonderful arabesques and balances culminating in the great pas de deux which should be mandatory viewing for any aspiring Odette. Not to be copied but as an inspiration for elegiac dancing.

In the third act Fonteyn subtley portrays the role of Odile-with flashing eyes and  and a different poise of her head.  After all Siegfried has to be able to recognise that this must be Odette, the woman to whom he has sworn undying love in act two. So Odile cannot be the complete opposite in character.  This Fontyen shows as no other.  Her solo dancing has just the right amount of speed and attack coupled with wonderful turns and balances.

In the final act we see the renunion of Odette and Siegfried and the glorious dancing and emotion builds to the tragic ending of Siegfired drowning in the lake and the hopelessness of Odette as she realises that all is lost.

This version of the ballet is a complete blending of dance and dramatic interpretation of a timeless story and not to be missed by anyone who loves the magic of dance.

901446,5,6304584598,"Nureyev had a wonderfully keen practical and artistic sense of how to produce the classical ballets.  Among other things, he realized the merits of enlarging the role of the male dancer, as did Balanchine, his quote to the contrary notwithstanding!(Male dancers who danced for him that I have trained with, tell me that when he said ballet is all about women, he was mostly referring to the concept of partnering, where the woman is prominently displayed;  he enjoyed working with male dancers very much, as we can see in his choreography.)  In this version, both principal dancers are given a great deal of choreography and, as one would expect from one of the world's most famous ballet duos, they dance magnificently!  Margot Fonteyn was always the quintessential ballerina, both on stage and off.  She was also a great balletic actress and did not like to be disturbed backstage during a ballet because she would stay in character.  She always peformed at her best, right up to the end of her very long career.
Some people have been surprised at the closeup of Nureyev in this at the begining of the first act; it shows the starkness of his makeup.  Actually, this type of makeup is often used for this role, but we usually don't see it in closeup!  It looks good at a distance.  It is all part of the fantasy aspect of Swan Lake.
Especially noteworthy is the adagio Nureyev dances at the end of act one.  Many dancers have bought this version just to see and study this!  It is one of the greatest moments in classical ballet!
Nureyev's handling of the corps de ballet is also fantastic.  I loved the geometric patterns he sets for them.  The corps also dances with great precision and passion.
The only subdued aspect of this version is that of the Rothbart character.  He is reduced to just a character role here.  Nureyev liked to have important character, non-dancing , roles in his ballets for balance, no doubt.
This recent transfer by DG is marvelous, both visually and acoustically.  I highly recommend this classic performance as a traditional Swan Lake.",1150243200,22,2068,4.73463687150838
901447,4,6304584598,"If you are collecting ballet, this production is highly recommended. If you are a fan of Nureyev and Fonteyne, especially Nureyev, this must be added to your collection. I can only post my honest opinion since I am only starting to be exposed to the great art that is ballet.

The costumes and stage settings are on a grand scale, top notch. The color theme is very earthy, except for the prince and the swans. The various guests at the prince's birthday celebrations all dress elaborately and those who study costume design, I must recommend this to you.

The way the story is told is mainly from the prince's point of view, and there are a lot of Nureyev's solos. Great solos they are too. So strong and graceful. His high jumps and fierce spinning will catch anyone's breath. However, there was so much of his solo and not Fonteyne's. I felt that this was a little unfair. From beginning to the very end of the death scene, the story focuses mainly on the tragedy of the prince. I must also add, that death scene is one of the coolest thing I have ever seen done on stage!!! I get chills every time.

The first appearance of Fonteyne is also a sight to behold. She truly embodies the tragic swan princess. Their Pas De Duexs are not to be missed. Corps de Ballet is also a highlight of this DVD. The swans enter the stage endlessly, and dance like they were one soul. My favorite is the four swans dancing, hand in hand...I'm sorry, I am still studying and I do not know what this is called.

This is not a recording of a live production, and therefore, there are no applause between the scenes. This also allows camera angles that would not be allowed otherwise.

Classic ballet it is. Swan Lake a ballet lover must have. This one has Nureyev written all over it.",1128988800,25,1767,4.424615384615384
901448,5,6304584598,"Back in the 60's, the balletic duo that were Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn were all the rage in the ballet business. They danced with passionate chemistry and artistic integrity, committing themselves to their performance so harmoniously that they seemed to exist only within the time/setting of the ballet's fantasy world itself. Swan Lake, Tchaikovsky's first ballet, was initally a dismal failure in St. Petersburg. But he cleaned it up, revised the score and continued to stage it and it became a much loved ballet. For a prima ballerina like Margot Fonteyn, the dual role of Odette/Odile is a star vehicle and dancer's ticket to fame. She becomes the character. Her dancing is virtuosic, and yes, as one critic pointed out, her body type is apparently a bit bigger than the very frail, bony ballerinas of today - Allesandra Ferri is sickly thin sometimes. Fonteyn is still talked about as a major star and all ballet connoisseurs an fans revere here work. Likewise, Nureyev was a great figure in the ballet world, a man who would influence the later star Mikhail Borishnnokoff. Nureyeve got into his characters with dramatic flair and dancing bravura. As Prince Siegfried, he is totally convincing. Fonteyn and Nureyev'spas de deuxs are miraculous to watch. The look of the film is dated and grainy but that's due to its age- this is a 60's performance. But it still looks good and the sets and costumes are gorgeous and just what I imagine when I dream of Swan Lake.",1122422400,10,1476,4.861111111111111
901449,4,6304584598,"Having seen Swan Lake perfomed many times and having seen Fonteyn and Nureyev perform this ballet live many moons ago - I am a little biased.  It is wonderful to have a copy of this DVD in my collection - it is a little grainey due to the age of the performance no doubt, but the dancing is sublime.  Fonteyn is wonderful as Odette/Odile, such grace is rarely seen and Nureyev is in his prime - Nureyev always danced with passion and the pair always danced as if they were meant for each other.  There may well be better productions, but there are none to compare to Nureyev and Fonteyn as partners.  I actually preferred the ending of the Anthony Dowell Covent Garden performance - but Anthony Dowell was wooden and no Nureyev.  For the sake of seeing these dancers together in a classically danced ballet - I would highly recommend this.  It is also a joy to see Fonteyn again and not the anorexic dancers we tend to see today.",1118793600,38,929,4.4035087719298245

Well, when Margot Fonteyn danced, every single motion or gesture of hers was a poem of utmost beauty and she herself was the embodiment of supreme elegance. In view of the duration of her part here, she herself alone deserves 7 stars! Nureyev himself also deserves 6 stars as a dancer: there is hardly anyone either from Kirov or any other place who could seriously challenge him. The rest, especially by today's standard, are all 5 star ballerinas, and there are masses of them here.
For most ballet music, the composers tailor made their music to the requirements of the choreography. Tsaichovsky was an exception, his musical imagination was given a free hand: the original choreographist accommodated him and changed some of his part in accordance with his music. That partly explains why Tsaichovsky's Swan Lake or Sleeping Beauty was such great music outshinging any other ballet music. Anyway, music and choreography in ballet should go either hand in hand or as glove befitting hand. Here lies the main drawback of this DVD: the choreography doesn't tie in well with the music and was often at odd with it! Nureyev, however great a dancer he was, didn't have good ears for music, it could also be seen from the conductor of the accompanying orchestra he preferred (?) whose treatment of Swan Lake is so out of line.
Nureyev introduced some new and novel elements in his choreography, notably the use of properties, say the roses, the bow and arrow, and the large clothes representing waves on the stage that at last engulfed the prince. He also mobilized masses of ballerinas to create various shapes, making them as scented as flowers. Even when they are only some simple geometric matrixes, they are equally spectacular especially when seen from a height.
The stage settings are great, the costumes too and there are numerous of them. Of course, viewers must bear in mind that however brilliant the photography was, it was filmed in 1968 after all. Furthermore, there are at times some makeshifts, however brief that may be, they are quite prosaic or even static: Nureyev was by then not as matured a choreographist as he later was, as could be seen from his ""Sleeping Beauty with Ballet De L'opera De Paris"".",1052524800,9,2228,4.850393700787402
901451,4,6304584598,"This filmed performance was styled by Nureyev, who choreographed and danced this performance - retaining and only mildly revising the traditional ""white acts"" choreography. Nureyev's aim was to give a lot more dancing and character to Prince Siegfried. Apart from his over-the-top makeup, Nureyev's realization of the Prince was, in addition to being the perfection of perfection, profoundly moving - the Prince can act!

But there's more. Margot Fonteyn was one of the greatest ballerinas ever. In 1961, when Nureyev famously leapt to the West, a partnership began that many have described as miraculous. Fonteyn's age was fairly transparent here. Certainly the technique maintained a high level of purity and style. Even though the roll was trimmed to accomadate the way of all flesh (Fonteyn was 47 when this was filmed!) and she probably was even more breathtaking at her peak, this performance will not dissapoint anyone but a moron.

Sadly, the corps here is weak and the orchestra disappointing. This is why it lost a star from me. Because the corps is so vital to this ballet, and Tchaikovsky's music so fine, you'll probably want another Swan Lake if you can only have one.  But if you're a seeker for heart-melting beauty, you'll have to get it if only for Nureyev.",1027555200,67,1275,5.004716981132075
901452,5,6304584598,"I take ballet 5 times a week, and I decided it would influence my dancing, if I watched other ballerinas dance in other ballets. I looked all over amazon.com, and finally I decided, who could influence me more than the enchanting Margot Fonteyn dancing Swan Lake? I bought the DVD, and I love it! Fonteyn is amazing. Simply put, this is the most inspiring ballet I have ever seen, and it has greatly changed my dancing for the better, and has set my goal to strive to perfect my dancing as Margot Fonteyn had!",979257600,9,509,4.425531914893617
901453,5,6304584598,"This version of Swan Lake, staged by Nureyev for the Vienna State Opera  Ballet in 1964, was an historic and artistic blockbuster.  In contrast to  Balanchine's view that ""ballet is woman"" Nureyev focused on the  male dancer's role  and in showcasing his own talents arrived at a  breakthrough in emphasis on the male dancer in ballet.
Makarova's 1988  version derived from Petipa and Ashton, and mounted for the London Festival  Ballet, offers the standard Prince who poses, prances, and rarely dances,  and is such a pathetic fellow that one cannot imagine dying for him.  Nureyev complained, ""The Prince sits on his ass for thirty-five  minutes and then has to walk,"" (instead of dance).  Discerning a  deeply sinister mood in Tchaikovsky's music Nureyev added psychological  depth to Swan Lake by introducing an unhappy ending in which Seigfried  drowns in his struggle to be reunited with Odette.  The Prince's obsession  with the Queen Of Swans, the ideal woman, destroys him.  Thus the emphasis  of the drama is on Seigfried rather than Odette, and for him to be seen as  a tragic figure rather than a mere pawn demanded the first rate character  portrayal that Nureyev brought to his dancing.
Totally recasting the  brooding passive Seigfried into an active character Nureyev introduced the  Prince into the first act birthday entertainment normally danced by two  girls and a boy. Nureyev recast this for two girls, two boys, and himself,  dancing with them separately, together, and with energetic outgoing solos  for himself.  Having described the Prince as ""an unusual man ready for  unusual things to happen to him"" he inserted the Danse Du Prince  before the Coda, an unheard of solo for himself conveying Seigfried's sense  of romantic anticipation and pursuit of the ideal.
In the second act  lakeside scene with the swans Odette's charms are usually displayed for  Seigfried by his hunting companion, Bonno.  Nureyev dispensed with Bonno  entirely and took all the steps for himself.  The result is a perfect  bonding between the Prince and Odette.  His coupling with Fonteyn was  sublime, and in a ballet traditionally reserved for the display of the  ballerina's technique the inspiration that he brought to his role created a  synergism of ever more dramatic expression between them.
Nureyev left act  three essentially unchanged since the danser's role is so prominent  although he added steps as bravura as Odile's including a series of  whipping turns to match her famous 32 fouettes.  Fonteyn's Odile was more  sweetly flirtatious than coldly dazzling and cunning.  In Makarova's  version Evelynn Hart very effectively projected the pride, arrogancce, and  disdain underneath Odile's seductiveness.
For act four Nureyev created  an elegiac pas de deux following his frantic discovery of Odette.  It is  one of the most beautiful dances of the ballet, perfectly conveying the  poignancy of the coming separation.  The conventional happy ending with  Prince Seigfried and Odette reunited in death is incomprehensible at the  end of the ballet unless one has read the narrative. Nureyev's unhappy  ending seems more in keeping with the action and Tchaikovsky's musical mood  of storm swept tragedy, abandoned romanticism, and brooding  melancholy.
At first Fonteyn was so upset with Nureyev's changes that he  ended up kicking her out of a rehearsal, but they soon reconciled and went  on as if nothing had happened.  Over the orchestra's strong objections  Nureyev insisted that the tempi be slowed so he could bring out the nuances  of emotion he was seeking.  His version of Swan Lake was a smashing success  with the public.  At the last performance of the premier in Vienna he and  Fonteyn received 89 curtain calls, the most ever taken.
In this film of  the ballet restrained camerawork and intelligent editing have defined the  essential choreography and dramatic effects.  The camera angles and  close-ups capture rather than destroy the patterns and enchainments as is  so often the case when ""creative film-making"" makes a hash of the  choreography.  As other reviewers have noted this DVD may not be entirely  up the technically achievable standard but it is so far superior to  anything available on VHS, and brings such clarity and presence to the  performance, that its few flaws can be forgiven.  Nureyev's Swan Lake  belongs in every ballet lover's collection, and it is fervently to be hoped  that this DVD is but the first in an avalanche of these great ballets on  perfect DVD's.",965260800,41,4519,5.1312154696132595
901454,4,6304584598,"This is definitely a great performance and should be in every ballet lover's collection while we patiently await the day it can be restored and digitally remastered.  Maybe someone else that knows could comment, but my  guess is that the master for this was a video, since there are dust marks  on the credits screens but not seen anywhere in the performance.  To the  credit of those making the recording, it also appears that a special stage  performance was made for the benefit of the recording, since it was  appropriately lit for cameras and shot from multiple cameras with competent  choices of camera angles, close-ups, pans and wide shots.
Although I  share his enthusiasm for this performance, I have to disagree with Mr.  Crotty's overstatement that this release ""exploits all the advanced  technology of DVD.  The September 1999 viewer from Texas is completely  accurate in his comments about the visual and audio flaws.  The next  version should address these flaws and do a restoration to remove the  videotape scan line artefacts.  It should have full DTS stereo digitally  remastered from an original professional audio tape and not the videotape's  audio track.  The quality would then be up to the minimum level that  customers expect from DVDs.
Even considering basic DVD capabilities,  there is little to complement since almost none are used other than chapter  indexing of all scenes.  This is decent, with 39 points in the ballet that  can be selected. But unlike Kultur's other excellent Nureyev DVD of Romeo  and Juliet, there are no annotations of any kind- no biographies or story  synopsis except that which is embedded in the film itself rather than on a  DVD screen or subtitle.  At bare minimum, the synopsis for each act should  be translated into the major European languages as well as (judging from  Amazon's statement of its popularity in Taiwan) non European languages such  as Chinese.  Besides the bare bones features in Romeo and Juliet, a ballet  commentary as a separate audio track would be especially welcome.  These  sorts of things are common on great films by Hitchcock or Bergman and could  be done cheaply.  Either of these features would enrich the experience of  audiences who are interested in gathering a fuller appreciation of this art  form, and would pay the producers back since it would extend their market  into larger audiences.

Their dancing brings the words elegance and love to mind. The grace and beauty of both stars was intoxicating. While Nureyev's performance was superb he never was a distraction from the total performance. Margot Fonteyn had exceedingly long and elegant arms and legs. She used them to great effect in her dual role as Odette/Odile. She was transformed as Odile in the zest and allure of her dancing. The soloists and corps de ballet were stupendous.  I was lucky to see Natalia Makarova in Swan Lake at the Kennedy Center in the 70s. She was unbelievable! However, Fonteyn and Nureyev wove a special kind of magic that brings a smile to my mind that will last forever. The production values were excellent. This looked great on my 43"" HDTV in standard aspect ratio.
