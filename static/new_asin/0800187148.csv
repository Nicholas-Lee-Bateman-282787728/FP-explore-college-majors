She is married to a man who manage the agency and has external marriage affairs. He cheats on Shannon Tweed. Can you believe that? Someone is married to her to look somewhere else. Then, one model who is friend of the victim hires a PI to work on the case. The movie is full of other sexy women with sex scenes, but Shannon only has one. I recommend it. I also recommend all Shannon's movies. It has suspense and interest story.  I hope all her movies will be more available for her lovers. If they are in a box set will be good too.",1257984000,3,653,4.1015625

1996 R-rated movie: language, violence, drug use, and nudity. Murder Mystery. 94 mins.

Credits: Shannon Tweed (Alicia Royale; ""Night Eyes""), Christian Noble (Dean Thomas; ""The Killing Jar""), Dawn Ann Billings (Zoe Taylor; ""Virtual Combat""), Ashby Adams (Miles Royale; ""Object of Obession""), Peggy Trentini (Julia; ""The Neighbor's Wife""), G.W. Stevens (Peter Holden; ""3 Wise Women""), Lisa Nohea (Melinda), and Duke Stroud (Roddy Daniels; ""Beautiful Dreamer"").  The director is Ellen Earnshaw, and the writer is Todd Smith.

Plot: Death in the modeling industry (which Tweed should have some familiarity with, being as she was a model for Playboy; not the murder part).  A ""fresh"" look is being searched for by a major company for a huge campaign (contest held, $150,000 contract is the reward). Tweed runs a model agency with her husband. Girl, Julia, found dead in a pool at a pj party.  Police suspect suicide. Friend of Julia's (Zoe) suspects murder and attempts to get a private investigator to investigate. The pi is reluctant - ""no more of the rough stuff,"" initially turns her down, but eventually takes the case.

Review: There are two things that are expected in Tweed movies: 1) nudity and 2) subpar acting (maybe three things: good music might be #3).  Very first scene includes nudity and confirms #1 (and then a pajama party).  The beginning of the movie makes it seem as if it will turn out to be ""nude action scenes"" with filler (and oddly enough, the acting during that filler seems to be at a much higher level than you would expect; and an actual movie does develop).  But then murder intrudes, and the action (as in mystery) starts.

The acting is better than excepted, the mystery is interesting (it should be noted that the mystery is investigated by a private investigator who is the main character in the movie, and is not Tweed), and the music is good.  Around the nude scenes, there is actually a plot (if you don't fast forward through it).  A plot that actually is intriguing, but quite illogical.  Overall, I would give the movie 3.70 stars (grade somewhat lowered due to very excessive number of nude scenes (every time you turn around, someone is ""flashing back"" to a nude adult action scene), and for the PI sleeping with his client, and suspects).",1117324800,4,2311,4.862244897959184
7795853,5,0800187148,"Forbidden Sins - Shannon is a lawyer in court battle defending her client who is accused of a crime by her x-husband police officer. In this title Shannon only has one quality nude seen. However there is quite a lot of footage of Amy Lindsay. Since this is a double feature it is well worth the price.
Human Desires - Shannon is the owner of a fashion design business and one of the models is murdered. Shannon has only one nude scene in this movie. However Dawn Ann Billings, Ashby Adams, Peggy Trentini all have several quality scenes. Nice Double feature.",1045094400,21,558,4.534653465346534
