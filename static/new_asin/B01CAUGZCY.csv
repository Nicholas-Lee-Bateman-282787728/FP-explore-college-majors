I discovered Linda's workout in youtube and I love pretty much all the ones I've done, and I done at least 30+ of her workouts.  I also purchased a lot her downloads and love all the ones I've tried.",1465344000,3,424,4.011904761904762
8752621,5,B01CAUGZCY,"I bought the download of this DVD when it first became available on Linda's website, and it's another fabulous Barlates DVD!  Each of the segments has you use the all for added resistance, and doing so makes for another creative and fun Barlates DVD!

Before doing this, I had been worried since I don't have a lot of wall space in my workout area, but I've been able to make it work just fine. You really just need enough room to comfortably put your legs up on the wall; all of the segments don't require any more room than that.  Also, Linda pauses and switches sides on most of the segments so her back isn't to us, but I have to keep my back to her on some of the segments (because I don't have enough free wall space to move somewhere new), and have been able to follow along just fine since her cueing is so good.

All you need to do this workout is a mat and a wall, so it's a great travel workout.

It's broken up into the following segments:

Chapters:
*  Intro - 1 Minute
*  Play All -114 Minutes
*  Warm Up - 11 Minutes
*  Glute Bridges - 15 Minutes
*  Upper Body - 19 Minutes
*  Inner Thighs - 19 Minutes
*  Outer Thighs - 22 Minutes
*  Abs - 19 Minutes
*  Stretch - 9 Minutes

It also comes with the following premixes:
*  Warm Up, Lower Body, Stretch - 77 Minutes
*  Warm Up, Thighs, Stretch - 61 Minutes
*  Warm Up, Upper Body, Abs Stretch - 58 Minutes
*  Glutes & Thighs Only - 56 Minutes
*  Upper & Abs Only - 38 Minutes
*  Glutes & Abs Only - 34 Minutes
*  Thighs & Abs Only - 60 Minutes

Each segment has you pushed up against the wall to do the moves.  The first time I did each segment, some of the moves felt a little awkward, but then they felt fine to do.

I love how creative Linda is with her exercises, and have been obsessed with her workouts for a few months now!  Even though I have quite a few workouts with glute bridges, for instance, Linda always puts a creative spin on them.  This is another tough, effective workout -- but the time passes quickly with all of Linda's Barlates workouts.  Love this one!",1456704000,,2039,4.040100250626566
