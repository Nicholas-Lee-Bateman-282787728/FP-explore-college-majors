5399997,4,B00A8LYYI0,"I loved the first movie so I knew I had to go see the 2nd. I really liked that it is based off of the game. And I really liked the way that it ended. You can tell that they are thinking about making a 3rd! I'm so excited they finially brought these movies back! I hope that we don't have to wait another 6 years for the next one though. My only complaint about this one was that it didn't feel as creepy to me as the first one did. The ""monsters"" didn't have as much screen time as I would have liked. Also there was alot of time spent outside of Silent Hill. When I watch these movies I expect to be creeped out just like I am when I play the games...and this one just didn't do that 3/4 of the time. Hopefully the next one has more bosses and more of that creepy feel....it would be unstopable!",1352246400,4,796,3.950310559006211
5399998,1,B00A8LYYI0,"In 2006, the original ""Silent Hill"" was released and had a unique and well constructed story with a twist and a slow boiling tension throughout the film. ""Silent Hill"" is based on a highly successful video game series and the movie release, in my opinion, was one of the better adaptions and is still a very good movie to check out if you ever get the chance.

""Silent Hill 2: Revelation"" follows up on the story from the original. A premise that leaves mother and daughter, Rose (Radha Mitchell) and Sharon (Jodelle Ferland), trapped in the mysterious town of Silent Hill. Meanwhile, father and daughter, Christopher (Sean Bean) and Sharon (Adelaide Clemens), now named Heather, are in the real world and on the run from a strange cult who wants Sharon/Heather. Yes, Sharon is in both worlds, her soul and body split into two and that is why the cult wants her back.

You may gather that the movie's storyline is confusing and convoluted. Well, it is. It will help to watch the original movie from 2006 to understand most of it. Walking into ""Silent Hill 2"" without having some understanding of the game series and/or the original movie, would be a large mistake. Even if you have seen or played the things related to this movie, you will find the storyline completely scattered and even at times nonsensical. I have seen and played some of these and even I found the movie confusing and scatterbrained.

""Silent Hill 2"" does some things right. The monster effects are tremendous. The deadly homicidal nurses who move and freeze based on sounds were well done and the spider monster was incredibly cool, especially in 3D. The 3D effects in general were some of the best I've seen. When the ash from the burning town falls across Silent Hill, it feels as though the ash is falling right in your lap. The actress Adelaide Clemens did a great job, even if she does look frighteningly like Michelle Williams.

On the bad side, the game series of ""Silent Hill"" is about puzzle solving and mystery. The movie tried to have puzzles and mystery, but nearly all of these were poorly handled and didn't give the audience a chance to play along. Most of the movies plot movements were illogical. One moment, Heather states that she doesn't know where the town Silent Hill is, but 2 scenes later they are there. She doesn't know anything about Silent Hill as well, yet the first person she sees there, she instantly states that she knows who she is.

Ultimately, ""Silent Hill 2"" is a trip through a haunted house and it has the same effect as well. Some of the jump outs scare you, but for the most part, it is a not-very smart follow up to a very smart original. Not to mention, the ending was anti-climatic and illogical. A very disappointing Halloween movie.",1352246400,11,2750,4.638603696098563

5400001,4,B00A8LYYI0,"I had no problems with the item that was shipped. The case, discs and digital copy were all brand new. Mine didn't come with a slip cover though. The movie itself was decent, the first one is a lot better in my opinion. The plot seemed kind of rushed because everything is cramed into a little over 90 minutes. There didn't seem to be a lot of scares and some of the dialogue wasn't the greatest. Revelation was made to be seen in 3D and it definitely shows. There's a lot of scenes that are meant to come directly at the viewer, such as stabbing or a little bit of blood splatter. In the end, this is a Silent Hill movie and I did like the story it told, I wish it was longer and not so rushed.",1520726400,,695,4.043478260869565

5400017,3,B00A8LYYI0,"Movie was better watching it years later (and was refreshing to other horror films) but still left a lot to be desired, especially in comparison to the first movie. This is like its step-sister and used recycled material from the first to tie it in. Everything happens so fast and it's hard to feel for any of the characters. They tried here but the story is thin and nothing gets to develop. Opening the movie and using it as a climax shows how uncreative this film can be. The final battle is also pretty lackluster.

I bought this with Prime and this is the 4th damaged item I've received from Amazon. Right when I removed the shrink wrap, the blu-ray had a chip in it that fell apart on the sides. For a new item, Amazon needs to get their crap together. The first movie was also damaged.

5400023,4,B00A8LYYI0,"I gotta admit, the ""Silent Hill"" movies are my guilty pleasures. I can't make a damn bit of sense out of the plots because in the case of the original it is under-explained and in this one it is over-explained. Still, it has its joys. One thing I can say about the 3D in particular is that during many sequences, it is utilized nicely. After James Cameron had his resurrection of 3D and 3D filming became standardized, filmmakers for movies such as this, Resident Evil, Underworld, and other franchises studied how to shoot a movie in 3D so that it is utilized effectively. I can't say that space was established especially well, but the 3D flows nicely once we get to Silent Hill. It's used more to show depth than having things pop out at the screen and try to rip out your eyes (then again, this IS Silent Hill...). Longer takes are used in certain places and cuts are generally kept low. There's a particularly memorable sequence with a spider monster that has a body of doll parts who uses three heads to look around that will make you happy you're watching in 3D. Other things, like PyramidFaceOrWhatever slicing off arms and such, are done with consideration for 3D. Seeing the Silent Hill environment with its monster designs and rusty flakes of walls in 3D is very rewarding.

I gotta be blunt on the plot. I couldn't make sense of it. I will say that the characters kept explaining it in every scene where there was obligatory dialogue to the fact that it felt like the movie was trying to justify its own existence instead of just owning its ridiculous qualities and going back to deranged nurses with sharp objects like scalpels who can only move when another moves and are played by dancers. At a point early on in the movie, I just kind of ignored the plot and focused on Sean Bean and Kit Harrington as well as Carrie Anne-Moss and made Game of Thrones-related comments. Even Malcolm McDowell shows up in a scene and does something of his Clockwork Orange routine.

I'm sure extreme fans of the game who know what all's going on with these movies can tell you exactly what is happening, but when such explanations are offered, I just smile and nod. If you're really into this universe, you don't need me to tell you to see this movie. But if beautiful cheesy horror is a genre you enjoy and you happen to have a 3D setup, ""Silent Hill: Revelation"" is 90 minutes of ridiculous fun. For people who use the term 'film' to describe a movie that's deemed worthy of having such a title, you should not be anywhere near this product. For gory delights in surprisingly well-rendered 3D, this one's really not so bad. But maybe watch with a friend so you can talk over much of the dialogue.",1502582400,,2696,4.522540983606557

It's almost like a collectors item sometimes. So Amazon dissapoints me there.

5400029,5,B00A8LYYI0,"Silent Hill Revelation is a sequel to the very popular cult film Silent Hill. Daughter Sharon Da Silva (Adelaide Clemens) is now a grown teenager in her last years of high school. Her stepdad and she move from town to town, she assumes, because her dad is wanted for killing a man. In reality, her dad is trying to protect her from the Order from Silent Hill, who knows that she is the key to release of their nightmare existence in Silent Hill. Sharon finds a friend in high school, Vincent Cooper (Kit Harrington) who makes friends with Sharon. One day Sharon returns home to see it all smashed up and the dreaded note written in blood on the wall-- ""Come to Silent Hill."" Sharon embarks on the journey to Silent hill with Vincent to find her father to rescue him, as he's obviously been captured and taken back.

The various adventures Sharon embarks on involves the cursed people who are mutated into various forms of monsters of sorts, living in torment in Silent Hill. These creatures are deliciously warped and the stuff of nightmares. The whole journey through Silent Hill is an exercise in everything that makes you queasy and many symbols of what could be your nightmares. Dark, spooky, and dangerous, Sharon and her friend endure all the tasks that eventually lead her to the heart of Silent Hill where a great standoff is set up for the climax.

I've enjoyed moody, dark horror movies all my life-- you might say, it's my cup of tea. I found this movie to be very entertaining. The characters were perfect for the story, and well played. Malcolm McDowell was absolutely excellent as he always has been, the reprise of Sharon's mom, Rose (Radha Mitchell) was excellent, as were the many creatures who frequented the adventures.

I haven't played the game or the sequel game, so I view this movie purely on its own merits as a sequel just to the movie. On that basis I thought it was excellent. Dark and deeply disturbing, it had all the elements of a great horror flick. I've noticed for a number of years now that the Canadian productions seem to be a bit more sophisticated than the Hollywood releases-- it might be the European influence to bring a better brand of movie experience to the screen. But most of the Canadian films are top notch nowadays. This is no exception, it's well made and thought out from beginning to end. The characters are well played and intelligent.

The last 20 minutes leading up to the climax is superbly crafted with many very spooky creatures as Sharon goes deeper into the bowels of Silent Hill looking to find and save her dad with her new found friend. Carrie-Anne Moss plays an excellent part of the story and the many character parts are played in a realistic fashion. I enjoyed every minute of this movie, it was entertaining from beginning to the end.

If you watch this movie on its own merits as a sequel to Silent Hill, you will enjoy it. Don't waste your time comparing it to the game. Although many elements and the theme are similar to the game, this movie stands on its own as its own story. Be prepared to be entertained for 90 minutes. I liked the movie well enough to buy it from Amazon. Highly recommended, worth the rental to see if it's something you'd like to own. Turn off the phones, tuck away somewhere private, stock up on your popcorn candy and pop and be prepared to watch in one sitting. You will be entertained.",1498867200,,3385,4.560855263157895

5400052,1,B00A8LYYI0,"Years after the events of the first film, Sharon De Silva has gone on the run with her father, having been pursued by the remaining members of the dreaded Silent Hill cult.  Now having adopted the names Heather and Harry Mason and started a new life in a new town, they think they are safe.  However, Harry is captured and Sharon/Heather is forced to return to the horror of Silent Hill one final time to try and save him.  She will have to face the terror of the Otherworld and the dreadful monsters and cultists that call it home, just as her mother did to save her so many years ago.

Even as an enormous fan of the source material and a pretty big fan of the first movie (despite its faults), I cannot bring myself to say that ""Silent Hill: Revelation"" is anything other than terrible.  It's a fundamental mess that tries to both serve as sequel to the original film while also trying to adapt one of the more popular sequels of the game franchise... something that cannot organically happen, as the first film made some fundamental changes to the storyline of the games.  The two mythologies clash horribly and thus the film needs to jump through constant hoops to try and reconcile the differences and tell a coherent tale.

The result is a messy mixture of plot-holes and constant ret-con work that confuses rather than enthralls, in addition to non-stop jump-scares, on-the-nose ""3D comin' at ya!"" effects and laughably bad structure and pacing.  Basically everything the ""Silent Hill"" franchise is NOT.  It stinks of ""studio committee"" writing...  everything is soulless and so by-the-numbers as to be ridiculous, and it feels like writer/director Michael J. Bassett was likely forced to dumb it down for the widest possible audiences by the producers.  I've actually quite liked Bassett's other work, and this definitely doesn't feel like anything else he's done.  It follows the same awful formula of ending every scene with a jump-scare, throwing in nonstop nonsensical CGI effects, and leaving characters to go completely undeveloped as so many of the other more recent horror films polluting the big screen.  It's on the level as that rash of Platinum Dunes remakes that haunted theaters a few years back.

It's honestly one of the worst sequels I've seen in quite some time.  It is to ""Silent Hill"" what ""Mortal Kombat: Annihilation"" was to ""Mortal Kombat.""  A messy, in-your-face sequel with no coherent plot and laughable storytelling.  It's to the point that it often borders on the brink of becoming ""so bad, it's good.""  You'll definitely find yourself chuckling here and there at the awful writing and ridiculous low-budget look of many scenes.  And to that end, I do think that people who enjoy crappy B-movies might get a kick out of it.  I picked up a cheap copy for only a couple bucks, and it made for a good ""bad movie night"" with my friends as we riffed and ripped it apart.

So yeah...  if you like bad movies, give it a shot.  If you're looking for a serious sequel to the original film or a proper adaptation of the games, steer clear.",1478736000,,3066,4.7218045112781954

Monsters are not only few and far between but they are, lots of plot holes, so many eye-rolling moments one after another. The movie was too bright and polished, I'm sorry but a little peeling paint on the walls does not make it Silent Hill. Outside of a few cliche moments of horror, the movie doesn't really take off until 40 minutes in when they arrive in Silent Hill (the movie as about 90 minutes total). But even after that it just feels like it drags on and on. There are a number of really talented actors in the movie including one of my favorites, Sean Bean, but every line in the movie is delivered with the same, dull forced-ness. If you are a fan of the IP and the first Silent Hill like me, are curious and don't mind wasting an hour and a half of your life forcing yourself through this pile of garbage just to see how they messed it all up (there are moments where I felt like this movie just slapped Silent Hill mythology in the face, cough cough demon showdown fight cough cough) than go ahead and give it 90 minutes you will never get back in your life. If you value your time and want a genuinely enjoyable horror movie experience definitely skip it.

It makes perfect sense though if you put into account that they were in a rough spot since the early 2000's and they were a bit desperate to keep the franchise alive when they were in the process of creating this film. The Silent Hill franchise was dying of when they were making this movie so they barely had enough cash to make it the way they did.

5400066,2,B00A8LYYI0,"I've seen this movie twice, so far. The first time, I was excited. I love Silent Hill and know in my heart of heart of livers it could be made into one of the great horror movies, if handled right. Shortly after the third jump-scare (about 10 minutes in, as I recall. Yeah, it's that kinda movie), my hope turned into a limp mush of disappointment and it only got mushier from there. So much mishandling, so much of the makers' hopes poured into lame jump-scares (truly the Silent Hill-est of all the horrors!). So much potential ignored. I guess the cast did well with the movie's versions of the characters, and some of the sets looked good. And Akira Yamaoka worked on the music, with which there ain't nothin' wrong. I'd probably like it more if it wasn't supposed to be a Silent Hill movie, honestly. Still not a lot, but at least I couldn't call it ""wrong"".
The second time, I wasn't riding a Silent Hill-hype and made myself watch it without fan-goggles on. Seeing the errors but not getting all nerdy about them made the movie...pretty funny, actually. I doubt I'd ever confuse it for a good movie, but in the right frame of mind, it's an okay unintentional comedy. An okay one. It doesn't have the laughable performances or terrible special effects of a Birdemic (most of the time...), so it's not a laugh riot. But it's got a chuckle or two in it.

Should you see it? If you have no patience for not-great adaptations, absolutely not. If you're a Silent Hill nerd like I am, only watch this if your therapist wants you to let some rage out. But, if you can shrug and say ""sure, Vincent's a teenager with a crush on Heather, whatever""...I mean, I still can't recommend it, but you might have a little bit of fun with it. And, hey. If you like jump-scares, this is definitely aBOO!!!!",1472774400,,1792,4.463414634146342

It was, however, far better than this second offering. Although SHR manages to recreate the visual atmosphere of the games quite well (as did the first film) it does so without being at all creepy or scary (unlike the games, which are very creepy). Im not sure how it manages to do this but it does. The main fault with SHR, however, is the story, which is neither compelling or coherent. The performances lack conviction, perhaps because the cast had little faith in the script and were aware of the poor quality of the dialogue. The effects are variable, and although it was good to see the infamous SH nurses make an appearance the use of real people to depict them, rather than CGI, was only partially successful. Overall SHR is an even bigger let down than the first movie as it fails to live up to the source material and is yet another example of Hollywoods inability to grasp the essence of video games.",1463961600,,1095,4.563451776649746

5400087,4,B00A8LYYI0,"Really: 4.5
Firstly: I LOVED this movie. I didn't realize how much I did until I recently did my annual ""Team Silent"" game play (as I personally find anything after 4 just...coattail riding cringe... sorry!). After playing SH3 I decided to watch Revelation as I only did once when it first came out and honestly didn't give it much thought. But after playing and watching I was just amazed at how great this movie was!

The first movie wasn't ...too bad. To be honest, I only watched for Pyramid Head. It's acting matched the graphics and story of the first game quite well in cringe factor and I felt the writer/director/whoever just kind of skimmed what the series was about and didn't really care for sticking to much else.

SH:Revelation was done in a ""this is for the fans!...more so than the other movie anyway!"" way that I adored them for it! The little things: hotel #106 and the red shoe in the room just had me smiling like the SH dork I am. I even waited for that jump scare in the mannequin factory of pure nightmares. (That whole scene was incredibly terrifying!)

Of course I had a few problems: while I love Jon Kit Snow Harington, I'm far too fond of game-Vincent. While I had read Kit was told not to watch anything about his game counterpart, he really did have some mannerisms and personality that could have passed for a younger Vincent. Very impressive, Kit!

Ugh and Travis?! Was that really necessary? All this happy build up went to ""uuughhhhhh but why?"" But it was only a second so I won't hold them to it.

Although I don't like seeing Pyramid Head outside SH2 (mostly in other games), I did like how they explained his role in the movie and the ""everyone has a different nightmare in Silent Hill"" justified it brilliantly. Plus, who wouldn't want him as a personal guardian?

Four years late on a review, I had to fully appreciate it as a decade+ fan and the true effort they actually put into this movie really made me enjoy it that much more. Not to mention they explained the plot a hell of a lot better than the game did. Though everything felt so rushed, they did manage to make the absolute best out of 95 minutes.

And balls to the whining reviewers ""I don't play the games so dur it was bad I no understand"", well no s***. I wouldn't watch a movie based on something I haven't been a fan of since NO, you wouldn't get the whole story in a short time span. Hello? Harry Potter.

5400093,3,B00A8LYYI0,I AGREE IT IS NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL AND BY FAR NOT AS GOOD AS THE GAME ON PS AND DON'T WATCH IT FOR THE PLOT BUT THE 3D IS AWESOME. THERE ARE SOME SCARRY SCENCES AND MAKES YOU FEEL IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS FANTASY HORROR NIGHTMARE.,1455926400,,234,3.7
5400094,4,B00A8LYYI0,"Silent Hill: Revelation is what I consider a really good horror movie, however it does have a few things going against it.  For one the character of Heather, while the actress that portrays her was a phenomenal choice based on her appearance (Adelaide Clemens) the problem is that she doesn't act the same way as Heather.  To me Heather was ornery, tougher and more rebellious than the relatively tame/quiet outsider character we see in the movie.

Heather even admits to her classmate that it's a good idea not to bother getting to know her, because she'll be moving on shortly anyway.  This scene was sort of unintentionally funny because she just stood up and criticized the entire class and yet the teacher says she did a good job of introducing herself, lol.  Her classmates should have been super angry.  I also feel there's a low budget sense while watching some of the acting take place which should've been improved.  Some of the lines weren't delivered in a high quality way.

I have to mention some spoilers, so don't read the rest of my review if you haven't watched this movie yet.

I thought Harry was supposed to die.  It surprises me it doesn't happen that way since he reappears at the end.  Also while I'd have to brush up on my Silent Hill 3 knowledge to remember which events in Revelations are based on the video game and which stuff is exaggerated or fabricated for the sake of a movie, I'd have to say either way the movie does a tremendous job telling a *really* sophisticated story especially when compared to most horror films these days.  While that comes as no surprise since the SH series has been known for its remarkably detailed story, what's most surprising is that the movie tells it so well.  Actually you might even argue the movie focuses more on story than it does on the actual horror which is only a slight problem.  There are some noteworthy suspenseful parts at the end, but for the most part this is all about telling a story.

Anyway everything you can expect from the Silent Hill video game series involving the cult, Alessa, Dahlia (who should have been more vicious and obsessive with her obligations) the sudden shift from eerily foggy to dark and demented environments, the Seal of Meatron, giving birth to the God, etc, is told very well in this movie.  You can expect several conversations to take place between Adelaide Clemens and Kit Harington (a classmate of Adelaide with his own history which eventually unfolds in a surprising way when we discover who he really is).  They do an awesome job telling the story.  Of course this can be a negative too.  You have to pay *really* close attention to grasp all the details.  This can be a lot to take in for a first time viewing, especially if you've never played Silent Hill 3.  However you don't have to play the game to follow along to the story- it'll just be easier to follow if you've played the game first.

I'd say the difference between Silent Hill: Revelation and the first Silent Hill movie is that the first one focuses more on horror and unsettling environments, whereas this one is more story-oriented.  Still, the atmosphere is tremendous and the movie does actually get a lot better as it rolls forward.  Now that Konami is done with the Silent Hill franchise (unless something changes in the future- who knows) I assume this will be the final Silent Hill movie as well.  Also the fact Revelation has been heavily criticized doesn't exactly sound promising concerning the possibility of another SH movie either.  What a shame.  But again, I'm sure Revelation had to make some (several?) inaccurate or awkward changes that video game fans wouldn't particularly like which explains the criticisms.  Taken as a horror movie however, it's pretty darn good.",1455753600,2,3769,4.7129770992366415

I was excited to hear about this movie. In fact, there was a contest to create the cover art for the posters and I had the change to enter. Sadly I did not win the contest, but still was excited to see this movie.

I gave this film four stars overall because it did not give the level of intensity I was hoping for. I understand the difficulty of putting a multi hour game into a movie, but I was hoping for something a little more creepy, intense, and more closely following the game plot-line.

But, it is a Adaption  (The Original was dead on close to the game except instead of Harry Mason (the father) you have  Rose Da Silva (the mother) looking for her daughter! Ok plus the names were changed a bit too
As i was trying to say about Revelations it's a pretty good flick for what it is
I wish they got Jodelle Ferland to return to play Sharon or at least Alessa Not sure if she was to old or Not old enough But, it would've been nice to see her again in the follow up
Adelaide Clemens to replace Jodelle (more grown up) is so/so even though I thought she had a good look to her
She does try her best as Heather / Alessa  she was the little girl Alessa in the Original but, had to change her name to stay under ground so the Cult couldn't find her
 Sean Bean returns now known as Harry which i think was a wink wink to the fans
I Love Sean Bean but, in both Silent Hill Films he's under used and it's a shame (Maybe the Film Crew could only get him for a short time idk) It just sucks cause you have such a great actor and doing very little with him
with that you have Adelaide Clemens with the task of Carrying almost all  the film
and in the end she does a good job this is the first time I've seen her act here in the states
I enjoyed her performance her wardrobe looked something out of Silent Hill
Radha Mitchell also returns from the Original (more like a pop-in Cameo) This was mostly due to book end the last film
I could be wrong
Deborah Kara Unger Returns but, it's also pretty short  (without a doubt she to is being under used) another shame
Malcolm McDowell also has a small part as Leonard (This was silly to cast him in this) he had no point to be in this roll they could've got a HQ character actor to play Lenard and payed much less and put the $ towards something else
I'm a huge Malcolm McDowell fan but, this was just a pay check (which I can't blame him for taking the gig) The Casting Director on the other hand shouldn't have even tried to get him
Carrie-Anne Moss  as Claudia Wolf was a Great Choice but, the look they gave her was so stupid  (She has a dark complexion) and they give her white hair and it makes her look washed out!  It just made her look silly whoever came up with her over all look dropped the ball.
Her look effects her  performance  Big Time!
The story is ok (It's biggest problem Once you get to the end it's anti climatic)
I think one of the biggest problems when it comes to this film is getting Grade A Talent and doing nothing with them
If you are a fan of the original this is worth watching at least once! It bridges the gape in the story (sort of)
It's much better to see in Real 3-D though
Once I can get it for a good price I'll without a doubt buy the 3-D BR UK Import

5400136,5,B00A8LYYI0,"For silent sake... is it really a five star movie? No of course not, but it dose something's very right that make it easily a better entry in horror movie sequels than ANY of the Resident Evil disasters.

First it pulls itself up from the weird first movie that tried to cross the first two game stories together. Silent Hill part one wasn't bad exactly just over did things to cover completely different games. Part two story is tighter and does a good stab at sticking to the events of the third game.

All the performs put in an effort and seem to be doing their best despite low expectations. The movie holds the first movies tone ( for better or worse) which is different from the games, but fine for a movie. Like part one the characters effects were glaringly bad in someplace while the simple character talking to herself scene was excellent.

Im sad that the Silent Hill franchise has changed so much in the world of gaming, but more that concept of Silent Hill likely won't be further explored in movies. Revelation if not attached to the Silent Hill name is a three and half star horror movie, but it gets my full five star rating mostly due to capping the "" original"" game story and still leaves room for more stories from Silent Hill. Be they version of stories in game or comics, or original from the minds of horror movie writers about dark skeletons in people closets. The town of Silent Hill has a lot of closets left to open.",1436313600,,1443,4.437735849056604

5400152,3,B00A8LYYI0,"""Silent Hill: Revelation 3D"" is directed by Michael Bassett (Solomon Kane) and is reminiscent of going to the funhouses at the circus, or  watching a stage play. This theatrical feel comes through in numerous scenes such as the one with the chained Malcolm McDowell character, or in Carrie-Anne Moss's scene in the ruins of a church. I think these qualities add to the appeal of the movie as one has the sense that we are going along for a ride just as one might at a house of horrors at the fair. It is advisable however to watch the first movie in this series before watching this film otherwise one may feel that this movie is rushing ahead without any buildup or explanation since we are plunged immediately into this horrific world right from the beginning. But once we get to Silent Hill and its funhouse atmosphere, and its atrocities of horror, that matters little as we are swept away with some memorable creatures (the mannequin spider, and the blind robotic nurses) and special effects. The direction is dazzling as is the fantastic world that is created. Adelaide Clemens, who looks a lot like Michelle Williams, holds the film together with her believable performance. All in all this film is not so much a horror story as it is a sort of exhilarating ride through a funhouse of horrors.",1427760000,,1300,4.676855895196507

5400159,2,B00A8LYYI0,"I am not familiar with the Silent Hill video game. I saw the original Silent Hill long ago, and only remember the basic concepts. So, this review is simply my impressions of the film as a stand-alone horror film. The plot makes no sense. If you continue watching, some of the plot becomes a bit clearer. But, basically, it is all gobbledy-goop.

On the other hand, the grotesque horrors depicted are fantastic, very well done. The film seems like an excuse to present a series of deformed creatures  from your deepest nightmares.  No plot required.

The dialog is ridiculous, and I did not believe that the central character was 18 years old. She seemed to be 15 or 16 to me. The behaviors of the father and daughter did not seem believable. So, as a film, it's not very good. If they had bothered to actually create a plot, and had dialog and acting, it could have been great.  The art direction on this film was great, and the team should create an original horror film that takes advantage of this talent.",1425081600,,1008,4.516483516483516

Silent Hill 3 is my favorite game of the series(Silent Hill 2 is admittedly the best); it was excruciating to see just how much this movie absolutely trashed Silent Hill 3's story. The movie was nonsensical, disjointed, and idiotic. The connections between the movie and game were similar names and a few remnants of a similar plot. If the director was going to make up his own plot, then he should have done that; don't try to somehow tie in the game when you're already creating your own idiotic story.

So I came to associate Silent Hill with a tendency to just not hold back and to be crazy. I felt that this movie was just much more tame. While it did introduce many canon characters, but in some really weird ways and the sheer number of them overwhelmed this one and a half hour movie.
Also, while I could describe many Silent Hill (the first) scenes that showed exemplary camerawork, I could not do so for this film.

(SPOILER ALERT)

Most monsters have extremely short appearances, as each big ""boss"" (like in a video game) is defeated in almost no time at all.
Also, my friends and I could not hold back our laughter when we saw Pyramid Head operating a carousel. Not a ghoulish, blood-soaked, demon-filled, darkness-infested carousel, but a normal one that just looked a bit beat up. Really, he looks like he's having the time of his life and, in that moment, it's as if Pyramid Head is the bringer of goodwill and joy to all that ride during his shift (just imagine him saying ""wheeee!"").

5400225,4,B00A8LYYI0,"This is the second silent hill movie.  Both come from a video game and that is what  you get here. Plot is Not the point. There is a plot though , a young girl returns to silent hill , a place cursed by a order. of evil. Well that's the plot mainly. Ok, it's not got a huge plot here! but what it DOES have is a great use of 3d for effect. This is all about the 3d money shots. Personally I really enjoy those type of in your face 3d films. I enjoy regular movies though which just use 3d for effect too.  Both 3d types are valid and I like 3d enough to wish that every film was shot in 3d. This was shot in 3d, and it really benefits on that level. It goes for many shots of things flying at  you in 3d. It is not about plot as much as effect. Which is fine here , I have 'man in the dark 3d'  from 1953 and it also uses 3d for this type of effect and it does have  a great plot. You can get that at screen archives.com,  anyways get this one for it's great native 3d and many money shots!  This isn't a great movie and if I saw this in 2d it would be a very much lower rated film by me. But for a 3d flick about wild scenes and money shots this delivers.  The plot is there though. Will the young girl get out of silent hill with her dad?  will she stop the evil half of herself.  ok, it's a very loose plot but it's a Great 3d effect flick.  You can have both too though!  ON blu ray I had only one scene of ghosting. That's quite impressive too with a active 3d player. It does have extras though , so that's another plus this movie is so much about the 3d here that I would NOT recommend watching it in 2d though.",1390867200,,1618,3.7797619047619047
5400226,4,B00A8LYYI0,"I enjoy the games and I really enjoyed the first movie. This one is pretty good as well but I think it lacked the mystery and shock value when when it tried to provide answers to all the crazy stuff in the first movie. Overall it is still enjoyable and was much better seeing it again after only seeing it in theaters only once. The 3D is solid for the most part. A decent amount of depth in  the Silent Hill darkness scenes and the raining ash really pops out. There are a few stab at the screen scenes that fly out at you.

It's a very fun movie, featuring several scares, great imagery & effects, and a very Silent Hill-esque feeling to it. I'm a huge fan of the video game series, and - all things considered - I really wasn't disappointed in this movie.

5400234,3,B00A8LYYI0,I was hoping that the graphics would be superior to the first movie and was sadly disappointed. The scare factor was not there this time. Might be due to it being a different director.... I will still purchase to add to my horror collection only because it has something to do with the first Silent Hill.

5400235,3,B00A8LYYI0,As always I love the music and the visuals that go along with most entries in the Silent Hill universe but this movie really missed every other mark. Michael J. Basset was a horrible choice as director and writer of this film. My biggest gripe is how bland all of the dialogue was in this. I think the actors did what they could but there's only so much you can do with a script like this one. If you are a die hard Silent Hill fan like myself it still might be worth checking out for the atmosphere and music and some great visuals but this director really didn't understand the subject matter the way that Christophe Gans did. Had he or Roger Avary been involved this would have been so much better.,1384646400,,701,4.2781954887218046

I did not enjoy Silent Hill: Revelation much at all. There were some things that conflicted with the events of the first film, and the dialogue in this one was so awful in so many places I literally cringed. The story was confusing (partially because some things conflicted with the events of the first film, as previously stated) and not paced well at all, there were also some things they brought in early on that seemed like they'd play a role that really ended up not being used at all. There were a couple of suspenseful parts, though, but they only lasted for a few short moments, and Sean Bean and Adelaide Clemens did well in their roles despite the awful dialogue. But overall, Silent Hill: Revelation is just not a good movie, it did a lousy job of following up the first movie. I wouldn't recommend it.",1383782400,,964,4.391061452513966

5400243,2,B00A8LYYI0,"Silent Hill: Revelation (Michael J. Bassett, 2012)

[censored for Amazon consumption]. I hate that this movie even exists. The original Silent Hill may not be the best videogame adaptation in all of film, but if it isn't, it's in the top two. Despite it being pretty much impossible for a sequel to have continued on down that same road--there wasn't terribly much left at the end of the first movie to work with--I was still cautiously optimistic when I heard this second one was coming out; I figured they would keep the actual town of Silent Hill intact (and indeed, Deborah Kara Unger returns) and come up with a completely unrelated story. And they kinda-sorta did, but here's the movie's first problem: Laurent Hadida, turning in his first adaptation, decided to try and tie the story in using a series of ridiculous coincidences and stretches.

Plot: Heather (The Great Gatsby's Adelaide Clemens) and her father have spent the entirety of Heather's young life moving from town to town; as we open, they've found themselves in another generic suburb, and Heather is starting at another new school. This time, however, there's another new kid: Vincent (Games of Thrones' Kit Harrington). The two of them, against Heather's better judgment, bond, and when Heather's father goes missing, and she finds a message scrawled on the wall of their apartment telling her to come to Silent Hill if she wants to save him, Vincent tags along--but it turns out that none of the players have the full story...

...and I'm not entirely sure the screenwriters did, either. Once Heather and Vincent get to Silent Hill, the actual storyline takes a back seat to the crew's desire to shove as many special effects into this movie as possible. And it's not the back seat of a sedan, either, it's the back seat of a very long bus. There are some times when this is not necessarily a bad thing. We all knew going in that Alien vs. Predator was going to be a stupid movie where a lot of stuff blows up, and we went to the theater and sat down, and it was a stupid movie where a lot of stuff blows up, and I had a whale of a time. But Silent Hill, that was something entirely different, creepy and atmospheric and effective, and most importantly for the sake of this discussion a movie that set a bar that its sequel was going to have to live up to--never mind that the chances that it could were vanishingly small. And we went to the theater, we sat down (okay, I dialed it up on Netflix Instant, but still), and we got a stupid movie where a lot of stuff blows up, but one that didn't even have the breakneck pace of AvP; there was a stage in this film's development where Bassett and Co. really were trying to make a movie that would have stood up to the first one. Somewhere along the way, I suspect, that idea got dropped, but not enough of it got removed during the rewrite to even make this a guilty pleasure; instead, the first half of the movie, as inept as it is, serves to highlight what could have been had a little more thought been put into this. * ",1379462400,,3044,4.499095840867993

I do know they give you a heads up to the next installment, well good luck with that. I like to preview a movie in 2-D to see if I like it and then if all is well ,I will purchase it in 3-D .

The mannequin-spider monster is creepy, but they overdid the CGI effects on it.

5400255,1,B00A8LYYI0,"So, the original Silent Hill film isn't the greatest movie ever made for a variety of reasons. It had a weak third act, unclear motivations for a number of the characters and the creatures they chose to use only made a limited amount of sense within the context of the movie. Nonetheless, it managed to get far more things right then it got wrong. Silent Hill: Revelation manages, by contrast, to do everything wrong and make even the carryovers from the first film rather awful.

For the curious, Silent Hill is based on a game series by the same name and thus pulls a number of plot elements and characters from the series to the silver screen. Mind you, when it comes to Silent Hill: Revelation it manages to pull a lot of elements and make good use of none. It takes the major elements of the third game of the game series and attempts to awkwardly marry those elements to the events of the first movie with limited success. The connections it attempts to make the plot plausible stretch credulity even within a fantastic universe featuring a town which exists as a sort of hellish purgatory. Nothing about the plot makes the least bit of sense. The CG ranges from awful to god awful and the new creature design is only passable. Most of the scares are cheap and the horror is more of the gross-out variety rather than bothering to make any effort towards creating true atmosphere. Silent Hill: Revelation lacks even the basic creepy/spooky vibe that made most of the original Silent Hill film fun.

Basically, Silent Hill: Revelation isn't worth your time or your money. Skip it and if you really need a Silent Hill fix either play the games (the first three in the series being good at their worst and phenomenal at their best) or watch the original movie.",1373932800,2,1762,4.59047619047619

What follows is bad writing, cheap jump scares and over-the-top Malcolm McDowell. There are some nice effects of characters/creatures such as Pyramid Head and Nurses from the original Konami game, but the story is incoherent with events that happen randomly. The slow-paced film does not develop characters or build up tension. It does not even bother to scare us.

In addition to Sean Bean, some of the original film's players come back, which only makes me want to go back to the first ""Silent Hill"" film. Christophe Gans' original may not be a classic horror, but knows how to scare us. Don't go to ""Silent Hill: Revelation 3D."" Whether it's 2D or 3D, it doesn't matter.

You will leave yourself at the end of the film wondering, why did that happen? Or, this didn't make sense.

5400281,1,B00A8LYYI0,"For some it came from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, for others it was delivered at St. John's Church. Decelerations of "" I have a dream"" and ""give me liberty or give me death."" Moments so powerful, so moving that they change the course of history, they set into motion the wheels of progress that once rolling can never be stopped. For me this moment came as a screen faded to black, a piano playing daring me to reflect, challenging me to look inward and ask, ""how?""

How did this movie get made? What sadist wrote it? What studio could have possibly produced it?

Sure, it would be easy to blame writer and director Michael J. Bassett, but the scope of agony released by this movie demands we do more. For example we could find fault in the West Midlands forests he used to explore as a child. Why did they not swallow him whole at an age when he was so young and vulnerable? Why did the trees not fall on top of him while he rested by a babbling stream, crushing him long before he had the chance to do the same to dialog and character development.

In looking for a scapegoat we could cast our ire at producer Samuel Hadida for funding a movie in which men born and raised in a hellish world carelessly walk into a room full of monsters who they actively ignore before - and in some cases during - the acts of being ripped apart by those same monsters. We could choose to attack studio Davis Films for allowing the making of a film that explained the ability of ancillary characters to enter another dimension by saying: they took a ""wrong turn in some fog"". We could even say that the ineptitude of actor Kit Harington was surpassed only by the irrelevance of his cohort Malcolm McDowell. But this would be like saying the Bubonic plague was worse than the Spanish Flu.

Is there an answer? Should we just give up, like the movie did when it turned the final confrontation between the heroine and antagonist into a hug-off? No! We can march on, defying all odds and spitting in the face of certain failure, as the movie did by inexplicably making a profit of 32 million dollars. The truth is we have to go deeper and look in the mirror, as Sean Bean does for 15 minutes while his dead wife regales us with a summary of the first movie. Not one person can be held responsible for the tragedy of this film. The sheer berth of this nightmare demands that we look at it from a larger scale and the only entity big enough to support the size of this horror is humanity itself. To this end we find the real culprit, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Yes the USSR.

During a thirteen-day span between October 14 - 28, 1962, Soviet ships carrying nuclear arms to Cuba steamed towards a US blockage. Kennedy and Khrushchev promised mutual assured destruction, Humanity stared into the face of all out nuclear war and Silent Hill: Revelations stood on the brink of extinction. Then Soviet Russia flinched a nuclear holocaust was avoided and the world was doomed to witness the creation of this movie.",1369267200,9,3007,4.440217391304348

 As far as the movie, i remember when i first played the video game on my playstation when it first came out. MAN, what a game. Then they came out with a movie, that within itself is a hype. Then they were comming out with a second one. Oh man, cannot wait. Anticipation ran too high for this movie, because it led to dissapointment. The movie was too fast paced, the only slow parts was when she was walking through hallways. They used some characters from the first movie, but NOT all the same actors. Thats the first fail, NEVER make a second movie and have different actors playing same characters. It worked with ROSE (Rhada Mitchell), but she didn't really have part in the movie, and in fact my opinion is what made the first movie great! Someone needs to RE-DO this movie, dissapointed all the way around.

5400301,4,B00A8LYYI0,"Like just about every other reviewer, I was hesitant about watching this.  Would it live up to the Silent Hill 3 movie in my head?  Well, I can answer that question for you: No, it did not.  But adaptations seldom do.  Truth is, I loved the movie.  Once I put aside my pre-conceived notions of what I wanted to see, I was blown away.  And I like the fact that it's a somewhat modern adaptation of what I consider a classic story.  I really wouldn't want to see a frame by frame reproduction of the game, I could just sit down and play it.  And that way I could immerse myself in that creepy feeling you can only get playing these games.  No movie is going to give you that.

We Silent Hill fans are biased, to be sure.  But this movie did not fail.  References to the game are everywhere, and I'll admit I was miffed when other games from the franchise popped up.  Case in point: Pyramid Head.  Um, he died in Silent Hill 2.  But he's iconic.  Why wouldn't I want to see him in the movie?  They took a fascinating character, and one pretty cool to look at, and transplanted him into a new role that gives even more depth to his character.  And instead of looking for ways I thought the movie lacked the feeling of the game, I started wishing elements from the movie were in the original game.  Case in point: the Mannequin Tarantula.  How cool would it have been to fight that thing?  Visually the movie is off the charts, especially the scene in which Heather reveals Claudia's true nature.  Konami wishes they were capable of those effects when they designed the game!  Very little of the effects have that 'fake' quality, but some did (um, the mirror scene).

Overall I wasn't disappointed.  But for me, the movie ended after the final fight scene.  I didn't much care for the bit that came after, the tidy wrapping up of the story.  I like to feel there's more to tell.  But I found myself hitting replay because I was so mesmerized by this 'version' of the game.  I can't give it five stars because I can't give anything five stars, but my final score is this: watch it for the special effects alone.  You'll be glad you did.",1367452800,,2130,4.318987341772152

The writer was just trying to drag out a second movie from what was a decent story and botched it all up.

5400344,1,B00A8LYYI0,"This movie was extremely rushed, trying to follow a plot line of a game that they failed to grasp even in the slightest. This failed to capture the concept of the game at all. It felt sloppy, like they were desperately trying to connect the 3rd game to the first movie and failed miserably. And don't get me started on the Vincent love interest. This whole movie is full of cliches and its sickening. They replaced Douglas roll with Vincent, completely ruining two of the best characters in the game. And the acting, oh my the acting was atrocious. Vincent was trying too hard to be Romeo, and Douglas (for the 2 seconds he was in the movie) was horrible. I really liked the first movie, and though it wasn't perfect, I would still call it one of the best video game movie adaptions ever made. But this? This movie is atrocious and a disgrace to the Silent Hill Franchise. And dare I even mention that final fight? And pyramid head was Alessa's guardian? It's bad enough to even add pyramid head in this movie... but that is awful. And that epic hug scene on the carousel? Man, this movie was fantastic... not.

There were a few good things in this movie. One cool little detail was that Claudia had no eyebrows and no shoes, following well with her character model in the game. Second were the nurses. The nurses were extremely well done and creepy. And third, the ""other world"" atmospheres were pretty awesome, and they had a few good atmosphere shots.

Overall, coming from a hardcore fan of the game series, I found this movie horrible and disappointing. Be weary before watching this, especially if you are a fan of the games. I hope that they will stop the atrocities here, and not attempt to butcher another fantastic game's portrayal of Silent Hill (especially not Downpour, I saw that bus at the end, I'm keeping my eye on you).",1364169600,2,1837,4.546827794561934

It would be nice to have some commentaries or more featurettes on the creature designs.  However this is a very bare bones release even on the Blu-Ray.

Although a lot of hardcore fans find a lot to dislike, I found it quite enjoyable. You have to realize that this movie is going to be different from the game. There are changes, as is with anything that is transformed from its original platform, whether it be books or games, things change. If you cannot accept differences, then don't watch it.

The movie had an enigmatic ending with the mom and adopted daughter seemingly alive and in the process of returning to their home but in a weird cloudy dimension with constantly falling ash from the underground fires.  The husband/dad was unable to see and communicate with them, and vice versa.  The sequel, Silent Hill: Revelation, is a true sequel, picking up where  Silent Hill left off and featuring most of the same characters (or their relatives).  As in the original, the sequel features dramatic special effects highlighting the strange and alien enviornment of the town of Silent Hill.

  I thought it was really good plus it's great to see cameos from some of the casts' of the original film.

  The main character Heather looked a lot like actress Michelle Williams. My only disappointment with this film is the lack of depth with the boss fight scene with now  monster-turned Carrie-Ann Moss against Pyramid Head. This was a defining moment but sadly it just turned to fluff.. that was badly edited I think.
  Some of the characters weren't given a good back story as well, most likely they were short of both budget and time constraints.

  Good 3D effects.. even the special feature section although short was shot in 3D.

5400366,5,B00A8LYYI0,"this movie is great! really sticks to the source material (silent hill 3 ps2). it covers everything really well and only veers from the original sparingly. the budget was a little low but so what? it still looks pretty great and the budget issue only shows glaringly once or twice. the other thing is the acting is odd, this is because all the main characters are english or australian pretending to be american, so their speech sounds stilted just because they're masking their accents and trying to mimic american speech patterns.

other than that it's gold. for a long time lover of the games this will please. they definitely kept it true for the fans! they even brought back in the idea of the silent hill people trying to resurrect their ""god"", which was left out of the first one for some reason. the only real divergence form the source is the large part given to and the exact nature of the people trying to resurrect the ""god"". in the game they're super vague and their position a little different. however they have reconciled them a little more true to the game since the first movie where they were totally different.

the ending is hilariously bad, that much i can say, but it's a thirty second scene and it's fun while still being really ridiculous. then there's a shameless tie in of a bunch of different things to cap up the movie which is also ridiculous, but a fan will just smile because of how many ideas they cram into the last 60 seconds or so! it's like ""oh i know what that is! ah! that's from this one! ha ha, they even brought in [blank, no spoilers ;)] and got his/her name right!"" and so on. for a non gamer it might be kind of cheesy... or more like super cheesy, but for someone used to the stilted and odd dialogue of the game series it's nothing new.

i think there must have been a scene planned of nurse vs a certain monster (again no spoilers) because it shows a still model that the camera swings around in the credits. must have gotten cut for time or something, shame because it would have been epic!!!

another thing:

all those who say this and the first film are not true to the games: compare them to the resident evil series!!!!

the first RE movie is about 20% true to the games. the third and after are about 5%. (the second film is an exception and is really similar to the games but one out of five movies does not tip the scales so i'm omitting it for this argument).

silent hill one is about 70% true to the games, and silent hill revelations is about 80% true to the games!

RE just wanted to own the rights to make movies that they could sell using the name recognition of the games.

silent hill clearly is much more dedicated to creating movies that are relatively true to the games! give them a break!",1363132800,,2757,4.369140625

5400385,2,B00A8LYYI0,"""Silent Hill: Revelation"" is one of those films that asks way too much from its audience to be successful. The original film came out six years ago. That's a long time for regular moviegoers to remember what the first one was about without doing some sort of research.

Basically, it asks all its viewers to invest an extra 90 minutes of their life in seeing the first movie before taking in the new one. That's a lot to expect from people who may not feel like catching up with a film released in 2006 that critics flamed and many audience members were on the fence over. In a nutshell, ""Silent Hill: Revelation"" takes a whole lot for granted.

Another thing filmmakers expect from viewers of ""Silent Hill: Revelation"" is a knowledge of the video game. If you haven't played it, chances are you're going to be completely lost as far as plot or characters go. The uneducated will likely feel as if they've been thrown to the proverbial wolves.

It feels like script and dialogue writers tried to put together a sensible explanation of what's happening in the film, but somehow everything got jumbled up in front of the camera and when actual actors had to recite their lines. The whole movie just feels like someone is telling a joke and everyone around is in on it except you.

For a movie that is 90 percent CGI, producers sure didn't feel the need to up the budget enough to keep ""Silent Hill: Revelation"" from letting everyone in on the very apparent secret that it was entirely shot in front of a piece of green cloth. I can't believe a mining town in the middle of nowhere covered in soot and dust could look so shiny and glistening. I will say that the interior sets were rather impressive and did emanate a sense of grime and claustrophobia.

The only extra feature included in the DVD edition of the movie is a ""Behind-the-Scenes"" featurette entitled ""A Look Inside 'Silent Hill: Revelation.'"" That's not much for fans of this franchise to get excited about. The Blu-ray version doesn't give consumers any more incentive to spring for it because it basically contains the same bonus material.

""Silent Hill: Revelation"" might be attractive to gamers who are familiar with its world.

5400389,5,B00A8LYYI0,"After reading a lot of negative reviews and seeing roughly two terrible previews I went into this fairly concerned that it would be awful. I did not watch this in 3D and unfortunately there were a few awkward scenes that were meant solely for 3D and when viewed in regular they seemed overly cheesy and weird.

This one isn't that scary but it does have a lot of creepy parts. Several scenes felt very rushed and several of the monsters barely had a justifiable amount of screen time because of it. This movie should and could have easily been longer and I feel it would have been twice as great if the scenes had deeper development.

All in all I really enjoyed this movie, it did the best it could in transferring a terrifying video game to a 90 minute film. The acting was great, the soundtrack was of course awesome and the special effects were the best they could be. A few scenes will defiantly stick around in my head as being not only creepy but refreshingly original.

I won't say if it was better than the first or not because they are almost two completely separate things. Even though this is a direct sequel it has a totally different feel to it and it works. I watched the first and then this one back to back and it was a perfect combo.

Not a terrifying horror but a very creepy, gory and entertaining movie. I am a huge fan of the video game franchise and I loved this movie.",1362182400,,1392,4.32183908045977

The 3D doesn't add much but it's not bad, basically like the Resident Evil movies they throw in everything and the kitchen sink to remind you it's Silent Hill, all the locations, parts are present but none of is felt real, not even in the unreal surreal sense of the alternate hell world that is Silent Hill, everything looked like sets/props and the cinematography was too clean. The story is a mishmash of Silent Hill 3 basically with chunks of SH 2 tossed in... the acting is laughable, the girl playing Heather was ok, but nothing special and everybody else around her was pitiful which just doesn't work in any movie, you need a strong all around cast directed well and this movie just didn't achieve much other than cheap predictable almost scares. I reluctantly give it 3 stars.

5400403,3,B00A8LYYI0,"SPOILERS CONTAINED!  There were a lot of fan nods and nice effects.  I especially appreciated the trucker moment where that character was being ""released"" from the fog, and overall I enjoyed the movie.  But the film had a lot more unexplained issues that could have been fixed with simple, one sentence write ins.

Here are a few questions that come to my mind immediately:
How did the order send monsters and Vincent to the real world and hire a detective, yet claimed could not leave the Silent Hill nightmare realm?
Why did Leonard have the talisman in his chest?  Was he keeping it safe?  Was he a monster before being locked up?  What?!
Why did the second half turn Leonard into a monster?
If he was dangerous, why did Vincent send Heather in there without warning her?  He was supposedly locked up for being a philosopher type.
Why was Vincent sent to the ""nurse room"" if his mother put out the front that she wanted him to be mentally repaired?
Why did the guards try to fight the sound activated nurses at all (which was a cool scene, don't get me wrong, but made no logical sense)?
Why did the other guards foam up and die in the mist if it was a hype in their minds?  Vincent and Heather were fine, and Vincent said they ""believed"" the air was toxic.  Seemed to be more than a belief.
Why was Alessa taken out so easily?  Did she want that to happen?
Why does it seem unclear whose side Pyramid Head was on?  I always thought he was a deity of the order, but he switched sides at the end.
What the heck was going on with Claudia when she turned into a monster?  It referenced back to Leonard without ever explain what was going on there.
Why did Vincent have no issue or emotions with his mother dying?
Why did we get no information, visuals, or anything about the God they kept talking about?  A photo in a book or chalk drawing would have been courteous!
How did Rose and Sharon get trapped in Silent Hill if Alessa said she never wanted Sharon in Silent Hill to begin with?
If Travis got released, why wasn't Rose released as well?  If she's dead, fine, but then why let Harry back into the mist?
Who was controlling Silent Hill if Alessa and Heather combined?  There was no monster to trap the people any longer, which is what they wanted!  Vincent walked out twice for goodness sake, but Rose couldn't walk out with Sharon?

I could not keep straight what monsters belonged to what group.  I get some scenes don't warrant an explanation, like the mannequin monster or pyramid head slashing arms, but there were just too many w-t-f moments that made no sense at all to the story.  These also didn't feel like questions being raised for a future movie or to make viewers think, this felt purely like plot holes that had no thought put behind them.

I would have also liked to have seen the redundancies taken out and more explanation put it - we already knew Silent Hill was out there from the first movie, we didn't need 30+ minutes leading in to Heather's nightmares or how she got there.  Personally, I would have arranged the film starting at Heather's dad missing and her asking for help from classmate, Vincent, and let everything else unfold via flashback as the story progressed.  That way we would have gotten a classic Silent Hill vibe, and a lot of audience members would be more surprised that Heather was Sharon and the missing dad was Rose's husband.

I thought the first film did such a good job of integrating and answering things from the games (ie, what the sirens were all about, why things were happening) and the ball felt dropped in the sequel.  So many good actors in the film, but such potential wasted from bad writing and directing.",1361923200,,3671,4.4677661169415295
5400404,4,B00A8LYYI0,"A lot of people criticize Silent Hill: Revelation.

A lot.

They say that it twists the game's backstory too much, that it doesn't get details right, that it's badly put together...  But a lot of these critiques miss the point.

This isn't Silent Hill 3.  This is Silent Hill 3 done in the context of the first Silent Hill film, and that makes many of the changes necessary.  As a result, the story is a little bit foggy (pun intended) but it's a very fun watch.  The only part I didn't really like was the fact that almost everyone's natural accents broke through a bit too much and took me out of the film a bit.  I liked some of the original takes on creatures and the use of minor shocks to create a creepy atmosphere.  The CGI is not the best, but the practical effects are very well-done.

All in all?  It's worth a watch if you enjoyed the first film.  If you loved the first film and love nods to the video game series, it's worth a buy.",1361923200,,945,4.188888888888889

5400408,3,B00A8LYYI0,"Gentleman on Amazon Forums advised me that Silent Hill was in 3D for shutter/passive glasses.
My initial exposure to this movie was with my Asus Laptop G74sx, 3D enabled with shutter glasses that never failed before. But it failed tonight. My initial opinion was flawed based upon past experience and my Asus G74sx having some kind of software conflict. Assume the conflict was with Opera, Safari (both work famously in Windows 8), Java, Corel WinDVD. Did a System Restore Point. Viola! The Asus laptop was back to true 3D.

In the mean time I took the gentlemen's word and played Silent Hill 3D on my LG 47"" passive 3D TV. The Silent Hill 3D Was awesome. The colors vibrant. The 3D exceptional. The fine gent knew what he was talking about.

I wrote what I saw. I never suspected my Asus G74sx was in conflict with another program causing my Asus G74sx to play 3D only with anaglyph glasses. Have Blu-Ray 3D films that are only to be used with anaglyth glasses.

The above is my correct opinion of Silent Hill 3D. Perhaps, the best 3D FX I have ever seen.

This movie is a teen girls Saturday night screamer.

This film satisfied my 3D hunger.

It ain't bad. It is a Friday night,  teenage girls scream kinda flick. Flashes of brilliant 3D gadgetry set amid a ridiculous premise.

Like 3D so I bought this release as soon as I could due to 3D hunger. Places, even in the mall, Happy Burgers there was no color whatsoever. The zombie looking customers were in black and white.

There is no color in this movie. Everything is set at night or in dark places. They made no effort to put forth a really good visual product.

This movie is only in 3D with anaglyph, red/blue/green lenses glasses. The studio did not even provide anaglyph glasses. How cheap is that? And one would assume the disc would be for shutter/passive 3D viewing,

I have seen many a porn in 3D and the porn 3D is vastly better 3D. The disc Properties revealed 43.5 GBs were used to make this flick. Go to wikipedia.org, type in anaglygh 3D. Take a look at 3D a century ago. It is light years better than it is now. A few big name stars in there. How embarrassing for them to be in such pathetic entertainment. But the show must go on so the rent and groceries will be paid.

If you are a 3D junkie, this film is good enough to buy. If not, save your money for real 3D during the day.

I do not recommend this movie. And I should mention I do not like the cast embers of these movies or their look alike stooges running around the hood trying to cover up there performance issues that has to be in the WorldTradeCenter equation.",1361836800,,2596,4.383333333333334

I understand What some people mean when they say it couldve been a longer movie, but whatever I Mean look at Saw movies they were only an hour and a half each and look how spectacular those were. So to the People Who keep saying this is A horrible movie and giving it only 1 star, you're pathetic and where's your movie??? So here's my rundown if you or your friends wanna see a good horror film pick this up. You will love it :)",1361232000,,1059,4.120772946859903

5400440,4,B00A8LYYI0,This movie start of very quickly and is freaky and exciting for almost the whole movie. Your sitting there wait for the next scary part reminds me alot of the video game,1361232000,,169,4.3125
5400441,5,B00A8LYYI0,"This movie has some of the BEST use of 3D I've seen in a movie in quite a while. Its so good that its worth it to purchase this just for the 3D alone. There is constant depth throughout the entire film (3D on par with Avatar and Hugo) and more than half a dozen pop-outs, some that come a couple feet out of the screen. When you combine the amazing 3D with this type of movie, it makes it a very enjoyable popcorn flick.

I was really contemplating on how many stars I should give the movie. If I was going by the movie itself I would have probably only given it 2 or 2 1/2 stars. Its has a pretty good story, its acting is mediocre at best, and it does a good job at being pretty scary, but its very gory and quite disturbing. I'd put it exactly on par with the first film. But when you take the average horror movie that this is and combine it with some of the best 3D I've ever seen, it turns it into a very exciting horror film experience. Which is why I gave it 5 stars because it does this perfectly.

If you have a 3D setup you really owe it to yourself to check this movie out for the 3D alone.

(If anyone is wondering how why I'm reviewing a 3D Blu-Ray before its released, Best Buy has had this for sale since February 12.)",1361145600,2,1234,3.967741935483871
5400442,2,B00A8LYYI0,"As a stand alone film, Silent Hill: Revelation is just barely ""O.K."". More a 2 /12 star film than a three star, even by horror movie standards.

The first half of the movie was somewhat promising, but IMO it completely went off the rails once the movie returned to Silent Hill. Better than a lot of the horror popping up on the various streaming services, but very clearly a ""direct to video"" quality of offering.

As a real fan of the original movie, however, I was completely disappointed with the film. The writer/director completely missed the mark on all the things that made the original engaging. The visuals were in the same style, but clearly not on par with the quality of effects in the first movie. The sense of tension, suspense and ""creepiness"" factor of the original were absent. Alessa, the ""demon child"" from the original is barely represented in the movie and a ""key showdown"" with the characters fell so completely flat that it was sadly laughable.

After watching this film, I couldn't help but be reminded of another horror film sequel, ""The Ring 2"". Just as with ""The Ring"", this film was such a vast failure as a sequel that it has virtually guaranteed that a once promising franchise will die a whimpering death.",1361145600,8,1236,4.686635944700461
5400443,1,B00A8LYYI0,"Short and Sweet:  This film was collection of three minute attempts at fright (of varying degrees of effectiveness) all filmed to get the most bang for buck out of whichever abandoned factory it was they rented for filming.  The plot (please insert scare quotes) is not much more than a series of Intro to Theater Arts level dialogues designed to offer the barest plausibility as to what the aforementioned fright scenes have in common (other than the abandoned factory where they were filmed).  Adelaide Clemens (i.e., Sharon/Heather/the Warm Fuzzy at the Bottom of Alessa's Black Soul/Whatever) seems to have been hired solely for her ability to scream on cue, which she sometimes does convincingly and other times just phones in (e.g., when she meets the ridiculous manikin/spider thing).  Speaking of the ridiculous manikin/spider thing, thank you Silent Hill: Revelation for providing a textbook example for how to misspend what appears to have been a decent production budget; every teacher of a Film Studies 101 class needs to cut you a check.  Also, thanks to the ridiculous manikin/spider thing, I now have a pretty clear idea of what Georgia O'Keeffe's work would have looked like if she had been fixated on a different human aperture.  These are just the highlights; this film is a deluxe burrito of horror clichs (self-serving plug: for my general hatred of recent clichs, see my review of The Last Exorcism).  Oh yeah, Kit Harrington, Silent Hill is in America not the UK, so fight the urge to talk like you're in middling episode of Cadfael when your character ends up there.",1361145600,3,1589,4.973584905660378
5400444,3,B00A8LYYI0,"The movie is good, it has its ups and downs, but its enjoyable. What I didn't like at all is that this is the second product I bought from amazon that I received damage, I'm starting to loose trust on them, the case cover was smashed up,  like when they were packing it got out, and when trying to put back in, they did it very sloppy, and I find it very disappointing to have received to products in a row in this conditions.",1361145600,,426,4.071428571428571
5400445,1,B00A8LYYI0,I am a huge fan of the game and have played all except the first. The story.....horrible. So many holes such horrible dialog. Special effects ......horrible.  It's not worth the 4bucks catch it on tv and save your money.,1361145600,2,220,4.641025641025641
5400446,1,B00A8LYYI0,"I'm not exactly sure where to even begin. This movie is bad, like made for tv bad. I didn't see it in 3d so I am assuming that the majority of the visual issues are because of that. The lighting is horrible, the first movie had a good balance of what to show and what to leave to the imagination. Revelations doesn't do this, everything is seen in bright and terrible detail. I was tempted to turn the brightness down on my TV to help the movie but it wasn't worth the effort. I'm not sure how you mess up fog, but using CG for some of it is certainly a good start. I have to question where the budget went for this movie but it sure wasn't in the special effects. It also wasn't in the locations which went from bad to worse. I hate to re-iterate myself but this movie is a small step up from the garbage the Syfy channel now produces. Now for the acting. I feel bad for all the actors in here since they were all trapped in this terrible script. Sean Bean tried, you can tell, but he is trapped in this movie which his ironic. This movie suffers from not knowing what it wants to be, a teenage slasher flick, an occult movie, something with a plot. I didn't listen to any interviews but I'm sure the canned response went something like ""we are such huge fans of the game, blah blah blah"".  Now they absolutely cherry picked the third game and succeeded in making everything terrible. The rabbits (if you played the game you know) were not scary and they could have been. Locations like the mall, the school, etc. All wasted opportunities. Instead we got some forced love interest. Pyramid head, while having no place in the first movie I thought still worked as fan service because he wasn't over used. He absolutely doesn't need to be in Revelations. I almost shudder to think if they keep making these movies, it will follow the footsteps of the Resident Evil movies.",1361145600,2,1871,4.345714285714286
5400447,2,B00A8LYYI0,We loved the first 'Silent Hill' and I play the video game. This sequel wasn't worth watching and it seems like they left it open for a third. Hopefully they take more time and revisit the first one.,1361145600,2,199,4.2631578947368425
5400448,4,B00A8LYYI0,"This story concludes the one began with the first Silent Hill movie of 2006.  Chris and Sharon DaSilva are on the run from members of the Order.  The Order knows that Sharon is carrying a part of Alessa's soul in her.  She is also in possession of a mysterious round amulet that the cult wants.  Using the names Harry and Heather Mason, the two have been moving constantly from town to town.

The story begins with Heather's first day at her new school.  While there, she meets another new student named Vincent Cooper.  Later that day, she learns from a private investigator that the cult has located them.  When Harry fails to show up at their designated meeting place, Heather hurries home to find a message written in blood.  The message instructs her to go to Silent Hill to save her father.  Heather takes the amulet, and with Vincent for company, make their way to Silent Hill, in West Virginia.

While resting at a motel, Vincent admits that he is a member of the cult.  He was sent to bring Heather back to Silent Hill.  But he sees that Heather is good, and not evil like Alessa.  He warns her to stay away from Silent Hill.  Undeterred, Heather decides to proceed anyway.  At the hospital, Vincent is attacked by a monster.  The two get separated.  Heather finds Leonard, the former leader of the cult.  Heather mistakenly gives Leonard her half of the medallion/amulet, turning Leonard into a monster.  Meanwhile, the cult wants to punish Vincent for betraying them.  They decide to send him to the asylum for ""treatment"".

After she manages to get away from Leonard, Heather meets Dahlia outside.  Dahlia tells her that Alessa has given part of her soul, the part that can still feel love, to Heather.  The cult wants to sacrifice her, believing that doing so will bring an end to the nightmare world that Alessa has trapped them in.  That is the reason why the cult has been pursuing Harry and Heather for many years.  They also wanted the amulet that Harry had been hiding.

She finds Vincent strapped to a gurney, surrounded by knife-wielding nurses in short, sexy dresses.  Yes, the same ones that Rose had to deal with in the first movie.  Trying her best to keep quiet, she helps Vincent out of his restraints.  But the nurses reacts to the sound and starts slashing at them.  They barely make it out of the hospital.

Alessa confronts Heather at the amusement park.  Heather and Alessa fight for dominance, with the former coming out on top.  Now in control, Heather finally confronts the current cult leader, Claudia.  During their exchange, Claudia finally reveals that Heather will be sacrificed in order to birth their God.  As Claudia touches the amulet, she transforms into a beast.  And right at that moment, Pyramid Head shows up.  Claudia and Pyramid Head battle it out.

Sean Bean, Carrie-Ann Moss, Malcolm McDowell, and Deborah Kara Unger make up the veteran all-star cast.  Newcomers Adelaide Clemens and Kit Harrington play the roles of Heather and Vincent, respectively.  Needless to say, the acting performances are beyond reproach.  I do not think Sean Bean can be bad at any acting role.  The man is always great at every role he has been in.  The same can be said for Malcolm McDowell and Carrie-Ann Moss.  Adelaide Clemens is a future star.  She has good acting skills and terrific looks to go along with it.  Kit Harrington is reunited with his fellow ""A Game of Thrones"" cast member, Sean Bean.  He does a pretty good job here as Vincent, playing an American teenager.

Silent Hill and Resident Evil are two of the most successful movie franchises to have been inspired by video games.  Both games came out on the original Sony Playstation.  They were some of the best examples of the Survival-Horror genre.  The popularity of the genre and the dominance of the Sony Playstation console, helped ensure that there would be a large fan base for these games.  And that fandom transferred over to the movie franchises themselves.  Resident Evil has now had five movies.  Hopefully there will be many more movies in the Silent Hill franchise.

You should first watch ""Silent Hill"" before viewing this one, ""Silent Hill: Revelation"".  I highly recommend this movie.",1361145600,,4200,4.747572815533981
5400449,1,B00A8LYYI0,"I love dark films with good special effects, and I was hopeful that this movie might rise a bit beyond what the first Silent HIll did. However, in my opinion, bad writing and dialogue made it worse.  The man character was hardly believable and there were so many moments in the film where a character would say to another info that you could tell was just to fill the audience in -- very lazy and sloppy writing.  Yes, there were some decent special effects, but no better than first firm and, I dare say, less impressive.  The plot related to the main character and the supposed demon child she came from made little sense.
All in all, I was glad I just rented this film and hadn't spent even more at the theater.  IF you like the first Silent Hill film and don't mind mild disappointment here, then you might want to check this out. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.",1361145600,2,870,4.41875
5400450,3,B00A8LYYI0,I thought the movie was good. It took up for the first one left off and had the Same errie looking characters.,1361145600,,110,4.045454545454546
5400451,2,B00A8LYYI0,"I rented this here on Amazon not expecting much at all but I was still disappointed. From the get-go, it felt really rushed and a lot of the acting felt half-handed. The pacing felt like it was running a thousand miles an hour and there were ""boo"" moments every step of the way. They happened so frequently that I was bored of them about half way into the movie. The movie does shape up a little bit once they reach the other world in silent hill, but it still doesn't have the same atmosphere or treatment that made silent hill feel the way it did. I think that's an artifact of treating it like a Hollywood gore flick. I guess I don't expect a movie to really replicate the atmosphere of a game(since they are different mediums after all) but I really expected it to get a lot closer than it did. Despite all that, it was still entertaining and the visuals were interesting.",1361059200,2,876,4.347560975609756
5400452,3,B00A8LYYI0,"Silent Hill 3 is my favorite in the series (aside from 1 of course, I'll never forget the first time I played that). I had no idea this movie was going to be about Heather untill I saw her white vest and hoodie sweater. In the opening scene. It hard to say if this one was bad or good. Really I just think it was too short. The plot stuck to the game a lot more than the first movie did and I like that even though some things changed she went to all the correct locations AND IN ORDER!!!. I disliked SH1 the movie so much because it was barely anything like the game. With Silent Hill Revelation's what's changed so much is that the movie has a lot more akward gore scenes than suspense. Silent Hill isn't really a ""gory"" type of game it's more of a ""suspense"" type of story. So that was a bit wierd to see as it didn't exactly fit with the theme of the game. There's no people getting chopped up or having thier skin sawed off in the game so why is it in the movie I don't know, also theres these random soldier guys thrown in and the town seems to be full of people which is also strange. In the game the town is empty and only monsters run about. That's what makes it strange when you find a real live humanbeing but in the movie that seems to be forgotten. They did the ""Nurse"" scene again in this movie I liked that part they're iconic to the game. What is thrown off that puts me halfway between this being good or bad is the storyline. Some stuff is true to the game but the some of it isn't. SH3 explains a lot about why silent hill is the way it is and the forces behind it. You see Pyramid Head doing his job as Alessa's protector but you don't see the other one that's responsible for turning the normal world into the nightmare world by turning the valves. Not that it's a big deal but it's a major part of the story line to explain the two guardians. Also there's Alessa and the order and their mission isn't explained well about them wanting to create a new God and Heather being the key to giving birth to that God. The ending feels very rushed like the movie is missing about another 45minutes. Considering how much I disliked the first one but how I wanted to see more of this one I say it's a decent movie but it could have ended better. If they do make another movie I atleast hope they adopt thier own story and pick it up where they left off with Heather. I don't mind seeing her since she is one of my favorite SH characters.",1361059200,,2448,4.091476091476092
5400453,2,B00A8LYYI0,"Silent Hill: Revelation follows Heather Mason as her father is kidnapped and used as bait to lure her into the nightmarish town of Silent Hill. The story is a bit deeper, but I'll leave it at that for the sake of this review's length. Silent Hill: Revelation is a decent time-killer, but it's riddled with flaws.

First, the story in Silent Hill: Revelation is mediocre. It doesn't exactly follow the story in Silent Hill 3, but does use some of its elements and characters. They changed certain parts of the story and they use most of the characters; they really nailed Heather's look, which is a plus. Considering I've played the game and watched the original movie and I still managed to get lost a bit and question my memory, I believe this film might be a little confusing for those with little to no experience with the franchise. Also, the film has poor screen direction, which negatively affects the story. One moment they'll be here, the next moment they'll be in an entirely different location, with little to no explanation; one thing that made the Silent Hill games great is the dreadful atmosphere and tension while exploring the creepy locations, unfortunately, this is absent in this film. It really skips most exploration, which leaves every scene feel like they're not connected. Also, when things look like they'll get heated and intense, like it would in a boss fight, the fights/chases end quickly and usually cheaply. And, finally, the ending leaves you with a big ""WHAT?"", whether you're a fan or not; (SPOILER: skip to the next paragraph if you're avoiding spoilers.) The finale is a battle between Pyramid Head and Claudia, something you'd expect in a movie like Star Wars or anything with sword fights, with blades clashing; and, this also has little explanation. (Pyramid Head's appearance in this film is questionable itself)

However, the film's creepy monster design is great and I've always loved the transition from regular reality to the hellish Otherworld. The cinematography and most of the special effects were also great, although there were some special effects I disliked. For example, this film uses computer-generated blood, likely for the 3D effect, which looks very unnatural and hurts the immersion in the film, in my opinion; this problem isn't consistent, though, as I only noticed it occasionally. Fans of violent horror films might enjoy this gorefest; fans of jump-scares will also find a few effective scares here. The acting was good most of the time, although there are a couple of lines of dialogue that felt forced and a few that were just cheesy. Finally, I really enjoyed the several references to the series, including the guest appearances at the end, and I enjoyed the music.

Overall, Silent Hill: Revelation has a few redeeming qualities including the haunting setting, mostly great special effects, and the video game references but the poor story, and terrible storytelling hurt the film significantly. On top of that, the film just doesn't feel like Silent Hill without the psychological approach and the haunting symbolism of the game; don't get me wrong, though, I didn't let the film's relation to this series affect my score, it's simply a mediocre movie overall. This is definitely a missed opportunity after the first film, which I really liked. If you're interested in watching this film, I suggest a rental after watching the original.

Silent Hill: Revelation has strong violence and gore, some brief nudity.",1361059200,,3480,5.005181347150259
5400454,5,B00A8LYYI0,"So I'm not familiar with the games, I've only played the first and I was too young to remember. This movie just blew me away when it came to visuals and sound, usually some movies I have to lower the volume when it gets loud at some parts and then other times you can't even hear the people talking but this wasn't the case with this movie. The sound was well balanced and the picture quality of the blu ray version is amazing!! I don't understand why a lot of people were in happy with the movie...it's a great movie, I had a lot of fun watching it.

5400457,5,B00A8LYYI0,"The first Silent Hill movie, frankly (in other words, in my opinion), did not feel quite right when it came to representing the video game. Sure, it got certain elements of the video game right, but overall, it felt forced in its style to appeal to the non-video game crowd.
This one, though, sticks more to the games. Specifically, Silent Hill 3. Hey, even Sharon/Heather looks EXACTLY like Heather from SH3, and that she spends a chunk of time in a mall like you start in the game adds good repute points for me to this movie. And that's not the only thing its gets right. Sure, it's got continuity from the first movie to keep the story straight, but the fact that it can keep continuation from the first movie and stick faithfully close to the third game in more than one breath (let alone for over half the movie) makes it deserving of praise.
I was just a touch worried that this movie would be a little cheesy like most sequels to any kind of movie would be, but I was relieved that the filmmakers (in every field with this case) learned from past mistakes and improved on everything and then threw in extra stuff that, surprisingly, did not make it feel bogged down in the slightest. Very good, clipping pace, even the ""normal"" scenes that help bring in characterization to each person, and the little subtleties therein, the extremely disturbing cult (straight from SH3 AND the first movie), even the nurses and Pyramid Head look exceptional. And, not to mention, the added bonuses of a Numb Body cameo (which looked jaw-droppingly excellent and downright chilling) and Malcolm McDowell as Leonard Wolf (and his great acting in quite a short amount of time), it all shwoed how much the filmmakers cared to appeal to anyone who loves not only horror in general, but also Silent Hill overall. Not to mention, they did an excellent job at one of the trademark signature subtleties of the game series- make institutional places (like school and church) become a total acidized nightmare. And the amusement park scenes? It nearly had me rethinking going to anymore amusement parks.
Strange questions getting shocking answers, a lot of very unique monsters (like the mannequin doll spider) having surprising twists to their behavior actually stunned me good, and the overall atmosphere within Silent Hill was nothing short of greatness, fitting for the film AND genre.
And from a certain line in the middle of the movie (no spoilers now!) and how the movie ends, I do hope they make a third that follows the footsteps of Revelation.",1360972800,,2535,4.750566893424036

That's why I stopped watching the Resident Evil movies when the second Resident Evil movie came out.  I bought this movie in hopes that it would be a lot better than the first film.  The first movie was decent but didn't have re-watchability.  When I watched this movie I was thoroughly disappointed in it.  Everyone I know told me it was a great movie.  I don't see it.

First off.  The movie isn't dark enough.  In the games the environments are supposed to be pitch black.  You don't see that hardly at all in this movie.  The scares aren't good enough.  The only two things I enjoyed where the weird nurses and the pyramid head.  The pyramid head is above all my favorite monster from the Silent Hill franchise.

Second of all.  The story line was boring.

I was really hoping this movie was going to be great but I guess I was wrong.  But that's just my outlook on it.  You be the judge.  Happy watching!",1360886400,,1024,4.345744680851064

I was nervous about the first once since I played the video game because I thought they couldn't represent it well enough or the movie would flop. I was wrong the first one was a very good movie. This one is pretty good as well. It is suspenseful and follows the plot of silent hill 3 if you have played the game.

The story was interesting and the action was very suspenseful. The acting of the movie was good as well. (There is nothing like a horror movie with poor acting aka a comedy then) As far as the horror aspect of this movie it does get scary at times but in my opnion its mostly due to the graphic scenes. They really did a great job with the special FXs.

This movie is well worth a watch if you enjoyed the games or enjoyed the previous movie. It does have some gory scenes which can be disturbing, but not ridiculous like some new movies.",1360886400,,917,4.088888888888889

I waited forever for a continuation of the first movie, even though it differs so much from the games. Revelation makes a very decent attempt to pull the movie storyline back towards the actual game storyline. This movie was noticeably not as ""big-budget"" as the first, but it covered a lot in the short amount of time allotted. I enjoyed the attention to detail, and it was basically done the best it could have possible been.",1360886400,,548,4.6020408163265305

Without really going into the story, something that you'll have to see for yourself...especially if you have played Silent Hill 3 as many times as I've played it.  First off is the image of the movie.  I think the director and photographers and all did a wonderful job giving us the Silent Hill dreamy to nightmare quality.  I think that the image of Silent Hill in all its ways comes clear in the visuals.  As for the demons, the creatures weren't your usual monsters as in most films, these are beasts that (as any Silent Hill fan knows) comes out of the deepest recesses of the mind and soul.  If you are a Clive Barker fan, then some of the horrors will remind you of some of his best works.  The story line is something familiar to us as we've seen the first film and played the first and the third video game.  You know these characters and I think the actors and writers do a good job presenting these main characters.  For me, I hope there is a third film that focuses on the search for the missing wife/mother.

I found the first film somewhat intriguing and visually impressive.  SH REVELATION captures the visual imagery but its narrative is often incoherent.  I felt my mind wandering during portions of the movie and cheated by the sequel-inspired ending.  Adelaide Clemens wasn't a strong presence as Sharon and Sean Bean seemed uninvolved in his role as the father.  Carrie Ann Moss and Debra Karen Unger get lost in their heavy make-up and Martin Donovan is merely a cameo.  The actor playing Vincent is really unimpressive.  SILENT HILL may thrill game enthusiasts, as a movie for the general public, it's basically eye candy.",1360713600,,755,5.139344262295082
5400468,5,B00A8LYYI0,"For people who don't know, Silent Hill is much more than two movies.
It all started out as a game for the Playstation (original) and there's now 7 games.
Even playing through them doesn't reveal everything about the series. It has backstories and history dating back to before the first
colonists arrive in North America. The creater/developes of the game put so much time and effort into creating a huge storyline for the series.
Now, I know people can't just buy all the games and play them to understand where the two Silent Hill games came from. Many people don't have the time either.

[...]

I suggest going to the website above and read all you can about the story/plot, In Order, (It will tell you) to better learn about the series. There's info on Heather AND lots of other characters in the film. In order to fully make a Silent Hill movie with the necessary information and all, they'd have to cut in tons of flashbacks, thus making both films at least 3 hours or more apiece.
Silent Hill is missing quite a bit, but the missing story and all IS there.
Next time a book/game is made into a movie, try reading or doing research on it before downplaying and bashing it because it doesn't contain EVERYTHING explaining it all.
Both films have portrayed Silent Hill like it should be and I am not the only one who feels this way. Either way, it makes a creepy/weird/horror movie.",1360627200,3,1386,4.54

This was a cheaply done and very poor attempt to create new revenue based on the fact its part of that succesful storyline.  Unfortunately it falls so short, that its actually easy to fall asleep while watching it.

Gone are the all creatively made demons and fractured humans skulking about, unless of course you count the old costumes from the original they reused in some scenes, like the Nurses, and just reshot them all over again, or incorporated CGI which was not used in the original.  In fact, many scenes are just flashbacks to the original.  I can only think of how cheap it must have been to make this movie. My gosh, Alessa is not even Alessa anymore, shes created a new part of her that houses the only good left of her that was not turned into complete evil... STUPID storyline idea!!!!

If your desperate enough to return to Silent Hill again, might I offer a MUCH better solution?  Rewatch the original, it will be time far more well spent and you will SAVE YOUR MONEY.  Thanks for reading my review.

And again the casting is faulty with Sean Bean playing the father as if his role in the first movie was any good. Yelling at nuns with Sean Bean anyone? The fact that someone actually thought that was a good idea is beyond me. And like the first movie this one barely makes any sense plot-wise although I could say the plot in this one is even more convaluted than the last. It seems like this film is relying waaay too much on 3-D effects which is so irritating because Silent Hill isn't about cheesy jump scares. And of course Mister Red Pyramid makes another appearance for no reason seeing as he's a manifestation James Sunderlands withering psyche. James is the main character of Silent Hill 2 by the way. This movie pulls from the 3rd game in the series where Pyramid Head made no appearances whatsoever. The fact that they've included him in both movies just seems so thoughtless. And Cheryl just up and changing her name to Heather (the protagonist of SH3)? Really??? That's all they could come up with to include Heather? Wow.

It's like Konami is trying it's hardest to completely shame the Silent Hill franchise with the release of not only these movies but every game after Silent Hill 4. It wasn't even scarey. Every attempt to shock and scare left me giggling to all-out laughter.

This new director tried to take the story that left off from the first movie, and shoved the whole story of Silent Hill 3 in. It turned out to be an amateur mess. Things didn't make any sense, the visuals were pretty bad, (relying compleatly on SGI) and the infamous Pyramid Head was thrown in for the ultimate fan service.

I don't hate this film, its just another bad movie-game adaption. Its not surprising. These things happen a lot.

If anything with the way Konami is treating the series the games will end up as dumb as this film. Downpour was a disaster and the Vita game an almost mockery of the franchise. Konami needs to let Team Silent get reformed and make new games and films because the last of any notable effort put into the franchise was with The Room and that came out almost 8 years ago.

I was overall pleased with the movie. They tried to cater to fans this time around and it was obvious. They threw in details that players would remember and tried to keep the main cast from the third game. It was nice compared to the utterly nonsensical changes from the original.
I will say that I had two major issues with the movie though. The first was the ending, or the 'climax'. It felt rushed underdone and completely unconnected to the rest of the movie.
The second was Claudia. If you've played the games you'll probably notice that her character is...off in this movie. Her dialogue seemed forced and her motives unsure. She wasn't the crazy god loving woman silent hill fans would remember from SH3. Honestly Vincent was changed too, but they didn't even try to keep his character intact so there's no point in mentioning that.
That said it's still more than worth the price. I went to see this three times in theater with the same friend who also shares a love of all things silent hill.

Spending money on this is a waste.  The plot was dull and made no real sense.  Things just happen for no reason.  It is LOOSELY based on the 3rd games story but, of course, changes have been made.  The first movie was okay...merely okay.  There were cringe-worthy moments of dialogue but at least they tried to make a decent adaptation.

There is this one part where a doll/spider monster crawls around and it's just so ridiculously corny.  Then it just jumps all into the camera, obviously meant for a 3D scare...it is just laughable!

5400495,3,B00A8LYYI0,"When the original Silent Hill movie was released, I was more than a little bit skeptical. I mean, how could you possibly capture the relentlessy terrifying atmosphere of the games and transfer it successfully over to film? Fair enough, the film wasn't nearly as scary or as engrossing as the games were, but for a movie based on a videogame, it was surprisingly good, great even.
The success of the original silent hill movie made me hopeful that the sequel would be just as good, if not better than the first film. And while Silent Hill Revelation never quite scales the heights reached by the original film, it's an enjoyable tale with some very impressive and spooky moments sprinkled throughout.
First thing I have to commend are some of the casting choices. The gorgeous Adelaide Clemens is perfectly cast as Heather and I can't think of anyone more fitting to play the silent hill 3 heroine. Sean Bean was criticised in the original movie for his poor american accent. However he performs much more admirably in Revelation and his British accent is almost impossible to detect. One cast member who didn't impress me however, was Kit Harington, better known as Jon Snow in HBO's stunning drama series, Game Of Thrones. While Kit is excellent in GOT, he basically sleepwalks through this movie, with poor line delivery and some scenes where he just seems to not be putting any effort into his role. But overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the acting quality in the film.
A lot of the plot will be familiar to anyone who has played silent hill 3 but there are enough differences to keep the story interesting to even those who have completed the game multiple times. Without spoiling anything, Heather Mason and her father Harry(not their real names.) are on the run from a strange cult who want Heather to return to silent hill for unknown reasons. For the most part I enjoyed the story in Silent Hill Revelation. The pacing is a bit all over the place at times and the ending was dissapointing in my opinion, but overall the films plot had enough to keep me interested to the end. Whereas the original is often criticised for being too long, this film suffers from the exact opposite problem. At just over 90 minutes, SHR just doesn't have enough time to effectively develop it characters and story. In my opinion, another half hour of run time would have made a world of difference.
An important aspect of the games are the terrifying environments and creatures you meet while playing. SHR pretty much nails these very important points. The environments are beautiful and disgusting at the same time and the creatures are just as freaky and abnormal as you'd expect..
I've been thinking long and hard about what rating I should award this film. I was considering awarding it four stars for a time, but four stars generally signifies an excellent film which Silent Hill Revelation certainly isn't. However, I also don't think it's deserved the critical mauling it has received. I enjoyed it and I certainly wouldn't mind viewing it a second or even third time. If that doesn't deserve at least three stars, I don't know what does.",1355184000,48,3138,4.759633027522936

The original ""Silent Hill"" was more thrilling than this 2012 version looks to have combinations of a variety of other horror movies. The sounds from this 2012 movie are loud and clear though, good for theatre viewing. The scares could have been made better if they were more original, rather than being composites of sci-fi and other horror movies. IMO, this last factor seem to ""dilute"" the originality of this movie. I also don't like the ending which came too abruptly.

I still like the plot of the movie which is why I'm giving this movie a high rating. But, it could have been better presented with more originality.

5400497,3,B00A8LYYI0,"I so so so wanted to love this movie. I had such hopes.
My mistake.

The first movie, with all its flaws, is better. Much better.

I've played most of the games (1 & 2 are some of my favorite gaming experiences ever), and what I always enjoyed was the sense of mystery and the general atmosphere of fear and depression, and its the mystery that has stayed with me. Not any of the (few, vague) explanations. Also, like HP Lovecraft or David Lynch the ""monsters"", although supernatural were not your usual wolf-men or vampires or frankensteins monster; because that doesn't scare us anymore, and feels out of place in the world today, old-fashioned (you can still enjoy them, of course, just like you can enjoy the opera, or Michelangelo, or tap-dancing).

Silent Hill's monsters (like in Lovecraft or Lynch) are so great because you cannot reduce them to ""Look out! A vampire - I sure hope they brought some garlic!"" But that was what the long and boring ""explanation"" did in the first Silent Hill movie. They tried to reduce all the mystery to one precise and explicit cause. But only at the end, after about 90 minutes of wonderful atmosphere. This movie does that from the very beginning (it has to, since it's a direct sequel). There is so much boring exposition.

Everything else is also worse - I blame the writer/director: There are some great actors in this one (well, really only cameos - was Malcolm McDowell or Carrie-Anne Moss on set for more than one day?...), but they all give terrible flat performances. The story is not very coherent. The way different characters act, the choices they make, seems entirely to be so as to further the plot, but completely illogical in light of who these people are, or where they come from. The visuals are not bad, but the pacing, the framing, is a lot less interesting this time, and the set design is also less inspired. The music is pretty great, though.

Maybe they wanted to stay true to the game? Maybe they felt people wouldn't like the movie if everything wasn't neatly explained and resolved by the end? What do I know? Maybe they were right about those things? (it's not like ""Inland Empire"" made a ton of money) I wish they had been more daring though, more willing to risk it, willing to make it stranger, more open to interpretation (is it all in her head??), less closure.

There are a few good moments, some nice set pieces, a few good scares, sure. But it is such a wasted opportunity. I so love the idea of Silent Hill. I hope some day someone gets it right.

EDIT: So I just watched it again yesterday, and although I still think this is a huge missed opportunity, going in this time, with a lot lower expectations (obviously) I actually enjoyed it more! It moves at a good pace, there's always something going on, the look of the film is cool (it is Silent Hill, after all), and I wasn't scared once, and nothing makes much sense, but I was entertained nonetheless!",1354665600,3,2934,4.555977229601518

The plot was great for a sequel it made sense and it has A LOT of fan service which i adore. this movie belongs in my collection. in conclusion the movies are much better than the Resident Evil movies where as in those add characters that never existed in the games. Give this movie a chance, its better than you might think. References to many other games in the series, try and see if you can catch them if you are a fan of the games.",1354233600,6,904,4.261627906976744
5400500,5,B00A8LYYI0,"Like the other reviews said, it would have been a good idea to see the first movie if you want to understand this one, but thats the point of having a movie series.

The first one, I thought wasn't scary at all but it was a great movie nothing the less. But since this review isn't about the first movie i won't really talk much about it.

Silent hill revelations, Im going to admit, did go back and relate to everything, which is the back tracking, but it was doing it to explain everything from the first and connecting it. I personally liked it and enjoyed it. Silent hill revelations, the only fault I saw with this movie was it was a tad bit short. That was the only disappointing part of the movie.

Other reviews were talking about how it does bring back part of the game its based off of which would be silent hill 3. Which is where the main character ""heather"" comes from. They do bring in the creepy rabbits, her vest, the emblem, and some of the creatures, with also adding new ones.

When i went to see this, the first half the movie, i was creeped out, not gonna lie, i was gonna end up ripping the arm off the movie theater chair. But the 2nd half the movie, explains how it connects the second movie to the first movie, and relates into the game.  Although it does have parts of 2, where the father goes into silent hill.

The movie overall is creepy and very good. I would highly reccomend this to anyone that is up for a creepy movie, but like any other series out there it would be a good idea to watch the first one before watching one.",1354060800,7,1555,4.201342281879195
5400501,5,B00A8LYYI0,"First off, if you haven't seen the first film, do that prior to watching this one. Not only will this film make better sense, but I consider ""Silent Hill"" to one of the top 100 horror films of all time. Clearly this film was not as good as the first. For me, the element of surprise was gone. This production also suffered from plot weakness, trite dialouge, and an unconvincing role by Adelaide Clemens as the lead character. I kept thinking how much better this film could have been if Ms. Clemens had swapped roles with Jennifer Lawrence in ""House at the End of the Street.""

This film picks up years later as Sharon has grown to 18 years of age and has changed her name to Heather...named after Harry's (Sean Bean) grandmother, the first thing I couldn't buy. He is attempting to live as far away from Silent Hill as possible as long as Heather can be driven there in a few hours, another plot point that didn't make sense, but must of evolved for movie time sake.

So after tearing the film apart, why would I rate it 5 stars? Because I loved it. The horror aspect was done well. They made effective use of darkness, shadows, strobe effects, background noises, whispers, and deformed faceless humans. It is the same reason we watched a dozen or so Jason, Freddie, Puppet Master, or ""Hellraiser"" films long after they became trite.

There were two great scenes that come to mind in this film: the spider was well done, and the arms through the prison bars scenes I also loved. You will know them when you see them.

Parental Guide: F-bombs (I recall 2 by Heather.) No sex. Brief nudity (Rachel Sellan?).",1353715200,,1607,4.512027491408935
5400502,1,B00A8LYYI0,"Rotten Tomatoes gave this movie about 6%. While I cannot say it's that bad...it's pretty darn bad. There are many bad things about this movie.

Now...if you are going to take a plot out of any of the Silent Hill games...Then take it from Silent Hill 2. Because that was the best of the bunch and it had a great mysterious story? Nope...Instead they decided to have a main character from Silent Hill 3... This in and of itself isn't bad. But when they decide to try and make the movie like the game...it is bad. First there is the creepy relationship between the dad and the daughter. Several awkward moments.

Next they make it a habit of dishing out items (like you would in a game) The vest the main character wears, a crest of some type... All of which works nice in a game. But not at all in a movie. It just ends up sounding dumb. It'd be like creating a Zelda movie and focusing the plot on gathering a fishing pole.

Next they bring back characters just to bring them back. The nurses were creepy in the first....but in the second they are just dumb. Not scary at all. Next pyramid head, which is the greatest creepy antagonist of all time is reduced to a puppet this time...Not shining on his own but being a protector of Alessa.

The graphics were awesome. Some of the monsters were to. But there was no plot, nothing developed enough for you to care. It wasn't scary or suspensful. The end boss fight was laughable. I found it more funny than scary. Since they've skipped over the best story in the franchise, I can only imagine where it goes from here. Don't give into any hype. It was a bad movie. It might be worth a rent for a few cents, but nothing more.",1353715200,8,1669,4.305732484076433
5400503,4,B00A8LYYI0,"Silent Hill Revelation 3D Review: Stunning Native 3D Dimension

3D:
If you're looking for the best 3D available in horror cinema, look no further than Silent Hill Revelation 3D. With its stunning, powerful 3D, the characters, demons and monsters are presented with incredible dimension comparable to Avatar 3D and even surpasses the 3D efforts of Resident Evil Afterlife 3D. Not only does it deliver powerful 3D among the best movies 3D has to offer, but also sustains this 3D from start to finish.
The pop outs are second to none, reaching way past the barrier of the screen as monsters strike out at the viewer. Particles like falling ash/snow and a nice variety of scenery, in the city, school, amusement park, etc. I cannot say enough good things about the 3D dimension, depth, pop outs and volume in Silent Hill Revelation. Spectacular 3D.

The film itself follows up the story of Mason (Sean Bean), and his now older adopted Daughter Heather, who is being sought by the evil order of Silent Hill's underworld, to free them from their hell bound prison  by using her as a vessel for their deity. Discovering more as she proceeds, she abandons her hope for a normal life, and re-enters Silent Hill in search of her father and experiences the relentless monsters inhabiting the realm. The story focuses heavily on detailing (back story) as much as possible, why she is there, and how she can resolve her horrifying situation. The sirens return along with the fog, the town with empty buildings, familiar and new monsters and the metal and twisted creatures of the dark realm.

3D Dimension: 10/10
3D Depth: 10/10
3D Volume: 10/10
3D Pop Out: 10/10
3D Overall: 10/10

Story; 7/10 Interesting, but with loose ends and much back story.
Acting: 7/10. Good range of emotion among some decent acting delivery.
Horror: 7/10. Plenty of scare moments, but mostly disturbing imagery.
Visuals: 9/10. Disturbing imagery at every turn with great special FX and monsters.
Gore: 6/10. There are some gory moments, but not many.

Overall: Entertaining visualization of a nightmarish realm in spectacular 3D. Do not pass this one up if you need a horror 3D film to add to your library.",1353715200,36,2171,4.869918699186992
5400504,5,B00A8LYYI0,"I consider the first Silent Hill my favorite horror flick. It has beautiful cinematography, a great cast, nightmarish/disturbing imagery, and some neat monsters. The sequel continues much in this same vein, with returning characters and a few new additions, including Game of Thrones' Kit Harington. For those of you who have played the third game in the series, a direct sequel to the first, this is a fairly accurate adaptation of it--from the characters (love Adelaide as Heather), the monsters (including a cameo of Robbie the Rabbit), and the plot. If you liked the first film, definitely check this one out. It's faster paced, shorter in length, and overall fun little thrill ride.",1353024000,6,687,5.088495575221239
5400505,5,B00A8LYYI0,"DH & I went and seen this last night, it is way better than the first. Some people are upset that it follows the plot of the game (#3) loosely, and if you are expecting an original horror story, you'd better go elsewhere. But if you want to return to Silent Hill, and see all the horror in HD instead of PS2 graininess, this is the movie for you. The nurses and mannequins are especially well done. I was a bit disappointed that it is only 95 minutes long, they could have easily added another 30 minutes of plot from the game.

**************SPOILERS*************

Did anyone else find it weird that she was sitting on her dad's lap? Maybe it's just me, but I outgrew that when I was about 9. In the movie she is supposed to be about 16/17 I think, it really creeped me out. (in the game she is in her 20's?)

I loved how she put that bully in her place at school. lolz

They could have done away with her ""defeating"" Alessa at the carousel, and just had her merge back with herself. Would have made more sense that having a metaphysical showdown with herself. Especially since there is no info conveyed besides a couple of lines and facial expressions. These kinds of scenes work in books, not so much in movies.

I'm guessing from the ending there will be another Silent Hill sometime, but I don't know if they plan on using the plot from the second game (which wouldn't make any sense at all) or if they are going to write an original third film. I haven't played any of the newer Silent Hill games, so I don't know if they have anything to do with Heather or Harry.",1352764800,8,1570,4.29054054054054
