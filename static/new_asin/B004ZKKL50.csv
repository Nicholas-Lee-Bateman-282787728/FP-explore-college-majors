4510104,5,B004ZKKL50,"As other reviewers had said, it is a bummer that there are only 7 episodes, but it's also only 11.99. Also, this is obviously made for small children, so I'm not sure why someone would give it such negative reviews based on an adult point of view. My 3 yo LOVES this DVD.  My son is really into superheroes, but the other ""older"" superhero cartoons were not appropriate for him to view. Shotguns to police officers' faces and such...not appropriate.  This still has some light violence, for lack of a better term, but no one really dies, and they don't use real weapons, ie machine guns. And he thinks they are funny, which they do say some pretty silly stuff, but hey, its for kids! I'm glad I found this so he can still get a taste of super heroes without it being too scary or violent for his age. He's getting Volume 2 for Christmas.",1291507200,,837,4.358974358974359
4510105,5,B004ZKKL50,"Hey you closet toon lovers (You see, that's'... a little rhetorical intimidation to diminish the judgments against a 55 yrs+ aged man who watches toons.) Anyway the truth is that I happened upon this little animated gem quite by accident but haven't missed an episode since. I think the show is brilliant. The writing is hilarious, the pace is excellent and the art is a superb example of removing the seriousness from characters by changing the proportions. The Greek ideal is 7.5 to eight heads and super hero characters often stretch it to 9 heads to emphasize the power i.e. muscular stature. Couple this with the fact that the ""real"" super dudes are employed in clashes with people who aspire to world domination and destroy anything in their way. Nothing humorous in that. So we have proportions more like 5 heads total height creating Super Hero ""Squats""... aka ""Squaties"".
As a child my parents saw and episode of Beanny and Cecil, to see what I was watching. This was a temporary leave of absence from Warner Bros by the great Bob Clampett and the writing WAS that good. My Dad turned to Mom and said ""Half of these gags are over kids heads"". They both unashamedly watched the show and laughed harder than myself. This Super Hero Squad is a modern example of that very thing. I have no grand kids and my own kids have moved out; so I watch them by myself. It beats a lot of alternative programming content on television.
I am sorry the one reviewer chose to take offence at the show as being ""sexist"", the truth is, those who take to accusing content as racist or sexist are in a serious minority. Such labels loose their significance when tossed out so casually. Sexism and racism are sober  and serious practices by disturbed people. This cartoon may offend on some personal level and one has every right to feel such... but these kids' shows are no more guilty of todays' politically correct template than Warner Bros; Disney and MGM toons of yesteryear. And it is that generation that has spawned the anti-war hippies (of which I was one) and the socialistic left-wing cells who have so much influence in today's' political scene. I may seem to exaggerate but its to make a point... those toons did not have any influence on the kids of that era, sufficient to chase away the modern left wing paradigm.
 So let the Squadies Hero up, protect Super Hero City from a bungling Dr Doom squad chase down the fractals of the infinity sword w/o apologies,  and hope Ms. Grouchy-Pants gets over herself.
I hope I didn't offend anyone...I don't consider such to be justified in freedom of expression.",1289433600,2,2603,4.666666666666667
4510106,4,B004ZKKL50,"We purchased this for my 4 year old son, as he loved to watch it on TV. He runs around like a nut when he hears the theme song. My husband and I both actually like this show too. The only drawback about Superhero Squad is they use the word ""hate"" and we've tried to keep that word out of our son's vocabulary as long as possible. Otherwise, it is an excellent, entertaining show.",1284336000,16,379,4.135135135135135
4510107,4,B004ZKKL50,"This show is great for small kids who love superheroes!  Our son is a long time fan of several Marvel characters and this show makes
them more accessible for small children.  The adventures are cute and very funny, even for parents who like comics!  If you can
accept that the characters are obviously going to be more friendly and gentled-down for kids, then the show is a fun way to share
tv time with your little hero.

I was disappointed that there were only 7 episodes on the dvd however.  We are looking forward to more volumes.  Be warned tho, the theme song is VERY catchy, written by former Nerfherder headman Parry Gripp and you'll soon be singing it with your little hero in
the car when you're driving around.

4510108,5,B004ZKKL50,"The grandchildren love these episodes of the superhero squad.  I'm glad I brought it because the t.v. shows do not come on anymore.

4510109,4,B004ZKKL50,"Great show for my kids but also some in jokes for those of us who know the real Marvel characters and a couple of puns that will go right over kids' heads.  My biggest and guess only complaint is that there is only 7 out of the 26 episodes from the first season.  It appears to be the first seven episodes.  The stories on the show are minimally based on any actual classic Marvel story (although the episode title screen is a re-imagined comic cover).  Basic good guy vs. bad guy with main characters of Iron Man, Hulk, Surfer, Thor, Falcon, Wolverine, Reptil vs. Dr. Doom, Abomination and MODOK.  A lot of esoteric guest characters and every character is given one obvious personality quirk.  Again this is really for little kids but you'll laugh too.

The episodes are:
And Lo...A Pilot Shall Come!
This Silver, This Surfer!
Hulk Talk Smack!
To Err is Superhuman!
Enter: Dormammu!
A Brat Walks Among Us!
Oh Brother!

Also there's bonus features of an interview with Stan Lee, the video of the theme song and a trailer for the video game.",1279411200,36,1040,4.553763440860215

I had to return the first set I bought because discs 2 and 4 had no volume at all.  Otherwise, it's OK.  The humor is OK since it's aimed at kids, and it's not dark or depressing.

Is that seriously what we've come to, is that really the only way people think comedy can be accomplished? I mean the 3 stooges still delight people generation after generation without it.

We watch some TV, mainly educational (PBS, SPROUT) but we came across the Superher Squad and she fell in love with it. I couldn't believe it was only 2 seasons!

My only complaint about this release is about the DVD itself. In watching the episode, ""Villainy Redux Syndrome"" the video and audio skips briefly for 10 seconds or so. I bought 3 copies of this DVD from three different retailers and played each one both on my DVD player, PS3, and computers, and the same glitch happened. I contacted Shout!

I read the reviews and it seemed like the only superhero DVD out there for the ""preschool"" age group.  We got the DVD today and I had to turn it off after only 20 minutes.  The story was very violent (fighting, hitting, blasting, kicking) and also very crude (bad guys burping, farting, etc).  I expected the Superhero Squad ""hero's"" to be a great example for kids, but most of their interactions with each other are very negative (Hulk is a mean little brat/bully, etc), in many of the scenes the superhero's seemed annoyed with each other and make annoyed faces behind their backs.  Not role models for ANY age group, and most definitely NOT for a 4 year old.  My son was fascinated by it, but he did comment a couple times that everyone was ""mean"" in it.

Don't get me wrong...I knew a DVD about superhero's fighting bad guys would have some level of violence in it, but it was much, much more than I would have expected .  And the overall negative tone of the characters was a turn off.",1307059200,39,1105,4.435643564356436

I was a little worried after reading the reviewer who gave it 1 star saying its a sexist show.  I must say she loves the show as do I.  I grew up loving superhero's and was very excited when my little girl decided she loved them as well.  I looked into this show when her latest obsession took her to Wolverine, who is a little dark in regular adult and teen cartoons.  Perhaps the greatest thing about this show is that the superhero's never take off their costumes, it tends to confuse her when they are out of suit.  As for it being sexist, in one episode the hulk(being the dimwit he is) was going to smash a little girl who posed a problem for them, when they other superhero's stepped in and said ""We don't smash little girls"" and another chimed in ""or big ones"".

It did the job, but I thought it relied too much on gross-out humor, and the pacing and editing was waaaay too fast.  Not sure I'll purchase any more episodes of this one.",1489968000,,251,4.319148936170213

8450162,5,B004ZKKL50,"Just as much fun as when I was 6 years old and buying the first Avengers, Spider-man, Hulk, Fantastic Four, etc comic books. One of the best cartoon theme songs ever and multi-layered parts for kids and old comic geeks (such as me) to enjoy. One episode has the shortest and maybe best portrayal of The Punisher ever (sorry Netflix). Even after repeated watching me I just can't get enough of the Squadie's!",1474848000,,407,4.589041095890411
