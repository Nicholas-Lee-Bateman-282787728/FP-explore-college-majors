8474240,5,B005I59ALC,Tough workout but you get results. Lots of jumping jacks and squats in this dvd. Be careful if you have bad knees.,1469577600,,114,4.2272727272727275
8474241,5,B005I59ALC,"This workout really needs to be used with a treadmill (or other piece of cardio equipment). In the real workout, they're running on the bridge and stopping at points to do strength training with a band or body weight, and a treadmill is the best way to get that experience. You CAN follow the split-screen instructions to do jumping jacks and running in place during the running segments, but the workout isn't nearly as good when done that way -- it's downright boring and can be tough on the knees, too. I've had this workout for several years and tried all variations of it. With my treadmill, I do it frequently, but I wouldn't bother if I didn't have one.

With a treadmill, if you're running about 6 mph, you get roughly 2.5 miles of running plus a full-body workout in 53 minutes. It's very tough but I don't dread it at all. The scenery is great, the music is decent, and Ariane is a great instructor. The bands that come with the workout are lighter resistance, so if you want the heavier blue bands, you can order them directly from her, which I did. With time, I've varied the exercises themselves, too, to keep the workout fresh (e.g. doing pullups instead of the band for the back).

I really wish she'd make another workout. I have hundreds of workouts but this is one I revisit regularly. If you have a treadmill or an elliptical and you fight boredom on it like most of us, check out this workout. Also, if you prefer cardio over strength but you know you need to get your weights in, check out this workout.",1410393600,3,1524,4.439285714285714
8474242,5,B005I59ALC,"I really do love this workout-yes there are a lot of jumping jacks,which a lot of reviewers complained about. I just use my mini trampoline and really don't mind,as the scenery seems to make them go by faster. I also love the band moves thrown in and I always
feel so strong and exhilarated when I complete this workout. Like other reviewers stated,you can substitute other cardio excercises for the jumping jacks-as long as you're keeping your heart rate up. I have been trying to add this to my rotation at least twice a week,as I
read that a lot of reviewers got great results.",1390608000,,580,4.533333333333333
8474243,5,B005I59ALC,"I think this is a fantastic workout.  I don't do it that much because I'm more of a fan of splitting my time between pure cardio and barre/pilates workouts, but every now and then a good bootcamp is in order.  I used to do a very hard core bootcamp class a few times a week and this equals that- and you get to do it at home!  It's clear that the instructor knows what she is doing- the moves will definitely get you in shape!  I work-out quite a bit, and am familiar with good form, so I didn't notice any lack of form cues that other reviewers mentioned.  If you are just starting to work-out, this may be too intense, but you can always just do what you can.  I also really love the feeling that I am a part of the class and am working out outside in Manhattan, even though I'm in my little apartment in Philly!",1364083200,2,814,4.05625
8474244,2,B005I59ALC,"I got the DVD from a friend who took the instructor's class. The pros: the DVD has the split screen with option to do the exercises at home. It contains nice footage of NYC skylines. The cons: the instructor doesn't always explain the exercise or talk about good forms and proper techniques. She just lurks from one exercise to the next. Her instructions are hard to hear at times. I'm all about fast- paced workout but safety and good forms are important, too. One can tell that this instructor is a fan of Jilian Michaels from the way she borrows Michaels lines.",1359158400,,564,4.53921568627451
8474245,2,B005I59ALC,I have received the DVD with no bands! can you pls send me the bands. there is no point of having the DVD if no bands are included in the box.,1345852800,,142,3.6129032258064515
8474246,5,B005I59ALC,"Ariane Hundt's ""Brooklyn Bridge Boot Camp"" DVD is an intense, high impact, and sweat-inducing workout, filmed stylistically as if you were running across the Brooklyn Bridge.  This has a lot of jumps and it includes strength training.  For me, this workout was a nice change from other workouts and I liked that it was slightly different.
