8515929,4,B007FTNRV8,"Great performances. But someone is going to have to explain the ending to me. The whole thing with the police station at the end was something they do repeatedly? The woman cop who pulled Gerry over just doesn't know about it because she's new there, but her superior at the station knows about it? How? So Joan just pretends to be dead? And she has done so before? Why? Who called the cop and told her a body was found in the woods by a dog walker? Why does Gerry cry when he sees Joan in the police station. Was that genuine? Had he come to believe she was not going to come and get him out? What is going on? Please tell me. Seriously. I can't sleep.",1511481600,,653,4.109375

8515932,5,B007FTNRV8,"Excellent--one of the better films I've seen in years. Not for all tastes--disturbing content. Edgy and interesting,  perfectly acted. Superb.",1365638400,,142,6.1
8515933,5,B007FTNRV8,"Sweet!!!
Especially sweet if you like stories of sociopaths playing psyche-games on people. Yes, it can be very disturbing if you are not detached and interested in how sociopaths think.

They did their little psycho-dramas for fun and to test of their and imposition skills and they are good.

I laughed. I cried.

It should be an HBO series.",1361836800,,343,4.779661016949152
8515934,4,B007FTNRV8,"I love these unexpected gems...the ones with the twists you'd never expect.  Like ""The Perfect Host"", ""The Wife"", or even ""Downloading Nancy"", ""Secretary"", or ""Freeway""...etc.  ""Silver Tongues"" follows a sociopathic/psychopathic couple over the course of a long weekend, allowing the viewer access to an unexpected, amoral, soulless peek into their lives.

I'd give it a solid 4-1/2 stars, easy.",1347840000,,395,5.661016949152542
8515935,4,B007FTNRV8,"I love Lee Tergesen's performance in this film.  So icy cold!  If you love HBO's series ""Oz"", this is for you.  This is a great thriller that keeps you guessing until the end.  It isn't your ordinary popcorn movie.  The story draws you in like no other film I've seen recently.",1340755200,,277,4.352941176470588
8515936,1,B007FTNRV8,"I want my five bucks back.

----Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product? Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.",1338508800,,192,4.333333333333333
8515937,5,B007FTNRV8,"This Slamdance Audience Award winner is modern tension at its best.  The story revolves around a pair of con artists and their various scams.

Razor sharp dialogue, compelling acting, and an ending that will make you want to watch it again and again.

Love this movie.",1336003200,2,268,4.782608695652174
