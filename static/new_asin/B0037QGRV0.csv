4081585,4,B0037QGRV0,"The previews would have you believe this will be an over-the-top revenge farce, and certainly the presence of John C. Reilly (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Step-Brothers/dp/B001G5T6GW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Step Brothers</a>) and Jonah Hill (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superbad/dp/B000WZEZGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superbad</a>) would draw anyone to that conclusion. However, this 2010 film is far darker and melancholy than I expected. There are small-scale laughs, but the Duplass brothers, Mark and Jay, have something else in mind here. Sharing writing and directing responsibilities, they have created a movie where the three lead characters find themselves in an awkward triangle in which each struggles to come to terms with the situation at hand. With hand-held camerawork from Jas Shelton and the somewhat hesitant pacing set forth by the Duplasses, the resulting dramedy has a ramshackle tone with a surprising edge of suspense that undercuts the pervasive uncertainty in the story being told.

The slight plot focuses on John, a depressed, middle-aged film editor living alone and still not over his divorce from seven years earlier. In fact, he still clings onto his patient ex-wife Jamie and is shattered to find out she is getting married again. She encourages him to go to a party where he immediately gets drunk on shots of Red Bull and vodka. After several failed attempts at conversation, he meets the woman of his dreams, Molly, who is as beautiful as he is socially inept. She finds herself drawn to John's honesty and tenderness, and things go swimmingly until he meets her grown son. His name is Cyrus, and he's actually close to 22, unemployed and still living at home. There is something unsettling about Cyrus whether it's the way he calls his mother by her first name or the pretentiously synthesized music he composes. When things turn serious between John and Molly, everyone starts to feel the co-dependencies unwind in their lives with unexpected ramifications.

The Duplasses selected well in their casting. Reilly brings out the eager awkwardness in John without compromising the fact that he leans far too much on Jamie than either would readily admit. As always, Catherine Keener uses her sharp intelligence and no-nonsense manner effectively in the subsidiary role of Jamie. As Molly, Marisa Tomei balances a fine line between loving and permissive in playing a mother who only sees her son's seemingly vulnerable state, and as she did in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wrestler/dp/B001TOD92C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wrestler</a>, she is not afraid to tread uncertain waters as a character actress. The big surprise is Hill in the title role. Heretofore known for likeable wiseacre parts mainly in the Judd Apatow comedy factory, he brings an unsettling stillness to what could have been purely a comically malevolent role. The plot threads tie up a bit too neatly at the end, but the provocative nature of the film keeps you guessing what exactly have the characters learned from their plight.",1277683200,3,3175,5.72457627118644

I think they are more accurate. No hype, no plants, no dumb 1 star reviewing like, hey my case was cracked when it arrived so 1 star. You know the type. So. I am writing this review because of all the 1 star reviews. Read them. They are actually pretty factual. I agree with several of them that I just read. Yes, the cinematography is just awful. Yes I wanted to turn it off. I must add I wanted to give up several times. Yes I don't think it is funny and wonder why it is billed as a comedy. The person who lent me the movie thinks it is funny. Its not. What it is, is, its a good movie. I don't know what the director and the script writer had intended for the audience to experience watching this movie. If it is what I think it is, they were very successful. I was ho hum about this movie. Till the end. Then I realized I had just watched a very good movie. The acting was good. They portrayed the characters very well. The story is there and you are entertained. The movement of the camera. Its some new style that has come about and Im not happy with it. It more annoying to me in concert videos where i want to watch the band play and the camera man has had one to many pills of speed and is all over the place. Deal with the camera work and enjoy this movie. See if you realize at the end that 1, it is good and 2, John C Reilly does a fine job with his part. They all do.",1420070400,,1555,3.893081761006289

4081611,5,B0037QGRV0,"First off let me just say that I'm giving this 5 stars for the movie in general. I really like this movie and think it's a refreshing take on Comedy & Drama that has certainly impacted me enough to want to watch it multiple times.

I've already seen this movie a couple times but was sparked by something to want to watch it again. I COULD simply use one of the many FREE streaming sites but since this movie's at least 4 years old and only made 10 million to begin with in sales, I figured I should undoubtedly be able to legitly stream it for incredibly cheap. But alas, to my extreme shock it's still $10 to buy a streamable copy!?!?!?!?!?!? and $3 to stream it once?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! Are you f**king kidding me???? What a f**king rip off! If it was $1 I would easily do it, but once again Amazon and Hollywood continues to alienate the world as they constantly attempt to hustle everyone out of more and more money, refusing to adequately price their streaming movies. And the sad part is, I bet in 5 years this will still cost $3 to stream. So, now I will go watch this for free. Sorry Mark Duplass, I wanted to support you for this good movie, but it's not worth it.",1419811200,,1170,4.294117647058823

4081614,2,B0037QGRV0,"Kids these days use the word awkward as sort of a call out for whenever they find a situation
uncomfortable. Kind of like they use the word wicked as a call out when something was cool. Well, we
all know life can have its awkward moments. There are times when you just want to throw your hands
up in the air and say, How weird can this get?
But should you worry about how awkward a movie can be?
Cyrus tells the story of a couple (John and Molly) who immediately hit it off at a partyand after the
party! John (played by John C. Reilly) is a social misfit who takes his dating cues from his exwife (played
by Catherine Keener) who still visits his house way too much (um all awkward?). Well, in her own way
Molly (played by Marisa Tomei) is also awkward. Why? Because of her son, Cyrus (played by Jonah Hill)
who is well, you guess.
Hill plays Cyrus masterfully. The character is a 22 year old who not only still lives with his mother but is
way too attached. Like, go get yourself on Dr. Phil attached. So when this new love interest enters the
picture, you can predict how the son is going to react.
The problem is that all this strange behavior, odd reactionsall these issuesare not nearly
entertaining enough. I get what relatively new filmmakers and brothers, Jay and Mark Duplass, are
trying to do. They want you to feel so uncomfortable that any relief is comic relief. And the relief comes,
no doubt, in a funny sparring match between son and boyfriend you just knew was coming. But its not
enough.
Keeners character is getting remarried and invites her exhusband Reillys character and Molly to the
wedding. Really? Cyrus invites himself via his enabling mother. Yikes! And whatever you imagine can
happen at the event happens. And its uncomfortable all rightbut not because its based in reality.
Marisa Tomei is wonderful in this film, and Im not just saying that because she is one of the prettiest
actresses working today. Well, maybe thats part of it. But she does play the part of a mother with her
own set of issues very well. Really all of these actors turn in outstanding performances. Its just not
enough to make it any less painful to watch.
So if you really want to squirm in your seat and marvel at just how screwed up people are, Cyrus is your
movie",1408406400,,2270,4.446043165467626

4081620,4,B0037QGRV0,"The story is a bit odd and it is serious at times. The comedy is so so, but it is a little more original than most stories.",1399939200,,123,3.5925925925925926
4081621,4,B0037QGRV0,"The plot of CYRUS is straightforward: Joihn (John C. Reilly) falls in love with Molly (Marisa Tomei), but finds his amorous advances frustrated by Molly's son Cyrus (Jonah Hill), who cannot contemplate the idea of his mother seeing someone else and leaving him (Cyrus) alone.  John and Cyrus end up fighting with one another, but the film ends by suggesting some kind of reconciliation between the three of them.  What distinguishes Jay and Mark Duplass' film is its underlying sense of irony: just like Cyrus, John appears unable (or unwilling) to allow his nearest and dearest to live their own lives.  John is perpetually conversing with his ex-wife Jamie (Catherine Keener), while remaining blissfully oblivious to the fact that Jamie is about to marry Tim (Matt Walsh).  Like Cyrus, John cannot let go: the two protagonists are uncannily similar to one another.  It is only at the end of the film that both of them come to recognize their kinship.  The film is shot in quasi-documentary style, with the camera perpetually encircling the characters' faces, punctuated by occasional zooms.  This gives CYRUS an intense quality: the directors will not allow us to focus on other aspects of the mise-en-scene.  The characters matter.  The script (also by the Duplass brothers) contains more than its fair share of ironies.  Definitely worth watching.",1391299200,,1351,5.1

4081624,3,B0037QGRV0,"Cyrus (2011) has a great concept: A lonely middle-ager (John C. Reilly) who is still very much dependent on his ex-wife is looking for love and miraculously hooks up with a very cute single lady (Marisa Tomei). The problem is her relationship with her 22-year-old man-child son (Jonah Hill) is dependent to the max. The film has its moments. Reilly is his usual funny self and Hill is great as the manipulative Cyrus. Spunky Tomei is cute as a button and does well as the enabling mother. But there's something keeping Cyrus from being a 4-star film that I can't quite put my finger on (in addition to the corny ""all's-well-that-ends-well"" conclusion).",1374451200,,652,4.830357142857143

4081626,3,B0037QGRV0,"No, this is not a film you will likely return to view more than once.  Although the picture quality and audio are fine (subtitles included!), the story is rather boring.  The draw is the ACTORS (John C. Reilly, Jonah Hill, and Marisa Tomei) who are all TERRIFIC, especially given a trying piece of work.  THEY are the only thing that make viewing this film worth it.

A story about a young man's (played by Jonah Hill) unwillingness to let go of his mother-attachment is not new, and even Jonah's portrayal suggested he also might have thought it kind of stupid, but he played it with his special skill and made it sort of funny!

John C. Reilly and Marisa Tomei each reveal their seasoned experience as actors and don't disappoint.

It's about his character looking desperately for a relationship after a dramatic break-up between him and his ex, so he stumbles across a woman while visiting a house party (while urinating on the ground outside, haha) and from there... weird things happen.

The two hit it off, and he eventually meets the womans son, and it turns out the son has serious issues ""upstairs"" if you get my drift! Of course, John Reilly doesn't want to come right out and tell the boys mother that something is wrong with him because that's her precious baby boy and, as you can probably imagine, you absolutely can NOT stand between two family members! No way!!  Especially a mother and son!!

He's 22 years old, and spends his days moping around the house and picking on John simply because he's the guy dating his mother. He likes to find ways to torment John Reilly's character either by stealing his things, or just messing with him mentally. He's almost never as clever as it appears, however.  I thought he was really darn smart at first but we eventually find out that's not exactly true.

For the longest time, the plot development leads the viewers into thinking something is seriously wrong with the mother as well, because the way she communicates with her son is quite odd to say the least. They are both extremely close, and I was honestly waiting for a bomb shell announcement that her son was actually her boyfriend! No, that never happens, haha.

There's a nice message at the end of the film though, but I won't spoil what it is because it relates to the plot. Overall, I was laughing, feeling confused (in an appealing kind of way), and constantly wondering where it was heading. Good movie.",1310601600,,1739,4.666666666666667

Because it is impossible to absorb any of it because of the absolute ridiculous cinematography employed. I cannot find the words to describe how bad it is.

4081673,4,B0037QGRV0,"I've read recently that Hollywood has more or less abandoned making original films, instead opting for more safe bets like remakes, sequels or films based on marketable ideas such as comic books. Last year the only original film to make a splash was INCEPTION and the suits in Hollywood began by saying it wouldn't do go, then it wouldn't last and finally it was just a fluke. That's sad because there are some great stories out there that can be told. CYRUS is one of those.

John C. Reilly stars as John, a depressed ex-husband who's still dealing with the loss of his wife 7 years after they parted ways. The ex, Jamie (Catherine Keener), shows up at his house one night to let him know she's going to be getting married and to invite him to a party where she hopes he can meet someone new.

John finally gives in and goes, attempting to charm the women he meets and failing miserably. Until he meets Molly (Marisa Tomei). Molly sees John as something different than most guys, an honest man willing to express his feelings openly. The two end up sharing John's bed that night and the next with Molly mysteriously leaving before the end of the night. When John follows her the third night, he discovers why.

It seems that Molly failed to mention that she has a son. Cyrus (Jonah Hill) is a 21 year old young man who still lives with his mother. While Molly is out, Cyrus invites John in and they begin to talk to one another. Molly arrives to find the two men in her life getting along and John stays for dinner and over night.

All seems to be going well. With the exception that the next morning John's shoes are missing. Added to that are subtle signs that he begins to read coming from Cyrus. As the film progresses we realize that Cyrus appears fine with the idea of his mother becoming involved with John, but inside he wants things as they've always been, just the two of them alone.

John's willing to fight for Molly, the woman of his dreams, but eventually he sees that there is little way for him to compete against Cyrus. What mother would take the word of a man she's just recently met over the word of her only child? Just how John can get back with Molly, discovering if there is a way to get around Cyrus and attempting to make true love work is the focus of the film.

Reilly is a hit or miss actor. In some roles he is amazing and in others he just seems to be playing the same guy over and over again. Here he does a great job as an average guy who wants love so bad and is afraid of being hurt by losing it again. Tomei is gorgeous as ever, playing the role of concerned parent and woman looking for love equally well. Hill turns in another great comedic performance but this time adds to his character by seeming to be a tad psycho at the same time.

The movie is photographed in a documentary style with quick zooms in and out that can be a big unnerving. But if you can get past that, you have a chance to witness a warm romantic comedy that delivers on all levels.",1298592000,2,2992,4.284955752212389

4081679,3,B0037QGRV0,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

No, I don't usually like movies that feature quite a bit of improvisation and jerky cinematography. Nonetheless, 'Cyrus' has enough crazy moments in it, that it's actually kind of funny. This is not your usual laugh out loud comedy. Rather, it's a farce where we're asked to laugh at (not with) a set of sharply defined, passive-aggressive character types.

A central characteristic of the passive-aggressive personality type is that he/she rarely is able to express anger in a direct, forceful way. Instead, the anger is expressed in a series of short, aggressive bursts and passive retreats. The passive aggressive personality lives in a pressure cooker and inevitably must end up exploding. But once the explosion is over, they will end up where they started: in the same passive aggressive holding pattern, leading nowhere. Passive aggressives can also be thought of as belonging to the larger family of masochists who enjoy inflicting pain on themselves by not really letting go of their anger--by the same token, they appear to enjoy engaging in minor skirmishes, where they may win a minor battle or two but never can truly claim victory in an 'all out war'.

At the outset of 'Cyrus', we see that we're dealing with some very screwed up passive aggressive types. John's ex-wife, Jamie, aggressively enters his house without telling him and then catches him masturbating. At first, her reaction is normal, heading for the door, shrieking with great embarrassment after catching him in the act. But after listening to his lame explanation that he had ""jock itch"", Jamie passively tells him she didn't see anything and the confrontation dies.

If the characters in Cyrus were merely neurotic losers, the film wouldn't be very funny. Wisely, the film's scenarists, the Duplass brothers, also infuse their characters with some endearing qualities. John is spontaneous when he leads a group of party goers in the Human League's 80s hit, 'Don't you want me baby'; Cyrus has some great talent as a keyboardist/composer of electronic pop music; Molly is uninhibited and non-judgmental when she acts on her sexual impulses and Jamie is a supportive ex to John who suffers from low self-esteem.

But despite all the endearing qualities, the Oedipal conflict is too strong from preventing the two male suitors from going to war over the affections of Molly, torn in her roles as both mother and lover. There's a great scene after John moves in with Molly where they're about to make passionate love in the living room when Cyrus (who has let himself in), casually turns on the light and in a deadpan delivery, blurts out, ""Sorry for interrupting"". Instead of expressing their true feelings of genuine anger over having their lovemaking interrupted, John meekly exclaims, ""Good to see you"" and Molly, in an even more weak and half-assed voice, whispers, ""Hi!""

There are other moments where Cyrus will do something outrageous such as going into the bathroom while his mother is taking a shower and John passively stews but takes no action. Not all of Cyrus' stratagems are necessarily passive aggressive posturing. When he decides to move out of his mother's house, he's clearly trying to manipulate her and succeeds; she's so wracked with guilt that she welcomes him back with open arms when he informs John that he intends to move back in (there's also a short kiss on the lips betraying the incestuous relationship that exists between mother and son).

Molly is also guilty of blatant passivity in the form of being a classic enabler. She's constantly making excuses for Cyrus by maintaining that he's been ""going through so much"" (taken in by his fake panic attacks and outright manipulative behavior). John's ex-wife, Jamie, also has a problem in confronting reality when she tells John that she believes Molly and Cyrus are perfectly normal--ignoring Cyrus' quirky behavior in ordering John to climb a tree, act like a 'jaguar' and scream at the top of his lungs.

The Second Act 'dark moment' (if you can call it that), is when John and Cyrus get into a fight at Jamie's wedding. Cyrus explodes in a jealous rage over John and Molly's continuing relationship and John retaliates over Cyrus hiding his shoes. This incident actually causes John to step out of his passive aggressive ways and speak plainly to Molly, when he asserts, ""Open your eyes"". The acceptance of reality is short-lived: Cyrus passively begs John's forgiveness, invites him back to the house and John meekly accepts at the film's end. Presumably, this truce will be short-lived and one has the distinct expectation that the minor border war between John and Cyrus will pick up soon enough again.

'Cyrus' is really a one joke idea focusing on the unhealthy relationship between the two male principals. The humor comes in the variations of the passive aggressive behavior of the characters. 'Cyrus' is not unlike Larry David's 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' which is another kind of study of the passive aggressive personality. Not everyone will dig the humor of 'Cyrus'; but for the more patient film-goer, there are moments of true mirth that will pop up, as this exercise in passive aggressive shenanigans, plods along to its fitful conclusion.",1296000000,6,5253,5.014908256880734

4081692,5,B0037QGRV0,"I remember this getting very good reviews upon its theatrical release but, it was in and out in a short time so, it didn't seem to pick up much steam. This is the kind of movie for which video was meant. Anyone and everyone can have access at any time. You don't need to live near a highly populated area or an art house theater that could support this type of release.

I was looking forward to seeing this but I wasn't prepared for just how good it would be. This is independent film making at its best. It's all writing and acting. There are only a few sets and characters here. The music is played by only a few instruments but it's great. It's shot and cut well so there are no distractions pulling the viewer away from what is happening on the screen.

John C. Reilly has been divorced from Catherine Keener for seven years and has really never gotten over it. He meets Marisa Tomei at a party and things instantly begin to look up. As their relationship gets deeper a dark cloud appears in the form of her 22 year old son (played with major creepiness by Jonah Hill). He still lives with mom and they have a very peculiar relationship. Though it's a co-dependent sort of thing it becomes clear during the proceedings who the manipulator is. Will the love birds find true happiness in the end.

The writing here is as good as I've ever seen. Certain scenes work on so many levels they require more than one viewing to digest them. I like Reilly but, for my money, this is far and away the best he's ever done. Likewise, I like Tomei, and again she shows herself to be one of the best actresses around. Jonah Hill has done well in his other outings but, again, here he's over and above. Keener is always good, as she is here but maybe not more so than in her other films.

I cannot say enough about this movie. It's so unexpected in so many ways. It rarely takes the turns you expect. Everyone involved seemed to 'get it.' If you like indy movies you may want to move this to the head of the line. It's well worth it.",1295049600,4,2022,4.2578125
4081693,2,B0037QGRV0,Not a funny movie. Still hit the mark because it wasn't intended to be... Acting was good.. gave 2 stars b/c it was marketed as a funny movie and I think that's BS..

4081694,5,B0037QGRV0,"A film starring John C. Reilly and Jonah Hill is going to attract a certain audience...And that is not the correct audience for this film. While Reilly is an accomplished dramatic actor, he's become well-known for appearing in successful comedies lately; Hill is best-known for his work in the Apatow-cannon. Cyrus is the type of film the average moviegoer dismisses as ""too weird"" or ""not funny,"" which both miss the point entirely. To use a term I'm not fond of, Cyrus is a ""dramedy,"" that seamlessly blends both comedy and drama avoiding cheap punchlines and dramatic, emotional cues. If you think Step Brothers is the ""best movie ever"" and you're expecting typical Jonah Hill-fare, this is not your movie. If you watch it with an open mind, you'll find it quite rewarding.

John C. Reilly plays John, still wallowing in loneliness seven years after his divorce. Now, his ex-wife Jamie (Catherine Keener) is getting re-married and she takes John to a party in the hope that he'll find himself a girlfriend. He does, in the form of a beautiful woman named Molly (Marisa Tomei). When John becomes curious about Molly's secretive nature he follows her home and meets her 21-year-old son Cyrus (Hill). Cyrus comes off a bit weird, but friendly but John notices the relationship between Molly and Cyrus is rather unconventional; they share a close bond that borders on the near incestuous. John becomes suspicious of Cyrus' motives very quickly, but finds himself in a rut not wanting to damage his new relationship with Molly.

The film moves at a very quick pace and boasts a solid script although writer/directors Jay & Mark Duplass do allow their actors a lot of room for improvisation. Their characters are rather unconventional, but realistic and the film plays off their reactions to the awkwardness around them perfectly. There's a refreshing dynamic between the characters too, especially between John and his ex-wife Jamie. This is not a bickering, spiteful former couple but a mature, supporting one. They have a camaraderie with each other that we don't see often and it doesn't seem like a stretch. The always reliable Catherine Keener is perfectly charming and believable as a woman who wants her ex-husband to find happiness and is willing to set aside important things in her life to lend an ear.

Much of the film is an exercise in understatement. Reilly has proved his acting chops, but it's nice to see him take a break to do something a bit more down-to-earth. He nails the role of the confused, but well-meaning John who has finally found something special and is determined to make it work. Tomei is always good at playing sweet, but she has to add a level of maturity, dedication, and obliviousness with slightly Oedipal overtones into a convincing, subtle performance. In doing this, she makes a complicated role effortless. Hill hasn't gotten too much notice for his performance, but it's a substantial turn from his typical stuff. The role of Cyrus requires Hill to seem well-mannered, manipulative, and child-like while still getting an audience to empathize with him. This is a psychologically complex role that Hill really steps up to the plate for. His performance as Cyrus is
really something special and a small step into proving himself as an actor that can handle both comedy and drama. While he doesn't completely abandon that Jonah Hill persona, there are more layers to this performance than many will admit or give him credit for.

The roles are well-written, but it's the understated performances that really bring these characters off the page. Had any actor made a slight misstep, it could've derailed the film's credibility. This is especially true in a film that relies on character interaction, where the slightest wrong nuance could've killed a whole scene's credibility. This is a film that relies on it's actors ability and there's some great comedic banter between John and Cyrus, each trying to gain the upper hand for Molly's affection juxtaposed with some very realistic, dramatic exchanges. The dialogue isn't flashy movie dialogue; it's very subtle, straight-forward and has much more of an impact in the loose, improvisational delivery.

The film's cinematography (even for those who don't know what cinematography is) may take some getting used too. It makes frequent use of the zoom lens and feels amateurish, but it eventfully becomes apparent that it's perfectly suited for the tone of the movie. As I said, this is not a film for the people the marketing tried to gear it towards. Many will be disappointed, but you've been warned.

Cyrus is a wonderful surprise. An understated, underrated, low-key blend of comedy and drama that provides chuckles and a fair amount of poignancy. It's a smart film that gives some terrific actors the chance to really make use of their skills and it's one of my favorite films of 2010. If you're in the mood for something a little different, you'll find Cyrus to be quite a treat.

What is supposed to be a platform for John C. Reilly to become the next -- albeit brick-and-mortar-faced -- David Morse (sans Will Ferrett) turns out to be nothing more than a yawn of varying halitoses. Oh, don't get me wrong, it's edgy by network TV standards, but so is chugging a wine cooler while watching Katie Couric's colonoscopy.

Instead, we get a small, wry and occasionally uncomfortable drama with moments of dry, self-effacing humor.  That's not a bad thing...but I wasn't prepared to laugh so LITTLE.  In fact, my wife and I laughed about 6 times, and that was 6 times more than the rest of the audience we saw it with.

What I really should say is that the film stars Marisa Tomei (IN THE BEDROOM), John C. Reilly (MAGNOLIA), Catherine Keener (LOVELY & AMAZING) and Jonah Hill in an uncharacteristically serious performance.  Reilly is a loser, something he plays very well.  A nice but shy guy who still isn't over his dissolved marriage to Keener.  She invites him to a party, and despite some silly behavior, Tomei takes an interest in him, and the two start a relationship that is both tentative and passionate.  Reilly is the kind of guy who really needs a woman in his life to spark him to action.  And Tomei has the certain fragility that only Tomei can portray.  All would be low-key but fine, if it weren't for the fact that Tomei also has a grown son (Hill) who still lives at home.  Hill's level of ambition makes Reilly look like a power-broker...in fact, all Hill is good at is nurturing his uncomfortably close relationship with his mother.  He embarks on an effort to drive Reilly away from his mom.  Reilly understands what is happening, but is at least savvy enough to know that if he wants to fight back, he needs to do it in a way that will keep Tomei unaware.

The cat-and-mouse game between Hill & Reilly is the primary plot of the film.  Hill is initially the aggressor (or passive-aggressor might be more accurate), but Reilly fights back admirably.  This battle may SOUND funny, but it is only very modestly amusing.  We may smile or chuckle at some of the games these two play...but really, it's deadly serious stuff for these two.  It's the opposite of the over-the-top battles for dominance that Reilly engaged in with Will Farrell in STEP BROTHERS.  We actually can believe that these are real people having these battles.

Reilly is the heart of the film.  It's mostly told from his point of view, and he is a master of this kind of intelligent, shy, self-aware schlub.  He knows he's very, very lucky to be involved with a woman as gorgeous as Tomei.  But he's also very believable showing affection and interest.  He starts out as a loser that's very hard to like, but we see the more assertive and loveable version of him emerging as the film goes on.  It's one of his more nuanced performances in quite awhile.

Hill is creepy, pure and simple.  His performance is mostly physical.  He stands a little too close to people.  He stares at them a little too long and intently.  He wanders into rooms when it's clearly inappropriate to do so.  He mostly speaks in a monotone that SEEMS friendly, but is laced with anger or dread or even malice.  He seems DANGERSOUS, not funny.  At any moment, you can imagine him snapping and literally trying to harm others or himself.  This is not the stuff of wacky comedy.

Tomei is always a delight, and it's easy to see why these men are drawn to her.  I wouldn't say she brings anything new to the role...but she still brings her A-game.  Keener's role is relatively small, but she's always welcome in anything.  Her character is a little softer than some of the brittle, heartless women she's been asked to play recently.

In the end, your enjoyment of CYRUS will mostly equal your enjoyment of the 3 starring performances.  Plot specifics won't stick with you for long.  There are few lines that stick to the memory.  For me, even though I really like Reilly, Tomei & Keener...there just wasn't quite enough substance to make me whole-heartedly embrace the film.  I appreciated that it was very dark and didn't mind painting unflattering pictures of these people.  That's a great thing.  But just embracing a non-traditional road does not always make for a journey worth taking.  I can only give the film my most marginal of recommendations.",1281657600,5,4406,4.623225806451613
4081727,4,B0037QGRV0,"John, a middle-aged down-on-his-luck divorcee, meets a beautiful woman he thinks is way out of his league. Improbably, she digs him. The only trouble is her grown up son, who lives at home and just can't quite let go of mommy, and she doesn't seem to see a problem with their level of intimacy and attachment. It's not quite creepy, but it's not normal and not healthy, and it's not going to work out for John unless something gives.

The Duplass brothers follow up their ultra-low-budget quirky independent films The Puffy Chair and Baghead with an off-beat romantic comedy. While more conventional than their earlier efforts, and with a bigger budget and stars, the film still feels as fresh and intimate and real as anything they've done, and is funny without ever quite becoming the farce it initially seems it could become. It is over-the-top - it falls squarely within the romantic comedy genre, after all - but it feels much more authentic than, say, something like The Hangover or Superbad or Knocked Up. In spite of a bigger budget, they are still working on a similar scale, and in a similar style as their previous two films, and remain focused on a situation defined by character rather than plot. The performances, especially those delivered by the three main leads (John C. Reilly as John, Marisa Tomei as Molly, and Jonah Hill as her overly dependent son, Cyrus), are honest and raw and utterly convincing. Jonah Hill is perfect in the title role that seems written for him, a role that tweaks his signature combination of vulnerability and rudeness, and makes it feel fresh and genuine. The style and look, with intimate handheld camera work, fits the story that is being told. In spite of its simplicity, and its spontaneous feel, the writing is actually quite clever - for example, in the way that the relationship between John and his best friend and ex parallels that between his new lover and her son, and the fact that his superficial similarity to her son Cyrus goes some way towards explaining why Molly is immediately drawn to John. It feels too small to be a masterpiece or classic, but it's written well, it feels fresh and often funny. I liked it quite a bit, and will definitely look forward to what the Duplass brothers do next.",1280707200,,2258,4.730964467005077
4081728,3,B0037QGRV0,"""Cyrus"" is funny, but it also serious drama with a creepy topic.  The grown-up son wants his mother to himself, sort of an oedipal complex with his mother's new needy lover.  Overall, it has some laughs (most have been seen in the movie trailers) but it is more of a poignant tale of two mid-life lonely people who were meant for each other.  Then the son tries to break up the relationship.

A sad lonely man (John C. Reilly) divorced for seven years, is still dependent on his ex-wife (Catherine Keener) for support and friendship.  She encourages him to go to a party where he meets the woman of his dreams, Marisa Tomei.  Then he meets her only son, Cyrus, (Jonah Hill) and realizes she has a deeply dependent relationship.  Cyrus, who is 22 years old, knows how to manipulate his mother for his benefit.  He wants to be the center of her universe and not let anyone interfere with his relationship.

The story becomes a strange love triangle, but well acted and easy to understand.",1279670400,2,986,4.556818181818182
4081729,5,B0037QGRV0,"""Cyrus"" has some richly comic, hilarious moments and some touching (cloying?) ones as well. It has first-rate acting by the three principals. John (John C. Reilly looking as much like the ogre Shrek as ever) is a very lonely, vulnerable guy who thinks he's finally met the right woman for him after seven years in the single desert following his divorce. The woman, Molly, (Marisa Tomei) has an overweight twenty-one-year-old non-working son, Cyrus (Jonah Hill) whose very deep and complicated affection for his mom seems to be so strong it shuts out any hope for John to get in-between them.
Cyrus calls his mother Molly and seems to be more of a rival than a son. Mother and son have a very tight relationship but not, I think, quite what you might have heard. Cyrus is a wily schemer who will do anything to drive a wedge between Molly and John. Does the bit with John's Nikes verge on the psychotic?
At times the camera work is not that of the perfectly photographed motion picture. They use hand-held cameras, and the picture is sometimes out of focus and out of frame. It's directed and written by the brother Duplass known for their quirky movies made on the cheap.
The movie is about relationships, how people cope with life. It is a universal situation even though this one has some weird elements. Two forms of love are vying for preeminence.
Cyrus is not dumb, but rather is shrewd and manipulative. The movie says you have to go for it, give life and circumstances a try.
Years ago there were small movies like ""Marty"" about losers who try to find love. This movie is similar in some ways but not quite as daring as the hype may have suggested, but it is very good. Some viewers may feel that there's a cop-out at the end. There is a scene in the movie, a bedroom scene where Molly is getting a call from John that you'll want to catch, but it goes by very fast.
I loved the movie and went with the story willingly because it was engrossing, superbly acted, had a lot of laughs, and a tear or two.",1278892800,3,2009,4.461956521739131
