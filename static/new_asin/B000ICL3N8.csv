8145027,4,B000ICL3N8,"Scratch ( Ratten 2 - Sie kommen wieder!): 7 out of 10: Otherwise known by its slightly less catchy German moniker Ratten 2 - Sie kommen wieder! Scratch is a made for TV sequel about rats attacking a small village. As these things go this is well above average.

The movie starts off with Jaws style naked blonde in jeopardy rat attack (This being German television the violence and blood is low key but nudity is okay.) It quickly moves to a quaint German village complete with castles and fog. The mayor is having a wedding and his old army buddies are coming for the ceremony. Meanwhile a scientist in town is experimenting on rats. And no this doesn't go well.

The cast is likable (Complete with a tall Tom Hanks, a Scott Glenn look alike and Velma from Scooby Doo) and the rats are very well done. I'm not sure how much CGI was actually used but unlike American made for television movies (or for that matter some Hollywood films) there are no ""god that is so fake"" rat scenes. I also liked the solution to the rat problem that was both internally logical and delightfully over the top.

If the movie has one glaring fault it is in the dubbing. Done apparently on the cheap by the same people that dub Japanese cartoons (If you watch a lot of Asian films you will recognize some of the voices) the dubbing is jarring for the first twenty minutes or so. Midwestern accents out of Fargo complete with horrible slang and dialogue.

I'm not sure if the dubbing actually got better as the movie went along or if I just got used to it but it doesn't distract from too much from the fun. Scratch is a real treat for those that enjoy their creature features.",1266624000,,1655,4.398692810457517

8145029,2,B000ICL3N8,"SCRATCH is sort of a sequel to an earlier movie called KILLER RATS.  Both are German made films and horribly dubbed.  Aside from that, the scenarios are basically similar, too.  In this one, mutant rats escape from a laboratory and wreak havoc in a little German village.  Frank, our hero from the first film and his motley crew do battle.  There are lots of scenes of scurrying rats but the plot is almost incoherent, the acting wooden, and the suspense minimal.  For die hard rat lovers only.",1168646400,2,494,4.620689655172414
