7915186,5,B000021Y70,"""Pecos Bill"" is probably one of Rabbit Ears' finest classics ever created as it has adventure and great humor galore. In this tale, we learn about the origins of America's greatest cowboy, Pecos Bill. Follow Pecos Bill through his adventures in creating the first cattle drive to wrestling with a fierce tornado.

Robin Williams does a fantastic job with narrating this tale as he is very energetic and uses a great cowboy accent to create a western mood for this story. Ry Cooder's western influenced music is a treat to listen to as it has a upbeat country sound to it and Tim Raglin's illustrations are colorful and creative, especially of the image of Pecos Bill himself as he wears white, furry pants and a red shirt and red and suave hair to boot. This book is an instant classic for anyone who loves western children's books.
