5168838,3,B008KZVNFS,"This is an adaptation of a series of British novels telling a story of life in the period of world war one. It has an excellent cast. Its very good visually in terms of photography and sets. But the script has problems.

They set themselves an impossible task in trying to adapt a complex series of books into a very few hours of television. There is just too much in terms of story and characters to cover in so little time. At best, it can be said to give an impressionistic view into the book or maybe just into the era. There are some interesting scenes, but the whole itself just didn't work. The early episodes are also rather odd because every negative or regretful comment about the war falls flat because we are rarely seeing anything to do with the war on the screen. The war is really absent through most of the series.

The script spends far too long getting to the high point which is in my opinion the story in the book ""No More Parades"". It then neglects to spend enough time or enough care on that part of the story. They do a massive, scattershot build-up over several episode full of detail that could easily be got rid of and then neglect that on which time and care should have been spent.

The other thing that didn't work for me is that the first few episodes were pure soap opera. Sometimes I wondered if Benedict Cumberbatch was just a supporting character in his own story. The story was somewhat turned inside out with the women characters being made the center of the drama rather than ""Tietjens"" up until really the last episode. It does turn around completely in that last episode. Cumberbatch puts in a very fine performance and established for me an attachment to the story/characters that I didn't have until then. The reunion scene at the house after the war was particuarly moving as were many of the war scenes with the commanding officer at the front and certain other things I will not spoil.

Steven Robertson as Colonel Bill Williams was exceptional in a small but very important part.

It was a long time getting there, but the last two episodes were more than worth it.",1357948800,25,2110,4.484375
5168839,5,B008KZVNFS,"In what should on surface seem a completely silly and irrelevant story one finds an echoing reminder from our own youth of the importance - the existence - of such things as ardent enduring love, honor and duty.  and that these things can thrive in the harshest environment. Cumberbatch perhaps a bit too twitchy. But loved him and all of the cast. Worth buying and keeping.",1356739200,2,374,4.666666666666667
5168840,5,B008KZVNFS,"When it aired in the UK in September and October of 2012, the BBC's 5-episode ""Parade's End"" mini-series, based on the novels of Ford Maddox Ford,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Parade-s-End-Vintage-Classics/dp/0307744205/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Parade's End (Vintage Classics)</a>, won RAVE reviews in the UK , especially for the principal actors, Benedict Cumberbatch (you know him as ""Sherlock"" in the BBC/PBS series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sherlock-Season-One/dp/B004132HZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sherlock: Season One</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sherlock-Season-Two/dp/B004QOB8SO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sherlock: Season Two</a>) and Rebecca Hall (you'll recognize her, too, from such movies as ""Starter for Ten,"" directed by Tom Hanks,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Starter-for-10/dp/B00005JPOH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Starter for 10</a>).

Tom Stoppard, generally considered the UK's finest playwright, adapted the novels for this mini-series and wrote a fine and moving script.

Anything that Benedict Cumberbatch is in is worth watching. He and Johnny Lee Miller (the latter plays Sherlock in the current U.S. show, ""Elementary"") won a shared Olivier Award for their roles in ""Frankenstein"" on the London stage. The two actors alternated nightly, one being the monster and the other being Dr. Frankenstein. Cumberbatch been nominated for Emmys and BAFTAs (UK's version of the U.S.'s Academy Awards) and has won numerous other awards. He plays the unnamed ""bad guy"" in the soon-to-be-released Star Trek II prequel with Chris Pines and plays Smaug in ""The Hobbit,"" which will be released in December of 2012. He is a classically-trained thespian who may just be may be the finest actor of his generation.

""Parade's End"" will be shown on PBS in the US in the spring of 2013.

Christopher  (main character) is under scrutiny, and lies surrounding him by his wife's actions and an interest in Miss Valentine.

5168856,1,B008KZVNFS,"Tedious beyond tolerance. I watched the first one and a half episodes and just had to shut it off. It's not as if I don't like British dramas, even slow-paced melodramas focused on the elite of early 20th century or 19th century British society. But this one crawled and truly had stretches which were apparently intentionally incomprehensible. Like what's the deal with the minister who starts talking about self-abuse right in the middle of mixed company in the dinner party? Was he nuts? What's the point? The cuckolded ""hero"" has zero personality and one has no sympathy for him since he seems to create, or at least aid and abet, his own problems. His fornicating cheating wife, she's cute enough but she's one-dimensional as a classically jaded useless member of the British upper crust. Rather than evoking a sense of sympathy for the destruction the coming World War will inflict on this class of British society you, or I at least, find myself thinking it to be a fortunate event if it leads to end of this kind of uselessness.

I suspect the books are better, as is often the case, but I think I can find about 1000 novels to read before I test this thesis. I'm certainly glad I paid only the ""used"" price for this.",1457654400,,1225,4.6192660550458715

5168858,5,B008KZVNFS,"Interesting 5 part miniseries from HBO. I bought this being a Downton fan, reading that it was similar, a bit rougher.  Same time period, also in England, just centers more around WW1. It covers a 7 year time period, before WW1, during and a bit after the war.  Benjamin Cumberbatch and Rebecca Hall acted their parts well, and both actors can be seen in many other films.  The story is intricate though so you really need to pay attention.  More complicated than Downton, but still excellent.",1456963200,2,493,4.6976744186046515
5168859,3,B008KZVNFS,"I bought this on the strength of the reviews and for Cumberbatch's reputation. I also like British films and period film, so I figured there would be lots here to love. It's just ""meh."" The reason is that it's S-L-O-W. I know British films can be subtle and slow. That's okay. I can do subtle and slow, but this really failed to capture my attention. I watched the first episode then didn't get back to it for months. There was just no pull to keep watching. The first three or four episodes just felt like blah, blah, blipper, blapper, soap opera nonsense. There was no reason to care about these vapid people. Most of them seemed to have no sense of humanity- just fluff inside. By the time you FINALLY crack the exterior, you're almost to the end! The story does finally pull you in, but my, what a slow and boring ride most of it is.

I hope it improves upon subsequent viewings, but I can't imagine I'd be in much of a rush to give it another go.",1456876800,,951,4.283333333333333

5168887,4,B008KZVNFS,"Parades End takes four of Ford Madox Fords novels and turns them into a miniseries written by Tom Stoppard.  Some have characterized this as the thinking persons Downton Abbey.  That is really not fair.  Downtons canvas is wider and its ensemble cast is much larger.  Its time period is also more expansive.

Parades End is much more like a (wartime) Henry James novel.  It examines the experience of a love triangle: Christopher Tietjens (Benedict Cumberbatch), his wife Sylvia (Rebecca Hall) and a young suffragette, Valentine Wannop (Adelaide Clemens).  While Sylvia is unfaithful to Christopher he cannot bring himself to embrace Valentine because he is a married man and an Edwardian man of honor.

Thus, the story concerns a dying breed and historical/cultural change.  The tension brought on by Sylvias behavior and Christophers reactions is palpable.  He is simply too good to spurn, embarrass or divorce her and she is too passionate and vital to accept this honorable treatment.  She would prefer that he exhibit the same sort of passion which she possesses and scream and throw things.  Thus, the conflict and drama are accelerated not just by actions and choices but by codes and mores.

This is a quiet kind of drama but a very powerful kind of drama, with thin-lipped smiles and heads that are about to explode.  The key, intervening outside event is WWI and it is deleterious to the story, not because it is inconsequential to the story but because it is dwelt on for 2 of the 5 episodes.  Trench warfare is nearly unwatchable.  Sloshing through water and mud with incoming shells bursting overhead and machine gun fire prohibiting views of the horizon and a wider world turns 40% of the story into a slog.

It is still a wonderful story with (Spoiler) a satisfying ending, but the storys third act undercuts the first two.  The dvds include an interview with Tom Stoppard.  This is interesting, but note that it is recorded but not filmed.  While TS and his interviewer speak we continue to look at a still photograph.

I recommend it for both the performances and the basic plot arc.  It also includes work by a number of Britains great character actors.",1423180800,,2171,4.858310626702997

There are very few nice things to say about Rebecca Hall's character and because the English have/had a dreadful habit of keeping that stiff upper lip, and Cumberbatch's character allowed her to do so many dreadful things, it was difficult to feel anything but anger towards her and impatience with Mr. Cumberbatch's character for allowing those actions.

5168925,5,B008KZVNFS,"I almost did not purchase this film because I never watch any movie about war.  I expected to be a WWI saga and as it turned out it was a commentary about the era and the shift of values.  I only bought it to see Benedict Cumberbatch because it seems no matter what role he takes he makes the story come alive.  And, as usual he can both break your heart because of his refusal to be anything less than an honorable gentleman and wonder just how much of his superiority (not ""acting"" superior, just being it) one could take if one had to live with him!

5168929,5,B008KZVNFS,"For those impatient with the facile chumminess of Downton Abbey's aristocrats, and its Dallas-on-the-moors veneers, this made-for-TV series is a must-see.

This is a far truer, more realistic portrayal of Edwardian England based on a novel by FM Ford, a fine writer--though a less-than-considerate ""bounder"" by his own and others' accounts (see my review of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quartet-The-Merchant-Ivory-Collection/dp/B00014NE6C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quartet - The Merchant Ivory Collection</a>, with Alan Bates, Maggie Smith and Isabelle Adjani). It is far more clear-eyed about the times, that scene and those people, and so much less ""about the gowns.""

So expect a tale full of insufferable snobberry, nasty prejudices and very crippling repressions. I gather in the book the male lead is quite detestable, unlike as Benedict Cumberbatch delivers him, 'though the virtue of this production is that, among others, I'll be reading it! The female lead may be a bit too liberated for a full century ago, but that's no great sin; it's almost plausible, since she's paired with a hyper-principled but little-boyish man.

Cumberbatch does well, stiff and lugubrious but far more human than in the ""Sherlock"" series (and equipped with a superb voice, up there with Burton and Jeremy Irons). Perhaps in her best role yet, Rebecca Hall, as ever, is swan-like beautiful yet sometimes also verges on duck-ugly, making her totally enchanting to watch. Both prove themselves top-drawer leads in plum roles, and well-launched toward big cinematic things. And there's no lack of good support from the rest of the solid cast.

The art direction--including some grim Edwardian dresses, rooms and castles that alternate with their opposite counterparts in gorgeousness--is second to none.

Incredible how far one man will go for honor, love, faithfulness and truth even when it leads to his downfall more than once.  It also shows how gossip, lies and spite can cause the ruin of the innocent and honorable. Though this is a heavy drama, I found it very watchable and interesting.

5168945,4,B008KZVNFS,"After seeing this miniseries, I started reading the novels by Ford Madox Ford on which it is based.  You can see what a challenge it was to transform these novels, which go back and forth in time and keep changing narrative perspective, into a linear script.  I think they did a great job with that transformation, and I loved the performances by the three lead actors (Cumberbatch, Hall, Clemons).  But even though it has been made more or less linear, the story line is sometimes hard to follow.  And the motivations of the characters, which in the books mostly are seen in interior monologues, are quite often hard to decipher on screen (partly because the status implications in Edwardian England of something like a refused check are not immediately obvious to us).  The film is not super easy to watch but I do think the rewards are commensurate with the effort.",1389830400,,868,4.7218543046357615
5168946,5,B008KZVNFS,"This is great television drama set in the 1910s and based on a book.

The show is a low triangle but much more high-brow than for instance<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masterpiece-Downton-Abbey-Seasons-1-2-3-Deluxe-Limited-Edition-Amazon-Exclusive-Season-4-Bonus-Features/dp/B00D3PYQT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masterpiece: Downton Abbey Seasons 1, 2 & 3 Deluxe Limited Edition (Amazon Exclusive Season 4 Bonus Features)</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Upstairs-Downstairs/dp/B004N66XYE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Upstairs Downstairs</a>.

The writing is superb and you can easily watch the show twice. There are loads of characters and you will get confused in the beginning when you try to make sense of what you are seeing. It will keep you interested, but not served on a plate. The details can be taken in on a second watching (and this is said by a reviewer that normally is bored watching the same thing twice).

The visual impact of the first couple of episodes is breathtaking; both in terms of cinematography and locations. Acting is of good BBC standard.

I was looking forward to seeing those theme dramatized, but was quite disappointed to see the complex themes of the books reduced to a romantic triangle among the main character, his wife, & love interest played out in period settings & costumes. The motivations behind the actions of Christopher Tietjens & Valentine Wannop, even the causes of their romantic attachment for each other, were also obscure due to the lack of attention given to the social & political views of those characters, Christopher's in particular were often as incomprehensible to the audience as to his commanding general. In the end, what could have been an epic drama portraying the lead-up to events that are still having political consequences a century later was reduced to a banal though pretentious historical romance.",1389312000,3,1076,5.050561797752809

A great story of the Edwardian period and the horrors and destinies of those whose fate in WWI was almost certain death. The choice of returning to England in disgrace or going to a front line unit and almost certain death was made without hesitation (or regret). The film was a very revealing look into the moral culture of the times and the absurdity of the significance of relationships which would cause Christopher's father to commit suicide (based only on gossip, rumor, and the evidence of a complete strange, Ruggles). It was surreal at times, but very thought provoking. An excellent story, well done. The quality of the DVD was poor, but the overall excellence of the story totally caused this to be a non issue.

Plot lines move far more slowly than the typical American TV show but, in the hands of great actors, and Benedict Cumberbatch and Rebecca Hall are truly great actors, British drama can be very fun to  watch.  And Parade's End succeeds on all levels.  Based on the Ford Madox Ford novels, this is world class television.  Cumberbatch's character is compelling, a moral paragon in a world rapidly changing.  If you can find the time to watch this show,  you simply won't find a better presentation than  this.  While I enjoy Downton Abbey as much as anyone, it simply can't hold a candle to this series.

The five episodes could have been reduced to 3 1/2 and it would have been much tighter period drama.  Much of the middle seemed to be make-work.  Also, it would have been better if the costumer had at least got things like uniforms right.

5168975,4,B008KZVNFS,"Parade's End is a 5 part mini-series that is at times complicated, frustrating and utterly beautiful. Taking place just before WW1 and during, it is more than just a war film, it is also a maddening tale of a brilliant man always trying to do what is right. Benedict Cumberbatch plays Christopher Tietjens, an extremely bright, intellegant gentleman (in every sense of the term), who gets thrown into a marriage of duty.  Though the backstory is sparce, what we know is he meets a beautiful woman, Sylvia (Rebecca Hall) on the train and well, it all very quickly leads to a baby. Unfortunately, it is never known if the baby is utterly Christopher's, as Sylvia is not exactly a proper lady in certain regards. But, duty-bound, he marries her quickly. From this point on, we are witness to a marriage only by name. Sylvia is a selfish, arrogant snob who has absolutely no problem with sleeping around for her own amusement. She barely acknowledges her son, looks down upon her husband, and pretty much makes a mockery of their union. She is a typical, rich, spoiled brat. Christopher has the patience of a saint. He puts up with all of this, with all of her, knowing exactly what it is she is doing, and has done. Even when Sylvia runs away to Germany with her lover, he refuses to divorce her or in any way shed light on the scandal.

That is not to say he is without faults. He makes absolutely no demands of his wife. Clearly, there is zero intimacy and his attitude towards her is polite and straight to the point. She finds him cold, and many a time tries to elicit some sort of response or feeling from him, but all in vain. I'm not quite sure what to make of it since again, we get so little backstory. I have not read the novels so maybe someone can shed some light on this matter. It is almost frustrating at times to watch these two characters on screen because you want something to happen, but it never comes to fruition. He takes her back without thought when she gets tired of her lover, and she returns to a life nearly identical to the one she left behind. And then The War strikes and everything that Christopher has tried to keep maintained, his beliefs and principals and even his personal life, slowly start to unravel.

Benedict Cumberbatch is the perfect actor for this role. I'm not sure how he compares to the character in the novel, but I couldn't care less on that account. He is surrounded by this almost constant melancholy and every move is made with precision. He is so subtle in his performance, so controlled that at the rare times that he lets go, it's just breathtaking to witness. His voice, a deep, grave rumble, takes a few minutes to get used to as it is quite different from his usual low-toned, sonorous baritone, but his eyes are so expressive and haunting. As I write this, the news that he has been nominated for an Emmy for this performance comes as no surprise. Parade's End is beautiful, but Cumberbatch is the real reason to watch it.

Rebecca Hall also does a wonderful job as the spoiled socialite who knows exactly how to work men. She can make them do whatever she wants. Everyone falls under her spell. Everyone, of course, except her husband. It drives her completely mad that she can't get a rise out of him and she tries so very hard. She is a hard character to like or empathize with, but there are a few scenes where you can't really help but feel sorry for her. One scene you would swear she loathes Christopher, and another she is defending him to her lover as the last decent man in all of England. She admires his brilliance but mocks him for it. I don't think she quite knows how to behave around him. He can do no wrong and that infuriates her. But when she bares her soul for him (in a touching scene, albeit a short one) you really have to believe her and we get a glimpse at the passion that brought them together in the first place. They are an odd pair, mis-matched in so many ways, but you just can't help but want more of them.

The cinematography is beautiful and vivid, from the posh London to the war-torn trenches and everything in between. Once again HBO has made a stunning mini-series and the production value is evident here.

The one let-down has to be the character of Valentine Wannop, played by Adelaide Clemens. She is a sweet sort of girl, that Christopher accidently meets as a suffragette, and it's all secretive smiles and steamy stares from there. Her character felt lacking for me, and though I got a feeling of genuine affection from her towards Christopher, it still felt unrealistic, even towards the end. I can see the appeal, that she is so far removed from Sylvia that Christopher can't help but feel something for her. Where Sylvia is over-the-top, Valentine is modest and bland. But not so modest that she won't be his mistress, a task easier said than done. The final confrontation between Christopher, Sylvia and Valentine felt rushed, artificial, and well, unresolved. I was hoping for something rather grand, but it felt a bit flat.

I would love to rewatch it some day, as I'm sure I missed some things, especially regarding the war, and the political aspects around it. This is one of these series that would definitely benefit from numerous viewings so you don't miss any of the nuances that make it so enjoyable to watch. Also, I believe this is the correct Blu-ray for the US and Canada, region 1. I noticed there were numerous versions of Parade's End on amazon, and it looks like people may have bough the wrong one. According to the specs, this looks to be the correct one.",1374105600,9,5581,4.508893280632411
5168976,5,B008KZVNFS,"I loved this series - and it gets even better with repeat viewings.  If anyone were to delete this from my DVR between now and the time the Region 1 Discs ship I WOULD kill them.

Rebecca Hall is a force, and the rest of the cast is fantastic.  Yes it's a bit uneven at times but just go with it - it's worth the ride.  This is not a comfy ""sit back and be spoon fed"" piece by any means.  The characters are so layered and complex that you really feel you know them.

After watching Parade's End I saw Benedict in Star Trek - and he was no where NEAR as impressive/appealing without Ford/Stoppards beautiful words and clear motivations. True - he's an actor who can make just about anything he says sound good - but why should he have to?  Parade's End is in a word - DELICIOUS!!

The physical changes in Cumberbatch's character over the 10 years of this are at times a bit jarring, but it is 10 years, and he is playing a fat, clumsy, ugly, blond Yorkshireman - if you can imagine.  (He does get ""prettier"" as it goes on - if that's important to you).

After I watched this - I picked up the audio of all 4 of Ford's books (42 hours).  The detail, stream of consciousness content, backstory, and follow up are whip cream with a cherry. I highly recommend it!  Tom Stoppard did a masterful job of capturing the books in his script - as I could NEVER have figured out what was going on in the books had I not seen this first. Talk about jumping around...

Personally, Parade's End is my clear #2 (for Cumberbatch) - right behind 2004 BBC's Hawking - with the dazzling Sherlock at #3.  It really is that good.

Also note - that the 6 negative reviews right now are all technical/operator problems that have nothing to do with the content.  This should have more stars.",1372723200,35,1766,4.258258258258258

5168978,4,B008KZVNFS,"I have not read the original set of four novels by Ford Madox Ford upon which this series was based - I understand that much of one of those novels was excised from the screenplay here.  Ordinarily, I am disappointed by novel-screen transfers, so perhaps not having read the original material has enhanced my admiration of this series, which is literate, beautifully produced, and superbly acted.

The painful story of Christopher Tietjens, a product of Britain's late 19th century-early 20th century class system, focuses on Tietjens's moral and emotional struggles as World War I engulfs Europe.  Tietjens is a deeply conservative man employed as a mathematician by the government, producing statistical analyses for it.  We learn early that he has been entrapped into marriage with a beautiful but calculating socialite named Sylvia, due to an out of wedlock pregnancy that we (and he) are never certain is his doing.  Tietjens's struggles to achieve balance between his natural reserve and values (the 18th century against the 19th, the country against the city, as he defiantly puts it), amid events that overtake his personal life and his life as a citizen of a country at war, are demonstrated with great delicacy by Benedict Cumberbatch.  Cumberbatch offers a beautifully paced, nuanced portrait of an emotionally constricted man pushed nearly beyond endurance by the imperatives imposed on him by a world war and an unhappy marriage. Ford Madox Ford intended this to be an anti-war novel, but even not having read the tetralogy, it seemed as if the writers chose to emphasize the love triangle that develops among Tietjens, the wife who marries him for social convenience, and the young suffragette with whom he falls in love, and to refract the horrors of the war through these relationships, rather than the other way around. Complicating matters for Tietjens is his love for the son Sylvia bears after their marriage, and whose real paternity he quickly ceases to care about, bonding with the child and doing his best to be a responsible and loving father.

There are a great many strands to this story, which covers a period beginning before and ending shortly after World War I.  Cumberbatch's performance is subtle and moving.  He conveys Tietjens' deeply rooted ideas about honor, almost a confused sense of having been born in the wrong place at the wrong time, and his titanic efforts to free himself sufficiently to respond to love and warmth. Given the nearly Asperger-like reserve that shackles so much of Tietjens's persona, those struggles are wrenching to witness. Rebecca Hall turns in a marvelous performance as the spiteful, emotionally warped Sylvia.  The DVD is worth purchasing just for these two performances, although the rest of the cast is hardly far behind.

I plan to read Ford's tetralogy as soon as I can, but, as it is, this series and its portrayals continue to linger in memory.  Note: this is a Region 2 DVD, so you will need to have, as I do, a region-free DVD player to watch it.",1370822400,4,3023,4.964356435643564

5168980,5,B008KZVNFS,"I've just completed watching Parade's End for the second time and much to my surprise, it was just as enjoyable as the first time. Second time around watching usually loses something... but not in this case.

The stoic and admirable character of Christopher Tietjens is beautifully played by Benedict Cumberbatch and without question, one of his best roles. He shows such pain in the situations faced - whether it be the result of being honorable or often being caused by his manipulative wife, Sylvia, played by the stunning Rebecca Hall. You cannot help but loathe her character due to all of the crap she pulls on everyone. But in the same breath, you also feel some pity for her - the obvious desperation to be needed and loved by the one man she cannot - maybe even shouldn't - have. Then in walks Valentine Wannop - a kindred spirit to Tietjens and against what is ""right"", you're rooting for them to be together.

The characters were fantastic and the story is captivating - along with Mr. Cumberbatch's sultry baritone voice. Parade's End offered a view into a time where honor, duty, shame and freedom were completely different than that of today. And after you're done watching - there's this wistfulness of a simpler and more nobler day lingering.

If you enjoy historical fiction (Pride & Prejudice, The Other Boleyn Girl, Persuasion, etc.) - you will most definitely enjoy Parade's End.",1370563200,53,1399,4.820833333333334

I had seen many screen clips of his performances and they were very amusing. He was to appear in several scenes according to the advertisements.  To my dismay the film I received only had a three second appearance in one scene. Not at all what was in the ads. This is just a bare bones synopsis of the movie, Parades End takes place at the end of World War 1, creating, in this story, a London populated by aristocrats and high society. The plot is very intricate and involved, it moves slowly and can be confusing at times. We are introduced to a shrewish wife who has been unfaithful and her husband who finds himself amazingly attracted to a vivacious young woman. Sub-plots involving supporting players adds depth to the movie. I recommend PARADES END to those who prefer long , intricate and slightly opaque films full of a variety of interesting charactes.

There are moments where you find yourself pulling for someone and then you get slapped in the face with just how dull and uninteresting their problems really are. The whole movie you are being pushed by the other characters to feel as though Cumberbatchs wife is this vile woman and that he deserves better but in fact, I felt as though SHE was the one who could have done better as he was as fun as watching grass grow. Anyhow, my main thought is this... if it comes on TV, by all means watch it. DON'T buy this though... it's simply not worth the price.",1365552000,9,855,4.452229299363057
5168989,5,B008KZVNFS,"Ford Madox Ford was one of the UK's most accomplished early 20th-century authors (""The Good Soldier"" and ""Parade's End"" among dozens of other novels), sadly overlooked among other literary giants of the time.  His tetralogy, Parade's End, has been brilliantly written for the screen by Tom Stoppard, and the story is much more multi-dimensional than ""Downton Abbey,"" though set in the same era.  The plot threads are richer, the characters are true-to-life, and the picture of British life prior to and during World War I is unforgettable.  The cast, headed by Benedict Cumberbatch, who plays Christopher Tietjens, the protagonist, is hands-down superb; Rupert Everett plays Tietjen's older brother; and the offsetting female roles, played by Rebecca Hall and Adelaide Clemens, stick like glue in your memory.

Maybe there won't be, considering less than a quarter of a million viewers watched its premiere showing on HBO. As you've no doubt heard by now, ""Parade's End"" is no ""Downton Abbey.""

What it is is the sort of first-class TV adaptation of classic British literature that the British Broadcasting Corporation used to do all the time, and that used to get shown on American public TV when it wasn't too sexy to be edited down for us. ""Parade's End"" is not an easy story to follow if you're used to ""Downton Abbey"" style costume shows that basically put modern people and situations into corsets and top hats. Tietjens isn't the wicked hypocritical aristocrat we've been taught to expect from a million bodice-rippers and thrillers; he is a gentleman who actually tries to follow the rules that a gentleman is supposed to live by. That this sets him at odds with the society he lives in doesn't make him a freak or an oddball; he's a man for all seasons whose quietly heroic journey is both frustrating and fascinating to follow.

The reason for this series' existence, and in my opinion really the only reason to watch it (and what more reason do you need) is to watch Benedict Cumberbatch demonstrate why he's swiftly becoming the most admired British actor of his generation: brilliant, accessible, and ultimately loveable.",1364428800,6,1679,4.707482993197279

5168999,4,B008KZVNFS,"This is NOT Downtown Abbey soap opera! Cumberbach and the cast are excellent. Stoppard has a very difficult task scripting a swamp of a book and mining it for its essential thrust. Which is an account of how the English governing class and World War 1 did for the British Empire. The story line follows the (usually) hysterical self absorption of ALL its characters. Teijens, the main character, an 18th Century Parsival is serially undone by his class - contemporaries. Ably abetted by his Madam Bovery of a wife.

The problem wit the book is Ford Maddox Ford's writing approach. He attempts a series of impressionistic sketches around each character, trying, I suppose, to make a three dimensional image. Which fails and leaves us with a series of unsatisfying caricatures.

Stoppard is a premier craftsman with an acute eye for scene setting and an ear for the defining dialog. I felt the second and third acts got as well into the story as is possible, setting up an excellent fourth act. Stoppard simply cuts the last book, which is, in any case, mostly another attempt to reprise the points Ford fails to ground in the first three books. Act 1 is problematic, if you read what Stoppard has to work with from the book. The characters are still caricatures, so that the events surrounding them seem like place holders for what might come out if Ford can, eventually find focus. (For me he never does.)

I recommend this very fine production. Even for those who are not wild about BBC trawling English period drama for product, this is rather better than usual.",1363046400,2,1564,4.742647058823529
5169000,4,B008KZVNFS,"Parade's End will likely confuse Downton Abbey fans at first because it is a completely different (as in much more complex) kind of narrative and its characters are much more modern (as in divided and uncertain creatures not all of a piece with themselves or their time periods). It is about a hyper-Torified aristocrat named Christopher Tietjens who wants not to be a hyper-Torified aristocrat and thus sabotages his own historical trajectory (usually a job done by WWI in Edwardian character and class pieces) by impulsively marrying himself off to his opposite, the hyper-modern anti-Toff Sylvia Satterthwaite (who will immediately annoy some and thrill other viewers, Lady Mary she's not). He questions his decision even before he goes through with it but go through with it he does. Outwardly, he stays with her out of honor (or at least that is what he would like others to believe and perhaps what he himself would like to believe), but the undeniable and ineluctable attraction reveals that Tietjens is never completely certain of his own motives. The characters don't know what quite to make of themselves and we don't know what quite to make of them (except that everyone and everything is coming undone and sex, more than WWI, seems to be the reason why). Every scene of this series is disorienting and each new character introduced opens up another level of confusion and layer of uncertainty. I guess the idea is that we, like the characters, aren't supposed to be able to orient ourselves in this inbetween world (the past is dying but not quite dead, the future is kicking but as yet unborn) that satisifes no one (if so, this thing is a magnificent success). Parade's End is like the avant-garde anti-dote to Downton Abbey (and its carefully managed Victorian narrative that allows everyone ample time to decide who they want to be and which historical epoch--the Victorian or the modern, which seem to co-exist in relative harmony--- best suits the character they've so carefully developed and the life they've so carefully chosen). In Parade's End there is no time for such calculations. The upheaval's are more cognitive than social and the characters are incapable of self-adjustment or compromise or definitive action (every action in this series seems to be followed by a reversal), so the drama is primarily internal and unresolved. Even the author seems uncertain what to do with his characters (and seems more comfortable moving back and forth in time than in proceeding forward). Its very un-British really (more storm and stress than staid and steady) so its no surprise that this was written by Ford Madox Ford (whose father was German). Oh dear (we can all hear Violet saying). In these period and character studies, the hope (expressed by the characters) is that the war will resolve or at least simplify things and make them clearer (as in make social distinctions less clear and life easier for all concerned). In Downton this is not the case, as Matthew becomes more of a Toff (and preserver of social distinctions) after the war than he ever was before the war; however, this is true in Parade's End, where the war does indicate to Tietjens that in this new world, honor, while still important and valued by some, is no longer a value that holds the world together (and can even be destructive when wrongly applied). But what really distinguishes these two series from one another is not in the way they each treat war but in the way they each treat desire and its effect on consciousness and perspective. At Downton, desire (Matthew's desire for Mary) is what preserves rank and privilege and point of view; whereas in Parade's End, desire (Tietjens desire for Sylvia) is what makes Tietjens realize that his own perspective is a limited one. And this difference is, in the end, what separates the Tory construction that is Downton Abbey (and its vision of Brits as exemplary epoch and epoch-transtion managers) from the modernist construction that is Parade's End (wherein entire world views and psychologies are made obsolete in the course of one passionate afternoon long before the war, even though it may take a war and the destruction of a world and of a make-believe class---and of a tree--- to convince Tietjens that this is so and for him to begin to view the world and his place in it through a new multi-perspectived--modernist-- lens because of it).",1362441600,3,4396,4.902013422818792

8528771,5,B008KZVNFS,"I absolutely loved it. I'm a HUGE Benedict fan so I watched it on Prime just to see him and I ended up watching it twice in a row so I could catch more details the second time around. Sometimes it's hard to follow Brit-speak with their fast speaking, quieter vocals and different idioms so I find a second watch quite helpful...I thought the two main ladies were excellent as well - both were mesmerizing with their very different temperaments and drives and Benedict was amazing, as always. Simply the best actor of this generation. Someday I predict an award named in his honor. Anyway, the story touched me profoundly. I related to Tjiegen's character more than I could've imagined. I feel the way about our culture and society today when it seems as though everyone is out for themselves and honor and integrity and kindness are things of the past, seen as emotional and weak. What a beloved character and what a poignant and captivating story.
For those who think it was boring and slow, there are plenty of banal half-hour sitcoms out there to entertain you just like fast food. Leave the gourmet meals to people who really enjoy tasting the delicacies!",1505865600,,1159,4.686274509803922

8528774,5,B008KZVNFS,"What a fantastic story!  This dramatization of Ford Maddox Ford's ""Parade's End"" captures the cataclysmic changes wrought on individuals and society by the First World War, as seen through the lives of Christopher Tietjens, a young nobleman, his wife Sylvia, and the young suffragette Valentine. Their lives will repeatedly intertwine between 1912 and 1918, in a subtle ways that captures the changing tides in society.

Tietjans, a civil servant in Whitehall, will rub elbows with a variety of thinly disguised historical figures, while raising a son who might or might not be his, with a wife who may or may not be faithful to him.  Along the way, he meets a young suffragette who makes a lasting impression on him.  When the war comes, everything he thinks he knows about the world will be challenged, at home and in the trenches...

The series is superbly cast, with Benedict Cumberbach as Tietjens, Rebecca Hall as Sylvia, and Adelaide Clemens as Valentine, supported by a small mob of excellent British talent.  The storyline unfolds slowly over five episodes, but those engrossed in the storyline may find it too short.  The period setting is meticulously recreated, along with the subtle pain and humor of a society going through changes.  Very highly recommended as excellent entertainment for those willing to take the story on its own terms.",1503273600,3,1352,5.031390134529148

However, be aware that the multi-format version includes an expired digital copy so if you're lookin forward to it, forget it.",1500422400,,214,5.114285714285714
