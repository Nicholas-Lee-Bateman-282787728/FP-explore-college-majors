3528744,4,B001DE29PG,"I got this set for my 2 boys to watch when we went on a summer trip.  I was very pleased with the set, but decided to post this review to make it know that it did not contain the disks that were pictured on the back of the box.

The back of the box shows that this set contains How Bob Became a Builder, Top Team, and Bob's Big Plan, but in fact those were not the disks inside.  (This was a GOOD thing for us!)  I'm not sure if all the boxes will be the same -- these may have random disks...

Our set contains:
1) When Bob Became a Builder (""the story of Bob from boy to builder"", 50 min)
2) Teamwork! (Pilchard's Pets, Lofty's Long Load, Snowman Scoop, Dizzy the Sheepdog, plus 4 mini-adventures... 45 min)
3) Scoop's Favorite Adventures (Scoop Saves the Day, Scoop's in Charge, Mr. Ellis's Art Exhibition, Scoop Has Some Fun... 35 min)
4) Scoop toy, about 1.75"" tall, which has ""splashes"" on it like he's been working in white mud :)

My kids love these, but I do wish we as purchasers could know what was in the box when we order them.  Random disks is not a good thing!",1343865600,2,1075,4.114832535885167
3528745,5,B001DE29PG,"Just can't go wrong with this price. 3 DVDs with a toy, and this is one of my son's favorite toys. DVDs are good as usual.",1337472000,,122,3.730769230769231
3528746,5,B001DE29PG,"My grandson loves this wonderful DVD. It has entertained him for hours. Thanks guys for good service, speedy shipping, and smooth transaction. It arrived before Christmas and I would definitely purchase from you again! Keep up the good work!",1326240000,,241,5.205128205128205
3528747,3,B001DE29PG,"My daughter just discovered this series, and it has become her favorite. She loves how everyone works together & she's even picked up the trucks' phrase from the movie: ""Jadyn on the job"" when she feels like being helpful. I'm happy for that. But I'm noticing more and more that the character ""Spud"" in the movie seems to always get in trouble, yet there never seems to be any consequences for his actions. An example is in Snowman Scoop the town is holding a snowman contest and Spud is stealing the noses off all the snowmen. He's doing this to feed the ""poor little animals who are hungry."" Nice motive, but stealing is still wrong. That is never addressed, and another character even goes so far as to apologize to Spud that he misjudged him (he thought he was stealing the noses to ruin the competition). No one ever says that what he did was wrong, or that a better way to get food for the animals would be to come to his friends & ask for help (since the title of this particular DVD is Teamwork). Another time he cheats during an egg race by placing building putty on his spoon to hold his egg. He is disqualified at the end when he's found out (and loses the prize pizza) but still everyone just seems to laugh off his ""antics"" and he gets to share the pizza anyway. There are other minor examples, as his behavior permeates all the videos.",1325289600,8,1349,4.378486055776892
3528748,5,B001DE29PG,"I bought this video to take on vacation with my grandson, who is 2, and his mom and dad. It was a hit! He loved the Bob the Builder toy that came with it, too. By the end of the week, we could all sing the Bob the Builder song by memory!!",1323648000,,238,3.5961538461538463
3528749,3,B001DE29PG,"I bought this set for my 2yr.old grandson, he seemed excited to watch it, but it didn't hold his interest for long.  The price was fine, I think it is geared for a child a bit older.",1322265600,,182,3.918918918918919
