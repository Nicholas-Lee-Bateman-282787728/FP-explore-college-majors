4164529,3,B003PJ1UTS,"As the saying goes, ""Keeping up with the Joneses""; this movie exemplifies the idea with a marketing company that places a fake family together to market products from big corporations.  It almost sounds as a dream job until you realize that greed is never satisfied.  There will always be someone with better toys, better cars, better houses, etc.

Its a pretty cool movie because it shows how much junk and crap really is available to us and so many people are tied into the status quo consumerism in society trying to one up each other by buying or purchasing things they don't need nor can they afford.  Sadly, its a satire on the materialistic society today.

But man, what a wicked job it is!  From the house you live in to the clothes to the fancy cars; its all paid for by the company and you just need to market it or show it off.  I love it!

David Duchovny and Demi Moore are quite a power couple in this movie and in the end, they all learn a lesson.  You don't want to live a fake life that seems fulfilling but ultimately just an empty shell.",1282348800,,1055,4.314720812182741
4164530,4,B003PJ1UTS,"Meet the Joneses.  They are the perfect family living in an upscale neighborhood, and they have everything that you might want.  From the first moment they descend into their new environment, envy rears its head.  Everyone wants what they have.

But underneath the stunning surface, secrets and hidden agendas are just waiting to reveal themselves.  Is this family too good to be true?

When a neighborhood tragedy jolts one of them into the real world, what will happen to the perfect life they've created?

I was riveted to the screen throughout this film.  My expectations were not high for this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Demi Moore was perfect as the ""plastic"" superwoman; David Duchovny was great at revealing glimpses of a real person underneath that perfect exterior; and Lauren Hutton, as super icon, was masterful.  And Gary Cole and Glenne Headley reeled me in as the vulnerable wannabes.

You might be surprised at the ending...but then again, anything is possible in this unreal universe.

4164532,4,B003PJ1UTS,"An interesting examination of consumerism. The ""happy ending"" blunts the messages, takes the focus from what would seem to be the main point, that keeping up with the Joneses will wreak havoc with our personal finances, that ""he who dies with the most/best toys wins"" is a load of bunk. Instead, it becomes about personal redemption, (spoiler alert) and boy gets girl. Would have preferred the ""unhappy"" ending so the critique of consumer culture had a bit more ""stickiness.""",1281916800,,475,5.025316455696203
4164533,5,B003PJ1UTS,"The starts out with the perfect family moving onto a posh community. Their home is perfect and they have all the high tech gadgets to the envy of all their neighbors. However you start to realize not everything is normal behind the scenes as the parents sleep in separate bedrooms. When the daughter sneaks into her dad's bedroom (brief nudity) mom has to drag her out. The ""secret"" we find out about 20 minutes into the movie is that this family is a plant and not really a family. Their job is to make friends with everyone and show off the products so others will buy them. Their success is measured by how much luxury stuff their neighbor's buy to keep up with them. The real story comes as their perfect world unravels during a music montage as their own life gets in the way of their facade. The acting is good with strong performances by all the main characters. Today computer companies do this type of thing by placing a shill in someplace like Starbucks pretending to be a regular guy when they are actually trying to soft sell a laptop.

The movie is amusing, but not laugh out loud funny. It is heart warming, but doesn't make you cry. It moves along at a good pace.

The movie shows a great juxtaposition with the neighbor, who tries to be a great cosmic salesperson by listening to motivation tapes.",1281830400,,1313,4.466666666666667
4164534,5,B003PJ1UTS,"From [...]-
- 'The Joneses' are your neighbors and peers, i.e., people at the same social level as yourself.
-""Keeping Up""- means staying with the rest of the group.
-Finally the source of the Phrase ""Keeping up with the Jones""- is to keep pace and  appeared in the phrase 'keeping up with the Joneses'
which was coined in 1913 by cartoonist Arthur R. Momand
for the title of a series in the New York Globe. It means ""trying to match the lifestyle of one's more affluent neighbors or acquaintances.""
For example,  'Their buying a new van is just another attempt to keep up with the Joneses.'

I open my review with this because the exploitation of the competitive nature of neighbors and the Family unit (made up of salesmen on commission headed by Demi Moore's character)
is Well Represented and Modeled as the new norm for marketing and selling for 2010 in this movie. As I roughly knew the definition of this wise saying
I wanted to see what this movie would do.  The movie addressed the topic of the Emotional self (a blind spot that Society does not address in education or
real understanding) vs. Capitalism (which validates emotions to be used for successful product creating, selling and advertising).

 In this movie, peers and neighbors are a new avenue to sell and better track the impact of sales which I believe the Lauren Hutton's character helps the audience stay on track as well as the David Duchovny character to be the main goal and the right reason for living (and working which in this story is both).

 The Duchovny Character forced me to look at my comfort level of buying  as well as how I recommend products to my friends and family because the product has worked well in my life and
may help my friend or neighbor in theirs.  What I enjoyed about this movie is that the emotions had to be looked at --because when the materials are continuously supplied and secure--the emotional emptiness which is never looked at ( yet motivates the need to buy and the need to win) is loud demanding Demi and DAvid's attention.  This movie showed that the emotional involvement is more colorful than the white and crystal house the Family Unit resides.

The movie shows the line that real issues cannot be merchandise or commission solve.  The movie shows salesman ""charisma and magnetism"" that  Demi's character points as the asset of the Family Unit comes from a heart place
in David Duchovny.  He tries to use his heart in order to help these people he works and lives with so they all could move forward in their lives.  I liked that we find out that the Duchovny character was trying the family life as a test run and with him I found he wanted
it with the caring part and the emotional messiness.

This is not a weak movie and for me and the movie's use of the everyday- ness reminds me that we impact each other.  This movie served as a great reminder what has become normal and of why 'Keeping up with the Joneses' should stay in 1913.",1281398400,,2955,4.553875236294896
4164535,5,B003PJ1UTS,"Can you buy happiness?  Not according to The Joneses.  How you spend has a greater effect on your happiness than how much you spend, researchers say.  ""But Will It Make You Happy?""  [...]

This smart movie explores our attempt to find happiness through competitive and conspicuous consumption, and the perils along the way.  It will make you think twice about your early adopter friends.  Are they really into those gadgets, or do they have another agenda.  It will make you look at advertising in a new light.  What is advertising?  What is not.

David Duchovny is fantastically funny.  This is a fun, stimulating movie.

4164536,3,B003PJ1UTS,"""The Joneses"" doesn't hit as hard as it thinks it does. The satire is all on the surface and because the film plays it much to safe, it ends up not really saying anything that important. While the performances by David Duchovny and Demi Moore are solid and the high production values make the film easy to digest, it's fantastic high concept is lost on a plot that really goes nowhere. Now, a lot of people are giving the film flack for it's ending, but I think that is where the films strength really lays. When the film is showing what consumerism and greed really does to these people (the fake family as well as real ones) is where ""The Joneses"" works best. When writer/director Derrick Borte takes the film into darker territory (a gay bashing sequence, a suicide, a predatory Amber Heard) it gives the film a bit more edge. Overall, it's all really quite harmless and it goes down easy enough to be worth a viewing. It's just a shame the filmmakers didn't take more risks because they had a hell of a concept here.",1273708800,42,1020,4.459893048128342
4164537,4,B003PJ1UTS,"Not since American Beauty has such a film really nailed making a distinctly and delicately nuanced point about human behavior.  In today's fake world --- fake from otherwise unsalable chicken parts pressed into the meat called chicken nuggets to toilet paper manufacturers cutting the size of the toilet roll down more and more while at the same time jacking up the price --- it seems everything is unfortunately subject to much closer scrutiny than in the past.  I was born in 1956 and from 15 on grew up near Rushville, Indiana, so I can still remember when the work ethic was strong and people actually believed and helped one another.  It was a time of you did and meant what you said.  This film brilliantly reflects just how far we have come from that long ago era.

David Duchovny and Demi Moore really shine as Steve and Kate Jones, a couple who move into an upscale community, complete with all the coollest gadgets, toys and cars.  They look like such a NICE couple, like the kind you remember from Normal Rockwell paintings, or from the Andy Griffith show in the early 1960s.  Just nice, honorable, pleasant people, the kind you'd want to have as your next door neighbors.  But things are not as they seem.  Without giving away the plot --- which is really refreshingly unusual --- we soon find that we do indeed need to be skeptical of them.  But everyone in their neighborhood is totally taken in, and soon they are all competing with the Joneses to keep up with or even surpass them, with some distastrous and painful results.

Gary Cole, a highly underrated actor --- he was fabulous years ago as the convicted killer Jeffrey Macdonald --- brings touching tenderness to a role that could merely have served as a plot device. Glenne Headly as his wife is equally great as a woman desperate to make a career of home sales.  The scene where they are in bed together is painful to watch, as both actors do a really excellent job of showing a couple who have long since passed the point of emotionally looking together in the same direction.

But the film is really carried by David Duchovny and Demi Moore.  Their reaction shots to each other and the way they play off each other is quite breathtaking to watch, as opposed to many of today's prettier and younger actors who are barely competent.  Duchovny has come a long way in my opinion since the pilot of The X-Files.  His used car salesman Steve Jones who has fallen into a great money job and yet develops a late-blooming conscience is believable from start to finish.  Demi Moore, a really great actress who in my opinion made some bad career choices the the '90s that held her back for awhile, gives a strong performance as a woman who for the first time is confronting the ethics of what she does for a living and believably goes back and forth about it.  Duchovny's character causes her to think, and the thinking he evokes awakens in her the compassion she never before paid attention to.  That is why the scene in which she comforts Amber Heard, the actress who plays her daughter, is both touching and understandable.

Many reviewers in the press seem to think the movie cops out in the ending.  I thought it was all tied up too neatly, but the message of redeem yourself before it's too late I thought was a an excellent one.  It seems to me that this film was a rarity in that it asks you to question who you are, rather than what you do or don't have. In a world of shoot 'em up/crash 'em up/kill 'em up movies that are little more than product placement and/or mindless vapid so-called entertainment, this film makes you THINK.  And in my opinion, a film that makes you think is a very good thing.",1272153600,44,3675,4.518126888217522

As the story goes on David Duchovny develops a conscience as he sees how one of the families who have become close friends to him have been affected by there scam are becoming ruined and dysfunctional. The other members of the family played by Amber Heard and Demi Moore are also affected by the relationships they develop. The movie is entertaining, I think it tries to make you think just how far you will go in exploiting people before your conscience catches up with you. In the end David Duchovny conscience catches up to him and he reveals to his neighbors the truth. I would say this movie is a moral comedy that shows that there is good innately in all of us and that there are consequences in trying to covet material things just for the purpose of trying to keep up with the joneses.",1516665600,3,1186,4.49537037037037

Of course there are communities like the one portrayed in this film, but haven't we seen enough of them already? I guess people like seeing this stuff. The good news is the characters actually develop enough that you may not see all the wealth. It's hard to avoid with the sweeping scenery of picturesque mountains and mansions galore, but the actors do a good job of relating to the material.

Duchovny plays his typical self, but he's a likable actor, so it works. Moore is fine as well, and Cole never disappoints. The Joneses may not be the best movie out there, but it offers an interesting premise with a slight opening of an ending which leaves a few questions unanswered.

Examples: the two ""teenage kids"" would never have been hired or kept their jobs if they behaved as these characters do.
The neighbor and the wife who sells beauty products are not believable at all: they are simply there to make the joneses look better.
I found the gay hairdresser's stereotype repulsive and homophobic--not in the least bit endearing.
Is Duchovney's character really talking to an obviously beyond child-bearing age Moore about having a family? Puh leeze.
And finally: she's going to give up her ""career"" to go to AZ with the guy to meet his dad? What: she's going to support him?
None of this is plausible within the plot lines of the film.

Too bad that the film played it safe at the conclusion by involving melodrama.

It makes the viewer aware about thee reasons why we buy things and how money has become the focal point in many people's lives today.

4164658,1,B003PJ1UTS,"I didn't watch the film -- didn't have to --  the 5-star reviewers told me everything I need to know. The plot sounds like a rip-off from the far-superior Truman Show (I see one writer already caught this).  The underlying premise here is that good old fashioned capitalism is bad; it's capitalism that turns us all into a bunch of consumer zombies incapable of self discipline and control. Why is it the fault of ""evil"" corporations every time some idiot overspends on their credit card trying to feed a mindless addiction to satisfy the endless emotional vacancies in their lives?

And exactly who makes all the stuff the Jones are try to sell to their neighbors?  PEOPLE!  People like me, like my friends and, yes, like my neighbors.  We all have jobs, we all make money and, in turn, we all go out and buy stuff. That's what money ultimately is for -- to buy stuff.  I'm a thinking person capable of making my own rational decisions; I don't buy a particular car just because it looks cool and my next door neighbor happens to owns one; I live for the sake of MY life, not to impress my neighbor.

Without having seen this film, I'm already applauding the Joneses!  They may be marketing tools, but they're honest and know exactly what they're doing; it's the neighbors who are the dishonest fakes as they try to elevate themselves to social acceptance without having to earn it.  The ""neighbors"" depicted in this film are representative of spineless and lazy people incapable of living their own lives -- they exist only to serve others.

At no time in history has humankind ever enjoyed the kind of material wealth available to virtually everyone today. In the United States even the poorest have televisions and carry cell phones. Your average working stiff has access to products and services today that didn't even exist 20 years ago, you couldn't obtain them a any price. We're all consumers and consumer-ISM"" is a good thing!  Consumerism is the handmaiden of capitalism; consumerism creates jobs not just in the U.S. but other countries as well. Consumerism gave us GPS, Google, Facebook, iPads, iPhones, HD TV, Amazon, the Internet, Walmart, McDonald's, Lowes, Best Buy, on-line shopping, fiber-optic cable, satellite-based commercial radio, on and on.  One could just have easily made a similar statement back in the 1920's; different technologies but same results.  Back then, people got hooked on buying stuff ""on-time"", on credit. At first it was houses, then cars, then washing machines, then electric irons; virtually every dollar they made went to a debt collector to pay for all the stuff they couldn't afford in the first place.  Back then the banks were the enemy, banks were evil institutions run by evil people like Mr. Potter (It's A Wonderful Life).  Then came the Great Depression, you lost your job then your house, your car, your washing machine and even that wonderful electric iron.  Sound familiar?

Of course it was all the fault of capitalism and those greedy bankers. During the 1930's socialism and communism became all the rage among the disenfranchised working class along with groups of bored restless college students from wealthy families; one was supposed to be apologetic for having financially security even if they earned it by their own labor. And, ultimately, without having actually watched this film, that's the crux of the plot -- the eternal guilt trip we're all supposed to endure for the act of being wealthy.

Have you EVER seen ANY film from Hollywood praising success and the wealth that followed?  Wealth is supposed to be the product of greed, not just any greed, but corporate greed. All wealthy people go that way at other people's expense; that's what we've been told from the day we first entered Kindergarten to the day we graduated from college.  Is it not ironic that the actors making these movies are among the wealthiest people in America if not the world?

Which brings us back to the title of my ""review"".  Just because x-number of people gave this film a 5-star rating, I do not feel predisposed to purchase or rent simply because others raved on about it.  Would it not be far more honest for me to claim that Amazon compensates me for writing a 5-star reviews in an attempt to convince others to buy this product?

4164665,4,B003PJ1UTS,"The Joneses are not a real family, but a marketing ploy, something that becomes evident in the first few minutes of the movie, which begins with Steve and Kate Moore (David Duchovny and Demi Moore), along with their two teenage children, moving into the largest house in an extremely upscale neighborhood. Although they give all the trappings of an intact family, they are really just there to get their new neighbors to want (and buy) all the expensive gadgets (from their sporty car to Steve's top-of-the-line golf clubs) they ""own."" Kate has been through this before. In fact, this is her fifth ""husband."" This is Steve's first go at it. Although he starts out slowly, Steve, a former (but failed) golf pro and car salesman, impresses his friends so well that he soon becomes the best merchandise peddler of the four of them.

In fact, he becomes too great a persuader. His next-door neighbor (played by Gary Cole) is so convinced that Steve's lifestyle is leading to happiness that he tries desperately to keep up with him, buying everything that Steve suggests and more. Unfortunately, he takes on incredible debt, falling behind on his house payments and his credit cards, and is soon headed for financial disaster.

Meanwhile, the ""daughter"" (played by Amber Heard) has an affair with a married man, one that comes to an end when his wife finds out and he unceremoniously dumps her. At the same time, Steve and Kate do the unthinkable. They actually begin to be attracted to each other, which clouds their judgment as marketers.

The concept behind the movie is great, although its point is rather obvious and can be summed up in a sentence: People want to keep up with the Joneses and will go to any extreme to do so. ""The Joneses"" does a tolerably good job of showing this.

The ending (which for obvious reasons I will not divulge) is perhaps the most disappointing moment of the film, not because it's not a happy ending. It is. However, it's rather predictable, and given the negative impact the Joneses have had on various members of the community, is incongruous.",1374796800,3,2077,4.777158774373259

4164670,5,B003PJ1UTS,"This is one awesome movie that speaks volumes about consumerism. The only reason that many won't like this movie is because it is a mirror. And because the truth hurts.

This movie is about a family, that is much like many families of current times. This movie shows reality. This movie shows why many people are in their current circumstances.

This movies show why you should not covet anyone on anything. You get to see what coveting gets you.

Great lessons can be learned from this movie. Many things may glitter but do they really have value?

We own this movie and use it a reminder to remain humble, and keep people first, and to love people first and not fall into the trap of consumerism. To be great stewards over what the Lord has provided and not to get caught up into this material world.

Take a look around and see all the materialism. Look at how all it take is for someone to purchase something, show it off and then every one wants it. Watch the Ethos DVD, you can purchase that DVD here on Amazon.

We have cut down on our consumerism in many ways, cutting cable off, (we use Roku and Logitech revue Google T.V. to stream, antenna T.V, with Moho antenna to view T.V.) growing our on veggies, the use of magic jack or Nettalk for phone service, no smart cell phones for a household of more than six (my husband is the only one who has a smart cell phone due to his job). Cooking at home and much much more. This movie is confirmation that we have made the right steps and will continue to make the right steps in this direction. We have more quality time, and a much better more free lifestyle. We also save much more without a cable bill and smart phone data packages that everyone has to have now days. Our sell phone bill is way less than $200 for five phones. This movie proves good points to not keep up with the Jone$es!

This movie is great through out the whole movie and yes we did laugh at some of the funny parts, but the serious parts really were serious. You can read today's headlines to find that out.

The acting is good with strong performances by all the main characters. Today, computer companies do this type of thing by placing a shill in someplace like Starbucks pretending to be a regular guy when they are actually trying to soft sell a laptop.

4164679,4,B003PJ1UTS,"Knowing the premise of the film even before seeing it, I expected a sharp satire & disemboweling of American consumerism -- and I got it. What I didn't expect was the compassion I felt for the victims of that mentality, here embodied by Gary Cole & Glenne Headly. The toll exacted by their need to keep up with the Joneses is at first comic & pathetic, but ultimately heartbreaking. And sadly, it's really not over the top at all; countless Americans suffer a similar fate to some degree, being so obsessed with looking ""successful"" that they fail as human beings & ultimately lose themselves in the end.

As for the Joneses themselves? David Duchovny is very good as the slick former car salesman who retains a withered root of conscience, one that begins to blossom anew as he sees what's happening to his neighbors (e.g., victims). Demi Moore has the requisite glossy hardness to convince us that to her, nothing is personal, it's all just business. All that ever really matters is being a ""winner"" & getting ahead. And their model-perfect teen ""children"" are marvels at taking advantage of their peers, whose desperation to fit in & be cool makes them very easy prey indeed.

I've tried not to give away too much of the plot, so let me just say that while the redemption of one character is quite believable, I'm not so sure about the other one. Perhaps there was studio pressure to have some sort of a happy ending; but in this case, a somewhat bleaker ending would have been more appropriate. Some people choose to put themselves beyond redemption, and I expected more of that by the end.

Still, how many contemporary films even begin to delve into the emptiness of American consumerism & materialism, rather than encouraging & glorifying it? For that alone, and for the strength of most of the film, I heartily recommend this film to anyone who questions the shallow values of what passes for our culture today. What's frightening is just how plausible the presented scenario really is ... or could it be happening already? I wouldn't be a bit surprised ...",1333497600,6,2065,4.714681440443213
4164680,2,B003PJ1UTS,"The Joneses is the kind of high-concept consumer satire that should make my ears perk right up - a clandestine ""stealth marketing"" company (Lifestage Inc.) infiltrates an unnamed Atlanta suburb in the form of a central-casting power family ""The Joneses"" (Demi Moore, David Duchovny + teens) whose sole purpose is to serve as product-placement avatars to the affluent, high achievement inhabitants of their all too planned community.

With corporate precision, Lifestage completely choreographs their possessions and lifestyle markers (paid for by eager marketers) right down to the switchplates in their insufferably perfect McMansion - inspiring immediate ego-deflating envy among their unsuspecting, McMoron neighbors. This is Stepford USA minus the zombie-like rictus of Katherine Ross.

(The Joneses are in fact one of a thousand family ""cells"" that have been activated and managed in desirable zipcodes throughout the world.)

Ultimately, everything in their pre-arranged domicile is for sale as their cars, clothes, technology and ""flash-frozen sushi"" make tongues wag and sales soar as the faux-Jones consumption virus spreads unabated as they move through every country club, high-end spa and high school locker room they can find - racking up commissions as everyone within their orbit starts obsessing over Audis, Taylor Mades and Bacardi rum punch coolers.

Unfortunately, nothing in this tepid anti-consumerism screed rises above a made for tv sensibility. The screenplay that showed such promise during the initial fifteen minutes just wilts into morose, melodramatic pabulum. Moore and Duchovny develop an attraction that comes from nowhere and lands in the same place.

If you are going to take on a subject as target rich as mindless consumerism, please... just climb over the top with bombastic glee - don't retreat into tired old romantic formulas and bumper sticker humanism at the first sign the subject matter may be getting a bit too heavy. And pretty please, just make the damn thing remotely plausible.

My assumption is that as Lifestage employees, the Jones ""family"" are expert salespeople. They must be, given the pace at which they ingratiate themselves into the community, subliminally inspiring purchases of $70,000 automobiles and sat-tv equipped lawn tractors. Marketing jujitsu accomplished at the speed of light, with the alacrity of a master thief - rendering unbelievable nearly all of their MSRP shenanigans.

The Joneses surely exist in the marketing Twilight, only punching in at night, especially given the time they spend in the daylight sitting around the house wringing their hands over the cosmic meaning of it all.

Although I hate being the spoiler, the pathetic and forced ""happy ending"" where love and integrity inevitably triumpth over venality and greed would even make Frank Capra and Michael Moore snicker in disbelief. In my defense, it's impossible to spoil something that is already curdled.

I actually envied one of their neighbors (the always enjoyable Gary Cole) who decided to pull a Kevorkian and wound up six feet under in his swimming pool proudly planted on his new tractor. At least he found a way out of this mess.

On a slightly more positive note, the entire cast seems game (especially the Joneses high schoolers Amber Heard and Ben Hollingsworth) but they all have the look of professionals who know what cr*p they've been handed and appear to want off the set just about as much as I wanted to throw a brick at my DVD player.

My movies arrived a little earlier than I expected and I was able to send it immediately on to my out of town daughter and since then, she and her husband have enjoyed this movie as much as we have at my house.

4164686,5,B003PJ1UTS,This film really shows the dangers of trying to keep up a perfect image of success at all costs. We are victims of constant stealth marketing campaigns that make us feel inadequate and empty. The film covers similar themes to The Company Men but from a completely different angle. The performances are awesome along with the visuals. If you're ever down in the dumps and feel things are not going good watch The Joneses along with The Company Men and you'll realize the whole system is a rigged scam. It's up to you if you want to fall for it or not.,1309737600,,550,4.401960784313726
4164687,4,B003PJ1UTS,"Beautiful people.  An upscale house in sheik suburbia.  The very finest clothes, furnishings, gadgets, gizmos, toys, autos.  Welcome to the world of THE JONESES, where if it appears too good to be true. . .it is.

The Jones family, Steve (David Duchovny), Kate (Demi Moore), Jenn (a sizzling Amber Heard), and Mick (Ben Hollingsworth) seem to have it all:  looks, charm, humor, intelligence, intrinsic curb appeal.  Yet early on, we really don't know what Steve does for a living (he plays a lot of golf), plus we know Kate really enjoys being pampered at the finest salons and spas, while Jenn and Mick are the mutual hits at their new high school.  Only until we witness this family's non-stop hawking of high dollar goods to their new friends and neighbors do we realize the sad truth:  the Jones aren't who they say they are--they're actually con artists paid handsomely to sell stuff.  And their facade affects next-door neighbors Larry and Summer (Gary Cole and Glenne Headley) to the point where only dire consequences remain.

THE JONESES is extraordinarily clever, witty, and exceedingly dark--all at the same time.  The undertone is like a deadly riptow taking souls out to sea.  One star off for the (lack of) chemistry between Duchovny and Moore; their interactions seem forced and fake.  Yet again, forced and faked make up the modus operandi of THE JONESES.  Cash or credit?

4164688,4,B003PJ1UTS,"As a reviewer I watched The Joneses with great interest. After all, people, including me, make decisions based on what we reviewers say.

The premise of this movie is a chilling what if. The Jones family is a living, breathing, slickly packaged selling machine. Imagine the hottest high school classmates, the coolest family in the neighborhood, the most powerful and seemingly wealthiest family in town taking an interest in the normals and trying to impart some of that cool just for the mere asking (and a credit card or two).

However, all is not paradise when surrounded by glitter and toys. Each member of the Jones family has a handful of issues. And those issues spill out into the town and cause some serious consequences for them all. It is a gawk-at-the-accident type of fascination to watch the facade crumble and to see the depths some will dive to possess what they think is the key to happiness.

Be forewarned. This is not a happy, light film. It's a look into the psychology of want and drive. The R rating is for F-bombs (not excessive) and a female nude scene early in the film when the family dynamics begin to tarnish though the sex scenes are off camera. The ending felt sweeter than the rest of the film predicted and I'm not sure I fully buy it. But it wasn't empty and harsh so those who want ""happy"" endings won't feel the need to throw things at the television. I do think it's a watch once kind of movie, though, so if you are intrigued you might want to view before purchasing.",1304121600,,1506,4.529411764705882
4164689,5,B003PJ1UTS,"Many here have left some pretty dismal reviews about this movie, I can understand how someone can look at this film and be bored or think that this wouldn't really happen but when you live in a neighborhood similar to this one the movie does have some bite to it. I thought it was worth watching, entertaining enough to keep me interested. Maybe it was just Demi or David who held my interest? I do know that having lived in that type of neighborhood  that there is some bite to this movie. What was difficult for me was looking back after my husband died at the life we had and how hard he worked to give it to me, I can say I miss the really nice things that he made possible for me to have but I would go every day for the rest of my life without anything just to have him back.  He died 4 years ago from Cancer.  I saw my own family as well as my husbands go through different stages of jealousy as time passed and we moved into Custom Homes, Drove Mercedes, had a Pool and all the things that go with building a Custom Home very similar to the one's in this film. At the end of the day when my husband died his brother and my sister took everything that they could get their hands on, from ""all my husband's suits, nice coats etc. even his Brief case, while my sister was stealing all the jewelry, perfume, make up and clothes that they could carry out of the house in addition to what they were shipping to their homes.
They were so jealous that they stooped to stealing.  Little do they know all those things are not important when it comes to losing the husband you loved f or 27 years.  Greed is a powerful thing.  We didn't choose the lifestyle we lived to make a ""statement to people we knew"" but we earned the nice things  we had, and just wanted to enjoy them.

I was expecting the ending to go the way it did in this film to a degree, but not quite as shocking.  You gotta know that always trying to keep up with the neighbors might just kill ya.  The idea for this movie was a good one.  I wonder what ever/who ever the idea actually came from? You do  have to wonder at the end of the film if are people  employed by a company to do just what this Company was set up to do I'd hate to think that there really are companies that are in business just for this sole reason.",1303862400,2,2286,4.075892857142857

Along the same vein, but a bit lighter in context.

I enjoyed this show.  It's not groundbreaking, though it is pretty special for a movie to have a plot that we've never seen before.  The acting is fine...not award winning.  But it was just quite enjoyable and I'd tell you to definitely rent it.  You won't feel your evening was wasted (like with some movies)

I enjoyed both Demi and David.....  Oh, and interestingly, for a movie about product promotion, this movie also had a requisite name brand to promote.  It was obvious...as they all are nowadays.

They do a fine job with what they're given, but unfortunately, they've been given the equivalent of what the ""weenie"" of the movie is: A market-driven plot that wants to be all things to all people and ends up being none of them. It wants to be a comedy, but the queasiness of the ""friendly sales pitches"" denies that, and it wants to be a sex romp, but the flatly drawn character of the sex bomb young girl doesn't make it, it wants to be a ""tolerance for gays"" film, but that goes nowhere fast, and it wants to be a ""see what consumerism will do to you"" film, but, sadly, even that comes off as grafted on at the last minute.

First off the concept of this movie is quite brilliant, but the writers and director drop the ball over and over again leaving the viewer dissapointed over what could have been. Its hard to believe moore and duchovny agreed to take part in such a lame and under developed story. Its clear the makers of this were going for a sharp biting commentary on greed consumerism and jelousy, but what we get is a laughable cringe inducing mess that makes a lifetime movie look like high art! and just when you think it cant get any worse it does. this is one to put on your must see bad movies list.

I found this film to be completely engaging. Time flew by as I watched it. I was totally involved with the plot, even though at times I feared it would be cliche and predictable. I was able to predict parts of the plot; however, the way the parts played out was more entertaining than my personal predictions. I admit I enjoyed this film. Would I watch it again? Probably.

4164701,3,B003PJ1UTS,"I hate to give this movie only three stars because I agree strongly with its message and admired its aspirations.

The Joneses is about a family (David Duchovny, Demi Moore, Amber Heard, Ben Hollingsworth) that moves into town. They're a beautiful family, a perfect family, with cool children and all the right products. So of course, seeing them, you naturally want what they have, you want to be them, and how better to be them than to buy the products they own, which they will so gladly and frequently tell you about.

If you've heard of stealth marketing (e.g., where popular high school students are given products by a company so that other less popular students will see this and also want the same product) you will figure out within the first few minutes of the film what the story is about. And you will be way ahead of the filmmakers, who continue to reveal the information in a way that shows they don't realize you've gotten it.

The movie is also about the neighbors (Gary Cole, Glenne Headly), who represent all of us, and who fall for the ruse, with tragic consequences.

This movie has the aspirations of a Truman Show or of a great novel. It tries to add some complexity into the mix by showing how human needs and motivations can disrupt even the best corporate schemes. It creates many admirable questions: In a society based on capitalism can you trust that the salesperson or even your neighbor is telling you the truth? Those products you see your neighbors using: did they even pay for those with their own money? Why do we allow corporations to do this? How is it some people are willing to lie and manipulate others so ruthlessly? What are the consequences to society of allowing our corporations to engage in this behavior?

But those aspirations are only partly achieved. The motivations of the characters are not filled in, as if the movie were taken from a novel and had not enough screen time to do the characters justice. The cathartic moments aren't cathartic because they haven't been set up properly and the chemistry between Duchovny and Moore is unconvincing. The tragedies are more paint-by-numbers than actually creating any emotion in the audience.

So, the movie is about capitalism and stealth marketing. But, finally, it's also about us: Do we have the intelligence, integrity, and strength to neither contribute to, nor fall for, the constant and ever-evolving forms of corporate manipulation?

Three stars.",1287532800,13,2452,4.8238095238095235
4164702,4,B003PJ1UTS,"This is a totally watchable movie that just sails right along.  If you like Duchovny you'll like this.  And what's not to like?  It's fun to watch them con all the people trying to keep up with the Joneses, and it makes a powerful statement about marketing.  In the end though, it's a statement about a materialism.  Duchovny doesn't play quite the rake that he plays in Californication, but he still plays somewhat the rebel genius (in typical low-key fashion).  His chemistry with Demi Moore worked just fine for the scenario they were in I thought, and the kids were interesting enough.  When the ""family"" (or unit) has problems, it's amazing how quickly they're resolved.  If they should be envied of anything, that would be it.",1286668800,,732,4.753968253968254

4164704,5,B003PJ1UTS,"David Duchovny is brilliant as always. The concept is brilliant and the execution daring. The film is about ""all fun until somebody gets hurt"" and is a sharp satire on consumer society.  This movie is very relevant to 2010. The film is elegantly made by gifted first-time writer and director Derrick Borte.
As the patriarch, heart and conscious of the film, Duchovny does one of his most interesting film work to date. His dry wit has never been better used, he can get a laugh out of a perfectly-timed ""Noooooo"", but he also digs into this guy's soul and compellingly lays out the emptiness inside. I think David Duchovny is one of the best actor of his generation.

David Duchovny and Demi Moore are perfectly cast as the too-gorgeous-to-be-true Joneses and they have an appealingly sparky chemistry together that works well. Heard and Hollingsworth have strong scenes and there's terrific support from both Glenne Headly and the always-excellent Gary Cole as their envious neighbours.

The Joneses is a hugely enjoyable comedy drama with a brilliant script and terrific performances from Duchovny and Moore. Highly recommended.

4164705,2,B003PJ1UTS,"Throughout the movie, I was thinking about how this would make a great HBO or Showtime series.  They could really get into the satire, the drama of the characters living double and sometimes triple lives, the challenges of being relative strangers forced to live under one roof and the suspense that comes from constantly wondering if they will get caught.  Not only would they have more time to delve into the consumerism satire, but also the satire of the American family and how the Joneses aren't much different than anyone else.  We're all living fake lives to an extent and we're all corporate whores to an extent.  It just felt more like a TV show.  The ending I saw on my Netflix DVD seemed to be different that what some people seem to have seen.  Mine sounds better.  There was another sequence involving Moore and Duchovny and it gave the whole thing closure.  It was more related to the personal drama than the satire, but by then I had given up on the idea of the movie being clever enough to pull off the satire anyway.  The Gary Cole subplot was about as close as they came.  Overall, as a satire, it just didn't have much going on upstairs beyond the initial concept.  Having said that, I really like David Duchovny.  And Amber Heard is attractive.  And Demi Moore has clearly had all of her parts replaced with plastic, despite what she claims.",1285113600,2,1361,4.551440329218107

4164707,2,B003PJ1UTS,"The Joneses basically establishes itself as dramatic commentary on our current consumer society.  Basically, it's about a group of people hired to act as a wealthy family.  Their job is to pursuade their new friends and neighbors to buy the products their marketing agency is pushing, ranging from luxury cars to perfume to frozen food.  Essentially they take the current model of word of mouth and make it bigger and more high stakes.

As someone who works in advertising, I found myself curious about the premise.  Sadly, the movie did not live up to it whatsoever.  The plot is far fetched to begin with as from a business model a company would NEVER be able to sell enough product based on this model to justify hiring people to do this or providing them free product in order to do so.  There are also so many details about how their jobs play out that seem incredibly implausable.  Yes, many movies are a little over the top so I am not faulting this movie entirely for its lack of realism.  But I don't think they made any attempts to make the premise plausable.

Additionally, I think because the story line was weak, it made it even more difficult to overlook the lack of realism.  Basically the story follows the negative impact their jobs have on their new friends, their struggles between who they really are and the characters they portray, and of course a dash of romance.  The problem is it is all very easy to predict and what drama is there is dragged out in such a way that the movie seems boring and drawn out.

Overall I found this movie to be awful and admittedly only watched it in full because I was on a plane.  Had I been watching the DVD or seeing this in the theater I probably would have turned it off or left before it was over.",1284681600,2,1757,4.433021806853582

Everybody knows about live within your mean but does anyone really does that? that's the key, anyway, not bad, original storyline but if most people agree this could happen and feel bad about the ""victim"" than they might be the potential victim, too, I guess, since the Joneses just doing their job in  a new approach and style , I really do hope that most Americans won't have that kind of way of thinking as the ""victim"" in the movie.

These individuals who pretended to be a family were people who lived their job. They sold their image. Everything they did was aimed towards selling products. The products would range in scope and it was all about turning the highest profit. The perfect life with all the beauty and comforts and no love. Thats the sad part, so many can find joy in what they own or thru organization, control over their environment. These four unrelated humans talk over how they can achieve their goals by feeding the neighbors and the people they come in contact with all the acourtrements that constitute a good life. I think that they see money in objects , as do the people who get hooked, especially Steve's next door neighbor. The neighbor, played by an actor whose name I do not know, has a wife who is also based in selling products and her life seems to revolve around how she can turn profit instead of being in the moment with her husband and finding the joy in that experience. The movie shows the struggle between the sellers and how their hearts win over their heads. What I liked about the film, I liked the pretty house but the warmth was missing. I liked the food, the cool snacks that she served for dinner, I liked how attractive the girls were, and I liked the spa days.

While his wife Kate Jones (Moore) dresses in head to toe in the latest designer cloths. Steve and Kate's kids play the role of being the most talked about kids at school.

It was limited to only limited theaters and went quickly to DVD which made me a bit leery. However, I found this movie to be quite timely and a fantastic idea overall.

The film follows Kate and Steve Jones as they move into a new town with ""their children"" Jen and Mick. The family assimilates easily into the upper class neighborhood and they instantly make friends. Well, perhaps friends is to strong a word for Kate, Steve, Jen, and Mick are not a real family. It is quickly revealed to the viewer that they are in fact a ""unit"" or ""cell"" that moves into a neighborhood to hawk luxury merchandise to their ""friends"" (or rather the people around them). Jen and Mick play the part of the popular high school students who everyone wants to be like while their ""parents"" play the couple that everyone loves and admires. Together the unit's sales skyrocket until things take a more sinister turn and their wheeling and dealing finally catches up with them.

I thought that the acting was wonderful. There were times that the script seemed a bit fluffy but overall the film was very affective.
