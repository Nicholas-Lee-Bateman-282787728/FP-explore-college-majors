8739860,5,B017NE9TIO,"One of the great Hong Kong action comedies. Jackie Chan and Michelle Yeoh make a formidable team in this exhilarating stunt-fest. ""Police Story 3: Super Cop"" (1992) delivers far more action than the big-budget Hollywood product. The incomparable Jackie risks life and limb for the sake of spectacular escapism. Avoid the edited American release and stick with the original 95-minute version.",1370217600,4,391,5.426229508196721
