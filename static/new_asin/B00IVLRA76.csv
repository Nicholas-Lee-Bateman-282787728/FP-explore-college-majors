8645718,3,B00IVLRA76,"America's many regional companies often produce terrific work, especially in the Balanchine style, coached by ex-Balanchine alumni. Pennsylvania  Ballet, however, provide poor value for money in this short-ish, not very interesting programme. Wheeldon's After the Rain is, perhaps the most engrossing excerpt, well danced. The concluding Diamonds section of Jewels has been recorded numerous times already on DVD, and performed with more panache. All in all, a less than thrilling experience.",1442793600,4,492,5.929577464788732
