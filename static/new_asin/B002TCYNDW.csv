8380118,4,B002TCYNDW,"I was reading this listing as Bon Jovi ""Bounce - The Tour Edition"" DVD..I thought the DVD was a Bounce concert..I received a CD & DVD...I would not have bought it cause I only wanted a DVD, already had the CD...The DVD is videos to songs by Bon Jovi...The seller told me to send it back to them & I would get a refund...They were fast at getting back to me...
I decided to keep it...The DVD is excellent...I haven't listen to the CD yet, although I'm not worried about it...Quality of this item is excellent, I suggest the seller to change how it listed, stating it's a CD with Tour Edition DVD...I'm sorry if I confused you, but I was also confused...",1475107200,,652,4.308943089430894
8380119,5,B002TCYNDW,This video is GREAT ! It runs all of the songs off of the Bounce CD in order with either true videos or live performances of each song. Love the live performances and the style of the videos for this album. GREAT VIDEO !,1392336000,,220,4.0227272727272725
8380120,5,B002TCYNDW,It was all that I wanted it to be.  Can say I could listen to Bon Jovi music 24/7. It came in very good shape for being used.  Will order used again.,1353369600,,149,3.625
