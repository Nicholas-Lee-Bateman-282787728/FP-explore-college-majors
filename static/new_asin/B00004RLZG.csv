8173345,4,B00004RLZG,"Definitely not a great western classic, but to watch a beauty like Elke Sommer do her best in a western is definitely worth the price of admission.  It's not the type of film you would expect to see her in, but what she does for ""Frontier Hellcat"", is like what Jane Russell did for ""The Outlaw"".",1468713600,5,296,4.285714285714286
8173346,1,B00004RLZG,"Not much to say;

Racial bigotry, proFiling, and promotion oF a government that is just starting out on a path oF hypocrasy.  IF you want to see what it looks like, watch this poison.  On the other hand, iF you want to know what not to do, watch it.
