I thought every episode here was well done, a few were semi fillers but with a story this huge that is bound to happen.  Good acting, nice extras, better look than the original sets just too name a few.  I reccomend this one to any sci fi fan.",1052956800,,320,3.96875

1844114,5,B00008G8P2,"Andromeda's first season was amazing - one of the better shows to hit television in recent years.  The second season picks up right where the first left off, expanding characters and advancing truly intelligent plots that make you question not only the events, but the morality and purpose of these people.  Episode 3 'A Heart For Falsehood Framed' is my favorite of the collection, an episode with little to no action in it's 'A' plot, the story centers around Becka and another master thief - stringing you along making you ask over and over 'Who's playing who ?'
And people : Appreciate this series while it lasts !  At the twelfth episode of this season, Robert Hewitt Wolfe leaves the show and it becomes just plain BAD.",1050019200,,725,4.692913385826771
1844218,5,B00008G8P2,"Fun and interesting series with a good cast. Andromeda avoids the pitfall of establishing a monster and then spending interminable seasons battling the same boring challenge.  Episodes are generally explorations of various questions about life, and vary a lot.  I rarely get drawn into a series past the first year.

1844222,3,B00008G8P2,"Andromeda is an excellent show, the rating for the show would be 5 stars for me.

However, this is Andromeda on Blu-ray disks, not Andromeda in Blu-ray quality.  I'm not even sure this is DVD quality, to be honest, looks like old broadcast recordings.

1844223,3,B00008G8P2,"5 Seasons, started strong lost its momentum.
The series started out pretty strong and I enjoyed season 1 and 2.  Somewhere around episode 13 of season 3 I realized the series started to smell like fish, and by the end of the season the fish had started to rot.  Maybe it took me that long to realize the only people in the future are greedy self centered megalomaniacs with borderline sadistic tendencies and there are very few average honest people in this future.
 Maybe Happers cowardly compulsive lying started to grate on my nerves too much.  By season 4 I enjoyed seeing him get beat up he is such a horrible moron that creates all the problems he sometimes saves the show from.  Why?  because he just can't help himself... don't you just love the little guy? pff.  Season 5 was a complete ...what?  I guess since they had blown up all the props in seasons 1-4 they settled for bigger profits with less props and let some college intern finish writing the show.
It could have been a great show and it is more than time for its sequel to come out with a real budget.  The actors did a good job, directing was ok if you like to see contradictions in a show which is more the producer/writers fault. The ending 3 episodes were completely lame, I look forward to another show rewriting the ending into a new sequel...  oops that was just dilon having another multiverse hallucination in his hospital bed, his grand daughter the star of the new show visits him and leaves off on some adventure with a lot less sitcom/soap opera drama...  We really don't need that in a scifi.",1520380800,,1576,4.475524475524476

1844227,5,B00008G8P2,"Yes, this series is fairly formulaic SF TV drama. I believe the first 3 seasons were the best written, however, I appreciate the fact that the producers wrote this series to navigate their way to a ""complete"" story. I'm always extremely disappointed when a show is cancelled and the fans/viewers are left without closure.

1844260,3,B00008G8P2,"""Gene Roddenberry's 'Andromeda'"" started off pretty strong with a solid two first seasons. Good (if unoriginal) premise, a couple of intriguing characters, and the inherent charm of nutbag Kevin Sorbo. If it had been allowed to develop according to the vision of showrunner Robert Hewitt Wolfe, it had the potential to be one of the best SF TV shows we'd ever seen.

But as is so often the case, the money people decided that they wanted something different, so they fired Wolfe, hired Bob ""Fire Walk With Me"" Engels, scrapped most of the larger story arcs and added more ""action"", and the show rapidly went to utter crap.

Watch the first two seasons, and the season 3 episodes written by the team of Zack Stentz & Ashely Edward Miller, then stop, and make up the rest in your head.",1517875200,5,783,4.625899280575539
1844261,5,B00008G8P2,"Loved the series and hated that it ended after five seasons.  The last two seasons left a lot to be desired though and appeared to be a pornographic dream for the Harper character.  The series and viewership deserved better than that.

My desire is to see a truly committed ""reboot"" of this series giving it all the latest in CSI (Computer Graphic Imaging) as well as the talent of the current field of imaginative screen writers and directors.  With that I would like to see a lengthy (10 seasons) commitment and the budget to completely support all that it would entail to maintain a great series...maybe with a premium channel production.",1517788800,2,641,4.747747747747748

1844267,2,B00008G8P2,"There are many things to enjoy in the ""Andromeda"" series, but most of them wear low necklines, lipstick and artfully applied mascara.  Remove the eye candy, and what's left on the plate are shaky plots, cartoonish special effects, labored acting, and journeyman writers trying too hard to be Shakespeare.  Almost every episode begins with strident brass theme music and concludes with a scoop of high-minded platitude fading into closing credits and more brass.
Two stars however for sprinkling  a few guest appearances by exceptionally pretty women here and there.  Male viewers: I suggest turning the sound down so you can appreciate them without the distraction of formulaic dialog.",1516838400,,685,5.314814814814815

1844279,4,B00008G8P2,"For those of us who were around when this series was first released, this wasn't a bad series. Graphics were good for the time. Being a series they did what they could to cut corners since Sci-Fi computer animation was expensive then. They reused graphic cut scenes like many of series. The final season was a gift-curse. It was never supposed to happen but, the ending of the fourth season was very confusing and a dreary way to end a 4 season series. The budget was very tight and, if I remember right Lexa Doig was very pregnant so she couldn't play her part until almost the end of the series while a stand in actor filled her spot. Still, I enjoyed the lore of the series. It's worth a watch but, be warned season 5 drags a bit without the ship and the slow pace the team takes to get back together. Its not BSG or a Trek series but it can kill 42 minutes at a time and some how you realized you have watched a whole season without even knowing it.",1516233600,,953,4.184782608695652
1844280,3,B00008G8P2,"In a word, meh. It's Science Fiction with ok graphics. If that's all you care about then you'll probably like this. Plots are weak but ok, acting is fine, scripts are a joke. Maybe this is supposed to be campy and funny. If so, I missed the point. It's as if they took every version of Star Trek and boiled them down to just the boring and lame parts and this is what they got.

Ok I guess as background for when you're doing something else. Maybe it's a parody and I missed the point, if so you might enjoy this. I gave it two seasons hoping it'd jell into something. It didn't. Being TV I'd blame the Producer, not the Director...oh, and the writers. Actors did the best they could with this turkey.

Three stars might be overly generous.",1516147200,,740,4.2785714285714285

1844345,3,B00008G8P2,"Season #1 is good, loved the first episode, but it became too much like Hercules. At times Tyr's character is written as ""too obvious"".

In many respects it's very different Star Trek.

*** spoil ***
It didn't make sense that they did not obtain a full crew after the System's Commonwealth is formed. They alluded towards ""new crew members"", but there weren't any. Also, I was looking forward to the war with the Magog, which was the whole reason for the System's Commonwealth to begin with.

And, the 300 year dark age which comes into play, yet the Andromeda is STILL the largest in the fleet and doesn't meet superior enemies, like hardly ever, it's just wow. A lot is done in 300 years in a world where there is already a level of technology. It did not make sense. The whole idea that civilization is built around the government, the System's Commonwealth, is well, pie-in-the-sky.

1844354,3,B00008G8P2,"I never found a reliable review, so here it goes. I have a 65"" plasma that has been calibrated by THX. The outer box is rather flimsy, but the disc boxes are solid. They have swing trays, which I like. None of my discs were lose. On loading the pilot, I found the menus looked nice and loaded quickly. The picture was pleasing. The upscaled and cropped SD CGI effects hold up better here than they do with Babylon 5. I noticed a few jagged edges, but not frequently, and it held up really well in later seasons. Colors were tight and accurate. Plenty of detail. A sampling of other season 1 and 2 episodes were similar. Then I loaded a couple episodes from season 3, and was rather disappointed. The picture was rather flat and soft. Similar, but less soft was season 4. I didn't sample season 5.
Then I loaded up my DVDs. These were 4:3 season sets, not the Slipstream collection. The season 1 DVD case was terrible, by the way, with an atrocious way to hold the discs, which almost invariably leads to lose discs and scratching. It has a butterfly thing on each side, which you compress, then release. So there is an upgrade to the packaging from what I had before. But I didn't notice a significant difference in overall picture quality. The main differences are that the blu ray offers all episodes in 16:9, where most are 4:3 on DVD, and the colors were a bit different. Not better or worse, just different. I suspect the blu rays are upscaled from PAL format, which has about 25% more resolution than (American) NTSC. Given they had to zoom in about 30% to provide the 16:9 picture, that would explain why the quality is similar while zoomed, as well as the slightly different color space.
So overall, the packaging is better, and it comes in 16:9 from start to finish, but there is unfortunately no otherwise significant upgrade in picture quality from the DVDs.",1489104000,8,1869,4.51622418879056

The Andromeda.... with the Superfine Lexa Doig as Andromeda Ascendant, Laura Bertram ( Loved the Trance Gemini Character she portrayed),Lisa Ryder as Beka Valentine and later Brandy Ledford as Doyle. Not only were the ladies beautiful, they were all bad asses, yes even Trance.....
Now for the guys. Just really like Kevin Sorbo as Dylan Hunt (Highguard Captain), as an actor and a human being. Keith Hamilton Cobb as The Nietzschean Tyr Anasazi, great acting you really wanted to punch his smug Nietzschean face. Gordon Michael Woolvett as Seamus Harper the Kaylee Winnit Frye counterpart from Firefly, the Ships mechanic/engineer and Brent Stait as Rev Bem. That makeup must have been murder. Just an awesome show.

Dylan's upbringing on Tarn Vedra, Beka's childhood and dis-functional family aboard the Maru, how Rev Bem became a Wayist Priest, Harpers fond memories of Earth even though invading aliens turned it into a planet of horrors.

1844542,1,B00008G8P2,"I like the Andromeda series but season 5 is a complete disaster.

Sure the show is low budget and the writing is sub par but it always seemed to have a nice charm to it. With season 5 any charm it had is now gone replaced by writing from a 12 year old boy lost in random thought fantasy land.

The story line for season 5 makes no sense (spoiler alert!).....wait how can I spoil what is already a spoiled rotten mess? The Vederans having to creating a solar system of barley inhabitable planets where random people get shipwrecked on and taking off never to be seen again is silly. Even more silly is the planets are going to be used to slow down the Vederan star when it comes back after taking off for some unknown reason.

This is crazy 12 year old boy daydreaming. I know most Sci-Fi shows do not stick to science very well but come on! Just imagine the sun taking off one day for no reason and then using Venus and Mars to slow it down when it comes back. That's like throwing golf balls at an 18 wheeler going down a turnpike at 75 MPH to slow it to a stop.

There are more insane story lines but I don't want to turn this into a book so to the next disaster we go. The little sayings at the start of each show were mostly ok with a few here and there that were good in the previous seasons but with season 5 each and every one were about as thought provoking as a 10 hour speech on trickle down economics given by Ben Stein.

The writing must have been farmed out to teenagers in the early 1990's. I feel sorry the actors had to say most of there lines on film so the humiliation is forever haunting them.

The acting too is 98.43% of the time ""phoned in"". It's obvious everyone had given up on the show and just wanted to go home.

On the bright side like many of the episodes of past seasons EVERY episode of season 5 has 20-55% recycled footage from previous episodes in the series thereby reducing the shows carbon footprint because they did not have to spend time writing new material or shooting new scenes. Everyone can stay home one or two days a week instead of driving their cars and using materials to create sets and keep the lights and air conditioning off in the studio.

So when you see footage from old episodes for 20-55% of a season 5 episode know that your saving the Earth. Oh by the way the Earth gets blown up for no reason at the end.

I could go on and on but you get the idea, there is almost nothing to love about Andromeda season 5. You can skip it and pretend that the ending of season 4, that was not a good ending itself, was the ending of the series.",1251590400,8,2588,4.129224652087475
1844543,5,B00008G8P2,One of the best Sci-Fi Series ever on TB.  And this DVD Boxed Set delivers the final season in crystal clear video.  Was very happy with the purchase and would do it again.,1250208000,,172,4.181818181818182
1844569,2,B00008G8P2,"While I was not a fan of the first four seasons of ANDROMEDA, my reaction to Season Five was quite mixed.  One of my main complaints about Seasons One through Four was that except for Trance, there was little or no character development, and that the overall narrative tended to be more episodic than serial.  Season Five both featured more character development and had far more of a serial composition, but disappointingly the series didn't get much better.  In fact, in many ways it was less enjoyable than previous seasons.  Why?  Partly because the changes to the show in Season Five were simply undesirable.  After the apparent rescue of their corner of the galaxy by Trance's destroying the mother shihp, the crew of Andromeda found themselves in a dingy, harsh, and unpleasant solar system.  To make matters worse, most of the crew members were angry with Dylan Hunt and Trance for getting them in this fix.  Nevermind that their anger was not believable (destruction of the mother ship?).  It was all just unpleasant and, to quote Iggy Pop, no fun.

Another problem was the pregnancy of Lexa Doig.  Since she played three characters on the show, her inability to play much of a role changed the chemistry on the show.  The timing of her pregnancy was such that it relegated her to her ""A.I."" character for nearly the whole season.  She then came back to the show probably a bit too soon after giving birth.  Her place was somewhat filled by the inclusion of former Penthouse model Brandy Ledford (though to be fair, she is a much better actress than you would expect given that pedigree) as a new android, Doyle.  And watching the interplay between Doyle and Romy when Lexa Doig made a late season reappearance makes you wish that they could have been together longer than they were.  Their android competition was a lot of fun.

But in the end, the season was simply insufficiently entertaining.  About the only thing that made it watching was the ongoing saga involving Trance.  She was far and away the most interesting character on the show and the only one who was developed nicely over the course of the five years of the show.  But nothing could overcome the countless problems in the series.  In the 21st century I wonder how many people really want a male lead character over whom women instantly swoon.  I have no patience for a show that has two people look at each other and almost immediately start making out.  In what way is that appealing?  The plots of the individual episodes remain for the most part on the pretty simplistic level of the first four seasons.

Still, even though ANDROMEDA is not a very good show and despite its being flawed on a host of levels, I was weirdly sad to see it come to an end.  One of the strengths of TV is that you get to know a group of characters.  You end up spending many hours with them and you get pleasure out of spending time with them (I suspect that this is one of the things that lies behind the success of such otherwise incredibly bland shows making up the CSI and LAW AND ORDER franchises).  So, even though I have very little to say about ANDROMEDA in any of its five seasons, I was sad to have to say goodbye to Trance and Dylan and Andromeda (in all her forms) and Beka and even Harper.  Go figure.",1245283200,6,3274,4.539249146757679
1844570,3,B00008G8P2,"ANDROMEDA in Season Three continues to embody many of the worst stereotypes of bad TV Sci-fi and shows why it is one of the least respected TV genres.  As someone who loves both quality TV and Sci-fi.  The show's vices are many:  bumpy headed aliens, repeated use of almost magical scientific solutions to problems, simplistic good guys and bad guys, a complete lack of character development (except for Trance, one of the few truly interesting characters on the show), and the use of one TV cliche after another.  Even after three seasons the show remains astonishingly superficial.

Nonetheless, while objectively one can say that ANDROMEDA is not a very good series, it is occasionally likable.  Kevin Sorbo's tagline could be, ""I'm not a hero, but I play one on TV.""  He isn't terribly convincing as a hero, but like in HERCULES, he is likable to the degree that he doesn't take himself seriously.  As long as he keeps his tongue firmly inside his cheek, he isn't too bad.  When he is supposed to be taken seriously, the result can be groanworthy, especially when he begins kissing some girl a couple of minutes after meeting them.  One potentially good thing for the series is the departure at the end of Season Three of the worst character on the show, the unrelentingly macho and wooden Tyr.  Because I am watching this series for the first time, I don't know yet whether or not this will improve matters on the show or not, but we can hope.  The rest of the cast stayed pretty much the same.  Easily the most intriguing character on the show is Trance, and during the season we got a bit more about what her deal is.  We've not yet gotten to the bottom of things and if we don't by the end of Season Five, when the show comes to an end, I'll be quite disappointed.

Narratively, Season Three was approximately along the same quality as Season Two.  The stories were sometimes decent enough, but weren't integrated into much of an overall narrative.  The ""commonwealth"" story in the background never feels like more than window dressing rather than a story that the writers are truly committed to.  The main reason for the improvement in Season Three was a dramatic increase in the quality of special effects.  Most probably a new CGI software program became available.  But even here the limited vision of the show's makers is apparent.  The resulting CGI is vastly more detailed than what was seen in the first two seasons, but it is persistently unrealistic and super detailed.  Why is the latter a problem?  Contrast the CGI on FIREFLY and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.  Most probably the shows use the same software.  But on FIREFLY, made at the same time as ANDROMEDA, the decision was to give the look of the software a realistic feel.  The ""camera"" would sometimes be out of focus looking on a scene and would sometimes zoom in on the object of interest.  Even after focusing, the image would be complicated by smoke or distorting heat exhaust or some such thing.  The same is true on BSG.  But on ANDROMEDA every CGI shot is in perfect focus with no visual obstacles to the viewer.

But the biggest problem on the show is the lack of character development.  Take the romantic situations on the show.  The characters are like the figures on Keats's ""Ode to a Grecian Urn,"" forever chasing others but never catching them.  Romy is attracted to Dylan.  Harper is attracted to Romy.  Beka and Dylan are attracted to one another.  Beka and Tyr share some attraction.  Does anything happen?  No.  Why?  Partly because the characters are not, by the rules laid down by the writers, allowed to ever change.  And perhaps because the writers realize that this is one of those Sci-fi series -- unlike FIREFLY, BSG, and FARSCAPE -- that appeals more to teens and young boys than it does to adults.  I suspect they feared that allowing any interesting emotional involvements on the show might alienate their younger viewers.  As a result, another reason for why the show never really becomes very interesting is added.

One last comment.  Despite my not thinking that this is a very good show, it is odd that only parts are available new.  I had to buy the first three seasons used, but was able to buy Seasons 4 and 5 new.  It would be nice if the whole series were available somehow.",1244592000,,4280,4.65287049399199

1844575,3,B00008G8P2,"Season 5 of Andromeda is better than season 4. A lot better. But unfortunately that isn't really saying very much. The final season of this show saw a return to a slightly more goal-oriented, arc-based storytelling, and that is definitely in its favor.

The trouble is that the goal is too vague and too pointless. The show started out back in season 1 with the goal of restoring the Commonwealth. The goal in season 5? Repair the ship and get out of a claustrophobic star system. Whenever you go from something so grandiose to something so basic, there's practically no way to keep it from being a disappointment.

While there were a few decent moments in the season, such as the return of Hohne and the corridor scene with Harper in the last episode, they are few and far between. And, more importantly, they can't compete with such ridiculous horrors as making Drago Museveni - the father of all Nietzcheans - into an annoying punk, rather than the warrior that the images of his remains would have you believe he was (remains which they actually show in that episode, by the way). The season tries to have more good moments than it actually does, but many of them fall flat, such as the whole thing with Beka's ""father"". The rest of the time, one of the main cast punches somebody for looking at them the wrong way, because that is clearly the best way to solve all problems, including diplomatic ones. Add on top of all this the conspicuous absence of Lexa Doig (Andromeda herself) for much of the season.

Dylan Hunt was never the most interesting character on the show (that honor would go to either Tyr Anasazi or Rev Bem), but when the show first started out he was not the larger-than-life character that he eventually became. In season 1, and somewhat in season 2, Dylan was wrong sometimes. He sometimes made morally questionable decisions in pursuit of his goals. What made him likable was that he was always trying to do the right thing, even when he went about it in questionable ways.

Over the years, his character transformed into an over-the-top hero. Always right. Always good. There was no questioning his decisions, because he was the Super Awesome Captain. It really did become Hercules In Space, except less fun. Despite some attempts in season 5 to add more interesting facets to his character (making him into an evolved Vedran, for example), he retained the one trait that made the character completely uninteresting: infallibility.

Season 5 could have been worse. It could have been another season 4. But the fact of the matter is that it simply wasn't enough to redeem what started out as an imperfect but promising show. More than anything, season 5 left me with a feeling of ""who cares?""

The final episode brought the show back to its Commonwealth/anti-Abyss focus, but it had been absent for so long, and things had been left in such a state of disarray without resolution, that it just didn't cut it. There were too many abandoned threads in the Commonwealth storyline, which adds up to nothing but too little reason to be interested.

Consider: despite a season 2 episode indicating that the Vedrans were still around and very much aware of Hunt's mission to restore the Commonwealth, when the Vedran homeworld is finally reunited with the rest of the known worlds, you don't see any Vedrans. Aside from the fact that the people in that system can now travel to other places, there's nothing to indicate that the reunion even matters in the grand scheme of things.",1192665600,5,3500,4.727868852459016

I personally didn't care for the ending of season 4; Dylan Hunt's rise to near-godhood was so self-indulgent.

Season 5 was just horrible.  The writing and directing were mindless.  The same pointless, poorly-choreographed fighting that plagued Hercules was too abundant throughout the season. Every episode seemed to have a drunk picking a fight with one of the crew for no reason, just so Dylan or Becka or whoever could prove their fortitude.  It was painful to watch the story go absolutely nowhere every episode - in the same terrible sets.  The plots were just so circuitous with no payoff.

Astronomical bodies being represented by avatars?  Becka the matriarch of the Nietzschean race via a time-traveling Drago?  A black hole in love with Dylan?

1844578,2,B00008G8P2,"(Spoilers abound!!)

I give it two for the only real reason I liked this season at all; Trance (Laura Bertram). Yeah ok I know, fanboy alert! But her appeal tripled from an 'ehh, ok pixie chick, that affords potential and not much else, to her presenting different facets of her character/acting ability over following seasons. This season was another change for her and it worked, I guess. Seeing as how she was an amnesiac it made sense to her as frail as she was. Rather than seeing the mature, no-nonsense version in previous seasons become what should have been saved for this season. A victim of writing is all.

The show itself, the biggest victim. There were too many arcs thrown in without any previous foreshadowing. As if a military commander of Hunt's proficiency would go without doing any kind of recon. Where am I? What system do the stars in the sky tell me I am in? I mean once I found out I was on my 'home' planet I'd have to know about everything going on in-system. Who was on every planet, who ran what schemes where, what circles everybody trod in, any more missing friends I might be running into, etc. NO surprises. Not for me as a character, but for the audience, yes.

The point about the thugs and bar-fights, I agree with. Too many with so much more to deal with, potentially, than dumb, drunk sheople.

Evidence and reasoning as solutions to erratic issues the crew had to manage, were drawn out of thin, vacuuous, air. It seemed they knew they were on their way out, and pseudo-writers were stepping up to Majel Roddenberry with requests to do their own episode. A buddies of mine and I would ridicule this show/season to no end.

Previous seasons were too run on a fuel they invented, and not probably not true to Gene's source material. My buddy and I deamed it 'andromeda'. The drug that lets you write anything and get away with it. You don't need foreshadowing, you don't need to tie loose ends, you don't even need entire armadas to disappear in accordance with the laws of physics.

Nope!

Not with andromeda! Take a hit and those delusions will sell better than logic in no time! 'Majel! Majel! <snort> Let me do my own episode, maaan, I just took some <sniffle> andromeda I should get to do one now.'

After it was over, after the complaints I had about what a sun might do to a planet it physically encountered, or to how a sun can be dragged/towed by anything smaller than itself, I still wanted more. I had to know what else...even after the lights went out on the show, literally! I seemed to be missing something. I was empty, unsatisfied. I soon realized it's probably because I didn't get enough to begin with.

Alas I wanted what I had in mind, and not what I got. <sigh> So rich this story was. They just got away with poor fight choreography, repetitious stock footage, rushed story-wraps, and regarding their audience as sheople in previous seasons.

I admit, everyone on the shows production team could out-perform and out-produce me in a tv show-making contest. Being fair I have to take into account any problems they had with Cobb and a lacking budget. But that doesn't mask plot-holes.

I should have watched this years ago before I hit up ""Firefly"", ""Heroes"" and ""Enterprise."" I was spoiled.

Rushed through it they did, mmmmmm. Mmmmmm.  My own council I will hold on what is good.

I liked it because of Trance, 2 or 3 good fight sequences, the idea the storyline presented, but not how any of it was executed...except for Trance of course.",1176249600,3,3498,4.567092651757188

I started watching Andromeda right from the pilot when it first aired.  I hung out in the chatroom at andromedatv.com before they took it away.  Zack Stentz and Ash Miller, two of the shows writers, would frequent the chat room. They were useful in giving some inside information that not a lot of people knew at the time. I don't pretend to know the full story, but I know there were some disagreements between Keith Cobb  and the show's producers at the time that wanted to take his character in a different direction. Cobb eventually left the show and went to The Young and the Restless because of it. With no Tyr, the writers were forced to take the show into another direction. Budget cutbacks didn't help any either, and they had lost viewer support after the show jumped the shark in season 4. Season 5 wasn't what they had intended I don't think, so for what they had to work with, I think they did a really great job with it. They kept the storyline flowing without detracting too much from the earlier seasons. The series finale was kind of a surprise because it was unexpected, but all in all I think was satisfying enough. So if you liked seasons 1 - 4, keep in mind, season 5 is different but still worth it.

Boring bar scenes on the lost Tarn Vedran planets albeit with no Vedrans, everyone dressed in raggedy clothes and two artificial suns that somehow give warmth to 9 earthlike worlds. If it wasn't stupid mind games, it was one bar fight after another against hapless thugs and gangs. What about the abyss and the magog?  In the last two episodes, which really shouldve been only 1, the writers most have realized vacation time was near and they created a writers convenience to wrap up the whole season 5 mess.
Thoroughly unsatisfying.
It could have been so-much-more.

1844715,3,B00008G8P2,"Season 3 of Andromeda, like the previous 2 seasons, has some episodes that are worth watching more than once and some that are not. Unfortunately, the number of episodes that are not worth multiple viewings increased dramatically.

Among this season's strong points are episodes like ""The Unconquerable Man"", which gives a look at what might have been had Dylan Hunt's first officer Gaheris Rhade won their battle - like any decent Gaheris Rhade feature, it attempts to paint him as a man who wanted a good future, but whose actions created a bad one.

""Cui Bono"", while not all around great, brings back Beka Valentine's ""uncle"" Sid - the strongest point about the episode is that the return of this one character brings depth to three characters: Sid, Beka, and Beka's dad. ""The Lone and Level Sands"" takes the characters to an old Earth ship that has been exploring deep space and manages to take a conflict among its crew and not paint any of the characters as bad people.

Among the bad are episodes like ""Vault of the Heavens"", where Dylan is drawn by a mysterious voice to a planet where glowing women want to have sex with him (because they must procreate to save their people, of course). ""The Illusion of Majesty"" features soft porn actress Krista Allen in an entertaining (mostly thanks to Tyr) but ultimately pointless episode.

One of the biggest saving graces in season 3 is Tyr Anasazi, who has always brought an interesting balance to the show with his self-interested but generally realistic viewpoints. Unfortunately for the show, this was the character's last season (as far as I'm concerned, his appearance in two episodes of season 4 should just be ignored, since it's such a bad send-off).

Arguably, this is the last good season of Andromeda, but it's also arguably the first horrible one. It just depends on what you like about the series. One of the season's biggest weaknesses is the lack of a driving purpose. The episodes are basically just a bunch of disconnected events that have no real relation to each other or any kind of overarching purpose.

1844718,3,B00008G8P2,"About midway through season 2, head writer, executive producer, and let's face it, creator of Andromeda Robert Hewitt Wolfe was jetissoned because Kevin Sorbo wanted to garner more casual viewers, and wanted more screen-time for himself.

Things were just beginning to gather steam with the first two seasons too. The characters were progressing nicely, in fits and starts (see Trance Gemini), and the threads that were to weave an epic story arc began to show. After Wolfe was fired, some peculiar things happen, and as a result season 3 is just what the star wanted, more episodic. But Mr. Sorbo didn't seem to realize the crux of sci-fi fandom-continuity.

After season 3 they seemed to realize their mistake, but it was too late. The trajectory the show was on had changed irrevocably, and I believe, for the worse.

Don't get me wrong, Andromeda is and always has been a great, fun show to watch. But I felt the strength was in the writing, not the action, in the ensemble cast, not in a single star, and in its grand scale. Keith Hamilton-Cobb (Tyr Anasazie) left after this season for precisely these reasons, and the show was greatly diminished in his absence.",1138924800,8,1168,4.800995024875622
1844719,5,B00008G8P2,"The show? 5 stars, I love it - the blend of humor, accurate portrayal of the military, silly schlock and deep philosophy is indescribable (but that won't stop me from trying!). I absolutely love the deadpan humor, calm decision making, and understated wit; I love the introspection and contemplation on the nature of reality, leadership, friendship, and honor; I love the growth of the characters and the really stupid puns.

This show does the military, specifically the decision making process of a good officer and the calm reactions of a good team, better than many shows advertised as serious and realistic military movies. I emphasize good because in the real world not all officers are calm under pressure, steely of gaze and noble of jaw. But the good ones think quickly and clearly and don't drop their morals at the first sign of an ethical conflict, so while the scenarios may be simplistic the judgement used is relatively accurate. My hat off to the writers, who possess brains of unusual size in their skulls.

One thing to note: the intro to the show? ""The universe is a dangerous place..."" etc? Flippin hysterical. It's just the right note of overblown drama and inspiring trumpet synth, it cracks me up every time. I irritate my husband because we hit ""skip chapter"" as soon as we can, but inevetably we hear that opening line as quoted above and inevetably I make up a following line - ""...But that's ok, my jaw's big enough to handle it!"" or something like that. It's completely irresistible...

But the DVD set I got was flawed; the DVDs are double sided (always a mistake) and on one of the sides of disk 4 the show got stuck. I tried the usual tricks to get it past the stuck point but ended up going to the menu to get to the next chapter, ""rewinding"" until I got stuck at the end of the bad spot, and playing from there - and missing a good chunk of that chapter. Then again in the second episode on that side.

It was just one side of one disk, affecting two episodes, but it was really irritating. I love this show! Having to muck around and then to miss a piece was very uncool.",1136332800,3,2105,4.517060367454068

1844721,4,B00008G8P2,"The third season had some problems.  There were a few episodes, especially the first one ""If the Wheel is Fixed"", which simply failed the basics of story telling and were just plain confusing messes.  Also, the Tyr-Dylan conflict lessened (until the last few episodes), and without that constant threat Dylan became less of a strategist and more of a go-for-broke hero and Jesus-figure which was less interesting.  The only character that improved this season was Trance, whose powers and ultimate goal became a lot clearer.  And I certainly agree with the other reviewer that Dylan bedded way too many space women.  It had a dampening effect on the previously tension-filled relationships between Dylan and Andromeda and Dylan and Beka.

However, that doesn't mean that there isn't a lot of entertainment in this box.  ""The Unconquerable Man"", an alternate history where Rhade killed Dylan, is probably the best episode - both dramatic and moving.  ""Deep Midnight's Voice"" is probably the only other episode that gets the Nietzschean philosophy right, and is the start of restoring Tyr to his 2nd season glory.  ""Point of the Spear"" is probably the best representation of large-scale fleet strategy in any TV sci-fi show (something that Deep Space Nine, for all its great effects, really blew).  ""The Risk All Point"" is a great Beka episode.  There were also great moments of comedy, especially ""The Illusion of Majesty"".

The user interface of the disks is, again, streamlined and easy to use.  Fewer bonuses than before, but still some interesting stuff.  I don't know why episodes are only referred to by their numbers instead of their names.  Front loaded with (skippable) ads for ADV anime.",1109030400,7,1696,5.072202166064982

Now i don't know what happened, but Season 3 bombed...badly in my eyes at least, right from the start the commonwealth seems to be up and running with no real worries.(huh?) No one even mentions the damn worldship until mid series, and thats all it is...a mention. Crew conflict and personal agendas went right out the damn window! Tyr is suddenly Dylan's loyal little lapdog, Trance is just a ditz, Becca is just a pilot with no (apparent) flash issues, Harper is Harper, (but he always has been, so that was ok.) The series had very little to offer in the way of story Arc, the two best episodes were the return of Rev Bem, and the last episode.

1844724,4,B00008G8P2,"Series 3 started off really weird. It seems to have suddenly turned into a weird kind of comedy. In series 1 & 2 there was a definite kind of relationship between Dylan and the crew. He was a good captain, roll model, father figure, highest ideals etc. In series 3 Dylan and the crew continually slings casual witty remarks to one another as if nothing really matters. And if they believe nothing really matters then the audience won't take it seriously either. It breaks the illusion. In every ""critical situation"" we now see Dylan basically kind of saying ""Whatever!"". This casual approach waters down both his roll and shows strong personality. In series 1 & 2 Dylan was always very concerned with acting appropriately with visiting dignitaries. In series 3 he's over casual and dismissive when talking to even leaders of entire worlds. Oh and Dylan tends to make love to every visiting attractive woman he meets, and with no real relationship. Weird. Its just ""wow she's hot lets make love"". The character is now shallow and its hard to have any kind of respect for him.

I'm not sure what is going on here. In the past there was a good balanced of personalities. Now there are too many comedians. Series 1 & 2 worked because Dylan was basically the straight man and father figure. Comedy was left to the Harper character who is brilliant. Straight man and funny man - good balance.

Despite this real flatness in series 3 I'll persevere and hope that series 4 well be back up to scratch.  In Australia we don't get the series so I haven't seen beyond series 3. Despite this poor review I want to say well done all involved with Andromeda. You have created some great SciFi.

1844749,2,B00008G8P2,"The first 5 episodes of season 4 are a great disappointment.  Like the tinny music that is suppose to heighten the drama, all the episodes are 'out of tune' so to speak.  Perhaps it is because the episodes are about 40 minutes a piece, but it all seems to be sped up.

The element of drama is missing.  Andromeda has always had humor and it is not a heavy SciFi program, but these shows have no drama or tension.  In one episode, the ship Andromeda is going to crash into a moon.  The crew must blow up two devices on the moon that are causing this crisis. However, it all seems to be a lark for the crew.  Becka and Harper go off to scavenge another crashed ship and the mad genius villian can't figure out that there are explosives on his key weapons.

The villians are all controlled by the Magog 'Deity' whose only desire is to kill Dylan Hunt.  If the Magog Diety can control all these people across vast distances of space, why can it not kill Dylan.  There are more inconsistencies. Harper somehow now has a mother.  I thought his parents died.  Andromeda is not a show you watch for logic, but it normally keeps to the story line.

Dylan is diminished and Becka is just now silly.  I even found it hard to understand what had just happened in parts.

1844750,4,B00008G8P2,"Even though the series was going in a new direction during Season 3, it did have some great moments. Now that season 4 has passed and the show is distinctly different, we can say season 3 was the last of the Robert Hewitt Wolfe Era.
The Right Horse. In this episode, a man is being held on Veritas for stealing DNA secrets from TechnoCorps. Abel Ladrone was a man Beka had a crush on for years and given the direction of season 3, this was explored too much. The show set up Beka's friends against her (as she was leading with her hormones and not her brain) and the people of Veritas against the Andromeda and TechnoCorps against them all. This episode is a B level ep.
What Happens To A Rev Deferred. This show was done in response to all the fans who missed Rev after Brent Strait left the show in Ouroborus (Season 2). Essentially the crew receives a message from Rev Bem on a doomed world and they go and find them. It's a clip show with some new material. In the end, Rev is changed by some entity and we never hear about it much again. This is a C level episode. But still enjoyable.
Point of the Spear. This show was actually pretty good. The planet of Samsara (likely named after Sorbo's wife. Sam is his wife's name, Sara was her Andromeda character's name) is being threatened by the Pyrians who are wanting to pyroform (as opposed to terraform) the planet. But they are being led by someone suspiciously like Trance. In the end, Dylan faces a difficult choice of how to deal with an unsolvable problem. His choice would send a message. I give this one an A.
Vault 0f The Heavens. This episode was written by Harper. Well, the actor of course. It's very much a fantasy story, not quite in the mold of Andromeda. Dylan hears a voice directing him to a planet where the queen must mate in order to spread her energy to re-energize her people. I give this one a C.
Deeep Midnight's Voice. Here the Drago Kazov are looking for a slip scout that had been traveling slipstream from before the fall. The information it has would allow someone to predict slipstream and allow AIs to navigate cleanly. Very valuable. It was found on an Earth like planet that has limited technology. The B story has the beginning of intrigue regarding Tyr and the fulfillment of his plans which are explored by the end of the season. Unfortunately, the series never kept with this theme. I'd also give this an A.",1087084800,2,2397,4.413092550790068
1844751,4,B00008G8P2,"Not the end of the series but the end of the series as envisioned by Robert Hewitt Wolfe. The show had great potential and was living up to it, but Tribune wanted to go in a different direction. The first two seasons showed how closely it was tied in thought to the last three seasons of ST DS9 (RHW also wrote/produced for them). Character and idea development gave way to fantasy and lowering the intellectual standard. I still enjoy the show, but clearly season 4 and the upcoming season 5 are like another show.
319 - Illusion of Majesty. In this episode, the crew ends up in a garbage dump star system and cannot get out. A woman who poses as a princess and a priestess as a scam promises to get them out. Much innuendo later, Dylan outwits everyone to get out. Not a great episode.
320 - Twilight of the Idols. Excellent episode. In this one we find Dylan's old mentor and Admiral still alive after 300 years in the form of Michael Ironside's character. Finally a person who can out maneuvre Dylan. This is like a classic Andromeda with good conflict and tension and a moral delimma that is left unresolved.
321 - Day of Judgement, Day of Wrath. Another good episode. An old adversary, the founder of the Restorians, and a former commonwealth ship AI comes back to take over another ship in the new commonwealth. But before that, he takes over Andromeda's avatar and leaves everyone questioning. This show was filled with emotional tension and was quite good. It helps that in real life Shanks and Doeg are married.
322 - Shadows Cast By A Final Salute. Bittersweet episode. Very good one but sad as it sent the show into a whole different universe from how it was created.

If this is volume 3.4, I would really like to order it.  Unfortunately, I HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING!  What's the deal with this description?  Just a bit vague, don't you think?",1078963200,5,333,4.559322033898305
1844778,5,B00008G8P2,"This ia great DVD loved the interview with Kevin and the bloopers/outakes with Lisa, as well as all the other extras. Looking forward to seeeing the next DVD.  I have collected Andromeda since it first came out on DVD and will continue to do so.  Andromeda is so refreshing.  The actors especially Kevin are great, as are the writers.  The worlds they take us into are so believable and for an hour you get lost in their adventures.  Andromeda is a must for any DVD collection.",1075161600,9,477,4.5
1844779,5,B00008G8P2,"This is not so much a review as an explanation of the ""error"" described in the prior review posted by another customer. There is not really an ""error"" on the part of the manufacturer, but rather confusion in the way our partners at Amazon.com have chosen to list the products.
I have tried to explain this ""problem"" to Amazon's customer service group before, but failed to get the point across.
The Andromeda series is being offered up in two separate DVD ""formats"", if you will... One being in ""volumes"" which contain two episodes on a single DVD and the other being ""collections"" containing four or five episodes on two DVD's.
Amazon has mis-matched these and the listing for ""collection"" number four shows the cover art for ""volume"" four - this is why the episodes don't match.
Since I could not get Amazon Customer Service to acknowledge the problem and tell me which was the collection and which was the volume, I just bought the title at my local Best Buy.
It turned out the collections were cheaper at BB and with no shipping charges.",1068163200,22,1041,4.663043478260869
1844780,3,B00008G8P2,"I certainly agree with Elk Grove Village.  I'm still trying to figure out what to order.  As a fan, couldn't they just sell the entire season like they do with the Star Trek series?  I got a whole season of Star Trek (26 episodes) for $100 and only 22 episodes of Andromeda for about $180 and I didn't buy any duplicates.  Let's just make it simple, Okay?  And maybe drop the price some, Huh?",1063670400,14,392,4.243243243243243

1844782,5,B00008G8P2,"These eposides are a nice midseason touch, especially when the new Trance shows up.  The extras are better than usual and the picture/sound is dead on.  The thing about this set of episodes is you see that the Andromeda will not have and easy future ahead if you read the hints right.  Seeing a basically machine Beka and having a gold Trance show up saying things are not going well tells you that.  There are also even more alliances formed and you see Rommie get more emotions to name a few things.  You have to check out the interview with Laura Bertram, very cool and the bloopers are nice.  Reccomended set for any fan of the show.",1059004800,,637,4.401709401709402
1844783,5,B00008G8P2,"The Editorial Review for this DVD is misleading. The DVD actually contains Season 2, episodes 210 through 214. The Editorial Review alludes to episode 210, ""The Prince,"" but doesn't list it by number. On the copy I got, episodes 210-214 *are* all there.
As for an actual review, if you like Andromeda, and are collecting Andromeda DVDs, this is a must-have. A lot of plotlines pivotal to Season 2 are continued or even completed in this set. I highly recommend it to fans of Andromeda, particularly fans of the first two seasons, where the plot lines were carried over from episode to episode. This is the middle of Season 2, when the show was still getting better and better. For the record, Andromeda has made me a HUGE fan of Keith Hamilton Cobb, who plays Tyr, and I intend to follow his future endeavors closely. What a talent!",1058659200,2,832,4.628378378378378
7982999,2,B00008G8P2,"This show started out fairly good. For the first couple of seasons, I was impressed. By the third season though, things started to make less and less sense. Storylines were disjointed, not clear, and pretty much haphazardly thrown together. As time went on, it seemed the crew as a whole got less attention, with Dylan more in the forefront, even if the storylines associated were nonsense.

At the start of season five, what happened at the end of season four is pretty much scrapped and changed, with flimsy story to back it. By the middle of season five, the ENTIRE plot has a gaping hole large enough to fly the Andromeda ITSELF though. By the END of it, the giant problem from previous seasons is still stalking about, and it's NEVER explained or even really mentioned beyond a passing mention in one scene.

In short, enjoy the first two seasons. After that, just assume it was cancelled. Because by this point in time, it should've been. I sat through it all from the first episode to the last, and I truly wish I hadn't.",1526428800,,1028,4.581521739130435
7983000,5,B00008G8P2,The good science fiction and some very attrative women combined with a marvelous array of CGI made this an excellent series. It was amazing how it seemed the crew button pushing and facial expressions held my attention as if they were really in a fight. Try sp character was extremely interesting and different. The interaction between he and Hunt was very realistic and advanced the quality of the show by a huge amount. i enjoyed the special settings with unique characters such as the gambling casino provided relief from one battle to another battle. It took me a while to adapt to the Kevin Sorbo character but as the series developed he became more real and understandable. The actress who played the mystical enity really had challenge to be believable. I think the writers had some difficulty with coordinating her facial emotions and the lack thereof emotions with her speaking lines. In the end I found myself watching her and intrigued by her the most. Finally the Andromeda AI (Doig?) was incredibly steady and awesomely beautiful- good job. Who could blame Harper wanting to hug her! Speaking of steady my shout outs to the Harper actor.,1525737600,,1150,4.872448979591836
7983001,3,B00008G8P2,"I really enjoyed Andromeda until the 4th season. I understand it is supposed to be a bit cheesy, but by the 4th season it feels like I'm watching a 90s Saturday morning cartoon. Without Tyr's dark pragmatism the show is just a cheese fest.",1525564800,,239,4.454545454545454
7983002,1,B00008G8P2,"Not the best season, but watchable. Low rating is because of amazons practice of offering a series for free on Prime, and then changing it to pay per episode at some random point with no notice. Nothing more than bait and switch.",1525046400,6,229,4.476190476190476

Still good - and of all the SciFi Ships  if you could get one,  you would want to live on this one.  The Characters are well thought out, and work well together.  Harper 2.0 is the best episode of the whole series.  A great series to watch.

7983005,2,B00008G8P2,"This seems to be just a fashion show.  I could have stopped watching after the first season and never missed this show at all.  I find myself starting an episode only to stop it 5 minutes later feeling bored and uninterested.  When I come back to it after a few hours or days I watch another 15 minutes and then just want to quit and never see it again.  There is little that happens other than people walking around a lot talking or standing in this or that room talking.  Or picking a fight for some reason with the same characters who started the episode still standing and the others who are new to the episode ""killed off"".  There are ideas in this show that I really like but the use and implementation of those ideas feel unrealistic and fabricated.  Season 5 has been the worst by far and the new character Doyle just doesn't belong.  I doubt I will ever finish watching this now.",1522713600,,888,4.33939393939394
