8560940,5,B00B1LT15W,"As it says, this is the ORIGINAL version of the Korean movie 'Always'.  I purchased this even though it is a region 3 dvd because I was tired of purchasing edited versions in my quest to find the real thing.  It was also worth it to me to purchase an all-region dvd player because I can't always get the Korean movies that I want to own for my region.  Great purchase and would buy from this seller again.  By the way, the movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen -- great acting by the leads and great character development.  SPOILER -- for those of you who have to have a happy ending, this does not disappoint.  Love it!",1499990400,,631,4.131147540983607
