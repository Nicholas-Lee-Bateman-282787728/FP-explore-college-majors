It starts out great, a guy comes in to become a music teacher. And then when a boy can't afford tuition he volunteers his paycheck for the kids continued education.....and then not even ten minutes later the whole school goes on strike. Bollywood wise, great movie, plot wise, not so much. It's really up to the person on whether or not it's a useful buy.",1376784000,,476,4.482758620689655
8402302,3,B003QHVKVW,"This movie is what I would call confused. There are too many things the filmmaker put on the table & didn't finish, and it was a little confusing in the middle. You're left wondering if they're trying to do a pseudo-documentary or what type of plot they're getting at. Shahid Kapoor comes in late to the film and walks in & out of scenes. He's a teacher, but they show him only in the classroom only once. Most of the movie shows kids being bullied by adults, which for me is a little uncomfortable. This is not a film I keep in my collection.",1337472000,,543,4.230769230769231
