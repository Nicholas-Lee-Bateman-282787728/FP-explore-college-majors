For the first-time viewer, the setup of the Doctor Who series is basic enough: the Doctor is an alien who adventures in time and space in his TARDIS, usually with a human companion or two.  I don't think you need to have seen the series before to enjoy this story, but it does help to know that the Time Lords, the Doctor's own people, have certain rules and responsibilities (sadly, never fully defined) where time travel and knowledge of the future is concerned.

It's the far future and the TARDIS crash-lands on Frontios, a planet only marginally suitable for habitation.  One of the last human colonies is located here, a paranoid society on the verge of collapse as meteor showers attributed to an unknown enemy, lack of resources and dissent take their toll.  Despite his misgivings, the Doctor lets himself be drawn into the colony's problems.  But the true threat, and the answer to a lot of questions, is lurking beneath the planet's surface.

For me, this is one of the best Doctor Who stories I've seen.  The plot's imaginative and well constructed, the script is excellent, the sets are very atmospheric, there's a strong guest cast, and Peter Davison is excellent as an authoritative, slightly manic Doctor.  Tegan is her usual hasty, dumb, compassionate self, but Turlough gets some real development here.  He reasons things out and makes discoveries, unexpectedly reveals information vital to the story's resolution, and faces his fears.  Both Janet Fielding and Mark Strickson do a really good job here.  Also strong are the residents of Frontios: the pompous and rather pathetic Plantagenet, the harsh and authoritarian Brazen, the humane and curious Range and his daughter, the idealistic Norna.  All are rounded characters who make a real contribution to the story, well cast and well acted.

This story raises questions with no easy answers.  In a situation like that on Frontios, what do you do and who do you trust?  How much should people be allowed to know and when should you break the rules?  Amongst all the strengths, though, there are a few weaknesses.  Some of the directing is a bit clumsy; the Gravis is just a generic villain in a funny suit rather than being truly alien; and there seems no reason for him to have heard of the Doctor before.  I don't usually bother with the DVD extras, but the extended/deleted scenes are worth a look here.  They give greater prominence to the character Cockerill, and their inclusion in the final cut would have made the story flow better, I think.",1331596800,8,3090,5.547974413646055
4429235,4,B004MA1K2G,"The TARDIS has travled to the far future in orbit around the planet Frontios. The last planet with humans from distant Earth trying to survive and live.  The Doctor wants to leave since this is a point in time where events on Frontios have to play out. Before he can set new cooridnates the TARDIS is pulled to the surface of the planet without warning.  Once there they encounter the colony and they mistake the Doctor and the others for attackers. For over thirty years the colony has been attacked by bombardments and each time more and more either die or flee into the wastelands.
  The Doctor helps the chief medical officer with the wonded and the dying but with equipment that requires power and even the most basic of needs at short supply he can do very little.  With what aid he could provide he goes back to the TARDIS only to find that it has been destroyed by a new wave of bombardments. The Doctor is schocked for it would take a tremendous amount of power to do such a thing and nothing on Frontios has the power.  He then learns of rumors of things underground and with great power. Can the Doctor find out what is going on or will he be a footnote in the last days of humantiy?",1315958400,,1194,4.331838565022421
4429236,4,B004MA1K2G,"In this one the TARDIS is drawn off course and forced to land on the planet Frontios far in the distant future where the last remnants of the doomed planet Earth have set up their colony. However, the colony is now under threat by attacks from space by an unknown enemy, low morale, lack of supplies, and a strict leadership. As usual the Doctor's arrival only adds to their paranoid suspicions of an invasion from space. But the Doctor believes the threat is much closer to home - underneath the planet itself. Soon the Doctor comes face to face with the powerful subterranean insect race known as the Tractators whom not only threaten the survival of the human race on this planet, but the safety of the entire universe.

A great plot, the acting and directing is brilliant, and for ""Dr. Who"" the special effects were pretty good as well. And even Peter Davison's Doctor is more eccentric than usual. The only let down to this story is a somewhat mediocre ending. But overall it's still a pretty good and enjoyable tale. Highly recommended!",1312329600,2,1042,4.663043478260869
4429237,3,B004MA1K2G,"I always sort of liked this story but I hadn't watched it in about 25 years until I bought this DVD.  The story itself is an adequate example of good TV sci-fi and the in-studio sets for this are actually quite well done.  But as I found out in the extras, it was a rush job that was completed in about four days.  And as I watched it again I could tell that was the case. However part of the charm of the old series was the cheesey special effects and bug-eyed (literally) monsters where the actors who wore the costumes could not manuever very well. But Janet Fielding in that short black skirt....gr-rowll.

There are plenty of ""oops"" scenes in this one due to the rush job. (Spoiler) Even before I knew it was done in four days, I never understood why Turlough seemed to lean over to the rover at the end which resulted in the downfall of one of the characters. Now I know why.  They needed it to make that scene happen.

Most of the better Peter Davison stories have been released on DVD as of 2011 so now all that's left are the also rans like this one. But for fans of the classic series, it's thoroughly enoyable.  If you are a fan of the new series...put this very low on the list of stories you should watch to introduce yourself to the classic series.

The extras are rather scant on the DVD.  There's a ""making of"" documentary which I have already referred to, photo archives, and a few extended/deleted scenes. One of the deleted scenes gave a little back story about why the Fifth Doctor would occasionally wear glasses so that was fun.

I am a collector of the classic series DVD's so I bought it to help fill out my collection.  But there are plenty of other stories to buy if you have never bought one so that you don't feel like you have wasted your money.",1310774400,3,1774,4.281437125748503
4429238,5,B004MA1K2G,"One of the most underrated episodes of the old Doctor Who series. This one harks back to the old gothic themes and atmosphere of the Tom Baker days. There is still one chilling scene which clings to my childhood memories since the first time I've seen it. The scene concerns one of the ill-fated men being dragged into the dirt until he is entirely engulfed by the ground itself as if the earth has grown hungry. How his hand grasp the final remnants of life before he is pulled away. This sets the tone for the rest of the Frontios episode.

The story itself is written by veteran Christopher H. Bidmead who was responsible for script editing very structured stories for Tom Baker's final season. Bidmead made one of the best contributions to the Doctor Who series: bringing the science back to science fiction for Doctor Who. And he does no less for the stand alone show Frontios. And he tells a chilling tale for the last vestiges of the human race who are attacked by something strange: the very planet itself.

I liked how Bidmead wrote a tale of horror as well as science fiction here. How everything feels claustrophobic with the few remaining humans struggling to survive. The underground tunnels seem narrow and dangerous... making a perfect setting for the story. The mood is one of stark terror especially for the mind of a eleven year old who saw this episode for the first time.

Writer Bidmead brings warmth and humor to Peter Davison's fifth Doctor who does seem to be caught with the tagline ""the vet in space"" considering his stint on All Creatures Great and Small. However, Davison does capture the idea of an older man being trapped in a younger body. The fifth Doctor wears spectacles in this episode and he seems to feel ragged some of the time... as if he is easily exhausted. And yet the fifth Doctor can have sudden bursts of creative ingenuity. This is one of Davison's best performances here.

There are no real villains in the story. There are just misunderstood people on both sides of the aisle. Which makes for interesting storytelling because of several points of views. The thick headed Brazen comes to his senses in the last moments of his life. The Tractators are a race of creatures bent on their own greed. Some of the other highlights of the story includes Turlough's own mental breakdown and the TARDIS being ""destroyed,"" leaving the Doctor at the mercy of using his wits to get out of this dire situation. The Doctor relying on his own smarts makes the story far more interesting.

For the story, the Tractators seem to be very clunky, awkward looking creatures that some of today's viewers may make fun of. Perhaps all viewers might think when they see this is ""Rubber monster!"" Bt I disagree. In my mind, I think they're still one of the most facinating creatures created for the series. Simply because not all Tractators were bad guys. And they were in need of searching for a new home. I suppose anyone could relate to this sentiment. Frontios is the only story in which the Tractators appear in. Which is too bad because they're one of the best realized monsters in the Doctor Who series.

It's well directed by Ron Jones with a movie quality pacing. Frontios remains one of the most underrated stories in the series. It is in my mind one of the best entries for the Peter Davison period.",1306022400,17,3332,4.629441624365482
4429239,4,B004MA1K2G,"1 disc, 98 minutes, 4 episodes, full frame video, English mono audio, English subtitles.

An irresistible force draws the TARDIS to the barren surface of Frontios, where in the far future the last surviving humans cower amongst the ruins of their wrecked spacecraft. Under constant threat from lethal meteorite bombardments, few of the doomed colony members realize that the ground of Frontios itself opens up and devours the unwary. Not permitted to assist, the Doctor attempts to leave, but is thwarted when the unimaginable occurs: the TARDIS is utterly destroyed. All the while, burrowing undetected below the planet's crust, sickening alien parasites prepare a gruesome and final fate for all humanity.

4429241,4,B004MA1K2G,"A good story overall but it was damaged by cuts to trim the running time. The cuts led to several discontinuities in the story when broadcast. It was too bad that they couldn't have done this as a 5 parter then it could have been one of the must-see classic Doctor Who stories. Still, this is a good story and worth watching even though you have to assume and guess at a few things which would have been explained if the cuts weren't done.",1448496000,,439,4.238095238095238

4429245,4,B004MA1K2G,"This story is stunning in that everything seems to be so much better. This TARDIS crew, written and acted as they are here are very entertaining in a way they haven't been for most of Davison's run. Davison turned in his best performance to date as the Doctor and Mark Strickson was on his top game as Turlough. The setting was atmospheric and chilling, and became claustrophobic as the story wore on and nearly everyone in it ended up in this tunnel.  The plot is solid and the villains have got a typical who villain plan.

There are things to complain about particularly in regards to effects and a few of the performances. Still, this is one of the most solid stories of the Davison era.",1424563200,,691,4.476190476190476

If you are a fan of the series and don't want to resort to buying region 2 DVD's and possible DVD player (though this is honestly a LOT cheaper than buying some of the DW DVD's region 1) then you need to pick this up while you have the opportunity. Especially for under $20 as I write this review of the product.

This is during the final season of Peter Davison playing the Fifth Doctor. While his first two seasons are spotty, for the most part, his final season on the show is much better. He's given a better quality of script to work with compared to previous seasons. He takes on a darker tone for some of his personality and just seems to be in his groove. This story takes place on the planet of Frontios, where a group of the last humans (this tends to repeat all throughout classic Who) have survived for the past 30 odd years on the planet surface. Lately there has been a lot of meteor strikes and the people tend to believe the attack is coming from another world while they really should be looking at the ground below for their woes. I personally like this serial and, though the monsters are hokey in this story, I still didn't find it taking away from the overall enjoyment of the episodes as a whole. It was an interesting hivemind development and the ending of episode 3 was incredibly dark and creepy simply for that ""look"" (you'll know what I'm talking about when you watch).

I have been going through all the Davison era episodes to figure out which to add to my collection and, personally speaking, I am happy to have Frontios in my collection. It's a Sci-Fi survival/pioneering type episode that I think does a good job of creating sufficient enough tension throughout its run.",1483488000,,1847,4.39766081871345
