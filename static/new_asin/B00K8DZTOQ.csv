8656799,1,B00K8DZTOQ,"I followed the instructions for exercises - precisely for 2 weeks which, for me, resulted in an extremely painful lower back (lumbar 4-5) that has persisted for a month and resulted in the need for professional physical therapy. If you naturally tend to tuck your bottom under and try to change to ""sticking your bottom out"" you may experience back pain. Use with caution.",1464652800,,372,4.828125

8656801,5,B00K8DZTOQ,"I've struggled with prolapse for about 10 years.  Initially I went down the path of Katy Bowman & alignment.  It was alot of ""work"" in terms of body awareness & stretching & only took me so far.  I also focused on walking everyday & not sitting too much which became very thought- consuming.  Over the years, I realized that there was an issue with my breath which had to be addressed.  I bought Julie's dvd hoping that she could help.  When I 1st listened & did what she said, it didn't help & even seemed worse so I put it aside.  However I kept searchng & reading.  I corresponded a bit with Julie on her facebook page & realized that she is very confident in her method so I gave it another try.  At that point, I had an ""aha"" moment & realized that I never fully lowered my pelvic floor on inhale.  I imagine this is true for many women.  It took quite a long time to overcome this habit as it was deeply ingrained.  Fortunately I've gotten to a point where I almost never feel my prolapse.  I still ""grip"" my pelvic floor from time to time but when that habits, I take a minute & work on my breath.  Improving the state of your pelvic floor can be quite challenging as it's not always so straightforward but persevere!  You will be happy that you did.",1442620800,2,1257,4.222689075630252
8656802,5,B00K8DZTOQ,"Great foundation to build on for all exercise and activity. The video is slow enough for anyone to grasp the basics and it follows up each section with suggestions on how to progress your strength when you have mastered an aspect of coordination of the team ""core"" - pelvic, diaphragm and back. This is great stuff with a new edge that makes it much more effective and applicable than the ""just do a lot of keagles"" that you hear. I in the medical field and loved this, but it also caters to all women, regardless of background and experience.",1426896000,3,543,4.494949494949495

8656804,5,B00K8DZTOQ,"This video is so helpful. i found that just properly aligning my pelvic floor when setting up for my golf swing improved my game! she is clear in her explanations and demonstrations of the proper way to do the exercises and to maintain proper alignment. I thought pelvic floor was only important for bladder control as I age and found that it is essential for breathing thus it is essential for my overall health and well being. I highly recommend this video for anyone of any age (men and women!) interested in their overall health...in other words this is not just for those of us who have had several children, over 40 and in need of developing bladder control. i wish I would have know about these exercises and positions during that time in my life. Thanks Julie!",1413504000,7,768,4.572463768115942
8656805,5,B00K8DZTOQ,"This DVD is great for all women but particularly women post partum, women who do high impact exercise like running and women who have occasional leaks when they sneeze, laugh or jump. As a pilates instructor with a history of pelvic floor issues of my own I appreciate the attention to alignment and breathing and the creative imagery and techniques she uses to help find alignment and use muscles that are sometimes hard to identify. While I love the detailed instruction I want to emphasize that you do not need any special training to benefit from the Pelvic Floor Piston- foundation for Fitness! It is easy to understand and easy to see and feel in your own body. Most importantly-- applying this concept works to strengthen the way you coordinate movement so that you have a healthier, more functional core and especially pelvic floor. The DVD is set up in several segments allowing viewers to progress at their own rate! Integrating these concepts into your daily movement is a major focus. There is even a ""choose your posture"" section that allows viewers to proceed to the section relevant to their posture based on an assessment. As a fitness instructor, I found that the assessments help me help my students achieve better alignment to make any exercise more effective. I recommend this DVD to my students (and friends) who have occasional leaks.",1410998400,14,1356,4.874458874458875
8656806,3,B00K8DZTOQ,Just okay. Not worth the money in my opinion. There are a lot better pelvic floor dvd's out there. I like the Hab it pelvic floor dvd by physical therapist Tasha Mulligan.,1409961600,4,171,4.375
8656807,5,B00K8DZTOQ,"Julie Wiebe's pelvic floor piston webinar made a big difference in my body and I'm really happy I found it. The umbrella breath she teaches was worth the price of the webinar for me, because I never felt like I could take a full deep breath until I learned how to use my diaphragm. Using that breath and noticing my pelvic floor has kept my back limber for several months now. It's so comforting to know that when my back feels tight, I can use breathing to relax my muscles back into alignment that feels good.

I used to clench all my pelvic floor muscles to hold my body steady, and physical therapy helped me untangle those knots, but I was still unsure how to use my muscles properly. Plus physical therapy is a three hour round trip deal for me, so I couldn't progress as quickly as I wanted to. In this DVD, Julie teaches an easy way to re-train the pelvic floor/diaphragm system and the brain and I'm so excited to feel it working. I love noticing how I feel stable while my body is moving and breathing. And as Julie says, every time I use the umbrella breath and bean lift, I'm creating an anchor to remind my body to use this system when I move.

I cannot say enough good things about this DVD! Julie teaches every step simply with visuals that make sense and she gives bite-sized homework so it feels like you're not doing much at all, but it makes a big difference in your body. Personally, this DVD put all of my physical therapy into perspective and now I understand better the goal I'm working toward. I had such a difficult time learning not to clench my pelvic floor muscles, but I was scared to try strengthening them because of my old habits. But Julie taught a new way that's easier and doesn't even resemble the crazy kegels I use to do too many of. It's a powerful feeling to know that I'm learning exactly what my physical therapist was coaching me toward, for a $30 investment. Also, I'm not one to watch stuff over and over again, but I love going back and watching Julie's sections again and making sure I'm not missing steps. She's very likeable, positive, and encouraging. Julie, thank you so much for creating this DVD!",1401148800,25,2149,4.410579345088161
8656808,5,B00K8DZTOQ,"Julie does a fantastic job of using evidence based practice, and making it understandable and available to those suffering with pelvic dysfunction, and those seeking to further their education on the subject.  Julie provides great visual and verbal reminders to remember the techniques, and also provides clinical evidence of before and after photos.  I really enjoy her DVD as well as her website to incorporate these techniques into my practice.  Every athlete, patient, client, student, & teacher can integrate these concepts into their lifestyles, its so simple and so effective!  Thanks Julie!",1401062400,10,598,5.467391304347826
