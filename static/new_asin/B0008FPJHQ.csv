2258751,1,B0008FPJHQ,"If I didn't know any better Funimation productions was out to tarnish the outlandishly popular Anime series ""Dragon Ball/Z; they've already managed to fail miserably with this series in Video games (Budokai II and III is an exception) And now thy're redubbing the first season of Dragon Ball Z, and its movies ""The Dead Zone"" - ""The worlds strongest"" - and ""Tree of Might"" (all of which are released on Poineer video and are completely uncut already) possibly up until they reach the Freiza saga, where they had completely changed the voices.

I would've congratulated this company for releasing the first season of ""DBZ UNCUT"" but for the love of all that is good on this earth, why did they have to RE-DUB the series entirely? Yes, its a nice added plus that they added the original Mono Japanese audio, which isn't my favorite unless their a poor job done in the voice acting department in other series (Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Ronin Warriors, Sailor Moon/R [and their three movies], ROD THE TV, aren't any of them). But to redub DBZ and redubing the almost bearable music with rock(?) is going over the edge of a VERY HIGH CLIFF. Despite what everyone has been saying, Canada's OCEAN GROUP did a darn well good job in the voice-acting department for DBZ. While in some series they can mess up, the OCEAN GROUP does not disappoint in the areas of talent when they've got a good director and script (and maybe even money).

Scott McNeil (Duo Maxwell [Gundam Wing], Rattrap [Beast wars/machines]-) was a great Piccolo and far better than Christopher Sabat who isn't bad, but he doesn't have that quirk about him when he's voice acting for Piccolo. Ian Corlett (Cheetor from ""Beast Wars/machines"") is not a bad Son Goku, although I won't bite my tongue when I say Sean Schemmel is better in characterizing Son Goku in ways. Lalainia Lindbjerg (Bluma), Ted Cole (Yamcha), Lisa Ann Beley (Chi-Chi), Matthew Smith (Tien; only because I loved the line he said: ""Swine, barbaric swine,"" or something in that order), Terry Klassen (Krillin), Saffron Henderson (Gohan), Peter Kelamis (Son Goku), Brian Drummond (Vegeta/Yajirobe), Pauline Newstone (Freiza), and Cathy Weseluck (Chiaotzu), weren't bad in the voice acting department for their characters either.

In short I don't mind the words UNCUT in DBZ's first season, however, I do mind the fact they've changed practically everything that was familiar to me and then named the DVD ""Dragon Ball Z - Vegeta Saga 1 - Piccolo's Plan."" WHEN in reality Vegeta doesn't come until after Goku and Piccolo (depending on how you look at it) defeat Raditz, the Z-fighters begin training while Piccolo is teaching Gohan to become a warrior and Goku is traveling snake way to get to King-Kai's planet. Only after the episode when Nappa and Vegeta arrive then maybe you can call it a Vegata saga. But in reality you should really call this ""The SAIYAN SAGA"" instead because afterward the next saga is the Namek/Freiza saga.

No, the music for the series wasn't great but at least it was bearable (save for the theme song ""call the dragon"" --- that wasn't very good either but at least is better than the once current DBZ theme song which is nothing but rock) and not guitar rifts all the way like DBGT. Another thing I don't like is this supposed added blood. As if DBZ needed added blood that wasn't in the original footage before; FUNImation acts like its one of those over the top Bloody Japanese cartoons like Ghost in the Shell or Vampire Hunter D. All in all this DVD is a major disappointment for me. had they had kept the original dub and added the Japanese dub along with the cut scenes I would gladly purchase this. Sadly I can just rent it so that's all I can recommend this to you as: A rental and nothing more.",1116028800,3,3760,4.718417047184171

8056001,5,B0008FPJHQ,I gotta get this!,1418947200,,17,3.5
8056002,5,B0008FPJHQ,OK this DVD is great. Reasons I don't like this is because it doesn't keep the English dub with the Japanese soundtrack. I like this because of the voice acting and the full screen or 4:3. I recommend this to lovers of the English soundtrack.,1357776000,,242,4.4
8056003,5,B0008FPJHQ,In the secoud volume of the Dragon Ball Z Ultimate Uncuts series Goku and Piccolo keep on fighting Raditz but nothing seems to work. After a attack from Raditz Gohan is shocked and unleashes a extremly powerful attack at Radtiz knocking him out for just a while but then knocks out Gohan. Goku and Piccolo come up with a plan to use Piccolos spiceal beam cannon attack to kill Raditz. After a faluire attemp Goku must sacrfice his life to safe the earth. It was so cool and kinda sick when the special beam cannon attack went through Raditz beacuse he coughed up alot of blood. Anyway Raditz tells Piccolo that 2 more syains are coming to earth in one year to dystroy it. Piccolo decides to take Gohan with him to train and become stronger to defeat the sayians once they come. This was a really cool Dvd but it was kinda sad to see Goku die. Anyway good buy to add to your ultimate uncuts box set if you have one.,1145145600,,914,4.289017341040463
8056004,5,B0008FPJHQ,"First off,this DVD is much better in presentation than the first one. The image is more consistent and there are a lot of fight scenes. It's a shame that it only has three episodes. Now for the audio, there are three options:spanish,japanese and, english. Up till now I've only heard the japanese track and it's okay. The english language track has stereo and 5.1 surround sound. This time around there are two menus: english and, suprisinly spanish. The only other thing that bothers me is that it doesn't have any special features like the featurrete from the first one. Thank god that it still as the trivia game. I'll make my review of vol. 3 as soon as I get it. Up till next time, i'm off !@!!",1143072000,,699,4.46875
8056005,5,B0008FPJHQ,"A very good dvd, these uncute dvd's are mutch better then the old one's, the only thing i don't like is 3 episodes on 1 dvd.",1127520000,,124,3.8076923076923075
8056006,5,B0008FPJHQ,"That's pretty much what this DVD is.  The script is more closer to the original this time.  And yeah, P Hardy is a baka, big time.  The quality is above the editted Arival DVD, but still many steps below Dragon Box quality.  Since this DVD is mostly screaming and fighting the script can't get any closer to the original.  However the 2nd to last scene (right before Kuririn talks to Son Goku) was still inaccurate.  They didn't start thinking about being young forever and keeping Raditz in the Other World until they were about to enter their spaceships.  What they were originally thinking about is Gohan's battle power.  Then Vegeta fiqured it out himself.  ""When Saiyans mate with humans our offspring gain the strength of a human and a saiyan, making it...""- Vegeta, ""...A super Saiyan""-Nappa.  Or something like that.

The featres have been chopped down to DBZ Trivia and trailers.  *sob*

Simmons, once again makes excellent translations.  We need more translators like him in the anime world!  Like I said last time the name Double Sunday is just a dub addition, probably because FUNImation can't have their actors say ""Rot in Hell!!!"".  (They say it all the time in FullMetal Alchemist...).

The trivia is much easier than last time, and the clips are a little less exciting.",1121990400,,1285,4.821100917431193
8056007,4,B0008FPJHQ,"First off all the blood and stuff added into the uncut DBZ was in the original.  I am stationed in Japan and have seen the original.  Just like in Gundam Wing when it was eddited they changed all words and taken out the blood.  Its nice to see DBZ the way its meant to be seen.  Hopefully they will add all the uncut stuff to the rest of the DBZ series.  I think its great that they have consistant voice actors and stuff.  And the movies where uncut to a certain point but they where still missing a lot of stuff that was in the original.  Which will make the movies a lot better just like when Gundam Wing Endless Waltz was realesed unedited it was great, it was really sad to see the carnege on cartoon network when they played endless waltz on it.  I think Funimation is on the right track.",1120089600,2,794,4.143790849673203
