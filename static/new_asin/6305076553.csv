963242,5,6305076553,"I watched this Thanksgiving themed movie in the 1970s with my then elementary aged daughter and we loved it!  I looked for it for many years before finding it on Amazon.  Although we have to be satisfied with a VHS version, we were both thrilled to sit together and watch it again after all of these years.  It a charming, timeless story with a wonderful message of kindness and generosity. The ""Holiday Treasure"" should be a must see movie for all families.  Thanks to Amazon, we were able to enjoy it again!",1225497600,5,509,4.5
963243,5,6305076553,"FINALLY... The House Without A Christmas Tree is available on DVD.  I'm very happy to have one on order.  I might order a few more to show to my little grandsons someday.  My all-time favorite though is ""A Thanksgiving/Holiday Treasure"".  I searched for YEARS under ""The Thanksgiving Treasure"" and SOMEHOW found the title had changed.  I questioned my memory but was relieved to read that the title had been changed.  Don't do this to our aging minds!  This Thanksgiving movie is something that should be shown on TV EVERY YEAR to sensitize the younger generation to the elderly.  We need a lot more of these movies on the kids' channels - a LOT more.  My girls enjoyed these types of movies in the 70's and now that they are becoming mothers, are reminicsing about them.  These two movies are (as one reviewer described) a window into the past.  I feel as though I am in my grandmother's house everytime I watch them!",1189900800,13,918,4.604938271604938
963244,5,6305076553,"In this sequel to THE HOUSE WITHOUT A CHRISTMAS TREE, it is 1947 and heroine Addie Mills, who is being raised by her widower father and his mother, befriends a horse while she is out collecting items for an autumn bouquet for her teacher. Unfortunately, the horse belongs to a crusty old codger named Walter Rhenquist, who hates Addie's dad because a pond James Mills dug for him leaked (James had warned him it was a bad place to put a pond, but he wouldn't listen). When Addie's teacher tells the class a story about the Pilgrims befriending the Indians, she decides to befriend her dad's enemy by bringing him Thanksgiving dinner. A new friendship is the surprising result.

This is a slow-moving but wonderfully nostalgic story that looks so authentic you would swear you were peeking into a window at 1947. The children's radio play is so true to the period! The cinematography is also wonderful and Arthur Rubenstein's score complements the action perfectly. Lisa Lucas, Jason Robards, Mildred Natwick and Barnard Hughes as Rhenquist are all splendid.

Note: On television this story was called THE THANKSGIVING TREASURE. CBS changed the title so they could sell it with the Christmas videos.",1159228800,21,1198,4.925742574257426
963245,5,6305076553,"I adore the Addie Mills specials and wish they would be shown on television again after all these years. These wholesome programs stand the test of time and are so warm, poignant, and worthwhile. The Holiday Treasure is one of the best Thanksgiving specials I've ever seen and am pleased to now own a copy, along with the other two Addie Mills television programs. The ensemble is phenomenal and the storyline very touching. It just doesn't get much better than this. Television programmers, are you reading this???",1124841600,17,515,4.931034482758621
963246,5,6305076553,"Introduce this compelling classic to your loved ones this Thanksgiving and they'll never forget it.  Broadway veteran Barnard Hughes adds another dimension to the already great ensemble of Jason Robards, Mildred Natwick, and Lisa Lucas.  Hughes, only in his fifties at the time, made a specialty of playing ""old codgers"" with delightful results!  Incidentally, the moustache worn by Jason Robards was to hide a scar on his upper lip after an auto accident.  In the equally great previous production, ""The House Without A Christmas Tree"", he is clean-shaven.

UPDATE: At last this will see a DVD release on 11/4/2014 as The Thanksgiving Treasure (its original TV title) in a set together with The House Without a Christmas Tree.  No need to buy a costly VHS anymore!",1099008000,26,765,5.031746031746032
963247,5,6305076553,I well remember being a young child and looking forward to the movie on TV every year.  Jason Robards has always been one of my favorite actors and Mildred Natwick is an adorable Grandmother.  Young Addie brings much reality to the way many children would react in similar circumstances.  An excellent choice for a movie as well as the other movies with the same cast.,1080172800,14,368,4.630769230769231
963248,5,6305076553,"I remember watching this and ""The House Without  A Christmas Tree""  when I was a little girl and it holds wonderful memories!  I am a teacher now.  I ran across  ""The Thanksgiving Treasure"" book and read it to my class. They loved it and I am excited to share the movie with them after we finish the book before Thanksgiving. -Too bad they don't show these movies on regular T.V. anymore!",1069286400,33,388,4.408450704225352

963250,5,6305076553,(...) i am 50 years old and just can't get enough of this movie. its music brings floods of memories and i feel like i am addie. i can't believe cbs has not shown it since 1983. i believe america needs more and more of these programs to offer our children before they are lost forever.,1005091200,14,285,4.107142857142857
963251,5,6305076553,"I was so glad to find this video. I read both this book and ""House"" to my students each year.  I have wanted to get this video for the past 5 years....not knowing that the title had been changed from ""The Thanksgiving Treasure"" to ""The Holiday Treasure"".  I am so glad to have finally found it!!  I ordered immediately.  I grew up with Addie books and movies and am thrilled to have the video again.  I recommend this for anyone who remembers these books and movies from their childhood.  Gail Rock is a super author.

7882622,5,6305076553,Thank you for quick shipping.  I have hunted for this product for a while for my sister.  She loves this family and the video made her day.,1386115200,,139,4.111111111111111
7882623,5,6305076553,"This movie has been a treasure for our family for years!  We watch it every Thanksgiving and it brings tears to our eyes every time. Superb acting from some of the greatest actors of any generation. The love formed between the old hard-crusted codger and Addie unfolds so beautifully.  I love the fact that it is shot like a theatrical play, very realistic and simply staged. It will warm your heart and leaves you with the spirit of kindness and giving. I have been looking for a DVD version for years to no avail. Does anyone have it in that format?",1385769600,,551,4.445544554455446
7882624,5,6305076553,"I can't believe I found this video for sale. I hadn't seen it since it first aired, and if it weren't for my sister really wanting it for Xmas I wouldn't have looked for it, because I didn't think I'd find it anywhere.  So thanks, Amazon and the seller I dealt with.

If you saw ""The House Without a Xmas Tree"", which is pretty available here and there, this was one of the 3 or 4 seasonal tv movies about the same family - bespectacled Addie Mills, her widowed father, and grandma superbly played by Mildred Natwick. These were made in the 1970's from Gail Rock's books that I recommend for all ages.

This is their Thanksgiving story which, like all of them, takes place in Nebraska in the 1940's. Addie's father (Jason Robards, perfectly picked for the role) is at odds with an old man who he did some work for and did not get paid.  When Addie hears in school that Thanksgiving means breaking bread with enemies as well as friends, she sneaks parts of her Thanksgiving dinner to take to the old man, under the eye of a watchful bratty cousin. Addie and best friend Cora Beth, who contributed to the meal, rode their bikes out to the old man's farm and gave him a wonderful Thanksgiving dinner. Addie becomes friends with the man, and she goes out to his farm regularly to take care of his horse and ride him. When death touches Addie's life, the family learns a rich life lesson that could do all of us some good.(Their Easter movie is still available on vhs as well!)",1384128000,,1472,4.380952380952381
7882625,5,6305076553,"Back in the early 70s when we didn't have 300 channels there were programs of real quality that would be aired one time and were forgotten. Many times they were part of the ""hallmark hall of fame"".This was part of a trilogy that started
With ""the house without a Christmas Tree"" and ended with an Easter edition. The acting in these stories was superb.
Jason Robards was scary as the cranky father and Mildred Natwick was everyone's grandmother. This movie was originally called ""The Thanksgiving Treasure"". This kind of tv is not produced anymore. Sad to say.
I'm glad I was able to find even a VHS copy as this is a hard item to locate. Good Luck!",1372118400,,649,4.508474576271187
7882626,5,6305076553,A wonderful heartwarming storey of a young girl's desire to help others and her animal friend. Title: Holiday Treasure.is a video worth retaining in your video library.,1359331200,,168,5.2592592592592595
7882627,5,6305076553,"I absolutely love this movie. I have watched it many times during the holidays. If it doesn't remind you of what the true meaning of Thanksgiving really is well, I just don't know what will. I just wish it would be made into a DVD format. Don't hesitate to buy this video and enjoy it with your family.",1313884800,,302,4.224137931034483
7882628,5,6305076553,Would someone PLEASE make a DVD version of this classic film?  This is unquestionably one of the BEST movies you can get for your family to watch over the holidays.  A very touching film.  My compliments to the director and actors!!!,1290470400,8,233,4.634146341463414
