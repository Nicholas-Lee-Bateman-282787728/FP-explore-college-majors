8410153,2,B00186DF3Y,"While it might be nice to watch ANY Rick Wakeman video, this is about the lowest quality one should stoop to.  The video's visual quality is adequate, and does not suffer from over-production.  As for the audio? A sad excuse.  It's old style lo-fi mono; poor tv sound.  And to add insult to injury, it comes with a CD!  Unlistenable without the video.  For completists only.",1302998400,2,374,4.590909090909091
8410154,1,B00186DF3Y,Es FENOMENAL que tard esperando el DVD como 3 meses y nunca se me envi a pesar de que mencionan que hay 5 disponibles. Es un gancho para comprar cualquier otra cosa y no enviar lo que realmente vale la pena.,1302825600,,207,4.073170731707317
