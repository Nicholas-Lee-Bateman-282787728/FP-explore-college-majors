8709486,4,B00V7ORXGC,"A pity that the English translation has never happened, but the sub-titles allowed me to follow the story well enough.  Saito and Louisa combine to oppose a Royal whose boredom is such that he starts a war to see if that will keep him interested.  They simultaneously have to fight off Louisa's rivals for Saito's hand - and other parts - from young noblewomen, a servant maid, an elf maid, and their own queen!  Very Enjoyable!",1451347200,,428,4.605263157894737
