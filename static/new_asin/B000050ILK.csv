8194796,4,B000050ILK,"Similar in many respects to Masked Avengers, the weapon of choice here is the spear and its variations, ie short spears, long spears, flag spears, etc.  In Masked Avengers, the trident was the featured weapon.  Also, as in Masked Avengers, this is a bloodier gorier Venom flick.  Also, as in Masked Avengers, the plot is rather convoluted (does it matter?) and Lo Meng and Sun Chien are nowhere to be seen (though they are listed on the box).  The fighting, under Chang Cheh's masterful direction and camera work, is mind boggling and nearly every conceivable ""spear move"" is explored.  Hand to hand fighting is sparse.  I'm not a big-time spear fan, therefore I was not thrilled enough to give this a 5, but the movie nonetheless is a solid entry into your Venom collection.",993254400,4,775,4.746268656716418
