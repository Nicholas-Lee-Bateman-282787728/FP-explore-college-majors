3660019,5,B001JV5B08,"Two Reviews- Read Both
This movie is a....
1.  Feel-good story of underdog local team making the championship, with the zany but gold-hearted unorthodox coach giving life lessons on the way to winning.
But, it is also...
2. Utterly insane; beyond-the-pale.  Almost every scene presenting some epic moment of high school purgatory, angst, or humiliation.  Virtually all of  which are nervously close to unlawful behavior anytime after middle school.  Squirm away, it keeps up til the very end.

And if you're not laughing the entire movie, you were lazy and should have watched a trailer, read a review, and known what you were in for.

It's raw.  It's coarse.  Dangerously licentious.  But every bit of it captures some part of high school hell, but maybe how we wished the world was.  We get it played out with the weird tennis kids & psycho coach consistently stomping their mojo on football players, teachers, and other teams, giving a big finger in the eye to the bullying.

It's exceptionally funny.

There you go. Two honest reviews in one. Proceed at your own comedic sensitivities (or peril).",1437955200,,1100,4.913043478260869

3660050,5,B001JV5B08,"If you didn't like American Pie you won't like this. It's as simple as that. If you like this genre then this is a don't miss movie. Yes there are a few spots that could have been written better but I've seen it 2-3 times and it has me laughing the whole time. Great movie for what it is.

Added: This show is pretty raunchy so if that isn't your cup of tea avoid this movie. Wanted to add this as I saw it again recently and that did stand out. Still if you like raunchy this is a pretty funny show.",1394323200,,500,3.9019607843137254
3660051,5,B001JV5B08,"This movie doesn't break any new ground in cinematography.  It is totally stupid, but I found it to be hilarious.  There are a lot of subtle things in the plot and dialog that are outrageous.  If you are a fan of Seann William Scott, this will probably satisfy.  Just don't expect too much, and let the art wash over you.",1381536000,,321,4.3
3660052,4,B001JV5B08,"This was actually a pretty good movie. The provocative title of ""balls out..."" caught my eye. Gary is a good guy - very intense -- but a decent soul with a strong commitment to his game/work. It also features a great scene of Sean running around in just a jockstrap, and yes, he has a very nice bubble butt.",1375401600,,307,4.220338983050848

3660054,1,B001JV5B08,"I had high hopes for Balls Out. It's from the same team that did Dude Where's My Car and the first Harold & Kumar movie. Seann William Scott stars and he's usually pretty funny, I thought maybe this would be kind of like Happy Gilmore, I couldn't have been more wrong. Different people have different opinions on what's funny and what's not, but I really don't see how any sane person could like this s***! It's far past ridiculous and it's just as stupid as it gets. Scott's constant whining and narrating to himself is unbearable, but at least his character had a personality. The supporting cast was pretty much brain dead. Why anyone would want to produce this, is beyond me, seldom have I seen something this horrible!",1361577600,,723,4.612403100775194

3660081,4,B001JV5B08,"Balls out: Gary the Tennis Coach, is the perfect kind of gross out comedy that gets better with repeated viewings.  At first it might be a little off putting, but once you get the movie's vibe, it's easy to go with.  One potential problem is the character of Gary, played by Sean William Scott, who comes off as almost psychotic in some parts; this is one of those movies, like Cable Guy, that is centered around an unstable lead.  Also, the plot, what there is of it, is the usual sports underdogs and losers trying to become champions cliche we've seen many times, but this is no Mighty Ducks, there is plenty of bathroom humor (taking a dump and puking), really dirty talk (a very foul mouthed little girl), racist jokes (directed at Asians), and plenty of good old bad taste. If you're easily offended, then consider yourself warned. I think this is the perfect movie when you want to do nothing more than kick back and laugh at the same dumb joke over and over.  If you are a Randy Quaid fan, you may be disappointed, as his role is relatively brief; is this the last movie he made before going cuckoo for coco puffs?  To sum up: Balls Out: Gary the Tennis Coach is not quite in the league with Caddy Shack or Happy Gilmore, but it comes close enough, and I wouldn't be surprised if doesn't develop a cult of its own in the future.",1310342400,2,1336,4.370967741935484
3660082,4,B001JV5B08,so i was bored one day and decided to pick up some random silly movie at blockbuster to spend the night. i like tennis so i thought im going to enjoy this. i had low expectations but in the end it was a funny movie and a good 80 or 90 so minutes spent. don't pass it up grab a beer with the guys and watch this and share a few laughs,1309564800,,333,3.638888888888889

3660084,4,B001JV5B08,"I expected this straight-to-video film to only have a few decent laughs amid a sea of fart jokes and cheesy pop-culture references . . . and I was pleasantly surprised to be dead wrong! While it's not a brilliant movie by any stretch of the imagination, the offensive and raunchy humor is smartly written, and the director and editor have a wonderful sense of timing. I laughed all the way through it, and would compare it to Kingpin or the better American Pie movies. If you're in the mood for some good base humor, Balls Out is well worth checking out.",1294704000,2,554,4.4950495049504955

3660086,4,B001JV5B08,"This was a very funny movie about a janitor named Gary Houseman who helps coach a Tennis team who haven't won a game in a long time. Gary has very funny and unorthodox ways of helping his team. There were some hilarious secondary characters like the laughing grandpa, and the 8-year-old named Amy who is pregnant and needs money for an abortion. Will Gary lead the team to victory? I highly recommend BALLS OUT: GARY THE TENNIS COACH!!!",1248825600,7,436,4.602564102564102
3660127,2,B001JV5B08,"This film was really 2.5 stars, to be fair. I feel that a better script could have helped here, and the pacing was quite clunky. Stiffler was as ever Stiffler and I found his character rather endearing, I actually cared what happended to the team. And to be fair, he wasn't a bad coach, he knew the game and had a fair understanding of what makes people tick, but a rather unconventional way of realising that dream. The acting really was ok, just let down by a poor script and direction.

I wouldnt NOT recommend this film, I would just recommend better gross out comedies than this. If you have see all the usual ones, and have 90 mins to kill, you could do worse than this. Alternatively you could spend the time cleaning your guttering, its your choice.",1247443200,,757,4.446043165467626

3660129,5,B001JV5B08,"OK. If you like stupid humor and enjoy movies like Kingpin, Something About Mary, Along Came Polly, Super Troopers, Waiting, Role Models, 40 Year Old Virgin, etc. I think you will appreciate this movie. You probably need to play or at least understand the game of tennis to appreciate some of the humor, but Stiffler is simply hilarious to me. Randy Quaid is also great in this. Unfortunately he has a minor part.",1245369600,3,413,4.671232876712328
3660130,1,B001JV5B08,"The movie description said that this was a new movie.  The movie I received was not new.  It was like new but the stickers that all new movies have on them was removed.

3660131,2,B001JV5B08,"Gary (Sean William Scott) is a complete imbecile - think Joe Dirt with a tennis fetish.  He even ends up as a janitor; excuse me, custodial engineer like Mr. Dir'te.  What he lacks, however, is the Joe Dirt mantra, ""Life's a garden, dig it.""

15-Love (Promising, albeit undeveloped start)

Born into a tennis family but never really given a chance to nurture the talent because of a psychologically abusive father, Gary yearns for on-court success.  Throughout his early life he faces constant failure.  When he realizes his life on the pathetic, amateur, Mexican tennis league is leading nowhere, he finally gives up the boyhood dream.  From there he ends up huffing paint, but quickly rebounds to being a school janitor.

30-Love (Here comes the craziness)

After buying an RV, he meets up with a sad-sack, high school tennis team led by apathetic Randy Quaid.  When Quaid bites the bullet, it's up to Ryan to take over (you recognize this formula because it's the same one from Bad News Bears, Might Ducks, Varsity Blues, etc.).

30-15 (Yawn)

Puke/purge joke.  Butt joke.  Butt in jock strap.  Kids scared of tennis balls being hit by tennis balls to overcome fear (ahem, Goldberg, Mighty Ducks), tennis jargon nobody recognizes.

30-30 (Cringe-worthy)

Ahhh...here comes the strippers, booze, hot Spanish teacher, classic Stiffler behaviorism, disgusting dog behavior, and the most foul-mouthed little girl in cinema history.  Actually, the little girl (Ryan Simpkins) steals every scene with her delusional, hypochondriac routine about drugs, hookers, AIDS, and abortions.  It's over the top crass, ridiculous, and disturbingly funny.

40-30 (Exactly what I expected)

Wow, does it ever get predictable and boring.  The younger actors unfortunately get more screen time.  A few teenage sap scenes.  A horribly unfunny scene of an Indian themed hallucination.  Predictable is good as long as it's funny.

40-40 (Deuce - disappointingly boring)

I bet you can't guess who wins the state championships!

40-Advantage (As if you didn't see it coming)

What the F did that little girl say?  Apparently, she has all the aforementioned problems, but also suffers from fecalogical Tourettes.  Her line will make 99% of viewers gasp, and some snicker.  I snickered, but still can't believe it.

If this movie proves anything, it's that Scott can't really carry a movie solo.  He's good for a few laughs, a random awkward scene, but he's more of a doubles player.  And since the only other actor with the chops to help out died (Quaid), Scott is forced to serve AND volley.

Game.  Set.  Match.",1242000000,2,2590,5.093078758949881

Watch this movie and give it a chance and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Seann William Scott is a great actor and this movie once again shows his incredible comedy skills and the rest of the cast is great also. I was entertained the entire length of this movie and think it would also be good for multiple views.

3660134,1,B001JV5B08,"I am not a prude, but how Ryan Simpkins, a then 9 year old actress playing a 8 year old child, was treated by adults involved in the movie, including her parents, is morally off the charts.  The lines she has to say are initially shocking to garner some bad taste humor and it just gets worse.  A scene where she comments on the dogs in the movie ""we went dry hump daddy"" while wiping her face was the most terrible thing I have seen in a movie.  All involved including her parents should be under investigation for child abuse.",1233964800,2,528,4.26
