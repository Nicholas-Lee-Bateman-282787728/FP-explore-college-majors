8454148,5,B0052QG1A0,"I bought my first ""Taggart"" series just to see if I would like it.  After the first show I was hooked.  Although it sometimes is a bit difficult to follow the language, the flow of each show doesn't drag.  The actors are excellent, the scrips good, and there is nothing better than watching it rain.  We here in south Texas don't see it too much.  The series has had cast changes since it began with Mark McManus, and for anyone who enjoys the later shows, they should also get some or all of the earlier series.  However, although there is some continuing storyline, each show stands on its own.  If you like crime drama with less sex and violence, then this series works well.",1357171200,,678,4.419354838709677
