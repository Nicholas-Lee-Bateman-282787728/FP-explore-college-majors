I loved Clyde when I was little and seeing these movies again brought back so many good memories... 4 movies on two discs makes them more portable as well. I was hoping for more extra features, but I imagine that will wait until some type of anniversary edition is released. Overall, very much worth the money!",1252108800,3,446,4.321428571428571

3534334,4,B001DJLD26,I must say that at a price of nearly 3.50 per movie you couldn't get a better deal on this. You get 4 good movies on 2 double sided discs. Of course I am only giving it 4 stars because of the fact that they are double sided discs. For about 4.00 more I would've been glad to pay for a 4 disc set of these movies. Other than that great movies and great deal.,1236470400,30,357,3.7733333333333334

If you are a Clint rookie you will enjoy these films, as they are different from the Dirty Harry or Man With No Name need-a-cough-drop voiced characters we all like.

Honkytonk Man was good almost all the way, but Every Which Way and Any Which Way were both nearly unwatchable. There were issues all the way through on both. This would have been a great set to own, but I am very disappointed in the quality of this. It was part of my husband's Valentine gift, which is even worse.

3534522,4,B001DJLD26,"My wife and I picked up a number of Clint Eastwood DVDs and enjoyed them very much. Good entertainment, albeit somewhat violent in many cases! More recently, we bought a packet of four Clint Eastwood Comedies (""Space Cowboys,"" ""Honkytonk Man,"" ""Every Which Way But Loose,"" and ""Any Which Way You Can""). The four-pack is an easy and inexpensive way to purchase four good Eastwood films, or you can buy them as individual DVDs. In any case, I reviewed each individual movie for Amazon. You can look them up if you're interested in my opinions.

I rated all four individual DVDs highly. They were very good! Perhaps ""Any Which Way You Can"" was my favorite (4 stars) and the somewhat dated ""Space Cowboys"" was my least favorite (3 stars), but only by a slight margin. Anyway, this 4 pack is a bargain over purchasing them as individual DVDs and they're all very entertaining movies. If you like Clint Eastwood movies, it's an economical choice. Oh, by the way, two movies are on each disc, one on either side. Some people don't like this arrangement so be aware.

3534524,2,B001DJLD26,I love the movies and highly recommend these Eastwood flicks.  However this version is poorly produced.  The CDs are recorded on both sides without labels making almost impossible to handle them with out putting finger prints on one of the recorded movies or to even know which movie is being loaded.  In addition there are several dead spots on the movies where the action just freezes up for 5 to 30 seconds and then continues.  Try and find better recordings of these movies even if it costs a little more.,1271635200,14,509,4.622222222222222
