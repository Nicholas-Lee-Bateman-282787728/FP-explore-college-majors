This DVD not only provides excellent identification of New England's Reptile and Amphibian species but insights into their habitat requirements, research and conservation efforts. I came away with a greater appreciation for them as indicators of a healthy environment.",1226620800,4,354,5.9411764705882355
8651202,5,B001GPN618,"I was surprised by how much was on the DVD.  Really enjoyed watching the field trips- what a great collection of footage and close-ups.  The quizzes were fun and am still going through all the sections on each of the species... they have helped me identify some of what I have found in my yard and nearby fields.

My four year old kept asking to watch one more field trip!  Entertaining and accurate- I will be using this in my science classroom.",1224720000,4,446,4.402439024390244
