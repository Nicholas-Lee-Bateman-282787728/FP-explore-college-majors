Your either not going to like this movie, because it doesn't go far enough in some areas. Or hate it, because it goes to far. I was actually surprised to find out this wasn't actually a Disney production, just because of certain things that studio is known for. And I'm not talking about musical numbers here.

This is one of the reasons I was leery about children's fiction for years, because I assumed kids material was a censored and cut down material for the lower age bracket. (Turns out, most authors with their films adapted end up hating their movies anyway.) It wasn't until I watched other fantasy films, that this one really stood out like a sore thumb.

Beware of the pitfalls, and you might enjoy this film.",1411171200,,845,4.48051948051948
