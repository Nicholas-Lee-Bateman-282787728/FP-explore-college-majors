3919694,4,B002EWD0D6,"I'm writing this before the Blu-Ray is released, but I happened to catch this program on Animal Planet yesterday and was very pleased with it.

The program contains the usual stunning scenery and animal video you would expect from this type of program.  The basic theme of the program is to follow how various animals survive in Yellowstone throughout the year.  I missed the first part of the program, but I believe it starts with summer and then flows through the seasons to summer again.  There seemed to be particular emphasis on the Yellowstone winter given its harshness.  (Of particular interest was the fact that winter is when wolves are at their strongest as their prey animals become weaker.)

The program also spent some time explaining how the geology of Yellowstone affected its climate.  They explained, for example, how it can snow in Yellowstone any month of the year.  (Something I found interesting given that I got caught in a snowstorm there in late July one year!)

The TV airing was 120 minutes, less commercials.  The Blu-Ray description indicates a run time of 150 minutes.  That might include extra features or it might mean additional footage not included for broadcast.  Either way, and given the price, this seems to be a good deal.

UPDATE: The program actually includes three 50-minute episodes (Winter, Summer, Autumn).  I must have missed part of the Autumn as part of that episode has a bit more of the man versus nature theme than the other episodes.  The episodes are presented in widescreen (and look great).  Three short features on ""The People of Yellowstone"" are included.",1250467200,32,1612,4.9148148148148145

3919717,5,B002EWD0D6,"I LOVE this video!! Plays all three episodes without having to choose them!! One of the best documentaries about Yellowstone, or any National
Park, for that matter. The opportunity to showcase the beautiful scenery is interwoven with Peter Firth's narration, which is interesting and easy to listen to. Developed by BBC so there is none of the negativity and bashing of humans that every American production has. Thanks, BBC and Amazon.com!!",1493424000,,441,5.225352112676056
3919718,4,B002EWD0D6,"Is well done, but would have very much liked a more positive angle to the narration.  There is such great beauty in Yellowstone in so very many ways, but at times that reality is almost lost.

I recently bought the DVD ""North America"", and it is fabulous, with good music, photography, and it moves quickly along....very engaging.  My grandkids love that DVD, so I shopped for another that I thought would be good.  Yellowstone is nothing like I imagined and hoped.  Not to be disrespectful, but it's a BBC production, and the narration is hard to understand sometimes.  The music is DULL and slow, especially in the winter season.  It seems to go by seasons, and the winter section droned on and on, until I thought it would never end!  They kept showing the same things over and over again, and what they showed was dull, and ( in my opinion ) unimaginative photography.  I actually ended up just turning it off.  I won't watch it again. To be fair, I only watched winter, so maybe the other seasons are better, but I doubt it. I would rather not risk finding out!  I just never thought a DVD about Yellowstone could be this dull and uninspiring.  Maybe no more BBC for me?",1442534400,2,1020,4.51912568306011

3919783,4,B002EWD0D6,"Great video photography of course, as expected for this series.

One frustration with the BluRay is that the disc has numerous introductions. Lots of slow emerging animations in a series telling you about piracy law from US perspective, telling you its HD, that it is BBC, a commercial for the other BBC nature series, then a BBC warning on piracy, then the jingle telling you the series menu is coming up. My player was brand new up to date with updated firmware (5 star rated Samsung model) and yet it had trouble with this disc. If you skip all the intro stuff it freezes on the menu and you have to restart. I learned my workarounds but it was a hassle at first.",1429401600,3,666,4.414634146341464

3919785,3,B002EWD0D6,"While the photography was gorgeous, what's that I see?  Could that be ""filler video"" from another mountain range?  Parts of this appears not to be even shot in Yellowstone, which was my first disappointment, just as I was beginning to recover from the near death experience you're flung into from the very beginning.  I love these nature shows and I realize that death is a natural part of life (even though is sounds strange when you say it out loud) ... but when the producer, director, and scriptwriter all get together in a room and agree that they need to over dramatize a place as YELLOWSTONE to move their viewers in some way, they don't know their audience at all.  This group obviously doesn't know their target audience ... people, I'm sure like you and I who love nature and care enough about it to want to see a documentary or nature film or whatever you want to call it, about the grandeur and majesty of Yellowstone.  I loved knowing that the animals are there and that winters are tough for them, but don't turn this into an unbearable soap opera where this becomes a film about the animals ... this is about YELLOWSTONE.  I sincerely eventually turned the sound off and turned on some incredible music and just enjoyed the scenery, which was worth every cent.  Maybe the writers were all just weepy that day or something.  Anyway ... I wanted to give them two stars, but I felt they were already upset enough with all those close calls they had to embellish.",1428105600,,1474,4.556818181818182
3919786,4,B002EWD0D6,"I have never been to Yellowstone National Park.  This is a good dvd to watch to become better aquainted with this national treasure.  It is well done, and Peter Firth does a wonderful job of narration.  I doubt if I will ever visit Yellowstone (I'm afraid of wolves and bears, oh, my), but I enjoyed being able to learn more about it.",1427760000,,334,4.354838709677419
3919787,5,B002EWD0D6,"Much better than other documentaries of Yellowstone.  Most people feel they have to rush the production of their documentaries and it shows:  Shaky or blurry footage, subpar narration, uninteresting subject matter, etc.  BBC does it right the first time.  They show Yellowstone the way you will remember it, or perhaps better because they venture to places many won't.  If you get one documentary of Yellowstone, this is the best so far.",1427068800,,437,5.098591549295775
3919788,5,B002EWD0D6,This is a stunningly beautiful documentary. It captures all of the beauty and grandeur of the park. We get an in-close look at some of the creatures and the surrounding flora. I have watched this series many times and finally bought the package so that it will always be available to me. You can't go wrong with this documentary. The narration by Peter Firth is wonderful.,1425945600,,372,4.651515151515151
3919789,5,B002EWD0D6,"I absolutely love this documentary. It originally came free with Prime but the last time I tried to watch it you had to buy it. I love it so much I paid for it so I can get my Yellowstone fix any time I want. The photography is breathtaking and really gives you a taste of what it is like during the 3 seasons featured. My favorite is Winter with the bison covered in ice using their massive heads to clear the snow so they can get to the grass beneath.
Having visited Yellowstone and lived just outside it near Grand Teton where traffic jams are caused by Buffalo not cars this series takes me back to that beautiful region and makes me yearn to return.",1425254400,,654,4.198412698412699

3919812,5,B002EWD0D6,"This is probably the best nature documentary I've ever seen, and I've seen many. Everything about it is extremely well-done: the narration, music, cinematography, and the stories themselves. I found every second to be entertaining. It's also very interesting and educational. I knew little about Yellowstone before watching this documentary. The story of the volcanic activity underlying the park is truly amazing. Also, the final episode, Autumn, should be mandatory viewing for all those who don't care about conservation.

One more point, which I'm sure will draw strong disagreement from some. Unlike many nature-documentary viewers, I'm not a fan of Attenborough's narration. He always sounds like he's straining to speak. Obviously, on a personal level, I think he's an awesome dude and a champion of some great causes. But as a narrator, I much prefer Peter Firth's clearer, unstrained manner.",1417305600,,900,5.428571428571429

3919876,5,B002EWD0D6,"YELLOWSTONE [2009] [Blu-ray] [UK Release] Yellowstone, the world's first National Park, is no ordinary wilderness. It is a lost world of vast plains and endless forests, defended on all sides by towering mountains. Home to America's last great bison herd, the grizzly bear and the wolf - it is the most extensive thermal area on earth, with more than 10,000 boiling springs, fumaroles and bubbling mud pots and more geysers that rest of the world put together. It's these strange natural wonders that first made Yellowstone famous and still makes it unique today. This landmark series reveals the grandeur of this fascinating place as its animals struggle to survive over the course of the vividly changing seasons.

Join the charismatic cast of Yellowstone's wildlife, as they turn to face the extreme challenges of the seasons and discover just what it takes to brave temperatures of 40 degrees below zero, or to live through raging forest fires or to fight to the death for the right to breed. The daily struggles of the wildlife are intimately linked to Yellowstone's greatest secret that sleeps right beneath the snow, which is arguably the largest volcano. The fate of everything in this extraordinary wilderness is in the hands of forces more powerful than we can possibly imagine. Narrated by Peter Firth.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Blu-ray discs has propelled the popularity of home video documentaries and firmly established these as cherished demonstration discs the world over. The gorgeous cinematography of the BBC documentary series Planet Earth even set early Blu-ray sales records as one of the best-selling, non-feature film Blu-ray discs on the market and led the way for other nature documentaries filmed in 1080i to the format.

I've always been intrigued by the Yellowstone National Park, located in Wyoming, U.S.A. Yellowstone was the first area to be granted National Park status at the turn of the 19th Century. An entire eco-system in itself, Yellowstone is home to hundreds of different species and many endangered, from all walks of life; land, sea and sky. However, below their feet the delicate balance of life above ground could be disrupted in seconds by one of the largest active volcanos in the world. Whilst this is only of peripheral concern in the program, the fact of the matter is that the beauty of Yellowstone would be forever changed, as well as causing major worldwide effects when it erupts again. The scary part is it could happen at any time. But as proven time and time again, life finds a way through these calamities.

The `Yellowstone' Blu-ray includes three 50 minute documentary programmes that make up the series and that is 180 minutes of amazing content on the one Blu-ray disc, which makes the price tag very competitive and well worth purchasing and they are as follows:

WINTER [2009] [1080i] In winter, Yellowstone is frozen solid - locked in snow as deep as a house for over six months. Whether you hunt for meat, live off stored body fat or whether you simply hibernate, you need to take every advantage, however slight, to save precious energy - then you might just make it through the winter to enjoy the green grass and balmy days of spring. As we follow the grip of winter over the course of six freezing months, we chart the fortunes of Yellowstone's wildlife in a finely balanced fight to survive. Bison use their massively powerful heads to dig through some of the deepest snow in America to reach the grass beneath. A red fox listens out for mice scurrying six feet beneath the snow before diving headfirst into the drift to snap up its prey, while otters slide through Yellowstone's winter wonderland to find any remaining open water where they can fish. All the while, as the herds of elk and bison are gradually weakened by the cold, one animal gets stronger, especially the wolf. But all is not as it first seems - there are larger powers at work. Whether a wolf, a bison or an elk makes it through is intimately linked to Yellowstone's greatest secret. Sleeping beneath the ice and snow-covered surface is one of the world's largest volcanoes. In an extraordinary twist of nature, everything from the freezing winter cold to the creation of a snowstorm is determined by the power of Yellowstone's volcanic heart.

SUMMER [2009] [1080i] As the spring melts the winter snow, the full extent of Yellowstone is gradually revealed. Now, from the surrounding lowlands herds of elk, pronghorn and bison return from their winter feeding grounds to take advantage of America's richest natural grasslands - right in the heart of Yellowstone. In only a few weeks, a brutally harsh deep freeze has been transformed into a flower-decked nursery perfect for the year's new-born animals. There is also a new cast of characters that emerge bleary-eyed from hibernation as grizzly bears begin to teach their young the secrets of survival in Yellowstone and how to hunt fish in the still-frozen rivers and, as the season progresses, when to move out through valleys and grasslands into summer forests and up into Yellowstone's alpine peaks. In this spectacular wilderness, over 10,000ft high, they slide and scrabble, hunting millions of tiny moths buried under rocks on the barren slopes. But summer here is fickle; even on Midsummer's Day, winter can descend from the surrounding mountains bringing punishing snows to fragile flower meadows. August is the only month in the year when it does not snow, but then, just as it seems the easy living of summer has finally arrived; it is brought to an abrupt end as fires sweep through the forest, laying Yellowstone to waste. Yellowstone is the most geothermally active place on Earth. There are 10,000 boiling springs, bubbling mud pots and fumaroles there, and more geysers than in all the rest of the world put together. But for some, nature's fountains are more than just a marvel, they are an obsession. 'Geyser Gazers' have seen them all and can even imitate them. With bated breath, like train spotters they tut when one is a few seconds late and when another erupts in a new and innovative way they dance for joy.

AUTUMN [2009] [1080i] Over the summer, Yellowstone has flourished in late August there are more living things here than at any other time of the year. But winter is around the corner and there are just two months for all Yellowstone's animals to get ready or get out. An early dusting of snow is a sign for elk to start moving down from the mountains to focus on finding food in the valleys. Although the wolves are waiting for them, the male elk are distracted, their haunting bugle calls boasting that they are fired up and ready to fight each other to the death for the right to breed. As temperatures fall further, beavers get busy in a rush to repair dams and stock underwater larders before ice freezes their ponds. Yellowstone's forests - the aspens, cottonwoods and maples - start to shut down for the winter, their colours painting the park a blaze of red and gold. Meanwhile, another tree is coming into its own, the whitebark pine. It offers up a bumper crop of pine nuts which fatten grizzly bears and squirrels alike. But its nuts are meant for another animal - the Clark's nutcracker - a small bird with a colossal memory and one that will reward the tree's efforts well by carrying its seeds far and wide, and even planting them. As autumn ends, the snow and ice return and many animals now move out from the heart of Yellowstone and away from the protection of the national park. Their fight is not only to survive the cold, but also to find what little wild space remains in the modern world. All around Yellowstone, the human world is encroaching - it is now that the true value of the 'world's first national park' becomes clearer than ever. Mike Kasic is a local sound recordist who got many of the natural sounds for the series, but in his spare time he dons snorkel and fins and jumps into the raging waters of one of the USA's wildest rivers to explore Yellowstone from the point of view of the unique Yellowstone cut-throat trout. Whilst his exploits might seem strange to the other park users - fly fishermen and bison alike - in becoming a fish, Mike not only uncovers an enchanting hidden Yellowstone, but finds out that things are not what they used to be for the cut- throat trout.

Blu-ray Video Quality  `Yellowstone' is presented in a breath-taking 1080i aspect ratio of 1.78:1. The vast majority of the series was filmed with the spectacular RED ONE High Definition video cameras. `Yellowstone' is certainly up to the high standards set by its predecessors including Planet Earth. The series features a very sharp image, with very accurate colour. Occasionally, some scenes will feature noticeably degraded images, but this is more a reflection of tricky filming locations or bad lighting, and not a reflection of the quality of the transfer. Some truly spectacular scenes were captured by the documentary crew and the quality on offer here is equally jaw dropping. It's hard to go back to standard definition documentaries after you've seen these.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The main audio track is encoded in 5.1 DTS HD Master Audio. To my knowledge `Yellowstone' is the first BBC Blu-ray documentary to offer a 5.1 audio mix. I can't say it offers a whole lot more to the experience than the standard stereo mixes, but the additional rear effects, including general ambience is welcomed. There's quite a bit of separation in the front channels and the centre channel mostly handles the narration. There are very little low end bass effects on offer is quite superfluous.

Blu-ray Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Yellowstone People [2009] [480i] The Blu-ray edition of Yellowstone' includes a trio of decent documentaries, all of which are presented in standard definition.

Jeff Henry: The Snowman [2009] [480i] [10:00] This special feature profiles the ex-park ranger and winter photographer who works through the winter as Yellowstone's so-called ""roof shoveler."" His job being to clear snow from buildings during the harsh winters, as their mass and weight can threaten to collapse roofs and cause structural damage to buildings.

Geyser Gazers [2009] [480i] [10:49] This special feature concerns the volunteer naturephiles enthusiasts who help monitor the many geysers around the park, helping to document their activities and predict their often erratic behaviour, that helped the BBC crew capture some of their most striking Geyser footage.

Mike Kasic: The Fishman [2009] [480i] [10:26] This special feature profiles the sound recordist and Montana resident who spends his free time swimming the Yellowstone River. It only amounts to a half-hour of content, but it's certainly better than nothing. Unfortunately at the start of each documentary, the sounds dips and you have crank up the amplifier, but when the main part of the documentary starts, the sound goes loud, I just wish they had spent a little more money and time on putting this very annoying unprofessional part at the start of each documentary right. Despite this slightly negative aspect, it's definitely an interesting series of documentaries and nice that their individual contributions could be acknowledged.

Finally, `Yellowstone' is a really spectacular documentary series and another winner from the BBC. We the British taxpayers, do not begrudge paying for a TV Licence, especially when TV Programmes such as these are the outcome, that is why I am so proud to live in the United Kingdom, as our BBC Television has no adverts to interrupt the flow of the TV programmes. Of note however, normally Sir David Attenborough usually does these types of Documentaries, but instead this time it is performed by the smooth talking actor Peter Firth, who does a really excellent professional job, especially explaining all the different aspects of the amazing and unique Yellowstone National Park. I originally viewed this on BBC Two in the UK and was very impressed then when it was first broadcast, but for a long time I was reluctant to purchase this particular Blu-ray disc, well my doubts were well worth trounced, as it is a totally spectacular Blu-ray disc from the very professional BBC and the images are totally awesome. I also definitely recommend the other BBC EARTH Blu-ray disc `Wild China,' as that also has totally awesome spectacular images, as well as awesome sounds and if you invite your friends round to view both of these BBC Blu-ray discs, I know for sure their jaw will drop when viewed on your 3D SMART Flat Widescreen Television. Highly Recommended!

The series is more about the animals, birds and bugs of Yellowstone than about the geysers, but that is OK with me.  This series allows you to get a good feel for the place without having to spend your vacation time, and then only getting to see Yellowstone for a week at a time. I highly recommend this series.",1387238400,,478,4.494252873563219

Winter in Yellowstone is the first chapter of this movie. The movie is very adventurous. The picture quality is outstanding, and very clear. It is mostly about wolves, elk and bears surviving the harsh winter  conditions. It is narrated by Peter Firth, who does an excellent job of describing the events. I enjoyed this movie and have learned more about Yellowstone than I knew before, as a result of watching this documentary.",1363996800,,548,4.89247311827957

3920090,4,B002EWD0D6,"The BBC Earth documentary ""Yellowstone: Battle For Life"" is yet another triumph for the folks that have created all the BBC Earth documentaries.  The imagery is amazing; the vistas are sweeping; and the clarity of the interactions between animals is remarkable.  Overall, this documentary removes all of your preconceived notions about what you thought Yellowstone might be like; I, for one, didn't know much about the boiling pools and the sweeping mountain views.

If I could give one piece of negative feedback, it would have to be Peter Firth's narration.  The content was fine; his voice is just not suited to a documentary of this type.  Now admittedly, he has a hard act to follow in David Attenborough, whose throaty voice dominated other BBC Earth documentary series; but his lack of intonation and flat delivery does take away from the grandeur of the series.  Others have recommended that you watch this on mute; I disagree because with the narration comes some spectacular music as well, which you wouldn't want to miss.

Despite the less than perfect narration, this one's definitely a keeper and much in line with other BBC Earth projects.  I wouldn't hesitate to add it to your collection.",1361836800,,1204,4.985

Because of my interest in Yellowstone I bought this out of the blue based upon the quality of previous BBC productions. I was not disappointed and would in fact highly recommend it. The first two episodes (Winter & Summer) were the best, the last episode (Fall) was unfortunately filled with too much human content. Although I understand why, it is not what I want to see in a natural history documentary. I would rather that it was simply part of the narrative instead of taking up video content that is better used on the wildlife and landscape.",1357689600,4,793,4.874074074074074

The viewer is left, at times, with a breath momentarily interrupted at the beauty, power, and honesty of this film. The struggle of bison and elk to stay strong enough to survive the elements and the strengthening wolf pack is riveting, but BBC never allows it to become either overly shocking or overly sentimental. 50 minutes of this in HD left me almost immobilized with awe, and wonderment that humans could have made such a film in a Yellowstone winter.",1348358400,,782,5.023076923076923

It chronicles the complex interplay of weather, natural setting, flora and fauna and highlights the struggle to survive through three seasons. Any preconceived notions that you might have of Yellowstone as a gentle, tranquil American Eden will disappear rapidly while watching how precarious life can be in the face of massive snowfall, blistering heat and deadly cold, drought, ephemeral times of plenty and competition for resources.

Although the first episode (""Winter"") provides the most background about the geological formation and meteorological peculiarities of Yellowstone, each episode touches on these points if only to remind you of the extremes that all forms of life endure while living in the park.

Peter Firth is a wonderfully calm narrator. I'm only guessing here, but he night be Colin Firth's brother; their voices are quite similar.

If you have a sufficiently fast Internet connection and a high-resolution monitor or TV, by all means watch the HD version. Incredible cinematography and editing.",1312243200,3,1121,5.431034482758621

3920250,2,B002EWD0D6,"I'm a huge fan of BBC documentaries.  However, this one was shot on my turf, and I didn't care for the embellished locations and the inaccurate and over-dramatized script.  This documentary is about Yellowstone, but you'll be treated to authentic sights such as the ""callie-opie"" hummingbirds feeding on garden columbines (the wild ones don't come in pink in this area) with the Tetons in the background, probably in the vicinity of Jenny Lake Lodge.  Since most of Yellowstone is a volcanic plateau, it is not known for craggy mountain scenery. Apparently 'they' felt the need to borrow some surrounding mountain scenery, as if Yellowstone isn't grand enough, judging from the numerous panoramas of the Tetons, the Absarokas, and other mountains not in the park.  For example, Pilot and Index Peaks are shown in this documentary (from an overlook on Highway 212 east of the park).  They are in the Absaroka Range and are well outside Yellowstone's boundaries, and can't be seen from within Yellowstone.  To see bears feeding on moths, you'll also need to head into the Absarokas, again, outside the park.  The footage depicting the life cycle of whitebark pine was shot completely out of the park on the Beartooth Plateau, which they referred to as 'Yellowstone's wilderness'.  It is not Yellowstone's wilderness, the scenery shown is in the Custer National Forest, and as strange as it seems, Yellowstone actually has no designated wilderness.  At least there were a couple of shots of Electric Peak and Mt Holmes, mountains actually IN the park.  Since this documentary was titled ""Yellowstone, battle for life"", the implication is all the filming locations were in Yellowstone.  Not so, in a big way.

Another annoyance, the script contradicts itself by stating in the beginning how the temps are -40, then later, talking about how the temperatures have warmed and it doesn't get very cold any more (which is true, relatively speaking).  It hasn't hit -40 since about 2002, and then only for a night or two (in other words, not a regular occurrence at all).  This documentary was shot in 2008 (I saw them filming it) which was a relatively mild winter that never got to -40.  If it had reached those lows regularly at any point in the last 8 years, we wouldn't have the issue with bark beetles we currently have, since it is correctly stated that intense cold is needed to kill them.  I am betting the -60 referred to was in the early 80's, about 29 years ago (I was living in an un-insulated cabin, and remember that winter well!)

Don't come to Yellowstone expecting to see moose eating weeds in a pond surrounded by cottonwoods.  The few cottonwoods that exist in Yellowstone are the lone variety prominently featured in the vast dry expanses of Lamar Valley during filming of the wolves.  Most of Yellowstone is too high and cold to support cottonwoods.  My guess is that section was filmed in Grand Teton, or Harriman State park in Idaho.  Either way, I'm 100 percent sure it was not filmed in Yellowstone, which makes this part intrinsically dishonest.  This film gives the impression moose are common in Yellowstone, when in fact they an animal rarely seen in Yellowstone due to marginal habitat.  Pronghorn aren't that common in Yellowstone either, except the northern part of the park as they are a sagebrush-dependent species that prefers dry grasslands, and are very numerous outside the park.  And by the way ""male elk"" are ""bulls"", female elk are ""cows"".  Since use of the name ""elk"" (in Europe, moose are called elk), implies this version was narrated for American audiences, they could have at least gotten the terminology for the sexes correct.  And fireweed doesn't spring up immediately after a fire unless you're in a mild, wet climate like the pacific coast.  In Yellowstone, it comes up the year following a fire, and the implication that it is sprouting up and blooming enough for hummingbirds to be enjoying it in the weeks following a late summer fire is ridiculous.  Gimme a break.  There's lots of little truth-stretching stuff like that done for an audience that doesn't know better.  I could go on, but you get the idea.  Yellowstone is an amazing place, where life is hard for animals.  No need to embellish.  Just show it like it is.  And, I wish my hero David Attenborough would have narrated what could have been a wonderful documentary about one of my favorite places on earth.  Maybe I'll watch it again with the sound turned down and enjoy it more.",1296000000,92,4487,4.851511169513798

I enjoy all three episodes, and find the photography just elegant and stunning, especially when viewed in a blu-ray format. I have been to Yellowstone twice but all during the summer. This title really serves its purpose for me and compliments the parts I never got to see of the yellowstone.",1275264000,3,538,4.73404255319149
3920270,5,B002EWD0D6,"I'm super picky about the DVD's I buy and keep and this one is probably the best nature documentary I have ever purchased! This is not just one, brief, hi-def show, but three, superb, full-length shows which feature the finest photography ever taken of Yellowstone in: 1. Winter, 2. Summer, and 3. Autumn, and all are produced with the same care and quality that we have come to love and appreciate with the BBC's Planet Earth series. I was hesitant to buy this DVD, wondering if it would be another short, politically-driven propaganda film like so many of the currently produced nature shows are. But I refreshingly found that this show is a fair portrayal of how difficult and also gorgeous things actually are in Yellowstone today, and it's really well filmed and produced with lots of what I would call ""eye candy"" because it is so professionally filmed--it is truly amazing to watch and enjoy! I see more of Yellowstone's beauty and wonder each time I watch it! I'm so glad I took a chance and bought this in blu-ray (if you have a 1080p TV you should be watching and enjoying blu-ray DVDs) because I really do like it even better than the Planet Earth series which I also own and frequently enjoy watching in blu-ray. I was thrilled when I realized that there is actually around 150 total minutes of superb film to enjoy on this DVD! If you love the Planet Earth by BBC, you will also love this first class documentary of Yellowstone--it's worth every penny you will pay for it! I promise you will love it! Get it!",1273968000,7,1521,4.554744525547445

3920284,5,B002EWD0D6,"I think I enjoy this Yellowstone DVD the most from the BBC Nature Series. Besides Yellowstone, I own Ganges, Wild China, Galapagos and of course, Planet Earth. I love they way Yellowstone starts out in the dead of Winter, and builds up to life, warmth and Springtime...there is just something about the mood throughout this disc that really grabs you. Also, the blu ray photography is so stunning...from one Series to another, these BBC guys are the best! Many posters scrutinize how the photography in, say Galapagos is better than Ganges, or that Wild China has blurry scenes..I say this is all nonsense. All these discs are the best blu ray photography around ... and yet it's only shot in 1080i. I don't know what they do to enhance it, but these discs in 1080i are as sharp and colorful as any 1080p movies I have ever watched on my player.",1264982400,8,845,4.602649006622516

It singles out different species and gives you a good view of their lives through the seasons at Yellowstone. Some of the animals incorperated are Grizzlies, Otters, Bison, caribou, and moose. There is also alot of focus on the landscape itself(good picture quality). This is two disks, one hundred and fifty minutes of good stuff.",1264550400,3,453,4.973684210526316

Documentary is full of great sceneries & stories. I learned a lot from the video & wants to visit Yellowstone to see if for myself.
Only thing to notice is that it's in HD 1080i resolution - this does not reduce any visual affects of the videography.
BBC always does an excellent job with the subjects, locations of interest & videography.

I highly recommend this video",1264377600,3,443,4.753246753246753
3920287,5,B002EWD0D6,"""Yellowstone"" is a co-production between Animal Planet and the BBC. It was originally aired as a TV series, which explains its lengthy run time.

The documentary is divided in three parts, called ""Winter"", ""Summer"" and ""Autumn"". All three contain dramatic and stunning footage from the Yellowstone national park in Wyoming. The geysers and other weird geological formations are featured, the extreme weather conditions are explained, and then follows a long parade of animals: bison, elk, wolves, pronghorns, grizzly bears, bighorn sheep, beavers, foxes, even nutcrackers and beetles. The most dramatic moment is a fight between a male and a female grizzly on a steep mountain slope. More corny is a confrontation between a beaver and a moose (!).

A positive thing about ""Yellowstone"" is that it doesn't constantly mention those famous (or infamous) wolves. The other animals, and even some of the trees, get their piece of the action, too. My personal favourites are the magpies and the honkers. I'm used to these birds from my suburban environment, and consider them to be somehow ""suburban"". They feel out of place in Yellowstone, and make the place feel like home...

Of course, that's about the only thing about this wilderness area that does feel like home. Otherwise, Yellowstone National Park might as well be another planet! That's probably because Yellowstone looks like Earth before the arrival of humans. That makes this documentary even more fascinating to watch. Somehow, it feels like being placed in a time machine, getting a glimps of a world long lost.

And Yellowstone, too, might be lost. Many of the animals are threatened by man whenever they leave the boundaries of the national park. A beetle is destroying the pine trees, a pest made possible by the somewhat milder climate. Global warming? And, of course, the whole area sits on top an active supervolcano. At least that's not our fault!

Yellowstone is more fascinating than Africa or the Amazonas. I admit of suffering from a serious boat of ""TV safari ennui"". Please spare me the lions and gnus, thank you.

This documentary was the perfect cure. Recommended.",1263427200,2,2139,5.097142857142857
3920288,4,B002EWD0D6,This is absolutely the best Yellowstone video ever. The format of following the seasons of Yellowstone provides an interesting understanding of animal behavior. The videography is gorgeous and the explanation of Yellowstone's geologic factors and their effects is new information. My only complaint is the over dramatic descriptions of animal behavior life/death decisions.,1262217600,7,373,6.056603773584905
3920289,4,B002EWD0D6,Very nice with lots of good shots of the wildlife.  However there was not nearly enough of the park itself.  Very short on the geyzers and hot pools.  Just about nothing on yellowstone canyon.  Adding this would have made it more complete.,1261872000,4,239,4.619047619047619

Great cinematography and narration. The aforementioned ""diving fox"" as well as the ""bisonsicles"" with their steaming breath are worth the price of admission by themselves, but there is so much more! Highly recommended!",1255478400,,390,5.109375
3920293,5,B002EWD0D6,"The BBC has released many excellent documentaries in hi-def/Blu-ray and Yellowstone is no exception. It carries on the BBC's tradition of high-quality nature programming and flair for visually-stunning photography. This series is a year in the lives of several of Yellowstone/North America's iconic wildlife: the bison, grizzly bears, foxes, wolves, beavers, and elk. Divided into three 50 minute episodes, they are titled ""Winter"", ""Summer"" and ""Autumn"" (in this order). For the US market, the BBC has added ""Battle for Life"" to the title, but this is a bit superfluous and unnecessary, maybe to make the DVD sound more dramatic. The original title is simply ""Yellowstone"".

The episodes are informative, entertaining, and light-hearted, largely free of the depressing reminders of human ecological destruction seen on some other BBC documentaries such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wild-Pacific-Blu-ray/dp/B002BEXDXO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wild Pacific [Blu-ray</a>]. I learned some things I didn't know before. Winter is by far my favorite episode, giving me the most memorable line from the series: ""At 40 degrees below zero, Fahrenheit or centigrade doesn't really matter much. At this temperature, both are the same."" Despite being the home to the world's largest geothermal formation, Yellowstone is paradoxically one of the coldest places in North America. I enjoyed the pristine landscapes covered with deep snow and seeing a winter wonderland untouched by any signs of humanity, all from the comfort of my home. One particularly amazing scene is of a fox sniffing for mice under 6 feet of snow, and seeing it leap into the air, plunge headfirst into the snow like an Olympic diver, and emerge with a mouse in its jaws.

This series also features some gorgeous fly-overs, in particular, the colorful volcanic springs (Grand Prismatic Spring), which looks like a beautiful orange and blue encircled painting instead of a natural ecological wonder. I wish the producers could've spend some time showing us the colonies of extremophile heat-loving bacteria that thrive in these springs, instead of just flying over and cutting to the next scene. Bears and elk I've seen a thousand times on TV, but not these rare bacteria.

I watched these out of order on TV, but the overall effect is not diminished because of the cycle of life and the changing of the seasons. Peter Firth's voice is pleasant and affable.
