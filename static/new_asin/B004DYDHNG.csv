8426326,5,B004DYDHNG,"Quand Ho is one of my favorite teachers. I like his style of painting and this dvd is a must for anyone aiming to be a professional artist. It really gives you all you need to know to start painting. Keep in mind that he is an oil painter and his demos are ""oil-oriented"". I watch if every time I need a mentor advice.",1392681600,3,318,3.984375

8426329,5,B004DYDHNG,"This has to be one of the 2 best instructional DVDs I have ever had the pleasure of watching. Quang Ho is by far the best instructor to ever make an instructional DVD on Oil painting techniques. I have a huge collection of instructional DVDs I've purchased over time, by some of the most respected and recognized artists in the profession today.  None can compare to the excellence of Quang Ho. He is clear, thorough and simplifies every aspect of oil painting in the most effective way possible. If an aspiring artist at any level does not excel and improve after watching these DVDs, they should hang up the brush. Painting a Still Life, by Quang Ho,  also, ranks high in my opinion. What I spent on these 2 DVDs was well worth the investment. In fact, I can put the rest of my DVDs away and just watch these 2 DVDs over and over. Save yourself a lot of unnecessary expense and time and invest in Quang Ho. You will not regret it. Thank you Quang. Can't wait for the next one.",1348531200,11,978,4.33879781420765
