But I was so disappointed about the storyline, the characters and just the whole outlook of the movie. I couldn't even sit through it from beginning to end and started fast forwarding at some point. The dialogues are flat and hard to watch.",1403049600,,341,4.7

1885562,1,B00009N829,Terrible.  It's the worst movie I have ever seen. Try to find another version of Pinocchio.  This one does not even attempt to add in the part of his nose growing.,1391040000,,163,4.225806451612903
1885563,1,B00009N829,"Technically very interesting, but otherwise not worth to watch. The actor is old trying to portray a boy, which makes his character to appear ridiculous.
I was extremely disappointed, continue to prefer the original film!",1389830400,,221,5.3428571428571425
1885564,1,B00009N829,"I couldn't quit watching this movie, not because I loved it, but couldn't believe how bad it was.  Roberto Baneigni reminded me more of John Wayne Gacy than a puppet.  Let me sum it up for you: a 50 year old man with a 5 o'clock shadow and huge tuffets of arm hair poking out of a pair of pink onesy pajamas with ruffles and a pointed hat is supposed to make us feel all warm hearted?

This is an abortion of a film that is like watching a train wreck in slow motion with many, many casualties.  It's so bad, it's almost worth watching just to see how bad it is.",1384214400,,562,3.9910714285714284
1885565,4,B00009N829,"My kids (especially my 8 year old son) loved this movie!  We watched it after we had read the Classic Starts Pinnochio.  It follows the book pretty closely.  The dubbing of English bothered me, but my kids didn't care.",1383696000,4,218,4.538461538461538
1885566,1,B00009N829,Was rather boring and annoying. Liked better the other movie versions where there was a wooden puppet first and less stupid lines.,1378684800,,130,4.954545454545454
1885567,5,B00009N829,"Benigni plays Pinocchio brilliantly.  Some may think that a middle-aged man playing a small boy is strange, but Benigni's enthusiasm and humor make him a perfect fit for the role.  In my opinion, Benigni is an amazing actor.  He was absolutely wonderful in Life is Beautiful.",1359849600,5,275,4.934782608695652

1885569,1,B00009N829,I really thought this was just a weird movie. Pinocchio is like a 50 year old man and it was just a very odd rendition of this old fairy tail.,1458864000,,142,3.7666666666666666

1885571,2,B00009N829,"This was...interesting to say the least. I was looking for the classic movie. I showed this to my kids and they were kind of in shock for a moment. They did enjoy it, but i didn't too much.",1446854400,,189,4.0

1885574,5,B00009N829,"This is a fun movie! In Italian with English subtitles, with superb acting and the usual symbolism.",1435017600,3,99,4.882352941176471
1885575,1,B00009N829,"Pinocchio is one of the most iconic fairy tale characters of all time. He debuted in the 1883 children's novel, The Adventures of Pinocchio, written by Italian writer Carlo Collodi. He was a young, wooden puppet made by Geppetto, a woodcarver from Italy who wanted to make the son he never had. Upon creation, Pinocchio came to life and was able to walk and talk like a real boy. Because of that, he made it his dream to become a real boy. He would have his problems, like his nose would grow if he told a lie. However, with the help of a talking cricket he befriends, Pinocchio proved himself worthy and received his wish in the end.

The Adventures of Pinocchio has been adapted many times over the past 132 years. One of the most beloved adaptations came from Disney's 1940 animated classic, Pinocchio. It is a timeless movie that has been passed down to every generation. There was no need for anyone to top that adaptation in film.

Unfortunately, in the source material's country of origin, one filmmaker wanted to make a movie on Pinocchio from an Italian's perspective. To do a remake of a movie that was made in America, but was based on a story from your country, is okay to do. Just keep it in your country. Roberto Benigni's Pinocchio didn't. Released in 2002, Pinocchio was the most disasterous adaptation to ever come to the United States. It got slaughtered by everyone, it only made $3 million in the box office, and it received 6 Razzie nominations. Where do I begin explaining this atrocity?

Let's start with the director himself, Roberto Benigni, who also plays the title character. Roberto Benigni grew up on the talents of Charles Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Peter Sellers, and he became recognized as an improvisational actor who eventually developed a career in directing. Now, he was never a bad talent. He was in great Jim Jarmusch movies like Down by Law and Night on Earth, and his turn at acting/directing/writing in the Oscar-winning 1997 movie, Life Is Beautiful, showed he was capable of doing a movie right. In Pinocchio, Roberto does everything wrong. Not just the movie, but also the representation of the source material.

Here, we have a FIFTY-YEAR OLD Roberto Benigni playing a boy character! The thought of it doesn't even work. As he tries to take on this iconic character, he forgets that his age difference isn't going to make anyone take this performance seriously. Sure, some adults have gotten away with playing younger fairy tale characters. But Pinocchio is a BOY, and a BOY is in the range of 2 to 12 years old! Even worse, he isn't even made to look like a wooden puppet. He's already looking like someone in human form. It's like having a cat play Lassie or the Tin Man dressed up in rubber. This kind of costume and makeup design is something you can only get away with in middle school plays. Even worse, his acting here is way too childish and clownish. It resembles some of Robin Williams, Dana Carvey, Mike Myers, and Adam Sandler's worst performances ever. Sure, it's a children's movie, but for an Oscar-winner in the Best Actor category, Roberto should've known better.

But Pinocchio isn't the only character this movie got wrong. The talking characters in the story, like the Fox, the Cat, and the Talking Cricket, don't even look like a Fox, a Cat, or a Cricket. The actors are all in human form! There was no attempt to give them any costumes to make them look like animals. They could've done CGI characters, but they didn't. Even the hideous, squeaking mice in the opening scene were CGI. It's not that hard.

Now, the production and story are no better off. One of the film's first scenes has a log bouncing around the village and causing chaos in the style of unfunny slapstick. The cops even take action and try to arrest the log. IT'S A LOG! YOU CAN'T ARREST A LOG! The next thing I'm going to point out is when Pinocchio ditches school, he goes to a play and joins in with other performing ""wooden puppets"". They get trapped by puppet master Mangiafuoco after the play, and he's huge. Like Gulliver's Travels huge. Pinocchio is seen around the village in normal size and height like the other villagers, but he only appears small in front of Mangiafuoco. That's another disadvantage of having an adult play Pinocchio. The sizes of the puppets are so inconsistent, that you can tell when they're using a green screen effect.

And if you listen closely and observe the screen, the dialogue doesn't match up with the actors' lip movement. That brings us to the movie's biggest problem: it was filmed in Italian, but here, IT'S ALL DUBBED IN ENGLISH! YOU DO NOT DO THAT FOR A FOREIGN MOVIE PLAYING IN AMERICAN CINEMAS! BUT THEY DO IT EVEN WORSE ON PINOCCHIO! Seriously, this is the worst dubbing ever done for a movie. The movie's US distributor, Miramax, admitted that they needed to do post-production looping to insert the English dub for the US release. Why? Did they know that just the sight of an adult playing Pinocchio was going to fail? This only adds onto the problem. You a FIFTY-YEAR OLD Roberto Benigni playing Pinocchio and SOUNDING LIKE THE STONER FROM CLUELESS! You have a Talking Cricket not looking like a cricket and SOUNDING LIKE A MEMBER OF MONTY PYTHON! You have the Fox and the Cat not looking like a Fox or a Cat and SOUNDING LIKE COMEDIANS OF OTHER ETHNICITIES!

I wish I could elaborate more on every other problem, but I made my point clear. This is the worst adaptation of The Adventures of Pinocchio or any other children's fairy tale book in general. I'm sure Italy was looking to do a remake of a movie based on a story from their country. Heck, I come from an Italian heritage, but I never would've trusted the actor that killed the Pink Panther franchise with a wooden project that deserves to be turned into paper.

Score: 0/100

Recommendation: None. I'd even recommend Jonathan Taylor Thomas's performance in 1996's The Adventures of Pinocchio before this movie.",1429142400,,5963,4.675881792183032
1885576,4,B00009N829,"Not sure why but my kids love this movie and ask for it repeatedly.  I actually purchased the digital copy of it.  I do agree with a lot of the reviewers here.  It's absurd to see a grown man act the part.  Really not sure why Benigni would risk his career over this one, but for the sake of my kids I'm glad he did.  :-)",1418342400,,321,3.803030303030303
