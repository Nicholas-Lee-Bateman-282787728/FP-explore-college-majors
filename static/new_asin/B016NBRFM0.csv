8736806,1,B016NBRFM0,According to insiders... one of the producers.. Tony.. is a lying manipulator who finances his B movies by coning investors and never paying them back. He pays the actors with the investors money upfront... and ditches the investors. Not a good look for a wanna be producer.... with no real credentials. The cast and crew and distributors are are potentially ruining their reputation by dealing with someone with such a lack of qualifications and character. This type of fraud needs to be exposed.,1492992000,3,497,5.0

8736809,2,B016NBRFM0,"The film starts out with an uplifting tune, one that hasn't been heard since Wilson Phillips reigned the pop charts. Phoenix (Sierra Mora) and her cousin Angel (Angelica Marie) with their pretty face and cleavage miraculously are able to escape the Oakland non-project hood and become video fashion models at ""It Factor Models.""

On the plus side are the uplifting message, no gangs, no drugs, and Sierra's cleavage in nearly every frame.

On the minus side was the choppy echo sound and the acting, especially Grandma (Tammy S. Brice) who shouldn't give up her day job. The plot plodded on until the end when it suddenly turned stupid. Apparently the writer thought they needed some aspect of ""the hood"" to enter the film to make it believable or watchable.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. Plenty of bikinis and cleavage.  2 stars is generous.",1456617600,3,846,4.854166666666667
