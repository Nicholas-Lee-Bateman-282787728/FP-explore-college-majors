8175286,5,B000N6UHMM,I purchased this set from another retailer and three of the five discs didn't play.  They replaced the entire set and of of those five didn't work but between the two sets I had a complete working set.  I own a lot of railroad DVDs and I have to say that this is one of the better sets.  Each show features a different locating location or railroad.  Out is kind of dated but very watchable.  It's a bargain.,1524960000,,408,4.17948717948718
8175287,1,B000N6UHMM,"This five disc set should be a very good one, once Amazon fixes the title and instructs the manufacturer. I ordered this item TWICE. Same problem both times. The title ""All Aboard Disc - 5"" is at fault. The ""made to order"" set came to me with, you guessed it, a copy of Disc #5 only. It needs to be called something like, ""All Aboard-Five Disc Set"". This would tell the person producing the set when ordered to COPY ALL FIVE DISCS, not just #5 disc. Be patient, the content listed looks like a good set!",1376092800,,503,4.25
