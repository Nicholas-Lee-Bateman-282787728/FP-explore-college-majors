Especially with an annoying garage band playing all over the dvd, it disturbes you even when there might be something of interest you might want to hear, but these instances are FAR and few between....please, please, I beg of you, do not waste your money!!

8047826,1,B0007KVEJY,"I've been a Beatlemaniac for years. I was looking forward to this anthology DVD as described in the sales description. Unfortunately I was due for an extreme disappointment. I had a VHS titled ""The Complete Beatles"" which, after this is THE BEST anthology ever made from beginning to end with MANY vintage clips. THIS, however, is poorly made by Music Box. Instead of having The Fab 4 in extended clips, they have a poor quality Beatles wanna be band doing some tunes and comments. The ACTUAL clips of ""The Boys"" are very few and very short. All in all, this is a DVD that isn't worth the plastic it's copied on. The description said it is to be discontinued. GOOD RIDDANCE!",1236470400,5,674,4.578512396694215
