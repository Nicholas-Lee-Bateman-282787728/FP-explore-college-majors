8265258,5,B001774Y6G,Why isn't this on the air??? The show is so cool. They really do a good job of bringing Flash into the 21st Century. They need another motion picture.,1366675200,,150,4.206896551724138
8265259,3,B001774Y6G,"Right after the show premiered this disc was issued as a Best Buy exclusive for $6.99.  As of the time of this writing, it's the only episode of the show to be released on DVD in the USA and, annoyingly, it's an abridged cut.

The version included here is the 65 minute pilot as it originally aired on The Sci Fi Channel.  Included are 7 minutes worth of deleted scenes (no scene selection, no chapter stops) with incomplete special effects.  The version of the pilot included in the Canadian '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flash-Gordon-The-Complete-Series/dp/B00408YYEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flash Gordon: The Complete Series</a>' boxed set is split into two parts with finished effects, a full score and a total running time of around 90 minutes.  Lots of little moments that appear in that version are nowhere to be found on this disc, and there's nothing here that can't be found in the other version.  And I gotta say, the 2-part version is drastically superior.  The show was a character piece, and the network shot themselves in the foot by removing virtually every moment of the pilot that gave the characters some dimension.  I can't help but wonder if they were deliberately trying to sabotage the show.

The only reason to get this release is for the ""Storyboard and Sketches"" gallery, which includes concept art (mainly abandoned concepts, since Sci Fi wouldn't fork over the money required to fully realize these concepts), a few storyboards and photos of prop guns from Mongo.  Sadly, instead of fitting these pics to the size of the TV screen, they're small and centered on a sky background so you can't see the full detail of the beautiful concept art, even on a big-screen TV.  It's a shame these weren't ported over to the Canadian DVD set, which includes no extras whatsoever.

The only other extra is a ""sneak peek"" (i.e. a 2 1/2 minute trailer) for the then-forthcoming ""Tin Man"" movie.

Bottom line: Unless you're a diehard Flash Gordon fan/collector, it's not worth the money that many nefarious resellers demand for this disc.",1315785600,,2095,5.090643274853801
8265260,4,B001774Y6G,"I used to stay up late after work to catch episodes for this series when it was on the air. It was something I personally looked forward to every week. Yes, the acting was cheesy and some of the story lines were somewhat cheesy as well, but that's kind of what made it fun to watch.

Watching this series made me feel like a kid again watching saturday morning cartoons. The series wasn't overly dramatic (smallville) or intensely developed with new twists and turns every week (Lost), it was just a simple sci-fi fantasy show that you could enjoy and disconnect from the world to watch. I thought the main character was very much like the old comic book heroes while the main heroine and some of the supporting cast gave the show a more modern feel, and the simplicity of the show just made it more enjoyable.

A word of caution though, I am very upset that this disc has only one episode on it. It seems ridiculous to pay that much for only one episode. I wish they would release the rest of the series.",1281052800,3,1005,4.3689839572192515
8265261,4,B001774Y6G,"The negative buzz seems all about how this version compares to the Sam Jones version, as if that is the true criterion. I disagree. Perhaps those who think so never watched the original versions with Buster Crabbe. The story itself is fantasy, so the viewer should suspend some disbelief and just be entertained. In the Buster Crabbe versions, you saw cheesy flames and sparks coming from obvious models on wires. But the series was enjoyable in it's naivet. In the Sam Jones version, you had better special effects, and an overwhelming Queen soundtrack, but the acting was still cheesy, carrying on in the tradition set by Buster Crabbe. Entertaining as a movie, but only one episode, ever. Then SciFi (not SyFy) produced this series with Eric Johnson as Flash. The special effects are much higher tech, and the acting is still cheesy. The writers chose a different tack than the originals or the Sam Jones version, probably more entertaining for those who actually experienced the originals, and those who were not locked into defending the honor of the Sam Jones version. In other words, best for those who could just relax and not compare it to anything. Considering the fickle network marketeering mindset, I knew it would not get a second season, so I am glad the only season was allowed a reasonable end. I'm still waiting for a full season set.",1279324800,3,1352,4.831896551724138
8265262,1,B001774Y6G,"Please let this be buried never to return...  The worst adaptation of Flash Gordon in the history of time.  There was absolutely nothing Flash Gordon about it.  There Sci Fi Channel bought the rights to the original Queen soundtrack, had the rights to Flash Gordon, was still riding the Battle Star Galactica high, it could have been lightening in a bottle and pissed it all away for a cheaply produced, terrible terrible TERRIBLE re-envisioning of a great series.  I could without a doubt make a better Flash Gordon series in my living room with my Canon HF100, my green screen and about $2000.  Wouldn't be perfect, but it would much be better than this tripe.",1278720000,5,662,4.721739130434782
8265263,4,B001774Y6G,"I thought the show wasn't that bad, compared with the movie.  I hope they are planning to release the rest of the show on DVD sometime soon.  Just because it was cancelled doesn't mean people didn't enjoy it and wouldn't mind owning it.  It is great Saturday afternoon fare.",1265500800,,274,4.551020408163265
8265264,4,B001774Y6G,"Hey!  If you liked the all too brief TV series, this title is for you. The only drawback is that there is only the pilot episode included. However, Ms. Cliche is superb as the tough Baylin. You gotta love anyone that good looking and able to kick butt!  }:o)",1262217600,,258,4.244897959183674
8265265,1,B001774Y6G,"There is only one episode on this DVD. Wait for the entire series.

8265266,2,B001774Y6G,"I guess it should be buyer beware.  Who makes a DVD with only 1 episode on it?  I thought it was the full season.  $30 for one episode is ridiculous.  The product was in perfect condition, but I am disappointed.",1251331200,3,211,4.2
