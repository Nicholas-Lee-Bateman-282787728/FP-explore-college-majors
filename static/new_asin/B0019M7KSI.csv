3440697,5,B0019M7KSI,We now own Season's 1-3 and Season 3 is now the family favorite.  There are some really horrible jobs on this season and Mike Rowe's humor can't be beat.  Great show!,1282089600,,166,4.32258064516129
3440698,5,B0019M7KSI,"""Dirty Jobs with Mike Rowe"" Collection Three highlights some of the best (or worst, depending on your viewpoint) episodes of the popular Discovery Channel show. The affable, smart, and funny Rowe is definitely not afraid to get his hands dirty, and I especially appreciate how he never condescends to any of the workers regardless of how seemingly menial or disgusting the task at hand is.

This two-DVD set contains twelve episodes and over twenty separate jobs that range from unsanitary to dirty and scary to unbelievably terrifying. Some of my favorites are ""Bridge Painter and Space Crawler Technician"" (outrageously scary and unfathomably dirty, respectively,) ""Vomit Island Worker,"" a job that proves that things that are beautiful at a distance aren't necessarily so appealing close up, ""Alligator Egg Collector"" (just awful in every way,) ""Odor Eater"" (where Mike learns his nose is ""damaged goods,"") and ""Mud Mineral Excavator and Rice Plantation Worker,"" where absolutely nothing goes as planned.

Rising above all those jobs though is what may be the most positively revolting job of the entire series. Of course I refer to ""Slime Eel Fisherman."" If you have not seen this episode, buy this set immediately and watch it. Make sure that you are not eating while doing so. I had no idea that creatures like this existed, much less that there was profit to be made in fishing for these things. (They are exported to Korea where they are viewed as a delicacy.) One of the fishermen notes that a single eel can make a gallon of slime easily. Mike does the math that they have thousands of slime eels on the boat, and therefore thousands of gallons of eel mucus. If you want a disgusting job, this one's for you.

""Dirty Jobs"" is always educational and supremely entertaining. Mike Rowe is the perfect host for the show, and whatever his salary is, it isn't enough for what he goes through to get these segments. This is a great set and a great value. Get it today and get dirty!",1280793600,5,1985,4.83235294117647
3440699,5,B0019M7KSI,"I now (proudly) own seasons 1 through 5 of Dirty Jobs and I couldn't be happier!  For any fan of the show or Mike Rowe (I am both...giggle), purchasing this dvd is a no-brainer :)  What are you waiting for??  :)",1274227200,,211,4.097560975609756
3440700,4,B0019M7KSI,"First of all...love Mike Rowe!  He has a great sense of humor, and will try his best in even the worst conditions.  Second, I actually bought this set just to show my marine science students the section on the ""slime eels.""  Slime eels are also known as hagfish and are one of the most ancient fish.  To be honest, there are not too many videos on hagfish.  Mike gives a little bit of a educational background on the hagfish and a huge of appreciation to the men and woman who fish these creatures for a living.  It is truly a dirty job!  Well done!",1241827200,,549,4.221153846153846
3440701,5,B0019M7KSI,"Great dvd season!  Already ready to order the fourth, when i get a chance.  Shipment came is perfect condition",1238976000,,110,4.7368421052631575

Needless to say, Mike Rowe has educated all of us throughout his series of shows.  Keep up the good work!",1234828800,,268,3.9074074074074074
3440703,5,B0019M7KSI,I really enjoy the show and love to have dvd's so i can watch it whenever i feel like doing.  These collection disc's take the best epsisodes of the season and put them on dvd for a quarter of the price of the full season.  Cant beat that!,1233360000,,239,3.9583333333333335
3440704,5,B0019M7KSI,"This third collection of Dirty Jobs continues the pattern set by the first two collections of offering a ""best of"" set of episodes. Mike Rowe and crew have established a formula for each episode that calls for showing an overview of the job followed by Mike getting dirty.

After so many episodes the show has evolved into interesting and important jobs that only a few people work at. Bridge painters, buoy cleaners, and NASA crawler maintainers make up a small portion of workers, but knowing the nature of the work is entertaining and educational.

The series is suitable for children as young as age 5. Unlike earlier collections which contained some details on animal breeding, Dirty Jobs Collection 3 has nothing I found objectionable. Disgusting? Yes.

Check out the leather tanning episode for some truly gross work and the bridge painting episode for some stunning images of the Mackinac Suspension Bridge in northern Michigan.",1229817600,14,936,5.064935064935065
