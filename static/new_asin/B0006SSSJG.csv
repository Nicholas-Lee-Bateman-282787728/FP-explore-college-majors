8042922,1,B0006SSSJG,"This comments concerning Vol 1 are applicable to the entire series.  While the narration was generally good, endless repetition of the same footage (often anachronistic and often not even relevant to the military or naval forces of the country then under discussion in the narration) within and among the volumes of this series quickly lead me to regret having purchased them.  If done well, the series could have been a great aid in informing people not seriously involved in history as a profession or an avocation.  As actually done (with a few exceptions,) it was a waste of concept, time, money and other resources applied to an essentially incompetent production of the series, often to the effect of misinforming viewers.

I rarely give one or five star ratings, but this product deserves to be thoroughly panned.",1405468800,,820,5.007352941176471
