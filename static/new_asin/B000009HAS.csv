8041194,4,B000009HAS,"This is a good Movie!  It features acrobatic martial arts Superstar Yuen Biao (Project A) as ""Ching"", a Ming Dynasty Imperial Guard. Beautiful Hong Kong leading lady Maggie Cheung (Police Story I&II) is  streetwalker ""Polla"". The always awesome Yuen Wah (Supercop) is  villian ""Fung San"". Veteran actors Taipo, Corey Yuen Kwai,  Richard Ng, and Wu Ma also have small roles.
Yuen Wah and Yuen Biao are  Imperial guards during the Ming Dynasty in ancient China. Yuen Wah becomes  a rapist and serial killer, and murders the Princess. Yuen Biao vows to  bring Fung San to the Emporer for justice. Fung San steals the magical  ""Black Jade Buddha"" and attempts to use its mystical superpowers  for himself. Ah Ching arrives just in time to stop him. A fierce swordfight  ensues with both participants tumbling over the edge of a cliff into a  glacier. Still locked together in combat, the two are frozen for three  hundred years.
After discovery the two are accidentaly thawed and brought  back to life in modern day Hong Kong. Fung San adapts easily to the  excesses of modern day, he returns to a life of crime. Ah Ching  ""rescues"" prostitute ""Polla"", and without job skills Ah  Ching becomes Polla's bodyguard/personal slave to survive. Later, Ah Ching  battles to rescue Polla after she falls intp Fung San's evil  clutches.
The swordplay and fight scenes between Yuen Biao and Yuen Wah  are awesome !  The immense neon sign used to backlight Yuen Biao and his  sword on top of a skyscraper is a very striking image! One of the ultimate  scenes in the movie comes when Wah and Biao are facing off with swords and  a huge 747 jet passes right behind them, Wow! I love the juxtaposition of  ancient weapons and modern technology. I have run through the final fight  scenes over and over again in slow motion and reverse to watch the action,  it is unbelievable. There are a few really excellent stunts in the movie  too. Yuen Wah and Yuen Biao are the real thing, as they were both stuntmen  extrordinaire before they became actors.
Yuen Wah always plays the most  evil villians in Hong Kong Cinema with extreme skill. Biao's portrayal of  Ah Ching is wonderfully done and convincingly complex and funny too. He  truly shines in the emotional scene in the graveyard tunnel when he drinks  the poison to prove his love for Polla.
I highly recommend this movie.",963792000,3,2356,4.7407407407407405
