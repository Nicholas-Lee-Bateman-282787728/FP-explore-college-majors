7634935,5,B01BHCPQF8,I love this show!!!!!! I ordered this yesterday and it came today! love it soooo much!!!! I seriously cannot wait for vol. 2 and season 2.... I watched all the episodes so far and I just wanna see them all over again T-T,1462579200,,220,4.1395348837209305
7634936,5,B01BHCPQF8,"I am so glad that a 2nd vol is coming out August 9 2016 as I can not get enough of this series,  Having only caught episodes randomly on you tube I like the characters origin story even if it was not on this disk.  At first I thought Cat Noir was going to be typical love interest like Tuxedo Mask was for Sailor Moon but turned out to be more of Lady Bug side kick without being getting on one nerve,  Like many magical girl anime the enemy Hawk Moth transform the town citizens into super villans to try to take the two miraculous creatures that give them their abilities. while I think I know who Hawk Moth might be I hope a episode on a future DVD will show if I am right or not.",1462492800,,683,3.9708029197080292

7634938,4,B01BHCPQF8,"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the series and would totally recommend it to everyone. I even bought the season pass on Amazon (although I do watch it in French as well) and I would rate the series 5/5; however, the product itself is a little lower quality than I would prefer.

The subtitles are really blocky and there are no menu options on the extra animatics so you have to fast forward or cycle through all of them to pick one you'd like. Also, the subtitles are just a direct rip off the english track and not a translation of the french so that's a little disappointing if you wanted to watch the french track with a direct translation. Also, because it's a DVD, the quality i get from streaming the series from Amazon's Season Pass is also higher than the DVD... I wish it was a Blu-Ray.

All in all, I'm happy to support the series and to have a physical copy of the show I love so much, but I wish the quality could be higher.",1462233600,19,932,4.201117318435754
7634939,5,B01BHCPQF8,"Great series but this DVD only features 7 episodes. To be fair, as of this release, only 13 of 26 have aired on Nickelodeon.  Target will come with stickers and Best Buy with a mask. :)",1461283200,11,185,4.138888888888889

7634942,4,B01BHCPQF8,"I love this series but the fact that they don't have the french dub on here is a major disappointment and I probably won't buy it now. I'm more likely to import the French version but would prefer to have both languages on the full boxset.

EDIT: I found out this does have the french version in it, which is wonderful news. Downside is that the Subs are based on the English version which is a bit of a downer but I'm more apt to go out and buy it now~ Or perhaps buy it for my cousin and wait for the complete season boxset for myself. Thanks for the update guys! I just love listening to it in French.",1461024000,4,604,4.033333333333333
7634943,4,B01BHCPQF8,"My toddler loves this show. Like seriously, he is obsessed. He just turned three, and for a few months now everything has been Ladybug and Cat Noir, or Plagg and Tiki. And don't even get me started on the theme song--he sings it all day (and in his defense it really is catchy as heck.). The even better part is that it is not bad to watch as a adult. It is cute, and clever, and teaches kids that it is important to be looking out for others and doing the right thing. It seems to have kind of a French, meets Japanese, meets American ascetic, and it really works. One thing I don't love is that there is only about eight out of the twenty something episodes in the first season on this DVD. If I have to watch the Timebreaker episode one more time I might loose my mind.
But other than that, this is an a great show, and a useful product, and definitely worth the money. And shipped quickly, with no damage!",1489881600,,909,4.170454545454546
7634944,3,B01BHCPQF8,"Okay, I LOVE the show. While I am thrilled about it coming out on DVD, I am not thrilled with the quality with which it came out. They basically threw the show onto a disc and published it. Could have used a bit more effort.

Pros:
-it is out on dvd
-it has french and english (I was excited about the french)

Cons:
-the disc had scuffs on it right out of the new box.
-I am almost certain that the english subtitles are just the american script combined with the addition of ""sound"" descriptions. The sound might be for the benefit of hearing impaired, or, if the hearing impaired were not considered, plain stupidity on the production company's part. It is very hard to listen to french and read english, without the addition of sound descriptions. While the english script is not horrible, it does not always match up with the original french. I wish they had taken the time to translate the exact french for the subtitled version. I was hoping to learn french vocabulary and pronunciation.
-the full french theme song doesn't play, only about 10 seconds of it; it is literally the voiced intro, barely the song.",1486944000,,1116,4.54726368159204

7634959,4,B01BHCPQF8,"Glad to have a DVD for this considering a lot of cartoons don't get DVDs. :)

Mostly I was a little bummed that the English subtitles were only for the English Language, and not for the translated french since the meaning is different. I know that is not a typical thing, but that would be super cool for future releases since I love the French voices, too! :)",1464307200,23,360,4.294117647058823

7634961,2,B01BHCPQF8,"I love the show, do not get me wrong. And I LOVE that YES, you can listen to it in french with English subtitles. Sadly, however, rather than being a translation of the French, the subtitles are from the English script; which includes a line for Alya when she only gasped in the French audio track, and Nino using the term ""cray-cray"". That was when I stopped watching.

I very much believe that we should support the show financially, to show the American rights holders that we want more of this show and related merchandise, and that we want a French track, but we need English subtitles that match the French script, not the American lipflaps!

Again, amazing show, and I highly recommend it. Just.... not the English script.",1463961600,29,729,4.6434108527131785
