8543846,5,B000OOM1C2,"Excellent bio of a great man. Can't believe how much original footage there was of him on the streets of various cities, carefully watching people going about their everyday activities. I was struck by his dilemma of, on one hand, needing to be out engaging with the world and, on the other hand, requiring solitude and quiet to reflect on and write about his experiences. I was also struck by how much this man LOVED human beings of every stripe and color. I've watched his YouTube debate at Cambridge with William F. Buckley, and other addresses he made, and was taken with his astute intelligence, but those didn't show his love like this biography did. And, finally, in this tumultuous era of politics and racial divide, I was heartened by the resurgence of Baldwin's work, as well as how he is reflected in Ta Nahisi Coates, Bryan Stevenson and others. The new documentary, ""I'm Not Your Negro,"" is coming out soon, and I think watching this biography will help me appreciate the new one, which is not supposed to be a biography.",1486339200,6,1034,4.686813186813187
8543847,5,B000OOM1C2,"I have used this film many times in undergraduate and graduate classes to introduce students to the vision of this extraordinary writer and activist. His work is as relevant today as when he penned it, maybe more so.",1481587200,4,216,4.7105263157894735
8543848,5,B000OOM1C2,Inspiring. My favorite aspect of the style of this documentary is that James Baldwin narrates through clips of interviews he gave at different points in his life.,1479513600,3,162,5.037037037037037
