8658323,2,B00KGFGJNQ,"I just got this today and purchased it solely based on two of the actors in the film that I am a fan of. Those two are Billy Gabarena and Raine Brown. This film was written and directed by Chris Seaver who is the head honcho of Low Budget Pictures. He has changed the name to SRS Cinema LLC. The film basically revolves around a mythical VHS tape that the owner has in his comic store and will only sell for the astronomical price of $1,500.00. The lead character played by Kurt Indovina has finally saved enough money to purchase the tape even though no one knows what is on it and so is his arch nemesis played by Josh Suire. Unfortunately for both they were beaten to the punch by hot geek girl Tangerine played by Raine Brown. The rest of the film is about the two enemies trying to get her to like them so they can get in position to steal the tape. For me, unfortunately, I am not a fan of Seaver's style of film making so I did not enjoy it. My favorite performance was Billy Gaberina as Death Bone the owner of the comic store and seller of the legendary tape. His over the top Rocky-esque performance was hilarious. If you are a fan of LBP then you will love this film. If you are not then you will most likely dislike it. If you are unsure look for some of his other work with the best example being Mulva 2 Kill Teen Ape. While the films are not similar the style is the same.",1425600000,,1387,4.121771217712177

8658325,5,B00KGFGJNQ,Cris Seaver is the man. If you don't know about LBP then you just don't know. Low budget comedy that is made to be exactly that... low budget. If you are looking for another fluffy Kevin Smith film go buy something else. Always have great dialogue and totally crazy plots.,1413072000,,272,4.46
