5879598,5,B00DYRNGQ6,"Even after repeated viewing and so many years on, I still have my lights on when watching this masterpiece. It is one of few horror movies that can stand the test of time. I have it on LD, DVD and pre order on Blu Ray. It deserves a place in every movie collector's display shelf.",1378252800,3,280,4.109090909090909
5879599,5,B00DYRNGQ6,"A visiting actress in Washington, D.C., notices dramatic and dangerous changes in the behavior and physical make-up of her 12-year-old daughter. Meanwhile, a young priest at nearby Georgetown University begins to doubt his faith while dealing with his mother's terminal sickness. An elderly priest recognizes the necessity for a show-down with an old demonic enemy.

The Exorcist changed a generation of movie-goers. It shocked audiences upon release and still holds up today. Movie lovers everywhere rushed to waiting ambulances because the horror was too much to take. Now there is a special 40th Anniversary Blu-ray. This 2-disc set contains the Extended Director's Cut & Theatrical Cut. There are 2 new features, ""Beyond Comprehension: William Peter Blatty's The Exorcist"" and ""Talk of the Devil"". It contains some previous bonus features like the excellent ""The Fear of God"" documentary. There is also ""Excerpt of The Friedkin Connection: A Memoir"". Regarding the Extended Director's Cut, Friedkin says, ""After my final cut of the original 'The Exorcist,' I took out 12 more minutes before we actually released it in theatres. Years later, Bill Blatty asked if I'd consider reviewing some of that rejected footage (which he always felt should have remained) with an eye towards putting it into a new version. Bill gave me the best piece of material I've ever received and because of that and because the film had such a major reputation over some 25 years, I agreed to revisit all these scenes. When I saw them, I came to realize that Bill was, in fact, right. With technical advances, scenes that didn't work then could now be fixed with CGI and there were others that I thought strengthened the spiritual aspect of the film. Warner agreed and released a whole new theatrical print in 2000 which we called 'The Exorcist: The Version You've Never Seen.' And I now agree with Blatty that this is the best and most complete version.""

Beyond Comprehension: 40 years after his novel was published, The Exorcist author, screenwriter and producer returns to where it all began. First stop is a cabin/guest house in the hills of Encino, California, where Blatty wrote the novel. The author visits the place for the first time in 40 years and shares not only memories of writing the book, but also discusses how it inspired him. We then meet Blatty in two key and iconic locations; Georgetown University where the film was shot, and at the now-famous Exorcist steps. Throughout, Blatty reads from his novel, including an excerpt from a chilling newly published passage. Talk of the Devil: While at Georgetown University, William Peter Blatty heard about a true case of possession from Father Eugene Gallagher. At the time the film came out, the priest talked at length about exorcism, the true story and about Blatty; this footage is now available for the first time in many years. It is as revealing as it is shocking; plus an excerpt from Friedkin's new book, ""The Friedkin Connection: A Memoir.""

5879600,5,B00DYRNGQ6,"I can't wait to receive this. I know this re release is considered for the people who bought the previous one a waste, as they already own the digibook version. I've heard that version has a perfectly good transfer which it probably does. But you see, THAT VERSION IS OUT OF PRINT. Even though the digibook version is sold through a third party seller on amazon, a new release needs to be made available to the people who don't already own that version. This is the perfect time to do that considering this year marks the 40th anniversary of what i've been told to be the best horror film of all time. I expect high picture quality with great extras from this upcoming release to be worth my dollar. I'm glad this release as with the previous one has the original theatrical cut and the extended director's cut. so fans have the right to choose the one of their viewing. Anyway, this film looks great and i hope it lives up to my standards, which I know it probably will. 'Cause after 40 years, this film accomplished its job.

5879602,5,B00DYRNGQ6,"On Christmas Day, 1973 I stood in a long line at a Chicago area theater freezing my ass off waiting to see the opening of a movie that made a lasting imprint. Because of the publicity, ""The Exorcist"" had generated a lot of buzz about people barfing, fainting and screaming out of theaters. Not only was the movie going to be successful but it was based on a true incident involving a 14 year old Maryland boy in 1949.

Author William Peter Blatty, a sometime comedy screenwriter wrote a novel using the boy's story as a basis. Blatty's book became hugely successful - I read it in one setting - and he went on to write the screenplay for the film. Set in Georgetown (D.C.), the film slowly unwinds as a movie star and her daughter are on location shooting a film. Loud noises begin to come from the attic of their rented home. Chris (Ellen Burstyn) thinks they are rats. The noises continue and move to the bedroom of 12 year old Regan (Linda Blair). Eventually, Regan is taken over by strange impulses and her behavior becomes erratic, dangerous, frightening and ominous. Doctors are puzzled.

Chris, a religious agnostic gets advice from the head of Georgetown University, a Jesuit priest. Eventually she meets Father Damien Karras, played by Jason Miller who is in fact a celebrated playwright (""That Championship Season""). Miller, who rarely acts, is amazing as a conflicted man of God facing his own crisis of faith. He calls in Father Merrin (Max von Sydow) who has experience at exorcisms. Their scenes with the now fully demonized Regan are not so much scary, but horrifying in the true sense of the word.

Director William Friedkin (""The French Connection"") pulls you in and engrosses you into this event of demonic possession. It is a film that had an impact on everyone who saw it at the time. There was nothing like it. Entertaining? No, it was an experience.

This 40th Anniversary Blu ray, available in October, 2013, adds a few features to the existing Blu ray version.  First, it is scanned in 4K.  That will be important to some, not so much to others.  I suspect most will not notice the difference.  Video resolution is 1080p and the film has a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  Audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  The package includes a DVD and Ultraviolet version in addition to the Blu ray.  There are a couple new features.  Novelist William Peter Blatty provides a tour of the house where he wrote the novel as well as the Georgetown location where the film was shot.  He also reads excerpts from the book.  There is a second new feature involving Blatty and a priest who discuss the actual exorcism.  Sounds cool.  Here are the other features:

Gorgeous, glossy hardcover slipcase housing a nice promotional hardcover book featuring the portion of the director's memoir about the making of the film, and a standard blu-ray case for the discs, both easy to remove.

I bought this when it was at a special discounted price, and many other people must have done the same because the price was sitting at between 20-30 dollars, and then when it cut down to $15 everyone bought it and it's now at what appears to be the premium regular retail price wherever you can find it ($42 on Best Buy.)

Outer damage to digibooks or slipcasing isn't as common as the deep noticeable scratches that Steelbooks can suffer in the same fit shipping boxes or envelopes. Since the packaging does have a metallic glossy finish to it, it is more susceptible to minor scratches revealing the shiny material it was printed on.

5879639,4,B00DYRNGQ6,"She swears.  She levitates her bed.  She spews green vomit.  No, it's not Sarah Silverman or Sandra Bernhard or even Howard Stern in drag.  It's little Regan, the twelve-year-old girl possessed by the Devil in the 1973 horror classic ""The Exorcist.""

A friend of mine had an office next to a movie theater in the early Seventies.  He said when ""The Exorcist"" was playing there, he could set his watch by the audience screams that came in intervals through the walls.

Warner Bros. seem to be having a good time reissuing ""The Exorcist"" in new and different editions.  To my knowledge, they've released it on disc four times now.  First, there was the regular DVD edition in a bare-bones affair.  Then came the Twenty-fifth Anniversary edition with its numerous extras.  After that came ""The Version You've Never Seen,"" with over ten minutes of additional footage the filmmakers initially deleted.  And now we get the high-definition package of the theatrical version and the Director's Cut in a fancy, bonus-laden Blu-ray Book edition.  Whether the added scenes make the film any better is a matter of opinion, but two things are clear:  The Blu-ray versions look and sound better than ever, and a good, scary movie remains a good, scary movie no matter what the edition.  If you have to have justification for buying the HD release, you can always say the Devil made you do it.

William Peter Blatty based the screenplay on his own best-selling novel, which in turn found inspiration from a newspaper article about a real-life exorcism.  Under the direction of William Friedkin, the movie account of young Regan's demonic possession is probably a lot scarier than the actual experience, as it should be in a work of largely imaginative fiction.  But it's that element of ""what if"" that makes the movie all the more plausible, and, therefore, all the more alarming.

Linda Blair plays Regan, who at the beginning of the picture is a perfectly normal, well-adjusted kid. For reasons unknown she becomes the object of possession not just by subordinate demons but by the Devil himself.  At first, she merely acts strangely; then she starts uttering weird noises and making her bed shake.  Before long she is disgorging green slime and rotating her head 180 degrees.  Her mother, played by Ellen Burstyn, takes her to the best doctors in town, but to no avail.  The doctors suggest an exorcism as a last resort.  Understandably, what the mother considers witchcraft dismays her, but she is willing to go to any lengths to save her daughter.

The man she calls upon for help is a local Catholic priest at Georgetown University, Father Damien Karras, played by Jason Miller.  He is a psychologist who frankly doesn't believe in exorcisms.  The movie is as much about him as it is about the possessed girl, since Father Karras is going through his own crisis of faith at the time of the story.  He soon becomes convinced of the Devil's power, however, when Regan spits green goo in his face, starts speaking in tongues, and materializes words on her stomach.  To help out Father Karras, the Church brings in their big guns in the person of Father Merrin, played by Max von Sydow, apparently an old hand at exorcisms.  As the exorcist, Sydow brings a note of calm reassurance to the proceedings, and together the two priests exorcise the demon, albeit at a terrible price.

The movie is spooky from start to finish, every shot shrouded in mystery and suspense, climaxed by a terrifying final scene.  This is all the more startling because of the mundane quality of the people and setting involved.  I mean, the main character is a little girl.  How scary can a twelve-year-old be?  Here, pretty scary.  And the film confines the significant action mainly to a single room in a house, Regan's bedroom.  How scary can a bedroom be?  Again, pretty scary.

In his methodically deliberate way, director Friedkin slowly builds and releases tension that is not only thrilling but seems perfectly natural.  Indeed, much of the acting seems improvisational to heighten the verisimilitude of the situations.  It's true that the special effects sometimes draw attention to themselves, like the swiveling head, yet they always sustain the horror of the event.  It's easy for an audience to suspend their disbelief when they don't have to keep saying to themselves, ""Oh, that's silly"" or ""That couldn't really happen.""  The filmmakers made this stuff look and feel as though it could really happen.

So, what are the differences in the extended Director's Cut and the one that originally played in movie theaters?  First, the filmmakers distribute the ten minutes-plus of added scenes a few minutes at a time here and there throughout the movie, and the scenes don't really change much.  They do, however, provide a little more insight into the character of Father Karras, offer more on the ""nervous disorder"" diagnosis for Regan, and give the film a slightly different ending.  Probably the most important addition, however, is the famous ""spider-walking"" scene, a five-second segment that has Regan walking down a flight of stairs upside-down.  The scene was in Blatty's novel and in the initial screenplay, but director Friedkin had at first thought it came too early in the story and was just ""too much,"" thus, excising it.  You be the judge, since you get both versions of the movie (on separate discs).  I found the ""spider walk"" a frightening moment and thought it worked just fine.

Video:
In ""A Personal Message from William Friedkin"" the director offers his ""gratitude to Warner Home Video for presenting this high-definition Blu-ray, which was color-timed by the cinematographer Owen Roizman and myself and represents the very best print ever made of 'The Exorcist.'""

The WB video engineers use a pair of dual-layer BD50's and a VC-1 codec to reproduce both versions of the 1.85:1-ratio movie in high definition.  The brighter scenes are brilliant and clear, with object delineation that varies from sharp and detailed to somewhat soft.  Colors look lifelike, especially skin tones, and solid black levels help to set them off.  The engineers left the film's natural print grain intact, which is sometimes hardly noticeable and sometimes imparts a rough, gritty appearance to the image.

Audio:
A lossless DTS-HD Master Audio track renders the sound remixed in 6.1 surround.  The first thing one notices is that there is a good deal of activity in the side and rear speakers, particularly in ambient musical bloom and crowd noises, but also in more subtle ways, like the creaking of the house and the wind through the windows.  Dynamics are strong, too, as is the depth and airiness of the soundstage.  The only things to suffer on occasion are voices, which can come across with a hollow nasality.

Extras:
The Blu-ray Book edition comes with two discs, as I've said.  On disc one we find the Extended Director's Cut (2000 version), 132 minutes.  In addition, it contains an introduction and an audio commentary by director William Friedkin; a new, 2010, three-part documentary with sections called ""Raising Hell:  Filming The Exorcist,"" thirty minutes; ""The Exorcist:  Locations Then and Now,"" about eight-and-a-half minutes; and ""Faces of Evil:  The Different Versions of The Exorcist,"" about ten minutes.  Disc one concludes with two theatrical trailers, three TV spots, three radio spots, and forty-eight scene selections.

Disc two contains the original theatrical version of the movie.  It also includes commentaries by director William Friedkin and producer-screenwriter Peter Blatty; the 1998 documentary ""The Fear of God: The Making of The Exorcist,"" seventy-seven minutes; sketches and storyboards; an interview gallery covering ""The Original Cut,"" ""The Final Reckoning,"" and ""Stairway to Heaven""; an original ending; three theatrical trailers; four TV spots; and forty-seven scene selections.

Finally, because this is a Blu-ray Book edition, we get a forty-page hardbound book of text and pictures, with the two Blu-ray discs housed in Digipak spindles on the inside front and back covers, plus ""A Personal Message from William Friedkin.""  Spoken languages for the films include English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and others; subtitles in Danish, Finnish, French, Hungarian, Norwegian, Spanish, Swedish, and others; and captions for the hearing impaired in English, German, and Italian.

Parting Thoughts:
""The Exorcist"" is keen on billing itself as ""the scariest movie of all time.""  While I don't fully agree with that assessment, I do think the movie is right up there with the cinema's better chillers.  It follows in the tradition of ""The Haunting,"" ""Rosemary's Baby,"" and ""The Shining"" in that it is at least a plausible, if farfetched, horror story.  Yet ""The Exorcist"" goes beyond the others with its subplot of Father Karras.  It is really his conversion to a belief in spirits that makes believers of us all.  And this is what good filmmaking is all about--forcing us to believe in the unbelievable.  ""The Exorcist"" is shocking, sometimes outrageous, and certainly profane, so I would forewarn you, it's not for children.",1433203200,,9156,5.06951871657754

5879650,4,B00DYRNGQ6,"The Exorcist is one of those transcendent films that, because of word of mouth, have grown into nearly legendary proportions. There was a time in the mid-1970s, when it was believed that not only was this the scariest film ever made, but that just viewing the film could leave individuals open for demonic possession themselves. Neither of these things are really true. The Exorcist is not so much scary as it is cerebral and unnerving.  It grips you to your core and forces you to open your eyes to the possibility of the supernatural and ancient evil.

The film is an adaption of William Peter Blattys novel of the same name.  The novel itself isn't very well written or even frightening in my opinion, but what director William Friedkin was able to do with the film adaption was to create an eerie atmosphere and sense of impending doom, combine that with  the special effects wizardry of late SFX pioneer Dick Smith,  amazing performances from Ellen Burstyn,  the late Jason Miller, and Linda Blair, and the now famous Tubular Bells score,  and what you have is a tour de force in terror and suspense that grips you from the opening sequence all the way to the sad and somber finale.

Again, I do not consider this a frightening or scary film in the same sense as I would a film like Halloween or the original A Nightmare on Elm Street. I instead liken this to great films of the terror/suspense genre like Jaws, Psycho, or  The Silence of the Lambs.  It takes hold of you and doesnt let go until the thrilling finale and is a definite must-see in my opinion.",1415750400,3,1563,4.55

5879670,5,B00DYRNGQ6,"While I understand the frustration expressed by other reviewers who have previously purchased a version of this title in 2010 or earlier, it does not (and should not) diminish the overall quality of this 40th Anniversary Edition. Every detail of this package is nearly flawless, from the stunning artwork and luminescent box, to the exceptional audio and video transfer of the film itself.

In addition to the aforementioned, I was equally impressed with the slim ""hardcover"" book included in the box. Not only is the material here interesting, but I was somewhat surprised to find that this wasn't some cheaply manufactured paperback, which is usually the case. This just makes me want to go out and purchase the author's full biography. I found his comments both enlightening and entertaining, and a nice addition to an already great set.

Lastly, I don't understand all the complaints regarding the price. While I certainly wouldn't pay the suggested $49 list price (that's why we're Amazon shoppers, right?), I don't think $35 is unreasonable. Especially, considering the nice job Warner Bros. have done with this release.

Bottom line: If presentation isn't important to you and your focus is purely content, then I would suggest the 2010 release instead. However, if you don't already own The Exorcist on Bly-ray, I think the 40th Anniversary Edition is well worth the additional four or five dollars difference in price.

Pros:
 Sturdy and Attractive presentation box
 Above-average quality, slim hardcover book by William Friedkin
 Standard Blu-ray case vs. book-bound packaging
 Nice insert note printed on quality paper, from the films Director

5879676,4,B00DYRNGQ6,"Back on Blu-Ray in a new 40th Anniversay release, THE EXORCIST reprieves the same BD discs as the 2010 Digibook release of William Friedkin's blockbuster 1973 film, as well as adds a bonus disc with two new retrospective featurettes.

I've seen the picture many times over the years on video, though theatrically only once -- in its 2000 ""Version You've Never Seen"" edition, which has since been re-christened the ""Extended Director's Cut."" Not knowing how a packed audience of mostly-college students would react to that somewhat controversial re-edit of the groundbreaking horror classic, I sat pretty much in stunned silence as kids used to gore but little genuine scares from today's genre flicks sat quietly, patiently and spellbound by a movie that remains as fresh and potent today as it did decades ago.

This tale of demonic possession, shot in a documentary style by Friedkin and filled with tremendous performances (including Ellen Burstyn, Jason Miller, Max Von Sydow, and Lee J.Cobb), is obviously best remembered for cute little Linda Blair becoming inhabited by a demon that enjoys spewing buckets of pea soup and spouting endless profanities, but the other elements of the film remain just as intriguing and mysterious for me: the opening sequence of Von Sydow in Iraq, the strange coincidences and unexplained appearance of the ""demon,"" and the religious themes which resonate throughout the movie and encourage repeat viewing.

Fans have long debated the alterations made to the 2000 revision -- which adds a fantastic new stereo soundtrack and some 10 minutes of footage author/screenwriter/ producer Blatty never wanted excised to begin with- but for me, I found that it actually has more narrative shape and moves just a bit more coherently than Friedkin's original cut. True, the theatrical version of ""The Exorcist"" was (and still is) a classic, but some theological debate between priests Max Von Sydow and Jason Miller was cut against Blatty's wishes, as were scenes involving Linda Blair being examined by doctors that were referred to in the finished cut but never previously shown.

These sequences were deftly restored to the picture, along with the infamous ""spider walk"" sequence -- a great new shock-scare moment further enhanced by additional ""subliminal image"" shots (one of which is neatly added to the film's climax). However, it's not just effects that make the scene's addition noteworthy: coming at the height of Burstyn's increasing paranoia, the spider-walk works perfectly as a progression of horror following the discovery of filmmaker Burke Jennings' death.

The most satisfying addition for me, however, is the expanded finale with Cobb and priest William S. O' Malley that poignantly closes the film on a note that Friedkin's original ending was unable to do. The sound editing for the conclusion -- which intriguingly includes a note of the film's opening Iraq music -- is also effectively different in this version, reflecting the close of Blatty's original novel.

Whether or not you're a fan of this version of the film, there certainly seemed to be more point to the mostly-narrative enhancements found in the expanded ""Exorcist"" than in the purely-cosmetic changes George Lucas made to his ""Star Wars"" films. In some ways, this ""Director's Cut"" is the movie Blatty all the while, and if nothing else, makes for an interesting contrast to the final cut Friedkin originally turned in.

Warner's Blu-Ray edition of ""The Exorcist"" is simply sublime. The 40th Anniversary box contains the same two discs as the prior Digibook, and the still-exceptional VC-1 encoded 1080p transfer of the film - with both cuts on-hand - will not disappoint. The entire image has a clarity and crispness no prior video release of the picture offered, while retaining its original appearance (there's thankfully no `rethinking' of the color timing that plagued Friedkin's Blu-Ray of ""The French Connection""). The nicely textured DTS Master Audio soundtrack is likewise superb on both versions.

Disc one of the double-disc BD set boasts the ""Director's Cut"" (2000 version) with Friedkin's commentary from that prior release, plus that version's trailers, along with three new featurettes highlighted by extensive, previously unseen FX footage and make-up tests. This half-hour segment will prove to be a revelation for fans, as it also sports interviews with Blatty, Friedkin, Linda Blair, Owen Roizman and others; a then/now comparison of the movie's locations; and a ten-minute profile of the different versions of the picture, wherein Friedkin says the 2000 version is now his favorite and the most ""complete"" of the different cuts.

Disc two includes the original theatrical version, along with the extras from the 1998 DVD, from Friedkin's on-camera introduction to his original commentary; Blatty's original commentary with sound effects tests; interviews with the duo from that release; original trailers (albeit only presented in standard-definition); Mark Kermode's BBC documentary; and the ending that had been deleted from the theatrical cut.

What's new to this release - in addition to a hardbound excerpt from William Friedkin's terrific new book ""The Friedkin Connection"" - is a bonus Blu-Ray offering two brief documentaries. Regrettably, the two new extras on the disc, while interesting, really aren't worth a repurchase for fans: the half-hour ""Beyond Comprehension"" finds Blatty returning to the Georgetown locales where the film was shot, reminiscing and relaying anecdotes that have been divulged elsewhere many times by this point. It's slickly handled, but nothing revelatory. Of more interest is ""Talk of the Devil,"" a 17-minute featurette that features footage of Father Eugene Gallagher, the Georgetown priest who was involved in the original, reportedly true exorcism that inspired Blatty to write his book. It's an interesting piece but feels a bit abbreviated.

Along with an Ultraviolet copy, this package is likely to appeal to first-time buyers of ""The Exorcist"" on Blu-Ray, though fans who already own the (more attractively packaged) prior Digibook will likely find their current release to be just as satisfying.",1381363200,31,6176,5.33710174717369

5879680,3,B00DYRNGQ6,"I'll echo the sentiments of at least one other reviewer here: this three-disc, 40th Anniversary Edition of The Exorcist is kind of a let-down since the excellent Digibook was released on Blu-ray just three years ago.  This version includes the same A/V presentation and all of the older extras, with only a short bonus disc and a thin hardcover book as new supplements.  Both new featurettes on the bonus disc are of mixed quality, with a definite edge going to the Blatty retrospective.  The 1974 interview with Father Eugene Gallagher is dry and not all that informative.  Either way, it's only about 45 minutes of new material, and the book (while interesting in its own right) should probably just be purchased instead.

If you haven't bought The Exorcist on Blu-ray yet, this might be worth a purchase...but most folks will be just as happy with the Digibook, which costs lets and doesn't take up as much shelf space.",1381104000,14,922,4.810126582278481
5879681,3,B00DYRNGQ6,"Okay, I love this movie and have purchased it in seemingly endless formats and editions but this was a HUGE letdown. One of my local stores had them out today (Friday before release date) and I grabbed it for $45.99 so it came to 50 bucks with tax.

and a BONUS Disc!!
the BR bonus disc which I had been hearing about for some time contains a
27 minute (yep that is it ONLY 27 minutes) feature about William Peter Blatty going back to where it began.  This is a very odd and interesting feature. Odd because Blatty in his ever changing wigs has chosen a doozy and because his face seems to be altered as well either due to plastic surgery for appearances or as a result of an accident (I'm not trying to be mean) its just looking at him over the years is an odd thing to do , similar yet less radical than Michael Cimino. It is an interesting featurette to be sure but really NOT worth buying the whole bloody thing again and at fifty bucks no less.  The other ""featurette"" compiles old black and white footage of  Father Gallagher talking about the true case that inspired Blatty. I found this boring and could barely make it through its 15 minutes or so.

Bottom line, unless you are freakishly devout follower of all things Exorcist and HAVE to have another 40 minutes or so of babbling by the author... which reveals little not touched upon already and comes across a bit self indulgent and strange. KEEP your old BR set , and spend your money on something new. The film is NOT remastered or updated in any way...the two major BR discs are the SAME as before. This is a packaging strategy.  I am basing my review on the minimal differences between this and previous editions as well as the listed $49.99 price Warners has attached to this, to reiterate I think its a 5 star movie and the previous 2 BR set was a 5 star release.",1380931200,176,3003,5.09349593495935
5879682,5,B00DYRNGQ6,"As of time of writing, the Blu-ray is not out yet, but my local store was selling this early(won't name names,hehe)so here we go with an actual review of the disc.
The Exorcist is a pretty well known film, so I won't bore you with a film summary or review.

In 2010 there was a pretty comprehensive Blu-ray release, so the question here really is ""Is there enough to upgrade to the 40th anniversary edition?"". Depends on how much of an Exorcist completist you are! Like the previous edition, this still gives you both the theatrical and the director's cuts of the film, and together with all of the previous edition's extras.

Other than the movie(the two cuts each come on separate discs, with the third reserved just for the special bonus stuff)a mini hardcover booklet is also included, containing the essay ""Mystery of Faith"" by William Friedkin. The booklet states that it's ""adapted from"" the Friedkin Connection memoir, and it pretty much serves like a condensed 'behind the scenes' view for the movie.
Unlike the 2010 release, the 40th anniversary release of the film comes in a sturdy/glossy cardboard case, and inside is a standard Blu-ray case holding all the discs.

There are a couple of new features, like the ""Beyond Comprehension"" and the ""Talk of the Devil"" documentaries, both very welcome for those fans who want to know the behind the scenes stories and inspirations for the plot.  The transfer on the Exorcist is supposedly all new, but I didn't notice any drastic improvements from the old Blu-ray release(the film looks as good as always).

For someone who has never seen the Exorcist before, this 40th anniversary edition is a good introduction to the classic.",1380758400,4,1684,4.853658536585366
5879683,5,B00DYRNGQ6,"First of all, I'd like to say that this is one of my favorite films of all time. Secondly, I am LOVING the cover art. It certainly stands out as opposed to the classic Merrin silhouette.

I'm going to equate this release to what Warners did with Blade Runner last year. I had the five disc Blu Ray set that was released in 2007. As much as I loved my five disc set, I purchased the new edition with the blu ray book packaging and all the special features now on blu ray HD.

I LOVE my current Exorcist blu ray book edition and, while the new features intrigue me (although they don't seem like much more than what was on the 2010 release), unless they are doing this in the blu ray book/prestige format, then I don't see myself buying just because the cool cover art and ""40th Anniversary"" designation.

Any real Exorcist fans out there care to give me a valid argument as to why I should shell out another $30 to Warner Brothers?",1378598400,5,930,4.2727272727272725

8599241,5,B00DYRNGQ6,"Beautiful set. This is what a Blu-ray digibook should look and feel like. The outer case is well-made, the book is bound properly (no glue or staple issues), and the standard BR case sits right next to it nicely. Looks great on the shelf next to all the other Blu-ray digibooks.

Only caveat others should know is that the Ultraviolet code that comes with the film is only for the extended cut. I was expecting a code for both the theatrical and the extended cut, but no dice. It's not clearly called out on the packaging, so if you're looking for a UV backup of these films, keep this in mind.",1512604800,,594,4.351351351351352

8599243,4,B00DYRNGQ6,"The digital code is for the extended cut ONLY.  So if you're buying this for the UV code, just keep that in mind if that matters to you.  I much prefer the original cut of the film.  There were some good things about the re-edit but there were also some things that just didn't even make any sense, like the shadows on the wall when Mrs. McNeil walks into the kitchen during a brownout.  And then there were some other needless things that got jumbled around.  Thankfully the original cut of the film is included and it's not referred to as a ""bonus feature"", nor was it carelessly slapped onto the disc.  (not that I can tell at least).  The third disc is a laugh.  The hardcover book I never read.  I don't intend to.  It looks good.  The slipcover looks good.  I think the imagery on the slipcover is more in line with the original cut.  Mr. Blatty, the writer of the script and the book in which its' based on, wanted to include a slightly extended ending, which got re-inserted in the ""extended"" cut formerly known as ""the version you've never seen"" (the dumbest thing ever, especially once it got released to home video following it's theatrical exhibition) consisting of a brief exchange between the detective and Karris' friend Dyer, to brighten the film up.  I don't think he was very successful.  This is a very dark film.  It just looks dark.  Even the opening section that takes place in the boiling Iraqi desert looks bleak.  I guess a tiny bit of light is better than none.  The introduction that director Friedkin included on the ""25th Anniversary"" edition VHS and DVD stated that he tried to demonstrate that there's a force for good that ultimately combats evil.  Logically speaking, this is evident in the actions that take place in the film as it is in everyday life, sometimes more outwardly than others.  Sometimes evil seems to be all there is in a person's life.  If you don't believe in God, then it's easy to assume that's the case when you read news stories such as that case in Kansas City where this boy was suffocated by his father and stepmother and then fed to a pig.  God didn't prevent his gruesome death.  But was God absent from that boy's life?  Knowing what I know about God, I don't believe He was.  This film is definitely not for spectics.  However, who is this film for?  What is the point of it?  I can only assume this film was intended to address the segment of society that grew up thinking they were Christian and kind of haphazardly developed notions regarding good & evil and were backsliding into a spiritual black hole due to time spent not reading The Bible and just thinking of God as being some guy that lives in the sky somewhere.  This film can definitely strike a cord with people who fear the devil.  I think it should have struck more conversation that it seemingly did.  You hear about all these people that watched the movie and the physical reactions they had to it, and then you hear about people protesting the film's existence.  I think fearing Satan is a false move.  Being careful to avoid Satan is what God instructs us to do.  This is definitely a macabre film, but it seems to be made with earnestly good intent.  In any case, the extended ending with detective Kinderman and Father Dyer supposedly gives the audience the impression that the relationship that Kinderman and Karris had was living on between Kinderman and Dyer.  Where is there any indication that Kinderman and Karris had a relationship of any kind?  Kinderman offered Karris a night out at the movies and Karris refused.  There was no further interaction between Kinderman and Karris.  The characters did seem to get along pretty well, but what does that have to do with anything?  It certainly was not related to the death of Father Karris or the exorcism he performed or the demon(s) that overtook the Reagan McNeil.  And those were the events that shook the audience the most.  A gentle hand pat saying ""everything is going to be OK"" does not come from reminding the audience of some other set of thoughts and ideas that have absolutely no relationship.  That's kind of beating a grown person to a bloody pulp and then expecting them to not feel pain and injury because you subsequently give them a bowl of ice cream.  But I guess that goes along with my musings further up about who this film is intended for.  It's not intended for the scientifically minded, nor is it intended for someone who has a firm knowledge of Scripture.
I don't know why, but I do like these kinds of films.  People say horror films are ""evil"".  Yeah, maybe.  They're certainly negative.  Nothing Hollywood produces is really worth watching if you're intending to LIVE FOR God.  Just because a movie isn't negative doesn't mean it's GOOD.  FORREST GUMP is not rooted in scripture and that film is as close to a modern day IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE as a movie gets these days and that film, from what I can tell, doesn't emphasize or highlight anything The Lord God would take issue with.  If anything, that movie does a good service to God by encouraging others to appreciate life.  At least that's what I gather.  I could be wrong being as I have not seen that movie beyond a few small clips and the first few minutes during end of the school year downtime before the bell rang and the day was over.",1508976000,,5312,4.540569020021075

8599246,5,B00DYRNGQ6,"Being one of my favorite horror films of all time, I couldn't pass up buying this 40th Anniversary edition. The box set comes with 3 DVDs (Extended Director's Cut, Original Version, and a bonus disc) and a booklet by William Friedkin (The director of the film), explaining his experience on directing the movie and it features pictures we haven't seen before! A great little addition indeed. However, buyer beware, the redemption code for the digital version will most likely be expired! This was true in my case and I was a bit disappointed, but everything else that comes in this edition makes up for it. This is a must have for any horror fan. I was able to grab this and another horror film for a steal! I was also able to get free next day shipping. So I suggest if you aren't a Prime Member yet, please go do so now to take advantage of amazing deals on films/box sets like this one! You won't regret it!",1503014400,5,910,4.4226190476190474
