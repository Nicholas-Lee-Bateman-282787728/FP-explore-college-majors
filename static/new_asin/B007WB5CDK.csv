8522514,5,B007WB5CDK,"I really never thought I'd have so much fun with Cherubini, whose music has always struck me as more on the dramatic side.  I congratulate those involved in the rescue and presentation of an important link between opera seria and . . . . The MIkado!  An utterly delightful romp, led by the outstanding Daniel Proshaka.  Beautiful staging and costumes. I was not bothered at all by the conjunction of French singing and German recitatives.  Peter Marschnik conducts energetically.  Get it!.",1403827200,,489,4.987654320987654
8522515,5,B007WB5CDK,"""Koukourgi"" is one of six (6!) operas composed by Luigi Cherubini between 1791 and 1793, in French and in France at the height of the French Revolution. Four of those works were performed in revolutionary Paris; indeed all but one of the Italian Cherubini's operas from 1788 until his death in 1842 were premiered in Paris, and the one exception got its premiere in French-occupied Vienna. Cherubini's devotion to France and commitment to the ideals of the French Revolution can scarcely be ignored. Koukourgi is an overtly patriotic and revolutionary opera, replete with rousing marches and proclamations of the barbarism of the Enemies, whom anyone in France in 1791 would have identified as the Austrians. The title character, Koukourgi, is a loathsome ""class parasite,"" obviously a satire of the decadence of the 'ancien regime' aristocracy. The whole libretto is patently revolutionary propaganda, but the music-drama per se is revolutionary in other senses, particularly in its orchestration and in the interplay between the orchestra and the singers. Much of the singing, and of the best music, is heard in hocketing ensembles, i.e. the orchestral operaticism that would soon dominate the music of the next century. It was surely Cherubini's use of his orchestra that drew the fervent admiration of Ludwig van Beethoven and that influenced later composers.

However, ""Koukourgi"" never influenced anything simply because it was never staged. This DVD captures its world premiere of 2010 from the Stadttheater of Klagenfurt, Austria. The opera was probably finished, but no explanation for its non-performance has been discovered. The spoken dialogue portions of the libretto are lost. The modern reconstructions of them are assigned to the smug glutton princeling Koukourgi, who speaks directly to the audience in German while all the singing is in French. Koukourgi is properly the main character of the drama, the focus of the satire and the source of nearly all the humor. The French Revolution is long past, though its ideals have still to triumph in many societies, and this modern reconstruction of Cherubini's political opera aims chiefly for entertainment. The DVD is witty and colorful, and the music is well worth hearing more than once or twice.

Cherubini and Wolfgang Mozart were born a mere four years apart, the former in 1760 and the latter in 1756. Mozart's first opera was staged in 1767; Cherubini's first in 1773. Mozart composed twenty-three operas and Cherubini thirty-six, but up until Mozart's death in 1791 the two composers kept pace. Cherubini was well aware of the music of Joseph Haydn, his most prominent influence, but it's unlikely that he'd heard any of Mozart's operas before 1791. Only a rash reviewer would deny that Mozart was the greater musical genius of the two, but from the prospective of 1791, the future belonged to Cherubini for at least the next half-century. For all his creative genius, Mozart remained solidly an 18th C composer ... dare I say a Baroque composer? ... who structured his operas as recitativos and da capo arias. One can hardly hear ""Koukourgi"" (in this production anyway) without hearing the future of French opera and operetta, particularly 'opra-comique.' Cherubini in 1791 sounded more like Meyerbeer than like Mozart. And Cherubini lived long enough to collaborate with the next generation in the person of Daniel Auber, with whom he composed ""La Marquise de Brinvilliers"" in 1831. Meyerbeer, Auber, Halvy, and Offenbach were all effectively disciples of Cherubini in the art of musical comedy. If you've heard Cherubini's ""Mede"" of 1797 -- the only other work of his currently available on DVD -- you can perhaps extrapolate for yourself the degree to which Cherubini more than Mozart foreshadowed the future of tragic opera. It's worth noting that Cherubini's earliest operas were settings of librettos by Zeno and Metastasio, the masters of the Baroque, while his latest pieces were based on dramas by Eugene Scribe, the librettist of works by Donizetti and Verdi.

Critics of his era and musicologists today have maintained that Cherubini's greatest operas were Lodoiska, Les deux journes, and Ladiska, none of which I've had the pleasure of hearing and none of which are available on DVD. I wonder how long we'll have to wait ...",1354147200,,4309,5.179340028694405
8522516,4,B007WB5CDK,"The previous reviewer gave all the information from the booklet, and I have to agree with his positive review. I was a bit concerned when I purchased the DVD, because of previous experiences with Euro-trash productions from Germany, but this one is a VERY well directed and well-staged production. Cherubini's music is delightful, and it often sounds like an early Mozart singspiele [the booklet refers to Haydn's style, but I could not detect any].  The singers do their best in the occasionally quite complex trios and quartets and all of them act well their roles. The costum designer used comical Chinese masks for the chorus, which looks very good, and it adds to the colorful visuals of the stage. All-in-all, my wife and I spent a pleasant two hours watching this opera, and I can recommend it to anyone who likes light operas. Incidentally, the booklet refers to some relation of the opera to the French revolution, but I could not detect anything like that. Cherubini was Italian, and he left Paris during the revolution, while the librettist escaped to London, so it is hard to believe that they would have created a pro-revolutionary opera.",1344729600,3,1151,4.902564102564103
8522517,4,B007WB5CDK,"Luigi Cherubini is, I think, one of the great neglected composers of the Classical age, known now - if at all - for his formal but dramatically near-operatic compositions of Requiems and Coronation Masses as Court Composer during the times of Revolutionary France, but other than Medea his twenty-five actual operas are mostly unheard of and only a few of them actually ever performed.  An opra-comique, Koukourgi is probably not the most representative of Cherubini's dramatic and classical-based works, but it is certainly one of the rarest.  Composed around 1792, the opera - for reasons unknown - was left unfinished and, up until its premiere here at the Stadttheater Klagenfurt in 2010, it had never been previously staged.  The spoken dialogues are lost, but are not difficult to determine from the progression of the plot and have been rendered in German for the Klagenfurt audience, although almost certainly not in the form they take here.  The opera itself however is in the original French, supplemented by an overture taken from Cherubini's Ifigenia in Aulide (1788) and a finale 'Viva Amore' that was an insert composed by Cherubini for a French production of a Paisiello opera.

There is a perception that Cherubini's music is a little bit academic and conventional, with an impeccable sense of melody, counterpoint and situation every bit as delightful as Haydn, but without the spark of genius or originality of Mozart.  There's some degree of truth in that, but at the same time Cherubini is certainly worthy of being considered alongside these two more famous near-contemporary composers.  Koukourgi is indeed a little bit dry and academic in places - a comedy-romance drama set against the backdrop of warring factions - with familiar character types and situations, the obligatory thunderstorm and a spectacular march of soldiers, but it has no great narrative drive that inspires any impressive musical or singing feats.  In its own way however, Koukourgi is a lovely little example of its type, as light and entertaining as a Haydn opera, but with a modest French buffo character that avoids the excesses of the usually more florid Italian singing.

That character is maintained in the Klagenfurt production, delicately played by the Krtner Sinfonieorchester as conducted by Peter Marschik, which sets the tone by having Koukourgi play the part of narrator.  It is unlikely that the character would have performed this role in the original spoken dialogue for the work, but it works effectively in the context here, making asides and confidences to the audience about the opera itself as well as about his own indolent nature, inviting them to laugh along with him at the rather more serious attitude adopted by the other characters in what doesn't really amount to a great deal.  As is often the case with this type of work then, a lot depends on the charm and the delivery of the performers.  Daniel Prohaska has a great deal of fun as the irreverent Koukourgi, but finds suitable companions for his cowardly nature in Daniel Belcher's Scuro and Peter Edlemann's Phaor.  Cigdem Soyarslan's Zulma and Johannes Chum's Amazan meanwhile play the romantic drama wonderfully straight, Amazan ready to fly off to brave all the Tartar attacks without a moment's pause for reflection.

Koukourgi is by no means a major discovery, but it's entertaining in its own right, delightfully staged and performed, and with the scarcity of Cherubini operas available in any form, this is a true rarity that does indeed throw new light on the variety and quality of the composer's work.  It's only available on DVD - no Blu-ray release - but the specifications are excellent, with a clean, sharp widescreen transfer and good audio mixes in PCM Stereo and Dolby Digital 5.1.  The disc is Region-free, NTSC format, with subtitles in French, English, German, Spanish, Italian and Korean.",1340150400,9,3889,5.081632653061225
