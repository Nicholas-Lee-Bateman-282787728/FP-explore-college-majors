Don't get me wrong.  I love martial arts movies.  I've collected them for years.  I can stand some cheese here and there, but this one takes the cake.  Wire-fu, magic relics, super-human and magical moves, instant cures... the list runs the gamot of the typical martial arts fantasy movie gone wrong.

Some of the special effects are pretty cool and the martial artists are good, but the muck of the rest of it pretty much makes this a laughable experience.
