1085874,4,6305897786,"As Polanski has become increasingly reclusive and eccentric, I've often wondered exactly what goes through his head when he decides to film something. I've been wondering it more and more over the last two decades or so, as what little output Polanski has released has become increasingly  humorless, bitter, and savage, culminating in the brilliantly unstable  Death and the Maiden in 1994. Something seems to have happened in the past  six years, however. Polanski has given us his finest, and funniest, film  since The Fealress Vampire Killers-- and for much the same reasons.

There is a subgenre of film, mostly horror film (but a good number of  what can only be termed ""men's adventure"" flicks also fall into  this category), that can best be described as ""fuzzy."" Everything  about them is fuzzy. The focus is just a tad off. The soundtrack sounds as  if it has been recorded through a wad of cotton. The color is a little off.  You know the genre. Karen Black is probably its most enduring star, and  Dario Argento has directed about eight hundred fuzzy flicks. Many people  see fuzzy and translate to low-quality, thus dismissing a whole subgenre of  often brilliant filmmaking-- Argento, Lucio Fulci, Carpenter's early work,  Wes Craven, early David Lynch, etc. But we often forget where the original  fuzzy came from. Coppola and Corman got together for the classic Dementia  13 (1963), right in the middle of Polanski's trilogy of distressing imagery  (Knife in the Water, The Beautiful Swindlers, and Repulsion). It is  probably from these four films, and their styles of production and  direction, that this whole subgenre came about, and its first true champion  recognized by a wider audience was yet another Polanski all-star  extravaganza, Rosemary's Baby (1968).

In The Ninth Gate, Polanski,  who has a lot more money now, has given us the epitome of what makes fuzzy  filmmaking great, but he's ramped up the budget, attracted fantastic  starpower and the highest quality of production, and essentially made a  great seventies satan-worshipper film (remember Ernest Borgnine in The  Devil's Rain? Heh...) in the new century. Johnny Depp plays Dean Corso, a  rare book mercenary of sorts, hired by the shifty-eyed Boris Balkan (Frank  Langella) to track down the two other remaining copies of a book Balkan now  owns. Balkan is convinced that, of these three books, one is an authentic  copy and two are forgeries, and Corso's job is to discover which is the  actual tome in question (and, one can assume from Balkan's persona, to  switch the fake with the authentic one, assuming Balkan has a fake).

The truth, of course, is nowhere near as simple as this, and as Corso  goes on his journey, attended by the breathtakingly beautiful nameless  stranger (Polanski's present spouse, Emmanuelle Seigner) and a few people  seemingly less concerned with Corso's welfare (Lena Olin, as the widow of  the original owner of Balkan's copy of the book in question, and her  bodyguard/hired hand/whatever, an unnamed character played by a chap I've  never seen before).

The Ninth Gate also falls into another subgenre  of film, and it doesn't have a name, but when you see the film, it  immediately bears comparison to others of its type-- films that there are  two kinds of viewers for, those who will willingly suspend all possible  belief and enjoy the hell out of it, and those who just won't get it. The  film that springs immediately to mind, of course, is The Blair Witch  Project, but that's only because of recency; Cronenberg's masterpiece of  twisted illusion, Videodrome, is a much better comparison when all is said  and done. Similarly to Videodrome, the viewer is always given the sensation  that something is a little off, and that perhaps the real action is always  going on somewhere just off camera; Depp is embroiled in the same kind of  seemingly-predestined confusion as Woods (and it helps that both have this  odd woman following them around and showing up in the oddest places-- in  Woods' case, Debbie Harry was the vixen in question). If you thought  Videodrome was a fantastic piece of work, and that James Woods turned in  the performance of his career, you'll probably walk out of The Ninth Gate  feeling exactly the same way I did about it--""wow.""

There's  been a lot made, in the press, of the pace of the movie. ""Johnny Depp  runs around Europe looking for old books."" Sure. If you go into a  Roman Polanski flick expecting something that could have been cut from the  same cloth as the Friday the Thirteenth movies, you're bound to be  disappointed. Polanski is a master of the atmospheric horror film, where  the horror is more suggested than splattered, as Rosemary's Baby,  Repulsion, and Death and the Maiden are tribute to. Nothing less should be  expected from The Ninth Gate, and Polanski delivers on all counts. This  isn't a scary film so much as it is a disturbing one, suspenseful at times  (only one car chase, thankfully!), and laugh-out-loud funny at others.

Special consideration, come this time next year, should probably be  given to sound and sound effects editing (the ambient soundtrack to the  film is one of the better ones of recent years-- if The Haunting had had  this music, it would have been almost watchable) and Best Supporting Actor  for a person who usually stays behind the camera, Jose Lopez Rodero, in a  double role as the Brothers Ceniza. He-- they-- are one of the film's many  highlights, despite their small role. Cinematography here is wide and  brilliant, as well; Polanski takes us on a whirlwind trip through some of  Europe's most picturesque spots, including the backstreets of Portugal  (where the Cenizas' shop lies) and a stunning collapsing villa that is the  home of Victor Fargas, one of the other owners of the book in question  (played handily by Jack Taylor, best known for acting in those  aforementioned men's adventure titles in Italy). Depp probably still won't  get his well-deserved Best Actor nomination, and his role doesn't really  warrant it, though the panache and humor he brings to it make it that much  the finer; it wouldn't be too much of a surprise to see Polanski up for  either Director or Adapted Screenplay, however.

It's probably not for  everyone....",961286400,6,6277,4.935762224352828

1085877,4,6305897786,"This new Polanski movie is absolutely gorgeous and well worth seeing on the big screen. One should be aware, however, that the last 10-15 minutes  undo what much of the movie has built up to. Don't go expecting everything  to fall into place because you won't get it.
Johnny Depp is excellent as  Mr. Corso, a proclaimed ""mercenary"" of the rare book world. His  comic timing gives this movie an edge of irony that could have been  obfuscated by a less talented actor.
The film is inquisitive and  ethereal. The camerawork is extremely well-controlled and framed. This  movie felt like reading one of Umberto Eco's novels - foreign travel,  elements of the supernatural, and cabalistic groups abound and add interest  to the developing story.
I won't spoil the end of the movie but I will  say that I felt slighted. There is a sort of weird double climax in the  final minutes of the film that doesn't leave the audience with anything to  ponder other than ""why?"" There is no final statement or  understanding which comes as a result of wither of the climaxes - which is  why this falls short of a five-star rating in my book.
See it and enjoy  it. I can't wait for the DVD. Hopefully Roman will give us a little insight  into what he was trying to do.",952992000,,1251,4.517857142857143

1086087,5,6305897786,"This is a superb supernatural thriller based on the engrossing short story ""The Club Dumas"" by Arturo Prez-Reverte.

It's a pleasure to see Johnny Depp being cast in a movie wherein he is provided with an opportunity to showcase his considerable talents in a role that permits him to reveal a more serious side of both his acting abilities and an insight into the deeper regions of his own psyche.

He can effortlessly and adroitly navigate a wide range of rolls that demand the talents of an exemplary actor; his role of Dean Corso, a mercenary wheeler/dealer of rare books, provides a  welcome relief from the silliness of more recent productions such as Pirates of The Caribbean, Alice in Wonderland and Charlie and The Chocolate Factory; not to be confused with the film, Chocolat in which he succeeds admirably in a supporting role.

Frank Langella delivers an exemplary performance as the millionaire Boris Balkan, an even more ruthless character who is an avid collector of obscure books on occult practices.
Corso is contracted by Balkan to search for and retrieve a series of identical tomes of the dark arts, which are reputed to have been penned by a renaissance period acolyte of Lucifer, under direct tutelage from the devil himself.

Lena Olin who can always be counted upon to deliver a decisive and consummate performance in any role she is given, is perfectly cast as an equally unscrupulous and steel willed adversary of Balkin and any obstacle that challenges her quest to retrieve a copy of the nefarious book that was once in her possession but, unbeknownst to her, sold by her husband to Boris Balkan.

The supporting cast members are equally adept at portraying the owners of the various copies of the book, all of which when brought together; contain vital clues to solving an elusive puzzle which is key to revealing the true intent of their ultimate reunification.

The illustrations are imaginatively evocative of the carved wood print engravings by the famed German renaissance artist Albrecht Drer and are inspired by Tarot/Tarocchi card imagery.

Emmanuelle Seigner creates a sufficient portrayal of a young woman of mysterious and unknown origin who is a covert guide and protector of Corso. Her character is not pivotal but important nonetheless.
Ms. Seigners demeanor is curiously impartial for the most part, although she does convey an undercurrent of determination and the combination of these two qualities help to underscore the mystery of her presence and purpose.

The production elements are suitably created with measured and convincing realism including scenic shots of locales and interiors; some of which are recognizably authentic, although altered for the films purposes.

Overall, this a very entertaining film, especially for those who enjoy really well produced movies concerning the occult with an emphasis on Tarot divination and artwork.
The film handles the subject matter with a high benchmark of integrity and never insults the viewers intelligence.",1488585600,4,3005,5.151950718685832

1086166,5,6305897786,"Despite some of its gothic surface trappings, Polanski's brilliant and delightful 'The Ninth Gate' is decidedly NOT a horror film. Rather, it is both an occult fantasy and a bibliographic detective story with a leavening touch of dark humor. And it is that latter element which makes it a perfect trilogy with Polanski's 'Rosemary's Baby' and 'The Tenant'. But the one element that sets it apart from Polanski's other films, as well as most other films I've seen, is its central plot. For how many films can you think of which co-star a BOOK?

That's right. A book.

For the film's title is derived from the ancient tome to which I refer -- the fictional 'Nine Gates To The Kingdom Of Shadows' (think Lovecraft's Necronomicon). And it is this elusive and ultra rare volume, as well as one of its three owners, Boris Balkan (a suavely sinister Frank Langella), that sends Johhny Depp's dubious Dean Corso (he's wonderful in this role) on a globe-hopping quest to secure the other two volumes by hook or by crook. Mostly crook.

For Dean Corso is a rare book detective whose loyalty can easily be purchased by the highest bidder. And purchase it Mr. Balkan does, sending both the plot and the film into motion, masterfully and wittily controlled by Polanski.

Other elements too good not to be acknowledged are the various supporting performances. From the aforementioned Langella, to a wickedly and insouciantly seductive Lena Olin, to the various characters Depp's literary sleuth encounters on his travels -- every one of these a gem -- this film is an embarrassment of riches. Like a more accessible 'Eyes Wide Shut', and with certain aspects of the classic 'Night Of The Demon', the film's central character moves from essential innocence to knowing experience, and, as a result of his adventures and discoveries, ends up in a very different place from where he began.

Filmed in various picturesque cities, the film also benefits from its fine sets and atmospheric locations. And the cinematography and memorable score are also essential elements in this carefully paced, playfully naughty puzzle-toy of a film.

Adapted from a complex novel ('The Club Dumas') Polanski wisely decided to jettison one of the book's central plots entirely and concentrate instead on just one of them -- the search for a book which is supposed to have been co-authored by none other than his Dark Majesty, Lucifer himself.

Any further surprises that await in this deliciously enjoyable film I shall not give away here. But, suffice it to say, this is a rich and rewarding cinematic adventure which will repay repeated viewings. And a marvelous bonus is the superb commentary track which Polanski provides here -- one of the best and most informative director commentaries I've had the pleasure of listening to in its entirety.

Intrigued? Then purchase this at once. You won't be disappointed.",1477008000,11,2879,4.983333333333333

I'd say, read the book. If you've already read it, read it again. Skip the movie.",1476144000,,393,4.614285714285714

POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD

Consider this film is not about summoning the devil, but perhaps of achieving enlightenment. Careful consideration of each scene and each card/page hint the idea. This playful film becomes more enjoyable once considered, and then appreciation for Polanski's cleverness deepens.
Union of opposites is necessary to achieve enlightenment; the incomplete deck causing Balkan to fail* was rigged by the twins and protected by....

The woman

Balkan is more the devil, Corso the inquiring fool**, aided by....

The woman

Who perhaps represents Corso's inner self, his companion; she does not possess objective existence beyond Corso himself.

The woman always gifts the ""apple"", received from the serpent of wisdom; why? Because she achieves it first.

1086270,5,6305897786,"What is poignant about the Ninth Gate is it a kind of antithesis to all those films whose protagonists run around the world , trying to put out of context Biblical passages together in order to discover some secret code that heralds the end of the world or something like that. In the case of Roman Polanski's film. the secret code is hidden in books written in collaboration with the Devil himself. Johnny Depp plays Dean Corso, a dealer and buyer of rare books who having taken on a commission for Boris Balkan ( Frank Langella) confronts not only murder but his own self. Blase  and non-chalant except about conniving to get a book at his price, Corso finds himself in the thick of Devil worshiping aristocrats who will stop at nothing to invoke Satan believing that it will equate them with God.  The farcical nature of these ""bored millionaires"" tells the audience quite clearly that none of these buffoons including Boris Balkan are ever going to unlock the secret of the Ninth Gate. That dubious honor goes to Corso, the self serving, misanthrope who is chosen, quite literally, by having been marked in blood by the Whore of Babylon herself. In the end, it is Corso who unlocks the gate and the final scene shows him headed for the inevitable enactment of his destiny.  The Devil's greatest disciples are those who are dispassionate about life . The film is filled with symbolism , upon which nobody seems to agree but that makes it all the more compelling. The Ninth Gate is an incredibly underrated film which bears more watching. If only to get your brain cells moving again.",1462665600,8,1586,4.67741935483871

I was engaged almost 100% of the time. It's an entertaining mystery with unconventional elements, not quite gothic, but perhaps contemporary gothic. I was sufficiently amused because of the cinematography, the cast, and the pace of the film. I actually took off one star just because of one part of the ending, but the ending is not a complete mess to say the least. Definitely the type of flick to watch when craving something different and I when you can stand a sense of fright.",1462492800,,869,4.8

Supposed book professionals handling and storing extremely rare books carelessly seemed like pretty large oversight--but that's not the silliest detail of movie, I assure you. Hiding 500 year old book behind hotel fridge seemed silly--the hotel has a safe, you know.

The ending is either very un-Hollywood or annoyingly Hollywoodesque, depending on how you look at it. I was merely annoyed that the film ended at all, wanted it to keep going for another hour. But throughout the entirety of the film I'm not annoyed, and I think this is why it has become one of my favorites. We need more adventure films made by people who give a hoot about the craft of film. Thanks, Polanski! Johnny is good here; he fits the role and the relaxed pace like a glove.

Car fans get thrown a bone thanks to a Dodge Viper that gets featured prominently towards the end. A Viper being driven in Europe at the time must have been quite the sensation. Very cool.

It's like someone told him to do an impression of him not acting very well. He's much better than this, and he must have fallen for the allure of working with Polanski, then realized it's likely all a load of bull.

1087046,3,6305897786,"Because I love antiquarian books and occult themes (mainly for kitsch value, not seriously), I was eager to see this but knew it got bad reviews initially. By now, you may know it's not an action movie, but instead is a slowly building thriller that is somewhat reminiscent of Val Lewton's occult thriller ""The 7th Victim"", which also portrays occultists as quiet academic types (which is probably true, unless you count death metallers). The cinematography and music are beautiful, and it plays like a european travelogue. (Rick Steves' Transylvania?) It took me a while to get accustomed to the stilted dialogue and one-dimensional characters, and about a third into the movie I did get bored because it seemed like it was taking too long to go nowhere. Then the payoff scene with black satin robes and pentagrams and burning castles came upon me- FINALLY!

It's an unusual film, and the imagery is pretty cool and the frequent use of woodcut engravings of occult images (some tarot-inspired) was great. It's basically a mood piece with occult themes; not really scary at all, and certainly not for gorehounds. I didn't seek it out for gore or horror, so I was not disappointed, but for fun occult kitsch, I'd go with ""The Craft"" instead- that one really delivers. This has more erudite pretensions; I can't take that seriously enough but I did enjoy this even if my mind wandered partway through.",1460160000,3,1399,4.878151260504202

1088205,3,6305897786,"A small film with a rather big budget travelling from New York to Spain (more or less not famous places) and to France, Paris of course. A film about the Devil or Satan or Lucifer had to be produced in the satanic year 1-999, just before the diabolical new millennium.

Apart from that the plot is so light we could think it was bought as a premium in a barrel of washing powder. The only interesting element is the suspenseful editing that makes the film have good rhythm. But the rhythm of the editing is not enough to make a good film.

Clichs upon clichs. The best ones are the baroness in a wheel chair with a secretary that looks like a prison warden and goes out in the morning to buy oranges. The younger desk clerk in a four or five stars hotel in Paris who is authorizing a woman to go to the main characters room because she claims to be his wife. The concierge will apologize later on but it will be too late. I guess that younger desk clerk had not gone through the proper vocational training.

The best clich is the fact that the devil is a woman, white of course and blonde of course again. She is s devilish person obviously since she can move around without any means of transportation except thin  air. But she is the excuse for Polanski to put some female flesh on the screen. He is a lot more modest about male flesh. Why did he get Johnny Depp then? A fatso like Depardieu would have been just alright, and a lot more impressive.

Johnny Depp is underused indeed. He is static, unexpressive, cold like a slithering snake, badly dressed and hardly human.

Well enjoy it if you can. I guess with a good shot of vodka maybe. . .

I will not reveal any other facts except for the mysterious woman that seems to take a special interest in him. Very creepy watching Depp go from being simply slimy to downright evil & murderous.

1088409,4,6305897786,"Supernatural horror and antiquarian books have interesting overlaps. There is something mystical about ancient and medieval books, especially those with covers which look like medieval doors, potentially unlocking mysteries within. For many centuries, books were regarded as far beyond mere utilitarian objects for the transmission of information. They were seen as carriers of secret wisdom of the ancients and even powerful transmitters of taboo knowledge. The Book of Kells, produced in the 8th century, was regarded as a holy item with divine power. ""The Ninth Gate"" fuses the world of antiquarian books within the genre of supernatural horror.

Loosely based on Arturo Prez-Reverte's novel ""The Club Dumas"", the story concerns Dean Corso (Johnny Depp), an amoral book scout and dealer who trades in antiquarian books, predominantly those printed prior to 1800. These tomes are quite distinct from the modern hardcover editions published today in millions of copies. Each copy of an antiquarian book produced pre-1800 had to be hand-printed on presses and hand-bound. They are found in leather and vellum bindings, some of them commissioned by the nobility. The paper used in older books is of a superior quality than today, making them desirable to a number of eclectic collectors willing to pay large sums to acquire these treasures. Corso, often using deceitful tactics which would make used car salesmen seem like saints, attains these items and resells them for hefty sums to moneyed albeit eccentric collectors. In an early scene, Corso over-appraises a rare book collection (called high-balling) in order to attain a sought-after set for cheap. (For those of you who know about antiquarian books, the set is actually the so-called ""Ibara Don Quixote"", printed in 1780. Although not a first edition, the Ibara Don Quixote is regarded as the finest edition of Cervantes' novel ever published, with engravings by the best artist of Spain at the time.)

Corso is then hired by Boris Balkan (Frank Langella), an eccentric scholar and high-end book collector obsessed with the supernatural, the occult, and the underworld. (It is not uncommon for wealthier book collectors to hire book scouts as agents to find particular editions.) Balkan reveals to Corso his rare book collection which has an interesting focus: antiquarian books whose subject is the Devil. However aside from the many hundreds of volumes of books in leather and vellum, there is one recent acquisition which is Balkan's prized possession: a particular 17th-century book called ""The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows"". According to Balkan, ""The Nine Gates"" is a book of spells written by the Devil himself, and if used correctly can be used to summon the Devil in person. The book was printed in 1666 (of course) and features medieval-like woodcut engravings on nine of its pages preceding each of its chapters or ""gates"". Only three known copies are extent, according to Balkan, and he wants Corso to tract down the other copies in antiquarian libraries in Europe. (Unlike the Ibara Don Quixote, ""The Nine Gates"" is not a real 17th century book, as far as I know.)

So begins a suspense-thriller in which antiquarian libraries and supernatural horror become unlikely bedfellows. During Corso's travels, he meets eccentric characters whose only commonality is their love for ancient, medieval and renaissance books. Shortly after Corso accepts Balkan's assignment, the widow of the man who owned The Nine Gates makes an unexpected call, wanting the book back, claiming her husband would never have sold it to Balkan. There are Spanish twins who repair and sell such books, often allowing their cigarette ash to fall on the covers of books hundreds of years old. He encounters a collector who views his books like children. And there's a wheel-chair bound old woman who takes an immediate disliking towards Corso, questioning his intentions.

This film may be the only one of its kind in cinema to tour the world of antiquarian books and their corresponding collections. Differences between copies from the same edition, called states, are also explored, a detail of book collecting which may not have ever been demonstrated in another film in English. While art collectors, collections, and heists receive far more cinematic treatment, antiquarian books and collectors exist underneath the radar. Certainly not for all tastes, and only about 50% of Arturo Prez-Reverte's novel, ""The Ninth Gate"" is still a fun fresh horror-suspense thriller and not to be missed if you're a bibliophile. If you also like horror books, this film is definitely a treat in its original first edition.",1428105600,3,4657,5.221925133689839

1088469,5,6305897786,"Think what you like about director Roman Polanski, he is definitely capable of creating things of beauty. In this movie he draws on all sorts of sources: the allure of medieval woodcuts; the strange serenity of a centuries old ruin in the French countryside; Lena Olin's mastery of raw sexuality;  Emmanuel Seigner's fresh, angelic face, which serves to mask at first a fierce strength at the heart of her performance; and a story that feels like a powerful hybrid of Alfred Hitchcock, Umberto Eco and Dario Argentoit's sourced off a novel by Arturo Prez-Reverte that I now HAVE TO READ!!! And let's not forget Johnny Depp's endless well of character acting schtick. His character here is a wonderful noir nebbish who provides priceless, fleeting little gems of physical comedy even in the middle of the most tense of scenes without ever detracting from this movie's dark and grim power. For those gorehounds who thrive on and adrenaline rush, you might want to tank up on a Mountain Dewski before watching the first part because the moments of action are few and far between, although they are there and quite effective.

When Chandler was asked by the film makers ""Who did it?"" while they were making The Big Sleep, he famously replied that he had forgotten--it wasn't important. This is a movie to sit with and enjoy--like smoking a cigarette and admiring the binding and beauty of a finely crafted book. It's not a page turner to keep you entertained.

1088693,3,6305897786,"Putting aside, for a moment, his 1977 sex crime warrants, Roman Polanski is an amazing film director (see ""Chinatown."") In fact his reputation is how he got his leading man ( his reputation as a director, not a sex offender). Johnny Depp took much less than his usual asking price simply because Depp wanted to work with the man. Depp plays a flawed Book detective hired to find a rare book that happens to be Demonic. By Subject matter the 9th Gate feels like it would have been at home on the 70's with its Occult conspiracies, behooded Devil worshippers and spooky semi-Biblical femme fatales (but so does Roman Polanski come to that).
The film is based in part on novel by best-selling Spanish author Arturo Prez-Reverte. It's fairly underrated on the whole as it has some great moments and tension mounts as Depp as Dean Corso gets more and more over his head while unpuzzling this puzzle, which you may need to watch twice if you went to the kitchen for a beverage.

1089169,4,6305897786,"The Ninth Gate works as a part detective, part thriller with overtones of the occult. Johnny Depp, in a very interesting role, plays Dean Corso, who is essentially a book detective that freelances in appraising and finding rare works. A wealthy, high profile client asks Corso to travel to Europe in search of 2 extremely rare books of a 3 book set, one of which he already has. But what happens on his journey may not be worth the money after all.

Not since Rosemary's Baby has Polanski made a picture this eerie. Though not as committed, the film could have been aesthetically darker and more stylized from a visual standpoint. The movie also could have easily gone on without the addition of the mysterious 'Girl' character, who left questions and more to be interpreted by the audience.

Frank Langella was probably the single most important ingredient to the overall success in the macabre ambience of the film. The operatic score (which I thought was even a little under-utilized) also helped round out a demonic path for this movie. As a persuasive thriller about demonology expect to be intimidated.",1399939200,2,1108,4.857142857142857
1089234,5,6305897786,"To start, I would like to express my confusion as to why many people would consider this a boring movie. It would seem many people do not have the attention span to sit down and watch an intelligent movie. I love the occult and horror films. While this is not scary, it does hold some rather creepy moments that keep you wondering. I have taken questions to the internet and many others like myself have gathered to explain the unexplained in this film.
  This is truly one of my favorite films. It is directed by Roman Polanski, no less (Director of Rosemary's Baby). I can understand people disliking this film due to its complex nature in the occult. If you don't like or study such things, then yes, full enjoyment of such a film may not be acheived. We all enjoy movies we can relate to after all. I, personally, would rate this film a 9 out of 10.

Personally I love religious thrillers because they speak to an innate fear most everyone has had drilled in their subconscience from childhood.  So to me, if I'm really looking for a scare this genre is the route I go.  It's an older film so the few special effects that are in the film leave a lot to be desired by 2014's standards.  Overall, I would say this film was, above all else, interesting.  You feel immersed in the secluded world of black market book-dealers, so much so that by the end I wished I was a obscenely wealthy polyglot that collected rare books.  But really folks, isn't that what movies are for?  So while this movie didn't win any awards and may have an ""occult"" feel to it, I thought it was good fun.

PROs:
 currently free with Prime
 directed and produced by Roman P.
 shot in France, Spain, and Portugal
 neo-noir style
 decent cinematography
 satirical at times

CONs:
 plot is thin and drags on
 too difficult to suspend disbelief, almost not worth trying
 apathy about protagonist's fate
 it could have been a half-hour shorter
 can't decide if i just wasted 2+ hours",1391817600,2,580,4.855670103092783

This movie is too long and drawn out, for the most part boring, as Depp's character is hired to track down original copies of the Satanic Bible in order to find the clues on how to open the 9th gate.

Very boring, very predictable, and drags on way too long. If you can not get enough of Depp on screen doing anything, then yeah, pay more attention to the higher rated reviewers comments, other wise, don't bother. It's not a suspense, it's hardly a thriller, and the mystery is seen coming a mile away, they didn't exactly try to hide much for a surprise ending.

No Rosemary's Baby this, Depp made little effort to react to the material, turning in a bland performance of measured indifference.  It's hard to believe that the same director who gave us Rosemary's Baby, Chinatown, The Pianist and Repulsion could have created a laughable film that with a little more effort and some script revision could have spawned deliberate laughs, as was the case in The Fearless Vampire Killers.

He's chased and threatened by various sinister types, and he's also being tracked by a mysterious beauty (Emmanuelle Seigner) who may or may not be...an angel. Hmmm. Okay. This all ends up in a creepy castle tower where--well, see for yourself. Again, hmmm.

I love Roman Polanski's films. He always finds interesting stories and tells them in interesting ways. That said, I must admit that THE NINTH GATE is odd and a bit silly. Based on a portion of Arturo Perez-Reverte's wonderful novel, THE CLUB DUMAS, it isn't nearly as gripping as the book. But it's still a fascinating experiment in cinematic storytelling. If you're a Polanski fan, try it and see what you think. Recommended (with reservations).",1389484800,,1002,4.725714285714286

1090811,4,6305897786,"There are movies that transport an actor or actress into super-stardom or at lease sudden interest, even if only on the part of casting directors; I usually don't think they are the same vehicles that everybody else does. For instance, it was My Best Friend's Wedding for Julia Roberts, Winter's Bone for Jennifer Lawrence, True Romance for Brad Pitt imho.

I really never got the appeal of Johnny Depp until I saw the current movie under consideration, The Ninth Gate. He's gaunt, delicate, selfish, and pretty smart. Not only that, but the movie is directed by Roman Polanksi. Forget Rosemary's Baby; I think Polanski only did that for the entre, and the money of course. For me, his signature piece is Chinatown. But he returns to the occult a la Rosemary's Baby with much of the finesse of Chinatown.

I'm not going to go into too much detail but if you're looking for a theater-seat gripping slasher film, don't bother. Personally, I think the movie is far more deeply scary ... it seems to threaten to do the very thing the holy grail, using that term loosely, which everyone in the movie is seeking is supposed to do. Sorry to be so cryptic, trying to avoid spoilers. The pace is slow, yes, but I found it thoughtful ... very involving. Polanski seems to take care with every detail of the film, too, down to the reflections in Depp's glasses.

If you're a literary type who can sit still to read a book for a while, this movie may be for you, not the least of reasons being that it is about rare book collectors and sleuths. It perhaps disappoints at the end with an ending that may raise more questions than it answers but could stir debate. If you give it a chance, I think you'll be more affected by it than you originally thought.",1389398400,,1742,4.523809523809524

Then the rare book expert finds his partner dead and just leaves him there in the store?  He then jets over to Europe and lucks into finding ALL the other copies! Incredible luck! But they all seem to be different in some way.  His traveling companion (the girl) manages to tag along everywhere he goes, and he just lets her without getting a good explanation of who she is exactly. The rich eccentric ends up torching himself in a huge abandoned castle. Plus, I never DID find out why the original owner hanged himself at the beginning of the story.

Initially I like Johny Depp's character but Depp's character is kind of confuse and certain decision made by him doesn't seems to be understandable like he decides to travel Europe though he smells danger surrounded with his task. It would have been great if director would have thrown some details on Corso's (Depp) priority whether its money, safety or exploration of ages old devil books. Corso wanted to cease this mysteriously risky task assigned by Balkan but he keeps on digging into it for no reason. Movie does not give you answer or clue about why Balkan wanted to check authenticity of other two book. Other two book owner dies after comparison of Balkan's book, if we accept this as a devil mystery then why Corso who carries book all the time does not get killed. There is a guardian angel for Corso but she saves him only from Liana and her hitman. There are many points which weakens script which otherwise would have been strong.

It will be confusing the first time you watch but every time you watch it again it will make more sense and you will get another view of the films real meaning. It is definitely a dark movie and delves into the occult. You need to be able to view it when you have no distractions and can concentrate on the movie. I have seen it at least 10 times and still get something new from it every time I watch..you too will get hooked! All of my friends I have recommended it to love it! And No, HE is not the dark prince.......keep watching it will click!",1388361600,,696,4.162962962962963

1091118,5,6305897786,"This is an entertaining movie....a bit on the ""dark"" side, and occasionally a bit slow, but overall I find myself watching it whenever it comes on, which is always an indication that I haven't tired of it yet.

Johnny Depp, no stranger to dark thrillers, once again comes through in his thoughtful portrayal of a somewhat shady rare book dealer on an unusual quest, hired from an intimidating character played beautifully by Frank Langella.

Aside from these two major players, the remainder of the demure cast does a fairly good job; the ""body guard"" has enchanting eyes, but it's a bit difficult to get through her heavy accent.

The story is unique and somewhat interesting.  The script has ups and downs, but basically Depp pulls the plot together - without him cast in the lead I'm afraid it might not have been my cup of tea.  I enjoyed following until the end when all of the pieces fell together, however the actual last scene seemed a bit anti-climatic for my taste.

Not my favorite Johnny Depp movie, but it certainly is worth a two hour investment of your time.",1388275200,,1073,4.650793650793651

In my youth I actually carried a VHS copy with me as I travelled this country, showing it to as many people as I could...I hope watching it brings you the joy that fills me every time I see it - which is as often as I can.

1091629,5,6305897786,"I have always enjoyed Johnny Depp's work! He is a unique actor who provides great depth to scenes through his expressions as well as his portrayal. That is never more evident than in ""The Ninth Gate"". A combination mystery thriller with just a hint of the supernatural that grows during the story to be the climatic confrontations.

If you consider the movie for your entertainment just be aware that there are some nudity and sexual situations that really do not detract from the mystery story but certainly must have added a factor that greatly added to Depp's enjoyment while on the job.

The story itself tends to do what I consider considerable ""over-laying"" and that approach causes the audience (in this case, moi) to have to continually sort out who is who and doing what - but of course that is the very essence of mysteries. The story has a touch of the naivety found in ""Rosemary's Baby"" with the principal character (Depp) being confused by events at every turn while he struggles to succeed in discovering the puzzle pieces and to make the necessary connections to move the story along. At points the story displays turns that really should have called for higher production values than those captured in the film but I am sure the budget and the producers were watching their shekels as always.

Again, if you enjoy Johnny Depp's work as an actor this piece will not disappoint. Just remember the sexual content and the crescendo of the supernatural thread. After all, it is ""The Ninth Gate""!",1386115200,,1506,4.762452107279693

The sets, lighting and locations are well done and the movie seems well edited. The entire production is a subtle yet great work of entertainment if not art. Some touches I liked were the very subtle CGI reflections in the glasses and windows were tastefully done. Many things allowed you to use your imagination to complete a scene much better than any staged act. Roman Polanski is a professional I respect and this work is one of the many reasons why.  Emmanuelle Seigner was most interesting in the movie with her enigmatic role. Divinely worth owning and seeing over and over.",1385942400,,704,4.770491803278689

It feels outdated (not vintage, classic or even retro) as if Polanski hasn't seen any films made in the last few decades before making this and hasn't grown as a film maker like a game developer continuing to build titles for the C64.

It's flat and detracts from the story which could have been compelling and had a good cast. If only they had been captured in a way that had some sort of impact. There were these awkward pauses in the editing that ruined the flow as well as a few cut scenes that made little sense.

The movie poster reflects the appropriate tone, the actual film made me feel like I was watching a Get Smart episode. I was going to stop watching it but kept going through to the end because I was wondering if I'd see some signs that it was meant to be a parody of the genre but that never happened.

Satan mocks those who worships her, if there is such a being. She mocks, as does the movie, the secrecy and rituals behind those who either worship or revile her.

Certainly the most sacred of angels will not let herself degraded with being worshiped by humans. But to hide her purity behind a mask perceived as eternal evil. Yet, she has her desire for a persistent companion.

Companions whose finite lives would help her find her next desired companion. A companion resourceful enough to match the puzzle she and a previous companion had devised. Others fail, except the one she fancies and who fancies her.

Thro the 9th Gate she finds her eternal companion. Perhaps, she is an extraterrestrial. She does not even call herself Satan. It's the myth of Satan the producers are using as decoys to distract the audience. It's not a horror movie. It is an exquisite deliberately misleading movie, using established religious ideas to mislead the audience, into finally realising they are watching an exotic romance movie between a human and an extraterrestrial.

The unsuspecting chosen one whose unsuspecting competing suitors unsuspectingly perform all the rituals for him. Are those rituals actually required to win her heart, or are rituals simply decoys??? AFA the story goes, the rituals also function as pointless impediments towards other suitors besides her chosen. Why 9th? What are gates zero to eight for? They are simply plates of engravings that lead the chosen suitor to obtain the 9th plate/gate, which helps the right suitor identify his lover. Rather, should we say the 9th plate is plate zero, the actual plate he needs to find. Ground zero, towards which the other nine plates would lead the suitor.

Is this her ultimate companion, the only one admitted thro the gate or is he yet another companion who would help her write another set of puzzles? Rather, is that it - the extraterrestrial, the dragon rider, is going home as she's finally found her lover?",1384128000,,2056,4.910662824207493

1092330,2,6305897786,"A rare book expert with grifter tendencies is hired by a billionaire to find the other two copies of a rare Satanic book he owns and to compare them. Why? The billionaire, played by Frank Langella, will only say coyly that he believes that only one copy is genuine; he refuses to say why he believes this. The book expert (Johnny Depp as Frank Corso) doesn't find this credible but is lured in by the huge sum of money he is offered for the task, which becomes increasingly dangerous and confusing. I found this film very disappointing and I will discuss my reasons below, but be warned that there are some spoilers.

Spoiler alert! You've been warned! Like Frank Corso, the character played by Depp, I found this all rather confusing. The film seems oddly flat and lacking in emotion for a horror film. I didn't understand it at all until I saw, on Wikipedia, some comments from the director taken from an interview with Peter Howell for the Toronto Star newspaper: ""I don't believe in the occult...You can make them (horror genre cliches) appear serious on the surface, but you cannot help but laugh at them."" In other words the director wasn't approaching this as a serious horror film but rather as a subtle comedy. The whole thing is comprehensible once you know this, and it occurred to me that the Frank Corso character as portrayed in this film may be most comparable to that of Peter Sellers' brilliant, bumbling Inspector Clouseau: a poor git who is incapable of seeing himself as others see him and is thus unable to understand that the chaos and confusion around him are in fact being caused by him. Ironically the one thing I did like in the film was the music, which was based on the Havanaise in E major Opus 83 by Saint-Saens. My sister commented that a lot of people found it too perky and upbeat (which again is understandable once you realize what the director was doing) but I found it creepy and it reminded me of the theme from Jaws in the sense that it made me think that something horrific really was going to happen. Do I think that the director made a valid film? Yes. Do I agree with his choices? No, and I wonder how the Spanish writer of the original source book (Arturo Perez Reverte, The Club Dumas) felt about the film. I also found myself wondering if the director's choice to subtly mock the whole thing was due to events in his own life. Did the horrific murder of his wife in the 60's leave him feeling that horror is a joke compared to what humans actually do? Did the accusations against the director for misconduct with an underage girl leave him reluctant to probe the idea of evil at all? We cannot know the answers.

I sincerely hope that another director will eventually film this as a genuine horror film because it could be a classic. For example the scene where Boris Balkan pours gasoline on himself and lights it in the belief that he is being transformed into a minion of Satan and is thus unburnable could have been really scary if he had collapsed to a cloud of black ash in the blink of an eye--and if perhaps part of the castle had done the same--but instead we get the director's dry humor as Balkan slowly catches fire, shrieks ""No! Oh, no!"" over and over, and realizes too late that he is the same sort of pathetic boob that he has accused others of being. The scene outside the castle where Corso is seduced by the green-eyed woman--a scene that is arguably one of the least sexy sex scenes ever filmed and where Johnny Depp's facial expressions range from a deer caught in the headlights of an oncoming semi truck, to that of someone who has just been told that he is next going to have a colonoscopy--could have been both sexy and scary. Imagine if the two people had remained in the car and the camera had been outside the car, so that we see only vague shadows in the car but do see articles of clothing being flung out through the open car door and hear the kind of heavy breathing and grunting that would convince us that Corso is becoming the sort of goatish creature we would expect.

Johnny Depp is famous for playing understated roles, and here he plays the ruthless book dealer Corso with a measure of indifference, and yet, his character sucks you into the plot as he ventures deeper into a web of deceit and evil. Frank Langella's Boris Balkan is intellectual and possessed of a greed for forbidden things. Lena Olin as the 'grieving widow' with devilish designs is sexy as always, but nothing more. I found the character of the 'guardian angel' who is always getting Depp out of trouble [played by Polanski's wife Emmanuelle Seigner] to be the most intriguing; her unnerving glances hint at something more sinister under the surface.

This is a story about one man's (Corso) search for a forbidden text, and this search (Balkan tasks Corso with authenticating an ancient occult book purported to be authored by the devil himself) takes Corso to some very dark and dangerous places. The score is worthy of mention as the unsettling music is not only haunting but makes one get the feeling there are malevolent forces at work. Although some reviews found the movie to be plodding, I didn't. Corso's quest takes him into a dark, forbidding world filled with devil worshipers, and a stranger who holds the real key to all his questions. Like another reviewer states here, be careful when purchasing the DVD as not all of them contain a sex scene featuring Depp and Seigner, and this scene is absolutely necessary for understanding the full meaning of the story itself, so be sure to check with the retailer before purchasing the DVD.

Depp is sent to Europe by Langella to investigate the authenticity of two of the only three copies of an 18th Century Latin text written by a man who was burned as a witch for consorting with Lucifer in the book's creation.

1092447,1,6305897786,"I admit I'm not knowledgable in religion or devil-worshipping or anything of that nature so I didn't really understand any of the plot that took place throughout the movie.  It all went completely over my head.  Every single bit of it.  I went in assuming the Ninth Gate would be like the Exorcist- you know, taking horror elements and combining them with suspense- but more modernized, and of course, taken from a different angle so any comparisons to the Exorcist be kept to a minimum.

Instead it's a slow-moving storyline that revolves around Johnny Depp's character exploring dark dingy areas and libraries, reading book after book... and *more* books.  The only suspense a viewer can possibly comprehend are those experienced in religion and know a thing or two concerning the religious-themed lines being spoken.  These unsuspenseful book reading segments last for over an hour and 20 minutes.  It's mental torture for those who've been confused since the beginning of the film.  By the ending I was completely lost and unassure what really occurred.  I see fire in the background so I assume they're in hell.

The suspense never really delivers because the actual plot that builds to these segments never made any sense to me.  This movie was destined to be a letdown for me due to an inability to understand what's even going on (and understand religion for that matter- *all* religions) and I wish I'd known this little fact before going into it.  I think the old man lying dead in the fountain was the lucky one since he realized that only a devil would come up with such a confusing and boring movie, so he knew suicide (or being killed) was the only way to escape.  The other moment of suspense was really oddly executed too- an old lady in a wheelchair going into another room that soon results in an apartment fire.  Strange.  Oh and the old man hanging himself in the beginning?  A devious attempt at luring in viewers, making them assume the rest of the film will be loaded with similar segments.

Another problem is that basically everything Johnny Depp stars in doesn't appeal to me in the least.  The Pirates of the Carribean series is the biggest offender.  Sword swinging and... more swinging.  Puts me to sleep.  Everything he stars in feels overblown to the point of being unwatchable, in both the presentation and storyline.

I'm not used to movies like the Ninth Gate at all, and if someone would kindly make a list of other similar types of films, I'll be sure to write them down and memorize them so I can avoid them like the plague.  Rosemary's Baby is one.  I assume Jacob's Ladder and the Silence of the Lambs are others.  Anymore?  Oh wait, it's mandatory to avoid the Davinci Code too.  Note to Hollywood- make movies easier to understand.  Not all of us are deeply religious.",1371945600,3,2809,4.712525667351129

I am not a raving fan per se of Polanski, while Depp is one of the most engaging actors of our generation. Both deliver their best here, as do a pair of lovely ladies (Seigner and Olin).

I have not read the book (""El Dumas Club"") behind this motion picture, but I have seen The Ninth Gate six times (it's been showing on cable plus I have the DVD) now and it's as enjoyable as ever.

Polanski has done a remarkable job at balancing things here by showing you plenty to spark your imagination, and then letting your imagination fill in certain gaps (including the ending). Nothing short of brilliant.

A bold claim yes, but this is truly the best supernatural film that I have ever seen. An extremely underrated effort, this ranks as one of my favorite films of all time.",1371427200,,911,4.6397515527950315
1092449,3,6305897786,"Let's face it: Polanski has five, maybe six, movies that have brought him fame in his long career, and ""The Ninth Gate"" isn't one of them. While I enjoyed the intrigue and the riddles behind the engravings found in ""The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows"", I didn't care for the ambiguity I felt when the credits rolled up. Polanski has left a few obvious questions unanswered, and based on some of the reviews I've read here, I'm not alone in this boat.

SPOILER ALERT:

To break through my confusion, I had to watch the DVD a few times and read the screenplay. I'm not going to state that I understand the minutiae of TNG, but I think where I'm at in understanding the movie, it's good enough for me.

One big question mark for me and many others was the identity of ""The Girl"" with blond hair. Was she ""The Whore of Babylon"" as some have claimed, or a ""witch"" in league with the Devil? Based on clues I've dug up mostly in the script and what I saw in the film, I'm convinced she is the Devil.

Another unanswered question had to do with Andrew Telfer's suicide. Why did he hang himself? Polanski provides a not-so-obvious clue by using the character of Baroness Kessler to state, ""If he ever finds out what his wife gets up to in these gatherings, he'll probably kill himself."" Moreover, it's my opinion Telfer found out his wife only married him for his money and to further her Satanic pursuits.

There's more but I won't go into it in this review. Half the fun of watching the movie is in trying to figure out what's happening. And that's what Polanski wants you to do. But I think he enjoys trying to be clever and it shows in TNG, but someone should tell him he's really not, and in trying to be clever, he's made the film ambiguous enough where the masses want to tune out.",1370044800,4,1785,4.348348348348348

1092639,4,6305897786,"Any pairing of Roman Polanski and Lucifer is bound to evoke comparisons with 'Rosemary's Baby'. This current offering came along 30 years after that masterpiece, and while 'The Ninth Gate' is not up there with with Polanski's highest tier work, it's a good enough film combining rare books, European flair, and a sense of adventure. The overall feeling evoked during the first half reminds me of a sophisticated 'giallo' along the lines of Dario Argento's best work. Aside from the European flavor, there is a bevy of odd characters, with too much money and odd sexual appetites, combined with a few other shadowy figures. The overall look of the film leans towards late afternoon and twilight hours, which suit the plot perfectly.

Johnny Depp plays New York based book dealer Dean Corso, who is commissioned by wealthy dealer Boris Balkan (Frank Langella), owner of one copy of an exotic manuscript(titled 'The Ninth Gate', naturally), to track down two remaining copies of this work. There are others, with their own agendas, who would also like to get their hands on the remaining manuscripts, which are located in Europe, and provide a setting for some great plot twists throughout Paris and the Iberian peninsula.  Mysterious deaths lead to a double climax, which offers fairly good resolution, but ultimately seems a bit contrived and over-the-top, although it does suggest that Dean Corso's inner soul might become the next portal to the Prince of Darkness.

The acting is generally of high caliber, with Depp and Langella leading the pack. Supporting roles, especially the women, are nicely handled. Had this film been directed by a novice, or someone without Polanski's credentials, it might have served as a career booster. As it is, none of the thespians cut quite the distinctive path that Mia Farrow and Ruth Gordon did in 1968, when Lucifer's bambino came into the world.  Nonetheless, pour yourself a nice glass of Cabernet, watch the sun go down, and enjoy this movie for what it is.

The Blu-Ray picture is nicely defined, but extras on the Blu-Ray disc are identical to the original issue, meaning brief interviews, and a worthwhile Polanski commentary.  If you upgrade (which I did), it will be for the picture quality only.",1360281600,,2244,5.002680965147453

(SPOILER) Corso was hired to compare several books to check for authenticity, but the actual story became how Corso eventually volunteered to become the devil's apprentice - sort of an origin story from the villan's point of view. As I had no idea going in that that was the story's subject, as Corso himself didn't know until the story's end that he would be serving the devil, I liked the way the story unfolded. Though Corso was morally flexible (the story began with him cheating a old sick man out of a valuable collection), I didn't see why the devil would find him so appealing that the devil (she, in this story), would protect Corso until he reached the ninth gate. In other words, except that a movie star played the role, I saw no skill set exhibited that would make Corso so attractive that the devil would protect him, as though he were a valuable commodity. Corso was willing to lie and cheat, but as he is often in the midst of devil worshippers and/or murderers in this story, his behavior, though bad, was lightweight awful when compared to some of the other characters - in other words he didn't seem more evil than the other evildoers, in several instances, he seemed less evil, so apparently, in this film the devil wasn't looking for outright evil.  What characteristics the devil sought then, were not clearly specified, which I didn't like.  Something I did like was how the devil protected her protege; often film villans rat out their team so frequently, the audience wonders how they acquire assistants; it was believable to see a story where the villan takes care of her own.  I  didn't like the way the story ended, with Corso going through the ninth gate - at that point I felt the story was just beginning and I wanted to know his fate.  Also, I didn't understand why Corso wanted to join the devil's team in the end. Corso had sex with the devil right before he joined up, and the audience witnesses that, but the devil wasn't the only person he had sex with in the story, and he seemed to enjoy the other sex as well, so I didn't understand why sex with the devil in and of itself was so appealing that Corso would change his entire way of life.  Story was weak there. Though satan was a character in the film, the film was not at all scary, more a thriller. Overall, I liked the way the story was told - it could have been titled, how I became the devil's apprentice, and I liked that I got to discover that that was the story. After I saw that that was the story, I thought the story should have explained: (1) why did the devil want Corso, and (2) why did Corso want the devil. I think all the actresses/actors did a very good job.",1358035200,4,2756,4.404715127701375

1. It introduced me to the book The Dumas Club which is now on my TBR list. Although I didn't enjoy the film I'm still keen to read the book because it's apparently a literary thriller, which I love. These types of books are notoriously difficult to adapt to the screen as so much of their charm is in language.

2. The cinematography was great. There are some beautiful scenes and images which established the mood for this type of film.

3. The basic set-up was intriguing and had great potential.

4. Johnny Depp is hot.

Now for the negatives, which can be reduced to one word: plot.

After setting up the storyline the plot begins to meander all over the place and by the end the whole thing has become farcical. None of the questions  raised are answered properly, we never know exactly who the mysterious blond girl is or if she's really working for Fargas at all.

While I would never want to try it, trying to connect with the devil seemed an intriguing topic.  What a surprise, when it turns out to be a woman.  I only noticed Johnny Depp in the first Pirate movie, but after that wanted to see all his films, so buy all of them.  I was surprised the film was so cheap.

1092815,2,6305897786,"I'm not a Johnny Depp fan, per se, but I find him to be an interesting actor, if not so great at picking worthwhile movies. Unforunately, as I explore his movies, I seem find one or more scenes in each that are laughable and eye-roll inducing. Case-in-point: the last 12 or so minutes of this movie, especially his last scenes with ""The Girl"" in front of the castle and her crazy facial expressions that I guess were meant to look wanton and evil but just looked foolish.

I didn't think the actress who played ""The Girl"" was very good. She was pretty but not that expressive.

But the things that baffled me the most was the handling of the valuable books. When books are old and valuable, aren't they usually handled with a lot of care, with cotton gloves in hyper-clean rooms in low light to avoid damage their pages? And certainly cigarette smoke and drinks/liquids are not allowed around them either.

There were a few amusing moments, mostly carried off by Depp - that I enjoyed. I wish there had been more of that. I wasn't sure how seriously I was suppose to take the ""Satanic"" angle. It wasn't quite sinister enough to be a horror/thriller but not quite interesting enough for me to be a compelling mystery. Like many other reviewers, I was let down by the ending.

1092872,5,6305897786,"The movie starts with a man committing suicide and he is the one who sold a version of the book to the wealthy book collector. A book dealer is asked to inspect a rare book to verify its authenticity for its owner. The wealthy book collector, Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) shows Corso his book collection focused on the devil and his prize book is The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows, printed in Venice in 1666.

Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) tells the owner that two other copies exist but only one is the original version. The original book was supposedly written by Satan and it contains nine engravings that will summon Satan himself. Corso accepts the job but he should not be trusted. He will lie and cheat to buy rare books at a fraction of their real value. Corso travels to Europe to speak to the other owners and look at their books and try to purchase them and at least get to look at them.

Corso is authorized to buy the real book at any and all costs, even if illegal. Balkan gives Corso a large check to finance his trip and time. Corso's trip proves both to be enlightening and suspenseful. He is seduced, attacked and his friend is murdered in a ritualistic way as depicted in the book.

This is a creepy and suspenseful story. Not each book is identical and perhaps it takes all three to summon Satan. Corso's mission is the basis for the movie and it presents a very good storyline. The acting in the film is outstanding. This really is not a horror film but more of a film about the occult and the beliefs in the devil. It is a deep and dark film that keeps you guessing until the very end.

If you like scary and dark drama films then this is a good one for you to watch. There are no monsters or special effects; it is just a spooky story about raising the devil.",1346544000,,1785,4.287833827893175

1092876,4,6305897786,"Some films are about plot, some about characters, and some about the form, the journey you take.  This is definitely the latter.  Oh, the plot keeps us going, and the characters are all interesting though they never really move forward.  But the craft is there, and it makes this movie worth watching at least once.

Depp is fine as the main character, an amoral ""book detective"".  Frank Langella is wonderful as the millionaire book collector who sets him on his journey.  And Emmanuelle Seigner is wonderful as ""the girl"" - the unnamed companion/protector who provides most of the movie's occult mystery.

And plenty of mystery there is! I'll give a spoiler here: the ending is ambiguous.  A mystery is set up and you really never truly find out the solution.  However, it's so much fun getting to the unsatisfying ending that you may, as I was, feel rewarded by the journey.

And herein lies my warning: please don't go into this thinking that it will be a horror-noir with a satisfying ending like Angel Heart or Lord of Illusions. This film is arguably more accomplished than either of those in terms of sheer craft.  However, it is slower, more deliberate, and WILL NOT ANSWER THE MYSTERY in an overt way as those films did.  But in a very good way it leaves you thinking about the non-answers and asking questions, which, for me at least, was a rewarding experience.

There are flaws: the ambiguity is frustrating at the end. There is no way you can solve what happened given the clues in the actual movie itself (there are a few more clues in the original novel, but that shouldn't count, especially given the divergence of plot).  There are two mostly-boring car-chase scenes. Sometimes characters are a touch stilted, which wouldn't normally be a problem except that Depp is extremely naturalistic here, and the styles clash somewhat.

But, quibbles aside, I'd recommend this film highly.  Not perfect, and not completely satisfying (nor meant to be!) but well worth the journey, even if you never really get to the end.",1342310400,2,2030,4.790229885057471

1092878,5,6305897786,"I like Hollywood blockbusters and they are my usual poison but from time to time I simply MUST take a break and watch something that is NOT Hollywoodian, is not a sequel and doesn't involve too many car chases, superheroes, explosions, laser beams and idiotic scenarios. If you are looking for such a thing, you will not find much better that ""The Ninth Gate"".

To begin, one precision - this is the adaptation of a great novel, ""Club Dumas"" by the Spanish author Arturo Perez Reverte. The book is amazing but very, very hard to adapt to the screen - so Polanski had to make many changes. As the result, you can now watch a great movie and read a great book, in whatever order you like, without being disappointed by one of them.

This movie is about ancient books, people who collect them and people who live by trading them - and it is an amazing thing how passionate this world is. It is a great achievement of Polanski that he managed to keep a very honest pace of events, when placing the action mostly in librairies, bookshops etc. The gallery of persons shown in this movie is, typically for Polanski, made of characters mostly excentrical, frequently upsetting, sometimes very funny, but never, not even once, boring.

This is in large part one Johnny Depp show, and this is a great show. His character (Dean Corso, trader in ancient books) is in this movie slightly less antipatic than in the novel, but clearly he is not a totally nice guy. The way Johnny Depp acts in this movie confirms the impression I had for many years now - he is not only handsome, he is simply one of the greatest actors alive (and doesn't even need dreadlocks and gold teeth to prove it).

Emmanuelle Seigner plays a character that is totally ambigous (she is just The Girl - we never know what is her name) and I will not reveal anything more about her. She is beautiful, mysterious, tempting but distant and she certainly is leading the main hero somewhere. But we do not know where - until the last image. Lena Olin (Liana Telfer) and Frank Langella (Boris Balkan) are other stars of the show - they are supporting characters and appear less on the screen, but they are both very important.

However the real ""hero"" of this movie could only be... a book. This book is called - what else - ""The Nine Gates"" and was written by a heretic alchimist around year 1515. The Inquisition then burned the author with all the copies which was possible to find - and the further we advance in the movie, the most we realise, that for once, for this one time, the Inquisition could very well have done the right thing! You desserve to discover the rest of the story by yourself.

This is an amazing movie. Reading some of the previews below I couldn't understand how you can be bored by it? Thanks to Polanski's unique touch there is more atmosphere in every scene of ""Ninth Gate"" that we actually can take in. There is a pair of extremely handsome and talented actors. There is the discreet but beautiful musical score by Wojciech Kilar. There is a deep and very very dangerous mystery. There is an almost sadistic, totally unsuspected twist towards the end. And there is finally, well hidden in the shadows, one writer, who really doesn't need an agent to take care of his bookwriting career.... See this film!

Oh, and the devil, sort of.

It's much better for it; and none of that fun intertextuality actually came through in the movie.

1092913,4,6305897786,"The physical violence in Roman Polanski's THE NINTH GATGE is so campy and melodramatic it reminds me of. . .Hitchcock.  Polanski is far too superb a filmmaker to half bake the scuffles and fisticuffs unintentionally; to me, it looks to be a throwback to the melodramatic silliness that Hitchcock presented in his films of half a century ago.  I kept waiting for flocks of birds to descend and add to the mayhem confronting our protagonist, but I digress.  THE NINTH GATE is a quirky mixture of suspense, thrills, and a tongue-in-cheek nod to the occult; with Johnny Depp in the lead playing a bewildered and harassed book collector realizing his current gig to authenticate a rare book is approaching the metaphysical realm, this is one fun ride.

Three copies of a very rare, very old, book--a book allegedly co-written by the Dark Lord himself; book ""detective"" Dean Corso (Depp) is hired by an eccentric millionaire (a cheeky Frank Langella) to compare his copy to the other two copies in Europe.  Problem is, people start dying as Corso conducts his investigation--and Corso himself constantly faces deadly peril, only to be saved, again and again, by a nameless femme fatale in need of some shampoo (Emmanuelle Seigner).  Corso is stalked, hounded, assaulted, pursued, and then the copy he's been carrying is stolen.  Corso and his companion in turn pursue the thieves, only to find themselves in a country lair with some serious Beezlebub revelers.  Corso's malevolent employer himself appears at the festivities, retrieves the book, and the true deal with the Devil takes place.  The meaning of THE NINTH GATE is revealed, with Corso experiencing a very close encounter with the dark side.  Depp is eccentric, quirky, dazed, and confused; THE NINTH GATE is a satisfying suspense tale, with a possible tribute to the keystone cops physicality of a bygone era.

1092914,4,6305897786,"Like Polanski's Frantic, this is another thriller of his that I think is highly underrated.  Both have very moody depictions of a dangerous Europe, and are very effective beyond their plot and screenplay.  Frantic is better - tense and intricate - but the Ninth Gate is still pretty great.  It's not a horror movie - very much closer to Indiana Jones or The DaVinci Code.  Sumptuous and shady.  But it does suffer from two major faults.  First is Polanski's characteristic black humor.  From some rather goofy characters to some jarringly silly moments, like when Langella murders Olin and then spooks the congregation, it's Polanski's peculiar touch but here really undermines what could have been a tense dark movie.  The second major problem is just the overblown ending - secret societies in costumes, rituals to conjure Satan - it all tops a serious and sinister thriller with overblown hokum.

Lot of reasons makes the film worthwhile, one of the reasons being, a brilliant performance from the protagonist 'Dean Curso' played with perfection by Johnny Depp. Depp not only easily steps into Curso's shoes but also breathes a lot of life into the character, you can almost read his mind every time and every moment. A similarly stunning performance from Emmanuelle Seigner and Frank Langella who support Depp completely in making this film worth watching more than just once. Watch out for Lena Olin in a brief but an impressive appearance. The film begins in a slow pace but will make you grow more and more curious every moment as the story suddenly takes on a rapid pace and surprises start to come in. In other words 'Ninth Gate' is not a horror film, there is no special effects or monsters rising around, it is a film that will psychologically influence you and make you think. Watch it, it's one of helluva ride and you are sure to enjoy it.",1333324800,,1138,4.502415458937198

The back of the DVD make it sound very interesting; however, the actual viewing of the movie was very boring.  Nothing entertaining happens and the pace is slow.  It is as though everything in the movie falls short.  The characters seem bored with themselves and eachother.  The Corso character who is suppose to be somewhat unethical wants to walk away from the job Balkin hired him to do; yet, seems afraid of Balkin's threats.  Corso appears to be suspicious of everyone since his room(s) have been broken into, his things have been searched, he was attacked at one point; however, he doens't find out any information about his female traveling companion.  I am guessing she is suppose to remain mysterious considering some of her physical traits (I don't want to say too much incase someone wants to see the movie).  Also, the ""mystery"" about who stole the book isn't much of a ""mystery"" and there wan't alot of ""detective"" work done by the characters to find out who did it.

Prez-Reverte crafts wonderful tales and unfortunately most of his book was lost in the movie, and the rest was reduced almost to campy horror. The basic elements of the book are portrayed (gathering the elements necessary to summon the devil) and in the book, it all seemed plausible, yet in the film it was laughable.

1092976,2,6305897786,"The Ninth Gate is a utterly rubbish film from director Roman Polanski. A film that makes absolutely no sense of anykind.
Setting for this satanical thriller is fairly interesting and the team behind this film is talented though. Photographer Darius Khondji does good job behind the camera and succesfully captures the rich coulours of the interesting locations. Films best thing by far is the fantastic score by great Wojciech Kilar, whose composition for this film is atmospheric and eerie stuff of dreams. These two things are the only good things i can point out from this silly film.
Sure, i can see that Polanski has clearly put some of his typical deadpan humour into this one and hardly meant it to be taken seriously, but he does not make it enough tongue in a cheeck to work or serious enough to be taken seriously. Now it is just constantly verging between self-parody and more serious approach. End result is sadly uneven and most of all highly unbalanced.

1092984,4,6305897786,"The Ninth Gate really surprised me. Certainly, its no secret that Polanski is a talented director, but I never imagined anyone could make a half-way decent movie on the subject of satanism. Movies about the occult invariably degenerate into a scene where a bunch of weirdos sit around and chant gibberish. Then if it is really bad, a monster or something will actually appear, and its all down hill from there. If you don't believe me, check out Ghoulies.

What really impressed me about the Ninth Gate was something that many people did not care for: the slow pace of the story. Too many movies staring high profile actors are in such a rush to get to the ending, and the ending more often that not is maddeningly predictable. Also, Johnnie Depp's performance as a rare book dealer was quite solid. In spite of the phoney tufts of grey hair, he didn't really look  like someone in his 40s. But something about his mannerisms and the cadence in his voice actually made him seem older. The other stand out performance was Frank Langellia, who was amazingly good as a wealthy satanist obsessed with collecting occult manuscripts. Emmanuelle Seigner (Polanski's wife) played the mystery girl, Depp's sidekick who occaisionally exhibited superhuman powers. I think the movie would have been better without this character - or at least without any characters having superhuman abilities. Seigner is a fine actress, but this is the sort of role that noone could pull off.

Incidentally, this movie is based on a novel called ""The Dumas Club"". Although Polanski definitely used this book as a starting point, he discarded many characters and scenes and then inserted his own. Even getting away from a strict comparison of character/scene inventories, the tone of the movie was much creepier and mysterious than the book. Almost all references to Dumas and literature were stripped away, while occult elements of the storyline were emphasized. Also, the movie leaves several key questions unanswered, forcing the audience fill in the blanks. For instance, who (in the movie) was responsible for attempting to destroy copies of the Ninth Gate? Or just as importantly, what motivated them to do this in the first place? Unlike many contemporary directors, Polanski appreciates the importance of creating a little mystery for his audience.",1290902400,,2328,5.041558441558442

1093039,5,6305897786,"When The Ninth Gate (1999) was released, the critics that expected more than just a good movie from Roman Polanski (1933), a famous filmmaker who made such a brilliant pictures as Chinatown (1974) and Rosemary's Baby (1968), were disappointed. It is not hard to be a good director: made one good movie, made another, found your place under the sun and your fans. But, if you made one great movie, be aware that your fans won't forgive you for crap in the future and critics will gladly stomp all over you for ruining your own standards.
  In 1999 every a little intelligent person, everyone who watches TV news or reads newspapers knows Roman Polanski if not as famous director but at least as participant of sexual scandal back in 1974. His movies Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby are world renown and still hold high rankings in respectful tabloids.  But scandal reputation doesn't stand on his way to making relatively good movies, write screenplays, and act himself. If there is an example of the person who magnets bad things, that's Roman Polanski. If there is an example of a person who endures and overcomes tragedy with maximum profit, then that's also Roman Polanski. As you can read on [...], the author of Rosemary's Baby, Chinatown, and Repulsion (1965) was born in Poland in 1933; he lived thru terrible Nazi ghetto in Krakow while his parents died in concentration camp. This was just the beginning of the tragedies. Once he finished his movie Knife in Water (1962), after he just married Sharon Tate and moved to the USA with his wife (during the final months of pregnancy), she was kidnapped, tortured and killed by Charles Manson and his henchmen. This event put him out of balance for a long time and in a couple years in 1979 he permanently left the USA because of a lawsuit against him which accused him of violating 13 years-old girl in Jack Nicolson house (he ran away not long before the trial). So by 1999 Polanski is both famous and infamous. His Chinatown (1974) won an Oscar in nomination the ""Best Writing, Original Screenplay"" and 18 other wins amongst 22 nominations. Polanski also likes to act in his movies, mostly in episodes in Chinatown and Dance of the vampires (1967). He's also a brilliant writer. Sometimes he'd write by himself (Rosemary's Baby, Tragedy of Macbeth (1971)) but usually as a co-writer of John Browniohn and Gerard Brach (Pirates (1986), Tess (1979), Frantic (1988), Bitter Moon (1992)). The Ninth Gate was also co-written by Brownjohn and Enrique Urbizy adopting the novel El Club Dumas by Arturo Perez-Reverte. The Ninth gate is almost European movie. All session were made in Paris, Lissabon, and Spain. Maybe that's why the movie didn't make much in the USA. According to The Art and Popular Culture Encyclopedia, the budget of the movie was 38.000.000$ (probably Johnny's toll). Well USA collections are only $18.000.000. It still sad because The Ninth Gate is not a soup opera, but worldwide was better in collections with $58,401,898 so in the end they covered the budget.
  The Ninth Gate is not in the list of top 250 by IMDB as a great movie, which disappoints, but it's in the top 100 of worst movies, which is still something. So what's wrong? In The Ninth Gate Polanski ones again refers to complicated relationship of Human&Devil. It is a hot topic and Rosemary's Baby was a success. But Polanski could not repeat it even thou he took part in writing the screenplay. Not a single critic had anything positive to say about the movie after the release. Some were less rude, like Leah Rozen from People Weekly, who lets us know that The Ninth Gate is the weakest of a genre but is still earns some points for black humor and with Johnny Depp's acting alone he can improve even the silliest of movies; being co-written and directed by Roman Polanski, Ninth Gate adds another page into book of devil after Rosemary's Baby even if not as bright, but still of high rank (Leah 32). Stanly Kauffmann from The New Republic is less patient. He does not like neither Johnny Depp, nor screenplay, nor Seigner, nor anything. Weak character development with no plus to their appearance makes a bad impression of the movie. And his review ends with sentence ""This picture is stupid""(Kauffmann 25). Antony Lane form The Current Cinema says that there is nothing to watch in this movie besides naked Emmanuelle Seigner (Lane 145). Critic from ReelViews also writes the movie is utterly simple and mindless; it leaves no food for thought and looks like a chaotic mix of genres without a proper direction. Next he adds that maybe a bad translation of the novel The Club Dumas by Arturo Perez-Reverte which Polanski adopted for screenplay (Berardinelly). It's interesting that in an interview that Polanski gave after the premier of The Ninth Gate in Poland he doesn't see any negative sides to the movie. He says that the screenplay is perfect, special effects are great and that he knowshow to make a movie better than anyone and he doesn't give a damn about critics: they do their job; he does his (Fuchs).
  Polanski loves his movies like parents love their children. But what about the watchers? Those people who pay money to see this movie, those who make decision to see the movie. It's been 10 years since the movie's release. Are people still watching it? Yes, they continue to watch it and share their impressions and besides. They do not get paid for that, so their opinion is the most valuable and objective. For instance Patrick Galagan finds that regardless of flaws in screenplay and slow pace the movie still has many positive sides.  But at the same time he doesn't forget to point out that tension rises perfectly accompanied by soundtracks and music throughout the movie, simply charming; Patrick also finds comparison with Good acting by Johnny Depp who acts a bastard who cares only about his reward and nothing can possibly stop him from completing the task and collecting it; also Galagan finds that Polanski is following the old Hitchcock's school of classic thriller (Galagan).  Majority like this movie. According to [...] rating, the movie has 6.6 rating and 120 people from 370 who liked to write releases on Amazon.com and ranked it with 5 stars and only 20 gave one star.
  I purposefully haven't read the positive reviews from Amazon because I intended to write a positive review myself. Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is frankly successful and slightly arrogant detective book-seller whose specials is selling and buying very rare books. One of his regular clients Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) has a unique library with rarest foliants which are dedicated to Satan and his traditions. One of these books called The Ninth Gate was co-written by Lucifer himself and according to rumors contains knowledge of summoning the devil (to mention book's release date was in 1666). Apparently, Balkan had tried to use this book to provoke Lucifer. That unpleasant subject (why Balkan needs it is for everyone to wonder, but well... who'd resist summoning Satan and chat with him) but he got nothing. Balkan knows there are two more editions of the book somewhere and while he isn't sure his book is an original he gets Dean to take his version and compare it to others. Large fortune is offered for this job and Dean agrees to carry out the task with all due haste, although his regular life of cynical rare book-hunter starts to crumble due to various events occurring around him and the books (such as murderers). But that isn't Devils toll yet. It just happens there are other people who'd loved to dial Lord of Lies on cell phone. In search of two other copies Dean sets off to Europe and finds two other owners. In his investigation he realizes that all three books are originals and differ from each other only in graviours. And on top of that some of them have initials that refer to Lucifer. In order to get a full picture you have to have all three books and all of the pictures in them. But all of a sudden a big fuss starts around Dean and the books where he's being targeted, other owner's getting killed, some green-eye Girl ( Roman Polanski's wife  Emmanuelle Seigner) who is part-time guardian-angel whose identity of intentions remain secret. There is no point telling of what happens further or it won't be interesting to watch the movie, so let's talk about what it looks like.
  The Ninth Gate is a very slow movie but it makes a good mystic atmosphere. This atmosphere is the base of the movie. Polanski is a master of tension and in this case he equalized it throughout the movie. Landscapes and the cities around which the movie takes place are gorgeous: couple ancient castles, empty Spain streets with walls on sides, huge mansion. It all supports the atmosphere. And of course - books, old books with creepy pictures, old libraries... What can possibly be more mystic? The Ninth Gate did not become a masterpiece, two hours are a little bit too much for it, but people who like slow detectives and mystic will still like it. It's fairly hard to discuss Roman Pulaski's art. Never in his whole life did he consider basic models of creating a movie. He proves it with his The Ninth Gate yet again. It's good for starters. There is no one in The Ninth Gate who will guide you during the screenplay and lore, exploring the key moments while delivering the main idea in the end. Forget about it. You'll have to force your brain out to guess or understand what is where, whose and why. At some point Polanski is trying to answer questions known only to him and at some points he's just being silly thus makes the movie incomprehendable. It is like a thick fog above the swamp and everyone sees what he thinks in it. I watched The Ninth Gate over a couple times to remember it. But I didn't rent this movie; I bought a DVD because I have a bad habit of buying good movies for my collection. I remember how I went to premiere with my friends and we couldn't buy tickets that evening. We went to the cinema next morning and the movie theatre was full even then. We were very astonished by The Ninth Gate that we've discussed it for an hour after the movie was over. And we saw this movie very differently. Some of my friends said that there is a question of culture development: God or the Devil. Some said that the main character is Dean and that Devil seduces him with money in order to take his soul. Some said that Polanski is parodying famous movies. They all were correct. Each of person will find something he thinks about in this movie and Polanski made sure that the majority of questions will remain  without answers, most answers are on different questions and most characters would pop up from nowhere and late on vanish again for no apparent reason or cause. Movie ending is a complete prank by Polanski. I personally witnessed few watchers who yelled, ""WTF"" because Polanski stopped the movie in the meanest way (as musicians say - finished with seventh chord without any resolution) which enraged many. While the other half of the watchers quickly explained, it's all right and is according to what it's supposed to be. Mostly left satisfied, although some people didn't like the movie. But what did they expect? Polanski is Polanski, not a dollar that everyone likes.
  The Ninth Gate did not impress me very much but I still enjoyed it. I pictured it as a prank and not an attempt to uncover some secrets. Some of ideas in the movie are great, especially the moment when Boris attempts to summon the Devil (this moment reminded me of the movie Hudson Haw). Yes, there are weak points to the movie, but I only noticed them after reading critics. For example, you can see bad screen work especially when there is a bike ride - the movie wouldn't lose anything without that scene and still you can see that Dean and the Girl are just shaking and not actually driving but my views don't mean that mystic-lovers won't find anything for themselves in The Ninth Gate. As a matter of fact there are some analogies with Angel Heart.
  Should you watch The Ninth Gate? Yeah, why not? It won't leave anyone indifferent and plus, it is better than Oprah at the very least.",1285632000,,12155,4.695448146410136

There are only three copies of this book in existence and Balkan has the third, which he loans to Depp in order to find out if any of the copies are fake.

The movie starts out very promisingly, with a look at how the antique book business works and travel to Europe to look at the other copies and the interesting characters we see along the way. However, several murders happen along the way and I'm still not sure exactly who was supposed to be responsible, or indeed who the female ""protector"" of Depp is. The book started out very well but towards the end through in some gratuitous sex and a last-minute plot twist and just left a bunch of things unsaid.

1093043,5,6305897786,"Movies made for public consumption must be for entertainment, not for analysis for an award.  The Ninth Gate is way more enjoyable than iconic movies like Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby.  There is unjustified over-analysis of this movie, which stifles enjoyment.

The cinematography was excellent, justifying the wide-screen.  The DTS soundtrack was impressive.  Colour saturation was intense, putting the Blu-ray to good effect.  Comments on the Blu-ray version having washed out colours are groundless.  When light streams in behind the actors through library and caf windows, there is going to be less colour in areas lit by shafts of light: photography 101.  There are a lot of scenes taking place in libraries, and there is a lot of backlighting in the movie.  There is no colour washout at all: the skin tones are outstanding, as confirmed by the bare bodies of Lena Olin and Emmanuelle Seigner.

Lack of features?  Roman Polanski's detailed and non-stop commentary was the best I have heard in a very long time - it is virtually an instructional lecture on movie making.  This commentary, pleasantly, is never once self-serving or self-congratulatory.  It incorporates into the narrative all the relevant material normally found in ""Special Features"".  Besides one gets to watch this marvellous movie one more time, the original feature not having boring moments helps making this exhaustive commentary readily consumable.  The drawings in ""Special Features"" have characters bearing an uncanny resemblance to various actors.

Unresolved ending?  Roman Polanski wisely leaves the final encounter between Johnny Depp and the Prince of Darkness to the viewer's imagination.  To be fair, no movie interpretation can possibly come out right, nor can any good come out of it.

This Blu-ray does not work on the old Sony BDP-300, but is playable with models Sony BDP-350 and later 2.0 BDPs.

Many movies give the feeling ""I could have written this script myself"" or ""another variation of a worn theme"".  Not this one.  It is compelling and refreshing drama.  Since this story was put to film in 1999, there has rarely been another quite as original.",1270425600,25,2148,5.198250728862973

The ending was a disgrace to the entire movie and made me hate the whole thing.  Whats the point of a great story line if it doesn't carry you through to the end?  If they had made a sequel that picked up from the end, I may have reconsidered my position on this movie - but since the sequel never came this movie is a disgrace to good movies.

What this movie does have is depth.  Polanski moved it along at a great pace, unfolding the tale bit by bit, but the thing is, there is much more than one story here.  I suspect a lot of people will GET the surface but miss what lies at the depth.

There's a lot of thought in this story, and it draws from a rich occult background.  If you've a background in Crowley, Hermeticism, OTO or such, you will get much more out of this movie than the person that is not familiar with these things.

Well, I'm probably too practical for my own good but I could never accept the maaner in which the book trader handled the rare books he came into contact with (and that was happening throughout the movie).  It was like they were cheap paperback editions of last year's bestsellers.  My first shock was his associate's Rare Book Store that was below street level.  What would happen in case of a lengthy downpore?!!?  No one would place such valued tomes in such fragile confines.  Next I noticed that he didn't use gloves when handling the books or when turning the pages (he didn't even wash his hands).  He carries around one of three existing 18th Century (or was it older) books in a canvas satchel.  I noticed in the pouring rain he still had the satchel nonchalantly swinging by his side.  As the movie contined, he would smoke cigarettes while leafing through the pages and studying the various etchings.  It was too much for me.  ARGGHH!  Oh, by the way, the devil MAY have made him do it but that's still no excuse.

Unfortunately, these editions are far from ordinary, dragging Corso ever deeper into a supernatural conspiracy of satanic eeevil.

So I rented the Blu-ray version of the film to see if it was worth buying.

DEAR. GOD.  This may very well be the worst Blu-ray transfer I have EVER seen thus far.  Even worse that the legendary Digital Noise-riddled ""Terminator 2"" Blu-Ray.  I barely got through my favorite 10 minutes of the film before I shut the whole thing off and took it back.  The transfer is an UGLY washed out, aged-looking, and GRAINY-AS-ALL-GET-OUT P.O.S. and it's the only digital-age disc I've actually felt CHEATED on (even early-era DVDs had sharper advantages over video...plus you knew better re-releases would follow when DVD technology picked up, but at this point in technology this is inexcusable).

I cannot recommend a Blu-ray title LESS than this one.  For me, Blu-ray is about the VIDEO and AUDIO, not about the film itself.  Even if I think a movie sucks, I'll commend it if the Blu-ray transfer is good (I own ""Transformers"" for cryin' out loud), because that's what people want to know.

1093116,4,6305897786,"Unlike the modern film makers that rely on special effects and a surplus of sexual provocation to continue their income status, The Ninth Gate is a throw-back or old school visit back to the times when a film had good acting, a solid/interesting plot, and inventive filming techniques (a quality musical score, as well). Roman Polanski lives up to his reputation with this worthy celluloid adventure.

Johnny Depp, Lena Olin, Frank Langella and several other notable actors do an admirable job in playing out this tale that shares intrigue, subtle comedy, and sarcasm. The theme revolves around a ethically-challenged rare book expert, Johnny Depp, that ekes a living by swindling unsuspecting owners from their valuable collections. Eventually, he is retained by a collector to evaluate and establish that his prize piece, a book co-written by Lucifer, himself, is the one and only and that the other two existing books are fakes/copies. Well, let the intrigue begin there and I won't spoil it by providing details. I will say, however, that plot involves such characters as devil worshippers, eccentric debutantes, dubious and unscrupulous book afficianados; all with one thing in common: their desire to obtain these books and the secrets held within.

So all are aware, this film has a lot of aspects to it and is interesting because of that, but it is not a fast paced, blur through events. Polanski spends ample time developing the plot so the viewer understands the issues being researched (the devil is in the details, you know). You will follow along with Mr. Depp's character as he investigates the authenticity of these ancient works and the subversive attempts to corrupt his intentions. If you are as interested as I and you are analytical of nature, you will pick up on some of the interesting foreshadowing and premise for the story. There are some things left unexplained, (I cannot explain them myself until I read the book for which this is based) but that is what is so appealing of this work - some of the plot is obvious, some revolves around comedic purposes, and some remains opaque. Finally, the film is shot on location in Prague, Paris, Spain and several picturesque places.

In every aspect, this film is a worthy view. You will enjoy the quality of each component of a film with The Ninth Gate. There's much to enjoy, just be an appreciate mood while watching. Quality works don't grow on trees in these days...",1249257600,,2439,4.915048543689321
1093117,5,6305897786,"When this film was released in 1999 it did not get the press it deserved and I never saw it until I it aired on HBO.  After the first viewing, I was hooked on the film.  I have always thought Depp was an excellent actor and he plays an almost likable but undoubtedly dark character than has clearly adopted the ""me above all others"" way of thinking.  He is hired by Frank Langella who plays a very dark, Devil worshiping book collector with a hidden agenda, lyrically named Boris Balkan. Throughout the film, Depp is visited and aided by Emmanuelle Seigner (who to this day I have never seen in anything else in spite of a long European filmography)but one of the mysteries of the film is that you never know who this girl is.  An agent of the Devil, the Devil itself or a dark angel?  As usual, Lena Olin plays a forgettable character and is probably the weakest part of the film.  Even though Langella's portrayal of the evil book collector goes a little over the top toward the end, the film and the interactions between Depp and the other possessors of this rare book are not to be missed.  I am looking forward to the blu-ray release.",1248825600,20,1139,4.395238095238096

Johnny Depp's performance was outstanding as a totally amoral book dealer on a mission to find none other than Lucifer himself.

Many scenes contained fantastic imagry and appear to have been filmed on location. The final scenes were surprising and left me feeling a bit unfinished.  Then again, this ending (as in Rosemarie's Baby) left the viewer very interested in what happens next and several directors believe that a good way to go.

Meet Dean Corso, a short and thin type with greasy hair, goatee, trenchcoat, and a Lucky Strike dangling from his lips. His business is books, antique books, and visits estates to appraise rare volumes... Seems simple enough, his knowledge on the subject is encyclopedic, but in a way that seems to be the extent of it. He comes off as a man who can rattle off the catalogue number, how many copies exist, and of course, their value. But he comes off as the kind of man who probably hasn't actually read anything for quite some time. It's a business, and Corso is a scoundrel, eagerly waiting to rip off anyone who employs him...

Enter Boris Balkan, an aging scholar who has dedicated his life's work to the Devil. Well, Balkan was lucky enough to acquire a very valuable volume just before the previous owner hangs himself. That is the way of things, Balkan has just completed his vast demonic library with the forbidden volume The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows, a book whose author was burned alive for protecting this ancient grimoire. An author who was rumored to collaborate with Lucifer himself, so you can imagine that Balkan is giddy to have such a treasure. But he enlists the aid of Corso to authenticate the book, trsuting a man who can be bought by cold hard cash. Corso is sent to Europe to compare The Nine Gates with the two remaining copies... But not without the previous owner's wife trying to snag the book for herself, and Corso's best friend ends up dead...

Sex and Sects and Satan!

What a wonderful thing, to watch something that combines two of my favorite passions: old books and the cinema. Based on the novel The Club Dumas by Arturo Perez-Reverte, this film weaves a fantastic mystery. The first-person style of the film allows the viewer to only discovers the clues when Corso does, which means we are in the dark as much as he is. The film does not give anything away and remains ambiguous throughout, which is a rare treat because mysteries these days tend to reveal who the killer is in advance, instead this plays like an old nickel and dime trash detective novel or classic noir. In fact, this is the kind of story I could see being told with fedoras and five o' clock shadow, luscious women on the knee while pounding a glass of scotch. Well, scratch the fedoras, everything else is here. This truly is a modern-day film noir, our protagonist is sleazy, he likes money and femme fatales. The entire story revolves around him, there is not a scene he is not involved in. Johnny Depp does a great job in portraying this half-wit bibliophile. Other treats include dark brunettes, mysterious blondes, tales of orgy cults, and the devil!

I've never listened to it, but I don't need an audio commentary to tell you that the color scheme is brilliant. If this movie were filmed in Smell-O-Vision, it would constantly reek of wormy parchment and decaying and musty leather and wood. Everything has an earthy and organic glow to it, lots of burgandy and browns, the atmosphere it creates is almost physically palpable. The music varies from quirky to sinister, playing both with and against the atmosphere. The idea of sinister books played out in a rich milieau of money, women, and murder. This is perhaps one of the most underrated films, especially in Polanski's catalogue.

Those who don't ""get"" Ninth Gate have a problem understanding its understated and elegant arrival because they were looking for some kind of American style Gore-fest or at the very least some kind of Exorcist type film . Ninth Gate is, of course, none of those things - what it is can best be described as European, tastefully accomplished Occult Theatre and an example of true Roman Polanski . Ninth Gate is the perfect Movie for a rainy night next to the fireplace - it is not, however, the perfect movie for anyone with the mindset of a thirteen year old looking for gore and a quick thrill . As anyone who is a fan of this wonderful picture can attest it makes me wonder if there will ever be a sequel and if there is who will direct it ?

1093178,1,6305897786,"Okay - I hardly ever bother with a bad review.  Since I'm an amateur reviewer I'm not required to see every film, read every book and since time is at a premium I try not to see bad films, read bad books, etc.  But I wasted more than two hours on this insultingly bad movie, and I wish I had my time back.

I was watching one of the movie channels.  This film, which I previously knew nothing about, started.  The credits rolled.  Directed by Roman Polanski... good, good - the guy who directed ""Chinatown"".  There's Johnny Depp - great, I like Johnny Depp and all the women at my house aren't going to complain about watching a Johnny Depp movie.  There's Frank Langella - good, I liked him ever since his version of Dracula with Olivier.

The movie started off okay, drawing me in with an intriguing story and these compelling actors.  Depp plays Dean Corso, a rare book dealer.  Langella plays Boris Balkan, a rich book collector who wants Corso to track down a rare satanic book. By thirty minutes into the movie I was hooked.

Thirty minutes later I thought ""well, THIS is sure getting boring.""  Thirty minutes after that I thought ""this is really getting bad and stupid.""  Thirty minutes after THAT I thought ""this ending is really shaping up to be bad, but I've invested over an hour and a half in this movie and it is bad almost in a train-wreck kind of way.

Then it got REALLY bad.  At the end I sat in the room feeling ""I've been HAD!  My time has been STOLEN from me.  I can't believe I sat and watched that.  I can't believe THOSE actors and THAT director could have made something so bad.

I felt so burned I looked up other reviews.  Roger Ebert wrote that it ""opens with a spectacularly good title sequence and goes downhill from there--but slowly, so that all through the first hour there is reason for hope, and only gradually do we realize the movie isn't going to pay off.""  Berardinelli of Reelviews was less kind: ""The Ninth Gate has two modes: tedious and moronic, with the two not being mutually exclusive. Then, one-hundred minutes into this seemingly interminable movie (which clocks in at about 2:10), things take a turn for the worse and The Ninth Gate spirals out of control. A jaw-droppingly bad mixture of film noir and the occult, this picture plods and meanders its way through one uninspired scene after another until it reaches an improbable, laughable climax followed by an equally ridiculous denouement. Only the lobotomized and the brain dead will be able to figure out the logic embraced by The Ninth Gate.""

Consider yourself warned.",1231891200,,2573,4.569868995633188
1093253,5,6305897786,"This film is vintage Polanski:  there is little moral certitude, even if you are dealing with Satan, ruthless and evil acolytes, and a con man, expertly acted by Depp.  Instead, you find a coherent and frightening journey of discovery and ambiguity.  Depp is charged with examining the authenticity of some rare books, which is his profession, though he is also an unscrupulous and sleazy near-thief.  As with all great actors, his every gesture exudes his personal confusion, ambition, and cynical humor - a complete personality and even an entire environment.

After witnessing a number of alarming crimes, he single-mindedly pursues his task (for which he is handsomely paid) and blithely ignores the destruction and murderous detritus as if walking though an obstacle course.  Along the way, he keeps running into a mysterious and very beautiful woman, who seems to be protecting him, yet also playfully mocking him before disappearing only to reappear in dangerous moments.  Looking not quite human yet vulnerable to injury, she seems to enjoy the evolution of Depp's character in a violent, unpredictable direction.  There is a frightening scene where she annoints him with her blood.  And the book:  the more he discovers, the deeper he gets in becoming almost a direct participant in the antique illustrations in the book, which he scrutinizes as more manuscripts come to light.  Depp's character emerges as something more than he appeared to be, though entirely lacking in simple definition.  It is truly masterful.

The most beautiful aspect of the film is the sense - the feeling - of ominous mystery that pervades it.  In other words, there are many clues that must be interpreted, and the viewer never reaches the point of saying, ""oh, I get it"", which in lesser films is followed by ""that's it?""  I found this delightfully fascinating and evocative, particularly as much of it takes place in a region similar to the one I currently live in in France.  Typical of Polanski, this elevates the film to a higher art than other occult films, much as Rosemary's Baby did.  The mood of the film is completely consistent and demands (and deserves) the viewer's full attention.

Warmly recommended.  It is one of the best films I have seen in some time.",1225238400,5,2258,4.989304812834225
1093254,5,6305897786,"[This is the last review in my 31 Days of Halloween 2008 series. It's been fun going down Tombstone Lane & I want to thank you for taking the time to read these humble & horrific offerings. I hope you've had some fun too. I'm already looking forward to next year. More tales of terror & darkness to explore!]

Jumpin' J Lucifer, it looks like every Magus & Magatrix on the planet have reveiwed THE NINTH GATE--and some of the naughty kids actually gave the whole plot away.

I'll try to be both brief & discreet.

The teaming up of Roman Polanski & Johnny Depp was surely a pact made in hell--and I mean that in a GOOD way. Polanski's near obsession with the Diobolical Side often translate into memorable images on film. There are some obvious Satanic images in THE NINTH GATE, and others not so obvious.

Johnny Depp deftly plays the role of rare book investigator. It's nice to watch him play a more or less normal human being for a change. There's a very short sequence in the film I really enjoyed: Johnny Depp is waiting in a line (for something, I forgot what--short term memory loss, please bear with me.) Anyway, a little girl is standing next to him, giving him the evil eye. Depp looks down at her and does a very funny Johny Depp sort of double take. It was really cute--and I mean that in a nice way too.

Other cast members were excellent as well.

On one level the theme of the film is how to conjure up The Living Devil a la ROSEMARY'S BABY. There is another, perhaps more subtle interpretation, i.e. performance of The Great Work. The Great Work is alchemical rather than Satanic. The Great Work is based on positive spiritual concepts like the Gnostic sacrament of The Sacred Marriage; the Hindu Kundalini Yoga, Bhakti Yoga--and, in particular, Tantra Yoga, the Union of Shiva & Shakti.

And that's all of the plot I'm going to reveal.

The wonderful woodcut images on the pages of the much coveted book in the film are great. I like the way they look & play into the action.

[See MERCURIUS The Marriage of Heaven & Earth in the links list below.]

Another thing I liked about the movie is how Polanski makes fun of the wealthy Satanists' ridiculous pretentions. To miss that point is to miss the whole thing--and yet the viewer is still left (as in Left-Hand Path) with a reaffirmation that the Key to this Theory of Everything is Lucifer. To many people (who aren't necessarily Satanists), Lucifer represents, the Bringer of Light, a Promethian figure who is actually on the side of humanity in the Struggle for Existence. I  can rate with the mythology of being kicked on the butt out of Heaven.

I'll end here with a warning: Watch out for any edited versions of the film. I've seen one on the tube that not only cut out the cute sequence with the little girl, but butchered the sexual images at the conclusion--a desecration that completely demolished the whole point of the movie's theme.

Well, that's it.

HAVE A HAPPY & HORROR-FILLED HALLOWEEN!

The screenplay written by Enrique Urbizu, Roman Polanski, and John Brownjohn, greatly simplifies the novel, which was deemed too complex and plot heavy to film in its entirety. However, in spite of this harsh adaptive process the film is quite impressive, though it may be a disappointment for fans of the novel.

Dean Corso is an unscrupulous bibliophile and book appraiser, who specializes in rare and highly valuable books. When he is contacted by billionaire Boris Balkan to verify the authenticity of the satanic volume, The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows, by seeking out the only other two existing copies. Balkan claims that he purchased his copy from a man named Telfer who committed suicide the day after he sold the book.
Corso goes on a mercenary quest that takes him through Europe and he crosses paths with some very strange and unsavory characters. He has a shallow sexual encounter with Telfer's wife, Liana, who desperately wants the book back. Corso also has repeat encounters with an enigmatic and beautiful stranger, who seems to show up whenever he needs help of some sort. Corso soon learns that she is not what she seems.
It becomes apparent that Corso is being closely monitored by Boris Balkan, who calls him repeatedly to demand updates on his success, and it's also apparent that Liana Telfer has sent her lethal bodyguard after Corso and the book.
While examining and comparing the different copies of the book, Corso stumbles onto a secret. There are subtle differences in the book's illustrations, which serve as symbols or keys to conjuring the Devil, and Corso realizes that all three copies are legitimate but only with all of the illustrations can one understand their true meaning.
As people around him start dying, Corso finds himself caught in the middle of a deadly diabolical conspiracy. He soon learns that some books are dangerous, that some mysteries should never be solved, and that some doors are better left unopened.

Stylistically, The Ninth Gate has much in common with 1940s film noir, as well as the more sophisticated horror films of the `60s and `70s. The film is very reminiscent of Roman Polanski's other films and yet it never feels redundant or predictable, which in itself is unusual when you consider the genre that he's working within. The film is boosted by a terrific score by Wojciech Kilar, and the combined efforts of the production designer, the costume designer, and the cinematographer. But the film's greatest asset is Polanski's uncanny ability to tell a sensational story while allowing the audience to suspend disbelief.
The Ninth Gate features a superb cast, which includes Johnny Depp as Dean Corso, Frank Langella as Boris Balkan, Lena Olin as Liana Telfer, And Emmanuelle Seigner as The Girl.

The DVD includes an audio commentary by Roman Polanski, an isolated music score, a featurette, a gallery of satanic drawings, storyboard selections, production notes, cast & crew bios, theatrical trailers and TV spots.

1093256,3,6305897786,"So the Devil, having eternity to pass the time and no XBOX 360, got bored one night in 1666, thought it was fun to play a game by conjuring up a puzzle. Whoever solves this puzzle is granted the powers of a god.  You know, immortality, invincibility, ability to fly, walk on water, all that god stuff.  The keys to this puzzle are hidden in 3 books, in the form of 9 illustrated pages signed with Lucifer's initials, that when properly deciphered, unlocks the ""ninth gate"" to the ultimate ""power-up"".

Nobody is able to solve the puzzle until now, when book dealer/detective Johnny Depp is hired by a wealthy collector, who owns 1 of the 3 books, to compare his copy with the other 2 that belong to separate owners, located in Portugal and France.

Okay, nice concept. I was hooked. I was entertained. I was liking almost everything in this movie; the visuals, the creepy sometimes circusy soundtrack, the mystery woman, the performances by Depp & Langella. Everything except when I got to the ending, which left me going ""Huh? What the hell? That's it? That's the end?"". It feels incomplete, unsatisfying, anti-climactic.

And here's why. Here comes the spoiler.
For the main character he gets his reward -- he gets laid with a hot chick and this she-devil grants him the final key to ultimate power.  For the viewer, all the reward you get is to see Johnny Depp's back as he walks to the entrance of an old castle, gets engulfed by light and fades out. Man, that is SO LAME!  I expected something more dramatic than that. Remember that scene in the coolest movie of all time, Matrix Reloaded, when Neo finally reaches the doorway to the Source and engulfed by light? Imagine that the movie ended right there, without proceeding to the Architect scene & the saving of Trinity. That's how it feels. Well, okay the Architect scene was pretentious B.S. anyway, but that's another story.  The point is, it leaves you feeling hanging, feeling that there's something missing.

Hell, I'd even settle for a Michael Jackson Thriller type of ending with a shot of Johnny Depp grinning, demonic eyes glowing, with or without the maniacal Vincent Price laughing in the background. Just give me a more tangible, tactile way to express that he acquired some of the Devil's powers and I'm happy.

Johnny Depp, as always, turns in a superb performance.  The supporting actors and actresses were also excellent.

I had never heard of the movie and the premise was wonderfully intriguing and full of potential. Unfortunately the movie did not fully take advantage of this potential. I actually enjoyed the first 70% of the movie. The mystery alone had me glued me to the screen. In the last half our or so, however, all of the movie's worth was nullified. I enjoy a movie that leaves questions unanswered, but this movie left the WRONG questions. Because of this blunder, the story didn't matter to me and, in the end, it seemed that the entire point of the movie was to facilitate two nude scenes.

If you're into movies that are just for nudity, I'm sure there are better ones out there. If you're looking for a wonderfully compelling and thought provoking story, I suggest you look elsewhere. I, for one, want my $5 back...

1093262,4,6305897786,"There's something so cruel about Roman Polanski's ""Ninth Gate"", something so mean underneath the surface, that though it isn't always a frightening film, it certainly ranks up there with some of the more campy and direct movies about Old Scratch.

Unlike ""The Pianist"" or some of Polanski's more recent mainstream films, this makes no direct attempt to spoonfeed the viewer the meaning or message of the film.  For all the eccentricity, though--and there's plenty of it--this actually isn't too tough to figure out.

Johnny Depp plays Dean Corso, a lowlife rare book collector who, like everyone else in the film, wants what he wants when he wants it.  He is a dry, ironic, cynical intellectual whose dominant personality trait is his ego and desire for money.  Depp's performance is amazing despite how little he is given to work with; the laughs never stop as his curt, smartass responses to every question asked flow like a bilious current.
Contracted by a power hungry devotee of the Black Arts (Frank Langella in one of his ugliest and most frightening roles) Boris Balkan, his mission is to find an authentic copy of a book called ""The Ninth Gate"", a text  which supposedly leads directly to the presence and power of Satan himself.

Here the mad surreality and black humor begin.  It resembles very closely Roman Polanski's 1976 film ""The Tenant"", except this film has an almost complete absence of protagonists or decent characters at all.  Everyone is more less a degenerate. During Corso's ominous escapades and his encounters with thoroughly sinister and foul people (all of whom die when Balkan discovers that they are not cooperating with Corso's search, leading one to believe he is indeed the Devil), a young woman who looks like a raggedy college student follows him constantly.  At first she appears merely scary and irritating, like everyone else in this doomed, musty landscape: when Corso is physically attacked, however, we realize she is not an agent of Balkan's or a college student.  She displays supernatural powers and yet she reacts to the constant deaths that occur with a kind of attentiveness towards Corso's reactions, looking for guilt or disgust and finding none--and she seems pleased.

The ending of the movie is so funny and so filthy at the same time that we know Polanski is refusing to compromise one little bit.  Corso, at first a neutral amoral character, becomes obsessed with his quest for the book and gets in Balkan's way--his ending is particularly hilarious.  Polanski also takes a shot at Satanists, as Balkan exclaims to a crowd of them, dressed in pentagrams and black robes: ""Do you really think the Prince of Darkness would manifest himself in the midst of this nonsense?""

A good look at Corso's ""Guardian Angel"" at the end reveals just who she is and what her true intentions were the whole time.  I'm not going to reveal what happens, but I am surprised so many viewers were ""dumbfounded"" by this movie.  A great exercise in Polanskian madness!",1213574400,9,2999,4.930417495029821

In fact, Chinatown continues to be one of my favorite newer film noirs, and Rosemary's Baby is the ultimate example of how to combine horror and humor in what is ultimately a scary movie.

But sometimes Polanski's films are just okay, as in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frantic/dp/6305133476/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frantic</a>&nbsp;(1988) and downright bad, as in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pirates-Import/dp/B000AAIC64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pirates [Import</a>] (1986). The Ninth Gate (1999) is one of those okay movies.

It's based on the book by Arturo Perez-Reverte called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Club-Dumas/dp/015603283X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Club Dumas</a>, which was recommended to me by my friend J. Mark Bertrand. I loved it. The book was about a conniving book dealer who is researching two books at once--a lost version of a chapter by Dumas and another book called The Ninth Gate. What made Perez-Reverte's version great is the way that the main character, Corso, gets mixed up in both of them. By the end, it's almost as if he can't distinguish fantasy and reality, and so he ends up falling into several strange situations dealing with satanism and Dumas lovers. And they look a lot alike, too.

But Polanski removes all of the Dumas stuff and makes the movie solely about Corso and The Ninth Gate, a book supposedly ghostwritten by Lucifer. What he creates here is a creepy movie with a great character. Johnny Depp plays Corso as laid-back yet unscrupulous, and his acting fits the character superbly. For the first hour, the tension is taut and building. And then you learn what is actually happening, or at least what may be happening. And it goes downhill from there.

Sure the ending is left open, but it's not necessarily a good thing. Sure there is psychological drama. But by the end, I don't care anymore. The plot has become so ridiculous that I don't care about the characters or whether they manage to actually conjure the devil. And the movie incidentally features one of the stupidest sex scenes on film.

So all in all, it's an okay movie.",1205193600,4,3245,7.267857142857143

First of all, we're talking about a basic premise in which we, the audience, are asked to beleive that the devil himself signed drawings in a series of ""ancient manuscripts"".  And that these 400 year-old manuscripts are in pristine condition, looking like they've never even been opened (or photocopied or had cigarette ash dropped on them by former owners, etc).  A suspension of disbelief is absolutely necessary!

There's the 'guardian angel' or 'guardian devil' should we say, in the mysterious 'woman' who keeps appearing to help him out of various difficulties and who finally leads him to reach 'the ninth gate'.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  The pacing was steady and suspenseful.  The filming was obviously the work of a master.  I loved that we got to 'go to Europe' for the second half of the movie.  The ending was the only problem for me.  I hear people debating both ways - cop-out or stroke of genius?  I'm bound to think the former is more accurate.  However, if we are to beleive that the sudden fade to white is a sudden bringing of the audience into the consciousness of Johny Depp as he enters the ninth gate... well..  It still seems to me like he just couldn't think of any better way to end it.  After all, the movie's been promising to 'raise the devil' for almost two hours and finally we are left with this?  I was a bit let down, whether I should or shouldn't have been.  Still, maybe that was the best way to end it.

Anyhow, there are many examples too numerous for practical purposes of documenting.  To focus on just one good example would be THE NINTH GATE.

If in fact you are expecting a terrifying episode of demonic encounters replete with gore and sensationalism, then you might not like this film, which has a more stately pacing and emphasizes ambiance and atmosphere over glitzy special effects.  Others were disappointed because the film only partially reflects the book it was based on (""Club Dumas"", which I actually also read - pretty impressive, huh?), although to be fair, the book's structure would not have really been ideal for close adaptation.

I admit that I was really intrigued by the premise, especially when the element of interaction by Lucifer was suggested, because done well it can be fascinating, although it is also runs the big risk of embarrassing failure, given the heightened expectations.  The trailers were effective enough, and Johnny Depp picks good movies more often than not, so I thought it was worth a look.  The movie was not quite what I expected, but still kept my interest, in spite of the aforementioned moderate pacing and a subject matter (rare book appraisals) which I would not have ordinarily found especially fascinating.  It was an intellectual rather than visceral effort, and the acting was actually somewhat effective as it turns out.  Though some have incorrectly characterized the acting as being lackadaisical and/or stilted or uninspiring (among the many adjectives used), the director and actors wisely chose a more understated approach, which is more realistic and less (melo)dramatic.  As a result, Depp was convincing in his role as a mercenary book appraiser not always above unscrupulous methods, and Frank Langella was quite effective in his role as an accomplished but ruthless publisher and collector, whose sophistication almost masks his sinister agenda.  Their nuanced performances were far more appropriate and believable, rather than over-the-top affectations which would have just come off as campy and out of place (Sean Penn and Al Pacino and Tom Cruise need not have auditioned).

The story centers on a book titled ""The Ninth Gate of the Kingdom of Shadows"", an obscure but legendary tome rumored to have Lucifer as a contributor.  Depp's character is Dean Corso, a highly sought though morally relaxed appraiser.  He is hired by Boris Balkan (Langella) to find other remaining copies - if they still exist - to determine the book's authenticity.  What seemed initially like a thorough and arduous investigation came to include hazardous intrigue, the interventions of mysterious strangers, untimely deaths, and more danger than Corso was prepared for.  Along the way, the financial appeal of the lucrative assignment gives way to the need for answers to the danger and intrigue, which in turn gives way to a pursuit of something possibly unworldly and beyond belief.  Though some will stubbornly disagree, I think what helps make this film work is the element of ambiguity regarding the book's authenticity and nature, as well as those of at least one other character in the film, and the film's ending itself.

As I am not an easy laugh, I tend to be a challenging audience for comedies.  Similarly, I am not an easy scare and do not impress easily when it comes to horror films.  Though I am not sure that this would be accurately categorized as a horror film (it could be more accurately described as a supernatural thriller), I will risk the razzing and aspersions and insults to say that one of the more scary/frightening/evocative (as measured by the goosebump meter) sequences I have ever come across in movies is in this film.  Polanski is regarded by some as a genius, though not all his films are well received.  If you can dispense with any preconceived expectations and approach this with an open mind, there is a decent chance you might find this film's merits as both a creative project and a skillfully crafted effort.",1183075200,5,4823,4.992509363295881
1093382,4,6305897786,"this is a great movie if you are into dective/thriller type movies. it does move a bit slow in parts. the movie is about a ""book detective"" so to speak. he is hired to track down a book that was supposdly written by the devil himself.",1182902400,,234,4.108695652173913
1093429,5,6305897786,"Loved the movie for its atmosphere.  I read one review in a literary magazine that explained the mysteries to my satisfaction.  The main character's name is ""Corso"" - sounds similar to ""cursed one"" even though in the movie, he said that it means ""one who travels"".  Johnny Depp looks like the quintessential devil with his goatee and dark hair with gray around the side.  The review I read said that the devil had lost his way on earth and needed to get ""home"".  The ""guardian angel"" provided clues to him and safeguarded him.  Remember how surprised she looked when he accidentally bumped into her, causing her nose to bleed.  Like she was not used to having any ""mortals"" injure her like that.  Also, he always played up vices, like constantly smoking, drinking, cheating people.  One of the drawings showed the ""guardian angel"" riding the three headed beast (literally - and this is a biblical symbol for the devil)and pointing back to the castle or the ninth gate.  When Boris Balkan wanted to meet the devil so badly, he never realized that he really had.  An interesting thought, anyway.",1182816000,2,1093,4.76063829787234
1093430,3,6305897786,"I liked ""The Ninth Gate"" for its incredibly long credit sequence at the beginning of the film.  The music is dramatic as it sweeps through door after door after door, all of which look exactly the same.  After about the fourth door, it becomes silly and laughter sets in.  It's like listening to an old vinyl record that is skipping, but not getting up to move the needle.

After this, the movie goes downhill a bit, but Roman Polanski puts on a good show.  Particularly interesting is the consummation sequence in which his real-life wife Emmanuelle Seigner plays the green-eyed girl & does the deed with Depp to a background of flames.  It's not many men who would want their wives to do that, but Polanski's viewpoint has always been unique.  He is a great filmmaker.  His Best Director Oscar for ""The Pianist,"" nominations for ""Chinatown"" & ""Tess"" plus his screenplay nomination for the legendary ""Rosemary's Baby"" prove the point.  Even if 9th Gate begins to get a bit muddled, he has more than fulfilled his promise since his first film ""Knife in Water"" got a Best Foreign Language Film nomination back in 1963.

Johnny Depp is also usually very interesting to watch.  He scored a couple Best Actor nominations for very different roles from ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" in 2003 to ""Finding Neverland"" in 2004.  As book dealer Dean Corso, I found the character's moral ambiguity to make him unattractive.  You couldn't really cheer for him; but he was interesting as he worked his way through the maze of facts in this old book mystery.

Frank Langella has had a long career from ""Diary of a Mad Housewife"" back in 1970 to ""Good Night & Good Luck"" in 2005.  As the rich book collector Boris Balkan, he was very cerebral, but lacked a certain evil pizzazz to really make you cheer as he bursts into flames.  It felt more like he was pathetically weird.  Maybe that was what Polanski wanted.

Lena Olin is such an interesting actress to watch.  She makes you feel like at any moment she could do almost anything.  She would work again with Depp in ""Chocolat"" and had a sole Oscar nomination in the supporting category in 1989 for ""Enemies: A Love Story.""  The role of Liana Telfer maximizes her strengths.  She goes from making love to Depp to trying to kill him with a hair-trigger temper.  Tony Amoni as her bodyguard with the cropped blond hair makes a visual impression.

British stage actress Barbara Jeffords who appeared in films sporadically from ""Hamlet"" in 1959 to ""Madame Bovary"" in 2000, makes a memorable appearance as Baroness Kessler, another book collector.  The last sequence with her wheelchair banging repetitively into the wall as Corso awakes to find the flat aflame is visually brilliant.  James Russo who played Sheriff Poole in one of my favorite films, ""Open Range,"" puts in a good appearance as Bernie the bookseller who doesn't last too long holding onto Corso's rare tome.

""The Ninth Gate"" isn't the most dreadful film ever.  Polanski is far too good a director for that to occur.  But it bogs down in plot details that never really seem to fit together.  For instance, how did all the pictures in the books once the three editions came together actually enable Boris Balkan?  Or they didn't, which is why he burned up -- and if that's the case, then was the film really all about something that didn't exist?  Yet, we see the Green Eyed girl flitting about; so we must conclude that something was going on, but what?  Did Depp's Corso become like Mia Farrow in ""Rosemary's Baby""?  Who knows?  After a movie as long as this, it should have been clear.  Perhaps we should just go to ""Pirates 3"" and not worry about it.  Next!",1179446400,,3684,4.6645962732919255

1093432,4,6305897786,"Even though this movie has received its fair share of scathing reviews, I must say I enjoyed it. I read the book too, and yes, the movie does not do justice to the book, nevertheless I found the movie to be entertaining. Johnny Depp is famous for playing understated roles, and here he plays the ruthless book dealer Corso with a measure of indifference, and yet, his character sucks you into the plot as he ventures deeper into a web of deceit & evil. Frank Langella's Boris Balkan is intellectual and possessed of a greed for forbidden things. Lena Olin as the 'grieving widow' with devilish designs is sexy as always, but nothing more. I found the character of the 'guardian angel' who is always getting Depp out of trouble [played by Polanski's wife Emmanuelle Seigner] to be the most intriguing...her glances and looks [esp those eyes] hint at something more sinister underlying the surface.

The score is haunting...one gets the feeling there are malevolent forces at work, and permeable evil throughout the movie. Although some reviews found the movie to be plodding, I didn't...if you are a serious book collector as I am, then you will be able to understand the thrill of the hunt, oftentimes very ardous and slow as you search for that one elusive title...so here Corso's quest in tracking down the other two copies of the Nine Kingdoms & unearthing their secrets...only his quest takes him into a dark, forbidding world filled with devil worshippers, and a stranger who holds the real key to all his questions.",1175990400,10,1521,4.805343511450381

I just find the movie interesting. I find Corso likeable. I like most of Depp's acting, he's usually understated and underrated. His deliveries are always more on the subtle side, a method I highly prefer.  And the movie is subtle and low keyed as well. And what a lovely devil. Seems that the devil is not what it's cracked up to be.  Of course, in reality, neither is the real devil--namely, there is no devil. This truth, if it were really believed, would come as a complete shock to the majority.  How much they would miss him, as he's a part of all of us, just as is the god.",1175212800,7,822,4.381578947368421
1093434,2,6305897786,"If you believe in the Devil, and I mean *really* believe in the devil, I can't think of one good reason why you'd want to summon the Devil into this world. At worst, he's purported to be the father of lies, and one of the fallen angels. This means that anything he tells you is suspect, anything he gives you is suspect, and he probably has the power to make you believe in him. Yikes. Not a safe trip. Not a terribly sane trip, for that matter.

Yet that is precisely what Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) desired. He had one copy of ""The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadow"", and there were three extant. One or all of these books is a forgery, and one or all holds the secret to summoning Satan. He hires Corso (played a bit too understated by Johnny Depp) to research the other texts.

The movie is based on the novel ""The Club Dumas"" by Arturo Perez Reverte, which I favorably reviewed.

I can't give a similar review to The Ninth Gate for a number of reasons. First, Depp's portrayal of Corso was one dimensional, and Corso was a multi-dimensional character. Whether that's the filmmaker's fault or Depp's I don't know, but Depp's Corso was a dreadful bore.

A mysterious girl appeared and became an ally of his, demonstrating supernatural abilities. We are never given ample evidence as to why she might have had an interest in helping Corso, or in what her abilities might have been (never mind her identity). Yet since this is a character from the book, I know why she was there, I have a pretty good idea who she was (and good job to the author on how he handled that!) and her character's interests and abilities could have been better communicated, with very little difficulty.

Also, in a rather silly departure from the book (departures are fine...I'm not being a book snob), they substitute an average sized platinum-blonde haired black male for a character in the book who was tall, white, and physically imposing. There's nothing that irritates me more than a ""quota substitute"". I don't think this particular sub had any speaking lines, which makes it that much more of an insult.

I love intelligent thrillers. (I didn't care for The Da Vinci Code.) This was a thriller that spent time in libraries, that examined woodcuttings drawn, perhaps, by Lucifer himself - yet I wasn't engaged.

In 1999, when the film was released, I couldn't sit through it. After reading The Club Dumas and then discovering that there was a connection between the two, I approached the film again, hoping that understanding where the book was coming from would help. It did not. In fact, it raised more questions.

I would give this movie 2.5 stars and round it up to 3; however, I'm reviewing the DVD and the DVD gets a big spanking for not having subtitles. There's no excuse, in this day and age, for a mainstream DVD not to offer subtitles.",1173312000,17,2837,4.581854043392505

The road trip scenery throughout Europa was especially welcome and set the tone so marvellously. Some of the editing seemed rather abrupt although. In certain scenes where the veil was puilling back ever so slightly - bam - scene changed. My other issue was certain parts of the soundtrack seemed out of place. While the mood was dark and slow throughout, as was the music, abruptly at times (the chase along the Seine) segued into action film stereotypical.

I'm afraid I still have questions about the female lead's identity, but the film works nicely both ways. The ending thus is totally up to the interpretation of the viewer. Don't expect special effects and demons, do expect a wonderfully engrossing film based on the performances and pacing of the film. The juxtapositions presented to the viewer are mind candy.

1093535,3,6305897786,"I saw Roman Polanski's ""The Ninth Gate"" -- a horror film often poorly compared to his earlier ""Rosemary's Baby"" -- on a Saturday night when it began at 10 p.m. It is a good flick for late night on a Saturday -- it's about an unscrupulous rare book dealer (Johnny Depp in an effective role) that makes a deal with a similarly unscrupulous collector (Mr. Overactor Frank Langella) to visit Europe and determine if Langella's first edition book is authentic.

Only catch is it's a first edition of a book written in the 1500s that portends a visit by the devil from those who read it. Depp takes the case (and a big check with a promise of more to come) and goes on a European travelall to check out the other two books in existence.

Strange things begin to happen, weird people start showing up (including a protective angel) and mayhem begins to break out. Depp's investigation leads to death, fire and some interesting discoveries about the books. Langella shows up for a final scene of devil worship where his overacting takes on a new dimension.

This is an interesting and fun movie, for the most part. The mystery story is very involving and the European travelogue, through Spain and France, is very interesting. The film has many suspenseful moments and Depp is unusually good in his role.

This is a poor man's ""Rosemary's Baby"", however, and it lacks both the fit and finish of Polanski's other venture into devil worship. Still, it is a pretty good late night horror effort, one you can return to a few times to figure out whether that protective angel is actually a member of the devil's brigade or not.",1160265600,35,1614,4.613240418118467
1093536,3,6305897786,"- CAUTION: SPOILERS BELOW -

I first saw Ninth Gate at the theater in 1999 or 2000 and I'm convinced that that is the best way to see this movie. Lights low, huge picture in front of you, rich, booming sound. The opening credits are great; Polish musician Wojciech Kilar's opening theme is excellent and sets an appropriate tone of weariness and dread. Some of the pluckier parts of the soundtrack don't seem to mesh too well, or seem dated -- but the opening theme is masterfully done.

The movie concerns a book dealer's attempts to piece together the three known copies of a medieval tome that was supposedly co-written by Lucifer in 1666. Yes, co-authored by Lucifer himself. Apparently Lucifer likes to sign his name ""LCF,"" the movie shows, and he does engravings, too. Piecing together all Lucifer's drawings in the 3 extant copies of the 'The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows,' a book that reminds of the Necronomicon, enables one to summon the dark lord. Or so the theory goes.

Depp does an adequate, low-key job as the unscrupulous book collector in search of the volumes on behalf of a wealthy New York client (Frank Langella). As others have mentioned, you do get the feeling that some sort of unspeakable evil is always JUST around the corner. But after awhile it begins to feel like a big put-on. Is anything going to ever happen or not? The pacing of the plot is deliberate, even langorous, and there is a good amount of suspense and unease, ladled on thick and grey in various European settings. The characters are interesting and even eerie (the two book makers in Portugal, for example).

There are some moments, however, where the film seems to devolve into self-parody. For example, when you think of it, Satan himself, sitting around, doing drawings, and planting them in 3 different books -- well, that's kind of absurd, no? Nonetheless, if you don't think about such minutaie too much, you can enjoy the atmosphere and moodiness the movie conjures. One failing of the movie was when Depp's character, Corso, encounters the pack of Satanists at a secluded European mansion. This scene, which should have been climactic, seems to want to play like EYES WIDE SHUT, and it does sort of play that way -- but it's EYES WIDE SHUT as directed for the old 80s TV show Amazing Stories. Kind of hokey. In fact, some moments of this scene are laughably bad: One of the female Satanists, for some reason, hastily strips off her black silk robe and scuttles away naked, as if she'd just seen Godzilla approaching Mt. Fuji. Granted, fleeing is one thing -- but stripping off your clothes as you do so? Why was this put here? What the heck, Roman Polanski? Another Satanist looks like a Renassance Fair enthusiast, in long hair and a pony tail. And when Frank Langella strides into the scene, dressed like lawyer Melvin Belli in the Rolling Stones' GIMME SHELTER, proclaiming, ""Mumbo jumbo! Mumbo jumbo! Mumbo jumbo!"" it's hard not to laugh.

The ending also felt antclimactic. I remember in the theater that folks sat in hushed silence as the credits came up, and there was a feeling of disbelief that that confused, ambiguous little bit at the end really was the ending. (You'll know what I mean when you see it.)

If someone else other than Roman Polanski had made this movie -- a new director, perhaps -- you'd think, ""Hmm, this was uneven but it had its moments. I can't wait to see what this director does in the next few years."" But since it *is* Polanski and you expect a degree of excellence from him, it's a let down -- of sorts. ROSEMARY'S BABY and REPULSION are far superior to this. But if you have seen THE TENANT, Polanski's last of his unofficial trilogy of which REPULSION & ROSEMARY'S were the first two parts, well, it's about on level with that. THE TENANT was also a good, suspenseful, disturbing movie that nonetheless delivered a confusing, unsatisfying ending and had uneven, silly moments.

I'm torn between recommending this or not. I give it 3 stars. I wish I could say 3 and a half. It's not bad. But it just isn't as great as we know Polanski is capable of. Go into it with low expectations and you may be surprised.",1159660800,16,4156,4.638586956521739

Film opens well, with a suicide and Depp's opportunistic character who seems to straddle the moral fence, but it never creates the proper mood or atmosphere.  Exorcist 3, which I was equally disappointed in, at least was more satanic.  I won't spoil anything for those who do want to see it, but the showdown scene between Depp and those he is purusing is awkward and poorly directed.  Emmanuelle Seigner comes across more like a hippy chick than a Demona. And the 'showdown with the devil' is a letdown to say the least.

Misleadingly hyped as the type of action/horror hybrid we are all too familiar with, ""Ninth Gate"" actually revisits the Noir trappings Polanski played with in ""Chinatown,"" and combines it with the tongue-in-cheek Gothic overtones of ""Rosemary's Baby.""

Johnny Depp plays Dean Corso, a used book dealer who is pressed into service as an amateur P.I. by multimillionare Balkan (Frank Langella), who hires him to track down and examine alternate versions of a rare Satanic text. What appears to be simple turns out to be a convoluted web of intrigue and dark secrets in best noir fashion. Depp's Corso encounters femme fatales, eccentric cloistered old money and - most charmingly - a series of rather bookish Old World types. While never devolving into slapstick, Depp keeps tongue planted firmly in cheek, adding a much-needed light touch to the proceedings.

In sum, I enjoyed this film a lot, and believe it holds up to multiple viewings.

The Artisan single disc version of the film contains very few extras. There's a very brief featurette, as well as the ridiculous trailers which explain why ""Ninth Gate"" failed at the box office. More thoughtfully, Artisan included two bonus audio tracks. The first is a director's commentary, the second is a music-only version. There's also a nice gallery containing the Tarot card-like illustrations that figure so heavily in the film. Unfortunately, there are no subtitles nor are there any foreign language subtitles or language tracks.

I myself am neither. I am a Polanski fan but felt 'Ninth Gate' is a somewhat failed attempt at the psychological horror Polanski is capable of. Many works of Polanski, both new and old, excell head and shoulders above this film. Don't misunderstand me. There are nice moments in this film. Some people may fall in love so much with these moments they tend to look over the idiotic moments that can be found here.

For those of you wandering how good the film is - please rent first and make up your own mind before buying. There are moments in the film that succumb to Hollywood popish cinema - such as two ridiculous scenes involving a woman floating on air (subtlety be gone) and the horrid burning scene near the finale (way over the top).

I really tried to keep this film in my collection of Polanski. But next to films such as 'Repulsion', 'Knife In The Water', 'The Pianist' and others, it seems to fall short. You can see the Polanski touch around the corners here but it seems as if this were more an attempt to cash in on the glory days of his early horror works but reformed for a modern audience - it fits well in with today's hollywood horror, with or without the action.

Gladly Polanski reveals, through 'The Pianist', that he can still grab an audience and do so in a realistic gripping manner - a true life horror of sorts - no goofy moments here. For those who are better chilled by a sense of realism, whether in fiction, non-fiction, fantasy context or otherwise, may want to look elsewhere in the Polanski library.

The acting is on par with a movie such as this.  It's hard to define this as a ""new"" classic or something TCM is going to be airing alongside ""Rosemary's Baby"" as a Thriller Mini-Thon.  However, from the opening sequence to the subject matter, it does a relatively good job at addressing a book in which ""Satan himself"" authored.

Frank Langella had a ton of acting chops back in the late 70s, but with this being the only possible exception, he seems to rather be stuck in typecast roles.  Another good actor that apparently prefers this is the underrated, and highly underused Hector Elizondo.  Frank plays Depp's ""employer"" only in the financial sense.  He gets Depp to check on the validity of two other copies of the same book in the hopes he (Langella) has the authentic version.

Extensive knowledge of the occult, the devil, or the actual meanings of Lucifer is not needed to have a good time with this movie.  Considering most movies that are made from novels don't necessarily market themselves to the literary students and historians around the world, it's hard to imagine needing to bone up on the topic before viewing.  Suspension of disbelief is something every movie needs viewers to do...otherwise, wouldn't ""A Christmas Carol"" or even ""It's a Wonderful Life"" be considered drivel?

I really enjoyed this movie with a bag or two of popcorn and some sodas during a recent Saturday night.  It's a gripping tale of the lengths people go to obtain certain artifacts.  And isn't the thought of evil watching you something that people typically enjoy?",1144800000,5,1896,4.766871165644171
1093663,3,6305897786,"First off, you don't have to be a fan of Johnny Depp to like this film. However, you should be at least interested in historical mysteries, modern religious explorations or the occult. It will make the movie much more entertaining for you if you like those types of films. That may sound off-putting, but keep in mind that such films as the Indiana Jones series, The Da Vinci Code (best selling novel, movie isn't out yet) and National Treasure all fall into these categories.

Having said that, wow, what a great attempt this movie was. I'll explain why I say attempt in a moment. The acting is very good; the story is engaging and entertaining. I looked around the room while watching this movie with some friends and everyone was literally on the edge of their seats even though this really isn't an action film. Through mystery, suspense and intrigue the director is able to draw audiences into the world he has woven. Some of the clues followed and locations visited by the main character (Depp) are real and so for armchair historians there is an added feel of realism and interest. The ideas for this movie are excellent.

Now we get to where this is a great attempt but it falls short of being a truly great movie. Until about three fourths of the way through the film everything is going great, acting, directing, special effects, everything is good. Then it almost feels as if they ran out of funds. Special effects are the first to go which is excusable except that they had been so good earlier in the movie you expect it to continue. Then the last five minutes or so of the film is a huge let down. The acting goes to hell next (excuse the pun) with Depp being the only one that remains in character for the whole film, most of his support falls apart. The story takes a turn that I can only assume was meant to be a plot twist, but instead it broke the plot in half and it died.

Directing for the last few minutes of the film definitely broke down as well. I won't give away the story but it's very sad to see a film with so much potential die so horribly. The entire group I saw this with agreed that the movie was great until the last few minutes.

Worth a watch, but be ready for a disappointing ending.",1141862400,9,2221,4.383495145631068

The movie starts with a book collector writing a note (which we will never know its content) gets up and hangs himself.

The movie continues when a book dealer is hired by a rich book collector, to authenticate a personal copy of a rare occult ancient text, rumored to open the gates of hell, saying that only 3 copies have survived through out the years. The dealer must travel to Europe, examine the other 2 copies and retrieve or verify which is the real version. (the investigated copy was originally owned by the collector who hanged himself in the beginning of this movie)

The dealer, worried someone stealing the valuable book, puts it in a safe place at a book shop. The next day, the owner of the book shop is dead (and we will never know why or who killed him).

The dealer goes to Europe, examines the books and the owners end up dying as well and their books burned. (again we will not know why)

Finally the employer of the dealer burns himself and die as well. (I am not sure why either)

I believe the producer needed 5 hours to complete the full script in this movie. Instead he only had 2.

1093670,4,6305897786,"I loved this movie from the first time I saw it.  Johnny Depp was great as Corso and while I dislike Seigneur as the ""Girl,"" she was perfectly creepy for this part.

It was totally scary and fascinating at the same time, especially about the obsessions with old books by collectors to the point where morality ceases to exist.  It also points out the emptiness of people's lives where they have to turn to playing with fire, such as seeking out the devil (they can find the devil on any street corner and in Congress and the White House).  Others seek out religion to avoid reality.

But, mainly, I loved it for a good horror story that it was.  And the soundtrack was truly wonderful.  It introduced me to the gorgeous voice of Sumi Jo, and made me a fan forever.

And it had the benefit of introducing me to the works of Arture Perez-Reverte, a wonderful Spanish author.  The Club Dumas, however, had more going on than the movie, which focused on only one part of the book (much like the film version of East of Eden only focused on the last 100 pages of the book).

And the ending was no surprise!

b Spoiler Ahead

Corso wound up exactly where he wanted to go: to Hades to meet the Devil, although he did meet him/her.  S/he picked Corso out, knowing the A-type he was.  I loved the image of him walking right into the ""lion's den,"" like a lamb to the slaughter.  Great scene and quite chilling.

1093735,4,6305897786,"This film is a great introduction to The Club Dumas by Arturo Prez-Reverte.  What's missing in the film is almost deducible from the title of the book.  An entire subplot is removed to simplify the film.  This was probably Polanski's only and best decision.  The literary sub-plot had to go, but unfortunately, this film does suffer from the lack of credibility that subplot brought to the overall structure of the work.  In the movie, we are asked to believe that Depp is a rare-book vulture/genius while he smokes all over a work that is worth millions.  At times there are references to things left out of the movie (the Raymond Chandler reference toward the beginning) and other odd anachronistic moments, but we are too often distracted by Polanski's gimmicks for them to be believable.  And, finally, the Devil.  Hmm, well, even the book didn't pull that off well.

For all its flaws, this is a good film.  Almost everyone who enjoys it likes the same things - the books, the attitudes, the intrigue.  There is virtually no horror and the devil stuff comes off a bit lack-luster, like Polanski returning to the tried and tested well of ""Rosemary's Baby"".",1133136000,,1160,4.778894472361809

The distraction caused me to lose track of the plot.  I tried again some months later and really enjoyed the film from start to finish.  The ending is a bit British Hammer Horror flick circa 1960's, but I won't give away the details.

Johnny Depp and Frank Langella are both perfectly cast as Dean Corso and Boris Balkan, and the creepy supernatural undercurrent is crafted into a gripping 133 minutes of storytelling by a director who must be the grand master of the occult genre, Roman Polanski.

1093738,4,6305897786,I really enjoyed this movie.  I would have to say though that the first half of the movie is better than the second.  The deus machina or maybe daemonus machina kinda ruined it for me but the parts without her are really excellent.  As someone who works with rare books it was really exciting to see a movie like this!

Only 3 copies have survived the sands of time and fires of the inquisition. Depp must examine the other 2 copies, and retrieve the real version ""at all costs"".

If you are looking for the typical Hollywood drivel, then this movie is not for you. If you want a well-written, intelligent supernatural-suspense film, then watch The Ninth Gate. The film is littered with symbolism, and many subtleties that only become evident after watching the movie a second or third time. I found myself scratching my head wondering how I missed these on the first viewing. If you have an interest in the occult, then you will enjoy the film on another level as well (i.e. the illustrations in the book resemble the Rider-Waite Tarot, the book itself is reminiscent of grimoires like the Lesser Key of Solomon, and the Abbe de Torqia brings to mind 'heretics' like Giordano Bruno).

Unfortunately, this movie has probably earned a lower rating than it should have. Half of the poor reviews seem to have been written by adolescent bimbos who watched the movie because they think Johnny Depp is dreamy. The other half by dimwits who expected demons with bad prosthetics to jump around and eat peoples' entrails.

The movie is  well-casted and well-plotted.  Although I disagree with most of Johnny Depp's choice of roles, I have to admit that Depp is one of the greatest actors of my generation.  Some people are just naturals.

It's a very European movie.  That means lots of books, lots of faux-philosophical discussions and themes, lots of cigarettes and lots of espresso drunk out of semi-demitasse cups in coffeehouses.  There is action in the movie, but it's not a driver like in American movies.",1126051200,4,917,4.68125

Again, the first part of the movie is intreaguing, creepy, and all that. But then I don't know, the movie begins to become way to predictable and you have most things figured out before Johnny Depp does. I had the whole main plot figured out and it was only the middle of the movie. Still, I expected for something more to happen since the movie started out so good... sadly nothing does and then when the ending finally comes, it is EXTREAMLY anti-climactic. Now I wasn't expecting a big special effect extravaganza or anything but at least some information or something. THe movie just ends. You can kind of guess what happens next but there are still MANY unanswered questions and no amount of information that the audiance is waiting for. It just stops.

It could have been a much better movie. It started out well... slides and then just drops off the edge of a cliff.

1093786,3,6305897786,"The ninth gate could have been a classic thriller, if only it didn't give us cause to laugh hysterically through the whole thing.

First of all the acting. To call that acting is to say that Roman Polanski can actually make a good film. Its not possible, frankly, the acting was horrendious. Its been said that you cannot have a terrible Johnny Depp flick, and I whole-heartedly agree. But you can have a very meodiocre one. Even Johnny Depp seemed lost with his lines, as all the actors fumbled through the story, trying desperatly to fulfill their characters actions, and failing dreadful.

And don't get me started on the ending. There's nothing too it, we know that Johnny has found the ninth gate, but whats behind it? Where does it go? Only he knows because all the audience is allowed to see is light shining from the doorway, and his figure heading into it. Also, we gather that his guardien angel could or could not be lucifer incarnate. Even the pictures from The book of nine gates isn't very clear on this.

Scenes that could have been scary become rather mundane as the film wears on, and actions seem ludacris as women fly, and men punch each other out without seeming to hit each other. Good for movies from the fifty's, but something from nowaday just doesn't cut it.

Johnny Depp is interesting to watch however, as the suave indifferent Indiana-Jones type, who is not only sexy but scholery to boot. His complete indifference to what goes on is what makes him unique for everyone else seems to full of melodrama to be of any real help to the script. Such as the Madam Telfar (Lena Olin) who seems to whole-heartedly delight in scratching and clawing every available guy that comes around. Enough was enough when she tried it on Johnny after sleeping with the guy. But second helpings get old.

On the whole I thought this could have made a decent thriller, but fell short, however it is good as a rather light-hearted romp of (evil?) proportions. Just don't get your expectations too high.",1117152000,3,2007,4.642253521126761

An interesting feature to the DVD was being able to watch the picture with no dialogue, accompanied only by the intermittent score. Roman Polanski's commentary was also interesting.

A second viewing offered up details that I missed before like the picture on Balkan's vault mirorring the postcard to the Baroness and yes, the girl really did 'fly' down the stone stairway and from the second story.

Watch the scene with the 'twin' booksellers in Spain. Roman Polanski explains how the scene was done with one actor playing both parts. Watch it again, noticing the cigarette smoke never drifts to the right side of the screen where the second 'brother' stands.

That which we in the ordinary life and interests call evil is, like Depp's Corso, a blind for the seeker and his quest for answers.

If you have no seeker's soul this movie will bore you. Buy the book. But if 'mysteries' means to you something a bit more than this is a fun movie.",1093392000,2,755,4.378571428571429
1093870,1,6305897786,"There are a lot of reasons why I went to see The Ninth Gate. Perhaps top on the list is because the director, Roman Polanski, is the man responsible for the highly disturbing, yet artistically sound Rosemary's Baby. But it's also because of the movie's subject matter, i.e. Beelzebub, the Lord of the Flies, Lucifer, and Mr. Boogedyman...whatever you choose to call him. Satan.

 You can take a look at the past, oh, twenty-five years, and it's amazing how Satan's popularity fluctuates in pop culture. With movies like Dracula, Rosemary's Baby, Prophecy I & II, and End of Days forming the backdrop of our modern experience, it seems like today's society finds the subject fascinating, if not ""cool."" Satan movies are all the rage. So I went to The Ninth Gate to see if the subject matter gets the same distressing treatment found in End of Days-to see if Polanski didn't sacrifice plausibility for pizzazz.

 He did.

 The flick follows book dealer/con artist Dean Corso as he attempts to verify the authenticity of a book for book collector/Satan-lover Boris Balkan (who is also filthy rich). The book is called The Ninth Gate, and it was supposedly written by the devil, who even drew the cute little pictures found in the pages. The theory is that if you get all the pictures together and speak some rudimentary Latin, the Dark Angel himself will pop up and shoot the breeze with you for a while. In a twist of what I suppose is irony, the motto of the book found on the title page reads: ""Thus let the light shine."" That nutty Satan! He's all into irony.

 What is redeeming about this film? Two things. The tone, for one, is good. Polanski didn't rush himself, and so he reproduces the same eerily hushed quality found in Rosemary's Baby. Johnny Depp, playing Corso, delivers a well-measured performance in sync with the movie's atmosphere. Unfortunately the tone of the movie demands substance. This film has none. It relies so much on the weight of its subject matter that the audience members are left essentially clueless on some basic plot points.

 A lot of reviewers are going to harp on the ""artistic integrity"" of this film, and to its credit, the cinematography and editing are excellent. But good timing and restraint are not workable substitutes for a decent story. Depp's character starts the movie with the type of noncommittal attitude necessary for the plot, but by the end, his indifference is reflected by the audience. Polanski mistook confusion for art. When there's not a strong story to guide the mood, even the best craftsmanship becomes meandering nonsense (see Eyes Wide Shut).

 However, even with the mish-mash of supernatural gumbo, even with the unfortunate and undecipherable ending, and even with the cartoonish side characters more fitting for a Sandman comic book, the movie at least doesn' t TOTALLY glorify Satanism. I'm all for dissing the devil's fan club. Most worshippers of the devil, it seems to say, are self-indulgent whiners who just need an excuse to hold orgies. What a burn.

 But that's one brief, fleeting moment in the film. It's an instance of inflated self-awareness that loses steam fast. Polanski gets his jabs in on the devil's followers, but the conclusion of the film makes him seem sympathetic toward the devil himself. As if his acceptance of Satan wasn't enough to distance the movie from the typical non-evil-promoting viewer, that very acceptance is so clouded in distraction and ""artistic integrity"" that the only thing getting burned when the credits roll is the audience.",1091491200,16,3543,4.903010033444816
1093871,3,6305897786,"I enjoyed Ninth Gate not because it's a great movie --and it certainly is not, but because it's incredibly funny. Johnny Depp plays Dean Corso a seedy book dealer who will do whatever needs doing to get his book for his well heeled clients. He's not a nice man and he's more cunning than smart. His client Mr. Balkan, played by the always fascinating Frank Langella has a book that was supposedly co-written by Lucifer himself and he needs to know if it's authentic. Corso of course, does not believe in such things and is only intersted in his fee.

The former owner of the Ninth Gate book wants it back and everyone who has another copy of the book or who Corso talks to about the book ends up dead in horrible ways but Corso is too dumb or too greedy to really be frightened. That's a flaw in the script but it's also unintentionally funny. Any sane person would've realized that this is no ordinary antique book deal and would've quit after the first death. Corso makes a weak complaint to his client and just plods along.

The expressions on Depp's face when he finds the bodies is a hoot. Other than those fleeting moments he has no other normal reaction to all the death and menace. It's like he's mildly sedated for the entire movie.

Another amusing thing is the lack of understanding about rare books that the movie displays. In real life an antique book expert would not chain smoke over a 300 year old book, nor would he place drinks next to it.

When the blonde with the green eyes and huge eyebrows shows up he simply thinks she's been sent by Mr. Balkan to watch him and provide bodyguard service. It never once dawns on him that this girl's uncanny ability to be always be where he needs her and to make things happen might be something more than natural.

The movie also features one of the silliest sex scenes ever filmed. Depp appeared to be doing an imitation of a man with a severe case of sudden diarrhea and the scene gets the biggest laugh of the movie.

So what is really good about Ninth Gate? Frank Langella, the actress who played the elderly Barroness, the two (Or was it one?) old guys who play the Spanish booksellers and the scenery.

What's not so good? The script and direction. Polanski lost his touch years ago and it shows. Still, as long as you don't expect genuine horror or suspense you can have a good time with Ninth Gate.  The foolish plot and inconsistentcies are a nitpickers dream.",1091318400,8,2427,4.45045045045045
1093872,3,6305897786,"This film is well done but it takes on far too deep themes for what it is; a film noir.  This film does an excellent job of capturing detective film noir cliches, but because the mystery involves such grand ideas as satan coming to earth and good vs evil that the detective genre cannot do these themes justice.  We have an excellent cast filling out all the classic characters of film noir detecive intrigue.  There's Johnny Depp as Corso, the vice-ridden detective who ends up playing all sides to the middle.  There are a couple of femme fatales with their own agendas.  And there is the mysterious millionaire who hires the private dick to perform a seemingly simple task, but with an alterior motive.  If this was just a story about a grimy P.I. who plays a bunch of greedy schemers against each other and walks away with a fistfull of dollars it would have been fine, but he walks away with the power to summon the devil.  This movie never really deals with the dark ideas which its plot is based around, but that does not stop it from being amusing, it just never ends up as satisfying as 'Devil's Advocate', or 'The Exorcist'.",1090454400,2,1134,4.5024390243902435

The only FLOP I see is their editing of essential footage.  They have condensed the movie to under 2 hours...and have subsequently made certain scenes appear as ""stupid"" (for lack of a better word).
This movie grew on me.  I was not intially impressed, but after viewing it with friends and family, I have become a big fan of its haunting yet calming persona.  The subject matter deals with Satanic idolatry, but the movie is in no way ""goth"".  It's the kind of film you could watch with your children and not worry about them being scarred for life.
As far as comedy, Johnny Depp's bad luck with women is hilarious.  His facial expressions (even while killing ""the albino"") are a hoot.
As for the ending, after many viewings I believe Depp went to hell where he was praised for being the human father of the anti-Christ.  All along, the lady in the sneakers was Satan.",1087689600,5,991,4.628571428571429

I was riveted. Riveted, that is, right until the somewhat confusing fire and cobblestone ending, which admittedly leaves you with very little to chew on and instead of appearing clever and ambiguous, as it perhaps wanted to, mostly comes off as complacent.
Yet, the point of a mystery noirish film is to keep you intrigued through out, and the movie manages to do that quite successfully. The sleuthing process is almost done in tandem with the audience, which is fun. Johnny Depp is immaculate in his potrayal of a detached book detective and all others contribute richly. The music is tacky in bits, but not too distracting.

1093965,4,6305897786,"By skimming the huge number of reviews, you'll quickly see that viewers tend to either really like or really hate this movie. There are apparently plenty of reasons to do either, and both.  But the truth is that this is an intensely layered story, and it assumes that members of the audience are either going to catch a lot of its subtleties or they are just going to see it as a flick on satanic intrigue that offers only mediocre thrills and chills.

As to the satanic veneer of this story, it should be taken more as a metaphor for how mainstream culture views gnostic, mystical, or magical spiritual paths, while also snickering at those who take satanism too literally. All the satanists in this movie are shallow buffoons, and it is the one guy who has no metaphysical pretensions (Dean Corso/Johnny Depp) who actually acquires the end that all the others were either seeking in vain or had despaired of ever finding.

Now let's dive beneath the surface to understand that it's a kind of dark ""Don Quixote"". The first half-hour of the movie is almost saturated with images and even references that establish the parallel. The major difference is that Corso isn't intentionally setting off on a noble quest, and instead thinks of himself as nothing more than an opportunistic and somewhat unethical businessman. His quest is inititally just for money, but in the process he demonstrates a passion for solving mysteries. There is no turning back for him once he realizes that he is on the trail of perhaps the biggest and most significant mystery of existence, even if it takes his life.

Much of the movie's hidden messages and meanings are revealed through obscure symbolic references.  Without a knowledge of Kabbalah, Tarot and alchemy, much of it will be quickly glossed over as superfluous occult imagery and ""mumbo jumbo"".  The first key is the whole idea of ""nine gates"", which can easily be thought of as a Kabbalistic allusion to an ascension of the Tree of Life. The ancient book that serves as the central prop of the story contains nine engravings, each of which has elements that are instantly recognizable to those already familiar with the imagery of Tarot and alchemy.

One layer that a number of other reviewers have found is the theme of the guardian angel. There is a great deal of Gnostic and Hermetic significance in the way this theme is played out between Corso and ""the girl"" with blond hair and green eyes. Perhaps it suffices to say that initially Corso only catches fleeting glimpses of her and is distrustful, but in time their relationship builds to one of greater cooperation, trust, and intimate compansionship. He comes to see her as his guide, protector, and lover.

The entire story could also be analyzed in terms of Jungian psychology.  Corso is of course the persona, the girl is his anima, and his shadow is played by a Black man with white hair, fitting in its reversal of Depp's white skin and black hair.

We could go into a lot more detail on each of the various layers already examined, but then what would be left for you to discover? ;-)

The only reason I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 5 was because I would have liked just a little more exploration and explanation of the story's depth for those who don't have an extensive background in esoteric, occult, and mystical studies.",1086566400,8,3334,4.721170395869191

Of course, the purpose behind this is not immediately clear, and the major strength of this film is the way in which it follows Depp as he begins to put the pieces of the puzzle together.  Director Roman Polanski shoots this in a way that allows us to make the discoveries right alongside him.  By the end of the film, however, numerous details have accumulated without amounting to much.  I was left in the dark about the true nature of Depp's mysterious female guardian (Emmanuelle Seigner), and  the significance of the film's final shot was lost on me.

I saw Depp less as a money-crazed book merchant than a ""student"" who simply took the opportunity to have other people support his studies, involuntarily or not.  He was amoral in his pursuit of the ""Ninth Gate"" in the purest sense: He didn't do it for love of money or immortality but simply because he wanted to find out what was on the other side.
My mixed feelings come from not being able to recommend or purchase a work by a wanted fugitive from justice.  Polanski raped a 13-year old girl and fled to France when he was found guilty.  He remains at large only because France refuses to extradite him.  Until he returns to the US on his own or in handcuffs to face the music I won't buy his work.",1086307200,2,789,4.268456375838926
1093968,4,6305897786,"I want to call it an action flick, but the action is pretty restrained. Maybe it could be an apolyptic movie, but it's too secular. Instead, it's what Depp seems to do well: interesting, even exciting, but not very well defined.
The plot is straightforward enough: the Mystic Book is out  there, and Depp is tracking it down. He is stalked by agents unknown, death and destruction follow in his path, and I won't spoil the end (not that there are too many credible endings to choose from).
This isn't an effects-fest, but Depp holds my interest anyway. He's a lot more believable than most action heroes. For example, his character spends most of his time in libraries, so he's not a physically impressive specimen. Happy to say, he is never called on for feats of superhuman strength. He barely knows which end of a gun to point where - sure enough, his first attempt to act threatening with one fails comically.
The one false note was that Depp was always smoking and drinking around the precious books. Smoke if you must, but not where the smoke will settle into the centuries-old paper. Drink all you want, but not where there is the slightest chance of getting even a drop on it. The conservator wannabe in me shuddered every time I saw the movie's disregard for the artifacts.
I almost gave it three stars for being an ordinary action movie. I gave it one more star, though, for all the mistakes it doesn't make.",1084147200,4,1418,4.582677165354331
1093969,5,6305897786,"I love ""The Ninth Gate"".  I have seen it many times since I first rented it back in the summer of 2000, and after buying it about a year or so later I have always made it a point to view it regularly.  Director Roman Polanski has given us another masterpiece of horror with some good touches of comedy, all wrapped up in a cloak of atmosphere so thick that you could cut it with a knife.  While I am not a die-hard fan of Polanski in the way I am with directors such as Tim Burton, I have seen and enjoyed very much three of his films: ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"", and ""Frantic"", and have observed elements found in each of those three movies to be definitely present in this one.  ""The Ninth Gate"" obviously has its maker's fingerprints all over it, which is good news for fans of his work.
""The Ninth Gate"" works great as a detective story, which is really what it is more a horror film.  Johnny Depp, my favorite actor hands down, takes us on a bizarrely fascinating journey through Portugal and France hoping to track down two of the three remaining copies of a book apparantly written by Satan himself during the Middle Ages.  Along the way, we watch him being followed and see some suspicious setbacks occur, along with his dealings with his employer, a millionaire Satanist by the name of Boris Balkan.
The good things I have to say about this film: first, the directing is fantastic, atmospheric and spellbinding.  You will be totally immersed in the goings-on of this film, in spite of its numerous quiet and thoughtful moments and overall slow-moving nature.  The European location work is gorgeous ... we see some beautiful and sinister cities, castles, and countrysides.  The movie looks and feels great.  Also, a bizarre and interesting choice was made to cast the same man as four different characters, who(m) we meet two at a time, first and then again later, in the same location.  Was this supposed to be symbolic or indicate something implicitly to the audience?
Second, the musical score by a fellow named Wojciech Kilar is beautiful; its haunting, subtle, and quiet.  It perfectly accents the scenes it plays behind, in no way upstaging the action or even drawing attention to itself.  Also, I loved the soloist (a Korean girl, I understand) who sang during the opening and ending credits.  I find it appalling that during the trailers advertising this film, they played some awful new-metal-crud in an effort to get all the MTV kids into the theater.  As awful as this was, I am very thankful that none of this music found its way into the movie itself ... it would be entirely inappropriate.  Kilar's compositions are spot-on perfect, and nothing else should have been used.
Third, I was really taken by the fascinating artwork done for the engravings.  They were almost tarot-cardish, and very bizarre.  I particularly liked the one of the guy hanging by his foot from a noose (and the way it figured into a later scene after we see it for the first time) and the image of the maze with the castle turrets.  The moment when we see the initials ""LCF"" in tiny letters hidden on particular ones was absolutely chilling.
Fourthly and finally, in spite of the fact that Johnny Depp is my favorite actor, I must say that it was Frank Langella as Boris Balkan who stole this movie away.  Balkan is a fascinating character, from his special library (did anyone notice the passcode he entered to unlock its door?) to his attitude toward phony Satanists (his little ""Boo!"" moment was classic), all the way to his unfortunate end.  His dedication to his beliefs could be both inspiring and frightening (check out what he says to Corso, Depp's character, when he tells him that the book has been stolen from his hotel room), and I enjoyed every moment that had him on the screen.  Langella's Balkan definitely comes away as this movie's most memorable character.  I am now very interested in seeing the version of ""Dracula"" he did back in the 1970s.
One final thing: I found interesting the director's choice to present Satanism in a more objective light than would normally done in films such as these.  I understand that Polanski really has no religious beliefs, so as far as he's concerned one is as good as another.  While I do not agree with this, it certainly makes for an interesting and original approach to the subject matter, and really works for this movie's benefit.
Give ""The Ninth Gate"" a try today.  The DVD has some good extras, including a nice commentary with the director, and the film itself has a very high rewatchablity factor.  You'll find yourself wanting to put this one into the player again and again as time goes on, and you'll find something new to enjoy about it every time.  Go for it!  You'll thank me.

That's what Boris Balkan, whose collection of ars diavoli, works about (and by) the Devil, is unrivaled, says to a group of Satanists at the climax of director Roman Polanski's The Ninth Gate.  It's risky having a character say something sarcastic that could apply to the movie we're watching itself.  The Ninth Gate doesn't resonate with deeper meanings like Rosemary's Baby, but as a Devil movie it's literate with good acting (Johnny Depp, Frank Langella, Emmanuelle Seigner, Lena Olin).
As much as I like subdued character-driven horror pictures like this, I agree with David Thomson in The New Biographical Dictionary of Film that it doesn't seem like Roman Polanski's film.  If I didn't already know Polanski directed it, I wouldn't have guessed.

I did like the ending.  It wasn't one of the apocalyptic clichs that usually wrap up this kind of horror film.  And it leaves one character's nature not completely explained.
I guess you can't do a Devil movie without mumbo jumbo.  Here Lena Olin's Baroness (or whatever) de St. Martin recites a Latin incantation; in Rosemary's Baby the coven next door to Rosemary and Guy murmur spells.  If you're going to summon the Prince of Darkness you've got to sacrifice a virgin, or at least call him on his cell.",1078876800,4,1273,4.861111111111111

He has no scruples and doesn't mind ripping off clients or lying to them to make them think that their collection is both more valuable and/or less valuable than it really is.  Corso does not really have morals and doesn't believe that God and Lucifer still have power in this world.  So when Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) approaches Corso and asks him to authenticate a rare book purportedly written by Lucifer himself, Corso takes the job.  Within hours of his acquiring Balkan's copy, Corso's friend is dead and he is being propositioned by Liana Telfer (Lena Olin) whose husband originally owned Balkan's copy.  Corso briefly entertains the notion of backing out, but Balkan's promise of more money keeps him on the job.
Once Corso has a chance to examine the book, he notices that 2 of the illustrations in the book are signed ""LFR"" instead of by the original artist.  Intrigued, he approaches Victor Fargas (Jack Taylor), a rare book collector who owns one of the other 2 copies of the book.  Sure enough, once he has examined it, he notices that 2 different illustrations with subtle, but telling differences were signed ""LFR"".  Unfortunately, Fargas is unwilling to part with the book and throws Corso out when he discovers who he is.  But Corso is not so easily dissuaded and, when he returns the following morning, he finds Fargas dead and takes the book.  He then travels to Paris to see Baroness Kessler's (Barbara Jefford) copy, but she refuses to even let Corso see the book, until he explains the differences in illustrations.  She turns up mysteriously dead also and Corso finds himself with all three copies and all of the illustrations labels ""LFR"".  Supposedly Corso now has all that he needs to summon Lucifer and gain some of his power, but he doesn't believe in stuff like that, does he?
The Ninth Gate is one of those utterly creepy movies that you both love and you hate.  I loved Johnny Depp's performance in this movie.  He was simply amazing in the way he took this character who is scum and made you care for him and made you like him and want him to win.  He starts off bad and he ends up worse, yet I felt myself urging him on and hoping he would end up the winner.  Roman Polanski did a superb job in making everything look threatening and mysterious.  He also throws off the viewers by adding in random things like Emmanuelle Siegner, a girl who follows Corso around.  You never know if she is a friend or a foe or exactly what she is, but you know that she is definitely not a ""good"" person.  Wojciech Kilar's music was very influential in the film and really makes your flesh crawl with his mesmerizing theme to the film.  However, the movie is missing a tight plot and it kind of meanders around and so you are never quite sure if you understand what is happening or not.  Also, I was not interested in learning about demonology and found the whole idea of conjuring up Lucifer to be ludicrous, but I was fascinated by the movie nonetheless.  Take the time to watch this film and I believe that you will find yourself both entranced and repulsed as I was.",1078444800,3,3188,4.554385964912281
1094065,3,6305897786,"Style over substance is the key in ROMAN POLANSKI'S NINTH GATE.  It's hard to believe this wickedly restrained Johnny Depp is the same one who floated through PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN.  Depp is an actor with a wide range and an intense desire to play roles one wouldn't originally see him in.  It's hard to tell in the beginning if Depp is a true hero, or is he just as bad as the notorious Frank Langella or the daffy Lena Olin.  Add Emmannuelle Sangier (spelling?) as a guardian angel named Green Eyes and one never really knows what's going on.  Unfortunately, the film is so cerebral it never manages to build any true sense of suspense or terror.  Polanski directs vividly, but with little regard for the emotional input of his characters.  The real star of the movie is the deliciously malevolent musical score.  At times mellow and melancholy, and then buoyant and teasing, it is a true musical score, that adds much to the cinematic goings on.

1094072,5,6305897786,"I watched this not knowing what was in store for me, and at the end of the movie, I was completely in awe of this powerful story. Johnny Depp's acting is good, but his somewhat scrawny body and his aged looks just weren't the reason why this movie kept me in my seat throughout. No doubt the story isn't very realistic - its basically about the forces - mainly the evil forces - in life - greed, lust, power... and Johnny Depp plays an underhanded book dealer who is employed by Balkan (Langella) to go on a trip to Europe to research an ancient Satanic book's authenticity. This entire movie is about Johnny Depp taking one long and life-threatening adventure tackling issues beyond what he normally avoids in real life.
Emmanuelle Seigner (and this is just some gossip for you - she's Polanski's wife in real-life!) plays the mysterious woman who appears to help Depp everytime he's faced with a life-or-death situation, and this casts suspicion on her true identity - is she human or is she not? What is she? These are all the questions that Polanski poses to the viewer as you go through the film watching Depp go through his journey which seems to be like a cat-and-mouse chase between him and the greedy people who are after the book's secrets. Seigner is completely mesmerising in her own right. She is very interesting to watch and so charismatic - and rightly so because Polanski filmed her in such a way that drenched her in an even deeper aura of mystery. Olin is good too, she is very convincing in a somewhat shallow role as an out-and-out money-grubbing chic French tramp who bites (literally).
There are certainly loads of questions left unanswered in the movie, but I think this is the intention of the director who wants you the viewer to make out the story how you want to see it. If you like a movie that features a great cast (albeit not your usual ""teen heart-throb"" Hollywood stars) shot in an European countryside backdrop, and a theme about the ""dark forces"" that leaves you thinking a bit - then you're sure to enjoy watching this. This movie has good pace. There's always something happening around the corner for Depp, and then there's always the question of ""Who exactly is that *girl*?""

It seems to have a unique, dark, unpredictable air, but its ending doesn't reflect that and frankly spoils the good work laid down by Johnny Depp. Not one of his best films, it must be said, but a truly awe-inspiring take on the occult, Satanism and the workings of Beelzebub.
You cannot help but be stricken by the clever interpretation of pure evil, the sickening graphic scenes of murder and destruction and Polanski's incredible ability to grasp your attention. It's just a pity that through an intricate, gripping plot comes an inadequate and disappointing end.

1094154,5,6305897786,"Let's be clear about ""The Ninth Gate"": the movie is easily one of Roman Polanski's best, and certainly one of the most deliciously creepy, eerie, unsettling and deeply atmospheric films about diabolism and deviltry ever made.
With a script drawn from Spanish author Arturo Perez Reverte's quirky ""Le Club Dumas"", ""The Ninth Gate"" is the Faustian tale of an unscrupulous New York dealer in rare books (played with tactful understatement and curiosity by Johnny Depp) commissioned by secretive tycoon and rare book collector Boris Balkan (played to the hilt by Frank Langella, who nearly steals the show)to authenticate his copy of the Nine Gates to the Kingdom of Shadows (De Umbrarum Regni Novem Portis).
That innocent-sounding assignment isn't nearly as easy as it sounds. For one thing, there are three copies of the demonic tome, printed by a 17th century Venetian bookbinder (later burned at the stake for his troubles) and reputedly capable of summoning Satan; Balkan wants Corso to examine the two other volumes (one in Spain, the other in Paris) and determine which is the forgery.
Another complication lies with Balkan's book: its previous owner hanged himself shortly after selling his volume to Balkan, and his wealthy widow (played by a supple and cat-like Lena Olin) wants it back. And if that weren't enough, as Corso is drawn deeper into the mystery, those around him begin to die horribly and mysteriously.
""The Ninth Gate"" is a rich, heady, delicious mystery, and its palpable sense of growing menace is given nice counterpoint by Director of Photography Darius Khondji's (""Se7en"")lush cinematography, which tracks Corso on his quest through a host of forbidding and enchanting locales: from a decaying Spanish manse, to a Parisian occult library, to a Black Mass in a French castle, to a shadowy and seemingly demon-haunted Manhattan (recreated by the exiled Polanski on a backlot), with the action culminating in a ruined French fortress.
The look of the film constitutes a character in itself; the Black Mass in Liana Telfer's restored family chateau recalls the orgy sequence in Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut (indeed, the films echo each other in their suggestion of malefic, monstrous forces gliding beneath their gilded and luxurious surfaces). This is a film that dwells on its haunted spaces, a film full of moonlit parapets and occult libraries full of leather-bound volumes. Even the woodcut details of the Nine Gates (drawn from Reverte's book) draw the viewer into a world of recondite and forbidden knowledge. Watching the movie is like being granted admittance into a secret society.
The creepiness is nicely accentuated by Wojciech Kilar's haunting score, which is by turns engaging and urging Corso on (the ""Bolero"" like theme undergirding Coros's flight to Madrid) and warding him off.
It has been said that the best terror is painted on a palette of silence: ""The Ninth Gate"" is a quiet film, a masterwork of atmosphere whose chief terrors are never directly seen. Indeed, Polanski took Reverte's eccentric and erudite ""Club Dumas"" and plumbed and distilled its essence into a creepy, understatedly scary little film, a minutely detailed little cinematic treasure box whose ultimate horror takes some time to truly sink in.
All of the performances are well done, even the small ones. Veteran actor Jack Taylor is splendid as the last scion of a dying aristocratic Spanish family, Emmanuelle Seigneur is alternately hideous and gorgeous as the mysterious Girl that hounds Corso's footsteps (watch her face closely in the movie's final minutes), and Barbara Jefford provides an elegant turn as occult maven and scholar Baroness Kessler.
There are a few mis-steps, but nothing fatal: the fight between Olin's thug and the Girl by the Seine is clumsily mounted, and the henchman himself, with his platinum blonde hair and effete mannerisms, more closely resembles an extra from a Madonna video than a Satanic assassin, but that's quibbling in a movie this rich and engaging.
With that out of the way: Talk about a mismatch between Marketing and Movie! I think most of the problems viewers had with ""The Ninth Gate"" stems from the way the film was advertised; the movie came out around the time of Arnold Schwarzenegger's ""End of Days"", and the marketing campaigns were similar: fire and brimstone quick cuts and heavy metal musical riffs, leading many to the conclusion that both films would offer CGI-demon slaying.
""The Ninth Gate"" is not an action movie, nor is it straight horror. If that's what you want to see, then you really shouldn't waste your time. If, on the other hand, you want a deliciously atmospheric movie about a kind of diabolic treasure hunt (with the Devil Himself as the prize), then ""The Ninth Gate"" is eerily pungent, devilish fun.

1094156,4,6305897786,"Rewatching this movie recently I was struck by how much it improves upon subsequent viewings. The subtle nuances of Johnny Depp's performance reveal themselves only to confirm that he is definitely one of the greatest living actors working today.
It's easy to see why mainstream audiences stayed away from this movie. There is an uneasy mix of playful, black humour and serious dread throughout that constantly keeps the viewer off balance -- in a good way. Also, Depp plays a decidedly unlikable character -- right from the start, where he screws a hapless family out of rare, expensive books, establishes that he is an unscrupulous book dealer only in it for the money. However, Depp's own natural charisma maintains interest in his character and even makes him kinda sympathetic in a weird way as he gradually realizes that he is in way over his head.
The use of European locations is excellent and effectively establishes an atmospheric vibe that gets me every time. It doesn't hurt that the film is shot by DP extraordinare, Darius Khondji (Seven). Every frame of this movie is beautifully shot.
The DVD itself is pretty good. The extras are a bit on the slim side with a superficial (and extremely brief!) Making Of featurette but the real crowning touch is an audio commentary by the man himself, Roman Polanski. He starts off a little slow but once he gets going, offers quite a few interesting tidbits and views on filmmaking (and, of course, the movie itself) and is definitely worth a listen for Polanski fans.
This is an underrated film that is definitely worth a look if you like something a little different in your films. It doesn't hold your hand like most Hollywood fodder does and this a refreshing change.",1062633600,4,1724,4.827702702702703

Johnny Depp and Frank Langella both give great performances. Darius Khondji's photography is amazing and it has an even more amazing score by Kilar. The majority of the film was shot on location and is like a guided tour through Europe.
Ignore the negative reviews and comments from people who've been brainwashed and blinded by the current Hollywood fast-food style of film making with the intention of only appealing to the lowest common denominator.

First off, I wonder who is that girl (played by Polanski's significant other) suppose to portray and why is she helping Dean, played by Johnny Depp admirably, and not Boris Balkin, the person who hired him to search and enthenticate the Ninth Gate book. I think she suppose to be Satan itself, watching over him if not one of his agent (like a guardian angel's). It seems to be the case since Dean has broken some of the deadly sin's in his ruthless pride for himself only and his lack of care for others. Satan does the choosing but it was ab odd way of showing that in the movie, like why go thru the motions, like why can't she just tell him the missing pieces. And what's with Satan having sex with Dean near the end have anything to do with the Ninth Gate????  Was Dean suppose to give Satan's (multi gendered i persume) a demon child? If so, what does that have anything to do with this movie. This seem to fit another demonic type movie that i saw before but it doesn't fit here...sorry.  Beside, if her face expression during the sex scene is suppose to put fear into our eyes, it could of did a better job since that wasn't even the same person at any point of the face change.

This is not a horror movie and it wasn't suppose to be one but was attended to be a pychological thriller and in that, it acheive it in a slow pace way that only Polanki could. There is no doubt that Polanski can direct movies with his wonderful camera angles at making the viewer feel like they are there as well. The ending was a disapointment because it doesn't make sense yet i enjoy the movie nevertheless.

No...what sticks out in my mind, looking back about this movie is the sheer, ungodly amount of screentime the director spent filming traffic scenes.  Not car chases, mind you, but slow, speed-limit and under, normal traffic.  Every moment of one character's journey from one location to another, all painstakingly documented for posterity.  Nothing too mundane for this movie to show, by God!
I started commenting about it in the theater.  Since we were almost alone in the theater, no one seemed to mind--it helped break the coma-like atmosphere.

And about devil or Satan, i am far from knowing them so i don't know if i've ignored something in this movie. 2: How did Dean Corso's journey let him fall in...the hell(?)? i don't think it has been answered very well. If we want to let someone fall down the hell(a so deep and dark place) we have to let him do really bad things. Or don't let him do simple good things. I think we need more stronger evidence here. I guess the director tried to say someone never did things against the law and he could survive cleverly and no one(a good friend) reminded him to go back anyway he left God and was attracted by the world of evil gradually, day by day and suddenly, it is too late to do anything to go back. I think this movie needs more key details to describe this process. And this man should be obvious cleverer than all other people he's met. Yes Dean Corso is clever in this film but maybe he can be cleverer in some aspects. He must be able to tell good and evil. But because nothing can remind him to admire the good feeling when he closes good things so he always ""forgets"" them.

1094265,4,6305897786,"From the day The Ninth Gate was released theatrically, it was a criminally underrated film that was bashed by critics and ignored at the box office.  However, what lies in The Ninth Gate is a creepy, atmospheric suspense/horror film that is more than worth a watch.  Johnny Depp stars as a rare book authenticator named Dean Corso, who becomes employed by a demonologist played by Frank Langella to authenticate a rare book that, according to legend, was written by the devil.  Corso ends up going across Europe when he uncovers a vast conspiracy to find the book, and Depp is at his most cynical in his role.  If it wasn't for Depp than The Ninth Gate would lose most of it's charm; one of the reasons I like Depp so much as an actor is the eclectic roles he takes in some of the daring films he has done.  Films which he powered like Edward Scissorhands, Nick of Time, Sleepy Hollow, and Dead Man are all films that most actors wouldn't dare take a role in, but Depp has always been a daring actor, and The Ninth Gate belongs in that category.  Director Roman Polanski uses some great camera work and the creeped out atmosphere adds to the film, along with the fact that the atmosphere makes you feel like you never know what is lurking around the corner or is just outside the frame of the camera, all of which adds to the suspense making The Ninth Gate a great thriller.

1094266,5,6305897786,"It has been a while since Roman Polanski has created a good movie.  In the Ninth Gate Polanski shows us that he still has the knack for turning out an attractive and interesting film.  The Ninth Gate is a neat razor cut out of a wonderful but convoluted book, The Club Dumas.  The concept of a banned book from the 17th century slowly emerges out of a quest to authenticate a part of The Three Musketeers.
In the Ninth Gate our mercenary ""hero"" played by Johnny Depp is immediatly put in harm's way with a charge to authenticate a book supposedly co-authored by the devil. Polanksi skillfully leads us into a suspensful mystery that mid-way through begins to get atmospheric and supernatural.
What the movie does not do is toss buckets of blood into the viewer's face as a idiot's version of horror and suspense.  What the movie does do is lead one deeper and deeper into a eerie and scary world of ruthless people and the creepy thought that the book might actually be written by the Devil.  The music is at once beautiful and atmospheric. The supporting cast is perfect, especially Frank Langella who is haughty and villanous.  We are also treated to Emmanualle Seigner who let us think she is an angel, or a demon, or a familiar.
The DVD version has a voice over commentary by Polanski who explains the ins and out of the film.  There is also a feature that singles out the music.  The DVD edition is crisp and clear.
Some have said that The ninth Gate displays Hitchcock style.  It actually shows Polanski style with a nod to Val Lewton.  It show us a character who increasingly has to look over his shoulder for fear of some dread fiend behind him.

Many don't like the pacing of the movie, for Polanski uses many developing shots and slow pans and dollies, but this is effective in creating a certain uneasiness and atmosphere.
Polanski is much like Kubrik in his attention to detail and buildup of atmosphere and character, and not all viewers are accustomed to this style or care for it. It all comes down to personal preference I suppose.

The story is an interesting one, a type of story not often done in many Hollywood movies.  I won't go into details, as you can read the review of it on the product page.
The movie itself is dark if anything.  There is always that lingering fear and tenseness throughout.  The characters are portrayed pretty good.  There are always those people who have said that Depp is ""the most selfish person around"", and you really won't like him that well.  Well, you can make your own opinions on that.  It can be argued on various levels.
If you are looking for a change in movies, this would be nice to watch.  But I think for the average person, one would have to be in the mood to watch this, as there is little action and the story is kind of deep.  But overall, the movie has been superbly made.",1031616000,2,1017,4.310526315789474

I was truly shocked to read a negative critique of Emmanuel Seigner's acting.  She was fantastic.  I've not seen many people that can convey so much without speaking hardly a word.  I think to the role of the devil (or whatever incarnate she really was) is hugely challenging, compounded by the fact that this role of the evil one, was supposed to be one that we could fall in love with.

Instead, they choose the most exciting strand of the story and take it in a new direction.  Unfortunately, the resulting film starts much better than it ends, with the gripping eeriness of the first half disintegrating into unintentional comedy towards the end.  What saves it are its style and the performances.  Johnny Depp is typically wonderful as the unscrupulous book hunter, Dean Corso, and Frank Langella proves he can still be incredibly menacing - even when he's just a voice on the other end of the telephone.  Polanski manages to inject his tale with enough tension and style to keep you interested, Wojciech Kilar's music is a perfect match, and Darius Khondji's cinematography, as always, is simply astonishing: every shot is exquisite.

Johnny Depp gives his usual dark intensive performance.  If he smokes as much in real life as in this movie, he should be dead from lung cancer within five years.  There is something extremely sexy about this character.  His character is believable as one could be as a book collector/dealer, that does not mind having very little scruples.
Who here would not suspect Frank Langella as an avid book collector ""only wanting Depp's character to compare pictures from three volumes of the same satanic book""?
I enjoyed the comparisons in the mysteries of the three books, as well as finding the ""girl"" intriguing.  I also admit that the deaths of three collectors of the same devilish book, to be extremely comical.  The look on the face of the strangled wheelchair bound collector brought some humor to a very dark suspensful story.
I enjoyed every moment of this movie, mostly because I like movies that delve into the dark closets of the mind.  I did find that the ending left me thinking I had missed something.  So I watched it again, and nope, I didn't miss a thing.  I then created in my own mind, what I thought it all meant.

1094345,4,6305897786,"This is indeed a very intriguing piece of a bigger intriguing puzzle. Just like the movie, where three copies of one book must be found for the message of the books to make any sense, one must know the story of Polanski and his dance with the devil for this movie to make the mind boggling amount of sense it ultimately does make.
I loved the romance with books that the character of Johnny Depp has, being one who tracks down valuable editions and traveling in the circles of readers who value such things. The scenes of wall to wall rare books made my heart race the way some people are excited by football, or pornography, or chocolate. For me, it's books.
Depp must track down three copies of one volume to determine their authenticity, for each one is a little different -- only to discover, with his brilliant mind, that all three books work together to manifest the message of the books: the ability to conjure up the devil!
You can imagine the imagery that can be lent to such a thesis, and it exists as only Polanski can do it -- Polanski, of course, being the producer of Rosemary's baby and the former husband of the former actress Sharon Tate, and everything that goes along with that. Polanski is not naive when it comes to the oddities of Lucifer, of that I am quite sure. What his relationship is, exactly, is not for me to discern. I will say, though, that there were parts of this movie that reminded me, with discomfort, of Eyes Wide Shut.
This movie is not for everyone. It is definitely not for children. But it is worth taking a scholarly look at what is currently expressing our American culture.

It has this neat, creepy atmosphere with a haunting music score.
I like the sets, the soundtrack, and the basic plot.  And I think the actors play their characters very effectively.  Maybe some viewers didn't like the characters, but I think they were well played.
It seems to move slowly but somehow not in a bad way.  If the movie were accelerated / placed on steroids it would lose the unique atmosphere and become just another action thriller like so many others.
And I like the ambiguity in the story.  It adds mystery and leaves some elements up to the imagination of the viewer.  Which fits well with the storyline since its better to leave the details of things like heaven, hell, God, Satan, the afterlife, up to the viewers on concepts.

However, dark though it be, this movie is tremendously witty, and there is a quirky humor to the movie, aided by Johnny Depp's nailing the lead role down perfectly.  If you love this movie as I do, you MUST read the book its based on, The Club Dumas, by Arturo Perez-Reverte.  The Ninth Gate is a clever adaption of the book.  While the book has three interwoven plot lines (only one of them being based on the occult), the movie is basicly an adaption of one of those lines, with elements of the other plot lines being included for color personality and character development.  Endings differ as a result, but both endings are a good fit given the direction taken in each medium.  While the movie is thus a dramatic departure from the book in some ways, it is true to its spirit and Depp does a great job of ""getting"" the character in the book and bringing it to the film.  If the screenplay had followed the interweaving plot of the book loyally, the movie would have been much slower, and though I would still have loved it, I suspect it would have had even more trouble at the box office.  I can't say which I like better, the book or the movie -- a complement to both.",1019952000,5,1297,4.330578512396694

That's not to say that a film has to reach such an end to be considered good but this one in particular needed some sort of finality to it.  And that finality never comes.  However... the ride is very enjoyable but the ending (or shall I say, lack thereof) left me wanting.
Throughout the film I felt almost like I was watching an old Hitchcock film.  The images and backdrops lend themselves to the creation of a rather dark and ominous mood.  It was palpable and quite well done I might add.  But to me the Amazon.com reviewer hit it right on the head... the film never really went anywhere.  Now I can compare this to another Johnny Depp vehicle ""The Astronaut's Wife"" which, without reaching any real sense of finality, was to me much more satisfying overall than the Ninth Gate.

1094412,4,6305897786,"The Ninth Gate is an intriguing thriller that will put some viewers off because it is a throwback to a time when special effects were not king. There are virtually no F/X here and what few there are ones the movies could easily do thirty years ago. Personally, I enjoy seeing a good story and good acting, so I wasn't much bothered by this. I know that much of today's audience is conditioned to expect lots of graphics and thunderous noises. Knowing beforehand that they are mainly absent here may help some people to enjoy this occult story more.
Dean Corso [Johnny Depp] deals in rare books. He's not an intellectual. He's a shrewd operator, and it's all about money. When we first meet him, he is dealing with the greedy children of an incapacitated old man. He does his appraisal, and along the way, he talks them into selling a first edition of Don Quixote for $4,100. He makes a killing on the deal. His next appointment is with Boris Balkan [Frank Langella], a billionaire collector of books. Balkan has purchased one of three existing copies of a book published in 1668. The author was accused of witchcraft and burned at the stake. Balkan alleges that only one of the three copies is authentic, and he offers Dean a fortune to go to Europe in order to examine the others. Dean has no spiritual beliefs. He believes in profit. He doesn't think much about the deal until he notices he is being followed. Next his apartment is ransacked. He gives the book to a friend for safe keeping. This has dire consequences, but Dean decides to go on to Europe anyway. The other half of his pay depends on his going through with the deal. He goes first to Spain and then to Paris. Along the way, everything becomes spooky, and the death toll mounts. Dean starts to believe.
Depp, as usual, is great. Wearing eye glasses and sporting graying temples, he is totally believable in the part. Langella has only three scenes, but he makes the most of them. Barbara Jeffers is notable as a rich, hard-nosed book collector who sizes Dean up in about ten seconds.
Roman Polanski has lived in France for many years and has returned to his European roots as a film maker. The Ninth Gate has a much slower pace than did his Hollywood classics, Rosemary's Baby and Chinatown. Europeans tend to take their time in telling a story. They like to color things in. I enjoy this from time to time, but the pace will prove to slow for some viewers. I also should tell you that the 'payoff' at the movie's climax is pretty tame and ambiguous by American standards. We no longer comprehend the concept of understatement.",1016409600,2,2594,4.556745182012848

The book ('The Dumas club' by the Spanish author Perrez-Reverte) was an intricate detective story with a couple of killer twists; the movie is, basically, half the book.  If you liked the imagery of the movie then I seriously reccomend you read the book (which is a bit of a cross between Raymond Chandler and Umberto Eco), however if you've read the book, do not see the movie.  It can only let you down!  One of the major problems (apart from the hacking apart of the story) is that Polanski builds up suspense only to ruin it all by showing too much.  Scenes that would have worked really well in the background are played in main view and consequently, we're really given little doubt about what is going on.  However, the atmosphere is nice and Depp is superb.  Probably if you don't expect too much then this is a very nice film, but it's not up to the suspense of Rosemary's baby, as noted in the other reviews",1014681600,2,969,4.440677966101695

I was all set for a great supernatural detective thriller, with Polanski at the helm no less - what I got instead was a slow build of suspense, building... building... to no payoff.  The plot turns on Balkan's (Frank Langella) hiring of Corso (Johnny Depp) to find and buy for him two rare books - but Balkan's jumping on a plane and stealing them himself!  Why did he hire Corso in the first place?  So Depp could have several witty exchanges with Langella on the phone, each time asking him ""Where are you?"" without answer?  Not enough to hang a plot on, guys.
...Even if the ending is supposed to leave you to your own interpretation, as many reviewers have suggested, it's still a huge letdown and wrecks the movie.
I'm still shaking my head at this one.  Want a scary Polanski movie?  Try ""Rosemary's Baby"".",1014163200,4,990,4.533707865168539
1094415,1,6305897786,This movie has some great plot twists but it has a hard time reaching a peak.  Johnny Depp gives a wonderful perfomance of somebody whom the viewer hates in the beginning and is rooting for in the end.  Frank Langella also lends an outstanding role as a behind-the-shadows badguy for most of the movie.  This movie is worth seeing but it should not be on the top of anybody's list of must sees.,1012435200,3,394,4.36986301369863
1094416,4,6305897786,"Without being active into the World of Evil (I'll take God anytime, thank you) I was very gladly impressed by this movie. This is the story of a rare book specialist who becomes both entangled and fascinated in his search of the Devil. Johnny Depp stars as Dean Corso. He is subcontracted by publisher mogul Boris Balkan - played here by none other than terrorific Frank Langella. Balkan sends Corso off to Europe with an unusual task: to compare his own copy of ""The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows"" (a manuscript that has the particular quality of summoning the Devil) with the only two others in existence. And so the game begins.
I never even considered Johnny Depp as a good actor, but I was obviously mistaken, to the point where he's much improved. From the very first scenes Depp shows us just how much in command of his acting he is - as much as any good actor can possibly be. Frank Langella is nothing short of genial in his role of the calculating magnate. Lena Olin plays the part of a consumate ""dishy"" - as Corso puts it -, rich widow who desperately wants to get her own hands on Corso's copy of the sacrosanct book, a copy that used to belong to her husband, who hanged himself not too long ago.
So glad this is not a typical Hollywood movie. Johnny Depp aside, it is a Franco-Spanish production with local actors and sites, filmed totally in Europe. I loved the idea of the world of antique books as background for the story. Since I have a passion for book collecting, it was mother's milk to me. Just for that, the film will appeal to collectors worldwide. The leather bindings, the paper, the fantastic engravings... it makes one's mouth water. Moreover, there is superb acting from Depp and Langella; but every single role is extremely well personified, so kudos in numbers go to the casting director. The erotic scene of the castle in flames has to be one of the most impressive ones I've seen in cinema lately, and it will stay in your mind for a while, not because of what is shown but because of what is not. Typical of Polanski, his actual wife (Emannuelle Seigner) has a significant part too, but I won't tell, so you'll have to watch the movie. Enjoy.",1011398400,,2185,4.478696741854637
1094417,5,6305897786,"The promotions for this film made it out to be a fast-paced, rock video devil hunter yarn.  Instead, it is has a relaxing pace and a fairly quiet tone while still keeping the audience on their toes.
The biggest complaints about this film always come from the MTV generation.  If you want more action and demon-fighting, watch Spawn or End of Days.  I actually enjoyed those two, but that's another story.  There are always those who complain about films that don't take off as soon as they begin and last more than 1 1/2 hours.  Here's my advice to them: just sit still and pay attention for Christ's sake.
I always love a break from the pure, fair-haired, boyish hero type.  The Ninth Gate gives the audience a protagonist that some may dislike, but grow to like him as he actually becomes an even worse person during the film's progress.  No actor on this earth could have portrayed Dean Corso better than Johnny Depp.  The gifted Depp seamlessly blends sarcasm, violence, style, and charm into the mercenary book detective.
Corso's ally (Emmanuelle Seigner) appears in the form of a beautiful but plainly dressed wandering college student with supernatural powers.  With time, she proves herself to be a trustworthy protector and a perfect match for Corso.  Seigner's performance is comparable to Depp's, as her character's personality parallels Corso's to a certain degree.
Frank Langella is also noteworthy of his portrayal of business tycoon Boris Balkan.  Langella lends a strictly professional and calm attitude to his character, but also gives him a hint of eccentricity and a cold, forbidding, and dangerous side that Corso crosses midway through the film.
The plot is very original and only grows greater with a well-written script and an eerie, beautiful soundtrack.  The acting is superb, as already described.  The special effects are masterfully done.  Most do not understand the film's finale, and the commentary by Polanski makes it clear that he desires it to remain a mystery.  In a nutshell, though, the image of Corso walking toward the castle suggests that his adventure is just beginning and he is entering even more dangerous territory than before.  Corso's ""angel"" even tells him near the end that the game is over for Balkan, but not for him.
In conclusion, this film is incredible and highly recommended to those who enjoy a leisurely paced thriller.",1010793600,,2377,4.9646464646464645
1094418,5,6305897786,"Roman Pulanski's Ninth Gate is an enjoyable psychological occult thriller that follows in the footsteps of other great films like Rosemary's Baby and Angel Heart.  This is no blood and gore slasher flick.  The film follows the dark quest of rare book detective Dean Corso, played wonderfully here by a mousey and rumpled Johnny Depp in one of his most enjoyable roles.  Corso has been hired by wealthy publisher and self-styled demonologist Boris Balkan, played by a genuinely creepy Frank Langella, to authenticate his newly aquired copy of ""The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows"", a 17th century Satanic tome reputed to possess the ability to conjure the Devil himself.  The most enjoyable aspect of the story is how Corso's character changes over the course of his journey to the darkside.  He begins as a shady, self-centered mercenary, interested only in his share of the profit.  He himself seems to be a disgruntled bibliophile who now buys and sells rare volumes without care or affection for the people he works with or the books he swindles from unsuspecting collectors.  By the end of the film, however, Corso has himself become won over with the burning desire which consumes his employer Balkan in his drive to possess the very powers of Hell. A beautiful Lena Olin plays the equally obssessed former owner of the book who desperately wants to re-aquire it from Corso and will stop at nothing to do so.  What results is at times a slow but darkly entertaining tale of brooding mystery as Corso finally discovers the true power of the book and the secrets it contains.
There is a truly creepy feel throughout this film that compliments the subject matter quite well.  It does not rely on cheap quick scares or bloody axe murders which has become the bane of lesser films in recent history.  While I enjoy a good scare and plenty of good old fashioned gore, at times it is refreshing to find a movie that is intelligent enough to weave a good story and leave you wanting more.  The film leaves many questions to ponder as we follow Corso's quest to authenticate the Nine Gates.  What role does the Green-Eyed Girl, played by Emmanuelle Seigner, really play here?  Is she Corso's protector or the agent of his doom?  Is she the devil incarnate come to ensure the success of her satanic chosen one?  And what role do the Ceniza brothers, the old twin bookbinders from Spain, have to play in this?  Are they simply what they seem, helpful and knowledgeable about the book and it's unfortunate author Aristide Torchia?  Or are they also more than they appear...agents of the Devil perhaps?  This theme of being more than appearances runs throughout Ninth Gate, reflecting the fact that the Devil frequently works through seemingly innocent means and that appearances are often deceiving.  It reenforces in us the notion that evil and darkness surround us and are always watching, and that Satan is always looking for a few good men.",1010102400,6,2942,4.801587301587301

The film clearly operates on a three act structure. As many of you readers already would have read chunks of the story, I won't repeat it here. The first act is really good but weak on some levels, glimpses are seen of a film director at his best with his creation. Some touches are brilliant and we can't wait to get more. This is where the thread starts unravelling a bit. The second act. The second act follows the first act the same way with excellent all round touches then going downhill. When the third act comes, With all that happens before the final minutes, this is a very good film which takes its time but when it was over. My first thought was ""Huh?""
Clearly Polanski put care and love into this as it was to be his comeback kid and maybe somewhere in his fascinating mind,he got lost in a maze somewhere but this was one of the biggest let downs I have had ever watching a movie. I immediately dismissed it as ""a piece of crock"" the ending just ruined it all. But i kept hearing two stories..one camp stating my views, and the other one proclaiming a film at its best.
This intrigued me quite a bit, I certainly saw some magical touches with the music, the cinematography, sets and atmosphere which was very dominant and very classically executed shots but uh uh nope..bad movie.
I thought to give it another chance and oh boy this one is quite a thinker or a puzzle,and don't get me wrong , I like smart movies but am still trying to get this one. I purchased the DVD for cheap and saw it again. Yup, same good stuff I saw before but the ending really made me think. I still haven't come to a conclusion. I might be an idiot or a smarty for buying this one. But this film really has something going for it, Im very sure of it so you should give this one a chance, even if its a letdown, just be sure to put your thinking hat on and watch this one very very carefully.
As for the DVD, this is one of the best video transfers I have ever seen, Artisan has done an excellent job. It has to be seen to be believed how the colors come out, no hints of grain or any scratches, the blacks are perfect and the hues are brilliant. Very little chroma key effects are seen in some scenes but these are few. The sound is your standard 5.1 dolby digital with an aggressive mix. no complaints there and the extras are neat..The commentary by Polanski is entertaining and oh for heaven sakes i wished he explained the end but no...the dude left it to us. maybe it makes movie watching more exciting he thought. :)

Everything is mysterious in this film, especially ''The Girl'' (that's how she is credited), whose name is never revealed.

There are only three copies of this book in the whole world. One of them is in the United states, another one in France and the last one in Spain. But Corso (played by Johnny Depp, by the way) discovers that three parts of each copy are written by the devil himself...and three parts in three books make nine gates...and the ninth gate is the key to see the devil...A good film, especially for the settings...pretty enjoyable...",1001721600,3,1162,4.511848341232228
1094466,3,6305897786,"Roman Polanski's latest outing as director of the macabre is both amusing and disturbing, though never impressive. 'The Ninth Gate' was expected to be the director's comeback bid after the brilliant 'Death and the Maiden', and the top-notch star cast (save for Polanski's incredibly untalented wife) promised much. But what remains at the end of it is a confused, directionless film with no soul.
Johny Depp, who has been seen in better films such as 'Ed Wood', plays a heartless book dealer, who specializes in locating and trading valuable and rare books. The role seems interesting enough at the start of the film, and Depp's emotionless performance is intriguing, but after a while it just gets to be plain boring. He is hired by a mysterious satan-obsessed collector who wants him to trace two books that are supposedly written by Satan himself . If this isn't unbelievable enough, it gets even worse when Depp jumps at the idea (he does it for the money, people) and takes off for exotic foreign shores such as Lisbon and the French Riviera in search of the elusive works of the Devil. He also seems to have a Guardian Angel of sorts - a blonde puffy woman who follows him around everywhere. This role is played by Emanuelle Seigner, Polanski's real life wife, and its difficult to imagine a role more nonsensical. Its bad enough that Seigner is a depressingly poor actress, but to watch her drift in and out of the frames with no particular purpose, is quite enough. She fared far better in 'Bitter Moon' where she was cast aside Hugh Grant and Kristin Scott Thomas. She held her own in that film, but falters hugely in this one.
Depp's mission is this : armed with one of the books written by the Devil, he is to trace the other two and compare the contents, to decide which of the three is the original. This task seems hard to accomplish, as there are far too many people dying and too many weird incidents going on for Depp to feel comfortable. He is also followed around by Seigner and a dark-skinned motorbike-rider who seems to want him dead. Depp is repeatedly saved by Seigner, who reveals herself as non-human in one scene where she flies down the staircase rather than walk it (rather useful, don't you think?). The duo finally discover the secret behind this whole sorry tale, and the viewer is left wishing that they hadn't. This is not much of a story to begin with, but as the tale draws to a close, you begin to wonder if this really is a Polanski production. Everything is dismal, the lighting is bad, and the performances are third rate. Depp almost sleepwalks through the entire movie, even during the sex scenes (pity that they're as short as they are). Seigner, who has grown as an actress (and I mean this strictly in the physical sense of the term - she seems to have packed on at least 20 pounds since her last film) is eminently forgettable in her role as Angel, despite the secrets that are revealed about her toward the end of the movie (though you probably guessed it all along). The only time she looks remotely inspired is while shes riding Depp as they have sex outdoors. Its also the time Depp expresses any emotion, but its far too late for any of us to begin caring.
One wonders what the message of 'The Ninth Gate' is, and what the purpose behind making such a film is. The problem with this film is that it starts off looking terribly good - the opening sequences are very interesting - but half way down the line, you realize that it lacks any kind of direction. And despite Depp's dark, brooding role as a man with no conscience, his potrayal of the character is so ill-acted that its a shame. He could have done better, and one would say the same of Polanski.
Ultimately, the problem with 'The Ninth Gate ' is that it doesn't know what its about. If you want to know how a film shouldn't be made, then, by all means, rent this title (but for heaven's sake, don't buy it!). Personally, I haven't seen a film this confusing and disappointing, in years.

At times excruciatingly long, the Ninth Gate is more like Rosemary's Baby in relation to Satan.  The Devil himself never makes an appearance although his presence can be felt throughout the movie.  If you are not familiar with the Bible, particularly the Book of Revelations, you may be confused by certain characters(the woman following Depp) as well as the storyline.  Unlike the Exorcist, the Ninth Gate does not even show the Devil's handiwork, just the feeling of the presence.  Johnny Depp and Frank Langella make this rather dull movie quite exciting and as always Langella plays an excellant villian.  I would suggest renting it if you don't like to go over movies over time, but The Ninth Gate is a good purchase, the second time viewing it will help you understand the movie a little more and you will be more alert for certain clues than before.",999216000,3,990,4.828402366863905
1094469,3,6305897786,"Roman Polanski is without a doubt one of the great directors. His contribution to the genre has not been inconsiderable, having included masterworks like the madness point-of-view film Repulsion (1965) and the highly influential Satanic impregnation film Rosemary's Baby (1968), as well as the lesser known but highly absorbing identity-exchange horror film The Tenant (1976), and one non-starter, his heavy-handed venture into knockabout comedy, The Fearless Vampire Killers/Dance of the Vampires (1967). It is almost impossible to discuss Polanski without ever referring to the shadow his personal life casts - the tragic murder of wife Sharon Tate by the Manson Family in 1967 and his enforced flight from the US in 1980 to avoid charges of having sex with a thirteen year-old girl. And seemingly as though banished from Hollywood and the cinematic mainline, Polanski's career since 1980 has languished in a backwater, lacking the brilliance of his earlier work. There was the standout of Death and the Maiden (1995), but the majority of Polanski's work has been generally forgettable efforts such as Pirates (1986), and Bitter Moon (1992). The Ninth Gate is Polanski's long awaited return to the genre. Polanski has called it his ""Rosemary's Baby meets Eyes Wide Shut"", and has also alluded to his admiration for The Saragossa Manuscript (1965). The Eyes Wide Shut analogy seems a contemporary comparison more than anything else. Like Eyes, Gate features conspiracy societies that lavish in occultic ceremony in scarlet and black hooded robes. But with Eyes Wide Shut, Stanley Kubrick was really deconstructing a whole lineage of secret conspiracy society films rather than being one in itself. Gate does come close to Eyes's image of the robed society really being bored social elite dressing up in that it does briefly make contrast between sinister robed societies and a real Satanism, accusing them of only being play Satanists. Gate also include occasional elements of Saragossa with Polanski playing oddly convoluted games of synchronicity as the illustrations from the book start to play out in actuality. And certainly there is the connection to Rosemary's Baby in that both are films about Satanism, although both are also quite different stories. The film that Gate in fact most resembles is Angel Heart (1987) - both films feature an unbeliever on an detective trail involving the occult for a mysterious wealthy benefactor of dialbolic connections in which each contact made in the course of the investigation keeps getting killed. One was hoping that ""Gate""would be a much welcomed return to form for Polanski. But while not a bad film by any means, it sits along there with Pirates as one of Polanski's not-quite-rans. It lacks the absorbing directorial flourishes of films like Repulsion, The Tenant or MacBeth. Certainly there is a good deal of accumulating suspense and paranoia familiar to Polanski films like Rosemary's Baby and The Tenant - sinister images of people watching, a pair of feet outside the window of Russo's basement shop dropping a cigarette as they depart and another pair coming and stomping it out - which gives the film a quite engrossing atmosphere. And it is also filled with intriguingly offbeat background characters - the peculiarly friendly twin brothers who finish each other's sentences; the Baroness's butch secretary; the sinister bodyguard with the dyed-blonde hair; the wheelchair-ridden baroness and her casual mention of bored depravities; and of course the enigmatic, supernaturally-empowered figure of Emmanuelle Seigner's apparent guardian angel. But Polanski, while absorbing one, never really ever gives any of the atmosphere the opportunity to play off in a big flourish. You can't deny the film has you quite enwrapped by the end, but the end is where Polanski oddly falters. We see Depp go off to complete the mystery but the film comes to an inconclusive halt. Deliberate ambiguity is left hanging about exactly who Seigner is. And the final image of Depp departing off through the titular gate in a blaze of light drops a frustrating curtain across the show and keeps its transcendent mysteries all deliberately off-stage.

1094470,5,6305897786,"Movie Summary: Dean Corso is a rare book mercenary who'll do almost anything for his percentage. He believes in his percentage and it is what drives him. Dean is summoned to the private library of a very wealthy publisher. There he is offered a huge payday if he will authenticate the publishers copy of  very rare demonic book. There are only three known copies of this book left. Dean is to take the publishers copy and compare it to the other two existing volumes. As soon as Dean leaves the publishers office, his world changes. There are things going on that Dean does not understand. He must be very careful if he is to discover what is really going on.
My Opinion:  This is an awesome movie. It's deep and dark and creepy and has a sense of humor. Many things are hidden in this gem. To find its greatness you have to work though it. Many people don't like to do this especially when they are expecting entertainment. Don't be surprised if you don't understand it on the first viewing. It's not that kind of movie. It's not from the point of view that we are used to, so we distort what is going on to make it fit what we are used to. Dean Corso is not a good guy no mater how hard we try to see him as one. I tried. I rented this movie and ran out in the next two days and bought the book and the DVD. It's a kick in the pants. Listen closely to some of the music. It doesn't fit the scary scenes at times. I thought it goofy at first but really like it now. Johnny Depp is at his best fiddling with his glasses as Dean Corso. Maybe he'll let you borrow those glasses so you can see what is really going on too.
DVD Quality: Widescreen anamorphic - 2.35:1, DD5.1. Audio and Video are great. Extras include commentary, Making of Documentary, Production Notes, and Trailers.
What You Should Do:  Buy this DVD if you can handle working at a movie. The payoff is worth it. If you haven't seen it yet, then don't read any more reviews or spoilers. Jump right into the movie. Don't ruin it for yourself. If you have trouble with deep movies that need some work to figure out, then you should steer clear of this one.

This is a director that will continue to challenge his audience for years to come.

All I can say is that this movie is not for the average viewer who expects something to blow up every second, let their brain go to sleep and walk away after the film with a warm fuzzy feeling inside. This movie is for anyone who has ever felt the passion of collecting or experienced how thrilling research can be, and wants a change from the usual Hollywood heroics.
The audio and video quality on the DVD is good, and the disc has a lot of bonuses, my favorites being Polanski's full-length, in-depth commentary on the film and the 'gallery' which allows you to scroll through the 'LCF' and 'AT' engravings... which are reproduced in fairly low-resolution, unfortunately.
In the end I suspect 'The Ninth Gate' will recieve much the same treatment as 'Vertigo'- be misunderstood by its contemporaries and be rediscovered several decades later when its outstanding production features, superbly constructed plot and acting are finally recognized. I hope history remembers this film as being one of the best of the late 20th century, as well as one of the most revealing of our culture's psychology.

For if you've NOT READ the book, this creation by R Polansky might seem rather decent and thrilling: a detective-bibliophile (J Depp) hired by another rich book-collector to find a book presumingly written by Satan. Line of deaths follow J Depp's search and he also acquires a mysterious girl friend that can be out-of-this-world herself. J Depp fits into this part very well (angular lupine features, black-rimmed glasses, thin moustache). The music is menacingly demonic. There are no cheap x-effects or grotesque demons, a nice plot-twist at the end and on the whole it can be called ""an intellectual thriller"".
However, if you HAVE READ the book, the poor plot of the movie can't be even compared with a subtle puzzle of two sub-plots of the book (the Satanist one and the Dumas one) that hold your attention till the last pages, tons of information provided on ancient books, their authors and culture of collecting books, as well as on A Dumas, ""the Three Musketeers"" and their prototypes.
I advise you: 1) Watch this movie 2) Read the wonderful book 3) See for yourself how, for the hundredth time, a good book turned into a mediocre script as a victim for Director's ambition ""to please everyone"" and not to burden the audience with ""intellectual ballast"".

The slow pace of the film wouldn't have bothered me, but I waited for the ""pay off,"" which never came.  The ending is vague, and most people - me being one of them - will have no idea what became of the main character.  Even less satisfying than ""Eyes Wide Shut.""

While The Ninth Gate suffers from the typical book to movie problems, it is actually a good movie.  The book is, of course, much better since you get the full story and deeper insights into the characters.  The movie though manages to capture the main elements of the book.  After watching it, I was amazed how much of the book they managed to fit into the movie (in one form or another) even though most of the book was cut out.  <to understand what I mean you have to both read it and watch it...>
Johnny Depp did an amazing job as Corso.  He fit exactly the image I had created as I read the book.  All of the nuances of his character came out in the movie - the rumpled, alchoholic, smoker who is both like a wolf and a rabbit...
For all of you who have complained about this movie - I agree, the music didn't fit.  The music itself was not bad, but it was used incorrectly.  They tried to make The Ninth Gate a suspense/horror movie when it is anything but.  It is a mystery drama, and it was only the music that created any sort of suspense at all.  More mellow music would have been much better.  As for the ending, I loved it.  It was completely different that the book's ending, but it was still very good.  It provided closure to the movie without having to get into a lot of cheezy explainations.  In all I really liked the movie and was glad I watched it.",977356800,,1498,4.134948096885813

I won't go into the plot too much in my review, as there are many reviews here already that probably spoil the plot, but here's a quickie.  There were some books made, only few in existence, a few pages must be gathered from all the books to open super evil powers.  The main character (Johnny Depp) is led on a chase after chase, looking for this looking for that.  It was very mysterious but became overly reptitious after a few times.  Then there's a woman that seemed supernatural that helps him along the way.  The movie never explains who this woman was and why she was doing this.  The ending just shocked me because it made no sense whatsoever.  The movie will leave you shocked and angry.  It seemed like someone made a good film the first half, then gave it to another person to just finish it off poorly.  I give it 2 stars for the first half of the movie.

1094774,3,6305897786,"There seems to be an over-abundance of movies that start out good and end up disappointing at the finale. This technique of labeling movies has become mainstream nowadays, as is with films like ""The Astronaut's Wife"" and ""Hackers."" Roman Polanski's latest thriller, ""The Ninth Gate,"" is a prime example of this, and despite a talented cast and gorgeous settings, it takes too long to deliver a less-than-satisfying ending that leaves viewers with more questions than answers. This is a shame, however, because up until the end, the plot builds up an intense amount of suspense that ultimately fizzles out.
The movie opens with a man by the name of Andrew Telfer killing himself in his rather elaborate library of antique texts, and a single book is missing from the shelves. Enter Boris Balkan (Frank Langella), who purchased the missing volume from Telfer and has hired Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) to compare it to others out there in order to be assured of its authenticity. Corso is told that the book is believed to be written by Satan himself, and that there are two copies in different places in Europe. Corso sets out to find them, first stopping by the Telfer estate to question Liana Telfer (Lena Olin) about the circumstances surrounding her husband's death. This leads to attempts by Telfer to retreive the book from Corso, and he flees with the book to Portugal, and then France, in search of the other two books. When he does get his hands on them, he learns that each one is different, but that they each hold a special part of the overall key to hell.
Accompany to the plot the menacing Liana Telfer, who is constantly following him, and a mysterious woman who appears out of nowhere at random points to help out Corso. All of this makes for two hours of splendid visuals, and a sense that there is always something spooky going on, even when there should not be. Unlike ""End of Days,"" this Satanic spoof does not rely on gore and blatant special effects to tell its story. Instead, it uses the viewer's uneasiness to make them feel right at home.
However, some might suggest that the film is a bit too long to be enjoyable. I myself found it to be a bit tedious in certain places, but when you think you're about to drop off into a slumber, something will happen to keep you in the story once again. It is the ending, and what comes to pass to Corso because of his work, that will come as a shocking letdown. It will leave you with more questions than answers.
Acting talent is terrific. Depp seems perfectly cast as the sleepy Dean Corso, always on his feet without a break. Frank Langella is a good Boris Balkan, the man who becomes so insatiably obsessed with Satanic ritual. Olin gives a good performance as Telfer, who keeps Corso on his feet while she attempts to recover the book. And the guardian ""angel"" is played with mystery and sinister integrity by Emmanuelle Seigner.
Roman Polanski has done a fine job of bringing this very macabre picture of the doorway to hell to the screen, but trust me on this: you'll find yourself wanting to close it.",977270400,2,3069,4.612431444241317

First of all, the cinematography of this film is absolutely brilliant and establishes a heavy dark mood throughout fitting for an investigation of this nature. The boundaries of reality seem sketchy and blurred. Secondly, I always love the acting of Johnny Depp, and cannot say enough great things about the mysterious woman who shows up frequently throughout the film. Thirdly, Like The Blair Witch, this film does not spell everything out but rather lets you draw your own conclusions. In this film, unlike ""Eyes Wide Shut"" the technique really works well.

Director Roman Polanski is obviously aware of the usual histrionics that go into films having anything whatsoever to do with matters of the occult, and instead goes for the opposite effect. He focuses on the detective work that Depp does in finding out more information on the book, and on other copies of the book whose owners Depp visits in the course of his research. Unfortunately, little else happens for about 2 hours. Oh, hardcore bibliophiles will love it; I can't recall another film that dwelt with such focus on the subject of rare books. But considering the weight of the subject -- the book may have been co-written by SATAN -- it seems to plod along to the point of driving the viewer to distraction.
 The final 30 minutes gets a little livelier, but the film has about 4 endings piled atop one another, with a confusing, weirdly open-ended final image that doesn't explain anything.

1094864,4,6305897786,"This is without a doubt a complex and dreamlike film which refuses to make things simple for the viewer.  Johnny Depp almost sleepwalks through this film and thats precisly the way this role needed to be played, ever so slightly detached from reality and leaving you wondering how real everything really is. Roman Polanski's wife Emmanuelle is suitably ambiguous and Lena Olin seductivly evil while Frank Langella is probably at his weakest and seriously overplays some of his scenes.  It seems that a lot of people are having real trouble understanding the end of this film.  I think its probably a case of it being one of those films which doesn't necessarily  set out everything on a silver platter for you and also is deliberatly ambigous.  What I'm going to say now is my take on it so obviously its full of spoilers but I will try to hold something back so people can watch it and make up there own minds.
The ending  -SPOILER- The riddle refered to in the pages of the book is supposed to conjour up the Devil in the flesh.  The faked  picture depicts the Whore of Babylon which is traditionally depicted as a woman riding on a Seven headed beast.  Depending on which interpretation of the Whore you read it could be a person, place, country or even a religion but in this case it appears the Whore is a person and a common reading of the passages is that the Whore is the precursor to the anti-christ.  This person was introduced with references to Witches and pacts with the Devil.  The true picture shown at the end shows the whore triumphant in front of a castle (the castle) with light streaming from the castle.  A scene a couple of minutes previously showed the castle in flames (light) and given the actions in the foreground it doesn't take a genius to figure out the way the Devil has found to make himself flesh.
I may be wrong with my reading of the ending of the film but it actually made perfect sense to me the first time I watched it but to tell the truth I think its one of those films that deliberatly wants you to question just what its ending really means.  I'd recommend this film to any Polanski fans, fans of occult films like the Omen, as well as fans of films without easy endings like Se7en.  I'd definitly warn off people who prefer their endings cut and dried or full of action.",972259200,6,2313,4.450236966824645

1094869,4,6305897786,"First, sorry for the mistakes; I usually speak french.
I heard a lot  about this movie before I decided to rent it. Mostly ""It doesn't make  any sense"", ""They don't explain anything"" and ""Worst  ending ever"".
While it's true that you know very little about  what's happening and why it's happening, it's a definite plus and it got me  hooked very quickly. I really HATE movies where the main characters explain  every little detail in some cheap dialog designed to protect the viewers  from having to THINK. This movie doesn't treat you like you were dumb,  unlike most. In addition, the ending isn't grossly predictable, a flaw that  is all too common.
Ah, yes, the so-called ""worst ending ever"".  Of course to someone who's just sitting there waiting for everything to be  explained or for a big, spectacular ending with a major event where  everything blows up and the main character barely escapes death, it will be  very dissapointing. Nothing is explained. And in this case, the purpose of  the movie's ending is to ""end"" the movie. Unbelievable, huh?
Small note: the general atmosphere of the movie is very special, and I  liked it very much. A nice change from the usual.
Finally, I think that  the actors did a pretty good job. Nothing out of the ordinary, but above  average. In particular, I don't understand why people keep saying that  Emmanuelle Seigner did a terrible job. Maybe it's because she is Polanski's  wife. ""If she's the director's wife, she can't be a good actress,  right?"" Well, I think her acting is perfectly appropriate for her  character, which is, in my opinion, the most interesting in the whole  movie; the unnamed, mysterious woman whose true nature remains unknown.
I  am always reluctant to give something a 5-star review, and so I will give  this movie 4 stars. It might not be the kind of movie YOU like, but I think  it is well worth it to see it for yourself instead of listening to other  people's critics.

Pay no  attention to who directed it, who starred in it, or what genre to force it  into.

Beautiful cinematography, a true sense of paranoia and evil, and a score that in it's somewhat bizarreness created a otherworldly feel. I can't say enough that this was NOT Johnny Depp's fault, he is the most underrated actor and possibly the most talented out there and does well with his role. Likewise, the rest of the movie's actors are very talented to say the least.

  By now, you know the basic plotline, so I won't bore you with that.  This film is 95% surface.  Looks good, but what's underneath?  Production  values are good.  The photography is wonderful.  The acting is mostly very  good.  The glaring exception here is The Girl.  (I now understand how she  got this part.  She's the director's wife.  It all makes sense now.)

Half of them ""know"" that this film is a stylish,  intelligent thriller.  The other half ""know"" that this is satire.  Hmm.
  I don't pretend to know what was in Polanski's mind.  (How  refreshing.)  However, for those of you who feel cheated by the ending, I'd  like to offer an interpretation for you.  The whole thing was just a big  practical joke, perpetrated by Satan.  He set up the whole thing with the  three books that took man three centuries to bring together and decipher;  just so one arrogant billionaire would immolate himself.

Meanwhile, he is aided by a strange woman that can ""magically"" fly around and always seems to be there.

I watched it with my parents, and they actually fast-forwarded through a lot of the movie.  And guess what?  We didn't miss much, either!  This movie is NOT an action-packed thriller, it is more of a psycho-suspense thriller...not that I got any suspense out of this movie.
I thought that The Ninth Gate was a movie for the intellectual people out there because of the plot, but the intelligent people would be the ones that turn off the movie early and do something else.
To wrap it up, The Ninth Gate is a very dull and slow-paced movie that is best left alone, or if you MUST sit through it, fast-forwarded through. Believe me, you won't miss much either way.",967593600,3,1503,4.674242424242424
1094916,4,6305897786,"After reading very mixed reviews on this film I had to see what Roman had done to El Club Dumas.  Having read the book some time ago, I didn't really  see how it could be adapted into a film.  But much like James Elloy's LA  CONFIDENTIAL, it was adapted by stripping out all but one of the many  subplots and basing the whole film on it.  I loved this film and can't  praise it enough, and reading the book is not necessary to understanding  it.  Johnny Depp plays Corso, an amoral rare book dealer who is slowly  seduced by the left hand path.  You don't like him at the beginning of the  film, he is not a nice guy, but by the end, when you at least empathize  with him, he is far worse than you could have imagined.  It is a slowly  paced seductive piece of work that has to be re-screened to be appreciated.  Americans like obvious entertainment, they generally don't want to have to  work at a puzzle or an art form to get at it's meaning.  It's a shame,  because this one has a lot to offer.  If you think the plot is silly, it's  not for you.  It's done in a very European style and may be an acquired  taste.  I won't say that those who dislike it are stupid, but I have  learned over time not to rashly criticize things I simply don't fully  understand.

1095064,2,6305897786,"The story is very interesting and was good enough to lay a strong  foundation for a solid movie, but it begins to crumble by the half way  point of the movie.
The movie stars Johnny Depp, who plays Dean Corso, a  combination of Private Investigate/Appraiser for the Literary world.  He  finds people rare books, appraises collections and is a collector (for  profitable resale only) as well.  However, he has the reputation for being  the ""used car salesman"" among literary circles.
However, his  slimy ways impress Boris Balkan (played with chilling delight by Frank  Langella), a billionaire publisher who has just purchased a book called  ""The Ninth Gate"" from a Gentleman named Tefler.  Problem is the  book belonged to his wife and she wants it back, but I'll explain a little  later.
Balkan knows that there are 3 copies of the ""The Ninth  Gate"" still available and Corso is to track the other two and get them  (at any cost).  Why is this book so valuable?  Because, supposidly it was  co-authored by the Devil himself and shows the way to bring him back to the  ""real world"" through this gate.
So the adventures take him to  Spain, Portugal and France where he meets the other two owners and is  tracked by this mysterious woman, who acts as his guardian angel.  However,  Ms. Tefler with her henchman is also trying to snatch the book at every  opportunity.
This was a very good premise in the hands of a very good  director (Roman Polanski of Chinatown fame), so what happened?
1. The  story becomes boring and generic at the half way point.  Nothing  spectacular or sinister ever really happens.
2. The contents of the book  are never explored.  Of all those pages of text, the pictures are the only  things of any value?
3. Johnny Depp was fairly wooden as the lead, and  Emmaunelle Seigner (who plays the Guardian) is too stoic for her role  description.
4. The ending is a sham.  It betrays the whole first half  and makes little sense.
5. Frank Langella, who is by far the most  sinsister character in the movie disappears and only is heard once every 20  minutes or so on the telephone.
This and the other Devil apolcaypse  movies have failed in it's story telling and delivery as well (End of Days  and Stigmata).  At least this one didn't have Gabriel Byrnes in  it...Rating: C-",966816000,2,2296,4.6375

Technically ""Gate"" was well-made, but the plot was all  surface. None of the moral questions raised about the hero were answered;  nor were any of the plot elements. The ending felt like the answer to the  question ""What's the quickest way to get this over with?""
Could  have been a good role for Depp if he'd been given a character with any  dep(p)th. By the end, he seemed to be playing for gags, which was probably  the only hope of saving his reputation.

this is a film of missed oppurtunities. several times it  appears to go in an interesting direction but twists right back to the  mundane... the conclusion is more of the same - somewhat of a buildup but  another disapointment as fails to deliver yet again..... feel free to skip  it",966297600,7,1095,4.405
1095067,4,6305897786,"only because the director, Roman Polanski, is an old-fashioned craftsman who knows how to properly build a narrative, create atmosphere, shock you  with an unexpected visual, all the while studiously avoiding cliches . . .  and all without some big stupid explosion billowing in slo-mo while some  jerk runs toward the camera manfully  (again in slo-mo).  Withholding  information from the audience, then revealing it at the unexpected moments,  layering the characters -- in short, professional storytelling in the old  murder-mystery vein -- are lost arts which one typically has to go back to  the early 1980's to find, an era before computer technology and overbearing  camerawork made such painstaking craft no longer necessary to the  attention-span-deprived American audience.  *The Ninth Gate*  is all in the  details, baby.  If such nuances don't impress you, or seem boring to you,  better look elsewhere.  *End of Days*  would be a fine start.  No nuances  there to  ""bog""  you down.
Having said all that, I must say  that this movie lacked a couple of key ingredients that would have made it  an emotionally satisfying picture.  Number one, having the Depp character  be SUCH a moral blank, especially as the film progresses, only serves to  deflate the tension -- in other words, nothing seems to be at stake.  Depp's soul is already lost; so is going to Hell any sort of change?  Also,  Polanski played his hand a bit early with the Mystery Blonde Girl.  Once  she starts floating in the air and kicking people around a la The  Incredible Hulk, it's no secret that she's a minion of Satan  (or even  Satan Himself -- it scarcely matters).  MORE mystery, not LESS, was needed  where she's concerned.  And the movie is really too long -- especially when  you consider the puzzling finish, which is really a confusing muddle . . .  unnecessarily confusing, I may add.
All in all, though, one of the more  satisfying movies of last year, especially for those who enjoy the craft of  filmmaking itself.  Those who require kickboxing matches once per half-hour  and actors floating through the soupy-looking air of CGI  ""magic"", need not apply. . . .",966211200,7,2158,4.905027932960894

THE NINTH GATE is not his best film but certainly it is much better than recent  films on the subject of 'Satan'. I'm a horror-film buff and found  'Stigmata' to be tedious and convoluted for the most part. 'End of Days'  starred Arnold and since he is one of my favorite stars I enjoyed it but it  was a big, dumb movie *not that there's anything wrong with that* but 'THE  NINTH GATE' is a thinking-man/woman's horror film.
Disturbing images  abound and great set-pieces like the various murders are well done. This  film is a real ""journey.""  It also captures a sort of  'Maltese-Falcon~ish' noir at times. The finale is interesting and makes one  want to re-watch it several times with and without the commentary on the  well-done DVD. The animated menus rock!  Also, the score is very well done.  It's one of those musical scores that you would want to purchase in  addition to the film (although there is an isolated score on the DVD!) this  movie isn't for everyone though.

I have always considered Polanski of of the best  directors around, but this movie is a big waste of the viewer's time.  Well  paced and clever camera work stand out only to be overshadowed by a  ridiculous plot. The ending aside, a BIG let down.
Depp never ceases  to amaze me as he is always quite good.  An underrated actor for sure.  Frank Langella's performance however is ridiculous,when you DO see him on  screen. A lot of his dialogue is presented ""over the phone"".  A  trick student filmmakers often use to save money.  Perhaps Polanski didn't  like him either.  He should have lit himself on fire in the opening  sequence instead, and spared us his worthless characature of a truly evil  man.
The classic ""Rosebary's Baby"" still holds up today, and  even looks good on TV late at nite despite commercials!  Buy that instead.",966211200,6,928,4.6234567901234565
1095070,2,6305897786,"Where did they go wrong?  This movie had a decent cast, a pretty good premise, and some tried and true creative personalities behind it. I was  wondering how Roman Polanski had directed the scenes in New York (as he is  permanently ruled off from revisiting these shores due to his indiscretion  with  a minor a couple decades back). Now I learn through a review that the  New York scenes were filmed in Europe (well that explains that!).
  It  is sad to see how Polanski has slipped, if this film is any indication of  his present-day creative ability. He historically has had an eye for a  script and the energy needed to pull off an idiosincratically appealing  interpretation of whatever text he has chosen to take on. This can be  verified by recalling the major films he has directed: ""Knife in the  Water,"" ""The Fearless Vampire Killers,""  ""Macbeth""(his paean to his recently deceased wife, Sharon Tate)  ""Repulsion,"" ""Chinatown,"" ""Rosemary's Baby.""  Not a bad list by any stretch of the imagination. That he should be reduced  to producing and directing such an unimaginative, trite, hackneyed (want  any more synoyms?)  piece of tripe as this is dissapointing and sad to one  of his fans (of whom I still count myself).
The plotline has been done  beyond death in recent cinema. There is absolutely nothing original or  fresh on display here. I kept searching for a quirk in character or plot  that would justify my expectations, but sadly none was forthcoming. The  only thing that truly amazed me was how much Frank Langella now resembles a  slightly younger Gore Vidal. He seems to have somehow morphed quite  successfully actually (due to some Satanic pact? Maybe Gore actually sold  his soul to replace the younger Langella?). Emmanuel Sanger (Polanski's  current wife) is an example of cinematic nepotism run rampant. She has got  to be the most wooden, untalented actresses since Marion Davies, and was  cast by Polanski for the same reasons as Hearst insisted on. Her most  intense scenes involve the camera focusing in on her cosmetically altered  eyes engaged in some sort of demonic stare, which ends up looking  incredibly risible, more appropriate to Comedy Central than spine-tingling  horror. The stare serves as a fairly appropriate meatphor for the film as a  whole. There is not a moment of apprehension, much less true horror, about  it. Nothing spooky, nothing chilling, nothing weird... just banal images of  repetetive and unbelievable figments of a poor screenwriter's paltry  imagination.
 I hope that this film doesn't signal the true eclipse of a  creative and dynamic filmmaker. Other important directors had their share  of clunkers. I hope this is just another example of a bump in the road to  an otherwise significant career.",966124800,8,2765,4.997797356828194

Johnny Depp and Frank Langella both  put in excellent acting jobs.  Unfortunately, they weren't enough to save  this film.  Slow pacing and an unrealized potential dragged this movie into  the category of ""Why did I just waste 2 and a half hours watching  this?""  I was expecting demonic conjurings and encounters with  supernatural beings, but those never happened.  The major problem I had  with it was the fact that none of the mysteries were ever explained,  especially the mysterious woman following Depp's character around and  saving his life.

1095072,2,6305897786,"To start, I will confess I was very disappointed with this movie.  I somehow was lead to believe that I was going to see a thriller with a lot  of suspense and a touch of horror.  On the other hand, what I got was a  mystery novel, a very slow moving mystery novel.  It actually took over two  hours to tell a very simple story (which I have reduced to one  paragraph).
Three copies exist of the demonic book called ""The Ninth  Gate"".  Balkan has acquired one and believes that his may not be  authentic.  He hires Corso (Johnny Depp), some type of book mercenary, to  determine which of the three copies is authentic.  Corso travels to Europe,  views the other two copies, and determines that the three are authentic but  not identical.  All three books have nine similar drawings, but only three  specific drawings of each book are to be used to assemble the nine needed  perform a mysterious incantation.  Corso figures out how to identify the  correct nine drawings.  With this information, Balkan attempts to recite  the incantation, which does not work.  Corso's mysterious follower, who may  be the Devil herself, tells him that Balkan failed because one of the  drawings he had was a forgery.  She then tells Corso where to find the  remaining drawing.  At the end, we see Corso headed to the ruins referenced  in the book, presumably to recite the incantation.  It is assumed the  incantation will give him unlimited power.
As simple as this plot is,  this lengthy movie leaves a number of unanswered questions such as: What  exactly is Corso going to do at the end? Who is the woman who mysteriously  followed him throughout the movie?  Why did he not recognize her  immediately (she looked exactly like the drawing in the book)?  Why did she  choose him to have the correct nine drawings?  What exactly is the mystery  of the ninth gate?
Perhaps the director assumed most of us had read the  book upon which the movie is based and knew the answers to these questions.  I also believe the director couldn't decide what kind of story he was  telling (mystery, drama, suspense...)  and couldn't develop his characters.  At the end, the protagonist is not any better for what has happened or any  worse; instead, he seems unchanged (and as one-dimensional as he was at the  start).
Though his character learned nothing during the move, Johnny Depp  sure did an excellent job as Dean Corso.  The rest of the cast is also  competent in this otherwise dull movie.",965520000,6,2467,4.662763466042154

The attraction to this book, is that it is  proported to be co-authored by the devil himself and the possessor, would  if properly used gain supernatural (or in this case subnatural?)  powers.
The premise was wonderfully set up.  On top of that, the book  that Johnny Depp is entrusted with was apparently obtained in such a  fashion that the owner would kill to get it back.  Unfortunately, Johnny  Depp's character finds this out only at the death of his partner.  His  partner's death amazing resembles a tile in the book.
The promise of  this story, is never met, even though, it has many twisted insights: the  mysterious girl on the train, the tiles matching the various deaths that  follow, etc.  But, they are presented in a matter of fact way that there  is no build up of suspense or tension in any fashion.  At one point in  time when Lena Olin's character steals the book from Johnny Depp, Frank  Langella kills her to get it back.  There seems to be no sense or horror  to the killings.  Nor any retribution considered.  One small thing is the  European scenery is beautiful.
The main finding Johnny Depp's character  adds is that the books, are all partial fakes.  Each one has non-Lucifer  signed tiles and only by taking the real tiles from each of the books, is a  full set possible.  Of course this happens.  But, not completely.  Frank  Langella's character thinks he has and by taking them to a site (a really  neat abandoned castle in Europe, that's significance is never revealed)  ends up self immolating in a show of omnipotence.
Johnny Depp escapes  and his ""floating"" mystery girl tells him what went wrong and  nudges him to find the key to gain this power himself.  You end on the note  of Johnny Depp reentering the castle where Frank Langella toasted  himself.
This movie had so much potential that was wasted, the insight  that all 3 books needed to make up the sum of the single set of real tiles,  the mysterious deaths of the previous owners, etc.  However, there was no  sense of depth from the characters.
Johnny Depp's character was so  matter of fact about the deaths happening around him, you would think he  was a hard bitten Army captain rather than an antique book dealer.  His  entire sense of strain was portrayed in alcohol bottles and cigarettes.  Frank Langella's role, as usual was over the top power hungry maniac  wearing a bad set of glasses.
Lena Olin's character was a little more  involved, but not much more so, with her playing a not so grieving gold  digging widow, who's dead husband's last living act was to part with a book  that she cherished.
The floating mystery girl, according to other  reviewers was Roman Polanski's wife.  Gee, I wonder if her eyes really  change color like that, and what did that mean anyway?  Shades of Pia  Zadora?",964915200,,3501,4.6430921052631575

Every character has hidden agendas and mystery. However for all the movies  greatness it fails at the end.

1095269,5,6305897786,"Wow, it's great to finally see some positive reviews. I was afraid that my Johnny Depp fans and compatriots were the only people that really adored this movie.
I saw a preview for The Ninth Gate way back in July '98 and I  was entranced then. I saw it the day it opened and the week after as well.  I was shocked to see how many people were confused, disappointed, or both.  I understood it just fine and I was completely enthralled with Roman  Polanski's excellent use of cinematography, landscape, fine acting talent,  and a great screenplay. This movie, combined with Sleepy Hollow really have  turned me onto Johnny Depp's amazing talent.
It's still rather surprising  to me that, as a fairly staunch non-denominational Christian at a fairly  young age, I am so entertained by a movie about conjuring up Satan and  laden with a bit of sexual content and a tad of swearing but I just can't  help it. The mood is just so appealing. I reccomend renting this movie just  for the chilling introduction and opening credits. Combined with Wojciech  Kilar's goosebump-conjuring score, Johnny Depp and Frank Langella's amazing  performances, and Polanski at his best, it all turns out to be a  fascinatingly frightening.
""I think within the first three minutes  of a Polanski film, you feel some kind of uneasiness, a sense of  instability in the center of your body. He's the king of that...I like  [Dean Corso] because in the beginning when you really dislike him, he's  bad. But when you grow to like him at the end, he's in fact worse.""  --Johnny Depp in Wicked magazine, Spring 2000",964656000,9,1582,4.728937728937729
1095380,2,6305897786,"Roman Polanski's film noir-ish The Ninth Gate (in which rarebook dealer Dean Corso (Depp) is enlisted by collector Boris Balkan(Langella) to search for The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of the Shadows, a book rumored to have been co-written by satan himself), starts off pretty well, but fades fast.  What begins as an interesting, engaging quest through bibliophilia and satanism (with Lena Olin along for the ride as a partially clothed wicked witch) ends in something nearing farce, something that made me laugh, and something that might testify to Roman Polanski's weakening powers.
 Depp's character is a kind of book detective/con-man, and Depp, as usual, gives his all. We first see him bilking a pair of rich folks out of a first edition Don Quixote for four thousand dollars, and most of the first act is dedicated to coloring his character as a sort of mercenary for hire. This characterization of him as a man without morals is very important, as his quest for The Nine Gates (and I'm not giving anything away if you know Polanski) will lead him to both its author, Lucifer, and some very important deliberations about his soul. The book The Nine Gates, if read by the right person, in the right way, can conjure up the devil and send the conjurer to the devil's side. Langella's character, all greed, cash, and ambition, wants to be this man. So do some others. By the end, once he's learned what he can gain, so does Dean Corso.
 But everything goes to hell, so to speak, fairly quickly, and the plot meanders and stalls. I kept hoping someone, anyone, would step in and send the movie somewhere, turn it up a notch, or even change directions. But no one does. Polanski can't keep away from his same old semi- fantastical and autobiographical mistakes. Sex with mystical beings occurs twice. The mystical beings are, no surprise, females. Rarely, here, does a woman get to be a woman. Two of the three main female characters in the movie are witchy (or something worse) and Depp has peremptory sex with both of them, one time (with the Olin character) for blackmail purposes and one time (with Emmanuelle Seigner`s character The Girl) for much higher stakes. The Baroness, played by Barbara Jefford, is the only main female character with any lines to speak of, and with any human characteristics at all. It is no mistake that she's confined to a wheelchair and eventually murdered (by unseen forces) in a horribly goofy way that, at least for me, turned a run of the mill supernatural horror movie into farce and signaled the end of my serious viewing.
 Does an inherent sexism make for a bad movie? No. Not in my opionion. What makes The Ninth Gate bad is the seeemingly exhausted imagination behind it. If The Ninth Gate is better than Arnold Schwarzennegger's End of Days, another flick about holding hands with the devil, it is because of two reasons: 1. The Ninth Gate is a big, supernatural thriller unconcerned with traditional views of right and wrong. Hell is pictured, by the end, as a desirable goal, and it becomes clear that the devil isn't very interested in the rich and ambitious: he (or she) would rather take a regular Joe (or Johnny) any day. This lack of a traditional moral compass gives The Ninth Gate a freedom to revel in the noir-dom that it does, and allows the key main character to exist. 2. Depp does do an amazing job as Dean Corso, especially if you consider how difficult his job: he needs to be at once our everyman, the desired demon vessel, the pair of eyes we see the story and react through; and, therefore, we have to identify with him, even though Corso (and this is the second part of the job) rarely seems likable, seems in fact (toward the end at least) to be something worse than that--self-involved, vacant, and a lot like us. But Johnny Depp does seem likable, and is therefore able to allow us entry to a story about moral bankruptcy and spiritual deceit. If for no other reason, see this movie for another fine character performance from one of our best clutch actors...",964483200,10,4027,4.675599435825106
1095381,5,6305897786,This is a good movie.  I saw it in the theater for its sense of place and ominous feeling.  The video is worth seeing too.  And Frank Langella really knows how to chew the scenery.  Love the midnight mass scene where yells  'Boo!'  Hilarious.,964483200,,242,4.386363636363637

1095383,3,6305897786,"The good: The movie is more creepy and atmospheric than it is horrifying, but that's not so bad.  The acting is good, Depp made a good sleazeball, toeing the line between respectability and going over the deep end.  The  most over the wall character acting is the actor playing Balkan, the man  who hires Depp, but as I found his cornballing funny, I didn't really mind  that he over played his part.
The movie moves at a fairly decent pace,  though it does tend to drag a little now and then.  The unveiling of the  plot is handled well, giving you a little bigger piece here and there as  Depp begins to put together the information he is acquiring, and the way he  spots the differences in the books, and begins deciphering the clues.
The  bad: Unfortunately, for all that we are told, there is still much we are  not told.  Though pieces of the plot are given to us, much is still  withheld, with holes big enough to drive a car through in the plot.  The  ending itself, without giving anything anyway, which isn't hard not to  since we ourselves are not told what's happening at the end, leaves us  hanging.  I don't know about anyone else, but when I plunk down good money  on a movie, I like to be told what's happening, not given just a vague  possibility about what might or might not have happened.  Even a bad ending  is better than a vague ending.
Problems with the plot notwithstanding,  I'd say this movie is at least worth a rental, so you can see whether or  not it's worth it to you to buy.",964396800,3,1507,4.33453237410072
1095384,2,6305897786,"This film started out as a very interesting and complex thriller.  The first 3/4 of this movie are very well acted, exciting, and extremely interesting.  The first 3/4 of this film will hook the viewer into an  intelligent thriller.
I also enjoyed seeing the great locations much of  the film takes place in in Portugal and France.
However, for all the  films great acting and intelligence so clearly seen for most of the movie,  it takes a turn for the worse.  And I mean really bad.  What makes me so  mad about this film is how curious the story made me about this book and  yet the final 15-20 minutes are nothing short of a cheesy horror movie cop  out.  To be honest the ending stinks.
Again what is so horrible about  this film is that for over an hour and a half this film is very good.  It  is a great film that piques your interest.  I could not wait to find out  what this book was and why it was so important.  And what does the film do  with this intelligent plot and our interest?  The film breaks down into a  poorly acted and stupid ending.
The film looks good.  The DVD package is  good.  The extra stuff is pretty cool.  But the bottom line is that a  potentially great story is taken out from under us and we are left with a  very cheesy and not much better than a Friday the 13th Part whatever type  ending.

1095389,3,6305897786,"Johhny Depp, who has always been known for choosing strange & challenging roles, did something strange in 1999,2000. Over the course of a 12 month period, he starred in 3 films. Usually just the opposite is true.  The Astronauts Wife was totally forgettable, while Sleepy Hollow was  wonderful. The Ninth Gate falls somewhere in the middle. Trying to get back  his glory days of Rosemary's Baby, director Roman Polanski chose another  interesting, supernatural vehicle. I just felt that it lacked a lot of  things that kept it from being as brillant. One of these things,  regretably, was Depp's performance. Only a bit more animated than his  performance in the Astronaut's Wife, Depp sometimes seemed to be sleeping  through this role. He was much more effective in another of his ""every  guy"" role in the movie Nick of Time. Though the truth is,with this  film, he didn't have a heck of a lot more to work with. Polanski couldn't  seem to make up his mind whether the characters in this movie were supposed  to be cartoony or dramatic. He got an odd mix of the 2. Just listen to  lines like Depp's after he and the dead book owners wife have just finished  mking love ( i can't repeat them here)...but he delivers the line smirking  into the camera like something out of a campy spy movie. There's also the  annoying bit of Polanski not introducing the when & where of any of his  scenes. Depp goes from NY to Portugal to Spain, and Polanski leaves the  viewer wondering just where the character is now, and sometimes how he got  there. Sometimes it feels like the viewer came in in the middle of the  picture, when they have been watching it from the start. However, the film  does hold the viewer's attention ( unlike the somewhat similar, apocolyptic  snoozer End of Days), despite its almost 2 & 1/2 hour length. And some  of the performances are genuinely eerie, like that of Frank Langellas (  just listen to that voice on the phone!).But going for the anti-climactic,  artistic ending was a wrong move. It left me, oddly enough,feeling like I  was taken ( much like Corso's clientele in the movie). The picture was shot  nicely enough & had some terrific music ( that included a bit that  almost sounded like the Jaws theme). I think that Polanski could have given  in and given the viewers a little bit more of a spectacular, Hollywood  ending ( and beleive me, I don't say that often!).",964137600,2,2398,4.6270783847981
1095430,4,6305897786,"Pardon the review title, but I think it aptly sums up the film.  The plot is predictable up until the ending, which is quite startling (and disturbing), but this is not a negative.  It is largely a mood piece, built  around the connotations of occultism, drawing on our own relgious  prejudices to frighten us and to get us thinking about their lack of  complexity (it doesn't, apparently, frighten us, but for the most  fundamentally devout who take these matters seriously).  Aside from  Polanski's sometimes uncomforable portrayl of women (always the Eve in his  films), what is genuis here is Polanski's use of the  ""sex-and-satanism"" theme without risking b-movie takiness. One  should take a glance at the other reviews for a plot summary; here I will  only say that one should not put all her eggs in the plot basket.  See the  film as a nice, eerie, sometimes funny, mood-making event, and you will  enjoy the visual puzzles. I'll also add somewhat of  a spoiler (READ NO FURTHER UNTIL YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM) . . . if you read Depp's characer as a fallen demon who is being called ""home,"" his motivation (and the movie) falls into place.

I should also mention, however, the the DVD version  misrepresents the special features.  Many of the items listed as  ""extras"" DO NOT appear on the special features menu (e.g., no  cast and crew bios, no production notes), but only on the paper menu in the  case.

1095432,4,6305897786,"Empty your mind of all preconceived ideas about this film before viewing, and it will be a very worthwhile experience.  It is not a horror film.  It is definitely an occult film that takes a fresh look at the old theme of  His Unholiness making an appearance on earth.  The Ninth Gate has a  superior cast who perform their parts well under the direction of a  director with a worldwide reputation for genius, especially when it comes  to depicting the darker matters of the mind.  The film is what you would  expect from such a combination of human talent.  The strictly human  characters display themselves in such a way that it becomes possible to  read their minds and feel their motives.  In so doing, the necessity  of  the one supernatural character becomes abundantly clear.
Johnny Depp  plays Curso, a dealer in and locator of rare books who, as Balkan  (Langella's character) points out, is worthy of trust because his loyalty  can be bought.  Balkan pays the right price to have Depp travel from New  York to Lisbon and Paris in search of the two other copies of a rare book  Balkan has recently acquired--one that was supposedly co-authored by the  Devil and one of his most loyal disciples, the latter of whom was burned at  the stake in the 1600's for his own loyalty.  Balkan insists that he thinks  only one copy of the book is genuine, and he wants to make sure his copy is  the one.
It is obvious that Depp has no idea what he is getting himself  into, but for all his cynical disregard of humanity, he becomes the  ""innocent"" in this story, because he is the one person who  becomes aware and admits early on that he has no idea what he has gotten  into.  Balkan says he obtained his copy of the book in a true sale from the  owner just before the owner committed suicide.  However, the former owner's  widow insists that the book is hers and becomes the first person trying to  kill Curso in an effort to get it back--after the best of feminine wiles  don't get the job done.  At this point Curso's ""guardian angel"",  whom he calls Green Eyes, enters the picture in the guise of a wandering  college student whose appearances at first inspire distrust and  apprehension until she begins the rather pleasant habit of repeatedly  saving Curso's life.
The mysterious ""keys"" that will open the  Ninth Gate and let the Devil break through are contained in the set of nine  woodcuts within each book.  The woodcuts each contain interesting jumbled  adaptations of various images from the Tarot's Major Arcana--combinations  that give a clue to anyone familiar with the cards and their meanings that  everyone's traditional ideas regarding the occult were either dead wrong  all along or they are about to undergo--forgive the expression--one hell of  a change. Curso notes that there are significant variations in the woodcuts  in each volume of the three existing copies of the book.  Apparaently some  were drawn by the Devil himself and some by his advocate.
Curso also  notes that he is now being hounded not only by the avaricious widow and her  hit man, but also by Balkan, who seems to know his every move, not to  mention having knowledge about the  violent deaths of the owners of the  other two manuscripts.  Finally it is revealed that Balkan and the widow  are involved in a literal battle to the death to become the Master who  controls the Ninth Gate and the group of Devil worshippers who are this  century's congregation of those who have been waiting for that Master since  the book was first printed 350 years earlier.
There is humor throughout  this film, providing necessary comic relief at some very tense moments.  That humor is nowhere more evident than in the scene in which the widow  (who has managed to temporarily regain Balkan's copy of the book) is  leading the gathering of pathetic self-styled Satanists in an even more  pathetic, sterotypical black mass.  The scene at its opening is so mundane,  you want to groan.  Then as it progresses, you realize that is part of the  director's intentional imagery to show how stupid the theories about  conjuring up and dealing with Old Scratch have always been.
This guy is  supposed to be the all powerful Prince of Darkness, right?  This is the guy  who can take your soul into hell for all eternity if you agree to the  arrangement.  And yet throughout history it is believed that if you draw a  circle around a pentagram on the ground or floor and stand in it, then  mutter a few incantations, the Devil will appear with his forked tail  between his legs and do whatever you ask.  This is the powerful adversary  of the Almighty?  Polanski has a very refreshing spin on that idea.
In  The Ninth Gate we see Satan as a stronger contender--one perfectly capable  of appointing his ""chosen one"" among men.  Tired, evidently, of  insulting requests to preside as Master of Ceremonies at orgies and to give  individual megalomaniacs the power to rule the world, the Devil has decided  to run the show himself and to confer the honors of being his Commander in  Chief on a person who has proven himself a champion on the battlefield of  mundane evil.
As for that ""obscure"" ending, we see Curso  walking alone toward the last eerie combination of Tarot symbols--The Star  (hope) imposed over the twin towers of The Moon (a card generally having to  do with the deepest and sometimes most sinister elements of the occult).  One tower is behind the other, giving the appearance of the two merging  into one Tower (symbol of total destruction).  Evidently the party games  are over.

1095434,4,6305897786,"Roman Polanski is a bit of a bizarre filmmaker who tends to make rather macabre and gloomy films.  His ""The Tenant"" and ""Repulsion"" illustrate this trait rather bluntly.  And so it is  with his latest offering, ""The Ninth Gate,"" as well.  The film  looks like a Roman Polanski film right from the very start, with its muted  hues, supernatural themes, and depressing atmosphere.  For some reason, all  of Polanski's films are quite depressing. Oh well.
Anyhow, the film  concerns an egocentric book mercenary (for lack of a better term), played  by Johnny Depp, who is hired by an avid and mysterious book collector  (Frank Langella) to authenticate his copy of a very rare and potentially  very powerful book.  The investigation takes Depp's detective all  throughout Europe, and we meet some quite eccentric characters along the  way who fit in perfectly with Polanski's style.  My personal favorites are  an amusing pair of twin book-keepers who shed some light on the book.  There is also a mysterious woman who seems to follow Depp's every steps.  What is her agenda?  Did Langella hire her to keep an eye on Depp?  What is  her interest in the book?  I won't tell - watch the film and find  out.
""The Ninth Gate"" is rather deliberately paced.  Some TV  ads had depicted it to be a fast-paced, explosion packed, sexual romp.  This is the exact opposite of what the film really is.  The film really  takes its time developing mood and supernatural tone, and for the most  part, it succeeds.  If you're patient and allow the film to establish  itself, then you'll probably enjoy this film.  Unfortunately, most viewers,  jaded by MTV or Hollywood-style quick-editing, may find this movie too  boring and tedious.  That is a pity. Polanski belongs to an old school of  filmmaking, like the late Stanley Kubrick, wherein the craft of the  filmmaking process itself is more important than the number of blockbusting  special effects one can pack in.
I found this film to be quite intriguing  and gripping.  It falters a little at the conclusion by becoming perhaps a  little too over-the-top, but overall it is a fine work by a master  filmmaker.
As for the newly-released DVD, I have a few comments.  The  picture and sound are quite good, though not reference quality.  There is a  slight graininess to the picture, but that is deliberate and was also  evident on the actual theatrical release (just as in Kubrick's Eyes Wide  Shut, too).  The subwoofers stay quiet for the most part, but then this is  not a loud film (until the ending, anyways).  Polanski contributes a  commentary track, but I find him a little dry and difficult to understand;  I could have used subtitles with him, perhaps.  Unfortunately, there are  *no* subtitles on this DVD.  The disc contains the usual cast/production  notes info and a variety of trailer/teasers, a few of which are Easter Eggs  but nothing special.  There is a nice isolated soundtrack for the score,  though, which is rather eloquent and sets the proper mood for the film.  And there is a small storyboard section and a gallery of artwork from the  film, too.  Overall, it is a well produced DVD, though I would have liked a  few more extras on the DVD.  Still if you liked the film, you'll be happy  enough with this DVD.",963878400,10,3271,4.764388489208633
1095435,2,6305897786,"Based on the previews for this movie I was fairly eager to see this movie in the theater.  I would like to tell you that this movie is definitely not for everyone.  It is not a horror movie.  It is not really suspenseful.  It  is not at all what I was hoping for.  Depp's character was interesting and  played well but I never really felt any connection with him.  I personally  did not like the movie and could not wait for it to be over.  Not only was  the story fairly cliche'd and weak but the ending gave no real sense of a  conclusion and left me wondering why what just happened actually happened.  People into odd, artsy movies that aren't based on good writing or  production will probably like it.",963878400,2,707,4.297709923664122
1095436,2,6305897786,"Roman Polanski's latest outing as director of the macabre is both amusing and disturbing, though never impressive. 'The Ninth Gate' was expected to be the director's comeback bid after the brilliant 'Death and the Maiden',  and the top-notch star cast (save for Polanski's incredibly untalented  wife) promised much. But what remains at the end of it is a confused,  directionless film with no soul.
Johny Depp, who has been seen in better  films such as 'Ed Wood', plays a heartless book dealer, who specializes in  locating and trading valuable and rare books. The role seems interesting  enough at the start of the film, and Depp's emotionless performance is  intriguing, but after a while it just gets to be plain boring. He is hired  by a mysterious satan-obsessed collector who wants him to trace two books  that are supposedly written by Satan himself . If this isn't unbelievable  enough, it gets even worse when Depp jumps at the idea (he does it for the  money, people) and takes off for exotic foreign shores such as Lisbon and  the French Riviera in search of the elusive works of the Devil. He also  seems to have a Guardian Angel of sorts - a blonde puffy woman who follows  him around everywhere. This role is played by Emanuelle Seigner, Polanski's  real life wife, and its difficult to imagine a role more nonsensical. Its  bad enough that Seigner is a depressingly poor actress, but to watch her  drift in and out of the frames with no particular purpose, is quite enough.  She fared far better in 'Bitter Moon' where she was cast aside Hugh Grant  and Kristin Scott Thomas. She held her own in that film, but falters hugely  in this one.
Depp's mission is this : armed with one of the books written  by the Devil, he is to trace the other two and compare the contents, to  decide which of the three is the original. This task seems hard to  accomplish, as there are far too many people dying and too many weird  incidents going on for Depp to feel comfortable. He is also followed around  by Seigner and a dark-skinned motorbike-rider who seems to want him dead.  Depp is repeatedly saved by Seigner, who reveals herself as non-human in  one scene where she flies down the staircase rather than walk it (rather  useful, don't you think?). The duo finally discover the secret behind this  whole sorry tale, and the viewer is left wishing that they hadn't. This is  not much of a story to begin with, but as the tale draws to a close, you  begin to wonder if this really is a Polanski production. Everything is  dismal, the lighting is bad, and the performances are third rate. Depp  almost sleepwalks through the entire movie, even during the sex scenes  (pity that they're as short as they are). Seigner, who has grown as an  actress (and I mean this strictly in the physical sense of the term - she  seems to have packed on at least 20 pounds since her last film) is  eminently forgettable in her role as Angel, despite the secrets that are  revealed about her toward the end of the movie (though you probably guessed  it all along). The only time she looks remotely inspired is while shes  riding Depp as they have sex outdoors. Its also the time Depp expresses any  emotion, but its far too late for any of us to begin caring.
One wonders  what the message of 'The Ninth Gate' is, and what the purpose behind making  such a film is. The problem with this film is that it starts off looking  terribly good - the opening sequences are very interesting - but half way  down the line, you realize that it lacks any kind of direction. And despite  Depp's dark, brooding role as a man with no conscience, his potrayal of the  character is so ill-acted that its a shame. He could have done better, and  one would say the same of Polanski.
Ultimately, the problem with 'The  Ninth Gate ' is that it doesn't know what its about. If you want to know  how a film shouldn't be made, then, by all means, rent this title (but for  heaven's sake, don't buy it!). Personally, I haven't seen a film this  confusing and disappointing, in years. Heres hoping that Polanski's next is  something more upbeat, and something far more sensible.",963532800,6,4142,4.557065217391305
1095437,1,6305897786,"I thought a Roman Polanski movie starring Johnny Depp would be great, but I couldn't have been more wrong.  Depp is a rare-book expert who is sent on a trip to Europe to find a (you guessed it) rare book.  The first 90 min or  so are interesting and creepy but the movie completely falls apart in the  last half hour.  The actress whose character follows and protects Depp  gives a terrible performance.  Another problem with this film is that all  the characters in the film see Hell as a place everyone wants to go to!",961804800,4,520,4.34375
