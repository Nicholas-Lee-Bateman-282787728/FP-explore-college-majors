5801263,2,B00DHF8YSK,I was hoping this movie would be better than it looked in the trailer but unfortunately it wasn't. The cast listed on the poster are not the main characters and the acting was subpar. I am probably one of the few people who actually like straight to dvd movies because I have found some great movies but this one was a waste of my time. The story was not put together that well and it was confused about what was going on in the beginning. This could have definitely been edited better for the story to make more sense. Several parts were irrelevant and I just was not impressed with this at all.,1379289600,6,596,4.283185840707965

8593192,1,B00DHF8YSK,"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE! The only reason I watched this garbage is because it was filmed in my hometown. The main actor Ameer Baraka should stick to modeling because he can't act to save his own life. Seems like EVERY scene had theme music. The legit actors in the movie ie. Jason Weaver, Drew Sidora, Jazmine Lewis really should fire their agents for booking such a horrendous script, storyline, plot (or lack thereof). This shit is rediculously rediculous! It's only February but I KNOW this will be the WORST movie I'll see in 2015. People please don't waste your life on this movie.",1424304000,,589,4.784313725490196
8593193,2,B00DHF8YSK,Not the best scripted movie. A little on the boring side.,1413158400,,57,4.2727272727272725

8593195,3,B00DHF8YSK,This movie you might want to watch a few times it can lose you until you get to put the pieces together.,1399852800,,104,3.772727272727273
8593196,1,B00DHF8YSK,"there was damage to the video, It wouldn't let me watch it.  There was something wrong with the digital video.",1399248000,,110,4.5
8593197,3,B00DHF8YSK,because it should have been stronger about jason weaver and then when her and the other guy finally did get together itwas overno time spent on their relationship.,1384819200,,163,4.857142857142857
8593198,1,B00DHF8YSK,"I can't speak on the plot because I couldn't finish this movie. I turned it off before Jazmin Lewis and Jason Weaver appeared on screen. Actors I actually think are talented. The movies start off when multiple flashbacks that aren't initially piece together.. they just seem random. After awhile you get the feeling that some bad intentions are going on and two of the characters randomly see each other in a mall in New Orleans. While they both appear to be on trips. How does that even happen?! New Orleans must be their second home.. They actually magically run into each other twice. However, the music editing job me the most. The same Jazz track plays throughout the movie and even when the characters are exchanging dialogue. Why would an soundtrack play while characters are supposed to be saying important things that you want the viewer to focus in to. I also had to rewind one of the scenes in the mall. It was ridiculous because the mood suddenly went from 60-0 for no apparent reason. Burn.",1382745600,2,1003,4.672316384180791
8593199,1,B00DHF8YSK,"This movie was soooooo stupid! I was hoping that there would at least be a good ending that gave light to the consequences of making bad moral decisions, but nope. This movie is stupid, and whoever wrote it is an idiot. To make viewers think that you can cheat on your husband or wife and still have a happy ending is so stupid. Where are you morals? Where are your values? So stupid.",1380585600,5,384,4.273972602739726
