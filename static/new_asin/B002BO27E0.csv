3895184,1,B002BO27E0,"This was about the worst DVD I have ever gotten from Amazon.com.  Has to be a copy, of a copy, of a copy etc.  Grainy, blurry just awful turned it off after 10 minutes",1277164800,,167,3.8823529411764706
3895185,1,B002BO27E0,"This Diana Ross DVD: ""Live From Las Vegas"" was misleading.  The concert was one of Diana's performances back in the late 1970's - though the front cover depicts Diana Ross as she looked in the 1990's.  Also, the picture quality of this DVD was very poor, which was a shame, being the concert seemed to be one of her best, at the height of her solo career.  I also ordered another Diana Ross DVD: ""Diana Ross In Concert"", it having a ""different"" front cover, depicting when Ms. Ross was much younger, though this DVD ended up being the exact same concert as the other one, with same poor picture quality.  Felt I got ""duped"" with these purchases, and have learned from this experience not to purchase items that aren't more explicit in their ""descriptions"" of merchandise.",1273363200,5,771,4.647058823529412
3895186,1,B002BO27E0,"I have always been a fan of Diana Ross's music but this DVD is horrible.  First of all, it's from the late 70's (the picture on the cover is obviously more recent) and the sound quality and production is awful.  I've seen Diana Ross at least 10 times in concert from her performance in Central Park in 1983 to a few years ago during the tour for her last CD release.  Ironically, one of her best live performances was during the ill-fated ""Return to Love"" Tour back in 2000.  Her voice never sounded better and, for the first time in 30 years she performed full versions of many of the Supremes greatest hits.

Diana Ross has always been a first-class performer and deserves better than this shoddy release!",1265846400,13,707,4.4921875
3895187,1,B002BO27E0,"When I saw the cover of this DVD.  I did think that It was a recent concert.  I believe that we are being ripped off because it does not say that this an extremely old concert, voice is different, everything is different, so I do hate it and I can not understand why Amazon is selling it.
Please, do not get it.  Diana is 65 years old.  She does still sings, but she ain't the same person who performs in the concert recorded in the dvd.  Besides, image is blurry, sound is awful.  DO NOT BUY IT.

3895188,1,B002BO27E0,When I saw the cover of the DVD I though that this DVD will be the last Diana's concert in Las Vegas. But when I received I felt so frustrated and robbed that the DVD was recorded in 1979. The sound is awful and it is so hard to see Diane's face.  I don't think is fair to promote a DVD using a recent face of Diane in order to sell an old recorded dvd. Please be more serious on this matter.,1259625600,21,392,3.7804878048780486
3895189,4,B002BO27E0,"this is areissue its the same concert as the one with picture of love and life great concert was telivised in the eighties rare live performances to shy to say,all for one remember me iwanna be bad great for diana fans or anyone who likes live concerts",1250899200,2,252,4.382978723404255
8361722,1,B002BO27E0,"The cover art is intentionally misleading.  It looks like a 90s or early 2000s photograph, but this is the Caesar's Palace Concert from 1979.  Don't get me wrong; it's a GREAT concert.  But if you're collecting her live performances, you may find yourself with multiple copies of the exact same performance.  Whoever approved this release is a douche.  That is all.",1453852800,,365,4.918032786885246

8361724,3,B002BO27E0,"this cover is VERY deceiving!  Is the OLD concert in vegas from ages ago, makes you think it is a new concert!!!  Not cool.",1414022400,,123,4.083333333333333
8361725,5,B002BO27E0,"I bought this item as a gift and my friend absolutely loved it, I mean it's Diana Ross, how can you not love it.  Very glad I made this choice.",1410739200,,143,3.7666666666666666
8361726,2,B002BO27E0,The video quality was very poor.  It looked like someone vcr'd a tv show and then converted it to a DVD.,1393372800,3,104,3.9523809523809526
8361727,1,B002BO27E0,"Not the best by Diana Ross the quality of picture was hazy.
I thought I was ordering a different show, she probably made
a few tapes",1370908800,,132,4.115384615384615
8361728,1,B002BO27E0,"I have this concert on VHS and the quality is so much better from a 25 year old video tape then a new dvd.  I was so excited to have
it perserved on DVD and I should have converted it myself because thats what it looks like a horrible conversion job.  HBO should release these
concerts and remaster them.",1325030400,,304,4.135593220338983
8361729,1,B002BO27E0,"I watched the first minute or so and I was really discourged, it was like someone had filmed this from a TV set or something...the quailty of the picture is very poor, don`t judge a book by it`s cover....",1317945600,3,204,4.256410256410256
8361730,1,B002BO27E0,"This was as everyone has previously stated the old concert of 1979, I saw her last year 2008 performance in NYC and thought this was the concert being purchased. It is indeed a poor quality video. we should all send amazon a letter of protest for such a poor product.",1278374400,,267,4.36
8361731,5,B002BO27E0,"This was Diana Ross on 'top of her game' in 1979, this is the reason I gave it 5 stars. However, the newly packaged cover had me fooled though because I thought it was a different concert from Las Vegas, a more recent one from  looking at the picture. I should have read the Songlist before ordering and then I would have known that I already bought this concert about a decade ago. There is also another one I purchased that has a different cover, again not of her as she looked in 1979 and it just said ""Diana Ross Live In Concert"". When it arrived along with this one, they were both the same 1979 concert. So now I own 3 copies of the same concert. Buyer beware!",1278115200,,666,4.162790697674419
