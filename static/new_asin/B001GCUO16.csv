3598697,5,B001GCUO16,"First of all I would like to point out that Victor Creed/Sabertooth stole the show for me. I just thought that his sadistic sarcastic character was gratifying in a twisted dark kind of way. But Wolverine was pretty darn cool too. I wish Gambit and Deadpool would have got a little more screen time, there stints in the movie were by far to short. The action is non stop so all us testosterone hack and slash lovers will leave this movie feeling satisfied. It even should be appealing to the ladies since Jackman prances around alot barley dressed. Overall I think this movie is absoultly fantastic. I highly recommend.",1241136000,4,618,4.678899082568807
3598698,4,B001GCUO16,"1840's Canada, two boys are together.  They are Logan (later Wolverine) and Victor Creed (later Sabretooth).  When they lose their father, they go off together to fight.  They're both mutants and virtually indestructible.

Present day and the pair has fought in almost every war since then.  Col. William Stryker recruits them for an elite strike force.  When Logan realizes Stryker's ultimate plans, he opts out and moves to the Canadian Rockies and marries schoolteacher, Kayla.

But, the fight's not over.  Sabretooth is going after the former team and Wolverine's got to step up before they're all killed.

Fandom of ""Wolverine Origins"" seems to be currently divided between two camps:  those who read the dark character in the Marvel comic books and those who have not. For the record, I have not read the comics--only seen the movies.  That being said, I enjoyed watching ""X-men Origins."" I cannot speak to the story's authenticity to its source material, but I can say the action was interesting, the scenery spectacular, and it was 2 hours well spent in the theatre.

Easter Egg Alert: Stay until the very end of the film.  There is an Easter Egg.

3598699,4,B001GCUO16,"Do you want to know how Wolverine got those shiny claws?  Do you want to know about his past?  Do you want to know why he has lost memories?  If you answered yes to all or to at least one of those questions, then ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" is something you should check out for the answer(s).

Hugh Jackman returns as Wolverine to show us, finally, where he came from.  We get a glimpse of his birth sometime in the 19th century.  We see that Wolverine is a war-weary soldier who's fought in battles ranging from the Civil War all the way up to Vietnam.  We see the beast that lies within him and what drives all his rage.

Some of what you know about the other ""X-Men"" films needs to be forgotten, particularly anything to do with Sabretooth.  In ""Origins"" the Sabretooth character is re-imagined as Wolverine's half brother, which has been subject of comic book fan speculation.

""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" is as solid as adamantium.  The re-imagining of Sabretooth worked well and created an emotional connection between protagonist and antagonist.  Jackman was solid again as Wolverine.  But, he seems overshadowed by Liev Schreiber as Sabretooth who gave a much more dark, menacing performance.  Overall, the film is well made and thoroughly exciting.

Comic book fans will probably nitpick at whatever they see fit.  But, the bottom line is that ""Origins"" is much better than the dreadful ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" and seems to be clawing at the origins of something great.

Insider tip: Stay for the end of the credits, there is a hidden scene.",1241136000,5,1549,4.7631578947368425
3598700,2,B001GCUO16,"""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", written by David Benioff and directed by Gavin Hood.

The world is familiar with Wolverine as his antics have been displayed in the 3 X-men movies but now it is time to examine his origins. Not too much story to elaborate on; Witness marvels favorite mutant from the very beginning and get Hollywood's take on his relationship with Sabretooth, his first love, his war adventures all the way up to just before the first X-Men movie...

What an abortion of a great character. How did Marvel let this happen? With the success of Spiderman, and Iron Man and a great comeback with a much better Hulk Sequel, how did this movie get made? I have been a huge fan of this character for over 20 years now and I really really wanted this to be good but instead saw the most disappointing comic movie adaptation yet.

The Good: Trying to find some but have yet to be successful.

The Bad: Why did they have to make a campy Wolverine movie? Wolverine is one of the darkest Marvel characters and his movie is full of camp, how does that make sense? Why did they turn one of the hardest Marvel characters into a compassionate crying machine? How did a movie with the Marvel stamp on it come out looking so cheap? When did Gambit turn into a nice guy? Have CG effects gotten worse cause they looked pretty bad in this. Why are there so many forced attempts at iconic shots? I could go on an on.

Overall: This has to be the worst Marvel movie to date and the furthest off the mark with regards to the original source material. The movie looks bad and was written worse. My favorite character has been watered down and then had cool aid added to him. Absolutely terrible and unforgivable.",1241136000,9,1699,4.467741935483871
3598701,5,B001GCUO16,"This movie explains a lot about wolverine. It is also the best x men movie yet and it has other x men like cyclops and gambit,also sabretooth if you want to watch this movie you have to!!!!!!!!!!",1241136000,2,195,4.297297297297297
3598702,3,B001GCUO16,"Neatly tying in and building upon many of the characters in the mutant universe, X-Men Origins: Wolverine will undoubtedly satisfy fans of the franchise. Anyone else needn't apply. Plenty of action scenes find their way into the origin story, and while most are wildly spectacular with inventively insane stunts, certain superpowers lend themselves to rather staid showdowns and the occasional over-the-top confrontation that no amount of belief-suspending tactics can overcome. In its defense though, it is a comic book movie, and we finally get to see a glimpse of some twin mutant girls.

One of the most famous X-Men characters, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), receives the full origins treatment, and the latest installment in the series chronicles the harrowing events in the mutant's early years leading up to the first film. The year is 1845, and young James Howlett discovers in a cruel twist of fate the consequences of his temper and the power of his mutant abilities. Swearing to stay by his older brother Victor's (Liev Shreiber) side, James fights through several major wars and the duo wind up more than dishonorably discharged for their failure to respect authority. A way out comes to them in the form of William Stryker (Danny Huston), the leader of a shadowy elite military group carrying out dangerous missions with an army of powerful mutants. When an assignment in Africa sours, the brothers are separated and James, now adopting the name Logan, begins a tranquil new life with girlfriend Kayla (Lynn Collins) as a lumberjack in the Canadian wilderness. But his newfound happiness doesn't last long as Stryker reappears and draws him once again into a world of violence and deception, and Logan must rely on his own cunning, a skeletal upgrade, and the aid of a few new mutant heroes to survive a threat of unimaginable destructive power.

The expected staples of blockbuster superhero movies are naturally included, right down to the outlandish fight sequences, pose-striking before and after important battles, slow motion explosions and loud noises galore. Despite all the intense bells and whistles, the generic plot points also find their way into Origins. Brotherly friends find themselves fighting on opposite sides of morality wars, allies hunt down their own kind blindly for a supposed greater good, the villains must create an uncontrollable monster to defeat an even deadlier foe, and innocent victims along with true love stumble into the mess of sacrifices and revenge.

Of course the main event is the overload of action sequences sure to numb the senses. But the PG-13 rating puts a brazenly noticeable cap to the violence and bloody realism that could be witnessed when mutants duel with Adamantium claws, swords, and razor-sharp fingernails. Instead, the bloodless fights consist primarily of carefully timed charges like a bull squaring off with a matador, running, yelling and grappling. The cautious attention to avoiding truly bloodthirsty engagement limits creative violence. Even when the hand-to-hand combat looks impressive, the stunts get far-fetched, pushing the special effects to the limit.

The mutant super powers are still entertaining, even when they're not specifically defined (Gambit's abilities include a little of everything, although the comics summed it up as the manipulation of kinetic energy), and several new skills get to make a sharp introduction. But perhaps the most fascinating element, the ethical ideas behind living normal lives, concealing inhuman differences, having not asked for such ""gifts"" and choosing to exploit them, which made the original X-Men movie trilogy so thought-provoking, never quite makes it into this new Wolverine spectacle.

3598703,1,B001GCUO16,"I haven't seen the film yet but a couple things really bother me. Firstly, why does sabertooth look nothing like the marvel character or the one from the first Xmen movie? From the looks of it he is actually shorter than Hugh Jackman...? That stinks. Secondly, I know I will not get to see Deadpool as he should be. He should be in costume. It would be infinitely better. Nothing against the actor playing him, but if you are going to make a movie and use certain characters, then use those characters, otherwise call them something else. The movie producers completely miss the point that these characters have become popular as they are, and not as they want to make them. I don't care if you want to see the actor's face so they can give expressions and act. I don't need to see Ryan Reynolds. I've seen him on the movie screen. I want to see Deadpool on the movie screen. Thank goodness we'll get to see Snake-eyes in the G.I. Joe film this summer (in mask). I guess these people would have him out of costume as well..",1239494400,6,1023,4.389473684210526
3598704,1,B001GCUO16,"i have read that one of the motives why it's unfair this movie is circling the net unfinished is because people are starting to crticize it before its conclusion which in theory i would agree but after seeing this ""gem"" i think most of the hollywood movies should be seen with apparent wire work, bad transitions, weak post production. that way it is in your face the way this and other movies have no interest in doing something good. its completely marketing research and ""professionals"" that are professionals because they deliver and are there on time but by no means you could call them creative. this really really sucks. the industry is going to a scary place right now. one of the nominees this year for best cinematography was benjamin button which was done almost entirely in green screen. ""cinematography""? best actor??? that is trully wrong. this industry has failed and has been failing for years. this is just another example.",1238889600,5,940,4.84472049689441
3598705,4,B001GCUO16,"As you may or may not know, the workprint of X-Men Origins: Wolverine has
just recently leaked out onto the web. I am one of the many people who
have seen it, and me being an X-Men fan (OK, well I wasn't too big a
fan of X-Men 3: The Last Stand), I decided to check it out. Movies that
explore the origins of a specific character are usually a dime a dozen,
which is why I wasn't looking too forward to X-Men Origins: Wolverine
upon seeing the trailer, but I decided to give it a go anyways.

The result is that I was surprisingly satisfied! It's not really a
typical X-Men movie. Then again, you have to know what you are seeing
before walking into the theater: an X-Men movie. And Hugh Jackman is
excellent as usual in his performance as Wolverine, the mutant with
those metal claws that come out of his knuckles we all have come to
know and love.

This movie is the start of a series of movies that explore the origins
of characters. The storyline isn't really as confusing or ""Stupid"" as
some people have made it out to be, actually. It's not the best story
but it serves well. Whereas X2's storyline was easy to follow, this
story IS a tad confusing in some bits. As for the humor- this movie
isn't as humorless as people are complaining about, there is lots of
dry humor, And we even get a pretty funny introduction to the character
of Gambit, as well as the boxing match scene is pretty funny too. Ryan
Reynolds' performance as the talkative Deadpool is pretty funny as
well.

The action scenes are the real highlight, though. The multiple battles
between Wolverine and Sabretooth are very well done, and the
introduction to the newly-embalmed Deadpool is quite stylish too.
There's an entertaining chase scene, which ends with a nice finish.

I can't really judge the Special effects yet since the finished cut is
not released but I can tell they are going to be great. What WAS
finished was pretty impressive, in fact the opening credits played over
the war scenes were full of some great effects. There's some good plot
twists too- one towards the end that was very strong and unexpected.

Sure there are some let-downs- some of the introductions (most notably
Cyclops) were a tad rushed, the ending was a bit too quick, the
character of Gambit, while funny, was a bit confusing, the story was a
tad hard to follow in a few places. But looking past the discrepancies,
this is a pretty good film, and they may be fixed with the 15 minutes
they are going to add to the finished cut. While this isn't the best
X-Men movie, I'd say this is worthy, and the start of something great.",1238803200,6,2587,4.449367088607595

Its as if this movie was made before it was popular to take license with Marvel properties and treat them as source material.
The X-Men movies aren't Fun like MCU, PERFECTLY keeping in conjunction with the comics. They are completely separate vibes and I hope it stays that way. I don't want Disney doing X-Men, nor do we need perfect continuity. I went back and watched this after Logan (IMO Best Superhero movie of all time) and Days of Future Past (Second Best OAT) and was amazed that after watching Cap, Iron Man, Thor, how much this movie holds its own against all of them. Even (gasp) X-Men 3 wasn't as bad as I remembered (minus ridiculous serum plot). I think at the time of this movie we weren't yet ready for comics to evolve into movies instead of trying to replicate the experience of comics. I think we are only going to get the true feel of comics in tv/streaming series which imo is why Marvels Netflix series are superior to the Movies.

3598957,3,B001GCUO16,"X-Men Origins: Wolverine is probably my least favorite film in the franchise, and I'm surprised by it's warm reception on Amazon. The film is just not good when compared to the highlights of the series. Besides the over the top action set-pieces the film fails in some fundamental ways. Deadpool is in this film, and it's a terrible rendition of the character. I don't blame Ryan Reynolds for this, luckily he was given a second chance to right the wrongs made here, but it's awful. And it's been pointed out elsewhere on the internet, but the introduction should have been the whole movie. Watching Wolverine and Sabretooth fight through every American war would have been a vastly superior film, rather than the 3 minute opening credits sequence. What a waste.

I purchased this film to complete my collection and I will say some positives for the actual Blu-Ray. The copy I received did have the Slip Cover (or O-Ring) that Amazon shows on their listing. Also, the code for my HD copy doesn't expire until January 2020. I haven't looked to see what special features are on the disc, but the box lists a lot, however there's an extra spot for a second disc inside the case. I'm not sure if I'm missing a disc or not, so I'll update if the listed special features are missing. As far as the actual Blu-Ray goes I'm very satisfied, it's the movie that's slightly disappointing.",1501718400,,1377,4.666666666666667

3599038,2,B001GCUO16,"One of the most disappointing entries in the X-Men movie canon. We already got flashbacks of Wolverine's past in X-Men 2 and learned about his relationship with Williams Stryker. So this movie feels redundant. It didn't need to be made. The filmmakers should have just gone ahead and made a film about Logan's adventures in Japan. Eventually this movie was made and is now know as The Wolverine. That movie was so much better than this one. We have terrible CGI in this movie. Wolverine's adamantium claws look cartoony. We also have some major continuity discrepancies in this film Sabretooth looks completely different than he did in the original X-Men. He even has a completely different personality. And now he's Wolverine's brother (what?). Emma Frost is Kayla Silverfox's sister (again, what?) I guess she aged backwards since she's older in First Class, a movie set years before Wolverine Origins takes place. Taylor Kitsch does okay as Gambit but is underused in this film, Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson is great in this movie UNTIL Stryker experiments on him and turns him into a bastardized version of Deadpool--a weird looking creature with no mouth and laser beams shooting out of his eyes! Just skip this one and watch The Wolverine instead.",1498348800,,1253,4.9714285714285715
3599070,3,B001GCUO16,"The only decent entry in the Wolverine standalone films. It's a vast improvement over ""Wolverine Origins,"" which was awful except for Jackman, Liev Schrieber, and Ryan Reynolds. It certainly is more entertaining and fun than"" Logan,"" which wallowed too much in gory violence, profanity, and bleak nihilism (the only saving grace of that film was interaction between Jackman and Stewart). The film is sequel to ""The Last Stand"" and a prequel to ""Days of Future Past."" Logan travels to Japan and reunites with a Japanese soldier whose life he saved in World War II. The old man offers him the chance to take away Logan's healing powers to save his own life and to allow Logan to be mortal and to eventually die like everyone else. Logan is haunted by the memory of Jean Grey (Famke Jensen) and longs to be with her. But Logan turns the old man down and says he wouldn't really want what he has. Logan must protect the old man's granddaughter from the Yakuza, with some help from Yuriko. Silver Samurai and Viper are two villains intent on stealing Wolverine's healing powers for their own purposes  I enjoyed seeing this extended edition and it was great to see several strong female characters kicking butt in this movie.

3599481,4,B001GCUO16,"This movie, I saw it in theaters when it first came out, and eventually forgot about it. The other night we wanted something sci-fi action-y to watch and John Carter put me to sleep. When I woke up the wife still wanted to watch another flick, so we perused the Amazon catalog and in the current famine of decent movies started looking over older ones, we came across this and she requested it.

I'd honestly forgotten how energetic Jackman was in this movie, he does a very good job at coming across as a powerhouse. The films comic book take on Japanese culture and society is perfect, and while I wasn't totally taken with their treatment of the Silver Samurai, it worked all the same.

You do have to stow your brain in the overhead storage bin for this flight though, the biologist in me started to frizzle at some of the things they showed and how poorly they played out the science fiction aspects of the characters. That said, it was apropos for the medium and source material. Just look for a fun ride through some silly action and some overtly serious (given the material) acting from Jackman and have a good time. We did.",1488844800,,1132,4.490291262135922

3599484,4,B001GCUO16,"A very different X-Men film.  Imagine ""X-Men"" x ""James Bond"" x ""Lost in Translation"" x ""Iron Man"" and you will have an idea of this film.  X-Men movies are usually reactionary - the X's are responding to a threat.  In this case, Wolverine has to uncover several different relatively elaborate conspiracies to figure out what he's doing and his methods are rather in line with what James Bond would do, especially since he is struck with mortality this time around.  There are definitely some laughs via cultural confusion to be had here though they are quick and the ease with which his Japanese paramours shuck their discretion is also noteworthy...  The climax is pretty disappointing (what the ?) as is the resolution (unless Wolverine is James Bond) but the direction is pretty sharp overall as is the acting.  The primary downside is in the writing - there are far too many storylines going on simultaneously - with the cultural contrast and already compelling plot, why muddy it?

3599788,4,B001GCUO16,"As another X-Men spinoff film, ""The Wolverine"" is definitely an improvement over X-Men Origins: Wolverine, however it still falls short of greatness. The most positive aspect of this film is the choice of style with pacing that is slower and a narrative that is more focused making for a more thoughtful and meditative character driven piece. Most of the film does have the makings of a great movie with nuances and character moments that try to get under Logan's skin exploring his humanity in more depth but unfortunately the movie digresses and loses it's edge in the third act to a cartoonish fight and conclusion with the silver samurai. It's unfortunate given that it had some interesting themes and philosophical ideas going for it but ultimately gave way to the typical trappings of a major studio superhero movie trying to cater to the masses when it looked set for so much more.",1482710400,,888,4.848684210526316

This is one of the most popular marvel universe movie characters and we can see why.  A must see for any marvel fan (again, I'm not an aficionado on marvel comics, and so I'm not a stuck-up arm chair critics  of Stan Lee's marvel world films.) Rather I just like the films- be it  seeing old time fav comic characters on live action film/  nostalgic feelings from growing up reading/collected them as a kid?

The movie started out good which is why I give it two stars and the parts that actually focused on Logan's development are pretty much what saves this movie. The rest of it though, from the complete bastardization of the Deadpool character and the obvious ""plot twists"" just killed it for me. I think the story should have just focused on Logan, his conflicted relationship with his brother, and Col. Stryker without trying to add the extra cast of mutants and plot twists. Stick to a basic hero myth rather than trying to make it Shakespearean. After an hour I started fast forwarding through scenes because they were just boring and the dialog was terrible. Even the ending was disappointing (and we all pretty much know how it ends if you've seen any of the other Xmen movies).

Hugh Jackman explodes onto the screen, set after X-Men the last stand, Wolverine struggles to live with his actions during his confrontation with Phoenix. A closer more personal story that takes us back to one of Wolverines earlier adventures and the consequences and impact he had on an individual whose life he saved.
With amazing action sequences, a brilliant cast and stunning oriental setting, Wolverine has never felt more out of place, yet addictive than he does here. Facing off against a family fued of three generations, with his very mortality threatened, can Wolverine unravel the huge web that is the Yashida family and figure out who's really pulling the string, while fighting off Yakuza, Samurai and the deadly mutant Viper.
Definitley recommended and definitely the strongest X-men and Wolverine outing to date.",1469145600,,881,5.25531914893617

  I liked how we see Wolverine's origins, his awesome actions in all the wars before he got involved with Weapon X, and I liked the angle of how he and his half brother are arch adversaries.  One fights for goodness, while the other fights for evil.  The only major problems I had was with how they changed the actor who plays Colonel Stryker, Emma Frost's character makes no sense, Deadpool's development was kind of stupid, and Gambit's portrayal wasn't so hot either.

 Plus a major plot problem was how Logan's girlfriend's rational in the film seemed incredibly weak and nonsensical, ""My sister! They kidnapped my sister!"" Huh???

 But I did love seeing the Weapon-X scenario explained out more, I liked how he sprung into action and fought those different members of his original platoon.

 So I give this movie a solid B and thumbs mildly up, because it is sure better then some of the other X-Men films out there.",1464912000,,1165,4.606796116504855

3600796,4,B001GCUO16,"Not a bad movie, but kind of portrays Wolverine as a mindless tank that would be dead sometime during the first five minutes of the story if it weren't for his super-healing powers.  Even though Wolverine feels pain when he is shot, sliced up, or even harpooned as he is in this movie, he does little to avoid get beat/shot/torn up.  I get it - we must suspend our disbelief when we watch movies such as this one, but you would think that Wolverine would be pretty good at evading attacks, seeing how he has been in countless battles/skirmishes.  He just uses brute force, and that kind of bites him in the butt in this film.

If you like the X-Men series, this is probably a must-see for you.  If you aren't into the X-Men, you will probably enjoy the movie but won't consider it one of the best you've ever seen.",1463702400,,814,4.328947368421052

3600980,2,B001GCUO16,"I'm not going to mention how far off the comics this was.  I expect to watch movie adaptations as their own beast, and go into it with low expectations re: source material.  To be fair, Jackman did a credible job at bringing decent emotional complexity to the character, and his fight scenes are definitely badass.  The plot was a bit kitschy, but I was sort of in the mood for that, so no argument there!  What I couldn't get past was the way that location/setting errors kept interfering with my suspension of disbelief.  Right from the opening scenes, which we're told represents the ""Northwest Territories"" in the 1800s.  Err.... Ok, so that could be anywhere west of Ontario, I guess.  Still, if you're at all familiar with the history of colonization in Canada, this setting and the props/costumes were such a mess.  Four-poster beds and chandeliers prior to the Riel Rebellion (either of them)?  Ohhhhhkay.  I'm being picky.  But it was the first in a plethora of poor sets and locations -- could they not have done some location shots of the actual Canadian Rockies?  It was clear the geology was entirely wrong, as every establishing shot showed mountains that we all recognize from Frodo's sojourn to Mordor et al.  More landscape issues inherent in the botany -- good on them for finding a pine plantation to chop away at, but it was pretty obvious from the herbaceous understory that this wasn't anywhere in North America.  Seriously, guys.  Some of us are botanists -- we notice this stuff, and it just wrecks it.  Well, for me, anyway, b/c I spent the next 15-20 minutes of the film trying to ID the plants, instead of just enjoying.  Ah well.  Better luck to your location scouts next time.  Maybe try...

Nothing amazing, nothing horrible. Worth watching once or twice.

With how epic the x-men films are, it was a surprise this wasn't a more interesting movie, but it can get much worse. Go see the hulk movies if you don't believe me.

Apparently adamantium to bone infusion only works if you hate someone enough. Huh, you learn something everyday.",1453593600,,356,4.819672131147541
3601615,2,B001GCUO16,"What is Wolverine doing in Japan?

Japanese cartels? Ninjas? Bamboo Dojo's? In a marvel movie?

A machine that can somehow steal wolverines healing power by digging into his bones? erm.... Suuuure....
So drill into his arm bones, suck out some blood from it, somehow this gets ALL of the power in wolverine out, put this blood in you and boom! You have his powers... I.... I mean... Is this cannon?... is this what they seriously wanted? Why couldn't you just take a little bit of his blood and share? It had to be all?
The comics do stupid things all the time so I guess I shouldn't be so surprised about the fail at science.

Ok looking past that, the movie is still not that good. Worth watching maybe once, just so you get lateral head exercise as you shake your head in disappointment.",1453593600,,790,4.472222222222222

3601732,3,B001GCUO16,"The Wolverine is an episode in the X-Men franchise, presumably crafted to appeal to Asian audiences. Logan (Hugh Jackman), AKA Wolverine, is the center of an adventure in Japan, where he was interred in a POW camp during World War II. He saved the life of a young Japanese soldier named Ichiro Yashida (Ken Yamamura) , just as Nagasaki was bombed. Now Logan lives in a tent in the Yukon, drowning his sorrows since the death of his lover Dr. Jane Grey (Famke Janssen). A Japanese mutant named Yukio (Rila Fukushima) tracks Logan down and implores him to visit Japan, where Mr. Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi), now the CEO and president of a large technology company, is dying of cancer. Yashida wishes to bid Logan farewell. Logan agrees, but finds Yashida under the care of a mutant called Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) and fearing for the life of his distraught granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto), who will inherit the company.

Tokyo was a good choice for the action sequences. The busy, colorful background lends visual interest. Apart from that, the story doesnt make sense, the romance is unconvincing, Yukio is uninteresting, the old man hardly matters, a tangential relationship between Mariko and her old flame doesnt have any purpose. The one interesting character is Viper, and she gets very little screen time. Thats too bad, because shes the most compelling female mutant on film since Rebecca Romijns Mystique. Harada (Will Yun Lee) is a handsome and skilled archer, head of the Black Ninjas, sworn to protect Yashidas family. He might have made a good hero, but hes wasted as a second-tier villain. As usual, the plot is so cluttered with characters that none get much time. This time, most of the clutter is disposable Yakuza, not mutants. The Wolverine is dull and adds nothing of value to the franchise except for Khodchenkova as Viper, whom I hope to see again.",1451347200,,1878,4.924290220820189
3601733,4,B001GCUO16,I thought this was a pretty decent follow-up to the Origins movie. I use the term 'follow-up' because it isn't really a sequel or a remake. You can watch this movie without having seen the other.,1451347200,,195,4.444444444444445

3602524,2,B001GCUO16,"Dear god, what in the world is this? Wolverine goes to Japan and fights the Yakuza and giantu Japanesu corporation who kidnap granddaughter of Wolverine friend(?) who run a-for mentioned giantu corporation and Wolverine mustu rescue! We've seen this same movie a thousand times before with little variation and yet another sword and sake Japanese crime drama is just not interesting nor novel in 2013. Of course Wolverines ability to heal is the crux of the matter here and why the giantu corporation is interested in him in the first place, but that's really a side issue and ultimately serves as an excuse for more fighting.

And fighting is really the entire point of this movie. Apparently everyone in Japan is proficient with martial arts and the use of the katana. I found myself yelling ""just shoot the guy, don't sword fight!"" and ""why are you using arrows?!?"" But without the endless and often nonsensical action the movie would be one quarter as long. Endless fight scenes are as uninteresting as watching someone else play video games.

Pedestrian and boring on so many levels despite the cuteness of Rila Fukushima playing a cute girl assasin (how original), that it took me 3 attempts to finish it and I was not a better person for my perserverence. Fans of second rate Japanese martial arts movies or Hong Kong crime drama or endless fight sequences might like this, everyone else, especially those who were expecting an X-Men movie, run away!

3602525,1,B001GCUO16,"Anime version of X-Men / Wolverine. The film is mainly in Japanese and features a lot of very cartoon-ish fight scenes.  Between the fights are hebetudinous scenes of women staring out of windows, with looks of sad longing.  If you can stay awake, you will join them in staring and longing for something resembling the strong writing, plotting and directing of the earlier films. Jackman is utterly wasted here - there's not much for him (and his stunt double) to do except fight.  It's hard to make wisecracks outside of one's native language and culture; everyone is speaking Japanese, and as such, there are no jokes. Very by the numbers, comic book / cartoon plot that makes no effort to rise above the genre.",1438646400,,713,4.733870967741935

I was so tired of Fox hammering in mutant cameos just for the sake of cameos and ruining future use of cool characters. The focus is on Logan separated from that X-Men Universe and they do it masterfully well. This movie has done what Fox has refused to do over the years.

On a lark, intending to have something on as mere background noise, I decided to start watching The Wolverine...expecting a steaming pile of dung like X-Men Origins: Wolverine was.
This is a worthwhile movie to watch, with a fairly well constructed narrative and with acting that doesn't make me want to cringe with each new scene. This exhibits none of the same insipid scripting and pointlessly altered characters that bore no resemblance to the source material that have populated both the previous Wolverine movie and the previous X-Men movie that came before it. Maybe this is an indication that FOX has learned a lesson from the work that Disney/Marvel have done with the IPs that they have been bringing to the big screen (notably excluding the less than stellar Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D series). Having not seen the PG-13 release, I can't speak to how awful that might have been and what editing was done...but this version is actually quite good.",1437868800,,973,4.939024390243903

3603115,3,B001GCUO16,"Despite Wolverine - arguably - being the heart of the X-Men franchise, the character works better as part of an ensemble. Both this movie and its predecessor, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, are weaker entries in the mutant universe. Despite two movies between this and the original trilogy (although both were prequels), The Wolverine picks up after the events of X-Men 3, with Logan being called to Japan at the request of an old friend. Personally, I always liked the comic book plots that found Wolverine in Japan, but this movie didn't entertain me as much. It's not a bad movie, but there is less emphasis on mutants, their powers, and their struggle to find acceptance in an increasingly hostile world (which, quite frankly, is the appeal of the entire franchise). And while this movie emphasizes Wolverine's personal life, it just looks at a small - not all that interesting - part.

The plot never actually drags and the fight scenes are as good as anything in the first three movies (although, again, I would have liked to see more mutant-based action, instead of something that could have come out of any run-of the-mill action film), but this remains my least favorite of the X-Men movies. What earned it the 3rd star is the clip after the credits. It reminded me why I get excited about mutant movies.",1433894400,,1308,4.787610619469026

I want to see literally 5 gallon buckets of blood and guts thrown at the camera every minute.  I want to see Wolvie hacked to pieces standing on a mountain of mutilated Yakuza.

3603195,3,B001GCUO16,"I liked the movie because I like Marvel comics and the Wolverine character... but I have to admit, that this movie wasn't nearly as engaging as many of the others.  I'm glad I watched it, and I may watch it again someday... but it'll never be my first choice when I reach for a Marvel comic film.

This film is very untrue to the actual story of Wolverine.  In general, all the Marvel films are a bit on the untrue side... but this one is extremely so.  Madame Hydra isn't portrayed anything akin to who she is in the comics... not to mention the fact that she was a big player for a long time (decades), whereas this film shows her as a small-time villain who dies almost as fast as you meet her.

Also, this film portrays Wolverine as having escaped Japan almost as fast as he got there... when, as per the comics, he stayed in Japan and trained to master level proficiency in the samurai arts, including the use of a katana.  This is actually where he originally honed his fighting skills to a ""professional"" edge.  Before that, he was basically not much but a common street brawler.  This film portrays his familiarity with a katana as basically ending at knowing what to call it... which is ridiculous.

The Weapon X Project caused him to lose all his memories from before the project, including his memories about WWII.  However, as per canon he never ""observably"" forgot the skills he learned during those years, for example his fighting skills and proficiency with a sword.  This movie has all that backwards... According to the movie, he lacks familiarity with swords, but has a full memory of his WWII years.  The reason why many people never realize that wolverine is a sword master, is because technically he never needs to pick up a sword!  Why would he, if he's got adamantium claws?  Nonetheless, it's true.

It seems like, overall, this film made a comical (pun intended) attempt to cover the ancient history of Wolverine but, in the attempt, left out such glaring gaps of important history (and bastardized the bits which it did include) that the plot felt shallow and meaningless.",1432944000,,2098,4.617250673854447

3603228,3,B001GCUO16,"Somewhere in the distant past, I saw the original X-Men.  Since I've never read comic books, that was my introduction to the characters.  I don't remember much about it, but I wasn't impressed enough to see either sequel.

Fast forward to a few months back and some friends wanted to re-watch X-Men Origins: Wolverine.  Since the story takes place before any of the movies, I figured maybe it would help me appreciate the characters more.  Sadly, it also left me unimpressed.

The movie opens with a young boy being pressed and pressed until he reveals his mutant qualities.  He has bones in his hands, and when pressed he uses them to kill someone.  As a result, he and his brother go on the run.

Their mutant qualities also make them live a long time because we next get a montage that takes them from the opening of 1840 to the present day.  After fighting in most major wars, Logan (Hugh Jackman) and victor (Liev Schreiber) have gone their separate ways.  Logan is actually living with his girlfriend in Canada and doing his best to behave like a normal human without mutant qualities.

That's when tragedy strikes Logan and he undergoes a process that will turn him into the Wolverine.  His reason for doing this?  To seek vengeance on those who have wronged him.  But what will happen when that hits very close to home?

I've heard lots of good things about this movie, so I sat down ready to sit back and enjoy.  Instead, I was left oddly detached.  I do think part of the problem is me.  Since I don't know the X-Men universe at all, many of the references or cameos meant nothing to me.  While my friends were geeking out at them, I was just shrugging my shoulders.

But a big part of the problem is with the plot of the movie.  It is just your average revenge flick dressed up in superhero garb.  There is nothing here we haven't seen done before.  The plot ""twists"" were predictable.  I just couldn't get past the recycled feel to the story to get into it.

I will say this for the movie, they made great use of the superhero elements.  The action sequences are wonderful.  It was just what held them together that was lacking.

The movie is filled with special effects.  As is usually the case these days, they are fine.  Maybe a shot or two weren't up to par, but most of the time I had no trouble believing what I saw on the screen.

Likewise, the acting was fine.  I wouldn't call any of the performances great, but none of them threw me out of the movie, either.

Maybe I'm just the wrong guy to be watching X-Men movies.  So far, they are two for two in not impressing me.  After seeing X-Men Origins: Wolverine, I'm not that anxious to go back and watch the ones I've missed.",1432339200,,2695,4.40650406504065

I had some difficulty paying attention to the plot. Mainly because it wasn't that interesting or practical. It is essentially Wolverine being told ""Don't do that, you're not going to win"", Wolverine doing said thing, and Wolverine winning.

This movie works well as a stand-alone film in the series because it doesn't have many ties to any other sequence of events in the series.  That was the mistake they made with the first wolverine film because the timeline in it doesn't make sense in the rest of the X-men movie world and it's frustrating to watch because of it!

3603571,4,B001GCUO16,"The Wolverine (2013)
 When the cynical old movie reviewer says Oh Boy at the end of a film, perhaps we have something extraordinary.  Or in this case, something really cool, exciting and complicated enough to be interesting solely in terms of a twisted plot.  Most of the film takes place in Japan, a mysterious land with an impenetrable culture.  For most of the time we don't quite know who is doing what to who or why, which keeps us guessing.
 Hugh Jackman carries the film on his own very broad shoulders.  He is the Wolverine.  The lovely Japanese actresses Tao Okamoto (in a role not very different from that of a Princess in distress) and Rila Fukushima as her martial arts practicing adopted sister are good actors and great eye-candy but their roles could with little imagination have been filled by any competent actress.  The same goes for Svetlana Khodchenkova as the evil mutant Viper.  She is a good actress in a role that is slightly written.  Hugh carries the load and he does in with magnificent vigor.
 Without getting too far into the story, we can say that the film begins with Wolverine slowly falling apart.  He is living alone in the sub-arctic, drinking a lot and having horrible nightmares about his lost love, Jane Grey.  Fans will remember that Wolverine killed Jane Grey in a previous film.  That sort of thing will give a fellah the nightmares.  By the end he has worked through his issues and the Wolverine is back and ready to rock.
 X-Men fans will be over the moon for this one and the general run of the public should also like it a lot.  The special effects are dramatic without overwhelming the plot.  The many fight scenes are expertly choreographed, realistic and exciting.
 The all star production team brought everything together in the way that we wish all Hollywood mega-budget pictures would do.  James Mangold (director of the superb 3:10 to Yuma and Walk the Line) directs from a screenplay by two real pros.  Writers Mark Bomback (Live Free and Die Hard) and Christopher McQuerrie (Oscar winner for Usual Suspects) bring the right combination of action and excellent, convoluted story telling that makes The Wolverine a real four saw blade winner.
 This is a PG-13 movie (violence by the boat load, intimated sex, no naked people) that is two hours and six minutes long.  Estimates of the budget come in north of $100 million.  The Wolverine took in $55 million opening weekend and should continue to do very well.",1427587200,,2461,4.736470588235294

We talked for awhile about 15-20 mins.we talked about many things, his family, son and his wife, (she has the same first name as me) Australia, his first major movie, the movie with the vampires. I talked about the guy I was with, and the problems he had, and how he was treating me, head games, drinking, going out by the garages at the condo complex where we lived with a loaded gun, because he thought someone was trying to break into the his garage.  Hugh Jackman listened , talked and gave me advice, to leave my boyfriend. He showed genuine concern, and was a good listener. My then boyfriend took a photo of us together, me and Hugh. After I got home, I moved out. The last time I talked to the ex_ boyfriend, he had the picture of me and Hugh, but I was to afraid of the exboyfriend to go get it.

First off, it is still without question that Hugh Jackman makes a fantastic Wolverine, and I feel he embodies the character.  The other big change is that I love that it is set in Japan which is a departure from most of the superhero movies thus far.  The story itself is done quite well, you have a bit of mystery and intrigue trying to find out what is going on and Wolverine is in his most vulnerable of states.

The action set pieces are wonderful to watch and the special effects this time aren't cringe worthy.

The movie has good pacing and I never felt bored or disinterested.  I would recommend it for any X-Men/Wolverine fans.  It makes a fine action movie on it's own as well.",1427155200,,858,4.426751592356688

3603670,4,B001GCUO16,"Wow. Unbelievable. Those are some words to describe this epic X-Men film that crushed ""x-men origins: wolverine"". ""The Wolverine"" was action-packed with an excellent story that shows Wolverine's unique powers and how his powers can be his weaknesses (watch the film to find out what I mean). I love how the story takes place mostly in Japan and how the hot, beautiful Japanese girl ""protects"" Wolverine. Also, I love how the Japanese guy who ""released"" Wolverine during World War II turns out to be the ""bad guy"" later on (ungrateful SOB). If you're looking for the other X-Men characters (e.g. Professor X, Colossus, Nightcrawler, Storm, etc.) in this film, you're out of luck. If I correctly remember, only Jean Grey/Phoenix is in this film (as a haunting memory). However, the fact that only Wolverine was in this film does not detract from the quality of this film. ""The Wolverine"" had action, twists and turns, a story/plot that veered off-course from the typical superhero/comic-book hero film, and beautiful Japanese women. If you're a die-hard Wolverine fan, and you hated the piece of garbage that was ""x-men origins: wolverine"", then buy and watch ""The Wolverine"" because it belongs in your collection and it sets the bar up high for the ""X-Men"" movies.

3603734,5,B001GCUO16,"4.5 stars I'd say. This review is long overdue for me. I enjoyed this movie very much, but more than that, I thought it was a great film. Bryan Singer's X-Men films are breathtaking in their spectacle but this film is equally impressive in its meditative quality. Aside from the action sequences, which are great, and a bit of a wild climax, there is a good bit of downtime in this film during which the film explores Wolverine's struggle with his powers, the cost of those powers, and the meaning of immortality. I don't think the films delves into it as intellectually as it might have, but, by filming it the way he has, James Mangold shows us that the film is a least as concerned with being a story about people and legacy as much as it is with being a ""superhero"" movie. I have always liked the association of Wolverine with Japan in the comics. It seemed very natural, and I'm glad to see that story translated on film. The theme of Wolverine as a Ronin ties in nicely with the problem Logan has of outliving everyone he may fight for (Yoshiga) or care about (Jean). Lovely storytelling.

All in all, I expected this movie to receive better reviews from critics than it did. It's underrated, not just as a Marvel movie, but as a film in general (and Mangold, as usual, continues to be underrated as a director). The movie gets around to one of the seminal events in superhero storytelling--showing us the hero without his powers. The question is, implicitly, is he still a hero? And it allows for an examination of the character's humanity. This was done in Superman II when Superman gives up his powers to be with Lois Lane; it's done in Spider-man 2, wherein we see Peter save a child from a burning building without the benefit of his powers; we saw it in Iron Man 3 when Tony Stark has to improvise an attack without the benefit of his suit; we saw it in The Dark Knight Rises when Bruce Wayne goes broke, and has to see what he's really made of as a man in escaping from the pit. And generally, showing us a superhero without his powers has basically the same effect as planting a fundamental weakness in the hero--eg. Kryptonite for Superman and Water for Bruce Willis's character in Unbreakable. The device works well in The Wolverine as Logan is repeatedly haunted by thoughts of Jean Grey forcing him to wonder if being mortal is really such a bad thing.

As I said, I think this film is underrated, and I would in fact place it in the top five superhero films to come out of the genre since the release of X-Men in 2000. In no particular order, I think the top five of the last 15 years are Batman Begins, Spider-man 2, Unbreakable, The Wolverine, and X-Men: Days of Future Past. However, there are a number of others of surprisingly high quality that they could appear on such a list--Captain America: The Winter Soldier, X2: X-Men United, and X-Men: First Class, to name just a few. I continue to be amazed by the quality of Marvel films, since it seems like studio executives will inevitably screw up a good thing by trying to get too involved, thinking they know best (e.g., Superman III, and, recently, Amazing Spider-Man 2). Finally, this review would not be complete without giving props to Hugh Jackman for giving the role and the character such respect, and not playing the character with a big wink of the eye (like Roger Moore did with his James Bond films), just because it's a fantasy story. Overall, an excellent addition to the Marvel film canon.",1425859200,,3478,4.519047619047619

If there is a weakness to this movie, it's that it has a hard time keeping a consistent tone.  The third act shifts directions rather radically for the climax.  I think I would have enjoyed it a bit more if it had stayed a little more down to earth.

3603970,3,B001GCUO16,"""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" gives us Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) backstory, as the title implies. He was a sickly little boy named James in the mid-19th century, who discovers his mutation -sharp bone claws that protrude from his hands- when he witnesses the murder of his father. On the run with half-brother Victor (Liev Schrieber), who has a similar mutation, the pair put their talents to use as soldiers, over and over again, in the US Civil War, two World Wars, and Vietnam, where Victor's wanton violence gets them in trouble and attracts the attention of Maj. William Stryker (Danny Huston), who invites the brothers to join an elite military force of mutants called Team X. Stryker's goals are opaque, but his disregard for civilian life eventually provokes James, who now calls himself Logan, into abandoning his military career to become a logger. But someone is killing the old Team X, and Stryker asks for Logan's help. Victor has degenerated into an animalistic mass murderer, and Stryker's ever-secret projects are not what they at first seem.

I prefer Brian Cox' rendition of Stryker in ""X2: X-Men United"" to Danny Huston's, but this is a younger version of the character. Hugh Jackman is put upon to carry the film, and he does. Logan's girlfriend Kayla is captivating as played by Lynn Collins. Victor acts like a cross between an ape and a vampire, complete with fangs, to represent the flip side of Logan. It's over-the-top, but Liev Schrieber throws himself into the part. He must have been exhausted. The plot, well, I suppose this is as good a backstory for Wolverine as any. I noticed that Wolverine doesn't know where Stryker's ""island"" facility is, implying that he's never been there. But Weapon X, who is Wolverine, was created at that laboratory. Where else would he have received his adamantium skeleton? Plot hole. I also think that, if Stryker is to be the big villain, his motives and strategy need to make more sense. Critics didn't like this film, which I think is partly because it followed better X-Men films, but Hugh Jackson commands attention. Professional poker player Daniel Negreanu has a cameo, interestingly.",1424390400,,2152,4.977777777777778

3603978,4,B001GCUO16,"The Wolverine... a film I have been hoping to see.  Nearly flawless in its first two thirds, it falls into illogical clich at the final chapters.  Despite that, it is light years beyond _Wolverine: Origins_.  Famke Jansson is excellent as Jean Grey, sort of a metaphor for the comfort of the death Logan longs for after the events of _XMen III_ ( Like Origins a substandard movie ).

Hugh Jackman is as shredded as Stallone ever was for Rambo and looks awesome as the wrecking ball
made out of claws that is the Wolverine character.  It is a shame that Jackman's will soon age beyond the
role; but there is always OLD MAN WOLVERINE I guess.

The character of Mariko was wonderfully acted and is delicately beautiful.  Her interaction with the world-weary Logan is nicely done and believable.  The little fire pot ( Rila Fukushima ) who plays Yukio, Logan's sidekick in _The Wolverine_ is a revelation.  The  interplay between them is so good you want to see her again in exactly the same way you NEVER want to see Robin again in the Batman franchise.

It all ties up into a neat package for the beginning of _Days of Future Past_.",1424131200,,1130,4.544554455445544

Also, Mangold does a really great job at exploring Japanese culture. Logan and the girl kneel by the very low table as they eat their dinner. Their bed is like a mattress on the ground. Plus a lot of stuff in the beginning of the film.
One more thing, the old man's ""pin bed"" was just so cool.

3604062,3,B001GCUO16,"I bought this title on sale and had no idea the 3D version would be the Theatrical Version! Come on why would someone purchase a 3D Extended Uncut version with only the 2D Version being the Extended Uncut version??
I took a star away for this alone. Marketing a 3D title as extended and uncut and only providing the 2D version is such is deceptive.  Say 3D Theatrical cut with 2D extended uncut version. I will pay more attention in the future.

The 3D content was ok. Not a whole lot of 3D content here and some of it is just in the foreground to increase depth.

The movie was not as good as many of the other X-Men titles but I enjoyed it.

I paid the same amount for this 3D version as the 2D only extended version so it was a wash in cost but I didn't realize the 3D version was Theatrical version until I finished watching it.",1422748800,,832,4.149068322981367

I own the Wolverine graphic novels that this film draws upon for Wolverine's solo adventures in Japan.  I wanted to love this movie, and for the first two thirds I actually did.  Unfortunately the finale was (for me, at least) a let down.  Most of the film is pretty darned entertaining, but the toward the end it veers into over the top characters and general silliness.  Hugh Jackman is, as always, stellar in his portrayal.  The supporting cast is mostly very good too.  It's a shame the story descends into cartoonishness toward the end.",1422662400,,624,4.669724770642202

3604087,1,B001GCUO16,"Aaaaargh!!! Why does Marvel keep wasting money and the audiences time!

The Wolverine is so bad I'd rank it up there with The Fantastic Four. The plot was more comic booky than a comic book. About 15 minutes into the movie I sensed the script written for this movie slowly unravel to where the whole story to this movie felt less and less interesting.

Watching Hugh Jackman was tiring as was his acting trying to portray this lethal weapon but seemed more like a shadow of his former self.

Don't waste your time. Missing out on this movie won't be the end of your evening since more Wolverine films will come out eventually. And hopefully much better quality story telling.",1422576000,,675,4.608333333333333
3604088,5,B001GCUO16,"Just finished watching; along with Jeff H., ""The Wolverine"" released by 20th Century Fox.
I would be totally remiss if I didn't point out that this is another example of how Jeff H. and I do things totally out of sequence.  We haven't watch the first two movies in ""The Wolverine"" series yet. Don't ask me why we do this - it's just a habit of ours.  [Yes, Zack is the same way too.]
""The Wolverine"" picks up on some of Logan's back story, while he's living in isolation in the Alaskan Wilderness.  Logan was a prisoner of war in Japan during the Second World War.  He rescues a Japanese soldier from being killed during the second atomic bomb drop - which sets the stage for the events that unravel in Logan's life during present time.
The Japanese soldier he saved is now dying and wants to repay Logan's kidness by giving him a way out of enteral life - the peace of the grace.  Logan reluctantly agrees to go to Japan to pay his respects to an old friend; but is soon involved in an internal family struggle over a vast fortune and control of a business empire.
Somehow during this, Logan begins to loose his healing abilities.
Yet all is not what it seems and there is a spectular double cross nobody will see coming - least of all Logan.
Jeff H. and I think ""The Wolverine"" is an excellent live-action anime movie that adds to the compelling Marvel Movie Storyline.
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!

3604114,5,B001GCUO16,"This takes place after the battle with The Phoenix.  Logan was grief stricken over Jean's death.  Every time he closed his eyes he saw her.  That was the type of pain that men die from.  However Logan's mutation - the claws, senses, healing and primal attitude - was all about physical survival.  He wanted to die, but his body wouldn't let him.

In his grief he'd run away from everything and everyone.  He'd been living in the wild, literally in a cave.  His warrior spirit had gone dormant.  He believed that Wolverine had died with Jean.

That changed when he met a young mutant named Yukio.  Yukio's power was a very specific type of foresight, she could see how and when people would die.  She'd been sent to find Logan.  Her employer, Yashida, had known Logan during WWII.  Yashida was dieing, and wanted to see Logan again.  Yashida also had an offer for Logan.  He believed he could give Logan a normal life, could take away his mutation.  That was an offer Logan refused.

Once in Japan Logan became entangled with multiple battles, involving the Corrupt Justice Department, Corporations, and the Yakuza.  All of which were a threat to Yashida's granddaughter,  Mariko.  Yukio and Mariko had been raised together, they were sisters in every way except birth.  After Mariko was captured Logan and Yukio teamed up to save her.

Logan's battles were more complicated than usual.  His Mutant Powers had been diminished, especially his healing.  His body could no longer expel bullets, and major wounds caused scars.  His strength and endurance was also diminished.  His enemies believed weakening him would be to their advantage, they were wrong. By making him risk death to protect Mariko, they reminded him what it meant to be alive.  They'd made him even more dangerous.

Logan eventually learned how his power had been weakened.  A device was implanted inside his body, wrapped around his heart.  He used his claws to cut into his chest and ripped it out.  His powers were restored the moment it left his body.

For a minute Logan was actually dead, his system flat lined.  Then his breathing returned, his wounds healed, and scars vanished.  While that was happening Yashida's mutant hating son, Shingen, dueled Yukio.  She fought well, but lost.

Shingen was delivering a deadly blow, when his sword was intercepted by Adamantium Claws.  Mutant strength once again flowed through all of Logan's muscles.  Their battle was fierce, in words and blades.  It ended with Logan ran through by a katana, and Shingen impaled by the claws.  With that the Japanese had finally Woke the Sleeping Wolverine.

Wolverine went on to rescue Mariko.  Her captor was encased in bionic armor made of Adamantium.  Red hot adamantium swords severed all of Wolverines claws, and drills dug into the stumps.  The suit had been designed to link Wolverine's healing to it's wearer.

Wolverine screamed in agony, as his body was forced to rejuvenate Yashida.  The invitation and the threats to Mariko - all part of a trap.  All so Yashida could take, what Wolverine wouldn't give.

Mariko stared in horror at the monster that had once been her Grandfather. Then she and Yukio stabbed Yashida with the severed Adamantium blades, forcing him to drop Wolverine.  What little healing he'd stolen was used up to keep him alive.

Yukio and Mariko bought Wolverine the time he needed to heal.  Then he tore the armor apart with his bare hands.  Although the Adamantium blades had been taken from him, his original bone claws had already regenerated.  With a primal roar he impaled Yashida, and threw him out a window.

At the end Logan's mind had finally healed, he'd worked through his grief.  He was heading back to the States.  Yukio was with him.  She hadn't been invited, nor had she asked for permission.  She'd appointed herself Wolverine's sidekick - his student, ally and conscious.",1422230400,,3870,4.864615384615385

3604567,5,B001GCUO16,"""The Wolverine"" showcases more action with everyone's favorite mutant, and action even greater than in the previous ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"". This particular film has Wolverine journeying to Japan and puts him back in touch with people from his past, forcing him to relive past experiences in wars he's fought in. The highlight of this one is that for the first time, Wolverine is actually vulnerable. He now has to concern himself with things like mortality and death. I recommend this flick to Wolverine fans and comic lovers in general.",1419552000,,541,5.089887640449438

3604839,5,B001GCUO16,"Surprisingly enough, ""The Wolverine"" closely follows the original comic book volume of Wolverine, Chris Claremont and Frank Miller's four-part miniseries, that set the tone and standard for Wolverine and his story arcs. Even though the film is set after the events of ""X-Men: The Last Stand,"" instead of ""X-Men Origins,"" ""The Wolverine"" accurately showcases the events of the 1982 comic book series. Slight changes have been made to modernize and fit the screenplay into the continuity of the X-Men franchise but on the whole I was incredibly surprised by the amount of source material represented in the movie.",1416960000,,611,5.244897959183674

3604841,5,B001GCUO16,"This is the only version to watch, don't even bother with any others. The ""Unleashed"" extended edition includes Wolverine actually fighting that army of ninjas through the city near the end, for an extended action sequence that's awesome. I am stunned that they chose to delete it from the theatrical release.

Likewise, there's a little bit of additional flashback to Wolverine in Japan during WWII, and then there is more time with Wolverine and Mariko on the run while he is injured. The latter is important, because the subplot about his injuries is given more time to develop instead of feeling to rushed and resolved too quickly as it was in the theatrical cut. It includes an extra fight sequence that helps further develop his relationship with Mariko, too.

The theatrical release was good but flawed, and felt like it denied us important elements of the character and story. This ""Unleashed"" extended edition is everything the theatrical version should've been, in spades. I'd have given the theatrical cut a ""good but disappointing"" rating, but this one is THE ultimate Wolverine movie.

3604950,4,B001GCUO16,"For reasons unclear, Wolverine seems to have the biggest fan base of any of the X-Men,so it's not surprising that the first (and so far only) Origins movie in the series should focus on him.  In the Northwest Territories of Canada in 1845, 12-year-old James Logan makes two world-shattering discoveries: first, that the man he called his father wasn't (he's actually the half-brother of his older friend Victor Creed), and second, that as puberty engulfs him he's developed a set of ridged bone claws, sharp and strong enough to kill a grown man, that shoot out from between his fingers when he's stressed.  Running away together, young Logan and Victor eventually realize other things about themselves.  As they reach the age of 30 or so, they literally stop aging; both of them are automatic selfheals who can recover, within at worst a few minutes, from almost any wound or injury, including a bullet to chest or head; Logan (Hugh Jackman) has an inhumanly keen sense of smell and hearing, and Victor (Liev Schreiber), besides being able to dash along on all fours as fast as most animals and bound from place to place like a gigantic grasshopper, has fingernails that lengthen and harden to tigerlike claws at his mental command.  Together they fight in the American Civil War, both World Wars, and probably others.  Then, in Vietnam, their gifts are discovered, and they're recruited by Col. Stryker (Danny Huston), who has assembled a small company of other mutants like themselves.  In Africa, the group raids the heavily defended headquarters of a smuggler dealing in illicit cut diamonds.  But it's not the diamonds that Stryker is after: he's interested in a fragment of meteor that the smuggler has acquired.  Logan, meanwhile, has wearied of fighting, and walks out, leaving both his CO and his brother swearing to get him back.  Seven years later, when Logan is working as a logger and living with a schoolteacher (Lynn Collins) of Native American ancestry, they catch up at last, and what follows is a mosaic of pursuit, conflict, and deceit that concludes with Logan transformed to the amnesiac, metal-skeletoned Wolverine we met in the first of the X-Men movies.

Like all the Marvel movies, this one is notable for splendid effects, a thunderous score, and plenty of angst and action, some of it very definitely not for the youngest and most sensitive members of the family.  But if you like Wolverine and wonder how he came to be what he is, this is your movie.",1415577600,,2479,4.864608076009501

3604953,3,B001GCUO16,"THE WOLVERINE starring Hugh Jackman is a strangely formulaic movie.  It's as though someone took the plot of a James Bond movie from the middle 1970s, knocked out 007 and substituted Clint Eastwood -- and then replaced him with Jackman, who was sent to Japan to fight against Yakuza and such.  There are numerous action scenes, but the best one comes early in the show (small spoiler):  a struggle on top of a bullet train moving at high speed.  The love interest is a little perfunctory (as I said, this is kind of a recycled Bond plot).  Jackman evinces a certain gritty integrity in his acting, but what the plot excels at is giving him numerous opportunities to take off his shirt so that the audience can admire his torso and wonder at Wolverine's legendary rapid healing.

3605097,4,B001GCUO16,"Wolverine(released July/13)stars,among others, Hugh Jackman, Hiroyuki Sanada,Tao Okamoto, Rila Fukushima and  Famke Janssen. This,the second incarnation of a film on the Wolverine,which certainly keeps the action at the forefront where it belongs. The only weakness is the plot,which is a been-there,done-that kind of thing;the old rescuing a damsel in distress routine.
The story opens on Aug. 9/45 in a Japanese concentration camp just across the river from Nagasaki. The air raid sirens start to blare and the camp is in turmoil. A camp commander is quickly going from one area to the next releasing prisoners of war. The last one to be released is the Wolverine who is being held in a deep hole,covered over with a locked manhole cover. The commander tells him to leave but he retorts that he knows what is coming next and wants to stay put. As the commander walks away the Wolverine is up and outside following him. Just then the second atom bomb drops on the city and the Wolverine barely saves the both of them, by ducking back into the hole(guard in tow) and shielding him underneath the manhole cover.
Fast forward to the present and the Wolverine is living in the wilds of Alaska,as a hermit. When a group of drunk hunters using poison tipped arrows kill a grizzly bear he is very familiar with,he is out for revenge. Four of the five hunters perished at the hands of the bear,but the fifth is in a tavern regaling those who will listen, with his side of the""story"".The Wolverine,needless to say,makes sure the story now includes the truth of what they did. But before he can ""slam the point home"",in steps a Japanese girl who persuades him to let him go. The girl is Yukio,who is an adopted member of the old camp commander's family,and sister/companion to his granddaughter Marika. The old commander,Yashida, now runs the most powerful technology firm in all of Asia. He is dying and has sent Yukio to ask the Wolverine to come back to Japan to see him one last time. He reluctantly agrees.
In Tokyo the Wolverine,after a necessary and forced bath,finally meets Yashida. The conversation goes alright until the old man offers to give the Wolverine a natural death,i.e.to take away his powers and live normally. He of course declines and leaves. That night Yahida dies, but there is no peace in the Yashida clan's family as Marika tries to commit suicide;being saved by the Wolverine. Next day,during a huge traditional funeral/ceremony Marika is kidnapped by Yakuza gang members. The chase ends  on a fast moving bullet train where the Wolverine finally is able to subdue all opposition. They head to a place Marika thinks no one will find her,which is a retreat her grandfather had built on the property of the old concentration camp.
Eventually the Yakuza do come and capture her again. By this time the Wolverine has lost his ability to regenerate from wounds and is just not up to the speed he was before. In other words he is""normal"" now. Yukio thankfully shows up at the retreat, and after interrogating a Yakuza member left behind from the kidnapping,Wolverine learns where Marika is being held. He heads directly to the home of Marika's fiance' to learn that he was ordered to kidnap and kill Marika on her fathers orders. From there he travels back to Yashida's home to confront the son,accompanied by Yukio. While there Wolverine learns that a nano device was implanted near his heart which is causing his""normalcy"".He extracts it manually,during which time Yuio has to fend off Marika's father from killing the Wolverine. In the end he recovers his powers just in time to duel with the father to the death.
He now learns that Marika is being held in a facility in Yasjida's home town and off he goes. On arrival he is accosted by dozens of Ninja's who end up capturing him and taking him to the aforementioned facility. There he is interrogated by a Dr Green,who is also a mutant. Between her and Yashida they had developed a silver samurai;a huge samurai ""android"" made out of the same metal in Wolverine's body. Before the SS can chop off Wolverine's extended hand blades,a shot from a ninja arrow deflects the chop. Wolverine is loose and ready to do battle. Dr. Green kills the ninja who's arrow made the deflection and then takes on Yukio, who finally takes her down.
The Wolverine meanwhile has his hands full,so to speak. The SS eventually gets him in a death grip and is drilling into his now blade less knuckles to remove his regenerative powers to transfer to him. You see we have now learned there is a human being inside the SS,and it is Yashida. The SS was made to extend his life. A piece of broken Wolverine blade suddenly finds itself embedded in Yashida's head,thrown by Marika. The Wolverine then delivers the coup de gras.
The film comes to a close as Yukio and Wolverine are aboard a private jet. When she asks him where he wants to go he says""up,for starters"".A mid credit scene has him back in the States being met by Magneto who tells of a terrible threat. Fade to black.
Woven in to the rather banal rescue story are sub stories of Dr. Green(a mutant),the ninja who grew up with Marika and Yukio(also a mutant),and his old flame Jean Grey,whom he ""converses"" with throughout the film and who he finally releases in the end. These plots help elevate the film above the norm. Jackman is of course as ""jacked"" as usual,and does not disappoint. All others involved ably support him and bring their respective characters to life to fill the film.
Technically speaking the film is in its original a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp. There are no extras.
All in all and nice sequel to the first Wolverine and another valuable cog in the  X-Men ""wheel"".Recommended.",1413676800,,5706,4.738430583501006

3605177,3,B001GCUO16,"As an X-Men and Marvel fan I knew I would have to buy this movie, though I was hesitant. The strongest aspects of this film were Jackman and Scriber's portrayals as Wolverine and Sabretooth, respectively. The rest was... flawed to say the least. It's a shame because the film had a lot of potential to be a great film, but some bad writing and even worse decision making on camera and off made this movie a joke compared to the other X-Men-related films (even the travesty of X-Men: The Last Stand had it strengths such as a plethora of powers on display).

If you're a hardcore fan like me and know you'll collect all the films just because, then this movie is for you. If that doesn't apply and you'll only spend money on films of at least decent quality, just buy The Wolverine and the other X-Men titles. You won't miss much here, really. Honestly, giving this movie three stars seems a bit generous for me (I'd give it two and a half if I could).",1412640000,5,951,4.372881355932203

His real intention is ask for - or take - Logan's regenerative abilities.  How one might do this is, well, not important in a Marvel film.  The details quickly spoil the idea.  I laughed out loud several times at the ridiculous plot contrivances - especially Logan performing open heart surgery on himself!  The portrayal of Japan was was thin and stereotypical.  The fight scenes were at best comical.  The characters were flat.  There was no tension or suspense.  Overall, a waste of time and money.",1412467200,2,616,4.726415094339623

3605296,3,B001GCUO16,"I think I enjoyed X-Men Origins Wolverine better.  This was fun and full of exciting action, but I felt like I was watching a martial arts movie.  The 50 arrows in the back deal seemed way over the top for me.  Also I liked his metal claws better than the bone ones.  Here Wolverine travels to Japan to see a friend from WWII who is dying.  Arriving he finds himself up against the Yakuza and hordes of Ninjas as he battles to protect the man's granddaughter.  Entertaining, but not exceptional, still a pleasant way to spend some time.",1411516800,,536,4.418367346938775
3605297,4,B001GCUO16,"Entertaining with of course plenty of action.  The story of how Wolverine got started was interesting.  Since I have not read  Wolverine comic book since I was in high school I am not up on all the back stories and characters.  After watching X-Men I had no idea that Sabertooth was Wolverine's brother.  In this film he is only referred to as Victor Creed and not Sabertooth.  In the X-Men he seemed stupid, didn't talk and was just the muscle behind Magneto.  There were a few other things in the story like can Deadpool be killed or not.  He gets his head cut off, but in the credits you see in the rubble his hand moving over to his head.  I like the X-Men movies, but sometimes that are pretty vague about things.  Also more people come back to life than a soap opera.  Anyway for just plain fun and excitement this one is worth a watch.",1411516800,,842,4.2993630573248405

Not a very believable film, but acting done well, good special effects...always good to see Hugh without a shirt if u can get it.  Will always be an Xmen fan, but sadly not all Xmen movies are winners in my book.

Then there's the 2nd tier of movies which had the budgets and characters but failed to deliver to potential, yet were still good, such as Daredevil, Guardians of the Galaxy, Fantastic Four, The Hulk (I put the Hulk here for budget, but as a movie it was lackluster).  Then there's the 3rd tier franchises like Ghost Rider, Elektra,The Punisher and I'd now say Wolverine.  It's entertaining to a degree, but doesn't have a great feel to the efforts.  I actually fell asleep to this movie.  I enjoyed the other Wolverine movies more, and like Hugh Jackman's role as Wolverine in the ""X-Men"" films, it's something about the writing and production on this one which was lacking.  I enjoy a good hero vs villian film where you feel there is a connection between good vs evil and love the good guy and hate the bad guy. I didn't get a sense of any connection with this movie.",1410480000,,1017,4.653631284916201

Also is the movie seriously telling us that the x-men were in no way involved in the bombing of Hiroshima? The climax also ended on a bad note where it seemed that it was not well written or directed by any means. All in all it was a mediocre movie that had a few interesting parts(like the wolverine saving the Japanese officer.), as well as just terrible terrible parts where it seemed like not a lot of work was put into new and different ways on how the wolverine could defeat someone he saved. In my personal opinion this movie did not add anything to the X-men universe and was a waste of time, money, and effort on account of parts of the cast and the directors, studios, ect.",1409443200,,905,4.329411764705882

Let's not forget that in the comics Logan was never ""in love"" with Jean Grey, he was cetainly ""in lust"" with her and tried to nail her every chance he got, but the love of his life was always Mariko (who now for some bizarre reason is given a backstory as a champion knife wielder.  What?!).  The change to Shingen in this story was annoying too.  I did like the archer character / actor.  The action scenes were the action scenes typical of today, alot of fast motion where you never really see anything happening.  If you never read the comics, then you might enjoy this as a 3 star movie, but even so, it's just not very good.",1408579200,2,801,4.293333333333333

But over the last 14 years I have read so many of his stories that he is one of my favorite comic book characters. This is an enjoyable movie with plenty of action. The Asian side of Wolverine's life needs even more exposure and I hope they make more films of his life in Japan. Because his Asian training his a large portion of who Logan is. I also greatly enjoyed the fighting skills of the bad guys. I really dislike a movie where the star just runs through the bad guys and this is not the case in this film.",1408320000,,660,4.124031007751938

BUT its actually a 3d blu ray of the theatrical film, standard blu ray of the theatrical film, and a standard blu ray of the extended version. you CANT watch the Extended version in 3d..4 disks just seem unnecessary, why release the extended version only in the 3d combo pack if you cant watch it in 3d.  they could have put the extended version in 3d and used just 2 disks total.

3605957,1,B001GCUO16,"The worst X-Men movie ever made. The writer(s) who made this pathetic movie should be excommunicated from writing another Hollywood scrip again. Why? Here's why:

1. Wolverine does not have wooden claws (that doesn't make senses, since last I checked adamantium is not made from wood). I blocked out most of this pathetic movie, so Wolverine may have had adamantium claws later on in this movie, but at first I believe they showed him with wooden claws. Inaccuracy.

2. Pathetic story that didn't make smart audience members care for this movie.

3. There are so many more reasons why this movie is an epic failure, but I don't want to waste more of my adenosine triphosphate in divulging the reasons. Just don't waste your time and money watching this movie.

If you're one of the countless morons who gave ""x-men origins: wolverine"" more than 2 stars, then you truly are a moron.",1406764800,,881,4.776315789473684

However, the Wolverine is pulled back into humanity by an offer he can't refuse: mortality.

3606072,5,B001GCUO16,"I finally watched the blu-ray of The Wolverine over the weekend, not having seen the film since it's theatrical release a year ago. I kind of forgot just how enjoyable this movie is, and I think the unleashed edition added some good material. While my memory of the original cut is a bit fuzzy, the added scenes of Wolverine's struggle against the Black Clan during the film's climax go a long way toward enhancing that bit. If I recall correctly, the fight was pretty short-lived and somewhat anticlimactic in the original film, but in the Unleashed version Mangold has added some significant material, including Yukio joining in on the fighting.

For me, this is the definitive film version of Wolverine, and it's a great solo film for the titular character. It's certainly far more satisfying than the Origins movie, and here, we have Hugh Jackman at his best. Over the course of multiple X-Men films, he's grown into the role rather comfortably and the character's persona has become second nature to him. From past interviews, I know it was personally important to Jackman to deliver a Wolverine movie for the fans, and this one delivers the goods 100%.",1405814400,4,1158,4.848484848484849

3606120,2,B001GCUO16,"Of all the X-Men films, all but one have Wolverine front and center. Why? With all of the fascinating characters and their back-stories, the lazy, formulaic writers of these films keep resorting to an extremely boring character who sprouts knives, yells all the time, heals all wounds and never -- yawn -- ages. Wow, I am aghast. Wake me when these films start focusing on Professor Xavier and Magneto again.

To extenuate how slovenly the makers of this film were, they tried to add suspense by making Wolverine vulnerable after his powers are diminished by a reptilian played by Svetlana Khodchenkova. And after that happens, he proceeds to get shot like a dozen times during endless CGI fights, in addition to multiple concussions, and hits that would shatter bone. Thankfully (sense the sarcasm) he obtains his powers in time to fight an idiotic, gigantic cyborg samurai which houses the man whom he saved at the beginning of the movie. I cannot believe this script was approved.

None of it is suspenseful much less interesting, because you know the writers aren't going to kill off Wolverine. If they did, Hugh Jackman's career would be OVER. It amazes me how often he is desperate to draw from this well as he reprises his role again and again sandwiched between utter failures like Australia and Les Miserables. The character of Wolverine has become every bit as boring and formulaic as the man who has been typecast to play it. Disagree? Watch ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" again and just try to honestly tell me that Jackman WASN'T overshadowed by Liev Schreiber's Victor Creed by a country mile.",1405641600,,1603,4.889705882352941

3606312,2,B001GCUO16,"I'm probably in the minority in that I actually enjoyed ""X-Men Origins:Wolverine"". No it wasn't a great movie, but it managed to be a fun popcorn flick. When I saw the preview for this film, I decided to give it a pass, nothing about it grabbed my interest. In all honesty, the Wolverine character was always the least interesting of the X-Men mutants, and seems to only work when part of a larger ensemble. Maybe that's why ""X-Men: First Class"", the only film in the series which doesn't feature Wolverine is my favorite? They are running this on HBO this month so I thought I would give it a shot.

As the film opens we flash back to the end of World War II and a POW camp located just outside of Nagasaki. One of the Japanese officers, named Yashida, is running around freeing all of the Allied POW's. We discover that Wolverine is being held in a deep pit, and is the last person freed by Yashida as the mushroom cloud destroys the city. Wolverine protects the Japanese officer, shielding him from the blast with a sheet of steel and his own body at the bottom of the pit.

Jump to the present day and Logan is doing the hermit thing in the woods again (this never works out for him??), when he is summoned back to Japan by Yashida who is know dying. Stricken with cancer, the former Japanese officer is now head of the largest tech firm in Japan. He says the he can lift the ""curse"" of immortality from Logan, transferring it to his own body and repay the debt he feels he owes to Logan. When Wolverine refuses, the old man's physician, a snake-like mutant named Viper, pays Logan a visit and injects him with something. Logan is told that Yashida has died in the night, and at Yashida's funeral, gangsters try to kidnap Yashida's daughter, Mariko, who is heir apparent to Yashida's fortune. Logan saves the girl and escapes, but not before being wounded. Logan's healing abilities have stopped working, and he and the girl must now run for their lives.

Okay, so Wolverine vs. a bunch of ninja sounds totally cool...right? Well the execution is painfully dull. The fight scenes are few and far between, poorly choreographed, and poorly shot. I was into this movie for the first half hour or so, but when Wolverine heads to Japan, things grind to a halt. The story is predictable, and overly long. We know the ""twist"" that is coming, and it's just as amazing stupid as you can imagine. This character needs to retire, or be shuffled down to supporting player, I just don't think he can carry a movie on his own.",1404777600,2,2516,4.489082969432315

3606415,5,B001GCUO16,"X-Men Origins: Wolverine (the film that came before this one) had some disappointing moments, particularly to the hardcore fans.  I really enjoyed ""The Wolverine"" though, and if there's one real flaw to this movie, it's just that there wasn't a particular need to make it.  This is a great one-off story about The Wolverine.  It takes place after the events of the third X-Men movie (""X-Men III:  The Last Stand"") and in some ways this story attempts to address some of the issues with that movie, filling in bits that legitimize some of the unpleasant tragedies that for some fans really marred that film.

The Wolverine has some really great moments.  It starts with an interesting backstory set during World War II and as it brings the story forward to modern day, Logan has a chance to explore his own needs.  He questions what it means to go on living, and he examines the things that have happened in the past.  I'm reluctant to spoil this story too much for you, so I'll focus on some of the basics:

- it has some fantastic martial arts sequences
- it has one of the best 'top of a train' fight scenes I've ever seen--a sequence that reminds me of the excitement of the highway battle in the second Matrix movie because it gives a couple of nods to that scene.
- our hero has the proverbial rug pulled out from under him:  he isn't as strong as he usually is, there is a lot more real danger for him, and because the movie takes place almost entirely in Japan, he's in unfamiliar territory
- Hugh Jackman pulled out all the stops in trying to give Logan emotional depth while still keeping his character the warrior that he is--we get some great acting in this film, particularly at the very beginning and very end.

This review is for the 3D Blu-Ray though, so I have to take a moment to say that this is a pretty full package.  I like the fact that we get both the original and Extended editions.  The 3D aspect is a lot more mature:  the movie doesn't use 3D to see how many things it can throw at your eyes.  Instead it tries to paint a three-dimensional world.  I watched this on my Vizio 47"" 3D HDTV in 1080p and loved the feel of it:  the 3D look made my TV more like a window with the action inside of it.

If you haven't seen this movie yet because one of the previous films disappointed you, I think you'll be pleased with the improvement here.  If I had to compare ""The Wolverine"" to ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", I'd say I'm much happier to have this movie than that one, and glad I paid a bit extra for the Extended Edition.  It doesn't have any critical story tie-ins to the new movie ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"", so consider this an entertaining side story.",1404172800,,2679,4.373737373737374

3606422,5,B001GCUO16,"This movie was excellent! A far cry from the travesty that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine. While I enjoy Logan's character, I've always felt he got way more attention than he needs especially considering his further expanded role as (let's face it) the X-Men leader in The Last Stand. That made me not too pumped for Origins. However, though that movie was pretty bad he and Sabretooth were the two bright spots of the film. Here in The Wolverine not only is he enjoyable, but largely the rest of the cast. I enjoyed his scenes with Mariko (who in the film and source comics is, in my opinion, a better match for Logan than Jean ever was) and his friendship with Yukio. Yukio was my favorite character in the entire film despite some initial skepticism (she's a little older and looks WAY different in the comics). I enjoyed her humor and the changes they made to her TENDOLD. Her action sequences were simply amazing. Overall the action was great, the acting solid, and the story great and memorable.

3606459,4,B001GCUO16,"Here is what many fans including myself had been waiting for the chance to find out the back story of Logan a.k.a Wolverine. So many questions were left open in the first three Xmen movies about Wolverine and how he became what he was. And since he is suffering from amnesia and could remember nothing about his past but painful flashbacks, most fans (who again like me) weren't avid followers of the comics had many more questions about his character than we had answers regarding his very elusive past. This movie will fill in pretty much all of the blanks for you. We follow Logan from being a very young boy through adulthood and all the through the circumstances that lead to him becomine involved with the Weapon X program and how he became the Wolverine with that seemingly indestructible Adamantium skeleton.

We also get to see several of the relationships that majorly shape his life throughout the movie. Victor a.k.a Sabertooth...and just how close they were only to become bitter enemys later in life...as well as several other characters that we come to know better in later movies too (Cyclops, Emma Frost, Gambit, and Charles Xavier all make an appearance).

 I won't go into a lot of detail about what happens, because in doing so I would ruin parts of the movie for those that haven't gotten to see this one yet. But I personally loved this movie. In fact it just might be my favorite Xmen movie so far. I know that for some reason a lot of Xmen fans had very negative reviews for this one and I personally can't see one reason why. The story to me was very well written, the acting by all actors was superb, and it laid the very firm ground work for why Wolverine is the way he is. Maybe it had something to do with the comic books and the way the backstory was done in them I don't know. Although I am an Xmen fan I hasten to say that I am a fan of the movies and the Xmen cartoon that came on back in the 80's. I am not nor have I ever been a fan of the comics themselves, so maybe some of the rabid comic fans took acception to the movie conficting with things in the comics. I know some do that no matter what the movie so maybe that was the reason why some hated this one. That is the only thing I can think of why some didn't like the film.

Hugh Jackman was simply outstanding, and yes he is outrageously handsome in this one ladies. He to me IS Wolverine now. He has become the complete embodiment of the character and I can't imagine another actor playing him at this point. He is perfect in the action sequences, tender in the scenes with Kayla, and perfect as the pained anti-hero we have all come to love. Don't think of this as some corny comic book flick it's much deeper than that. It's a very good action packed movie that the whole family from pre-teens and up will enjoy.

Ryan Reynolds also does a perfect job at his role in this film. Together, this dynamic duo make a Classic Film.",1403740800,,260,4.8
3606461,2,B001GCUO16,"Besides Green Lantern, this is probably the worst superhero movie I've ever seen. From the terrible cg claws, to the confusing plot (why the elaborate trickery from a woman who can coerce people?) to the terrible characters, (how can you have deadpool with no mouth?) there is nothing of any substance. The only enjoyment you'll get is admiring the Jacked Man's body and picking apart the plot holes and inconsitencies.",1403740800,,419,5.0
3606462,3,B001GCUO16,"I love Japanese samurai films. I love X-men. I only liked this film. I don't know why.  Give it a shot. It's worth a once over, but there are way better X-men movies out there... all of them I think.",1403654400,,199,3.975
3606473,5,B001GCUO16,great this is a helpful product and can be use with the purpose it is intended for at all times,1403568000,,95,3.8
3606474,5,B001GCUO16,"Very good, I love everything that Hugh Jackman does, he's a wonderful actor, also loved him in Prisoner's. Don't miss this movie.",1403568000,,129,4.909090909090909
3606475,4,B001GCUO16,"I liek Hugh Jackman, he never disappoints.  I like the Wolverine movies, as does my husband.  He gets his blood and guts and I get the guy hottie!! LOL",1403568000,,151,4.172413793103448
3606476,3,B001GCUO16,"Well.. Again we get Hugh running around with a funny haircut and a sword this time.. Not just in his hands but also in his stomach and sides and just about everywhere else.. Not to mention the cross Atlantic love 'stick' he gives his co-actress lol. I wonder what the wife thought of that?

Anyhow. Good movie. Bad plot and BAD writing. Whoever wrote this (be you as you are) should be ashamed. I do not (for the life of me) understand why the whole movie was about a old guy trying to be young... ""Let me kill you Logan... Let me killllll you.... you KNOW it's what YOU WANT... let me KILL YOU"" lol Stupid, stupid.... and did I mention stupid? ;)

If you can get it at Redbox, do so. If you MUST get it on here then please, rent it first. Unless you love Hugh Jackman to the point of him not being able to do anything (movie wise) wrong then you'll be at peace with the movie. If you care whatsoever for the X-men, the franchise or anything to do with Wolverine then do not bother. You'll only hate yourself, the people who made the movie and Hugh Jackman for allowing his character to be altered to the point of becoming Chinese afterwards... Don't do it to yourselves ;)",1403481600,,1173,4.255605381165919
3606477,5,B001GCUO16,"Great DVD if you are an Xmen fan and also if your not. Great action shots, awesome computer genrrated scenes and a toch of romace to boot. Serious thrills and a good dose of humor. Wolverine is now my favorite movie.",1403481600,,216,4.2926829268292686

3606479,4,B001GCUO16,"I have loved wolverine as a character since the late 80's and really haven't been too impressed by his representation since X2. Barring the ending sequence with the Silver Samurai this movie NAILS the characterization I've been craving. The end sequence feels like they ran out of ideas and money.

Good movie overall. Definitely recommend.",1403481600,,340,5.181818181818182
3606480,4,B001GCUO16,This is the 4th movie in the series.  I think watching it first would have helped understand parts of the first three movies.  Good way to spend an evening.  Movie and action moved along quickly and kept my attention focused on the story.,1403481600,,238,4.488372093023256
3606481,4,B001GCUO16,"I thought this movie was good, with very good graphics, and special effects, but the storyline was so so. I enjoyed it don't get me wrong, but it could have been better. I would rate it a 3.5 if I could. Then again it is Wolverine, so I would watch it again nonetheless, as I make my way through the X-Men movies again to get ready for the new coming out in theaters, if it didn't already.",1403481600,,389,4.064935064935065

3606493,5,B001GCUO16,"If you are a Fanboy of the MARVEL/X-Men series, this is a must-see....  Also, for all you tried and true Fanboy nerds and geeks out there who look for movie extras from the original ""The Wolverine"" film out from theaters:  check out the car's license-plate that Logan is driven at, the night he meets the Japanese benefactor, to the house, it reads "" 7-25""  the international opening date of the movie; also, there is a shout-out to a SYFY program near the end of the film where the Wolverine is in the Japanese benefactor's warehouse,  it is #13.

3606495,2,B001GCUO16,I love wolverine in the comics and love watching Hugh Jackman but this show was extremely slow and boring for an action movie.,1403308800,2,126,4.521739130434782

3606497,1,B001GCUO16,I really didn't like this movie. There wasn't a good story to it. The most interesting part was how special effects had the brother run like the canine species. That was humorous.,1403222400,,179,4.625
3606498,4,B001GCUO16,Very enjoyable Wolverine film. Watching The Wolverine feels like reading a gritty Wolverine comic. You can always tell Hugh Jackman loves the role he plays.,1403136000,,156,5.28
3606499,4,B001GCUO16,"Hugh Jackman has done an extraordinary job at making the character of Wolverine his own. Liev Schreiber is an excellent counter and does a brilliant job of bringing depth to Victor Creed.
I enjoyed this screen adaptation and felt that it was a good, classic presentation of heroic story telling.",1403136000,,295,4.92
3606500,1,B001GCUO16,This was a horrible movie.  I wish I could get the time I wasted watching this back and my money.  No more Wolverine movies for me.,1403049600,,131,4.0
3606501,4,B001GCUO16,"good movie, but the story line seemed a little far fetched even for a Marvel comic movie.  Great action, acting, special effects, etc.",1402963200,,134,4.826086956521739
3606502,2,B001GCUO16,"Terrible. If nearly killing off Wolverine as many times as possible is the trend, as it seems to be, this movie wins the prize.",1402704000,2,127,4.333333333333333
3606503,5,B001GCUO16,this item was purchased as a gift for someone and they really like it very much. excellent gift idea for a wolverine fan,1402617600,,120,4.260869565217392
3606504,4,B001GCUO16,good movie one of my favorite xmen love the japanese theme came in good condition,1402531200,,81,4.466666666666667
3606505,5,B001GCUO16,Didn't watch any of the theatrical or original editions but this movie is good & potentially setting up a good X-Men run.,1402531200,,121,4.545454545454546
3606506,5,B001GCUO16,"This movie does Marvel proud and shows once more that 'The Wolverine' is an excellent stand alone character. Hugh Jackman does a great job of showing Logan's more human and vulnerable side.

I especially like the use of Japanese characters and their depictions in the movie as well. Well done, which I why I rate it as highly as I do.",1402531200,,334,4.475409836065574
3606507,4,B001GCUO16,Loved this movie! Love Wolverine aka Logan! Anything with him is good. Love Hugh Jackman! I thought the origins of Wolverine to be very interesting.,1402444800,,148,4.96
3606508,4,B001GCUO16,"I wasn't wild about this movie on first viewing (maybe the plot was too confusing). But watching it again had a much better impression. It was a fun ride with great visuals some emotional heft. I especially liked the film's immersion into Japanese culture. The climatic fight scene remains a bit of a let-down, but I was intrigued to hear that there is an extended version where this comes off better and I may try to track down that down.",1402444800,,439,4.5
3606509,5,B001GCUO16,A great father daughter movie. If you're daughter is as cool as mine. Excellent 3D and special effects are out of this world.,1402358400,,125,4.478260869565218
3606510,4,B001GCUO16,"I happen to be a fan of the entire X-Men franchise so this purchase was very simple.  While it isn't the best in the franchise, it is still entertaining.",1402358400,2,153,4.275862068965517
3606511,4,B001GCUO16,"Wolverine is a favorite character for X-Men fans--he's both mysterious and heroic--and this tale of how Wolverine became Wolverine is full of all the drama and action you could want.  Includes an impressive assortment of villains.  Not recommended, though, if you prefer being kept in the dark as no Wolverine secrets are left unrevealed.",1402358400,,338,5.2407407407407405
3606512,4,B001GCUO16,"Always a sucker for X-Men franchise movies. Though this one isn't as compelling as others, in that for me the interaction between the X-Men is always one of my favorite parts, it is an in depth look at why wolverine becomes the man he is today.",1402358400,,244,4.326086956521739
3606523,4,B001GCUO16,"This film was really helpful in understanding the story behind Logan. The love story gives a lot of understanding to his sad countenance. It is well told, and I would recommend it.",1402358400,,180,4.65625
3606524,5,B001GCUO16,"I'm not going to review the movie. If you're looking at buying this version, it's a safe bet you know what your getting already. I'm a collector on a budget so value is important and this has it. A good buy.",1402185600,,207,4.073170731707317
3606525,2,B001GCUO16,"Even my 12 year old didn't think this movie was very good. Wolverine is such an interesting character I we were both hoping to get more of his back-story in this film, but opportunities for character development and storytelling were missed in this film in favor of many ridiculous action sequences (people walking dramatically away from huge explosions behind them, etc.) I think this film needs a serious reboot.",1402099200,,414,5.0144927536231885
3606526,3,B001GCUO16,I felt let down by this installment of the X-Men series. I wish Wolverine would quit falling in love with every damsel he encounters,1402012800,,132,4.541666666666667
3606527,5,B001GCUO16,"Action packed, twists and turns .
You Gasp, you pant you rant and you hate somebody really bad by the end. Everything a great movie needs to have!",1402012800,,146,4.25
3606528,4,B001GCUO16,great graphics but plot sometimes just didn't make sense. why was father trying to kill his daughter? great CGI put nothing trully special. i wonder how are they going to address the claws in later episodes.,1401926400,,207,4.777777777777778
3606529,4,B001GCUO16,"The movie was good, not great.  It could have been great with a better script.  I approach movies ready, willing, and able to suspend my disbelief, but this movie really pushed the margins of that disbelief.  No, spoilers here, but I've never seen such ""skilled (?)"" Ninjas as in ""The Wolverine"".",1401926400,,296,4.764705882352941
3606530,4,B001GCUO16,"As it is a story based on a comic book character you have to understand it wasn't meant to be ""Greatest movie in the history of greatest movies"" and as an entertaining production then you are well on your way to accepting this movie.  It is entertaining enough to watch at least once.
All of the blah blah of character development and filming construction and story line.....it's a comic book made for the big screen.  Do not try and associate it any further than that or you will be severely disappointed.
Just watch it, enjoy it and then forget about it.",1401926400,,556,4.4950495049504955
3606531,5,B001GCUO16,I am late in getting into the X-Men....  I started watching them because I love HIGH!!!  I am watching them all now and I LOVE THEM...  This one in particular was great!,1401840000,,169,4.21875
3606532,3,B001GCUO16,"Was an okay movie but not the best storyline. Kinda of a slow start and okay finish, worth seeing only if you want to know/see all of Wolverine's life story!",1401753600,,157,4.266666666666667
3606543,4,B001GCUO16,"The Wolverine, as a character, is pretty much universally appealing. The conflicted and troubled tough-guy who is a loner because the circumstances of his existence don't invite long-term, close relationships. So, he succumbs to his baser nature and fights pretty much everyone and every thing. He's the  grumpy and disagreeable, hard outer shell with the soft and sweet, cuddly nuggat inside. He wants to be good, but has no choice but to be bad. All that going forward, this movie relocates our North American/Canadian blue-collar hero to Japan where he pits his skill with his skeletal-metal knives and regenerative wound-healing gifts against Ninja Assassins with Bows and Arrows, Samurai Swords, and trick weapons. It's interesting on a knife-to-knife combat basis, and they did work in a Canadian story component, but it loses a little in the classic Wolverine story sense. Still, it's an entertaining movie and worth the couch time. I wouldn't have paid to see It in a movie theater. Recommended.",1401753600,,1003,5.191358024691358
3606544,1,B001GCUO16,An unappealing story. Overacted. Convulted script. Who cares that the Wolverine finds himself in Japan doing whatever? Rent Ironman 3 and you get a much more entertaining story.,1401753600,,177,5.357142857142857
3606545,5,B001GCUO16,"Seems to work great for me. No glitches. Such a fun X-Men movie. Glad Marvel took the franchise back.

I can confirm this package contains the Blu-Ray, DVD and Digital Copy. Which is the way every movie should be sold.",1401667200,,218,4.45
3606546,1,B001GCUO16,"Hugh Jackman is in great shape and is a pretty good actor but that isn't enough to save this terrible film. If you like wolverine don't see this movie. Cheap cg effects and poor plot and pacing are my  biggest peeves in this film. Also, How is it that if wolverine's indestructible claws can tear through anything but the ninja's swords can deflect them? Do low level ninja grunts get issued adamantium swords? Come on...",1401667200,2,421,4.613333333333333
3606547,2,B001GCUO16,"Although I appreciated Wolverine's backstory (I particularly like where he got his name), I wish they would have done a less over the top version and left Ryan Reynolds out of it.  (Is it just me, or is he one of the worst character actors of all time?)  There is some good to this movie. The general story is good.  The length of time, wars, his tragic family history, how he was forced to agree, how he lost his memory - those were all good elements.  But many scenes devolve to ridiculousness, most of which are fight scenes involving ridiculous or ridiculously played characters. Ryan Reynolds character(s) comes to mind as well as the very cheesy card player.  And this is a superhero movie... which makes having ridiculous fight scenes and ridiculous superpower holding characters -people we can't take seriously- a particularly bad thing.  Those needed to be the strongest elements, not tongue-in-cheek caricatures.  The way it stands, they made what could have been a good movie into a bad one.",1401580800,,1002,4.824561403508772
3606548,5,B001GCUO16,"Amazing dvd! Wolverine is my fav! Awesome quality!!!! The ending made me cry, it was that greaaaat!!! Two thumbs up!",1401580800,,116,4.85
3606549,3,B001GCUO16,"Like all the x-men movies, this one is full of drama. That's probably the main reason why I dislike x-men movies. Anyway, it had a good plot, and sort of, interesting ending.",1401408000,,174,4.46875
3606550,1,B001GCUO16,I'm glad I didn't waste money seeing it in the theater!  Hollywood needs to spend more money on descent scripts and less on special effects!,1401408000,,140,4.6
3606551,4,B001GCUO16,"Goes well with the other X-Men films in my collection. Great action and good story. Highly recommend this movie. Go see it,soon. Thank you.",1401408000,,139,4.833333333333333
3606552,1,B001GCUO16,"Man, the picture quality is bad on this. Reminds me of when I was a test family for TCI digital cable back in the mid 90s. Come on, Amazon!",1401321600,,139,3.8275862068965516
3606553,5,B001GCUO16,"I chose this rating because it ended up a great family night. All enjoyed!! Movie played thru without interruption, and it was great to be able to pause while kids did there thing. Cannot do that at a movie theater.",1401321600,,215,4.4
3606554,3,B001GCUO16,"A strange movie.  Okay, before I get into it, allow me to highlight some glitches in the movie. First, Wolverine, when in the Japanese prison camp (of which I'm pretty sure there were none in Nagasaki) says something to the effect of 'that's a B-52 bomber. no one's gonna outrun that.' Did he know about the project code named 'Big Boy?' Did he know that it was the atomic bomb? And if so, how the heck would he know that? Also, he slept with his friend's granddaughter. Isn't that against some unwritten code of honor?",1401321600,,519,4.463157894736842
3606555,5,B001GCUO16,An excellent story and great special effects.  Introduced new characters in the mutant world.  The movie gave us more background on the Wolverine.,1401321600,,146,5.304347826086956
3606556,5,B001GCUO16,"Hugh Jackman...what more needs to be said. Very good, action packed movie. Great local shots and wow stunts make a great movie.",1401321600,,127,4.818181818181818
3606557,5,B001GCUO16,Even though it didn't follow the comic book which it is based on it delivers great action and excellent memories of when I first purchased the comic book it is based on.,1401235200,,169,4.3125
3606558,1,B001GCUO16,This was a disappointment from beginning to end.  I expected much more than was delivered.  It was to bad as Wolverine is one of my favorite charcters.,1401235200,,151,4.555555555555555
3606559,2,B001GCUO16,"You have got to be kidding me with those 5 star ratings. Look, I've like some bad movies in my time, mostly 80s for nostalgic reasons. But this? Hell no! This movie is such a bitch slap to the face if you are a X-Men, Wolverine, or even a comic book fan. Whoever says they liked it that much to take the time to review it on Amazon and give it 3 or above stars, don't believe them at all.

The writing is bad, the CGI use (very obvious with Wolverine's claws) is terrible, the story is just...ugh. Everything is ""okay"" until you get to right after Wolverine recieves the adamantium. Then, everything just keeps going DOOOOOOOWWWWNNNN HILL from there. Ryan Reynolds was perfect choice for Deadpool, but then becomes just misused and completely off of the comic book source set piece. Seriously, how could anybody like what they did to Deadpool. It's $#%&ing atrocious.
The only thing this movie did, was just screw up the continuity more for the X-Men films. You thought X3: The Last Stand was bad (well it still is), then stay away from this thing. Play the video game instead. You just don't PG-13 Wolverine's origins.

Seriously...an adamantium bullet  causes his memory loss? Not the extreme pain and trauma he recieved from the adamantium injection? This movie was so $#&^ing bad!!!!",1401235200,3,1287,4.685840707964601
3606560,5,B001GCUO16,"The video streamed very well with no rebuffering.

3606583,3,B001GCUO16,Nothing spectacular about this movie. The dialog is contrived and the action is extremely Hollywood. What else would you expect?,1401148800,,128,5.45
3606584,2,B001GCUO16,"As a lover of the X-men universe, this film was rather disappointing even with incredibly low expectations. Wolverine was present and you get a bit of his personality, but there were few other mutants in the film. You'll spend more time going ""WHAAT?!?"" then ""WOW!""",1401148800,,265,4.911111111111111
3606585,4,B001GCUO16,Hugh jackman is the perfect embodiment of the character.  Great story telling from a comic reel. I watched it again.,1401148800,,116,4.8
3606586,4,B001GCUO16,Movie was excellent. Portrayal of deadpool was not. Ryan Reynolds was a great Deadpool;  but the story of how he was told was not.,1401148800,2,130,4.416666666666667
3606587,4,B001GCUO16,"I love wolverine, and the actors do a great job. But whomever wrote this sad slow predictable story line should be fired. What kills the film is; egotistic cliches, unbalanced action (dialog one second, extreme special effects next second, then back to dialog again), romance story geared towards either morons or twilight tweens, and a very generic antagonist.

THIS SCRIPT SUCKED

But if you are a TRUE fan of wolverine, then you will enjoy it, i really liked it once i got past the script flaws.

Hugh jackman has aged well and its really starting to fit wolverines persona, rough and tough with a good soul, and besides the sometimes cheesy moments, he portrays that well.",1401062400,3,676,4.810344827586207
3606588,4,B001GCUO16,"Exciting, imaginative and well done, this film is sure to be worth you time. Don't forget to (as with all Marvel films) keep watching as the credits roll.",1401062400,,154,4.535714285714286

While the Wolverine was not a perfect film it is much closer then the first one we got to how the character should be shown on screen lets hope they jest keep getting better.

3606611,5,B001GCUO16,"It's fun watching the ""before times"" of some of these characters of the XMen. Hugh Jackman, playing the ""lone wolf"" does an admirable job as usual. And when his compassion kicks in, it's as deep as his anger. But Hollywood should be careful... any attempt to make The Wolverine appear weak or venerable is the kiss of death for the fan base. They almost went too far in this installment of the hero with a sever social attitude.",1400544000,,428,4.5

If you are familiar with the story it is nice to see it come to life in some way on the screen, if the story is new to you it is a good one and time well spent. Ninjas to my old 80s loving mind are a +1 in nearly any story and this one doesnt let you down, though Wolverine is a one man army or a very good samurai.

3606625,3,B001GCUO16,"Do not understand why the studio does not use the weapon-x series, it was created specifically to address many of the questions about Logan's past.  Just another example of how hollywood has lost its way by spending millions on a pile of crap.

That being said, this was not bad but it still felt discombobulated. Instead of Japan they could have gone for his PATCH character in Madripoor instead to explain how he left the world he knew.  In all honesty then should just stop making Wolverine movies, after the abortion that is know as X-Men Origins Wolverine.

The Wolverine is no Dark Knight but its way better than origins and expands on the beloved character. Following the the classic story of wolverine going to Japan and falling for a crime lord's daughter. Its a very well made movie. But i feel sometimes Marvel just spits out these movies so fast that the quality of the product suffers. Like DC takes more time with their movies and characters that when a movie comes out its sort of epic except the green lantern. But epic films like the dark knight trilogy and the man of steel in my opinion were epic awesome, mind blowing films. but don't get me wrong marvel movies are great just I think to spent more time on their art and characters when adapted them to film. But still a good superhero movie not on the level of a xmen movie but still great. Hugh Jackman is amazing as the wolverine has always.",1400371200,3,962,4.440677966101695

The claws don't look too cartoony when I watch it in high deff although the youtube clips making fun of it really show how fake-y the claws are.  I like the back story and all the action.  I really didn't like the 2nd Wolverine movie; it didn't seem to have much character.,1400284800,,322,4.063492063492063

If The Stand had not been so totally trashed by the writers and director then anything following it might have some validity.  But since they ignored 50 years of stories you get a travesty with Jean Grey dead before the Phoenix episode even happens.

Basing this movie where The Stand left off leaves NOTHING for a true X-Men fan.  If you think you are a fan but you liked The Stand and this one then you are not a true fan.  If I could give it ZERO stars I would.",1400025600,3,570,4.136363636363637

3606773,5,B001GCUO16,"I rate this movie a five stars. Because this is the best Wolverine movie every made. It has the same elements in movie as it is in the Marvel comics Universe. This movie is about the birth of the Silver Samurai. Logan (a.k.a. Wolverine) saved the life of a Japanese war general, in a military prison concentration camp, when the United States Air Force bomb it. Years later, the old WWII Japanese hero sends someone to find Logan in Canada and persuade him to go to Japan to meet with his old WWII Japanese friend. Later, Logan finds out that his trip to Japan was only a trap so that his mutant powers can be taken from him by his old WWII Japanese friend, who later became the Silver Samurai. It has drama. It has action. It has romance. And best of all, it has Ninjas. If you are a Wolverine fan, you will love to buy this movie. You'll be happy that you did.",1397692800,,862,4.2303030303030305
3606774,4,B001GCUO16,"So I can't make up my mind about The Wolverine. Overall, it was a good time at the movies. But some things nagged me. One thing that's never nagged me is Hugh Jackman's performance as Wolverine. No matter the shine or the stank on the vehicle, Jackman is never less than fully engaged and committed. I don't even mind anymore that there's this 6' tall actor playing the 5'3"" Wolverine. But it's an indicator of something shady when the mid-credit stinger gets your juices flowing more than the film's big action finale.

The first 75% of The Wolverine is terrific stuff. It features our snikting Canuck wallowing in an existential predicament. The film opens with a flashback to 1945 to a captive Logan held at a Japanese POW camp near Nagasaki. Shifting to present day, somewhere in the Yukon, we catch up with Logan circa post-X-Men: The Last Stand. This is a Logan who's gone hermit, who's given up, who's being haunted by recurring hallucinations and nightmares about Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) whom he had to put down to save the world.

But enter Yukio (Rila Fukushima), a precognitive mutant and a ninja. Yukio convinces Logan to journey to Japan to visit his dying old friend Yashida to settle a decades-old debt. In Tokyo, Yashida charges Logan with safeguarding his daughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto). And the dead man had cause to fret. Couldn't even wait for the funeral to get done before the Yakuza burst out of the woodwork, targeting Mariko and the rest of Yashida's progeny. And there's Logan, healing ability mysteriously stripped, charging into the breach.

To me, The Wolverine breaks down to a few highs, plenty of mediums, some lows. Gratifyingly, it's a character story and a self-contained story. It (mostly) isolates the world-weary Logan as a mutant in a human world and, in Japan, a stranger in a strange land. I said ""mostly isolates"" because he does share space with two other mutants, Yukio and, uh, the venomous ""Dr. Green"" (Svetlana Khodchenkova). Still, it's a refreshing swerve from the proliferation of mutants in X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine.

What works? Hugh Jackman works, more than anything else in this production. Because of his newfound weakness, Wolverine is physically tested as never before. Add in the emotional extremes his character must navigate and this just may be Jackman's most accomplished turn yet as Wolverine. Water cooler talk suggests that Jackman approached the Rock for tips on how to bulk up, and I guess Dwayne did him a solid because Jackman looks absolutely ripped. 75% of the narrative works. I love the location shooting in Japan, a glistening metropolis that consistently provides visually arresting backdrops. Rila Fukushima as ""Yukio"" is really terrific; I think Rila strikes up better chemistry with Jackman than does Tao Okamoto. There wasn't as much action as expected but two sequences stand out: the sprawling funeral melee and the disagreement on the bullet train (never mind that the combatants dis the laws of physics). And, of course, the almighty mid-credit stinger.

Also, I kinda love the Explorations of Mars love suite.

That was the carrot, here comes the stick. I mentioned that the first 3/4 of the movie is terrific, character-developing stuff. The one thing within that frame that I couldn't entirely buy into is the underwhelming love story between Logan and Mariko. I'm not convinced. Not enough scenes play out where we see them falling in love. They just are, suddenly. Mariko is supposed to be Logan's emotional life life, and yet I'm more invested when Logan's interacting with Yukio.

The final 25% sucks as the plot gives way to mindless CGI crap. The film required a villainous foil that could engage the viewer better. The Silver Samurai? Viper? Please. As it were, the big build-up meant nothing to me. So there's a slew of missed opportunities. The non-impactful big bads. The weak ending. The unconvincing romance. That extended sequence in which a horde of ninjas shoot arrow after arrow into a walking away Wolverine fails to deliver a payoff. I was waiting and waiting for Logan to turn around and administer berserk Wolverine justice... but nah.

It's lovely to see Famke Janssen reprising her Jean Grey role... for the first, oh, two dream sequences. After that, I was done, yo.

I could've sworn Logan spoke Japanese. But, probably, I'm getting my comic book mixed up with my movies.

Finally, to maximize your viewing enjoyment, you should probably watch X-Men Origins: Wolverine first, after which awfulness The Wolverine will come off as the best thing ever.

3606782,4,B001GCUO16,"Once again, Hugh Jackman assumes the role of ""The Wolverine"" based on the X-Men series of comic books. In this installment of the popular series of movies, Logan (the name Wolverine goes by) is asked to travel to the deathbed of an old acquaintance in Japan. The man whose life Logan saved wishes to give him a message.

The first 5-10 minutes of the film are wasted as Wolverine dispenses justice to the evil, white, rural, gun-toting, beer-swilling hunters who kill a grizzly bear (a friend of Logan, apparently) with - get this - a poisoned arrow! What nonsense! After the usual indoctrination by Hollywierd cultural-Marxists, the film moves on to the real story.

From the moment he lands in Japan, Logan is caught up in a web of cross and double cross with a giant corporation as the prize...or, so we think. I don't do spoilers, so, I'll just say the storyline is very good, the plotline taut. Logan only discovers what the real game is and what the real stakes are at the very end. There aren't any slow spots in this film and I was surprised by the ending sequence.

Early on in the movie, Logan loses his power of self-healing that has allowed him to take an amazing amount of harm and still come out on top in the past. He struggles throughout the film with this loss as well as the greater struggle he has faced for uncounted years by being, essentially, immortal. Visions of his past love - Jean Grey - speak to him in moments of delirium.

I think the action sequences are excellent. The CGI is used with abandon, but it doesn't come off as over-the-top to this viewer. Instead, it makes him the ""superhero"" the Wolverine is. Since the film takes place in Japan, there are plenty of fights with Yakuza, Ninja and samurai of a sort. The difference is that, in this film, Logan is vulnerable to the knives, guns and swords he has sneered at in the past and we see him...weak.

I thought the film, once it got going after the lefty-PC-rubbish, was quite good and this reviewer found it visually and substantively attractive. I recommend this DVD with four stars.",1397260800,,2072,4.544235924932976

3606839,5,B001GCUO16,"Unlike most fans, I actually enjoyed most of X-Men Origins Wolverine, because they reveal the hero's past life and adventures.  But after seeing this film I was blown away how much better the quality, action, and plot were.  The best element I loved best about this film was the showcase of different Japanese martial arts, and Japanese culture.  The arts of Kendo (fencing), Ninjitsu, Iaido, Aikido-Jujitsu, and some Karate were executed very well and accurately for the short time interval they had to show the martial arts.

 Wolverine Logan, played perfectly in my opinion by Mr. Jackman, is tied with Batman as the best superhero I have ever seen portrayed on film.  Finally now in the 2000's & 2010's decades we are seeing a decent portrayal of these comic book icons that reach a level of believability that was not achievable prior to that.

The only weak link in this film is the ""Viper"" character, it's like she just doesn't fit or isn't developed enough.

 What I also love most about Wolverine is that unlike Batman and Tony Stark he has absolutely no money, he lives life at the poorest levels of society but still manages to do the morally right thing. Wolverine-Logan stands up for justice while on top of it all just surviving in a harsh world.

  Wolverine is a fine military combat veteran, a true patriot freedom fighter (from the Canadian perspective), serving with out any regard for politics nor financial gain.  Logan Wolverine lives with the scars of that service ,being that he is almost immortal witnessing his comrades and the women he loves perish, all the while he goes onward living with the pain of immortality.

  Clearly what doesn't make any sense is why does Marvel or Hollywood even bother making this franchise for kids?  Can they not decide what audience they want?  Wolverine is really not a kids character at all.  What this film, along with the new Batman movies, needs is a rated R extension.  I did hear the unrated or deleted scene addition to this film is excellent.

Another problem with Jackman's Wolverine is, he is light years ahead of every other X-Men character!  In DOFP, when Jackman is teamed up with the other X-Men characters it equates to Clint Eastwood teaming up with Gumby, or John Wayne with Bugs Bunny.  These characters are pathetic when compared to the Wolverine!

  Jackman is such a great actor, that he's perfect as this character.  Even though Mr. Jackman has done a ton of these films I still wish to see a few more adventures soon.  Five stars for the Wolverine - Domo Arigato!",1396396800,4,2547,4.740318906605922

With that said, the action scenes are great, but this movie seemed like it was missing something---that being the XMEN. Wolverine is a character that you can take in measured doses. The story line started off alright, but becomes draw out toward the middle. The film is what I like to call a ""bridge"" film because it needs to span Wolverine as a loner and then try and connect him back to the XMEN, while still providing the audience with his background struggles and demons (this is no easy feet).

3606888,4,B001GCUO16,"""The Wolverine"" picks up Logan's story after ""X-Men 2: The Last Stand"", as our hero hides out in Northern Canada, guilt-stricken over the death of his love Jean Grey. An unexpected summons from his past takes a reluctant Logan to Japan. A dying industrialist named Yashida wishes to thank Logan for saving his life at Nagasaki half a century earlier. But Logan quickly discovers he has wandered into a lethal struggle for control of Yashida Industries, with family members, corrupt officials, and the Yakuzi mob all wanting a share of the action. Logan will try to protect Yashida's granddaughter Mariko with the assistance of the female bodyguard Yukio. And Logan will find himself shockingly vulnerable to unexpected opponents and to betrayal as the action moves from Tokyo to Nagasaki to a dramatic conclusion inside a hidden mountain fortress.

""Wolverine"" is a bit of a mix. It's fun to see Hugh Jackman inhabiting his Wolverine persona again, and there are some well-staged action sequences, along with some good location shooting in Japan. The movie is unevenly paced, as the action alternates with Logan's attempts to sort out a complicated plot and with introspective sequences in which Logan wrestles with his purpose in life. Too many scenes take place in the dark, where it is hard to follow the action or tell the actors from one another. Fortunately, it all comes together at the end; ""The Wolverine"" is recommended to fans of the franchise.",1395619200,2,1455,5.012396694214876

3606959,2,B001GCUO16,"Spoiler alert-ish.

The representation of Japanese culture was definitely something out of an American comic book. The characters in the film were rude and direct in a way that a native Japanese person just isn't. Even the attempts at subtly were delivered with a sledge hammer. The fact that some of the characters were gangsters doesn't change this shortcoming. Maybe writers in the US should stick to satire.

As far as the story is concerned, I think the film could have been subtitled ""Yakuza, Ninja, more Yakuza and Ninja, Yakuza-Ninja, and a Giant Robot""; and that would have left out none of the critical plot points. ""Self Repairing Cuisinart Gets Beat Up Then Wins"" would have also been acceptable.",1395187200,,708,4.9411764705882355

3606961,2,B001GCUO16,"Flick starts surprisingly strong, setting up a Japanese adventure for Marvel's mercurial un-killable loner, in which an aging Japanese soldier turned successful industrialist summons Logan to use his healing powers to save him and let Logan die. Seeing how this might be a bad deal for himself, Logan refuses, setting up a long and boring plot involving the wet blanket daughter of the industrialist and Logan fleeing to beach town (snooze) to hang out and inexplicably romance each other, all while Logan has lost his healing powers to some unknown force. What Logan would see in this dead fish is beyond this viewer, what with her sneaky cute ninja-half-sister (don't we all have one of these?) hanging around and practically begging lunkhead Logan for attention. Unfortunately for us, none of this even makes for a smidgen of comedy, as Logan brings us all down by reminiscing about the Nagasaki atomic bomb blast while staring at a manhole cover. It's nothing but up for the third act, as Logan is forced to confront an army of ninjas (healing powers returned, if that was ever in doubt) whilst storming a castle, which director James Mangold makes about as exciting as ordering lunch at Subway. After an ending that seems about 20 minutes too long, involving stuff we've seen in about a thousand better movies (robots!), Logan is set up for further, and hopefully far more exciting, adventures.

Two stars for an always good performance from Jackman, and for having a cute ninja sidekick that seems like she belongs in a much better movie than this.",1395187200,2,1554,4.908745247148289

He gets on a plane, and all of a sudden it's 2yrs later, and he lands somewhere in the US, and gets greeted by two surprising guests.  What happened with the kick-ass chic that he left Japan with??

But I don't think anything should be given a 5 star rating unless it is kid friendly, which this movie was not. The blood & gore, one F word, some sexual suggestions, and intense action keep me from letting my kiddos watch it and keep me from giving it a 5 star rating. Otherwise, it was an awesome movie. The sexual suggestions were less prominent than in X-Men Origins (which had a constant case of strippers), but there was more blood & gore in this one than in ANY of the other X-men movies. The cussing really was kept at a minimal, but it just seems like you cannot have Wolverine without him dropping one F bomb, which he did.
The story was fun, the action kept it exciting, and I personally think it is going to be one of my favorite X-men movies, but I give it a 4 star rating because it is not family friendly for the reasons listed above.",1394582400,,958,4.128342245989304

3607076,4,B001GCUO16,A true portrayal of a character like Wolverine would have an X rating to be accurate but this version adds just enough gory details to fight scenes to add more credability to the movie.,1394409600,,185,4.470588235294118
3607077,4,B001GCUO16,"The was a decent movie that lets you get into the life of Wolverine.  It touches on the the down side of being near immortal.  The movie was action packed, but I felt like it was a little predictable.",1394409600,,200,4.102564102564102

3607081,5,B001GCUO16,"I'm gonna start off by saying that this movie is great and I think it's stupid that everyone is complaining about the fact that the unrated version is only on the blu-ray 3D pack. I'll admit it was a bad idea on Fox's part, but the price difference is only $3. If you're complaining about spending an extra $3 then maybe you shouldn't be buying a movie to begin with. In my opinion it's worth the extra $3 cuz the movie is great and the unrated version is definately better than the theatrical.

Now onto the actual review. Wolverine is my favorite superhero and this is the best movie he's gotten since X2 and much better than his first solo film. It's been about 13 years since the first X-Men and Hugh Jackman looks better now than he did then. Other than being about a foot taller than Wolverine is supposed to be, I think he played the role flawlessly. The film does start to get a little cartoony toward the end, but it's a superhero movie so that's okay. All in all, The Wolverine is definately one of my favorite films of the year.",1394409600,,1039,4.328205128205128

3607093,4,B001GCUO16,"This was a pretty good movie. There were some pros and some cons though,

Pros:
Hugh Jackman draws you in with an awkward situation survival hunter situation. This gets the ball rolling and soon enough there's action and piecemeal action or dram from that point on. There are some less pronounced villains like Viper that make their silver screen debut and story is very innovative about Logan's history during the war and paralleling then to now. The right amount of twists and plot so that it's not all M. Night and also not all Gibson. Fight scenes were well done and slaughter as low enough that mature younger viewers or fans could still check it out(in my opinion).

Cons:
There were several pieces missing from the comic side of things. If you're looking the plot from the comics about a certain samurai then you might be a little disappointed, I know I was. Still the movie is pretty good. New story innovative design there are still samurai and Gokuda (Yakuza). The love interest is missing for me.",1394323200,,1007,4.68361581920904
3607094,3,B001GCUO16,"Not As Good As You'd Like sums it all up. Motorcycling in the snow covered streets to get to the mountain top where the least thought of person awaits him, his Japanese friend for the war, ready to kill him so he can live forever.

3607095,2,B001GCUO16,"I'll keep it short.  This review really only applies if you read the Xmen and Wolverine comics from circa 1995 and on, then you've come accustom to a certain storyline, character traits, back stories, etc.  If you are new to either Xmen or Wolverine, say in the past 10 years, then you probably couldn't care less about all of the strong character and story building from the mid 90's that I honestly feel brought both Xmen and Wolverine into the media mainstream as we know them today.  I'm not a heckler who really cares that the writers of this Wolverine movie and its predecessor took some liberties in Logan's past, but come on, bone claws?  Adamantium robot suits that can cut through other adamantium objects like they are hot butter?  Logan's mutant power of regrowth/regeneration somehow tied to his heart?  Where the hell are you getting this?  It not only destroys any previous back story of Wolverine, the concepts just don't make sense even if you hadn't read the comics.

The only reason it got two stars from me is that Hugh Jackman (albeit too tall) nails Wolverine in every movie.  The fight scene on top of the bullet train was one of the more intense scenes I've seen in a very long time.",1394236800,,1207,4.602803738317757

3607097,3,B001GCUO16,"The best part of this  movie was the scene that takes place during the credits and the fact that we get to see a lot of Hugh Jackman shirtless or in a tight undershirt.  Story was kind of lame.  Too much Ninja stuff.  Just didn't work for me.  I have to admit, I am not a reader of the comic books, so the Samurai aspect was lost on me.",1394150400,,336,3.8115942028985508

3607132,3,B001GCUO16,"After a disappointing Xmen Origins Movie, this is better but not great. The film does get in touch with the Wolverine character essence but it is nothing more than what you have seen in all of the other X men movies. We know he is tormented, he can't die, won't age, has little knowledge of his life, and likes to fight. So imagine any x men movie minus the other Xmen teammates. It is a character film, giving an expansion to Wolverine's ""new"" origins. It has a decent amount of action ( but if only more) and the images of Japan are a nice resemblance to the comicbook. It is long and the ending is choppy but everything else is good.",1394064000,4,636,4.264462809917355

His character in the other mediums is much more of a jerk than he's portrayed in this film series.  However, it's no surprise that I would enjoy this one more than the others since i'm a psychology major who focuses primarily on human behavior so glimpses into the past let you see far more into a person's behavioral patterns in the present.

And I am glad it continued from the last X-Men.  What bothered me about the movie was how the villian was taking wolverines healing.  I didn't like it.  Sorry but wolverines healing is more than his metal. These movies you learn he has lived a long time without the metal until he is given it.  To me it should have been more about cells or DNA.  Something like that. He seemed more animal like in the older movies.  Sniffing the air...being alert.  I liked that about Wolverine.  But it is definitely a movie to watch!! Action special effects and the continuation of the story!!  I watched it twice.,1393718400,,765,4.478260869565218

The plot was good and nothing at all like we'd expected from it.  The acting was good.  Plenty of action.  Good blend of drama and suspense with a light amount of comedy thrown in.  Don't care much for subtitles (when the actors are speaking in a foreign language), but that's only because I'm visually impaired and my husband has to read them to me, but that's just my own personal taste.

3607314,4,B001GCUO16,"Fans of the comic books involving the X-Men and in particular Wolverine were not quite happy with the first solo film involving the character. As a fan of both, I wasn't disappointed but the outcry when it was released garnered quite a bit of attention. Fortunately one group paying attention was the makers behind the new DVD release THE WOLVERINE. They've made a grittier and more true to the source film that makes up for those who were upset.

Fans were well acquainted with the characters of Yukio (Rila Fukushima) and Mariko (Tao Okamato). The first was an ally of Logan aka Wolverine (a returning Hugh Jackman) and the latter the love of his life in the comic books. Both were given plenty of time to be fleshed out in the comic series RONIN done by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller. Fortunately both are given the proper treatment here in this movie.

We start with Logan hallucinating following the last X-MEN film, still haunted by the death of Jean Grey. Logan is alone in the woods camping and drinking. A turn of events leads him to town and an encounter with Yukio. She tells him she is here to take him to meet her employer, Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi). In a short opening piece to the film we witnessed Logan save him while a prisoner of the Japanese during an atom bomb attack. Now Yashida is dying and wants to give a gift to Logan.

When he arrives in Japan, Logan eventually meets his old friend. Dying of old age and more, Yashida offers Logan a gift that he was never able to attain, the gift of death. If you've followed the films involving Logan you know that his main mutant ability is to regenerate his cells making him invincible and also unable to die. With his current state of mind this seems like a genuine gift. All Yashida needs to do is have his doctor use a new technique on Logan. They start but before all can go according to plans Yashida passes away, leaving behind not only Logan but his power hungry son Shingen, Shingen's daughter Mariko and a group of yakuza assassins intent on taking over his company.

During the funeral these yakuza assassins make an attempt on Mariko's life during which Logan is shot and realizes for the first time pain and the seriousness of wounds inflicted upon him. As the yakuza try to kidnap the young woman, Logan goes into full battle mode and rescues her. Included in this rescue is one of the most hair raising fight sequences atop a speed train that will leave your palms wet with sweat.

Logan and Mariko retreat to a small village where she feels safe, a secret hideaway. While there the two fall in love but Logan remains constantly vigilant for fear of harming Mariko. Their romance is cut short when the bad guys finally catch up to them taking Mariko with them and leaving Logan behind. With the help of Yukio, Logan begins putting together the pieces of the puzzle as to who is behind it all. At the same time he reverses the experiment done to him giving him the strength and resilience he needs to come to the rescue. Trust me when I say having Wolverine unhappy with you is not a pretty picture.

Battles with a band of master ninjas know as The Hand and a final confrontation with comic book character the Silver Samurai and this is bar none a movie that is filled with action. But that's not what makes it special. Along with all that action are a love story and the tale of a man trying to redeem himself for the sins of the past, a man who is not only a warrior but a man of honor, a ronin or samurai warrior with no master seeking retribution.

Each actor brings a seriousness to their character that one wouldn't expect from anyone portraying a comic book hero/heroine. They flesh out their performances to make them believable in the most unbelievable world you can imagine. Jackman was born to play this role and we can only hope another fantastic script will lead him into this role once again (other than the soon to be released X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST).

The action is well done, well filmed and helps to carry not just the film but the story as well as opposed to just being tossed in for the sake of action. And the story is perhaps the best thing found in this film. It isn't just men in tights flying across rooftops but a serious tale of Logan finding his path once more as well as the love of his life. Go into this one knowing ahead of time that their is more story than usual and you'll find a great movie this time around.",1393372800,,4430,4.426993865030675

The film itself begins really good and had some great action scenes (the train comes to mind), but the story become a love story when it shouldn't. A force romance between Logan and Mariko slows the movie down quite a bit. In the end, a entertaining action film, but not the definitive Wolverine movie we where hoping for after X-Men Origin: Wolverine, but definitely a big step in the right direction.

3607396,4,B001GCUO16,"Wolverine followed in Superman's footsteps last summer. Both characters had a disappointing solo outing a few years ago (X-Men Origins: Wolverine and Superman Returns) followed by a much better, though not great, film this past year. Superman's reboot left him a bit unsure of himself as a moral hero (not his usual Boy Scout self); Wolverine's new film drains out his healing factor (not his usual immortal self).

Wolverine's movie starts with his memories of World War II, specifically when he was in a prison camp just outside Nagasaki before the atomic bomb was dropped. He saved one of the Japanese soldiers who eventually became a highly successful businessman. In the modern day, the businessman sends one of his workers with a gift for Wolverine and a request to come say goodbye to his dying friend. The businessman can afford the best of care but he's an old man and doesn't have much longer to live. Unless, of course, he could get healing powers like Wolverine's...

The plot moves on from there in fairly predictable but not unenjoyable fashion. Almost every Japanese stereotype is in the film (seppuku, yakuza, bullet trains, martial arts, samurais, family honor, ninjas, etc. etc.--except I didn't see any sushi or Godzilla*). Logan's loss of healing is a little bit inconsistent but is a good way to make him vulnerable. Hugh Jackman gives a good performance as a tortured soul dealing with a tortured body. And fighting like a crazy, one-man army.

Like Man of Steel, The Wolverine is a big step in the right direction for the character and a lot better than I was expecting.",1393027200,2,1593,4.870848708487085

3607399,4,B001GCUO16,"Yes I know the story was forced. Yes I know it really didn't do much to further develop the character of Wolverine.  Yes I know the action scenes were over the top.

In ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", Wolverine lost his memory at Three Mile Island in March 1979. In ""The Wolverine"" Logan remembers WW2, in fact he remembers August 9 1945.

It had a lot to live up to so I can't give it 5 stars (it wasn't perfect) but it was a lot of fun with some great scenes. I might have given it 5 stars in the past but The Avengers has set a new standard for Marvel films.",1392249600,,391,3.9

3607736,3,B001GCUO16,Really not as good as the other Wolverine movies.  Way too much ninja fighting and not very believable at that.  Seemed to move very slowly in spite of the action.  Just really never made me care what happened to the people in it.,1392249600,,230,4.3023255813953485

He didn't let me down in The Wolverine at all. There was plenty of action, I liked the supporting cast and the storyline. I was involved and to me that is the what I look for in a story, involvement on my part.

Even though I'm partial to Hugh Jackman I still say the movie itself was enjoyable and exciting.",1392163200,,471,4.064516129032258

A young compassionate guard releases the POWs and the Wolverine.  After the atomic bomb is detonated and the guard is saved by Logan, he is amazed by his self-healing abilities.  The guard goes on to build a huge multi-national corporation and he is now dying.  He asks the Wolverine to come to Japan and say good bye.  However, the truth is that he wants much much more!",1392163200,,505,4.376344086021505
3607740,5,B001GCUO16,"Such a fun movie.  I watched it twice in one week.  It does a great job of integrating into the X-Men universe that is being created on screen (don't worry about exact correlation to the comics, it's close enough).  It sheds a little more light on Logan's history and also throws a new twist into the mix for what he has to deal with.  If you go into this expecting a very deep and philisophical movie, you're doing it wrong.  It definitely has character development, but it's still an action flick, and a great one. I'll be watching this a few more times.",1392163200,,556,4.359223300970874

Plot in this movie is little thin and the ending took me by surprise I thought the old man had died and steel robot guy was indeed a robot.  Blond snake lady did not add anything to the movie at all  & red head punk rocker ninja girl  could have been a little less punker rocker.

Also, according to Marvel, there is no more adamantium on Earth, so where did they get the thousands of pounds needed to build that retarded robot. Further, in the movie, Wolverine's adamantium claws are cut off, so does that mean we have seen the end of his razor claws and now he is back to the stupid bone claws? No, in the next movie they will magically reappear because that is how much Hollywood is sucking these days. Lastly, could the movie have spent any more time avoiding action scenes? Out of a 2 hour movie only the last 30 minutes has any action.  Wolverine is possibly the most popular X-Men character and the movie focuses on his ""feelings"", his dating a Japanese woman, and him being a pussy.

3608024,3,B001GCUO16,I got this for one of the children as a gift so I never really watched it until the missus rented a copy.  I was working on a project as she watched and every time I looked at the TV it seemed there was some fight going on.  Now I know it's an action movie but there are limits. Perhaps I'm soured on the genre,1391299200,,310,3.753846153846154
3608055,3,B001GCUO16,"Fox, if you're going to sell a Blu-Ray disc of the extended, unrated edition ""with digital copy""... <b>then give the unrated extended edition AS the digital copy, and make it the HD version on ALL services, not just the ones that support the UltraViolet standard.</b>

For the last couple of years, I haven't received or bought a Blu-Ray disc with digital copy where that digital copy wasn't in HD. DVDs would still give the standard-def version as the digital copy, but that makes sense at least -- a low-def original and low-def digital copy. I'd also always get the same version of the movie that I had on disc.

But not Fox and ""The Wolverine Unleashed Extended Edition"". Nope, they're only giving you the PG-13 version for the digital copy, even though iTunes has the unleashed version available. And even more stupid is that if you get the digital copy through iTunes, it's standard definition instead of HD. If you want an HD copy, Fox is forcing you to use Google Play or another service that supports UltraViolet, even though every other Blu-Ray I've bought that has a UV redemption page has never failed to take me to iTunes and still give me the HD copy for the download.

Why am on a tare about this? Because I buy the physical copy as a backup, and use the digital copy for primary (streaming) playback on my AppleTV or my iPad (depending on where I am). I don't have a Blu-Ray player for my Mac and I'm not about to go and buy one just to rip in one movie. Why the heck should I? What I buy is what I expect to get, for all advertised components.

Yes, this 4-disc set also comes with a copy of the PG-13 version, so in the strictest sense they're not doing something wrong. But how about this? Don't give me both versions on digital, I'm cool with that. But let ME choose which digital copy version I want, and make it the HD copy regardless of the service!

I've seen Jackman in some of his earlier musical activities and am still a little shocked when he becomes the Wolverine. Not a classic by any means but fun watching. Someday they may find a role for Ryan Reynolds that gets rid of the smirk.,1391299200,,307,4.4035087719298245
3608062,3,B001GCUO16,"This movie was not up to the level of the other X-Men movies. It was ok, but not great. I found the dream sequences with Jean Grey to be more distracting than really expository, and I never bought into the whole ""release me from my life"" thing that Logan was supposed to be feeling.

There were also some pretty silly tech parts... When Wolverine's Adamantium claws were cut off, he suddenly sprouted new bone claws? Really?

Having said that, the fight scenes were really amazing. The CG was *really* good, the bad guys were perfectly despicable, and the female protagonists were a lot of fun to watch.

It was a middle of the road flick. Enough good stuff to make it worth watching, but enough silliness to only give it three of five stars.",1391212800,,742,4.522388059701493

You'll have to watch it yourself to see what I am talking about.  That one scene really affected my whole perception of the movie.

3608188,5,B001GCUO16,"The entire X-Men series of movies should be seen...and this one in particular.  It seems so much better even though it's a prequel but, that may be attributed to the fact that they made the 1st X-Men movie like a decade (or longer) prior to this movies' release.  Also, they made the 1st movie and didn't release another for several years, same for the next, etc. and the capabilities of CGI rendering really came far in that time frame so, they just seem to get better and better as the series continues & I will definitely be seeing everyone of them in the theatre 1st, and then I will be buying the Blu-rays, etc.

The special effects are dazzling. For example, the scene where Wolverine was hit with multiple arrows is new to me.

This movie tries very hard to be deep by depicting Wolverine was tormented by his past actions. However, so little time was given to that subject that it became skin deep.

The twist in the last scene is interesting. I did not see it coming.

Production Budget: $120 million

Domestic:  $132,556,852
+ Foreign:  $282,271,394
= Worldwide:  $414,828,246

Steeped in Japanese culture, this movie feels more like a period piece/fantasy than a Wolverine superhero movie.  And the plot is fairly predictable.

I welcome all those characters because Wolverine has had to deal with many of them throughout his run.
Not that Hugh Jackman couldn't carry the title on his own but I have to balance the ratings on this scale.
I like his interactions with Sabretooth. The back story materialized pretty good.
I see why people thought it was a little on the cheesy side but it wasn't a complete let down when
I saw it in the theater. Could it been better?
Certainly.

3608324,4,B001GCUO16,"This above-par sequel finds our titular hero wandering alone, still haunted by the death of Jean Grey.  During a bar fight, he encounters a strange Japanese woman, who whisks Logan away to Tokyo.  There, he encounters a man whose life he saved in WWII.  The man, Yashida, offers a proposal: he will grant Logan mortality.  Except things kind of spiral out of control.  Now, almost mortal, Logan must race to save Yashida's daughter Mariko from the clutches of the Yakuza and an evil mutant.

The plot sounds vaguely ridiculous, doesn't it?  Even for a comic book film.  And yet, get this: the film's final half hour is the only reason I didn't give it five stars.  Because, as you can immediately tell with the stunningly beautiful opening scene, this is a comic book film of a different caliber.  In the hands of director James Mangold, and the obvious passion of star Hugh Jackman, we finally have the Wolverine film we deserve: a film about the character himself.  Jackman shines; you can tell he's thinking, ""Finally, a chance to actually act in this role, instead of go through the motions.""  The action sequences are present and reliably breath-taking; but they never feel over-the-top, until the end.  There isn't much about this movie that is ""cartoonish;"" the film is made with respect and grace, as opposed to an eye for Box Office grosses.  The focus is on character, on set up, on drawing out tension and not just having things explode.  And when things DO explode, it's with purpose.  (And, on a side note, how cool is it to finally see the Wolverine in some actual peril?  I mean, we all know he's going to make it, they wouldn't kill him off; but oh yes, he can and will hurt quite a bit.)

That said, the final thirty minutes feel like a typical comic book film, with Logan facing off against a towering adamantine...thing.  And the mutant Viper seems like a throw-off, ironically until the final act, when she becomes truly creepy and menacing (and, just, weird).  There are plot holes galore, and I'm still scratching my head about a few things.  But overall, this isn't your typical comic book film.  In fact, disregarding Nolan's DARK KNIGHT trilogy, I'd say this is the best comic book film since the first IRON MAN.  At times, it doesn't even feel like a ""comic book movie.""  If you like action films that focus on character development, that take their time and don't talk down to the audience, THE WOLVERINE is your film.",1390089600,4,2445,4.672131147540983

Pity poor Logan, aka The Wolverine, that immortal lycanthropic mutant with retractable adamantine claws played by that Jack-of-all-trades entertainer Hugh Jackman. All Logan wants is to be left alone to live as a hermit, spending his boundless days working as a logger, brooding over his condition and occasionally talking to the dead wife he accidentally killed who shows up occasionally to convince him to do away with himself and join her on the other side (apparently, she doesn't quite get this whole ""immortality"" thing).

But like Michael Corleone in ""Godfather III,"" every time Logan thinks he's out, someone pulls him back in. In ""The Wolverine,"" that person is a sword-wielding Japanese seer (Rila Fukushima) who convinces Logan to travel to Japan to say goodbye to the aged and dying Japanese prison guard whose life Logan saved during the bombing of Nagasaki. But things are never quite as simple as they seem in the movies, and soon Logan finds himself involved with the Yakuza, ninja warriors, the man's beautiful young granddaughter (Tao Okamoto) and some pretty messy intra-family politics.

Though it features some impressive sword fighting and some cool mano-a-mano fisticuffs atop a Japanese bullet-train, ""The Wolverine"" ultimately feels empty and half-hearted, a soulless exercise done in by longwinded speechifying and mediocre plotting.

3608462,5,B001GCUO16,"If you enjoy Hugh Jackman as Wolverine this is a no-brainer. I tend to judge this movies by their own right rather than how accurately they depict whatever book or comic they are based on, since I find such expectations to be unrealistic, unfair, and prone to disappointment. If you like Wolverine, ninjas, and samurais, this is it.

I will say, though, the ""Extended"" edition isn't worth the extra price in my opinion. I don't really care much for the scenes that were deleted from the theatrical version. For one, there was a scene that was unnecessarily violent and kinda corny, and on the other hand, Wolverine's blade-cutting isn't as violent as it ""should"" be. I'm not a fan of violence for violence's sake, but I do like a degree of realism when it comes to physics.",1389657600,,773,4.642335766423358

Action and movie good, but it is like you came in at the middle of a series so you are lost and don't know what is going on. And worst of all it ends. You are just left there guessing.

Watch the movie and you will hear it in context.  This sums up the folly of being human and the humanity that Wolverine deeply needs to provide him a sense of purpose in this lifetime.

Buy this movie and you will understand why writers are paid as well as they are to produce scripts.

Thus I'm glad I have this version. The extra scenes are enjoyable and there is some tiny minor differences from theatrical cut. Certain scenes are a bit bloodier, but mostly with the ninja fight in the 3rd act, but the operation scene is apparently ""bloodier"" but I couldn't honestly see the difference.

Or ""give me a break!""  I wasn't really happy with the acting from the women.  To me, it seems a bit ""amateur-ish.""  The scene with the ""silver samuri"" was really lame.  The very end during the credits got me looking forward to ""Days of Future Past!""  Maybe because this was a ""Stand alone,"" movie that made me dislike it.  My nephew was with me when we saw it, and on our way home, he said he liked ""the one where he was a lumberjack (x-men Origins).""  I did too!  Out of all of them, that was my favorite!  I bought this hoping if I saw it again, it would change my opinion.

3608674,4,B001GCUO16,"Wolverine is definitely my favorite marvel character. He was one of the first anti-heroes, and helped usher in the gray area in hero plot lines, where good and evil wasn't always so black and white. Having said that, I acknowledge the indisputable fact that he is, at times, overused, and that that overuse at times gets in the way of the development of some of the other great marvel characters that have been portrayed in film and in comics.

That being said, this is one of the more interesting takes on his character I've seen. The story deals with Logan coming to grips with his immortality and its implication, and an offer to finally be allowed to die. While it is a bit slow to start, the plot is decent, if imperfect, and the fight scenes are extremely well choreographed and intense without being too over-the-top. (Yes, I am aware that we're dealing with a character who can get stabbed in the heart with a large sword, pull it out of his chest, and then use it against his enemies without so much as flinching.) This film is of particular note because it neither overpowers nor under powers its protagonist.

This collection comes with an extended version, which I think is worth viewing - I even liked it a bit more than the theatrical cut. It IS worth noting, however, that the extended scenes add a noticeable amount of - dare I say it - sadistic blood, gore, and language. I would think twice before viewing the extended cut with your children.",1389312000,2,1460,4.568702290076335

The only reason that I even watched till the end of the movie is because I had high hopes that there would be some climatic ending, but it was a huge flop. The movie was a huge disappointment in all areas: from the graphics to the story line to the barely PG make out session (come on, we are all used to seeing Wolverine hot and heavy). I have no idea what they did to his character. This movie had so much potential to be amazing but they made him out to be a man who needs to be on anti-depressants and Viagra. The women in this movie seemed to fight more for him.

3608697,2,B001GCUO16,"acting was fine, I haven't followed the series, just recognized the actors faces so I would've preferred that the filmmakers established the main character for me better. indeed, would've preferred all the characters were more effectively established. the wolverine character didn't want to be where he was, and I wasn't attached firmly enough to the other characters to want him to stay to try and make sense of what was going on. just lots of fighting, shot in a comic book style, i.e., comic book framing. after wolverine uses his knives/weapons his character wasn't developed. he has his knives, he lives forever, and what else, I didn't really learn more about him. the flashbacks of a woman in his life who seemed more a foe than a friend didn't help the story in my opinion, and unless you'd seen the movie where I guess she dies, don't know what happened with her.  the return of the grandfather in the armor was a surprise and so works, and when wolverine was forced to have a bath, that was funny. other than that, not much for me to enjoy here. Hugh looks to be in great physical shape, but I guess he's supposed to be a wolverine? so his odd haircut and facial hair aren't flattering. The filmmakers also lowered his voice to the extent I noticed it. music cues were too much and too loud. didn't suck but I don't plan on watching it again. fanboys might like it. I'm middle age and female and don't know the story so this film didn't work for me. 2 and a half stars.",1389139200,,1479,4.477777777777778

1) Lil' Jimmy Wolverine is born in Canada around 1800-ish
2) He and his brother fight in just about every US war/police action from the Civil War to Vietnam.
3) At 3 Mile Island, he's shot in the brain and loses all his memories. It's total mutant amnesia.
4) He hooks up with Dr. X, gets into some adventures, falls in love,and yearns to rediscover who he is.
5) Still unable to recapture his lost memories, he walks away from his X-Men buddies and lives as a recluse in the woods of Canada.
6) He is approached by a young Japanese girl who requests that he return to Japan to say farewell to a dying, WWII Solder whose  life he saved.

Although he has no memories, prior to the bullet entering his brain, he somehow knows exactly who the guy is, and has full knowledge of their time spent together. Oopppsieee?",1389139200,,982,4.355191256830601

So each day I tried to watch this and I would watch a little repeat bit from the previous day (Since you can't jump to the exact spot where you stopped on scene selection), then I started to notice something annoying. All the Japanese people spoke like fortune cookies. It started to get annoying. Spoiler Alert; In the beginning when the Japanese soldiers commit suicide, at first that was kind of cool I guess, then when I watched that scene 3 times, I started to realized, these were the suicide bombers of yesterday. I wondered if in 60 years the suicide bombers of the middle east will be shown as honorable men willing to die for their country in movies? Kamikaze pilots who ram their planes into their enemy or commit suicide on the realization they are defeated. Anyways, then I started to notice, the Asians were all speaking like fortune cookies. I am a Japanezea,You do not a understand a. I must obey my father a. Maybe if this was a period piece and we were in 16th century Japan, this might make sense, but to have all the Japanese people speak this way in 2013 is weird. It would be like having all the Americans speak like pirates for no reason in a non-pirate movie from 2013.  Arr Matey, you Land lover. What if wolverine spoke that way throughout the whole movie. Anyways the storyline sucks either way. Multiple things are happening, One you have a Japanese man that this Japanese woman is supposed to marry (who is a bad guy) then you have a another Japanese man who is in Love with this same girl and protects her from afar. Then you have wolverine who just met her and is like her body guard. And of course wolverine who just met her sleeps with her. You kind of feel bad for the Japanese guy on the roof top who like a ninja protects her from afar, only to have wolverine sleep with her. (That was kind of a side story with no point), then you get to the main plot with the Japanese girls father who wants to steal wolverines powers.

The downside is that Wolverine was losing his powers through most of the movie.  It was like watching Lex Luthor kick Superman's butt for an hour while holding a piece of kryptonite.  It got very old, very quickly because the main appeal of a mutant/superhero is his superhuman abilities.  Wolverine was pretty much slightly above average for most of the movie.

Finally saw this film and I have to say that this was a major disappointment. Despite my misgivings about the X-films, I always thought that Jackman as Wolverine was a bold, risky and ultimately successful decision. In The Wolverine though, Jackman has disappointed me with a performance that seems very going-through-the-motions and borderline wooden.

Story-wise and suspension-of-disbelief-wise this film was a huge fail through and through. Viper was just an obnoxious addition to the mutant-verse and it was just a failed experiment overall. I sincerely hope that they never refer to her again in any future X-films. The way they ""eliminated"" Wolverine's healing powers were idiotic as well. They came up with a Deus Ex Machina back in The Last Stand already and they could have just used a variation on that instead of going to such idiotic lengths to create this idiotic MacGuffin where Wolverine has to make it to this remote factory which turns out to be some dumb trap.

I mean, you already lured him to freaking Japan and could have brought him anywhere. Why did we have the first hour of this film if this is your endgame anyway? Just bring him to where you wanted in the first place. You already got his trust you dummies.

Also adamantium can slice through trains but can't cut through regular swords? Dumb.

The story line was terrible (and un-Wolverine-like) and it's very unclear how this fits in with the other X-men/Wolverine movies (if at all).  The Jean Grey dream sequences are weak and pedestrian.  I can only assume that people giving this good reviews associate it with the previous films.

The Wolverine definitely rides the wave of the X-men movies that came before it and uses them to cover-up how inferior a movie this actually is.",1388966400,10,535,4.835164835164835

3608921,2,B001GCUO16,The writers must not check their own work. Besides being dull this movie is wrong. Logan didn't call himself Wolverine till the late 1900s when he got the Admantium how ever that is spelled. Before his surgury he said he wanted New dog tags. Guess they missed that detail. He might have had a crush on Jean or guilt for killing her but that was just dumb. Hope they stop now.,1388966400,,375,4.295774647887324

3608925,3,B001GCUO16,"I enjoy Hugh Jackman's acting, and was excited to see this movie. I was very disappointed for the money I paid. Just not worth it! I'd say it's worth $1.50 on Redbox.

Hugh Jackman's acting was good as always, and some of the action is good, which is why I gave it even 3 stars. But they just weren't enough to carry this movie. The plot, the characters, the lines, the pacing, all just were dull, implausible, and bad. What's frustrating is that some of the secondary characters' acting seems good, but you can't really tell with the boring and occasionally laughable dialogue.

You can see the outlines of a good movie here. Wolverine's powers, backstory, and situation make him an ideal character through which to explore immortality, gratitude, altruism, and grief. The opening sequence is tense, scary, touching, and hints at these themes. But then any intelligence or nuance is smothered by one-note, undeveloped characters that are hard to feel anything for, good or bad; unrelenting stereotypes about Japanese culture (where the women are passive; Ninjas hang around everywhere, everyone is a martial arts expert; every house has paper screens); a  chemistry-less romance (Yukio was a much more interesting female character); overlong action and violence sequences for their own sake; silly villains with no apparent motives; and huge plot holes (for example, exactly why was the whole funeral/will thing even in there? why not just take what he wanted from Wolverine to begin with if the technology was available? why did Harada suddenly change his viewpoint, and how did Viper get him to go along with this stupid plan? why does Wolverine even stay in Japan more than 1 day, and what makes him suddenly risk everything for Mariko?) Basically, the plot hinges on us caring whether (a) Mariko, the main female charater, lives or dies and she's so vanilla and helpless that you can't and (b) caring that the rightful person ends up heading up the company. You can see that one or more writers/directors/producers cared about this film. But somewhere along the way it got butchered.",1388880000,,2088,4.977077363896848
3608926,3,B001GCUO16,Said it all in the title. very entertaining though frustrating at times due to lack of realism and lack of authenticity but I watched the whole thing and was captivated.  great way to kill 2 hours but not worth owning.,1388880000,,218,4.45
3608927,2,B001GCUO16,Overall a terrible movie with a story line someone in junior high could have created. Everything surrounding this story is nonsensical and it seems like the writers just backed into every plot line. The action sequences are good and on a nice TV with a  good surround system it will make a mindless movie watching experience.,1388880000,,325,4.803571428571429

3608929,3,B001GCUO16,I will say its worth seeing if you are an X-Men fan.  Storyline and plot was good.  Beginning was a little slow for me.  But it left you wondering what's next in the X-Men franchise.  Watch through the ending credits...you'll see what I mean.,1388880000,2,242,4.431818181818182
3608969,4,B001GCUO16,"The movie as usual showed Wolverine in his best ability and wild action. I find it a mix of action and romance, which has been a theme in all Wolverine movies.

This one just seems a bit of a stretch for a story, it's almost as if the director/producer REALLY just wanted to make a sequel with a Japanese flair.  You know, sharp blades, martial arts and he falls in love with the Japanese princess and saves the day.
It was ""good"", but not great.",1388880000,,374,4.194444444444445

3608972,4,B001GCUO16,"Seems to pick up where XMen 3 left off.  Interesting storyline.  Trailer doesn't give a clear picture of the movie content so if you haven't read anything about the movie you won't know what it is about from just watching the trailer (not a bad thing, just an observation).  Storyline provides more background on Wolverine character and additional development.  Jackman owns the character so no dissapointment there.

If you enjoy superhero genre you will like this movie - I think I liked Wolverine Origins better (because it answered a lot of questions about how he came to be and included other superheroes/supervillians).  But this movie is a good continuation of the character for upcoming movies (I hope!).

If you are a casual viewer of superhero genre, this may not be for you because it has a lot of unknown actors/actresses (although they performed well) and doesn't include other superheroes/supervillians with interesting personalities/characterstics from which to play off.",1388880000,2,986,5.24203821656051

3608975,2,B001GCUO16,"Despite some dream sequences referencing the first 3 Xmen films and a fantastic after-credits sequence, this film just seems unnecessary. It's not really bad.  It's just there.  A proper Xmen 4 or First Class sequel leading to Days of Future Past would have been a better lead-in.  Given Wolverine's agelessness, a standalone film set further in the future might have been nice, and would have been an amazing DOFP lead-in.  This whole film felt lazy and uninspired.  Oh well... here's to hoping Days of Future Past is good.",1388880000,,524,4.909090909090909

That being said though, Wolverine will not will in the cohesive storytelling department.  Lady Viper is lame, I'd have rather seen the ninjas fight Wolverine at full strength and seen him challenged by their skills - the very art of ninja that this jumbled chaotic mess. It was a real disappointment whose so redeeming feature was that it finally ripped away at the fabric of time at the end.",1388793600,,537,4.59375

3608993,5,B001GCUO16,"I would recommend this movie to 13 and older. I feel that the cultural aspect, plot twists, and Thor like qualities (infatuation) would satisfy anyone that feels like they are being forced to watch it. (gf/bf that isn't into super hero's). I'd give origins a 3, and would have rather seen this movie first, and than Origins second.

I feel that the director chose camera angles, sound design, music, action and storyline well. Wolverine complemented the Japanese high context culture style, while informing the audience of their values in traditional culture with his inability to adapt to a country where rules are known and not written out. The balance between PG13 and R theme was well done. The movie direction was long enough to provide a good story without being too short or long.

After reading reviews of the extended blue-ray I wish I would have saw that version (extra 15 min), because I would have liked to see some arms and legs come off, but the fight scenes and depth of characters satisfied enough that I'll watch that later.",1388793600,,1041,4.777777777777778

3609092,5,B001GCUO16,"As someone who grew up loving Wolverine and collecting all the comic books that he appeared in...it was a terrific treat to see this movie.  Anyone who collected Wolverine comics back in the day knows about his ties to Japan and here they finally touched upon that connection.  This was SO much better than the Origins story they tried to tell, which fell flat and really really did not capture Wolverine.  I didn't believe that storyline for a minute, but this...THIS...is Wolverine.

The locations in Japan were great, the action was wonderful (if a bit bloody at times, but heck this is Wolverine we're talking about), and Jackman still looks as hot as ever.  Honestly, I could not see anyone else ever playing this character he has so taken it for his own.

Some spoilers below:

At the start of the movie, we get a flash back (literally in a way) to WW2 and how Wolverine saves a Japanese guard from the atomic bomb blast.  Back in the present day, Wolverine is holed up in a cave, keeping to himself, terribly hurt and lost after the death of Jean (the Phoenix) and the part he played in that.  He is haunted by visions of Jean and really doesn't seem to care anymore, not about anyone or anything.  He goes into town after some hunters and meets a Japanese girl who tells him the man he once saved is dying and wants to tell him good-bye.  Of course, we all know that isn't just what's going on...

Turns out the man he saved is now head of a huge, powerful corporation and wants to make Wolverine a deal.  He wants Logan's power to heal and, in exchange, he will give him what he wants...the ability to die.  Wolverine is also introduced to the man's granddaughter, who he ends up saving after Logan refuses and her grandfather dies.  Once again, Logan is in his natural role as a soldier and protector.  But, this time, he is wounded both in mind and body, as his vaunted healing suddenly seems to be leaving him.  This is a vulnerable Wolverine, the one we always knew was inside the man of adamantium.

There are some great samurai fight sequences in this movie and a wild ride/fight on the top of a bullet train.  The locations are fascinating and even funny, as they hole up in a cheezy motel where rooms are rented by the hour.  The definite star of the show remains, of course, Wolverine.  Will he overcome his guilt and longing to die?  Will he no longer be a ronin, a samurai with no master, but re-find himself and what he lives for?

As ever, watch through the end credits for a hint of movies yet to come...I can't wait!",1388707200,4,2540,4.41505376344086

Why is he not his mutant self  super swording things in half? Was a guy who could cut through anything in the world not cool enough. Worst of all in the movie isn't that the silver samurai doesn't have his mutant powers its that everyone else did apparently have them. Right look swords don't cut wood, glass, metal, brick lmao well at all . Pretty much Bone and flesh. Hollywood listening here bone and flesh that is  what swords cut beyond practice targets that are meant to mimic whats that class right bone and flesh. Also the repeated saying of  ""A Japanese sword requires two hands"" made me sad.  Musashi did you know that you were doing it wrong i'm sure those guys in ye old japan want a redo. I didn't mention the story ...... right copy 1992 anime b list and paste :) zero stars isn't a option never knew that till this movie.",1388707200,2,979,4.362637362637362
3609158,1,B001GCUO16,"This is the worst Xmen movie so far!  I've been a big fan of the Xmen movies, and greatly enjoyed the first three.  Xmen Origins and First Class weren't quite as good, after the first three Xmen movies, the series started going downhill.  I was really looking forward to this movie coming out, and couldn't wait to see it in 3D.  There aren't too many 3D movies on the market which are not kids movies, so I looked forward to expanding my 3D collection.  However after watch this movie, I'm going to IMMEDIATELY sell it!

This movie was completely flawed; Wolverine's character didn't care strongly for ""homosapians"", just mutants.  His character certainly wouldn't have gone to Japan just to say goodbye to a Japanese man he saved.  Even going to a non-mutant's funeral in the U.S. is a stretch, no less an entire country away and then stay there after the funeral to randomly protect that man's granddaughter.  I really don't know what the producers were thinking, they developed his demeanor to be non-caring of others; and developed his past in Xmen Origins and First Class to further instill in the audience that after all he has been through, he will only look out for himself.  This movie defamed a great series that had a lot of potential.

After the first three movies, the Xmen series had a promising future and the ending of Xmen: the Last Stand foreshadowed what's to come, or what should have came.  Instead the producers took the series in a different direction and decided to make the series turn into a prequel.  These movies were long, drawn out and slow, which I found hard to watch as the story was being told at a painfully slow rate.  However Origins and First Class still gave a good background to the series and explained more about the characters, a mistake that made this movie a red flag, something that Wolverine would never do.

I was surprised to find that the entire movie took place in Japan and that none of the characters from the previous Xmen movies were in it.  Instead this movie consisted of a random assortment of Japanese characters.  This movie was painfully slow to watch as the entire movie was drawn out way too much, made no sense, did not follow the series at all and gave no insight into the Xmen characters as the two prior Xmen movies did.  This movie was completely random and is a spin off of the original Xmen movies; I have no clue what the producers where thinking when they made this movie.  If their goal was to turn the Xmen series into a Japanese cartoon, well then, it was a success.  It's unfortunate that I can not return this movie now that I opened and realized it, instead I will have to sell it used and take a loss.  Save your money, don't make the same mistake I did and buy it!",1388620800,5,2745,4.505050505050505

3609191,2,B001GCUO16,"If you're a fan of the first two X-Men movies then I suggest not watching this film. This movie is very weak in comparison. The story and script are poor. The action sequences are short, predictable and lacking comic book style imagination.

3609195,5,B001GCUO16,"Full disclosure I read/collected the X-men/Wolverine/related series comics for the better part of 30 years.  Wolverine has always been one of my favorites.

Comics stepping to the big screen always run into a couple of problems.  For loyal readers being true to the original stories and on the flip side engaging the non-reader who doesn't know the characters story.  They've done a good job of engaging both.  Is the back story dead on with the original storyline?  I don't think so, but the story is close enough that it incorporates some of the major themes that make Logan who he is.  For the non comic geek, it answers several questions about Logan's mysterious past.  And of course Hugh Jackman's acting and buff physique doesn't hurt either.",1388620800,5,748,4.880952380952381

The plot is thin, the acting is lousy (sorry, Hugh- you're still one of my favorites, but this was not your best moment), and the effects were cheesy. If you were looking for an X-Men level ""A"" film, then look elsewhere because this is a ""B"" movie at best. They must have blew their budget paying Hugh Jackman and no budget for anything else. I am sadly disappointed as I expected a little more than lousy.",1388620800,6,455,4.364705882352941

This movie is definitely a departure (and in the wrong direction) from the other X-Men films, and lacked all of the elements I enjoyed about the series.  I will be hesitant to watch anything else on the Wolverine story again after this.

But just like the first Wolverine movie, they butcher the story by trying to blend in parts from other stories. The fight between Wolverine and The Hand sucks, the writers didn't include Wolverine's berserker rage in the fight. The Silver Samurai sucks too. If you're a die hard Wolverine fan this movie will just kind of suck to you instead of totally sucking like the first one did.",1388534400,,535,4.583333333333333

3609271,4,B001GCUO16,"The Wolverine continues the story of Logan when he is summoned to Japan by an old acquaintance and ends up embroiled in a conflict that forces him to confront his own past.

This movie brings more into focus the complexities of mind of wolverine where he deals with the benefits and detriments of his immortality versus the choice of being able to be mortal and end his existence in addition to dealing with a possible new love versus the loss of an old one and the choice of whether he wants to be what he was destined or abandon and run from that forever.  It creates some complexities in the storyline and allows for the telling of a background past tale that allows for all the current action to take place.  In addition to a good, if not a bit flawed sometimes, storyline there are great action sequences set in various beautiful spots in Japan with some good costume design and interesting characters.  The one knock that I have with the characters is that the villians themselves are decidedly weak and the action sequences with the main bad guys seems a bit short lived toward the end.  Not to say that this movie is short as it clocks at over 2 hours but it seems that the climatic fighting scene toward the end could have been a bit more of a challenge for Wolverine.

Overall though this is a solid action flick for fans like me of the X-men series.  It is worth a watch and entertaining throughout.",1388534400,6,1410,4.441860465116279

Half the time they didn't even bother to show him with his claws out during the action sequences! Maybe they ran out of money or something, idk. The amount of ""blood and gore"" was pitiful, which isn't a bad thing, I liked all the previous X-Men movies and there wasn't blood and gore, but it seemed to me like they were trying to make it messy but forgot to add the blood.

The villians were bad, the love story was bad, the action was bad, the effects were bad, beginning was slow, and the ending was terrible. They added ninjas, which will make any movie better, but even NINJAS couldn't make this movie enjoyable for me. It was just a bad movie and I was very disappointed.

3609318,3,B001GCUO16,"Movie:
This movie explain Logan's origin from the moment he realises that he is a mutant, his falling out with Sabretooth and Stryker, what inspired him to use the nickname ""Wolverine"", the manner he got the ademantium claws & coating/shielding on his bones and how he lost his memories. The ""story telling"" seemed quite rushed to explain all this to the point that some scenes looked like a documentary rather than a movie.

Disc 1: Blu-ray Version
PQ is suprisingly not that good here. It's grainy at beginning parts of the movie. Most of the scenes with the ademantium looks very ""graphicy"" and fake. The 2 hours plus worth of Special Features are quite interesting. i.e: the alternate ending would have been a nice prelude to ""The Wolverine"" movie

3609336,2,B001GCUO16,"Way over-hyped movie that ultimately disappoints.  Don't get me wrong, Jackman is dead on with his portrayal and has delivered a pitch perfect performance.  He does an awesome job, which is why the movie gets 2 stars instead of only one star.  The fight sequences are phenomenal, the scenery and cinematography is amazing, and the movie has great pacing, and he is in eye-popping shape, but...

The ending is very disappointing.  You get a finale a la Iron Man where our hero fights a bad guy in a suit of power armor.  (This is the third movie in the Marvel movie universe where this happens: Iron Man, Iron Man 2, and The Wolverine.  Four movies if you count the ending to the first Fantastic Four movie where Dr. Doom is the villain).  This type of ending has become a clich, and it's a shame it was cut-and-pasted into the ending of The Wolverine considering the potential that this movie had.

The other great disappointment is the huge plot hole involving the character of The Viper.  She poisons and weakens Logan.  So, after she weakens him, why not poison him to weaken him further, club him or poison him into unconsciousness and do what you need to do?

Oh, wait, that's a much shorter movie.

All in all, enjoyable to watch the fights, beautiful scenes, stupid plot with too many holes in it.  I know it's a superhero film, but internal consistency would be nice, and a plot that's at least plausible.

It is Logan's humanity that's battled over rather than some world-conquering mutant's attempt to vanquish his opponents. Unfortunately, it's in the third act when this much more interesting tale is abandoned for a silly comic book ending is thrown together in a very unsatisfactory manner.

If the character Viper was not in this film, and the final battle was not so zany this would have been my favorite out of all the FOX X-men films.

3609519,4,B001GCUO16,"Iron-man has been knocked about a lot, his suit has been destroyed and his life nearly taken. BUT...he is never out of the fight for any length of time, and his ability to be an iron-suited hero is never challenged. Wolverine was a warrior I could watch lay waste to armies of bad guys and never flinch. THEN...he is shot, knifed, beat up, deprived of his claws, and in love, with two women yet! Bad guys generally get one crack at eliminating the hero, but in this movie they are constantly knocking the crap out of the X-men's coolest member. Why? Because Wolverine, for all his strutting, and for all his bad-ass clawing, is still a man who is susceptible to the same failings as all men - his love of a woman gets in the way of his common sense and natural intuitive ability to see a train is really behind the bright light coming down the tracks! Hugh Jackman is great though, really, No matter which gender, no one could look at this man without a shirt on and complain. Even the wounds look good on this guy, and there are plenty of those, trust me. The science behind the Wolverine has been explained in X-men and previous Wolverine sagas, so it doesn't really play a part in the film, though one bad guy wants his secret and is willing to kill him to get it. But, hey, what else would a truly bad, once saved by the hero - now dying, guy do if not try for immortality. I love movies that put an immortal hero into the role of the mortal man, with the weaknesses of one as well - otherwise, let's face it, the movie, (or book), would be boring to a fault! One star off because I really feel that Wolverine was too battered during the entire movie, despite the reason for not being able to heal instantly now and again. My problem, or that of the movie world in general, is that once a god is made mortal, why is still impossible to kill him? or her? We mortals drop like flies but the once immortal seem impervious to death even though there is no longer a ""trick"" to their continued existence. Admantium anyone?

Just saying, without spoiling didn't like that. that just didn't play out unless you are going to have another wolverine movie before days of future past goes. which I don't think is going to happen. Painted corner for you guys.
I love wolverine. Long before he became such a massive money maker for marvel He was my favorite character. To their credit Fox scored a major score with Hugh Jackman. Though taller than the little runt he makes a good logan. This story explores several storylines from Uncanny Xmen 170-174, wolverine limited series, and a lot of what was at the time hints of Logan past over the span of 20 years in comics, introduces a bit of a spin and except for the conclusion of the story which I thought was kind of sad really.

3609556,4,B001GCUO16,"I'm somewhat critical of comic book characters going to the big screen.  In my opinion, most books and almost every video game story/characters are not translated well into movies.  I could go on all day, but on to my thoughts for this movie.

Forget what I just said above----The Wolverine doesn't apply.  Finally, a dramatic approach to a complex character without 30 kabillion different kinds of mutants, high dollar gratuitous special effects every second of the film, and an overblown quacky screenplay that just plain sucks.

In the X-Men franchise (along with the previous Wolverine movie) we always see a polished, and hard to sell fantasy we all wish could be ""for real"" just for the 2 hours it takes to watch.  But, for me, any realism was never there.  That said, I'm a fan of the series nonetheless.  A diehard fan that goes back some 35 years to my days as a kid blowing his allowance on comic books.

This latest installment shows a real departure from the previous X-Men movie formula, and brings the Wolverine character down to ground level along with the rest of us mere mortals.  I thought there was some great dramatic content, or at least a great approach to the film.  A good storyline with a tempured hand on inflated FX.

3609590,2,B001GCUO16,"First off, I've been a Wolverine fan since I was a kid.  I have the original comic book that introduced him.  For the newbs that don't know, Wolverine was introduced in a Hulk comic...

I have a pretty good grasp of comic book physics due to my +4 Ph. D. in Marvel Comic Book Studies from the Reed Richards University of the Universe.  Yes, the University is accredited by Northwestern and by the Celestials.

Now this movie...

This movie wasn't very good.  There was too much Hollywood crap put into the mix for me to properly enjoy the story.  I'm going to rant about the bad stuff and then end with some good stuff, so that I don't come off as all negative (proximal distal stuff...)

Rant:
1. Adamantium cannot be cut, or damaged, or anything.  Once it sets, it's indestructible.  Cutting Wolverine's claws with an adamantium sword is not possible.  It would be just as possible to use the adamantium sword and cut a black hole in half (ie. not possible (at all (even in comic physics(trust me, I know(check out my +4 degree))))).
2. Mutant power draining with a heart worm?  Are you F-ing serious?  This is not the Matrix...
3. Battle outside of a bullet train scene.  Complete crap.
4. The Kendo scene with Mariko's dad.  That is not Kendo.  Stop it.  Stop using traditional Kendo armor for your Hollywood M.A..  You're insulting all the Kendoists of the world.
5. **Not Really A Rant** I'd like to point out that Mariko is that Deathstrike chick in the other movie... Say whaaaaa???
6. The Ninja painting...  First, if it's a family heir loom, don't stick a knife in it.  Second, Ninja aren't honorable, they never were.  You don't get a Katana and Wakizashi for being a Ninja.  You get one as a Samurai.  Now if you kill a Samurai and then take his weapon, that's cool (if you're a Ninja), but that wasn't what was depicted in the movie.
6. Wolverine didn't kill daddy yashida with his middle claw.  You know the story...  (If not, go out and get it)
7. A marrow transplant will grant you mutant powers...  I know... Billshut... My +4 degree hates bone marrow infused mutant powers.
8. If those guys are going to die in a week, why not let them die (immediately) by the claw...  You know... Nature's justice...  Plus you don't know if they're going to cause any more mischief.
9. When you go to kill the Wolverine with a Katana and you're standing next to him (BTW at this point, he has no regeneration powers).  It'll only take a fraction of a second.  Don't mess around with a little Japanese girl that is 12 feet away from you.  Slash to your left to kill Wolverine, then finish off the girl...  Get it? Got it? Good...
10. Stop cutting adamantium, it's ""unpossible""...
11. Bodyguard?  The real Wolverine would kill her for suggesting that he needed protection.
12. What's-her-face tells Wolverine that the Japanese mob is called the Yakuza and then he miraculously knows that these guys have body tattoos.  He probably received divine knowledge of missing digits too, but that couldn't be portrayed in the movie.
13. Crying...  Sob... ""I couldn't foresee his death.""  Yup, that should have been the only clue you needed.  It's all I needed.
14. Two handed power-up?  Are you serious?  At least make Wolverine eat a mushroom or star before powering him up.

Rave:
1. Hugh Jackman is the perfect guy to play Wolverine.  Not only can the gentleman act, he looks like the character (except for Wolverine's height).

In this movie, Logan is summoned to Japan and offered what he may have longed for.  True mortality.  Okay, pros and cons, pros and cons, until the true motivation comes forth.

This one surprised me. Not like any other marvel or  ""X-men"" title, though it pays homage to the events in X-men through a major a plot device. Also stick around until post credits for a teaser scene that paves the way for the new X-men movie.

Hugh Jackman reprises his role from previous films as the title character, with James Mangold directing a screenplay written by Scott Frank and Mark Bomback, with uncredited parts by Christopher McQuarrie, based on the 1982 limited series Wolverine by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller. In the film, which follows the events of X-Men: The Last Stand, Logan travels to Japan, where he engages an old acquaintance in a struggle that has lasting consequences. Stripped of his immortality, Wolverine must battle deadly samurai as well as his inner demons.

This extended version adds an extra 12 minutes to the movie and features an Alternate Ending to the film and an Audio Commentary track. I really enjoyed this movie and would definitely recommend it.

3609611,1,B001GCUO16,"Yes, I know this is a comic book movie.  However, I expected at least something along the lines of the X-men movies.  This one does not measure up.
First of all, this is a Japanese movie.  Except for the good mutant, Wolverine, and the evil mutant, Viper, all of the other characters are Japanese and all the action takes place in Japan.
Although there is some action, it is a typical Japanese film with overacting and giant robots.  I'm surprised it wasn't done as an animated film.
However, I must admit this movie lost me in the first scene.  As anyone who knows anything about World War II, American POWS were treated horribly, usually starved and often tortured to death.  When Japanese troops pulled back, they tended to execute all their prisoners(See the movie ""The Great Raid"" if you can't be bothered to read a book.).  There were standing orders that if the Japanese home islands were invaded, every POW in the country was to be put to death. Yet, in the opening scene of this movie, an airraid  is in progress.  Of course, there is no way the Japanese could have known it was an atomic attack.  The compassionate Japanese guards(all four of them) release all the American POWs so they won't be hurt and then commit ritual suicide.  This is revisionist history at its worst.  After that, it would have had to be a great movie to make me like it and this certainly was not a great movie.",1387756800,3,1397,4.52191235059761

3609625,4,B001GCUO16,"Movie:
An entertaining movie focusing on what happend to Wolverine post ""X-Men: The Last Stand"", based on the Wolverine's adventure in Japan as in the comic books. Now, my comments on this blu-ray disc set

3D Blu-ray Disc Version:
No specific ""pop-out"" scene to shout about. Infact nothing much to shout about on the 3D version of this film. Basically, watching it in the 2D version would've been good enough. The PQ n' AQ is quite good here.

Theatrical Blu-ray Disc Version:
The PQ n' AQ is also quite good here. The Extras are in this disc which only offers the most basic background info on the movie, which I managed to cover in less than an hour.

Unleashed Extended Edition Blu-ray Disc Version:
Extra 6 minutes (compared to the theatrical version) of blood, gore, cursed words n' interaction between Wolverine with Yashida, Yukio n' Mariko. It's basically 6 minutes of only entertainment but wouldn't affect the movie if it were not included in the first place. The PQ n' AQ is again quite good here.

DVD n' Digital Copy:
Good enough PQ n' AQ for a DVD copy. Haven't tried downloading the Digital Copy yet. Probably downloadable for those that are residing in the U.S. only.

Final verdict, unless if you are a hardcore fan of X-Men and Wolverine, the 2 disc set version would suffice.",1387584000,,1295,4.687224669603524

3609632,3,B001GCUO16,"Hugh Jackman really is a great Wolverine, and he's all that really keeps this movie afloat. In this flick there's just too much missing (like the other popular mutants) to consider this one of the awesomely entertaining X-Men movies. This would just be just...well...a fair at best X-Men movie, or perhaps 'story arc' would be a better way to describe it.

The Wolverine heads to Japan and meets up with an old ""friend"" who promises Logan a normal life, and in return Logan would need to give up...let's just say ""a lot"" for the sake of avoiding spoilers. He squares off against a few ninjas, a pretty rad snake lady (Viper), and he is joined by a cast of no-names in a story that's almost as clich as it is contrived.

The best few minutes of the movie comes shortly into the ending credits in one of those teaser scenes for X-Men: Days of Future Past that comes out in 2014. So if you need an X-Men fix now...go ahead and give The Wolverine a rent; otherwise--in my humble opinion--you might do just as well to wait for X-Men: Days of Future Past.",1387497600,2,1049,4.430051813471502

I enjoyed this movie until the final 15 mins or so.  I am huge Wolverine fan and comic nerd so I am a bit biased.  First, Wolverine would not just storming into a Ninja village.  He is a predator and would sneak in and take them out.  Eventually get in a huge brawl.  The Silver Samurai at the end????? In the comics he is Mariko's sister and isn't some Pacific Rim type cyber armor.  Did not have an adamantium sword either.  There is a point in the comics where Wolverine gets his Adamanitum ripped out of his body by Magneto...long story.  But to cuts claws off to drill into his bone marrow....c'mon.  Apocalypse puts the Adamantium back in his body... so maybe in the movie after Days of Future Past where they say Apocalypse will be the villain , They will put the claws back in the adamanitum.",1387497600,,815,4.373333333333333

Unlike many movies nowadays, I did not feel like the writers/producers/directors became bored halfway through the production of it and just rushed through to the end.  It gave a deeper look into the life struggle of Logan.  And as someone who loves martial arts I LOVED seeing the amazing stunts - especially with Rila Fukushima, she is fun to watch!

This was an action packed movie, with some exciting scenes, BUT as a big fan of X-men I have some major beef with this film. My biggest problem with it is:

When Wolverine gets his claws chopped off it makes no sense. So yeah they were chopped off by a hot adamanitum blade. This should have never happened because A. According to X-2; once adamantium sets (into solid form, from liquid) it can never be destroyed NOT EVEN BY OTHER ADAMANTIUM, yet his claws seem to come right off. B. In X-2 supposedly the adamantium used on the girl with the claws (when wolverine injected her with liquid adamantium) was the last amount of adamntium in existence, yet they have enough to make a giant adamantium samurai???  My other problem with the movie is it doesn't make sense how he was able to take logan's healing power through his claws... this is ridiculous. If you had a healing power it would be in your DNA, everywhere, not just in your claws, and even if someone could take your healing power, it wouldn't take it away from you, it would only replicate it. I thought this movie was a bit a stretch, and to be honest, they have made way to much about wolverine. They need to make more stand alone movies about some of the other X-men.",1387238400,2,1264,4.463203463203463

Wanted to, but because I really don't like Wolverine in the first place, (with his attitude who can) I went into this movie with a negative outlook from the get-go. My outlook didn't improve at all as the movie progressed. Here we have our hero, a mutant that can heal virtually any wound he suffers. And he can pop out a set of claws from his fists. Um, sorry but neither of those abilities impress me at all, not when looking at some of the other mutants out there.

 Now we have our nemesis. She's not even Japanese, which should've been the case since the movie was set in Japan! On top of that, there wasn't one single Japanese mutant in the whole movie!!! WTH!?

Thankfully, this film breaks the cycle.

The ""theatrical"" cut I would rate between 3 and 3.5 stars - it was solid, but kind of stumbled near the end.  The ""extended"" or ""director's cut"" I would give a solid 4 or even a 4.5 rating - the missing 12 minutes *DO* make a difference and make this movie a slam-dunk - this is the Wolverine/X-Men film that I have been waiting 35-years for.  The deleted scenes add more character to Mariko and Yukio, and the extended ninja fight at the end makes a HUGE difference in action pacing.  I have NO clue why these scenes were left on the cutting room floor, but I am REAL glad they saw the light of day.

If Marvel can't get the rights to Wolverine and the X-Men back, at least this film shows that Fox is on the right track again with the franchise.

3609726,3,B001GCUO16,"For something that was supposed to be such a classy film that supposedly outduels Man of Steel for Summer Superhero supremacy (say that three times fast!), I for one, wasn't convinced.  It seemed to avoid making Logan into the next Superman, while also abandoning the formula on how to make a one man army action flick.  What we ended up with, was a viciously, mentally scarred mutant going into an all out war with corrupt Japanese authorites, corporations, and the Yakuza, and coming out a viciously, physically scarred mutant.

The film adds several layers to Hugh Jackman's Wolvervine character, and is a very intriguing film overall, but really doesn't go anywhere.  The main character, the main focus of the film, is seemingly pulled into one random situation after another.  While this may lend itself to the idea that Logan is merely a nomad, or a drifter, so to speak, as he often was in the comics, it really doesn't make for a good action movie.  In a good action movie, the good guy gets the girl, beats down the bad guys, and gets all the spoils that go along with it, whether it be the accolades, or the riches, or whatever.  Wolverine doesn't gain squat!  Perhaps he's simply not my kind of character.  But for everything he went through, and sacrificed to reconcile something that really never was his problem to begin with, he doesn't come out of it any better or worse.  It's as if the film makers are saying, ""yes, he will spend hundreds of years going through hell for perfect strangers, just because of his strong sense of justice.""

The Wolverine is more like a television series pilot than a movie.  What's worse, is the teaser really doesn't seem to tie in accurately to the new X-men film, and is therefore a teaser in the truest sense of the word.  We already knew Stewart and McKellen were coming back before The Wolverine hit the theatres, so this was rather pointless.  It kind of left a bad taste in my mouth, given my high expectations, and is the lesser of the big 3 superhero flicks of 2013.

Intriguing, and worth at least a viewing or two, it still makes me wonder how long Hugh Jackman and Marvel Studios can keep this up before they finally decide it's best to put this wounded animal out of it's misery.",1387152000,,2241,4.5814536340852134

He's on a plane for Japan where he must take up the manners he remembered from decades ago during WW2 and live with a purpose. Here we see Wolverine addressing both his samurai sense of order and his animal self and channelling both to solve the problem that he might be outmatched to handle. And just when he thinks it is time to return to some quiet contemplation, he is in the airport and sees the metal objects rising from the tray. And also look for the Trask posters behind him as a clue to what is coming. Wolverine can no longer exist on the sidelines.

X-men. Wolverine. Hugh Jackman. Action scenes, reasonable dialogue, great execution.

The Long:
It's a good movie to put on when you're cooking or looking for some casual fun. Let's be clear - this is not Oscar material, ladies and gents.

X-Men Origins: Wolverine got a lot of flak from critics. To be honest, in the realm of 'bad' super hero movies, this does not come close to Green Lantern or G.I. Joe (yes, I'm counting it here).  Those movies were cut/scripted/directed in such a way that the viewer looking for casual fun found it hard to watch end to end without feeling certain scenes were contrived/rushed.

Wolverine may have not developed certain characters completely, but this is not a Tom Clancy novel. We're dealing with 1-2h (max) of time. You can only dedicate so much to backstory. So, hey, 5 stars. I bought it. I liked it.",1387152000,,854,4.7114093959731544

3609751,4,B001GCUO16,"By now even non-Marvel comics devotees know the persona of The Wolverine, primarily because he has been recreated by actor Hugh Jackman six times (and if you pay attention to the films ending it seems there will be more). Writers Mark Bomback and Scott Frank have elected to place the action of this version in Japan  both in the time of the Atomic Bombing of Nagasaki and the present. Much of the reason this version works well is due to the fact that the action is all in the beauty of Japan of today  not only the scenery but also the symbols and traditions. Director James Mangold gives this version of Wolverine adventure a hefty dose of compassion and human feeling and that adds significantly.

According to the short synopsis form 20th Century Fox, In modern day Japan, Wolverine is out of his depth in an unknown world as he faces his ultimate nemesis in a life-or-death battle that will leave him forever changed. Vulnerable for the first time and pushed to his physical and emotional limits, he confronts not only lethal samurai steel but also his inner struggle against his own immortality, emerging more powerful than we have ever seen him before. That states it well. Add to that description the many fights and magic that occur before our eyes and the content is complete.

Hugh Jackman is in buff form as a very tender Wolverine (Logan) this time around (flashbacks to his loss of his love, Famke Janssen, add spice). Others who make solid appearances include Tao Okamoto as the important Mariko, Rila Fukushima as Logans sidekick, Svetlana Khochenkova as the evil Viper, Hiroyuki Sanada as a credible Shingen, and Ken Yamamura and Haruhiko Yamanouchi sharing the role of Yashida.

A bit on the long side, the film provides the expected visual entertainment, and this time there is a bit more humanity infused as well. Grady Harp, December 13",1387065600,,1858,4.775700934579439

This is a fun movie from start to finish; you came to see Wolverine kick ass, and he kicks ass. Logan essentially went to Japan, and BAM!, unexpected crap starts happening. The simplicity of the story just makes it good, fun and fresh; after the movie is over I said ""Yes, I'm ready for a sequel now"".

Of course, as one would expect from the title, Wolverine is the focus of the movie.  But the movie also prominently features, Sabertooth and Gambit as well as several other people from the X-Men universe, (such as Cyclops, in a very minor role).  The deleted scenes showed a very young Storm, which was interesting, but in my opinion, not good enough for the movie.

I particularly enjoyed the scenes of Wolverine fighting in various wars over the last 200 years.  Our species technological genius for killing increases impressively with every war.",1387065600,2,720,4.966666666666667

This was not Americanized, but rather the other way around.  For once we see an American-made product of fiction Orientalized.  :)  Great on that score.  The female leads were both a great counterpoint to the Wolverine's masculinity and power.  The other surprise that came at the end in the suit of armor was also really great, although disappointing all at the same time.  I asked myself, ""man..is there no one that is honorable any more?""

All that said, I didn't like it for some levels of juvinility and appeal to the teen crowd.  I'm past that I guess.  So for me if was just ""ok"".  At least the story was interesting.",1387065600,,745,4.568181818181818

3609766,5,B001GCUO16,"I usually don't review movies, but I just had to give my input on this one because it was one of the best movies I saw this year. The storyline didn't disappoint in the least and the Japanese touch added was absolutely authentic. I felt that every detail was polished and refined about a million times, and it really showed.

For one thing, I loved the promo posters released before it hit theaters. The calligraphy style was unique and caught my attention the first time I saw it. However, I worried that it would become one if those American-Asian films (movies that try to incorporate Asian flair but fail miserably when the actors aren't even Asian or they shoot in the U.S., etc.). I was really pleased with the way it turned out, though. It had enough Japanese authenticity to feel exotic but at the same time enough familiarity so viewers would understand what was going on and be even more into the film. The scenes with landscapes were beautifully filmed and the fighting scenes are not too chaotic as to confuse you. As I said before, all details were thoroughly examined.

I definitely recommend this to X-Men or Marvel fans. It was amazing and near the ending was a complete shocker that left me thinking, ""I can't believe I didn't notice that!"" Anyway, WATCH IT.

3609807,4,B001GCUO16,"After the last three installments in the X-Men franchise (even First Class) I had little hope left that they could turn this dead franchise around.  When I saw the trailer to the Wolverine I got a bit excited, but I was not holding my breath.  I went to see it and I really enjoyed the film.  I will say that this is my second favorite film in the franchise.  X2 is still my all-time favorite X-Men movie, but The Wolverine is a close second.

The Wolverine is what X-Men Origins should have been.  Unlike that film this film is actually about Wolverine himself and his journey.  Origins was supposedly about Wolverine but, like X-Men 3, tried to shove in as many other mutants as possible, which took away from Wolverines story.  This film has other mutants, but there are very few and do not detract from Wolverine.

The film has Wolverine dealing with the events of X-Men 3 which I actually like.  It does not make the Last Stand a better movie but it does make it more significant overall.  After he killed Gene at the end of X3 he has gone off the radar, is living like a hermit in the woods and has lost purpose in his life.  This film is all about Wolverine finding new purpose and coming to terms with who he really is.  Throughout the X-Men films Wolverine has been trying to fight his nature, which is the animal who acts on instincts.  In this movie he comes to realize that the animal is a part of who he is and accepts it, and in turn finds new purpose in his life.  This film is definitely one of the deepest X-Men movies and delves into Wolverine as a person, which is what Origins should have done.

Another thing that this film has going is the action scenes.  The action scenes are fun, thrilling, and actually pretty graphic.  This film is definitely the most violent of the X-Men movies.  The X-Men films up until now had very little blood.  In this film when people get hurt or die you see the effects.  When Wolverine cuts people with his claws there is actually blood.  There is one scene with Wolverine that is particularly graphic.  For those who have seen the film, you guys know what scene I am referring to.  This film is not Watchmen violent but it is pretty graphic for children.  The effects are also very well done.  The effects in this film are leagues better than the effects in Origins and First Class.  I cannot say if the 3D is good or not because my theatre only shows 2D.

Hugh Jackman is back as Wolverine and does a phenomenal job once again.  However, he is not the only one who did great here.  Tao Okamoto (Mariko) and Rila Fukushima (Yukio) did a magnificent job too.  The surprising thing is this is the first big movie that the two of them were in.  Before this they mostly worked as models.  They did very good for their first time and hopefully we will see them in more movies.  The villain was great and had a lot of dimension to him.  I like how the villain knew Wolverine before, which gives him a personal connection to Wolverine.  He reminds me of Striker quite a bit.  The one character/actress that I did not care for is Viper (Svetlana).  I found her acting to be a bit over-the-top.  Plus she was a very stereotypical comic book villain which feels quite out-of-place in a movie like this.

Overall, The Wolverine is the best X-Men movie to come out in a very long time.  If you are a fan of Wolverine, X-Men, or just a fan of action movies, see this film.  Also, stay after the credits.  There is a long after credits scene which directly ties to the next X-Men film.  In my opinion it is the best after credits scene that I have seen so far.",1386806400,3,3601,4.3343328335832085

3609818,3,B001GCUO16,The biggest downfall of this film I felt was the limited amount of interaction with other mutants. What makes the X-men experience exciting is to be brought into another reality where there people who have special powers and watch how they interact with those who don't. That was almost completely lost in this film. There wasn't much complexity and damsel in distress theme is trite and fell flat with me.,1386806400,2,406,4.814285714285714

3609828,5,B001GCUO16,"Really great movie. Hugh Jackman is great as Wolverine. The extended cut version is the one to get.  It comes with 4 disc - Blu-Ray 3D Verison. Blu-Ray Theatrical Version w/ Alternate Ending. Blu-Ray Extended/Unrated Cut Version. DVD/Digital Version. Much better than the X-Men Origins Wolverine. Only problem that I have with this movie which is no big deal to others but to me since I am a huge Wolverine fan. Is that (SPOILERS) Wolverine adamantium claws are sliced off. Admantium is indestructible, it can't break, bend, melt, etc. Also, in the comics adamantium vs adamantium cannot break against each other. However, Silver Samurai does have the ability to slice any known material in the marvel universe  except adamantium. Other than that I really recommend this movie to anyone who loves Wolverine as a character or has not seen it yet.

Still hoping for a Rated-R Wolverine movie to come out whenever. With lots of blood and limbs being torn off, cause you know its Wolverine one strike from the claws to the arm and its gone.",1386720000,,1036,4.84180790960452

Yes I agree with the other comment about fuddling the history or chronicle order of Wolverine's past, and not really staying true to comic character history. But not everybody knows his history, and this was a good way to bring the planet up to speed on this character, I've watched it numerous times, a true typecast for Jackman, but we should all be so fortunate!!!!!!!!",1386633600,,661,4.610169491525424

I don't read the comics, so maybe there was some referencing I wasn't getting, but it seems like it was over-written. There were too many aspects that just didn't fit into to the overall plot, which in itself was rather weak I think.

*SPOILERS* I mean, why is there a Samurai transformer at the end? What purpose does that really serve? And why cut the claws off? His ""mutant essence"" is in them.. really? And if they old man was going to extract his ""powers"" anyway, then why give the company to the daughter?

She might be a good model, but she has a lot more to learn about acting.  Also, as a immigrant from a asian country, I can confidently say that this western fantasy for Japan is not even close to real Japanese culture. (I can say that I have keen understanding about Japanese culture as I personally experienced it as grow up and I also personally practiced Kendo as well). The storyline was not convincing at all to me. The writer and producer should have studied about Japanese History and culture as well as Bushido before he/she write/read the script.

3609867,1,B001GCUO16,"Granted this is a Marvel picture and any kind of realism is thrown out the window... nonetheless this movie is a gross offense to the Country of Japan and its people and anyone who has spent time in Japan would understand.  The absolute incompetence of the Japanese Government and the unexplained traitorous action of the ""main bad guy"" Yashida makes absolutely no sense.

1.  Is the Japanese government so failed and corrupt that they cannot defend their own capital?  No police/military security anywhere in this movie?

2.  Anyone familiar with where the temple scene is actually located in Tokyo knows that it is less then a mile away from the Prime Minister's residence/Parliament Building:  Perhaps the most secured civilian area in Japan gets taken out without any effort...  I thought I was watching ""White House Down"" (movie about incompetent secret service) all over again.

3.  Has anyone here who made the movie actually ridden on a Shinkansen (Japanese Bullet Train) before?  First of all they don't go full speed while in city areas (usually half or 2/5 speed), there isn't' a million things overhead, and NOTHING overhead that comes anywhere near the train.  If you were to somehow ""ride the top of the train"" you would be able to do so safely without stuff flying in your face.  The amount of random flying stuff is simply amazing.

4.  Yashida; the reason why this movie exists, has no explanation as to why when being honorable solider in WWII, would over time suddenly abandoned his family honor and go crazy.  Furthermore this movie fails to understand why his son would also go crazy.  I guess ""Japanese Honor"" is just some made up concept then.  Same is true for the ninja faction that ""supposedly guards the family.""

5.  The Nuclear Bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki as seen in movie would have not had it's blast radius extend as far over the ocean to where the characters were standing.  Furthermore its news to me that there was a POW camp in Nagasaki there too that got wiped out.  The  20-Kiloton or so warhead used in 1945 had less then 1/4 mile ""lethal"" blast radius (one that would have caused the amount of damage to Wolverine as it did) and would have never made it to the POW area.  Thus the premise of the movie is completely meaningless.

How do I know that?  Look it up on Google... plenty of defense websites that explains all about nukes; how to make em even (kinda), and you can even ""calculate"" damage radius.  Just watch out for the NSA hacking your computer afterwards.

I will not list everything wrong with this movie:  If you can get over these failed ""plot devices"" still this movie completely fails to be a movie.  It doesn't explain why any of the characters are doing what they are doing and why they are doing it.  Just another random violence action movie that pales in comparison to the Disney-made ""Avengers"" series.

Do not waste your life on this movie... and certainly don't buy it:  That would be just as crazy as Yashida.",1386547200,3,2981,4.682080924855492

It was closer to the classic X-men comics than most of these movies, but was a little slow at parts and was of course dumbed down for a PG-13 rating, mass audience.  I wouldn't buy, but rent was okay.

I just lost interest in it half way through and decided to finish it the following day. The special effects were first rate but I am to the point that special effects alone will not make a movie good. I really enjoyed the first Wolverine movie. I was surprised to hear from some friends that they did not like it. I typically will watch a movie like this 2 or 3 times over the course of several years.

For those expecting non-stop action and a barrage of mutants, this isn't your film. But for those looking for a film with well made action sequences and a solid story line, give this a spin. The film is not without its faults. But what film isn't? Fans of the series should get a kick out of this film which has a nice scene at the end that nicely sets up the upcoming new XMEN movie. The video and sound quality of the film are all top notch and even though the Unrated version doesn't really add all that much to the movie I do prefer it over the PG-13 version and it's more ideal then watching the rated version in 3D (which is a useless conversion) or 2D. 8/10",1386374400,2,816,4.203821656050955

Hugh Jackman must have needed some fast cash for him to have been connected to this horror. The Japanese must be furious how this piece of trash portrayed living there. It's one of the safest countries I have ever been in and the idea of the Yakuzi (Japanese mafia) shooting it out in the streets like the drug cartels just doesn't happen! Don't get me wrong, bad things happen, but not in public. If you know anything about the Japanese culture, the whole premise is just stupid. No way would someone who's life you saved would pull a stunt like that, talk about losing face! Save your money or flush it down the toilet, same result.

3609924,5,B001GCUO16,"Spoiler Alert!  I've revealed some plot points of the new Wolverine movie on DVD! So you have been told before you start this review. What I did see, before the movie put me to sleep, is revealed in the  review! I didn't reveal too much if you saw the trailer on line or TV.

After watching most of the Wolverine movie on DVD, I have to admit, it put me to sleep! I'm  giving you my first impression of what this alleged action extravaganza  was while watching it! The resemblance to the Frank Miller  and Chris Claremont  comic novel was very thin indeed! Wolverine has to go up against larger than life characters to make a good film. He did in this one. However, it was at the very end, with a battle against  Silver Samurai.

Like any a good actor or show biz personality, you can tolerate an actor in a bad film.  Usually the actor, if they are good, can transcend any of the bad material that passes for a script. This was the case in Wolverine.  I can forgive the first movie because they threw so many heroes and villains up on the screen.  The producers wanted to see what concepts would stick.

This plot brings our favorite X Man to Japan where he finds an old friend he rescued from ""the bomb"" in World War II. His friend, who turns out not to be,  takes away his immortality along with his healing powers. After that it all goes downhill.  Sony, the company that owns the X-Men, doesn't have the slightest idea of what the character is about.  When you put the character up against ordinary villains, you get an ordinary movie!

If the producers and writers of this film read the comics, it might have been a worthwhile endeavor.  Directors disassociate them from the source material, because they find it below their intellectual threshold.  While it was better than the first entry, this one is marginally better.  That isn't saying much because Wolverine is known world wide as the best character in the X-Men.  When will we see an actual movie that is worthy of character?  Perhaps in X-Men: Days of Future Past. That's the next entry in the Bryan Singer directed movie coming out next year.  If that one is anything like ""The Wolverine""; I'll be waiting for that movie to hit the $5 Wal-Mart bin.

When Wolverine made his debut in 1974 in The Incredible Hulk comic #181; he actually fought the Hulk!  Why couldn't one of the movies recreate that battle on screen? You'd have fans world wide waiting weeks to get tickets for that event!

My final verdict on this movie is yes, it's worth watching again.  I expected a lot better on the part of the film makers and the studio that made the X-Men.  Where was their research and development department in this one?  Did anyone out there ask the fans what might make a good film they would want to  see?",1386201600,4,2766,4.452191235059761

The action was all seen in the trailer.  Wolverine limps around whining a lot in this movie.  This was a big let down, we were hoping for an action packed thriller, unfortunately this is not what we got.  Save your money, Redbox it if you have to.

1. Wolverine shirtless for the majority of the movie gets old.

3. We only care about internal dualism in an action movie when there is action.

A lot of this film has an indie feel that may turn a lot of people off, but it allows you to really see the comic book hero in an unconventional way. Of course there is plenty of action as well, including a nail biting fight on top of a speeding bullet train.

This movie takes place after X-Men: The Last Stand, after Wolverine killed Jean. So he's depressed and tormented by this and decides to walk away from being a hero. He goes into hiding in a cave up in the mountains. Then a man whose life he saved years ago sends another ""mutant"" to fetch Wolverine. I use that term loosely coz her only non-human ability is that she sees someone's death, but the visions come at random and it's only in bits & pieces. That my friend, in my mind, is a psychic not a mutant.

She said Yashida (guy Wolverine saved) is dying and wants to see Wolverine so he can say goodbye. At first he said no. But really it didn't take long or much at all to convince him to disavow isolation and travel to Japan simply for goodbyes.

At this point, the movie just took a slow dull turn; desperately trying for the mysterious and keep-you-guessing feel. But instead of hanging on to my seat, I kept wanting the scenes to move a little faster already. They did however show a naked Hugh Jackman being bathed by a group of women. And there's a bootylicious frame of him, but not sure if it's Hugh's butt or a body double.

So long story short, Wolverine finds out that he wasn't there just to say goodbye. The now dying Yashida wants to take Wolverine's immortality from him. Other than living forever, they don't really provide a concrete motive as to why this man would want to be immortal. So he's pretty much just an ungrateful megalomaniac who wants to live forever. Lame.

Don't even get me started with Wolverine's love interest in this movie. There was no chemistry there at all. And at first, she looked like she was barely 18. So when they started making out, I was actually a little grossed out.

I can keep going, but then I'll just get frustrated again. I blame the writers and the director for this failure of a movie. With a budget of over $200M, they could have done waaaay better than this. Honestly, if it wasn't Hugh Jackman that starred in this movie, it would have flopped in the box office big time.",1386115200,,2279,4.453237410071942

3609941,5,B001GCUO16,"I was only a comic reader for about 15 years, starting in the early 1980s. It was a time when ""graphic novels"" had started to issue with very adult themes and serious character development, not all BAM POW BOP. In all honesty, at times The Uncanny Xmen, one of the titles I did read, was like a soap opera with moody character conversations about being lonely cast-outs in a hostile world.

That being said, I loved the series I read and it was a time when the events in this movie had already taken place - Kitty and Wolverine was an early maxi-series for me - and so I tend to prefer a balance of fight scenes and character development. Especially in comparison to its prequel, this movie is thoughtful and shows Logan as a person, with clear motives and sensible reactions to things. Anyone looking for 120 minutes of RAWR and fighting will be reasonably disappointed and should go play a video game instead. It portrays him as a man with feelings trying to sort out his place in a world he dislikes but was drawn into by a rare event - falling for Jean Grey.

I'd think even people who don't like comics could enjoy this one, with the exception of the final battle which gets a little geeky and ""comicey."" As a side note, when comics started introducing super-wealthy characters with secret labs it was a lot harder to buy than it is now with our ever-increasing income disparity in the world and billionaires running around. The only real ""technical"" objection I saw with the movie was several instances where Logan's tracking instincts - smell and intuition - would have come into play but were not included. Whatever - it would have made the movie less accessible for some audiences.

If you want non-stop mindless action battle scenes you'll be disappointed, but so many of these comic adaptations suffer from a loss of connection between the characters' back stories and their actions because there's not enough time to develop the story so the actions seem inauthentic or disconnected. Overall I think this is one of the best superhero/mutant films we've had, in part due to the script and also to the fine acting of Hugh - who we're lucky to have in our generation to portray Logan. Here we get a great movie all around. Bravo.",1386115200,,2238,4.6040100250626566

Having said that, in this movie Wolverine has two new women (as well as a host of Yakuza and Ninja) to play off of.

3609949,1,B001GCUO16,"This review is basically one big spoiler.

I love all the XMen movies. I own them all. I watch them every time they are on TV. I have been checking several times a day for this movie to shift to rental. When I got home today, I fixed some munchies and flipped on the projector. At last, I get to watch ""The Wolverine!""

As the movie opens, we find Wolverine is now a dirty looking street person. He is convinced to go to Japan where they give him a bath. Another mutant infects Wolverine and he starts to lose his ability to heal and is weakened. He has to have a Japanese girl defend him. He regains his ability to heal only to get his metal claws chopped off in battle. The Wolverine got his butt kicked and declawed by a man with a robotic exoskeleton. Another Japanese gal had to save him by using one of his chopped off claws. Now, with his tail tucked between his legs, he goes to the airport to leave Japan where Magneto and the Professor stop time and give him an urgent message the world is about to be destroyed.

It seems to be a trend in superhero movies to make the superhero impotent the majority of the movie then after having watched your superhero get his butt kicked for over an hour, they finally muster enough strength for a brief comeback.  Well, this movie not only follows the horribly overdone trend but goes a step further. Wolverine gets his metal claws taken away and someone else has to defeat the bad guy.

I cannot believe Hugh Jackman would agree to such a movie. This falls second to Data being killed on Star Trek.

There are more than a few scenes in this movie that are worth rewinding and re-watching.  It's that well done.  This movie is more adult, as it should be; and puts Wolverine into quite a few bad places.  We get to see why he is a true hero.  It's not his healing factor.  It's not his claws.  Because Wolverine loses his powers for a while and still prevails through a series of suspenseful scenes that make you admire him for WHO he is, not for what his mutant abilities or adamantium upgrades are.

The Silver Samurai is not like the comics version, but it is still pretty scary.  He's all adamantium!  You can guess how that makes things on Wolverine.

3609957,3,B001GCUO16,"THE MOVIE.....
To begin, I am well-versed in the Wolverine character, and have wanted to see a more gritty take on him--something wherein Wolverine stood ALONE, not sharing scenery with a cadre of Mutant heroes and villains, all vying for attention. Like Hugh Jackman, I enjoy the character for his own dramatic potential.
That said, I`ll keep the movie review short: This film delivers a better Wolverine than the 'Origins' (so-called) stand-alone Wolverine movie.....Logan gets center-stage here for real this time, and Jackman makes the best of it. The storyline--based upon the  classic Claremont/Byrne Wolverine limited series--is merely okay, due to the Claremont/Byrne tale being unfortunately altered for some bizarre, unexplained reason...The old saying goes ""If It Ain`t Broke, Don`t Fix It"", but Hollywood seems to never quite grasp the value of that.....sadly.
This was a good Wolverine movie....BUT...It could have been great.

""Of All The Sentiments Of Word Or Pen, The Saddest Are; 'It Might Have Been""

Now...for THE MARKETING.....

Call me a curmudgeon..call me crazy if you wish...But I am tired of multiple-disc set offerings . I am tired of having to purchase formats that I DO NOT WANT in order to get the one that I do. I really did not want a '3D Blu-ray' copy of this movie.....nor can I play one, as I do not have the gear for it... Likewise, I did not want the standard DVD of theTheatrical cut with the existence of an 'Extended' version available....nor did I want a Blu-Ray of the Theatrical cut with an Extended version available...... I  DID want the' Extended Unrated' version of the film....
 So.... I had to buy THREE MORE formats just to get THE ONE that I was interested in?
 I don`t know what the marketing genius who dreamt up this idea got for it, but it should have been LIFE Without Parole. ( Hey, Bernie Maddoff could use a checkers partner, I`m sure)

Of course, I immediately sold off the extraneous versions of the set on Ebay, to the effect that the movie cost me nothing...
But frankly, I would just as soon gone to the store, bought the one that I wanted and been done with it.
 Buying a movie should not have to be a pain-in-the-ass exercise in buying things I do not need  or want.

3609963,5,B001GCUO16,"Set after the events of ""X-Men: Last Stand"", ""The Wolverine"", directed by James Mangold and based on the 1982 comic written by Chris Claremont and illustrated by Frank Miller, is a terrific, high octane thriller that adds a darker element to the popular character.

Unfortunately Fox, tricky folks that they are, have not made the extended verison available in 3D.

SPOILERS:

Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is summoned to Japan to meet with Yashida a wealthy industrialist. Wolverine had saved the life of Yashida when he was a soldier during the atomic bombing of Nagasaki. The event provided a bond between the POW and soldier and Yashida wants to repay his debt--the dying industrialist claims to have a cure to Wolverine's cure--his immortality. Wolverine turns Yashida down and the old man dies that night. During the funeral Wolverine finds himself a reluctant bodyguard for Yashida's young granddaughter Mariko when someone makes an attempt on her life. Wolverine is determined to find out what the link is between Yashida's past, his death and Mariko.

END OF SPOILERS:

The 3D (and 2D) presentation on Blu-ray for ""The Wolverine"" looks marvelous with nice depth, bold colors and great detail. The film is presented with a nice layer of grain adding to the film like texture.

The immersive 5.1 sounds terrific as well although some folks might have difficulty with dialog during a few scenes due to how the folded down 5.1 track sounds in stereo. I should note, however, that ""The Wolverine"" doesn't suffer from extremely aggressive mix that made ""Man of Steel"" problematic at times. English subtitles are available for the film.

The 3D edition features 4 discs.

The first disc includes the 3D version of the movie with no bonus features. Again, this does NOT feature the extended version of the film.

The second disc features the theatrical cut of ""The Wolverine"" along with the bulk of the bonus features that are included on the standard 2 disc Blu-ray/DVD combo pack. We get an alternate ending along with a tour of the set for ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"". We also get ""The Wolverine: Second Screen App for use with ipads and other portable devices. The three part documentary ""The Pathof a Ronin"" is also included on this disc as well as a profile of actor Hugh Jackman and a featurette on the evolution of the character of Wolverine.

The third disc features the EXTENDED CUT of the movie. The bonus features include a second screen app exclusive to this version and a commentary track by director James Mangold. Mangold does not do a commentary track on the theatrical cut of the film on the second disc. The extended version lasts about 12 minutes long than the theatrical cut of the film.

The fourth disc includes only the DVD transfer of the film along with a digital copy that can be uploaded and played on portable devices and computers.

Fox should have provided an extended version on 3D (they could have done a seamlessly branching version of both films on the same disc). They also should have provided the extended version for the regular Blu-ray version for those who don't have 3D TVs. It would have been the right thing to do.

""The Wolverine"" is a marvelous film that has a much darker edge than ""Origins: Wolverine"" and is a better written film with a much healthier budget allowing Mangold to tackle much more involved CGI for the film. This is an impressive movie and Jackman is, as usual, top notch as the world-weary immortal.

3609969,3,B001GCUO16,"I just got a look at the excel spreadsheet of the prisoner list of Hiroshima POW Camp 6 provided by one of the far east POW websites.

As mentioned by a Canadian POW, the Japanese would periodically update the POW photos and records.

Those records contain their full names, their next of kin and their home addresses.

And I know from the POW memoirs I own that very often American former POWs would find themselve approached by their former Japanese gaolers and in every memoir, the former POWs claim that they accepted the now remorseful just doing his job former tormentor and killer.

I also read that Navajo code talkers were contacted decades later by Japanese enemy combatants.

So in light of these facts especially that they maintained records on each prisoner including their next of kin usually their wives (and they were so nice to the wives of the British in Hong Kong) and the home addresses, then THIS Wolverine movie is about Japan as deadly frenemy.

That's why the Vincent Price lookalike narrator of Cinemasins dings the fact that Wolverine with his heightened senses appears to not SMELL Yukio's presence exactly as he seemed to not SMELL Rogue hiding in his vehicle in the first X-Men movie.

He is silent and well mannered as his arm is twisted to fly to Tokyo to see his ""old friend"" his former gaoler who still calls him by an insulting name and pretty much all the Japanese are disrespectful, discourteous and not at all good hosts to him.

The original clueless review of a temporary piece of brain candy:

I couldn't figure out if this was the only way to get the digital copy of the Extended/Unleashed version with the extra minutes that every review claims makes this movie better.

I don't think this movie is worth five dollars nevermind the extra six dollars in order to see the extended but I decided to not upsell myself up to a multidisc with digital copy because since I don't think much of the movie, I have decided to pay the lowest price to get what I genuinely want i..e the extended version.  For the same price, the iTunes version is better because it provides extras BUT here is where ROKU's power is evident.  I simply want to be able to jump from netflix to Amazon Instant Video via the wonderfully responsive  Roku remote.

I have the original issues (worthless since they are worn from reading and time) and this movie just is not attractive.  Hugh Jackman always seems too ... poreless to be Wolverine but I do like Liev Schreiber as Sabretooth (he's not in this movie).  COINCIDENTALLY, Liev Schreiber played Hugh Jackman's descendant in this director's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kate-And-Leopold/dp/B007SSDBBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kate And Leopold</a>.  Go figure.

The Amazon Instant Video showed up right away on the Roku so there was no problem.

I committed to buying the extended version based on this review:

http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BMEOALOEUN2E/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E4W40C4&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=2625373011&store=movies-tv

but in hindsight, the extra gore may not have made this movie better but at least we know.

To me, the best thing about this film is the Russian actress who plays Viper who was lovelier without the heavy makeup in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tinker-Tailor-Soldier-Spy/dp/B0059XTTW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</a>.  Here, despite her laudably perfect American accent and delivery (unlike Yukio's inappropriate echoing of Scott Summers' ""You're still a ...."" line to Wolverine), she is definitely Russian and her scene in the street both with the random harasser and the ninja echo the disrespect the Russian female expats experience in Japan and the ninja's threat of giving her a Glasgow smile actually happened to female victims of the Japanese invasion of Asia.

This movie despite being set in and about Japan is clearly about the frenemy relationship between the Allies and the Axis.  The villain's offspring are all trained against the kuzuri and you will want to rewatch the film to note all the dishonesty and feigned friendship.

It would explain why the residence of the family and the movements of the inhabitants resemble that of a stage play.

Interestingly, given Logan's longevity and life experiences, it would not be unlikely that he spots this a mile away as well as enduring Jean Grey's constant psychic trespassing imploring him to suicide.

Very much like Pico Iyer, Professor X and Wolverine leave their love interests in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Another-Country/dp/B00BGARGR8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Another Country</a>.

For the first time, I found myself liking Hugh Jackman when his character was amusingly sneaky by meekly repeating the standard phrase before eating at the table followed by stabbing his chopsticks upright into his bowl of rice.  Now would he stab his fork into a slice of pot roast and leave it like the American flag planted on the Moon?  So why would he do that to the rice with the chopsticks if not to invite the common CHINESE admonishment followed by the statement from a very unTunguistic looking Japanese fashion model ""Nothing is without meaning.""

Well, that stand-in for incense in a bowl in front of the portrait of the deceased is placed OPPOSITE the Japanese female that Wolverine shortly beds a la Mickey Rourke in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Year-of-the-Dragon/dp/B004427L2U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Year of the Dragon</a>.  And that is why the Chinese character in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hawaiians/dp/B004LB5FDQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hawaiians</a>&nbsp;becomes Charlton Heston's business partner and a Japanese field hand becomes his wife.

The extras in the Japanese crowd scenes look intentionally outdated as if this were set in the 1970s but the technology is modern.  Coincidentally, Wolverine starred in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Real-Steel/dp/B004A8ZWW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Real Steel</a>&nbsp;echoing the final Boss fight  - also against a Japanese/Russian team.

Viper was characterized very well in this film - much better and of course, more glamorously than Ray Park's Toad in the X Men movie.

At least Silver Samurai was SMART enough to make the right gesture at the beginning of the film and release the POWs when the bombing started:

TOKYO PRISON ATROCITY

Towards the end of the Pacific War, the execution of captured Allied aircrews became almost automatic. Courts-martial were dispensed with on orders from the Military Police Headquarters. In the Tokai Military District, twenty-seven airmen were executed by firing squad, but often, less humane methods were used. In the Japanese Army Prison in Tokyo all the buildings were built of wood and into this prison were crammed 464 Japanese soldiers serving sentences. Also confined in the prison were 62 American airmen who earlier were shot down and captured. During the night of May 25, 1945, Tokyo was heavily bombed by the US Air Force and the prison was hit by incendiaries. In the conflagration which followed, all the 62 airmen were burned to death. A significant factor in this incident was that none of the Japanese prisoners or any of the prison guards suffered a similar fate. The failure of the Japanese to release the 62 flyers could only have been deliberate.

Based on a graphic novel, this latest Wolverine movie is chock full of action and even romance that was very well crafted by the new director. Hugh Jackman proves, yet again, that he can carry a movie all alone with charisma and totally capture the true essence of the Wolverine of the comics. Gruff and badass, but with a heart.

The Silver Samurai angle was also well done, and the ending was a total surprise for us.",1386028800,,516,4.537634408602151

Hugh Jackman takes his shirt off, makes tough guy faces, fights ninjas, takes his shirt off, makes existential tough guy faces, fights more ninjas, takes his shirt off and gets down to business with a stick insect that doubles as a love interest.

A few ""wow"" moments; a super hero that is shown to be vulnerable and a decent story line makes this movie a must see for action/fantasy fans. My gripe is that the story could have been relayed a little better. There were alot of new characters introduced that were very intriguing but by the end of the movie, I was indifferent about all of them due to the lack of their development. If they cut out some of the PG13 kung-fu-like fighting scenes and instead focused on story telling and character development, I would have given it 5 stars.

They have an amazing character in wolverine, why don't they really open him up and use interesting opponents. This movie is bland, and no better then Origins. The villains are lame and poorly used. Kind of like Spiderman 3.

While it was interesting to see wolverine flirt with mortality and become more human, its old hat by now, so many super hero movies try to make the protagonist vulnerable and mortal, etc.. its been done to death.

Most of this movie wolverine is fighting yakuza thugs. I mean, my god, open some marvel comics and pick some villains. You have a badass like wolverine and the best ya can do is thugs! This movie is like a lamborghini that doesn't go over 20 MPH

3609984,2,B001GCUO16,"This is a terrible movie. Wolverine busts out of a tank of water where he basically died a few minutes ago, then in the next scene his hair is perfectly coiffed and blow-dryed. That's the kind of storytelling and movimaking care in evidence through most of the film. Characters pop up then disappear, no one has any emotional depth outside of Wolverine and Sabretooth and even this is given short shrift in favor of annoying cameos by Deadpool and Gambit. Then nothing solid is done with either so they are there... why?

Stunts are ""Oh, this' ll be cool"" rather than flowing from the story, the kid playing young Wolverine is not fantastic. And the one part of the film where something new with emotional depth occurs (Wolverine's retreat into the Canadian wilderness with a beautiful, seemingly caring woman, from what little we see of her) is rushed over in order to get to some more clich ""superhero movie"" writing (i.e. think the derivative Daredevil, not Dark Knight), etc.

I give this 2 stars because Hugh Jackman is awesome, as always, as is Liev Schrieber as Sabretooth. So much potential here for a great film, almost all completely wasted. What a shame. Fortunately, this movie is so bad the studio was forced to make The Wolverine very true to the source material and handed us a great film. Buy that one!

His struggle to reconcile past atrocities performed on him and the incredible power he has, as a result, is a difficult emotionally draining process for him.  Compounded with the loss of Jean (aka Phoenix) and the guilt he feels for his role in her death he has surmised that life is not really worth living.  Isolated in self-proclaimed exile he spends his days, and nights, reliving her death.  He believes death will free him from all pain.  You know what they say about getting what you wish for?  Wolverine will have plenty of time to ponder the answer to that question when he is jerked back into the present world to fulfill an old friend's last request.

The first two thirds of the movie were very good and grounded the movie in a more dark and realistic world, a nice departure from previous forays into the X-Men universe. The last act was kind of curve ball that embraced more generic superhero movies and was what really hurt the film. The director and star, Mangold and Jackman, cite Claremont and Miller's Japanese sage as inspiration for the film and it definitely is, but if they stuck closer to it and avoided over the top villains and comic book cliches, they could have made a real special movie. Instead, they've created a solid action movie that will satisfy most fans, but not knock their socks off. There's talk of a sequel being made, and I hope Mangold and Jackman have learned from The Wolverine and will be able to make an even more entertaining and satisfying film the next time.",1385769600,,995,4.564245810055866

.....also (again), we do not need to be told that jack's vow of peace will not outlast the first three scenes...which is just DULL...the ""surprise"" ending depends upon a passive acceptance, and is just as logically empty and cliche as the rest.  when an anticipated film opens and closes with little comment, that is nearly always an indication of mediocrity.jackman has always been the third star of the franchise, with capt. jean luc as the cynosure, but methinks the wolfman has been exhausted beyond the point of regeneration.",1385769600,,892,5.28169014084507

3609994,3,B001GCUO16,"I have to admit it, after reflection I was a little disappointed in 'The Wolverine'. Oh, it's nicely done and with some great special effects and action sequences, and I certainly don't expect a multi-layered, Oscar-worthy script with heavy character development when going into a film like this one. And yet, I've enjoyed past 'X-Men' films for this reason; that I grew to know and like the main characters, even if the bad guys sometimes came off as cartoonish.

Here, it's all sort of cartoonish. A good film, but Wolverine - who spends a great deal of the film mourning (and dreaming about) the loss of his beloved Jean Grey, is brooding and dark and fairly depressing throughout. And the plot - Wolverine, a recluse living in the woods after all that is happened, is summoned to Japan to say goodbye to a dying old friend he saved during the Nagasaki bombing in World War II - is a bit both superficial and artificial, with a subplot involving the friend's granddaughter that gets Wolverine into all kinds of mess with both the Yakuza and a serpent-tongued (literally) mutant who has found a way to render Wolvering all but mortal.

NOT a bad film ... but with little substance, many cartoon characters for characters, a script that needed a couple more rewrites, and an unnecessary romantic subplot for Wolverine that goes nowhere. On the plus side, it has Hugh Jackman, great visuals, a pretty wicked ""final battle"" ending, Will Yun Lee, and the film's best asset beyond Jackman - Rila Fukushima, who is totally kick-ass as Yukio (also the fight/chase scene that starts at the funeral and ends on a bullet train - that, and Fukushima, are worth seeing the film for ALONE).",1385683200,,1679,4.7465753424657535

For me, there is nothing in this film to dislike.  I went to see it with my siblings, just out of curiosity, because I have seen all the others.  But it was way better than what I expected it to be.  I didn't get bored with it, and I liked how it starts off in WWII.  The story is interesting as well, because it shows his vulnerability and I also feel in certain aspects, it shows his compassion.

3610019,4,B001GCUO16,"Wow!  This is just a review of the difference brought by the Extended cut.  Let me just make one thing clear, there's no version of Wolverine that's acceptable for children.  I don't know why Hollywood even tries.  A PG-13 berserker killer is still a berserker killer.  With that said, this extended version has more cussing.  I'm talking F-bombs and S-bombs here.  The violence is turned up to the point where Wolverine stabs one of the Yakuza and his blood (or guts) splatter onto the screen (Yes!).  There are other scenes with blood in them that I didn't notice in the theatrical version, but nothing too gory except maybe for the ninja scene.  Speaking of which, there's a a whole scene with the ninjas that was cut out of the theatrical cut that is so deliciously bloody and violent that it reminded me of Sceptic Avenger, only with blood (Saints Row 2 fans will know the reference).  If you're a Wolverine fan, don't even bother with the PG-13 version.  What's the point?  This guy is a killer and you came to see what he does best, but what he does isn't very nice.

I still have to drop a star for the stupid robot, that worthless mutant called Viper (in name only), and the apparent continuity flaw in that Wolverine appears to have memories from World War II.  As far as I remember, everything from at least the weapon X program and back is a blank.  It could be argued that him visiting Nagasaki jogged his memory of his time there, but he has a memory of this on the way to Japan as he looks out the window of the plane.  Very confusing and annoying.  Also, there's no mention of the mutant cure from X3, which is ridiculous considering why Wolverine is brought to Japan in the first place (before the truth is revealed).

A great story that is less about saving the world and more about the characters, very little CGI, and lots of claw-slashing, all the while staying true to the spirit of the comic character.  I think Wolverine works best in exactly this kind of film, and Mangold pulled it off very, very well.  The last act wasn't the best in that it strayed from all the things that made the first 2/3 great, but it's forgivable, certainly compared to previous X-Men films.  This could have been another disaster, but it turned out to be immensely enjoyable comic character piece.  The extended edition has some great little perks for fans.

3610024,5,B001GCUO16,"The Unrated Cut runs about 12 minutes longer than the Theatrical Cut, and contains several new scenes including a much expanded ninja action scene.  Wolverine drops a few more choice curse words and there is now CG-gore.  I'd say it's more like a hard PG-13 rather than an R-rated cut.

The UNRATED Cut is much better than the theatrical cut.

**Note, SPOILERS follow, so read at your own risk**.

1) There is more gore, but primarily CGI blood sprays.  Some shots of Wolverine's claws going through people's limbs, but nothing explicit.  No graphic dismemberments.

2) Wolverine drops a few more f-bombs.

3) Some of the opening scenes depicting Wolverine at the POW camp are a little longer.

4) The scene involving Wolverine, an arrow, and the hunter is slightly longer and more brutal.

5) Slightly longer dialogue with Yukio on the way to the plane.

6) Relationship between Mariko and Yashida and Shingen and  Yashida is better fleshed out in the unrated cut.

7) A new scene where Yashida asks Logan his age.

8) A new scene with Yashida talking to Shingen on his deathbed, telling him, ""You are not the man to lead Yashida"".

9) A new scene at the love hotel where the Yakuza show up and get into a fight with Wolverine.  Mariko intervenes and demonstrates some fighting skill as well.

10) Wolverine's operation on himself is bloodier.

11) The fight scene between Shingen and Wolverine is slightly longer and now depicts Shingen rather graphically cutting into Wolverine's shoulder blade (no blood though).

12) A new scene where Viper gives Hadana poison for his arrows, which he later uses to bring down Wolverine at the ninja fight.

13) The ninja fight scene is now much longer.  Wolverine gets dragged away in nets and hit by ninjas on bikes.  Yukio shows up to assist Wolverine and drives around in a snow plow chopping up hapless ninjas (some hearty blood spraying).  Wolverine lights his familiar cigar midway through the battle.

I'm actually glad the extra action scenes were removed from the theatrical cut.  Some of the action seemed a bit silly (e.g. ninjas hitting Wolverine with their motorbikes, although Wolverine lighting his trademark cigar was nifty).  Furthermore, Yukio's appearance detracted from Wolverine's thematic solo search for Mariko.  Didn't think Yukio added much to the scene.

14) The Silver Samurai battle is the same length as previously.

Overall, the unrated cut is much better dimensioned than the theatrical cut.  This is the one to get!!",1384819200,423,2488,4.9228915662650605
3610025,5,B001GCUO16,"After X-Men: The Last Stand, I kind of fell out of love with the X-movies. Then X-men: First Class got me excited again, but I had completely lost interest with the modern storyline. X2 is the best of the originals, but it still has it's hokey moments and general kid-friendliness. Xmen 1 is decent, but not my favorite. I never really loved an X-men movie until first class.

So when they announced The Wolverine, I didn't get too excited. But then I heard that they wanted to do it in Japan, Mangold was a good director, but I still didn't really feel the motivation. And then I read that Mangold said he had an extended and R-rated version of his movie. That had me curious. The trailer for the movie didn't sell me at all, but I'm a cinephile, so I figured I'll wait and see the unrated version, although I assumed it would be indistinguishably different.

Having just watched The Wolverine, I can say this is the best X-men film yet. Better than X2 and better than First Class (both of which I really dug)

The movie feels adult. I can't stress enough how much I mean that as a compliment. There is no goofiness, no terrible one liners, winks at the audience about other X-men or Marvel references. This is an honest to it's story and focused on it. Wolverine's claws maim people and he smokes and swears. And with the unrated edition, one might think this would be video game levels of violence. Amazingly not the case. It's unhinged but reserved at the same time. Restraint was shown and yet nothing feels held back.

Not since Nolan's Bat films have I really felt a superhero movie that was mature. This didn't feel like a superhero movie, it felt like an action film abotu a guy with claws. And it's so much better for it.

With The Avengers, Batman vs Superman, and X-men Days of Future Past, we aren't afforded opportunities to tell focused superhero stories anymore. Here we got actual character development, and a story that was smaller but all the better for it. Last time I appreciated a smaller film like this was Thor.

Bottom line, this is the best X-men film, but you wouldn't know it. It stands on it's own as a very mature film. I hope future superhero films take a page out of Mangold's book. And now I'm not at all disappointed there will be another one. (But there are other X-men needing films)",1384819200,11,2319,4.483412322274882

If you liked origins, i would imagine you might not like this film. Origins was an action flick, typical of what you'd expect from it. This on the other hand was not an action flick, there was some action in it, but it was more of a drama.

It kind of seemed like they saw the complaints with the origins movie, and decided to do exactly the opposite. If they did more of a middle ground, they might have had a more clear winner.

It overall was well done, but i would have appreciated it being a good 20min shorter, it's over 2 hours, and it does NOT fly by, it feels long. It's worth a watch, just don't be tired and sitting on a comfy couch with your feet up while doing so",1384300800,,777,3.967948717948718
3610035,4,B001GCUO16,"There may be spoilers.

I have to admit I was beginning to wear out my ears with the usual summer onslaught of loud, violent (but PG-13 of course) action films.  Mostly due to the overlong final acts.  I was expecting something similar here but surprise, the movie is good from beginning to end.  Sure the final sequence is a bit much but there aren't cities, skylines or military manpower and armament being destroyed.

We first see Logan aka The Wolverine hanging out in the rain in a Yukon forest.  He's still despondent after killing his beloved Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) in a previous X-Men episode.  He still dreams about her.  I did think the numerous sequences were a bit of a distraction.  A young Japanese swordswoman (Rila Fukushima) has tracked Logan down and asks him to come to Tokyo to say goodbye to an old, dying man (Hal Yamanouchi) whose life was saved by Logan when the ""Big One"" was dropped on Nagasaki to close out WW II.

Once there, Logan discovers that Yashida is indeed on his death bed but also one of the great high-tech industrialists in Japan.  His impending death is creating a power struggle between his son, his granddaughter, corrupt politicians and the Yakusa crime lords.  Logan picks cute Mariko (Tao Okamoto), the granddaughter to hang with and of course protect.

There are additional complications.  Logan's ability to quickly heal are waning thanks to a long-stemmed blond temptress called Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) who is also a chemist working with Yashida to extend his life.  Maybe the Wolverine's powers can be fed to the old man?

Director James Mangold, working with writers Mark Bomback and Scott Frank, are to be commended for making Logan's character down to Earth while not removing his fierceness.  As the relationship between Logan and Mariko becomes...uh...closer, he still keeps a distance understanding that her character will likely not work in future storylines.  Action fans should not be disappointed either.  There are plenty of well-choreographed fight scenes early on and throughout the film, the best being Logan vs. a Yakusa henchman in and on top of a speeding bullet train.  Sure, we've seen this before including this year in ""The Lone Ranger.""  But speed does make a difference.

This is a well-made, exciting take on the graphic novel and certainly atones for ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009).""",1384300800,,2369,4.974554707379135
3610036,4,B001GCUO16,"It was fun for what it was, but this movie ultimately gets lost in a weird sort of limbo - it's half modern Marvel movie, and half throw-back to the incredible graphic novel from the late 80s. I wish there had been more emphasis on Logan's battle with the samurai clan, which is genuinely interesting, and a joy to watch in any format. However, Hugh Jackman is still THE man, and his inhuman charisma carries the movie along, even when it should, by all rights, stumble. He is a fantastic actor, and a fantastic human being (this is the guy who stops in the park to cameo for film students), and he is, as always, a joy to witness as the Wolverine.",1384128000,3,648,4.319672131147541
3610037,5,B001GCUO16,"Like Origins, we get to see Logan as he truly is: a conflicted outcast freak. Hugh Jackman owns this character. He could play this role until the wheels fall off, or until his knees give out or he needs a hip replacement. The only other actor who can outshine Jackman in a comic book movie is Heath Ledger, and he is pushing up daisies.

Where The Wolverine trumps Origins is through the backstory. Here, the movie starts off with Logan at the full peak of his powers. He is a drifter, lone-wolf, shambling through WWII Japan. And then the bomb hits. Logan saves a Japanese soldier from Seppuku, then rushes him to safety. The soldier will not meet Logan again until he is on his death bed. The contrast between grizzly mountain man and ruthless formality of the Yakuza underworld is what makes this movie so special. There are scenes were long conversations take place in Japanese, which is unheard of from a big-budget American blockbuster of this type. The body count is pretty damn high. I watched the PG-13 theatrical cut and was surprised it wasn't slapped with a hard R.

The two main enemies Logan encounters are Viper and Silver Samurai. Both are formidable, and both were well-casted and played by their respective actors. This is a classic chase movie overall. Expect lots of explosions, heavy gun fights, and Yakuza in full body-suits. The Wolverine is consistent from start to finish, and doesn't slow down much. Other reviewers have pointed out that the beginning is slow, but I disagree. This allowed the director some time to flesh out the characters.

Overall it is a decent action movie, period. I know that with Marvel movies many of us are loving how connected the movies have become and how they lead into the others. This one does that as well, even though it is not part of Disney's property. Hugh Jackman owns this role as he has done so since the beginning and will do so again in the next Xmen movie (Days of Future Past) as well as having just signed on for another one two days ago. I am not a huge Xmen or Wolverine fan. Don't get me wrong, I like them okay, but I am not one to stand in line opening night. I was always more of a Batman fan with Thor as my all-time favorite comic book character. I can say though that I will be picking up the Extended Edition the week it comes out.

Although The Wolverine may have it's questionable moments in regards to the timeline of previous X-Men movies you can tell that Fox's main intentions were making an actual ""REAL"" Wolverine movie that most fans would be pleased with rather than the shameful ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"".

As some people may have mentioned above there a very emotional and heartfelt moments within the film and you really get a sense of feeling just how far Logan is willing to go for those of who he loves dearly. To not spoil a few surprises within the film I must say that the film ends with Logan being a totally changed person.

This film and ""Man of Steel"" were two of the best CBM we received this summer.

Rollicking fun!  In contrast, ""The Wolverine"" has an insipid plot where characters completely change their motivations in not-believable ways, and which feels like it had a dozen writers who'd barely met. <snore>",1383004800,,520,5.341463414634147
3610048,4,B001GCUO16,"Wolverine. He's the best he is at what he does, and what he does isn't very nice. That WAS true, until Hugh Jackman was cast to play him in Bryan Singer's original X-MEN from 2000. He's not the feral little furball people wanted, and oh, how the fanboys cried when they heard that he got his start in MUSICAL THEATRE!!! NOOOO!!! WHAT A PANSY WOLVERINE WILL BE!!

And how quickly they were proven wrong. In the first X-MEN film, we see that Jackman understood quickly exactly who Wolverine was, and with X2: X-MEN UNITED, we knew that there was at least one scene that could show how Jackman could properly portray not only the eternal outsider, but showed us how a berserker rage would look like on the big screen. The abysmal failure on every possible level of X-MEN THE LAST STAND and the well-intentioned but still very sub-par X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE had dragged the powerful mutant franchise down. But after the success of X-MEN FIRST CLASS, Fox felt that it was time to give the audience what it was looking for: The definitive Wolverine story. And with director James Mangold (COPLAND, 3:10 TO YUMA) at the helm, and basing their story largely on what is considered by many to be THE best Wolverine story in comics form (1985's four-issue mini-series by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller), they were able to achieve something seemingly impossible. They made THE WOLVERINE, and this is the best film of the MANY superhero films that the summer of 2013 yielded.

At its essence, THE WOLVERINE is a noirish romance thriller. Logan, haunted by having to kill his great love Jean Grey (Famke Janssen, who appears in dream sequences) at the end of X3, has become a recluse, living alone in the Canadian wilderness. He is found in the midst of an undesired bar brawl by Yukio (a dynamic performance by Rila Fukushima), a petite yet fierce warrior, to bring him to Japan at the behest of her adoptive grandfather Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi), a dying old man Logan saved back when the Americans bombed Hiroshima. Since then, Yashida has amassed a large fortune through his company, and offers Logan the one thing that he may truly want: mortality. It's something that Logan does not initially accept, but it is given nonetheless by Yashida's mysterious doctor, secretly the mutant Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova). It is then that Logan meets Mariko (Tao Okamoto), a beautiful young woman with an abusive and morally bankrupt husband. When Yashida dies, all hell breaks loose as the Yakuza and other criminal elements look to destroy the remainder of the Yashida clan. As Logan looks to defend those around him, he discovers all too quickly that his healing powers are no longer working properly. Logan and Mariko hide from the would-be assassins and they find love in the unlikeliest of places. But like all star-crossed lovers, they might have a very tragic ending if Logan, Yukio and Mariko can't get The Wolverine back.

First off, there is very little wrong with the film, but the things that are wrong with it are pretty glaring, and that revolves mostly around the climactic battle with Logan vs. a mecha-ed version of the Silver Samurai. It has really very little emotional stakes, and while very nice to look at, it seems to come out of nowhere. The smaller action beats are the ones that are far more effective and not only showcase Mangold's command of space and character, but they actually serve the STORY AND THE CHARACTERS, which is something not often seen in this current era of action films. The film is smart enough to be different enough from the classic storyline to give some cool surprises, but adheres to it enough to give us a pretty awesome WOLVERINE film. Aside from Jackman, who gives easily his best performance as Logan here, the other real standout of the cast is Rila Fukushima, as the manga-influenced Yukio. She's adorable, funny, smart and utterly lethal. The rest of the cast does commendable work with maybe the exception of Khodchenkova, but that's less to do with her work, and more to do with the script kind of short-changing her character (although if that role had been played by Jessica Biel, who was originally cast in the role, I'm sure that would have been a much more substantial character) The film is also assisted by its Japanese setting. It takes us out of a world we've become overly familiar with in superhero films, which is also a great change of pace. Another problem I do have with this film, though, is its distinct lack of bloodletting. Wolverine is a noble yet violent character; killing is part of who he is, and his claws do about the same amount of damage as in any of his Saturday morning cartoon iterations. Although it's rumored that the extended cut of this film will have more violent content than this PG-13 rated version, I wouldn't think that it would make a whole lot of difference. It would be nice, though, if at some point in the not-too-distant future that they went for the kind of eviscerations that would make Quentin Tarantino jealous.

When it's all said and done, though, thanks to a compelling story, terrific direction, a mostly smart script, and some terrific performances, THE WOLVERINE is the film that fans of the character deserved after the failure of X-MEN: THE LAST STAND and X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE... which, for some reason, is currently better rated on this site than this film.

3610055,4,B001GCUO16,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this after the last wolverine movie was absolute garbage, but surprisingly they have redeemed the character and brought him up to speed with a decent story and a good looking setting, the movie does have its weak points but no comic book movie is perfect for any of us, Hugh Jackman is probably at his best at playing the character since Xmen 2 at least and has certainly built himself up more physically, he is now surrounded by a very good supporting cast too and this time the story is much better, set several years after the last stand he has given up killing and his wolverine name and is still haunted by the death of his love Jean (who has many new dream sequence flashbacks etc) he is tracked down by a man who's life he saved and taken to Japan for one last dying wish then the trouble kicks off and Logan is thrown into a world of Japanese Yakuza, Ninjas, beautiful women and betrayal, from then on its plenty of ass kicking time with cool fight scenes and fun action pieces, great scenery, good soundtrack too to carry the action, the only real downer was the villain silver samurai, the story arc was very underused and the character could have been a lot better so you kind of get a great movie then a slightly weak ending but overall its great fun and you should just go with it, you won't get a better wolverine movie than this! Don't forget the after credit scene that sort of ties into the new Xmen Days of future past movie!! This movie is darker and grittier than previous comic book films which also sets it apart, he kills a lot of people!!

3610060,5,B001GCUO16,"The Wolverine was very enjoyable. It was smaller in scale than most ""superhero movies,"" and that's perfect because Logan is decidedly not a superhero and a Wolverine film ought not to resemble a ""superhero movie"". The physicality of the action sequences was fantastic. The casting was great. Hugh Jackman is still perfect for the role after twelve years, but the Japanese cast members really stole the show! Hiroyuki Sanada was brilliant as the wicked Shingen.

Of course, as a fan of Chris Claremont's original Wolverine solo story, there are some things I would have liked to have seen done differently with the story and character. However, considering that this is always the case with comic book inspired films, The Wolverine still does not disappoint.

For those interested in a more critical view, an interesting and thoughtful critique of The Wolverine can be found here: [...]

While I definitely enjoyed the film more than any other comic book movie in recent years, the author of the above review definitely brings up some aspects of the Wolverine character that could have been more present. Nevertheless, I highly recommend The Wolverine for any fan of the character or genre, or for anyone simply looking for an enjoyable and entertaining movie experience. The result is a movie that seems more deliberate and less erratic.

UPDATE: I am fortunate enough to have recently seen an advanced copy of the extended cut. It is definitely an improvement on what was already a uniquely interesting film. The extended cut features more dialog among the Japanese charachters, a few new scenes that help with the development of the characters and plot, and an much-extended version of Logan's fight against the Black Clan.",1381881600,12,1725,5.063380281690141

3610062,1,B001GCUO16,"What the heck is going on in Hollywood? I am sick and tired of these people who get millions to butcher different comic book canon so they can sale a movie to the masses. Let me count them off here...

1. Star Trek Into Darkness - The Khan character period. Magic blood? Single handidly kill dozens of Klingons and oh yeah, several Birds of Prey? Uhura and Spock?

2. Iron Man 3 - What the creators of this movie did to the Mandarin is a travesty. Hey, I have an idea, instead of making Tony battle alchoholism, lets give him PTSD and create some inner demons so he can battle with insignificance and mortality. Panic attacks caused by a little kid? Pepper potts is braver than Tony Stark.

3. Wolverine - The Silver Samurai is an adamantium robot? Wolverine loses his ability to heal and has to remember of find out what he is really made of? I thought this was stupid in Spider Man 2, I thought it was stupid in Iron Man 3, and it is stupid in Wolverine. Why strip a hero of his abilities to make him seem more human so we can relate better? We aren't supposed to relate, we are supposed to be amazed at what this mutant can do. NOT how he can overcome adversity because he has an inner struggle with humanity going on. Virus cause or whatever, it freaking does not matter.

I am tired of these writers taking liberties with all this canon and saying, well, the movie will sale better if we change this. Its ok if we completly change or erase a major villain from that hero's canon.",1381795200,14,1484,4.289285714285715

3610064,3,B001GCUO16,"""The Wolverine"" (2013) is the sixth ""X-Men"" film since Bryan Singer directed the first one in 2000, and the second film featuring Hugh Jackman's popular hero without the rest of the ""X-Men"" characters. (Actually, some of them return to the series, but about that, later.) What distinguishes the new installment from others is the exotic location of Japan, against which our reluctant hero has to have his own adventure.

Unfortunately, Logan / Wolverine's new adventure - written by Mark Bomback and Scott Frank, and directed by James Mangold - is not that exciting. Wolverine is summoned by an old acquaintance, Japanese soldier Mr. Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi) he once saved in Nagasaki during WWII. Yashida, now head of a big company, knows he is dying, and offers something unusual to Wolverine, who is ""cursed"" by immortality.

James Mangold did an acceptable job as director, though action scenes lack the style.  As a drama ""The Wolverine"" is unfocused because of its convoluted story and unconvincing motives of some characters. Some locations are effectively used, including the beautiful seaside district of Tomonoura, Fukuyama city, which stands in for Nagasaki, though the ""Japan"" here is a highly exaggerated one, something you will find only in Hollywood movies.

And that is fine with me, as long as characters are interesting. Some of the Marvel Comics characters (re-)appear in the film - Yashida's son Shingen (Hiroyuki Sanada, wasted), his daughter and Wolverine's love interest Mariko (Tao Okamoto), a female ninja Yukio (Rila Fukushima), Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) and Silver Samurai, as well as Jean Grey (Famke Janssen reprising the role) and two other familiar faces who should remain unnamed here - but none of them is really interesting with an exception of agile Yukio.

Thanks to Hugh Jackman (and his on-screen charisma and evident acting skills), ""The Wolverine"" is not boring. Action is entertaining but not inspired, and the film needs better characters and story.",1381708800,7,2000,5.276729559748428

The world didn't need this movie as Wolverines origin is satisfactorily given center stage in X2. While this is an entertaining diversion, theres nothing essential about this movie.

The filmmakers tried to pack as many references to the comic book series that it becomes distracting to those in the know. To those not, these references are wasted and only provide narrative clutter.

For the first time in his live Logan is vulnerable and is pushed to his limits to not only save himself but to save those around him and even The Wolverine is no match for what he has to face. First of all I will say that I liked the first X-men and loved First Class but wasn't a fan of the others so I wasn't really looking forward to this one all that much. I am also not a comic book fan. I say that for two reasons. First I know the movie is based off a comic story line so fans of that will love this movie. For the casual X-Men fan like me this is nothing like an X-Men movie at all. Again even though this is based off an actual comic plot the movie felt like; ""Let's make a samurai movie."" ""No one in America would watch one though"" ""Put Wolverine in it and they will."" Without trying to give anything away they could have done this movie with out the Wolverine character and it would have not changed anything. There is even a scene where he uses a Samauri sword to fight with instead of his claws...really. The best part of the movie is the little scene during the credits so be sure to watch that. Overall, this does not have the feel of an X-Men movie at all so if that's what you are looking for be warned. Comic book readers will love this though. I didn't.

The thing about me and Xmen movies, well movies in general (which is why I don't consider myself a film buff) once I see them in the theater, I very rarely get the opportunity or make a point to watch them again on DVD, steaming, VOD etc...  This always puts me at a disadvantage when it comes to a franchise film, cause I can't remember what the hell happened the last time we experienced these characters and stories.

Thankfully, all you really have to know to watch Hugh Jackman once again take on the role of Marvel Entertainment's ultimate anti-social hero - The Wolverine - is the basics.

makes him seem human. The story is paced well and flows through the two hours without dragging. The action scenes are great but the character
driven scenes are so much better.
I look forward to future chapters with this character and Logan on his journey. I was never a big X-Men comic book fan but
Hugh Jackman has created this character for those who never even read a comic and that is a credit to the devotion to his craft.
Even if you have never seen a previous X-men movie you will enjoy this one. It is a self contained story which reveals so much about the
character.

Overall a great fun film and I am glad I went to see it.
The ending was great and made me look forward to future adventures.",1377993600,,843,4.26875
3610114,4,B001GCUO16,"The X-Men films have always been kind of hit-or-miss, in my opinion. The first 2 installments are both really good (X2 the best out of the pair), but they seem underwhelming to me in a way, being a fan that watched other superhero films first, ones that were more recent and had more of a fanbase. As any fan knows, X3 failed to impress in almost every respect, only delivering fully action-wise and with a certain after- credits scene. First Class is definitely the best of the bunch, even though it does get fairly juvenile at times with the younger mutants' story lines. Origins was a spin-off film that still didn't reveal anything new about the character, and was a convoluted mess because of it, despite some great action scenes. And they have all done their part to confuse fans with the continuity errors and plot holes. However, even after all this, they are still very well done. They have some of the best casts ever assembled, and boast top-shelf special effects. This particular film is an excellent example of that. Jackman returns to the role that made him famous among American audiences, sharing the screen with a mostly foreign cast that still manages to hold its own. It is an adaptation of the comics' Japan Saga, but holds several surprises due to some worthwhile liberties taken. Logan finds himself in a dark place after the events of X3. He is basically just a wanderer, much like he was before the events of X1. He is asked to return to Japan as part of a favor for a man whose life he saved during World War II. Once he gets there, nothing proves to be as it seems. The country holds many enemies and a few friends for him, and he might just not come out of it alive. I say that with absolute seriousness. Due to a certain critical plot point, Wolverine might just lose what makes him a mutant and not be able to get it back. And I won't even talk about who Wolverine has been seeing in some very weird visions, because that would just be wrong. There is action, suspense, and tragedy aplenty. Jackman gives a terrific performance, finally being able to deliver on what Origins fell far short of doing - really figuring out the Wolverine character, emotionally, mentally, and physically. The only problem I had with the film is that the story required a certain amount of filling stuff in for myself, and some stuff that I had to ask others about afterwards. I should also mention that as far as continuity with the other films, this one acts as its own entity. It sidesteps all the controversy - taking place sometime after X3 - but no more specific than that. It also weaves in one of the better plot points from X3 as part of the story, and is all the better because of it. Since it is totally Wolverine's story, the other X-Men don't physically appear. Therefore, no one needs worry about overlapping plots or anything like that. As long as one is able to overlook the very minor disadvantages of the film, they will agree that it is a  great film, a great superhero movie, along with great performances by Jackman and his foreign co-stars.",1377907200,2,3070,4.531531531531532

3610131,5,B001GCUO16,"The Wolverine starts off a bit slow, but picks up once Logan makes it out of the woods to pick a fight with a few hunters who shot a bear with a poison-tipped arrow. After meeting up with a lady that says she needs him to go with her, Logan goes to Japan where he meets up with a dying man whom he had saved during WWII in Nagasaki after the US dropped the atomic bomb. Although Logan thinks that he was brought there to say his goodbyes, it is quickly revealed that the man has other intentions for him, wanting to take his power away in order to allow himself to live, and Logan to live a normal, mortal life. I won't go further as it gets a bit spoiler-ish after this, but the movie does have a nice pace at this point.

The movie has some nice fight scenes (especially the bullet train one), a wee bit of romance, and a more than decent plot as well. Overall, Origins: Wolverine (overlooking the Deadpool part) was probably a bit better better movie, with faster pacing and some interesting back-story behind Wolverine, along with some good characters to boot, but this, in no way, diminishes The Wolverine movie, which also adds more to the backstory of Wolverine and plays into a great set up. I will definitely be picking this up when it comes out (hopefully around $15, instead of the $21.99 it is at this point).

Hugh Jackman plays the part of Wolverine great as always and the other actors do quite a good job as well. Some of the translations seemed a bit off to me, but I don't know enough Japanese to translate it all off the cuff. There is a bit of a physics issue that shows up near the end of the movie (particularly what would happen when heated metal hits non-heated metal), but overall, there aren't any overbearing flaws that one might find in other X-Men movies (i.e. X-Men First Class, in terms of timeline) and it is quite enjoyable, especially if you like Wolverine as a character and the X-Men universe.

This was better then the other Wolverine movie. And although it carries on with Wolverine's storyline, the timeline is after X-Men: The Last Stand. So in order to understand the timeline and what happened to Jean Grey character, then you'd need to watch that movie. In all they've had 6 X-Men movies with 2 more promised. I'm not complaining. In fact, I think The Wolverine movie is doing well in keeping fans and newbies interested in the series. There was a lot of action and shirtless Hugh Jackman scenes. (My mom could've sworn she heard Hugh say in interviews that this movie was the last time he'd have the chance to be shirtless. I'm not sure if that's true or what). This movie was definitely worth seeing on the big screen. Having the movie take place in Japan was good with some nostalgia of my Navy day visits to Japan.

Rewatched it again on the theatrical release edition and I still love it.",1376697600,2,914,4.533333333333333
3610138,5,B001GCUO16,"The Wolverine is NOT like other x-men movies.  Or other superhero movies for that matter.  Rather than being a showcase of special effects and seeing how convincingly a city can be destroyed, this movie is the PERSONAL story of Wolverine.  It is a character driven movie, with plenty of action which is also used to move the plot forward.  This movie is great for those who like emotional drama, as well as those who like action or thriller movies.  The Japanese setting is also well used, as the culture and locations actually play significant roles in the movie.  There is romance and some light moments as well, though this is a fairly dark and gritty story.

I highly recommend you give this movie a chance.  It is artfully crafted; certainly enjoyable on a surface-level, but if you really read into it (maybe watch it a few times) you will also see just how well-crafted the movie is and how much thought went into it.

If he had died before the face off his powers would have been lost? Why did they go through all the trouble if all silver samurai armor had to do is grab wolverine and drill his bone marrow anyway?

3610146,3,B001GCUO16,"Let's see where do I start, how about with the simple fact, If you love Wolverine as a comic book character... this movie is not for you. Hugh Jackman makes a great Wolverine, I can't blame this movie's flaws on that. They make Wolverine out to be pretty weak without his healing factor and while that is part of his strengths it isn't all of them. Wolverine goes to japan, and doesn't know how to use a sword... flaw, He is a master of every martial art known on earth as well as a ex-special forces member. Second he speaks several languages, including Japanese, his first wife was Japanese, he should know it. Third he is not an idiot, he is rather clever and though he often relies on his healing factor for fighting, he would change his style without it, and resort to his agility and strength, which is more than enough for non-superheros. I can go on and on with the flaws but fans of his already know this.

If you are not a fan of his from comic books than this movie is quite a bit better, It has action, moderate plot etc. Pretty typical Marvel movie, and much, much better than Origins. NO this is not an X-men movie, and no Wolverine is not always an X-man he has been passed around to several marvel teams. He also has his own comic series, that's run pretty consistently. So do not think of this as an X-men movie. It doesn't belong in that despite Jean Grey's appearance.",1376352000,2,1387,4.334615384615384
3610147,3,B001GCUO16,"We like Wolverine. Apparently we really like him; ""The Wolverine"" is the sixth movie in which Hugh Jackman's played the character, which was created in 1974 by Len Wein and John Romita, Sr. (He was originally an enemy of the Hulk.) To understand why we like him so much, I think it's helpful to think back to 1974. America had just lost the war in Vietnam, thanks to the politicians despite winning all the battles (whether or not this is factually true, it was the general zeitgeist of the time.) We'd just found out our President was a crook, and forced him to resign. A lot of Americans had a lot of rage, a problem with authority, a hard time trusting anybody, but also a deep thirst for justice and revenge. We'd stopped believing the system was ever going to deliver it for us, and were ready to get it any way possible. We felt powerful, cheated, and pissed, and somebody needed to pay.

As Wolverine's popularity skyrocketed in the comic books, Clint Eastwood became one of the most popular stars in Hollywood playing a brooding cop with a big gun who always got the bad guy but had a hard time playing by the rules. There's a lot of Dirty Harry in Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine, and I'm still waiting for the movie that introduces Eastwood as Logan's long lost father.

""The Wolverine"" picks up where ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" left off, which is a bit of a stumble, because that movie was made 7 years ago and there have been two X-Men films since then. It took me a while to recapture the storyline: Logan killed Jean Grey, the woman he loved, because her alternate personality the Phoenix, was taking over and destroying everyone and everything around her.

Wolverine has fled to somewhere very wooded and become Grizzly Adams. He is haunted by dreams of Jean Grey, and promises never to hurt anyone again ever, a promise he keeps for about five minutes, until someone hurts one of his ursine friends. While he is beating up rednecks, a pink-haired Japanese ninja girl (Rila Fukushima) finds him and begs him to come to Tokyo, where a man he once saved is dying, and wants to say goodbye.

Logan agrees, and somehow never suspects that the man he is going to see-- billionaire tech giant Yashida, played by Haruhiko Yamanouchi -- might have an ulterior motive for bringing him across the ocean. Logan gets embroiled in a complicated, nearly incoherent family controversy, wherein the Yakuza are trying to assassinate the old man's granddaughter, except maybe they're hired by the pretty girl's father, who's mad that he's not mentioned in the old man's will, except maybe not, because there's also a playboy fianc&eacute;e with political ambitions and a jilted boyfriend with lots of ninja friends, and maybe the old man's not quite as dead as he appears.
I don't know if it all makes sense. I don't feel like wasting the brainpower it would take to untangle it all and see if it makes sense. What it all boils down to is that Logan is going to protect the pretty granddaughter (Tao Okamota) because she's pretty and vulnerable and likes to kiss him. And a lot of people want to kill her, some with guns and some with swords and some with poison-tipped arrows, and it's not all that important who sent them, or why.

""The Wolverine's"" convoluted plot, as well as an airless, joyless third act where everything is explained but nothing makes sense, are the film's weaknesses. But it has plenty of strengths. The film is strong on atmosphere and aesthetics, and director James Mangold knows how to make the most of his Japanese settings. It's packed to the brim with exciting action sequences, including one aboard a bullet train sequence bears more than a passing resemblance to the space suit action sequence in ""Star Trek: Into Darkness."" I don't say that to disrespect it; these two are probably the best two action sequences in movies this summer.

This is as much a samurai film as a superhero film, and that's pretty cool. Svetlana Khodchenkova has a lot of fun playing sexy villainess Viper, who likes to wear green, scaly tight-fitting things and kills people by kissing them with her acidic, forked tongue. She's not really given enough to do and her death is anticlimactic, but the Russian actress makes the most of what the script and the screen time give her.

Also, she has the unexplained ability to take away Wolverine's healing factor, rendering him killable. The script makes the most of this, and Jackman's meets them halfway; the result is a protagonist who isn't invulnerable (like Superman and Thor,) but seems genuinely surprised by how much being hurt, well, hurts. Logan briefly contemplates letting himself be killed, so that he can join Jean Grey (and the countless other people he's watched die over his 200-year lifespan) in the afterlife. But there's the ing&eacute;nue to save from the bad guys. Sigh... seems like there's always an ing&eacute;nue to save from the bad guys. Superheroes never get a chance to spend quality time with their loved ones, dead or alive. It's a tough life.

I wonder if, as an audience, we'll ever grow tired of Wolverine. 1974 was a long time ago, and it's been a while since we nearly impeached a president or lost a war. I suppose there's always plenty to be angry about, but successful, entertaining and even humorous movies featuring more brightly colored, optimistic superheroes - guys like Iron Man, Thor and Captain America - make me think the age of the dark, angsty protagonist may finally be coming to an end. There's another X-Men movie in the works (make sure to stick through the credits to see the teaser for ""Days of Future Past"") but maybe after that, Jackman can hang up the claws once and for all. I've enjoyed the Wolverine movies -- most of them -- but don't really feel like I need any more of them.",1376352000,2,5790,4.697536945812808

*************************

What is it about Wolverine movies that makes writers and directors want to overcomplicate them, or fiddle with pulp perfection? Here's how you make a Wolverine movie:

1. Have Wolverine act gruff.
2. Have Wolverine hand-stab the crap out of a bunch of bad guys.
3. Don't change characters who don't need to be changed, and don't add a bunch of unnecessary characters from other comics who don't have a whole lot to do with Wolverine.

That's it!! How hard is that, really? And yet this is the second time that the seemingly simple task of making a good Wolverine has been mucked up by bad writing and unnecessary flourishes. In this instance, the failure is even more painful because, for the first 3/4ths of its running time, The Wolverine is a terrific little action movie. Hugh Jackman has never been better in the role, nailing once and for all that tricky mix between soulfulness and savagery that makes Logan who he is. He wasn't overplaying the tough guy, nor was he the prone-to-tears Wolvie that has been seen in other films in the X franchise. The action was pretty brutal and, I think, pushed the PG-13 rating to its limit. The performers were all game and capable actors. What I really like about The Wolverine is the lack of bombast found in the other X-Men films. This film is lean, quiet in parts. Some of its scenes (particularly the ones where Mariko and Logan simply talk like two human beings might) wouldn't be out of place in a typical arthouse movie. And then, of course, the final 20 minutes throws all of that hard work right out the window.

Ohhhh, that ending. It seems like filmmakers who tackle a Wolverine film just can't manage to stick the landing. The script basically falls off a cliff and lands back in X-Men Origins: Wolverine territory; what was a pretty good, character-driven action movie becomes a mishmash of superhero noise and mayhem, misused characters (not quite as bad as Deadpool in the Origins movie, but pretty damn bad) and plot developments that make not a lick of sense.

Now for those who aren't aware, the main elements of The Wolverine's story were loosely based on the legendary 1982 miniseries by Chris Claremont & Frank Miller. It's a nearly perfect, self-contained story about Wolverine taking on the Yakuza in Japan to save the woman he loves and his journey of self-discovery along the way, among other things. I was thrilled when I first heard they were adapting the story for this sequel. When I went to see this movie, I knew the story would not be presented unaltered, and while that was initially disappointing, I was won over and I began to appreciate the movie for what it was, rather than what it wasn't, which is rare for me as a comic book fan who's seen many a faithless film adaptation. As the final reel started to roll, though, The Wolverine took all of that goodwill and burned it like a guy lighting a cheap stogie with a $50 bill. That's the kind of whiplash that this movie gave me.

Here's my final word on The Wolverine: watch the first 3/4ths, then just pretend Logan saved the day right then and there after defeating ninjas in the snowy village. Then, fast forward to the end scene between Logan and Mariko--no idiotic final fight required. (Definitely stay for the post-credits scene!) Otherwise, you may find yourself regretting your decision to get so invested in what is, until that last fatal stumble, a nearly-great movie.

3.5 stars out of 5, rounded up to 4 stars.

3610151,5,B001GCUO16,I've seen this movie before but I wanted to own it and I found it for a great price on amazon. It's a great movie.,1376179200,,114,3.6
3610152,4,B001GCUO16,"Perhaps ""Wolverine 3"" would be a better title considering all the times we have seen Jackman in this role. The film opens with a flashback dream within a flashback dream as Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) continues playing Jeremiah Johnson. He is persuaded to go to Japan by Yukio (Rila Fukushima) to pay his last respects. While in Japan, Wolverine encounters Viper woman (Svetlana Khodchenkova) his ""Kryptonite,"" and gets involved in a plot that gave me flashbacks to fine films like ""Toxic Avenger II"" and ""Nazis at the Center of the Earth.""

The plot had more complexity than what I expected or wanted to see. The action scenes were shot by shaking the camera at odd angles so we could feel the intensity. Instead I thought ""Why the low budget effect?"" The film started out with some comedy and dark comedy, but that aspect quickly died when they went to Japan.

Considering the fine Avenger/Mutant films that have come out, this one was a let down. Film seems to have been designed to introduce Yukio.

Worth a rental. Most likely I will buy it since I own all the other ones, but I will wait for the big price drop.

3610153,5,B001GCUO16,"I admit that 2009's ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" started out pretty shaky with the cartoony action sequence after the opening credits (Stryker's force raiding a facility in Nigeria), but the film found its footing and kicked total axx. I like it for the most basic reason people like movies: The story and its characters pulled me in and kept my attention; I was entertained, pure and simple. How so?

For one thing, the movie effectively accomplished precisely what it set out to do - unveil Wolverine's origin. It shows Logan's early family, however brief; it establishes his relationship with his brother, Victor; it shows his participation in all the American wars since the Civil War in an excellent opening credits sequence; it establishes his relationship with Stryker and the US government; it shows his inner conflict between universal morality and being an animalistic killing machine; it establishes his capacity for true love and heroism (Kayla and the old couple, as well as going back to save the mutants at the end); it shows how his bones became reinforced with adamantium; it effectively shows how he lost his memory; and why he's known as Logan/Wolverine.

This isn't some mindless action/CGI flick with little dramatic valleys or depth, as some have criticized. As just noted, the film starts out with a dramatic sequence from Logan's youth and proceeds with the dramatic montage of various wars during the opening credits. This effectively sets the tone that ""Wolverine"" is a serious superhero film, like the three X-Men films before it. From there we get touching moments with Kayla, both early in the story and later; as well as dramatic lulls with Victor, Stryker, the old couple, the black guy in New Orleans (I forget his name), Gambit, Cyclops and Professor X.

As far as depth goes, we get Wolvie's intense struggle between flesh and spirit, which we can all relate to one way or another - will he selfishly and greedily use his powers to be a moral-less killing machine at Stryker's beck & call or will he use his powers for the good of humanity? Will he take the high pay from the government or will he be content making $18,500 as a lumberjack? We also get his discovery of love with a moving relationship with Kayla, his later struggle with betrayal, and then understanding and forgiveness for Kayla's plight (her concern for her sister). Not to mention a certain character's powerful admission of genuine love at the end. Furthermore we get Victor's headfirst plunge into lawlessness with zero respect for life other than his own but then - surprisingly - evidence that he still possesses a sense of loyalty to his blood kin. This shows that even one of the main villains isn't one-dimensional. In addition, near the end we see Cyclops as a boy trusting the still small voice he hears somewhere within, which leads to salvation and Xavier, an obvious type of the Holy Spirit or what have you.

One aspect I really liked was the build-up of mystery regarding Stryker's ""island"" lab for mutant experimentation. When Wolvie & Gambit fly over it and it's location is finally revealed it's a thrilling revelation. From there the final act just builds to an explosive climax with the creative destruction of something, the deliverance of the mutants and the revelation of how Logan completely lost his memory.

As far as all the criticism about Wolvie's claws, particularly in the bathroom scene, so they look a little cartoony, so what? They're obviously a reflection of the comic medium of which the film is adopting.

Let me end by addressing some other common criticisms:

The helicopter explosion: This was thrown-in for the explosion and simply to show Wolvie's ultra-coolness. Logan would have no concern about the explosion due to his mutant healing factor; after over 150 years - so many wars and so many mortal wounds - such an experience was now mundane.

The dialogue in the non-action scenes: I thought a lot of this dialogue was witty and busted out laughing 7-10 times during the film. As far as the verbiage being weak, it's a Wolverine flick where most of the characters are warriors or kids, not James Fenimore Cooper.

Kayla's moon parable: This was worth it just for the hilarious ""Koo-koo-ka-choo"" line and I found it a very creative touch. Not only does the legend link to Logan & Kayla's relationship, including Logan accusing her of being the ""trickster"" later in the film, it provides Logan his namesake, Wolverine! In short, it wasn't some worthless tale thrown in just to show Kayla was Native American.

Criticisms about Deadpool: The movie is showing Deadpool's FIRST appearance only; after all, it's ""X-Men ORIGINS."" As far as his twirling head and the laser eyes destroying the tower - how awesome and creative! Film is a visual medium and they knocked it out of the park with this one. As for Deadpool being silenced, stick around for the post-credits scene.

The bullet to the brain: This was the perfect way to explain Logan's complete memory loss. Think about it: Being shot in the brain is the closest to death Logan would ever come, but his healing factor kicked in and renewed the damaged brain tissue. His restored brain would be as good as new, but with Logan's memory wiped clean.

The inclusion of mutant kids as hostages supposedly just for the fun of putting names there: The movie's called ""Wolverine"" so it focuses mainly on him, but it's also called ""X-Men Origins"" and so naturally details the very beginning of the X-men. I enjoyed seeing Cyclops as a kid in the film, but I'm glad they didn't take the focus off Wolvie by getting bogged down with Cyclops' story or anyone else's.

3610154,3,B001GCUO16,"Wolverine was a good movie, but I just wanted to ask the producers and directors one question. *SPOILER ALERT*  Were the ninjas' swords made of adamantium?  Because Wolverine's claws would have cut right through them, and throughout the whole movie they were able to fight him face on with their swords.  I thought adamantium was a rare metal.  Why would a bunch of foot soldiers be worth holding on to adamantium?  Just food for thought.",1376092800,,438,4.786666666666667
3610155,3,B001GCUO16,"""The Wolverine"" (2013) takes place after ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men-The-Last-Stand-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000HCO83Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men: The Last Stand (Widescreen Edition)</a>"" (2006) and focuses on Logan in Japan. It's reminiscent of Chris Claremont & Frank Miller's original 1982 4-part Wolverine miniseries.

Like that miniseries, the film is very atypical for comic book superheroes. It plays out more like a James Bond flick, sort of a modern version of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/You-Only-Live-Twice/dp/B000NIBUS0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">You Only Live Twice</a>"", than a conventional superhero flick. Logan (Hugh Jackman) never appears in an outlandish costume, nor do any other characters, except Viper, and hers isn't all that outlandish.

The beginning is great -- the World War II prologue and the Yukon sequences. I also enjoyed the Japanese locations and culture, as well as the focus on drama mixed with stellar bouts of comic book action. Unfortunately, I found the story only moderately interesting, which is the main reason I rate the film as mediocre as I do. It just isn't all that captivating.

I really liked the character of Yukio (Rila Fukushima), and Hiroyuki Sanada makes a quality antagonist, but I found Mariko (Tao Okamoto) and Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) rather bland. The Silver Samurai also appears in an armored suit a la Iron Man or War Machine and comes across as typical for this type of fare.

In addition, Famke Janssen appears as Jean Grey. She's fine in the role, but she never tripped my trigger. The best lookin' woman in the entire film, believe it or not, is the cashier who talks to Logan briefly in Yukon.

I'll be honest with you, I thought 2009's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men-Origins-Wolverine/dp/B002K99P7S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men Origins: Wolverine</a>"" was better than this one. Despite the cartoony opening, it had more depth and was way more compelling. Still, ""The Wolverine"" is a solid depiction of Wolverine's adventures in Japan.

The film runs 2 hours and 6 minutes.

3610156,5,B001GCUO16,I really enjoyed the movie and I was doing some online interweb paroosing and came across a couple sites that quoted James Mangold as saying that an unrated version may be released on blue ray.  However it doesn't look like this blue ray version includes anything unrated.  Can someone shed some light on this for me?  Thanks.,1376092800,3,326,4.684210526315789

I would recommend renting it if you're interested.  A convoluted story with not much action lowered the score for me, but as always, Hugh Jackman does an excellent job as Wolverine.  It seems like this movie was just a place-holder between X-Men: The Last Stand and the next X-Men movie (which is teased 1/2 way through the end credits).

3610164,5,B001GCUO16,"is this a mind blowing, cerebral, emotionally twisted block buster? no, and i don't know why anyone would expect it to be.

it's wolverine slicing his way through japan, embroiled in a feud between the family of a man he saved during WW II and yakuza. there are a lot of really fun characters and very fun action scenes and

*possible spoiler?*

he doesn't have his regenerate power for a chunk of the film!!! it's crazy and really exciting.

*end possible spoiler*

the only critique i would give it is that they missed a huge opportunity. in the old cartoon and comics wolverine always finds mental peace in japan due to zen buddhism. they should have tossed in a scene where he is losing his mind and finds relief through learning meditation or something. in the old cartoon for example he loses his inhibitions about killing and nearly kills jubilee. he even says, in a therapy session with professor x ""i can't feel anything! even animals care about each other!"" a pretty serious problem, then he goes to japan and works and lives in a temple where he meditates and finds peace until silver samurai attacks.

it's a plot point that should have been in the movie. one of those things where it's like ""they're never going to do a wolverine in japan movie ever again, so that's never going to be on the big screen.""

other than that though, really fun! and the fact that that scene is missing is not all that important because without prior knowledge of this happening in the show/comics one would not miss it so it does not detract from the plot or anything.

finally i'll say: i thought x men origins wolverine was better.

i know that's crazy, no one agrees. this movie would get 4 and 3/4 stars and origins would get 5 from me but amazon doesn't have it set up for me to rate it like that. and even then it's a pretty minute difference. i just found the scope of origins exciting, it covers so much ground and this movie is almost totally confined to one story in japan.",1375920000,,1976,4.466666666666667

Bought into the whole Prime thing, and many things are received within that 2-day timeframe.  The problem is Amazon NEVER explains these things.  They take your money though!

3610166,5,B001GCUO16,"Hugh Jackman & Company get it right and deliver it all so well with this movie.  They've stayed true to who Wolverine is as a character and incorporate just the right balance of extreme action with surprising plot twists & turns that keep you guessing.  I anticipated being disappointed with the train sequence b/c we had just seen an extremely well done 'fighting on a train' scene in one of the earlier Spiderman movies - but they did it well enough in this movie that it didn't matter.  In the wrong hands, Wolverine could be as flat as Superman was in the most recent iteration of that franchise.  But Hugh is able to find the various shades of humanity within his character and express it in this film--there is humor here, depression, loneliness, nobility, guilt, the hope for redemption and FUN.  I have no idea why people feel obligated to trash Origins-- that movie was also great.",1375920000,2,890,4.643312101910828
3610167,4,B001GCUO16,"When I first heard of plans to release another standalone Wolverine film, my initial reaction was why? X-Men Origins: Wolverine mostly mangled the mythology of its characters and, though Hugh Jackman carried the film well, it was ultimately a clunky, second-rate experience with one of the fakest looking final fights I've seen in a modern blockbuster (see Wolverine's battle with Deadpool, or don't for that matter). Furthermore, though it included a priceless cameo by Jackman, the fantastic X-Men: First Class seemed to take the franchise in a bit of a different direction. As a result, I was thoroughly surprised by the return to a solo Wolverine venture for the series' next outing. That being said, The Wolverine (they seem to be taking hints from The Fast and the Furious franchise with these titles... next up: Wolverine!) is for the most part the film Origins should have been. Smartly, The Wolverine tackles the title character almost exclusively, learning from the mistakes of Origins and limiting the number of other mutants to a select few. Though we get a few flashbacks here and there, this is also not an origin story, instead following Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to Japan after he is summoned by the dying CEO of a major tech corporation (Hal Yamanouchi), whom he saved from the atomic bombing of Nagasaki. Quickly, Wolverine becomes embroiled in the family's power struggle and must go on the run with the CEO's daughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) from Yakuka thugs and the viciously seductive mutant Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova).

  Solid performances all around ground The Wolverine, particularly from Jackman in all of his vascular glory, Okamoto, and Fukushima, who plays the expert swordswoman Yukio (almost needlessly turned into a mutant for this outing). The only character I didn't really buy was that of Viper, who's basically Poison Ivy + shedding... she just wasn't that strong of a villain. On the other hand, James Mangold, director of great dramas like Walk the Line and 3:10 to Yuma, has a fantastic grip on the dramatic side of the film, imbuing it with a sense of reality and a dark edge. Furthermore, the action sequences are pretty impressive. Though the film didn't end up with the R-rating it was on the verge of getting, Wolverine's numerous encounters with sword-toting ninjas and Yakuza thugs make for tense, visceral, and incredibly staged action sequences. Wolverine's loss of his regenerative capabilities, something that could have gone awry if handled incorrectly, only ups the stakes during these sequences.

  What's also great is that The Wolverine is an almost entirely self-contained story, taking the character to a new environment with new characters. That being said, though, The Wolverine doesn't ignore what's come before it. Since brooding anti-hero is the new cool, Wolverine struggles with more than a few of his own demons. Effectively, anyone who's ever meant anything to him is gone at the close of X-Men: The Last Stand, so Logan is haunted by visions of Jean Grey and tortured by the events of The Last Stand. As are we all. A fanboy geek-out moment after the end credits also ties the The Wolverine into X-Men: Days of Future Past., so be sure to stick around for it. Though suffering from the usual plot-holes, The Wolverine is still miles better than X-Men Origins: Wolverine and functions well as a nice, focused solo outing to placate the ravenous fan in you eagerly awaiting Days of Future Past. I can only wonder, though, what the brilliant Darren Aronofsky would have done with this film had he stayed on to direct.

See it:  If you have any affinity for the Wolverine character or the X-Men franchise as a whole, for The Wolverine is a worthy addition to that cinematic canon and a thrilling bit of summer fun, albeit one that lacks a particularly strong central villain and climax.

Pass:  If sharp objects and bone claws aren't your thing, or if you're a staunch conservative when it comes to how Hollywood adapts your favorite, comic book story-lines.

The first Wolverine solo film kept you engaged because you wanted to see where it all began; this movie's plot was ridiculously boring and predictable, not to mention pointless. There are some good fight scenes with a bunch of drivel in between, a lot of yawn moments in fact that had me looking at my watch. The Viper was a forgettable villian, just a cliche evil sexy villian chic. The only interesting character was the little asian ninja girl who was just awesome.

3610171,5,B001GCUO16,"In brief, I highly recommend this film. It is very different from Origins and in my opinion far, far, far superior. Beautifully shot, wonderfully directed, with a compelling, mysterious story and a brilliant cast. The Japan setting (most of the film) lends a unique sense of stylization. There are a couple of high-concept plot elements that may be a bit of a stretch, but I do not mind, because the characters and personal moments are so strong. The pacing is great, and the film builds to an intense climax.

I keep seeing apologies made for the ""lack of action"" - I can only think that the reference is to ""action"" in terms of wild CGI and buildings exploding. Because this film has the best action of any comic book/superhero film that I have ever seen, but much of it is in the form of hand-to-hand combat. The fight choreography is dazzling, and it feels a lot more real than anything in The Avengers. Logan using his claws to duel against combatants with katana swords? What an awesome concept, and that is just one example. This is a fantastic action film that fortunately balances that dynamic out with plenty of heart and character driven content as well.

3610175,4,B001GCUO16,"The Wolverine retraces the steps of its title character from World War II to the present day, with ghosts of his past haunting him in the forms of a flawless (even if she is dead) Jean Grey and a Japanese soldier he saved from nuclear obliteration in Nagasaki. Standard Marvel Studios fare, really, but who can argue with a movie starring Marvel's most short-tempered human weapon?

Hugh Jackman has got to be taking a pounding from playing Logan all these years. And though his face looks far too old to play such an ageless character, the rest of his body is in fantastic shape. Though many people may not be familiar with his co-stars, they all shine in the film which takes place in Tokyo and Nagasaki. Logan's main rivals in the film are Viper, a biochemist with a wicked kiss and an immunity and intimate knowledge of toxins, played by the gorgeous Svetlana Khodchenkova (from the European film Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, 2011); and the scheming son of the Yashida empire, Shinigen, portrayed by Hiroyuki Sanada, son of the soldier he saved in Nagasaki almost a century ago. Asian model Tao Okamoto portrays Shinigen's daughter, Mariko, heir to the largest corporation in Asia, and Yukio, who has the ability to forsee a person's death, played by Rila Fukushima who has only appeared in one short film before this blockbuster.

Given that most of the screen time is held by actors and actresses who have had very little relative experience, one might assume that The Wolverine is worth passing on. I think that the crew over at Marvel Studios learned their mistakes from X-Men Origins: Wolverine, however, and have brought together a tight, compelling story, even if its action scenes (the bullet train scene, in particular) do seem a little like Wire-Fu. When you watch it (and you will... you know you will) stay tuned after the credits for a scene introducing next year's obligatory X-Men flick, Days of Future Past, a two minute snippet that brings back Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart in a scene that, from start to finish, made the comic geek inside me squeal with glee.",1375660800,2,2083,4.783333333333333
3610176,4,B001GCUO16,"Is 2013's The Wolverine the Wolverine film fans had hoped for, but didn't get in 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine? The answer to that question is a resounding yes. With the success of X-Men: First Class and Fox's desire to create their own comic book film universe like Marvel and Disney are doing Fox smartly made smarter choices with The Wolverine. Fox wisely decided to chose a better director in the flawed, but solid director James Mangold as well smartly basing the films storyline off of the acclaimed writers Frank Miller and Chris Claremont's Wolverine mini-series, and what we get is a flawed and methodically paced film that is fun, exciting, and the second best comic book film of the year.

The Wolverine is based off of Chris Claremont and Frank Miller's four issue limited Wolverine series, and one of Wolverine's better storyline revolving around Mariko Yashida (Tao Okamoto) who perhaps Logan's greatest love of his life. Being the fan of the character and storyline this is the storyline I had wanted for a Wolverine besides Logan's origins, and the writers delivered. The film opens up sometime after the ending of X-Men: The Last Stand. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) has been killed by Logan's own hands, and now Logan (Hugh Jackman) lives as a hermit in the mountains content to live a solitary life with his friendly grizzly bear neighbor, and his dreams of Jean. Logan should have known he isn't destined to live of hermit, and his found by Yukio (Rila Fukushima) in a small mountain Canadian town, where she tells him Ichir Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi) the man he saved back in World War II from a nuclear blast is now dying and wishes to see Logan. In Japan, Yashida offers Logan want he has come to secretly desire in a way to die. There he meets Mariko, Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova), Shingen Yashida (Hiroyuki Sanada) and others as Logan is betrayed and reluctantly gets involved in a family feud.

While I did enjoy the storyline of The Wolverine I think I need to talk about my problems with the plot. First is the character Kenuichio Harada who is perhaps my biggest issue with the plot. Anyone who has read the comics knows that Harada is the Silver Samurai as well as a mutant, and because of the choice by Fox, Mangold, and the writers not make Harada the Silver Samurai it just makes the character seem out of place in the film, and that Harada didn't really belong in the film at all. All my other issues with The Wolverine's plot are small ones like the lack of screen time for Viper. Instead of focusing on the now pointless Harada Mangold should had focused more on Viper. The other flaw was the dream sequences between Logan and Jean Grey. While I understand why they were added I just thought there were too many of them, and the only one that truly stood out was the final scene between Logan and Jean, which I thought was exceptional. Still even with the flaws in the plot the good outweighed the bad. I loved the chemistry between Logan and Yukio. Yukio is Logan's comrade and friend in the comics, and I feel the writers did do the character justice with her sense of humor and martial arts skills, but more importantly I loved the chemistry between Logan and Mariko. Mariko was well written, and very similar to the comics as are her feeling for Logan. Logan is a haunted man by both the things he has done and the people he has lost, so I loved how the writers showed Logan's haunted side. I'm sure it is not easy being a man who will basically live forever never aging or dying while all the people he loves and cares about are killed or whither and die, and the writers along with Mangold and Jackman do a wonderful job displaying that for the audience to see.

Not all fans were happy with the choice of Hugh Jackman back in the first X-Men film. Fans didn't like the appearance of Jackman. He didn't have the same build and was too tall the critics cried, but I didn't a problem with the changes made to Logan's appearance as long as it was done well, and over five films plus a cameo appearance I think Jackman has proved his critics wrong. Jackman has done a splendid job embodying the character of Logan whether it being his ruthless side or emotional side to the characters mannerisms and style of speech, Jackman has done an excellent job portraying the character as he does here in The Wolverine. Besides Jackman doing another great job as Logan the Japanese cast did a splendid job in their roles as well. Hiroyuki Sanada who also gave wonderful performances in Sunshine and The Last Samurai gives another good performance as Shingen Yashida the son of Ichir Yashida, and father to Mariko who lets his ambition and desire for power get the better of him. Both Yukio and Mariko are portrayed by young and basically first time actresses, and you wouldn't know it unless you looked it up. Rila Fukushima personality and appearance fit the role of Yukio perfectly, while the beautiful Japanese model turned actress Tao Okamoto did a truly exceptional job with her performance with Mariko. Okamoto perfectly embodied the beautiful and strong willed Mariko as well as her love for Logan. The chemistry between Okamoto and Jackman was excellent throughout the film and especially at the love hotel, which was sweet and funny, and their time together at the home near Nagasaki, Japan, which was heartfelt and emotional. I hope to see both actresses more in the future. Just like Fukushima and Okamoto, Svetlana Khodchenkova is a relative unknown, and besides not having enough screen time Khodchenkova did a good job portraying the villain Viper.

James Mangold is a quality director and writers has he has shown in the likes of 3:10 to Yuma, Walk the Line and Cop Land and continues to do a good job directing here in The Wolverine except for the action sequences. Maybe it is the editing of the film to get a better runtime and a pg-13 rating or maybe it is because Mangold didn't know how to direct a comic book film styled action sequence, but with the exception of an outstanding action sequence on a bullet train none of the action sequences truly stand out. It's not that they are bad, because they weren't bad. The action sequences were entertaining; it's just that the majority of the action sequences just weren't riveting or memorable.

Fox has definitely gotten what it wanted here with The Wolverine. The film is flawed, but has good character writing and dramatic scenes as well as good direction by Mangold and decent action, and more importantly for Fox, The Wolverine expands Fox's X-Men universe has well as teasing us with the upcoming X-Men: Days of Futures Past. Yes there is a mid-credit scene and it was great. The scene between the three characters is a good lead into next year's X-Men film. The Wolverine is the film fan boys have wanted that will both satisfy fans of the comic and character as well as the ordinary viewer.

This new Wolverine film had me at the edge of my seat the entire time. I get bored fast with films, being a screenwriter as well as filmmaker, I can usually foresee the entire film. Star Trek was okay but a let down for me, Man of Steel felt like it had too much endless action, Iron Man 3 felt forced at times, The Wolverine though was the highlight of the summer for me. I found myself lost inside the narrative, and as great films do, forgot that I was in a theater watching a film and simply experienced the film. Of course this film was made by the same director as the new 3:10 to Yuma, and Walk the Line, so if you enjoyed those films, you'll probably like this one. This film is a great character bridge also from X3 and into X-men Days of Future past, which releases next year. It's not directly connected, but presents Wolverines transition as a lost soul to finding a purpose. The only things you really need to k ow about X-Men to watch this film is that at the end of X3 he killed a woman he loved because she was killing others and lost control of her powers, he had his bones covered in an industrucible metal, and that Wolverine has a healing power and has also been alive for about 200 years.",1375660800,5,1383,4.164179104477612
3610180,3,B001GCUO16,"With its modern-day sensibilities and philosophical and moral questions about genetics, the ""X-Men"" comic series has always been tailor-made for a movie treatment. Of its cast of characters, perhaps the most untapped is Wolverine (Hugh Jackson), who is practically immortal and indestructible.  He's the most physically capable of the X-Men, the most experienced, and the least likely to die, so you can pretty much drop Wolverine into any plot.  And that's how we've finally arrived at ""The Wolverine,"" which is basically Wolverine vs. ninjas.  It's about time.

The plot challenge for scriptwriters is his level of power.  Although Wolverine isn't say, Thor or Hulk, he's almost impossible to kill, which means the audience isn't particularly vested in his survival.  This is brought home in the first few minutes of the film when Wolverine survives an atomic blast at Nagasaki. Yashia (Haruhiko Yamanouchi), the officer he saves, propels the plot. Yashida has become CEO of a massive technology corporation, and he sends mutant Yukio (Rila Fukushima) for a deal on his deathbed:  an exchange of Wolverine's immortality to let the old man live and end Logan's torment over the death of his one true love, Jean Grey (a radiant Famke Janssen).  Wolverine turns him down of course, but not before becoming embroiled in Japan's underworld politics over Yashida's estate between ninjas and yakuza with Yashida's granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) in the middle.  And it's about this point in the film when Wolverine gets ""de-powered"" to make things interesting.

Wolverine suddenly discovers he's only ""nigh-invulnerable"" to use a term from ""The Tick"": He can still feel pain even if it doesn't kill him. This amps up the action as Wolverine gets shot, stabbed, sliced, and punched by Yakuza thugs and ninjas in a variety of interesting locations: on rooftops, in trains, and on the rooftops of high-speed trains.  It's thrilling stuff.

Unfortunately it can't last.  The Big Bad reveal isn't much of a twist, and the final villain is  a hilariously over-the-top slice of comic cheesiness. It's no coincidence that this shift happens along with Wolverine back to his old self -- which is a shame.  Wolverine just a little weaker makes him that much more interesting.

Wolverine isn't a chatty character, and although his sequences with Jean Grey certainly help to give some poignancy to a loner who would otherwise brood silently, there's only so much to work with.  The other characters just circle his orbit, including a badly dubbed Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) whose skintight green cat suit and whack-a-doo powers (she has a poison tongue! a poison kiss! sometimes you die -- but not always!) feels forced in an otherwise tonally Japanese film that's willing to use subtitles for the majority of its dialogue.

""The Wolverine"" has claws, but they're not adamantium. It's a step up for ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" but it's not quite as sharp as ""X-Men: First Class.""  And also...ninjas.",1375660800,2,2988,5.161825726141079

It has major differences than the comics which was disappointing considering that it was based on a specific storyline of the Wolverine character.

In my opinion X-Men, X2, X Men the Last Stand, and X-Men Origins:Wolverine were all better movies but this is better X-men First Class.

3610182,3,B001GCUO16,"Not a terribly bad movie but it is slow from beginning to end where it picks up a bit but left me wondering what the writers, producers, and director had in mind because I was lost from beginning to end.

I never read the comics as a kid so I don't know the detailed story that most of you have with Marvel Universe so please bear with me if you think I'm being too critical of this movie.

It starts out borrowing the storyline from the '70s TV show Grizzley Adams which I enjoyed; since I really enjoyed that TV show as a kid from what I can remember of it, just wondering if the bear in this movie was named Ben like the one in the TV show.

As for the atom bomb scene, I can believe Wolverine would survive the blast (under Marvel Universe rules) but the Japanese soldier he sheltered from the blast would have been cooked to a crisp since he had no Mutant super powers, no doubt.  I know it's science fiction, but keep it believable from the real-life aspects that apply, that way you're not insulting the intelligence of the audience for the sake of entertainment value.  It reminded me of the ridiculous scene from the beginning of the last Indiana Jones movie where he survives a nuclear blast from ground zero by hiding in a lead-lined refrigerator.  The lead may have sheltered him from the radiation but the heat from the blast would have cooked him to a crisp and the crash landing would have totally destroyed his burnt corpse to pieces since he had no restraints inside that frig to keep his body from being violently tossed around.

The rest of the Japanese storyline reminded me of various other borrowed movie storylines like Kill Bill, The Hunted, Shogun, and Karate Kid but nowhere near as entertaining because like I first mentioned this is a very slow movie.

The fight scene at the end really annoyed me when it comes to believability because when the old Japanese guy superheats his adamantium sword to cut off Wolverine's claws made no sense because when you superheat metal it loses it's strength properties and becomes soft/pliable.  So that scene should have had him trying to cut off Wolverine's claws but cutting his sword in half or pieces instead since Wolverine's claws would be stronger than the sword.

I think the writers got the sword-making process confused because you do have to superheat the sword to glowing red and quickly cool it by dousing it in water to temper it; it's part of the carbon steel-making process which traps/packs the carbon atoms tighter than just letting it cool normally (which would make a weak brittle knife/sword) and it's how all tempered knives are made.  The History Channel has an excellent documentary on Japanese Samuri Sword Making and manufacturing knives and other bladed tools which is what I'm using as a reference and the movie The Hunted does an excellent job at presenting the process from an entertaining/dramatic drunken swordmaker's point of view.  I know adamantium is not steel (it's actually a ficticous metal alloy created by Marvel Universe) but it is metal nonetheless and has to share the same basic metalurgic properties as all other metals whether real or fictitious.

I know the purists are going to attack this post but please remember I never read the comics or any book adaptations of this series so I don't know what Marvel Universe's view on physics both real and theoretical is.  I do know that from a general science fiction point of view you have to bend some of it but to make it belieable you have to keep it grounded to the extent that it's not ridiculous which is what most early science fiction TV shows and movies did, but what I've seen from most of the other X-Men movie material, they didn't take it too far to be completely unbelievable or insulting the intelligence of the viewers.

Unfortunately I didn't catch the Easter Egg and the end of the movie so I'll wait 'till it's out on Blu-ray and hopefully if a sequel is made they ratchet up the pace a bit because I almost fell asleep during this movie.",1375488000,4,4014,4.602240896358543

3610186,3,B001GCUO16,"The X-Men movies have been a roller coaster for fans of the source material.  2000's X-Men was a delight to see on the big screen, seeing our favorite band of heroes actually come together on screen for the first time.  X-Men 2 topped that, becoming one of the finest comic related movies still to this day.  Unfortunately, that's when X-Men: Last Stand came out.

Helmed by a new director (Brett Ratner, infamous in Hollywood for his mediocrity), Last Stand basically flushed the X-Men legacy down the toilet.  Armed with memes and the audacity to murder off prominent members of the X-Men lineup, the X-Men movies came to a halt.

In '09, Wolverine had his first solo outing, X-Men Origins: Wolverine.  It was, in a word, terrible.

After seeing those two duds, I was not excited for X-Men: First Class, but went to see it anyway.  It was surprisingly good, and brought life back to the X-crew.  Finally, the series had a pulse.  Now, in 2013, in anticipation of X-Men: Days of Future Past, comes The Wolverine.

First, the cast.  Hugh Jackman has never looked better as Logan.  He worked hard to get in shape for this role (even employing help from The Rock), and it really showed.  The rest of the supporting cast is sufficient, but does not stand out.

The direction was sufficient by James Mangold.  I can only dream about what may have been with Darren Arronofsky at the helm.  He had worked on the film and script for 6 months, but wanted a much darker, rated R film, which the studio did not want.  Shame.  Could have been amazing, and much closer to the comics.

Overall, I liked this movie, but I liked it to the point that I probably wouldn't watch it again.  There was one scene that really stood out as being amazing - a fight along a bullet train that happens near the beginning of the story.  It was simply breathtaking, and one of those scenes that will stand out for years to come.  It's a shame it wasn't topped later on in the movie.

I think that the problem with The Wolverine is that there was no great villain.  The villains in the film, including one female mutant, are very one-dimensional and very, very uninteresting.  From the trailers, you can see that we get the Silver Samurai, although he's nothing like he is in the comics.  I hope that the next Wolverine outing comes with a dose of Omega Red, as I think a one on one Omega/Wolverine movie would be outstanding.  If you look at the great comic book movies, they all have iconic, menacing, charismatic villains.  The Dark Knight had Joker, the king of villains.  Spider-Man 2 had Doc Oc.  The Dark Knight Rises had Bane.  This movie...had a few unmemorable villains.  Shame, really.

There were a few good scenes here and Jackman did a great job as Logan/Wolverine, but as an overall product, I didn't think it was great.  It was better than Origins, however.

PS: Be sure to stay after the credits, as (if you watched and remember the abomination known as X-Men: The Last Stand), there's quite a shocker that leads us into 2014's X-Men: Days of Future Past.

3610187,5,B001GCUO16,"My honest thoughts on
The Wolverine

Despite the edits & cuts made to the theatrical cut...
This is hands down one of the best Marvel Adaptations ever

The scene with Logan and The Bear jockeying for position of the woods is brilliant
The detail in everything Japanese is stunning!
The fact a Huge American Film Studio was allowed to film in Japan the way they did and really Captured the ""Real"" modern Japan is just so cool
The setting of Japan is it's own Characters
The cast is perfect
Hugh Jackman was born to be Wolverine
I wish they didn't cut his hair I always loved Logan with longer hair (he just looks so much cooler IMO)
Tao Okamoto as Mariko great casting she looks just like Mariko in the comic books... You can see so much looking into her eyes
Rila Fukushima as Yukio is a amazing discovery  (She steels every scene she is in.... her future in acting looks to be limitless) Hopefully she is brought into future X-Men films
'Cause she is awesome
The story is very close to a Frank Miller Story very dark and extremely deep
The Bullet train scene is stunning and just perfect to the smallest detail (maybe one of the best looking 3D Scenes cause it flows and pops)
IMO Disney should've just did the right thing and released it in both PG-13 and the hard 'R' Cut
it meant to be extremely dark and raw. And to be cut so much to get a family friendly PG-13 was a epic fail since it didn't do very good.....
The Easter egg ending is just awesome (A very small glimpse into X-Men Days of Future Past)

Which brings me to the movie going public
What a bunch of sheep jerk-offs
this film is a must see in 3D and at the cinema but, yet it bombed
why is that really???
Iron Man 3 was like having chemo done so bloody bad
and people flocked like gang-busters
but, a film like Wolverine is passed really why?
Cause it has a extremely smart story that doesn't need things blowing up every 3min. to mask what a piece of trash it is!
Go out and see this film Support this film
Cause it's a future classic  10/10
Hopefully at some point there will be a Director's Cut released of this Film",1375315200,2,2087,4.273417721518987
3610188,4,B001GCUO16,"""The Wolverine"" picks up a few years after the 2006 film ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" leaves off. Logan is living alone in the mountains in fear that if he is around other people he will hurt them like he hurt Jean Grey (killed in X-Men: The Last Stand). When Logan is summoned by an old dying acquaintance from World War II, he decides to pay his respects and travel to Japan to say farewell to his friend. Soon after he arrives he realizes that he was called there for a different purpose. Yashida, the man from Logan's past has brought him to Japan to offer him mortality so that Logan can finally be at peace. When he realizes that not all is as it seems with the powerful Yashida family, he has to face the tough decision whether to give up his life as Wolverine completely, or defend the Yashida empire. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Raven D recommends the film to X-Men fans or ""anyone who wants some action and entertainment.""

I really like this film. I was a bit confused at the beginning because it's been years since I first saw ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" which plays a big part in this film. Once I jogged my memory a bit, the plot was perfect. The 3D in this film is incredible because it isn't over the top. It is very subtle in a way that makes the images clearer and more realistic, but doesn't have things jumping off the screen. The plot twists are very nice even if they are a bit predictable. All in all I am very pleased with the outcome of ""The Wolverine.""

My favorite character has to be Yukio played by Rila Fukushima. She is a very spunky character who is sent to find and bring Logan to Japan to say goodbye to her master. She has incredible martial arts skills and is a very funny character. She is very small, so you wouldn't expect her to be a fighter, but she ends up calling herself Logan's ""bodyguard."" I also like Hugh Jackman's character Wolverine/Logan. He is very hesitant to go to Japan because he has left his identity of Wolverine behind him but, when he sees that innocent people are going to be hurt, he fights for them. Although he is a very tough character, you can see that he has a soft side, which we wee through his many visions of Jean and his sleeplessness because he misses her.

My favorite scene is when Logan battles the Yakuza mob on top of a bullet train. It is such a fast paced, high action fighting sequence that it kept me on the edge of my seat. It was also very unique because it happens on top of a train moving hundreds of miles an hour, so the participants of the fight are almost flying through the air.

I recommend this film for ages 13+ for the action, violence and mature situations. This movie is perfect for X-Men fans or if you just want some action and entertainment. I give ""The Wolverine"" 5 out of 5 stars, so be sure to check it out when it hits theaters on July 26th. Reviewed by Raven D, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic",1375315200,,2877,4.283088235294118
3610189,4,B001GCUO16,"""The Wolverine"" is almost as far from ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" as it could get considering that it involves Marvel's iconic and not-so-merry mutant with the beyond impressive healing factor and Adamantium-laced skeleton.  While the first movie did a great job with some elements (the opening/ title sequence giving you a snapshot history of Wolvie for instance) it did try to cram a lot into its origin story while still fitting into the Marvel cinematic universe and providing a lot of fan service (his duel with Deadpool? overkill).  By contrast ""The Wolverine"" feels almost unnaturally grounded; it's a drama with a specifically Japanese ethos that flits some brief action sequences in and out of it until the last 15 or so minutes of the movie when it feels like an actual comic book/ superhero movie.  And it aint half bad, bub.

Directed by James Mangold (""Walk the Line""; ""Knight and Day""; ""3:10 To Yuma""), who has worked with the Wolverine himself previously in an off-kilter and pleasing romantic comedy (""Kate & Leopold"", pretty good, you should check it out), ""The Wolverine"" doesn't bother to try to follow right after the ""Origins"" movie.  Instead this movie takes up a little while after the events of ""X-Men 3: The Last Stand"" with Logan (Wolverine for those who don't know) living up in the northern wilderness suffering nightmares/ waking visions of Jean Grey.  He's checked out of the superhero and X-Men business and has taken a vow essentially not to kill.  But his less-than-idyllic living is interrupted by a young small Japanese woman who is handy with a sword (comic fans may notice that what they have done with this character is make her similar, in ways, to a certain Jubilation Lee...).  She draws him to Japan to say goodbye to a former Japanese soldier that he had saved in WWII.  From here Logan is drawn into the lives of Yukio (the sword girl) and Mariko (the granddaughter of the soldier whom he had saved previously).  Logan falls in love (I'm not telling you with whom...but could it be both?) and through this lapse into love and his following actions to save her/ them from the family's internal politics regains his desire to live, and to fight again.  All of this occurs in Japan and the Japanese setting and actors provide a genuine feel for their culture and, while the film doesn't try to get deep into it, allows their culture's historical ideal of death before dishonor to be held up within several of the characters meaning that this is frequently their main motivations to take action.  This lends the film an almost mysterious feel.  It isn't a film that will make you leave the theater pumping your fist and yelling ""YEAH!"" nor is it a film that will make you shrug your shoulders and ask ""is that it?""  It is a film that will linger, quietly and a bit unexpectedly, with you so that you don't mind returning to it some time in the near future.

The action sequences aren't overpowering.  This is bound to disappoint some fans; the tradeoff was that Mangold created a more emotionally compelling Wolverine.  Also, effort was made to provide a storyline in which Wolverine is stripped of his healing factor and thus made physically vulnerable (we know he's emotionally vulnerable as he's oft portrayed as emotionally damaged goods) in a non-sensational manner that actually makes some sense.  By doing this Mangold and the writers were able to raise the emotional stakes for this unbeatable character.  And, I must say, there were three genuinely surprising moments in this film for me where I could hardly believe what they did; completely unexpected.  My main qualms were how they ended the film; Wolverine should have said more to his love.  I also wish that they would have had Wolverine study the Samurai's way (as he did in the comics that they based this storyline off of) and played up the Ronin (leaderless Samurai) angle more.  They played around these edges but never went into this particular box.

Be sure to watch for the teaser during the closing credits.

My closing thoughts are that this is a good movie, enjoyable and with some emotional weight, one that won't overwhelm the viewer by any stretch of the imagination but that will likely linger quietly with the (adult) viewer awhile afterward.  Fans or moviegoers looking for an action-packed hack-'n-slash superhero film have another thing coming and they may feel disappointed.

3610192,4,B001GCUO16,"What's good: First, the three lead characters: Tao Okamoto, Rila Fukushima, and of course Hugh Jackman. Okamato projects a regal elegance, only reinforced by her flawless features. Fukushima's intense physical style, coupled with a unique and unmistakable face, give her a commanding and somewhat eerie presence. And Jackman, of course, jacked up for the role, has made it impossible for anyone else, ever, to play Wolverine. I'm not throwing stones at any of the other sigbificant characters, but the movie centered on these three. Without any one, it would have been a different flick.

What else: Effects, of course, and action, action, action. That top-of-the-train chase scene has been done again and again since the dawn of cinema, but never with such split-second timing, intense physics, and knuckle-gnawing suspense. And, there's the chance for some real personal exploration, when Wolverine discovers that he's more mortal than he thought.

What's not: He mostly just shrugs off that chance for a personality-building moment and re-enters the fray, but with more injuries and limping. We all know that Wolverine can take a hit with the best of them, but a few passages took that ""pain is the feeling of weakness leaving your body"" thing past any sane boundary. But hey, this is a comic movie, so excessive sanity would not be a virtue.

Good fun, great entertainment, middling-to-slight personal drama - just what you came for.

3610193,3,B001GCUO16,"Directed by James Mangold (Night and Day, 3:10 To Yuma), ""The Wolverine"" is the 6th installment in the Marvel X-Men series of motion pictures. From the beginning it was marvelously cast with the talents of Hugh Jackman (Les Miserable, The Prestige) who forever launched the Iconic Comic Book Super Hero who is the mutant known as The Wolverine! He always does an intense superb job in this role in every film so far.

Written by Mark Bombeck (Unstoppable, Live Free Die Hard) and Scott Frank (Marley and Me, Out of Sight) the story continues from his origin film in the last movie and takes a hard look at how solitude and being anti-social has become a way of life for Logan (The Wolverine). Although not thick in depth of characters, it makes an honest attempt to appeal to the female audience with a hap-hazard love storyish thing. (Not quite as good as in the last film.)

Tao Okomoto is introduced in this film as Mariko a woman who was sent on a mission to find the man who saved a Japanese military soldier during the Hiroshima attacks of WWII. Hal Yamanouchi (Push, The Wayback) plays the soldier who Logan saved over 60 years earlier by throwing him into a shelter seconds before the atomic bomb goes off. Logan only finds out the way he wants to `thank' Logan is to take away his powers of superheating and regeneration abilities in order to free him from his supposed `agony' of never dying.

Now you have to have  your villains, with a fairly good cast of international Japanese actors like Rila Fukushima (Karma) playing Hal's daughter, the new head of state for a multi-billion dollar company that her father ran, Hiroyuki Sanada (Sunshine, Rush Hour 3), the wannabe billionaire and forced husband of Rila and Brian Tee (Goldmember, When We Were Soldiers) as the head of the empire security who is motivated by nothing more than money and ego. Surprise!

Now throw in another mutant, Viper, played masterfully wicked by Russian actress Svetlana Khodchenkova (Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy) and you have a sci-fi, action adventure with some very good fighting sequences. It reminded me of the old Bruce Lee films or more modern Jackie Chan films were there are several large fight scenes with one man defeating dozens and very cleverly too! Viper is fun to watch once she gets into her `grove'.

Of course there is a love story that actually slows the movie down a little and overall it does give the film a more dramatic feel to it. Too much however. I think the director was trying to make it more of a drama than an action adventure film. That's why it kind of doesn't work in parts.

However if you are an X-Man movie fan, Wolverine fan or a Hugh Jackman fan, you will not be disappointed.  I think it will hold the interest of the action fans but not so appealing to everyone else for its lack of story and sappy love chimes. The finale fight sequence, although visually stunning, left me with a lot of questions however.

SPOILERs: Do not leave at the credit role at the end of the film.....really. There is a short scene that was, quite honestly, better than the film itself - and it  had the audience lightly applauding when one face appeared and then roaring with cheers and applause when another cameo occurred in the same scene. I'll just say if you are a fan of Magneto and Professor X....you are going to love the credits! That's all I'm saying......",1375228800,3,3372,4.614357262103506

3610197,5,B001GCUO16,"In a year jam-packed with blockbusters and art-house thrillers, there are a great many movies that are purely amazing and awesome. Among them are three comic-to-film adaptations: 2 Marvel films and a DC Comic movie. One of these Marvel films is The Wolverine. Set after the events of X-Men The Last Stand, Wolverine/Logan is now away from everything and everyone, wandering the back-roads of the Yukon. But when a girl named Yukio finds Logan, she has him travel to Tokyo, Japan with her to meet with a man from Logan's past. But as Wolverine battles with losing his immortality, he also has to battle his inner demons, which threaten everything he knows.

The Wolverine is easily one of the best Marvel films yet, having a good script, great directing, and superb acting from the even greater Hugh Jackman, who truly is Wolverine in this installment. What I found truly incredible, though, is how the action sequences didn't just help bring intensity to the movie, but were needed to help the story move along. Even better, the action sequences were not absolutely massive. Even the battle between Logan and the Silver Samurai (which was one of the most epic action scenes of all time), was not grand in size. James Mangold really knew what he was doing when he directed this, and if you have seen his film 3:10 to Yuma, you can get the feeling that he took some details from that and put them into this movie. The script, by Mark Bomback (the new Total Recall and Live Free or Die Hard) & Scott Frank, was not cheesy, over-the-top, or missing anything needed. The dialogue was great, very believable, and the characters were perfectly written; character development was all over the place! The musical score by Marco Beltrami is easily his best since 3:10 to Yuma, and the visual effects, while not award-winning (compared to other movies this year), are great, never out of place. The cinematography was stunning, with the shots of Nagasaki and Tokyo helping to place the audience and Wolverine in a totally different world.

Overall, The Wolverine is the movie Wolverine fans have been wanting for a while now, especially after the mistake that was X-Men Origins. I just hope Jackman is as big in X-Men Days of Future Past as he was here, in both character and physique.

3610199,5,B001GCUO16,"I caught this over the weekend because it just looked so bad ass since they released the first trailer many months before. Maybe I'm the minority here but I'm a big fan of all the X-Men films & really enjoyed the first Wolverine movie too despite it's mixed reviews. Hugh Jackman owns this role & Mangold & company have done a stellar job on this movie. From start to finish this film is enthralling & unlike Warner Brother's recent summer blockbuster, Man of Steel, The Wolverine doesn't contain any plot holes. Not surprisingly, The Silver Samurai character is altered in the movie but it's explained & makes sense for the story they're telling & this was also the best of the X-Men films since X-Men 2. While it's suspenseful & action packed throughout it wisely doesn't subtract it's high quality storytelling & character substance whatsoever. Like Nolan's Batman trilogy, The Wolverine definitely tackles the stereotypical superhero areas with maturity & sophistication, & thus capturing all of the best elements & grounded aesthetics to stand apart from the rest of the superhero film genre.",1375142400,7,1097,5.0
3610200,3,B001GCUO16,"As it turned out, The Wolverine was much better than I expected it to be, and I actually enjoyed most of it. It has its issues, but, at least, they weren't really bad story-telling issues. The story, amazingly enough, was pretty solid and managed to not go off the cliff that the origin movie did. Of course, the story is only ""pretty solid"" if you look at it within the context of the X-Men movies. This movie has nothing to do with the comics other than that they pull some familiar characters from the Wolverine mythos to use in the movie. If you were hoping for anything resembling an adaptation of the Frank Miller/Chris Claremont Wolverine mini-series from the early '80s, you're not going to find that here. Okay, you'll get something vaguely resembling it. Very vaguely. He does fight some Hand ninjas. Except their not called that. So we're back to that ""vaguely"" again.

The thing to know about The Wolverine is that it's not about what it's about it. Within the context of the X-Men movies, the story is here to bridge the gap between X-Men: The Last Stand and the forthcoming X-Men: Days of Future Past and deal with the ramifications of how Last Stand ended. Basically, it's to get Logan to let go of the death of Jean and his part in it. With that goal in mind, The Wolverine actually accomplished its purpose and in a way that made sense. The micro-plot of just this one movie wasn't too bad either, even if it did have more than its share of ""what the heck?"" moments.

Spoiler alert:
The biggest issue with the movie is the sleight-of-hand they play with Logan's healing power. The dying old guy wants Logan's ability, and the best the writers could come up with is that the old dude is going to ""steal"" it. Not duplicate it, steal it. Which sounds like they're going to do some kind of thing like when Rogue absorbs other mutants' powers, but, no, the old guy is just going to drill into Logan's bone marrow and transfer the power to himself, which doesn't make any sense, but I'll give it a pass on the handwavium principle. Except that they also ""suppress"" his healing power using a little ""Matrix"" bug that gets on Wolvie's heart, and they don't explain that, either, especially after making it seem as if this is some other mutant thing before we find out it's a device. Really, you can only get a pass on one of these things in the movie. The deal with the tiny robot is that they want Wolverine to rip his own heart out to get rid of the thing, so I can see that they're going for the ""cool factor"" with that, but, then, they don't show it, so they lose out on that, anyway. And it leaves all kinds of questions: does the little robot bug suppress all mutant abilities or just Logan's? Or just Logan's healing factor? It's hard to tell, because he really doesn't use any of his heightened senses in the movie at all, so we don't know if he still has those or not. Of course, there's also the argument that Logan's healing power should have just expelled the little robot bug to begin with, but the movie Wolverine isn't quite as powerful as the comic book Wolverine.

And neither is adamantium, evidently, because we again have a ""bullet piercing adamantium"" situation in that the old guy cuts off Wolverine's claws to get at his bone marrow. It's slightly more believable than the bullet being fired into Logan's head but not by much.

At any rate, those things are just issues with story points not the story itself, and we have to deal with those all the time. Like people surviving explosions by jumping into water or standing behind a wall or whatever. So, whereas there are some... stupid? silly? okay, stupid... things within the story, the plot of The Wolverine holds up both on the level of there being a villain intent upon stealing Logan's healing powers and as a vehicle for Logan to get over have killed Jean.

Having said all of that, The Wolverine is not a movie you have to see in the theater. It's not like Pacific Rim or Man of Steel (although I think it's a better movie than both of those) that really need to be seen on the big screen to get the full effect of the scope of the action. You can just as easily wait for the DVD for this one, and, honestly, I doubt there's anything necessary in this movie for the overall X-Men story line. If you like Wolverine, it's probably worth seeing it, but you're not going to feel like you missed anything if you give this one a pass on the way to Days of Future Past.",1375142400,5,4452,4.424390243902439
3610201,3,B001GCUO16,"The X Men have had a bit of a troubled road these last few years. Following the great success of X Men 2 they followed it up with the equally disastrous X Men 3. Just about everyone hated that film, but that hatred was nothing compared to how people reacted to X Men Origins: Wolverine. And though people tend to like X Men First Class, I thought it was a bore. Better then X3 and Origins, but nothing when compared to the first two movies. To my mind they haven't made a good X movie since X2 even after three tries. Wolverine especially seemed like a tired character, having appeared in all but one X film and making a cameo in the one he didn't star in.

Set a few years after the events of the third movie we find Wolverine alone in the Canadian wilderness living the life of a hobo. His hair is long and matty, his beard shaggy and filled with twigs, and his cloths look like they haven't been washed in weeks. He also has a thing about standing out in the rain, which oddly enough happens quite a lot. It rains more in this film then an average day in the UK. Anyway, he is summoned to Japan to say his goodbyes to a man whose life he saved during the bombing of Nagasaki. Along the way he falls in love with some random Japanese woman, loses his ability to heal,  and gets into fights with ninjas.

The Wolverine is a film that somehow manages to make a lot of mistakes but falls short of making an error that would put it in X Men: Origins territory. First off the love story seems very forced and out of place. It comes out of nowhere and then just ends as if it never happened. It's as if the producers decided they needed some sex thrown into the film in order for it to sell and decided to force it in there regardless of if it fits or not. Likewise the main villain, Venom, is wasted on this film. She doesn't do anything, or contribute in any meaningful way to the plot until the very end of the film. She pops in every now and then to remind us she's evil, but she hardly holds the same menacing presence as Magnito or other famous X Men villains. She's mostly there, it seems, so that Wolverine has a fellow mutant to fight instead of just measly humans but they don't fight the entire film. So what exactly was the point of her being there? Why waste such an interesting villain on a film where she has no role to play when you have Days of Futures Past coming in the future?

But despite these glaring problems The Wolverine never bored me, or disinterested me enough to start nit picking at every little detail. Despite the alarming lack of mutant on mutant fighting Wolverine gets a good dose of fun and exciting action despite his powers being gimped for half the film. It was fun watching a venerable Wolverine taking on hordes of ninjas even though he should have been killed many times over had his powers really been taken away. My favorite scene was when he was fighting on top of a bullet train and needs to use his cunning to defeat his enemies instead of just brawling them to death like he likes to do.

The Wolverine is ten times better than the dreck that we've seen from X Men lately but still manages to fall short of the first two films. With the gross oversaturation of super hero films its films like this and the equally ""meh"" Man of Steel that will spell doom for the genre in coming years. These are films that cost huge sums to make, but with so many mediocre to downright bad (looking at you Iron Man 3) super hero flicks on the market people are going to eventually stop watching them. Here's to hoping Days of Futures Past being better.",1375142400,,3580,4.258823529411765

3610203,5,B001GCUO16,"A superhero movie that isn't setting up a franchise or deeply invested in continuing it is rare nowadays. The Wolverine, a mostly stand-alone film with a slow enough pace to feel like a solid film, is a nice throwback to those quaint days of yore, when times weren't so tough that movie studios felt pressured into creating a billion-dollar industry out of every film they created.

The Wolverine takes its title character, the most popular X-Man, and puts him in Tokyo, Japan for a story-line that starts in Nagasaki, 1945, when the immortal Logan saves a Japanese soldier from the atomic bomb. The man offers to repay Logan in the present by taking away his immortality. Then the elderly soldier's son, hired archer, granddaughter, the granddaughter's adopted sister, and the granddaughter's fiance all turn out to have a part to play, and all fight Wolverine at some point. The plot is naturally over-complicated, but it's still fun, with good action scenes and locations. The stakes are solid: since it's a story with almost entirely new characters, any of them can die. Most of them do.

One of the main villains, the Viper, is a woman with snake-like mutant abilities such as breathing poison and shedding her skin. Her motivations weren't very clear: she's working for the grandfather, but there isn't much of an explanation for why and how he found her specifically. Wolverine's loss of immortality is also a little suspect, as he still retains the ability to shrug off multiple bullet and stab wounds. Sure, it's because his power was only `suppressed' and it's plausible that the Viper's knowledge of biology was needed to help the grandfather's ailing health, but those are explanations designed to prop up the real reason, which is that both plot decisions lend to better action scenes.

The tone of the film is dark, but humorously so, with Hugh Jackman giving his character the same sardonic, tough-guy attitude that is just like the comic book version of Wolverine. His character is still a lot of fun to watch, and the supporting characters, which include Rila Fukushima as Yukio, the female ninja who insists on acting as Wolverine's bodyguard.

The film's credits scene is the most ridiculous, sequel-hooky one I've ever seen: Professor X and Magneto both make an appearance, despite barely being referenced in the entire film. I saw The Wolverine with a friend who had never seen any of the other five X-Man films before this one, and he was utterly confused to see Gandalf and Jean-Luc Picard show up. For those in the know, however, it just sets up the next film. It's very out of place in this film, but since it doesn't show up til the end, it doesn't ruin anything.

The Wolverine is a fun movie, if you want a superhero film that is a little different from the rest of them. The director brings his own ideas to the film, much like Shane Black did with Iron Man 3. Hopefully, Marvel's films and Fox's X-Men films will continue to allow their directors to go in different directions with superheroes in the future, too. We need the variety.",1375142400,8,3064,4.795454545454546

As the movie progresses, the suspense and action of the movie keep fans captivated.  This year for the movies has been disappointing so I am glad to say it was worth the money to see The Wolverine in the theater.

My only problem with this movie is that it lags a bit in the middle.  Besides that, The Wolverine is great.  Another problem with this movie is that it was made in 3D.  This movie does not need 3D at all. It is just a money grab.

If you are an X-Men fan then go see it.  If you are not than see it anyway.  The Wolverine is almost like a standalone movie.  You really don't need to know anything about the X-Men before seeing this.  I didn't and I loved it.

3610208,4,B001GCUO16,"The superhero movies just keep rolling along and Stan Lee, in the later parts of his life is enjoying a financial windfall that didn't come in the early days when he was creating his famous characters. I'll have to be honest though, despite being a fan of superheroes, even I've grown tired of them. It isn't that I don't enjoy the movies, but it seems that it is the entirety of what Hollywood is putting out anymore. ""The Wolverine"" is another addition to the successful ""X-Men"" series. Personally, I find the X-Men to be one of Stan Lee's richest comic book series' due to the uniqueness of the characters and the more complicated stories that come with them.

For some reason though, despite the richness of all the characters from the X-Men, it is only Logan, ""The Wolverine"", who was cool enough to get two solo-movies. While most of the X-Men fans salivate about the Wolverine, I find him to be less intriguing then some of the other characters. He's invincible. Every time he's wounded, he heals himself. I guess that's why I always found Batman more interesting than Superman as well.

Fortunately though, the creators of ""The Wolverine"" tapped into the one thing that is Logan's weakness, his own mind and his immortal thoughts. This outing has Logan haunted by the death of Jean Gray, a death that happened in the terrible final ""X-Men"" trilogy movie, ""Last Stand"". His life as an immortal has become daunting and he has nothing to live for. So when a man from his past seeks him out, he travels to Japan to begin a new chapter in his long unending life.

""The Wolverine"" is certainly gifted with one thing that most of these superhero movies have seemed to be challenged to achieve. It has a relatively good and complicated story to tell. Another thing that is rewarding about the movie is the placement of events in Japan. The movie is drenched in Japanese culture, ninjas and traditions and I found it to be a fantastic mix with the troubled Wolverine and his retractable blades. Plus it took what we usually think a superhero movie to be and used some creativity in a new environment.

""The Wolverine"" isn't a great superhero movie but it is certainly one of the better ones and it gets the ""X-Men"" series back in line for, wait for it, more movies to come. In what has been a dismal summer of movies, it is sort of unfortunate to say that ""The Wolverine"" is probably one of the better movies thus far. It delivers emotion, relation to the characters, an involving story, a dramatic situation to be invested in and it finally delivers the big blockbuster action that the popcorn poppers come to see.",1375056000,2,2614,4.627155172413793

If you haven't seen it, and are concidering it, save yourself the money and wasted time. Most of the movie consists of bickering between the non-mutant families and overly long train fights and shooting Wolvering with about 2 dozen over sized arrows.",1374969600,7,656,4.567796610169491
3610211,4,B001GCUO16,"Comparing ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" to ""The Wolverine"" is like comparing apples to oranges.  They are both about Marvel's burly and animalistic Wolverine, but they could not be any more different.  Origins seemed to explore a bit of Wolvie's past under the framework of the prior X-Men movies (i.e. familiar characters, settings, and themes), but unfortunately it didn't hit home like the prior X-Men films.  The writing fell flat, because 20th Century Fox took odd twists and turns with fan favorites like Gambit and Deadpool and then never expanded on them in future films like they promised.  Instead of bridging Wolverine's backstory to the acclaimed X-Men trilogy, Fox ended up widening the gap.

However, ""The Wolverine,"" takes an entirely different approach to the eponymous character.  Audiences get to see the Adamantium and claws stripped away in a more emotionally driven film.  Wolverine is facing an existential crisis.  Following the events of ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" filmgoers get to see the Wolverine battle is own mortality, or rather near-immortality, during a series of dream sequences centering-around Jean Grey, which is reprised by award-winning Dutch actor, Famke Janssen.  This creates a great underlying plot, and immediately sets ""The Wolverine"" apart from the other X-Men films.

Surprisingly enough, ""The Wolverine"" closely follows the original comic book volume of Wolverine, Chris Claremont and Frank Miller's four-part miniseries, that set the tone and standard for Wolverine and his story arcs.  Even though the film is set after the events of ""X-Men: The Last Stand,"" instead of ""X-Men Origins,"" ""The Wolverine"" accurately showcases the events of the 1982 comic book series.  Slight changes have been made to modernize and fit the screenplay into the continuity of the X-Men franchise but on the whole I was incredibly surprised by the amount of source material represented in the movie.

Following the conclusion of ""X-Men: The Last Stand,"" in which Jean Grey (aka the Phoenix) is killed by Wolverine in order to stop her from committing genocide, Wolverine  once again takes to the Canadian Rockies.  Living as an animal, Logan only ever comes down from the mountains to garnish what little supplies that he needs.  After a particularly unjust hunting party pulls Wolverine from his introspection and a mysterious Japanese woman shows up to escort Logan to her adoptive grandfather, the films gains traction.  The remainder of ""The Wolverine"" takes place in Japan with an almost all Japanese cast, and focuses on Wolverine's relationship to a (now) elderly Japanese man who Logan saved during the closing days of World War II after the atomic drop over Nagasaki.

Rivals emerge and mutants aid both sides, but at its heart ""The Wolverine"" is primarily focused on Wolverine.  It discusses his mental state after killing Jean, his own mortality as he confronts an old acquaintance, and ultimately his place in an ever shifting world.  Hugh Jackman portrays the character perfectly.  He is, for lack of a better phrase, the only actor that could ever play Wolverine.  He is the best he is at what he does.

Aside from the phenomenal adaptation and Jackman's performance, the action sequences are tight and the revelations are legitimately surprising.  There are only a handful of lines that came off forced or cheesy, but they can be forgiven considering the overall quality of the film.  The pacing is so smooth and cyclical, that I personally had difficulties telling where the climax of the film landed; this left me without a frame of reference.  Usually I can tell when the conclusion is eminent, but this time around I had difficulties nailing it down.  I think that this is a byproduct of closely adapting a mini-series into a film.  It felt more like a series of mini-climaxes akin to the conclusion of four separate issues culminating in the finale of a series.  Regardless, the flow was appropriate and I never felt that the film hung in exposition or action for too long.  It had great balance.

This is a solid superhero film that pays homage to its source material better than most and keeps with the character's integrity after nearly fifteen years.  Cheers to Hugh Jackman and the whole crew for ""The Wolverine.""  ""The Wolverine"" garnishes four-out-of-five stars.

Also, do not forget to stick around for the after the credits scene.  It ties wonderfully into ""X-Men: Days of Future Past,"" which is slated to release May of 2014.  Its got surprises a plenty and if it doesn't get you excited for the next X-Men film then I'm not sure what would.",1374969600,283,4593,5.069241011984022
3610212,3,B001GCUO16,"After the lackluster feelings people had to ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" you'd think it wouldn't be tough to outdo it in being an entertaining effort. And this film does manage to do that, but not enough to be considered a great film experience.

Picking up where ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" left off, Wolverine is now living like a mountain man and battling his own guilt. But he is soon drawn into a web of conflict and honor in Japan, due to an old acquaintance, which has him facing not only his guilt and past, but his own sense of mortality.

Much of this story's main thrust and inspiration is taken from the early 80's mini-series by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller. Director James Mangold does a decent enough job of implementing the facets of that story, while updating it for more modern sensibilities. He also does some wonderful work with some of the major action sequences, as well. But many of the performances just feel subdued, save for Jackman's as Wolverine. The emotional context of the scenes and motivations don't quite ring true. The love affair with Wolverine and Mariko (played by Tao Okamoto) Feels extremely rushed and forced. And the inclusion of Viper (played by Svetlana Khodchenkova) feels completely miscast and unnecessary. However, the last bit at the end during the credits, was a great bit of tease, which was a lot of fun and one of the best moments of the film.

Hugh Jackman does his best to give you what you expect from the character he's spent over a decade bringing to life on the big screen. He perfectly provides you with a very realistic feeling for the inner turmoil within Wolverine's soul. But there are many lost opportunities to dig deeper into it, which are sidetracked for the action sequences and other characters machinations that aren't vital to the story and don't really advance the overall plot very much. There was so much more that could have been expanded upon with Wolverine and Mariko, if the time used on these superfluous character plots had not been in the way. Worst of all is that Yukio's character (played by Rila Fukushima) was totally wasted as little more than a plot exposition guru, there to fill in the blanks that the script and story didn't bear out as they should. Although, her battle in the medical lab with Shingen (played by Hiroyuki Sanada) was one of the better action scenes of the film, which I enjoyed very much.

In the final analysis, ""The Wolverine"" ends up as just a typical comic book movie. Not horrible, but not particularly great, either. I liked it, but then I'm also a big comic fan, too. As I said before, it is a better effort than the last Wolverine related film, but that falls under the heading of ""damning with faint praise."" Those who are fans of the character and his comic adventures will likely get some decent enjoyment from this, as will those looking for a semi-interesting action film. But those unfamiliar with the character and the comics this film uses for its basis, aren't likely to become new fans through this effort. Much like how comics are written today, if you haven't been a fan for a long time, there's going to be little done here to make you one now. This film feels much the same way!",1374969600,,3208,4.652557319223986

This story follows after x-men 3 the worst of the x-men movies. (Yes I said it) maybe Hollywood doesn't know how to put back to back story lines together? But thats just me.

3610214,5,B001GCUO16,"The Wolverine review

I think I can honestly say I have never seen a comic book movie quite like The Wolverine. This is a new kind of animal.

Following the disaster that was Origins to fans even if financially it did well, even star Hugh Jackman has eluded to this it seems  fox decided to go in a VERY different direction to bring the adimantium one back to the big screen and went for something nobody was  quite expecting or quite prepared for, critics or fans, which is probably the reason why opinion on it is so very split at this current time and will continue to be so no doubt, but it makes for something far more interesting and engaging in the comic book movie world.

It is a far more cerebral, adult and intreverted comcic book film than any other Xmen, Marvel or hell even any comic book movie to date, actually delving into the hero's psyche unlike any we have seen with maybe the exception of Batman Begins, seeing what is actually going on inside his head,  motivating him (or at the start of the movie de-motivating him!) to do and say what he does. This is a risky and bold direction for a summer blockbuster to go in forgoing, mostly, the usual big bang for your buck ideas that put bums on seats, this is
one for fans of the character more than most comic book movies, but for most of this unusual ride James Mangold steers the ship on a an exhilirating, beautiful and down write brutal ride only once or twice coming close to the rocks.

It is true, like many other Marvel films (Magneto aside) there is no great villain unearthed here, the main antagonists are well done, have suitable motivation to do what they do and serve the story well but again not on the level that the DC movie universe can boast to date, but this  is becuase Logans greatest battle is with his own demons, or within his own head to be more precise. This is another pointer to the conclusion that this is not a typical CBM, it is not a battle of good v evil with millions of lives at stake but just one, his own.
As the film starts, Logan has the claws but he does not know in which direction to point them, a stray animal with no master.

But for the lack of an outstanding enemy there are two outstanding allies, enter Yukio, and later Mariko, one a whirling dervish of an assassin, flame  haired and a great foil to Logans rough and brooding nature and the other the heir apparent and a breath of fresh air to the CBM world, a new beauty to tame the beast. Both are expertly played by Rila Fukushima and Tao Okamoto. Both are first timers. Both have a greater impact than some established actors in other comic book movies. Both must surely return.

Ah yes the difficult third act, a sticking point for many a film, how to go out with a flourish, to leave everyone wanting more or closure to
the proceedings before it, in truth, as well documented the Wolverine does end on familiar territory but no worse than what he
have seen before from the likes of Ironman or The Avengers, its just a reminder that we were watching a comic book movie all along
even though it felt like something else before, something evolved, a different kind of animal.

There are other drawbacks and misteps however, but they are few, Viper hisses and spits but never really bites, Harada is the dark mystery
potential that remains that way, never evolving from it, potential lost. Thankfully they do not eat up much screen time or hurt the bigger
picture.

So overall to the score or rating of the wolverine and it was not an easy one, it has taken two viewings to fully explore everything in this film, as the first was such a shock to the system so unexpected, so very different to what came before to take it all in in one sitting was immpossible.

There are new things tried here, risks taken and cliches avoided and for the most part they work together unlike
any other before it, of course this means that there is greater chance for things to go wrong but they are few and far between and worth paying the price for to finally have the wolverine film fans have always craved since his first appearance all the way back in x1.

3610218,5,B001GCUO16,"I didn't move during this entire film. Right from the start I was pulled in by the depth of the depiction of Wolverine. I've been a fan of Hugh Jackman's portrayal of the character from X-Men (2000) onward, but what I wasn't expecting was for him to actually make me an even bigger fan by pushing himself to find new things to say and add nuances to a performance I already enjoy over multiple films. The setting, moving Wolverine to Japan, and the threat Wolverine faces combine to give the film an opportunity to strip the character down to his core elements and see what they can find there. The result is a character pushed farther than he's been pushed so far in this film series. The examination of Wolverine's immortality and his desperation to end the pain that immortality has brought him are beautifully drawn, making this a thinking and feeling action film that has a lot to say about the character and where he finds himself at this point in his life. I also enjoyed the supporting cast of characters. Unlike the other films, for the most part Wolverine is the only mutant around in much of this film and that's an interesting change of pace because it allows the focus to remain on the title character. We are not distracted by other mutants using flashy powers or competing for screen time. Lastly, make sure you keep watching after the credits roll, you'll get a fun treat that definitely shouldn't be missed.",1374883200,5,1424,4.610236220472441
3610219,5,B001GCUO16,"I see this movie is getting some less-than-desirable reviews, but I thought it was outstanding.  It is amazing to me that anyone would think less.  The movie is loaded with action and Hugh Jackman is Wolverine, the man has the part down pat!
Although I never read the comic books, I have seen all the Wolverine and XMen movies and love every one of them.

If anyone does not know, Wolverine is a very powerful warrior, a mutant with special abilities.  He does not age, is at least 200 years old, remains about 45 years old, heals instantly if he is cut or shot, and springs out metal claws if he gets angry.  His entire skeletal structure is a very strong metal.  He generally tries to help the good guys and the bad guys get busted up.  (Ha Ha--when I was in Catholic school, the nun always said ""whoa-be-tied him/her/you"" when someone was in trouble for doing something bad.  Well, whoa-be-tied the bad guys around Wolverine, cause he will bust them up!.(Don't know where that expression came from, but you didn't dare ask a nun in those days:(.

In the movie promo, you see an Asian man who looks seriously ill.  He is thanking Wolverine for saving his life and offering to fix it so he can live a normal life, and age and die naturally, instead of staying around watching everyone else die.

In the very beginning of the movie, you see Wolverine save the life of a young Japanese soldier, in Nagasaki, Japan, when the bomb goes off (1940 something?).  Now that same soldier is old and dying.  He sends a young lady to find Wolverine and bring him to Japan so he can thank him before he dies, and offer him a favor.  Reluctantly, Wolverine agrees and goes to Japan.  The rest of the movie is in Japan, and includes a great deal of action, as well as some Ninja fighting and martial arts.  Again, it is very very good and it kept me glued to my seat.

If you see this in the theater, stay with the credits and you will see scenes from the next XMen movie, slated for 2014.",1374883200,11,1975,4.367123287671233
3610220,4,B001GCUO16,"I am a  X Men fan; especially when it comes to the comic books. I was uber excited when I found out that the classic Wolverine in Japan story line would be the basis for this film. And surprisingly enough, after the barely tolerable mess that 2009's X Men Origins Wolverine was, this movie goes to show that improvements can always be made.

Hugh Jackman returns yet again as Wolverine in what seems like his 100th time, but is ultimately his 7th time. And I gotta say, he put on quite the performance this time around. When I say he played the part to perfection in this movie, I MEAN IT. He brings the necessary brutality, the depression, the aggression, and overall force to the character. Famke Janseen makes minor appearances as Jean Grey. We also have a whole new cast of people some of you may or may not have heard of. Tao Okamoto portrays Mariko, Brian Tee plays Noburo, Rila Fukushima portrays  Yukio, and we also have a Russian actress by the name of Svetlana Khodchenkova who plays one of the movie's antagonists, Viper. The cast was excellent.

Story wise, if you have read the full Japanese comic story involving Wolverine, then you know exactly what you are in for. And as a movie, The Wolverine brings the action, the unexpected and enjoyable humor, and the dramatic tone needed for the movie.

In my honest opinion, although Wolverine is a X Men, this movie feels more like a stand alone film. But for the movie as a whole that is a good thing. The Wolverine did not fall flat at all. It is really engaging, and again much MUCH better than the 2009 Origins film. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes the X Men movies (specifically 1,2 and First Class) and especially to anyone who is a TRUE Wolverine fan. I myself will be buying this on blu ray when it comes out; and I do hear that there is to be an unrated cut of the movie as well. Out of 5 possible stars, The Wolverine gets a score of:

3610221,3,B001GCUO16,"This movie was a let down as the hype was saying it would be better than Origins. However, that was not the case. The movie pick ups about two years after X3 and has Logan dealing with the emotional repercussions of what took place in that film. A somewhat quasi-sequel. Other than the memory loss issue prevalent in the original trilogy and explained in Origins, there is no reference to anything about those movies except for the guilt he's dealing with from X3. The rest is totally brought up out of nowhere, cinematically speaking, except flashbacks shown to the audience that Logan doesn't remember until about halfway through the film. The story and action is dragging for most of the film and we don't get the wolverine until three quarters of it is over. There's a romance thrown in there that seems too quick to be believably developed and only purpose being to probably set up Wolverine 3 or 4. They should've just picked up where Origins left off and focused on the brother dynamic between wolverine and sabretooth, but the director said he didn't even want to mention Origins and keep this a stand alone film. Which is interesting as the film definitely had a different style to it than any of the previous films, but the best  part of it, in my opinion, was the post credits scene reminiscent of the original Xmen movie. Anyway, I'll break down this movie in the ranks of how I like the xmen saga: X2 is a five star film, X1 and Origins get four stars, while X3 and this movie get three, as I feel generous today. Hopefully, Bryan Singer will fix the issues this movie creates by the time Xmen: Days of Future Past comes out.",1374883200,,1638,4.533783783783784
3610222,4,B001GCUO16,"""The Wolverine"" ALMOST goes full retard in the last twenty minutes, but the 100 minutes preceding that are really solid. In fact, this movie was a solid 9 before the last stupid twenty minutes. Still, the Ronin aspect of the first two acts was fantastic. I love a good samurai tale, and this really hit it off the park. Kinda like how Skyfall was a character study of 007, this is a character study of Logan. I mean, this is not as good, but it still ends up being solid. The action progresses the story, and the set pieces are awesome yet subtle...until the last act. A chase during a funeral, a fight on a bullet train, and an epic samurai fight at the end of the second act were the highlights. There was just enough action for me. It was really the talking that engrossed me. Wolvy's interaction with his ""bodyguard"" Yukio were great and the love interest Mariko were not cheesy at all. I liked how the mortality aspect was a big subplot rather than the whole thing, because it never got boring. The actual story was decent with the whole Yakuza thing going on, but the last act kind of cheapened some of the story. Damn it, you last twenty minutes! It's not like the finale was horrible like the finale of Origins, but it was kind of dumb. Seriously, the finale should have been the showdown with arrows that comes RIGHT before it. The rest should have been as serious as the rest of it. It left kind of a bad tase, but still, this movie is TWO hours. So if the first 100 minutes were a solid 9.5, and the finale was kind of a 6, it didn't bother me as much. Plus, the end teaser was great!

Unfortunately, the script, actors and direction all fall prey to standard Hollywood stereotypes and cliches.

Anyone who's been to Japan would be disgusted and disappointed with the low-quality unrealistic portrayal of Japanese people. Leave it to Hollywood to make some of the smartest people in the world, the Japanese, look dumb, brutish, petty and stupid. Only Hollwood can so successfully demean people. Not to mention provide way over-the-top unrealistic impossible action scenes such as the fight on top of the speeding bullet train. Some of the Japanese scenery and architecture was beautiful, but even there the producers failed to capture the essence of Japan and what it means to be Japanese. The acting and script were just monumentally stupid. But I'm sure millions of dumb Americans will just love this.

3610226,5,B001GCUO16,"After the disastrous film that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine, FOX sought to make a movie that would redeem the Wolverine in the eyes of fans and audiences. In comes James Mangold and a script based on the highly popular story arc by Chris Claremont. Now we have The Wolverine, a film that sets new boundaries of what can be done in comic book films.

The Wolverine is a much more personal tale about Logan and his ruined life after the events of X-Men 3. He can see dreams of Jean Grey who he had to kill against his wishes to save people. He lives like a hermit in the woods until a young woman, Yukio, tells him of a dying man who wishes to see him. What follows is Wolverines trip to Japan, losing his healing factor and his journey to protect the dying old man's granddaughter Mariko.

Some fans of the original comic run by Claremont may feel distressed over the changed characters in the movie, but it isn't something that should ruin the film. The certain twists with the characters of Silver Samurai and the rather interesting villain found in Svetlana Khodchenkova's Viper, create for an enjoyable plot line surrounding Jackman's troubled character.

Some may also take issue with the love that Wolverine has for Jean Grey, seeing as how the Grey's character is Cyclop's love in the comics. Viewers may not think of this, but through Wolverine in the majority of the X-Men films, Logan's love for Grey is very one sided and that one sided love helps to shape this dream version of Jean.

Speaking of Hugh Jackman, he has done a fantastic job here as the Wolverine. He's ripped, he's loud but yet also gives us the chance to peer inside of him to see how much pain he is in throughout the movie. The location of Japan provides for beautiful imagery in certain scenes and it all blends well with our angry hero and his journey.

The film takes it's time setting up the story and it's characters, providing much more drama than what is found in a typical superhero film and for me, that is a major benefit to help the film standout. The action takes a back seat to the drama of the story, but when the action does show up it's bloody (as PG-13 goes) and brutal. It's directed incredibly well, providing for great set pieces such as a well choreographed fight in and on top of a 300 mph bullet train. The third act, while changing the feel and tone from the rest of the film, provides great twists and an awesome conclusion.

For me, The Wolverine did what Man of Steel did this summer, successfully reintroduce a character after a terrible film and give us, as viewers, a much deeper insight into them. And like Man of Steel, it broke new ground in what can be done in a comic book film.

First it was Spider-Man 2. He lost his abilities and that was cool! He wanted to be a normal guy again, but the world needed him back! (That's good. First time they did that, and it made sense!)

Second, it was Thor. Oh no, he has no hammer? Make the movie about that! He's going to be a hero without it! (Okay, but it's kind of been done.)

Third, Iron Man 3. Oh no, he has no armor, but only half the time...so it's okay? That's kind of new right??? What would he do without armor? Be a hero without it?!?! (Really?)

Now, the Wolverine. Guess, what? Here we go again!!!

Let's make this guy weak!!! How can we do this? That's easy! Let's do it again! Just like what we did with last handful of Marvel movies. Let's just take away all his powers and abilities and make a movie out of it! OMG!!! AGAIN!!!

So, if you want to see the Wolverine or should I say Logan, because he actually doesn't want to be called Wolverine and really wants to call himself Logan! Logan! I'm NOT the Wolverine! I'm Logan!!! Why is this movie calling me, the Wolverine? It should be calling me, LOGAN!!!

Wait a second? Isn't this the almost the same idea of Spider Man 2? Do I really want to be Spider-Man turned into do I really want to be the Wolverine???

Oh yes, I get it! In this movie because he's weak in the head/body/soul basically, everything you can think of--that's him now. Logan's started to let go and really didn't want to be Wolverine. Then, at the end of the movie, he decided he needed his powers and wanted to be a hero again. Go, Spidy, Go!!! Uhhh, I mean Wolverine!

I thought this movie didn't have enough action. Used the same concepts over again. Did a okay job with the story for the beginning and end, but failed a lot in the rest of the movie. The director tried too hard to make people laugh and did many comedy scenes.

I swear, they're going to cycle this concept over again. Let's do Cap next! Let's just take away his shield and his abilities! It's like watching a whole new movie. NOT!!!

Many decades later, with the death of his beloved Jean still haunting his dreams, he is summoned to Japan as that same man, now elderly, lays dying.

My favorite part of ""Iron Man 3"" was when our guy was suddenly stripped of his power. In this one, we see another Marvel superhero become a mere mortal...at least for a time. Wolverine tries to help a young woman who is being pursued by gangsters and killers who are somehow tied to the death of her grandfather. In addition, he also finds himself in dire need of assistance from a young Goth chauffeur/bodyguard.

Let's see who's who in this one:
  * Hugh Jackman (""Real Steel"" and ""Les Misrables"") is, for the sixth time, Logan/Wolverine, our self-repairing immortal who has retreated to the wilderness to grieve for his lost love.
  * Famke Janssen (""Taken"" and ""X-Men"") joins us courtesy of flashbacks and dreams, as Jean Grey, the woman he adored...and killed...
  * Rila Fukushima (""Karma: A Very Twisted Love Story"") is Yukio, Wolverine's maroon-haired bodyguard.
  * Tao Okamoto (in her first film) is Mariko, granddaughter of the elderly industrialist who offers to ""cure"" Logan of his immortality.

There are many, many more characters in this story, but I have named the ones who caught MY eye.

However, to the credit of Marvel and Fox, neither company gave up on the franchise and have apparently ""righted the ship"" after the (mostly) embraced addition of First Class in 2011.

In this his sixth appearance as the character and second solo adventure, Jackman once again stars as Marvel's beloved mutant superhero in The Wolverine.

***MINOR PLOT DETAILS / POSSIBLE SPOILERS***

Directed by James Mangold (Walk the Line, 3:10 to Yuma), The Wolverine stars Hugh Jackman as Logan/Wolverine, who is mentally broken down after the events of X-Men: The Last Stand.  Constantly haunted by visions of his beloved Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), Logan struggles to find meaning in his life - until he is paid a visit from Yukio (Rila Fukushima), a woman with the ability to see the future.  She informs Logan that Ichir Yashida, a man Logan saved in Japan when the atom bomb was dropped on Nagasaaki in 1945, is dying and wishes to say his final goodbye.  Once in Japan, Yashida informs Logan that he can remove his healing mutation and allow him to finally die - to Logan's surprise.  Fearful for the safety of Yashida's granddaughter (who stands to inherit the family empire after his death), Mariko (Tao Okamoto), Logan takes on the task of protecting her from a group of hired assassins.  Will Yun Lee, Svetlana Khodchenkova, Ken Yamamura, and Hiroyuki Sanada also star in supporting roles.

***END MINOR PLOT DETAILS / POSSIBLE SPOILERS***

It's relatively safe to say Hugh Jackman was born to play the role of Wolverine.  There is literally no scene to be found in this film - or any other X-Men film - where Jackman's portrayal of Logan is uninteresting or bland.  No, this isn't the Wolverine that many of us know and love from the comic books, but the cinematic version of the character borders on the brooding, temperamental character just enough to satisfy the needs of the plot throughout the course of the franchise.  For the most part, the attitude is right, the overall look of the character is acceptable, and Jackman's Australian accent is completely absent - not mention he's ripped beyond belief.  These vital characteristics continue to allow Jackman to excel at the cinematic role that's he's made famous.  Hopefully, Jackman will continue to answer to the call to play this character well beyond next summer's X-Men sequel.

Outside of the praise to Hugh Jackman, The Wolverine is a bit of a mixed bag in terms of plot vs. characters.  The plot of the film is relatively simple and doesn't try to do too much, allotting plenty of time for character development and story progression.  However, the plot severely lacks the presence of a prominent villain.  For all of its flaws, X-Men Origins at least had Victor Creed (Live Schreiber) and William Stryker (Danny Huston) in the driver's seat as clearly visible villains.  The Wolverine's main antagonist is split amongst a handful of characters (and an endless amount of thugs) that is rarely threatening to the well-being of Logan and his abilities.  Speaking of his abilities, Logan is kind of, sort of stripped of his powers (as seen in the trailers, so it's not like this is a spoiler).  This makes for the most bothersome and cluttered portion of the plot, which rarely makes sense, and there's little doubt the film would have been even better had the filmmakers not incorporated it.  Regardless, the Silver Samurai rears his ugly head as a disappointing variation of the classic villain - and even more disappointing is that the character's appearance is specifically reserved for a climactic showdown, meaning he's absent for the majority of the film.  Despite what you think you know about this character and regardless of who plays what on the credit sheet, there is plenty of cloud and misdirection that significantly ignores the comic book version.  So, if you're a major fan of this particular villain, you might want to tapper your expectations.

Oddly enough, The Wolverine doesn't seem as action-packed in comparison to previous X-Men films.  Still, there is plenty of action to go around, full of chase sequences and a ton of bad guys bitin' the dust - along with a pretty intense bullet train sequence that is visually impressive, even if it is unrealistic.  Surprisingly, there is quite a bit of downtime between action sequences, which is certainly welcomed and creates for a much more balanced film experience.  Typically, previous X-Men films use their unaccounted free space to incorporate cameos for characters that fans have been clamoring to see - such as Gambit or Juggernaut.  For the most part, The Wolverine is cameo free, making for a sustaining flow of drama, action, and brief moments of humor - which include a pretty humorous scene where Logan is taking a bath.

Overall, The Wolverine is a welcome addition to the X-Men franchise and serves as a great continuation after the events of the sub-par third installment, X-Men: The Last Stand.  While that particular film was a bit of a dud, it's nice to see this new standalone adventure didn't completely ignore that film's events. Hugh Jackman continues to own the role of Logan and this character continues to be one of the most entertaining comic book heroes on the big screen.  For once, it was nice to see a film that didn't revolve around the ""mutant crisis,"" which will no doubt be the center of attention in the franchise's next film, X-Men: Days of Future Past.  And - a word of advice:  don't you dare move from your seat until you see the additional scene that happens about midway through the credits.  There's absolutely no debating the fact that this scene alone is worth the price of admission.  It will set up next summer's sequel, and will leave a gigantic smile on the face of every single hardcore X-Men movie and comic book fan out there.

3610232,3,B001GCUO16,"""The Wolverine"" may not be a direct sequel to ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" but it will force people to remember a disastrous superhero film from 2009 that they had recessed deep within their memory core. ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" is a mess of a film known for rushing Marvel character favorites Gambit and Deadpool and bringing in a worldwide gross of over $373 million on a $150 million budget despite leaking onto the internet months in advance with incomplete special effects. ""The Wolverine"" hasn't gone without its issues either as Darren Aronofsky was originally attached as director, but was eventually replaced by James Mangold. Take solace in the fact that ""The Wolverine"" is the closest we'll ever get to an excellent Wolverine film.

Logan has essentially lost any reason to live in ""The Wolverine."" When he killed Jean, he realized that everyone around him dies while he continues to live with a curse that no man should ever have to carry on his shoulders. Jean, while only appearing in Logan's dreams, seems to almost act as Logan's conscience as she questions the decisions he's making and keeps asking when he'll join her in the afterlife. She serves as a source of encouragement for a way out for Logan, but in reality it's just a piece of the past that Logan can't let go of.

There is a ton of story in ""The Wolverine,"" so much that aside from the brief bar sequence at the opening of the film that the action doesn't really pick up for a good 30-40 minutes, but its speedball antics almost seem everlasting at times. The funeral battle that leads to a chase through an arcade as the archer Harada (Will Yun Lee) runs effortlessly on rooftop ledges lasts an incredibly long time. You're barely able to catch your breath when the exhausting speed train sequence kicks in. Jumping ahead, the arrow sequence near the end of the film is packed with exceptional imagery; Japanese rooftops lurking in the background at night, snow lightly falling on the ground, and the way dozens of ninjas attack Logan in this specific scene is just fantastically memorable.

The humor is very hit or miss whether it's Logan's scattered use of profanity or Logan feeling violated after his only bath and haircut in the film. Logan and Mariko (Tao Okamoto) stumbling onto a love hotel pushes the film's humor into awkward territory. While Noburo's (Brian Tee) pool scene could be considered the film's funniest scene, the scene where a wounded Logan is tended to by a veterinary student is where the film's flaws interrupt a near pleasant experience up to that point.

In the original comics and even in the ""X-Men"" cartoon from the early 90s, Wolverine not only had a history in Japan but also knew Japanese. Obviously some things had to be changed for the live-action films, but Logan not knowing any Japanese at all in ""The Wolverine"" seemed a little ignorant on his part. While the story is surprisingly well developed, is structurally solid, and story points are consistently introduced early on and returned to later, certain characters are really just downright boring. Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) is a key ingredient to Silver Samurai's uprising, but if it wasn't for her snake-like abilities using up the film's special effects budget the character would be nothing more than a Poison Ivy knockoff. While Harada is a really fun character to watch, the way his character is written is awful. He's loyal to one side and then the other because so-and-so is working with them, but then has a change of heart because a childhood friend stabs him in the thigh.

Thankfully, the sequence featuring ninjas on motorcycles from the first trailers for the film was removed for the theatrical cut of the film. The trailers also made it seem like Logan would just be cut repeatedly in the facial region throughout the entire film before healing and causing a bunch of drama for some reason. That isn't the case either. The finale of the film is downright fierce, especially the climax of the Silver Samurai/Wolverine battle. It's a shame you don't get to see more of Hiroyuki Sanada as Shingen though. He's mostly very arrogant in his scenes, but he has two extremely intense fight scenes that are incredibly entertaining.

The film is loaded with Japanese culture and history, which is one of the reasons the story is as strong as it is. The film isn't exactly a Disney film either as Wolverine bleeds a lot, blood is constantly shown on his claws, and blades are seen piercing through people's torsos, while James Mangold has promised a more violent version on Blu-ray. However, what they do to the Silver Samurai character is tragic. It may make sense for the story, but turning the character into a giant adamantium machine waters down the original character a bit. It reminds you too much of ""Iron Man"" and once you make that connection ""The Wolverine"" seems to have way more in common with ""Iron Man"" than it should.

""The Wolverine"" is a vast improvement over ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine."" It's more story driven than its predecessor, utilizes all of the new characters introduced to their full potential, and sets up next year's ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" in a really satisfying way (for the love of Galactus stay through the end credits). ""The Wolverine"" tries so hard to be the best live-action film incarnation of Wolverine out there and it mostly succeeds, but its little issues are just enough to keep the film from being exceptional.",1374710400,9,5442,4.838882921589689
3610233,5,B001GCUO16,"WOW!

There's a great sense of the epic in the story and at the same time there is an intimacy about his personal journey to rediscover himself!

It's a drama, a sci-fiction delight, and an action movie! It's romantic (A man's journey especially when seeking something about himself is always romantic, Japan as the backdrop adds to the mystery and enigma, and the relationships of Logan with women of different backgrounds and personal qualities are part of the story's emotional appeal), it's intriguing ( when getting deeper into the story and alien culture), and it's visually breathtaking and the heart throbs at the sounds of the battles!

I like fast-paced movies, with great story-telling, and fascinating characters -- and this movie suits the bill! I never disliked Origins (as some fans do) and had that been better edited and not focused on the mutant rainfall at the end, I was reminded of that movie with THE WOLVERINE, in the tone and romantic appeal of discovering a hero who is  not of the same template as other screen heroes.

Mangold and his creative team have delivered! Hugh, as always, marshalls his dramatic, romantic, and manly appeal to further enhance the Wolverine persona and admirable qualities! I wish the Oscars nominating committee would seriously consider roles of this nature when they look at the year's best!

An excellent movie of its genre... although it also represents great screen drama, with a sensitive character portrayal which sets it apart from other action heroes screen stereoptypes!",1374710400,9,1532,5.059523809523809
3610234,4,B001GCUO16,"""I'm the best there is at what I do, but what i do isn't very nice."" Hugh Jackman was perfectly cast as Wolverine, Liev Schemer is equally perfect as Sabertooth in this Xmen prequel. Most of ""Logan's"" secret origins are finally revealed, even of his coat, and possibly some of Sabertooth's too. Lots of great comic threads turn up in no particular order like Weapon X, along with lots of legendary Mutants long overdue for film: Cajun X-man Gambit, Silver Fox, the Blob, Cyclops, even Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool. I don't like the CGI sir Pat cameo at the finish but Over all an ok X-Film... Xceptional even",1374710400,,605,4.611111111111111
3610235,1,B001GCUO16,"I admit, I'm not a big X-Men fan, but even my wife who is obsessed with these movies agreed that this one is a slow, boring, disappointing, snore-fest.

It kicks off in the past with Logan as a prisoner in Japan before the big one drops. A solider from the Japanese prison camp is rescued by Wolverine and owes him his life. Cut to many years later, Logan is now a bum in the woods working for the animal protection agency of horribly fake CGI bears. A bear is killed, and Logan is off to the bar for a brawl. That's where he meets the granddaughter of the man from Japan who tells him not to bother with small men, and to come with her to Japan so her now dying grandfather can say goodbye and get one last kiss from Logan. Logan and her go back to Japan and it turns out her dying grandfather owns the biggest corporation in Japan and he actually wants to find out how to regenerate/heal himself as Logan can. Fights, fights, snore, snore, fight, snore, fight, robot, snore, end.

Overall, the opening scene has a slow motion explosion with a lot of people running around as a bomb is about to go off. Not all that much action. Then onto a long and drawn out snore fest of talking about this and that, and stupid dream sequences of whats-her-face now in love with Logan and not Cyclops. Makes sense, right? No. Pay's off in the end but, right? No.

There is 2 and a half mutants in this whole movie. This is X-Men right? The only new mutant other than Logan is a doctor introduced who is called Viper. She is a terrible actress, and a pretty disappointing character. All she does is sheds and licks things to death while having an annoying over confident attitude. Her role is pretty pathetic. The other one is the granddaughter of the Japanese guy, I think her name was Red Head Chun Li or something? and her sister is Princess no-body. Her mutant power? Shes a psychic. Is she even a mutant? Hardly. But you hear a reference to genes skipping a generation and she copped it. Lame, she's not a mutant. They only claim she is.

So, Logan is infected with something and loses his ability to heal, yet has enough remaining mutant power to not be killed by bullets and arrows and anything else they shoot at him. Does this sound familiar? A super hero loses his power and has to learn to remember what is like to be vulnerable again? Anyway, in the end Tony Stark, I mean Logan regains his powers, turns into the wolf and wins the high school basketball game. Wait, wrong movie again. Oh yeah, he earns a body guard and goes nowhere... literately.

There is not enough action, too much boring talking, and a stupid ending with Robo-Samari Man. Really, 2 and a bit mutants, one Wolverine, and a robot bad guy? What kind of X-men movie do you call this? I say it happened like this. ""Mr Jackman, we had a bunch of monkeys write a script to cash in on the X-men franchise. It's really sucky, but we will pay you a couple of million, sign here please"".

It's bad enough the prices to see movies in theatres these days, and there overpriced watered down drinks and expensive foods... people pay good money for these things these days... and yet they still produce crap like this today? IN AN X-MEN MOVIE? My god. WHY, HOW did this get made? WHO gave it the green light? This adds NOTHING to the overall story, and was just a dumb excuse to have a movie with Jackman in it again as a character people wanted to see him in, but he had better apologize big time for how disappointing this POS was.",1374710400,18,3488,4.333843797856049

3610240,2,B001GCUO16,"X-Men Origins Wolverine continues the downfall of the X-Men franchise.  The franchise had already taken a big dive because of X-Men the Last Stand, and this film did not help matters any.  Admittedly, I did enjoy this movie when I first saw it in the theaters.  However, the more I thought about and the more reviews I saw of it, my opinion changed on the film.  I can still watch it as a time waster but that is about it.  If I had to pick between this and X-Men 3 I like this a little more but they are both pretty bad.

Obviously this film is goes into Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) origins that the fans have been hoping to see for a while since X2.  We get to see him in the Weapon X program and how he lost his memory.  However, they did such a half-assed job that it would have been better if his origins had been left a mystery.  We got quite a bit of his origin in X-Men 2.  To me that is all that we really needed to know.  This movie to me is very much like the Star Wars Prequels (minus episode 3).  When I finally got to see Anakin's origin and the old republic, I thought that it should have remained a mystery.  To me the prequels kind of make me like the original films a bit less now.  I have the same feeling with Wolverine.

First of all why he joined the Weapon X project is lame and uninteresting.  At the start of the film he joined a team with his brother, Sabertooth, and other mutants like Deadpool, the Blob, etc.  However he quits and moves back to Canada.  Later Sabertooth murders his woman, and Wolverine wants revenge.  He goes to striker to be a part of the Weapon X program.  Wolverine's reason for joining Weapon X is due to some flimsy revenge motive that we've seen a million times.

I did not find Wolverine and Sabertooth's rivalry to be that engaging at all.  Plus Sabertooth as a character is both uninteresting and inconsistent.  In this movie Sabertooth is Wolverine's brother, but we never got any indication of that in the other movies.  Sabertooth seemed like he never knew  Wolverine in the first X-Men film.  This Sabertooth is quite intelligent, while the one in the first X-Men seemed very stupid and was just there to be the muscle.  In both movies I do not find Sabertooth to be an interesting character.

Also they have to through in random mutants into the film for no purpose.  The majority of these mutants are in the film just to be in the film.  Cyclops and Professor X make a cameo which does not amount to much.  Gambit also makes a cameo.  He is basically there because he had not been put into a movie yet until then.  These mutants take away precious time that could have been used to further develop Wolverine.  This should have been Wolverine's film with very few other mutants involved.

The worst thing though is what they did to Deadpool.  Deadpool is one mutant that I actually do not mind being in the film because he, like Wolverine, was in Weapon X.  In the comics Deadpool was involved in the Weapon X program and had regenerative abilities like Wolverine.  He is also supposed to be like Spiderman in that he cracks a lot of one-liners.  He is supposed to be very witty.  However, the filmmakers decided to ignore all of that and turn him into a videogame boss.  In this he not only has regenerative abilities but the powers of many other mutants' powers.  Plus is mouth is sealed shut, which takes away a major aspect of his character.  Needless to say Deadpool fans were not happy about these changes to the character to say the least.

The action scenes are okay but I have seen better in the other movies including the Last Stand.  The effects are good in some places, but in other places they looked off.  The effects in the other X-Men movies, again including the Last Stand, are much better which is sad because those movies were made years before this.

Overall I do not recommend this movie.  This movie could have easily been great but they just dropped the ball.  Hopefully the new Wolverine is actually good.  It looks like they are actually focusing on Wolverine and not incorporating many random mutants which is a good sign.",1374019200,4,4109,4.40612516644474

Don't get me wrong, this is an enjoyable movie and the special feature shows everything that they did to make it a bigger and better film as it concentrated on one character.

Maybe over time, I'll have a better opinion of it; but for now, it's enjoyable but just not one I'd want to see again and again and again.",1368403200,,720,4.301470588235294

Not knowing the story behind Wolverine, other than he was my son's favorite, I wasn't sure what to expect.

But, just because I want something more exciting doesn't mean that I want gory and evil.

Can not the authors make something exciting without also including violent and gory scenes? Are they really that incapable? I believe that authors are capable of making exciting without explicit gore or sex, and I challenge them to not be so lazy as to move right from boring to evil.

I know there are a lot of people out there like me who have no genre of movie that appeals to them wholeheartedly, so they (I) watch these types of movies because there are no alternatives. It is a disappointment that all of these millions of dollars to make a movie, and they don't have higher expectations of their authors.

3610310,4,B001GCUO16,"Like many Generation X'rs, I'm a big fan of the XMen. I saw, and subsequently purchased, all three previous XMen titles and thoroughly enjoyed them. I think in those cases it was nice to see how the characters were discovered and how they grew in the XMen Universe.

In the case of this first ""Origins"" picture, I think many of us really wanted to see how the ""legend of the animal"" (Wolverine) would play out on the big screen, well in this case, the flat screen plasma. I for one welcomed the chance to see how the characters would come together. In a word, the characters fell ""FLAT"". Aside from Sabretooth, the other characters were not fleshed out very well. Yes, Stan Lee and Company probably assumed that most people read the XMen comics and know the backstories and bi-lines of each character in the movie. I'm going from the standpoint here of someone who did not, though in all honesty, I do.

In my opinion, too much was crammed into too little screen time, resulting in a poorly executed mess, with great visual and audio effects. Yes, we just HAD to see:

1) the half-brother link between Wolverine and Sabretooth and how they fought in so many wars over like a hundred year timeframe
2) how Wolverine and the special strike team (team X) came into existence and what types of special ops assignments they carried out
3) Wolverines relationship with mutant girl-friend Silver Fox
4) how Gambit and Wolverine made acquaintance
5) how DeadPool was created and so much more.

The thing is, it would have been nice to stretch the movie out perhaps an extra 20 or 30 minutes and really, really dig deeper into each situation while making the segue's less jarring and difficult to handle. The movie was a mere 109 minutes. An extra 20 or 30 minutes would not have made the movie unbearable. I mean, many movies in the theaters nowadays are about 2 - 2 1/2 hours long anyway.

Like the previous 3 XMen movies, XMen Origin's action was top notch. The CG effects were done almost perfectly and believably. Well, let me rephrase that. The CG effects were believable MOST of the times. 2 times that come to mind that are laughably cheesy are 1) when Wolverine's adamantium claws in certain shots looked like poor, cartoony paper renditions of metal and 2) the diamondesque exterior of Emma Frost looked like a 4 year old child with loads of Elmer's Glue, ""Bedazzle Beads"" and silver glitter was unleashed onto the actress. If you have a decent surround sound setup, your sub(s) and surround speakers will truly be exhausted come the ending credits.

Some of the mutant characters that make an appearance in this film (in no particular order) are:

WOLVERINE
SABRETOOTH
DEADPOOL
SILVER FOX
THE BLOB/FRED DUKES
AGENT ZERO/MAVERICK
JOHN WRAITH/KESTREL
BOLT
EMMA FROST
CYCLOPS

Bone claws and animal strength and attitude emerge, accompanied by healing power. The film tells how Logan and Victor, who will eventually become Wolverine and Saber Tooth, are half brothers. How each is innately quite similar, but both become quite different.  Victor slowly becomes savage and brutal, Logan becomes feral and primal. Victor a monster, and Logan a warrior and lover.

Logan is manipulated into volunteering for the adamantium experiment. The process is so damaging that Logan's system flat lines for a minute. Then his healing factor brings him back. His bones made invulnerable, and his claws turned into blades.

This movie explains Stryker's hatred of mutants, and his connection to Wolverine. Explains how Logan got amnesia, and the reason for his code name ""Wolverine"".

3610333,4,B001GCUO16,"This movie was pretty good but it doesn't follow the comics and is quite rediculous at time. In the original story line, Wolverine was the only member of the X-Men that wasn't born with powers but actually gained these powers as a military experiment to build a super solder. And the bone claws are just rediculous. If you can get past these flubs, the movie is pretty good with a lot of action and a decent story line (though I kept being reminded that this was not the original story line). Though I like the X-Men franchise, I believe they could have done a much better job with this movie with just a little more effort. Most of the poeple on these movies don't actually care about the original stories, they just want the name recognition so they can get better jobs, to hell with the story.",1356220800,,796,4.421768707482993

3610338,3,B001GCUO16,"I love the X-Men series.  With stars such as Sir Patrick Stewart, Sir Ian McKellen, Hallie Berry, and Hugh Jackman, the franchise is terrific, one that I really enjoy watching the movies over and over again on DVD.

Of the five X-Men films to date, however, I confess I enjoyed this film the least for its sometimes excessive violence, particularly by Wolverine's older brother, Sabertooth.  Hugh Jackman is brilliant -- as you expect -- but the writing is just not quite as solid as it is with the original trilogy nor with X-Men First Class.  It's simply just a bit too much of a violent blockbuster and not quite enough heart to it.  I was especially disappointed in the treatment of Scott Summers (Cyclops) as Cyclops has always been one of my favorite characters.

There was also a continuity goof with the film with regards to the very brief appearance of Professor Charles Xavier who is shown STANDING on his own two legs, even though his scene is set fairly close to the present -- long after Xavier was paralyzed.  While this could be explained by his appearance being a psychic illusion (which Xavier is readily capable of), the X-Men franchise has typically done a very good job at making the distinction between reality and what Professor Xavier projects telepathically.  Without such a flash to reality, his appearance makes very little sense.

Probably the best part of this film comes through the appearance and use of Gambit (Remy LeBeau) who in many ways steals the show.  In a film largely absent of fan favorite mutants, Gambit is the one face those of us who have seen the other films (and animated series before that) can relate to.",1355184000,,1653,4.7282229965156795
3610339,3,B001GCUO16,"For fans of the wolverine, I think that this is a good entry point for the franchise and that's about it. No deep plot, no great acting and a lot of things don't make sense. If you can put all that aside and just enjoy mindless action and nostalgic characters from the comics, you will be ok.",1355184000,,292,4.140350877192983

3610341,5,B001GCUO16,"After a traumatic event, young Wolverine and his brother Victor run away from home and throw themselves into a series of wars, ranging from the Civil War to Vietnam (They age MUCH slower than a normal person, and are also nearly unable to die. Lucky.) They join a special squad of mutants, and follow lots of orders they don't really understand or agree with, and soon Wolverine is getting sick of the whole thing. Victor, however, is growing to love it more. Too much. Finally, something snaps, and Wolverine bails, opting for a quiet life in the Canadian(?) countryside. Of course, a quiet life was never meant to be for Wolverine, and soon enough his world is being turned upside down again by the people he'd forsaken years ago, hoping never to see again. Lies turn out to be true, truths turn out to be lies, and you'll never look at Wolverine the same again.

As always, Hugh Jackman is an amazing actor, and the only one I can imagine for the character of Wolverine. He even made that one scene with the stereotypical ""NOOOOOOOOO!"" not that bad. Sabertooth was an even better choice: Liev Schreiber fits this role to a 't'! I absolutely loved him in this, and couldn't wait for scenes with him in them. Just the right amount of cockiness, a hint of insanity in the eyes, and a smug grin that I couldn't hate no matter how hard I tried. Absolutely perfect.

I haven't seen this pair together since ""Kate and Leopold,"" and I couldn't be more pleased with their chemistry on set. It just... fits.

Off the actors and on to the movie itself: The comedy isn't strong by any means, but it does show itself occasionally, and usually hits its mark without seeming clich or dumb. It isn't ""laugh for hours"" funny, but it should give you a little smile to break up all the seriousness.

This movie is a prequel to the X-Men trilogy, and it details Wolverine's life from childhood (a brief coverage) to where he is at the beginning of the first X-Men movie. His past with lifetime enemy Sabertooth, his transformation into an Adamantium-boned weapon, his quest for revenge wrought with so many twists and turns that it'll leave you staggered, and how he becomes the man with no memory, searching for answers, that we see in the main trilogy.

There's a whole lot of action in this movie: things blowing up, machine guns, awesome mutant fight scenes, but it doesn't get stale like so many others with TOO MUCH action. There's still a strong story-telling element that allows for action without overshadowing the whole point of the show and leaving you with that ""are they done fighting yet?"" feeling. (Personally, I got that feeling from the Lord of the Rings and Narnia fight scenes, so you can use that as a scale if you want.)

I've heard a lot of negative feedback about the character of Deadpool, mostly from fans of the original comics, but I (who hasn't read the comics) find no problem with him. His story is not canon (in agreement with the original), but it works well with the movie. Bottom line: if you've read the comics and can't imagine Deadpool any other way, you're going to hate him in this movie. If you're like me and haven't read it, or are open to a different take on him, he's a pretty sick villain. I've also heard complains about Will.i.am being cast as John Wraith, but I honestly liked him. Yeah, he's rapper, that doesn't mean he HAS to be a bad actor.

Oh, and stick around for the end of the credits. In typical Marvel style, you'll get a little tidbit if you do, and it absolutely sent shivers up my spine! A brilliant last touch. And no, it's not Samuel L. Jackson!

For me, a really great movie has to have that moment of realization, where (sometimes simultaneously with the main character) you just GET IT. You get WHY and HOW and it gives you goosebumps. It's an awesome feeling, and this had that for me.

In conclusion I will say once again: If you're a rabid fan of the comics, you aren't going to like this. It's not canon and other mutants only appear briefly (than again, it's not their names in the title of the movie, right?). But, if you're open to viewing this as separate from (maybe even unrelated to) the comics, or have never read them at all, I really think you're going to love it.

Thanks for reading all my ranting! This was my first review.",1355097600,,4290,4.5096525096525095

But if your a X-Men fan in general or die hardcore fan then pick this movie up and watch how the character Wolverine came about from both what you already know and what info you may not know yet.

What I liked about this movie:
1. Hugh Jackman gave us an excellent performance as Wolverine
once again!
2. Ryan Reynolds was great as Deadpool!
3. The visual effects were great!
4. Most of the under foot actors were great!
5. Gambit was awesome!

What I didn't like about the movie was:
1. My biggest complaint is; what the heck did they do to Deadpool
at the end of the movie?!?!
2. Most of the action sequences in the movie felt forced!
3. They under used too many characters!
4. The movie kept building-up and building-up, but the pay off in
the end was not satisfying!
5. I am still confused if this is a reboot or a prequel to the first
three movies...!
6. Too many dull moments/ the pace was not good!

not good!

3610367,5,B001GCUO16,"I had read many negative and mediocre reviews of this movie, but finally decided to get it anyway.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It was actually a very good movie, though my son commented that the scene with Wolverine walking away from an explosion was a bit contrived.

Like the other X-Men movies, it doesn't always follow the comic storyline, and some characters are different from the way they were in the comics.  However, taken on its own, this movie tells an interesting story of Wolverine's background, and successfully captures his basically good, decent character, without ignoring some of the things he has had to do in his life (and including the action scenes that are part of why people watch Wolverine).  It also gave a good look at Gambit, which finally made me able to see the charm of this character.

There is some timeline continuity problem between this movie and X-Men First Class, and a little with the later movies.  At the end of First Class, Xavier is around 30 and still has his hair when he is paralyzed.  Near the end of this movie, there is a short scene of a bald Xavier walking.  Also, Scott Summers is a minimum of 14 in 1962 in this movie, and seems no older than 30 in X-Men 1, set somewhere in the 1990s (when he should have been at least 44 for continuity to work).

Overlooking these details (after all, the comics contradict each other periodically, too), this is an enjoyable movie and worth getting.  I actually liked it better than First Class (which I also enjoyed), though that one has better reviews.",1325462400,5,1545,4.622710622710622

The only real complaint that I have is that there are parts of the movie where it is difficult to ignore the CGI effects.  I understand what they were trying to go for, but if I can tell a scene is obviously computerized then I have a hard time focusing on what is happening vs. how fake something is.",1325376000,,499,4.123711340206185
3610369,5,B001GCUO16,"I have been an X-Men fan since I was a child. Wolverine was always the toughest one around and he carried an attitude to match. Hugh Jackman plays the role to perfection and this movie is a great synopsis of the origins of one of the X-Men and one of my personal favorite characters.

Wolverine and his brother are invincible warriors and their amazing healing powers make these mutants able to heal quickly, stay in the fight and maybe even immortal! The US government uses them and modifies them to enhance their fighting capabilities and the result is scary. Wolverine is out for vengeance and no one had better stand in his way.

Wolverine's brother is played by Liev Schreiber who does a wonderful job fulfilling the role as a real bad dude without many moral ethics of doing whatever he wants to win. He makes a good villain to Wolverine's vision quest to regain his lost past. In the end Sabertooth, (Liev Schreiber) does just enough to help his brother against a common foe!

I love this movie for the storyline and the great special effects. It helps you to understand Wolverine's personality, special skills and his amnesia about his past. I hope the X-Men saga continues in more movie releases. They are great!",1324944000,,1221,4.669767441860465
3610370,3,B001GCUO16,"It was bound to happen,a movie centered around the star mutant of the X-MEN,our favorite adamantium wielding weapon X experiment,Wolverine. In many ways X-MEN Origins Wolverine comes across as a western film littered with Mutants at every turn. Deadpool,The Blob,Gambit,and a handful of other mutant elite make their screen debut during the course of the film while a few familiar faces return as well. liev schreiber gives the character Saber-tooth (simply known as Victor Creed in this film) the big screen portrayal the mutant deserves. Far surpassing the henchmen like role given to Tyler Mane in the original X-MEN movie. Hugh Jackman is bigger than ever with muscles bulging in every scene, though the film falls short of really showing a darker side to Wolverine he never loses the bad ass appeal that makes him so lovable as a super hero.
The western vibe works to a large degree but also causes the themes of the original X-MEN trilogy to lose significant power in the process. The idea of mutants simply becomes a cover to display powers as opposed to showing opposistion from the world at large.

The biggest problem with this film is that instead of sticking more closely to Wolverine's true origins the film makers attempt to change a little too much for the films own good. The way in which Logan gains his trademark amnesia is bizarre to say the least. Another problem I had with this film is that instead of sticking to Wolverine's origins the film also attempts to tell a larger tale in showing us the beginnings of at least one of the X-MEN and ends up feeling too forced in the end.

To sum things up Wolverine is a fun movie packed with mounds of un-ending action that manages to roughly ride over a few potholes in the process. The end product is a mixed bag of adrenaline and dissapointment. The mutants (and humans alike) are intriguing and rarely does an action film cover such a large spectrum of character types but we see far too little of most of them.

Bluray quality and special features:

Comparing the DVD next to the bluray back to back didn't yield any large improvements though a few small things where noticable.

The Bluray has some very nice special features including small bio's for every character played by the actors.",1324944000,,2260,4.740458015267175
3610371,5,B001GCUO16,"I've been wanting to see a Wolverine movie that lives up to how the man is the comics. Too many times in the movies, characters are watered down to make them more appealing to those who aren't into comics so much and, because of this, comic book fans(like me) feel like we've been cheated. Thankfully, X-Men Origins: Wolverine etches that much closer to what Wolverine is in the comics and that makes this movie worthwhile in my books.

X-Men Origins: Wolverine tells the tales of how Wolverine came to be, with the story beginning in 1845. Young James Howlett sees his father killed by their groundskeeper Thomas Logan. This trauma brings about James mutation with bones protruding from his hands. He then proceeds to kill Thomas Logan. Before he does, however, Logan tells James that he is his father. He flees with Thomas' son, Victor Creed, who is his half-brother. That's where the movie begins. The conclusion is pretty epic, I assure you, but to find out- you'll have to watch the movie.

In my opinion,this has to be Hugh Jackman's best performance as Wolverine. In what little time he's been Wolverine, he's taken the character and encompassed what he truly is. I know many were disappointed with this movie, in general, but I felt that it was a good(if not great) movie in the X-Men series(definitely better than X-Men First Class, even though this one came out long beforehand).

I've read a sequel is in the works to this movie, simply called:The Wolverine. I've also read that the sequel might sport an R-rating. I'd really love to see that happen so that Wolverine fans can really see their beloved character 'cut loose'. I've only seen one other movie to ever really show a Marvel character for what it was and that was Punisher: War Journal(one I also recommend). Here's hoping we see it happen.",1321228800,15,1811,4.742857142857143

You see his infancy.  they don't tell you what happened at this birth, if his claws came later or any of that type of information.  But from the very beginning it is a movie that grabs your attention & hold on to it to the end.  Marvel is coming out with a lot of superheros & gods beginnings.  so I'm pretty sure that they are planning for a spectacular epic for us using all the characters that inhabit the Marvel Universe.  Because this movie here isn't just about Wolverine's origins but also of Sabertooth.  You also see a lot of the other characters that inhabit Marvelverse.

If you are a Wolverine fan, you will need this film.  If you like action movies, you will need this movie.  If you like Marvel movies so far, get this one because I'm pretty sure you're going to need it.

3610374,3,B001GCUO16,"If you're looking for a (comparatively) thoughtful, relevant superhero movie, like at least two of the original X-Men trilogy, then this probably isn't the one for you. But if you're looking for a good old-fashioned mindless action flick that happens to feature people with superpowers, pop it in!

X-Men Origins: Wolverine lacks may of the features that define the trilogy proper. There's no allegory, no philosophical questions about civil rights, disenfranchised minorities, or what it means to be human (or mutant). The thoughtful moments here, when they do appear, seem forced and do nothing but drag the movie down. The not-infrequent historical inaccuracies and lack of emotional depth would be grating...if this was meant to be the same kind of movie as its predecessors.

Origins is definitely a very different endeavor than the other X-Men movies, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. What Origins lacks in subtlety, it makes up for in fun! It's basically two hours of everybody's favorite mutant alternating between snarling and brooding, with some great cameos (my favorite was Deadpool, closely followed by Gambit) thrown in for flavor. There are great explosions, great fight sequences, and great special effects.

Basically, Origins has all the hallmarks of a great action movie, but none of the hallmarks of a great X-Men movie. It's got a deliciously smug villain, a beautiful-but-forgettable love interest, plenty of good one-liners (mostly deliverered by Ryan Reynolds, but Hugh Jackman himself gets a good one in now and then), REVENGE!!!!1!!, and, of course, a variety of mutant powers that just happen to facilitate the characters beating seven kinds of crap out of each other in increasingly creative ways. It's chock-full of plot holes, especially the ending, but all the actors seem to be having a lot of fun with their parts, and because they're having fun, the audience has fun.

3610376,5,B001GCUO16,"While the whole X Men franchise is a very entertaining collection of movies, I must say that until they took on the task of focusing on Wolverine's character I really wasn't in the true fan category.

I am a huge Hugh Jackman fan and I have always liked the Wolverine character  back in the cartoon series at least - never had the comic books  so this was a double 'gotta have a look' movie for me and I was delighted with what I found.

Not only was the story line well written and thought out, every character had their role and they played it well.  I really liked Liev Schreiber's character as Logan/Wolverine's brother and the new nemesis created a al Frankenstein by the mad Colonel.

The scenery was breathtaking, especially that gorgeous old farm where Logan/Wolverine runs to, fully naked, after the transformation surgery.  Utterly spectacular vistas!

The action was great without being over the top with a CGI glut.  The main thrust of tihs whole movie was the death of Logan and the birth of Wolverine and how it all came into being.

It was a great action movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it as pure entertainment.  An awesome movie for a rainy afternoon or a movie marathon weekend with family and friends!",1319155200,4,1219,4.623255813953488

The special forces are more brutal than what Wolverine wants to be. ""This isn't what we signed up for, "" he says as he walks out. He becomes a Canadian and lives quietly like as a lumber jack. His brother is on a rampage...and Wolverine's life becomes disrupted. He must once again fight, only this time he is stronger and is more of a killer.

The movie ties in nicely with the other 4 X-Men movies, which should be viewed to get an overall picture, which is difficult to obtain in this film alone. The acting was sufficient. Good CG, super action and fighting. It has plot twists, so pay attention.

3610383,5,B001GCUO16,"X-Men Origins Wolverine was released in theatres on May 1, 2009, available on DVD September 15, 2009, and directed by Gavin Hood. Starring Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber, Danny Huston and Dominic Monaghan, X-Men Origins Wolverine is the story before X-Men. It charts the beginnings for Wolverine also known as James Logan.
When Logan, played by Jackman, accidentally kills his own father in a fit of rage and is looked upon as a freak by his mother, he leaves home to find his place in the world. With the help of his half-brother, Victor, better known as Sabertooth (Schreiber), Wolverine embarks on a journey through wars and time to fight the forces of evil. Sabertooth soon becomes consumed with bloodlust and in disgust, Wolverine sets out on his own.
Years later, a mutant killer is on the loose and the government needs Wolverine's help to stop him. The indestructible Wolverine is then created. Inevitably, Wolverine is betrayed by those closest to him and he is then forced to take revenge & free the other enslaved mutants.
I absolutely enjoyed this movie. It was in-your-face exciting and the fight scenes were amazing and well choreographed. Wolverine was action-packed from start to finish and it answered so many questions about where Wolverine came from before joining the X-Men.
I would recommend this movie to all ages, young and old. You will be on the edge of your seat and hungry for the next installment of this fantastic series. If the astonishing action scenes don't keep you utterly enthralled then the story line will!

Tyler Kitsch was also good as Gambit, despite his role being more like an extended special appearance. Harry-Gregson Williams did the best ""X-men"" score I've heard to this film. And while I really had nothing against the way Brent Ratner handled ""X-Men: The Last Stand"", but Gavin Hood did a better job here.
I know I alot of people didn't like ""X-Men-Origins: Wolverine"", there were definitly too many mutant characters to juggle in this story.

3610389,4,B001GCUO16,"Marvel comics X-Men character Wolverine gets his own movie X-Men Origins:Wolverine. The movie originally released in North America in May/2009 stars Hugh Jackman as,of course,Wolverine and a fine job he does reprising his role as the fearsome mutant. Legendary comic writer/creator Stan Lee is also back in the production department.
The story starts out back in the 1800s as we see two brothers in a room,one sick in bed(it appears as an on going issue)and the other at his side. A man comes in to comfort him and soon has to leave abruptly as there is a commotion downstairs. Not too long after a shot rings out and his ""father""lays dead on the floor. The ""sick"" boy comes out to witness the scene and leaps in rage at the man who appeared to kill his father and kills him. It turns out he has just killed his real father who had come to get his son. The man on the floor was a doctor of some type who had done experiments on his brother and himself. The boys flee their ""home"" for good.
The movie progresses ahead through time as the brothers reach manhood and are seen in various wars,world and otherwise;very little aging having taken place. The last war they engage in is the Vietnam War as the Wolverine's brother Victor(Liev Schreiber)has gotten them both into hot water. After a military firing squad fails to dispatch the pair they are recruited from jail to join a black ops project,which turns out to be a mutant squad. The head of this project is one Col. Stryker(Dan Huston).Time passes and Stryker's team is in Nigeria finding out the origins to a mysterious piece of metal called adamantium. It is on this mission that Wolverine calls it quits.
Wolverine goes to Canada and leaves the life of a humble lumberjack. In the meantime the black ops mission he left has not stopped but actually stepped up its protocol. They fake the Wolverine's fiancee's death in order for him to become so bent on revenge that he submits to being injected with an admantium compound. He becomes experiment#10,and a successful one at that. He goes after his brother Victor but it turns out Victor is just a red herring. Col. Stryker as usual is the one pulling all the strings. In fact Stryker has been rounding up mutants the world over and depositing them on an island which we later learn turns out to be the infamous nuclear reactor facility of Three Mile Island.
The Wolverine makes his way there and in the resulting struggles manages to free all of the captive mutants. His brother Victor,who has been popping in and out of the plot,helps the Wolverine to defeat experiment#11;a composite not only of the Wolverine but of some of the other captive mutants held there. The captives manage to find their way out of the facilities and who should be waiting in a stealth helicopter outside,but Xavier himself(Patrick Stewart).Meantime Col. Stryker has created some admantium bullets to stop the Wolverine with. While they don't kill him the Colonel pops two into his brain which causes a terrible memory loss. The movie ends with the Wolverine on his own,confused and fleeing the authorities who arrive on the scene.
The movie,while not jam packed with weird and wonderful mutants showing off their wares like the previous X-Men films(which I can see would a problem with those expecting this),still has many wonderful and exciting moments throughout as the pace/plot winds its way to its inevitable conclusion. We certainly see a more human side to this character and we have much more empathy for him now that we know where he came from and why. Jackman,et al,do a wonderful job in their parts and the special effects are top notch.
Technically speaking the movie has been transferred well and is in its original a/r of 2:35:1. The trailer is packaged here along with a featurette on the origins of the Wolverine in the comics and movies.
All in all a recommended movie for all fans of the other X-Men films. The movie is fast paced,has some nice action tucked here and there and the S/FX are great. Recommended.",1307836800,2,4012,4.716524216524217

Honestly, this was a staple argument/discussion amongst fans for almost *30 years*. And until the official published work by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jemas-Quesada-Jenkins-in-2002/dp/0785137270/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jemas/Quesada/Jenkins in 2002</a>&nbsp;- was a secret on par with Watergate's Deep Throat in terms of lore and provocation.

For regular film fans - that scene is four-and-a-half minutes long. <g>

Despite enormous reservations, I found myself actually enjoying this latest installment of the X-Men franchise. Infinitely better than the craptacular disaster of 'The Last Stand'. Good grief, I'll watch almost anything but that shyte pile.

Hugh Jackman reminds me of Roger Moore. Why? Because like Moore, he found the one role he was born to play - but sadly it will always be that 'one role' for all of film eternity. Certainly Moore has done other good things, '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sea-Wolves/dp/B000E5N6KW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sea Wolves</a>' comes to mind. But there's no escaping the career defining character that he will be forever linked to - you know it without any prompting. And so goes the career of Jackman.

Personally never found any of Jackman's performances, with the lone exception of '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Prestige/dp/B000LC55F2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Prestige</a>', of any worth or value. His acting has the emotional reach and agility of a tree sloth. Don't even ask about his freakish natural smile. Ugh. But as Wolverine - he absolutely rocks. You would be hard pressed to think of anyone besides him in the role of Mr. Berserker Fury. Pitch perfect, the true embodiment of Len Wein's vision.

I'm actually a bit surprised and amused to read some reviews which comment on the comic-level characterizations and plot. Seriously? Some people actually thought this was going to be ... what...'The Godfather' in terms of depth of character and storyline?

A fun-filled flick filled with decent-to-spectacular special effects. And a big thumbs up for Jackman's superlative, and always reliable, performance in his career vehicle.

One last worthy note: Kevin Durand's Blob. I'm genuinely floored to see him take on this role. Until 'Origin', I could not imagine him doing anything other than big bad stud. So this was a real stretch of his acting muscles, so to speak. A repertoire enhancement for him. Kudos.",1302912000,3,2685,5.973958333333333

This also looks at his relationship with his brother, who is excellently played by Liev Schreiber, after they fight in numerous wars together and then become estranged after becoming mutant mercenaries. Jackman plays this just like the other X-Men films, all gruff and angry and there is no real nuance to his acting, but for a gutsy, all action role you don't really need tenderness or finesse. There are plenty of fights and explosions here to keep action fans pleased and this also ties in the later films and introduces some of the characters we are to meet down the line. The story is pretty formulaic and you can guess nearly all the twists and turns from the outset, but for a reasonably decent action film and a worthy addition to the X-Men franchise this isn't too bad at all.

Plus many many more.

But like I said most characters are a fleeting guest. This movie revolves around Wolverine vs Sabertooth vs William Stryker. An officer who is trying to ""build"" a team of super-humans. I quote the term build because it's a plot device. I don't want to spoil the film if you haven't seen it.

The movie shows Sabretooth and Wolverine to be related. They both survive multiple wars until they are recruited by Stryker.

Things have a way of going bad and Wolverine quits.

Flash forward a few years and someone is killing off the team of super-humans on Stryker's team.

But there's more to Stryker than building a team.

This film has some cussing in it. The violence is PG-13 which means there's hardly any blood (if any). There's no sexual content except for a scene with Wolverine and his girlfriend? resting in bed.

The plot also details his early encounters with Colonel William Stryker, the Weapon X program, Wolverine's interactions with other mutants and his complex relationship with his half-brother Victor Creed.

Hearing the reactions from the majority of the people that have seen this film, I'm not surprised that the movie was disappointing. This film suffers from what X-Men 3 did and more: It has too many characters in one short running time, although the film felt like it never seemed to end. Including that, the story wasn't that good and the film felt like it should have never been made. What's the point? Why would anyone want to know the origins of Wolverine? Well, if you do, why would anyone want to sit through such a disappointing origins story?

It's apparent the filmmakers didn't spend a lot of time with the whole story. I've never read the comics so I wouldn't know if the film translated what was on page to screen or not. Even in the first few scenes, I was laughing through my mind because of Wolverine's horrible-looking bone claws. The origins story also didn't add much to Wolverine's past. And for the first time, I'll say that the CGI in here was a bit cheesy and very unreal. When Wolverine actually plays with his steel claws for the first time, the CGI looks horrible and cartoonish.

With the many characters here, I felt like Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber, and Will i Am were the best ones here. I feel sorry for Jackman, because you can tell he's trying to do his best with the source he has been given, along with the rest of the cast. I found Lynn Collins very annoying, though, as Wolverine's girlfriend. Ryan Reynolds was decent, although he appears for only a short time in the film and Taylor Kitsch was good too as Gambit.

With the negatives aside, I liked one thing: Split the film into three parts and I liked the last, third part. I really found the film enjoyable from that to the end, including an interesting way how they connected the last scenes to the first X-Men film. I also found the action sequences above par, especially the last sequence. Overall, I'm not surprised that I was going to be disappointed. I do like the third part of the film, though so I'll give the film that. If you're a fan, you can see it, although it may not be the best origins story to tell.",1288656000,,2477,4.597285067873303

3610421,3,B001GCUO16,"Little James was born in the 1800s, always sick. His family background . . . well, he didn't have much of one, at least, one that cared. Except for his friend, Victor. One night, during a drunken upset with his later-to-be-found-out father, James learned he could produce bone claws from his hands and defends himself, killing his father.

That night, James and Victor are on the run, and promise to always stick together. The years go by and the two find a great outlet for their rage: war. Victor (Liev Schreiber) also has a special ability and he is more animal than man, with claws coming out of his fingers. The two are very similar and age very slowly. War after war goes by, and the two eventually end up working with a secret team run by William Stryker (Danny Huston). While on one mission, James-now calling himself Logan (Hugh Jackman)-feels Victor has gone too far in his attack on an innocent and walks out on the group.

Years later, the group's been disbanded and Stryker comes to warn Logan that Victor is behind the recent string of deaths of its former members. The only way Logan will be strong enough to fight the always-stronger Victor is to undergo a special experiment of Stryker's own design: graft the indestructible adamantium to his bones. Logan agrees.

But there's something Stryker hasn't told him about what's been going on and when Logan finds out, he's furious and wages an all-out one-man war against Stryker, Victor and anyone else who stands in his way.

On the action: cool fight scenes and neat concepts. However, it seemed to me Logan was a little too acrobatic and was able to survive way more and take way more pain than even a mutant with a healing ability could.

On the story: works for me, in that we knew Logan had a history going in. He was the star of the X-Men movies after all, and X2 especially focused on Logan's origins as much as they were able without detracting from the main story. I did like seeing what really went on and, more specifically, how Logan lost his memory. I was under the impression that he lost it because of the adamantium experiment and not after it. Doesn't matter, but I did feel for the guy when the love of his life wasn't all she was cracked up to be.

On Deadpool, because, you know, it has to be covered: the whole story involving the secret ops group Logan was a part of made for fun action. Deadpool's origin, hey, why not. To be honest, I don't know if they followed the comics or not because I'm more a DC guy than a Marvel one and don't know too much about Deadpool other than he's the ""merc with a mouth."" His transformation from normal-looking Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) to disfigured Wade-good stuff.

Was this a perfect movie? No, unfortunately. It felt too cartoony as opposed to carrying with it the realistic tone the other X-movies had, namely the first two.

Will I see the sequel? Absolutely. I'm a saga guy so I want to see what happens next.

Check this film out if you're the superhero-movie-completist type like me.

3610422,3,B001GCUO16,"I didn't want to like X-Men Origins: Wolverine When it was announced the movie was in the works, along with X-Men Origins: Magneto, I cringed. I cringed because it reeked of gimmick. What Marvel Comics does (to be fair, DC Comics does the same thing) is create an ""event""-a rather long and convoluted storyline-that is spread out over every title published by Marvel Comics. The reader is almost forced to buy every single comic in Marvel's lineup in order to understand what is going on in the story.

At $ 3.99 a comic, the gimmick pays off quite well for Marvel. It was also announced, around the same time, that there would be a Captain America movie (Captain America: The First Avenger; which is now being filmed), followed by a Thor movie (again being filmed), and then another Iron Man movie (Iron Man 3 for those of you keeping score). After all three of these films are completed Marvel Studios is going to start production on an Avengers movie. The Avengers movie will star all the players from the other Marvel movies, including Edward Norton as the Hulk. I can only assume that the major players signed contracts stating that they would do an Avengers movie.

Seeing Marvel Studios trying and pull the same gimmick in the movies left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I already had a biased view of X-Men Origins: Wolverine. I knew that it wasn't going to be any good. There was no way that this was going to be any good. However, a funny thing happened on the way to the ending credits. I started enjoying Wolverine.

It isn't an Academy Award winning movie by any stretch of the imagination. The movie has its fair share of problems, but with these kinds of movies you have to expect some problems. For instance, after only one mission we are suppose to believe that Logan, Victor Creed and the rest of the commando unit are a tight knit group. I can buy that the rest of the group as a tight knitted group because we are told how they went on more missions after Logan left. But, how the whole group was tight with Logan is a mystery because they were only on one mission together.

What sets the movie in motion is the death of Logan's girlfriend, Kayla. Of course, she never died. It turned out that she was given a drug that slowed her heart down so that it appeared that she were dead. It's a pretty bad story device, but Shakespeare did the same thing, right? However, when he wrote Romeo and Juliet it hadn't been done a million times. But this isn't Shakespeare it's Wolverine. As far as storytelling is concerned, using the fake death ploy is not only played out, but it's a device used by weak writers. What makes her ""death"" even more ridiculous is the character of Wolverine. Wolverine is supposed to have heightened senses-smell, vision, taste, the whole nine yards-he would have known that Kayla wasn't dead. I watch enough TRU TV to know that dead bodies don't give off heat. Of course, it would take some time for the body to grow cold, but he would have felt her body growing colder.  It gets even worse when we see Victor Creed pouring blood on her to ""further"" the illusion. Maybe I am going out on limb here, but wouldn't fresh blood smell different than blood that has been stored in a refrigerator somewhere? And why wouldn't he have noticed that there wasn't a mark on her?

It In Wolverine we finally learn how Logan lost his memories and the reason is just as cheesy as the faked death. It turns out that a bullet- an adamantium bullet- in the brain is the reason. But, we've seen Logan take a bullet to the brain before and nothing happened to him.

I need to point out that when we saw him get shot in the head in X-Men 2 the bullet was in his head. It didn't ricochet off his adamantium skull; the bullet went into his brain. We even see it pop out when he heals. So, why did one bullet take his memories and the other one didn't? Now I'm not a brain surgeon or a metallurgist, so I am only guessing when I say that any type of metal shot into your brain is a bad thing. The writers and the director could have chosen any number of ways that his memories could have been erased. For instance, they could have said that the process of grafting adamantium onto his bones was so painful that his mind shut down as a means to cope with the pain. There could have been some sort of malfunction to the equipment that resulted in the memory loss. An even better reason would be that his memories were erased on purpose!

Think about it. If you were the mad scientist creating the ultimate killing machine wouldn't you have wiped his memories? When he learns what you did to him and his girlfriends don't you think that he would be a little ticked off? Think of your own reasons. Anything would have been better than the reason that we were given.

I hate to say it because I like Ryan Reynolds, but there was zero reason that he should have been in the movie. Well, I guess there is one reason-Reynolds had already been cast to play Deadpool (A movie spin-off of a movie spin-off. Yeah, there's not gimmick there) in the upcoming movie. He delivers his lines in his trademarked sarcastic tone, but you get the feeling that there is somewhere else that Reynolds wants to be.

I know that it sounds like I just tore the whole movie apart, but I still found things in the movie that I enjoyed. The staples of superhero movies are well represented. Things blow up, guns are fired in ultra-cool ways, and bullets are sliced in mid-air. The special effects are great. The stand out scene is when Deadpool's head, eyes still blasting lasers, falls down one of 3 Mile Island's cooling towers and cuts it to pieces.  Watching it crumble to the ground was a visual treat.

The fight scenes were well choreographed with no restrictions on cable work. In the opening credits we follow Logan and Victor as they move through history one war after another. Each war, beginning with the Revolutionary War, seamlessly flows into the next war finally stopping during the Vietnam War. Not only do the opening credits show the audience that the two characters have been around for centuries, it also manages to show what turned Victor into the monster that we see during the rest of the movie.

Wolverine is just as good as, if not better than, other superhero movies. Which to some people is not saying a lot, but if you look at the three main roles Wolverine does have a lot more talent than some other superhero movies. Hugh Jackman is a talented actor. To say that he is not a talented actor is simply not true. If you don't want to watch him sing and dance (which he has received a Tony Award for) then watch The Prestige, The Fountain, or Deception for proof that he has talent.

Jackman gets to a do little comedy to lighten the mood. Liev Schreiber, as Victor Creed, and Danny Huston, as William Stryker, compliment Jackman's performance perfectly. Before he came to the attention of mainstream audiences as Cotton Weary in the Scream trilogy, Schreiber starred in independent and small budget features. However, it has been in movies like The Hurricane, The Manchurian Candidate and Defiance that Schreiber has made a name for himself. He's often cast in good guy roles. As Victor Creed, he gets to show us that he can do mean and nasty too.

I have a list that I call ""You May not Know the Name, but You Know the Face."" I'm always adding names to it, but rarely am I taking names off. Danny Huston is easily in the top ten. If it weren't for the make up, that made him almost unrecognizable, fans of the comic genre would recognize him as the head vampire, Marlow, in 30 Days of Night. Others may remember him from The Number 23, Children of Men, Edge of Darkness,and in the critically acclaimed HBO mini-series John Adams.

A lesser actor would have portrayed William Stryker as a crazed maniac, a Dr. Frankenstein screaming ""Its alive!"", but not Huston. Huston plays Stryker with more reserve that manages to bring out the character's obsession more than any over the top acting could do.

There is a bigger reason why I liked Wolverine. What's that reason? I turned my brain off. Maybe not completely off, but definitely down several notches. You almost have to when you watch a superhero movie. For the most part, superhero movies are garbage. If you try and tear them to pieces, as critics like Ebert and Roper do on a regular basis and that I have briefly done, you won't enjoy them for what they are- good, mindless entertainment.

Do you have to be a comic book fan to enjoy Wolverine? No. In fact, you will enjoy the movie more if you aren't a comic book fan. You won't get bogged down with the things that will perturb your average comic book reader. Just be a fan of good action movies, turn the DVD player on, your brain off and enjoy the movie.",1283731200,2,8781,4.4706616729088635

3610425,5,B001GCUO16,"Those who have followed the X-men trilogy know that Wolverine has some mysterious history, but lacks memory of any of it. This movie explores his history, which is much deeper than anyone could have possibly expected. We know that he has experienced a process by which adamantium was bonded to his bones, but what we didn't know is that, even before he underwent those experiments, he was....different.
We meet Wolverine as a child, along with his differently-abled brother, and watch them grow up, always on the move to prevent local people from catching on.
As in the other X-men films there is something of a formula, by now well honed: bursts of action/chase/fighting separated by longer periods of story and dialog establishing the convictions of the characters. As the movie progresses, the action becomes more frequent and intense, until a huge showdown conclusion, with a brief epilog looking toward the future.
I appreciated seeing how Wolverine's character and personality were shaped by the experiences which he had undergone as he grew up, and how, strangely, his brother had shared many of those same experiences, yet chosen a different path. This seemed very insightful to me, and very reflective of true life.
X-men Origins also features a few characters from some of the other X-men films, at a younger stage in their lives, plus introduces a few new characters.

3610441,4,B001GCUO16,"Hugh Jackman is an outstanding actor and in this film, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, he demonstrates that he can command almost every scene in a full length film. The viewer never tires of watching him overcome one conflict after another. He commands empathy from the viewer and is in virtual control of the entire film from start to finish. Playing his brother, Liev Schreiber, also demonstrates his considerable skills playing a highly threatening, violent man-beast. We do learn the origin of Wolverine as young Jimmie Logan and his brother discover the gift of an animal nature within both of them and they exercise this violent side in the US Civil War, World War I and II, and the Vietnam conflict. The special effects were outstanding. The other members of the cast were totally superior, including wise cracking Ryan Reynolds and darkly beautiful Lynn Collins. The script was a bit too predictable. However, underneath all the millions of dollars of production and talent, there is a fascinating theme embodied in Wolverine, which is the struggle between the human and savage animal nature of mankind. Wolverine struggles with this duality but part of the fascination in watching Jackman is that at some level every viewer recognizes that we are all like Wolverine, constantly struggling to maintain our higher nature and control our most violent impulses. In this story, we see Jimmie Logan maintain control and seek serenity while his brother allows every violent animalistic impulse to rise to the surface and control his actions. But it is not just his brother who demonstrates a homicidal ruthless nature. Danny Huston plays a project director who will stop at nothing to control the gifts that have been given to the mutants. This is an entertaining film. It is not full of subtle nuance and is rather straight forward story-telling. Jackman and the rest of the cast make it special.",1279238400,2,1893,5.031847133757962

3610445,4,B001GCUO16,"To be fair, I'm a big fan of the Marvel films (including Spidey 3, Daredevil, Fantastic Fo...anyway). As a Marvel Film and (unofficially) the fourth X-Men film, ""Origins"" delves deep into the history of fan favorite, Wolverine, and opens the floor to ideas for similar ""Origins"" movies. Treated as its own entity or even as an extension to the film franchise, this movie was a great Summer blockbuster for 2009 and proved its worth to the Marvel library. However, for as great as the action was and how nice it was to see Wolverine's rise to become the mutant that he is, there are a few inconsistencies (I know this because I never read the comics but played the games and watched the TV shows enough that even I could spot a couple):

-Fred ""The Blob"" Dukes was never a member of Department H; he never worked alongside Wolverine. His allegiance was always to the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants

-James and Heather Hudson (the couple whom, true to form, helped Logan in the film) were not old retirees; they were mutants who worked for Alpha Flight (where Wolverine served for a time).

-Deadpool was known as the ""Merc With the Mouth"" for a reason. Yet, from the moment he becomes Deadpool, his mouth is sewn shut.

On a side note (having mentioned members of Department H), was the character of ""Bradley"" (the guy who could manipulate electronics) based off a character that Marvel had previously created (I found his character interesting and would like to know). The same question as above applies to the character played by Will. I. Am (the teleporter). It's not really important but their characters interested me and I wondered if they were based off of the comics or were just made for the movie?

I digress. These were the comics/television series. ""...Origins..."" is Hollywood's take on the lore of another of Marvel's more popular heroes.

Leading up to the events of X-Men, X-Men Origins: Wolverine tells the story of Wolverine's epically violent and romantic past, his complex relationship with Victor Creed, and the ominous Weapon X program. Two mutant brothers, Logan (Hugh Jackman) who will become Wolverine of the retractable claws and Victor (Liev Schreiber), born 200 years ago, suffer childhood trauma and have only each other to depend on. Basically, they're fighters and killers, living from war to war through U.S. history. In modern times, a U.S. colonel, Stryker (Danny Huston), recruits them and other mutants as commandos. Logan quits and becomes a logger, falling in love with a local teacher (Lynn Collins). When Logan refuses to rejoin Stryker's crew, the colonel sends the murderous Victor. Logan now wants revenge. Along the way, Wolverine encounters many mutants, both familiar and new, including surprise appearances by several legends of the X-Men universe (Ryan Reynolds, Taylor Kitsch, Dominic Monaghan, Daniel Henney, et al) whose appearances in the film series have long been anticipated.

The first half of the film is sensitive and humanistic (Ryan Reynolds manages to insert his expected spot-on one liners to keep the story light)  the second half is pure CGI tricks (though according to the featurettes Hugh Jackman performed all his own choreographic fights). Better than expected and a really fascinating cast! Grady Harp, July 17",1275350400,,2042,5.123123123123123

"" X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" provides fans with a back story showing how Logan (aka Wolverine) got his retractable adamantian claws.  This prequel to the Marvel Comics` ""X-Men"" franchise is otherwise a pretty tepid affair, lacking the sharp sociopolitical underpinnings that so distinguished the first installment in the series (the franchise has been in steady decline since that stunning opening salvo).

It's true that Logan is a bit of a tortured soul in this film - he just wants to be left alone to live his life as a lumberjack with his beautiful girlfriend by his side, but no one will let him - but it's an inner conflict without much emotional resonance or dramatic impact.  The reluctant mutant is up against not only his own brother, Victor, but Stryker, the de facto mad scientist who's kidnapping all the other mutants so he can perform diabolical experiments on them.

Hugh Jackman returns as Wolverine, while the roles of Victor and Stryker have been taken over by Liev Schreiber and Danny Houston, respectively.  The movie also features Ryan Reynolds, Taylor Kitsch (from ""Friday Night Lights""), Dominic Monaghan (from ""Lost"") and Will.i.am in relatively minor roles.

The action sequences are well-done from a technical standpoint, but they would be a great deal more compelling if we understood just how vulnerable or invulnerable each character was at any given moment in the drama (their status seems to swing wildly back and forth depending on the individual scene and circumstance).",1272153600,,1511,5.117886178861789
3610457,5,B001GCUO16,"Wow!!!  What can I say but that this installment in the X-men franchise did not disappoint!!

I did not read the comics growing up so I have no idea if they took dramatic license on wolverine's background but if the screen writer and director stuck with the comic book, it was great to know the back story of Wolverine.

I had no idea he was soooooo old!!!!

Anyway, talk about action packed!!!!  From the beginning of the film until the end, your attention is captured.  This flick had some character(s) I would have liked to have seen in the previous X-men movies.  Specifically, Gambit!  I know more than likely others would disagree but I wanted to know more about his background.

Wow, I could go on and on and on about how great this movie is so I am going to end this review by saying that I highly recommend it!!!!",1271894400,,822,4.3907284768211925

I think this ""open mind"" policy is quite important with comic book to movie adaptations. If you are not a comic follower, but you like some good action, then you'll still like this.

The story is completely inane and full of holes and gaps of logic, which would be okay if the characterization or action pieces were interesting or entertaining but those are extremely poor. The special effects look like cardboard cut outs flying around digital explosions. Most of the time CGI is used when a practical effect would have been wholly more effective, especially with Logan's claws.

As a comic book fan, they totally screw up that aspect too. Logan stands around disapprovingly when he is with his Weapons Plus team and does nothing. He has no character arc and they felt they had to give EVERYTHING he wore or did have an origin. We don't need Ma and Pa Kent to take him in and give him a leather jacket of their dead son; maybe he just likes leather jackets.
This is the kinda movie you get when a hack film maker that hates comic books as a medium and surely doesn't understand them or special effects.

Judged on its own merits its entertaining, which is pretty much what it sought.  There's decent action, and most of the characters are well cast, and how can Hugh Jackman as Wolverine be bad?  My criticism would be that the movie rests on these things rather than tries to be something better.  Sure, I know there was behind the scene issues which prevented something better, but I still feel that the movie could still have at least made some effort to cut back on the number of mutants and concentrate on Wolverine, the title character.  Like X-Men The Last Stand, I felt the movie served more as a precursor to a number of spinoffs rather than as its own entity.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but limits the movie to watchable action movie, that's entertaining, but nothing that requires repeat visits...well until the inevitable sequel/spin-off/reimaginings occur.",1264118400,,1025,4.895953757225434

  most of this movie was in the x-men trilogy.so all the answers were taken care of already.sabretooth was actualy wolverines dad.im pretty sure the xmen were the original mutant team.wolverine was dropped with one bullet in xmen 2 but absorbs hundreds in the first few minutes of this film.this dead pool guy showed up much later i thought too.
  these facts aside,the movie was pretty cool.the opening fight scenes were memorable.how old wolverine is ,is staggering.the action is cool.dead pool is awesome.there are a few lesser known mutants all through it in the later parts.

So for me that wasn't an issue.  It was good seeing them bring some stand characters in Deadpool, Agent Zero and of course Sabretooth played very good by Liev Schrieber.  Col. Stryker is his typical, mutant loving/hating self and is obviously using Wolverine to get his powers so that he can build the ultimate mutant killer.  The action is solid, intense and in your face which is just how it should be.  Wolverine is one of my favorite X-Men and this movie only serves to amplify that.

It should also be noted that Deadpool played by Ryan Reynolds is getting his own spin-off through this movie.  Gambit is played very well by Taylor Kitsch (Friday Night Lights) and hope that they decide to go more into his back story as well.  Because he has a lot also (Rogue anyone?).

Still by the time I re-watched it on DVD I realised I didn't like this movie so much. It is alot better than X-3 and generally a decent action movie, but there were some decisions that reduced the movie to just good rather than mind-blowingly awesome.

The movie just got too big, to stratospheric. I all happens when Gambit appears (well mostly, Wolverine does jump a helicopter earlier on)

gambit starts out cool, he blows wolvy through a wall with his card thing. Then all of a sudden WTF, HES CLIMBING THE WALLS WITH SPARKLY STICKS? And does some for of Dragon ball Z slam blowing up half the area.

Then he disapears for a while only to return to do some more leaping blowing up tricks. In amongst Deadpool bringing down a massive chimney its all getting to be too much. Wolverine is a close-up guts and glory character.

In this movie when hes being skimming across the water, or blending a fire-escpae (possibly the worst scene in the film) it feels like we're watching the stupid man's version of wolverine.

Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least, however, there is a very noticeable absence of attractive women that we have become accustomed to in previous X-Men films (such as Famke Janssen, Halle Berry, and Rebecca Romijn among others).
X-Men Origins: Wolverine is very well written and very well presented, and thus allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over again. The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the action, and the music are all good.

One is the review would never end and the second is, I don't really care because to me it's a prequel to the three X-Men films; not a comic book. From what I understand, fans of the comic found it to be devastatingly far from the true origin of Wolverine.

The film opens with two young boys: James and Victor, growing up in Canada with super powers. Certain events happen and the boys leave home. Then at I guess whatever age the actors are in real life, (Hugh Jackman as James and Liev Schreiber as Victor), they stop aging; for whatever reason, this is never explained. And don't tell me it's disclosed in the comics, because this is not a comic book. It may be a comic-book-movie, but it's a movie nonetheless. And in a movie certain things need to be revealed. A sequel or prequel shouldn't rely on its previous installment alone, to fill in loose holes. Any film should be able to stand on its own.

We know that they have stopped aging because as the opening credits roll, we see them fighting in several wars and we end the credit sequence at well over a hundred years from where we began. I guess they were tired of being Canadian because they eventually start fighting in American wars. Maybe they had dual citizenship?

They are both in trouble with the military until a man named Stryker (Danny Huston) asks them if they want to join a special team. They join and the team is comprised of way too many super-mutant characters to keep track of.

Next for no reason at all, Stryker starts calling James, Logan. I understand this was Wolverine's original name but it is never exposed to us why he is suddenly called Logan. The team becomes corrupt and Logan walks away. Victor isn't pleased.

We fast forward six years to learn that Victor is apparently now bad and is murdering off the members of the team. I've seen the film twice now and with the exception of sheer boredom, I can't tell you why he does this.

We learn why Logan is going to be called Wolverine and then Victor kills his girlfriend. Having nothing else to live for, Logan agrees to allow Stryker to spend ""half a billion dollars making him indestructible"" by injecting him with a special metal. Evidently, for a reason that is again not explained to us, Wolverine is the only one that can handle this painful operation. Then they get mad at each other and Stryker tries to have him killed, just minutes later. I guess the government doesn't audit this guy's allowance.

The problem with this being a prequel is that we already know from seeing the first X-Men that at some point Wolverine is going to have to lose his memory. This takes a lot of the suspense out of the film and you won't believe how lame the idea is that they use to justify his memory loss.

The thing that bothered me the most in the film was the horrible CGI (Computer Graphic Imagery). I am not generally a fan of CGI anyway. His claws looked like something out of a Looney Tunes cartoon; particularly in the scene of him checking himself out in the bathroom mirror. Last time I checked, technology has improved since the first three films, so what was the problem? The satire-filled commercials with Charles Barkley sprouting Wolverine like claws looked more realistic.

There's even a CGI shot of Wolverine driving a motorcycle by the Las Vegas sign. Did they need this shot? If they did then why didn't they just have some no-name stunt guy ride by? The camera was so far away, we wouldn't have known if it was really Jackman or not anyway.

There was also a shot of an elderly couple driving and the entire background was CGI. Why? These were two unknown actors. Why couldn't they have shot this sequence on location with any two actors? They clearly had Jackman there, running through the fields. And the elderly couple was only driving down their driveway for crying out loud; it wasn't dangerous!

Nearly all of the action sequences looked fake. Wolverine flying through the air and landing on a helicopter looked like something out of a videogame instead of one of the most highly anticipated summer blockbusters.

They even used CGI for dust in the motorcycle chase scene and when Wolverine was running through the woods with the helicopter shooting at him. Why? This is one of the most basic tricks in Hollywood, used for years; you set explosives in the ground, then you detonate them and it makes the dirt fly in the air, looking like bullets hitting the ground near the character. The exception would be the final action scene; it wasn't half bad.

One of the things in the film that I did like was Hugh Jackman's portrayal as Wolverine. He was clearly born to play this part. He takes it very seriously and does a tremendous job; as he did in the other three films. Watch him in an interview and you will see that this character could not be any farther from the real Hugh Jackman.

I also loved Liev Schreiber as the villain. He really got into character here. He is a tremendous actor and I have had my eye on him for years. He should be able to taste an Oscar because he's due one any time.

Ryan Reynolds was great as always, but only in the film for a few minutes. And at last they put Gambit (Taylor Kitsch) in an X-Men film. I'm not sure if Kitsch was the ultimate choice for the role or not but he was descent. I would have liked to have seen more scenes with him and Wolverine together; but of course they tried to cram all of these other characters into the film who were boring. This movie did not have enough of Wolverine in it.

I suspect the film was horribly written. The plot was weak and had too many holes. I don't know how they got these great actors to sign on for this film. Not to directly blame this on the writers, but I was so upset to see my favorite line from the trailer by Wolverine tarnished. It played great on the trailer but in the actual film they add a strong and un-needed swear word. I know Wolverine swears but the line was stronger without it.

I obviously wasn't very impressed with the directing of the film either. I feel like the director (Gavin Hood) didn't take this project seriously. I have no idea how he landed this job. According to [...], the only major film he had ever directed was Rendition. How does one go from directing a mediocre film like Rendition, to directing a movie as huge as this? Sadly, Rendition is probably a bit better.",1260403200,3,6717,4.4795417348608835

3610509,5,B001GCUO16,The movie X-men origins wolverine is very scary. The film was made 2009. I think that the scenes in the movie are realistic. The fighting scenes are violent and action-packed. The movie has a lot of special effects. When Wolverine gets angry knives come out of his hands. This movie has two heroes and one heroine.,1260316800,,314,4.625
3610510,2,B001GCUO16,"After multiple warnings from friends, colleagues, and random fan-boys/girls, I braved the theatre this opening weekend and hoped that the critics were wrong about how horrible X-Men Origins: Wolverine was.

  They were.

  It was even worse than I'd imagined.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  For the most part, the X-Men movie franchise has been good to us. Somehow, FOX Studios and Marvel had created a movie brand that not only appeased the old comic-book lovers of the franchise, but was also able to draw in new blood. Everybody liked X-Men. The franchise had gotten so big that prime-time television is on its third season of a hit spin-off, Heroes. They drew in so much new blood that they started releasing new comic-book spin-offs of the X-Men, and everyone and their grandmother bought them.

  Hey, I'm not complaining. I enjoyed the ride.

  Then, they got greedy. The producers decided to ""go back in time"" to explain the origins of Wolverine. It wasn't a bad idea. Out of all the X-Men, both heroes and villians, Wolverine's back-story is probably the most interesting, aside from Angel/Archangel, and even Jubilee(who's surrounding story of The Reavers is much more interesting than the character herself. Excuse me, my dorkiness is showing.)

  Unfortunately, the producers didn't feel the same way, and decided to ""Hollywood it up"" into the piece of drek in theatres today.

  I cannot blame the actors. Across the board, I had no complaints. Hugh Jackman reprises his role as Wolverine efficiently. He still has that angst-ridden animal nature working for him. Liev Schreiber recasts Victor Creed(aka Sabretooth) well, although he bounces around a little too much like ""a cat."" Ryan Reynolds surprised me with the brief time he was on-screen as Wade Wilson(before becoming Deadpool). All his lines had a bit of dry comical wit, just like the Deadpool I enjoyed reading back when I read comic books. I can't imagine anyone doing a better job. Except maybe Jason Lee(from My Name is Earl, Mallrats, etc.) I even enjoyed Dominic Monaghan's(of LOST and Lord of the Rings fame) short stint as the fearful technolith, Bolt, and Kevin Durand's Blob. Unfortunately, these latter three characters barely had any screen time. They could only do as much as the script, and a last minute rewrite, allowed them to do.

  A major problem seemed to be script and directing. The movie's intro was a huge step away from the end of the original X-Men trilogy. Instead of the dark drama, that coincided with the death of Scott Summers and the rise of the Dark Phoenix, continuing, the franchise reverted back to comic-book goofiness, where action drives the story and character development plays second fiddle. That wouldn't be so bad, except that the action is sparse, too. Having Wolverine and Sabretooth run through 4 wars is a nice idea, but looks way too forced on-screen as an intro. It is continued with a short government task force stint, a lot of walking around and lumber-jacking, until finally Wolverine receives his adamantium infusion. And the story gets worse from there, until the final fight with Deadpool himself, which is a travesty to anyone who enjoyed the ""merc with a mouth.""

  Another thing that bothered me, however small, was the depiction of Wolverine's claws. I remember the past movies having some decent looking claws coming out of Hugh Jackman's fists. For some reason, this time around they reminded me more of what they would look like in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" or ""Cool World."" This was especially prevalent in the bathroom scene. They looked way too cartoonish. I don't remember them looking that bad in the trilogy.",1260230400,,3706,5.1011608623548925
3610511,5,B001GCUO16,I received my item very quickly and it was wrapped very well so that no damage was caused.  thank you for your great customer service!,1259712000,,134,4.36
3610512,5,B001GCUO16,I think this was great.  The opening sequence is outstanding and the storyline reveals a great deal.  Well worth the time!,1259625600,,122,4.761904761904762
3610513,2,B001GCUO16,"When the studios first came up with the idea of adding digital copies to dvd's and blu ray's, you used to get a 2nd disc of bonus features, and then the digital copy of the movie.  Not long after that, the studios decided to just cram all the bonus features and such onto 1 disc, and then make the 2nd disc the digital copy.  Ok, fine, but why do all the advirtisments and box's say '2 Disc Edition + Digital Copy'.  Am I wrong, or does that imply 2 disc's PLUS digital copy???  Batman's 'The Dark Knight' blu ray say's 2 disc on the box, and that is exactly what you get, IN ADDITION to a 3rd disc, which is the digital copy.

To top it off, there was a limited 3 disc blu ray version, that just had the theatrical cut on dvd as the 3rd disc.  Personally I could care less for the digital copy, they should just offer that for download from a site, which is what I think they tried to do at first, and is what record companies are doing for music.

Anyways, decent movie.  Yeah, we all hoped for more, and wished the first and especially the 3rd X-Men movie's were better.  Looks great and sounds even better on blu ray.  And what can I say, I'm looking forward to the next installment and much rumored Magneto origins.",1259539200,,1220,4.1752136752136755
3610514,3,B001GCUO16,"The Canuck who goes ""snikt"" is back and in his own feature film, and my tepid reaction goes along the lines of ""Um.. oh.. huh."" X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE is serviceable enough, but in no way does it elevate the X-Men film franchise to new heights. There's always peril in disclosing a character's mysterious past, that the doing of it may possibly sabotage the character's existing appeal. Sometimes, things are better left alone, better left to the viewer's imaginations lest the reality not live up to all the fun speculations. In having long-withheld details from his murky past finally revealed, Wolverine ends up being less interesting. And the big, exciting reveals end up not so big, not so exciting. For a vehicle featuring a mutant berserker who's the best at what he does - which is fighting - X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE lacks punch.

Hugh Jackman isn't bad as Logan. Okay, I had to get over the fact that Logan in the comic books stands at only 5'3,"" and not 6'2,"" which is Jackman's height. Because, for me, part of Wolverine's appeal is that he's often the smallest runt in the place and still he tears  up the shizzy. Another thing is that Jackman doesn't quite convincingly demonstrate that utterly berserko rage that Logan succumbs to. So, not feral enough, vicious enough, scruffy enough, or, yeah, smelly enough. Hugh Jackman isn't bad as Logan. But he's too, I dunno, elegant? Tame?

The film begins somewhen in 1845, which is when young James Howlett's (Wolverine/Logan's real name) mutant abilities first truly kick in. We note James' popping of his retractable bone claws, the tragedy in his home, the panicked dash thru the woods, the show of togetherness by Victor Creed, James' older half-brother, and then we're off to the opening credits to catch brief glimpses of James and Victor adventuring thru various wars down the decades. Thru the years Victor (a very good Liev Shreiber) becomes increasingly bestial and amoral and you could see James growing more and more concerned about this. It was never gonna end well between the two. If you read the X-Men titles, you know this, that Wolverine and Sabertooth are the bitterest of enemies.

In telling Logan's story, the movie skips key junctures in his past, or since this is the movie version, maybe Logan simply never did venture to Madripoor or get married in Japan. During 'Nam, we do see him and Victor being handpicked by Colonel Stryker for Team X, a black ops unit peopled with hardened mutants. We witness Stryker's interest in the rare metal alloy known as adamantium, and we fans know how adamantium impacts Wolverine later on. The movie cherry picks (and sometimes throws a curve on) elements from the Wolverine mythos. We follow Logan as he encounters Silverfox and later undergoes the excruciatingly painful Weapon X experiment. The film peppers in various superhero scuffles as Wolverine and Sabertooth separately throw down with various mutants, all this culminating in a showdown on Three Mile Island. But the disappointing thing is that most of the action sequences don't get you up as they should.

I get the sense that Gambit and especially Deadpool were spotlighted with eventually having them star in their own movies in mind. Except that Taylor Kitsch underwhelms as Remy LeBeau. On the other hand, Ryan Reynolds as the mouthy merc Wade Wilson is very promising. Ryan Reynolds is at his scene-stealing best and, in one scene, as Wade Wilson furiously deflects bullets with his flashing swords, he solidifies himself as the baddest dude in a roomful of bad dudes. So I'm sold on the Deadpool movie. Actually, that whole sequence in which Team X invades a well-defended structure in Lagos, Nigeria counts as the most scintillating action sequence in the film. However, what they later do to Deadpool is just too much. I also wasn't down with the out-of-left-field reimagining of Blob. A fun thing, though, is that I once again get to play the ""Identify that Cameo"" game. Most prominent are a young Cyclops and Emma Frost. But see if you could pick out the others.

The movie gives us a momentary glimpse of Logan being happy, the operative word being ""momentary."" We see Logan suffering a tragic loss and giving in to his inner rage and losing his inhibitions. And yet, as portrayed by Hugh Jackman, when Wolverine loses it, in my eyes, he doesn't lose it enough. The PG-13 rating may also be to blame for this. Word is that a sequel is already underway. I'm crossing my fingers for an Alpha Flight sighting.

Lastly, Wade Wilson just cracks me up. Mouthy as he is, he doesn't really get a chance to mouth off. However, he does manage to get on Sabertooth's bad side when he observes that Sabertooth has the ""fingernails of a bag lady.""",1259280000,,4730,4.839307787391842
3610515,2,B001GCUO16,"He's a superhero who breaks every stereotype.  He smokes, drinks, kills without mercy and threatens even his comrades.  So it's about time that Marvel's fiercest mutant gets his own movie.  The first of the new ""Origins"" film lineup, it reveals Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) long, choatic past and the transformation that made him the badass comic fans know and love.  The film also explores his ties to William Stryker (Danny Huston) as well as his history with Victor Creed (Liev Schreiber), which never came up in the X-Men movie trilogy (just one of many plotholes).

This film starts off well enough, with Jackman in all his roughneck, adamantium glory.  Halfway through, however, director Gavin Hood shakes things up a bit.  And by 'shake up,' I mean throwing other X-Men characters like Gambit (Taylor Kitsch) and a young Scott Summers (Tim Pocock) into the mix with no regard for story continuity or logic.  And then there's Hood's version of special-needs merc Deadpool; the only thing he did right was sew his mouth shut.  And even that doesn't compare with the movie's climax, which should have done more lasting damage to Wolverine but doesn't.  So while Wolverine is still the best at what he does, Hood apparently is not.

This film is rated PG-13: Violence, Adult Language.",1259193600,,1285,4.957943925233645
3610516,4,B001GCUO16,"I am an avid comic book fan and I make no excuses for the lack of cohesive storytelling. However the fight scenes and special effects were excellent. The acting wasn't oscar calibre but it fit into the action genre the way it needed to. Wolverine was tortured by his past, Sabretooth was ruthless and menacing and Silverfox was the one who did it all for love. The others did a bang up job too. Everyone from Agent Zero to Deadpool played their parts to perfection. Bravo. The content was awesome. The character profile that actually had the character talking as thier characters, nice touch. The deleted scenes needed to be just that. The interview of Lien Wein and Stan Lee was great. It's a nice touch to see the creator of Wolvering get his just desserts.

There are incredible scenes that prove almost impossible to be shot, like that of the helicopter, but then, for some reason, high definition shows how poorly finished Wolverine's claws are in that bathroom scene.
I don't think the story is worse than X-men III's, but it's almost impossible not to miss the underlying ideas of the Singer era. There is a second part coming. Hugh Jackman is an excellent actor. Let's hope the second part is a bit more interesting than this one!",1258588800,,628,4.770642201834862
3610520,3,B001GCUO16,"OK, it was kind of dumb, and the writers should definitely be crucified until they can answer, and promise to rectify, all the story logic questions posed by other reviewers. But hey, the actors give it a game try, and it does have moments of geekness which partially counterbalance some of the flat-out X-men universe errors. Silverfox and Emma Frost sisters? Deadpool turned into a Weapon 11 and then being offed? How did Sabertooth become the slow galoot shown in X-1 and why do Wolverine's super-senses only work at the scripters' convenience? The Watchmen is the best example of a comic book adaption that didn't get too Hollywoodized. Hopefully someday we'll get an X-Men movie that doesn't prettify the characters beyond recognition to match available movie stars, rewrite the stories to suit the idiotic whims of so-called screenwriters and their puppeteers, and resist the temptation to abandon the human (or mutant) element and just have everything blow up all over the place in the end...",1258588800,,999,5.0606060606060606

Hugh Jackman does his thing with Wolverine: unstinting in his enthusiatic and passionate portrayal of this much beloved character. On the whole, I really liked it, but of course I like this sort of thing. It probably did not make as big a splash at the box office or the critics, since it is the fourth in line of this franchise.

3610541,2,B001GCUO16,"Now that we know how good big-budget movies can be that are based on comic book material... it is more than just a tad disappointing to see the filmmakers behind X-Men Origins: Wolverine still resort to such astounding bad taste and lack of ambition. This is one of those ""it's all about the money folks"" type of deals. The producers know that no matter how bad a particular product will be, there will be hordes of consumers ready and willing to give up their greenbacks to satisfy their appetite for cheap entertainment. Well, it was expensive for the filmmakers at least. [...]

Perhaps I'm being too harsh, judging this flick against The Dark Knight and Watchmen is bad form. Wolverine should be judged against the X-Men flicks, all of which are far more variable in quality than Dark Knight or Watchmen. But even against the X-Men movies, Wolverine fails handily. In the X-Men trilogy, Wolverine was strangely the main character even though he had no right to be. He is not leader of the X-Men, he is an outsider but he was always taking up most of the screentime because he's the most popular and in films full of fantastical superpowers, he was the only identifiable character for the audience.

Ok then, audiences want the focus on Wolverine, give them a spin-off. So in this Wolverine origin movie we should rightfully get the spotlight almost exclusively on Logan and instead much screentime is wasted parading a whole gaggle of extras when it should just have Sabretooth as the main villain and that's it. We don't need an extra dozen characters! Perhaps the most offensive character in the film was this movie version of Deadpool which had almost nothing to do with the real Deadpool. When I was a kid, Deadpool was my favorite Marvel character, well him and Wolverine that is. Hearing that Deadpool would make a big appearance in this film I looked forward to it all the while knowing that Hollywood would screw it up big time and screw up they have! Casting Ryan Reynolds was mistake number one but fine, give the actor a chance. But why does Deadpool look like some reject version of Baraka from the Mortal Kombat videogame series when Deadpool in the comic has one of the sharpest, flashiest designs in the Marvel universe?

The insipid blandness of this whole movie just irks me. The chase scenes and action were all second-rate. The helicopter attack with the blades was one of the few genuine fun moments of the movie. The climactic battle scene on Three Mile Island was a case of we've seen this a million times before. The movie was still a blockbuster, made plenty of money but not enough I think to warrant another Wolverine film. Time to retire this franchise. I'm still up for a standalone Deadpool movie, provided that it has nothing to do with this travesty.",1256774400,8,2785,4.702868852459017
3610542,5,B001GCUO16,"It's not just that this movie is more filled with eye-popping effects and thrilling action sequences than the trilogy, though that's true. Rather, it's that there's a whole story here. Wolverine starts fast, and springboards from the long-running Marvel Comics series in breath-taking ways. It's a multi-faceted tale with an emotional richness seldom associated with the phrase ""summer movie."" For good reason, we equate summer movies with empty, flash-bang exercises in computer-generated imagery and mindless action.  But the writers here are as interested in the subtext as they are in the high quality action. There's no denying that  mutant super-powers drive this film. This is what state-of-the-art special effects look like: the live-action version of the way comic books appear in your mind. That would be irrelevant, however, without a good story. The movie delivers enough story and skillfully weaves together character, plot and action. This movie and the action is just plain spectacular.

One of the great things about this film is that virtually no screen time is spent on background character development. Like with last year's Incredible Hulk, the opening credits serve as a cool update and feeder for a basic origin. Even the newer characters that are introduced get very little time devoted to their past and it all works quite well. People in general are smart and can read between the lines, thus negating the necessity for cumbersome background information. Apparently the director figured this out and doesn't ""talk down""  to his audience even though it's an action film. The pace flows smoothly, with hardly a stutter along the way to break up the story or the action. That's the key. As good as X2 was, Wolverine simply has better action without sacrificing the heart or character development or the emotion that made this franchise the juggernaut that it has turned out to be.

This movie stands on its own, as its own Wolverine.  People who've never seen any of the other movies can go and see it and enjoy it.

""Deadpool"" aka Baraka was wrong on virtually every level for the character. Now don't get me wrong, Ryan Reynolds did a
FANTASTIC job when he was just plain old Wade. Fantastic to the point that I was really looking forward to the Deadpool
movie, right up till they turned him into Baraka from Mortal Kombat... with laser eyes... and teleportation...

Yeah. That part really sucks. But that's like the last 15 mins of the movie. Up till then, it's filled with performances
that range from decent to pure win (did I mention how spot-on Ryan Reynolds was as pre-Deadpool Wade Wilson? Yeah, he's
just that good to need mentioning again...)

Now x-men/wolverine ""purists"" aren't going to like this movie any more than they did the last ones. They do change things,
some of them for no readily discernable reason. So to those people, I say rent/PPV it.

Wolverine & Deadpool (comic version) fans definately need to buy it though. Hugh Jackman literally becomes Wolvie for the movie,

3610551,2,B001GCUO16,"Cheesy action movie without that much great action. Compound that with the fact that there's barely any respect for the source material, add in the fact that they don't even care too much for sensible continuity to the other films that have been made and you get a pretty awful film. Except commerically speaking, since it does satisfy giving Wolverine his own vehicle and showcasing all the fun things he can do, and throwing in a few mutants who couldn't get crowbarred into the other film series.

Even looking at the film on its own, ignoring any source material or other films whose canon or continuity it mutilates or just completely overlooks and ignores, it doesn't hold up. Put on it's own, it needs to be seen as an action movie, and the action was boring and stereotypical. If this movie was made in 1999 the sequences might have wowed me. Too bad that was ten years ago and this movie wasn't made then. What could have been the best sequence with Wolverine on a motorcycle being chased down by two hummers and a helicopter was ruined by a bleached-out looking cgi that screamed fake and the fact that it wasn't choreographed very excitingly.

There were some moments I liked, notably Liev Schrieber in general since he's a great actor who really shines in this one. I wasn't feeling the ferocity from Hugh Jackman, although maybe he lost some of his bite trying to trudge through the script without feeling he was losing some kind of integrity as an actor.

In general, I've seen Jean Claude Van Damme movies that made more sense, had more emotion, and were less cheesy than them. So I'm going to go back to them and Hong Kong for my cheap action fixes and pretend this didn't happen.",1256342400,,1696,4.590759075907591

3610553,4,B001GCUO16,"Over the course of the ""X-Men"" trilogy there has been one constant story thread that has been touched upon, yet it's never been fully explored. For those of you that have watched the series, then you most likely know exactly what I'm referring to... the origin of the most popular mutant of all, Logan/Wolverine. Finally, after three highly successful films chronicling the adventures of the X-Men team, 20th Century Fox has chosen to spin-off Wolverine into his own movie and potential franchise by providing his official origin story with ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"".

""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" presents many key events in Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) life prior to his fateful arrival at the X-Mansion in the original ""X-Men"" film. Beginning with his initial discovery as a youth that he possessed the ability to unsheathe claws from beneath his skin, to his complicated friendship and eventual hatred of his former best friend Victor Creed (Liev Schreiber), his time spent working for the government as part of an elite team of mutant trackers, and all of this culminating in a senses-shattering showdown that will leave no one unscathed.

The mystery behind Wolverine's origin has been a long-standing plotline, not just in the film trilogy, but in the various comic books in which the character has appeared. In 2001, Marvel Comics began a six-issue limited series aptly titled ""Origin"" that would establish the official backstory for the berserker mutant once and for all. Obviously, so long as interest in the onscreen version of the character remained alive, it would only be a matter of time before his origin, or at least some semblance of it, made it to the big screen as well.

Many times with spin-offs, the story tends to be weaker than those utilized for the main franchise; however, this film appears to be one of those very rare exceptions where the quality actually remains intact. Written by David Benioff (""Troy"") and Skip Woods (""Swordfish""), with some elements loosely based upon the mini-series ""Origin"", the story focuses upon some of the various influences, circumstances, and powerful outside forces that shaped Logan into becoming one of the most dangerous mutants on the face of the Earth.

The story spends ample time showcasing the extremely visceral nature of the film's two primary characters, Wolverine and Sabretooth, and how they deal with their inner beasts in drastically different ways. Along with this complicated relationship, the film delves into the almost constant, yet subtle, manipulation that eventually led to Logan's decision to participate in the excruciatingly painful Weapon X program, which bonded liquid Adamantium to his bones. It's during these moments of manipulation, mostly at the hands of William Stryker (Danny Huston), that the film's story really shines.

Another strong aspect of the film is the sharply written, and often times witty, dialogue. The interactions between the characters felt believable and completely natural within the scenes. Some spin-offs suffer from an over-abundance of clichs or merely recycled lines and moments from the original franchise on which they are based; however, ""Wolverine"" easily side-steps these issues in every respect. In the hands of less capable writers that didn't feel some responsibility to keep the quality of the franchise intact, the dialogue, and the rest of the story for that matter, could have potentially gone the way of so many other spin-offs and failed miserably, thus hurting the main franchise in the process. As a fan of the series, I am very pleased by the fact that even though this is the fourth film in the franchise, the creative minds behind the series continually try to surpass what has come before.

For all you action fans out there do not worry. This series hasn't lost sight of one of its key elements. Throughout the film's story the action scenes never take a backseat to the drama unfolding within the characters' lives. The fights are much more violent and at times graphic in comparison to the previous three films of the ""X-Men"" franchise; not to mention, even more up close and personal due to fewer mutants with projectile-like abilities. The decision to make the fights even more brutal worked very well alongside the animalistic overtones of the story; although it may have resulted in some parents not wishing their children to see the film, despite the fact that they may have seen the other three in the series.

Of course, what would a comic book movie be without the use of visual effects? Well, obviously it would be quite boring, but that almost goes without saying. For the most part, the CGI-intensive sequences were well executed; however, there were some surprising scenes in which the effects looked a bit shoddy. Oddly, enough these scenes involved the use of Wolverine's claws, which by this point should have been mastered and no longer a cause for concern. I'm not sure what caused the problem, if it was a lack of texture on the CGI claws or what, but something was definitely off about them during a couple of scenes. Please note, that these are not pivotal scenes and that the problem was not all that detrimental to the end result of the movie, it's just something that I found frustrating and thought honestly shouldn't have occurred within the film. Otherwise, like I said, the visual effects were very good, and at times numerous sequences were truly awesome to watch and easily overshadowed any of the weaker moments in this area.

Lastly, the acting for the film, just as it was in the original three movies, remains consistently high throughout. Despite having played the role of Wolverine three times already, Hugh Jackman is still able to bring a fresh new approach to the character that is crucial to the continued success of the series. No doubt the ability for Jackman to convey such enthusiasm for the role was assisted by the fact that he was so passionate about finally getting to tell the official origin for this beloved comic book icon. Another neat aspect of the character that was explored a little further in this film than in the previous movies was Wolverine's famed ""Berserker Rage"" (comic book fans know what I'm talking about). Although, we don't necessarily get to see an all-out fully realized rage, we are given a much closer look at what he would be like if he succumbed to his unbridled fury, and it was obvious that Hugh enjoyed this new side to the character being explored.

Supporting Hugh are some extremely talented actors beginning with Liev Schreiber (""The Sum of All Fears""). Liev takes a role that was relatively wordless in the original film, and was tasked with creating a character that was dramatically rich, incredibly feral, and ultimately could become the nemesis to Wolverine we saw in the first movie. Not necessarily an easy job, but Liev pulled it off perfectly. He delivered a multi-layered villain that was a prime example of what Wolverine could have become if given a couple of different choices along the way, and Liev is clearly relishing every evil moment he gets onscreen. Next is actor Danny Huston (""30 Days of Night"") taking over the role of William Stryker from Brian Cox (""X2: X-Men United""). Danny played Stryker with the perfect blend of subtle manipulation and malice. At times he would be fatherly, especially towards Logan (albeit only to further his own agenda), but then he would snap and show his true colors by unveiling an obviously twisted, sadistic, and potentially unstable man who wanted nothing more than unlimited power to quell the surging mutant problem.

Rounding out the supporting cast is actor Ryan Reynolds (""The Proposal"") and singer turned actor Will.i.am (""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa""). I've become a fan of Ryan's work over the last few years, and I enjoy his unfettered sarcasm that he seems to imbue into almost every single character he portrays, but never in a way that feels unnatural or tired within in the role, mind you. In this film, Ryan isn't given all that much screen time, but what he does get he definitely makes the most of by making his character of Wade Wilson (comic book fans know him as the Merc with the Mouth, Deadpool) an enjoyable addition to the group of rogues that Stryker has assembled. Sadly, his role was intended as an introduction to the character in hopes of getting an eventual spin-off for him as well, a tactic that most likely worked given the film's success; however, I for one wish there could have been a little more of the character in this story, not to mention fewer major tweaks to the character's origin that don't line-up with the comic books. But, I digress. Last, but not least, is Will.i.am as John Wraith, a mutant teleporter. Will shows that he definitely has potential, displaying some good comedic timing in a few scenes, and a natural charisma that makes for a more interesting character than I believe he would have been if played by another actor.

Directed by Gavin Hood (""Rendition""), ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" is an incredibly fast-paced action film that delivers on all counts. Granted there are some gripes with the movie, but overall it's a very solid addition to a terrific franchise. This is a must-see for fans of the original trilogy and a perfect jumping on point for newcomers to the series.

3610555,5,B001GCUO16,"Whether you loved it or hated it, I think most people can agree that Hugh Jackman is perfect for the role of Wolverine.  His performances have satisfied the Wolverine lover in me since X-Men 1.  Many people have complained about this film, but I find little to complain about.  For me, it was entertaining throughout.  You do have to suspend disbelief a lot, but that is the nature of comic book superhero films.  They have spectacular powers, and display them often.  It is really fun to watch.  I'm glad they got to include Gambit in this movie, who wasn't present in the X-Men Trilogy.  I think he's a really cool character.

And of course, there's Logan, A.K.A. Wolverine.  I liked that you got to see him as a boy with bone claws.  After all, it is an origin film.  Without giving away the story, I can say that if you were wondering how he goes from bone claw kid to adamantium-laced superhero, this movie covers that.

Now before i begin i will explain that i am a huge xmen fan so im going to give you a fans point of view.

Story

Started off good then failed soo horribly at the end.  I won't get into details and ruin it for people.  Beginning was well done during the credits.  Explained wolverines roots. Got into how he was changed into wolverine etc.  And then it fell on its face faster than than a todler learning to walk.

Visual

The movie is pretty i can say that but hey its a story were looking for so you can give me all the explosions and destruction you want but it has to have something to keep me watching.

Characters

Well wolverine same. Sabertooth was nice. And then that was it.  They threw in random characters showed them for a few mins and then they died or escaped and you didn't see them really in action.  Always thought.... why show people for 2 seconds and waste money on cgi if they don't have a roll anyway.  Stop trying to add bonus points.  Didnt need to see a young group of xmen do nothing but run for their lives.

Overall this movie was a fail.  It was a fail cascade that went down and went down in a way that compares to x3 last stand. I get what they were trying to do but it was executed poorly, had bad writing, had too many terrible mutants added in for noo reason at all, and was in general a bad movie.

3610561,3,B001GCUO16,"You know, Wolverine really impressed me within the first hour of the film.  They didn't try to cram too much in and overaction the film.  The weren't making the same mistake they did X3.  We got to see a lot of characterization, which is my favorite quality of superhero films.  I want to see the story and the journey, don't just blow up stuff and throw in riduculous fight scenes to sell movie tickets.  I want reality within the surreal.  The first half of the film really did justice to some of my favorite comic characters.  And the new non-comic book characters (John Wraith and the electric mutant) complimented the film just fine.  Everyones performance in the beginning of the film was fine by my standards.

Then something went wrong in the second half.  They tried to put in a bike chase scene, but it ended up being way over the top.  I think everyones a little tired of seeing action heroes walk out of a flaming ball of fire.  The action in general isn't smooth and they didn't pay enough for better CG.  If you rewind before the chase scene we see a bathroom scene where Logan comes to terms with his blades.  This scene takes the cake as the most useless scene in the movie, because the whole time the audience is distracted by just how badly they animated his blades.  They look opaque for christ's sake.

So going on we finally end up at Strker's island.  This whole last part of the movie does not sit well with me.  Wolverine learns the truth and then wants to cry and walk away instead of killing stryker.  I'm not saying he should kill stryker, but WHAT WOULD WOLVERINE REALLY DO?  So he walks off and cries and then hears a scream and comes back.  How many times have I seen someone get upset and run away and then come back right before someone dies to save the day? Anyway, by the end we've totally ruined deadpool, and yes I know I can't beg Fox to keep everything the way it is in the comics, but guess what?  Even the producer of this film and all the X-men films says  I regret what happened to Deadpool, I want an entire reboot, I hope we can do that.  You made a beloved killer an indestructable villain, who definately can't make another appearance the way he is right now.  They would have to erase everything they've done to make a Deadpool movie now.  Ok, enough about the film.

SPECIAL FEATURES: I think we were sold a little short.  We get a few short clips and about 6 commentaries/picture in picture tracks that play throughout the whole feature film.  Please, I think everyone would rather have more behind-the-scenes segments and less commentaries.  I like both but I don't want to watch the film 6 times to get my moneys worth.  More lengthy behind the scenes, and less ""Fun Facts while your movie plays"".  Trust me close to no one watched the X-facts or the Previsualizing tracks that play througout the movie.  It's just cheap special features.  The first three films have great special features on their blu-rays.  I don't see how this can be so difficult.

So all in all, Wolverine isn't bad, but it definately has it's flaws.  It was more of a dissapointment, but it was definately better than X3.

The special effects, action sequences, plot is alright, But I expected to have more action in the movie.

Anyway no harm. I enjoyed the movie at my appartment in my 5.1 JVC home theatre system.

One thing Stan Lee is the man for comics. there is not other person for mavel comics like Wolverine.

My recommendation for other all around the world. 'Watch the movie, you will enjoy it everyday"".

3610567,4,B001GCUO16,"First off, I'm not what you'd call a fanboy. If you think that invalidates my opinion of this film and that's going to put you off reading this review, then so long and happy trails, pilgrim.

That said, I know of ""The X Men"" - read some of the comics as a kid, can identify the characters and had soaked up some vague knowledge of ""Wolverine's"" origins from somewhere. I saw the first ""X Men"" film at the cinema (yawned and winced my way through it), saw the second one on DVD (yawned and winced my way through that as well) and unintentionally saw the third one on TV over the weekend (and actually quite enjoyed it, the change of director, the increasing moral ambiguity and the increased level of peril to the muties made for a much more enjoyable experience).

I initially had no desire to see ""Wolverine"", but the change in tone of the third film made me think that there might be something in it. So I rented it.

My Two Cents?

Its good stuff. Let me qualify that. Its good stuff if you're in the mood for a big, dumb, CGI filled Hollywood blockbuster (which was actually filmed in NSW - go skips!) in which lots of things blow up. The fact that it's an origin tale also helped as I'm a sucker for a good origin story.

Hugh Jackman, by his own admission, wanted to take this one to darker places and he does so with aplomb. He also has the perfect foil in Liev Schrieber's ""Sabretooth"", who turns out to be the catalyst that ultimately sends him down the road to becoming the man with the cuisinart claws. It has some nice twists in it and some great cameos by other mutants that I vaguely remembered from sunny afternoons spent reading Marvel comics in the back-garden as a child. There's also a deeply amusing riff on the nature of what really happened at ""Three Mile Island"".

That said, I did wince twice (did we really need the glib shot of Wolfboy walking away stone-faced from an exploding helicopter or the obligatory crane shot of him looking up to the sky and yelling ""NOOOOOOOOOO!!!"" at the heavens? I mean, come on - those were already bad cliches when both the universe AND Dick Clark were young)

Will you enjoy it?

Well, take the following as a litmus test.

3610580,4,B001GCUO16,"""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" was a great movie.  I am not one to usually review movies, as I'm more of a book buff, but it was so good that I had to comment.

Taking my love of the X-Men comic books series aside, the movie was fantastic.  There was a ton of action, many open endings (which can be taken both ways, see below), and so much action was covered.  I loved the CGI, though at times it was obvious.  His claws were a bit too cartoon-y, and even in the scene of his first lumberjack job, the bulk machines were obviously not really there.  Also, in the scene with Gambit in the alley, obviously CGI- but I don't really expect the guy to climb the walls in real life.

Loved the scenes with Hugh Jackman during Stryker's experiment, but thought the director was trying a little too hard to make Wolverine a love-struck sissy boy.  I mean, Logan is like Bruce Wayne in Batman.  He's hardcore, strong, and revenge-driven.  Maybe Batman vs. Wolverine isn't the best description, but... hey, I hope you get my point.  Maybe I don't remember the comics as well as I believe I do, but I thought the whole Wolverine vs. Sabertooth was due to the dad killings, not the girl.

I don't remember many of the characters they brought up, like Wolverine's girl- I don't remember her in the comics, but maybe she came up in a later edition that I just haven't read yet?  I was thankful that they showed that Wolverine volunteered for Stryker's experiment, as it is true to the comics.

I wish they made the movie longer because it's hard to keep everything straight with years in between while we're waiting on the movie productions.  The Blob I would have loved more story on.  As well as Gambit.  Even Omega Red (? Didn't name him ?) (Weapon XI) would have benefited from a little more of a story. I was disappointed to see it ended just as the next movies began, but I guess that's expected.  I wanted more of Cyclops as well.

Liev Schreiber did a great job of protraying Sabertooth.  Though he was not the same actor who cameo-ed Sabertooth in X-Men I (or was it X II?), I will accept him as the future Sabertooth.

The movie seemed short, they overused Wolverine's CGI claws a little too much at the beginning, but... overall I was impressed with the story, the acting, and the true-to-the-books plot.

I can't wait for the next origins (I've heard it's Storm next?) and I want more more more of Wolverine's story.  He is my favorite character in the comics.  I think this is one of the movies that Jackman can get right when it comes to his acting skills.  His portrayal of Wolverine (throughout all of the XMen movies) has been stellar, even if it is a bit sappy.",1255392000,18,2662,4.42798353909465

3610586,5,B001GCUO16,"And that ""Bryan Singers"" vision just wasn't that great.
At first, the idea of a spin-off origin story of Wolverine sounded stupid. Why did we need to hear more about Wolverine then we did in X2. Wasn't killing Stryker and learning of those origins enough?
No, it definitely wasn't. There was much to learn about Wolverine's very long past, and I say long because somehow they get a hell of a lot of material done in a 1 hour and 47 minutes. From the awesome credits scenes with him and Sabertooth (needed an origin story as well)in various wars, it becomes obvious that a great movie has been made.
From the introduction of Deadpool (gets the coolest scenes in the movie) the death of a love of Wolverine's, to his involvement in the ""Weapon X"" program, the movie moves from one to thing to another very smoothly.
From great action scenes (Wolverine being shot at on a motorcyle after being admanatium is in him being the best) and some really sad moments when various characters are killed, I completly forgot why I ever cared about ""Bryan's Singer"" ovveratted vision.
I would rate this either the best or 2nd best X-Men movie, only possibly 2nd to X3. I know what most people of think of X3, so an explanation is needed for this belief.
X-Men was a good movie, but it was obvious that the budget wasn't high enough and just didn't allow for enough explosive action in a franchise that is half about the awesome powers in fight scenes. X-Men 2 got that budget and while having a great story wasted money on a dragged on ending scene (breaking facility=boring) and a lack of anything for Colossus to do. X-Men: The Last Stand (X3) was not dragged on in any way, and while it did insert way too many characters (wasted Colossus and side characters as well), gave Storm more screen time (give her a spin-off for god sakes) and fufilled a excellent storyline involving the pheonix.
Yes, Deadpool was a little off in Wolverine. But it was meant to be his origin story as well, wasn't it? Yes. I imagine his spin-off will show us the true Deadpool. And yes Gambit was randomly inserted to please no one. But other characters like Silver Fox, The Blob, and the guy Will. I.AM played (forgot his name) were handled perfectly, which is less than I say for the limited screen time of Storm in any X-Men movie.
The next time around, I would like to see no random characters that sacrifice story being inserted. But the action must be kept up and the story must as well. If this is done, the next X-Men movie, whether it be Deadpool, X-Men; First Class, Magneto, or Wolverine 2, could easily be the best.

Oh, and if X4 is ever made, I want to see Angel as a main character doing a lot of flying around, Roque realizing her true powers, Professor X-s new body, and Apocalypse causing humans and mutants to team up to fight him.",1255132800,2,2816,4.489278752436647
3610587,5,B001GCUO16,"Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot.
It's always been my opinion that you can really tell the quality of a movie just by the previews. Awful theatrical trailers that make you look at your friends like, ""Seriously?"" generally indicate a bad movie ahead. This movie was preceded by trailers for movies like Transformers, Night at the Museum, and Ice Age. The whole audience was revved up just by the previews.

The movie had me from the start... it had a brilliant intro. Who knew Wolverine was so interesting?! It starts with Wolverine and Sabertooth as kids, Jimmy and Victor (respectively). After an incident with their fathers, and discovering they're brothers, they run off and stick together throughout all sorts of amazing experiences. Surviving numerous wars, they are eventually recruited by Col. William Stryker, who has put together an elite team of mutants. Wolverine ends up deciding he'd rather have a life of peace and finds himself a woman. Things start getting nasty when Sabertooth and Stryker team up to gather mutants' abilities in an effort to create a super weapon.

I thought it was awesome how they brought in so many characters to tell the story of Logan as he became Wolverine... We see early Scott (Cyclops), Young Prof. Xavier, etc. As soon as Scott heard ""Go Left"" I knew Xavier was close! The new characters were great too! Gambit was downright intense, and Deadpool was amazing with a sword (I couldn't even recognize Ryan Reynolds at the end of the movie).

That movie was an intense, action packed movie! I will most definitely buy it the day it hits DVD. It's one of the few movies in a long time that I feel has been worth the $10 to see in movie theatres. The only problem I have with the whole series now is that I loved Liev Schrieber as Sabertooth. I now have trouble watching X-1 because they have that furry growling guy as Sabertooth, and not smart-mouthed Victor who relished picking on his little brother.",1255132800,2,1984,4.778425655976676

This one unfortunately isn't at par with many of the other high quality franchises being produced including the previous X-Men, Iron Man, Spiderman, and recent Batman movies.  The story is a bit contrived - but I can get over that.  It's based on a comic book after all.  What is unforgivable is the poor quality of the CGI effects.  Green screen shots were extremely obvious, where lighting looked off making everyone appear artificial against the backgrounds.  Some of the background shots seemed almost cartoonish.  Makeup effects weren't great.  And worst of all Logan's claws even looked bad, where it seemed the effects animators had a difficult time keeping the claw appearance against the skin on his hands difficult.

I happened to see the ""pre-release"" version earlier this year that was floating around the Internet and had the studios in a tizzie.  I think now having seen both the pre-release and production versions that those studio execs were worried because the pre-release version and final cut are actually much closer in finish and polish than they wanted anyone to think.

3610593,4,B001GCUO16,"Ok, maybe I am a kid at heart, or maybe this movie wasn't as bad as I expected, but I really enjoyed ""Wolverine"". I thought that the story was easy to follow, well written, and full of surprises. For example, I had no idea (because I didn't read the comics and only saw some of the cartoons and the X-Men movies) that Wolverine was Sabertooth's brother (and I am not even sure that this was in the original storyline of Wolverine). I loved that twist and others in the story. And while I wouldn't say that the movie was exactly fast moving and action packed (don't get me wrong, there are some great fight scenes) ...I thought Origins did a wonderful job setting the stage for later X-Men stories. And I now understand why Wolverine has very few memories of his life pre-metal claws. We also got to see several of the characters from later stories (Gambit, Professor X, etc.) and understand how some mutants became X-Men!

Hugh Jackman was great as Wolverine, and I liked Sabertooth's character as well. Understanding the Wolverine/Sabertooth dynamic is key I think, to later stories or even potential storylines.

Now a brief synopsis of the movie.....As a young boy Wolverine discovers that everything in his life is not as it seems, and finding out that he has a brother is the least of his worries. For spending years fighting beside his brother has not prepared him for a future of tracking down mutants for his boss, a military man trying to cure his son (who has mutant powers), and eliminating them because they are threats. When Wolverine decides that killing and fighting isn't necessarily fun anymore, and maybe the person they are working for isn't what he appears, he leaves the organization and settles down as a lumberjack. The rest is a story that only you can appreciate if you watch it. Understanding the motives for people's actions is not always as clear cut as you would think, in this movie. There are tales of jealousy, greed, and power woven throughout. Anyway,
X-Men Origins, had tons of great characters (interesting mutants with interesting powers) and a sweet love story to boot. I don't see why people are being so hard on this movie because it really wasn't that bad, or maybe it is because I was expecting a lot worse.",1254873600,4,2249,4.6767676767676765

Avoid at all costs, true believers.",1254268800,9,346,5.528301886792453
3610602,4,B001GCUO16,"Comic book fans are in Heaven right now. Movies are being made left and right based on comic books. Recent releases like WHITEOUT and SURROGATES are both based on comics. And while they're a few years back, the X-MEN movies were always hits. So it's no surprise that the most popular character of the comics and films would get his own solo flick.

X-MEN ORIGINS:WOLVERINE begins in 1845 when young James Howlett kills a man for killing his father, only to discover that the man he's killed is actually his biological dad. On the run with his half-brother Victor Creed, the pair bound through history, both mutants with the ability to self heal and age slowly. Their killing abilities are utilized in all wars, but it is Victor who seems to enjoy it while James merely sticks with his brother.

Fast forward to the Vietnam War with Victor (Liv Schreiber) and James (Hugh Jackman) facing a firing squad only to survive. In prison, they are recruited by General Stryker (Danny Huston) for a unique squad that will covertly take care of problems for the U.S. Composed of various other mutants, the team often rustles each other's feathers, but do the wet work their job requires of them. The killing begins to get to James, now known as Logan, and he quits the team.

The scene changes to several years later and Logan is now living happily in Canada as a lumberjack with a woman he loves, Kayla (Lynn Collins). Stryker arrives to tell Logan that someone is killing the ex-members of the team and to be careful. The warning is too late and we are there to see Victor meet up with Kayla. When Logan finds her body, he tracks down Stryker to be a part of his secret project, Weapon X, in an attempt to turn Logan into an indestructible killer. When asked what his dog tags should read, he says Wolverine, a reference to a story Kayla had told him.

The procedure nearly kills Wolverine as the scientists inject molten adamantium, the strongest metal known to man, to his skeletal system. Where he once had bones, he now has adamantium. And where skeletal claws once popped from his fists, now shining blades appear. As the process is completed, Wolverine overhears the group planning on killing him. In a rage, he leaps from the lab's tank and takes out anyone in his way, escaping to a nearby farm.

But the welcome an elderly couple there provides is short lived as Stryker's assassins kill them both and try to get Wolverine. Once more in a rage, Wolverine takes out the team. But before Agent Zero (Daniel Henney) dies, he lets Wolverine know that Stryker has been behind it all.

Wolverine seeks out the rest of the team to find out where Stryker has gone to ground. With the help of two he is sent to New Orleans to meet a mutant named Gambit (Taylor Kitsch), the only mutant to escape from ""the island"", a secret location of Stryker's where he is experimenting on mutants, like Scott Summers and Emma Frost (two main characters from the comics). Out for blood, Wolverine convinces Gambit to take him there and attempts to put an end to Stryker's experiments and Victor for killing the woman he loved.

The film is action packed from beginning to end. The scenes and set ups bring to mind numerous images from comics past as well as characters that have become legends at Marvel comics. One is even on fast track to have his own film, Deadpool played by Ryan Reynolds. He becomes a major force in the film, though to reveal why would ruin the surprise.

The effects are amazing here. Any and every possible effect is used for maximum advantage and it shows. Streets blow up, buildings come down a brick at a time and powers shoot from eyes and playing cards. Not to mention the adamantium claws fans are so familiar with.

The acting is better than most would think, with Jackman now comfortable in the lead role. But Schreiber as Victor Creed is amazing. His feline like qualities from his stance to his bloodlust comes off as realistic. And Reynolds as the smart aleck Deadpool deserves his own film.

The first time I saw this film I left unimpressed. I think perhaps I was too stoked by the hype surrounding it. This time I got to enjoy it for the sake of the film itself. I wasn't disappointed. You don't have to see the other films to enjoy this one. As a matter of fact, it actually would be better to watch this then the rest. Any way you look at it, you can expect to find plenty of action, plenty of story, and plenty of thrills that will entertain from opening to closing credits.",1254182400,2,4492,4.534567901234568
3610603,2,B001GCUO16,"Yeah, about ""X-men Origins: Wolverine,"" I liked the characters,... in the comic books.  I am an artist, and I truly appreciate when someone uses their imagination to the fullest extent possible, so in that sense, good movie. If you are collecting X-Films, add it. Otherwise, rent first.  There is plenty of action in it.  The actors did a fine job.  Liev Schrieber is always cool, and Hugh Jackman is dynamite as an actor (My opinion: He seems a bit too ""broadway"" for this role, although he most likely is the best choice for the role)...

However, I don't appreciate when someone tries to fix something that is not broken. All that time and money put into writing a script for arguably the most popular comic book character, and you change his origin?  I'm sorry, I don't understand.  You know what I say, ""It's been already done, why do it again?""  Barry Windsor Smith, Paul Jenkins, Joe Quesada, and all of the collective minds that gave Wolverine his background in the comics, which just so happens to be the background that made him so popular, did a fantastic job.  Why switch it up?

When I say ""switch it up,"" I mean shuffle very fundamental details.
Let's say they were planning to release movies based on your favorite childhood superheroes... Only thing is, some of them were slightly different that what you would've imagined...
Like what if Superman wasn't really bulletproof?
What if Batman's parents actually died in a car accident along with Alfred?
What if Spiderman actually looked like a big hairy spider?
What if the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles weren't even ninjas?
What if the Flash was a woman?
These aren't necessarily major changes, but why would they even be necessary?  And if not readily explained within the story, then you've got lovely plot holes throughout the movie.

For example:
1. Where did he get his name Logan?
2. If Creed is his brother, why don't they share the same name? (This was explained in comics, but not in film.)
3. Adamantium bullets erase his memory?... I won't even touch that one
4. Gambit was pointless in this film. The least important character, along with Blob, and the Emma Frost clone... pointless...
5. Deadpool, although a great character, was ruined. (swords out of his hands? cmon)
6. Wolverine ran out of the base fully competent, but in a flashback in X2, he was covered in blood, and incoherent... How?
7. I guess he was never part of Department H, or Alpha Flight, or in Japan with Ogun, or Shingen, toss that out the door... (This could've became another movie all in itself, but now it'll never happen.
8. He learned how to fight from gettn almost killed and surviving his entire life? Is that it? Okay...
9. Rose, the redhead from his childhood, and the reason why he can't get enough of Jean Grey, was never there
10. Why introduce soooo many cool characters, without doing them the justice of some backgroud? It made the film a bit ""busy""

Things like these are what demolished the previous 3 X movies...
""Batman Begins,"" based on the ""Batman: Year One"" comic
""Hellboy"" very similar to the comic
""Watchmen"" flawless, except for the excessive nudity. Right out of the pages of the comic book. (graphic novel)
""Road to Perdition"" one of my favorite movies, a graphic novel...
It seems like the closer they stick to the original comic book script, it seems to always make a great movie.

I will say that in the vain of all the other X movies, it measured up.  But nobody is perfect.",1254182400,,3453,4.684297520661157
3610604,5,B001GCUO16,"Lots of hating on this film but I really enjoyed it. Yes, it deviates from the comic books, but I think it is a descent alternate universe-type storyline. Yes, it has unrealistic fight scenes, but come on! It's a comic book superhero. It's all fantasy. And, yes, Wolverine's claws special effects were poor, but...well, I guess there isn't any real excuse for that nowadays. But Sabertooth's claws were well done. The casting was great. I like Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and I especially like that he actually seems to enjoy playing the character and cares about how Wolverine is presented (see the bonus features). Leiv Schreiber is great at Sabertooth. Good match opposite Hugh Jackman and I like the way he runs like a cat when charging. Gambit was also cool and I think he should be the next breakout character. Nice portrayal of Gambit's powers and fighting skills. I wouldn't mind if Deadpool stayed dead, but we know that won't happen, based on the scene at the end of the credits. But best of all, there was finally some well choreographed and excting fight scenes that took advantage of modern technology and special effects....something seriously lacking in the other X-men movies. I hope they make a few more of these. Get the movie, it's a lot of fun. (Just don't take it too seriously.)",1254182400,3,1298,4.773333333333333
3610605,5,B001GCUO16,"Dare I say, better than the original 3 movies of X-Men?  At least for me it is as good, if not more interesting.  The only thing I felt was that some of the ""Effects"" were a little cheaply done by today's standards.  Such as his claws once he gets them replaced with adamantium.  They were to shiny and to make it more realistic, they could've had more reflection in them.  They were too perfect.

The story was very good.  Telling the origins of how he grew up as a mutant and well I won't spoil much, but how him and Beast were both involved in each other's lives.  Very cool.  So in reality, we saw the origins of both Beast and Wolverine.  Sooo coool.  There are even appearances of characters that are in the original X-men.

This movie delivers full on action.  I recommend this movie to be part of any super hero library.

The quality of the Blue Ray is just AMAZING!!  Every frame is stunningly presented and the sound was fantastic as well.  Great quality, great movie.",1254096000,6,978,4.379888268156424
3610606,4,B001GCUO16,"We got this movie even with all the mixed reviews because word of mouth among our real life friends said it was a good movie.  While it has its faults, there is a lot to love about the movie.

The good.  The main characters all do an excellent job.  Especially Jackman since he real life voice and demeanor do not even come close to Logan.  Sabertooth also does a great job in his acting for the script he was given.  You get a real sense that even though he is at odds with his brother, he cares about him more than anything else.... after all according to the movie plot, they have been together for about 150 years.

They do a good job explaining how he got the metal in him and the claws as well as his memory loss even though I personally did not like that part of it.

The graphics and effects were great too.  On blu ray especially it looked so good.

The bad.  The movie moved along way to fast.  You get a small glimpse of the brothers going through wars and stuff up till the present day but largely ignore that back story.  Then they join a special group of others like them and again we get fast forward through their time together and a very brief introduction to the other specials.  He leaves during what appears to be his first mission and somehow everyone is upset and that breaks up the group even though he was new and never did anything for them at least as the movie shows.  He goes and tries to start a normal life and of course that can not happen.  Again this was all so rushed, it should have been its own movie and spent the time to develop these characters better and their relationships.

Also far too many characters die and for no reason it seems.  Now in the first Xmen I had an issue with the fact that they were so light on killing and they needed some low level mutants as fodder but this movie just wastes good established (from the comic books) characters.

Of course as many others pointed out this movie strays far from the comics but so do the Xmen movies.  I can not really fault that here as they try to stay more in line with the other films than with the comics.  Personally I can accept this as an alternate version of the Xmen world and am ok with that.

Overall we still enjoyed the movie but were disappointed at how far short they fell with what they could have done.  I imagine that in 10 years or so somebody will pick up Xmen again and perhaps do the series right.  Good movie but not great.",1254096000,2,2442,4.190987124463519

3610608,5,B001GCUO16,"I originally downloaded this while it was in theaters like many.  I skimmed through it and I was concerned.  I never got around to watching it and decided to wait for the Blu Ray to watch it right - with all special effects in tact.

AllI even read on Amazon or other places is how bad X-Men 3 was.  X-Men 3 was good to me.  Those same people say that this film was bad.  I was expecting a horrible movie, but instead this movie turned out to be hot!!  So don't listen to the haters.  These are the same people who complain about every little thing.  We already know that Hollywood changes commic book movies around, so why get mad?  They may not have played it by the book, but at least we did get to see things that reminded me of the comic, like Wolverine's sheep lined jacket and the cigar!

Like X-Men 3, we get a chance to see characters we probably would not have seen otherwise.  Like Deadpool, Emma Frost (I hopt they do the Hellfire Club...), Gambit and others.  Speaking of which, I never liked Gambit, but this film made me like him.  I could never see why people liked him.  I still don't see it, but at least like him on film!

My only complaint is that it is only an hour and forty minutes.  However, the time seems longer as they did get everything they needed to into the film.  FOr the haters, the movie is about WOlverine and his life, not super action, although that is there too.  It is not about the other characters either.  Be happy they put so many others into thefilm instead of just Wolverine and Sabertooth.  Sbaertooth is another character I did not care for.

This movie is worthy to be in my collection and stand beside X2.  In some ways it is better due to the fact that it came later.  I thought it stupid to do an origins film, but I don't mind more.  Just not in Cyclops.",1253923200,3,1806,4.2105263157894735

Taking the helm as director is actor, Gavin Hood (""Thug"", ""The Storekeeper"" and ""Stas and Nel Adventures""), with a screenplay by David Bennioff (""The Kite Runner"", ""Troy"") and Skip Woods (""Hitman"" and ""Swordfish"").  Joining the men is composer Harry Gregson-Williams (""Deja Vu"", ""Shrek the Third"" and ""Gone Baby Gone"") and cinematographer Donald McAlpine (""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"", ""Peter Pan"", ""Anger Management"" and ""Moulin Rouge!"").

""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", the Blu-ray Ultimate 2-Disc Edition comes with two discs.  The main disc is the Blu-ray, while the second disc is a digital copy.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" is presented in 1080p High Definition with an AVC @ 22MBPS.  The picture quality is quite solid with the skin pores of both Hugh Jackman and Liev Schrieber coming quite nicely on the HD transfer.  The grittiness, the sweat, the grime,  the vibrancy is also well-captured in the film.  Blacks are nice and deep and with the film being shot outdoors, the areas that Logan visit are quite detailed. I didn't see any compression artifacts or major scratches or dust on the video transfer.

The audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (also English, Spanish and Portuguese 5.1 Dolby Digital and French 5.1 DTS).  The lossless audio track is absolutely awesome.  From Zero's gunfire, Logan's adamantium claws making the ""snickt"" sound, Wade's swords as it deflects the bullets and Victor's attacks and his growls, it's all captured and sounds incredible.  Also, there are plenty of action-scenes that really showcase the surround channels and a good amount of LFE is utilized.  From the explosions to the gunfire, home theater owners should be happy with the Blu-ray lossless soundtrack as some scenes sound quite immersive.

As expected, Twentieth Century Fox has done a great job with the video and audio transfer for ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"".  Subtitles are presented in English SDH, Spanish, Cantonese, Mandarin and Portuguese.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" comes with the following special features:

  * Commentary by Gavin Hood - Audio Commentary by the director Gavin Hood.  For the most part, Hood does a great job in providing the details to the film.  A very informative audio commentary.
  * Commentary by Producers Laura Schuler Donner and Ralph Winter - There are some interesting details about certain scenes and what went on to create those scenes via the producers perspective.  The only problem is that Donner and Winter have too many silent moments in where they are not talking.  So, it can be a bit distracting.
  * The Roots of Wolverine: A Conversation with Stan Lee and Len Wien - (16:16) Both Stan Lee and Len Wien discuss the X-Men, Wolverine as a character, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and the history of the character. An informative featurette in regards to the comic books.  For some reason, I felt that Stan Lee was not his jovial self.
  * Wolverine Unleashed: The Complete Origins - (12:02) Interviews with the director, producers, Hugh Jackman in regards to shooting the film, origins of Wolverine, training, making his claws and the set.
  * Weapon X Files - This segment features each talent in character talking about themselves and then we hear from the director/producer about what they wanted to accomplish with their character and special effects that went into the making of that character.  Probably my favorite was the featurette on Kevin Durand's Blob and what went into making the fat suit.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I literally grew up with the ""X-Men"" and ""Wolverine"" comic books when I was younger.  During the 80's, you had your American superheroes but Wolverine represented a character that was just exciting, deadly and literally kickass.

Since the release of the three X-Men films, I have no doubt in my mind that Hugh Jackman was the best casting decision made for the character.  He embodies the character completely and the amount of discipline he puts in working out and being Logan is just incredible and it shows in ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"".

For the most part, the film is full of action and full of characters.  The excitement is there, the killer instinct of both Logan and Victor are there and of course, we have pre-Deadpool Wade Wilson in the film as well, along with many other characters that makes this film fun and exciting.  And to feature a storyline that revolves around Logan's origin is not easy.  After all, having followed the comic books for so long, I think even writers had their challenge of how the Weapon X program would be and even today, just seeing how things have evolved with the program is just staggering.  So, before watching the film, I did have my reservations of how muddled the plot could be.

Fortunately, the filmmakers took a different approach and created their own storyline with some aspects of the comic book still part of the storyline.  Keeping things simple and for the most part, for those who are not familiar with the comic books, at least exciting enough to understand where Logan came from and why he and Victor have had this dysfunctional relationship.

For the most part, Jackman is just great as Logan/Wolverine and Liev Schreiber can always play the definitive bad ass.  Danny Huston as Stryker was quite effective and Lynn Collins as Kayla Silverfox did a great job as well.  As for Taylor Kitsch (""Friday Night Lights"") as Remy Lebeau/Gambit, that was quite interesting but for the most part, I felt that Kitsch did a good job albeit the thick French accent that Gambit exhibits in the comic books and people are so used to hearing from the X-Men animated series.  The others have small roles such as ""LOST"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" actor Dominic Monaghan as Bradley and Black Eyed Peas member Will.i.am also ventures to the acting world, appearing onscreen (instead of voice as he did in ""Madagascar 2').  But one of the exciting parts of this film was seeing the Blob (Kevin Durand) and of course, Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds).  It was great to see on the Blu-ray of how they came up with the Blob's outfit and of course, having Wade Wilson in the film.  It's important to note that if you are a fan of Wade Wilson, make sure you watch through the ending credits.

With all my gushing about how much I enjoy this film, one must wonder if I have any negatives.  Well, what I didn't like about the film was the overuse of CG, in which some scenes looked a bit too unrealistic.  Also, the tweaking of the Wade Wilson character was a bit too much for my taste.  I can understand some hardcore fans who may have a problem with the comic book continuity and how the film has quite a few differences but personally, many super hero films has its differences from its comic book counterpart that its not surprising anymore.  As long as the soul of the characters are intact and the storyline is well-presented, it's good enough for me.

As for the Blu-ray release, the film definitely gets a wonderful HD transfer as picture and audio quality is solid.  A good number of special features are included, as well as a slipcase and a digital copy of the film.

With that being said, ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" is a good superhero film with a lot of action.  Was it as deep and entertaining like ""The Dark Knight Returns"", my answer is no.  But I definitely enjoyed it more than the third X-Men film and even the ""Hulk"" related films.  I felt that the storyline focused on Logan/Wolverine, his rivalry with Victor Creed quite well.  If anything, it's the CG that tends to be overdone at times that bothered me a bit but for the most part, I did enjoy watching the film.

But after watching the awesome Blu-ray version and seeing the film in High Definition and watching the special features, that actually enhanced my perspective towards the film.  A lot went into the making of this film and to see that Hugh Jackman did most of his own stunts, that is incredible.

Overall, if you are a fan of Wolverine and the previous X-Men films, definitely give ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" a try.  Definitely worth recommending!",1253836800,37,9644,4.90599876314162
3610611,3,B001GCUO16,"Having known Wolverine since his first appearance in The Incredible Hulk issue #181, which I bought at my local magazine store for 25 cents! I know official issue #180 is the first appearance, but one panel hardly counts as an appearance. 'X-Men Origins Wolverine' is bound to raise a few eyebrows on hard core fans because of the reworking of the original story. Origins are tough with super heroes because they try to squeeze 20 to 80 years of hero history into a film that runs two hours or less.

I enjoyed Wolverine for the most part, but I was confused at times not knowing some of the heroes from their comic counter parts on screen. The action sequences are very cool and the story moves along smoothly for the most part, but in the end it seemed like it could have been better. It's not the worst super hero film, but it's not the best either. I liked the X-Men movies, but none of them are as well thought out as any on the Spider-Man films...yes including Spider-Man 3!

3610612,4,B001GCUO16,"X-Men Origins: Wolverine

For those who waited for this prequel to X-Men, it was worth every moment, every day of anticipation. For those who have never seen X-Men, well, this is a great place to start. In the grand tradition of the comic book, this edition features the origins of The Wolverine, the mutant who is at the core of the storyline.  I do not like to get into plot or storyline too heavily. I despise trailers with their 'let's show them the entire movie in split-second sequencing'. It's designed to monetize, not for the viewer. You'll not get that in my reviews either.

There have been some excellent renditions of the `Batman', `Spider-man', and `Watchmen' series' in recent years. With just the right mix of CGI, storytelling, and acting, we have reached new levels in the way comic books are depicted on film. Director, Gavin Hood, has taken these tools and designed an outstanding issue in this, the third installment of the series. The bar now rests at a higher level for those who follow. I enjoy director's who compete with their peers. When they get it right, amazing results are often achieved.

Like the original comic book series, a tale can be told with the flourish of great graphics, coupled with minimal, but carefully selected text, to achieve a creative and comprehensible story line. The great artist, Jack Kirby (Captain America, Fantastic Four), was the initial artist in the X-Men series. While not the creator of the `Wolverine' character, I believe he would have approved of the camera work in `Wolverine'. There is great stop action framing, perhaps homage to King Kirby. I also love the angles used in shooting. In many cases, the distant view of the entire scene is shown, much like in the comic books.

Hugh Jackman stars as `Logan/Wolverine'. He is perfect in every frame. The effort that Jackman has put into this portrayal is clear. He has turned himself into a physical specimen rarely seen in a starring role since Bruce Lee in `Enter The Dragon'. Add to this his powerful ability to project dialogue in any manner and its clear Jackman is far beyond the coveted `triple threat' that most entertainers aspire to be. His turns onstage as `Curly' in Oklahoma, `Peter Allen' on Broadway, and film roles in `Van Helsing' and ` The Prestige' solidify that fact. For good measure, he was the song and dance, comedic host of the 2008 Academy Awards show.

There is excellent supporting talent at every turn in this production. Liev Schreiber is particularly nasty as the `hell bent' Victor Creed. Musician, Will.i. Am,
Kevin Durand and Taylor Kitsch all lend nice supporting roles as well. I particularly liked Lynn Collins, as Logan's love interest Kayla.

Dominic Monaghan (Lost) lit the way as mutant `Bolt'. He was joined by and `A-Team' group of mutants that put on an excellent display of their superpowers. Rounding out the team was Tim Pocock, Ryan Reynolds (as Hal Jordan/The Green Lantern' in production), and Daniel Henney. Their scenes epitomize what many comic readers love to see in the pages, action packed, and jaw dropping abilities. They did not disappoint here.

Technical

The Blu-ray edition is vibrant and exceptional at 1924 X 1080p, 120Hz. The sound is fine on all levels at 5.1, dts-HD. The special features are many. They include the customary commentary with the director (Gavin Hood), a great feature with Stan Lee and former writer Len Wein. The back and forth banter is pure gold for fans. So many tidbits of fascinating information are thrown at you, seemingly as afterthoughts. Also included are `Ultimate X-mode' (ability to sit in the director's chair, pre-visualize Wolverine and X-Facts), a helicopter scene, insight segment, and an alternate ending.

I pop this movie in to watch with a friend, and I am instantly regretting my decision.  This movie does not take itself, the characters/history, or the viewers seriously.  I must admit though, this movie is kinder to the history of the characters than The Last Stand was.  The character most badly mauled in this was Deadpool, who coincidentally was the coolest in the early part of the movie, and probably had the most chance for an awesome future.  Instead the director/writer/morons in charge decided it would be a good idea to introduce some stupid plot twist involving Wolverine's love life and family and whatnot.  The plot in this movie can be, and should be, ignored, as the only things the movie have to offer are some decent special effects, though even then they are somewhat hokey.  If you hate Deadpool, Wolverine, or any of the characters in this movie, then I recommend it thoroughly, otherwise stay away!",1253750400,5,1128,4.554455445544554

The only thing they did right was casting Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and the symphonic score.

Fox please get Brian Singer back and do a real X-men sequel to the first two so we fans can forget the awful films that came after like X-3 by Ratner and this the worst of all.  This film makes Ratner's film look like an absolute masterpiece in comparison.",1253664000,16,559,4.205607476635514
3610618,3,B001GCUO16,"As Marvel's first in a planned line of ""origin"" stories, Wolverine appropriately starts back in 1845, when our hero is but a sickly pup in the wilds of Canada. Young James Howlett--get it, Howlett--unexpectedly sprouts spiny, bone-like claws in rage when the man he thinks is his father is killed by the man who actually is his father. It makes sense on screen, I swear. After murdering his real dad with a fist-first bum-rush, James runs off with his similarly mutated half-brother Victor Creed. The credit sequence shows the two taking part in one hundred years of conflict, from the regimented lines of the Civil War, all the way through to the horrors of Vietnam. The purpose of this is two-fold; we realize that the brothers have stuck together for over a century, but we also see them subtly growing apart. Played by Hugh Jackman for the fourth time now, James--now known as Logan--tries to rein in his animal nature, while his bro Victor (Liev Schreiber) lets loose with his primal instincts. The story begins in earnest when the two face the firing squad and, not unexpectedly, live to tell the tale.

Wolverine goes into violently rage on Blu-ray with an impressive 1080p/AVC-encoded transfer. I'm not going to lie--the issues that so many people mentioned during the theatrical release are still here, clearly defined in high definition. Of course, I'm talking about the occasionally all-too-obvious CGI. That said, this is a review of the film's transfer, not the special effects, and as such, I just have to say that the film looks great on Blu-ray.

The color palette is rich and vibrant; with a good sense of contrast overall and skin tones that are pleasingly warm. The picture can also be exceptionally sharp at times. Just check out Jackman's face as he sits in military prison--each pore, crease, and drop of sweat is rendered clearly. There are a few soft moments, specifically some of the long landscapes and the occasional medium shot, but most of the film is crisp and detailed, with fine textures apparent throughout.

The title doesn't really exhibit the sense of depth that the best Blu-ray discs can offer, though, as the CGI can make the image look flat at times. But really, I have few complaints here. Black levels are well tuned throughout the film, and though there's no overt crush or grey soupiness, a few shots could stand to be tweaked darker or lighter. The opening scene did seem a little dim to me, but hey, it's lit mostly by candlelight.

I'm giving the film a solid 8 out of 10, I do feel I have to take the CGI into account for the overall visual experience--but feel free to mentally slide the score up to 9 if needed, after all no major flaws in the BD.

I'll be the first to admit that Wolverine got a tough break. Between studio interventions and a not-quite-finished work print being leaked online before the release, the film got a thorough critical lambasting before it even arrived in theaters, and that was kept in our minds also for the BD release. Hopefully, the inevitable sequel reportedly set during Logan's time in Japan, will learn from the movie's mistakes, and maybe even take a few lessons from The Dark Knight and Iron Man about how to tell an absorbing comic book story. Until then, Wolverine is a flawed but occasionally fun watch that looks fantastic in high definition, well, BD that is... sounds great with lossless audio, and fills out a 50-GB Blu-ray disc with enough special features to keep fans occupied for several hours, at least. The overall quality of the total package definitely warrants a recommendation, keeping in mind that this is not a perfect BD.",1253664000,,3630,4.764705882352941

Just look at Dark Knight, Iron Man etc where the film make subtle changes. This is true in all book to film translations go read the Godfather and compare it to the film there are many ideas that do not translate well to film.

3610621,4,B001GCUO16,"IN 1846, a pair of young mutant boys named James and Victor murdered their abusive father with their abilities and run away to go off to many wars over the years as they don't age like regular people and are sort of immortal. From the Civil War to Vietnam in the 70's, James a.k.a. Logan (Huge Jackman) and his big brother nicknamed Sabretooth (Liv Schriber) have joined a secret government agency task force. But after killing innocent people in Nigeria, six years later he decides to make a better life in the Canadian rockies with a beautiful girlfriend Kayla(Lynn Collins) and with a job. However after Kayla was murdered, Logan particaptes in a experiment involving a rare indestructable metal called adamantium as it makes his skeleton and claws even more powerful then ever. He still retains his powers of immortality and self-healing as now he vows revenge on his brother and those that killed his true love, but it seems Stryker is kidnapping mutants and using them for experiments. He teams up with a Cajun mutant with unique explosive powers named Gambit a.k.a. Remy Labeau (Taylor Kitsch) and John Wraith (Will I.Am) who's powers include teleporting as they must find the mutants to free them.

Entertaining and action-packed prequel to the X-Men saga is a fascinating film. This one sets itself 15 years before the first movie as it tells us how Wolverine became to be the savage hero he is today and a little history that it adapts the graphic novel ""Wolverine: ORIGINS"" quite well on the screen. The mutants from the comics are here such as Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), Chris Bradley (Dominic Morgan), The Blob (Kevin Durad), Agent Zero (Daniel Henney), a young Scott Summers a.k.a. Cyclops (Tim Pocock) and an appearence by Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier. This is very entertaining but not a masterpiece like the first X-Men movies and the third movie wasn't bad as the fans proclaimed it was, this one manages to improve over that one and gave us a look of how Logan became to be long before he was a member of the X-Men.

This 3-Disc Blu-Ray has flawless picture and sound that blows the viewer out of their seats and the extras are terrific such as featurettes, audio commentaries, Files on the characters, Fox Movie Channel World Premiere featurette, a look at the Helicopter chase, a unique X-Mode Bonus view, a bonus standard def DVD and a digital copy.",1253577600,2,2375,4.80440097799511
3610622,2,B001GCUO16,"I was looking forwards to this movie (after all X-Men I and X-Men III were both good), but unfortunately, Wolverine is a special effects-laden soul-less mess.  Actors flying around on wires, men in rubber suits, guys waving fake swords around.  If I wanted to watch a fake-looking movie then I would watch Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (and I don't want to watch that either!).  Now, I would agree that the Sabretooth character in this movie is better than the portrayal in X-Men I, where he was portrayed as a dim-witted pro-wrestler type, but 2nd-rate crappy superheroes like Gambit and an annoying cowboy-hat wearing version of Nightcrawler (ie: teleports around) do not help the movie.  One would even think that matching up two completely equal fighters with equal healing abilties in Sabertooth (bigger and stronger) and Wolverine (faster, and has unbreakable bones), would be exciting, but the fights are un-inspired and just not that great.

- Hugh Jackman's appearance and acting is gripping. I believe he's one of the main reasons why people watched this movie.

- As for character developments, there was a little bit but not enough to make it a meaningful movie. For example the love between Wolverine and his wife (Lynn Collins) is only briefly depicted. The relationship between Wolverine and his brother (played by Live Schreiber) shows good contrast and conflict. It gives me something to think about. It makes the movie a little deeper than it looks. Live Schreiber is convincing and looks scary as the main villain.

I'm not an X-Men expert by any stretch of the imagination so I am not able to offer any comparisons from this movie to it's original comic book source material. Strictly from a cinematic/entertainment standpoint, this movie succeeded  on every level for me. Great story (from my point of view), great characters, great action sequences and special effects.

3610627,3,B001GCUO16,"1st off Hugh Jackman did a great job as wolverine as usual, and I like the new Sabertooth no offense to Tyler mane but this Sabertooth is more true to the comics Victor creed was also very smart and cunning not just a brute like in the 1st X-men movie.

The others actors did a great job playing their parts and the action was top notch. But they took way too many liberties in breaking from the story continuity of the comics. I tried giving this movie a chance after all the rumors and meet it with a open mind, and I did. I understand if they went to his childhood origin series and made it from front to back of the story that would be a whole other movie. That being said there was no mention of Rose who helped Logan escape from his home not Victor Creed that hit me like a hammer in the face considering that series was just out a few years ago.

They totally debunked the whole Weapon X series by Barry Winsor Smith with him volunteering for the Project. He was abducted against his will and forced into the project which not only builds more sympathy for Logan but builds on the tragedy of the hero. Silver Fox was from his distant past and her Death was a memory implant and not the reason for his sole hate for Sabertooth.

There intertwined family history was never fully established in the comics. But it is a fair and reasonable liberty to take to say that Victor Creed was Dog from origins and Wolverines Brother. They should have made this a R rated movie to truly do this justice like when James aka Logan kills his real Father when he 1st pops his claws they should have when by the books and had the mother call him an abomination and have her kill herself right in front of him with the shotgun since that was the beginning moment when James ceased to exist and Logan was born.

Last but not least that Adamantium round through the Adamantium laced skull thing to erase his Memory. Totally false when wolverine went up against Captain America his claws bounced off Caps Adamantium + Vibranium shield, and when going up against Cyber his old enemy with the Adamantium laced skin Wolverines claws bounced right off. In both cases Adamantium is unable to pierce through Adamantium. In short that bullet should have bounced right off not go through his skull, and Adamantium spine Hello no way you can decapitate him guys like you were wanting some of the actors to do in the movie.

For someone who never read Wolverine this is a great movie. For anyone who has ever read much of Wolverine this movie is a disaster and Marvel and the studio should have taken more care in making this true to the real story of Wolverine and not a quick Adaptation that strays to far from his real Origin.",1253318400,11,2704,4.378486055776892

People with high definition are going to be ordering in in Blu-Ray, and converting the movie to one's MP4 player is a waste of effort (if the movie was worth the effort in the first place).

In short, either produce the movie in full screen edition or at least have it available in both. Or just use a 16:9 for everything.

Hugh Jackman does a great job as Wolverine, and the rest of cast was well chosen by the producers and director, I even learned that Will. I.Am is a fairly decent actor, besides a famous hip-hop star from the Black Eyed Peas. Theres just a few things I had a problem with in this movie. For starters, as with most prequels/sequels, the 'cheesy factor' was fairly high in this feature. I don't understand why it nearly always has to be that way in the acting and script. I've seen a lot of really great prequels/sequels and a lot of terrible ones, this one ranks somewhere in the middle. Also, I didn't care for the plot twist at the end, when Ryan Reynolds' character, Deadpool became some freak of a mutant. I like the idea of the scientists making him into a weapon, but the special effects and make-up they used in those scenes received another high mark on my 'cheesy factor' scale. They should have spent a little more time making him look tougher and deadlier. He just didn't do it for me on the intimidation factor. As much money as it costs these days to make a movie, one would think they would spend a little more money and time on the make-up and finer details of things like this. But, I do have to give this movie a little bit of credit, they did tell a pretty good back story of Wolverine's past and where he came from and how he came to be amongst the X-Men. But my only problem I don't think I'll buy this movie any time soon, its still too much to spend on a sub-par movie that is missing a few key elements to make it a real summer blockbuster.",1253145600,5,1722,4.269113149847095

3610634,5,B001GCUO16,"I generally do not review movies, but looking at some of these reviews, I am thinking to myself, did these folks see the same movie I did.  So first, my credentials-  I am a huge comic fanatic and own thousands of x-men and wolverine comics that I have been collecting for well over 20 years.  I also enjoyed the original x-men movie, liked number 2 better, and thought the last stand was very good on its own, but it messed around with the comic storyline too much for my tastes.  I really believe ""the last stand"", on its own would be considered great otherwise.

Now,  Wolverine.  I saw it in the movies, and got it on Blu Ray.  First, it is exciting as heck. It moves at breakneck speed and the battles are terrific.  Hugh Jackman was born to play Logan.  The story is pretty impressive.  I thought the script was intelligent, and the acting outstanding.  And it kept fairly close to the story line of the comic, probably as much as it could given that it is a movie. I have no idea what people are looking for.  They talk about it just being loud dumb and forgettable, and it is anything but.

Wolvering is the best action picture of 2009, better than 2008's Iron Man (I don't care what anyone says- Explain to me Why Wolverine is not great but Iron Man is, which was lots of action, and what else really, except some anti-war soul searching which is standard fare and treated with more complexity in a coloring book for 5 year olds).  Wolverine is maybe not as deep as the Dark Knight because it did not deal with themes as complex as those in the Dark Knight, but it certainly deals with heartbreaking loss, heartbreak and vengenace in a compelling and intelligent (not to mentoin exciting fashoion) designed to cover as much of the origin story as is reasonably possible for a movie.

Hugh Jackman was terrific as Logan, and LIev Schreiber was terrific as Victor Creed.  Lengendary villain if I ever saw one.  Yet I hear nothing about his acting chops.  Some of the characters like Gambit, who is an outstanding character in his own right, are given a more perfunctory treatment, probably because at some point you can't have a movie that's 17 hours long.

 I truly believe that if you are sitting on the fence trying to figure out whether to get it or not based on the reviews, GET IT!.  Sit back and enjoy it.  It is an outstanding action film that hews fairly (although not completely) close to the comic. I tis an essential part of any action/comic fan's collection.

Wolverine is highly recommended.  Very highly recommended.",1253145600,3,2538,4.5131578947368425
3610635,4,B001GCUO16,"""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" got bashed pretty hard by critics when it opened, and I won't deny that it's not in a league with ""X-Men 2"" or ""The Dark Knight"" (what other comic book-based films are?), but viewing it on DVD, I found that I really wasn't disappointed in it, with much of the credit going to Hugh Jackman. He has such charisma and intensity that when he's onscreen, I find that plotholes don't bother me nearly as much...and this is certainly his best performance as Wolverine, yet.

If anything, the film is guilty of trying to accomplish too much; trying to answer all of the questions raised in the first three films nearly guarantees that some depth will have to be sacrificed (and the filmmakers were well aware that this could well be the last film of the franchise, and wanted to tie up loose ends). But what emerges isn't just a resolution, but a new chapter, as well, with new characters (Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool and Taylor Kitsch as Gambit are standouts), a love interest you actually cared about (Lynn Collins), and a terrific love/hate relationship between Logan and his brother, Victor/Sabertooth (Liev Schreiber). I won't deny, though, it was fun seeing Patrick Stewart, again, briefly reprising his role as Professor Xavier (and looking more youthful, thanks to CGI).

From a boyhood discovering his 'gifts' in the Canadian Rockies of the 1840s, to an explosive 1970s climax at Three-Mile Island (ah, the real reason for the near melt-down!), the Wolverine saga certainly deserves more than a one-film 'wrap', but it is fun!

Two Special Features are worth your attention, as well; a conversation between 'Wolverine' creater Len Wein and 'X-Men' creator Stan Lee is light-hearted and entertaining, with both giving sincere credit to Jack Kirby and Chris Clarement's involvement; and the 'Making Of' featurette is an often funny look of Jackman's total commitment to an exercise/diet regimen to be as 'bulked' as possible as Wolverine. He ends the piece with the hope that fans like the latest entry enough that he can play the role again, as he loves the character.

I really hope he gets his wish!",1253145600,6,2126,4.913649025069638

Except for a few things. I felt the movie was too short so there wasn't enought time to fully develop characters and plot. There are a few CGI shots that really don't work, like when you see is claws for the first time in the farmhouse, its like they didn't even try. There are a few comical parts that made me laugh like the six years later meeting between Wolverine, Agent Zero, and Stryker. Danny Huston's Stryker isn't anywere near Brian Cox's performance but he does ok. I would have like to have seen more of several characters including Gambit and Deadpool. A few of my friends and I agree that the movie is rather enjoyable until the very end of which I have two things to say that resemble spoilers the first is: If you cut off Cyclops' head I pretty sure his eye beams would stop. Ok the last thing is a spoiler: I mean honestly an adamantium bullet REALLY???? Its like at the very end the writers forgot that Wolverine loses his memory and apparently they thought that was how it should happen. FAIL.",1253059200,3,1189,4.3125
3610637,1,B001GCUO16,"First I will give you my impression as a decidely biased comic fan... this movie was horrible.  The story was so loosely based on the actual Wolverine origin story that it was hardly recognizable.  My own personal opinion is that the rewrites they did not only to the character of Wolverine but also to the myriad of characters featured throughout the movie (and most notably Deadpool) were wholely unforgivable.

All that aside, I do understand that the movie was not intended to be a simple comic to film rendition, but was created to be a stand alone which would meld with the changes that were made for the film trilogy already released.  On its own merits, the movie is still not that amazing.  The special effects are cheap at best, with most of the action being CG which is poorly laid over the original film.  The excellent effects for the claws from the original X-Men movie were simply not present in this movie, making them look painfully unreal.  The story is too long with far too many characters which receive little building or depth, and the acclaimed action packed scenes do not begin until half way through the movie and suffer from poor writing and unresolved endings.

Overall, the movie is slow, too long, and a waste of money.  If you are considering this movie for purchase... RENT IT FIRST, then make up your mind. It is a poor shadow of the prior movies.",1253059200,5,1379,4.618852459016393
3610638,2,B001GCUO16,"While watching ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" I couldn't help feeling something is missing here, in this special effect-laden ""prequel"" to the ""X-Men"" franchise. It has a lot of actions, but though they are entertaining enough, none of them is really imaginative and some effects look a bit cheesy. It has a lot of characters (including young Cyclops), but none of them are really interesting with no plot or character development. But perhaps what ""Wolverine"" doesn't have is the soul - soul of the characters including Wolverine himself.

What you have instead is typical cardboard characters and uninvolving romance / revenge story. The new film tells the story of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), his half-brother Victor (Liev Schreiber) and Stryker (Danny Huston), the leader of a shadowy military organization. Sadly, the conflict or complexity within the characters that made the two Bryan Singer-directed ""X-Men"" films something special is totally gone. Victor and Stryker are both stereotyped (psychopathic villain and military villain) and Wolverine is the hero bent on revenge. Such a waste of potential.

But of course, it might be that the new film wants to be something different, something with lots of actions and visuals. The filmmakers (including Hugh Jackman himself as co-producer) are entitled to that. However, I don't think Gavin Hood (best known for his Oscar-winning ""Tsotsi"") is the best choice for that job. With poorly-edited actions and not-so-impressive effects, the thrills and suspense is half gone especially when most characters are too stupid to know the obvious results of their choice.

What ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" really needs is a good story with more complicated characters like Magneto and Professor Charles Xavier. And veterans like Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart (the latter seen very briefly) whose acting bring the characters to life.",1253059200,5,1875,5.414383561643835

3610641,4,B001GCUO16,"I'm not the first person to review this movie, and I'm certain I won't be the last. I WILL stand with many of the other reviewers who encourage a more ""balanced"" perspective of the film, and not the ""berzerker-rage"" perspective which some reviewers have offered.

ENERGY & ESSENCE:
My review of the movie can be summarized in the headline of this review. Hugh Jackman's fourth performance as Logan truly is ""The Best There Is."" Whether it is because the movie's purpose is to focus solely on Logan, or because Hugh has evolved as an actor, or because Hugh has grown closer to the character. Jackman captures the full emotional bandwidth of the character. The pathos, the irony. the overwhelming sense of loss that comes with over 100 years of life on the planet. Part of Logan's appeal as a character has been that he is always seeking to become more than what he is. ""Gifted"" with ""powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men,"" he sees himself as an animal ""less than human."" A Samurai without a master, who sees himself as a ""failed samurai,"" etc... The movie, and Jackman's naturally-enhanced physique and dramatic performance perfectly captures all of that ENERGY of the character.

Throughout the movie, Logan is surrounded by people who see either the ""light"" or the ""dark"" in him, and as such, the character is continually pulled in different directions, and tested, and as a result - grows. Whether it is the father who raised him - who sees the best in him, or later in life Kayla Silverfox, who acts as a guiding moral beacon to Logan, reminding him over and over that ""he is not an animal."" They are (unfortunately) outnumbered by those who see the ""dark"" in him, including his mother, Victor and Stryker - the latter two who continually seek to exploit Logan's dark side to fulfill their own purposes. And Logan himself finds out that focusing too much on his dark side usually results in him paying a price of some sort.

PULSING & PUMPING THEMES:
Someone once said that a great musical score can elevate a move to ""the next level."" Part of what DRIVES this ""testosterone-filled"" film is the music. It reaches its successful goal elegantly, and ""dovetails"" perfectly with the on-screen action, supporting it without overpowering it, or drawing disproportionate attention to itself. There is a solid foundation of pulsing rhythms that are tribal in nature. However, much like Logan himself, the music combines the base primal urges with aspirational tones. A mix of classical and contemporary instruments help give certain tracks a nice sharp ""edge.""

Some characters have their own unique ""themes"" yet even these often have a ""hook"" of familiar notes/chords which remind us that these characters all reflect different facets of Logan himself. This often subtle ""echo"" also helps the entire soundtrack hold together as one cohesive entity.

All-in-all - Harry Gregson-Williams' score reflects the pure masculine energy of the character - both his ""light"" and ""dark"" sides as he grows against challenges - internal and external.
X-Men Origins: Wolverine

CONTRIVANCES - ""Marvelwood"" & ""Hollywood"":
I have seen the film in the theatre more than once. The first time I walked out of the theatre, I felt there were things that were very contrived.
Immediately after first seeing the film, I went to my ""LCS"" (local comic shop) to fill in some of the ""gaps"" in my knowledge of Logan's published history in the past twenty years. In anticipation of the film, Marvel Comics published a comic called ""Wolverine: Weapon X Files"" - which is an inexpensive ""encyclopedia"" listing the chronological history of Logan and his supporting cast.

The truth of the matter is that the published history of Logan has been ""retconned"" to be a LOT more contrived and convoluted than this film was (I mean, ""Romulus"" ? ""The Lupine Sect"" ? ""Death"" ? ""Shogun"" ? ""Daken"" ? ""Elektra"" ? and of course - ""more,"" come on...) The filmmakers (including Jackman) did a VERY fine job of ""stripping away"" some of those cumbersome contrivances in order to more clearly communicate the pure ESSENCE of the character and his driving forces, as clearly defined years ago by Claremont, Byrne, Miller and Smith.
Wolverine
Weapon X (Wolverine)

If the film had slavishly followed the published history of the character for the past 20 years, as some reviewers had wished for, here's what would have happened:
- A small ""comic-fan-boy"" percentage of movie goers would have been orgasmically excited
- The larger percentage of movie goers would have been left scratching their heads
- All movie goers would have been spending too much time ""in their head"" and not in their ""emotional heart,"" leaving the same cerebral feeling that ""Watchmen"" did.
- A shorter run in theaters (it's on its eighth week as of this writing), and less revenue
- Shorter Run + Less Revenue = Less Demand for Additional Movies
- Most Importantly - the feeling, passion, conflict and ENERGY of Logan would have been lost.

- No, in reality, Victor is NOT Logan's brother, or even half-brother
(but, he's also not his father either. That was a red herring for years in the comics)
- No, Cyclops never met Logan before the X-Men
- No, Logan never met Gambit before the X-Men
- No, The Blob nor Deadpool were ever part of Team X
- No, Stryker was not associated with Weapon X (but then again, he was never a General either...)
- No, Logan's memory was not erased with a really-well-placed-bullet to the head

However - all of these ""adjustments"" are less contrived than some of the ""retcons"" in the comics these days, and are acceptable ""prices to pay"" since they made the FILM work better as a representational, cohesive whole, easier to follow for the majority of viewers, and fulfill it's Ultimate Purpose as a vehicle for the character of Logan / Wolverine.

IN (*SNIKT !*) SUMMARY:
""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" strongly succeeds in conveying the pure masculine energy of the character, and the overall essence of the character - his conflicted journey as he strives to become more than what he has been, and some of the key emotional relationships in his past. The filmmakers have wisely chosen to streamline 20+ years of needless published exposition & contrivances - in order to focus on the strong CORE of the character, which is what has ""hooked"" readers and moviegoers for the past 34 years

Logan / Wolverine is not the ""deepest"" or ""most profound"" character ever to grace the printed page, or the cinema screen. The essence of the character is pretty direct, but not simple or two-dimensional. But, in the words of the fictional character himself, he is ""the best there is at what he does."" And more importantly, so is the Driving Force behind this film: Hugh Jackman.

WARNING: If you are a continuity-obsessed-fanboy, this film may cause anxiety, elevated blood-pressure, and in some cases hemorrhaging.

3610642,3,B001GCUO16,"now i know, i didn't see it in theaters, and i didn't bother with the pirate version, i waited to own it. im not disappointed. the movie was decent, special features, not so much, unless you really want a digital 'copy' (who would?) go for the 10 dollar cheaper single disc. the brief Stan+Len exchange was nice, but im sure ittl be anywhere you wanna look for it on the net.
i never really liked the idea of the immortal wolverine, i know it opens up countless story options for writers, it always seemed kind of a cheap way to go with the origin. but if its gonna be that way, the movie treated it well enough, and the sibling rivalry was played well. nice to see gambit, one of the better parts of the movie.
  for me it wouldve been alot more satisfying to see his first encounter with the hulk, and go(forward or back) from there. and generally, considering the available content, this couldve been an epic movie, not just ok.
  i like jackman as wolverine alot, but ive had enough of the broken hearted, reflective, desperate, searching side of wolverine, i wanna see more of the rage filled kill crazy feral destruction machine that even he cant control. isn't that the characters main appeal?",1252972800,,1200,4.516129032258065

3610644,2,B001GCUO16,"The Blu Ray format really shines when you're watching ""tentpole"" flicks. I'm talking Spielberg, Bruckhiemer, Scott (Ridley or Tony) or Snyder. Blu Ray was made for big budget action movies that push the format to give the best possible sound and amazing special effects displayed in glorious 1080p resolution with 7.1 High Def audio. With the release of the first big summer action flick of 2009 (Watchmen not withstadating), I was at least looking forward to watching a pretty terrible movie in it's best possible resolution.

ouch.

Origins is the prequel to the hit and miss X-Men franchise starring one of the most popular characters in Marvel's universe. I'm a comic fan. Not an uber fan, but I do still try to keep up and have read some of the origin stories of Wolverine. There is no getting around the fact that this is just a very poor movie that makes little use of some amazing source material. Hugh Jackman does what he can, but the story is so lame, it falls flat. Liev Schriber looks scary enough, but again, story and direction derail. And there's the introduction of two of my very favorite characters, Gambit and Deadpool. Both are perfectly cast (Ryan Reynolds will be Deadpool again and Gambit may be done), but niether have enough screen time to justify the hype. I won't spoil the end, but will say that Ryan Reynolds excels and being a smart mouth. He's playing a character that is a smart mouth. Ladies seem to love him (at least my wife sure does). And Currently, he's surpased Jackman and is the biggest star in this movie. So what do the filmakers do? Replace Reynolds with a speechless body double to fight Wolvy. LAME.

Poorly choreographed action and terrible special effects round out the film. Enter the mighty Bluray. What looked bad in the theater looks horrendous in high def. Like Indiana Jones:Crystal Skull, the special effects actually take away from the movie. The one thing that had to look good were the claws. No exaggeration, they look like the plastic toys. They are REALLY BAD. This is a case where I might suggest a standard DVD to cloud up the visuals. The sound is solid, but nothing remarkable. Special features are standard, nothing new to note and it has what is becoming standard, a digital copy.

I'm a huge fan of the summer blockbuster - I'm not a film snob by any stretch. I give Wolverine 2 stars for great casting and a good job by Jackman. Unless you are a collector of all things X-Men or have a middle school aged boy, I don't reccomend this movie.",1252972800,7,2509,4.631460674157303
3610645,5,B001GCUO16,"My hubby and I saw this on the same day that we saw ""Star Trek"" in the theater - we watched ""Wolverine"" first, and then we saw ""Star Trek"" - and I was MUCH more impressed by this film!  (NOT that I'm comparing ""Origins"" with ""Star Trek"" - they're obviously 2 totally different films - but I was completely pumped up after leaving the ""X-Men"" theater, and then was fairly quickly deflated once I settled into ""Star Trek."")  Anyway, if you want a major adrenaline rush; if you want really awesome special effects and stunts; and most importantly, if you want some honest and fantastic acting, then ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" is the flick for you.

Returning as the title character, Hugh Jackman is amazing (no surprise there!), and I love how the story really does focus on his beginnings and what made him who he is.  (I read at least one other review on here that said the story didn't deal too much with his origins; don't know where that reviewer got that idea?!?  Were we watching the same movie??)  I was also blown away by Liev Schreiber's performance as Victor Creed, Logan's brother, because he brought a scary sense of reality to his character's ever-increasing rage and ferocity.  The rest of the supporting cast was great, as well, especially Taylor Kitsch (of ""Friday Nights"" fame) as Gambit.  I certainly hope to see him in more big feature films.

At any rate, go buy (or, at least, rent) this film!!  You won't be disappointed!......I can't wait to get my copy in the mail any day now. :)",1252972800,2,1502,4.591760299625468

Ultimately for a movie about one of the most violent and 'clawed'X'Men, this movie was too PG-13. There was a lot of ""violence innuendo"" but very little actual violence. The game on the other hand had dialog that was pretty much the same as this movie, (not very good) but there were more story points and the story was more enticing. More importantly the game was a Mature rated bloodbath of wolverine goodness. Imagine God of War with X-Men. My advise if you have already seen this movie play the game. If you have not seen the movie you can watch it if you want as it is a decent action movie (just not a very good Wolverine Movie) but then play the game.

3610647,2,B001GCUO16,"The problem I had with this movie was not that it deviated from the comic. My problem was that it tried so hard to remain true to such a vast comic and movie mythology, that it ended up not making sense at all. So... Stryker wants to make Deadpool, but needs to make sure the process works, so he goes through elaborate machinations to manipulate Logan into becoming the guinea pig. It works, he survives, and so Deadpool gets created. So now Stryker wants to get rid of Logan, but he can't. All he can do is damage his brain with an adamantium bullet. Umm... hello? Why wouldn't his brain heal from that? One would assume that after all the wars he's fought in BEFORE he had a metal skeleton, he MUST have been shot in the head before. Why didn't THAT ""brain damage"" cause memory loss? Does adamantium possess some innate ""memory wiping"" properties in addition to being indestructible? Not buying it. Also... why was the hole in his adamantium cranium not still there when Jean Gray scans him lo those many years later? I understand that writing a prequel can be confining. We know that he lives and that he loses his memory, because we meet up with him in the future. Still, it's like they treated the memory loss as an afterthought. ""Hey yeah... an adamantium bullet.

3610649,2,B001GCUO16,"For the origin of the character Wolverine, you would probably expect a film that goes deep into who he was, what his life was like, etc. No, not here. The film is an hour and a half, so you can imagine how bad the pacing was. Everything happens so quickly that the characters and the story have no room to breath. It's just bad writing. You really don't connect well with any of the characters and you hardly care about them because there is no damn character development. They focused more on the action and things blowing up than they did with the actual characters.

It's hardly an origins story. It's basically everything we already know plus some crap about him trying to find out stuff that really adds nothing to the story. The end is pretty predictable and probably the only scene you need to watch if you've seen the other X-Men films. Overall, it's somewhat entertaining but the title is very misleading. They should have just called it ""Same old Wolverine"" or something along those lines, because the most we learn about him happens within 5 to 10 minutes of the film. The rest is just dull action. I hope they develop a better story with the next film. That's Hollywood blockbusters for you though huh?",1252886400,2,1214,4.568807339449541
3610650,3,B001GCUO16,"I saw it recently expecting one of the worst films ever made (like X-MEN: THE LAST STAND) and I was mildly surprised. I think that surprise was due to the fact that I had EXTREMELY low expectations. It's interesting to see so many characters in this film that are part of the X-Universe in some way, from Blob to Emma Frost to Deadpool, but waaaay too much of this film is either aped completely from other films (Agent Zero's gun skills are essentially cribbed from the far superior EQUILIBRIUM, and a drug inducing a death-like state of a loved one? Read any Shakespeare lately?) or the film has plot holes the size of The Milky Way. Seriously... an Adamantium bullet? THAT'S how you can explain something like the ending of this film? Ugh. The biggest mistake that director Gavin Hood and the writing team made was not really keeping with James Howlett's actual origin, which would have been a film in and of itself if they had adapted the graphic novel ORIGIN, but they decided to do a REALLY short adaptation of it: The opening five minutes. And then they went berserk with mutant mayhem. And the mayhem isn't so much the action or the story; it turned into a game: How many obscure mutants can we fit into one film?

The other game that it turned into was how can we create a spinoff for Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool? Like that's a character that needs its own film, especially after what they did to him in this film.

There are cool moments in the film, and moments that made me smile, and Hugh Jackman is very cool as Logan. So, again... not so bad that it made me want to punch everyone involved, like THE LAST STAND did, but not so good as to rank amongst the really-good-ness of the first film or the sheer genius of X-MEN UNITED. 3 out of 5 is a decent score if you expect NOTHING from this film other than some cool action and Jackman's wife-beater posturing.",1252800000,2,1870,4.433139534883721

3610652,3,B001GCUO16,"Taylor Kitsch (Gambit), Will.i.am (John Wraith), Liev Schreiber (Sabretooth), Hugh Jackman (Wolverine), Tim Pocock (Cyclops), Ryan Reynolds (Wade Wilson), and Lynn Collins (Silverfox).
Hugh Jackman has certainly earned his claws. The fourth film to see Jackman behind the growl of Marvel's popular anti-hero Wolverine aptly spotlights both the charismatic actor and the no-nonsense character that made his career. And a superbly cast Liev Schreiber (as the vicious Sabretooth) helps offset the film's hodge-podge plot and barrage of obscure characters.

The story focuses on the relationship between brothers Wolverine (aka Logan) and Sabretooth (aka Victor Creed), from their adolescence to wartime heroics to involvement in the controversial Weapon X program. After being sacrificed to a firing squad (an experience that ""tickled,"" Logan says), Wolverine and Sabretooth are approached by General William Stryker (Danny Huston). Stryker convinces the men to join a team of tough mutants that includes sharp-shooter Agent Zero (Daniel Henney), brawler Fred Dukes (Kevin Durand) and wisecracking mercenary Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds), aka Deadpool.

But Stryker's band is decidedly ruthless, and Wolverine resigns (much to the dismay of Sabretooth). Flash forward: Wolverine is living the mountaineer life in the woods of Canada, earning money as a lumberjack and enjoying a romance with school teacher Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins). When former members of Stryker's squad start getting assassinated -- and Kayla is thrown in harm's way -- Wolverine agrees to undergo a procedure (at Stryker's request) that will lace his bones with adamantium, a nigh-indestructible metal.

Never trust the government. It turns out Stryker has sinister intentions and Wolverine is fortunate to survive the adamantium infusion. As Wolverine endeavors to dismantle Stryker's nefarious program, he turns to fellow mutants for help, including Cajun-born card shark Remy Lebeau (Taylor Kitsch), aka Gambit, and teleporter John Wraith (musician Will.i.am). Meanwhile, Sabretooth is eager for a brotherly scrap with Wolverine and never seems far from the action.

Jackman and Schreiber are so well-cast and are so sharp in their roles that extraneous missteps almost feel excusable. Sure, Jackman could sleepwalk through his part after perfectly portraying the feral hero in three previous films, but Schreiber was a question mark. And Schreiber nearly steals the show with his fanged snarls and wolf-ish movement. Kitsch is also terrific as Gambit, though his New Orleans accent seems to waver at times.

But ""Wolverine"" is not without its problems. The filmmakers stray from the character's comic-book origin too much -- seemingly a result of character overload -- and the film lulls in the second act. There's also a sense of lost opportunity, from both storytelling and visual standpoints. In the comics, Wolverine and Deadpool have impressive-looking outfits that could translate well to the big screen in the hands of a gifted costume designer, but the filmmakers take the easy route. Movies such as ""Spider-Man,"" ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Watchmen"" have aptly adapted their title characters' costumes -- so why not ""Wolverine""?

X-Men Origins: Wolverine has a lot going for it. It has a good soundtrack, strong acting (Hugh Jackman is really raw), and the effects pretty good. Unfortunately, X-Men Origins: Wolverine doesn't rise to the level of its predecessors. For whatever reason, focusing solely on Wolverine/Hugh Jackson just doesn't work as well - he's just not the most interesting of superheroes (too noble and mysterious in my opinion).

Furthermore, rather than having the powerful McKellan as the villain Magneto, X-Men Origins: Wolverine pits Wolverine against an ambitious U.S. Army colonel who looks pathetically like Dan Akroyd. The other characters don't really strengthen the movie either and seem second-rate compared to the heavy hitters in the prior films, such as Storm (Halle Berry), Beast (Kelsey Grammar), etc.

I think anybody who enjoys action movies will like Wolverine. However, its appeal will be much more limited than the prior 3 X-Men films.",1251417600,,1176,5.146596858638744
3610657,1,B001GCUO16,"Like so many Wolverine fans, I actually had high hopes for this movie.  What a let down.  To be perfectly fair I did have expectations for this movie.  These expectations were based on the comic book story line, the overall quality of the previous X-Men movies as well as pure character development.  That being said I feel like this movie was a sham.  I remember watching the previews every five minutes on tv and thinking, wow, this is going to be a great movie.  Look, wolverine is in the civil war and world war II, they are really going to go back and look at the whole history of this rich character and show us how he came to be the character we meet in the X-Men movie.

To my utter dismay, all these scenes about Wolverine's past history amounted to nothing but a montage for the credits to roll over in the beginning of the movie.  Yeah, we get this 7 minute scene when he's a kid but nothing about living through multiple wars or throughout a long period of time.  I realize there is too much story here for a two hour movie but this to me was the essence of the movie.

The characters were also a let down.  Again in fairness, there are several characters and you can't highlight them all but I feel like the trailers also billed this as a movie where we were going to possibly meet some fan favorite X-Men that were left out of the movies.  The obvious pick was Gambit.  I remember he was rumored to be in X-Men 2, that's how long I had waited.  But what I got looked and acted more like David Copperfield than Gambit.

The special effects were nothing to write home about, the story was all over the place and contrived.  Towards the end I felt like I could overhear the corporate talking heads writing this movie, more powers, more powers.  It just felt way over the top.  I always feel like the trick to making a good comic book movie is making a world where the supernatural feels real enough for me to suspend my belief.  If you can make me believe the action I'm seeing then they did a good job.  This just wasn't the case for this movie.

I did get to play the PS3 game and it was kewl and I am planning on buying the dvd and blue ray (1 of each for my collection), and plan on watching it.
I can't wait to se it. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine can do no wrong in my eyes !!
I have read some of the reviews on here and noticed there are alot of well wishers. Meaning that they wanted to see this film like the comics have told the story, but come on folks if you really thought that was going to happen then you didn't watch any of the DC based films did ya?!!!
here's the way I see it,..at least you get to see your favorite character come to life. You finally got to see your hero kick some butt.
Comics are fantasy, not real life,..the Incrediable Hulk went through alot in the 70s and then look what they did to his latest films,...take it with a grain of salt all. I am antsy about the Captin America film being made (someday), I guess all we ALL can do is HOPE that someone will take this movie and keep it as close to the character and the history of the character as close as possible. But then again folks we're talking about HollyWeird, nothing is ever close with them people, even their real lives.
So until then ,..You can make mine MARVEL bub !!!

This is the best example of when Hollywood totally ruins a great concept. They did it with Spider Man, Star Wars, & X-Men Last Stand. Soon to follow looks to be Iron Man.

This crap of a movie was a joke. I have seen better CGI from Clash of the Titans. I love how his claws floated with the worst angles after he escaped to the farm house and they had that horrible bathroom scene. By far Liev Schreiber stole the show, his role as Sabretooth is the only redeeming quality in this film. Oh yeah Sabretooth couldn't get metal claws either. Also did I mention that Ryan Reynolds is a tool and they TOTALLY ruined Deadpool and I am going to kick whoever makes a Deadpool movie in the crotch for yet again ruining a great concept.

3610662,2,B001GCUO16,"X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a worthless entry in this popular movie series adapted from the classic Marvel superhero team.  In short:  The movie is a simple, soulless action movie that really doesn't give justice to its primary characters.  No character ever has a chance to develop a distinct personality, and we only understand Logan because of the fact that he has been a key player in three other films.

Hugh Jackman is a wonderful, very promising actor who is somewhat typecast as Wolverine at this point -somewhat sad since he's had many better performances- but he never is really given a chance to display his acting talent a single time in this film.  This movie is a rock'em sock'em with no point to it other than the filmmakers wondering how many action scenes they can jam pack into its short running time.

The point of the film seemed to be someone asking ""How many mutants can we stuff into a single X-Men movie?"" and then they just went from there.  Instead of actually giving us a chance to learn more about the character of Wolverine we end up with 90-minutes of pure action and zero in the way of character development.

Now I know summer movies are supposed to be big, dumb fun, but when we had two great movies (X-Men, X2) building up this film's title character the result is his origin isn't nearly as interesting, or exciting as those films would have lead us to believe.

The film is built on clichs and has no interesting characters.  I would recommend skipping this film if you want to preserve the mystery of the Wolverine character you were given in the first films, because this ""Origin Story"" is bound to seriously disappoint you.  And even if you're seeking a mindless action movie I would recommend renting this movie because it is not worth anything more than five-dollars.",1250726400,3,1808,4.6719242902208205
3610663,4,B001GCUO16,"Origin story of Wolverine is a decent enough time passer but if your a die-hard fan of ole' Canucklhead you'll be in for a bit of a dissapointment (I actually give the film *** 1/2 stars).

 Hugh Jackman, as always, is great as Logan, but, the welcome surprise for me was Liev Shreiber as Victor Creed. He easily made me forget about Tyler Mane from the first ""X-Men"" film. Some welcome cameos from future X-Men team members are also pretty cool.

 The action sequences are pretty standard for a film like this.
 Characters square off with one another giving warnings, showing off there mutie powers & then fighting with explosions or some sort of mayhem going on around them. To me, it seems part of the origin story was left out. Rose, Logan's first true love, in the comic story, was dropped for the movie version. The Weapon X sequence, that should be a major highlight of the film, felt like it was rushed. If your a Wolverine fan this should have been the best part of the film. The battle at Three Mile Island didn't have that much spark to it.

""Wolverine"" is not a bad film at all it's just that it seems by the numbers. I wanted something new & fresh to see with this character instead, I got a new paint job with the same mileage.

3610664,3,B001GCUO16,"I like the Wolverine character. He's one of the original anti-heroes and is revered worldwide as an all out badass of ridiculous proportion. Apart from in a recent series of comics, the origins of the Wolverine character have never really been discussed so a movie about those origins I can imagine was a bit of a surprise for fans when it was announced. The real question being, just how are they going to take on the origins of such a complex character in the Marvel universe? Let's be honest it wasn't going to be an easy task. This film acts not just as a prequel to the X-Men trilogy of films but also as a stand alone film to give the fans of the X-Men films an idea of the history of this character and just how exactly he came to be.

Starting off in 1845 a young James Howlett witnesses the murder of his father by groundskeeper Thomas Logan. Shocked and angry, James' mutation (bone claws) is activated and he attacks and kills Logan. With his last breath Logan reveals that he is James' biological father. James flees the home with Logan's abused son Victor Creed and they both promise each other that they will always have each others back. Fast forward to when they are adults and they are approached by a young William Stryker who offers them a chance to join Team X. The brothers join but soon their questionable actions cause James to leave the group.

6 years later, James is now known as Logan and is living with his girlfriend in Canada. He is approached by Stryker who warns him that someone is killing off each member of the original team. Victor is the one killing off the members and he is the one that kills Logan's girlfriend leading them into a brutal sibling rivalry. Stryker offers Logan a way of defeating Creed, joining the weapon X programme which will reinforce Logan's bones with the indestructible Adamantium. When Stryker attempts to wipe Logan's memory during the procedure Logan breaks free and vows to take revenge on Stryker and Victor. Logan needs to find Stryker's hidden laboratory known as ""The Island"" and he must enlist the help of the famous X-Man, Remy LeBeau (Gambit).

The characters in the film are a very welcome additional fantasy and comic element to the X-Men movie universe. In the X films the characters, although maintaining the fantasy element, were a bit too serious for their own good. In this, in my opinion, they have taken on a more comic book element similar to the newest comic book movies such as Incredible Hulk and Iron Man. The characters don't take themselves too seriously which, in a film like this, is always a good thing. Hugh Jackman reprises his role as Wolverine and although I did enjoy him in the X-Men films, I found he struggled slightly to keep my interest in the character for the entirety of the film.  Liev Schreiber as Victor Creed (Sabretooth to the comic fans) was an inspired choice and I have to say a much preferred one to Tyler Mane who played the character in the X-Men movies. They both had a fantastic chemistry together during their fight scenes and general acting together. The brotherhood seems believable and it makes the film work when they are beating the hell out of each other.

The other interesting characters that made this film work wonders are mainly the ones involved in Team X mainly displayed at the start of the film and, of course, the legendary Gambit. Ryan Reynolds made this film an enjoyable and light hearted piece of work as the character Wade Wilson or Deadpool to others. The funny one liners and general character demeanour made me wonder why Reynolds didn't have a larger part to play in the film as a whole. I can't help but think that the film would have been a bigger success in terms of critical ratings had he obtained a higher prominence in the film. Taylor Kitsch as Gambit achieves his goal of portraying the coolness of the character well, but doesn't match up to the brilliance of the comic interpretation. The young William Stryker played by Danny Huston isn't as intimidating as his X2 predecessor, Brian Cox, but does manage to play the manipulative role quite well.

Some of the settings really don't work as well as you would think. A lot of the indoor sets look like the sets from what you would imagine to see in a cheap independent film. The special effects when used to their fullest extent work well but other times fell short (see the initial back alley fight between Logan & Gambit) and come across as if they were done at the last minute. The fight choreography between the two brothers is at times flawless and the best example of a great fighting scene is during the end of the movie which I won't reveal anything about as it's a must see.

The film wasn't great. In fact the majority of the plot and dialogue was quite poor but my attention was brought back when the cool action would take place. Ryan Reynolds could have saved this film had his character been given a more prominent role throughout. The effects and settings work where they're supposed to but do fall flat at some points during the film. Jackman is a good choice as the Wolverine character, but he struggled slightly to hold the whole film as the character. We all learn from experience and where this film fell down may be repaired. A Sequel is apparently in the works and although we didn't see it in this instalment I do hope that we do, at some point, see Jackman put on the famous Blue & Yellow suit.",1250035200,4,5422,4.560574948665297

I can understand a few of the complaints about not sticking to original comics or stories etc...

However, the movie was very good...
The acting, special effects, story, and characters was all excellent!!!

The story leads up to0, or very close to0 where the 1st xmen movie took off...

3610668,4,B001GCUO16,"As a female fan I thoroughly enjoy the actions parts. You could tell that's where the money, and attention by the part of writers, director and producers (yes you, Jackman) went. I'll definitely get the DVD as many female fans are--for the Eye Candy! I love that Jackman is not so full of himself and that his first solo X-men flick--he spread the hottness around. I don't know if he did this because, he feels more comfortable in a group ensemble; or because he just rather give another actor a hand up. Nevertheless, in this movie you get to see more characters and a lot, A LOT of Fine Men.

LADIES TAKE NOTE:
Ryan Reynolds stands out as Deadpool--so much that a spin-off is in the works. His typical smarta$$ mouth comedy makes his one liners really zing. And the man can swing a pair of swords, and look bada$$ doing so.

Also, a lesser known Korean American actor/model Daniel Henney as weapons expert Agent Zero, makes his first appearance on a US movie. He's mostly known for Korean TV, Cinema and modeling. Yet in this flick, his supermodel looks work in his favor as he brings an icey sharp demeanor that make him one to take note of--and makes fans like me pray for a Agent Zero spin-off. His action sequence at the beginning of the film left me wanting more.

Friday Night Lights star Taylor Kitsch as Gambit was a big crowd pleaser in Comic Con, and he delivers on the big screen. This one might also have a spin-off in the future. The ladies sure love him and the guys seemed pleased with his deliver of the gambler as well.

Howevery I agree completely with other reviews. The plot was weak, and they didn't explain much about Logan's past (which was the purpose of the movie). We kind get a glimpse and quick run through and the rest is all BOOM! BAM! POW! All in all the movie was worth my money. I got a great night out with friends and a lot to drool over for. Thank you Jackman for all that nakedness! *shivers* I am totally still hoping this movie does well on DVD release. Cuz Jackman's such a good guy that he deserves it.

I hope in the upcoming spin-offs they do focus a bit more on the plot. Just a wee more than they did on this one. Cuz altho they might have felt the male comic geeks would love all the BOOM! BAM! POW! actions stuff, and female geeks would love all the nakedness and sexy...Sexy Men, we'd also would like a better story line to bring it all together. I think that's what made the X-men flicks work and do so well, so I hope they go back to that blueprint in future installments.",1249862400,28,2524,4.3276955602537
3610669,2,B001GCUO16,"I was excited to see Wolverine Origins but as the movie went on I thought to myself another comic book movie that doesn't stick to itz origins. I mean you don't exactly have to follow the comic word for word, but atleast stay close to it, they put characters in the movie that didn't match up with the timeline in Wolverine's comics. And i do agree that the other 3 X-Men movies were good but they too didn't really follow the comic story. Cyclops was a weak leader, I think Halle Berry wasn't a good choice for Storm bad accent too. I know Wolverine is the most exciting character in X-Men but the other characters also have alot to bring to the team. I hope they remake the X-Men with the original 5 Iceman,Jean Grey,Cyclops, Beast, and Angel. And then gradually bring in other X-Men characters. All these comic movies need to stick to the comics in some form or manner. I know movie producers and writers try to be creative but damn there are somethings you shouldn't mess with.

But then when I thought about it, I realized how bad it really was. On my first watch I thought that it was such a pleasure to watch the movie, but I was disappointed on my second watch. I've been reading several fan reviews on this movie and came to this conclusion. If you are a hardcore comic book fan of Wolverine or are looking for something new, you probably will be disgusted with what they did with the movie. If you aren't too familiar with the comic book stories of Wolverine or are just looking for some quick entertainment, this movie is for you. I find myself in between these two groups.
Some positives of the movie were Wolverine himself. Hugh Jackman was the best actor in the film. I was also so happy to see that complicated relationship between Wolverine and Sabretooth that was absent from X1. Other characters that stood out were Gambit and WADE WILSON (NOT THE FILM'S VERSION OF DEADPOOL). Some people also said that the action and special effects were bad. I disagree to a certain point.
Some negatives were the story. One minute the story seemed exciting, then it would fall flat on its face. The ending was exciting, but it was also... uh... how can I put this... STUPID. I'd love to spoil things so I can talk in more detail, but I think you should just see it for yourself. It's a shame that Fox greenlit a sequel to this film. I believe that there can be too much of a good thing, especially if you do it wrong. I can't wait for the Deadpool spinoff.

3610673,3,B001GCUO16,"Before this film even came out, I read that they were going to make a darker, more violent and adult version of Wolverine. Hugh Jackman himself even hinted at it. Well, as it turns out, Wolverine is neither of those-nor is it memorable. The plot is somewhat on the silly side, filled with a very boring romance, boring characters and a not-so-interesting backstory on Logan/Wolverine. This movie explains the reason for his turning to Stryker to essentially become 'Wolverine' and the reason is pretty ridiculous. There is just something missing from this film that has plenty of action, but still feels empty. The scene in X-men 2 with Logan getting the adamantium metal insterted is completely redone here, and not in a good way- I thought they botched this up badly. In X-Men 2, Wolverine escaped a bleeding, distraught mess. In Wolverine, it was done rather plainly and not so interesting.

I applaud Hugh Jackman for acting as if he actually WANTS to be in this film, as the rest of the actors sort of just appear and say their lines. Jackman really puts 100% in his role and though his character isn't as described in the comics, he is still very likable. His half-brother, Victor Creed, played by Liev Schreiber, should also be commended. He is clearly having a ball with his role, though his backstory is as bland as Logan's. The rest of the characters are extremely forgettable, and that includes Deadpool and Gambit-the latter has maybe 10 min of pointless screentime. There is a silly battle at the end featuring Deadpool and Wolverine and a boring ending. After the credits, there is a little bit of extra footage as well-again, nothing to get excited about.

Also, the special effects are, at times, noticably bad, especially in regards to Wolverine's claws. It is very random though, but I can't fathom how with all that money going into a film like this, they could disregard something so blatant.

I actually wanted to like this film, but the more I thought about, the more I found fault with it. My husband, who used to read the X-men comics, has stated that the inaccuracies are pretty glaring and appalling. I was just hoping for a good, fun film. Sadly, I guess I'll still have to wait.

Generally the point of a movie at least in my opinion is to give people an imagination, especially those that don't have one for themselves.  You want to the point, read the comics, imagine it in your mind as a movie, isn't or wasn't that the point of comics in the first place?  Fantasy and what not.  I see a movie to see the story someone wanted to tell, and most of all, to entertain myself for 2 hours with the thought ""I wish I could do that.""  For everyone who wants the direct adaptation from the comic, stop complaining and go make it, see how that one sells.  For everyone else, which anyone who knows anything about making money would know the more people you appeal to the more money you will make.  That being said I think the movie did a great job of appealing to the masses, with the only people ripping the movie being the comic nerds and the wannabe movie critics who all seem to be biased, and then I waste my time reading review after review of these people who somehow only rip a movie that they obviously saw one time, and write a long review of what the movie didn't have, and one line about what it did.  Yes some of the characters were underdeveloped, but what about everything else?  For the others, yes I noticed the representation of the alkali lake part was different, in X-men 2 you see striker as a old man saying ""he'll have no memory"" and for anyone who has any sense at all for what you can do ONCE A MOVIE IS ALREADY MADE! would understand that there will be differences.

But I was in no way prepared for it to be caveman stupid. Before I go on I would like to clarify I am writing this, not as a comic fan, but as a film fan.

 This movie starts very strong with a well done introduction to wolverine, and sabertooth. We are then treated to an incredibly entertaining segment showing wolverine and sabertooth throughout their very long lives in  extremely awesome battles.

After that we are introduced to Stryker and his team of bad-asses. They put several generations of ninjas to shame, and then the movie ends. After that the movie shifts to Wolverine: the studio version. Wolverine gets his ass handed to him for the majority of the movie whether it be his first beating from sabertooth, or from the horrible soul searingly ineffective final villan weapon 11(sobs) Whyyyyyyyyyyyyy?! Outside of the opening, the action in the movie doesn't hold up well enough to excuse the awful story.

I'm sorry, I lost myself for a minute. Why? Well, the studios were able to get Ryan Reynolds to play deadpool, and he nailed the 5 lines that he was given. After that the next time you see him his mouth has been sewn shut. Not only is that poor writing, but we also lose out on hearing what could have been very clever final battle banter.

If you like action than you should watch Star trek. If you want an actual story Watchmen should fit quite nicely.

This movie's plot has more holes than a battlefield after a bombing run and the production value is abysmal. The special effects look like they came out of the 80's. As a comic-book film, this movie is awful. As a general film, this movie is STILL awful.

It's an amazing film with great special effects and amazing acting. The film caused an uproar with a few of my friends because Gambit didn't have the correct accent, so what? THe film was made for people to watch and enjoy it, not be critized to the extent where people just don't want to talk about because people have been so harsh about it. What I really enjoyed, was that after the credits, they set it up for the next one, when Wolverine is to have his big fight with the Japaneese dude.
Another thing, I read a review on here where someone said that Storm wasn't in it, she was. You just weren't looking hard enough. She was in the cages by where Scott Summers was and also in the scene where he is leading them out to the helicopter.

One problem I have with it is hollywood taking and changing an existing character to create a new one? You will see. Not sure why they do this when there are so many characters to chose from already.",1248307200,,538,4.123809523809523
3610685,2,B001GCUO16,"Wow..I had such high hopes for this film. But it fell flat. Now I'm not a big comic book reader but even I know the wolverine story..AND HE DOESN'T LOSE HIS MEMORY FROM ADAMANTIUM BULLETS. The film wasn't too bad until the end. It wasn't spectacular or anything, but it wasn't horrible. I can overlook the shafting of sub-characters. But when you COMPLETELY re-write a main character, or a main villain...that's when it becomes ridiculous.

As previously mentioned...why they chose to erase Wolverine's memory by shooting him in the head with adamantium bullets...yeah I don't know. Why they chose to have dead pool not have a mouth...don't know. Why they chose to have wolverine have bone claws?!? ...yeah your guess is as good as mine. Heck you may as well have Cable and Apocalypse come back from the future and tag team with wolverine to take out Spiderman, Hercules, and Buzz Lightyear. I understand that certain things must change when adapting something from comics to film. I didn't even mind XMEN 3 when they completely re-wrote the phoenix story. That was because it needed to happen to make it filmable. Bone claws, a mouthless deadpool, and adamantium bullets were NOT needed. I can deal when they have to change things like have agent zero basically fly into a helicopter, or re-write the whole wolverine love affair thing...but when they add crap just to add crap...no..i'm sorry.

I've heard there is supposed to be a dead pool movie coming out...how are they going to manage that one? They are going to have to butcher the already butchered character to make something believable. I don't even want to think about it.

3610687,3,B001GCUO16,"I want to get this out first, I love the comics. I think none of these movies are anywhere close to represent the X-men as they are in the comics. That said, I think these movies exist in a different world that has nothing to do with the 616, except for the characters names and most their powers. I have no problems with these movies; X-men 1 and 2 were very entertaining action movies.  But even those movies should have been called, ""Wolverine 'N Pals"", because they didn't focus on the X-men, but on Wolverine's interaction with the other characters. My expectations of this movie were not based on the comics themselves, but on the previous movie storylines. I knew in my heart that Hollywood would somehow find a way to rape the image of one of my favorite characters in the Marvel Universe, Deadpool. So when ""Weapool 11"" popped up at the end I wasn't even surprised they would do something that silly. I read an interview a long time ago that about X-men 1 that the producers had to fight to have Cyclops wear the visor because the director didn't like it. So, I am not surprised nor bothered by the fact that these Hollywood interpretations don't have a clue about how these characters should be handled. I did like the previous movies (except 3), and understand that this is merely a diferent interpretation of these characters.

Wolverine Origins or, ""Wolverine 'N Pals 4; how this mess began"", is a very entertaining movie. But it fails to deliver a comprehensible story line. A lot of the story doesn't make any sense. The movie,( as you might be have been clued to know), is about Wolverines origins, its shows you where he came from and how his powers manifested, leading to spending a long part of his life with his half brother Sabertooth, whom we were introduced to in the 1st X-men. After many adventures and wars, the pair ends up joining a military group of people with superpowers led by Stryker. On one of the missions, Wolverine angered by Sabertooth's actions leaves the group to pursue a nicer lifestyle. This is when he falls in love with Silverfox and the pair lives happily for a while. Many years later Sabertooth comes back in a killing rampage taking out some old members of Stryker's group, and Wolverine's love is killed during this. To get his revenge, Wolverine agrees to have done on him an experimental procedure that with give him metal plated bones.

Not bad right? Love, family, betrayal and revenge. All the stuff to make a great story.  This is where it doesn't add up. For those of you that don't want ""Spoilers"" please don't read, as I might give away some plot details.
  -After wolverine finds Silverfox dead, Wolverine a veteran of many wars, doesn't check to make sure she is in fact dead? Why did he leave her body there in the field? Couldnt't his enhanced smell detect the fake blood? Was it her manipulation power that convinced him to just move on instead of taking her to a medic.
  -If she can manipulate people by touch, how the hell didn't she manipulate Stryker in letting her sister or any of the other kids go? She spends 7 years of her life with Wolvie and doesn't manipulate him, and indestructible man, to kill Stryker? Was she having to much fun maybe?
  -After Wolverine has adamantium put on his bones and escapes to visit the ""Kents"", why on earth would Stryker send Maverick with a rifle to shoot a man that can't die with metal bones? Was he going to shoot through an eyeball from a helicopter? He missed pretty badly by the way, twice. Superman gonna be angry when he goes home to visit.
  -Its revealed that Silverfox wasn't killed by Sabertooth yet after Sabertooth saves Wolverine from falling off the cooling tower, Wolverine tells him ""this doesn't change anything"". Why? She's not dead. She fooled you. He saves you from falling and having your butt kicked but Weapon 11, why the hell are you still mad at him?
  -Stryker failed to wipe Wolverine's memories so the solution is to shoot a guy with metal on his skull on his head? How the hell does that work? How did he know it would work?
  -Why did the most powerful telepath (Professor X) not control someone inside the 3 mile island release the kids? Why wait 7 years and then help.  Why didn't he do that stop time thing from the previous movies so he can save the kids? Where was Magneto? Doesnt he care about abused mutant kids? (One of the restrained kids looked like Quicksilver, who is Magnetos son in the comics)
  -How come those kids couldn't get away on their own? What was that chain link fence cage they were in made of? Adamantium?
  -Why was Gambit hanging out in a casino, when he knew he was being looked for by Stryker?  How was it that Stryker can't find him in a long time and yet Wolverine finds him in a day? Maybe Stryker didn't want him anymore. Maybe they couldn't persuade the Blob to talk?
  -Why add the scene in the end where Stryker is going to be arrested for his crimes, when we well know that he was a high ranking military official in X-men 2?

Well these are most of the plot points from the movie that just don't make any sense. It's ok for an action movie to be extremely silly and self referential in that way. For example in Transformers when they have the teen kid take the cube and the alien so they can hide in the populated city, one of the characters mentions how dumb that idea  is. They make no excuses in this movie, and just because it's ""supposed"" to be a dumb action movie, there is no justification for the producers of this movie to assume their viewers are idiots, and won't care about a story plot that doesn't make any sense. Which, apparently they are correct because this movie made a boatload of cash. I will not act like there is nothing wrong with this movie just because it's flashy and has lost of explosions.

In my arrogant opinion, it's a onetime watcher. This is not a boring movie by far, yes, it's a lot of fun and tons of action and the movie's cast was really great. But the story is convoluted and nonsensical, it seems to take the audience for granted. So, if you want to enjoy this mess, just ignore the entire story and watch the shiny stuff happening on screen.",1247616000,151,6165,4.48125
3610688,4,B001GCUO16,"Okay,so it wasn't the best written.  Hugh Jackman is still fun to watch.  It seems like most of these reviews are from men.  Well from a female perspective, Hugh did fine by me.

3610689,3,B001GCUO16,"After three movies of amnesia and claw-slashing, Wolverine is actually getting his own movie, all for his own. Sure, some familiar characters appear, but the stage is for him alone.

And it's neither a horrendous movie nor a good one -- just a popcorn collection of explosions and Matrixian fight scenes, linked together by a rather loosely-strung plot that doesn't have any twists or unexpected events. Hugh Jackman does a simply stellar job as the beclawed titular character and it has some funny moments, but the part of the movie that galvanized me the most was the trailer for ""District 9.""

After a century of fighting, James Logan (Jackman) and his savage half-brother Victor (Liev Schreiber) are recruited by a mysterious army officer, William Stryker (Danny Huston), to join his elite mutant squad. Logan is sick of killing, so he tries to have the quiet life with his girlfriend Kayla (Lynn Collins) as a humble logger... until Victor reappears and murders Kayla, as part of a vendetta against his old teammates. Intent on revenge, Logan accepts the offer Stryker gives him -- he will accept a horrible and painful procedure that will make him invincible, so he can kill Victor.

With an adamantium skeleton and an instantly-healing body, the newly-renamed Wolverine is invincible -- but he soon finds himself on the run not only from his older brother, but from Stryker's ruthless military forces. Now he must uncover a mysterious ""island"" that only one mutant has ever escaped from... except there are some other nasty surprises waiting for him there, courtesy of Stryker's experiments.

By all rights, ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" should have been a far better movie than it is. But the story itself is only so-so -- it's rather straightforward in its narrative without many twists, and the Sabretooth/Wolverine backstory is handled pretty confusingly. It's only in the last quarter that the movie really acquires that epic comic-book feeling -- up until then, it's a rather bland you-killed-my-master/relative/truelove-REVENGE! tale.

So with a bland plot, they slather on the action -- it feels like at least 75% of the movie was written to allow maximum explosions, motorcycle chases, Matrixian wire-fu, and endless claw fights. In fact, the movie is at its best when it has either some really tightly-wound fight scenes (such as the boxing match with The Blob), or a sense of humour (Wolverine accidentally destroys a nice little elderly couple's bathroom, and walks out repentantly holding their sink).

And then there's Wolverine himself -- he can heal from anything, and his metal skeleton means he can't even be chopped up. In other words, he's indestructible. It's really hard to worry about the guy physically, and ""Origins"" never gets around to making us fear that he'll lose anything else.

So it's a credit to Jackman's talent that he actually makes us care about Wolverine -- roaring, confused, grief-stricken, and slowly being hardened by all the betrayals and lies. And Schreiber does an excellent job as well, especially considering that Sabretooth is as likable as an ingrown nail -- he actually almost makes us feel sorry for his character now and then. Too bad we never, uh, really figure out why he wants to kill his brother.

And there's a lot of great lesser roles as well -- Collins does a decent job considering her total lack of chemistry with Jackman, while the coldly contemptuous Daniel Henney, kindly will.i.am, charming gambler Kitsch and puckish Dominic Monaghan all do great jobs with their smaller-scale roles. Huston is okay, but he never quite seems scary or fanatical enough.

""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" has enough explosions, stunts and elaborate aerial fight scenes to shame most blockbusters, but it's lacking heart and plot. The thing that makes it worth watching: the actors.",1246665600,7,3828,5.092503987240829

3610691,4,B001GCUO16,"I thoroughly enjoy the actions parts, you could tell that's where the money and attention by the part of writers, director and producers (yes you, Jackman) went. I'll definitely get the DVD as many female fans are--for the Eye Candy! I love that Jackman is not so full of himself and that his first solo X-men flick--he spread the hottness around. I don't know if he did this because, he feels more comfortable in a group ensemble; or because he just rather give another actor a hand up. Nevertheless, in this movie you get to see more characters and a lot, A LOT of Fine Men.

LADIES TAKE NOTE:
Ryan Reynolds stands out as Deadpool--so much that a spin-off is in the works. His typical smarta$$ mouth comedy makes his one liners really zing. And the man can swing a pair of swords, and look bada$$ doing so.

Also, a lesser known Korean American actor/model Daniel Henney as weapons expert Agent Zero, makes his first appearance on a US movie. He's mostly known for Korean TV, Cinema and modeling. Yet in this flick, his supermodel looks work in his favor as he brings an icey sharp demeanor that make him one to take note of--and makes fans like me pray for a Agent Zero spin-off. His action sequence at the beginning of the film left me wanting more.

Friday Night Lights star Taylor Kitsch as Gambit was a big crowd pleaser in Comic Con, and he delivers on the big screen. This one might also have a spin-off in the future. The ladies sure love him and the guys seemed pleased with his deliver of the gambler as well.

Howevery I agree completely with other reviews. The plot was weak, and they didn't explain much about Logan's past (which was the purpose of the movie). We kind get a glimpse and quick run through and the rest is all BOOM! BAM! POW! All in all the movie was worth my money. I got a great night out with friends and a lot to drool over for. Thank you Jackman for all that nakedness! *shivers* I am totally still hoping this movie does well on DVD release. Cuz Jackman's such a good guy that he deserves it.

I hope in the upcoming spin-offs they do focus a bit more on the plot. Just a wee more than they did on this one. Cuz altho they might have felt the male comic geeks would love all the BOOM! BAM! POW! actions stuff, and female geeks would love all the nakedness and sexy...Sexy Men, we'd also would like a better story line to bring it all together. I think that's what made the X-men flicks work and do so well, so I hope they go back to that blueprint in future installments.",1246492800,2,2507,4.336886993603412

This one boasted cheesy effects, typical action movie set ups (come on - throwing a lit cigar on to a gasoline line and walking away in slow motion as the explosion happens behind you - really? Is it time to bring that one back already?) and basic 80's action movie level writing. ('I said 'bub', not 'blob'? - hmmm.)

It's like they wrote an origin story of the 'movie version' Wolverine with hints of the 'comic book version' thrown in. Logan found by an old couple on a farm? What is this Superman? In the comic, he breaks loose, kills a bunch of cyber guards and then confronts a grisley bear all the time wearing a cool metallic visor. Dope! In this movie we get to see him cut a bathroom sink and then there's that slow motion bit with the gas line.

[...] I mean, the movie takes place in the 1970's after it gets going. Gambit would have been a little kid. And that whole thing with Ryan Reynolds was a disaster for his character and him as a comedic input. Wasted talent!

The whole film feels rushed and like it was written by a bunch of 65yr old men who don't read comics, but like Steven Seagal movies. (no offense Stevie) Dis-muthaluvin-Saster!

And I hope they go through with the rumored Deadpool prequel/sequel movie they have planned; Ryan Reynolds is awesome!

As much as I'm not too crazy over Marvel characters (with the exception of Daredevil and the Punisher), I do find Wolverine as one of the most intriguing characters in the Marvel universe, even though he is a bit overexposed. He is interesting the same sense as Superman in that he hardly ages and can not be killed by conventional methods. How would that affect someone? While the topic for both Superman and Wolverine can be dark, it is Supes that takes it lighter than Wolverine. Supes sees death and destruction (very rarily, but sometimes, by his hand and because of him), and while every living being's death does bother him, he has the inner strength to let go of things past and look to the ""big picture."" Wolverine, however, sees nothing but death and destruction (often by his own hand or because of him), and it plagues him to no end, even though he pretends to not care. Supes has the convenience of understanding that his alien biology causes his remarkable powers -- it's who he is, it's how he was born. On the other hand, Logan's power (his bone claws and regenerative healing) while being from his mutant-born gene, are outweighed by his violated feelings about the adamantium fused to his skeleton as well as the memory tampering by the Weapon X program (that's where the movie differs from the comic: Logan did not volunteer for the adamantium Weapon X operation).

They've already announced a sequel for this film, and are having some of the story take place in Japan, no doubt showcasing either Logan's 1937 run-in with Ogun, in 1945 where he finds love with a girl in Hiroshima, or post-WWII where he conceives a child with Itsu. Even though all take place before the Weapon X program, it still would be great material to see on screen.

Look for appearances by Agent Zero, Deadpool, John Wraith, Blob, a young Cyclops, Silver Fox, Emma Frost, Gambit, and Sabretooth. Overall a good job from Marvel Studios!",1245801600,2,3045,5.62962962962963
3610697,5,B001GCUO16,"Okay, first of all let me explain my rating.  I gave it 5 stars based on the creativity of the movie.  However, based on how loyal it is to the comics, I would give it a 1.  In the movie James Howlett (Wolverine/Logan) is actually the son of his mother's gardener, Mr. Logan, and not Mr. Howlett.  In the movie they also make Dog Logan into Victor Creed/Sabretooth.  So Sabretooth is Wolverine's half-brother in the movie.  At first Victor and James are the best of friends, then after about 100 years of physically staying in their late 30's early 40's, the two brothers go their own way after doing a special operation with Wraith, Bradley/Bolt, Deadpool, a very well built blob, and crazy facist extroidernair, Stryker.  So Wolverine quits his dayjob and settles down with his new girlfriend Silverfox.  Note:  Silverfox doesn't have the regenerating power that she did in the comics.  He also has a new job working for a lumber company.  After a while Stryker and Agent Zero track down Wolverine and recruit him for a new ""job"".  Job meaning ""Oh nothing special.  We're just going to pump a few pounds of an indestructable metal alloy into your bones which may cause you to die and get constantly harassed by Ian McKellen in the future"".  Well the operation is a success, Wolverine gets away from Stryker and lays low with a nice old couple for a while.  Then Agent Zero finds Wolverine, kills Uncle Ben and Aunt May (Whoops, wrong movie), and does the whole incredibly expensive helicopter vs roadhog fight scene.  Wolverine wins.  Duh!  Wolverine finds Wraith, convinces him to find Stryker for revenge,  fights fat Blob for information, and goes to New Orleans to find everybodies favorite Ragin' Cajun.  In the N-O Wolverine finds Remy Lebeau/Gambit, has a big fight scene with him, and eventually gets Gambit on his side.  Question:  If Wolverine was in the alley right behind the casino, why did Gambit run ten blocks to fight him?  So any way Gambit uses his Aeroplane to fly Wolverine to Stryker's private reso-uh, I mean island, fights Deadpool/Weapon XI with the help of Victor Creed, Gambit finally shows up, blah blah blah, end credits.

3610699,5,B001GCUO16,"I'm not the first person to review this movie, and I'm certain I won't be the last. I WILL stand with many of the other reviewers who encourage a more ""balanced"" perspective of the film, and not the ""berzerker-rage"" perspective which some reviewers have offered.

ENERGY & ESSENCE:
My review of the movie can be summarized in the headline of this review. Hugh Jackman's fourth performance as Logan truly is ""The Best There Is."" Whether it is because the movie's purpose is to focus solely on Logan, or because Hugh has evolved as an actor, or because Hugh has grown closer to the character. Jackman captures the full emotional bandwidth of the character. The pathos, the irony. the overwhelming sense of loss that comes with over 100 years of life on the planet. Part of Logan's appeal as a character has been that he is always seeking to become more than what he is. ""Gifted"" with ""powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men,"" he sees himself as an animal ""less than human."" A Samurai without a master, who sees himself as a ""failed samurai,"" etc... The movie, and Jackman's naturally-enhanced physique and dramatic performance perfectly captures all of that ENERGY of the character.

Throughout the movie, Logan is surrounded by people who see either the ""light"" or the ""dark"" in him, and as such, the character is continually pulled in different directions, and tested, and as a result - grows. Whether it is the father who raised him - who sees the best in him, or later in life Kayla Silverfox, who acts as a guiding moral beacon to Logan, reminding him over and over that ""he is not an animal."" They are (unfortunately) outnumbered by those who see the ""dark"" in him, including his mother, Victor and Stryker - the latter two who continually seek to exploit Logan's dark side to fulfill their own purposes. And Logan himself finds out that focusing too much on his dark side usually results in him paying a price of some sort.

PULSING & PUMPING THEMES:
Someone once said that a great musical score can elevate a move to ""the next level."" Part of what DRIVES this ""testosterone-filled"" film is the music. It reaches its successful goal elegantly, and ""dovetails"" perfectly with the on-screen action, supporting it without overpowering it, or drawing disproportionate attention to itself. There is a solid foundation of pulsing rhythms that are tribal in nature. However, much like Logan himself, the music combines the base primal urges with aspirational tones. A mix of classical and contemporary instruments help give certain tracks a nice sharp ""edge.""

Some characters have their own unique ""themes"" yet even these often have a ""hook"" of familiar notes/chords which remind us that these characters all reflect different facets of Logan himself. This often subtle ""echo"" also helps the entire soundtrack hold together as one cohesive entity.

All-in-all - Harry Gregson-Williams' score reflects the pure masculine energy of the character - both his ""light"" and ""dark"" sides as he grows against challenges - internal and external.

CONTRIVANCES - ""Marvelwood"" & ""Hollywood"":
I have seen the film in the theatre more than once. The first time I viewed the film, I felt there were elements that were very contrived.
Immediately after that viewing, I went to my ""LCS"" (local comic shop) to fill in some of the ""gaps"" in my knowledge of Logan's published history in the past twenty years. In anticipation of the film, Marvel Comics published  a comic called ""Wolverine: Weapon X Files"" - which is an inexpensive ""encyclopedia"" listing the chronological history of Logan and his supporting cast.

The truth of the matter is that the published history of Logan has been ""retconned"" to be a LOT more contrived and convoluted than this film was (I mean, ""Romulus"" ? ""The Lupine Sect"" ? ""Death"" ? ""Shogun"" ? ""Daken"" ? ""Elektra"" ? and of course - ""more,"" come on...) The filmmakers (including Jackman) did a VERY fine job of ""stripping away"" some of those cumbersome contrivances in order to more clearly communicate the pure ESSENCE of the character and his driving forces, as clearly defined years ago by Claremont, Byrne, Miller and Smith.
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wolverine/dp/0785137246/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wolverine</a>

If the film had slavishly followed the published history of the character for the past 20 years, as some reviewers had wished for, here's what would have happened:
- A small ""comic-fan-boy"" percentage of movie goers would have been orgasmically excited
- The larger percentage of movie goers would have been left scratching their heads
- All movie goers would have been spending too much time ""in their head"" and not in their ""emotional heart,"" leaving the same cerebral feeling that ""Watchmen"" did.
- A shorter run in theaters (it's on its eighth week as of this writing), and less revenue
- Shorter Run + Less Revenue = Less Demand for Additional Movies
- Most Importantly - the primal feeling, passion, conflict and ENERGY of Logan would have been lost.

- No, in reality, Victor is NOT Logan's brother, or even half-brother
(but, he's also not his father either. That was a red herring for years in the comics)
- No, Cyclops never met Logan before the X-Men
- No, Logan never met Gambit before the X-Men
- No, The Blob nor Deadpool were ever part of Team X
- No, Stryker was not associated with Weapon X (but then again, he was never a General either...)
- No, Logan's memory was not erased with a ""really-well-placed-bullet"" to the head

However - all of these ""adjustments"" are less contrived than some of the ""retcons"" in the comics these days, and may be acceptable ""prices to pay"" since they made the FILM work better as a representational, cohesive whole, easier to follow for the majority of viewers, and fulfill it's Ultimate Purpose as a vehicle for the character of Logan / Wolverine.

IN (*SNIKT !*) SUMMARY:
""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" strongly succeeds in conveying the pure ""testosterone-filled"" masculine energy of the character, and the overall essence of the character - his conflicted journey as he strives to become more than what he has been, and some of the key emotional relationships in his past. The filmmakers have wisely chosen to streamline 20+ years of needless published exposition & contrivances - in order to focus on the strong CORE of the character, which is what has ""hooked"" readers and moviegoers for the past 34 years

Logan / Wolverine is not the ""deepest"" or ""most profound"" character ever to grace the printed page, or the cinema screen. The essence of the character is primal, direct, but never simple or two-dimensional. But, in the words of the fictional character himself, in his niche, he is ""the best there is at what he does."" And more importantly, so is the Driving Force behind this film: Hugh Jackman.

WARNING: If you are a continuity-obsessed-fanboy, this film may cause anxiety, elevated blood-pressure, and in some cases hemorrhaging.

The story starts early in 1840's Canada Northwest Territories (history tells us this section of Canada was not ""Northwest Territories"" until 1870 but this is a review, not a history lesson) -- with Wolverine as a child living with his brother and father.  Seems Logan is a mutant and has bone claws when he gets emotionally distraught.  When his father is killed by a gunshot, Logan gets very angry and slices the guy who did it, who turns out, in his dying breath is Logan's actual father.

What?

No explanation on why this is and it has nothing to do with the rest of the story, other than a plot device to have Logan and his brother (Sabertooth) escape into the forest to fend for themselves.

A very fast run through American wars -- Civil, WWI, WWI, Vietnam -- (what happened to Korea?  Oh well) -- find Logan's brother loving the bloodlust to a point where he enjoys killing and nearly rapes a Vietnamese woman until Logan steps in.  Even so, Logan watches his brother's back.

Somewhere in there Logan's wife is apparently killed -- more tragedy -- and when Striker steps in, the most oily, sly, deceitful military man in film history, convinces the mutant pair that they were made for better things.

Logan gets the adamantium bones and basically escapes with his life.

The director found it necessary to fill time, so he gives us an old farm couple that takes in Logan.  Hardly five minutes goes by when they're mercilessly gunned down by Striker's forces.  Why?  Such an unnecessary part of the story and did nothing for the plot other than what a bastard Stryker is, but we knew that.

And a CGI version of Patrick Stewart was very, very disappointing!

There's a post-credit scene at a bar that does nothing to liven interest in the plot at all.

The comic book movie succeeds in filling in the missing holes in Wolverine's past but has enough Swiss cheese in the storyline to begin entering Daredevil territory (YES, I said it!).

The brief intro with Gambit and Deadpool was entertaining but disappointingly little was done to flesh out these characters,

Rental!

3610706,4,B001GCUO16,"I'm a long-time X-Fangirl, but I'm trying to write this review as a movie viewer, instead of someone who knows exactly where the movie deviated from the comics on a panel by panel basis.  *coughs*

Two brothers, Victor (Sabertooth) and James/Logan (Wolverine), join a government program of mutants called Weapon X and fight in a lot of wars.  Wolverine grows disgusted by his teammates bloody actions and quits, appearing years later as lumberjack with a girlfriend named Kayla Silver Fox (which should win the movie an Oscar right there, I tell you).

Of course, he can't leave his past behind that easily, and soon finds himself the target of his old Weapon X buddies.  So, he teams up with his friend Kestrel/John Wraith and goes in search of Gambit/Remy LeBeau, the only man who ever escaped Weapon X.  From there, more big fight scenes ensue.

The result was a fun popcorn flick.  The action scenes were great, well done and exciting.  Because the movie went for action over characterization, no character was unforgettable.  However, a few were surprisingly interesting.  Deadpool/Wade was funny and deliciously amoral, while Kayla Silver Fox was an unusual heroine, wise and spiritual with an edge of sarcasm.  Unlike, say, the Punisher or Iron Man movies where the time spent on romance made me want to fall asleep, I was interested in Logan/Wolverine's interaction with Kayla.

The plot was predictable, but not groan-inducingly so, and it was bolstered by good acting and effects.  Moments of humor broke up the drama, such as naked Wolverine streaking past an old couple.

Overall, I recommend ""Wolverine"" to fans of action who don't demand that all plot lines make sense.

For fellow comic book fans: there's lots of deviation from the comics, but fans of certain characters are advised to go anyway.  Of course, if you're a Wolverine or Sabretooth fan, you're going to be very happy.  But there are a lot of favorites in smaller roles who get good parts too.  Taylor Kitsch was perfect as Gambit, sexy and disarming one minute, dangerous and violent the next.  Blob was great, a dorky dimbulb who gave us the movie's funniest scene: a boxing match with Wolverine.  And, as stated above, Ryan Reynolds became Deadpool.  He played Wade a bit more staid then we're used to in the books, but it fit, and the old love of violence and droll sense of humor were present.

So: action fans will like this one, as will comic fans who aren't purists.  Fun stuff.",1244160000,3,2464,4.825775656324582
3610707,1,B001GCUO16,"This is exactly the kind of loud and dumb movie that the X-Men franchise specifically sought to avoid becoming.  The first two films (X-Men and X2) were some of the best examples of a smart, socially relevant story adapted into an epic, fun and wholly emotionally satisfying adventure. Since director Bryan Singer stepped away from the franchise, these films have (seemingly) been overtaken by mindless Fox execs who have no idea how to handle these characters in a way that doesn't become an uninteresting paint-by-numbers explosion B-Reel.

And no, ""It's Not That Bad"" is not a reason to see Wolverine. That's an unnecessary excuse that, give the leaps in quality the Comic Book genre has made, it's a completely erroneous excuse.

Both of those films set a high water mark for comic book franchises, and unfortunately director Gavin Hood (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tsotsi/dp/B000FC2FX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tsotsi</a>) can't seem to get his filmmaking arms around what would make Wolverine a compelling character over the course of 107 minutes. Don't blame Hugh Jackman, who puts in a valiant effort now in his fourth familiar turn in the title role. Addressing the inner demons of a conflicted character should have been within Hood's oeuvre given his previous serious-minded work, but he seems overwhelmed by the film's persistent blockbuster aspects. Fight scenes seem identical with each other, and there are lots of them here, so much so that the net result is more wearing than enthralling with the choreography and special effects looking the same from scene to scene. There are also new characters constantly introduced, each with some unique superpower of dubious distinction, so the story starts to feel like a springboard for yet more franchises.

Given that I am not familiar with the X-Men series, I will trust that screenwriters David Benioff (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Kite-Runner/dp/B0012OX7EO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Kite Runner</a>) and Skip Woods have remained faithful to the comic book with the convoluted storyline, a true chore to follow for the uninitiated like myself. The opening sequence shows Wolverine as a sickly child sometime in the middle of the 19th century. Along with his brother Victor, he has apparently fought every major war since the Civil War, both getting killed and resuscitated for their next enlistment. The immortality aspect is probably the most problematic aspect of the story since it really doesn't give the viewer any legitimate reason to be concerned with Wolverine's ultimate fate. Consequently, the story focuses the conflict more on Wolverine's soldiering for the government and his growing identification as a mutant. This inner turmoil tears the brothers apart since Victor cannot forgive his brother for deserting the military. However, living peacefully as a poor lumberjack in Canada with his comely schoolteacher girlfriend Kayla does not prevent him from being drawn back to the cause as a member of an elite mutant unit due to the persistent efforts of Colonel Stryker.

Even if abject alienation is still not his forte, Jackman does what he can with a rage-filled cardboard role that requires him to alternate between vindictive and sympathetic in lightning flashes. In an exasperating turn, Liev Schreiber has even less latitude as Victor (a.k.a. Sabretooth) since we never figure out why he turns so completely malevolent. Danny Huston fares better as Stryker since the character is rich in Machiavellian tendencies that are easy to root against. Lynn Collins plays an ambiguously dichotomous role similar to Eva Green's in the James Bond vehicle,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casino-Royale/dp/B000MNP2KI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casino Royale</a>, and Ryan Reynolds has a near-cameo role as yet another comic book franchise in the making. He provides some much needed comic relief, but it's not enough to offset the constant mayhem. The explosion-driven helicopter chase and the relentless fight atop the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor are the only set pieces that linger in the memory. The rest of the movie will have greater resonance for devoted fans of the comic book.",1243728000,3,4167,6.399644760213143
3610712,4,B001GCUO16,"X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a good prequel with Hugh Jackman, once again, starring in his most famous role as Wolverine. The focus is on the origin and essence of the young man who becomes the most famous Marvel Universe mutant. In the same vein as the recent comics storylines, this movie adaptation reveals that despite his somewhat youthful appearance, Wolverine is among the oldest of the mutants. His physical prowess, as well as his abilities to physically heal immediately after being injured, make him virtually ageless in the sense ascribed to the Vampires and Lycans in Underworld.

Though not perfect, X-Men Origins: Wolverine has no quickly apparent plot holes. The attention was placed upon the title character, as one would rightfully expect. A ""sibling rivalry"" against Sabretooth provided an interesting twist that laid the foundation for both character and story development. And it is the escalating animosity between the two that plays to the movie's strengths.

Fascinating special effects are added as Wolverine's physiology undergoes drastic transformations. With his natural healing abilities put to the ultimate test, Wolverine is having to endure levels of extreme pain, as his skeleton is infused with the indestructible metal that comes to be known as adamantium.

Wolverine, by undergoing this experiment, is identified as the outcome of the Weapon X project, which, as a central theme in itself, adds nice science fiction components. Involved in the program are the capture of mutants of exceptional ability and then taking samples of their traits and later amalgamating them to create a type of indomitable super soldier. One might not help but think of Frankenstein or Re-Animator but with a higher level of genetic engineering involved.

Ironically, it is when the the most stunning visuals are displayed that the story momentarily loses traction. As the movie delves further into the Weapon X project, the viewer finds out that it is part of a grand scheme designed to wage war on mutants. This overture, I think, could and should have been avoided. Though there are brief glimpses of the early pasts of Wolverine and Sabretooth, as they survive the Civil War, WWI, WWII, and the Vietnam War, the history of how humans came to fear mutantkind is not intertwined. Thus the mutants are our enemies theme does not serve an insightful, pivotal element.

However, despite the deficient forthcomings that have emanated, things are properly adjusted, and X-Men Origins: Wolverine turns out to be a success as opposed to a disappointment that fizzles to the end. The movie gets back to its strong points, where we are entreated to a Wolverine and Sabretooth showdown, as well as romantic involvements concerning Wolverine that were never introduced in the previous X-Men releases.

Overall, a thumb up for this near masterpiece. Hugh Jackman, as anticipated, shows his acting talents and, once again, recreates one of the most fascinating and popular Marvel characters around. His Wolverine, from a theatrical perspective, triumphs as the lovable, perfect character who, though not idealistic, has far too much courage to be branded an antihero.",1243728000,3,3170,5.242603550295858

I enjoyed the previous x-men movies (except number 3) and figured this had to be a better movie. It was dull beyond comparison. Blowing stuff up and non-stop fighting is getting old in the movies. We've seen it, we know what computers can do. There was virtually no character development whatsoever. Those of us who know the X-men want to know more about their lives, not just who they can fight. The entire story was incredibly predictable, so much so, that it got so painful to watch we didn't even stay for the last 15 minutes and asked for our money back.

The mutants were boring and uninspired (was it really the best the comics universe could offer?)  Probably the best part was the first 5 minutes where Wolverine's and Sabertooth's militant past was captured. After that, the movie felt like a patchwork of random events assembled to tie this movie to the rest of X-Men franchise.

Im not some huge xmen fanboy, but i have come to learn certain things over the years... things this movie tinkles all over, and not just accidentally. some of the things they AIM RIGHT FOR and say ""HA!! i don't care if this is what really happened, im changing it!!""  Like Weapon X being the roman numeral 10... meaning wolverine was the tenth experiment (american experiment) so the one before him was Weapon 9, and the one after him was Weapon 11.

If you can look passed how horribly the butchered the story (which given how much unknown stuff the COULD have written about, and been right, its inexcusable) then the movie was pretty good.  Good acting, everything looked sharp and clean, the effects were nice.  So if you know nothing about Wolverine and the XMen, sit back and enjoy.. otherwise it might be more enjoyable if you watch it next time you're at the dentist getting teeth pulled... at least that should distract you from the movie enough to be able to enjoy it",1243382400,18,1242,4.35064935064935
3610716,5,B001GCUO16,"The first thing to remember about X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE is that it is based on a comic book (admittedly, one I have not read).  If you can remember that, and take this movie as it is meant to be, then WOLVERINE is extremely entertaining.  Just suspend your disbelief and enjoy the ride.

X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE is a sort of prequel to the X-Men trilogy of films.  In WOLVERINE, we learn about two half-brothers, Victor and James, who are born in the 1800s, both with unusual characteristics.  It seems that these two young mutants are virtually indestructible.  Living through the better part of two centuries, fighting war after endless war, Victor and James become killing machines, better known as Sabrertooth and Wolverine.  The brothers eventually get pulled into a super-secret government unit, whose purpose is unclear, but deadly for those who defy it.  However, James is getting tired of it all, while Victor is starting the like it much too much.  James walks out, walks away, and tries to retire from all the killing.  Unfortunately, as he soon discovers, it isn't easy to walk out on the US Government.  Suddenly, members of the old team are being murdered, and it is up to James to stop the killer.  But, of course, there is more to the story than meets the eye.

WOLVERINE starts of with a bang and never slows down.  The action is fast-paced, butt-kicking, and fun.  While the comic book plot is a bit predictable, it is still everything that you want it to be, and more.  The locations and settings are beautiful, the stunts over the top, and the acting great and appropriate to this genre.  Hugh Jackman is WOLVERINE; he has taken this character through four movies and really made it his own.  Liev Schreiber is positively sinister as Sabretooth, radiating violence and malevolence at every turn.  As for Stryker, the leader of the super-secret government unit played by Danny Huston, you pretty much hate him, just as you are supposed to.  The rest of the cast does a fine job, and you get a glimpse of the X-Men movies to come.  Overall, the continuity from Wolverine to the X-Men films is correct and cohesive.

X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE is not a deep movie; it won't change your life.  But if you want an action-packed, well done, enjoyable flick, then go see it.  Your time and money will be well spent.",1243296000,9,2330,4.7245657568238215
3610717,3,B001GCUO16,"In Canada, in 1845, two half-brothers named Logan and Victor, go on the run after Logan kills his father.  They go on to fight in all the major wars, both being able to heal quickly and being just about indestructible.  In the 1970's, they are recruited by William Stryker (Huston) who is putting together a mysterious team.  While Victor (Schreiber) is comfortable doing the team's dirty deeds, Logan (Jackman) isn't, and breaks from the team to lead a normal life.  Eventually, Victor and Stryker come looking for Logan, so they can return him to his place in that team, but Logan won't go easily, and soon pays the price.

With the success of the ""X-Men"" movies, it was only a matter of time before Wolverine got a solo movie, this time in the form of a prequel.  In ""Wolverine"", we get his origins, as well as a look at a number of other new mutants.  We see the bond that Wolverine and Sabertooth have, and we see a glimpse of further X-Men movies to come.  Jackman is clearly comfortable in the role he has played three times before.  He does nothing special here, but he doesn't disappoint either.  Schreiber gives depth to Victor/Sabertooth that wasn't there in the first X-Men movie.  That being said, ""Wolverine"" falters due to an enormous amount of other mutants and a story where the ending is pretty much a given.  It has to get to ""point B"" to stay in continuity with the first X-Men movie, and so there is never any real doubt as to who will live between the characters we have seen before.

  You will enjoy everything about this movie if you are a fan of Wolverine; and the female fans get to see Hugh (twinkle-toes) Jackman in the buff. Liev Schreiber does a superb job playing Sabretooth - very convincing performance. We have some really good back-and-forth between Jackman and Schreiber that is one of the movie's high points. Mutant cameos by Cyclops, The White Queen, The Blob, Gambit and Professor X are a treat as well. I just wish the ending was a little better.",1242864000,,653,4.660869565217391
3610721,5,B001GCUO16,"I am a total superhero nut.  It began with Christopher Reeves as Superman (yes my age is showing) and I've been hooked ever since.

I loved every X-men movie; special effects & great actors they were awesome.  A little light on the plot and romance, but hey, they are based on comic books and cartoons, what do you expect?

X-men Origins gave me what I was longing for: the explanation of Wolverine and Sabretooth's relationship.  More importantly it gelled perfectly with the other X-men movies and you get a glimpse of some of the other X-men as youths.

I have to say this was one of Jackman's finest performances.  His ability to take his character through the stages necessary to convey Wolverines personality was masterful. Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool (the guy with the swords) was surprisingly excellent (and here I thought he was just a comedy guy).

Yes, Stryker - the bad guy - gets caught monologueing, but it was based on a comic book; you have to expect a couple of cliques.

All in all this is a movie I'm glad I saw on the big screen and one I'd watch over and over.  (and not just for Jackman's nude shot.)",1242777600,5,1120,4.5
3610722,3,B001GCUO16,"After X-Men: The Last Stand left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth, I had hoped that X-Men Origins: Wolverine would fix that. Considering that it has director Gavin Hood (Tsotsi, Rendition) at the helm and Hugh Jackman behind it one hundred percent, I had figured that a film telling Wolverine's origins wouldn't be half bad. Well, it isn't as bad as some would lead you to believe, but it definitely leaves something to be desired, especially if you're a die hard fan of X-Men comics in the least. I won't really bother going into the story of the film, since so many have already and chances are if you're reading this you already know a bit about it yourself, but I will say that the best parts about the film are definitely Jackman and Liev Schreiber. Jackman, who first played Wolverine nearly ten years ago, is still one of the best actors to ever take on a comic book character period, and Schreiber is almost equally good as his nemesis Sabretooth. Finally getting to see characters like Gambit (Friday Night Lights' Taylor Kitsch), Blob (Kevin Durand), Emma Frost (Tahyna Tozzi), and Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) on the big screen is bittersweet, considering how much their characterizations get mishandled, especially Deadpool, who by the film's end is a shadow of the ""merc with a mouth"" we all know and love, which is even more of a shame considering that having Reynolds in that role should be perfect casting. Other characters show up and disappear like Wraith (Will i Am), Silverfox (Lynn Collins), Bolt (Dominic Monaghan), and Agent Zero (Daniel Henney), while Danny Huston plays a younger Stryker and Tim Pocock plays a young Scott Summers; all of whom are thrown into the mix in a screenplay that is often confusing and non-sensical, and leads to a final fight is just plain incoherent to watch. Character's motivations change at the drop of a hat, and it almost gets to the point that Wolverine ends up playing second fiddle in his own movie. Still, there's enough here to hold your interest, including great performances from Jackman and Schreiber, and some great special effects work as well. Other than that though, I may be a little generous here with the film's rating, as it remains worth seeing for X-Men fans of all ages, but here's hoping that the next time around, we'll manage to get something that recaptures the magic that Bryan Singer managed to weave on the first two X-Men films.",1242604800,2,2409,4.738095238095238
3610723,3,B001GCUO16,"***SPOILERS***

Basically, there were a lot of consistency flaws with ""Wolverine"" and the other ""X-Men"" movies and of course the 30+ years of source material in the comics. After reading many Jackman interviews leading up to the movie's release, I was really shocked by how the movie was a lot different than he claimed it would be, in consistency and overall story. The one comment he repeated over and over and I'm paraphrasing was that he wanted the movie to be like you could watch it, then put in ""X-Men"" and it would literally make you believe that he walked right into that bar in Canada (in ""X-Men"" 1) from the ending of ""Wolverine."" That's not the way I feel after watching it.

Basically here are the inconsistencies which really detract from the movie for me as a fan:

*Wolverine's origin as a kid and his relationship with Victor Creed AKA Sabertooth--Sabertooth was Wolverine's father, not brother, in the comic. In the first ""X-Men"" they didn't elaborate or even make it apparent that Logan/Wolverine even knew Sabertooth. He was just a throwaway (literally) bad guy, with no character development in the first ""X-Men.""

*The facility where Wolverine is ""created"" is NOT the same one from ""X-Men 2."" Alkali lake--you know, where Jean Grey/Phoenix has to save the X-Men--was up in Canada and was completely different.

*Deadpool is NOTHING like he is in the comic book, except when he is ""Wade"" at the beginning. The abomination they create at the end is NOTHING like Deadpool and why is it that in these movies they always feel they need to give the final bad guy who is mysteriously created, all of the powers of everyone. Wolverine still dispatched him quite easily.

*Memory erased. COME ON, only an adamantium bullet can pierce Wolverine's skull and Stryker is so sure that he is going to hit the right parts of Wolverine's brain to erase his memory...both long term and short term...is that why he shot him 2-3 times? Come on! I think in the other movies (and know in the comics) the memory wipe was part of the whole Weapon X procedure. He escapes the Weapon X facility not knowing who or what he is.

*Silver Fox. Unnecessary love interest with Lifetime original movie channel cliched betrayal, forgiveness, then second final death. Honestly, they ruined her good early scenes with the incoherent plot of the 3rd act.

*Underwhelming action scenes. For a big summer movie I felt this movie had the least spectacular action scenes. There is one memorable one...where he is on the motorcycle and then gets on top of the military vehicle, just as it gets blown up and he flies through the air towards the helicopter. (And if you saw the trailer, you saw the best action scene already.)

*Too many underdeveloped characters. My God, this was supposed to be ""Wolverine"" not ""X-Men 4""--even Jackman was adamant that it not be thought of as that. So why have mutant team after mutant team pop up in the movie? Every character, besides, Wolverine, is so underdeveloped that you could remove them and never miss them. The one unique new character, Gambit, was so underused that it made no sense to have him in it.

*Young Cyclops and Professor X. Come on, talk about flagrant cameos that serve no purpose. If Cyclops had been in that testing facility, don't you think he would have remembered it years later when he and the X-Men return to it in ""X-Men 2""? (Marvel, if you need help with continuity, hire me.)

Enough about the bad stuff...

Hood did a good job with the good actors, getting average to good performances out of them, but with the not so good actors, he was not so lucky.

I honestly felt this was a good movie, but fell short of so much potential. 87 million US gross is not bad, but expect a huge drop-off this week due to (a) bad worth of mouth and (b) ""Star Trek"" opening. I think it might break even in the US and then make up money on DVD sales. It won't come close to the ""X-Men"" movies in gross though.

In an effort to milk the cash machine dry, studios are coming up with fairly new and elaborate methods of sustaining their tent pole franchises. A tent pole is any film that a studio expects to make a boat full of money by selling tickets, spawning sequels, selling DVDs, selling toys, etc., etc. Generally, tent poles involve superheroes and special effects and hit the multiplexes in the summer, when all of the kids are out of school. Fox hit the payload a number of years ago when they created ""X-Men"" along with Marvel Comics. Two sequels followed and now they have started a new line of films called ""X-Men Origins"". Presumably, the idea is to create a film exploring the myth and creation of each of the individual members of the X-Men. Whether this works or not (an entire film telling the story of Storm doesn't seem to hold as much interest as say an entire film telling the story of Wolverine) remains to be seen. But the first film is out and it is pretty good.

Hugh Jackman returns as Wolverine and the story begins when he is a child growing up in Canada in the mid 1800s. Logan seems like a sickly child, living with his mom and dad in a palatial home. One night, as a snowstorm rages, there is a fight and Logan stumbles downstairs to find Victor's dad fighting with his father. When Logan becomes mad, he retaliates and kills Victor's dad with his bone talons. Victor learns that he and Logan are brothers and befriends the younger boy, taking him to safety in the forest. In an interesting montage, we watch as the two brothers fight side by side in the Civil War, World War I, World War II and Vietnam. They learn early on that they are virtually indestructible and want to put that and their blood lust to some good. During the Vietnam War, Victor and Logan end up in the brig and General William Stryker (Danny Huston) shows up, ready and willing to rescue them. The General is confident they will make an excellent addition to his team or mercenaries who will carry out very different types of missions. Victor fits in with the new team just fine; Agent Zero (David Henney) is Stryker's second in command and has the ability to control guns, Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) is your average smart aleck guy along for the ride until he starts to brandish the swords strapped to his back, Bolt (Dominic Monaghan, TV's ""Lost"") can control things, machines, people's thoughts, with his mind, Fred Dukes (Kevin Durand) can take a punch and John Wraith (Will I. Am) can make himself disappear and reappear in a different place. This is Stryker's mercenary force and Victor is all about brandishing his teeth and claws and running like the Sabretooth he is into battle. But Logan has had enough of the murder and blood lust and begins to have second thoughts. Years later, Logan is now living as a lumberjack in the Canadian wilderness. Very happy, he has found the woman of his dreams, Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins). Just when Logan thought his life would be peaceful and idyllic, Sabretooth and Stryker reappear to shake things up again. This leads Logan to participate in Stryker's new experiment, and allow him to introduce a strange metal, adamantium, to his bones, making Wolverine virtually indestructible. But Stryker has ulterior motives. When Wolverine learns of this, he escapes and teams up with Wraith to find Gambit (Taylor Kitsch, TV's ""Friday Night Lights""), a New Orleans gambler who can control things moving through space. He thinks Gambit may be able to help him put an end to Stryker's experiments.

""Wolverine"" is an interesting film, and it has a lot of great action scenes, but there are problems.

I always find it interesting when a high profile, big budget film like this is directed by a filmmaker who has experience on much smaller films; the director, Gavin Hood, first became known for the Oscar nominated South African film ""Tsotsi"". It was a very good film exploring the lives and relationships of a number of people who live in the slums of South Africa. But I would be surprised if it cost $1 Million Dollars. ""Wolverine"", on the other hand, cost more than $100 Million Dollars. Like ""Pineapple Express"", a big budget comedy directed by David Gordon Green, Hood brings a unique sensibility to the material, concentrating a lot of time and story on the relationships in Wolverine's life. This helps to make the film more interesting than a lot of summer movie fare. And this type of situation happens so infrequently in big budget summer films that it warrants mention, which is a sad statement for me to make. Because of the sheer amount of dollars spent on these films, you might expect them to spend an inordinate amount of time making sure the screenplay is perfect, the characters believable, and the story suspenseful. But in many, many cases, most of the money is spent on the action and special effects leaving every other aspect of the film to flounder and flop.

Hugh Jackman became an A Lister playing Wolverine, and he continues to give his portrayal of the character everything he has. In ""Wolverine"", we see a slightly different aspect of the character. As a young man, as he fights beside Victor, we see that he is fighting to satisfy a bloodlust, he is putting this need to a good use fighting for our country in many, many wars. It is interesting to see this and fit it into the puzzle of the three ""X-Men"" films and realize this is what Professor Xavier has been trying to help Logan control for so many years.

It is also interesting to see Logan truly in love with Kayla. As he thinks he has escaped General Stryker and his team, he is truly happy trying to live a normal life with this lovely woman. They live in a little cabin in the woods. She is a teacher, he is a lumberjack. Sure, he has nightmares, but his life is good. This becomes all the more poignant when you consider his later relationship with Jane Gray.

This idyll is soon threatened. Stryker shows up with Agent Zero and warns Logan about someone killing former members of his crew. And Victor has also gone rogue. Soon Victor shows up and tears Logan's life apart. This leads Logan to seek revenge and accept an offer to participate in one of Stryker's experiments. Victor is virtually indestructible, but Stryker has a new metal compound that he wants to fuse to Logan's skeletal structure, making him all the more indestructible and deadly. And Wolverine is officially born.

Live Schreiber is very interesting as Sabretooth. Logan's brother, Victor suffers from a similar mutation in that his fingernails can become claws and he grows fangs. This, and his catlike run, make him Sabretooth. But Victor is different from Logan in that he seems to have no remorse when he kills. This makes him more ruthless, more villainous and harder to control.

Schreiber seems to have a lot of fun with the role and really sinks his teeth into the character. (Har, har!)

Danny Huston also does a good job of portraying General Stryker. Suitably villainous and mysterious, he is working on a project that provides the backbone to the film. He takes the team to Africa when he hears of the discovery of a rare metal substance. Each of the team members has a unique ability and all come into play when they try to storm the compound of an African Warlord. When the warlord realizes his men have been outnumbered and out skilled, he offers the piles of diamonds on his desk. But Stryker wants what appears to be a worthless hunk of metal. It is adamantium.

Taylor Kitsch plays Gambit, a New Orleans gambler who has the ability to control the movement of objects. He pops up late in the story but quickly becomes Wolverine's ally and helps him throughout the remainder of the film. He has a coupe of unique powers to offer and these are neat to watch.

I have a few complaints with ""Wolverine"". First, in a film labeled ""Origins"", I was sort of expecting to get at least an indication of what caused Wolverine to have this mutation. Why does he have bone claws coming through his knuckles whenever he gets mad? Why is he seemingly indestructible? I can understand why this was left vague in the ""X-Men"" films. But in a film exploring the origins of a single character, we have time to at least touch on this item. Also, since we quickly learn Victor is his brother, and has a similar mutation, I feel it becomes even more important to learn why they have this mutation.

My other complaint is that many interesting people are introduced and then simply disappear or seem underutilized. During the scenes with General Stryker, we meet all of the members of his team and see how they utilize their unique powers to help Stryker achieve his goals. When the film picks up a number of years later, we find Bolt (Monaghan) now working at a deteriorating carnival using his powers to unimpress the paying patrons. A brief throwaway line a few minutes later clues us in to the fate of Deadpool (Reynolds). Deadpool is an interesting character and I would like to have seen him in action more.

So ""Wolverine"" is fun, filled with action and shows some promise for Jackman. But it also sidelines some of the characters too quickly and doesn't give others enough time to shine.

A side note, they are already working on a ""Wolverine"" sequel and a separate film detailing the origins of Deadpool. I wonder if that film will be called ""X-Men: Origins: Wolverine: Origins: Deadpool"".",1242086400,,9393,4.660832830416415
3610725,2,B001GCUO16,"Every time I saw bits of footage from X-Men Origins: Wolverine... Before its release--I would come away feeling not all that excited...Which seemed strange since I generally liked all 3 films from the X-Men trilogy.

Given those feelings though and the whole leak thing--I was not planing to see this one in theaters...But an opportunity presented itself--and I thought ""What The Heck""...My instincts proved very much corect...

The film opens in 1845 where a young James Logan (Troye Sivan) makes 2 shocking discoveries about his family bloodline, First that he has a brother (Michael-James Olsen)--and that they both have strange mutant powers to heal at a rapid rate...

We see the mutant siblings battling side by side through two world wars and Vietnam conflict-- where they are sentenced to death for killing a commanding officer...Having obviously survived...Logan (Hugh Jackman) and his brother Victor Creed (aka Sabretooth, Liev Schreiber) then are recruited to join a top-secret government task force.

But as their targets begin to include innocent civilians, Logan 's conscience forces him to flee to the Canadian Rockies, where he builds a home with a schoolteacher Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins).

Informed by his old commanding officer William Stryker (Danny Huston) that the old team is being killed off one at a time.

Logan is devastated when Victor finds and kills Kayla.

A vengeful, Logan agrees to take part in an experiment that will fuse his bones with a powerful metal alloy called adamantium, which makes him virtually indestructible and gives him the strength needed to defeat his powerful brother. Betrayed by Stryker, Logan (now Wolverine) sets out to find Victor...

Along the way, he meets and is joined by fellow mutants like John Wraith (Will i Am) and Remy LeBeau (aka Gambit, Taylor Kitsch). Ultimately Wolverine must battle with Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds)

We know going in the end of the movie lead into the events of Bryan Singer's first X-Men flick--and while there's action aplenty here--the narrative getting there is a disjointed mess most of the time.

Director Gavin Hood, writers David Benioff and Skip Woods along with editors Nicolas De Toth and Megan Gill contributed to the ""cut and paste"" feel of things At one point--I even felt like I was watching a scene from executive producer Richard Donner's Superman--as Logan is taken in by an elderly couple who live on a farm. Not sure if that's from Wolverine mythos--if it is apologies--if not then it just felt like another excuse to see more of Jackman's physique then we need to.

Mutants are introduced and then quickly dealt out of play--So that we can see the next action set piece.

Jackman saves himself by just being Wolverine--I thought Huston was gteat as Stryker. Schreiber as Victor/Sabretooth was OK but I wanted to see how he becomes Tyler Mane's Sabertooth from X1

There is one nice surprise near the end of the movie but by then...A sequel is already being planned as well as a spin-off for Deadpool....Better luck next time.",1241913600,4,3037,5.037924151696607
3610726,4,B001GCUO16,"I didn't expect much from the Wolverine movie.  Billed as X-Men 4 by the movie theater (says so right on my ticket), it is anything but.  This is Wolverine getting the full Weapon X treatment, a mystery that took forever in comic-land to finally reveal. And with a few exceptions, Wolverine gets it right.

Whereas the previous X-Men movies became increasingly complex, with jumbled storylines and too many characters, a single character sharpens Wolverine's plot to a knife's edge. Nigh immortal and capable of regenerating from the most grievous wounds, Wolverine and his brother Sabretooth slash their way through the century, engaging in every major war and some minor ones too. For a little while, that's enough, until Sabretooth's propensity for raping and pillaging gets out of hand. A firing squad doesn't do the job (that whole immortal thing), which is when General Stryker offers a devil's deal.

There's nothing new here with the exception of the movie's primary x-factor: Wolverine.  Jackman transforms Wolverine from a passive loner to an outraged spirit of vengeance as everyone he loves dies. And behind it all, pulling the puppet strings, is Stryker, channeling Hannibal from the A-Team.

Throughout his adventures, Wolverine is surrounded by a cadre of other mutants with their own abilities. Unlike the other X-Men movies, each mutant serves a very specific purpose.  Nothing feels forced.  Except for maybe the Blob, but he's amusing enough in early and later incarnations to provide some much needed levity that borders on the game Super Punchout.

The real revelation here is Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool. Reynolds did a great job as a sword wielding antihero in the last Blade movie and he's largely the same wisecracking nut job here.  Only he's much cooler and plays a larger role (think Darth Maul without the makeup).

There are some odd points where the Wolverine movie isn't sure where to go.  Stryker, for all his duplicity, often seems content to pull the movie villain mistake of letting people just walk out of his grasp.  Some twists are emphasized with a theatrical exclamation point as the character tells us in no uncertain terms exactly what their plans are. And a few feats of derring-do border on the ludicrous...

But then I remember this is a movie about a comic about a guy who has metal claws between his knuckles. If you can keep that perspective, Wolverine is a lot like the titular character's signature move: it tears through crowded plot lines with deadly efficiency. And if you're a fan of other members of the Weapon X program, stay to the end of the credits. You can thank me later.",1241913600,5,2631,4.936507936507937

3610730,3,B001GCUO16,"Didn't have big expectation for the X-men spin off at all. Don't take me wrongly, I love X-men but the thing is most of the time prequels and spin offs really came together badly. So when I heard that Fox is cashing in on Wolvie with Hugh Jackman, my heart sank and tanked.

The movie told us where Wolverine came from and how things led up to the first X-men movie. It is a pretty big parameter to deal with. The movie did come along nicely - nicely means no major disappointment. If you love Wolverine and Hugh, you will be able to sit through the two hours without a problem. The major issue with the movie is the story of Wolverine in the comics was so rich and yet the movie story itself was so thin. The back-story changed here and there and was sprinkled with lots of actions. There is no problem with the actions because Wolverine is all about actions, but then the story failed to back it up with a strong line.  Major scripting flaws included if Wolverine could track down Sabertooth miles away with his super senses, how could he not sense the existence of his girlfriend when he first arrived the lab? That is something beyond comprehension. Also how could he not sense the presence of Zero just up the hill too?

In order to tell the audience that it is an X-men movie, there are other few well recognised icons in the movie - Scott Summers (aka Cyclops), Gambit, Blob, Deadpool are all in there. But then because it is a Wolverine movie, they are more like cameos,  and not even supporting characters, which is a pity cos some of them have so much potential. The lack of real interactions of these characters with Wolverine failed to enrich the story further.

Hugh Jackman is great as Wolverine as always but then how many more time can we see him playing the same character again and again? Wolverine as a character is an outstanding character when you see how different he is compared to other X-men, but Fox and Seed Productions failed to capitalise on this very important aspect. Gambit is very cool although I think a lot of Gambit fans would want to see more of him.

In terms of production values, there are some awkward moments in the movie that you wonder how could they spent so much money and yet failed to check their cgi's before releasing it. The most notable scenes are the farmhouse bathroom scene and the Professor X scene, which is so obvious that they were incomplete or over-polished. I think that is something quite unforgivable when it comes to a Sci-Fi / X-men movie.

All in all, X-men Origins: Wolverine is an enjoyable movie without dull moments. However, how much more can Fox and Marvel bank in on this character will depend on how they approach this character in the future. They wouldn't want to kill the character like Warner Brothers did with Batman or it will go down the history as a joke. The movie is full of actions and great fighting, but it does need a stronger and richer story with stronger and richer characters to support it.",1241654400,,2983,4.482504604051566
3610731,3,B001GCUO16,"I came out of this one feeling pretty much flat. One issue I had was that the recitative in the beginning is somewhat rushed. If the intent was for the audience to feel a connection between Logan and Victor then the connection just didn't happen for me. Nor did the love story evoke much of a reaction for me. By the time Logan is standing over the body of his ol' lady, my feelings were neutral. And since these two elements inspire Logan's motivation for the rest of the movie, I had an equally vapid reaction as he went about bulldozing his way for some kind of closure.

As far as popcorn movies go, this one was alright. These days I consider that to be another mark in the win column for film going. Considering the rarity of memorable movies, and the abundance of awful one's that I fight to put out of my mind; I consider myself unscathed by a quickly digestible and forgettable flick.",1241568000,,893,4.379518072289157
3610732,3,B001GCUO16,"Well, I thought I might, but as the credits rolled on the first official summer film of '09, I realized I really didn't.  The way the origin was set up or rather alluded to in the previous X-Men installments was far more interesting then this film's blow by blow of the specific events that created the Logan we all know and love.  Sure, I used to read X-Men comics as a middle schooler so I already knew how Wolverine became Wolverine, but I never realized how much  the mystery of Wolverine was more entertaining without the details until I saw this film.

No plot synopsis...there's not much plot to this film anyway.

The plot to this current Marvel film is very small and uninspired.  The majority of the film is made up of the relationships or rather the meloncholy melodrama Wolverine has with his half brother, his wife, and General Stryker.  The plot doesn't kick in until about the forty minute mark.  Honestly, once the plot wheels get greased and rolling the film becomes less and less involving.  Even the action sequences were ho-hum.  Which is surprising, because so much dark conflict is built into them they should have severe impact similar to that of The Dark Knight, but they just ring hollow and routine.  I really, for the life of me, can't pull a single memorable image from any of the pyrotechnics involved in this film's story.  Considering that where the majority of the budget goes on these films, that's not a good thing.

The acting is all fine.  Liev Shrieber brings an adequetely menacing presence as Wolverine's half brother Victor.  How we're supposed to believe that this well-spoken and sadistic maniac turns into the lumbering oaf that was Sabertooth in X-Men part one maybe the next film's major mystery.  Ryan Reynolds shows up briefly to play the character of Wade.  It's so brief that when he(or rather a stuntman under heavy prosthetics) returns in the finale you have to take a few seconds to realise it's him, or at least listen very closely to some dubbed dialogue to further drive the point home.  Which is another problem.  The whole film sets up this major conflict between Logan and Victor and then drops it in favor of a mega showdown with Deadpool.  A character whose creation is rushed into the narrative at the last hour, and holds no emotional ties to Wolverine and ends up being a big, but hollow, special effects light show.  Bummer.  With all the pathos this film contains the ending really could've sealed the deal for this film.

Marvel now oversees the productions of all its characters' film adaptions.  Sometimes this is a good thing(Iron-Man), sometimes not so much(The Incredible Hulk).  Did we really need to be introduced to Deadpool, Gambit and Cyclops in this film?  Nope!  Sure, the fanboys had joygasms in unisen when they showed up, but the rest of us who put their comics away years ago, got nothing out of it but a slight crinkle in the upper left side of the cheek.  The actor who plays Gambi, can't think of his name, does an admirable job of hinting at the type of character he may be or become in future installments.  Nothing outrageously speical, but that has more to do with the writing and less to do with the acting.  He's adequetly charming for the part.  We also get some scraps in the form of other Marvel characters, none of us average Joes give a crap about like The Blob, The Wraith and Silverfox and others....

Hugh Jackman was born to play this role.  Yes, fanboys will go on and on about how he's too tall and not squat like a wolverine(lol), but he embodies the pathos and physicality and strength of character I remember from my comic years.  I want more Jackman Wolverine but I want a better written film to go with it.

The bottom line is, the film is passable or better yet servicable fluff fair.  You won't remember much about it after its over and it's about equal to the first X-Men film, but not quite up to par with the second or third film, or other Marvel Universe films released.  It's a good companion piece with Ghost Rider and The Incredible Hulk, good enough but nothing special.

PS: Is anyone else out there sad that the first major films of the summer are sequels(Terminator:Salvation), re-boots AKA remakes(Star Trek) and spin-offs(Wolverine)?  It's starting to depress me.  I've heard great things about the upcoming Terminator and Star Trek and hopefully I'll like them, but damn, could we get something original in the E.R. stat!?!?!?!?",1241568000,,4451,4.678249678249678
3610733,5,B001GCUO16,"Like most people, my favorite X-Man was Wolverine. The guy doesn't know how he got his claws, can heal superfast, and he can cut people up with a little bit of Tarrantino's edge. For example: The jump lunge at the mansion, 2 soldier stab, and 2 soldier throw over shoulders, and retracting claws when lowering arms in X2. I don't know if I could understand Logan's whole story if I asked Stan Lee himself.

As for the movie: I like it. I went to see it opening day at high noon and I was very pleased. I liked how they introduced Jimmy Logan as a feverish child and then a soldier in so many battles. I'm not gonna spoil anything but I was surprised a tiny bit as to how Logan lost his memory. And one more thing, don't leave when the credits start.

This movie is a perfect example of how far Fox has fallen as a studio, and how out of touch they are with people who like good movies.

3610736,4,B001GCUO16,"Seeking to further capitalize on the popularity of Marvel's favorite mutant group, ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" is a prequel of sorts to the X-men trilogy. I'll get right to the point, if you thought Bret Rattner's ""X-Men Last Stand"" was a mockery of the franchise, then ""Wolverine"" provides some redemption. This latest spin-off won't exactly offer anything groundbreaking but it is an improvement over Rattner's version. Director Gavin Hood`s (King Solomon`s Mines, 2004) ""Wolverine"" is just popcorn entertainment that combines the usual Hollywood fare with some comic book references.

Logan was born in the 19th century. He was in puberty when his mutant powers began to manifest itself and his life had a tragic twist when his father died. Being endowed with a fantastic healing factor that slows his aging, Logan (now played by Hugh Jackman) and his companion Victor Creed (Liev Schreider) fought many wars for many decades. After being recruited by a sleeper group led by colonel Stryker (Danny Huston) for an unknown mission. Differences caused Logan to abandon his post and he finds a simple but quiet life with a beautiful woman named Kayla  Silverfox (sexy Lynn Collins). But Logan's past have caught up to him that resulted with his beautiful girlfriend being killed by Creed (who would later become Sabretooth). Logan is thristy for vengeance as he agrees to be part of a ""weapon X"" program that would further enhance his mutant powers.

The screenplay by David Beniott and Skip Woods combines the usual Hollywood mechanics such as revenge, love and betrayal to references from the comic book. The film carries some strong ties to ""Origin"", ""Weapon X"" and even issues from the X-men comic series. The film has its share of ""iconic"" comic book scenes. However, the film doesn't have any blood or gore as portrayed in ""Weapon X"". Familiar characters are a welcome treat to comic book fans as we see Gambit (Taylor Kitsch), Deadpool (?) (shortly played by Ryan Reynolds) and William Stryker. Those who are ""X-men veteran readers"" would recognize Emma Frost, the Blob, Cyclops and the appearance of Logan's lost love Silverfox; these references are indeed a good part of our favorite ""canucklehead`s"" life. ""Weapon 11"" and Xavier also makes an appearance. I was a little disappointed that the film didn't touch on Logan's time in Japan, but I suppose that if it did, it would slow the film's pace too much. The film also touches upon the element of friendship as brought into exposition by Creed and Logan's relationship. Creed loses a part of his humanity with each kill, and Logan tries to hold on any remaining sense of humanity. Creed embraces this fate he believes is his destiny while Logan only wants to stay within his brand of morality.

The direction by Gavin Hood was decently played and does feel energetic. Hood manages to keep the film's pace very compressed and full of forward momentum in its 90+ minute runtime. While the film is undoubtedly crippled by certain blunders and some holes, Hood manages to keep the film moving that viewers will take notice of its entertainment value much more than its very simple plot. Th appearance of its characters does pay some welcome ""tribute"" to the comic books but most of them did feel absolutely unnecessary than to be a simple comic book eye candy since there are too many to develop. Director Gavin Hood revitalizes the screen with elaborate stuntwork, cool fight sequences, great CGI effects, and a lot of explosions--all in an attempt to cover up its very weak plot. The performances were decent for the most part, although I thought Stryker made for a somewhat underwhelming villain. Danny Huston was good but not entirely convincing. Liev Schneider made a good ""Victor Creed"" and his chemistry with Jackman was pretty palatable. Jackman well, is Jackman, he looks and feels the same as in the X-men movies.

We will see Hugh Jackman all pumped up and oiled up to emphasize his nice physique, complete with ""macho"" posturing and facial expressions that look very reminiscent to the renderings of Jim Lee and John Byrne in the X-men comic series. Jackman does deliver as our favorite ""canucklehead"" although we have to take note than Logan should be a lot shorter, hairier and stockier than the actor. There is plenty of action scenes to be had with ""Wolverine"". The encounters with Agent Zero's group as Logan slices through a helicopter and Humvees are very cool to watch. The final encounter with Logan and Creed could've been a lot better and I thought it ended in a very perfunctory manner. The brawl on top of reactor was the exact exclamation point that Hood was looking for and he does somewhat achieve his goal.

I suppose ""X-men Origins: Wolverine"" does provide a credible backstory (considering Bryan Singer's groundwork) to our favorite mutant. Keep in mind that this is your usual Hollywood serving, beautifying up the film, and stays safe to be within the guidelines of PG-13. It does try to stay faithful to its source material but it does have its weaknesses. The action proves to be a good diversion and would likely impress action junkies. As a film, it does not offer anything memorable, but at least its wasn't too much of a travesty as ""..Last Stand"" was. Yes, it is better than Rattner's take of the X-men franchise but won't approach the status of becoming an instant ""comic book adapted classic"". ""Wolverine"" won't reinvent the X-men franchise but thankfully it doesn't hurt it either.

3610737,3,B001GCUO16,"After three movies of amnesia and claw-slashing, Wolverine is actually getting his own movie, all for his own. Sure, some familiar characters appear, but the stage is for him alone.

And it's neither a horrendous movie nor a good one -- just a popcorn collection of explosions and Matrixian fight scenes, linked together by a rather loosely-strung plot that doesn't have any twists or unexpected events. Hugh Jackman does a simply stellar job as the beclawed titular character and it has some funny moments, but the part of the movie that galvanized me the most was the trailer for ""District 9.""

After a century of fighting, James Logan (Jackman) and his savage half-brother Victor (Liev Schreiber) are recruited by a mysterious army officer, William Stryker (Danny Huston), to join his elite mutant squad. Logan is sick of killing, so he tries to have the quiet life with his girlfriend Kayla (Lynn Collins) as a humble logger... until Victor reappears and murders Kayla, as part of a vendetta against his old teammates. Intent on revenge, Logan accepts the offer Stryker gives him -- he will accept a horrible and painful procedure that will make him invincible, so he can kill Victor.

With an adamantium skeleton and an instantly-healing body, the newly-renamed Wolverine is invincible -- but he soon finds himself on the run not only from his older brother, but from Stryker's ruthless military forces. Now he must uncover a mysterious ""island"" that only one mutant has ever escaped from... except there are some other nasty surprises waiting for him there, courtesy of Stryker's experiments.

By all rights, ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" should have been a far better movie than it is. But the story itself is only so-so -- it's rather straightforward in its narrative without many twists, and the Sabretooth/Wolverine backstory is handled pretty confusingly. It's only in the last quarter that the movie really acquires that epic comic-book feeling -- up until then, it's a rather bland you-killed-my-master/relative/truelove-REVENGE! tale.

So with a bland plot, they slather on the action -- it feels like at least 75% of the movie was written to allow maximum explosions, motorcycle chases, Matrixian wire-fu, and endless claw fights. In fact, the movie is at its best when it has either some really tightly-wound fight scenes (such as the boxing match with The Blob), or a sense of humour (Wolverine accidentally destroys a nice little elderly couple's bathroom, and walks out repentantly holding their sink).

And then there's Wolverine himself -- he can heal from anything, and his metal skeleton means he can't even be chopped up. In other words, he's indestructible. It's really hard to worry about the guy physically, and ""Origins"" never gets around to making us fear that he'll lose anything else.

So it's a credit to Jackman's talent that he actually makes us care about Wolverine -- roaring, confused, grief-stricken, and slowly being hardened by all the betrayals and lies. And Schreiber does an excellent job as well, especially considering that Sabretooth is as likable as an ingrown nail -- he actually almost makes us feel sorry for his character now and then. Too bad we never, uh, really figure out why he wants to kill his brother.

And there's a lot of great lesser roles as well -- Collins does a decent job considering her total lack of chemistry with Jackman, while the coldly contemptuous Daniel Henney, kindly will.i.am, charming gambler Kitsch and puckish Dominic Monaghan all do great jobs with their smaller-scale roles. Huston is okay, but he never quite seems scary or fanatical enough.

""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" has enough explosions, stunts and elaborate aerial fight scenes to shame most blockbusters, but it's lacking heart and plot. The only thing that makes it worth watching: the actors.",1241308800,7,3833,5.090764331210191
3610738,5,B001GCUO16,"""X-Men Origins: Wolverine""
(20th Century Fox, 2009)
----------------------------------------
I've seen lot of reviews complaining that this movie was all special effects and too little plot.  Personally, that's just fine with me. I think the biggest problem with most superhero blockbusters (to date, with the exception of ""Iron Man"") is that they have too much plot, and not enough action. Film after dreadful film has come out, each one more top-heavy and pretentious than the other, and as someone who has been reading DC and Marvel comics since 1971, I've just gritted my teeth and waited for them to get all that blah-blah-blah stuff out of their system and start making movies that are as fast-moving and fun as the comics themselves.

""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" is a big step in the right direction. It's action-packed, thrilling and mercifully light on leaden exposition: there's not a lot of time wasted explaining every little thing or trying to (verbally) impress us with the holy-cow awesome awesomeness of what we are about to witness. Show, don't tell. That works a lot better.

Yes, there are inconsistencies and quirks (Wolverine's heightened sense of smell, for example, seems to desert him at several key moments) and yes, at times there are things that could be better explained (Gambit's powers, for example.) The biggest problem is that the main bad guy, Col. Stryker, is pretty boring and gets old quick, but this is balanced by a great performance by Liev Schreiber, who is consistently creepy and menacing as Wolverine's nemesis, Sabretooth. Also, the script -- in what has become a Hollywood traditional -- needlessly muddies up the original continuity from the comicbooks. But, whatever. It's just a superhero movie.

Mostly, these are just quibbles. This film zooms nicely along and has far more action in it than any superhero movie to date, which is a good thing. Although it's exhausting to watch, it's also exciting, and frankly, I think that's what fans want, not some lame attempt to turn dopey kid's stuff into high art. Finally! Bring on the mayhem!

Nerd-fan postscript: Since this film is set in the past and doesn't immediately link Wolverine to the present-day X-Men team, I'd totally be up for a non-X Men sequel that has Wolvie becoming a SHIELD super-spy or learning all his ninja tricks, or whatever. Hugh Jackman is perfect for the part: he looks right and he's really starting to capture the character. I say, strike while the adamantium is hot, and bang out a couple more of these puppies.

3610739,5,B001GCUO16,"Not every movie can have the special effects of a Dark Knight type of production. If this movie did, it would never clear the three hundred million dollar hurdle just to break even.

I came to this movie with very low expectations since Wolverine never fascinated me as much as some other Marvel characters but was surprised by how entertained I was.

Wolverine was a much more likable character than I remember him being in previous appearances. The sibling relationship between the two clawed mutants in this movie created an interesting tension in the story line. The action was great and the movie had some very moving and very humorous moments in it. The extra Marvel characters who were thrown in such as the Blob and Gambit were very good contributions to the story and the movie.

I enjoyed this one more than the latest Marvel Hulk movie and almost as much as the Iron Man movie. This one is definitely worth seeing.",1241308800,8,925,4.662576687116564
3610740,3,B001GCUO16,"The movie is definitely worth seeing. But if you have ever read the X-Men and Wolverine comics, you may be slightly disappointed from the story that is told in this movie. X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a very huge departure from the origin story in the comic books. I'm not sure why the directors and writers decided to go route that they went, but I guess they had to do something for the people who don't read comic books I presume. Someone they manager to stitch some of the greatest moments of Wolverine's comic book story into a movie. The jury is out on if they threw this buffet of clips from the comics books together in a good way or not. I may need to check this movie out again. Someone they managed to even mess up the origins of other mutants that appeared in the film like Agent Zero, Deadpool, Cyclops, and Gambit. The most surprising stunner of them all is that Mangeto didn't make his way into this flick too, which I applaud them for. This very well may be the end of Wolverine on the big screen, but at least he went out with a bang, two bangs to the head to be precise.",1241222400,,1087,4.256038647342995
3610741,4,B001GCUO16,"There is a certain kind of potential viewer for this movie that simply shouldn't: the comic book or fantasy fundamentalist. The most extreme example are those silly people who wouldn't see LORD OF THE RINGS because of the removal of Tom Bombadil or WATCHMEN because there was no squid (though in the case of the latter the fact that it was one of the least cinema films ever made is more to the point). WOLVERINE or as it is officially known X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE engages in a great deal of revisionism. Comic fans (of which I count myself) need to chill out. We've seen so many revisions of various comic characters and there are so many incompatibilities between various incarnations that if they do the same thing in the movies, how can we sanely complain? We can have debates about whether the changes are any good, but that things have changed from various versions in the comics is absolutely not a legitimate criticism. WATCHMEN proved that for all time. No film has been so slavishly faithful to a source before, and no film has ever suffered so much as a result.

Frankly, this isn't a bad movie. Neither is it a great one. I can name a long string of superhero movies that are better. Heck, I can name four in 2008 that were infinitely better: IRON MAN, HELL BOY II, HULK, and THE DARK KNIGHT (and I rank them in that order), and we are likely to see better Marvel Studios films in the future. But that doesn't mean that this is bad. Did I like every change? Nope. I was especially bothered by the apparent nerfing of Emma Frost, seemingly eliminating her very powerful psychic powers and emphasizing exclusively her secondary mutation of turning into diamond (which is interesting primarily because when she is in that form she loses her emotions and abilities, hence her sometimes nickname The Ice Queen). But overwhelmingly, Emma Frost is psychic, and that is rather too large of a thing in my opinion to leave out. (Though I did find it interesting that in multiple shots they paired Emma Frost and Scott Sommers. Foreshadowing? In the most recent reimaginings of the X-Men Emma and Scott have enjoyed an extremely complex relationship before Jean Grey's death; after her death they are a full-fledged couple.) But I found the creation of a much, much deeper background between Logan and his traditional nemesis Sabertooth to be a lot of fun and fairly compelling.

Another group of comic book fundamentalists are going to be upset because the timeline doesn't work, especially with the timeline of the three X-Men movies. But I agree with Emerson that a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. And of course there is the complication that we had a completely different Sabertooth in the first X-Men film. But none of this really bothers me. Liev Schreiber is just outstanding as Victor/Sabertooth. He has for many years been one of the least utilized great actors in Hollywood and hopefully after this he will be in more high profile films.

The one person I was most interested in seeing in this was Taylor Kitsch, who plays Gambit. A lot of newspapers and magazines and critics, whenever lists are make of ""upcoming stars,"" Kitsch persistently makes an appearance. He has been one of the most exciting young actors on television as Tim Riggins on FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, where he not only has displayed lots of acting ability, but has put on display physical charms that make three of my closest female friends declare that he is the most attractive male in the world. But for those who are not watchers of FNL, this could be their introduction to Kitsch. And I have to say that he manages to put on display as Gambit a lot of the same charm that he flashes on FNL. That is one consistent element in Gambit in all of his X-Men appearances, a roguish charm. and Taylor Kitsch has that in spades (no pun intended, given Gambit's skill at cards). It has been interesting seeing how they handle various X-Men in the movies. Some are almost impossibly nerfed, most horribly Rogue, who went from being one of the most dominant X-Men to being one of the lamest, with them stripping her of just about all of her powers. I mentioned above Emma Frost having her greater powers removed. But the strange thing with Gambit is that he is made, if anything, more powerful than usual. My greatest disappointment was, however, with one of the most powerful of all the Marvel Universe entities, Weapon XI, Deadpool. As presented he was simply not very interesting.

All in all, however, I found this pretty entertaining. It won't go down as one of the greatest superhero movies. I did enjoy it as much as the three X-Men movies. I think in all four Hugh Jackman has been excellent as Wolverine. The really odd thing about that is that he is utterly wrong for the role. He pulls the hair and facial expressions off, but like Peter O'Toole in LAWRENCE OF ARABIA (where the 6'3 O'Toole played the 5'3 T. E. Lawrence), he is far too tall for the role. In the official Marvel description, Logan is 5'3. He is supposed to be stocky and squat and thick, like a wolverine. Still, apart from that he has made this role his own. Unless you are a comic book fundamentalist, you should find plenty in this film to enjoy.",1241222400,3,5221,4.647186147186147
3610742,2,B001GCUO16,I went into this movie knowing that it would have some slight differences from the comic book story. But I didn't expect 90 percent of the movie to be different!!! I was extremely disappointed with this movie. Not only was the story warped but they also warped the powers and capabilities of certain characters. The special effects and the fight scenes were on point but the story line blew it for me. If you are a avid comic book fan like me you will not like this movie. If you don't know any better you will probably love it.,1241222400,5,528,4.343434343434343
3610743,3,B001GCUO16,"""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" was a disappointing film for several reasons, mostly because it broke the cardinal rule of superhero films: have a villain that's just as interesting as the hero. Sabertooth was never shown to be the truly evil monster that he is (there was a surprising lack of violence in this film). Wolverine himself is never shown being a true bad@$$ either--Logan had more exciting action scenes in ""X2"" than he did in his own movie! Also the third act of the film is fairly anticlimactic and rather than the ultimate Wolverine vs. Sabertooth battle fans have been waiting for, we get Victor & Jimmy battling a totally new character, which while this guy has some cool powers the battle with him lacks any emotional weight at all.

The film was not without its highlights though. The all too brief encounter with Gambit was (aside from some ridiculous wire-fu moments) perfect. The origin of the ""Blob's"" name was a surprisingly good scene, Sabertooth vs. Wraith and Wade/Deadpool vs. a room full of bad guys with guns was also pretty spectacular. Fans of the comics and X-films also get a few more cool little moments sprinkled out through the film that I won't spoil here.

The bottom line is this film definitely has flashes of brilliance that are too short and too brief to keep ""Wolverine"" from being the weakest and most disappointing addition yet to the X-Men film franchise.",1241222400,5,1398,4.820833333333334
3610744,4,B001GCUO16,"Entering the theater today I was expecting the worst after reading many negative reviews, but I have to say that X-Men Origins: Wolverine was pure popcorn entertainment. I know it's not in the same league as the second X-Men film or in the same galaxy as something like The Dark Knight, but I really liked some of the characters and action scenes. The CGI is pretty good for the most part, though for some reason Wolverine's claws looked terrible when he is inspecting the new metal for the first time in the bathroom. Hugh Jackman could play this character in his sleep, but thankfully he put a lot into the role yet again (dude must lift some serious weights). I also thought Liev Schreiber made a fantastic Sabertooth. He doesn't overact the part and manages to inject the right amount of menace. Sadly, fan favorites like Deadpool and Gambit (been waiting for him to enter the mix since the first X-Men movie) aren't given much to do and amount to little screen time. The story itself wasn't as bad as I feared and it moved at a good pace, while leaving room for some quieter moments early on.

I enjoyed Watchmen when it came out of couple of months ago and I understand why some didn't. This flick is like the anti-Watchmen. Its sole purpose is to provide the goods for everyone and not trying to be anything special. I'm sure Star Trek, Terminator: Salvation and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen will all overshadow this one, but I must admit that Wolverine isn't a bad way to start off the summer movie season.

3610745,3,B001GCUO16,"Of the comic book characters I'm familiar with, which really isn't that many, I can't think of anyone I'd like to be less than Wolverine. What a depressing character, a man well over 100 years old who at one point or another loses everything he holds dear. He has no real home, no real friends, and no real family (with one exception, but we'll get into that later). Worse yet, he's a mutant, with retractable blades that emerge from his knuckles and the ability to regenerate damaged skin. Because of this, he's relentlessly pursued by the government, who, naturally, want to capture him and perform all sorts of nasty experiments. They succeed in one regard; he's injected with a special metal from outer space that makes his bones unbreakable. So not only is an outsider, he's also forced to live with being at outsider seemingly for all time. Compared to Wolverine, being Bruce Wayne is downright fun, especially with all that money at his disposal.

As the title suggests, ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" takes place before the events of the first three ""X-Men"" films and documents the history of the title character. It does a decent job explaining how he became so indestructible and why he's so miserable, but it fails to explain how he (or anyone else, for that matter) was born a mutant in the first place. Nor does it explain how he stopped aging or when it might have happened. Honestly, I had no idea Wolverine was such an old man. He discovered he was a mutant in 1845 when he was only a boy named James Logan, an event that coincided with the untimely death of his father. It also marked the start of a rivalry between him and his half-brother, Victor, who has fangs and claws and can run on all fours. As the years pass, we see them grow into primal warriors who were a part of many major wars, including the Civil War, both World Wars, and Vietnam. It's during the latter war that the story proper begins.

After surviving a firing squad, Logan (Hugh Jackman) and Victor (Liev Schreiber) are approached by William Stryker (Danny Huston) and offered a chance to be part of a mutant military squad. The other members of the group: John Wraith/Kestrel (will.i.am), who can transport himself from one place to another in the blink of an eye; Chris Bradley/Bolt (Dominic Monaghan), who can manipulate electrically operated objects with his mind; Fred Dukes (Kevin Durand), who will eventually gain a lot of weight and become The Blob; David North/Agent Zero (Daniel Henney), who's lethal with a gun in each hand; and Wade Wilson/Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), a martial arts expert who can't seem to shut up, especially when it begins annoying everyone else. There comes a point where Logan has had enough of Stryker and decides to turn his back on the squad. This doesn't please Victor, who feels that brothers should stick together no matter what.

Six years later, Logan's quiet life as a lumberjack is brutally interrupted when he learns that the squad members are being murdered one by one. This reunites him with Victor, who now goes by the name Sabretooth and is hell bent on punishing Logan. After a series of unpleasant encounters and unfortunate losses, Logan turns to Stryker, who takes him to a secret laboratory and oversees a complete molecular refit of his body. This includes a new set of stainless steel knives to replace the bony protrusions he was born with. It also includes a name change from Logan to Wolverine. Basically, he has unleashed the animal that was always lurking somewhere within, abandoning any notion of restraint and compassion.

And that's pretty much where the story becomes a prolonged seek-and-destroy mission, which can only go so far before it stops being entertaining. You'd think that characters like Remy LeBeau/Gambit (Taylor Kitsch) or Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins) would help enliven the film, but they don't. They are important characters, yet they aren't given the chance to contribute much to the story.

To be fair, this movie will give action lovers and comic book fans everything they've been expecting. Just wait until the unveiling of Weapon XI, a strange looking mutant with a number of impressive superpowers. There's also a fun shot of Wolverine flying over a helicopter in slow motion, which happens just after being ejected from a fast-moving motorcycle.

But spectacle comes easy in a film based on a comic book. What I really wanted was a more substantive story, something that could make the Wolverine character seem like more than an angry, brooding victim. I also would have appreciated a bit more insight as to how and why specific things came to be, mutants most of all. Regardless, I'm sure ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" will be a great financial success, appealing to those who want nothing more from their superhero movies than cool stunts and eye-popping visual effects. There's also a fair amount of humor, which is good because it saves the film from becoming an action-packed melodrama. Much of the audience's laughter was reserved for a brief boxing match between Wolverine and The Blob, whose proportions make him look more like a living beach ball. I didn't laugh quite as hard as everyone else, but in my defense, I was still thinking about all the bad things that happened earlier in the story.",1241136000,4,5275,4.842572062084257
