8512626,3,B00798MAWM,"If you have to explain a joke, it's not a good joke. If you have to tell your audience what the movie is about, it's not a good movie.

Here's the scoop. Harvey is a little person. He's a janitor in a small, Canadian ski resort. He lives in a trailer and life isn't pleasant. One day he's befriended by a stray dog. This, in turn, leads to a friendship/romance with a local stripper. So now Harvey is in foreign territory and isn't handling things well.

This all starts out well enough. Harvey is actually kind of an interesting guy. He has a couple of movie cameras and shoots a lot of film of people in, or passing through, the town. He doesn't kid himself about his prospects as a little person in a small, bust-out Canadian hamlet. So, through the dog, and the stripper, the viewer gets a glimmer of hope for him. We root for him and want to see him realize whatever dreams he might have. But, in the third act, writer/director Jeff Kopas starts to explain, through dialogue, what he's getting at. He also takes a cheap shot at the audience with a sleit of hand ploy involving the dog. This pretty much ruined a lot of the good stuff that came before.

This is an okay watch. Very small indy stuff. A lot of natural lighting and sets. Hand-held camera and some good indy type tunes. Problem with the music was some of the songs seemed to be inserted in the wrong scenes. They just didn't fit. The acting is uneven but good enough. This is Kopas' first feature length film. I hope he views it over and over to avoid some of these mistakes next time out.",1381104000,,1557,4.30716723549488
