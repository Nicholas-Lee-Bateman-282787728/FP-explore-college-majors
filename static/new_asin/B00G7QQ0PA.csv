8621296,4,B00G7QQ0PA,Great movie.  I had never seen or heard of it before  but it was mentioned under another oldie I was watching on You Tube.  Well acted and directed.  Clever story line similar in nature to Back to the Future.  Old grainy photography but well worth that minor inconvenience.,1453248000,2,273,4.604166666666667

8621298,3,B00G7QQ0PA,"Turn Back the Clock is a 1933 fantasy-comedy-drama from MGM starring Mae Clarke and Lee Tracey.

Lee Tracey (1898-1968) is best known for his Oscar and Golden Globe nominated performance in The Best Man (1964). Between 1929 and 1965 he appeared in dozens of films, usually as the comic sidekick in films like Dinner at Eight (1933), The Lemon Drop Kid (1934), and Crashing Hollywood (1938). Tracey plays a man who gets to see how his life might have been if he had money (think  Its a Wonderful Life from 1946)

Mae Clarke (1910-1992) plays Traceys wife. She will forever be known as the blond moll who got a grapefruit smashed into her face by Jimmy Cagney in Public Enemy (1931), but she made over 100 films and gave us many memorable roles, such as Dr. Frankensteins wife in the original Frankenstein (1931) and Myra Deauville in Waterloo Bridge (1931). This is a small part but she makes the best of it, and she is very different from what you expect.

Suave Otto Kruger (1885-1974) plays a banker. Kruger was in more than 50 films, probably most memorable as the Judge from High Noon (1952).

Look for the Three Stooges in an uncredited role as wedding singers. This was their first film after breaking free from their long time work with Ted Healy.

The NY Times said Mr. Tracy's portrayal is eloquent. Mae Clark is pleasing as Mrs. Gimlet and Otto Kruger does well as Ted Wright

1933 was a good year for films. Box office hits were Mae Wests  Im no Angel and She Done Him Wrong, the star studded Dinner at Eight, Roby Keeler and Dick Powell in 42nd Street,  King Kong, and Garbo in Queen Christina. The Oscar winners were The Private Life of Henry VIII (Actor), Morning Glory (Actress) and Cavalcade (Picture). Other notable films released that year included the Marx Brothers Duck Soup, Laurel and Hardys classic Sons of the Desert, and The Invisible Man. Fred  Astaire and Ginger Rogers made their film duo debut in Flying Down to Rio. FWIW  1933 was the year that Walt Disney referred to the gold statue as an Oscar when he won it for The Three Little Pigs.

All things considered this is a pretty forgettable film. Tracey is not his usual fast talking self, and Clarke plays a weary housewife. There are some interesting script gimmicks, and a few laughs, but its no Wonderful Life.",1440028800,3,2294,4.595588235294118
