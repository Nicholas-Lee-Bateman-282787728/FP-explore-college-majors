8144506,5,B000I8OM8K,Amusing Spanish language Mexican comedy-horror film.  Chock full of Mexican comedic actors.  A group of heirs to a fortune have to stay at a mansion in order to inherit.  Naturally spooks and bad guys who want to inheritance get into the act.  Pretty good.  Recommended for fans of the genre.,1383264000,,292,4.76
