8070627,5,B0009YVDB2,"Read this book many years ago and was mesmerized. Would love, love, love to see the series but I live in the US. I have a DVD, which I believe to be from Region 2, that would not play in my DVD player but it did play in my computer's DVD drive. Is there a way to see this series in the US without spending a fortune or without spending a ton of time and money on researching how to get it done?",1423958400,2,394,3.7590361445783134
8070628,2,B0009YVDB2,Implausible and with a politically correct ending.,1423526400,,50,6.285714285714286
8070629,5,B0009YVDB2,Really good movie. I recommend it for anyone else. Best movie about how the trouble of northern Ireland was going through back then.,1405900800,,132,4.782608695652174
8070630,4,B0009YVDB2,"My first knowledge about the series was given by listening to the end title song by ""Clannad"". I also had a long time interest about the Northern Ireland conflict so when I could, I got ""Harry's Game"". So far I'm a happy customer. In my view this is a TV series which despite its age and procedence has aged well. On the plus side: it catches very well the eighties feeling (scenery and atrezzo are both superb), it has great actors (unluckly they are seldom known to the general public). Despite being filmed outside Irelandthis is not a problem. To sum it up: a honest, no frills and well structurated story in an attractive package which is sure to get new fans interested on good series which despite its proximity to actual events offers a well balanced point of view. Negative points are the lack of subtitles and the scarcity of extras in the DVD...
Altogether good value for your money: highly recomended.",1314316800,5,913,4.607361963190184
8070631,5,B0009YVDB2,"This series presents an old theme - how hatred and violence breed only more of the same, like some monster feeding on itself - but in a taut thriller based on the novel by Gerald Seymour and backed up by the doleful music of Clannad before they really became famous. In fact, their Theme from Harry's Game put them on the map and has been a favorite ever since, reappearing briefly but quite deftly in Harrison Ford's Patriot Games.

The series starts off with an intimate look at a youthful English PM having breakfast with his young family and then heading off for work. As he climbs into his car, from a distant perch a sniper kills him and the hunt is on for the Irish assassin. Harry is a Army special ops intelligence officer tasked with infiltrating the IRA to identify the killer. Since he is so deep undercover, the police and the Army don't know he's working against the IRA. They think he too is the enemy. He's in danger from both sides until the drama plays itself out in a realistic but unhappy ending.

I'm writing this review in hopes that the powers that be will consider issuing the DVD in a Region 1 format. The series is really as gripping and compelling as the original Manchurian Candidate or Z and deserves a wider audience.",1275091200,13,1247,4.464912280701754
