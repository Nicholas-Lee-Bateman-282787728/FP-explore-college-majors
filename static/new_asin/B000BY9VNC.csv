Those familiar with Hong Kong cinema will expect disjointed storytelling, often seeming as if the entire movie was improvised. If you are fluent in Cantonese, you would be able to follow the dialogue. But if you are depending on the subtitles, be prepared to get only about 75% of what is going on.

All in all, an average movie, but seeing as how this is one of Chow's earlier works, a forgivable effort. It is a glimpse at Chow before he came into his own as an actor and director.",1229385600,,668,4.430894308943089
