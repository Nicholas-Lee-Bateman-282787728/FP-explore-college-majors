8307480,4,B001H00CDW,I was a nursing student myself and saw this and thought it would be pretty cool just to see what it is that Nurses back in the day had gone through. This DVD may be short but it was a nice little trip down memory lane and highlighted for me and my class the way nursing has changed and how it hasn't in the past 70 years.  It is an interesting watch and isn't too expensive to boot.,1285372800,,382,3.8974358974358974
