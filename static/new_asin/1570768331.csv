3547597,5,1570768331,"One of the longest-running television serials to ever grace our screens has finally arrived on DVD following the tremendous success of the ""As the World Turns"" box set last fall. In this remarkable set fans get a chance to revisit Springfield on 20 complete, uncut episodes from various years starting in 1980. Sadly, all the episodes of ""Guiding Light"" (like all other Proctor and Gamble shows) were wiped completely, meaning they were destroyed by the networks which explains why we are not seeing any episodes on these sets prior to the fall of 1979. Still, if your a lover of soap opera or these particular shows these are must-have sets. Talk is Soap Opera Classic, the company releasing these DVD's are about to release ""Another World"", ""Search for Tomorrow"" and ""The Edge of Night"" sometime in 2012 so keep your fingers crossed.

 The following is a complete list of episodes and their original CBS airdates:

Disc 1: Great Weddings

1. Kelly Nelson marries Morgan Richards (Aug. 18, 1981)
2. Quinton marries Nola Reardon (June 14, 1983)
3. Joshua marries Reva Shane (July 18, 1989)
4. Gus marries Harley Cooper (Aug. 19, 2005)
5. Billy marries Vanessa (Sept. 14, 2009)

Disc 2: Secrets and Scandals

1. Nola admits to lying to Kelly about her baby (July 27, 1981) My personal favorite and probably the greatest script Douglas Marland ever wrote for a soap opera!
2. Jane Elliot (Tracy from ""General Hospital"") breaks down as her multiple personality comes out. A virtuoso performance by Elliot and this too was written by Douglas Marland (July 12, 1982)
3. The Truth about Phillip Spaulding (Aug. 29, 1983)
4. Husbands, Friends and Lovers (Jan. 11, 1993)
5. The Spaulding Ex-Wives Club (Joan Collins stars as the ""new"" Alexandria and the marvelous Mary Kay Adams returns as India Von Haulkein. I only wished they had more India episodes in this set!!!!) (Oct. 18, 2002)

Disc 3: Springfield Through The Years

1. Christmas, 1983 (Dec. 23, 1983)
2. The 50th Anniversary Show (July 3, 1987)
3. Dreamgirls (Nov. 3, 1992)
4. The 15,000 show (Sept. 7, 2006)
5. The 70th Anniversary Show (featuring Kim Zimmer as Charita Bauer as the cast plays characters and behind-the-scenes personnel like Irna Phillips from the 1950's) (Jan. 25, 2007)

Disc 4: Villins and Vixens

1. On The Trail of Roger Thorpe. This is a classic where Roger meets his death after being on the show exactly nine years to the day and after being a rapist. One of my favorites and shot on location in the Caribbean (April 1, 1980)
2. The Fountain of Truth. The episode where Reva says ""I baptize myself the slut of Springfield"") winning Kim Zimmer her very first Emmy as Best Actress. (July 30, 1984)
3. Sinister Sisters (Dec. 30, 1988)
4. Payback is a Bitch (July 12, 1991) This is one of Beverlee Mckinsey's greatest performances (actually her best on ""Guiding Light"") where she destroys Roger at the Country Club. McKinsey should have won the Emmy the following year, but was overlooked! FOOLS!!!
5. Annie's Wedding From Hell (Jan. 26, 1998)

 Again, this would have been a great disc to showcase some India episodes as she was truely the best vixen on ""Guiding Light"" from 1984-1987, but maybe the next set my wish will come true!",1327017600,26,3207,4.800362976406533

People must understand why Richard Noone chose the date 5/5/2000.  He was pressured by the publishing company to give a date closer to the release date of the book, the publishers emphasized that a date too far out in the future will not surpass expected sales and profits but a sooner to pass date always has shown it's revenue producing potential where Richard Noone changed his original cataclysmic times period.  Maybe he initially had the Mayan calendar in mind, but it was thirty years into the future from 1982.

I have watched Guiding Light for 30 years and still miss it. This dvd set is a wonderful reminder of family,friends and home. On 2-29-08(leap day),Guiding Light ""leap"" into location shooting. Filmed in the town of Peapack,New Jersey,it is a perfect representation of what Guiding Light's Springfield would look like.'Guiding Light' fleshed out their town by being on location and giving us actual four walls and ceilings of the places. The businesses like Company,Cedars Hospital,City Hall and the lake are all situtated where they are suppose to be; even the Lighthouse sits proudly on the harbour. I commend Guiding Light for going outside the box.

He an Michael Zazlow, had the talent to make you hate and love them at the same time!  I could watch Phillip scenes all day! He made Guiding Light the hit it was in the 80s!  I was so happy that they did a DVD collection of Phillip.  Scenes between Grant and Christopher Brenau and Grant and Ron Raines were exceptional!  I highly recommend anything with the fine actors of Guiding Light!  The writing might have been up and down--but the Actors who compiled the cast of GL were second to none!!  CBS-you made the biggest mistake in canceling GL for a worn out game show!  Shame on you.  Now the least you can do is--- to release more of Guiding Light to the public!

This dvd set reminded me of the rich family stories that GL gave us through the years.  It also reminded me of how CBS and the PTB tried to kill my soap with poor writing and awful ""shaky cam"" photography.  Almost everything was filmed outside and the back ground noises were distracting!  Poor GL deserved better!  But all in all--I loved this show so much, that is is good to see ant part of it.  GL suffered with poor writing and photography--BUT NEVER poor acting!!  The actors were top notch and they are the ones that are worth seeing on this DVD!  Hail Guiding Light!!

It still holds a dear place in my heart and always will.
It was great to see so many familiar characters return for the final few episodes.

But on the whole, I found these 10 episodes a nice conclusion to the best soaps ever!",1353283200,,475,4.173913043478261
3547613,4,1570768331,"This is a great release, in general, quite a varied selection of episodes.  I was particularly happy that the 12/30/88 episode was included on this DVD collection.  It's always been one of my favorite GL episodes.  It features:

1) Some great, intense Michelle Forbes scenes.
2) Some great Spaulding family scenes. (The Spauldings were my favorite soap opera family, at least, the way that they were written from 1977 to 1994.)
3) Some great Phillip and Rick scenes.  (My top 2 favorite GL characters).
4) Some great Alexandra and Fletcher scenes.  (I was always a shipper of those two even though I was only 14 when this episode aired.)
5) This episode leads into the return of Roger storyline.

There was a writer's strike that lasted months back in 1988, but, the various main GL writers were back in the end credits by at least October 1988.  However, looking at this episode, many people probably wouldn't have been able to tell that there had been a writer's strike.  All of the stories featured in this episode were hitting on all cylinders.

Other favorite episodes from this DVD collection:

1) The 50th Anniversary Show from 1987
2) Alexandra's revenge on Roger episode from July 1991
3) The Fountain of Truth episode from 1984 - Not just for the Josh/Reva stuff.  There are scenes featuring other characters that are also quite good.
4) The Truth about Phillip from 1983

Like many others, I was disappointed that they killed off the character of Maureen Bauer.  So, I can't really list the ""Husbands, Friends, and Lovers"" episode as a ""favorite"".  However, it was really well-done for what it was.  The episode also features some great scenes between Henry and Jenna.",1347148800,,1679,4.818181818181818

I orderd this and Farewell to As The World Turns and they were here in just a few days and i didn't even realize how much they would mean to me and how much i missed these shows until i watched the first one. I know people say they were just tv shows and maybe thats true but i watched these shows five days a week from the first day i was born. I grew up with alot of these caracters on these shows and they aren't just a part of history they are a part of my history. A part of me. I watched as a child with my mom and i watched as a adult with my kids. And i even watched as a grandmother with my grandbabies. And i know im not the only one who did. Thank god for soap classics. CBS lost thier minds. Please make more of these. Dont forget Tammy and Johnathan or Lujack.  Some of us miss our old friends.,1346284800,8,844,3.7954545454545454

3547618,4,1570768331,"I was a big fan of the 3 P&G shows:  Guiding Light, As the World Turns, and Another World.  I do hope that they eventually release some Another World episodes, as well.  I also wish that the ATWT James Stenbeck collection was available on Amazon.  I would really like to buy it.  That DVD features 10 famous and iconic James Stenbeck episodes.

The ATWT collection had more episodes on it that I didn't already have on video tape, compared to the Guiding Light one.  Though, it is nice not to have to search through video tapes to find certain episodes (like disc 4, episode 4 - Alexandra's revenge on Roger).

With the Guiding Light collection my favorite discs are:

1) Disc 2 - Secrets and Scandals
2) Disc 4 - Villains and Vixens

With the As The World Turns collection my favorite discs are:

1) Disc 1 - Great Weddings
2) Disc 4 - Villains and Vixens

The Tom and Margo wedding comes off as a Bridget and Jerome Dobson episode based on how unique and quirky it is.  However, there are no end credits on the episode on the DVD; so, I can't be sure about that.

I was a Steve and Betsy fan, so, it was great to see the 2nd episode of their wedding again.  I hadn't seen it since it aired.  I only had the first episode of their wedding on video tape.  The episode on the DVD ends with the beautiful song that was written specifically for the characters of Steve and Betsy, playing during the end credits.  There were some wonderful original songs written for various soaps, and that was one of them.",1342051200,,1503,4.326164874551972
3547619,5,1570768331,"Phillip was my favorite Guiding Light character, so I love that they did a DVD collection for him.  I do, however, wish that it had been 10 episodes instead of 5.  Especially, since I already had episodes 3-5 on video tape.

Regardless, the picks highlight some of the biggest moments of the character's life: Phillip's childhood; being on the run with Beth; his marriage to Beth; Lizzie's confession to killing Carl; and Alan's death.  I do wish that the DVD had included the Spaulding Takeover episode from May 1988 that ends with Phillip drunk and miserable on the floor after the takeover.  Hopefully, they'll put that episode on an Alan collection DVD or a Spaulding family DVD.

I was thrilled that they managed to find a 1977 episode with Phillip, Jackie, and Elizabeth in it.  I have several Soap Opera Digest issues from that time, so, I was able to read about the Phillip parentage storyline.  But, it is nice to finally be able to see one of the episodes from that storyline.  This episode also has Jackie's Dad (and Phillip's maternal Grandfather) in it.  Alan is supposed to go see him for a doctor's appointment.",1342051200,,1126,4.698979591836735

3547623,5,1570768331,"Soap Classics continues their wonderful array of bringing viewers and fans of soaps another installmenet of episodes from one of the longest-running American serials ever, ""The Guiding Light"" or as it became known in 1977 as simply ""Guiding Light"". In this new edition entitled ""The Bauer Family Story"" ten complete and uncut episodes are included along with two extremely rare 1970's shows thought to be destroyed due to the wiping process CBS and Proctor and Gamble would involve themselves in during the 1950's through the end of late 1979. Those two episodes, one from 1973 (a half hour show) and one from November, 1977 are a must-own for fans of vintage serials. These episodes are not even out there in internet trading circles so the price of this set is worth just to own those two shows.

 There are no bonuses, but the shows themselves are cleaned from their original master CBS tapes.

 The following are the 10 episodes along with their original airdates:

Disc 1: Meet the Bauers

1. ""Man of the Year"", November 14, 1977 (one of the shows first one-hour episodes)
2. ""Where in the World is Santo Domingo, March 19, 1980 (Roger Thorpe has kidnapped Holly. Filmed in Santo Domingo.
3. ""Courage"", June 27, 1984 ( a moving episode where Bert Bauer loses one of her legs reflecting what actress Charita Bauer went through in real life).
4. ""The Return"", Nov. 22, 1996 (Mary Stuart, former star of ""Search for Tomorrow"" debuts as the new Meta Bauer.
5. ""Death of a Patriarch"", Feb. 27, 1973 (the lost episode where Papa Bauer has died). This also comes with the original network commercials!!!!

Disc 2: The Bauer Barbecues

6. ""Unexpected Arrival"", July 2, 1987
7. ""Dueling Barbecues"", July 4, 1994
8. ""Party Crasher"", July 4, 1997
9. ""America The Beautiful"", July 4, 2002

Kim Zimmer as Reva and Beverlee McKinsey as Alexandra are outstanding actresses,in daytime or anytime ! Followers of Joan Collins should enjoy her turn as Alexandra in a fun episode. Also Carrie Nye does a nice turn as the villainess Susan Piper. The finest acting takes place at the Springfield country club when Beverlee McKinsey tears down Roger in front of the whole town and divorces and fires him from Spaulding eneterprises !

3547625,5,1570768331,"People who don't even know anything about soap operas know the names of ""As the World Turns"" and ""Guiding Light"": two of the longest-running serials in American television history. In this special two-pack combo 20 episodes of each series is presented for a total of 40 shows that have been restored from their original master tapes and come without commercials and are availble for the first time of DVD.

 For me the best episodes are from the late '70's and early episodes as those shows have been rarely seen among trading circles. I especially love the 1980 episode from ""Guiding Light"" which was filmed on location in the Dominican Republic and had the evil Roger Thorpe fall to his death, or we thought so at that time. Another gem here is the July, 1981 episode that featured Kelly Nelson confronting Nola Reardon about the paternity of her unborn child. The episode was written by none other than Douglas Marland, one of the greatest soap writers ever. There is also a brilliant 1991 episode featuring the classy Beverlee McKinsey in a virtuoso performance bring Roger down to his knees in fron of the whole town.

 The one episode from the ""As the World Turns"" set that I truely cherish is the 1979 show that has never been seen since its first CBS broadcast. It features the beautiful Eileen Fulton and former ""Peyton Place"" star James Douglas.

 All in all though a beautiful combo of classic soap opera that you will cherish forever. Also look for other DVD sets on these two shows that are availble for purchase.",1333411200,2,1526,4.7180451127819545
3547626,5,1570768331,"Soap Classics is continuing its tradition of releasing classic soap opera episodes from the huge Proctor and Gamble archive that houses episodes from shows like ""Guiding Light"", ""As the World Turns"" and other serials that have been taken off the air. This latest edition centers on the character of Phillip Spaulding, one of ""Guiding Light's"" legacy characters.

 This set features 5 episodes, and if you need a reason to purchase this it's because of the ""lost"" episode from 1977 that Proctor and Gamble didn't even know they had in their collection. That particular show (which originally aired on November 23rd, 1977) was broadcast on CBS shortly after the soap went to an hour. It features a very young Phillip coming to Springfield with his parents, Elizabeth and Alan. At this time in ""Guiding Light's"" history writers Jerome and Bridget Dobson (later creators of ""Santa Barbara"") needed to enlarge their cast so the Spauldings were added.

 The other four episodes are ""One the Run"", which shows Phillip falling in love with Beth (aired on December 19, 1983), ""The wedding"" (Phillip marries Beth although she's palyed by a different actress and broadcast on February 14, 1991, ""The Confession"" and has Phillip's daughter making a confession (June 1, 1998) and finally ""Making Peace"" with Phillip making amends with Alan and shown on September 15, 2009, just three days before the soap opera went off the air.

 The episodes have been cleaned from their original network prints, come uncut and look beautiful. There are no bonus features.",1333324800,9,1544,5.08300395256917
3547627,5,1570768331,These collections have brought back a lot of childhood memories for me.

3547628,5,1570768331,"I don't need to tell you how thrilled my grandmother was to receive this belated Christmas present.  Having been a fan of Guiding Light since it's radio inception until it's final airing, this was a treat beyond belief.  I am thrilled that Soap Classics has made the decision to put these timeless/important soaps on dvd (Now will you please create a cable network that airs them daily)!
That having been said, while I will not look a gift horse in the mouth, because I appreciate the kind effort and devotion that has been put into the ATWT and GL compilations I just would like to offer up one constructive criticism.  I think this particular venue would be better served, if instead of one episode highlights of major storylines, they put a proper representation of the storyline (4-5 episodes) on one disk.  (Example: The Maureen Bauer episode included in this package).  As any well seasoned Guiding Light fan knows, while this storyline will go down in GL history as the biggest mistake ever made in it's 72 year run, it also provided almost every character on the show during this time with Emmy winning material to play on screen.  It would have been nice to see the episode where Lillian and Ed actually have the affair, followed by the episode included in this compilation, the actual episode of Maureen flatlining and ending with the very rich episode of her funeral/gathering of the denizens of Springfield.  Ellen Parker (Maureen), Maeve Kincaid (Vanessa), Tina Sloane (Lillian), Peter Simon (Ed) and Maureen Garrett (Holly) had utterly mind blowing performances during this storyline. The kind of performances that would make a first time viewer of GL understand why it was on for 72 glorious years and why the decision was made to put it out on dvd.

Finally, to any Guiding Light fans out there...I still give this compilation 5 stars.  In fact, we can thank our lucky stars Soap Classics gave us this gift!  Thanks.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Guiding-Light-Classic-Episodes-DVD/dp/B006ZCAQFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Guiding Light Classic Episodes DVD</a>",1327968000,4,2116,5.233727810650888

BUT...and this is a BIG BUT...

For the third release I am now getting a little discouraged. Weddings? Villains? Vixens? Scandals? ETC.. None are interesting, complete, fulfilling, or hopeful for the understanding of soaps, the appreciation of soaps, or the hope for the future of Soap Classics.  I really got excited on the first ATWT release - even knowing it was some randomly plucked episodes, few of which were CLASSICS by definition.  I love anything Christmas from soaps and think what a waste it is that SOAPNET never once has taken advantage of holidays by airing marathons of holiday episodes that any soapfan would love, so that set was appreciated. But now we get another randomly plucked set of episodes, few of which are classics...AGAIN.

Don't get me wrong - I will buy whatever I can possibly get from any soap opera from any era, especially before ""my time"" or when I was a kid in the 1970's aand 80's.  AND will never ever buy a soap set that is recent episodes only (1999+ would not be worthe the money, as they recent enough that I have seen them) - Guiding Light is great because I have only seen episodes from the Tammy Jonathan years through the end of the show so having many I haven't seen is fabulous.

ANYONE who loves soaps or understands soap fans MUST inherently know that we love the people, the characters, the stories, the buildup, the history. If you want anyone other than diehard fans to buy it - you are on the wrong track.  I want to watch STORYLINES, how they got together and ended up getting married, how they fell in love, what happened after....what made her a vixen or him a villain? Who killed who and why - who did they think killed who and why... None of these stories are told in one or 2 episodes, they lasted months, or years even.  I WANT STORIES - that's why they were called STORIES in my mother's time, because that's why everyone loved them.

You want new people to buy them? Release the STORYLINES as complete as possible, you want SOAPfans to Buy it AND love it, AND save up our money for the next release? RELEASE THE STORIES!

If you are giving us multiple quick releases to get momentum, at least give us hope that we will get something more than Weddings and tributes and plucked episodes in the future. Give us news that you are working on SOMETHING MORE even if it takes time.

PLEASE I BEG OF YOU.....Peyton PLace was such a terrific Soap release -  I got a set for me and then mom wanted a set, then Grandma wanted a set, none of us had ever seen them but we all LOVED watching the 2 sets with full storylines.

SoapsClassic needs to give respect to the genre by releasing STORYLINES and following characters with full episodes, over time.  Soap Fans will pay and if it has storylines that can be followed and characters to connect with, others will follow. Tributes are for diehard, single show fans, and fans of ANYTHING SOAPS but that's about it. And if you don't give us hope for anything more, we'll stop checking to see what's coming next.

BUT - Thank you so very much for whatever I can get.",1327881600,20,3163,4.4558058925476605

My horse is a Biter!  I was told that he was a 911 call away from causing trouble with all of his biting.
Being very concerned about that statement, looked into many things to understand the biting, and what I could do to minimize it.
Turns out my horse is at a stable that uses the same saddle on many different horses.  It is thought that a gel mat under the saddle would help my horse.  My horse is an Arab/Quarter Horse mix, so he is just a tiny guy with a much shorter back than the Thoroughbreds, Quarters, Morgens, and Draft horses that use the same saddle.  The Stable says, that they use a very expensive Rhino Saddle, so it should be good to use on all the horses.  I certainly beg to differ!!!!  My little guy is usually in so much pain after he is used for lessons that he has eye buggers from his tears of pain.  When he sees me, he lifts his front legs to tell me that he is in lots of pain.

The techniques from the Masterson Method has allowed me to help my little Horsey experience many releases from his pain issues.

When I first saw him perform a release it was a really big deep one.  His neck was fully extended, his Mouth opened wide, his Tongue sticking out, his Eyes rolling back so that you could see his third eye lids cover his eyes.  It had so many deep releases in a row, that I got scared and thought that he was having a seizure.  But he was standing strongly and not floppy around on the ground.  Then he shock his coat and the rest of his body so hard you could hear all of his muscles tightening and releasing.  Followed by many deep sighs and licking and chewing.

I had no idea what I had witnessed which out of great concerned spent much time looking up what it could have been.

It wasn't until seeing the Masterson Method on YouTube that I finally gained clarity about what was happening with my horsey when he and I worked with each other.  He is a much happier horsey now!  Many people have commented on how much better he is during his lessons, and how much he and I seem to be more connected.  Every once in a while I catch someone videoing us as I work on him. He has very obvious releases.  He has even had tears roll out of his eyes afterwards.  No doubt due to relief from pain that he has experienced.

I am so grateful that this video has become such an important tool working with my horsey.  I have tried this on other horses with very similar results.  I want to go through the entire ranch and give all the horses treatment.  Just not enough hours in a day.

It's nice to see my horsey excited to see me when I greet him at the Stable.  When I first put on his halter and he lifts his front legs, I know immediately what to do to help him out.  I love knowing what to do now, to help him out.

Others at my stable are now learning these techniques on their own too.  We are seeing a lot more happy horses.
