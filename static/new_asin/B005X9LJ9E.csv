8488409,5,B005X9LJ9E,Actually this DVD is just fine-and not defective-if you are playing it on a region 2 DVD player ((as it is stated in the product title/description)).  It is imported from the UK...and therefore formatted for UK DVD players or other region 2 countries. The USA falls under region 1...,1423612800,2,283,4.775510204081633
