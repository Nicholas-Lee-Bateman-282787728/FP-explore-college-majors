7957021,5,B00005YTR7,"buy this ""hullabaloo"" dvd series, this is better than ""shindig"" video series.  ""shindig"" is a waste of money because it was edited too much, not worth watching.  buy ""hullabaloo"" especially the british invasion series you will enjoy watching the entire show.",1222732800,3,258,5.2682926829268295
7957022,5,B00005YTR7,"The reason why I got this DVD was because I enjoyed the DVD ""Sixties Rock"" (highly recommend) very much that I had to see the ENTIRE EPISODES of when these first aired...SWEET! Its like going back into time. The sponsors are even introduced at the outset of the show. Truly history captured in a mist of MUSIC/SHOW/DANCE ala mid-sixties. This DVD has 6 episodes in what seems their entirety with performances by THE ANIMALS, PAUL REVERE AND THE RAIDERS, THE BYRDS, THE SUPREMES, NANCY SINATRA oh and its HILARIOUS (hell after a couple glasses of wine) seeing FRANKIE AVALON introducing SAM THE SHAM AND THE PHAROAHS. If you make a decent salary this is a gem to GET! (perhaps a good investment too) The only drawback is that its in black and white. Apparently the color originals were destroyed or maybe stored near the center of the earth. With todays technology someone should restore some of these performances-classic GOLD to their original state and make a nice profit!",1198022400,8,974,4.803571428571429
7957023,4,B00005YTR7,"You have to assume that anyone who buys this is already converted. You won't make kids understand the good old days with dodgy, grainy video, so the music really has to deliver. Unfortunately, the audio quality ain't much better than the video. But the performances? Another story.
Even with lip-synched appearances, there's a massive energy flow throughout the disc that separates the rockers from the lounge lizards. Result: about half of this is essential viewing (Personal highlight: Joe and Eddie doing Dylan. Personal weird moment, but still a highlight: The Hullaballoos. Loved 'em then. Now they really look scary!)
Sixties fans, get all three Hullaballoo DVDs. Utterly fabulous.",1029542400,20,687,5.37037037037037
7957024,3,B00005YTR7,"The episodes on this DVD are packed full of great mid-sixties performances.  The producers of the show didn't mess around having the artists act in goofy skits or give interviews with canned responses.  Instead, artists were free to do what they do best, PERFORM. (Albeit, sometimes lip-syncing was used, or horrible live singing to a taped track, such as when the Byrds perform ""Mr. Tambourine Man"".)
Some purists will be disappointed by this DVD due to the picture and sound quality.  Apparently NBC did not keep the color masters of these shows, so this DVD contains black and white kinescopes.  A few color episode are available on the previous Hullabaloo DVDs.  I'm sure MPI would've released color versions of the episodes if they still existed.  Some viewers may also be upset because some episodes cut out the sponsor plugs that are shown after the theme song.  The DVD booklet also lists some of the episode chapters out of order.
Despite the flaws, by all means get this DVD if you enjoy music from the 1960s.  You'll have a great time watching it, even if you weren't around when the show was first on the air.",1024963200,25,1121,4.712820512820513
