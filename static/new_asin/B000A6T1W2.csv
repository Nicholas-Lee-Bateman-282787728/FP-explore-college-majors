2367749,4,B000A6T1W2,"The BBC's Love in a Cold Climate, based on the Nancy Mitford novels The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate, tell the stories of three young girls from aristocratic backgrounds: Fanny, Linda, and Polly, as they struggle to live life and find love amongst a changing world.

The production values of the series are wonderful, but the script needed to be MUCH longer. Screenwriter Deborah Moggach tried to fit too many events into a two and a half hour timespan. There was obviously a reason Mitford divided the story into two books. One leaves the film feeling quite rushed.

However, wonderful performances from Rosamund Pike as Fanny and Elisabeth Dermot-Walsh as Linda. There are some quite funny moments.",1150761600,15,714,4.892561983471074
2367750,4,B000A6T1W2,"Nancy Mitford's connected two novels about Fanny Logan and her relations with two sets of aristocratic relations, the eccentric Radletts and the powerful and domineering Hamptons, are among the funniest works to come out of England in the twentieth century: they portray a beautiful, doomed, and very silly world that has managed to hang on by the skin of its teeth past the onset of the Industrial Revolution when it should have been wiped out completely. Twice these books have been the basis for miniseries from the BBC, and the latest and most expensive version (from 2001) is avilable on DVD. The characters and observations about class and eccentricity are so funny almost no version of these novels can miss, and this adaptation is blessed not only with sumptuous production values but a wonderful gallery of BBC stars, from Alan Bates as the splenetic Lord Alconleigh to the Sheila Gish as the iron-willed gorgon Lady Montdore. Of the three young women cast as the central characters galloping off in pursuit of love, however, only Rosamund Pike fully succeeds as Fanny (paradoxically the least fleshed out of the three characters in Mitfords' books), whom she plays as a dreamy and naive rose; Megan Dodds does not do enough with Polly Hampton, who marries against her mother's wishes, and Elisabeth Dermot-Walsh plays the key role of Linda Radlett as mostly frivolous rather than as the rueful romantic Mitford imagined. It also seems to have been a mistake to tell the stories of both novels concurrently rather than sequentially, since THE PURSUIT OF LOVE becomes darker as it proceeds whereas the original LOVE IN A COLD CLIMATE becomes frothier; the adapter, Deborah Moggach, does not adjust well for these changes in tone when they run against one another.",1142640000,26,1771,5.0067796610169495
2367751,5,B000A6T1W2,"Two episodes and approximately 2 to 2 1/2 hours is not enough time to do justice to Nancy Mitford's hilarious and moving novels The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate.  In this version so much of the humor and far too many of the characters are either eliminated  or cut down sharply.

Nevertheless, given the time constraints this is a very fine adaptation.  The main story concerns the love interests of three upper class young women in 1930s Britain: Fanny Logan (the narrator), Linda Radlett (the primary heroine who bounces from husband to husband to lover), and Polly Hampton (the enigmatic beauty who temporarily falls for an extremely distasteful older man).  At that time girls from aristocratic families were expected to make their Society debuts at age 18 or so and marry by the time they were 21. Fanny, the most sensible of the trio, follows this path without any wrong turns and ends up with a husband she truly loves. Linda and Polly's vicissitudes lead them down many roads to tragedy in one case and final happiness in the other.

The series is beautifully filmed in England and France. Nancy Mitford's ancestral home Batsford Park stands in for the Radlett mansion, Alconleigh; while the magnificent Castle Ashby serves as Polly's enormous residence. In France similarly beautiful chateaus are used for Fabrice Sauveterre's homes. There is a real 1930s/1940s ambience throughout the series, particularly in the second episode set in the early years of World War II.

Although many of Mitford's funniest lines and scenes have not been included, there are some extremely amusing segments, such as a fur-coated Linda urging Londoners to join the Communist Party, or Sheila Gish's indomitable Lady Montdore's statement ""hardly any of one's friends had even heard of India before we went there"", or Uncle Matthew's emotional outbursts over Romeo and Juliet, or Fanny's aging socialite mother (The Bolter) arrival at Alconleigh with her Spanish lover.

There is also quite a bit of social commentary mixed in with the humor.  The old landowning aristocracy is well represented by the Radletts and the Hamptons, and their encounters with nouveau riche types like the Kroesig family are a good depiction of the social changes going on in Britain during the early twentieth century. The Spanish Civil War scenes remind us that World War II's mass horrors are shortly to unfold.

So, even though this mini-series should have been much longer, it is still  delightful and moving.  If this is your first introduction to Nancy Mitford, by all means buy The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate and read Linda, Polly, and Fanny's stories in their entirety.",1127952000,76,2674,4.984269662921348

2367807,2,B000A6T1W2,"Few chins are in evidence and even less backbone in this pallid dramatization of one of the Mitford sisters' (I forget which one, they are all so wacky) semi-autobiographical novels. I love BBC period dramas in general but this one was not among the strongest I've seen. There is no real dramatic arc. It's just one thing after another.
There are three women at the center of this piece -- Linda who marries a fascist, a communist and then falls for a French nobleman. Fanny, the narrator, who is normal and marries some boring Oxford don and Polly is -- actually don't remember what the hell happens to her.
Anyway, there are costumes and lovable British eccentrics and all the rest -- but it turns out pretty boring.",1297987200,3,718,4.6171875

2367810,5,B000A6T1W2,"This is another movie that I rented on Netflix and immediately after viewing it I knew I had to have my own copy.  I enjoy this period in history and times that will never return.  I started out feeling sorry for the very lovely Rosamund Pike who always gets treated as a second-class citizen but after all comes out a winner in the end.  In fact, she is the major reason that I bought the DVD. All of the actors did a great job and there are many seasoned ones that helped make this film so good.  If you have viewed enough films from England or by English authors, you will be delighted to see them once again.  I can't recall her name right now but if you've ever seen ""Anna Karenena"", the lovely actress that played the trouble-making princess appears in this film as a mother of a problem child, not as pretty anymore but still plays a fantastic role.  If you have any kind of a soul, you'll love this film!",1210809600,4,912,4.242774566473988
2367811,4,B000A6T1W2,"I wish I had the opportunity of watching the 1980 British TV version of Love in a Cold Climate [7 hours long]. This 2001 version attempts to condense Nancy Mitford's Love in a Cold Climate and The Pursuit of Love into a 150 minutes production. It doesn't do justice to the books, but it certainly entertains, and the acting is simply marvelous.

The story is told from the point of view of Fanny [Rosamund Pike]who lives on her eccentric Uncle Matthew Radlett's [Alan Bates] estate with her cousin Linda [Elisabeth Dermot-Walsh] and her family. Fanny narrates their exploits as young women coming out into society and their rather unconventional upbringing, with Fanny herself having an infamous eloper for a mother, nicknamed The Bolter. The two young ladies approach love very differently, as does another one of their peer group, the aristocratic beauty, Polly Montdore[ Megan Dodds]. Whilst Fanny ultimately marries for love and settles into domestic bliss, Linda and Fanny go through much mishap in their love lives.

It is the three actors who portray the young women who are at the forefront of the story, and the men in their lives form a backdrop without really being of much substance. The story is part-autobiographical, for it is based on Nancy Mitford's own unconventional life and makes for compelling viewing. The production is of high-quality with the sets and costumes being very authentic to the period portrayed, circa 1929-1940.

This is an enjoyable series with good character development, and will appeal to Anglophiles and fans of period dramas.",1209168000,7,1568,5.069767441860465
2367812,2,B000A6T1W2,"I picked up the book about two years ago and really enjoyed the world that Nancy Mitford created so when I saw that the BBC made a film I was excited because they are usually well written and acted. I was disappointed with this one however. I feel the writing failed to capture the light hearted essence of the novel and took itself way too seriously. And from there, it's dreariness pulled the cast down with it. It's a romance at the end of the day and there was nothing romantic about the cinematography or costumes or settings and it's set in the Cotswolds! I find that area to be full of atmosphere none of which is captured on film. Celia Imrie (an excellent actress usually) made some terrible choices playing Aunt Sadie as continuously on the brink of a crying jag. The three lead actresses do well with their parts but overall are miscast. Rosamund Pike is just too beautiful to play Fanny (even with mousy brown hair) and would have been much better suited to the golden-haired, strong-willed Polly. That would have been something to see. I wouldn't waste my money - spend the time re-reading the book instead.",1191801600,9,1120,4.577114427860696

2367814,5,B000A6T1W2,"Having read both of the novels that this mini series is based on (and loving both of them) I was afraid that this adaptation might disappoint me, but even though the pace is pretty fast (I'm not quite sure that someone who is not familiar with the books would be able to follow the many stories, the loads of characters and the various threads) I loved the way they conveyed the spirit of the books and enjoyed this mini-series a lot.

The casting was excellent, the period was perfectly represented and the stories were faithful to the books, so, having enjoyed the books immensely I consider this production a real treat.

The only drawbacks I can think of are the fast pace and the fact that a lot of the humor of the books didn't make it into the adaptation.",1173052800,15,762,4.435714285714286

That's all I'm going to say for this movie.  I wouldn't watch it again.

8075025,4,B000A6T1W2,"""Love in a Cold Climate,"" is a 2001  British television miniseries, the second adaptation from popular British author Nancy Mitford's comic novels,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Pursuit-of-Love/dp/0307740811/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Pursuit of Love</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-in-a-Cold-Climate/dp/030774082X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love in a Cold Climate</a>. This period romantic drama/comedy was a co-production of WGBH Boston, American public television, and the BBC. It is, of course, in full color, and is considerably tighter and shorter than the earlier, 1980 television adaptation.  The BBC, to a degree, did throw  money at the screen, in ballroom scenes, cars, clothes, and interiors; however, some corners were cut from the first adaptation: the ballroom scenes do not show the orchestras at play; and the production does not show Lady Montdore's big costume ball, nor follow her daughter Polly to Italy. The newer adaptation reflects the shorter attention spans of current day audiences in that it consists of only two parts, rather than six.  It resembles the first, however, in the presence of a great deal of talent before and behind the camera.  This adaptation was first broadcast on the BBC in 2001, and in America, on Public Television's ""Masterpiece Theatre"" in 2002.  But there's another major difference from the first adaptation: this version comes without subtitles; too bad, Acorn, as these well-bred British persons still don't speak above a whisper.  In this house, we were able to follow the production in its larger lines, but missed a lot of the hopefully, presumably witty dialog from Mitford's novel.

The series, to be sure, follows the eccentric, aristocratic Radlett family from the 1920s through World War II; knowledgeable sources state that it is fact, about the author's eccentric, literary family of beauties, the Mitfords, lightly disguised as fiction. It centers on three young related women as they search for love: wealthy young beauties Polly Montdore and Linda Radlett, and their poorer, plainer cousin Fanny, who narrates, while just trying not to behave like her mother, who has earned the nickname of The Bolter, as she flits from man to man. The entertainment boasts quite a few stars, and important supporting players.

Celia Imre (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Best-Exotic-Marigold-Hotel/dp/B009CPJHY4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel</a>) plays Sadie Radlett, matriarch of the clan, though she's  still given as  little to do  as was Oscar-winner Judi Dench in the first version.  Alan Bates,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-of-Hearts/dp/B000059H9D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King of Hearts</a>, plays Matt, Lord Alconleigh, an eccentric, kind-hearted terror, with the habit of loosing his bloodhounds to chase his daughters.  Sheila Gish plays the holy terror Lady Montdore.  Her daughter Polly is played by Megan Dodds; Linda, by Elizabeth Dermot Walsh; the careers of both these young actresses have rather stuttered out, leading me to believe that they too, as the actresses who played these parts in the first version,  were best at playing young beauties. Rosamund Pike, who plays Fanny, has had much more of a career: as she's starred in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pride-Prejudice/dp/B000I9YLUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pride & Prejudice</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Johnny-English-Reborn/dp/B004EPZ00C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Johnny English Reborn</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Die-Another-Day/dp/B0020Q099Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Die Another Day</a>, and the present day JACK REACHER.  But, of course, she's an unusually beautiful young woman, and Fanny's supposed to be rather plain, so that leaves the production a bit unbalanced.  Many more stars show up:  John Wood as Lord Merlin;  Anthony Andrews (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brideshead-Revisited-30th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B005GP7ELW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brideshead Revisited: 30th Anniversary Edition</a>) as Boy; Rupert Frazer as Lord Paddington,  Jemima Rooper (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-in-Austen/dp/B001PJRAUS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost in Austen</a>) as Jassy;  John Standing as Lord Montdore; Jeremy Child as Sir Leicester Kroesig.  And quite a few other familiar faces.

This production manages the unusual trick of being funny, moving, and accurate as to its time and place,  attributable, I expect, to the original material, and the talent before and behind the camera.  It is overwhelmingly a production of, by, and for women: the adaptation was by Deborah Moggach, who wrote the novel THESE FOOLISH THINGS, on which THE BEST EXOTIC HOTEL MARIGOLD was based, as well as TV treatments of THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK, and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.  The producers were exclusively female. However, Tom Hooper, who won the 2011 Best Movie Oscar for THE KING'S SPEECH, and has directed the just opening mega-musical LES MISERABLES, helmed here.

I found the production's greatest strength, and greatest difference from the adaptation, in that it showed more of the feminism implicit in the Mitford novels.  For example, the very title, ""Love in a Cold Climate"" is uttered by Polly, who's just back from a family stint in India.  She remarks that English girls in India are totally wrapped up in love, and the clothes to get them some, and that she hopes love in a cold climate will be less of an overheated obsession.  Fanny tells her that English girls at home are every bit as obsessed with finding love, and the clothing to help them in their quests.  Then, Fanny remarks that she and Linda are just waiting to begin their lives, which they define as finding love.  And we see Linda wasting a lot of time, trying to tell her fortunes in love with decks of cards.  Later, during World War II, we see Linda, home alone, playing this same game, when many Englishwomen were making themselves useful during the war.  Working class women went to the farms and factories.  Even Linda's well-born friends were nurses, drivers, whatever jobs they could get to help the war effort.  Later, both productions give Fanny's mother, the Bolter, the last word, as she remarks that aging is particularly hard for women like her - and Linda - who have invested their entire lives in love.  And girls, that is certainly a feeling at the heart of feminism.

The twentieth century ""Mitford sisters"" -- six daughters of David Freeman-Mitford, 2nd Baron Redesdale and Sydney Bowles -- became famous for their many love affairs and marriages, were celebrated, and at times scandalous, figures caricatured, according to The Times of London journalist Ben Macintyre, as ""Diana the Fascist, Jessica the Communist, Unity the Hitler-lover; Nancy the Novelist; Deborah the Duchess and Pamela the unobtrusive poultry connoisseur"".  Their exploits are still entertaining at two fictional removes.  Some viewers may prefer the first adaptation, some this second; you might want to look at both.",1356220800,5,7370,6.158203125

I was definitely not disappointed.  Since the events in the two novels ran concurrently, it was only natural to make one movie combining the two books. Not an easy feat, I'm sure, but one the screen writers handled with great aplomb.  Fanny, Linda, and Polly come across with all the privilege and passion Mitford endowed them with.  Their search for love with all its witty charm and biting satire is portrayed as it was in the book. The physical transformation of Lady Montdore was even better in the movie since it was, as the saying goes, just too good to be true!
