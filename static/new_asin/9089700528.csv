7901524,4,9089700528,"We visited Keukenhoff Gardens this past spring. Although this is a nice DVD it does not, in our opinion, do justice to the beauty of the Gardens. There are too many closeup shots of flowers, some of which repeat, and not enough wider angle shots of the multi-colored flower beds. Just our personal opinion after having spent a day there. We expected more from this DVD.",1473897600,,369,4.606060606060606

7901528,5,9089700528,"I purchased several of these Ambient Collection videos to help me fall asleep at night. This is my favorite. Absolutely gorgeous. Slow moving scenes of tulips and daffodils gently swaying in the wind, each scene more beautiful than the last.

I personally find the piano music irritating and there is a loud chirping bug that must be sitting on the mic in the 'natural sounds' loop (think dripping faucet), but turned down to a barely audible 'white noise' level, the sounds can soften the quiet.

The problem with using this video for sleep is that I find I want to stay awake to see the next gorgeous scene. At least I'm thinking about the beauty of the flowers instead of reviewing or anticipating real life activities.",1416700800,2,722,4.722222222222222
7901529,5,9089700528,"I love this DVD! it is all flowers..tulips, hyacinths, in the Holland fields . You have menu options to have either music playing, and the music is nice and relaxing, or just the sounds of nature..sounds like mostly birds twittering . the DVD goes in a continuous loop so you can have it on all afternoon .It makes a calm background for doing other activities like reading or knitting, or generally chilling out..",1405814400,,413,4.671232876712328

We were looking to purchase DVD's which would be appropriate for our lobby as well as create a welcoming, relaxing environment.  We purchased the ""Holland Tulips"" DVD and it's been playing daily - receiving huge compliments. The TV is equipped with ambient lighting, so combined with the beautiful tulips, it's W-O-W.",1371081600,4,404,5.3125
