2479680,5,B000E1C436,TYLER PERRY DOES IT AGAIN!  A VERY HEART TOUCHING STORY  WITH A STRONG CHRISTIAN MESSAGE,1185667200,3,88,4.8
2479681,3,B000E1C436,"It was very sad, but educational for people looking for love in all the wrong places.  It is giving a message to take time and let it find you. But, it could have been better made.  Again, add a couple of professional actors in the mix.  It is a good story, but played, I guess to their best ability.  Everyone cannot act.",1179446400,10,322,4.145161290322581
2479682,4,B000E1C436,"Never heard of the play until visiting [...]...but am truly happy i purchased....The story was great, the music was wonderful, and the actors played their part to a ""T""...Would have rated 5stars if the picture was a little more clearer, but it doesn't matter you get past that with the singing....The woman who plays the young girl (LOL)...sings her heart out and like everyone says....Aunt Shirley.....she ain't no joke!  Well worth my money...I'm even buying a copy for my mother.",1155686400,17,482,5.025
2479683,5,B000E1C436,"This was my 1st time hearing of a play by BCB and it was not publicized as much, so I was hesitant to watch it. But much to my surprise, I was richly blessed. This play did great and had good life lessons in it, with Biblical applications to it. I loved all the characters, mainly Aunt Shirley(She aims at the hip, but lovingly and with the Word). I also loved J.T. the patriarch. Tony Grant also did a great job(wonderful voice, and debonaire and gets better each time he performs. All the singers have phenomenal voices. I'm looking for the Soundtrack, because the songs were great. I 'm looking forward to more of their work.",1153008000,20,628,4.422413793103448
2479684,4,B000E1C436,"I thought that this was a good play Aunt Shirley really made you laugh. Tony Grant is a really good actor in plays.

2479724,5,B000E1C436,"This was an excellent show, it shows women how to love someone and get back not being use and abuse & think you can get away with. I loved it!!",1383696000,,143,3.8
2479735,5,B000E1C436,"I've bought two copies so far and loaned them to family or friends that didn't want to give them back. One song, ""Someone Like You/Me"" is sung so well by Tony Grant, should've been released as a single. The entire cast does an amazing job...very entertaining but drives home the point that ""Love Ain't Supposed To Hurt"".",1378857600,,320,4.631578947368421

good this product was a very successfully thing and i really did enjoy the way it helps me.  It is something else.",1355184000,,128,4.12
2479742,3,B000E1C436,"I chose the play because I thought it was a Tyler Perry play and it wasn""t.  I was disappointed in the fact that the saler claimed it was one of Tyler's plays and it wasn't. It's nothing that I would recommend.",1353888000,,210,4.121951219512195
2479743,4,B000E1C436,"I would watch again, it was basically what I expected, however, the vocals were SO MUCH MORE than I expected, cudos to the writers, producers, directors, they pulled off a great show.",1341878400,,183,4.75
2479744,5,B000E1C436,This is a good story for couples to watch it has good components to consider about a relationship before you start one and while you are in one.,1337644800,2,144,4.178571428571429
2479745,1,B000E1C436,"I knew this was not a Tyler Perry play but I decided to buy it anyway.  This was the worst play I've ever seen in my life.  Aunt Shirley was funny but that's about it.  The play was slow, weak and corny.  Terrible!!!",1329350400,,216,3.953488372093023
2479746,5,B000E1C436,"this is a video all women should watch it will empower you,any video that can lift you and show you your true worth is worth watching.",1326931200,,134,4.1923076923076925

2479748,1,B000E1C436,Not what i expected at all. I was taken by seeing Tyler Perry's name attached but the work seem so different. If you have nothing more to do and just have to watch something then here you go. I wouldn't expect too much.,1325030400,,219,4.116279069767442
2479749,5,B000E1C436,"Wonderfully cast. Everyone did a wonderful job. The only small very very small problem was the background singers sounded out of tone with each other but other than that this was a wonderfully developed stage play. Highly recommend it:) Also, the story line was captivating and anyone could easily relate to the situations that were going on. Again wonderful, wonderful movie! 10-10-10!",1320364800,3,386,5.241935483870968
2479750,3,B000E1C436,"The title is very captivating and even the snapshot videos being shown on youtube capture you. But when I bought the DVD it was not at all what I expected. Maybe it might have been better if I was actually at the play because the DVD did not capture the spirit of the play. Of course my favorite part was the scenes of Tony Grant, he added life to the play and the grandma just made you laugh like crazy. The title is very capturing, I just wish the play was better put together.",1301270400,,479,4.1063829787234045
2479751,5,B000E1C436,"I just love this stage play, the music and singing is excellent. I recommend this play to all. I also recommend part two Love aint suppose to hurt II, which is also excellent.",1299456000,,175,4.333333333333333
2479752,4,B000E1C436,"This was actually a good play. At the beginning, I thought I would not enjoy it because you could actually see the sound producer heads in the movie as the actors/actresses sang there song.  After getting into the play, you sort of overlooked that. The actors and actresses was so professional even though they are not well known as other actors...and boy could they sing...or (lip sing)I would recommend it to family and friends....I even ordered the sequel...The Wedding.  Cannot wait to get it.",1290902400,,497,4.904761904761905

2479754,5,B000E1C436,"i waited for the price to go lower but it didn't go to low. this movie was so worth the money now i have to get part II, if you like tyler perry, you will like the play of this author as well.",1261180800,3,192,3.488372093023256
2479765,5,B000E1C436,"I have watched several gospel plays and although all of them seem to have similar story lines, I haven't run into to one yet that wasn't worth watching, and Love Ain't Supposed to Hurt is no exception.  If you like gospel plays you will enjoy this one.",1257206400,3,252,4.361702127659575

2479770,2,B000E1C436,"I purchased this movie and thought it had a gret message but to be honest, the sound was horrible.. the singing was great but there was too much contrast in the movie and the singing portion.  Again, good story line but the music was very off.",1231545600,,243,4.282608695652174
