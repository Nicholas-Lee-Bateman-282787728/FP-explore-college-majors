8639972,5,B00I8XGFPK,"I am a United States History teacher, and I have used this documentary for the past five years in various ways.  It has annually been a part of my regular curriculum as well as used for special projects.  The documentary is beautifully done, with relevant archival footage to blend in with modern interviews.  The main participants from Robert Kennedy's 1966 historic visit each provide their unique insight as to how Kennedy's visit impacted them.  Those who are interviewed come from various South African backgrounds which thus provides a very authentic look at how Kennedy was perceived.  The documentary articulates the reasons for RFK to visit South Africa as well as how he was received by various social groups, from those who were disenfranchised to those who were in power at the time.  The film explores the greatness of Kennedy's ""Ripple of Hope"" speech and how it connected the two great social movements of the Civil Rights movement here in the US and the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa.  It so effectively connects the two movements that my students can very easily recognize the similarities that black Americans and black South Africans shared.  The inclusion of civil rights icon John Lewis along with Kennedy's younger brother Ted Kennedy help bring those connections to life for my classes.  I have introduced this documentary to my wife and family, none of whom are teachers, and they have thoroughly enjoyed it.  I highly recommend RFK in the Land of Apartheid.",1451692800,,1492,5.028455284552845
8639973,5,B00I8XGFPK,"Using never before seen archival footage, and interviews in South Africa and the United States, filmmakers Larry Shore and Tami Gold tell the story of Robert Kennedy's 1966 visit to South Africa during the worst years of Apartheid. The film evokes the connections between the American Civil Rights Movement and the Anti-Apartheid Movement in South Africa. The filmmakers find witness to this special moment in time through the sights and sounds of present day South Africa.

RFK IN THE LAND OF APARTHEID... follows Senator Kennedy to the site of his famous ""Ripple of Hope"" speech at the University of Cape Town and his encounter with Afrikaans students at Stellenbosch, the pro-Apartheid university. A high point of the film is Kennedy's meeting with one of the unknown giants of African history -- the banned President of the African National Congress, and first African Nobel Peace Prize winner, Chief Albert Luthuli -- living under house arrest in a remote rural area. The film travels with Robert Kennedy to Soweto, South Africa's largest black township, where he meets thousands of people and gives voice to Chief Luthuli's silenced call for a free South Africa.

We witness Kennedy publicly challenging the dominant Cold War ideology that anti-Communism, espoused by repressive regimes like that in South Africa, should be the only factor determining American foreign policy. With an original sound track by American jazz musician Jason Moran and voices from the University of Cape Town Africa Choir, the film tells an unusual story through the words and actions of an American politician whose legacy continues to advance human rights around the world.
