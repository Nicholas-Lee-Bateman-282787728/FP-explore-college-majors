8658920,4,B00KHBD61W,"Though people have to be age 18 or older to view adult movies, the genre's offerings tend to aim for sensibilities of a much younger crowd: 13-year-old boys. The storylines, such as they are, are constructed like dirty jokes, with humor that's more crass than funny, and with women often being the butt of the joke--literally, at times. But at the height of the Porno Chic era in the 1970s there were a few directors who actually approached the maligned-but-popular genre seriously, making adult films rather than porno movies. One of those was director Radley Metzger, under the name Henry Paris.

Metzger already had a well-deserved reputation for directing artful erotic movies in the 1960s and early 1970s, like ""Therese and Isabelle"" and ""The Lickerish Quartet,"" so it's no surprise his hard-X offerings would be more sophisticated than other porn movies. ""Naked Came the Stranger,"" the second Henry Paris movie, is based on a notorious bestseller and literary hoax. (Though the author is listed as ""Penelope Ashe,"" the book ""Naked Came the Stranger"" was actually the work of  24 Newsday reporters intent on proving Americans would buy any book, no matter how bad, if it had a lot of sex in it.) As Metzger relates in the commentary of this disc, the book's episodic story, as well as its title, made it perfect for adapting into an adult movie. The story -- about a wife who learns her husband is having an affair and gets revenge by bedding all the men (plus one woman) in their social circle -- isn't all that complex but adult movies can rarely sustain complex plotting. Too much story gets in the way of the sex.

Fortunately, the slight story is well told. In addition to well-composed shots and clever sequences like a scene filmed in the style of a silent movie, Metzger has a cast that can act. Leads Levi Richards and Darby Lloyd Rains, as husband and wife Billy and Gilly, respectively, are believable as a couple and as characters. Rains, especially, has great comic timing. Mary Stuart, as Phyllis, the woman with whom Billy is having an affair, also does a good job although I found her character's penchant for baby talk more than a little grating. A few of the actors get a little hammy (e.g., Alan Marlow, who Rains pleasures aboard a double decker bus), but otherwise everyone delivers performances worthy of mainstream movies.

I often found Metzger's softcore work hindered by too much talk and not enough action, but his move into hard-X territory forced him to curb his more pretentious impulses, ensuring that the pace of ""Naked"" seldom flags. However, since people (ahem) use porn rather than watch it, modern audiences may think there is still too much time spent on dialog and character development and not enough on the sex. Personally, I prefer Metzger's semi-hardcore movies like ""Score"" or ""The Image,"" both of which do a better job of balancing the demands of eroticism and storytelling. Still, ""Naked"" is worth checking out if you want to see how adult movies can be raised out of the gutter. It even has a decent soundtrack.

A note about the collector's edition of ""Naked Came the Stranger"": It's one disc, not two as listed here. However, it's a fully loaded disc. Besides Metzger's detailed commentary about the making of the film (without explicitly acknowledging any of the sex acts depicted; seriously, the commentary track could air unedited on public radio), there are shorts featuring then-and-now footage of New York locations used in the movie; hardcore action side-by-side with its softcore alternates, as well as added dialog scenes for the softcore version of the movie, and hardcore trailers for Henry Paris' ""The Private Afternoons of Pamela Mann"" and ""Maraschino Cherry"" (in which its star, the late Gloria Leonard,  pronounces ""maraschino"" as ""mara-SKEEN-o""). Also included is a thick booklet detailing the history of the book ""Naked Came the Stranger"" as well as the Metzger/Paris movie adaptation.",1426377600,3,3955,4.948795180722891
