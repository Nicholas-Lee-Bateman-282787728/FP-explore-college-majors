5358233,4,B009OCR2U6,"I finally got to watch ""compliance"" and was totally dumb founded by how the events played out. I remember hearing about the situation this movie depicts awhile back but after watching the movie, I couldn't believe the people involved fell for it that long!

If you don't know, a man calls this fast food chain ""ChikWich"" and says he's with the police department and has a customer who witnessed a cashier from said fast food chain take money out of her purse while she was eating there, also the police officer says he has a surveillance team that is monitoring this cashier for an unrelated incident that seen her do it too. The supposed officer wants the manager to search the cashiers belongings to help the department out because they didn't have any extra unit to send to the restaurant to do it themselves at the moment. The manager agrees and when they don't find stolen goods the officer convinces them to strip search her and it just escalates into ridiculousness from there!

It is a good movie and the actors did a great job but the thing that got me was how unofficial the man on the phone saying he was the police sounded and how the manager and workers fell for it! I couldn't believe that poor girl that was targeted actually let her employers do that to her.....but the managers drunk boyfriend was the icing on the cake, watch and you'll see!

In no way shape or form would I have let anyone put their hands on me unless I was at the actual police station in handcuffs, it was just so ridiculous it blew my mind. Just watch ""Compliance"" and you'll agree that this totally unbelievable event that actually happened could of been avoided with a little common sense and/or knowledge of the law! Be ready to be dumb founded and shocked but mainly be ready for the awkward discomfort you'll feel watching this girl get violated.",1350172800,14,1840,4.552870090634441
5358234,5,B009OCR2U6,"Have you ever gotten a prank call at home or work? Did they pretend to be some kind of authoritative person? A superior where your work or the police, and if they told you to do something did you do it. That is essentially what is going on in Compliance except it delves deeper into the darker side of human nature. What I and many people probably won't before seeing this movie is it is very closely based on a true story. It happened only a few years ago. As most of you know there are obviously scammers and prank callers operating all the time. Well in the mid-1990's to 2004 there was a prank calling, calling restaurants, fast food restaurants and grocery stores in rural parts of the country claiming to be a detective for the police. The man then convinces managers or whoever in charge to commit acts, like forcing female employee's to strip and do strip searches, confining them and other things. The incident the film is based on and the one that got the prank caller arrested happened in 2004 in Mount Washington, Kentucky at a McDonald's. The caller who is a man called the McDonald's during the night shift and got the assistant manager Donna Summers. He managed to convince her he was a detective with the police. He then told her that one of her female employee's is believed to have stolen money. He describes what Donna believes is Louise Ogborn one of the employee's on duty. The man says there are no officer's available to come out and needed her help. During the night Donna would confine Louise, take her car keys and wallet, force her to strip and while Donna is away Louis would be sexually assaulted. The guy was only caught because the maintenance worker Thomas Simms who refused to follow the callers demands. Donna finally decided to call her boss, who the detective said he had been on the phone earlier with. When she got in touch with the manager, the manager said he had been asleep and had never talked to the police. Donna quickly tried to star 69 the caller, but he hung up. The man was David R. Stewart who was married with five children. He was caught through tracing the phone calls he made, and the purchasing of prepaid phones. The incident is disturbing enough, but what happens after could be more disturbing. Steward was tried, but was acquitted. Why because there was no real evidence. Sure he made the calls, but he didn't force anyone to do anything. Steward wasn't holding a gun to anyone's head Donna and managers at the other places he called all willing did what he asked. It's really is disturbing incident, especially that a married man with five children would do this.

The story is gripping and riveting, but some people may find it hard to believe that people would easily believe someone over the phone claiming to be a police officer and doing the things like what Donna did. Especially if the people watching it don't know that it actually happened only a few years ago. I had a little trouble believing the story as well. I believe I wouldn't do what the characters did in the film or what actually happened, but I can't understand nothing like that has happened like that to me, so who knows. You also have to remember that human beings in general are followers who easily take orders and are controlled treating others badly, killing, raping and going to war just because we are told to. The story stays really close to actually what happened. Only the names changed. Like McDonald's wasn't used and the names of the characters are different. People may also not like this film because it's unflinching in the short film time in about one and a half hours. I'm sure people will find Compliance to be thrilling film that delves into the dark side of human nature and our reliance on authority figures or an unbelievable and boring film. Either way I think its good it will draw attention to the incident that I had no idea that happened, and that I'm sure few others did as well and that things like this still happen today.

The acting is perhaps the best part of the film. Ann Dowd (Sandra) plays the character based on Donna. She is gripping as the manager as she forces Becky (Dreama Walker) to do lewd acts and other things, especially the emotion on Sandra's face when she realizes it was all a prank call, and what she had done. The recognizable actor in the film for me was Dreama Walker who I recognized from Don't Trust the B---- In Apartment 23 which I like. She plays Beck the character based on Louise Ogborn. Dreama is compelling as Becky as she is threatened and force by the Officer Daniels (Pat Healy: The prank caller) and her boss Sandra surrender her keys strip and do other things. Dreama effortlessly displays the confusion, hurt, fear, sadness and shock that her character goes through the night. Bill Camp plays Van Sandra's fianc who is reluctantly brought into the mess by Sandra, and Pat Healy plays the prank caller who does a brilliant job, as you are shown shots of him relaxing in his home with not a care in the world or showing any remorse at what he was getting these people to do.

Whether you know of the incident or not I highly recommend the film to draw your attention to the topic and themes. Overall Compliance is a great film, with excellent acting by the small cast along with a great story that is closely based on an actually event, and is one of the best films of the year. Also seeing the film will draw your attention to Dreama Walker who has shown her comedic ability in Apartment 23 and shows her dramatic acting ability in Compliance.",1350086400,5,5547,4.528414755732801

5358248,1,B009OCR2U6,"In France they call this kind of movie ""The New Extremism""-- a close-up, microscopic portrayal of the absolute degradation of a human being. Yes, it's true, people do evil things to other people. Why do they do such things? The New Extremism does not care why, they only care to recreate life-like experiences of degradation--usually sexual degradation--and entice audiences to sit through those experiences. It's like being invited to a front row seat to witness a rape, a murder or some other atrocity. Come to the cinema, grab your popcorn, and sit down to participate in this ritual reenactment of real-world horror.

Why are such movies being made? Ask someone like Craig Zobel, who directed ""Compliance,"" and he'll give you some high-minded rationale, in this case, leaning heavily on the fact that such phone scams have happened in the real world, and so (he argues) we need to ""wonder"" why people comply with what they're told to do over the phone. Of course there's very little room for ""wondering"" in this shocking film. Life trauma's do not pique our curiosity, they send us running for cover.

The Jacob Milgrom experiment (which incidentally did not feature quite as much compliance as people were led to believe) did not include an audience component. Zobel and his friends are addressing that shortcoming in these films, conducting their own experiments in the movie theater: how long will people compliantly sit through a realistic reenactment of a trauma, once we've told them that what's happening on screen is ""art?""

Cinema, the banker's art form, will always find ways to desensitize us to the suffering of others. That's the way we are kept disconnected from one another, and politically compliant. Judging from the shockingly high Amazon approval score for this movie (3 stars and above), ""Compliance"" is a transparent example of how much progress they have made in that direction, and how much further they aim to go...",1501718400,,1943,5.027950310559007

5358254,3,B009OCR2U6,"This is one of those movies that you constantly say out loud as you're watching, as if you would believe that or actually do what is being asked.  However all the occasions when you say this, if you look it up did actually happen in a real life case (a McDonalds in Mount Washington Kentucky in 2004).  What the film fails to do though, through its script and other aspects is convince you these seemingly unbelievable acts of human behaviour were possible.  Surely the callers' voice in real life had to sound more like a policeman than a radio jock doing a prank call at the start, which became like a snickering teenage boy with his mates around him near the end.  Surely the fiance guy was more into or wanting and happy to get the teenage girl to do what the caller asks then the reluctant way the actor plays him in the film.  Surely the caller's dialogue would have had to have been better than it was. In fact we don't even hear/see any scenes of how the caller convinces him to do something there's no way he didn't know was sexual assault. Other factors such as job security for the teenage victim and the prospect of no other alternative work elsewhere, as well as for other employees who didn't intervene must also have been a heavy factor.  But it isn't portrayed in this movie.

Also what lets this movie down is there are no scenes showing what happened in the aftermath other than some police turning up at an office cubicle and arresting the guy.  We should have had some scenes of what happened to him (either as the fictional character) or at the very least some text on the screen telling us what happened in real life guy in the days/years after.  All through the film you're wondering how much money the teen would have sued the manager for yet this question isn't answered in the movie.  Sure you can look it up online afterwards (where she got a huge payout from McDonalds,and ridiculously so did the Sandra woman.  The fiance was the only one of the bunch that should have to actually do time.

5358258,4,B009OCR2U6,"Remember when the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal broke? Just how many of us thought to ourselves, ""I'd never abuse a prisoner! No way! Not I!""

We're sure, every one of us, that we'd resist on moral grounds even if ordered by our superiors.

Right? Think again.

And you will if you watch Compliance, a harrowing, gut-wrenching fable about power and authority that shows that even the most well-adjusted, ordinary person could be tempted to degrade and dehumanize their neighbor.

A taut, understated minimalist masterwork, writer-director Craig Zobel's sophomore effort is set not in a prison or a battle zone, but in the most mundane of locations, a fast-food restaurant.

Based on an actual case from 2004, Compliance features a masterful performance by Ann Dowd as Sandra, the middle-aged manager of a fictional, nondescript joint called ChikWich in a fictional, nondescript Ohio suburb who is persuaded by a prank caller to detain and humiliate one of her employees, an attractive teen named Becky (Dreama Walker).

Sandra is an overweight, perennially stressed-out, melancholy woman who feels her best days are behind her. Frustrated by her less-than-splendid job and life, Sandra tries to impress Becky and fellow counter girl Connie (Nikiya Mathis) by announcing that she and her fiance, Van (Bill Camp), a nondescript big lug who drives a beat-up old pickup, have a great sex life. She winces as she walks away to the sounds of the girls mimicking her.

Set over the course of a single miserable day, Compliance opens with Sandra's harried attempts to get her stock of frozen foods and her slacker employees in line.

Things go pear-shaped when a caller who identifies himself only as Officer Daniels (Pat Healy, in devilish form) tells Sandra that Becky has robbed one of the customers. The manager complies when asked to take Becky to the back room and strip-search her. (Becky isn't allowed to dress again and spends the rest of the film in the buff or barely covered in a skimpy apron.)

Becky puts up little resistance to the proceedings after being told by the caller that she could avoid jail if she does everything he asks.
As the evening progresses, Zobel and his actors expertly crank up the tension and the psychological, and eventually sexual, violence.

Becky is victimized over and over again as the always busy Sandra has her underlings and eventually her beau watch over the teenager.

Compliance will make you squirm in your seat and yell at the screen.
Never exploitive or sexually explicit, it forces the viewer to enter that taboo, intimate space between abuser and victim, making us feel complicit.

Are we, simply by watching the proceedings, not also culpable for Becky's suffering? Not since Hitchcock's Rear Window has the viewer been forced to reevaluate the pleasure and the guilt of voyeurism.

Compliance proves that true horror isn't physical. Broken limbs, cut throats, or grisly demons have little effect next to the true horror - moral horror. And it's chillingly effective because it shows that everyone, each and every one of us, is more than capable of perpetrating it.",1474588800,2,3117,5.017441860465116

5358263,4,B009OCR2U6,"Without spilling the beans, I will just say this:  this movie is all about an elaborate scam.  The viewer of this film is likely to pick up on the scam in a nanosecond, but unfortunately the characters in the movie do not.  While the whole thing seems far fetched, it was actually inspired in real-life experiences.  As P.T. Barnum would say.....

In any case, the primary reason anyone should watch this movie is Dreama Walker.  She plays Becky:  a lovely young woman right out of HS who is working her 1st job as a cashier @  a fast food joint.  Like so many of us, she is ""paying her dues"" in hopes of landing a better job / career down-the-road.  Unfortunately, she ends up smack-dab right in the middle of the shenanigans.

This movie is like a car accident on the side of the road:  it is disturbing on many levels and yet you can't take your eyes off it.  Few women can make a fast food uniform look as enticing as Dreama Walker, and she has one of the most amazing cheerleader bodies I've ever seen in my life.  While it pains me to say this, this story is incredibly erotic in a very twisted sort of way.

5358279,4,B009OCR2U6,"I was engaged by this film, but I did have some questions about it.  I thought the screenplay was superb--all the words on the page were there--but that the director, Craig Zobel, made some choices I had reservations about.
I didn't buy how the film portrayed the caller as a smiling, easy-does-it jokester, walking around preparing sandwiches, etc.  I would assume this was a sexual thing for this guy, and that while this was going on he would have been extremely wired and focused and, how to put it discretely, pleasuring himself.
Also, my sense is that in real life--the Kentucky McDonalds case this film was based on--the boyfriend was not the manipulated, hesitant, later-guilt-ridden nice guy he was portrayed as being in the film.  My bet is that in real life he was complicit with what the caller was doing and that this was a sexual assault.  In real life, he did get jail time.
Last, I found the casting of Becky a mistake.  As an actress she couldn't find, or wasn't helped to find, the disorientation and fear I assume the real life Becky had.  That made what she did in the film harder to believe.  Also, she didn't have the body for the role.  Undressed, she looked like a store manikin, kind of sexless.  The result was there wasn't enough sexual tension when she was nude and just had the apron on.
Put all this together and the effect was to soften and de-sexualize the film, and yes, make what happened harder to fathom.  As stark and dark as the film was, it could have been, and should have been, starker and darker, and I think, truer.  I would have preferred Zobel to have viewed this as an indy done on the cheap that was going straight to DVD and streaming, so why not go all the way, have the caller high on the activity and doing you know while he was getting people to strip search and probe a young girl, cast someone far more sexual as Becky, and make this boyfriend a terrifying menace and those spanks real spanks, and do more than suggest the oral sex.

The film is very difficult to watch in subject matter, focusing highly on the sexual assault of a young woman. The tension and suspense are nail biting. That this film is based on a series of actual events makes it even more terrifying. From an historian's perspective, I find it sad that this film did not have a wider audience; most are not even aware of it.

Maybe I am just too pushy, bitchy & demanding of person, to ever follow anyone's orders on the phone, or in person for that matter, to fall for such a thing, this just blew my mind. Especially w/the fiance, up to that point, I can somewhat see the manager or victim believing it was a cop on the phone & they had to do as instructed, but everything that happened w/the fiance, were things that NO COP, in person or by proxy via a phone call, EVER have the right to ask of any person - they had to know that - but yet they still followed orders, I just cannot wrap my mind around that part at all!

By the end, besides constantly saying WTF? All I could think was, if I didn't know for a fact that this truly happened in my lifetime, not all that long ago, in this country, I would have thought this was the dumbest, most unbelievably ridiculous movie plot I had ever seen.

5358343,5,B009OCR2U6,"The movie, which is a reenactment of an actual incident, portrays how easy it is for a predatory caller to manipulate his (or her)  victims. This is particularly true if the predator knows a little about the victims. In this case, as a customer in the fast food restaurant he overheard some employee conversations, including emplyoee names & the name of the district manager. Coincidentally, the night before, one of the supervisor's employees had left a refrigerator door open causing the spoilage of $1,500 worth of bacon which reflected badly on her supervisory skills. This caused her to be in a heightened state anxiety. The caller did not know about the spoilage but armed with the little knowledge he overheard he managed to portray himself as an authority figure (in this case a policeman). Speaking to the supervisor he claimed that a customer had reported a theft by a female employee (whose name I forget)  & that he was investigating it. He also said that he had spoken to the district manager, using the manager's name. He manipulated her by a combination of flattery & coercion to enlist other employees in an ""interrogation"" process that slowly escalated to strip searching, humiliation & sexual activity. At 1 point, speaking to the victim, he threatend her with a night in a jail cell if she did not stop protesting her innocence. He demanded that she adddress him as ""officer.""
The movie shows us how easy it is to manipulate vulnerable people, particularly the young, the naive, the poorly educated who might, in other circumstances, realize that this is illegal but were disarmed by the circumstances.

It is another examination into human behavior and an examination on Authority, how it is viewed and how people handle compliance with orders. I will no spend a paragraph discussing the psychological context for this story, or even the parallels with the Nazis, as it has been handled better in other reviews here.

This is a movie that is based on a true story, but that it putting it mildly as it is essentially note for note what occurred in real life. When a fast food store manager receives a call from somebody identifying themselves as a police offer and informs her that one of her employees has stolen from a customer, what ensues is a startling examination into how far a person will go to help authority and how far another will comply with orders in an effort to avoid punishment.

There were many moments where I would think to myself that there is no way this could happen and yet it did happen. The performances and filming were solid and them movie proceeded at a decent pace.

The timing to keep up the suspense and the acting was perfect for this subject. That everyone was so uncomfortable that they had to do things to try and get through the film speaks to the success of the director in a film that could easily been done in a trite way.  He totally honored the victims and though there is protest, educated his audience about a subject that really isn't discussed.  Women and girls have personally had to deal with creepy calls to their homes since the invention of the phone and are socialized to comply with authority in ways men aren't. Obviously this occurred before caller ID. Victims usually endure crank calls, hanging up when they realize they are talking to a creep and don't discuss it further. Unfortunately this is a completely realistic situation.  Having been a part of that work environment in my youth, it was very recognizable. Seemingly reasonable crank calls occurred all the time during work.  The criminal obviously had honed his skills over time probably beginning with crank calls to the smoke store looking for ""Prince Albert in a can"" or pretending to be the electric company asking if the ""refrigerator is running"" and moving on to creepy calls to girls who weren't old enough to be able to figure it out right away. Commonly when a crank call is discovered one just hangs up the phone and the criminal has received a thrill without repercussions.

There is a certain amount of submissiveness involved in any employment and many times it makes no sense. If something is just plain wrong there is still a decision whether keeping to a view of right and wrong is worth losing a job.  This is even worse with police authority as the issue is freedom.  No one really knows what their rights are and that confusion is what makes one unsure.  Everyone has seen simulated strip searches and other things on T.V. and assume it is real. Folks are just now being more cautious when they are pulled over, even with a badge and flashing lights.  We are all taught to follow authority of this type without question.  While there was much that should have been questioned, the issue is not stupidity but personal ethics.  At what point is it too much and realize something wrong is going on.

SPOILER!!!!!! He did his homework to insert the real names of the fast food authority figures to ""speak"" using their authority.  He mixes something seemingly reasonable with something outlandish, all the while insisting that it is in the victims best interest.  He knew to take advantage of the heightened stress of the surrounding work demands on a Friday night crowd to exert more pressure. He keeps the female supervisor inline by berating her and invoking the name of her supervisor. The acting of the manager was particularly good reflecting the totality of stressors that influenced her decision making.

5358414,5,B009OCR2U6,"This is a very good fictionalized version of the true story that happen right here in my home State of Kentucky.  The main thing this movie brings to light is a need for education and understanding that not everything you are asked by someone in authority over you in a job is for you to follow blindly.
In the real case the Management like the movie should have known that they were not dealing with a real Police Officer,  but unfortunately lines have been blurred between fiction and reality so long that there are people who really don't understand what they can and can't do.
A good rule of thumb is to always question something when you have doubts always ask for someone else even calling the local Police yourself if necessary.  No civilian including a Manager can hold you against your will at a job regardless of anything they are accusing you and without an actual Uniformed Police Officer or Detective from the PD there on the scene it should always be questioned.
This movie is really good in the fact that it shows one a lot of things that shouldn't be done and one that a lot of people especially young people need to watch and be aware of.  Knowledge is often the first key at defending yourself against a situation that isn't legal.
As I said this happen in real life here in my home State and it was a horrible breakdown on many sides.

5358419,2,B009OCR2U6,"""Indispensable filmmaking"" says Rolling Stone. Wow, I couldn't agree less! 45 minutes along, 2 of 3 in my viewing party wanted to stop the film or at least fast forward to the end. I'm usually a huge fan of independent films based on true stories, but in my opinion, the directors took this project more towards a soft porn than a true documentary of the horror that took place at this fast food restaurant (search Bing for ""compliance film true story"" and read the true story of where it actually took place).  Like most viewers, it was challenging to watch the utter lack of common sense, but I comprehend that is what freaks like this caller pray upon.  That said, about 45 minutes along, we got the point they were trying to make and at that point the film could have started moving towards what happened after the ordeal.

Instead, in the final 10 minutes, the producers fly us through a series of poorly linked events and as the film ends, the viewer is sitting there going ""what the heck happened""?  Absolutely NO wrap-up! Horrible ending. Such a shame because this is based on true events, and the viewer at a minimum should have had a wrap-up summary - even if it was just words on a screen.

The true story is horrifying and like most viewers, I would love to see the perpetrators locked up for life. This film didn't do the story justice.

But being Americans, we like to outdo what was done with each passing decade, which can be disastrous when dolts or twisted minds enter the equation.

Remember how not terribly long ago, ""Question Authority"" was a slogan printed on buttons and T-shirts? Perhaps it's time for a reprinting. Notice that many of the 1- or 2-star reviews are by people who can't fathom a scenario like this unfolding in contemporary American society... Compliance is ""too unrealistic,"" they say. Yet it can happen like this, and it did. There are plenty of malicious or simpleminded folk amongst our citizenry of 316 million.

Compliance points out that [1] there are enough people who lack critical thinking skills for it to be a problem for the rest of Americans, [2] we rely too much on the ""authority"" of others rather than using the moral compass innate to all of us (with the exception of psychopaths and sociopaths), and [3] despite progress in the past few decades, women are still very susceptible to exploitation by men (this story simply would not have occurred had the gender roles been reversed).

As for the story, it does plod along and it lasts too long, but of course it needed to run for more than 1 hour, being a feature film.

5358424,3,B009OCR2U6,"Craig Zobel's ""Compliance"" seems utterly incredible, but it is indeed based on a true story of a crank caller who terrorized more than 70 fast-food restaurants in 30 states. In each case, he persuaded the manager that he was a policeman, that one of the employees (always a pretty young girl) was guilty of stealing from a customer, and that the manager would have to carry out a strip search of the employee. Zobel's story concentrates on the last and most horrifying of the crank calls, presenting it as occurring in a fried chicken sandwich restaurant in Ohio (actually, it was a McDonalds in Kentucky).

In the bonus section, Zobel speaks of the Milgram experiments--in which subjects were persuaded to deliver electric shocks (actually simulated) to others--and how both those experiments and the crank caller's predations reflect on the human tendency to obey authority, no matter what, and even if the requests of the authority figure are morally repugnant. Zobel finds the perfect expression of this in Sandra (Ann Dowd), a harried, not-too-bright woman who is too distracted and too ambushed to question the orders of ""Officer Daniels"" or his accusations against Becky (Dreama Walker), an employee Sandra knows otherwise to be honest.

""Compliance"" is compelling enough to keep you watching long after it becomes actively unpleasant, yet it doesn't have the impact at the end that Zobel clearly intended. There are too many exasperating scenes: for example, why doesn't Van (Bill Camp) tell Sandra exactly what the caller is demanding? I also think it would have worked much better if ""Officer Daniels"" was revealed as a crank caller only at the end, rather than in the middle. However, the film contains one certifiably great performer in Dowd, who stresses the absolute ordinariness of Sandra. Sandra is a decent, helpful woman by nature, which ironically makes her all the more susceptible to commtting unspeakable outrages against Becky, just because a ""good guy"" tells her to.

""Compliance"" is definitely not for every audience, and it had to be absolutely perfect to work. Nevertheless, it is a darkly compelling film anchored by a very fine lead performance.",1412899200,,2174,5.118309859154929

I have always sincerely believed that at least 85 - 90 percent of Americans are either sheep, stupid or both.  I apologize for my bluntness but I have believed this since I was 18 or so and that's why this movie held such interest for me.  I then felt compelled to  read the reviews, and was pleasantly surprised to see numerous well considered  comments as well as many extremely simplistic ones whose authors were not vaguely aware of what the writer was attempting to accomplish.

In any event the movie was very well done and accomplished it's goal.  The movie depicted the average person's likely reaction to  being put in a similar position or situation.  If your one of those people, and there were many, that said tthere's no way this could have happened you either don't have a clue or believe people are inherently intelligent.

Take a moment to consider that there are billions of people that kill and maim others every day for no reason or because they Are simply told to do so.  At least, according to studies, 90% of Americans consider themselves  somewhat or very religious.  Obviously people can believe whatever they like but would you kill for something that, more than likely, is a fiction.  I think the vast majority would and it's been proven time and time again that they wIll and do.

Please don't be too quick to judge and this movie very accurately depicted what most of us hate to think is true.  Most people do what they are told to do and  that's life.

""Compliance"" is a dramatization of several different incidents where a caller to a fast food restaurant, claiming to be a policeman, talked employees into abusing other employees. The caller uses the technique of gradually asking the employees to go further in their actions; as they start to accept one thing, he pushes them to the next level.

The action starts on an extremely busy day, as it happens, right after an employee forgot to close a freezer, resulting in a loss of about $1500 in spoiled food. The caller claims to have a customer with him who saw a young female employee steal money from her purse. He also knows the district supervisor's name, and claims to have him on another line. He starts by asking the manager to search the employee, and progresses to making her undress. The caller says that the girl and her brother have been selling drugs, and claims to be searching her home at that very moment while the brother is under arrest. When the manager shows reluctance to undress the girl, the caller says that the only alternative would be for him to come to the restaurant, arrest the girl, and take her to jail. But if they search her in the restaurant, all that can be avoided.

At this point, I wondered why she didn't ask to speak to the district supervisor, if only to make sure that she was adhering to company policy. But the store manager doesn't think of this. In order to be able to get back to work, she calls her fiance, who has been drinking with some friends, to come in and watch the girl until the officer arrives. The caller manages to convince this man to spank the girl, followed by the girl performing oral sex on him. Why didn't the discussion that led to this set off any alarm bells? Even if he thought the caller was a policeman, wouldn't he have said that since he was engaged to be married, he felt uncomfortable with this series of events? Apparently, in at least one real-life case, this objection wasn't raised.

An interesting change takes place in the manager's mind as events unfold. At the beginning, she tells the other employees that the girl is ""suspected"" of stealing something from a customer. Later, this is modified into the unequivocal ""she stole something."" It's as if the manager has to justify what is going on by presuming that the girl is guilty.

The sequence finally ends when another employee comes in and is asked to watch the girl. The caller oversteps here by asking him to undress the girl again. Not having been present for the preceding events, this employee reacts more normally to what sounds to him like an anonymous voice on the phone. He leaves the room, complaining that the caller's request wasn't ""policemanly."" Another employee confirms that the girl's brother, far from being under arrest as the caller claimed, is actually out of town. The manager confirms that the district supervisor has been out sick all day. The real police station, we discover, was less than five minutes away.

The film is disturbing because we cannot help but wonder how we would have reacted in the same situation. We would like to think that we wouldn't have been fooled, but through the entire process, we know we have access to information that the participants lacked. As social animals, we know we're not supposed to undress and search each other for no reason, and that innocent girls should not be spanked and forced to perform oral sex. But at the same time, as social animals, we are conditioned to respond to authority and follow instructions. The film depicts, on a small scale, what happens in situations of long-term abuse, exploitation, torture, slavery, and genocide. A dictator starts small and works his way up, until one group is shoving another group into concentration camps and gas chambers, and it all seems justifiable to the participants given the shared explanation. Meanwhile, people watching from the outside are horrified.

Yet even in the most depraved situations, some people remain centered, and do not succumb to the temptation to follow orders, to go along with the status quo. What stops them is a high degree of compassion, the ability to put themselves in the victim's place and imagine what they are feeling. It may come down to having a higher than average number of mirror neurons, or it may arise from an independent streak, a mischievous desire to rebel whenever an authority figure tells them to do something. Human society could not survive if we were all independent rebels - stability requires most people to do their jobs and follow instructions. But for a society to be healthy and not just a collection of ants, it needs a few people whose response to the instructions is ""it's not policemanly."" They recognize when the policeman has violated his contract and has become a tyrant. Control, in other words, cannot be perfect. And sometimes those who deviate are criminals, and at other times, heroes.",1402963200,4,4947,4.71875

Yuck. Eww. Give me a break. This movie has no depth. Expect to learn nothing. It's sleazy. It's not Fargo. It's not Nicole Kidman in ""To Die For, or Kathleen Turner in ""Serial Mom"" this movie leaves the viewer feeling disgust. It's not ironic, it's not satire, it's not witty or funny. It's trash. A fast food manager makes her employee strip down naked when a prank caller, posing as a policeman, orders the manager to do so. It gets even worse and more gross. The manager is inspecting the girl's underwear while the assistant manager looks on. This happened in Kentucky at a McDonald.. Many reviewers attest to the fact that this really happened as depicted. I tried watching Anna Nicole Smith's reality show years and years ago. I felt so filthy and degraded by watching I had to stop. This could only happen with morons in charge. Anyone can get pranked. (West Coast, college educated). But the degradation this girl experienced did not need to be in a movie. I stopped watching when I realized the girl was naked and that 75% of the movie still hadn't run. I'm out. I'm done. I skipped to the last five minutes to see how the thing ends.

Words are powerful, and to the ignorant, words are TOOLS used by dark occultists to manipulate your mind. This movie is a demonstration of how mind control works. Hitler said, ""Make the lie big, make it simple, keep saying it, and eventually they will believe it."" So ""19 terrorists"" with box cutters brought down THREE buildings, made an impossible dive into the pentagon, and crashed a jet airliner that left no wreckage on 9/11? Well, the TV said so, so I guess it's true. Don't investigate. Don't question. Just accept it. Right. By the end of the movie, the girl is so TRAUMATIZED that she is willing to do anything suggested to her because her mind can't reconcile such an unreality with what is logic and truth. She is compartmentalizing the events in her brain because the brain can't function in any logical way with what is happening to her. Even the lower, most primitive part of the brain (the limbic or reptile brain of ""fight or flight"") is not functioning. She doesn't know from dark or light, right or left, or what color her own eyes are until someone tells her. Her eyes are green but if you told her they were blue, she would agree. Were you traumatized on 9/11? I was. But it only took me a few days to recover and realize that I was being told LIES. I realize that some people won't be able to get this. They are under a deep state of mind control. It's only after turning off the TV for a great length of time before the trance starts to fade and the thin veil of a false reality is lifted. If you follow that with an investigative inquiry into events happening in the world, you will SEE that none of them are what the mind manipulators on TV were telling you. NONE of them.

5358455,3,B009OCR2U6,"I was first intrigued, as it was based on true events. My first thought was of a  perpetrator conducting a twisted version of the Stanley Milgram obedience experiments of the early 60's.

The film starts slow, but once a policeman on the phone prods a manager to detain an employee in the back office, his demands quickly escalated. I was interested in seeing what happened next, how outlandish his demands became and how far any of the people left in charge of watching the young victim would obey.

However, once the story reached the point where the victim is made to strip, the movie became uncomfortable to watch. It wasn't the nudity, but the stripping of her dignity that became the turning point for me. It was here that I felt as trapped as the girl in that back office. Sure, I could have stopped watching, frustrating and helpless as it felt to continue, but I didn't. And the girl's situation only got shockingly worse, finally leaving me that guilty feeling of having been nothing more than a voyeur to another's ordeal.

The ending didn't leave much satisfaction either. The perpetrator is caught, but it happens very quickly, and so easily. Really? This only adds to a seeming imbalance. Most of the movie is concerned with depicting the debasing events in the back office and little concern with the search for justice and the lasting effects on those involved. And not indicated in the movie was that accused was acquitted in the case that seemed to inspire this movie.

I'm inclined to give two stars, but the acting is fair and the movie can still be thought-provoking if you can sit through some very uncomfortable and frustrating stretches.

I could fill this page with ""what the manager should have done"" (starting with verifying that the regional boss was really in contact with the caller); however, to me, the real message here is how easily a person will just assume the validity of a caller because they claimed to be the police.

becky being stripped, searched and ultimately raped is more than just a true story. you can also use it as a metaphor for how this happens to people on psychological/spiritual levels. putting people in tough situations can result in psychosomatic manifestations that will send them to the hospital......learn how to respect the PERSONAL SPACE of others, physically, socially, psychologically, spiritually, etc. beware of people who appear to want to drive you nuts, sometimes they ARE to some extent.........they try to take you over an emotional threshold in hopes that you will crash afterwards so that you will ""calm down"", especially if it leads to an incident where you have to take 'meds', cuz after all isn't 'medicine' good for you??? these people are not your friends, they are no longer 'family' if they try this. they do such things because they are inferior at helping, worthless. if this is their way of 'helping'............ you will be hurt the MOST by those who try to 'help you'.

clearly, everyone who took part in the events lacks a crucial level of intelligence. now, back to everyday life. who are the 'pillars' of your community, family, church? would you like to know that some of them belong to elitistic secret societies? some of those people are dumb, newby schills, others are experts at manipulation who will use their knowledge of your weaknesses (as well as your 'secret sins' that more people know about than you REALIZE). don't let yourself be extorted into hurting others (by 'helping them'). come clean, or at least be prepared to come clean when you don't 'follow orders'. you might save someone's soul (as well as your own). people who crave authority will do so feverishly when they are in trouble and have to 'make good' to get out of dutch. be prepared to defend yourself against them. if you are quick enough to spot who is manipulating the halfwits, wait before........... don't just lash out with emotions.

(9-17-14  the speed-of-life conspiracy is such that often when people are ""trying-to-help"" they are doing what they feel is their 'best' (read: only) option. their lack of flexibility and resourcefulness is a poor excuse for not respecting the personal space of others. I hope this movie leads to some people having the strength to become a happy-hermit..............finding solitude in one's self and regarding human existence as something unfortunate whilst understanding that you could find some opportunities for enjoyment in this trap that engulfs us all. never place absolute trust in ANYONE. doing so gives birth to personal demons that will crush your ability to reason/think. don't be surprised to find out that 'the good people' spend their lives being morally extorted into treating the have-nots poorly, ..........by members of elitistic secret societies. middle class 'nazis'. the 'good people' tell themselves that they have no other choice. the grass isn't greener on the other side, it might APPEAR to be..............for a little while................  I for one, am tired of people trying to scare-me-for-my-own-good. you aren't scaring me, you're pissing me off.

they will get you to trust someone............this trust will be used as a weapon in a group gathering. you will become unsettled in a way that is not possible had you NOT trusted the person they appointed to be one they wanted you to trust. sometimes it will be someone who doesn't know what the plan is. they just need you to trust or CARE about the person whom will be the one that they use as a weapon against you. be a happy hermit.",1390521600,2,4696,5.0529032258064515

Many years ago, pre-internet, I was in a customer service job,  where they trained us that people would call pretending to be police officers. Our response was to ask the officer for his name and department, and tell him we'd call back. We were then supposed to call information for the police department number, call that police department, ask for officer so-and-so, and give him contact information for our corporate legal department. You know, in three years I only called one police department? The rest of those ""police"" callers hung up.

5358510,4,B009OCR2U6,"When people walk out of a film before its conclusion, it is almost always due to graphic sex or violence. The controversial 2012 drama ""Compliance"" has neither and yet, many headed for the exits during its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival. That tells me the film touched an exposed nerve documenting a side of human nature too much to bear. ""Compliance"" is a well-made character study based almost verbatim on a true story.

For almost a decade, a security guard creep prank-called fast-food restaurants impersonating a police officer. He would tell the manager a young female employee had stolen from a customer. Police were busy searching the suspect's home and needed the manager's assistance to strip search the employee in a back room for evidence. ""We'll send an officer over soon and we appreciate your cooperation."" That almost 70 managers followed these ""orders"" is unbelievable. But they did. None more so than a female manager of a McDonald's in small-town Kentucky.

The incident, well-documented by ABC News' ""20/20,"" escalated for almost three hours until a person guarding the young suspect, instructed by the authoritative caller per his instructions, sexually assaulted her. If it were not true, I could barely believe it.

The strength of ""Compliance"" is that every viewer will ask themselves, ""What would I have done in the same situation?"" There are several factors at play in the case and film. Foremost is the soul-sucking grind of working in a fast-food dive. For anyone who has had to produce huge amounts of daily work, they are familiar with the mind-set of falling in line, moving on to the next project without thought. You're trying to reach the end of an exhausting day on a job you have not the slightest interest in doing. Dealing with the nuisance of a policeman on the phone is a distraction to the necessary labor -- just keep pace and provide customer demand. And so, you follow orders without thought because for years, the grind has conditioned you to do so.

I suppose we could question the intellect of a typical fast-food employee (though the reality is the job itself renders all souls identical, no matter the intellect). But let's go a step further. What about the sexual politics between the middle-aged female manager Sandra (Ann Dowd), frumpy and past her prime, and the young teenage woman Becky (Dreama Walker) with multiple men pursuing her? When presented with an opportunity to humiliate, was it not something the manager subconsciously relished? Are we not all driven by the urge to best a rival?

Writer and director Craig Zobel has hinted at all of the above with subtle strokes. In an extraordinary tracking shot, he follows Sandra to her car as she is carrying Becky's clothes completely compliant with the prank caller. Does she even consider the situation, or is her life so powerless she no longer perceives? Dowd gives a wonderful performance in the difficult role of Sandra, a woman suffering from great stress. Someone left the refrigerator open, $1,500 of food has spoiled, and they are short on bacon and pickles. It's a busy night and she's afraid of losing her job.

I was reminded of the famous 1960's Milgram experiments (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Obedience-to-Authority-An-Experimental-View-Perennial-Classics/dp/006176521X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Obedience to Authority: An Experimental View (Perennial Classics)</a>), where subjects at Yale University were asked by a ""doctor"" to give increasingly large doses of electrical shocks to students who gave incorrect answers. It didn't matter students screamed from the next room they were in terrible pain. Almost 70 percent of the time, subjects pressed the button to induce electrical shock following the doctor's orders. Now the entire experiment was fabricated and no one was hurt, with the exception of traumatized subjects in need of serious therapy after being exposed to their darker tendencies (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Behind-the-Shock-Machine-The-Untold-Story-of-the-Notorious-Milgram-Psychology-Experiments/dp/159558921X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Behind the Shock Machine: The Untold Story of the Notorious Milgram Psychology Experiments</a>). The experiment -- as immoral as an experiment could possibly be -- serves as troubling evidence as to the many German soldiers who ""followed orders"" from authority figures when killing hundreds of thousands of humans in the concentration camps.

Certainly ""Compliance"" is a microcosm of such disturbing human nature, an unintentional social psychology experiment where numerous souls ensnared within the endless American wasteland of plastic fast-food cathedrals (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fast-Food-Fast-Talk-Service-Work-and-the-Routinization-of-Everyday-Life/dp/0520085000/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fast Food, Fast Talk: Service Work and the Routinization of Everyday Life</a>) follow orders to the point of destroying lives and careers.

The conclusion of ""Compliance"" is weak, lacking poetic grace, and revealing the prank caller halfway in robs later scenes of tension. But it is a profoundly disturbing work that refuses to coddle American audiences. For a film as quiet as ""Compliance"" to cause people to leave the theater in disgust means a chord has been struck. For that reason alone, it is a tremendous success.",1385337600,2,5441,5.733581164807931

5358513,4,B009OCR2U6,"Some of my review might be considered spoilers if you're not familiar with the story that's supposedly based on actual events.  If you're not familiar with the events, don't read it.  Read my review with caution.

I remember when this story happened a few years ago.  Nobody believed it.  A guy pretending to be a cop calls up a fast food restaurant, accuses the cashier lady of stealing money, says he has the proof but he's too busy to go there himself and the other officers are busy searching the girls home, and that she must do whatever he says because if not, she'll have to spend the night in jail.  So the cop eventually makes her take off her clothes so the other employees can search for the money (because you know women have better hiding spots than men).  She gets raped/molested/humiliated throughout the course of the movie, and *then* it's finally over.  Seriously, it had to reach *that* point before common sense kicked in that this was all an elaborate joke?

I have to say that pigs jumping over the moon, unicorns dancing over rainbows and the Easter Bunny getting into a fist fight with the Tooth Fairy over Christmas decorations seems more believable than this.  However... apparently this event -despite how impossible it is to believe- really did happen so we have to watch Compliance with the understanding these are real events that actually occurred.

To be fair, the cashier girl is only 19 and is presented as an extremely attractive, vulnerable and somewhat clueless girl so perhaps a guy pretending to be a police officer over the phone and forcing her to do whatever he says might seem more believable if you consider the type of girl we're witnessing (unless the REAL victim is significantly different- that I don't know).

However I absolutely *refuse* to believe that the store manager, who's at LEAST 30 years older and supposed to have complete common sense in order to keep a fast food restaurant functionable, would believe for one single second that a man on the other end of the phone is actually a cop and, not only that, she'd actually go along with his instructions on removing the cashier girls clothes to retrieve the stolen money.  Come on!  Of course she was reluctant, but she clearly should have realized it's all a big cruel joke.  Even if you're stressed or exhausted, common sense would tell you this is a prank call.  In fact the store manager, Sandra, wasn't even presented as someone who was very stressed.  She just seemed really clueless much like the cashier girl.  The fact she's older makes her actions even more painful to believe.  Older certainly doesn't mean wiser in this case!

Even worse, when Sandra brings her husband in not only to keep an eye on the girl who's being kept in the back room away from the customers/employees, HE TOO gives in to the cops outrageous rape-like demands and checks the girl for the location of this ""hidden money"".  By this point if it's not 100%, it should be 110% obvious this is a very deranged prank call because even the cop himself begins to pause and stutter as he runs out of believable words to use.  He even starts laughing!  Didn't Sandra's boyfriend hear the laughs?  Didn't he detect the cops instructions were completely fake?  We've all watched cop shows so we know how they operate, right?

Oh right Sandra's boyfriend was drinking again but... 1, that shouldn't matter unless he was flat out drunk because he was clearly sensible/sober enough to understand specific instructions and 2, he definitely didn't appear like he had too many drinks in the movie since he was able to comprehend *all* the instructions given to him.  However the store managers husband *still* goes along with it.  How?  How is this possible?  I personally believe he didn't initially want to touch her, but when he began to grasp the situation and noticed a perfect opportunity to do so, he couldn't refuse.  That's why he ran out of the restaurant without saying goodbye to his girlfriend, Sandra.  Even the other employees who are hard at work eventually realize something suspicious is going on in the back room.  The one employee, Kevin I was believe was his name, knew something was off right from the get go.  He should have stepped up and questioned the cops demands when he had the chance earlier.

Seriously?  A cop calling over the phone concerning an important matter over stolen money?  Several hours go by and *still* no police officer has been dispatched to arrive to the restaurant, even though the police station is only, what was it, a half mile away?  Better find a way to show me your badge first, bud.  Still, it all comes back to the store manager not having the sense to realize this was obviously a prank call.  Plain as day.  She should have hung up the phone right away.  No questions.  Don't even give the guy pretending to be a cop a moment to speak for crying out loud!

Despite my personal feelings and the impossible-to-believe events that apparently took place here, we can't ignore the fact that as a movie, it was interesting and compelling.  I don't know how much of the film really matches the events, but I assume... make that hoping, that some of the more personal things that occur later on were deliberately exaggerated for movie entertainment purposes.

5358515,4,B009OCR2U6,"Many have complained about how unbelievable this story is; many others have countered with the fact that COMPLIANCE is based on a string of incidents that actually happened several years back. The very fact that this film has generated so much controversy and made people stop to wonder ""What would _I_ have done?"" says a great deal in its favor.

Yes, you would think that someone would eventually get the bright idea to at least call the local police or the restaurant's district manager to verify that ""Officer Daniels"" is for real, especially when his directions become entirely perverse. COMPLIANCE is another reminder of the old saw that truth is stranger than fiction: This story would be absolutely ludicrous if it were NOT closely based on actual events.

Pros:

--Good script and acting, especially by Dowd, Walker,and Philip Ettinger. Their tones of voice, postures, and facial expressions are captured very well. These actors act and react just as people would under these circumstances.

--Pretty gripping storyline, and the admonitory message of the film is not so heavy-handed that it destroys the tension and basic watchability.

--The irony of how young, unreliable Kevin and Harold the simple-minded janitor are the only ones to immediately see the absurdity of the situation-- while the more ""responsible"" adults just do as they're told--is not lost.

--No prolonged views of Becky during the strip-search. While this omission may disappoint some folks, gratuitous nudity would have completely killed the film's integrity.

Cons:

--As stated, the whole story is compelling, but at the same time, COMPLIANCE has that patchy flavor that so many low budget Indies have. It often seems more like a rough draft than a final one.

--The search and all the going back and forth over the phone get a bit ponderous after a while. A little less here and a little more on the aftermaths for everyone involved would have made this good film better.",1383523200,,1956,5.049689440993789

Unfortunately, the prankster's voice and dialogue comes nowhere near passing this level of scrutiny.  Even the most insecure fast food manager or employee would have hung up on him.  They should have used a stronger actor and dialogue with a deeper understanding of police procedure.  I wasn't buying it.",1383523200,,505,4.964285714285714
5358517,4,B009OCR2U6,"I first thought the film was unlikely to be inspired by true events, despite having a vague memory of reports of such incidents.

I was wrong. The events portrayed in the film are a close match to what happen in the Mt. Washington Kentucky MacDonalds in 2004.
If one Goggles Mt Washington Kentucky MacDonalds prank you can read ABC News reports of the convictions and of the 6 million dollar legal victory of the actual victim, as well as view 20/20 video of interviews with those involved, including portions of censure security tape of what rational people could only consider to be three hours of mental and physical torture of the victim.

I suspect that if the filmmakers had the agreement of the victim and Macdonalds (highly unlikely)  Compliance could have been made as a documentary that would have won raves at Sundance.

I was aware of the research concerning how easy people comply with perceived authority while in college 40 years ago and certainly aware, even earlier as a draftee in the Army, that the lack of common sense is all too common at all levels and people that behave stupidly under stress usually results from a two digit IQ or unreal inflated belief in their skills and ability.

I would urge those that view Compliance to suspend disbelief and only confirm the reality the film was based on only after viewing the film, if, as I was, unable not to yell at the unrealistic stupid actions of the fast food manager character and feel helpless rage at strange perverted actions of the character of the managers boyfriend while viewing the film. I admit suspending disbelief in the existence of the caller police officer character was almost impossible for me because his motivation defied any understanding.

If one realizes that there are indeed, as in the case of the actual victim in 2004, rural high school seniors, barely 18, desperate for even a fast food job to support a mother without a job, holding religious tinge cultural values of intense respect for adult authority, and actually lacking the brash defiant confidence of most young women, then one can understand why the victim character behaved as she did.

The actors did a fine job, especially the actress portraying the young victim, who had the most difficult task of being a character so unlike the personality that any successful young actress must have in order to actually win a leading role in a film. The writers task of defining the victim character was even more difficult because, I suspect, the thoughts of such victims are uniquely individual and interior, which often results in emotional shut down that visually difficult to convey in words, let alone by emotional display of the actor.

I am a fan of most horror films (Zombies, vampires, and supernatural evil), science fiction, and most gore films (even the first Feast film), even if Rest Stops, motels, Hostels, feral people, and trips overseas now rise concerns, and a fan of all versions of Spit on your Grave and Last House and, of course old school Freddy and Jason. I can even handle Jack Ketchums films with the exception of THE GIRL NEXT DOOR, which I could only view with the commentary track running to maintain emotional distance.

From that point he issues a series of quite frankly absurd  instructions which the manageress and some of the staff comply with.

I can't fault the film as such, the cast do a good job with what they have. It tells the story well and effectively, however the real problem is the stupidity of it. It's hard to comprehend how ridiculous the events are. Anyone with any sense wouldn't have obeyed if the policeman had been stood in front of them, let alone an unidentified voice over the phone.

5358535,1,B009OCR2U6,"A real story or not, this story is more meant to be a dark comedy than an actual drama, because the two main characters are borderline mentally disabled. So let's summarize the depth of the movie in its entirety here:

""An unbelievably dumb and naive pair of women listen to someone who simply claims to be a police officer. Over the phone. Yes, over the phone. They believe every word he says and do everything he says, no matter how blatantly outrageous and in every way would never even be close to reasonable for anyone, because hey, he says he's a cop. Which makes absolutely no sense to anyone.""

Seriously, the plot ends right where it begins. A police officer explains something over the phone and that he needs her ""help"". He feeds her enough BS ""Call me officer!"" and ""Don't tell anyone!"" that's fit more for a Crank Yankers routine than a freaking drama.

Pro tip for common sense: Cops don't call over the phone asking a civilian to do a single thing he asks. He isn't present, and thus can't prove he's a cop. He also isn't present for something this allegedly ""major"" trouble Rebecca is in. So, uh, the guy's apparently a good prank caller, and these two women never, at any point in the entire ordeal, ask the obvious question, ""Can you prove this isn't a prank call?"" This has never been done before in the history of anything, ever. Everything this ""officer"" claims is totally unprovable and wildly not-cop-like.

Not that any of that matters at all. The second the caller says he's an officer is when the conversation would end. That's it. That's the end of the tension. The police don't operate by proxy, because they're apparently too busy to deal with this ""serious situation"" with even one police officer. It makes absolutely no difference what he says. He can say whatever he wants. But unless he's there, *NO ONE* is obligated to a single thing until he shows up.

So, hey, if you're dumb enough to fall for one of the oldest prank calls ever done by anyone (Do you think this is the first time someone's pranked someone by claiming to be an officer and asking for equally astonishingly outrageous things?), you deserve to go through all this, because you'd need to be naive and ignorant on a level so supernatural to not even think that NONE OF THIS MAKES ANY SENSE WHATSOEVER.

You don't need to be an expert on the police, or even have experience with the police, to have the thought, ""Hey, is there some reason no one's come here themselves to question her, and the 'backup'--apparently because you can't be too careful when raiding a fast-food joint for a freaking teenage girl on the job who is the least threatening person, ever, of all time--didn't just come here first?""

It's not like she had any intentions of fleeing the country. The ""officer"" claims to have surveillance footage of some sort perfectly describing Rebecca. Rebecca obviously has no intention of leaving whatsoever.

Whether or not this was based on a true story and how accurate it is, this is a freaking comedy posing as a serious drama. Every character here is stupid. I know movie characters are often stupid, but this doesn't just cross the line of total ignorance, it's obviously absurd. No one, not one person, not even Kevin--the single character who initially appears to have a working brain--questions the incredible and stunningly obvious absurdity of the situation.

This is a movie that, like cheap horror flicks, relies on incredibly stupid characters who can't even think as far ahead as to realize anyone can say they're an officer. Every single person buys it. Everyone, 100%, no questions asked. When even someone with the intelligence of a teenager might think to ask, ""How do you know this guy's a cop by talking over the phone? And do you seriously think anyone's been asked to do any of this in the history of 'police procedure'?"" How far gone do you have to be to not even *question* this?

Maybe if they even had a single scene of someone questioning this guy, that *might* make it a little more acceptable. But there is no bump in the transition of ""I'm an officer, fetch the one who's an alleged thief. Be sure to tell everyone about it who isn't involved in the slightest, nor are they required to be involved at any point (guess what, the police do their own work!), and I'm officer Daniels, that's all you will know about me, you can hand the phone to anyone because I realize everyone's this insane, you can do strip searches over the FREAKING PHONE, and my only problem is that I can't get any officers there to actually do anything, so why don't you do these things that you aren't even allowed to do, even if an 'officer' tells you to do it?""

Unbelievable. But not unbelievable in the entertaining way, just in the, ""You can't be serious. This is the plot? That's it? This is how it starts and continues on as more and more people get involved, and I get much more hostile and threatening than any officer would *EVER* be?""

I'll tell you what happens when I get a call about something this ridiculous, and believe me, it's relatively common for almost any place. If it's profit-oriented (such as, ""Our network says your computer's infected. Here's what you need to do...OR ELSE."" it's typically aimed toward senior citizens, and not someone like me, who works (not to their knowledge) in medical data security. I take the call, act involved, and try to trace the source (and not with movie equipment that takes 30 seconds flat, just a little something called caller ID that, um, works instantaneously when the call arrives. Sometimes these schemes are so short-sighted, they don't even bother with a private number), and then report it to the police. That's how it works.

I can't say I've ever been called by someone claiming to be an officer. But I really don't think I need to, since I've been called by people who aren't who they claim to be all the time. But I know one thing, and one thing that seems obvious: The police doesn't phone in their arrests. In fact, if anything, a real officer would tell you to stay the hell out of it if they aren't present, and simply wait until they arrive. You, yourself, are *their* problem, not the other way around, short of being the victim in an armed home invasion, in which case they tell you, if possible, to hide, or if that's not possible, to do every single thing the other party tells you. Because that's how it's always worked in the history of everything. If someone calls claiming to be an officer, guess what? You tell the real police about it. That's common sense. I like to think most people have it to some reasonable extent.

But uh, sorry, cops don't do arrests--much less convictions--over the freaking phone. Get the Mystery Science Theater 3000 crew, this film goes up there as ""one of the worst films ever made"", without question. It has no right to be taken seriously by anyone, and the very presumption that it should is insulting. Total trash.

5358553,3,B009OCR2U6,"This is based on true events but I'd like to see the details of those events as well as the outcome because this did not allow me to suspend my disbelief.

Here's the scoop. It' s a busy, short-handed, Friday night at a fast food chicken joint in Ohio. The manager gets a call from a policeman saying he is with a woman who says one of the employees (Becky) of the place stole money out of her purse. He cannot spare an officer to get there so he asks the manager to help in the investigation. Through a combination of flattery and mild threats he gets the manager, and a few others, to take Becky through a series of humiliating, and patently illegal, procedures to get to the bottom of things.

I wanted to like this. And I know of some of the experiments that have been conducted that show how people will bend to authority, but I just didn't believe this. The caller was lucky in that the manager with whom he was dealing was real milquetoast. I'd like to think that someone with more spine wouldn't have caved so easily. As a matter of fact, there is only one young guy who smells something fishy and an old fix-it guy who knows something is wrong and refuses to comply. Everyone else involved towed the line. There was one defining moment, when the caller asks a particular question of the manager's boyfriend who is lending a hand, that should have thrown up red flags the size of Texas, but he proceeded to do as he was told.

This all looks very natural. The actors do a decent job and the viewer feels as though he's in on an actual event. The fast food joint setting looks as it should. The opening shots show various things that are in disrepair. Things, like our society, that are breaking down, so it's a cautionary tale to be sure. And the post script says this was one of 70 similar events that took place around the country. They allude to the fact that this one caller may have perpetrated all 70 events. But this needed a better script. I'm not saying this isn't plausible. It just isn't plausible the way it's presented here.",1378080000,,2045,4.362204724409449

5358576,5,B009OCR2U6,"Phone prank gets a movie, and not just a movie but an involved, deep and well made movie. I can see why ""Compliance"" gets mixed reviews with many saying they shut it off early because I almost did turn it off also. The movie starts out dumb witted about teens at a fast food joint. But I recognized the blonde gal.. yes that is Dreama Walker from the failed TV sitcom. ""B In Apt 23"". So I kept watching because of her. Does she have any acting chops I wanted to know. But even with her I really felt like turning this off. This is such an odd movie, which pushes one's patience and critical judgments. First act fooled me into thinking this is a poorly written, badly acted exercise of some sort of public service announcement about tragic `true events'. But what really turned me off was the annoying supervisor whom I didn't like from the offset and throughout (Ann Dowd). But my stop button finger never hit stop I think because this movie kept teasing me. ""We need to strip search Ms. Walker"" Huh? Really? So I kept watching. And kept watching I did with my eyes in wonder at how far this goes and rewarded with something I was not expecting from the start. A multi-faceted, really well acted, intense indie art film.

I think while watching this, and resigning myself to keep watching this after some debate, it's hard not to notice the nervy lack of logic of the script. Why are these people doing this? What are the motivations? Why such trust in this caller who said he is the police that is making a mockery of these people and keeps making a mockery of them. There is a disconnect of the question of 'why' that is distracting and does amount to the question of trust one would have in this movie. I started to not care about these people because they are being so stupid. However there is a big kicker to all this. My wavering trust, my logic in general gets put aside as I choose to give in, suspend my disbelief. Once I do a funny thing happens which is not unlike Dreama Walker's character. I resign myself to this world. Once the end credits start rolling I realize that I may have just seen an important film, acted by strong actors, directed my someone who just hoodwinked me and really did know what he was doing all along. My initial disbelief turned. I started to appreciate the makers of this film and saw it as a process of remarkable success in the details. I was educated about real events of this movie was based, but I don't think that is the true message of this movie. The PSA aspect of this movie is really a side player to the craft of filmmaking and acting. Dreama Walker herself and her character becomes such a intermediate role of this film. She is the epicenter of a multi-layered circle which turns her into a object of desire by many. Will she really take her top off I asked. I had to keep watching to find out...

Usually in great acting roles, you may know the actor from other films but he or she is so good at acting they make you forget about previous roles and convince you they are the person they are, in any role. In `Compliance', the opposite happens with Dreama Walker. This is not a knock on her acting, but the more this movie progressed it stopped being about her character and more about the actual actor and real person. Dreama (spoiler alert) really does strip and stands there naked (for the most part). A real director and film crew really is recording her with a real camera. There really was, much like the plot of the script, negotiations of how far Dreama will go, how much will she take off. It was at some point during pre-productions contracted with Dreama herself. As Dreama's character is de-humanized she too must feel that vulnerability. Because not only is the director, film crew and actors gazing at her so am I.  Dreama becomes a object of beauty to gawk at by the other characters in the plot and the audience. Dreama's beauty becomes centrist to all involved. (As a side note: Dreama has a natural beauty on many levels but her hair is remarkable. A truly beautiful long mane of blonde locks.)

So I got suckered, teased into watching this, but feel rewarded at the end by a film that folds onto itself. The PSA aspect gets lost until there is a 5 second factoid at the very end about how many times this prank has really happened. I suppose there is something to learn about the truism of this odd crime. You couldn't make this film as pure fiction, but for me the PSA aspect is not the whole motivation. This is a tricky film on many levels. Dreama is the center but oddly it's not only her that makes it succeed, it's the actors around her that do. There is so many points that this movie could have failed. This film is depended on good acting. It's tricky because the first half is written kinda lame brain about stupid teens at a stupid fast food joint ran by stupid people.  It's actually written poorly and I mean written poorly ON PURPOSE. This is important, I think a rouse to make you think this is a poorly written movie not worth your attention but the opposite is true.

Ann Dowd who plays a restaurant supervisor is annoying from the beginning. I didn't like her, or her logic. Thought she was just stupid in intelligence. If you can get over this and make it to the end, you realize her character she is playing really is annoying and stupid. Most importantly Ann Down's character is culpable to the crime, along with her no good creepy husband. Who are these people? Was this a scam for them just to see Dreama in the buff? Is this entire movie a scam to get Dreama in the buff? I think these things only because these roles by Dreama and those around her are so well acted. There is a balancing act going on between the crime and the motivation and the actors played this tricky stuff really well inside a directors vision..It's not Ann Down who is stupid; it's her character that is and she convinces us of her stupidity through good acting skill. But there is a real movie being made before your eyes, an artistic craft by all involved, a risky endeavor by Dreama who puts her career on the line.

Overall the more I think about the difficulties of this movie, the nudity of Dreama, the supporting actors, the tricky script, the directors vision and pulling it all together, the more I think this is a important film, and a art film at that. I understand people turning this movie off, I almost did myself, but the criticisms of poor acting are way off. Look deeper and you will find a lot more here of depth and accomplishment on many levels.. It's a parallel reaction, as Dreama's character becomes resigned by the circumstances so too the viewer is. Once some logic is suspended, like by the characters themselves, it's revealed a very well made movie. As I said earlier of my review, this is not so much an exercise in storytelling, rather of filmmaking and the art of acting.",1375833600,,6873,4.419889502762431
5358591,1,B009OCR2U6,"I am proposing that this Blu-ray disc be boycotted. The Blu-ray format relies heavily on scripting, so much so that the producer of a disc has almost unlimited control over the way that the player behaves, when the disc is played. Unfortunately, some Blu-ray producers with compromised ethics exploit this in a way that consumers should find intolerable, and should simply refuse to accept. Consumers had no voice in defining the Blu-ray specification, and if they had, it almost certainly would have been done in a way that would insure that when you put a disc in the player, you are able to access the movie and the menus without having to first play your way through a bunch of previews. If they want to put promotional material of this sort on the disc, the right way to do that is to make them a special feature, accessible through the disc's main menu the same as all the other special features on the disc. Many Blu-ray discs do this. The way put previews on a disc is NOT by doing it in a way such that they have to be played through before you can even access the main menu for the disc. And even if the control buttons for fast-forwarding and stepping through the previews are enable, this still does not make it acceptable to put the previews in the disc in this manner. A couple of times while watching this movie, I accidentally hit the stop button on my remote. I was not even able to resume play, and this as well is a fault of the way the disc was produced. I should have been able to resume, but was not able to do even that. Instead, I had to start over, much as though I had just inserted the disc. I had to sequence back through the previews all over again, and then bunch of other short video segments, such as the one that it promotional for DTS sound, all of which are accompanied by individual scripts that the player has to locate in order to load. It took several minutes in total to get back to where I was, and this is with a newer, fast player with a good reputation for being a fast player. I shudder to think what this would have been like on my older Pioneer Blu-ray player (which was a piece of junk). Each and every time you decided to watch this disc, you have to go through this all over again. It should not be this way. This disc was produced by people who had no sense of ethics.

I'll keep it short here:
I appreciated the coldness of the filming style and the real world ""texture"" given to the restaurant and it's employees; the characters weren't glossy magazine models, but real world.
The topic of compliance is quite interesting here and what I find important is not the actual story, but the unquestioning, accommodating mindset of the average American giving the compliance in the face of any authority, legitimate or not. It wasn't until the end of the film that someone had the wherewithal to question and refuse the authority due to basic moral offenses... yes basic. Compliance is the sibling to complacency. Together they are the perfect recipe for facilitating (read:creating) the monstrous abuse of power today. This film gets at the core of part of this problem, us.

5358597,4,B009OCR2U6,"American screenwriter, producer and director Craig Zobel`s second feature film which he wrote and co-produced, is inspired by multiple real events. It premiered in the out-of-competition NEXT section at the 28th Sundance Film Festival in 2012, was shot on location in USA and is a US production which was produced by producers Sophia Lin, Lisa Muskat, Tyler Davidson and Theo Sena. It tells the story about a manager at a fast food restaurant in suburban Ohio, USA who one day at work receives a call from a police officer who tells her that he is with a customer who has reported her employee named Becky of theft and that she will have to keep her there until the police comes to get her.

Distinctly and engagingly directed by American filmmaker Craig Zobel, this finely paced fictional tale which is narrated from multiple viewpoints, draws an unsettling portrayal of an administrator who all though doing her duty after learning that a woman has accused one of her colleagues of committing a crime and to an extent questions what she is being ordered to do, complies to absurd directions. While notable for its naturalistic and mostly interior milieu depictions, fine cinematography by cinematographers Adam Stone and Scott Gardner and production design by production designer Matthew Munn, this dialog-driven and narrative-driven story about a conniving and vicious prank which is commanded, taken far beyond the limits and turned in to an exercise in deviating human behaviour by an antagonist`s morbid mind depicts a refined study of character and contains a timely score by composer Heather McIntosh.

This sociological, psychological, situational and atmospheric thriller about authority and crime which is set in a fast food restaurant in America on a busy Friday where an affianced middle-aged woman becomes unconditionally obedient when she receives instructions from a caller who claims to be a policeman, is impelled and reinforced by its cogent narrative structure, subtle character development, efficient continuity, mindful examination of its central theme and the fine acting performances by American actresses Ann Dowd and Dreama Walker and American actors Philip Ettinger, Bill Camp and Pat Healy.

Becky(Dreama Walker) is the antithesis of everything Sandra beholds.  A counter girl at the fast food restaurant they both work at Becky is beautiful, bright, and perky. You can see Sandra quietly seethe everytime she walks past her.  It's like revisiting high school with Sandra the outsider and Becky the popular girl.  When a phone call to the restaurant comes in identifying himself as ""Officer Daniels""(Pat Healy) who says that Becky has stolen from a customer and must be detained until the police get there Sandra unhesitatingly complies and takes Becky to a storage room.  With the good officer still on the line he gives Sandra outrageous instructions that she is more than willing to abide by. In the process Becky is humiliated by a series of violations both mental and physical culminating in a sexual assault on her person by Sandra's dopy boyfriend(Bill Camp).  Any number of questions cross your mind during the course of the film.  Primarily you wonder why Sandra doesn't ask for credentials or at least question Daniels' unorthodox requests.  Why doesn't Becky resist? The only logical reason you can think  is her resistance is so beaten down that she has no choice but to go with the program.  And why is Sandra's boyfriend on the scene at all?  Amazingly this all takes place with dozens of people in the building.  Daniels is the worst kind of evil.  He's the kind who casually makes a sandwich while totally debasing another human just for the fun of it.  You can only return to the old response the citizens under the Third Reich used to give that they were only following orders.  ""Compliance"" is a provocative film without being exploitative.

Ann Dowd (Sandra the Mgr) is incredible as the overworked stressed out boss of a fast food chain who is so worried about losing her job or being reprimanded by ""Regional Management"" or the police that she willingly participates in the sexual assault of Becky.  While watching this movie it's easy to imagine that you would never do anything so stupid. Sadly the fact that the story is true more than 70 times in the US proves that we are that stupid.  The most difficult to watch is Becky going along with her own demeaning assault.

This was a very thought provoking movie that wasn't at all slow.  I believe that part of stretching those store room scenes out is what makes the movie so provocative.

5358646,4,B009OCR2U6,"To say that the movie COMPLIANCE is upsetting is an understatement. It's not just the movie itself that disturbs you while watching it but the fact that it is supposed to be based on a true story. Knowing that something like this could have happened makes you wonder just what people are willing to do without allowing morals to kick in.

The movie takes place at a fast food restaurant where manager Sandra (Ann Dowd) is having a problematic day. Nothing seems to be going right, they're short handed and the usual customer complaints are happening. She then gets a phone call from the police telling here that one of her employees has stolen something from a customer. The policeman tells here that they're on their way there but to hold the employee, Becky (Dreama Walker), in the back until they can get there while he stays with her on the phone.

Not thinking anything is wrong with this, Sandra takes Becky to the back office/store room to wait for the police, talking to her about what's going on. Becky insists she's innocent. The policeman on the phone asks Sandra to search Becky which she's not quite comfortable with but does. This is when it begins to get bad. The policeman then asks Sandra to strip search Becky, insisting that she remove every article of clothing she's wearing.

Now some of us would refuse to do so, but the question raised by this film is what happens when someone complies with what the person on the phone tells them to do? In the case here it turns out, and we the viewers already know, that the man isn't an officer at all but a prank caller who gets off making calls like this. But Sandra does as he says, humiliating Becky in the process who must stand there naked until she's given something to wear.

As the film progresses the ""officer"" continues to have Sandra as well as other members of the staff follow his instructions. Sandra never considers calling her home office or district manager; in part because it's the weekend and she knows her DM is busy at the moment. But to think that she would follow these instructions, odd as they may seem, is a terrifying thing to consider. All the while I kept wondering why they continued to obey and not seriously question the ""officer"" when no one showed after several hours.

The movie is a chilling experience to watch and an uncomfortable one as well, but that doesn't make it a movie that isn't worth watching. The acting is credible and that's more important than anything with a film like this. You truly believe that these people are caught up in obeying the voice of authority that they trust no matter what they are asked to do. These requests begin as simple ones but eventually lead up to a most horrifying demand that makes you wonder what these people were thinking to listen to this.

I'm sure this film is designated as a drama but in truth I consider it a horror film of sorts. There are not monsters with fangs or claws, there are no ghosts or mangled revenge seeking stalkers, there are simply normal everyday people placed into a situation of being told what to do and blindly following. The monsters here are us and that makes the acts witnessed here truly terrifying.",1372118400,,3178,4.566666666666666

5358648,5,B009OCR2U6,"That this film was borne of controversy when it premiered at Sundance in early 2012 piqued my interest. What sort of subject matter could provoke shouting matches at a Q&A session of a festival meant to celebrate artistic expression? I read up on the movie and the incidents on which it was based and soon found out.

I had been half-way avoiding watching the film until now, as there no plot twists left for me to discover and the circumstances terrible. My first impression after seeing the movie, knowing that 70 similar incidents occurred in the US between the late 90s and mid-2000s, was that it was terribly realistic.

It's easy to take for granted how well the actors portrayed their characters: (save for the antagonist) all average Americans, some of below-average intelligence, but all basically good at heart. The maxim that good things happen to bad people plays out to full effect.

Watching the movie, I was half clinically detached, cognitively focused on and fascinated by the same psychology behind the public of Nazi Germany and the infamous Milgram experiment not more than two decades later repeating itself. This road to hell was indeed paved with good intentions, the Devil's work ever subtle, insidious, and, at first, seemingly innocuous.

The side of me emotionally involved in the film watched it like a slowly unfolding nightmare; the conclusion was foregone, but that didn't stop me from hoping desperately that it was going to turn out some (any!) other way. The plot was essentially a play-by-play of one of the aforementioned events that actually occurred.

I write this review now a day after watching it, and I am haunted by the faces of lives shattered. Something I am still trying to wrap my head around is assessing the varying degrees of victimhood experienced by many of the characters, balancing innocence and guilt in relative measures. I am truly sad for all of them.

The film: speaks to a flaw to which we as humans clearly still possess and about which we need remain vigilant lest we fall into the same trap once again; captured acting that allows the viewer to forget that the people on screen were actually paid to be there; and is capable of leaving an impression at once fascinating and heartbreaking. And, mind you, perhaps none of this will come immediately to mind because the film is so subtle in style and modest in setting.

5358701,4,B009OCR2U6,"What makes authority? How do you know someone is in charge, that they're someone to listen to? And how far would you go in order to obey someone who you think is in charge? These are the questions asked by the 2012 release from Magnolia Pictures, Compliance. Based on true events, it is a harrowing and disturbing look at how far someone will go to cooperate with a purported authority.

Set in a fast food restaurant, the movie introduces the harried manager, Sandra, and her employees, including Becky, a 19 year old. After a brief set-up of relationships and basic personality traits, the conflict is begun when Sandra receives a phone call from someone who claims to be a police officer. He says that there has been a complaint from a customer that Becky has stolen money from her purse, and that she needs to follow his instructions in order to facilitate the investigation. What starts as an unusual, if not entirely out of line, series of inquiries and requests quickly escalates further and further into areas that are unconventional, illegal, and personally devastating. What happens from there well, the whole game cant be given away.

As the film goes on, the frame seems to tighten, the whole enterprise becoming more and more claustrophobic. The invasion of privacy and actions become more and more extreme, until they become sexual assaults, all at the instruction of the police officer on the phone. Any time an objection is raised, he uses the power and fear of authority to keep the situation in his control, relying on the various players compliance to further his own twisted goals.

The film is disturbing, there is no question. I myself had problems watching it, as it made me feel extremely uncomfortable, and it was very hard to finish. Its not a bad film, not at all. Its well-made, acted, and written. The only problem I have is that no one seems to be thinking clearly. Theres clear signs that everything isn't on the up and up, unprofessional behavior on the part of the officer and certain phrases and words used. But the ones who say anything are shushed up or ignored. I feel like going outside the restaurant, showing the caller in his own element, is a misstep. Keeping him separate, just a voice on the phone, wouldve ratcheted up the tension, as the audience would never be entirely sure if he was a real officer or not.

I highly recommend watching it, if for no other reason than to appreciate the terrible possibilities created by a normal person's desire to obey authority and a psychopath's desire to take advantage of that compliance.

Then think about what happens when politicians start making threatening noises about threats to national security.

Dreama Walker (from ""Don't Trust the B_____ in Apartment 23"")  and long suffering character actress Ann Dowd, star in this movie based on a true incident. Here's what happens, on a busy night, someone claiming to be a cop calls a small town fast food joint to talk with the manager. He gives the manager his credentials and tells her that the cute little blonde girl that works there.. stole from a customer. He then asks her to bring her to the back room and start interrogating her. Next, he asks her to search her belongings, then strip search her and keep her virtually jailed in the back room. Sadly, from there it gets worse. It sounds unbelievable, but this incident actually happened in a small-town McDonalds (as well as several other places).

It's a small low-budget film, but those are things that actually add to the realism of the film, almost giving it a documentary like quality.

I remember reading something about this story, but it was many news reports that I read, quickly thought about, then quickly dismissed because it didn't happen close to home. In addition to reading about it, the movie painted a picture to what happened to the individual/s and the outcome of it was the sicko was caught. Unfortunately it had happened several times too many before he did get caught. There are individuals out there who have nothing better to do but to cause harm and humiliation towards others for no other reason but to satisfy their own gratification. Many is done in the most perverse way. I truly did feel sorry for the real girl this happened to and Dreama Walker, played the part well. She made me feel sad as well as angered towards the caller. I Youtubed the story on this and when I saw Louise Ogborn (the actual individual it happened to) tell her story it really broke my heart, because she looked so young and innocent. Because of this incident she may have a trust issue the rest of her life. I sincerely hope she overcomes this ordeal and lead a normal life. All I can say is that there should of point where her supervisor should of realized that there was something terribly ""not right"", even under the circumstances of being busy at the restaurant. This is not excusing her, but it is safe to say that we are all human and we all make mistakes. This is her big ""mistake"". I could kinda see where she felt she was doing the right thing by following the orders of an authoritative figure, but there should of been some sort of intuition that could have kicked in letting her know.

5358738,4,B009OCR2U6,"I watched this despite the negative reviews because I remember this case that the movie was based on, and others related to it, and I've always been very interested in Milgram's experiments and how we relate to authority. I don't think this movie deserves these negative reviews.

The main thrust of the negative reviews seems to be that the story is not believable and is difficult to watch. It is hard to believe, but this is a very faithful retelling of the Louise Ogborn case, all of which was captured (as in the movie) on the office surveillance cameras. It is faithful right down to the details of the coworkers who knew this was wrong but would not really get involved and the maintenance man at the end who is finally the guy who makes the manager see that this isn't right. I remember when the Ogborn story broke; it is incredible that people would behave this way, and yet we know that the majority actually do (it was about 2/3 in the Milgram study, if I remember correctly, although in this particular series of cases, there seem to have been more fast food managers who refused to go along than those who did obey, although there were still very many who obeyed, a few even with real zeal).

Second, it is difficult to watch. Even though I already knew what happened to Ogborn, represented here by the ""Becky"" character played by Dreama Walker (and the director, again, did not really embellish it; on the contrary, the ""jumping jacks"" segment of the torture went on somewhat longer in the real case, I think), I found it very difficult to watch comfortably. This has a lot to do with the acting. I thought Walker was very powerful as Becky. You can see her gradually grow more helpless and resigned. Ann Dowd is also very convincing as Sandra, the manager. While you find yourself wondering throughout the film why it does not occur to her that this is wrong, on so many levels, she plays the harried, perhaps not terrifically bright manager quite well, and the moment when she does realize what has happened, Dowd plays perfectly. I can still her see her face as the truth begins to dawn. The actors who play the manager's fiance and the cook who won't make Becky undress do fine jobs, as well.

A few reviewers have also complained that there is no explanation in the film for how such a thing could happen. I don't really know what to make of that complaint. There isn't an overt explanation, and if you are unfamiliar with Milgram and Arendt (among others), then maybe it doesn't make sense to you. But it isn't really true that there is no explanation at any rate. The film shows pretty clearly the pressures that each character was put under, and all of them (weakly) question the orders, at least at first. But the ""cop"" convinces them, appealing to their senses of obeying authority, just getting unpleasant things ""over with"" so as not to further inconvenience anyone, and so on. We are all put under those pressures, every day, and our usual urge is to comply with them, even if what we are supposed to do makes us uncomfortable.

My only beef with the film was that it included several lingering shots of french fries frying and soap bubbles floating in a sink of dishwater and things like that. I didn't think those contributed anything to the film and wasn't sure why they were included. Otherwise, while I doubt I could watch this again, I thought it was a top-notch film.",1367884800,,3401,4.5704918032786885

The true event, of which the film follows faithfully, happened at a Mount Washington, KY McDonald's in 2004 - tracked by real police to David Stewart, a 37year-old employee of Corrections Corporation of America. His pranks span 10 years - Stewart was a wanna-be cop - police found considerable evidence in his house (Stweart was married, with 5 children) - mostly the phone cards and his huge collection of police magazines and training manuals. He ran the prank depicted in this film from Florida. The victim sued McDonalds and eventually ended up with a 6-7 million dollar settlement - the manager also sued and was awarded a smaller settlement. Her fianc ended up in prison. Stewart was acquitted of all charges (the prosecution failed, despite the evidence). Since his arrest, the pranks stopped. This is a great film to watch how autocratic thinkers are so easy to manipulate - film production, especially the cinematography, is excellent - as well as the acting.

The rest writes itself as the demands escalate beyond what one could reasonably accept as procedure (isolating the suspect and searching their belongings).

Where did the criminals come up with such schemes? Most likely the experiments conducted by Stanley Milgram in the 1960s to test how far ordinary people will go when instructed to hurt people (the ""victims"" of this study were confederates who merely acted out the effects of electrocution).

5358792,4,B009OCR2U6,"Manipulation and control is the centre of this story, as we see the shocking humiliation that Becky suffers. The camera is mostly still, the editing is slow and the colourisation is bland, ensuring a 'real' life representation. Instead the tension is held in the script, focussing on the violence of the characters actions and decisions.

The director (Craig Zobel) favours close-ups, drawing the audience into the suffocating and inescapable events that Becky is subjected to. As the audience we may believe that we would have discovered the hoax quicker, but we are privileged with hindsight.

This film questions what makes a villain/victim. Yes the caller is the perpetrator, but he doesn't force them to carry out this abuse. What is classed as free will and how responsible for our actions are we? Compliance is hard hitting film with tough mental and physical violence. It questions human nature, and how the majority can be lead by an 'authority' figure who knows best. It slightly lags at the end, but overall an enjoyable (or rather not so) film.

5358793,4,B009OCR2U6,"In financial services firms, Compliance is the unglamorous but important department that makes sure people follow the firm's policies. One is aimed at preventing ""social engineering"": not, as you might think, checking the viral spread of welfarism across the institution, but rather stopping the systematic theft of commercially sensitive information, carried out in plain sight, by malfeasors who cold-call gullible employees and trick them into volunteering it.

You'd be amazed how easily investment professionals can be suckered. Actually, probably, you wouldn't.

But it's not just investment professionals who can be duped, as Craig Zobel's hair-raising new film makes clear. It hasn't got anything to do with financial services, much less compliance departments, but it has a lot to do with social engineering. Only in this case, it takes place in an Ohio fast food joint, and it takes a much nastier form.

The first thing to say is how well Compliance conveys, in its opening scenes, the deplorable misery of unskilled labour: Sandra (Ann Dowd) manages a busy ChickWich outlet. She's short-handed on the shift, she's expecting an undercover visit from franchise quality control goons, some clot left the freezer open last night spoiling thousands of dollars of food, and to cap it all off, she's badly low on gherkins.

These are monstrous stresses compared with the pittance Sandra is paid. The last thing she needs is for a cop (Pat Healy) to call, reporting a customer's allegation of theft against an employee.

If Sandra is powerless and vulnerable, she's got nothing on Becky (Dreama Walker), a pretty, 19 year old tillhand. Sandra's countenance cannot conceal her resentment of Becky's vitality, which fuels her suspicion that it was Becky who left the freezer open. Sandra is already susceptible to the suggestion that Becky needs firing, and Officer Daniels' call is welcome grist to the mill.

Thus begins the ""compliance"": anxious not to exacerbate an already lousy day, Sandra does Officer Daniels' bidding, and ensures, when he asks for it, that others do too. As befits disenfranchised employees, they all do as they are told, including Becky, who is hauled into a back room and interrogated. Officer Daniels stays on the line and takes a perverse interest in proceedings. Becky denies everything. Well, you would, wouldn't you.

Officer Daniels' behaviour grows more eccentric. We realise that his is a crank call but, like a frog in slowly heating water, Sandra never does.

So commences the second act, an unbroken sequence of unspeakable acts which it would be wrong to reveal, as this comprises a large part of the film's emotional impact. It is not comfortable viewing. Much credit is due to Craig Zobel and his editing team for the technical achievement of building and maintaining an unbearable tension for more than an hour.

As a straight piece of drama, though, the film is less successful. This is a cautionary tale, not a morality play: necessarily, the usual narrative arc is absent. There is a villain, but he is not explained. There is no hero, only victims, and they do not have flaws to overcome which justify their fate. They're gullible, but within a standard deviation of the norm: that's what gives Compliance its power.

There is therefore no challenge to overcome or lesson to learn. These are people without sin, who do not (wittingly) cast stones, yet a stoning nonetheless goes on. It is difficult to know what to take from that: Craig Zobel achieves a valuable social commentary, but not a dramatic one.

That's another way of saying that Compliance is a downer from beginning to end, and while it may leave viewers scratching their chins as they leave the theatre, they'll think twice before doing what a policeman asks in future.

5358796,4,B009OCR2U6,"Some things are so bizarre and so out there that they can only be depictions of real life; right.  I mean, you can't make this kind of stuff up.  Reading on Wikipedia on the entirety of this situation and the extent to which it all went down, this movie really only scratches the surface.  Even at that, it is still disturbing.

`Compliance' tells the story of Sandra, the manager of a fast food restaurant who gets a call from someone claiming to be a police officer.  The man identifies one of Sandra's employees, young Becky, as a thief and has Sandra contain her in the back until he can get an officer to the restaurant.  He then proceeds to convince Sandra to carry out a search of Becky's belongings and then eventually gets her to do some pretty disturbing things, including a humiliating strip search and eventually this leads to poor Becky being sexually victimized by Sandra's drunken fiance.

The fact that all of this really happened, and that it happened more than once (there were many cases of this same impersonator wreaking havoc on fast food restaurants) is unsettling.  Zobel's straightforward direction and knack for atmosphere help propel the film and keep the audience at the edge of their seats.  The central performances by Ann Dowd and Dreama Walker are also outstanding (such layers) and help anchor the film from start to finish.  Dowd is especially great at etching out the insecurities that lurk under Sandra's rough exterior and make her an easy target for the man on the other end.  The way she soaks in his compliments, which makes it all the more easy for her to ignore the warning signs and `do as she's told', just help illuminate us on her plight.  Walker's desperation and eventual compliance are heartbreakingly raw.

My issue with `Compliance' comes in the form of its repetitious nature.  It's a short film, and yet it continues to hit the same notes to the point where it feels longer.  When the final ten minutes strike I found myself wishing that it had hit the finale earlier so that it could have been fleshed out further.  It is a rushed finale that doesn't prove to be as satisfying as it could have been.

Still, the tone is effective and the ensemble makes the most of their respective roles.  It is a very lived in film, feeling raw and realistic despite the absurdity of this reality.",1366156800,,2336,4.65609756097561

I know this movie was based on true events (same thing happening in real life, but at different places) - but it was still hard for me to actually believe that people would not put a stop to what was happening to the girl in this story. I did work at fast food places in the past and it's hard to think that the people I worked with would let this kind of thing go on so long.

5358844,4,B009OCR2U6,"First off, the audience is going to be extremely polarized by this movie - friends who are major movie fanatics are deeply divided on pretty much everything in the film - so don't expect to find much common ground with others in the audience.

Compliance lays bare the unpleasantness of the modern low-wage workplace, the tendency to connect criminal guilt by association, and the deep-seeded desire to comply with instructions, however sadomasochistic, as long as they come from an authority of some sort. It's an unrelenting piece of film-making that knows its truthfulness is going to make it unpopular as the audience is forced to watch a small scale atrocity unfold. It's a blend of the Milgram and Stanford prison experiments and has a factual basis in a strip search prank call that occurred over 70 times throughout the US, and in the way it's depicted here, it's perfectly believable and doesn't seem contrived at all.

The two principal actors are great at maintaining the suspense despite having to carry almost the entire film by themselves. The direction highlights the grimness of both the fast food work environment and the absurd horror that develops. Overall, despite being difficult to watch, it's a film that does stick with you and definitely invites the question of how you would behave given the same circumstances.",1365206400,,1337,5.018018018018018

5358929,4,B009OCR2U6,"Americans like to see themselves as independent, strong, and resolved to defend their freedoms at all costs. The reality, however, is something different. When questioned by authorities, Americans almost invariably submit, relinquishing all rights in an effort to appear ""compliant"", and non-threatening. When selected at a random stop by police, drivers who are asked, ""Can I search your car?"" will comply almost without exception. What can happen after that permission is granted can be the stuff of nightmares.

Yes, Gwendolyn, bad things do happen to good people, and sometimes those bad things are done by otherwise good people.

The events depicted in this movie, shot with a ""raw nerve"" feel, are essentially accurate and should be a wake-up call for all Americans. It is the evidence that we select compliant individuals to carry out the will of those at the top of society rather than promoting the independent, thoughtful, and ethically brave people that we tout.

In the film, as in real life, it took only one man - a brave man - to say ""No"" and stop the horror that was going on. But, by then, several lives were already ruined. This movie conveys the story without imposing a viewpoint. If it suffers from a lack of ""cinema"" it is bolstered by reality. It does not preach - it tells its cautionary tale and allows the viewer to determine for themselves how they will react to it.

If you doubt that you would be so compliant as to go along with such insanity, as those in the movie did - and those in the more than 70 real incidents around the country did - check the content of your local, state, and national laws. No, not the ones being ballyhooed to provide the smokescreen - take a look at the laws that now allow torture and warrantless-searches. And remember this - the leaders who took issue with these and other successful attacks on American freedoms were promptly voted out of office - by the compliant.

A lie is easily told - it is short and understandable. The truth requires work to ferret out, and bravery to defend. No doubt this is why the truth is in short supply. Ask anyone who ""complied"" with going to war with a country that had never been a threat to the United States.

5358959,3,B009OCR2U6,"The fact that this incident actually took place is the main reason I am giving this film a somewhat positive review. I read the U.S.A. Today article on the truth behind this movie and the journalist stated that the crime was accurately depicted- except for the portrayal of the victim. The article said that the young girl involved in the story was, in real life, crying and protesting her treatment throughout the incident. If the film had portrayed her this way, I don't believe many people could have endured the entire thing. As it is, it is hard to watch.

If you are going to watch this film you should be prepared to be frustrated and angry with the people who willingly went along with this malicious prank - and in the process, became worse than the perpetrator himself. I've heard of people drinking lemon detergent or drying their kittens in the microwave but this is a documented incident of truly incredible human stupidity and there were others like it in several states.

The film is subtly photographed in a style that helps set the tone of the story. The director keeps the viewer in squeamish suspense wondering ""How far will this go?"" and ""Where is the voice of reason?""(thank god an actual voice of reason does eventually arrive)....The truly hard questions come AFTER the film, when you will ask ""How could my fellow human beings be so stupid and cold hearted?"" or worse, ""Is ANYONE capable of such willing moral blindness?""

This was a simple and provocative piece - well acted, directed, and produced. The main character is a bit under- responsive for her circumstances - which tends to make you mad at her too.
In the end - the film, as well as the actual crime, reveals a depressing truth about people in our society.

What follows is the most bizarre sequence. I had my thoughts on who the caller might be, but I'll keep that to myself.

The acts the staff had to do to the female employee were unspeakable. But I understand why it needed to be said and the movie needed to be made in the manner in which it was made. I was really glad the abuse stopped when it did.

It ends long after I wish it would've due to the sexual acts one believes is being done to this female employee. Then it follows with a ride to the police station, and court appearances.

5358999,4,B009OCR2U6,"Although supposedly based to some extent on actual events, Compliance (2012), which mostly takes place in a fast food restaurant, quickly becomes ridiculous, but remains entertaining and outrageous, all the way to its numbing conclusion, which seemingly could have, and should have, come about much, much sooner.  The behavior of the characters may have you continually questioning their intelligence, as reality seems to have been suspended.  The acting performances come off as very natural and convincing, despite the remarkably unlikely things that happen, in this film written and directed by Craig Zobel.  Spoilers follow.

Sandra (Ann Dowd), the manager at a Chickenwich restaurant receives a phone call from an Officer Daniels (Pat Healy), who says that he has evidence that a female employee is guilty of theft.  Becky (Dreama Walker) is brought into a back room, and is advised that she is under suspicion.  Accepting Daniel's authority, Sandra agrees to help with the ""investigation"" as he is unable to come to the restaurant.  Fearful of arrest, Becky also complies with what happens, which initially includes being searched, having her clothes removed, and then being detained for the remainder of the day, naked except for an apron.

A turning point occurs when at Daniels' suggestion, Sandra gets her boyfriend Kevin (Philip Ettinger) to come to the restaurant to help.  Left alone to supervise Becky, and in communication with Daniels, Kevin continues the ""investigation"" which progresses to include physical abuse and sexual assault.  Only after these outrages have occurred, does someone really question Daniel's authority, and finally bring the house of cards tumbling down.

Although there are some ties to reality, much of what happens is more of a twisted fantasy, as Compliance appeals to certain dark proclivities, and then takes you along for a ride.  It is revealed early on that Daniels is a scammer, so the provocative question becomes, how sick are things going to get?  With that dangling out there, it's easy to overlook the film's many flaws, just to see what that answer is.  Matters conclude at Chickenwich rather quietly, as the focus at the end is almost entirely on Sandra, while Becky, Kevin, and Daniels fade into the background.  Sandra emerging cleanly seems a bit ironic, seeing  that she is culpable in much has occurred.

Subjected to any kind of serious scrutiny, Compliance soon becomes ludicrous.  Why does almost everyone believe Daniels, and carry out his instructions like robots, instead of questioning them, or simply lying to him?  Following his directions for a short time might be plausible, but the incident is prolonged for many hours, and reaches extremes that test ethical and moral boundaries.  Does is seem credible that Becky would sit around naked all day and into the night?  Sandra calls her boyfriend for help, yet she never calls her supervisor or the police department.  The focus on work by the Chickenwich staff is remarkable, as apparently except for Sandra, no one communicates with anyone to discuss what is happening.

Fast food restaurants are almost universal, so the setting and operations seem very familiar, even to those who have never worked in one.  Although many scenes involve people just having phone conversations, the acting performances are quite good, and really help to sell a story that is absurd at times.  Ann Dowd is convincing as a harried and confused manager, who is in way over her head, and Dreama Walker (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seven-Deadly-Sins/dp/B003VMFX4C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seven Deadly Sins</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vamperifica/dp/B00857XASE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vamperifica</a>) is excellent, in a role where she is repeatedly abused and degraded.

Putting aside its faults, Compliance is a compelling watch, particularly when it becomes clear that a fraud is being perpetrated.  Watching the slow side into disaster, is a sick kind of fun.

Mid-way through the movie, I actually had to pause it and look up the actual events.  I assumed that they had taken some very generous liberties with the ""based on real events"" tagline.  I wanted to know exactly how much was being exagerrated and how much of the story was outright false.  I don't even know if I can describe what I felt upon reading the true events and realizing that what I was seeing on screen actually WAS the true events with no embellishment.  How do we explain the actions of those involved?  Why would an 18yr old girl submit herself to increasingly degrading acts solely on the instruction of a stranger on the phone?  Why would a mature adult blindly follow the caller's demands for so long a time?  I'm at a loss as to how seemingly intelligent people willingly threw all common sense out the window.  The caller's demands are not rational in any way to anyone watching this film, and yet they're accepted as normal and logical.  The caller's excuses as to why he cannot be there in person are not rational in any way, yet they're accepted as normal and logical.
I was taught to respect and obey law enforcement officers, but I was also taught to think for myself.  One moment of pause and clear thinking SHOULD have made all involved question what they were doing.  I tend to think that the manager's fiancee had issues prior to this - nobody would commit such acts simply because a voice on the phone told them too.
The maintenance man, a gentleman in his early retirement-age years, was the ONLY one in the entire building to question what was happening?

I have to admit I did watch this movie to its end.  However, the only reason for doing so was it being late at night and I was viewing online via Kindle Fire.  If I had been watching on regular glube tube or dvd, I would have walked mid-way through.

I find it very hard to believe there are folks among us in ""fast food"" services that are just this silly and ignorant.  In fact, honestly, I came away with a ""not so good"" feeling about people working at these establishments.  I do not want to categorize any group of working Americans, but this movie did nothing but display the level of education, and intellect of folks cooking those burgers and fries at the good ole' American icons.  You know the ones as they are American icons so to speak.  Go Mickey D, and their dear ole' competitors.

Folks, this is suppose to be a documentary of real events.  As such, then great, maybe we can believe this actually did happen.  Do I believe it?  Unfortunately, as bad as I do not want to believe this story, I do.  It simply cries out to any viewers to be more aware of what is going on around you.  Hang up if in doubt comes to mind to say the least...

Further, the manager...if, in fact, there was such a manager, she should be completely ashamed of herself for her judgments, and her feeling of the need to rush, and manage without true considerations of her staff.

Finally, it just gives one the ""creeps"" knowing there are those around us who get their sick ""jollies"" by doing such a thing to others.  But, hey, this is America, the great melting pot where neighbors use to be neighbors, and now we all lock our doors at night.  Maybe that is the true story behind this movie...wake up America, we are crumbling apart from lack of concern for others.

5359110,5,B009OCR2U6,"This movie was very disturbing in its presentation.  However, like many others have already written it was not just inspired by true events, it represents very closely an incident that occurred.  For more information about the incident, wikipedia ""Strip search prank call scam"".

It is important that everyone understand what rights they do and not have, because in the end you only have as many rights as you are willing to stand up for.

For example, when a police officer stops you and asks to search you or your personal belongings, do you have to consent to such a search?  The answer is: no, but you cannot resist if the officer insists.  What you need to state is simply ""I do not consent to searches"".  If the officer continues to ask you further questions, you also have the right to ask if you are being detained.  This is information that everyone should know and practice, because way too many people just assume that if someone has a badge or a particular uniform that the officer must know what is allowed under the law and what is not allowed under the law.  This is totally incorrect assumption.  Just try engaging in a peaceful protest on public property once or twice in your life and you will see how ill-informed and susceptible law enforcement is to using intimidation, even when dealing with something as basic as the first amendment right to peaceably assemble and petition for redress of grievences (language directly from the first amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America).

This whole topic of people's blind willingness to comply with authority is extremely pertinent in an age where many laws have been passed (such as the Patriot Act) that directly contravene the spirit and letter of the US Constitution. People are much too willing to give up liberty for security, however illusionary and fleeting that security may be.

I'm not a liberal wacko or a fundamentalist conservative, I'm just an ordinary citizen that is very concerned about how little consideration most US citizens give to their rights and reponsibilities as fellow citizens of a country ruled by a goverment that is supposed to be of the people, for the people, and by the people (which is not part of the wording of the Constitution, in case you are wondering, but rather from the Gettysburg Address).  However, the US Constitution does begin with ""We the people of the United States..."".  This is an inclusionary statement, rather than exclusionary.  If we as citizens don't actively participate in our governance, the goverment is more than happy to do it for us -- to everyone's great detriment.",1362787200,4,2617,4.849438202247191

A review of the movie - the acting was very good in general but, it left something to be desired in the girl. She lacked the emotion that I think she should have had, especially the total ""giving up"" feelings that she should have had at the end that would have made her feel like she had to allow this guy to photograph her crotch with his cell phone and send it to - supposedly, the police, while this guy was staring at her crotch 12 inches away. She never cried once and I find that hard to believe as the movie wore on. Now, my review of the idiocy of the events. There were so many red flags and NOBODY gave a damn. They just went along - except her friend her wanted nothing to do with it and stated so and went back to work. Too bad he didn't look in to see what was going on because he probably would have put a stop to it. Everybody else should have been charged and convicted of assault and whatever else was fitting. For example: The police need to know what her nipples look like? He needs to know what her body looks like? If there was a murder, would the police have someone to send out? There could be money concealed in the clothing, even the panties, that only the police can find because they are trained to find it. Where could a stack of bills be concealed in a tiny pair of panties that no ordinary person could not find? These idiots might have been fooled initially but, it didn't take long for the red flags to show and they just decided - what the hell - and took advantage of the girl. Why? Probably because it was easier than arguing with this guy on the phone.  Why they didn't hang up on him, I don't know. They could have made noise and pretended it was a bad connection - and then the phone goes dead. They also could have said, yeah, her clothes are off, gone along with the jerk, while the girl was fully dressed.  The absurdity of the entire event is beyond belief, except, it really did happen. Oh - and for the supervisor of the restaurant to take all this on herself - I bet she thought she would get a big hero reward for being such a big shot. She should have called her District Manager immediately. It was not her place to do what she did. Glad to know she got fired.

I was intrigued by the circumstance, but bothered by someone's penchant for this kind of evil. Quite a thought provoking movie, but one I don't think I would want to watch again as it does not elevate, but leaves one quite bothered and

5359131,1,B009OCR2U6,"Right off the bat I would have been suspicious. The police would never ask a regular citizen to detain someone. A policeman calling the manager of a fast food place to detain an employee for investigation and possible arrest? The police wouldn't ask a civilian to initiate an investigation either. Not only is it an extreme violation of judicial procedure, but if the case would have gone to court it would have been thrown out. You have to be extremely stupid or gullible to fall for that.  They would send an officer directly to the place of the crime and that would be it. But let's pretend the situation traveled that far. As revealed by an interviewer in the movie, there was a police station nearby. Surely after about 10 minutes elapsed a normal person would begin to wonder why the police hadn't arrived yet. If you had any sense at all, being asked to do a strip search, let alone one you were asked to perform by a cop over the phone should have sent red flags up. Even if the man and the girl thought the cop was legit, most people would just run away from the situation thinking there was some malfeasance going on. And if that's not enough, they obey a cop who isn't there and is telling them over the phone to implement punishment and perform sexual acts? Most people would just stop right there and quit.  And several cases of this or something similar were supposed to have happened in actual life? Movies are supposed to have some semblance of realism to hold an audience, an audience concluding that this could actually happen in real life. The fact that it HAS happened is beside the point, and just shows how dangerously uninformed our public is about our judicial system, and how susceptible it is to mind control and unquestioning deference to authority.

5359150,4,B009OCR2U6,This movie could be a case study continuation of the Milgram experiment done in the early 60's.  In that experiment the expected results (well over 50%)surprised everyone that normal people relinquish their morals to authority knowing that what they do is not right.  This movie although hard to believe is very likely the outcome in most cases as per the Milgram experiment or the Prison experiment conducted years later.  It is imperative as a society that we learn our individual rights under the law and enforce them when need be or we too will eventually succumb to authority that is not in our best interest. The perpetrator of this crime no doubt enjoys manipulating people and is a good example of the horrendous crimes committed on a daily basis by those having a sadistic nature.  The victims having been accomplices of the evil committed will forever remember the parts they played and suffer psychologically from it. My personal opinion of this movie was that it's a movie that you have to see but it won't be an enjoyable experience being the voyeur of individuals losing their souls.

Wow, I just don't understand at anytime why didn't she try calling her Manager directly to question what she was told to do to her employee. She had too many chances to check this out, because of the all the bizarre requests this ""so-called"" police officer was making. We had internet and cellphones in the year 2004.  The young victim knew in her heart she did not commit this crime, so she should have ran out the door. I've always told my kids to never say anything and request for your parents to be present or ask for legal counsel.  I'm not going to get into anymore detail, everyone else has broken it down for you.

The biggest gripe I have is that this pervert was let go. It seems to me that they had lots of evidence on him with the purchase of his calling cards, etc. They also should have let the victim pick his voice from a line up. I don't think this was done. I think it would have put the nail in the coffin. This pervert was married with 5 children. Her manager had the nerve to sue McDonald's. Huh. She is the one that took it as far it went, and even called her fiance who ended up violating her. She did not deserve a dime in my eyes. The victim should have gotten more than she did--she is emotionally screwed up for life. How horrible for that young lady. I gave it 4 stars because it was based on a true story.

 'Compliance', 'The Wizard of Oz' and every story like it shows us much more than what can happen to a young woman and the staff of a fast-food establishment from the voice over a telephone.

Despite many comments indicating that this is a true story, I simply cannot believe it.  It may, perhaps, be ""based"" on a true story, but it must be so incredibly LOOSELY based on actual events as to have become virtually complete fiction.  There may be many actions and responses presented in this film which did, in fact, occur as this incident unfolded.  However, it is simply impossible to believe that these several adults, even including inexperienced young adults, could display the absolute idiocy, in real life, that is depicted in this film.  If all of these actions truly DID occur as shown, the (infinitesimally low) level of intelligence of the sub-humans involved in the actual incident is an abhorrently sad commentary on the people in at least that area of the United States.  How else could this many stupid people be located in the same place in the same town at the same time?

Just one example... Can you really imagine a current day 16+-year-old girl (and the man ""watching her"") believing that an unseen and unknown alleged police officer, making suggestions via telephone, could somehow possess the authority to legitimately and legally be commanding her to submit to a naked spanking from and then to perform oral sex upon that man as ""punishment"" for being uncooperative while that man was ""watching her"" until the police could arrive???

This movie is a poorly made and poorly directed piece of absolute trash, and presenting it as FACT is even trashier.  Don't waste your time watching it.

5359349,3,B009OCR2U6,"Craig Zobel's film COMPLIANCE is a disturbing recreation of an event that happened in a Kentucky fast-food restaurant in 2004.  Harried restaurant manager Sandra (Ann Dowd) receives a phone call from a man identifying himself as a police detective named ""Officer Daniels"" (Pat Healy).  Daniels asks for Sandra's assistance in the investigation of one of her employees, nineteen-year-old Becky (Dreama Walker), who is suspected of stealing money from a customer's purse.  Sandra goes along with Daniels, detaining Becky in her office, strip searching her, and eventually leaving Becky in the custody of Sandra's fianc, Van (Bill Camp).  Following Daniels's directions, Van conducts a full body search of Becky, spanks her, and has her perform oral sex on him.

This is probably one of the most squirm-inducing films I've ever seen, and if it wasn't based on a true story it would defy credibility.  It's hard to imagine anyone allowing themselves to be manipulated by a phone caller into committing kidnapping and sexual assault.  It's also hard to imagine the nineteen-year-old victim agreeing to any of this - and she agrees to all of it, supposedly out of fear for her life.  The question remains - why make this awful and degrading incident into a film?

Zobel claims his intention is to shine a light on our susceptibility to authority.  The man on the phone says he is a police officer, and manager Sandra, her fianc Van, and victim Becky all go along with his demands, even when those demands are patently ridiculous - there's no way any legitimate police officer would ask civilians to force a suspect into a sex act!  But all three characters are so intimidated by the authority figure on the phone that they do whatever he says without question.

What bothers me about the film is its skill at turning viewers into voyeurs as we watch Becky being abused and humiliated.  We become complicit in the crime simply by our inability to look away (or to turn off the video!).  In the real Kentucky case on which the film was based, an in-store security camera recorded the entire 2  hour ordeal - the majority of that video is out there on the internet where scores of people have watched it (and there was certainly no pseudo-cop forcing them to watch).  Zobel may have been trying to make a comment on how easily we are manipulated by authority figures, but the film seems to be saying more about how attracted we are to depravity and the suffering of others.

In the real 2004 case, a suspect was arrested (through phone records and calling cards he purchased at a Florida Wal-Mart).  He was suspected of doing the same thing at different restaurants and grocery stores across the country more than seventy times over a ten year period.  Ultimately, he was acquitted of the Kentucky charges, and he has not been charged with any of the others.  I was a bit disappointed that COMPLIANCE focused almost entirely on the incident itself, and provided little information about the arrest and trial.  Then again, that wasn't what Zobel was interested in.

I have to admit I didn't enjoy watching this film - but I also couldn't quite bring myself to turn it off.  I remember this same case being used as the subject of an episode of ""Law & Order: SVU"" a few years back, with Robin Williams playing the prank phone caller.  In the episode, the focus was totally on how easily we foolish humans are manipulated by authority (Robin Williams's character was doing his pranks as part of a ""social experiment"").  With COMPLIANCE, the focus is more on how attracted we are to sexual perversity, something most of us would rather not be reminded of.  This is a well-made and frightening film that never quite rises to the level of social commentary.  Or, perhaps it's never totally honest in what its intentions are.  I have no doubt I would not be intimated by a voice on the phone, even if that voice claims to be a police officer (and even if this perpetrator pulled this same prank seventy times over ten years, it's more than likely there were many, many more times when he tried and failed to get his subjects to follow his commands).  But at the same time, I didn't turn off this film, did I?  As I see it, COMPLIANCE is more about human depravity than it is about our susceptibility to authority.  It just doesn't want to come clean about that.",1360627200,,4344,4.7063492063492065

5359351,2,B009OCR2U6,"This was an extremely tough movie to review.  The performances were outstanding.  The direction and writing were on the mark.  The subject matter will raise your blood temperature, though.

First the praise. Dreama Walker (recently known for her work as the sweet roommate on The B**** in Apt. 23) plays a young, naive 19 year-old girl working as a cashier at a fast food restaurant.  It's established early that she is quite fearful of confrontation and abides authority.  This is important to keep the thread of the movie.  Ann Dowd is the fast food manager who plays the authoritarian but you can tell she is often caught between management and appeasing people around her.  Pat Healy is the creep, prank caller who initiates this nightmare into action.  Characters weave in and out but these three actors are the streams in this web of a story.  The direction was never off-kilter and short, quick edits keep the pace forward.

The main issue is that this ""based on true events"" movie quickly devolves into the worst kind of exploitation ever filmed into celluloid.  I know movies like the original, I Spit on Your Grave, and other types of revenge movies are usually marked with this distinction but it's very hard to fathom how anyone can NOT supercede the ""police officer"" on the phone and not realize it was a disgusting prank.  By the time the sexual assault happens onscreen, most of the audience is left disgusted and pity the young lady forced to do ridiculous things to keep the prank caller satisfied.  The director smartly kept the sexual assault to just a few brief seconds but it is too little, too late.

I wanted to recommend this movie based on many the general (American) population's latent memory of a prank caller who escalates a prank into sexual assault, which did happen in Kentucky.  Also, I wanted to state that Dreama Walker and Ann Dowd were amazing in their respective performances.  Pat Healy is one of the most convincing fiends you'll see on film in a long time, as well.  Ultimately, this movie just becomes a dictation of real-life exploitation.  I don't fathom this movie as art.  Nor do I let subside this movie's peculiarities (side-stepping logic for fear).  This movie will leave you hallow and wish that this story was never told because simply you can't un-see this movie.  Tragic, heart-breaking and fallow.

5359399,5,B009OCR2U6,"This is both a dramatically provocative and important film for anyone above the age of early adolesence.

  In the early 60's, Psychologist Milgram did a series of studies in which he persuaded both students and non-students to
administer painful shock to subjects.  This experiment was done under the guise of testing learning theory.  In many, many instances the subjects (confederates) screamed in pain and begged the subjects to stop.  Yet because the subjects were instructed to do so by an experimenter in authority, the subjects (playing the role of teachers) continued shocking the subjects.  These findings illustrate the power of authority in inducing ordinary people to do horrid things to others.  Naturally the ugly, unforgettable real-world manifestation of this is the holocaust.  ""I was only following orders"" goes the feeble reply when the Nazi and SS were forced to answer for their crimes.

  The film ""Compliance"" is a modern day, dramatic, creative, and compelling reenactment of the Milgram studies.  As such, it is a ""must see"" for academics from all fields, but particularly from those focusing interpersonal communication, leadership, persuasion, social psychology, sociology, journalism, law enforcement, and public administration.

  In addition to its suitable as an instructional aid and stimulus to classroom discussions, it is an extremely well acted and
fascinating film.  Artistically, it is well photographed, and the dialogue and actors are superb.  This story is, in fact, a dramatic rendering of real-life instances of similar crimes committed throughout the U.S.

  I cannot recommend enough this intelligent, provocative film.

5359421,3,B009OCR2U6,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

  'Compliance' is based on a bizarre, real-life crime that occurred at a McDonald's restaurant in a small town in Kentucky. The criminal who committed this crime also committed approximately 70 other similar crimes over a span of ten years; although the crime at the Kentucky McDonald's was the worst.

  The odd thing about the crime is that it was committed with the perpetrator on the phone in the State of Florida. SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD. All the events in the film are basically what happened during the real life event; except instead of a McDonald's, the establishment in the film is a fried chicken restaurant.

  The perp pretended to be a police officer and convinced the manager of the restaurant, that a young, teenage employee of hers had stolen money from a customer earlier in the day. He tells the manager, Sandra, that his colleagues are busy and she needs to take the employee in the back room, where she is instructed to strip search her.

  Any normal person with the slightest bit of common sense would have realized that this was some kind of scam or a pervert getting his rocks off from the get go, but Sandra is one of those people who never thinks of questioning authority, and follows everyone of the perpetrator's directives. Becky, the young employee, who now finds herself virtually naked, is covered only by an apron. The caller manipulates Becky as well, claiming that her brother could face charges, as he is also the subject of a police investigation.

  Things become even more cringeworthy (and I guarantee that you'll be squirming in your seat), when the perverted caller convinces Sandra to call her fianc to the restaurant, in order to watch the hapless Becky. Van is even more of a 'Yes Man' than Sandra and ends up first spanking her for ten minutes and then instructs her to have oral sex, at the behest of the caller. This goes on for over two hours, as Sandra is outside, helping customers. Van finally leaves but calls a friend from his car, acknowledging that he just did a ""very bad thing"".

  After a custodian comes in and realizes what's going on, he has Sandra call her regional manager, who supposedly was at the police station with the caller but in reality was sleeping at home.

  How could anyone be so gullible to believe that the guy on the other end of the line was actually a cop? His instructions become so ludicrous, that any normal person would have realized what was going on. But we're not dealing with 'normal' people here. Like the good Germans in Nazi Germany, who followed 'orders', the employees of this particular fast food restaurant, simply 'complied' with the authority figure who was giving them orders. Perhaps they had such a fear of punishment (the manager thought she might lose her job and the fianc and the store employee, thought they might end up being placed under arrest), that this caused them to become the 'ultimate followers'.

  On a moral plane, some have argued that everyone involved in this incident was a victim. For me, at least Sandra and Van, as a result of their absurd gullibility and slavish devotion to authority, are just as guilty as the caller, for facilitating the events that occurred. You can make some excuses for Becky, due to her young age, but it's hard believing that she's representative of the average teenager (Dreama Walker doesn't quite hit the mark as Becky, acting more annoyed than in fear for her life; Ann Dowd, as Sandra, is much more convincing, as the clueless and arrogant company worker).

  Believe it or not, the police finally did catch the caller but he was acquitted at trial, after the prosecution was unable to prove definitely that he had made the actual calls to the restaurant. The fianc ended up getting five years for sexual abuse but the real-life Sandra and Becky successfully sued McDonald's and got million dollar payouts (Sandra claimed McDonald's was aware of the prank calls but did nothing to alert their employees about them beforehand).

  One must acknowledge that 'Compliance' is a well made film, which keeps your interest from beginning to end. I don't think writer/director Craig Zobel, should be credited so much in the creative screenplay department, since he basically regurgitated the events that occurred from the real-life incident. And while the tension escalates nicely to the denouement, this is not a film that I'll be rushing out to see again. See it once, and you'll very much get the idea what it's about.

  'Compliance' has engendered quite a bit of discussion on the internet about the nature of those morally challenged 'yes men', who are unable to judge right from wrong, due to their subservience to authority figures. Let's hope that this incident (and others like them), are the exception to the rule--that there aren't a lot of people out there who would so readily follow the dictates of such a diabolical manipulator. But judging from history, my optimism about people in general, may  entirely be a pipe dream!",1358899200,97,5029,4.802555168408827
5359422,4,B009OCR2U6,"With nary a ghost, ghoul or goblin is sight and without bloody violence, gore or grotesque supernatural beings, Craig Zobel's film may be one of the scariest I've ever seen.  About midway through this 90 minute film, I'm shaking my head saying to myself, ""there's no way this would happen.""  Unfortunately it did and if you believe the film's epilog, it happened over 70 times in a relatively short period.

Sandra (award worthy Ann Dowd) is the manager of a chicken fast food restaurant in Ohio.  She's pretty much all business, concerned about some food being spoiled and the fact they've run out of bacon as a result.  Becky (Dreama Walker) is a 19 year old counter clerk who ""really needs this job.""  During the busiest part of the day, Sandra is called to the phone and speaks to what she is told is a police detective investigating a complaint that Becky stole money from a woman's purse.

The detective convinces Sandra that her help is needed to determine if the complaint is factual.  Becky denies the accusations and just wants to get back to work.  ""Officer"" Daniels (Philip Ettinger) through Sandra, asks Becky to disrobe.  Reluctantly both agree, just to get past it.  But it doesn't stop.  Others are brought into the mix, allegedly to ""keep an eye"" on Becky.  Becky spends the rest of the film naked or with an apron covering up her vitals.

This is a disturbing film and squirm inducing throughout the second half, so be prepared.  What makes the movie so authentic are some strong low key performances, especially from Dowd and Walker.  I was somewhat disappointed that the epilog didn't address what happened to those involved in these real life events.  Guaranteed to make you think.

The Blu ray looks great.  Shot with digital cameras the transfer is sharp and clear in 1080p and has an aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  I saw no arifacts or effects of noise reduction.  The audio is a dialog centered DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.

5359448,4,B009OCR2U6,"Even the most twisted, demented screenwriter could not have come up with the story for Compliance if it had not actually happened. I remember hearing news accounts of the story of a Kentucky McDonald's manager who strip-searched a female employee at the behest of a prank caller who claimed to be a police officer investigating a theft by the employee. Prior to watching the movie, I did some googling to refresh my memory. ***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** At least three other employees were present at various points during the more than three hours long ordeal. The prank caller even got the manager's fiance involved, encouraging him to spank and sexually assault the employee. Shockingly, the fiance went along with the requests with little resistance. ***END SPOILERS***

All of these disgusting events are portrayed in the film. It's impossible to understand how not one person stepped in to help Becky, played by Dreama Walker from the TV show, ""Don't Trust the B in Apartment 23."" It's also hard not to ask why Becky did not march out of the restaurant. Even the prank caller, who starts off as just an anonymous voice on the phone, but is eventually shown puttering around his house during the call, chuckles in disbelief at various times as the situation continues to spiral out of control.

Ann Dowd does a marvelous job as the store manager, Sandra. She is sympathetic towards Becky, but she is eager to obey authority, and the conflict shows. At the same time, she was the one with the most ability, just by virtue of her position, to bring the whole thing to a halt, and she chose not to.

This movie is very difficult to watch, particularly because we know it was based on an actual event. I would not go so far as to say this is a study of human behavior, because I believe there are very few people who would actually fall victim to this sort of crime. Indeed, we learn that there were many similar prank calls attempted, possibly by the same perpetrator, but none went as far as the Kentucky McDonald's one did. Instead, it is a depiction of one very uniquely subservient group of people who were unlucky enough to become the random targets of a twisted individual.",1358640000,2,2175,4.703412073490814
5359449,4,B009OCR2U6,"If this weren't based on a true story, you'd seriously be wondering about the mentality of the filmmaker. Sadly, it's based not on one but dozens of events that occurred all over the country, apparently distilling the very worst of what happened into one storyline.

The film effectively pushes the boundaries of what normal people will do when given orders by authority - in this case, strip-searching a minimum wage teenage worker upon the flimsiest allegation of theft and then rapidly deteriorating from there, all on the orders of a caller posing as a cop. What might initially seem far fetched is very well staged: the manager struggles to assert her seniority among her own staff and effectiveness to her bosses; the teenage suspect tries to protect her criminally-prone brother; and the manager's fiance basically does as he's told after he's been drinking.

The three main performances in this film are excellent, with Ann Dowd delivering a highly convincing portrayal of the stressed manager ""just following orders"". While it's very dialog heavy, the scenes are structured to slowly lead the characters and viewers down the rabbit hole of just how bad it's going to get.

It probably goes without saying that this isn't an easy film to watch but it does deliver a message missing in most drama that too frequently shows a binary world of authority always being right. You find yourself partly wondering how stupid the people on the screen really are for believing the prank call - and then partly wondering how many people you know would behave similarly in the same situation.",1358640000,3,1587,4.958646616541353

The first thing you need to know is this actually happened. Instead of Ohio, it took place in Mount Washington, Kentucky at a prominent fast-food restaurant chain in 2004.
A man called the restaurant, claiming to be a police officer. He tells the manager that one of her young female employees has taken money out of the purse of a customer.
Sandra, the manager, brings Becky, the employee into a back room, and per the policeman's instructions has her turn her pockets inside out and goes through her purse. She finds nothing. The officer says she can either wait until a squad car arrives or strip search the employee. The fast-food place is very busy so all agree to the strip search. Again nothing is found.
The officer instructs the manager to put Becky's clothes in her unlocked vehicle and keep her in the back until officers arrive.
The humilated Becky covers herself with an apron. The caller convinces the manager that the clothes could have hidden pockets. He expands his story saying Becky's brother has been involved in drug trafficing and that the police are searching her house right now.
As the day wears on, the caller's instructions get stranger, and as unbelieable as it seems, Becky eventually complies to each and every request.
The film is distinct and compelling, reminding me a little bit of the docu-drama Catfish. In real life, over 70 incidents like this one took place across the United States.",1358294400,2,1488,4.858267716535433

5359482,5,B009OCR2U6,"This is a very powerful movie, with a powerful message: question authority!

Sandra (Ann Dowd) is the manager at a fast food restaurant. During a busy night she receives a phone call from a person claiming to be a police officer telling her that a cashier, Becky (Dreama Walker) has stolen money from a customer. Sandra follows the policeman instructions (on the phone) in order to find the money. Together with the staff and her fianc, Sandra does unspeakable things to Becky, until an old timer red neck shows up, disobeys the cop because he feels uncomfortable and ends the painful agony that everybody is going through.

There are so many things wrong with the script in this movie that......but wait! This is not fiction. This script is based on events that really happened in this country. It shows the stupidity of the young generation, the low information voters, the people with the iphones and ipads, who care about the Kardashians and Paris Hilton, watch ""American Idol"" and read ""people"" from cover to cover. They don't read books, don't know history, have minimum education, and are cowards. Never did a sport in their life, never stood for anything else but themselves. It also shows the selfishness of some older uneducated people (Sandra and her fianc) who just dream to get enough money in order to move to Florida. I know that is very chic to criticize the red necks and the people who live in the countryside, but without their common sense we can just imagine the tragic consequences of these stories.

Five stars because the acting and the direction are just great and because this movie makes you think. The script for a movie like this wouldn't even pass the first screening, because people will say that it is too ...fictitious. Wake up! Drop the ipod and the phone and stop texting.

While you may say ""this would never happen to my child"" the sad truth is that a similar situation like this happens literally all the time in our Public Schools. if you do a Google search  you will find  many instances where a Student reports $10 missing from their wallet after Gym Class.. The Teacher will then search all of the students lockers looking for the money.. then in most of the cases.. students will then be taken individually into a room (usually by a teacher of the same gender) when they receive a ""pat down"" search.. then told to loosen their belt while the band of their underwear is checked.. & girls are told to shake out their Bras to ensure they are not hiding anything... of course the schools would say this was not a ""strip search"" but they needed to find out who stole the money.  What difference does it make? even if you found $10 how would you know that money didn't belong to the other student?

This Movie sends a clear messages that both people in Authority (teachers, Managers Police officers etc) and people under their authority (Students, employees, arrested citizens etc) need to have a very clear line on what is acceptable & when you feel that something is wrong we need to stand up and say so.. . Citizens need to say ""I do not consent to any searches"" police officers need to realize they will be held accountable for strip searching a citizen at the side of the road.",1357776000,4,1607,4.4709897610921505

However these gullible fools all went along with the ""investigation"" in the name of 'helping the police'. The make-believe cop was never seen, nor given any factual evidence that he was a policeman other than telling these moronic supervisors that it was their duty to help the police in their investigation which was obviously phony from the get-go. Today most if not all restaurants have Caller ID which would have stopped this immediately. The entire film served no purpose being made.

I wanted to yell at the screen, stop this nonsense immediately! Stay away unless you enjoy having your intelligence mocked.",1357776000,11,1324,4.915178571428571
5359492,5,B009OCR2U6,"This film is a dramatic illustration of Stanley Milgram's ""Obedience to Authority"" experiments, where a man in a white coat claiming to be a scientist ordered students to deliver electric shocks to an ""experimental subject"" who was actually, unknown to the students, an actress. The students went on to deliver ""shocks"" that would have killed a person, all because the ""man in the white coat"" told them to. In this film the man in the white coat is a man pretending to be a police officer who orders workers in a fast food restaurant to strip search and ultimately rape one of their own employees. It is a skillfully done film and quite effective. I can't say I enjoyed it, but it was chilling enough, given that there are, according to the film 70 such cases in the U.S. a year.",1357776000,6,779,4.531914893617022
5359493,5,B009OCR2U6,I couldn't not turn away while watching this movie. Hard to believe it was based on real life events. Dreama Walker deserves an Oscar.,1357776000,4,134,4.625
5359494,4,B009OCR2U6,"By far the most disturbing movie that I have ever seen, yet, I don't know why I liked it so much? All I did is yell at the screen throughout the entire movie. I couldn't believe how stupid people could really be. With that being said, the acting was incredible, especially by Ann Dowd, who plays the ditzy, not so smart restaraunt manager. Her character, although the dumbest woman on the planet, is so believable that  her performance just sinks you into this indie flick. I once worked in retail, and to be honest, I knew of another manager who was just like her. So, could someone possibly have been fooled by a voice over the telephone pretending to be the police? I think the answer is, Yes. You never know how one might react in this kind of circumstance; however, I think the movie takes it just a little too far. Just when you think it's bad...it only gets worse. One of the final scenes with Sandra's (Ann Dowds) boyfriend, and Becky (the victim), is so unimaginable and sickening, which made me think, maybe Becky likes it? I know it's sick, but, maybe she isn't such a sweet, nice girl? Why else would she agree to all of this? All in all, the movie hit a core with me, which is why I am talking about it. It says that it is based on True Events, and in the end it says that it had happened over 70 times in the U.S. However, it appears that these characters in this movie are not based on real people. The movie also leaves you with some questions that I would have liked answered. Like, what became of Becky and Sandra? There were many times I wanted to shut the movie off, however, before I knew it, the movie just flew by and was over. The only question that bothers me the most is... if an officer is calling and saying that they have reason to believe that an employee has stolen money from a custmoer then why didn't she just play back the resturaunts surveillance video from the begining to see if she took the money? I would have. But I guess there wouldn't be a movie then. Anyway, with that being said, you know that Sandra isn't the most sane person from the very begining of the movie. You know that she has a lot on her plate. And you know that she is trying to be the perfect citizen. She is really trying hard to please this officer on the other line, and doesn't even question that what she is doing is wrong. The restaraunt is busy and she can't really juggle two things at once, so she gets others to do it for her. Walking away from this movie I said two things. The first, I hated this movie! How stupid can people be! The second thing was, Ann Dowd deserves an Oscar! Now, a day later and although I feel the same about Ann Dowd, I think looking back, that I kinda' liked the movie a little bit more then I first thought.",1357603200,,2754,4.23574144486692
5359495,3,B009OCR2U6,"i watched the start of this film and then as it got more dumb and dumb i was just listening to it while sorting my dvd collection. At the store i work at, i get a lot of prank calls and i always hang up unless i'm in the mood to mess with them, but this was just insane at how dumb these people are. How they could not understand it was a prank is beyond me. Especially near the end.

5359497,3,B009OCR2U6,"The era of crank phone calls has sure taken a twist. When fast food restaurant manager (Ann Dowd) gets a phone call from someone identifying himself as policeman, she springs into action. Young Becky is accused of stealing from a customer. The assistance of the manager and others in this matter grows until it becomes inane. The film brings light to the problem of serial strip search crank calls...something I didn't know existed. This film is based on the Mount Washington, Kentucky incident which BTW was a McDonald's.

The film acting was okay. There is a high perv factor whenever you force a young girl to be stripped searched. Unfortunately this is pretty much the entire film as there is no real subplot to entertain us. This is one of those pervert films masquerading as something that makes a statement such as ""Shame."" Watch it. Enjoy it. Disturbing? Thought provoking? Oh Please. It's soft core porn.

5359498,1,B009OCR2U6,"So I finally got to see this movie and I have to say:  It's stupid!  I mean after watching it, I turned to my wife and asked, ""Are people really this stupid?""

The movies takes place at this fast food chain and during a busy day a man pretending to be a cop calls in to say that one of the women who works the cash register supposedly stole some money out of a person's purse.  That in itself is stupid because if you watch the movie you can see that you would have to reach up and over the counter to get into the person's purse.  It would be impossible to do that and not have the person see them doing it.

Anyway, the cop has the manager bring this girl back to a back room and strip search her.  He then makes the supervisor take her clothes out to her car and leave them there while the girl waits for the police to come.  Eventually, he has another worker, a male come in to ""guard"" her but that doesn't work because he questions everything the cop asks so the cop asks the supervisor to call her fiancee to come and watch her.  He does.  So the cop makes him have her take off her apron and do jumping jacks to see if the money falls out any of her orifices.  Then, he has to give her a spanking because the girl talked bad to the supervisor.  After that she has to perform oral sex on him.  I'm watching this like what the hell?  Do you really think this guy is a cop?  I think the fiancee just liked it too much to stop.  He feels bad about it afterwards but he still let it happen.  I mean what is this guy thinking.  There's a moment when the cop asks him to describe the girls nipples and he doesn't question this.  If this is based on a true story, how stupid is this guy.  Does he really think how her nipples look is going to be pertinet to the investigation?  It's laughable.

Eventually he has to leave so the supervisor brings in a maintenance man or something and the cop tries to get him to do the same thing to her that the fiancee just did.  This guy actually has some sense and because of his actions it helps to put a stop to the madness.

I have to say that it's an interesting story that is supposed to be based on true events but I mean are people really this stupid.  I mean if someone really was accused of stealing some money don't these people think that the police would come right there and do some questioning, not call them on the phone and do strip searches, etc.  I was just really disappointed, not with the premise of the movie but with the stupidity shown in the movie.  Honestly, there's only one or two smart people in the whole movie while everyone else just does everything this ""cop"" asks.

I wouldn't recommend the movie unless you want a laugh.  After a while that's what I was doing.  There are some moments when I was laughing out loud.  I just couldn't believe how stupid some people are.",1352073600,12,2839,4.125912408759124
8543308,1,B009OCR2U6,I couldn't even finish watching this because it was so incredibly DUMB. Why would they believe some random person who calls on the phone and says they are a police officer? Especially when the person is telling them to do such bizarre things.,1528243200,,242,4.651162790697675
8543309,1,B009OCR2U6,"Its only that you have to rate it that I give it this many stars. Dont waste your money, your time or your emotions. This is a disturbing movie in that A. It happened and B. Someone apparently would actually do this, (I refer to the supervisor talking to the so-called police); without once mentioning or having it occur to them that this country is founded on the belief that you are innocent before proven you are guilty. Now I did not finish the movie so I don't know that I can spoil anything, but the thing is you need to be warned. Becky is basically assumed guilty as the movie begins.
I cannot say too much against it. I realyze it apparently happened but I don't know the true facts, I am just saying this movie is digusting, upsetting but nothing really happens and again I did not finish it. In fact it is at this point in the trash. The only reason I bought & watched 40 some minutes of it is because I was reading on IMDB about actresses who deserve but have never won an Oscar. The head of the list was Glenn Close. About her I totally agree. She should have gotten one for Dangerous Liasons. But towards the end of the list was Ann Dowd. Now I like her but I haven't seen her in an Oscar worthy movie let alone a part. But apparenrly they thought this movie was one. WRONG.  Personally I think she was wrong to have taken the part because she is better than this smarmy, vile movie.
Im sorry but I just got done turning it off and I am still terribly upset over the injustice perpetrated by, ill- informed people. I suggest you heed my warning, but I understand I have probably made you curious & I am really sorry about that, so I will end here.",1527292800,,1661,4.206896551724138
