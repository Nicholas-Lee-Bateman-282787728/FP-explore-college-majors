8102226,4,B000CSUNOS,This video is a nice way to add to the reading of one of the children's versions of 'Last of the Mohicans'.  It's not too violent and it keeps to the story line somewhat.,1214611200,,170,4.0
8102227,5,B000CSUNOS,"Finally after all these years one of my favorite cartoons from childhood goes digital!!  Overall this is a really neat cartoon.  I think it is one of the more realistic cartoon portrayals of Last of the Mohicans out there, but of course along with all the other cartoons that have been made there are a lot of differences to make it appropriate for children.  I also like the animation that was used in the picture, because it is the typical 1970's Hanna Barabara animation of that era that we love so much.

The show starts off with Major Heyward who is escorting Cora and Alice Munro to their father in Fort William Henry.  Along the way they meet Magua who claims to be a scout for the British. But instead of leading them to the fort he is actually leading them deeper into the forest away from the fort into a trap.  They eventually meet up with Uncas, his father Chingachgook and a frontiersman named Hawkeye.  Hawkeye recognizes Magua and says the coolest thing:  ""Magua!! I told you that if I ever saw your ugly face again...!""  Magua glares at Hawkeye and runs into the forest as Uncas runs after renegade indian to see where his men are hiding.  That night Chingachgook watches over Heyward and the women while Uncas and Hawkeye look for a safe way out of the forest.  Chingachgook gives Alice a blue turtle necklace that was given to him when he was a young brave to comfort her and it ultimately saves her in the end.  He will also later give his life to save the life of his son Uncas who was ""the last of the Mohicans.""  In the end they make it to Fort Ticonderoga where Colonel Munro reunites with his daughters having never got his heart torn out and eaten by Magua.  (remember this is a children's show)

This show has a lot of characterization in it as we learn that Cora and Major Heyward have a thing for eachother, Alice is poor mannered and has an annoying dog named Pip that gets them into trouble all the time and that Hawkeye's real name is ""Natty Bumppo"" (Nathaniel Poe in the 1992 movie) which Alice mistakes for the name of a mosquito bite.  There are some cool actors in this including the voice talents of Casey Kasem as Uncas and Joan Van Ark as Cora.  As far as I know there no special features on it, but no matter what I cant wait to get this!  Koch Vision didn't do the best job remastering this cartoon, but at least they didn't do as bad of a job on it as they did The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. I'm ecstatic about this considering that the VHS I have was taped by my dad over 20 years ago when I was a kid and now it is totally shot.  All they have to do now is release Hanna Barbara's ""Davy Crockett on the Mississippi"" on dvd and I'll be a happy camper!! :-)",1139616000,6,2703,4.285433070866142
