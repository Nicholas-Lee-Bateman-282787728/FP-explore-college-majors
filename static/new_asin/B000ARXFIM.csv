2391023,5,B000ARXFIM,"I thought the documentary explain very well how gas build up in the magma caused the eruption in the 80s and when gas levels dropped that magma cone and spines formed then in 2005 all the magma stopped.  This theory seems to match the data.

Another popular theory is that continental plate caused the rock to crack and magma to press upward into weak area forcing the eruption.

The USGS seems to provide a compelling case that gas in the force made the difference.  In the magma cone and spines there was less gas in the rock.",1337472000,,528,4.412371134020619
2391024,5,B000ARXFIM,"I have seen many documentaries on volcanos and I would love to study one erupting up close........Umm not too close....but this particular documentary for me was a very informative one that put in perspective what happened that day.  It's too bad that an actual video of the eruption wasn't available but the famous still photographs of it still do the job nicely.

I also think that giving you perspective on what life is like post eruption was very interesting too because after an eruption like that, it took years for life to return to that mountain, which is the downside of living on a volcano or near it.........you always are in danger of having to move if it decides to erupt.  Definitely worthy of a purchase if you like documentaries on volcanos.",1209945600,14,757,4.71969696969697
2391025,4,B000ARXFIM,"I bought this as I was teaching about volcanoes and Mt. St. Helen in particular.  The footage was excellent and the information presented was as well.  My only problem was that the scientists they interviewed were very monotone and difficult to listen to.  I thought I would lose my fifth graders a time or two.  They hung in there and learned a lot, but they did complain that the speakers were boring.

If they ever decide to edit this film, my suggestion is for them to tell the presenters that volcanoes are things that kid's love.  After all, they blow up!",1202428800,12,561,4.5049504950495045

Real film in the camera to get developed. By 9 am to see the cloud of ash appear over the hills in Yakima was something to never forget. Street lights came back on in the middle of the day and dead silence out in the streets. No cars were being driven as you could not see the sidewalks or curbs.

2391037,3,B000ARXFIM,"Very interesting documentary on the events surrounding the eruption of Mount St. Helens.  Great pictures and recap of events, but way too much unsubstantiated evolutionary suppositions.  If you want a more well-rounded, accurate presentation of Mount St. Helens, the eruption, and how it impacts us and our views on earth history, watch ""Mount St. Helens: Modern Day Evidence for the World Wide Flood"", hosted by geologist Dr. Steve Austin and put out by Compel Media.

2391038,3,B000ARXFIM,"Great news!  They save the billions of years garbage until the very last.  But they don't point out that the results of the eruption show exactly what happened after the deluge.  Grand canyons, fossils, layers and layers of silt, trees petrified standing straight up with layers and layers of silt around them, all of which happened sometimes in just hours.  We are expected to believe that all the fossils in the world happened slowly and that the grand canyon was formed over ""millions of years.""

2391051,4,B000ARXFIM,"Fire Mountain: The Eruption and Rebirth of Mount St. Helens; 60 minute DVD, duplicated in 2003 from 1997 production by International Productions, Inc.

Brief summary of Native American history and naming of Mount St. Helens as Fire Mountain in recognition of its activity. Photos of the dome eruption also include the 200 square miles of forest leveled by the blast. Brief description of the Sumatra eruption 75,000 years ago that resulted in several years of global winter. Geologists also describe the role of volcanic activity in restoring fertility. Correlates tree rings with rock layers.

The rich wildlife of the area is briefly summarized before a more detailed coverage of the eruption is described. Animation shows the plate movement. Measurements of elevation at Mount St. Helens show dramatic changes and initiate predictions of an eruption as well as an evacuation zone. Several brief interviews with Harry Truman (not the President) who lives on Spirit Lake proclaiming he will never leave set the scene for later views of the whole region being destroyed. With the first evidence of eruption, a red zone 20 miles around the volcano was established. This would be found to be inadequate when the eruption at 8:32, May 18, 1980 blew from the side and not the top of the mountain. One cubic mile disintegrates in a pyroclastic flow.  The melting of the ice results in mud flows 400 feet deep. The fall of tefra blows eastward and blocks out the sky. Harry Truman and his lodge are gone.

The military rescues 198 people but 57 others die, including a geologist manning an observation station to measure the dome height. Smaller eruptions continue to 1992. Moving to the aftermath, the video focuses on the return of animals and plant succession. Some lakes provide protection for underwater animals. A pumice plain was formed. Spirit Lake however heated up and takes 5 years to clear and begin repopulation. A new Volcanic Crisis Response Team is formed. The Army Corps of Engineers also make major excavations to clean out protective channels. This volcanic event also establishes a special segment of the park with a new educational mission. Good brief description of work of the U.S. Geological Survey.

While the narration is not exceptional and could ""drag"" in its documentary style, the genuine drama of the events and fairly good story board and production make this useful in class, especially if only short segments are used that fit specific lessons. The video was produced in 1997, 17 years after the eruption, and that is barely halfway until now; thus both plant and animal succession have come a lot farther than is shown here.",1417824000,2,2653,5.006802721088436

2391056,5,B000ARXFIM,"This was one of those rare videos where one gets captivated and actually learns a lot about nature and science along the way. This video would be very appropriate for teaching school-aged kids about the structure of volcanoes, how and why they erupt and how this is monitored, the consequences of building and living in the shadow of the volcano, and how some survived the eruption (and why) and how some did not survive. This video encompasses actual news footage interspersed with interesting dialogs, demonstrations, and history of the area. If I were homeschooling, I'd definitely use this video in conjunction with other materials.",1397779200,4,636,5.125

2391060,5,B000ARXFIM,"As the title of the documentary itself communicates, this is a documentary on Mt. St. Helens, but what isn't said is the professionalism with which this was made.  Yes, the science is a bit dated, but not overly so, and the footage of the eruption itself, the Pyroclastic flow, and the resulting lahars are the real star of the documentary. It would have been nice to see some more up to date footage of what the mountain looks like today, but even on that front I believe the producers did a solid, if unspectacular job. The mountain itself is home to a now dormant volcano as well as newly formed glacier so there's not a whole lot of excitement about it now.  When it comes to video footage of the results of what mother nature brings to bear in a volcano, this really is the best documentary focusing on just Mt. St. Helens.  It's worth watching, particularly for those interested in the earth sciences.",1388188800,6,907,4.5182926829268295
2391061,5,B000ARXFIM,"Like all things of science this is a bit dated. But, over all gives good treatment to  realities under out feet . The reality of our planet as a ultra hot rock reactor was the real effect of the Mt St helens eruption. More recently the further dome building shows that the ultra hot rock of the Earth's mantle is hardly finished doing what it does best : make new topography . And update of this video with newer footage would go far to enhance it.
 But, ,for lovers of punky mountains nothing is ever quite enough. The overall quality if still gid dispite it being adated,

2391063,5,B000ARXFIM,"My son and I recently visited the Johnston Ridge Observatory directly across from Mt. St. Helens and were awe struck.  This account of the eruption just made our experience more unforgettable to know more about this frightening but incredibly beautiful place!  Driving up to the observatory, we passed a sign that read ""entering blast zone"".  We have a deeper understanding and respect for what that truly meant.  This documents the incredible power and underestimation of what this mountain would do once she let go.  Excellent information about the extreme danger still lurking amid this beautiful, serene part of the country.",1379462400,,628,5.24
2391064,5,B000ARXFIM,"Excellent film very well presented the story and eruption of the mountain. Having been to the visitors center and seen the Mountain as it is today 30some years later it is hard to imagine the enormity of the blast and the ensuing destruction that followed. One can now see the incredible resiliency of Nature as new growth appears  everywhere, still one can see that it will take Avery long time to return to anything like it was. The video contains first hand accounts of those who witnessed it and those who survived to tell their story's. Buy this you will not be disappointed!",1373500800,4,580,4.631067961165049

8079358,3,B000ARXFIM,I lived through this and can say that it was more than the sum of its parts.  The level of disbelief and total helplessness was off anybody's psych scale.

8079362,1,B000ARXFIM,"This is a bad documentary, another of those let's rewrite history kind of things. Not saying that the indigenous people are wrong, but the people that made this specific documentary are wrong. Mt. St. Helen's erupted in March of 1980. It did not create the crater before 1980 as they would have you believe. Small quakes drew the attention of the geology service, that's when they noticed the bulge on the North side of the mountain, set up cameras and detectors and such, and actually put a team  with video cameras five miles away, thinking they would be safe if the volcano blew. The earthquake in March of 1980 shifted the bulge on the North side of that mountain, caused the largest land slide in the history of the US, at that time. That landslide, opened the magma chamber on the north side of the volcano, and kaboom, Mt. St. Helens, literally blew her top off. That explosion is what left the horseshoe crater that dominates the mountain today. The geology service has images on film of the moment the mountain blew up, which is when the horseshoe crater was created, not before.",1496102400,2,1088,4.637305699481865
8079363,4,B000ARXFIM,"I'm surprised that the documentary was made in 2010 because it feels older than that. Not too old, but the footage of the rebirth of the area was quite behind the date of the video's release and the format and overall look was not up to that of the the Nova documentary of a few years ago. Still, it covered the story adequately and included interviews with relevant people who witnessed the eruption. I most appreciated the basic scientific and documentary presentation which was free of dark, dramatic music, foreboding voice-overs and other tricks of substandard documentaries. It could have used some kind of narration explaining how thoroughly the event was covered by the press at the time and became a national focus to the extent of making a minor celebrity of the stubborn Haarry Truman at the time. All the cultural impact was missing, but then I think they wanted to stick to scientific fact.",1491955200,,903,4.794871794871795
