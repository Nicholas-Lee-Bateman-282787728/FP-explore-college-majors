7847707,5,6303444733,"When my own kids were younger, they LOVED these videos.  I now teach Pre-K & was excited to find this particular video, since we recently were studying farms & cowboys.  They loved the ""fire song"" (Deep in the Heart of Texas)!  This was a great supplement for them!  I'm looking to buy more (since we've lost or given away the ones my own kids - now 20 & 23) had.  I highly recommend it.  The kid actors are engaging & the adult ""talking"" isn't condescending. The songs are ones we all used to know, but aren't sung much anymore!  A great way to introduce ""American Folksongs"" to children.",1301788800,,589,4.398148148148148

7847709,5,6303444733,"This was the first Kidsongs video we bought for when our grandchildren come to visit -- the first of whom is about to graduate high school now, but his youngest cousin is less than a year old and likes the video just as much as he did ""way back when.""  This tape could just as easily be called ""The Fourth of July"" -- it opens with an old-fashioned Fourth parade singing ""I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy.""  Then a statue of Uncle Sam comes to life and tells the kids about pioneer life with such songs as ""Home on the Range,"" I've Been Working on the Railroad,"" ""Deep in the Heart of Texas,"" etc.  There's an old-fashioned barn dance to ""Turkey in the Straw"" (complete with live turkeys), a funny rendition of ""There's a Hole in the Bucket,"" a handyperson version of ""If I had a Hammer,"" and a host of other traditional folksongs.  Patriotic but not preachy, it teaches some basic American history, too.",1085097600,,897,4.451219512195122
7847710,5,6303444733,"My daughter has been watching kidsongs since she was a baby.
Yes, the terrible Mother that I am started putting videos in for her a the ripe ol' age of 3 months!!!  I just noticed she was watching the television while she was in the infant swing and figured an old Kidsongs video handed down by my neice was better viewing than Jerry Springer.
In any event she loves all of the Kidsongs videos and now has about 10 of them.  But THIS ONE, believe it or not, IS HER FAVORITE!  It even surprised me because since this is an older one of their videos, it doesn't have Billy and Ruby Biggle, the adorable stuffed 'things' (what are they??).  However, she time and time again watches this one and sings the songs.  She especially likes 'Deep in the Heart of Texas' and that made her Grandad real proud since that is where he is from.
On a more parental note, this video is good because it teaches American history and plays good old American songs!",1016064000,5,943,4.365714285714286
