1256765,3,B000034D5X,"There are good and bad things that I discovered about this DVD.  I found the cardio portion to be short and the dance steps were hard to follow.  I realize that it was meant to be low impact, but I never felt really challenged, other than trying to keep up!  I liked the target toning segments.  It was nice to have a choice of which area you wish to work and with what intensity.  It makes it easier to do the workout everyday without getting over tired.  I think that I will do a different cardio workout along with the toning section of this DVD.",1004227200,5,549,4.180952380952381
1256766,1,B000034D5X,"THis DVD is a JOKE!  The ""fat burning"" cardio workout is only 20 minutes, and there's no lead-in introduction for the next move.  The quality and sound of the DVD is terrible!  However, the specific ""hit the spot"" portions for abs, buns and thighs isn't bad; good exercises and emphasis on proper form and technique.  If I had it to do over, I wouldn't buy it.  The only useful portion for me was the three specific exercises.",1003622400,4,426,4.48051948051948
1256767,2,B000034D5X,"I never use this DVD anymore - mostly because I hate Denise's style, all the sugary positive talk makes me nuts. The aerobic section is badly qued and I find it boring. The toning, while effective is realy based on the same old exercises we've been doing forever. The mind body cooldown is such a wild mix of styles you get nothing at all.",991958400,7,339,4.3125
1256768,1,B000034D5X,"This video is subpar.  For one thing...the DVD will constantly stop, like someone has hit pause...then start back up. This could be my particular copy.
Additionally, Denise just goes off in her own world on the ""fat burning"" section. She does nothing to explain the movements beforehand, just breaks out in dance steps/routine. I hate this section. So basically, you have to watch this section 10 times before you can even learn what she's doing. I don't want to do this. I want the routines to be easy and simple and some minor explanation beforehand (ex. we're going to do this...then show us slowly...then speed up) She doesn't do that.
The other sections: abs, buns, thighs are ok.
Overall, I would not recommend this DVD.",987984000,10,726,4.808
1256769,4,B000034D5X,"I really liked this DVD that features eight short workout segments that can be mixed and matched.  It has one cardio workout that is short, but challenging.  The moves include walking, grapevines, cha-chas, and chasses.  You will break a sweat.  There are also six ten-minute toning segments: two for abs, two for thighs, two for buns.  There is a mind/body routine for a cool-down or just to relax.  The scenery is tropical and beautiful and the toning exercises are basic and proven to be effective.  Denise is enthusiastic and encouraging, as usual.",983145600,24,552,4.934782608695652
1256770,4,B000034D5X,This is the first exercise DVD I have bought and I really like it. The scenery is pretty and the music isn't annoying. The toning sections have 2 levels so you can do one or both if you are really in for a workout. I like Denise's attitude and she is a great motivator. I haven't done aerobics in a while but I'm excited about getting back into shape while using this DVD.,979603200,25,372,4.109589041095891
1256771,5,B000034D5X,"I have exercised this DVD several times and I just love this DVD! You have complete pack for abs, buns and thighs. The warm-up could be more challenging, but the other exercises are just great! I recommend this  warmly to everyone and I thank Denise Austen for making this superb DVD.",961977600,9,284,4.568627450980392
1256772,5,B000034D5X,"This is the best fitness DVD yet!  Denise Austin has incorporated her Hit the Spot Abs, Buns, and Thighs series into one DVD as well as a Fat Burning workout and mind/body relaxation.  This DVD is divided into 6 chapters on  the main menu (Introduction, Fat Burning, Abs, Buns, Thighs, and Ask  Denise).  The Introduction chapter just goes over how you should use this  dvd and basic discussion of the chapters.  The Fat Burning Chapter contains  2 subchapters - Fat Burning workout and Mind/Body Cooldown.  The Fat  Burning workout is a 20 minute low-impact aerobic workout.  I really like  this one.  Denise starts out slow and then builds up to a fun-packed  workout which she incorporates some moves such as the cha cha and mamba.  The next subchapter is the Mind/Body Cooldown which is a very relaxing and  stress relieving group of exercises.  The Abs, Buns, and Thighs Chapters  each have 2 subchapters within them.  One for beginner and another for  moving on to advanced.  They each work on toning and tightening the target  areas.  The Ask Denise Chapter covers many frequently asked questions  regarding fitness and her corresponding answers.  I found this to be very  informative.  I really feel that I got more for my money with this DVD.  I  am very pleased!  Thanks Denise!",957398400,67,1288,4.828703703703703
7916480,5,B000034D5X,"Simply put, an oldie but a goodie. I love Denise Austin. Her workout videos helped me lose 40 lbs after my first baby. I'm looking to her to help me lose 30 lbs. now that I've had my second baby. Fun video that work!",1477440000,,216,3.9318181818181817
7916481,5,B000034D5X,"I love, love, love Denise Austin! I had her Hit the Spot Fat Burning Blast on VHS and my VCR broke, so I got rid of the tape. My two favorite workouts were on that tape!

All that to say this, the fat burning aerobics segment is one of my favorite workouts from the VHS tape mentioned above! The target toning workouts are divided into two segments - beginner and Intermediate/advanced. Any workout you choose, you're going to get an amazing workout that does what it says! It's broken down into fat burning (there's a tai chi relaxation segment also), thighs (it includes hips), abs and buns. Choose a segment and workout along with Denise Austin.

It's also a good if you need a quickie workout in the morning or evening. I highly recommend this DVD! You'll see the results! I did!",1388016000,,783,4.507042253521127
7916482,5,B000034D5X,This specific dvd is my favorite workout video of all time and I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and in DVD FORMAT !!!:) The price was reasonable and the quality is the same as I remember it!,1360195200,,193,3.9743589743589745
7916483,5,B000034D5X,Denise is awesome. Anyone can do her workout and get results if they eat right.,1212451200,,79,4.333333333333333
7916484,5,B000034D5X,"I have bought workouts from a variety of physical fitness trainers, but I always go back to Denise Austin and now that's all I will purchase. For one, I like her short workouts, from 10 to 20 minutes. They accomodate busy schedules as you can do one, or if you have time, combine them for a longer workout. A major reason I like Denise Austin is that her workouts are easy enough for the average person to follow and feel successful, she doesn't do those maniac fitness routines that are impossible to accomplish and leave you feeling frustrated. I lost 50 pounds after pregnacy working out to her videos. Now I just use them along with a rowing machine to keep in shape for horse back riding (I ride hunters over fences) and toned legs and thighs are a must. I can't recommend all of her videos enough.",1169683200,,803,4.4324324324324325
7916485,5,B000034D5X,"I still gave it five stars because the spot workouts are intense and pretty easy to follow. Denise Austin is so motivating and energetic, as always, this is why I love her. However, her warm-up to me is hard to follow. I like to just walk in place to get warmed up then scoot along to the other sections. The buns and thighs sections I haven't even been able to finish yet because they are sooo difficult. That's good. A challenge is always welcomed! So, Pros: Great workouts for ABS, Thighs and Buns. Cons: Bad Cues for warmup and is more difficult than it leads on. I consider myself to be in good shape but this is really hard. (Guess I'm not in as good of shape as I thought!) Keep it up ladies and don't lose sight of your goals! Stay motivated!

7916486,3,B000034D5X,"I just got the DVD, which was recommended by a friend and I was very disappointed to find that this series does not include the upper body in the work out.  I was under the impression that this would also include the full body work out since it was not otherwise stated.",1090972800,4,270,4.1923076923076925
7916487,4,B000034D5X,"If you're looking for a video that doesn't take a lot of time, then this is one that you should add to your collection.  It doesn't matter if you're a beginner or have been doing this stuff for years, there are two levels to suit both challenges.  10 minutes is spent on abs, buns & thighs.  You can choose to do all of them or one of them when you get a spare 10 minutes.  The exercises are great and you can feel the burn in all your muscles.  If you do this video 3-5 times a week and eat a healthy diet, you'll easily lose inches and tighten up those ""loose"" areas.",1084147200,,569,4.0
7916488,3,B000034D5X,"Denise Austin's Tone and Tighten DVD features a cardio workout, followed by targeted toning segments, ending with a Mind-Body cooldown. The cooldown segments features stretches reminscent of Tai-Chi practices.
The Cardio routine is set on the coastline of Hawaii, overlooking the blue waters of the island. The moves to the cardio segment are reminiscent of some of Denise's older workouts: grapevine, cha-cha, and knee lifts. If you are an experienced home exerciser, there will be no surprises here. If you are new to working out at home, be sure to watch this segment through once to learn the steps.
The targeted toning sections include: abs, buns, and thighs. Each toning segment has a beginning and an advanced workout, so you can keep using this DVD as you increase your fitness level. The toning segments use in-home items such as chairs and a towel, so there is no additional exercise equipment needed. Bear in mind, however, that just because you are working an area of the body does not mean that you will necessarily lose fat from that area. Toning exercises have to be combined with cardio workouts and a low-calorie diet to see results. Just doing these toning exercises is not the whole picture to toning those ""problem"" areas.
While this is not a new workout, it is an effectively packaged one. The segments are easy to access on the DVD, and they build intensity, so you don't stop using it once your fitness level increases. This is a great workout for a beginner, or an intermediate level workout. However, it is not a complete fitness routine all on one disc. It is a good complement to an existing routine that includes stretching, strenth training, and cardio workouts.",1041206400,8,1691,4.875
7916489,4,B000034D5X,"Denise Austin hit the spot tone and tighten dvd is a good dvd, the cardio option is 20 minutes long, which is ok, but I would like something a little longer.  It starts out easy(by easy I mean easy to follow) but then she gets into this grapevine, crossover, jump thing that I just can't pick up, maybe that is just me though.  Thankfully that step is more towards the end.  The exercises for the legs, butt and abs are really good though.  My muscles burned, but didn't hurt after the workout was over.
The cardio could be better, I wanted a harder longer sweat, but the target exercises although few, were excellent.  The best part is she offers a basic and intermediat for each target exercise.  My advise is to do the basic first.",1006128000,11,734,4.4
