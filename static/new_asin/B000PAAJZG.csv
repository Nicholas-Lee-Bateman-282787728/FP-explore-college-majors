2814766,4,B000PAAJZG,"The third season of Harvey Birdman is pretty funny and culminates in the death of Birdman.  However, not before throwing the old bird a bone and letting him perish in a heroic battle worthy of a first class ticket into Valhalla. Side by side with Peanut (Birdboy) and Birdgirl who survive, Class 1 hero Harvey engages Class 5 villain Nitron in a fight to save the city.  I enjoyed this DVD set as the humor is well written and the characters are quite distinct with my favorites being X the Eliminator, Potamus, Zardo (X's BFF and secret admirer) and of course Peanut.  Is it worth your money?  I would say yes but you really need the season 1 and season 2 DVD sets to fully appreciate the ultimate demise of Harvey and the development of all the characters.",1190073600,7,758,4.471014492753623
2814767,4,B000PAAJZG,"This third and final box set of [adult swim]'s Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law contains some of the most in-joke filled episodes of the run as all of Harvey's previous cases in one form or another come back to say good-bye.

The episodes included:
Turner Classic Birdman
Free Magilla
Return of Birdgirl
Mindless
Identity Theft
Sebben and Sebben Employee Orientation
Mufti Trouble
Incredible Hippo
Babysitter
Birdnapped
Grodin
Juror In Court
The Death of Harvey

Most likely due to scheduling conflicts, Stephen Colbert takes a leave for three episodes and Phil Ken Sebban's absence is dealt with the typical Birdman humor we've come to love.

Gems in this last run would be Turner Classic Birdman, Sebben & Sebben Employee Orientation, Incredible Hippo, and Juror in Court. Extras are not fantastic, but still cool.  The Joke Timeline is great, showcasing in order every 'HA HA HA!', 'Bear', 'Back Off!', or 'Mightor Cough.' Lost points, though, for no commentaries or interviews.

If you already have volumes 1 and 2, this is a no brainer.",1185321600,20,1040,5.058479532163743
2814768,2,B000PAAJZG,"The episodes on this dvd are hilarious, save for the couple of episodes after Sebben bought the farm, but the dvd is a major ripoff. The special features are an absolute joke. No commentaries is a big letdown. I had these episodes on my computer, so buying the dvd was pointless. Oh well. Whatever. If you don't already own the episodes, the Incredible Hippo episode is worth the price of admission alone. LAFF RIOT.",1185235200,8,416,4.635135135135135
2814769,5,B000PAAJZG,"Adult Swim's Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law may have gone the way of the dodo, but the episodes collected in this third DVD volume feature more animated hysterics from the superhero turned lawyer.  In this collection, Harvey (voiced by Gary Cole) has to deal with the death of Phil Ken Sebben (voiced by Stephen Colbert) as well as endure his high school reunion.  Birdgirl (voiced by Paget Brewster) also returns, and there's even more insane and hilarious moments to come that make no sense whatsoever.  If there's any drawbacks to these episodes, it's that once Colbert departed the show, he was sorely missed to say the least.  His vocal talents as Phil Ken Sebben and Reducto was one of the best elements of the show, and while it was incredibly funny how his characters met their demise, his presence was still missed.  That aside though, there's still great work from Cole, Thomas Allen as Peanut, the great John Michael Higgins as Mentok, and Chris Edgerly as Potamus.  Not to mention that the ""Sebben & Sebben Employee Orientation"" episode, which spoofs orientation videos for new employees, is worth the price of admission alone.  All in all, this is yet another Adult Swim DVD that is an essential pick up.",1180137600,26,1218,4.826923076923077

2814775,5,B000PAAJZG,"Again, as part of the 90's Adult Swim movement, Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law, was a staple in the late night diet.  You watched Sealab 2021, Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Space Ghost. . .and then you watched things like Harvey Birdman.

The last season of the show was its greatest triumph.  I loved every episode and every joke.  It made you laugh, cry and remember that Stephen Colbert has always been the same, crass, sarcastic, politically charged fireball he was even after he did ""The Colbert Report.""

With more of the 90's dying out into obscurity, it is good to look back at Harvey and remember a time when everything was ""truly, truly Awesome.""",1426723200,3,651,4.675438596491228

It is possibly the most satirical show to ever grace the tv screen and it is not only clever but hilarious, for not all shows are both clever and laugh out loud funny. Most are just chuckle-worthy.

And do not be hestiant either because it is a cartoon. If you have ever heard of tv networks like Adult Swin played on the Cartoon Network late at night then you will realize that these are not any cartoons, they are for adults. They really are hilarious and this show alone features actors like Stephen Colbert from the Colbert Report and Dail Show, Lewis Black form COmedy Central standup as well as the Daily Show, Gary Coleman and so on. If you have ever even enjoyed Futurama, Family Guy or the Simpsons, then this show would be a welcomed joy in your life.",1272499200,,851,4.420382165605096
2814795,5,B000PAAJZG,"I accidentally recorded this on my dvr recently and decided to watch it to see what it was.  Harvey Birdman was defending Inch high Private Eye and it cracked me up.  Some friends had told me years ago that ""Adult Swim"" was hilariously funny but there are only a few cartoons I love (being an adult, most are from childhood memories)  but new toons, not so much so I never bothered to watch any of them on Adult Swim. It was so funny, I went to buy the show on dvd to see who else of my childhood favorites were in trouble with the law and the set was a bit expensive for me-for a cartoon of which I had only seen one episode.  Recently, the short volumes went on sale for $10 and I bought one and laughed out loud until all the episodes were watched. I came back and I had to get them all!

Truthfully, life can be pretty difficult and a good laugh is a much needed treat and can be hard to find on tv since most of what hollywood types find funny is just vulgar or mean and funny at someone's expense. I don't usually find that funny, no matter who's expense it is at and whether I like the person/group or not, I prefer comedy that's just comedy with no message or stab at someone, with no intent to disrespect people-there's only a few comedies on tv these days that are just funny for the purpose of being funny. Did I think I would be resorting to cartoons? Um, no.  Every single episode is freakin' hilarious. NOT FOR CHILDREN, but not offensive (so far) either.

The fact that he defends my favorite cartoon characters from the 70's is a great way to watch your old favorites in new material.  I haven't seen them all yet but when I need a lightweight laugh with a bit of nostalgia built in, this is a really great show!",1270339200,3,1728,4.183734939759036
2814796,5,B000PAAJZG,I think this show was cancelled way before it needed to be.  One of the best shows ever to premiere on Adult Swim.  This was the last season they had and the last I had to buy.  I highly recommend this DVD!,1265414400,,206,3.857142857142857
2814797,5,B000PAAJZG,if you liked the first two seasons you will still love this as it is just as bizare as the rest... maybe more so...,1255564800,,115,3.8333333333333335
2814798,4,B000PAAJZG,"Ladies and gentlemen of the Amazon jury, we have come to pay respects for out departed brethren of the legal system. Two years ago on this very day*, he sacrifice his life in the line of duty, in the form of an unpredictable circumstance; this fate was unavoidable due to the name of the final episode.  He was charismatic, handsome, and has a tone that would make women keel over....that lawyer is sadly not Bob Loblaw, but Harvey Birdman was a fine lawyer in all regards. Let's not forget his achievements such as becoming a drag-queen and selling himself for sun lotion, being one of many husbands of an office gal and have all but him consummate their vows, and working in a greek restaurant, none of which are court-related but let's not be harsh.  This is a ceremony for him in the form of the third set of ""Harvey Birdman: Attorney At Law.""  A DVD set can be a ceremony if you let it be.

For those who saw last thirteen parts of the whole magnum opus, we had some fond memories of the odd days.  Do you remember when Robert Osbourn of TCM showcased a lost vintage Birdman episode?  Boy, did Birdman had to save the world so many times, I can understand the stress in quitting his first job?  Do you remember about the special job orientation video?  I was shocked by how Sebben had that terrible incurable wound.  Do you remember that funny moment when Peter Potomus has his first traumatic sexual harassment?  Do you remember how Harvey Birdman had to redo 37 old cases (not to be a fanboy, I could've sworn he'd done less)?  Do you remember the time when we fell in love? Do you remember the time when we first met---oh wait, that's the song from one of The Jackson 5;&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-wonder-how-well-he-s-doing/dp/1603201300/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I wonder how well he's doing.</a>

A lot of the old cast comes back for this ceremony, along with the new ones such as Eliot; the copy center clerk has an annoying tendency to do things twice but I'm always swayed by his Lewis Black voice.  Nice to see my favorites for the last time doing what they do best: Peanut, always helpful when he's never in a nudie bar (which is all the time);  Peter Potomus, for being persistent for knowing who got the thing he sent 'cha;  Birdgirl, that sassy girl who's never out of sight of Birdman yet always appears whenever Judy Sebben isn't around; The bear, for...eating Timothy Treadwell.  Lest we forgot good ol' Phil Ken Sebben---hey, where is he?  I could've sworn he was around for a while; is he still doing his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/little-side-job/dp/B000UX6THU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">little side job</a>? (ha ha...-job)

I'm glad we had this ceremony, at least for the treats.  Too bad it is light on treats compared to the last ceremony, for all it has is a couple of voice sessions and other disposables.  Oh well, I had a much grander time with this ceremony; the 11-minute long memories were more grandeur, off-the-wall, and funnier than ever, dealing with real issues of animal rights and the right to ban puns, follow by longest and explosive final memory this remembrance is meant for. I'll miss this attorney, I spend a lifetime of seven years with this fellow; his working environment can be crass, and possibly too random at times, but when this man took a case, he got the job done; James Spader has nothing on this man.  Fly high, my soaring eagle.

There is another hilarious Birdgirl episode. The ""tasteful"" but lowbrow comedy that my teenagers can't seem to get enough of.
The Deadly Duplicator makes his appearance in a avalanche of running gags. The side references to Blade Runner and other old movies and shows had to be explained - but didn't detract.

Standout episodes in the complitation are ""Turner Classic Birdman,"" where the animators have fun inserting their own dialogue into footage from the original series (with knocks of course at the limited animation, continuity errors and other gaffaws prevalent in most of Hanna-Barbara's output from the era) ""Sebben & Sebber Employee Orientation"" which is a hilarious spoof of kind of soulless orientation crap people used to have to actually sit through, and of course the 30-minute series finale ""The Death of Harvey Birdman"" were our hero finally faces his destiny, raises to the challenge, and learns an important lesson about the destructive power of buses.
