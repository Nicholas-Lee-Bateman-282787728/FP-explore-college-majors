7276646,5,B00OUF237E,"What a splendid find! The first episode just sets the stage. By the third episode I was hooked and watched all the remaining episodes in.one day. The actors (whom I was not familiar with) were spectacular. The leads, especially Miss Becky Sharpe who never overplayed her shall we say devious character was mesmerizing and impossible to take my eyes off. What would be her next self serving plot be? Oh the character actors were bewitching. Kudos to great writing, great sets, superb make-up and costuming  right down to the carriage and buggy drivers' outfitting. I cannot say enough good things about this great mini-series.",1525564800,6,625,5.009615384615385
7276647,5,B00OUF237E,"This is a great version. Great actors, Great costumes, marvelous. More accordingly to the book. I wish some part were cut off like in the movie. But I was glad to see the real version.",1525564800,3,184,4.285714285714286
7276648,5,B00OUF237E,The very best adaptation of Vanity Fair! No problem playing it in the US--all newer DVD players will automatically convert it to NTSC for American TVs.,1503446400,,151,4.846153846153846
8719894,4,B00OUF237E,An actress that makes you loathe her has done her part! Rebecca Crawley it is.,1533859200,,78,4.266666666666667
8719895,2,B00OUF237E,"For a ~1987 acting is tolerable. Very choppy between scenes looks older than it is, 1960 films are clearer, and too many over-exaggerations of characters. There is a 2018 adaption coming out which will put this to shame, hopefully. Just wasted 1/2 a day binge watching which I'll never get back.",1533427200,,295,4.803921568627451
8719896,1,B00OUF237E,"Like most productions from this time period, the cinematography is extremely poor, and the over-the-top acting is comically theatrical. Neither come close to meeting today's high standards, rendering the series unwatchable.",1533340800,,223,6.225806451612903
8719897,5,B00OUF237E,Don't be put off with how aged this series might seem when you first watch it-- it's great!,1531267200,2,91,4.111111111111111
8719898,1,B00OUF237E,"Nearly all of the performances in this adaptation are terribly overacted. Special credit goes to Eve Matheson for the worst portrayal of Becky Sharp in the history of film. Here is one of the most beguiling and seductive characters in English literature, yet Matheson manages to make her positively repellent. Her mannerisms are awkward and hen-like. Her voice is shrill. Her facial expressions are idiotic. I don't blame just Matheson -- the directors should be imprisoned for their work and the editors banished to a remote island with no electricity (to ensure they never work on another production). And most of the actors deserve at least a good slap in the face. The timing is entirely off. There is no flow, no momentum. Even if this performance were on stage, it would be unacceptable. The only participant who did a decent job was the writer who adapted the novel for screen, Baron. Not terrible. I love this story so I tried so very hard to stick with this series. I couldn't make it to the end, though. It was torture seeing such a wonderful tale destroyed.",1531008000,,1068,4.747311827956989
8719899,5,B00OUF237E,"BBC series tend to be topnotch but this is one of the best.  The writing, production, and casting are all great.  The only disappointment is that it ends.",1529452800,2,154,4.464285714285714
8719900,4,B00OUF237E,Why is it that wicked people win? Rebecca Crawley is a viper. She is successful. In the end she gets everything she wants.,1528761600,2,122,4.3478260869565215
8719901,5,B00OUF237E,"Too good for this world. No puppeteering in this adaptation of Thackery's social satire. The cast, script, and production combine for the best adaptation (ever) of the novel - almost too sincere for Thackery's mockery of vanities. Kudos to Eve Matheson whose singing voice almost makes a Jane Eyre of Becky Sharp.",1527897600,2,313,5.038461538461538
8719902,5,B00OUF237E,Well done. Bravo!,1527638400,,17,5.0
8719903,5,B00OUF237E,Great adaptation of the book! I thoroughly enjoyed Vanity Fair.,1527033600,3,63,5.4
