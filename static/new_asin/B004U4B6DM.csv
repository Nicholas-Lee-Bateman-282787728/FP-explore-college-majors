8610239,5,B004U4B6DM,"This is a high quality Live DVD of Quiet Company at ACL Studio 6A. This DVD shows how truly amazing this band is. Amazing lyrics, melodies and the sheer energy that the guys project from the stage. The talent that this band possesses blows me away, constantly switching instruments. If you can't see Quiet Company at a live show, this is the next best thing.

Not only do you get an amazing live show, the DVD also includes bonus features: band commentary, music videos and hidden ""Easter Eggs.""",1301270400,2,495,4.625
