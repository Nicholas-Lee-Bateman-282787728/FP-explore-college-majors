2260817,1,B00092PP18,"I was thinking of purchasing this DVD until I read the reviews; thanks for the ""heads-up"". I own many LS dvds and my personal favorites are the ""Walk Away the Pounds"" series; the ""Walk Away the Pounds Express"" series; and the ""Walk Away the Pounds for ABs"" series. Each of these three series is professionally done; however, you do still have the subtle mistakes that are typical of Leslie. Each of the previously mentioned series have a 1-mile, a 2-mile, and a 3-mile session; the ""Express"" also has a 4-mile session (don't be afraid to try this one...it is not harder, just longer). Happy walking!",1131408000,13,599,4.714285714285714
2260818,1,B00092PP18,"As much as I like Leslie Sansone, I have to give this workout a one star rating.  The music was just terrible, the set was cheesy, the  people working out with Lesie looked liked they would rather be somewhere else, and there was nothing motivating about the entire workout.  I was very surprised with this production, since ""Walk Off the Pounds"" was a very good series.  By comparison, ""Walk Diet"" was almost depressing to watch and to workout with.  Leslie can do much better!",1124323200,16,478,4.642857142857143
2260819,1,B00092PP18,I have and use almost all of Leslie's videos and this one is very disappointing.  There is no chemistry between the group.  The editing keeps focus on the girl with the bare hip bones showing. The video is boring. The background is blah.,1120348800,30,237,4.488372093023256
2260820,2,B00092PP18,"I am a proud owner of Leslie Sanson's walking videos and continue to build my video library as I use the tapes in my exercise classes at two different churches. This is the most disappointing video Leslie has produced. The music is awful, the background depressing, and there are no new moves. I like the fact that she uses people of different sizes and ages. But when I am exercising, I need good music to keep me motivated. I did notice a glitch in the tape, apparently a mistake that was not edited out. Her best yet is the Express series, and Walk The Walk. I hope her future videos will reflect that same quality. Come on Leslie! I know you can do it!!",1115251200,20,657,4.306451612903226
2260821,4,B00092PP18,"This is typical of Leslie's 1 mile workouts incorporating the basic 4 moves she does with some arm work and a nice cool down at the end.  It also had the 2 mile.  I like the 1 mile tapes because I'm always short on time and the 1 miles fit into my lifestyle and I can get fit in a short amount of time.  I like the fact that when you are done with your 1 mile, she does the stretches before continuing on to the 2 mile.  It is nice to have the complete 1 mile and then if you choose to do the 2 mile, there is at least a break in between the 1 and 2 mile.  The music wasn't bad.  When you do it the 1st time, just like with any new video, you have to get your grounding of the steps but it is easy to follow as is all of Leslie's videos.  It is nice to see average people in this video that are dressed in different outfits and some are really fit, like the one gal with the cut stomach and then there are some overweight doing the exercises too so that is good to see not everyone fit right off the bat.  I think the other poster was too harsh on their review.  I think it is a great workout from Leslie.  KEEP THEM COMING LESLIE!  Walk Away The Pounds has been the ONLY effective workout for me since I had back surgery 3 years ago.  I can't do the jarring heavy aerobic type stuff.  Thank you Leslie for the walk aerobics!  They are MY FAVORITE!",1115251200,15,1348,3.872262773722628
2260822,1,B00092PP18,"The Pounds Veteran , What was I thinking when I decided to buy this ( I wanted a different workout at the time ) .  More importantly , LESLIE, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING IN PRODUCING SUCH AN AMATEURISH EFFORT ?? The music was too soft & not at all conducive for exercising to . Next there was a part in the 2 mile where the DVD suddenly skipped from walking  to kickbacks for 3 seconds at a different camera angle & then skipped back to walking where Leslie was just announcing that she was going to do some kickbacks next - How confusing ( Bad Editing ) !  Even the 1 Mile DVD that came free with Leslie's Walk Away The Pounds book is better than this . In fact I recommend that even beginners & unfit people & people who have not heard of Leslie Sansone should buy the Walk Away The Pounds 1 & 2 MilesDVD  instead as it is better value for money . The brighter , more colorful studio , the more enthusiastic background exercisers &  the great music ( that you can actually hear) make you much more inclined to use it more often ( hence it is the Number 1 selling exercise program in amazon.com )  . Of course if you use it more often plus go on a sensible diet  , you will achieve weight loss as a result like I did over 4 months . I am also maintaining my weight loss 8 months later as I still enjoy using Leslie's WATP & her other DVDs . Sorry Leslie but I am giving this Walk Diet DVD away to someone who hasn't exercised for a long time and who do not have any of your other programs . IF YOU OWN ANY OF LESLIE SANSONE'S OTHER WORKOUTS , STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE & SAVE YOUR MONEY & DISAPPOINTMENT.",1115164800,77,1599,4.025236593059937

2260825,4,B00092PP18,"The Walk Diet is an older (2005) but still effective exercise DVD from Leslie Sansone consisting of two exercise routines: a one mile walk and a two mile walk.

One Mile Walk:

This workout features Leslie and a cast of walkers of all ages and sizes from young and thin to older and overweight. The workout has Leslie's four basic Steps: walking in place, kicks, knee lifts, side steps as well as upper body movement. There are no unique moves in this workout - it is a basic one mile walk that lasts about twenty minutes. This is a quick but effective workout for beginners.

Two Mile Walk:

This workout features almost the same cast as the one mile walk and again has all of Leslie's standard moves. This is a pretty basic two mile walk the - only things added for extra intensity are double sidesteps, walking up and down while doing the knee lifts, and extra arm movements (for example touching the opposite hand to an opposite knee while doing knee lifts). Again, this is a good workout for beginners - perhaps those who have conquered the one mile walk and are ready to move on to a two mile walk.

The Walk Diet is a basic but effective Leslie Sansone workout that is great for beginners.",1395705600,5,1196,4.442922374429224

2260827,5,B00092PP18,It actually does get your heart pumping closer to the 15-20 min mark. I have been walking with Leslie for awhile now and this workout seems to be a bit on a beginner level plus little outdated. But I still enjoyed it :) little glitch in the middle with kickbacks.....you can see where they pasted a piece from a further kickback section piece that's coming up later......I am glad that in newer videos Leslie truly does it live.,1376006400,,428,4.5
2260828,5,B00092PP18,"I think this is a great walking tool to get a quick workout in if the weather is bad outside.  I actually prefer walking outside but if I'm short on time you can do a mile in 15 minutes or 2 miles in 30 minutes and its a good introductory workout that just about anyone can do.  When you are starting out or don't feel as strong on a certain day Leslie even encourages you to do as much as you can (walk instead of the kick or side to side moves).  It made me sweat so you do get heated up, reminded me of our Y's ""Silver Sneakers"" class.  I also bought the 4-mile and belly fat DVD but haven't tried those yet (the 4 mile I actually gave to my son).",1370044800,,650,3.8646616541353382

2260830,5,B00092PP18,"I highly recommend the Leslie Sansone 1,2,3, Mile Walk Diet because it does help to lost pounds. It is also good for heart.  Exercising for the heart does preveht chronic heart disease. I use this DVD because when it is cold or too hot to leave out to go to the gym, I just put in The Walk Diet.  The beat of the music is not for dancing. Leslie starts you off walking at the beat in a slow pace. The music increases allowing you to move at a faster pace (your heart rate increases ). The One Mile Walk is for 20 minutes.  She then slows your pace down, allowing your heart rate to lower.

I have purchase (3) for my friends!  They are enjoying it.",1324252800,,648,4.070866141732283
2260831,5,B00092PP18,This was simple yet effective walk workout. I especially like the fact that the people looked normal.

2260832,5,B00092PP18,"I purchased this video locally, but I am so amazed at the negative reviews that I felt obligated to share my opinion.

At 58, I am overweight & have been increasingly sedentary since my 40's. I am a computer programmer who works from home 3 out of 4 days of the week. I easily work (sitting) 12 to 14 hours a day.  One day, I realized that I only moved from the computer to go to the kitchen, the bathroom, or bed.

I have 9 months left on a 2 year membership at Bally's Gym. (I may have gone to the gym 4 times.) I own several other workout videos that never really worked for me - most of the time, I just couldn't keep up. Because of that, I found the workouts discouraging.

I knew my lifestyle was not conducive to good health, and I wanted to start a program of daily exercise, but I could never seem to just do it...until I bought this video - Walk Diet.

For me, this video is perfect - I don't have to leave home. I don't even have to get dressed.  I work up a good sweat, and while I'm building my stamina, I do the workout in 10 to 12 minute (1/2 mile) intervals. There are points, at those intervals in the video, that seem like natural breakpoints.  I exercise for 10 to 12 minutes, then I  put the video on pause and go back to my programming work for another couple of hours.

There are only 4 basic moves; and they are all done in an upright position.  I get a good workout; and, despite being out of shape, I am able to follow Leslie Sansone's instructions and keep up with all of her moves!! I find that I am  encouraged by my success and so motivated that I now exercise with this video nearly every day!

This video has been tremendously helpful to me and I recommend it highly. If you  want to develop a program of regular exercise.  This video is an excellent first step.",1310428800,,1793,4.114942528735632
2260833,4,B00092PP18,"I am - no, was - a very sedentary person. This walking tape really helped me to get moving. It's not too much for the beginner. I mastered the 1 mile, am currently doing the 2 mile and look forward to the day when I have enough energy and stamina to try the 3 mile. I love that it is not just a walking tape. I love that we move around and get the joints moving.

The only negative? The editing could have been better. Would have given it a 5 star otherwise.",1288656000,3,458,3.924731182795699
2260834,3,B00092PP18,"Yes, the music was awful and the set was kind of blah....but it was an exercise video that I could really get in to. Because if focused on just that, the exercise. I have been unable to really work out due to health issues and this video was exactly what I needed to get back up and start moving again. Basic steps, easy to follow instructions, and less than I paid at a gym for about the same thing for less money. I found it great that I had no excuse not to be able to walk when I can do this without leaving my home. There are no weights or other equipment with this video. It was simple and easy to follow along. I have read other reviews and most negative ones have focused on the set or music. Well, the way I see it, If I was out walking in this heat of summer or the freezing cold winter, I would be complaining then as well. This works well for me. In 5 weeks I have lost 11 lbs. I plan to keep walking it off. :)",1282953600,3,923,3.888888888888889

2260838,5,B00092PP18,"If you are overweight and really need to take off the lbs, you know how annoying it can be to look at videos of sexy little women who have no idea what being FAT is even like doing complicated moves to perfection.  This video is not like that.  It is very simple to follow and leaves you with no excuses for not getting up and getting some excercise.  I am constantly surrounded by small children and I have found this video great for squeezing in during nap time-no loud music or wild jumping moves to wake up the kids!  I can turn down the tv and easily follow along.",1240444800,,569,4.192660550458716
2260839,5,B00092PP18,"I hate to exercise and this video does what it is intended to do...get lazy couch potatoes like me to get up off our butts and move! It is not for intermediate or advanced walkers/exercisers/etc. by any means, but it is much better for you than not doing anything at all (which is what I would do if I were not walking with this video.) Also, it is snowing outside right now and I just walked a brisk pace with Leslie and her friends. I purchased the 1-mile DVD at a local discount store just to try it. I'm glad that I only paid $4 for it. The first time I did it, I thought it was way to easy (even though I am 50 lbs overweight and don't regularly exercise), so the next time that I put the DVD in, I just worked out at a faster pace than what Leslie was doing. I broke a sweat about halfway into the walk and feel like I accomplished something. I feel like I can do this a couple of times a day. It's only 19 mins each session and so I can work this around my baby's naps. Don't get this video if you regularly jog or go to spin class! It gets me moving and that's all that counts for me!",1234224000,,1092,3.9234234234234235
2260840,5,B00092PP18,"I love this video workout. I've had it about 5 weeks and do the 1-mile most mornings before I hop in the shower to get ready for work. I can already tell a difference in my waistline. I purchased it along with the Walk Away Your Waistline with the walk belt, and I switch back and forth between the two. I also like to hit the two-mile segments of both videos when I have a little more time. Leslie only slightly gets off beat in this one, which is an improvement on some of her others, because it's not even that noticeable and doesn't interfere with enjoying the workout.",1223424000,,573,4.26605504587156
2260841,5,B00092PP18,"I've never been one to excercise but this video gave me the motivation to change my lifestyle in that sense, yes the background isn't anything fancy or it may seem cheesy to some people but in the end it did what i bought it for, which is to get a WORKOUT. I bought this vedeo at Walmart but I wanted to leave a review about it after reading some of the low star comments that didn't do it justice, if you are like me and are looking for something to change your couch potato habbits this is it, now Im ready to move on to a higher impact more intense workout like the 3 and 4 mile and most definately it will be a tape from Leslie Sansone.",1209945600,,640,4.0078125
2260842,5,B00092PP18,"I had already bought the product when I read the reviews and I thought I might have made a mistake.  Not True.  I am very overweight and very out of shape.  This is perfect for me.  I think if it had been any more difficult I would have just quit.  In addition, the simple set helps me concentrate.  I think this is a perfect program for the REAL beginner.  So far I have done it twice a day - one mile each time - and am feeling good about myself.  If you are an old fashioned couch potato and want to make your life different try this.  By the way I am 59 years old and as everyone says if I can do it - you can.  Great if you want to begin.

It's not as strenuous a pace as Leslie's more challenging DVD's, but for someone like me, who's out of shape and is recovering from a leg injury it's wonderful. Leslie is engaging as always, gently encouraging you through the movements and music pace changes and before you know it, you've finished your mile. The exercises at the end for legs are also very good, provided you can lie down on the floor. Make sure you have a mat for that. Leslie does not use weights with this workout, but I've incorporated them whenever I use it and it's made the workout more challenging. If you're 21 and work out six times a week this is probably a DVD you could do in your sleep, but for people like me who are handicapped and need their cardio, it's perfect.",1173312000,7,851,4.461538461538462

I do it once in a blue moon just on days where I want an ultra-easy workout but I'm seriously thinking of just donating it to someone who has never worked out or just donating it to the library.

It was a pretty basic walking routine with nothing fancy but it was still a good workout!  You can make it a good workout if you work hard and work to your level.

As for the actual DVD...the background isn't cheesy either, just basic.  Your not doing the DVD to to look at goregous backgrounds but to get a workout`.  The other people on the DVD were people just like you and me.  There were a few older woman, a few younger, some overweight and some fit.  She does her normal talking and that is one reason why I like her DVD's so much, she is different from the rest.  There is a spot in the DVD where video messes up in the kickback area.  This also isn't an online exclusive as I got it at Target.

And its my opinion that you shouldn't post a ""review"" here and give it 1 star if you haven't actually done the DVD.  This isn't a chat place or board!  I did the workout and I gave it 4 stars for the workout and that is why I'm making a review.",1140739200,30,1114,3.986425339366516

8056802,3,B00092PP18,"""The Walk Diet"" is like a blast from the past if you've worked out with other more current Leslie Sansone DVDs. The two walking workouts are not bad and I didn't notice much about the set, just the colorful outfits which were nice. This is about as easy and simple as it gets with knee lifts, walking in place, kicks, side steps and kickbacks.

The editing could have been better as in one section Leslie is talking about doing the kickbacks but hasn't started them yet, and the screen flashes to people doing kickbacks. This did not seem as ""live"" as other DVDs I've worked out to. It seemed a bit more staged, which can be good in some respects because there was less idle chatter than normal.

I felt Leslie's cueing was also a bit off. She'd talk about doing things way before doing them, which might be nice for beginners but not so good for advanced exercisers. I tend to start doing whatever the instructor is talking about so that became a little frustrating.

Leslie does however have a very friendly, encouraging style of instruction and that is good if you are not feeling overly motivated to walk on any particular day of the month. I'd say this workout is mostly for those days when you don't want to think but you want to be active. The short cooldown and mild stretching is also nice.

So when doing this workout think 15 minutes per mile. So you can do 15, 30 or 45 minutes depending on your mood. One thing is you are not going to be doing a lot of upper body exercises. This is mainly core and legs.

Two irritating things about this DVD however include Leslie trying to brush her bangs out of the way time after time. While her haircut is cute it is not really appropriate for as much as she moves around. Also one girl looks like she needs an um...larger shirt because her hips are sticking out of her low cut yoga pants. I'm surprised Leslie let this slide and I will tell you it is very distracting and the camera men or women focused in on her a lot. You will just find yourself saying: ""Put some clothes on!""

So this is probably not something I'd do all the time but may do it when I'm in the mood not to think and not to move fast. Which happens about once a month.

The set is ugly, like a leftover corner in a high school theater room. The music is terrible. The editing is bad, bad, bad. At one point, you see the group doing kickbacks while Leslie's voiceover says, ""we'll start kickbacks soon"", and then it cuts to a different shot and they're still walking and haven't started the kickbacks yet.

As is usual in many of Leslie's DVDs, the pretty hard-bodies who have never been overweight in their lives are up front with Leslie, while the women who look like the rest of us are relegated to the back of the room.

And she talks NON-STOP.

Get her later DVDs, which are far more impressive and fun.",1430006400,,693,4.433070866141732
