5529935,5,B00AZL30H4,This was a very cute and inspiring movie. I recommend it for any girls night as a 'chick flick'! Good acting and a good theme make it a good movie to spend a Sunday afternoon watching...,1375574400,,186,4.194444444444445
5529936,3,B00AZL30H4,"Well shot and well meaning dramedy, slow in parts, touching in others, the Dove approved film offers tons of sentiment and a bit of romance.

Recently dumped, so-so artist Sara(Emmanuelle Vaugier) hooks up with her regretful, Zumba loving mother(Shelley Long) to go back to their small home town to try and save Grandma's place from demolition and perhaps, also, the old wedding chapel.

Sara, reluctantly, seeks the help of a handsome, joking, local councilman(Mark Deklin).  Meanwhile, widowed mom constantly reflects back on a love lost.  Is there a new chance of love in the air?  Stay tuned.

The actors are handsome, the setting, pretty; Shelley Long, who has been doing a lot of these mother roles lately, gets to do more in this one.  She still has that almost whining, sarcastic come back voice that was so funny in Cheers.  The script here is weak, and my wife kept saying, ""How sappy!""; however, she did want to see how things turned out, even though, I think it's quite predictable but sweet.

There are several improbable scenes: *SPOILER ALERT* For example, no way would they tear down that beautiful chapel; Also, the daughter gets thrown in jail for ""trespassing"", donning the prison overalls and all, just so they can show a cutesy scene with the hunky, loving it, councilman. *END ALERT*

Overall, not really a romantic comedy, but a good enough, clean, relationship flick, if you can accept the flaws, to relax on the sofa with your sweetie. Forget the kids watching, they'll run off and play within the first minute.",1375488000,14,1536,4.873076923076923
5529937,2,B00AZL30H4,"Loved the sweetness of the story, and I am always looking for family friendly movies.  But this script was just poorly written, with dialogue that wasn't believable.  Shelley Long's character was particularly badly written.  Example lines: ""Rats!""  and ""Groan....double groan.""  Who says this?  Acting was mediocre overall.",1368489600,4,323,5.76595744680851
5529938,5,B00AZL30H4,"Perfect family or date night movie. While it doesn't break any new ground it's an entertaining family romcom with likeable people and a warm, important message about family and the things in life that are truly important.",1367625600,18,221,5.0

5529969,2,B00AZL30H4,"I wish I could be more positive... it was slow, in fact so slow that we couldn't bother finishing it.
So maybe there is a surprise ending and it got better when we turned it off... we'll never know...",1398297600,2,200,4.153846153846154

5529971,2,B00AZL30H4,I bought this DVD because I liked many of the actors from seeing them on TV or in other movies.  Yet the good old days are not always that good and actors change too.  I also think the chemistry between many of the actors just wasn't there.  The movie kept falling flat for me and slow paced in areas and just way off in others.  The reason I watched the whole thing is because I was working in my bedroom and had it for background noise.  I also kept thinking it would get better because I liked the main actors in other movies.  I will not be keeping this DVD.,1393286400,2,562,4.0636363636363635

Determined to help preserve the historic building, Sara embarks on a mission that not only gives her a new outlook on life, but enables her mother to rekindle a long lost love from her past. Starring Emmanuelle Vaugier, Mark Deklin and Shelley Long, The Wedding Chapel is a story about love, forgiveness and embracing new beginnings.",1391990400,,602,4.574074074074074
5529974,3,B00AZL30H4,If you are just looking to pass time then this is the movie for you. I thought it would have been better but it was pretty basic. About a lady who is not religious but religiously wants to keep a church/wedding chapel open in her old neighborhood.,1390780800,,247,4.276595744680851

5529977,4,B00AZL30H4,"I have long been a Shelley Long fan, but somehow I missed this movie.  When I saw it was available on DVD, I got it.  It was a sweet story.  The dual love story was fun to watch.  There is also a story told in flashbacks, so that was fun to see too.

Shelley Long did a wonderful job, and for me this movie was all about watching her.  I enjoyed it!",1388188800,,349,3.7777777777777777

5529994,3,B00AZL30H4,It's okay to say you liked it a little bit nut it could be better. Hallmark needs a change the script,1379548800,2,101,3.857142857142857

8559676,3,B00AZL30H4,"Cheesy, fluff. Was Shelley longs character intoxicated in these scenes? Some of the scenes were awfully cheesy and the acting was awful too. There are some parts of the movie that were good but overall if you're looking for something light to watch this would do. Not great",1530489600,,273,4.708333333333333
