8583384,5,B00CMFJNCC,...a little known Cult masterpiece...not for all tastes...definitely for mine!,1497916800,,78,6.9
8583385,4,B00CMFJNCC,"What a crazy and visionary movie.  It doesn't have high production values, though, so it's for people who loved movies like _Putney Swope_ and _Eraserhead_.",1492819200,,156,5.24
8583386,3,B00CMFJNCC,"An interesting movie, but not one that I would watch again. Carey was great in ""Paths of Glory"".",1455667200,,96,4.388888888888889
8583387,5,B00CMFJNCC,"I bought this movie for my brother who loves everything weird.  I refuse to watch it, but my brother declared it was wonderful!  He says it was raw (the quality, etc) but absolutely loved it.  He fell in love with Timothy Carey on Colombo (I think)...a very brief appearance was enough to start an obsession, he felt the actor had weird cool vibe and wanted to see more.",1423699200,,370,4.411764705882353
8583388,2,B00CMFJNCC,"I'm a big Tim Carey fan, but this movie is just terrible and he's terrible in it.  Maybe I just don't ""get"" it, but I suspect there's really nothing to get about this film.  It really perplexes me that the other reviewers liked it.  To me, the one interesting thing about it is that it proves Carey didn't always talk through his teeth.  You can actually understand him (but only when the sound guy is holding the boom in the right place).

The dialogue sounds like it was ad-libbed by the actors.  The speeches Carey makes to his loyal followers are meaningless rants.  All he ever says is, ""You're all super human beings,"" and this seems to be sufficient to make him a contender for the White House.  And, when he pulls out his guitar and starts gyrating, it's so bizzare you can't even laugh at it.  I'm embarrassed for Carey, even though he's dead.

Personally, I prefer the villanous Carey of ""The Killing"" and ""One-Eyed Jacks"" who spoke every line without moving his lips.

The ending was perfect for a Dracula film, but I have no idea how it fit into this particular story.  Frank Zappa, who scored this film, called it ""the worst movie ever made.""  Zappa was a smart guy.",1414886400,,1179,4.47887323943662
8583389,5,B00CMFJNCC,"Best filmed entertainment ever, he not the worst man though, I see worse in village, dictator meaner than this man.",1405382400,,115,4.8
8583390,3,B00CMFJNCC,The actual film is five stars and probably the best example of the grand eccentricity of Timothy Carey. The quality of the print offered in this DVD-R on demand format is directly from the original negative and looks fine. My only complaint is that the film is letterboxed from the original 4:3 (full screen) aspect ratio which crops image from the top and bottom. I've seen World's Greatest Sinner broadcast on Turner Classic Movies and the print offered for that broadcast was not letterboxed. Unfortunately this is all that is available at the time being or at least until a licensing deal is made to properly release the film to DVD/Blu-ray.,1386806400,8,645,4.81981981981982
8583391,4,B00CMFJNCC,"There are some things to appreciate in this film. Mr. Careys performance is nothing less than remarkable, even when you have no idea what he's up to for minutes on end (church scene).  His stage show to gather ""followers"" is hilarious as it mimics charismatic christianity and rock 'n roll idolatry. Other wonderfully strange scenes include his followers rioting by beating on automobiles for a really long time. I'm not really sure why they were rioting or why they had such a big problem with the cars, but on it went. I'd really like to know what happened to the ""God"" jacket.... my guess is Romeo has it.",1382054400,,608,4.62962962962963
8583392,4,B00CMFJNCC,"I would've punched in a 5-star rating for a blu-ray with anamorphic 16:9 widescreen plus extra features. As it is, this a bare-boned DVD-R (no menu, no subtitles), and The World's Greatest Sinner (TWGS) is presented in a non-anamorphic letterboxed widescreen.

After a rough looking, choppy 109-second title sequence, the black & white image quality is pretty good for an old indie film. True, the image and sound quality vary from scene to scene (even shot to shot, at times) because TWGS was cobbled together over several years from footage shot by several different cameramen.

What's the major attraction? Two words: Timothy Carey. He wrote, produced, directed, starred in, and distributed TWGS.

I'd probably seen him a dozen times on TV (playing hulking cowboys in westerns or crazy-eyed thugs on crime shows) before he appeared as a spooky mountain man in The Monkees' 1968 feature HEAD. After that, the name Timothy Carey was etched on my brain.

Since 2001, when I started collecting DVDs, I found The Outfit (1973), One Eyed Jacks (1961), Paths of Glory (1957), etc., but TWGS was only available as a VHS tape (sold online by Carey's son) or shown on TCM intermittently (or as a pirated download). So, here's the DVD-R.

TWGS opens with what looks like Carey's family home movies with a creepy narration by Paul Frees (best remembered as a voice artist on Rocky & Bullwinkle) that sets up the conflict between God and Satan. Then our hero goes to his mundane insurance job and flips out. Eventually, with the oratory skills of Adolf Hitler and the sexual appetite of Larry Flint, he embarks on a politico-religious mission to create The Eternal Man's Party and become POTUS. He changes his name from Clarence Hilliard to God Hilliard and uses rockabilly and a fake beard to sway his followers, who declaim, ""We can do anything we want! We're gods!""

The musical score of TWGS was written by Frank Zappa (who, oddly enough, also appears briefly in The Monkees' HEAD); it sounds like fairly ordinary horn & string orchestration through the first half, but gradually becomes more recognizably Zappa-esque with odd time signatures and marimba.

If you dig the films of Ed Wood and Ray Dennis Steckler (who did some camerawork on TWGS), then you'll like The World's Greatest Sinner.

And speaking of Wood, I'm pretty sure the Baptist church elders, who put up the money for Plan 9 From Outer Space, would have been pleased if they'd gotten TWGS instead. At least, they would've applauded the last act of the film -- if they'd managed to sit through the first 50 minutes of madness.",1379635200,13,2586,4.861363636363636
