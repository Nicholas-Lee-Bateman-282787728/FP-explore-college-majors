8687451,4,B00PCSVOAU,"Low budget but really enjoyed the film, great CGI, good acting, spooky monks, something different and not just another rehash of a zombie film or something that's been done a 1000 times before. Made me jump too, great opening credits that really impressed me, the sounds pretty good for a low budget film, I would give this a watch.",1421971200,,332,4.6440677966101696
8687452,4,B00PCSVOAU,"Wild Eye Releasing are a great company if you are a film maker trying to get your work out.

From Nottingham, UK - Jay Brown (Director) makes his first feature after making short movies and takes on the supernatural with ""A Date With Ghosts"". His actor friends and family act out in this film and they all pull together to make a down-to-earth horror film on a low budget.

If you are a film maker, I suggest you should check this out and open your eyes to the lower rank films with promise. For the time and budget and saying it's shot on just a HD camera, it's worth a watch. Jason is doing the Indie film scene proud in his home city of Nottingham.",1421798400,,651,4.2
